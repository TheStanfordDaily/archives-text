# Senate OKs more money
## Conference funds approved 
### BOB BARCKLAY Daily staff 
A proposal by the Guest Professorship Bureau (GPB)
to sponsor a plenary session during this weekend's Public
Policy Conference was approved by a vote of 12 to 1 in a
special ASSU Senate meeting last night.
The same proposal had been defeated the day before in
an appropriations committee vote and set the stage for
some last-minute decision making on the part of the senate,
while conference organizers waited for the outcome.
The GBP changed its budget during Dead Week last
quarter when guest professor David Brower informed the
bureau that he would not be able to attend the conference
as planned. As a result, two new speakers were invited —
soft energy experts Martin and Amory Lovins — whose
fees raised the cost of the session.
The large increase in the GPB's budget, aimed at financ

ing a session on environmental issues, required senate ap
proval. Last night was the first time the senate has con
vened since the beginning of the quarter.
Some senators did express concern that an approval of
the GPB budget would contradict a by-law which forbids
the GPB from inviting speakers for one-day events. Ini
tially, this had not been a problem because Brower, the
speaker orginally scheduled to talk at the session, is
already a guest professor here this quarter.
Senator Donna Anderson argued that this incident was
a specific case in which the concerns of the students were
more important than a senate by-law. The Public Policy
Conference is the culmination of more than a year of plan
ning and the work of more than 100 volunteers. It was
proposed by the ASSU Lobby Office and planned in con-

juction with a number of student
groups on campus. It is free to Stan
ford students.
Lobby Office Director John Hoff
mire said the goal of the conference is
to increase political awareness and
participation, perhaps expressed most
succinctly by flyers currently being
circulated on campus which say,
"Apathy? No thank you."
"We have over a thousand people
registered for the conference and ex

pect a greater number to attend the
conference without having regis
tered," Hoffmire said.
Organizers indicated that a large
number of these people are not from
the University. "We have people com
ing from 55 campuses and 15 to 20
high schools," according to Craig Rich
ards, a Stanford alumnus who arrived
at Stanford two days ago to offer his
help to the conference.
The manpower involved has been
substantial. "Over 100 people have
been involved in the organizing of this
conference," Richards said. He esti
mated that at least 1000 hours of work

would have to go into the running of
the event over the next three days.
A good deal of work has already
gone into a media blitz to publicise the
forum.
Richards said publicity for the con
ference started in the fall and at least
$1000 has been spent so far. Press
conferences are scheduled throughout
today.
More than 35 campus groups parti
cipated in organizing the conference,
which will cost approximately $30,000
in all.
It will consist of a number of ses
sions covering topics ranging from

Middle East policy to draft registra
tion. Each session will be gi\en by
guest speakers that are experts in their
field.
Organizers have arranged for repre
sentatives from the three Democratic
presidential candidates to attend. Hoff
mire said the Lobby Office recently
got a representative of the Reagan
campaign to come . but added that
"they haven't taken us really
seriously."
The conference will begin today
with a welcoming address by NBC
News anchorman Tom Brokaw in
White Plaza.
