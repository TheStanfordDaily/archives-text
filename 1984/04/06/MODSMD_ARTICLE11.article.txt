## The 						Stanford Daily Blackball the blacklist

Gary Hart. David Brinkley. Ralph Nader. Wal

Not exactly the types you'd consider to be radi
cal anti-Americans. Unless, of course, you hap
pen to be the United States Information Agency.
Hart, Brinkley, Nader and Cronkite are four of
the at least 84 Americans the USIA has decided
shouldn't be allowed to make government
sponsored speeches overseas.
Others the USIA has decided too risky to rep
resent the United States include Shirley Chis
holm. McGeorge Bundy, Allen Ginsberg and
John Kenneth Galbraith, in addition to three
Stanford professors: Albert Gelpi, Barbara Char
lesworth Gelpi and Richard Fagen.
How were the blacklisted Americans chosen?
We don't really know; the USIA destroyed that
information.
What we do know is that USIA chief Charles
Wick told The New York Times that "some of the
people'' he banned from government-sponsored
speeches "may have been turned down for politi
cal bias. But not too many."

Apparently, lists of potential overseas speakers
were circulated among top officials at the USIA,
and any of those officials could strike off people
they wanted banned. Those people were then
added to the overall blacklist.
One USIA official allegedly told the agency's
former director of programs to "get the liberals
off' the list of approved speakers and "get the
good people, the New York neo-conservatives,
on the list." '
That the United States, the world's self
proclaimed bastion of free speech and liberty,
would try to prevent its own citizens from speak
ing overseas only because they might not agree
with the policies of the current administration is
ridiculous.
What makes this country great, our leaders are
fond of saying, is that all Americans have the right
to speak out freely. Shouldn't the United States
promote that image around the world? Ap
parently, the USIA doesn't think so. But if
America ever hopes to lead the world by exam
ple, and not by force, the USIA had better change
its mind.
