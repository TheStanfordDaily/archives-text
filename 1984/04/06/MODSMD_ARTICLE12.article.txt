## Nicaragua: the legacy of Sandino 
### 
Managua, Nicaragua — On Feb. 21, the 50th
anniversary of the assassination of General
Augusto Cesar Sandino, Nicaragua announced na
tional elections for Nov. 4 of this year, bringing to
a close the country's initial stage of reconstruction
following its 1979 revolution. The intention to
hold what will be the first free elections in
Nicaraguan history was part of the original pro
gram of the FSLN, even prior to its overthrow of
the hated Somoza dictatorship.
Sandino, "The General of Free Men," was the
first Latin American leader to mount a guerrilla

war against U.S. military intervention. His legacy
continues today as an inspiration that extends to all
of Latin America. In spirit and in essence, San
dino's descendants have pursued a struggle against
U.S. domination in Nicaragua that goes beyond
mere patriotic nationalism.
The implications of the history of Sandino for
U.S. Latin American policy have been missed or
discounted by the Reagan administration. There
are certainly those in Washington who, if only by
( virtue of years, ought to remerrfber Sandino's guer
rilla war against \J.S. forces in Nicaragua from
'1926 to r NicUraguatis remember quite
clearly, and many surviving seniors, men and wo
men, are proud to share tales of fighting alongside
Sandino. The Marines were defeated, forced to
withdraw from what Washington conceded had
become a quagmire.
The spirit of Sandino lives on in Nicaragua. The
solidarity of Western European governments, and
that of the thousands of Europeans and U.S.
citizens who have visited, lived and worked in
Nicaragua lend endorsement to the social experi
ment being carried out here. The setting of a firm
election date underscores a sincere desire
grounded in nearly 60 years of struggle to actualize
the message of Sandino. In 1929, "The General of
Free Men" wrote:
That which inspires us is the desire that the
Yankee not find any pretext to continue
treading upon our native soil, and at the
same time, to demonstrate to the civilized
world that we Nicaraguans are capable of ar
ranging our own affairs as a free, sovereign
nation.

Elections in Nicaragua, like those throughout
the region, were traditionally fraudulent. Through
out the first three decades of the 20th century, the
U.S. military presence converted Nicaragua into a
U.S. protectorate. The electoral model implanted
there has been duplicated throughout Central

America and the Caribbean. Armed occupations
and military intervention would be halted only by
meeting Washington's price, putting "its man" in
power after "free," supervised elections.
The durability of "elected" dictatorships
favored by the United States in the region is im
pressive: Übico (Guatemala, 1930-44); Hernan
dez (El Salvador, 1932-45); Carias (Honduras,
1933-48); Trujillo (Dominican Republic, 1930-
61); the Somoza dynasty (1936-79). All these men
were driven from power or assassinated. All were
"Uncle Sam's men."
The concept of the "supervigilance" of national
elections by "impartial observers" (read: the
United States) has been revived recently in
Nicaragua by opposition political parties with con-

tra sympathies. They support what has been called
"Somocismo without Somoza." The tradition of
"supervigilance" arose with U.S. military supervi
sion of the 1927 Nicaraguan elections, to ensure an
"orderly" process. Such elections have served as
the means to distribute political power in accord
with U.S. interests. The March elections scheduled
for El Salvador, or those promised for a Grenada
"liberated" by a U.S. invasion are contemporary
examples.

Given the history of U.S. political and military
intervention in Central America, how are we to
understand the political process in El Salvador?
Despite the second round of national elections in
as many years, the civilian death toll since 1979 at
the hands of Salvadoran government forces passed
40,000 this year. The Kissinger Commission
proposes augmented military aid.
And Guatemala, where the CIA engineered the
overthrow of a democratically elected government
in 1954? More than 100,000 civilians have been
slaughtered by that government in the ensuing 30
years. We can expect U.S.-promoted elections
scheduled there for July to be used as a pretext to
resume military aid cut off in 1977, for what con
tinues to be consistently the worst human rights

violator in all Latin America.
How are we to understand an administration
that has spent $73 million to date in its efforts to
overthrow the Sandinista government, simply he
cause the Nicaraguan people had the temerity to
emulate Sandino and put an end to 43 years of
Somoza dictatorship? The Nicaraguans have not
forgotten the man who has become a symbol of
resistance, a Central American "David" to the
U.S. "Goliath." A quick reading of the founding
documents of the United States reveals the af
firmation of every country's right to a revolution
against tyranny.
The real threat to stability in the region is not
Nicaragua. It is expanding U.S. militarization, and
a pathological intolerance for countries who would
chart their own path to social equality, economic
freedom and political non-alignment. The real
crime against human sensibility is not the Sandi
nista revolution. It is Washington's support for
totalitarian forces that would impose the U.S.
model of "democratic" economic development
throughout the hemisphere, whatever the ethical
deformity or cost in human life.
* * *
It suits U.S. purposes to characterize Nicaragua
as the vfcly non-democracy in Central America.
Thus the flurry of election activity in Guatemala
and El Salvador, with the extraordinary insistence
upon "supervigilance" only in the case of
Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega says that this U.S. insis
tence "disguises a threat and ratifies the U.S.
policy of aggression against Nicaragua." Secretary
of State George Shultz says that the realization of
elections "will not impede continued U.S. opposi
tion to the leftist regime of Nicaragua." He ap
parently imagines a return to 1927 when U.S.
troops kept Nicaraguan elections "fair."
Shultz "deplores" the possibility of the 16-year
old vote in Nicaragua, while Nicaraguan militia
members considerably younger than that continue
to die defending their country in the un
declared contra war financed and directed from
Washington. The youth of Nicaragua, besides car
rying out the literacy campaign and spearheading
the agricultural production brigades, were the es
sence of the insurrection against Somoza.
The Nicaraguans have a saying: "We already
had our elections in 1979, and the people won.
After 50 years, Sandino lives on." While we in the
United States may have never heard of Sandino,
the people of Nicaragua have not forgotten. There
is still time for the North American people to learn
from the lesson of that man, and prevent the
human tragedy that the recycling of washed-out
history in Central America will surely entail.

Elections in Nicaragua, like those throughout
the region, were traditionally fraudulent. Through
out the first three decades of the 20th century, the
U.S. military presence converted Nicaragua into a
U.S. protectorate. The electoral model implanted
there has been duplicated throughout Central

America and the Caribbean. Armed occupations
and military intervention would be halted only by
meeting Washington's price, putting "its man" in
power after "free," supervised elections.
The durability of "elected" dictatorships
favored by the United States in the region is im
pressive: Übico (Guatemala, 1930-44); Hernan
dez (El Salvador, 1932-45); Carias (Honduras,
1933-48); Trujillo (Dominican Republic, 1930-
61); the Somoza dynasty (1936-79). All these men
were driven from power or assassinated. All were
"Uncle Sam's men."
The concept of the "supervigilance" of national
elections by "impartial observers" (read: the
United States) has been revived recently in
Nicaragua by opposition political parties with con-

tra sympathies. They support what has been called
"Somocismo without Somoza." The tradition of
"supervigilance" arose with U.S. military supervi
sion of the 1927 Nicaraguan elections, to ensure an
"orderly" process. Such elections have served as
the means to distribute political power in accord
with U.S. interests. The March elections scheduled
for El Salvador, or those promised for a Grenada
"liberated" by a U.S. invasion are contemporary
examples.

Given the history of U.S. political and military
intervention in Central America, how are we to
understand the political process in El Salvador?
Despite the second round of national elections in
as many years, the civilian death toll since 1979 at
the hands of Salvadoran government forces passed
40,000 this year. The Kissinger Commission
proposes augmented military aid.
And Guatemala, where the CIA engineered the
overthrow of a democratically elected government
in 1954? More than 100,000 civilians have been
slaughtered by that government in the ensuing 30
years. We can expect U.S.-promoted elections
scheduled there for July to be used as a pretext to
resume military aid cut off in 1977, for what con
tinues to be consistently the worst human rights

violator in all Latin America.
How are we to understand an administration
that has spent $73 million to date in its efforts to
overthrow the Sandinista government, simply he
cause the Nicaraguan people had the temerity to
emulate Sandino and put an end to 43 years of
Somoza dictatorship? The Nicaraguans have not
forgotten the man who has become a symbol of
resistance, a Central American "David" to the
U.S. "Goliath." A quick reading of the founding
documents of the United States reveals the af
firmation of every country's right to a revolution
against tyranny.
The real threat to stability in the region is not
Nicaragua. It is expanding U.S. militarization, and
a pathological intolerance for countries who would
chart their own path to social equality, economic
freedom and political non-alignment. The real
crime against human sensibility is not the Sandi
nista revolution. It is Washington's support for
totalitarian forces that would impose the U.S.
model of "democratic" economic development
throughout the hemisphere, whatever the ethical
deformity or cost in human life.

It suits U.S. purposes to characterize Nicaragua
as the vfcly non-democracy in Central America.
Thus the flurry of election activity in Guatemala
and El Salvador, with the extraordinary insistence
upon "supervigilance" only in the case of
Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega says that this U.S. insis
tence "disguises a threat and ratifies the U.S.
policy of aggression against Nicaragua." Secretary
of State George Shultz says that the realization of
elections "will not impede continued U.S. opposi
tion to the leftist regime of Nicaragua." He ap
parently imagines a return to 1927 when U.S.
troops kept Nicaraguan elections "fair."
Shultz "deplores" the possibility of the 16-year
old vote in Nicaragua, while Nicaraguan militia
members considerably younger than that continue
to die defending their country in the un
declared contra war financed and directed from
Washington. The youth of Nicaragua, besides car
rying out the literacy campaign and spearheading
the agricultural production brigades, were the es
sence of the insurrection against Somoza.
The Nicaraguans have a saying: "We already
had our elections in 1979, and the people won.
After 50 years, Sandino lives on." While we in the
United States may have never heard of Sandino,
the people of Nicaragua have not forgotten. There
is still time for the North American people to learn
from the lesson of that man, and prevent the
human tragedy that the recycling of washed-out
history in Central America will surely entail.

Managua, Nicaragua — On Feb. 21, the 50th
anniversary of the assassination of General
Augusto Cesar Sandino, Nicaragua announced na
tional elections for Nov. 4 of this year, bringing to
a close the country's initial stage of reconstruction
following its 1979 revolution. The intention to
hold what will be the first free elections in
Nicaraguan history was part of the original pro
gram of the FSLN, even prior to its overthrow of
the hated Somoza dictatorship.
Sandino, "The General of Free Men," was the
first Latin American leader to mount a guerrilla

war against U.S. military intervention. His legacy
continues today as an inspiration that extends to all
of Latin America. In spirit and in essence, San
dino's descendants have pursued a struggle against
U.S. domination in Nicaragua that goes beyond
mere patriotic nationalism.
The implications of the history of Sandino for
U.S. Latin American policy have been missed or
discounted by the Reagan administration. There
are certainly those in Washington who, if only by
( virtue of years, ought to remerrfber Sandino's guer
rilla war against \J.S. forces in Nicaragua from
'1926 to r NicUraguatis remember quite
clearly, and many surviving seniors, men and wo
men, are proud to share tales of fighting alongside
Sandino. The Marines were defeated, forced to
withdraw from what Washington conceded had
become a quagmire.
The spirit of Sandino lives on in Nicaragua. The
solidarity of Western European governments, and
that of the thousands of Europeans and U.S.
citizens who have visited, lived and worked in
Nicaragua lend endorsement to the social experi
ment being carried out here. The setting of a firm
election date underscores a sincere desire
grounded in nearly 60 years of struggle to actualize
the message of Sandino. In 1929, "The General of
Free Men" wrote:
