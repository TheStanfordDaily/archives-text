In today's column, I will try to deal
with three frequently asked questions.
Why aren't all University dor
mitories coed by room?
There is no clear answer. The facts
are that most incoming freshmen re
quest "coed by room" housing and
that hence many receive "coed by
floor" residence assignments against
their wishes. I was told by University
officials that the cost of converting the
plumbing would be prohibitively ex
horbitant if dorms were to be so con
verted. Perhaps other more sub
stantive reasons exist for this policy,
but I doubt that they counterbalance
the profound reasons for altering
housing so that it is primarily "coed by
room."
Separating men and women ,is
ridiculous in a world which neighbors
and close friends will come from both
sexes. Res Ed seeks to prepare stu
dents to live and deal with those of dif
ferent backgrounds, races and values,
yet fundamentally contradicts itself by
assigning men and women to different
floors, thus making social contact
more forced and awkward, and reduc
ing the understanding and social
edification which results from close
exposure to others.
Sharing a floor means being forced
to understand, compromise and agree
on how to live together, but Res Ed is
determined for many to miss these
valuable experiences with regard to
the opposite sex.
Why is the Gay and Lesbian Al
liance at Stanford sponsoring a talk by
a pedophiliac?
I don't know. In recent years the
emergence of gay rights has been a
major social development, one of this
area's most prominent social move
ments. At Stanford, the recent outrage
over the destruction of the "Gay
Liberation" statue, an outrage felt
across many social groups in the Stan
ford community, reflects the basically

healthy, tolerant environment which
exists here with regard to the gay com
munity.
Recently, however, the major gay
organization, GLAS, sponsored a talk
by an admitted pedophiliac (one who
conducts sexual relationships with
minors) who had had a relationship
with a young boy. As reported, he said
that man-boy relationships involving a
seven-year-old boy could be accep
table.
Actually, pedophilia is a sickness
which usuaily tragically victimizes vul
nerable youths. It is a felonious crime.
GLAS association with this topic un
dermines its more worthy efforts, and
damages the relatively good environ
ment which exists here on campus for
the gay community.

Why does a basic contradiction exist
between University policy and Univer
sity Police policy regarding alcohol use
by minors?
Once again, no practical answer is
evident. On the one hand. Res Ed,
through its resident fellows and resi
dent assistants, collects dorm dues,
and then purchases and distributes al
cohol, sometimes in public places such
as the Donner Street Party. Often,
these same RAs are minors. On the
other hand, police ticket minors in
possession of alcohol and order court
appearances on this charge.
A clear contradiction appears to ex
ist: Leaders of the University commu
nity correctly advocate making alcohol
use among 18-20 year-olds an individ
ual decision, and offer consumption of
alcohol as an acceptable option by ac
quiescing to its purchase and distribu
tion by its employees (residence
staffs); Stanford Police officials, sup
posedly serving the community, and
directed by its leaders, then pursue the
"possession of alcohol" offenses.
