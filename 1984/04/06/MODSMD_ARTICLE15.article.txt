## El Salvador elections mainly a PR ploy 
### 
The claims that the turnout in the March 25 Sal
vadoran presidential election constitute a triumph
of democracy run counter to the reality 1 witnessed
as an observer of the election. In the course of
visiting eight polling places on election day, it
became clear to me and the other members of the
ecumenical group I was travelling with that the
great majority of Salvadorans were voting, not out
of democratic fervor, but out of stark fear.
Under Salvadoran law, voting is mandatory.
Failure to vote can be easily detected, since one's

cedula, (I.D. card) is stamped when one votes, and
this is a document that authorities frequently look
at in the course of a Salvadoran s daily life. Such
failure is punishable by a stiff fine; it may also
result in the loss of one's job. More importantly,
many Salvadorans fear that it may bring an even
worse punishment. In a society as permeated by
repression and fear as that of El Salvador, citizens
see the failure to perform any obligatory action as
an extremely dangerous move.
The Salvadoran government encouraged this
view in the week preceding the-election. Official
rhetoric identified voting with patriotism and
abstention from the polls as subversion, in a con
text where that distinction is a matter of life and
death. And a government-sponsored ad that ran
repeatedly in all the major newspapers showed a
picture of a hulking, grim-faced soldier next to the
caption, "You are obliged to vote."
We interviewed dozens of Salvadorans on elec
tion day, and by far the most common motive they
gave for voting was fear; they were afraid of the

consequences should they fail to get their cedulas
stamped. Many people we talked with told us that
their relatives and acquaintances were voting for
the same reason. Again and again we heard such
cynical comments as "our only alternatives are to
vote or to vote," and "voting is a right and an obli
gation — but more an obligation than a right."
The fact that fear was the dominant motive for
voting was further substantiated by incidents that
took place at a couple of polling places in the
countryside. In the rural town of Zacatecoluca, at
least 1000 people were unable to vote because not
enough ballots had been provided. The fact that
they couldn't vote clearly did not cause them
nearly as much anxiety as the prospect of having to
return home with their cedulas unmarked; in fact,
they simply refused to leave until they had gotten
them stamped. The authorities finally gave in and
stamped them. At another rural polling place, a
large number of people who were unable to vote as
a result of another bureaucratic foul-up literally
begged journalists on the scene to testify that it
wasn't their fault that they hadn't voted. People
who were unable to vote for one reason or another
frequently showed signs of extreme fright; some
were on the verge of tears.
A poll conducted by a Salvadoran firm shortly
before the election provides additional evidence
that fear was the most common motive for voting.
One of the items in the survey, which was author
ized by Salvadoran and U.S. officials, asks the
respondent's reason for voting. By far the most
frequent response was that voting was obligatory.
When we asked Salvadorans waiting at the polls
if they felt any enthusiasm regarding the election,
the response was generally negative. One replied

that it was only the middle and upper classes that
were enthusiastic, not the poor. Another seconded
this assertion, stating that only the rich really
hoped to benefit from the election, that the poor
were voting simply to avoid trouble.
What 1 witnessed on election day was not an
outpouring of "democratic effervescence" (to use
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering's phrase,) but
an outpouring of fear. Not that the Salvadoran
people do not desire democracy; they are simply
perceptive enough to realize that the context for it,
and for genuinely meaningful elections, simply
does not exist in contemporary EI Salvador. They
recognize that an election cannot by itself magi
cally produce a democracy from scratch. As one
Salvadoran we talked with put it, one cannot play
the hymn of democracy on a piano which has a
single key — that of elections — functioning. And
they understand, finally, that the election is not
really intended for their benefit at all, but for that
of the U.S. Congress and public; as a man we inter
viewed bitterly remarked, "Elections have
surpassed coffee as our leading export to the
United States."
It would be truly tragic if this gigantic exercise in
image projection succeeded, if we Americans ac
cept at face value the carefully stage-managed
spectacle designed to convince us that El Salvador
is a budding democracy. For this would give Presi
dent Reagan free reign to pursue the illusory mili
tary solution he so ardently desires. And this, in
turn, would mean still greater agony and terror for
the long-suffering Salvadoran people.
