## Psychology studies come out of basement 
### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
Several years ago Psychology
Prof. Philip Zimbardo con
ducted an experiment in the
basement of the Psychology De
partment in which male college
students were given roles as
either guards in a prison or
prisoners. The results were both
enlightening and famous: The
participants got so into their
roles that the experiment had to
be terminated after six days in
stead of the proposed two weeks
and a television network
rxJuvdlbpcU ,U >script tor ii TV
drama.
"You won't see anything of
that caliber now," said Assistant
Psychology Prof. Philip
Peake. "It would be difficult to
get human subjects. . . . You
would be hard pressed to get the
panel to approve that."
The panel is the Human Sub

jects Committee, the group that
reviews proposals for experi
ments made by graduate stu
dents in the Psychology Depart
ment. It is unlikely, however,
that the panel will find many ob
jectionable proposals.
"There's a common com
plaint about psychology experi
ments," said Dan Corvone, a
graduate student in psychology.
"They're boring."
Graduate students concen
trate on one of five areas: per
sonal, social, cognitive, develop
mental and physiological, and
Work Closely with the faculty
members who initiate the re
search. The first four areas
usually involve work with
patients at the Veterans Admin
istration (VA) Hospital and
nursery school or Psychology 1
students. Research in the fifth
field, physiology, is often done
on non-human subjects such as

rabbits or fish.
The social division conducts
studies that continue for years,
said one student, with individual
experiments taking an average
of a quarter to complete. Major
topics looked at include social
prediction (subjects are tested
on the accuracy of their predic
tions of other people's behav
ior), self-predictions (subjects
were asked to predict what they
perceived the future to hold for
them), perceptions of bias (a
recently released study dealt
with how parties on both sides
of the issu£ reacted to the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon), psychol
ogy and law (for example, the
reliability of eyewitness tes
timony and the effect that a jury
member's attitude toward the
death penalty could have on his
decision) and decision making.
Michael Mauk, a graduate
student concentrating in physi

ology, does experiments with
rabbits to find what happens in
the nervous system when an
animal thinks and remembers.
Mauk's experiments are exam
ples of "classical conditioning."
The rabbit hears a tone and has
a puff of air blown into its eye a
quarter of a second later,
causing it to blink. Eventually
the rabbit blinks after hearing
the tone without the puff of air.
What Mauk is studying is
what physical changes occur in
the rabbit's brain that cause the
animal to associate the blinking
with the tone.'Some tests that
are conducted to see if any dif
ferences in reactions occur in
clude recording the reactions of
different parts of the brain,
removing part of the animal's
brain and electrically stimulat
ing different areas.
Anthony Ahrens, a graduate
student doing work in the per

sonality division, described an
experiment he did at Northwes
tern University which analyzed
the outlooks of depressed and
non-depressed people. Subjects
were given mood inventories
(questionnaires that gauge
moods) and Intelligence
Quotient (1.Q.) tests and placed
either in the categories of
"depressed" or "non
depressed".
Participants were then given a
common task to perform and
asked to predict how others with
a similar I.Q. would do per
forming the same action.
"Those who were 'non
depressed' said that they would
do better than someone with the
same 1.Q." Ahrens said, while
"depressed " people thought
that they would do as well as or
not as well as those with similar
I.Q.'s.
