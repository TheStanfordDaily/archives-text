# Capitola offers much more than sunny beaches
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
If you've ever been to Half
Moon Bay or Pescadero, in
tending to sunbathe or swim,
you most likely found it too cold
to do either. It seems the only
thing you're assured of at
beaches in Northern California
is coming down with hypother-

mia. But don't despair. You
don't have to go to Los Angeles
to find a warm sandy beach. Just
one hour south of Stanford are a
variety of beaches where one
can sunbathe, surf or swim.
Capitola, only four miles
south of Santa Cruz, has three

beaches and is a stereotypical
beach-front town with lots of
young people, restaurants and
bars and small shops and
galleries in which to wander in
and out.
Capitola prides itself in being

the oldest seaside resort on the
Pacific coast. Its sandy beaches
are well-protected by headlands
and are usually bathed in sun
shine. The area is popular for
swimming as well as volleyball
and volleyball standards and
nets are available.

Besides its beaches, Capitola
is famous for its begonia gar
dens which bloom from June
through November. In Septem
ber there is a Begonia Festival
where boats and floats covered
with thousands of the- flowers
parade downstream towards the

mouth of the bay.
A year-round flower ex
travaganza can be viewed at
Shadowbrook Restaurant. On
the waterfront, large windows
provide customers with a spec
tacular view of the river and
quaint houses on the opposite

shore both by day and in the
evening. You will find the res
taurant a magical experience,
for it delights all of one's senses.
Built a few feet from Soquel
creek, the view of the creek and
the gardens from the windows is
as exquisite as the interior decor
and the food.
After parking on the hill, you
can choose to walk down the
flower-lined path to the restau
rant or to travel in elegance in
the 1958 cable car. Imported
from Germany, the four-person
red cable car safely transports
customers down a 100-degree
slope.
Unless you don't mind
waiting for a table, you need to
make reservations. Even with
reservations, I waited another
half-hour before being seated.
The number to call is (408) 475-
1511.
Besides the main dining room
with a cozy fire burning in the
fireplace, other rooms have
been added so that 200 persons
can be accommodated. Another
dining room is in the wine cellar,
which was built with a glass

canopy, a Victorian-patterned
brick wall and a round fireplace.
When you dine at
Shadowbrook, you begin with
an extensive wine list priced
from $5.95 to $300. Depending
on whether you order appetizers
and desserts, your meal can
become quite expensive, but
Shadowbrook also caters to
those on a limited budget. Din
ners include fresh breads, salad
or Boston clam chowder and
tomato provencal and range in
price from $7.50 for the
vegetarian crepes to $13.95 for
prime rib. When in season
abalone ($15.95) is one of the
house specialties. Nightly spe
cials are also well worth sam
pling; the fresh fish is cooked to
perfection. Whether you order
fresh fish or another entree, and
finish your meal with chocolate
torte or an after-dinner drink,
you'll find that Shadowbrook is
a restaurant you'll long remem
ber and recommend to friends.
When looking for a place to
stay, you can choose from a va
riety of motels and hotels or
camp at New Brighton State
Beach.

From New Brighton State
Beach you have a view of Mon
terey Bay and access to the
shoreline. There are also many
species of wild birds for those
interested in bird-watching.
There are 115 sites available for
day ($2) or overnight ($6) use.
Call (408) 475-4850 for more
information.
Located in the heart of
Capitola Village itself on 210
Esplanade is the Capitola Hotel.
Though many of the other
hotels looked questionable, the
Capitola Hotel is completely
respectable. For $30 per person
or $36-46 per couple, you get a
private bathroom, coffee,
postcards, guaranteed parking,
and you are right in the middle
of everything.
Parking in Capitola is ex
tremely difficult to find, espe
cially on weekends, so the hotel
parking is something for which
to be grateful. To make reserva
tions call (408) 475-6951.
While in Capitola you might
want to walk to the wharf also.
Recently renovated, the wharf
first opened in 1857 as a ship
loading facility for ocean-going

commerce. The wharf has since
evolved into a major recreation
facility popular for fishing, boat
launching and sampling fresh
local seafood at the restaurant
at the end of the pier. The
Wharf, as the restaurant is
called, opens daily at 7 a.m. for
breakfast and serves lunches
and dinners as well. Prices are
reasonable and the food is tasty
home-style cooking.
Breakfast items include a se
lection of omelettes served with
potatoes and a choice of toast
for $3.75-5.50, huge pancakes,
french toast and eggs. For
lunches and dinners, seafood is
the specialty. Depending on
what is available, local fresh fish
is featured daily and includes
shark and swordfish. Dinners
start at $7.95 and go up to
$12.95 for the peppered New
York Steak, one of the non
seafood entrees.
The village really has a lot to
offer so the next time you want
to spend an afternoon or a
weekend at the beach, remem
ber sunny Capitola by the Sea.

Whether you overlook the river or the gardens, or are seated in the wine cellar, you'll find
dining at Shadowbrook Restaurant a memorable experience.
