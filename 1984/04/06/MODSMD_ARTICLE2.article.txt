The Department of Defense (DoD)
proposal to place restrictions on re
search contracts to universities is to
tally unacceptable, Dean of Graduate
Studies and Research Gerald Lieber
man told the Faculty Senate yester
day.
The plan would "put restrictions in
contracts with the University which
would require approval of the Depart
ment of Defense before publication
could occur," Lieberman said. Stan
ford currently receives $25 to $30 mil
lion in DoD funds.
University President Donald Ken
nedy has already signed a letter pro
testing the proposal in conjunction
with the presidents of the California
Institute of Technology and the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology.
Lieberman confirmed the Univer
sity's stand on this issue. ' There is just
no way we would accept contracts that
need approval."
SLAC Prof. Robert Mozley ex
pressed concern over Lieberman's
proposal, which would require a 90-
day negotiation period before publica
tion. Under that plan, negotiations
would take place between the DoD
and researchers over matters of na
tional security.
"It would be like negotiating with a
guy with a gun . .. they are effectively
going to get their way," because the
DoD proposal would make it illegal to
publish "sensitive" results without
DoD approval, Mozley said.
Lieberman predicts that the three
institutions that have already voiced
their concern will not be alone. Due to
time pressures the three presidents did
not solicit other support but there "is
no doubt that other universities on the
committee feel the same way,"
Lieberman said.
The University will stand firm,
Lieberman said.
"Stanford University is bound by its
* research policy and rules ... we will

continue to tell the Department of
Defense that this is not even a matter
up for debate," he concluded.
A matter that is up for debate,
however, is the success of the Univer
sity's affirmative action policies. Three
reports presented to the Faculty Sen
ate yesterday traced the progress of
affirmative action policies over the
past decade for faculty, graduate
studies and research and academic
staff-research.
"Our performance is in general bet
ter than the institutions we compare

ourselves to . .. not substantially, but
a little bit better ... I give us about a
B-minus," Provost Albert Hastorf
summarized.
The University's affirmative action
program focuses on both minority
groups and women. Effective affirma
tive action is necessary at all levels be
cause it is from the undergraduate
pool that graduate affirmative action
applicants are drawn and from the

graduate and research pools that fac
ulty members are drawn, Lieberman
told the senate.
Graduate recruitment is conducted
for minority students in ail programs
and for women in science and engi
neering.
According to the report, the overall
graduate enrollment of Chicano,
native American and Puerto Rican
students here increased slightly for
Fall 1983 while the total enrollment of
black students decreased slightly. The
percentage of total minority graduate
student enrollment in 1983 remained
unchanged from 1982.
The percentage increase for women
enrolled in Law and Medical Sciences
is notable. There was a slightly in
creased enrollment in the Earth
Sciences and the School of Humanities
and Sciences. While the overall enroll
ment of women in science and engi
neering (excluding M.D.s) has
decreased slightly from 1982, the
percentage of women enrolled in all
graduate programs increased by 1 per
cent.
The Faculty Affirmative Action
Report, which includes statistics for
minority and faculty appointments
and for tenure-line positions, shows
slight percentage increases in these
areas over the past year.
During 1983-84, 14 women were
appointed to the faculty and 10 ap
pointed to the tenure line. Three wo
men were given tenured positions â€”
the highest number in the past decade.
There were, however, only four
minority faculty appointments made
in the past year; three of these ap
pointments were to the tenure line, al
though four offers were extended to
minority faculty members who
declined.
The Academic Staff-Research
Report notes some success in respect
to female recruitment but not with
respect to minority men. There was a
