## Cardinal diamondmen attempt to exorcise Sun Devils this weekend 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The Pacific-10 Conference Southern
Division season may be less than half
linished, but it would not be an exag
geration to say that Stanford's three
game series beginning today in Sunken
Diamond against conference leader and
N0.3-ranked Arizona State is a critical
one tor the Cardinal's post-season
playoff hopes.
The Card currently occupies third
place in the six-team division with a 7-5
league mark, 22-15-1 overall, four
games behind the Sun Devils who are
cruising along at 11-1 and 30-10 for the
season. The USC Trojans, recent con
querers of the Cardinal, fall in between
this weekend's combatants with a 10-2
record.
The NCAA grants an automatic bid to
the "Six-Pac" champion and awards the
runner-up an at-large berth to compete
in the national championship tourna
ment that begins in late May. So, Stan
ford must squeeze past one of these two
clubs and the easiest way to move up the
ladder is to beat them in head-to-head
competition.
With only one more crack at USC, the
Card needs to make hay at home where it
has topped the Sun Devils in 10 of the
last 12 meetings. If the current trend in
Pac-10 play continues, a sweep by one
side might be the most likely outcome
this weekend.
"There have been awful lot of sweeps
already this year," admitted Stanford
Head Coach Mark Marquess. "This is a
very unusual year for the league. Nor
mally, it's been really tough to sweep
teams" because the conference has been
very balanced.
All this talk about sweeps is not neces
sarily good news for the Cardinal be

cause the Sun Devils have been the
league's chief sweeper, disposing of
Arizona, UCLA and UC-Berkeley in
three neat contests. In fact, only USC has
blemished Arizona State's record and it
was those same Trojans who homered
their way to a sweep of Stanford last
weekend.
The Sun Devils were the pre-season
pick by the pollsters to capture their sixth
College World Series this year but have
dropped to third in recent weeks.
Marquess questions the latest rankings.
"I don't understand why they would
drop to No. 3 because they have been
playing real well. They're a good solid
team. They've got power, they've got
speed. The big thing is that they've got a
lot of experience coming back," he said.
Let's start with the power, and
Arizona State leads the league in power,
not to mention batting average. Arizona
State has whacked 55 home runs while
hitting .319 as a team and Oddibe
McDowell (.403 , 9 HRs), Todd Brown
(.3HK, 10 HRs ) and Louie Medina (.34X,
9 HRs) are among the leaders in both
categories. Barry Bonds (the son of
former major league all-star outfielder
Bobby Bonds) has also blasted nine
round-trippers.
"If you look at the history of the
league," noted Marquess earlier this
week, "The team that hits the home runs
is the team that wins the league." Again,
that is not good news for the Card. Stan
ford ranks last in homers with 21, and its
pitching corps has recently spoiled good
performances by making one bad pitch.
"If we can't keep the ball in the yard
we're not going to beat them," Marquess
predicted. "We didn't do that against SC
and that's why we lost."
Southpaw Jeff Ballard (4-3) will be as
signed the unenviable task of containing the

Sun Devils in today s opener and
Marquess will send his ace, John Radtke
(6-1, 2.57 earned run average, three
complete games) to the mound tomor
row. Sunday may mark the return of
Brian Myers to the starting rotation after
he missed six weeks of action because of
an injury.
Arizona State counters with a for
midable staff, to say the least. Senior
Kendall Carter (7-0, 2.02 ERA), Doug
Henry (8-1, 55 strike outs. 2.04 ERA),
Jeff Roberts (4-2, 3.07 ERA) and Dave
Graybill (4-0, eight saves, 3.24 ERA) all
stand among the conference pitching
leaders. Henry and Graybill. a sopho
more and junior respectively, both throw
smoke out of the bullpen and have
played a role in 22 of Arizona State's 30
wins this year.
"USC was the best pitching we've
faced overall," said the Stanford pilot in
comparison. "But I'm sure that they're
(the Sun Devils) as capable as USC."
Marquess, however, refuses to throw
in the towel before the fight begins." We
can hit these guys. More than who's
pitching, it's how we're swinging the bat
that counts. If we're swinging the bat
well, we'll score some runs."
Stanford is led by Mike De√üenon
(.357) who is coming off a six-RBI game
against San Jose State, freshman Ruben
Amaro, Jr. (.338) and Rick Lundblade
(.317, 4 HRs), currently fifth in the "Six-
Pac" with 36 RBIs. Lundblade will need
some help this weekend from Mark
Davis who is hitting just .272 after a ban
ner freshman year last season and Darryl
Stephens, the senior outfielder expected
to knock in more than his current total of
20 RBIs to go with his .310 average.
Today's contest begins at 2:30 p.m.
while the weekend games will start at 1
p.m.
