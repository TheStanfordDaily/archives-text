# Tracksters compete here
## 
### PETER CASTILLO 
An Olympic year always
generates excitement in the
track and field world, and this
spirit of excitement can be seen
as some the top athletes in the
world compete at Stanford
Stadium tomorrow.
The Stanford men's squad
will be competing against
Southern California. Washing
ton State and UC-Berkeley. Cal
will also compete against San
Jose State.
The women will face athletes
from Washington State Univer

sity (WSU), Cal and Tennessee
in a non-scoring competition.
The Stanford track team is
coached by Brooks Johnson,
who is also head coach of the
1984 U.S. Olympic women's
track team.
The men's dual meet record is
2-1 and the women's 1-0. This
year the emphasis will not be on
the team's dual meet record, but
rather on qualifying athletes for
the NCAA Championships and,
more importantly, for the U.S.
Olympic trials which begin June
15.
Carol Cady, discus and shot

put, is one the many potential
Olympic qualifiers on the Farm.
Last year at the NCAA Cham
pionships, Cady took second in
the discus and captured the shot
put crown. This year Cady took
fourth at the NCAA Indoor
Championships with a put of 52
feet, 11 inches.
In the distances, PattiSue
Plumer has finished second for
the past two years in the 3000
meter at the NCAA Champion
ships. At the NCAA Indoor this
year Plumer finished third in the
3000 meter.
Ceci Hopp has had a cele
brated career at Stanford, hut
injuries have held her back from
reaching her full potential. In
1982 Hopp finished ahead of
Plumer in the 3000 meter and
took third at the 1982 NCAA
Cross Country Championships.
One of Stanford's more ver
satile runners is Regina Jacobs
as she competes in events raging
from the 800 to 5000 meters.
Jacobs considers the 800 meter
her specialty, but has done well
also in the 1500 meter. She
holds the school record in the
800 meter, 2:04.38, and 1500
meter, 4:12.3.
Consistency has been a major
factor for Jacobs in big meets as
she set the school and NCAA
meet record in the 1500 qualify
ing and then finished last in the
finals. She finished eighth in the
800 at NCAA Indoor.
Alison Wiley, a resident of
Toronto, is almost a shoe-in for
a spot on the Canadian Olympic
squad. Wiley captured the
NCAA crown last year in the
3000 meter. At the World Cross


Russel long/Daily
Cardinal Olympic hopeful Shaun Pickering cannot mask his
talent in the hammer toss behind those shades. The talents of
his teammates will be revealed in tomorrow's meet in the
Stanford Stadium.
Country Championships last
ar Wiley finished second be
hind live-time winner Crete
Wait/ of Norway.
Top rccuits to the Farm in
clude Cory Schubert, who will
compete in the distance events.
Schubert was Northern Califor
nia premiere distance runner
last year and finished 31st at last
fall's cross country champion
ship.
I'ani Board will help shore up
one ol Stanford's weaker spots:
the hurdles. Terri Givens will
give the Cardinal a boost in the
long jump and sprints, other
Cardinal weak spots.
I or the men. Shaun Pickering
is an Olympic hopeful in the
hammer toss. Pickering took
12th at last year's NCAA meet
and sixth at the NCAA indoor
in the 35-pound weight.
The Cardinal strength lies in
the distance events. Charles Al
exander had the year off last

year, but has begun to return to
form since taking a surprising
fourth at last year's Pac-10
Championships in the 10.000
meter and placed 20th at last
fall's District X cross country
meet. Brian Pettingill could be a
force in the Pac-10 if he can
avoid injuries that have plagued
his collegiate career.
Freshman Marc Oleson
promises to be one of the Car
dinal greats as he was a sub-tour
minute miler in high school, and
he did well in the cross country
season.
F red Williams and Doug Vil
laret will compete in the sprints,
and Coach Johnson has added
strength to the team by recruit
ing pole vaulters Mike Uhrham
nier and Jay Vavra.
WSU will bring its strong con
tingent of African long distance
runners who will be bound to
appear in the Olympics. Ten
nessee will bring its usual fine
sprint squad. This will include
Sharifa Barksdale and Benita
Fitzgerald, who are two of na
tion's best.
