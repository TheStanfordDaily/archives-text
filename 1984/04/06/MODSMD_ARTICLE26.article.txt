# Wildcats prowl about Courts

### TOM CLIFFORD 
The Stanford men's tennis teams is tough
ening up. Last week the Cardinal won a
close match against UC-Berkeley and then
demolished UC-Irvine. This weekend the
University of Arizona and Arizona State
will challenge the Cardinal here, followed
by the Universits of Utah on Tuesday.
Stanford's record of 14-2 overall and 3-0
in the Pac-10 indicates that the team is
strong. But Head Coach Dick Gould is not
taking any of the coming matches lightly.
Arizona played Stanford \ery closely when
the two teams met in Arizona last month.
"We were very fortunate for a 3-3 tie after
the singles matches." Ciould said.
One reason tor the Wildcats' strong
singles play is Paul Chamberlain. Chamber
lain iscurrenth fourth in the NCAA singles
rankings. In today's match. Stanford's No. I
player. Danny Goldie (who was out with a
back injury when the two teams met
before), will be matched with Chamberlain.
Gould indicated that the matches tomorrow
will also be a major test for the Cardinal. "If
we can get through next Tuesday with good
play, then I think we're really going to be a
factor."
With important matches coming up next
weekend with UCLA and USC. Stanford is
looking for momentum. "It is important to
generate momentum, and we're just about
ready to make a big jump."

But Gould was careful to point out that
the Card is not looking past Arizona or
Arizona State. Instead, he is hoping to
tighten up weak areas in the team's game,
especially in doubles play.
"(John) Letts and (Jim) Grabb have to be
consistent." he said. "We had a lot of close
matches in Arizona."
Aside from that, Gould is happy with the
teams progress thus far. "Their attitude is
good. I like the way they're thinking right

now.
Winning this weekend will help to con
tinue the netters' positive attitude, but
Gould is more concerned with the style of
play. "II we can go in and win, that's one
thing: but it we win and play well, that's
what's important."
The Cards will take on the Wildcats this
afternoon at I 011 the Varsity Courts, and
then tomorrow the ASU Sun Devils will
come in at 1:30 p.m.
