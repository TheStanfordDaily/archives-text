# Spikers set up for Long Beach tonight
## 
### TRASK LEONARD 
Coming off a loss to No. 2-ranked USC on Wednesday
night, the men spikers continue their difficult conference
schedule tonight against the No. 4-ranked 4S)ers from Cal
State Long Beach at 7:30 p.m. in Maples.
Tl}e Cardinal, at 12-12 overall and 5-9 in the California In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association (CIVA), laces a talented
team in Long Beach. The 49ers are currently in fourth place
in a top-notch conference, which contains se\en of the top 10
teams in the nation. They are particularly known for their
outstanding middle blockers, most notably Greg Maxwell.
If Stanford can win its remaining five CIVA contests, it has
a remote chance at the playoffs, according to Assistant Coach
Don Shaw.
"We have to get past some awfully tough teams on the way
to the playoffs, if we have a chance to go at all." said Shaw.
"Our team is still young, and we are at a crossroads in the
program. To expect this team to go to the playoffs this year is
almost unreasonable, although we certainly have the talent to
do so."
The volleyball program has come a long way the last few
years. Currently, the team has a total of 12 wins, the best
mark in the last three years.
