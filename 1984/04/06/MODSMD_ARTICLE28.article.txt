# Netwomen fight Trojans
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Forget about the 9-0 and S-l
blowouts. Forget about the
straight set. two-and-love wins
in the top singles positions. For
get about clinching matches
betore the tans have found their
seats. This is the big time, folks.
The Stanford women's tennis
team is looking a very tough
challenge in the face — USC in
Los Angeles.
Southern Cal in 1..A. Let's
explain that one. The Trojans
have won 8N in a row at home,
and currently have come out on
top in 94 of their last 95.
They're one of the top teams in
the country wherever they play,
and in Head Coach Frank Bren
nan s live seasons on the F arm
the Card has yet to win on the
Trojan's home court.
Brennan knows this as well as
anyone. "The big thing is that
we're playing them at home,"
he said. "They're almost un

beatable at home."
The Cardinal should be confi
dent going in. though. The net
ters are No. 1 in the nation, they
have beaten top 10-teams in
UCLA. San Diego State and
UC-Berkeley, and they are un
defeated this year at 14-0.
The Card barely got by
UCLA, however, having gained
a tough 5-4 decision over the
Bruins. Brennan said. "1 think
USC is better than UCLA." We
are not talking pushover here.
The Trojans will likely go
with Kelly Henry at first singles.
Henry, a senior, has been
ranked in the top five for all of
her four years at USC. Getting
the nod for Stanford will be
freshman Patty Fendick. A
tough initiation for a freshman,
but Fendick has shown she can
more than hold her own against
top players, and is herself
ranked No. 3 in the nation.
Other top players to look out
for are Cecila Fernandez and

Heliane Steden. Very likely
they will face Stanford's Linda
Gates and Kate Gompert at
second and third singles.
The injury situation is shaping
up for the Card. Leigh Anne
Eldredge seems to be recovered
from the tin and will likely go at
No. 4 for Stanford. Michelle
Weiss and Stephanie Savides
will round out . the lineup, but
top backup Alyce Werdel has
been ill. which will hurt the Car
dinal's depth.
The road doesn't get any
easier for the netters. Monday
they will move down the coast
to San Diego State, a team they
beat 6-3 on the Farm March 12.
but several of those matches
were very close. The Aztecs are
another top 10-team. which
prompted Brennan to say. "By
the time this weekend is over,
we'll know a lot more about this
team."
