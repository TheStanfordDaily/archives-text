If you want to forget you live
in California for a night you
need go no further than Califor
nia Avenue. Des Alpes, a res
taurant that seems well broken
in, offers a variety of European
foods that will please almost any
palate.
Upon entering we were
seated by a jovial waiter at a
simply appointed table in a
simply decorated room. Des
Alpes is a no nonsense restau
rant where good food is obvi
ously the primary objective.
Looking at the customers and
waiters it seemed that everyone
was in familiar surroundings.
The reason for this must lie in
the fact that the restaurant has
been in the same location with
the same owner for 11 years.
For the first 10 of those years
the owner was also the chef, but
he now shares his time with
Magnolia's restaurant which he
recently opened. The "new"
chef had worked under him for
10 years so you shouldn't face
too many surprises if you've
dined at Des Alpes before.
Although the menu didn't ap
pear lengthy at first, Des Alpes
offers a variety of unprinted
specials.. The specials vary

depending on the type of fresh
fish available and perhaps the
mood of the chef. On the regu
lar menu they had choices like
Beef Roulade ($8.50) and a
Swiss Bratwurst ($7.50), both
served with red cabbage.
Though red cabbage is not the
ordinary vegetable served at
most restaurants, it's worth
trying, even if it's to ascertain
that you prefer the "regular"
vegetable included with the
other meals. The red cabbage
here is delicious, being that it
has the right balance of sweet
and sour flavors.
The entrees also included two
chicken dishes, one served with
a sauce of artichoke hearts, ripe
olives, tomatoes, onions, mush
rooms and green peppers
($8.50) and the other stuffed
with pate, breaded and deep
fried ($8.95). Less adventurous
members in your party may
want to order one of the two
steak dinners served ($8.95 and
$10.95).
After questioning our waiter
he graciously offered to select
our wine for us. His choice, a
slightly sweet Riesling was su
perb. The wine list was quite ex
tensive and very reasonably
priced. One wall of the restau
rant shelves many bottles and
adds a nice touch of atmo
sphere.
Dinner began with a basket of

bread followed by a fresh gar
den salad, both included in the
price of the meal. We ordered a
variety of dishes so we could
sample each other's food and we
were quite pleased with our se
lections. Dinner also included
fresh zucchini and one could get
a side order of soup ($1.50),
salad(s 1.50), or another
vegetable (85 cents).
* Des Alpes is definitely not the
place to go if you're looking for
a quick, light dinner. The
courses were spaced and we
were never hurried as you often
are in small restaurants when
they are trying to get as many
people through as possible.
For dessert a variety of ice

cream choices were included
with the meal, but we decided,
instead, to sample the
homemade apple and spice cake
and the amarretto cheesecake.
Upon tasting the cheesecake we
were all quite envious of our
companion's selection. It was
light and fluffy, but very rich.

And if amaretto isn't your style,
they also had a cherry
blueberry, black forest and even
plain cheesecake.
Though the restaurant isn't a
decorator's dream, the clientele
and hustle and bustle of activity
create a unique atmosphere and
the food leaves nothing to be
desired. Good food and
moderate prices might make
you one of the regulars at Des
Alpes someday.
