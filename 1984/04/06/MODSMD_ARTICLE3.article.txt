# Assault suspect King faces hearing today
## 
### 
The Stanford graduate accused of
assaulting two men with a tennis rac
quet near Tresidder Union and then
threatening police with a knife Tues
day will undergo a preliminary hearing
today in Palo Alto.
Kevin King. 37, will face two mis
demeanor charges of assault, one
felony count of carrying a concealed
weapon and another felony charge of
using a deadly weapon with the intent
to resist arrest in a hearing in Palo
Alto Municipal Court Dept. 32 today.
At today's preliminary hearing, the
district attorney may present evidence
that the crimes did indeed occur and
that a strong suspicion exists that King
is guilty of those crimes.

King allegedly attacked two men,
Charles Nines, 37, and Jose Oropeza,
82, with a tennis racquet in front of
Tresidder and then threatened two
police officers with a knife in the
Bookstore before they arrested him
Tuesday morning.
King was still in custody at the
North County Jail last night, with bail
set at $4000.
Nines, a junior high school
schoolmate of King's, told The Daily
Wednesday that King had harassed
him before and had accused him of
conspiring with former Oakland
Raiders Coach John Madden to "get"
King.
