If you take a wrong turn as
you stumble out of the Dutch
Goose, you just might find
yourself in front of a quaint little
restaurant called the Flea Street
Cafe. Inside, you won't find any
peanut shells or obnoxious col
lege students. But you will find a
nice place for a romantic dinner
for two or a delicious lunch
hour meal.
While deciding whether to try
this restaurant you might think
about this. If you are 22 and
have consumed three meals a
day, you have consumed about
24,090 meals. After this num
ber of times at the table, eating
may be getting a bit dull ... no
more mystery and no surprises.

You better make
sure your lunch
hour can last
over an hour.

Flea Street Cafe ean add the old
thrill of trying something for the
first time with its unique dishes
and new seasonings.
The price of this service is not
cheap, so we decided to try it for
lunch which is considerably less
expensive. At 12:30 p.m. when
we arrived, the restaurant was
full and we waited 20 minutes at
the small bar before being
seated. The wait combined with

leisurely service made it difficult
to make a 2:15 p.m. class so you
better make sure your lunch
hour can last over an hour.
The Flea Street Cafe's pri
mary attraction is certainly its
refreshing fare. The lunch menu
we selected from included an in
novative combinations of
chicken, seafood and vegetables
such as zucchini pancakes, snap
per salad, and chicken chutney.
We selected the fish of the day
— grilled Hawaiian shark with
asparagus and potatoes — and
the pasta of the day — handcut
noodles with English sausage,
snow peas and cream sauce.
Both meals came with a small
vinegary salad and a colorful
fresh orchid garnishing the dish.

The large portion of shark
was tender and white, with a
pleasing almost chicken-like
taste. It was lightly breaded,
grilled, and finished in herb but
ter. The herb butter added just
the right additional flavor to
complement the fish. The dish
came with asparagus, which was
not overcooked a bit and fried
potatoes served with sour
cream. The meal would
definitely eliminate the need for
much dinner that day.
While fresh pasta is not espe

cially uncommon recently, the
snow peas and English sausage
gave this dish a different texture
and spicy taste. The pasta was a
daily special but the dinner
menu otters pasta choices with
smoked salmon and apples and
another with wild rice, mush
rooms. chili peppers and feta
cheese, so it seems pretty likely
that you will be able to expand
your pasta horizons with most
visits to this restaurant.
I he chef uses spices and fresh
herbs such as basil, tarragon, dill

and nasturtium leaves with
abandon. Notes on the menu
boast that vegetables are
"organic" when possible. (Have
you ever heard of an inorganic
vegetable?) The ingredients are
" preservative and chemical
tree" and special dinners are
also available on request for
vegetarians.
Selections from the dinner
menu were much the same as
the lunch menu. But while din
ner might run about $20 per
person, we got out of there with

a $15 lunch bill for two.
With the decor, like with the
food, the attention to detail is
what makes Flea Street Cafe
stand out from other restau
rants. Flowery wallpaper, lots of
plants and a bouquet of fresh
flowers on every table add the
color while dark woods and
paintings add a homey touch.
The restaurant also offers a
wide variety of select wines and
imported beer. We were im
pressed by the London Real Ale
on draught and ordered a glass.

but were a hit less impressed
after learning that it was hrewed
hy the Palo Alto Brewing Com
pany. The wine list otters a
number of wines by the glass.
The restaurant bakes its own
biscuits, which come with most
meals, bread and desserts. If
you have ever eaten at Late for
the Train, another restaurant in
Menlo Park, you may have
tasted similar fare because Bob
and Jesse Cool own both restau
rants.

The owner was eager to in
form us that he would welcome
more Stanford students tor
breakfast. Selections on the
breakfast menu subtitled "for
lovers and leisurely people'
range from the proverbial two
eggs to trench toast made with
Grand Marnier. The breakfast
menu looks appealing, but is
only served Tuesday through
Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 11
a.m. so don't head to Flea Street
for Sunday brunch.

Flea Street Cafe

If you take a wrong turn as
you stumble out of the Dutch
Goose, you just might find
yourself in front of a quaint little
restaurant called the Flea Street
Cafe. Inside, you won't find any
peanut shells or obnoxious col
lege students. But you will find a
nice place for a romantic dinner
for two or a delicious lunch
hour meal.
While deciding whether to try
this restaurant you might think
about this. If you are 22 and
have consumed three meals a
day, you have consumed about
24,090 meals. After this num
ber of times at the table, eating
may be getting a bit dull ... no
more mystery and no surprises.

You better make
sure your lunch
hour can last
over an hour.

Flea Street Cafe ean add the old
thrill of trying something for the
first time with its unique dishes
and new seasonings.
The price of this service is not
cheap, so we decided to try it for
lunch which is considerably less
expensive. At 12:30 p.m. when
we arrived, the restaurant was
full and we waited 20 minutes at
the small bar before being
seated. The wait combined with

leisurely service made it difficult
to make a 2:15 p.m. class so you
better make sure your lunch
hour can last over an hour.
The Flea Street Cafe's pri
mary attraction is certainly its
refreshing fare. The lunch menu
we selected from included an in
novative combinations of
chicken, seafood and vegetables
such as zucchini pancakes, snap
per salad, and chicken chutney.
We selected the fish of the day
— grilled Hawaiian shark with
asparagus and potatoes — and
the pasta of the day — handcut
noodles with English sausage,
snow peas and cream sauce.
Both meals came with a small
vinegary salad and a colorful
fresh orchid garnishing the dish.

The large portion of shark
was tender and white, with a
pleasing almost chicken-like
taste. It was lightly breaded,
grilled, and finished in herb but
ter. The herb butter added just
the right additional flavor to
complement the fish. The dish
came with asparagus, which was
not overcooked a bit and fried
potatoes served with sour
cream. The meal would
definitely eliminate the need for
much dinner that day.
While fresh pasta is not espe

cially uncommon recently, the
snow peas and English sausage
gave this dish a different texture
and spicy taste. The pasta was a
daily special but the dinner
menu otters pasta choices with
smoked salmon and apples and
another with wild rice, mush
rooms. chili peppers and feta
cheese, so it seems pretty likely
that you will be able to expand
your pasta horizons with most
visits to this restaurant.
I he chef uses spices and fresh
herbs such as basil, tarragon, dill

and nasturtium leaves with
abandon. Notes on the menu
boast that vegetables are
"organic" when possible. (Have
you ever heard of an inorganic
vegetable?) The ingredients are
" preservative and chemical
tree" and special dinners are
also available on request for
vegetarians.
Selections from the dinner
menu were much the same as
the lunch menu. But while din
ner might run about $20 per
person, we got out of there with

a $15 lunch bill for two.
With the decor, like with the
food, the attention to detail is
what makes Flea Street Cafe
stand out from other restau
rants. Flowery wallpaper, lots of
plants and a bouquet of fresh
flowers on every table add the
color while dark woods and
paintings add a homey touch.
The restaurant also offers a
wide variety of select wines and
imported beer. We were im
pressed by the London Real Ale
