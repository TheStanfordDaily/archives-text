Smiles of a Summer Night
(1955)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman has never
made a better picturc than this
complex sexual farce, which sug
gests a Viennese operetta as
Shakespeare might have written
it. The players are a middle-aged
lawyer (Gunnar Bjornstrand);
his wife (Ulla Jacobsson), still a
virgin; his one-time mistress, an
actress (Eva Dahlbeck); her
egocentric lover (Karl Julie); his
proud, melancholy wife (Margit
Carlquist); the carnal, ebullient
maid (Harriet Andersson) —
and, in the background, the
actress' aging mother (Naima
Wifstrand). TTiis movie inspired
the marvelous Stephen Son
dehim musical A Little Night
Music, but there's nothing like
the original.
Plays Thursday with Wild
Strawberries.
Body Heat (1981)
Kresge Auditorium
The hero and heroine of this
misbegotten imitation of a James
Cain thriller, played by William
Hurt and Kathleen Turner (who
later parodied this performance
in The Man with Two Brains),
talk like refugees from a 1940s
film noir, but no one else in the
movie seems to find it odd. Per
haps the heat, both real and
sexual, has addled everyone's
brain — especially writer
. director Lawrence Kasdan's.
Lest you miss the point, he puts
some red-hot thing — the sun, or
a flaming cigarette — in almost
every shot. This idiotic broiled
melodrama satisfied a surpris
ingly large number of
moviegoers, though the only
sparks of life in it are the perfor
mances of Mickey Rourke (as an
arsonist) and Ted Danson as
Hurt's partner. Richard Crenna
plays Turner's dullish husband.
Plays tonight at 9.
Being There (1979)
Cubberley Auditorium
This movie, adapted by Jerzy
Kosinski from his own novel and
directed by Hal Ashby. is like
one of those British comedies
from the 1950s that expanded
on one particularly clever joke.
Peter Sellers gives a wonderful
performance as Chance, a men
tally deficient middle-aged man
who has never learned to read or
write and is taken as a genius by
practically everybody. At times
the picture seems too reserved
— almost somber — and the
handsome production (shot by
Caleb Deschanel) is a little over
blown and drawn out; but the
cast underplays skillfully, and
the film.iSk very,entertaining.
With Shirley MacLaine, Melvyn
Douglas, Jack Warden, Richard
Basehart and Dave Clennon.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.

Risky Business (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
This teen comedy, written and
directed by Paul Brickman, has
its own style and, in the
nighttime exteriors, an eerily
erotic dream landscape.
(Reynaldo Villalobos and Bruce
Surtees share credit for the pho
tography.) Brickman
demonstrates wit in a few silent
sequences, and there's a won
derful scene in which his hero,
Joel (played by a winning ail-
American suburban type named
Tom Cruise), free from the con
straints imposed on him by his
parents, who are now on vaca
tion, dances around the living
room in his underwear, miming
the words to a Bob Seger song.
But this film about a high school
senior who somehow winds up
managing a whorehouse in his
parents' home is indifferently
written and — except for Cruise
— flatly acted. Furthermore, the
way in which it is pointed
squarely at the wish fulfillment
fantasies of its adolescent
audiences is a little dispiriting.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
The Bicycle Thief (1948)
Cubberley Auditorium
Vittorio De Sica's fable about
a man driven to stealing in the
poverty-stricken Rome of the
post-World War II epoch ap
pears on every list of all-time
great movies. Like the two other
neo-realist masterpieces De Sica
made with screenwriter Cesare
Zavattini, Shoeshine and
Umberto D, this movie touches
one so intimately that it is almost
an invasion of privacy; it is
shocking, shattering and finally
exhilarating. De Sica takes us to
the deepest reaches of despair
and out the other side. With
Lamberto Maggiorani, Lianella
Carelli and Enzo Staioia.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Battle of Algiers (1966)
Adelfa Lounge, Lagunita;
Madera Lounge, Wilbur
The director, Gillo Pon
tecorvo, is the most impassioned
revolutionary in cinema since
Eisenstein, and The Battle of Al
giers, which focuses on the activ
ities of the Algerian National
Liberation Front in the 19505,
isn't merely a movie; it's a
mqjoi/esto. Oppressed bv French
' heroes become guerrillas, and in
one horrifying sequence a small
group of women plant a bomb
that they know will blow up in

nocent people. In the movie's
terms, they have no choice —
and because Pontecorvo is such
a devastatingly brilliant
filmmaker, you find yourself
swept up in the logic espoused
by the screenplay he wrote with
Franco Solinas. It's certainly
propaganda; it's also certainly a
masterpiece; and the combina
tion results in one of the few film
experiences that disturbs you in
a way that you can't master.
Photography by Marcello Gatti;
music by Ennio Morricone and
Pontecorvo.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30
(Adelfa) and Tuesday evening at
6:30 (Madera).
The Man Who Would Be
King(l97s)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Huston and Gladys Hill
adapted Rudyard Kipling's su
perb short story, omitting many
of its ambiguities and neutraliz
ing its controversial political
content, but it's a handsome,
highly entertaining movie none
theless, and it contains what is
likely Huston's best sustained di
rection since the early 1950s
(though his work in between was
often fascinating). In a triumph
of casting, Michael Caine plays
the con man adventurer who sets
out to become rich in a mountain
area of India, and Sean Connery
plays his less swift pal, whose
role in the scheme is to become
king of the local tribe. At first
Connery, with his dark, bewhis
kered balloon face, seems too
big, physically and vocally, for
his role, but as the film proceeds
he finds uses for his frame and
his deep, resonant voice: He
takes on the look and sound of a
king. Christopher Plummer is
stuck playing Kipling.
Plays tomorrow with
Lawrence of Arabia.
Scenes from a Marriage
(1974)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman originally
wrote and directed this anatomy
of a rotting marriage in several
segments for Swedish television;
cut to a reasonable feature
length, it was released theatrical
ly and won great acclaim. But it's
not a likable picture. Here we
have Bergman in his
Jifeo suflUhat
heTgot hold of Hie Truth that
he insists on shoving it at us —
and so most of it comes off as
psychodrama rather than drama.
In his (ludicrous) 1973

melodrama for American TV,
The Lie, Bergman had George
Segal slap Shirley Knight across
the face in close-up, and some of
us retaliated by switching off our
sets; almost all ot Scenes from a
Marriage is like that slap. With
impressive, intelligent, un
pleasant performances by Liv
Ullmann and Erland Josephson
and a small, brilliant one by Bibi
Andersson.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Autumn Sonata.
Return of the Seeaucus Seven
(1980)
Bijou, Palo Alto
John Sayles, relying mostly on
funds he earned by writing
screenplays for Roger Corman,
made this picture (which he
wrote, produced, directed,
edited and plays a supporting
* role in) for $60,000, and it looks
like a home movie — but it is
wonderful. The characters are a

group of friends who experi
enced the '60s together and now,
at 30 or thereabouts, are con
fronting crises. Sayles writes
crinkly, soft-edged, funny lines
that catch not only the turn of
phrase of individuals but their
speech rhythms as well as the
tensions that direct those
rhythms. The cast is made up
largely of Sayles' friends, several
of whom were his classmates at
Williams College; as actors they
are a highly variable lot, but they
communicate such a strong bond
that we see more in the ways in
which they relate to each other
than we might see in a highly
trained ensemble. The best of
them are Mike Arnott, Jean Pas
sanante, Gordon Clapp, Maggie
Renzi and Sayles himself.
Plays today with Lianna.

The Wizard of Oz (1939)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Victor Fleming and a trio of
writers (Noel Langley, Florence
Ryerson, Edgar Alien Woolf)
turned L. Frank Baum's beloved
children's story into one of
Hollywood's few great musical
fantasies. It triumphs precisely
because it is such a squarely
American movie — its heart lies
in the vaudeville/Broadway
revue roots of two of its stars,
Bert Lahr (The Cowardly Lion)
and that incomparable comic
dancer Ray Bolger (The
Scarecrow). Judy Garland, then
a pudgy, earnest teenager, sings
the Harold Arlen-E.Y. Harburg
songs so sweetly that the most
obstinate hearts crack and melt.
Everyone can recite the cast by
heart: Jack Haley as The Tin
Man, Billie Burke as Glinda the
Good Witch of the North, Clara
Blandick and Charley Grapewin
as Auntie Em and Uncle Henry,

and — memorably — Frank
Morgan as The Wizard and Mar
garet Hamilton as The Wicked
Witch of the West. Bobby Con
nelly staged the numbers,
Harold Rosson photographed,
and Cedric Gibbons and William
A. Horning supervised the art
direction.
Plays tomorrow with My Fa
vorite Year.
The Year of Living Dan
gerously (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Set in Indonesia in 1965, in
the last gasps of President
Sukarno's regime. Peter Weir's
film is richly, vividly enjoyable;
it has a sensuousness that was
missing from his last picture,
Gattipoli, and Linda Hunt's
amazing portrayal of Billy
Kwan, a Chincse-American
photographer, gives it an emo
tional center. Without her, it
wouldn't have one; Weir has
made a cinematic guess at what a
Conrad novel might be like with
out philosophy, without convic
tion. It's as if he had assimilated
all the old movies he'd ever seen
with daring journalist heroes and
setting revolutions and feverish
romances in unlikely settings
and compressed them into one
super-deluxe entertainment.
What he has added is his own
seductive elusiveness — his sug
gestion that there is more inside
his movie than meets the eye,
when in fact there is a great deal
less. It's a hell of a movie,
though. Starring Mel Gibson and
Sigourney Weaver; written by
Weir, David Williamson and
C.J. Koch; shot by that wizard,
Russell Boyd.
Plays Tuesday with Boat
People.
Casablanca (1943)
Festival, Palo Alto
In some theaters, when this
movie is shown, audiences bring
wine to toast the "Marseillaise"
scene and everyone knows all the
famous lines, from"I stick my
head out for nobody" to "Louis,
this could be the start of a beau
tiful friendship." Humphrey
Bogart, at his most romantic,
plays Rick, who owns a cafe in
wartime Casablanca; Ingrid
Bergman, at her most beautiful,
is Ilse, who deserted him in Paris
and now walks into his club with
Paul Henreid, who plays Victor
Lazlo — the Resistance leader
the Nazis can't stop. Dooley
Wilson, Peter Lorre and Sydney
Greenstreet are in it, and so is
"As Time Goes By;" it won the
Academy Award for Best
Picture. Of course, nobody real
ly believes a word of it, but who
cares? It is one of the most won
derfully jippealirig bad movies*
ever to come out of Hollywood.
Michael Curtiz directed; the
script is by Howard Koch.
Plays through Wednesday
with For Whom the Bell Tolls.
