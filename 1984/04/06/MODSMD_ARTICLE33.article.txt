### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
The United States needs to push
ahead with new semiconductor re
search to maintain its technological
edge over Japan, the president of a
billion-dollar Silicon Valley firm said
here yesterday.
Andrew Grove, president and co
founder of Intel Corporation, told a
Bishop Auditorium audience of about
175 that "there's an insatiable
demand for integrated components."
The Santa Clara-based firm spe
cializes in semiconductor technology.
Grove said he believes in "process
oriented management." All of Intel's

efforts are linked, forming a family of
products and strengthening the entire
line of Intel products. He compared
Intel's policy of linking all of its prod
ucts to that of companies that develop
only one or two products, calling these
companies "events."
Along with hard work and innova
tion. luck is an important factor in suc
cess, Grove said. "You have to do
something with it when it comes your
way."
When asked to speak at a confer
ence for executives that would be held
at Stanford over the summer. Grove
declined. "I like to talk to students .. .
but people in business, not really."
