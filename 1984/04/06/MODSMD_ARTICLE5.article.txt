# Law students organize 'Students against Reagan' action group
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Five first-year law students have established an official
political action committee here. Students Against
Reaganism (STAR-PAC). to oppose the public policies of
President Reagan and right-wing ideologues throughout
the nation.
"I really can't sit back and watch Reagan win." co
chairperson Steve Silverman told students at an informa
tional meeting Wednesday night.
"What we want to do is create ripples throughout the
country." he said. "It's so obvious how important Stanford
is to the rest of the world .... In forming the committee
here, we hope to wage a symbolic fight against
Reaganism."
Co-chairperson Ted Lempert discussed the significance
of STAR-PAC as a means of demonstrating that "not all
Stanford students are apathetic and apolitical" and that
"students can have power, can have influence in politics."
"We're out to combat (Stanford's) conservative image."
he said.

Lempert said STAR-PAC hopes "to get between 1000
and 2000 people to participate (in its programs) in some

small way and to raise tunds "from around
the Bay Area and even the state" before the

November elections.
STAR-PAC is beginning its drive by
requesting $10 from each of its mem-

bers.
A similar committee formed at
Yale University and mentioned in
The Daily's Campus Compen
dium feature about two months ago

c
gave rise to the idea here, according
to Silverman. The Yale group hai

gained much support already, not only
from students but also from such notables

as Julian Bond and Sargent Shriver. It has
set as its fund-raising goal the large sum of
$100,000.

But Silverman said STAR-PAC does not wish to ally
with the Yale activists, chiefly because "they want the

funds that we raise." Instead, the group here plans to use
its money where it deems best, such as in state campaigns.

"where $3000 can make the difference," Sil
verman said.

"The congressional elections will have a

great effect on checking Reagan's policies
v if he is re-elected," Lempert said.

"People will stand up to him in
Congress."

Lempert said STAR-PAC will
not endorse a Democratic can-

didate in the primaries "because
we want to get as many people as

possible involved and feel that choos
ing one candidate might split us and

turn people away."
STAR-PAC wants to build a strong

membership base and to ally with groups
sharing similar ideologies, Lempert said.

Running registration for the Public Policy Conference
this weekend and co-sponsoring a "Dump-Reagan"

caucus at the conference tomorrow night are methods the
political committee hopes will propagate ideas and gain
new support.
Undergraduate coordinator Tom Be 11 in presented
prospective members Wednesday with the committee's
broad platform, which includes domestic social welfare,
foreign policy, civil and womens' rights and environmental
issues. He cited the Reagan administration's Lebanon
"fiasco" and extensive leasing of federal lands for oil ex
ploration as major failures resulting from the conservative
president's ideology.
STAR-PAC flyers explain why the committee desires to
reverse current "regressive public policies" and how it in
tends to do so.
"We will oppose the politics of Reaganism by contribu
ting to candidates who believe that government can play a
positive role in promoting a more fair and just society;
who seek to complete this nation's march toward full civil
rights for all Americans; and who recognize the world's
