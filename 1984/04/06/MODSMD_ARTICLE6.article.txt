Reagan to blame, O'Neill says

Washington — House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.) used tough language yesterday to respond to President
Reagan's charge that Congress shares the blame for U.S.
reversals in Lebanon, saying Reagan "is responsible for the
deaths of the Marines over there . . . and no one else."
Reagan made his charge in a nationally televised news con
ference Wednesday night. O'Neill replied yesterday morning,
saying, "He knows he has responsibility in his heart for the
failure over there . .. they were wrong every bit of the way."
O'Neill said that Reagan "acted against the wishes of our
top military in this country, and now he is looking for a
scapegoat." The president is having "qualms of conscience,"
O'Neill said.
Reagan said in his news conference that the United States
lost some credibility following the withdrawal of Marines
trom Beirut and that Congress "must take a responsibility"
because the "raging" debate on Capitol Hill served to
"stimulate the terrorists and urge them on." The debate had
rendered the Marines' mission "ineffective," the president
said.
The speaker originally supported Reagan's policy in
Lebanon, backing a war powers resolution authorizing U.S.
forces to remain there for I 8 months. The Democratic leader
was criticized by members of his party for supporting Reagan
at the time.

France offers to clear mines
from Nicaraguan waters

Managua, Nicaragua — The French government has of
fered to help Nicaragua clear its ports of mines if "one or
several friendly European powers" are willing to cooperate.
In a letter addressed to Colombian President Belisario
Betancur and made public here yesterday, French Foreign
Minister Claude Cheysson said France's participation in a
mine-clearing operation "would, of course, have a purely
humanitarian character."
In the same letter, Cheysson asked if Betancur would be
willing to "solemnly and publicly denounce ... the attempt
against the common law that ... the blockade against a
country constitutes?"
Nicaragua has charged the United States — which supports
the antigovernment rebels claiming to have laid the mines —
with direct responsibility for the action and has described it as
part of a general economic blockade. Five foreign ships have
been damaged by mines so far, including a Soviet tanker and
a Japanese freighter.

Soviets call Reagan plan a trick

Moscow — The official Soviet news agency Tass dismissed
yesterday President Reagan's call for a worldwide ban on
chemical weapons as a "propaganda trick" deliberately
rigged with unacceptable conditions.
Despite repeated Soviet statements over the past two years
that Moscow was prepared to negotiate a total ban on chemi
cal weapons — and might even consent to a limited form of
on-site inspection to verify compliance — the initial Soviet re
action appeared to leave little or no opening for accepting the
U.S. proposal.
President Reagan "made it perfectly clear that Washing
ton's "new initiative' is nothing short of a propaganda trick,"
the new s agency; reflecting an authoritative government
view.
"Reagan made it clear that the administration is actually
going to block any agreement in this field by making patently
unacceptable conditions for 'verification' and
'enforcement,' " a Tass report from Washington said.
A Tass commentary issued in Moscow took an identical
line, alleging that the United States intends to use the pro
posed ban as a cover for proceeding with production of new
American chemical weapons.

Britain may leave UNESCO

Paris — Britain has threatened to withdraw from the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organi
zation (UNESCO) if urgent reforms are not made.
In a copy of a letter released to the press here yesterday,
British Minister of State for Overseas Development Timothy
Raison called on UNESCO Secretary General Amadou Mah
tar M'Bow to adopt reforms in the organization's administra
tion and to cut costs.
The letter, dated April 2, also criticizes the politization of
UNESCO, which Raison said was contrary to the principles
adopted by the organization at its establishment in London 40
years ago.
He said the organization must concentrate itself more on its
primary objectives — education, science and culture — and
place less emphasis on peace and disarmament as these topics
come the responsibilities of the United Nations head office in
New York.
The United States had earlier announced that it would
withdraw from the organization by Dec. 31, 1984. It named
similar reasons for its withdrawal.

Nixon speaks on Watergate

Washington — Former President Nixon, in an unusually
candid interview for which CBS Television reportedly paid
$500,000, says his handling of the Watergate scandal was
"stupidity at its very highest" and transformed a break-in into
"the crime of the century."
Looking back on the scandal that forced him from office a
decade ago, Nixon said he would have destroyed the tape
recordings of Oval Office conversations that linked him and
aides to the Watergate cover-up except that he got "bad ad
vice from well-intentioned lawyers."
Nixon said that the lawyers had "sort of the cockeyed no
tion that I would be destroying evidence." But at the time, he
said, the tapes had not been subpoenaed and"the best
evidence were the individuals themselves who were there."
In the interview, which CBS will broadcast in two parts (on
"60 Minutes" Sunday night and on "American Parade"
Tuesday night), Nixon also described his final, agonizing days
in office and his frantic efforts to avoid impeachment, includ
ing a secret plea for help to Alabama Gov. George Wallace.
The former president was interviewed for 38 hours by
Frank Gannon, a longtime associate and former White House
fellow who worked with him on his books. CBS had access to
all 38 hours of conversation and purchased the broadcast
rights to 10 hours. The network released a transcript of the
interview yesterday.
