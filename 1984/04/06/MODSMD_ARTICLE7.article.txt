# House approves deficit reduction plan
## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Washington — The Democratic
controlled Mouse yesterday approved a
"pay-as-you-go" plan to reduce deficits
by $182 billion over the next three years,
nearly double the deficit-cutting pro
posed by President Reagan in his State of
the Union address two months ago.
In the first action to reduce deficits this
year by either house, the House voted
250- 168 to approve a plan drafted by its
Democratic leadership after rejecting.
311-107, a $205 billion alternative
sponsored by House Republican leaders.
Both plans proposed tax increases of
roughly $50 billion through 1987, but
the Democratic proposal, when
compared with the House GOP plan,
would cut about twice as much from
defense and one-sixth as much from
domestic spending.

Under the label of "pay-as-you-go."
which was touted by Democrats as a
symbol of fiscal responsibility and
derided by Republicans as gimmickry,
the Democratic plan also would earmark
the tax increase to finance defense and
social welfare spending that exceeds the
rate of inflation.
The House action came as the
Republican-controlled Senate agreed by
a vote of 67-26 to an $8.2 billion deficit
reduction plan approved last year by the
House that among other things would
defer cost-of-living increases for federal
retirees from June to January .
The Senate also has before it a $150
billion deficit-reduction plan its leaders
worked out with the White House last
month. It had planned to act on the
smaller measure in connection with this
larger one, but for technical reasons had

to move faster or forfeit the cost-ot
living savings.
The Senate-passed bill, which now
goes to the White House, also would give
federal workers a 4 percent pay raise this
year instead of the 3.5 percent raise that
took effect last January .
The extra pay raises would be small,
such as $62 a year for GS-4s and $214
for CiS-14s. according to the Office of
Personnel Management. But they would
be retroactive to January, meaning a
lump-sum payment covering several
months sometime this spring or summer,
according to the Senate Budget Commit
tee.
The Senate also appeared to have bro
ken one logjam over consideration of its
deficit-reduction package as the Repub
lican leadership agreed to a procedure
that would at least partially satisfy Dem

ocratic objections to shortcut methods
for handling the issue.
It was not clear last night whether
GOP leaders could achieve their goal of
passing their own deficit-reduction pack
age next week. befo-e Congress" sched
uled 10-day Easter recess.
But the relatively swift, smooth House
action increases chances for congres
sional action to reduce deficits in this
election year, although hurdles remain
and deficits would remain high: an esti
mated $530 billion over the next three
years, including a deficit of $175.N bil
lion next year.
What the House passed yesterday was
a $*■> 15.5 billion budget resolution for
next year, including a blueprint for $ IS2
billion in deficit reductions through fiscal
19N7. starting with $31 billion in fiscal
1985.
