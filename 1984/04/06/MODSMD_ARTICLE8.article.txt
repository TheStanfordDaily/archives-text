From The Washington Post
Washington — The Republican-controlled Senate,
resisting to the end any significant restriction on Presi
dent Reagan's policy in Central America, yesterday
gave him a major victory by approving almost $62 mil
lion in emergency military aid for El Salvador and $21
million to help rebels fighting the government of
Nicaragua.
"We have reaffirmed our policy there which has for
five out of seven years been a bipartisan one," said
Majority Whip Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) who shep
herded the bill to approval.
The final vote after a week of debate was 76-19,
reflecting deep Democratic divisions. Southern

Democrats consistently voted with Republicans on
most of 12 unsuccessful efforts to restrict aid.
Reagan has insisted that Salvadoran armed forces
need the money before the end of this month in order
to guarantee a secure presidential runoff election.
But the appropriations bill faces stiff resistance in the
Democratic-dominated House, and Congress is sched
uled to begin a week-long Easter recess at the end of
next week.
Administration officials have left open the possibility
that they will use special emergency authority to bypass
Congress and send the funds if the House fails to act

before next Friday.
The House has voted twice to kill aid to Nicaraguan
rebels, and critics of administration policy there say
that sentiment is largely unchanged. In addition, the
Senate measure is a grab bag of unrelated funding ef
forts that will not speed passage.
Aside from the bill's original purpose, the widely
backed $50 million in food aid for Africa, trimmings in
clude $5 billion in Commodity Credit Corp. export
credit guarantees, permission for oil company mergers
to continue pending hearings. $3.4 million for a Penn
sylvania school district, $25 million for Customs Ser
vice aircraft and $70 million for the Public Broadcast
ing Service.
