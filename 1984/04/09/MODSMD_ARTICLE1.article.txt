# Conference alcohol sales questioned
## 
### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
Questions have been raised about possible viola
tions of state liquor laws by the ASSU Lobby Of
fice after money was allegedly collected from high
school and college students who were served liquor
during Friday night's Inner Quad party.
According to John Hoffmire, director of the
Lobby Office, liquor was not sold.
"We weren't charging, we were taking dona
tions," he said. "A lot of people probably didn't
know that, but we were."
The Lobby Office sponsored the party, which
was part of a three-day public policy conference.
High school students, college students and mem
bers of the public attended the conference.
Along with 50 cents for a cup of Pepsi or coffee,
the l.obby Office asked for a 50-cent donation per

cup of beer.
Though no signs were posted with the amounts
listed. Hoffmire said the donations were suggested
when people came up for drinks.
"We asked for 50 cents per cup, but if people
pushed it or said they didn't have it, we gave it to
them free," he said.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said it is up
to local or state authorities to decide whether to
enforce th£ liquor laws in this instance.
Though the University will take no legal action,
Lyons said it wtiuld probably be necessary to talk
to people at the Lobby Office.
"We want to make sure there is no misun
derstanding, which is probably what happened,"
he said. "But we do want to be sure that this
doesn't happen again."
The Lobby Office may be in violation of state

law which requires that liquor vendors must have a
license.
According to Law School Prof. Jack Friedenthal,
the Lobby Office was not necessarily selling alcohol
since it charged the same amount for all beverages.
"Then there is really no intent to sell beer, just
an intent to sell drinks," he said.
Friedenthal said the beer was "really a gift, in
that sense," because beer is more expensive than
pepsi or coffee.
But, according to Hoffmire, the Lobby Office
reduced the amount asked for coffee from 50 cents
to 25 cents later in the evening.
Friedenthal said the difference in price between
coffee and beer might then constitute a violation of
the state liquor law.
Brad Barham, associate director of the Lobby
Office, *said the money collected was intended to
defray the of having the hand at the party.

public policy conference this weekend, asking students to vote and to
take an active interest in politics. The three-day conference attracted
