I he New York dogfight
Former Vice President Wal
ter Mondale's overwhelming
victory in Tuesday's New York
Democratic primary may have
marked an important turning
point in the tone and the sub
stance of the race for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination.
Mondale's campaign received a
new dose of vigor as the candi
dates continue their jockeying
on the long road to San Fran
cisco.
New York brought to the
surface the most intense foreign
policy debate of the campaign
thus far, at times highly personal
and harsh. The heavy exchange
of blows last week, especially
between the two leading candi
dates, led the candidate's
strategists to express some con
cern privately that the public's
tolerance for negative cam
paigning may be waning.
As the campaign swept into
Pennsylvania, the next impor
tant primary state, during the
latter half of last week the poli
tical battle of New York
definitely had made a noticeable
change. Mondale arrived with
the new nickname of Fighting
Fritz and a pair of boxing gloves
bouncing to the theme song
from the movie of "Rocky."
The candidates emerged from
the political dogfight with
Mondale taking a large forty
five percent share of the vote.
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart's New
York showing was his most
discouraging yet with

the Rev. Jesse Jackson coming
within one percentage point of
nudging Hart for second place.
Hart garnered 2K percent of the
New York vote to Jackson's 27.
The Colorado Democrat
found a little consolation in his
victory of forty-six percent to
Mondale's forty-three percent
in Wednesday's Wisconsin non
binding primary. However,
caucuses to apportion delegates
which were held in that state on
Saturday gave Mondale a good
lead.
Surveys conducted by both
the Hart and. Mondale cam
paigns show the two to be run
ning about even in tomorrow's
Pennsylvania's primary. This is
in spite of the fact that the
demography of the state would
seem to favor Mondale with its
strong unions, large elderly
poulation and high unemploy
ment.
With his best showing thus far
in New York, Jackson's cam
paign continues to gain strength
despite some mistakes that al
most certainly would have been
politically fatal for a white can
didate. Before the New
Hampshire primary he used the
word "Hymie" in a reference to
Jews in the presence of a black
reporter. Then last week, after
one of his supporters, Louis
Farrakhan, threatened the life
of the reporter, Jackson said the
threat was "wrong," but refused
to disassociate himself from the
Black Muslim leader.

Salvador aid package
The Reagan administration
got its Central American emer
gency aid package through the
Senate last week after two
weeks of debate and a large
number of Democratic attempts
to delay or place conditions on
it. The provision for $61.75 mil
lion in military funds for El Sal
vador and $21 million for rebels
fighting in the Nicaraguan gov
ernment may face an even roug
her time in the Democratic
controlled House.
Among the House Democrats
there is a definite split between
those who favor immediate aid

to El Salvador and those who
prefer to wait until they see who
wins the runoff in the Sal
vadoran presidential election
now tentatively scheduled for
May 6. House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill said he opposed further
aid. He was in no hurry to
schedule debate, putting it of
until after the Easter recess ends
April 23.
Much of the Senate debate
reflected a fear of direct U.S. in
volvement in Central America.
The administration was re
ported to have drawn up a con
tingency plan to send American
troops into combat if the Sal

vadoran army cannot defeat the
rebels.
According to congressional
and administration sources, the
United States is already playing
a direct role in another Central
American country. The Central
Intelligence Agency is said to be
directly involved with the laying
of mines in Nicaraguan ports as
part of a ploy of economic
sabotage.
Trimming the deficit
The House of Representa
tives considered eight plans for
reducing the $206.8 billion defi
cit the Congressional Budget

Office projects for 1985 last
week. As expected, the plan put
forth by the Democratic
majority carried clearly, 250 to
168, almost cleanly along party
lines.
In support of their package,
which would only lower next
year's deficit by $25 billion but
would save $182 billion over
three years, loyalist Democrats
made much of three points.
First, they say that the plan
would reduce the deficit by
nearly twice as much as one
President Reagan proposed in
his State of the Union address.
Second, they say that its "pay
as-you-go" framework would
require tax increases if some
spending rises faster than the
rate of inflation does. Finally,
the Democrats maintain that the
proposal is "do-able."
The Republican minority's
response to these three points is
mixed. They say the first point is
not in dispute and is not even
worth making. Reagan
abandoned his "$lOO billion
down payment on the deficit" a
few weeks ago after agreeing to
a $149 billion compromise plan
with the leaders of the Senate
Republican majority. Some
Republicans also dismissed
"pay-as-you-go" as a transpar
ent cover for "that good old tax
and spend."
Midway through last week
Reagan's original proposal was
rejected 401 to 1, with all
Democrats voting no to em
barass the White House and all

but one Republican joining in,
in symbolic protest to the Dem
ocratic action.
Whether the plan is "do
able" will become quite clear in
the near future. The House
starts this week trying to fit ac
tual spending and tax bills
within the target range. An even
tougher period will be reached
when the Senate begins to act
on the White House-approved
version for deficit reduction.
Meese inquiry
Jacob Stein, a veteran crim
inal defense lawyer, was
named to conduct a wide
ranging investigation of Edwin
Meese, the presidential coun
selor President Reagan has
nominated to be attorney gen
eral. Federal appeals court
Judge Roger Robb who led the
selection panel said they were
looking for "a competent man, a
man who knows his way around
the courtroom, an honest man."
Stein's appointment was sought
under the Ethics in Government
Act of 1978.
The independent counselor
has been empowered to look
into Meese's financial dealings
and other situations that led to
the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee's halting of confirmation
proceedings. Reagan, according
to a spokesman, has told mem
bers of his administration to
"cooperate fully with the inde
pendent counsel."


Former Vice President Walter Mondale was smiles on Friday as he greeted supporters at
the Grand Avenue Mall in Milwaukee. Mondale's overwhelming victory in New York on
Tuesday may have had something to do with his good mood. Mondale also collected a
majority of the Wisconsin delegates in Saturday's Dairy State caucus.
