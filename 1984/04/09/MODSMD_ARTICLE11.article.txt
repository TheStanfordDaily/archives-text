## The 						Stanford Daily Bickering and by-laws

As the editorial board interviewed candidates
for the ASSU senate this weekend, one message
came through loud and clear from virtually every
senate hopeful: The senate, as one candidate said,
is a "monstrous bureaucracy, bogged down in its
own bylaws" and unresponsive to student con
cerns.
The evidence is pretty convincing. The Culture
Connection, a proposed ASSU weekend shuttle
service between Stanford and San Francisco, was
killed by the senate in February, despite the fact
that the idea had widespread support from the
very students the senate is supposed to represent.
Furthermore, of the many senators who say they
favored the proposal, most attribute its failure to
the wording of the legislation, and not the actual
idea. Last year, students voted down a $20,000
fee assesment for the then-proposed ASSU
Lobby Office, 2454-1843. But the senate knew
better than to follow the students' vote, and it
funded the Lobby Office anyway. A number of
senators have since argued that the senate was
justified in funding the Lobby Office because stu
dents were really voting against the idea of a
$20,000 Lobby Office, and not the Lobby Office
itself. But a year later, the senate has already
transferred to the Lobby Office over $14,500, a
figure not far from that $20,000 mark, and all
from funds students voted to give other groups.

In that same election, the senate disqualified
one-fourth of the fee assessment groups and nine
of 39 senate candidates on technicalities, includ
ing one potential senator who neglected to put his
name on the back of the last page of his petition.
Then last week, in the latest episode of the sen
ate's ongoing bureaucratic boondoggle, word
surfaced that former graduate senator James
McGrath has successfully managed to control 12
of 17 statements opposing fee assessments to
particular groups. These statements appear in the
ASSU's official elections handbook.
So it's really no surprise that only two current
undergraduate senators are running for re
election and that only about 25 students are run
ning for the 20 undergraduate senate slots. And
who knows how many candidates the senate will
decide to disqualify between now and next week's
elections?
And if enough of those candidates survive the
current senate's petty rule-keeping and in
fighting, what will they accomplish in next year's
senate?
Despite their best intentions and calls for a Cul
ture Connection, a deader "Dead Week," mag
netic photo I.D. cards and improved food service,
these ethusiastic candidates will leave the senate
in a year, frustrated and bitter — unless the
ASSU can rise above the bickering and bylaws.
