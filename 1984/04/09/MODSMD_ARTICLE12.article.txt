## Social issues will fill Reagan's next agenda 
### 
Ronald Reagan's first term has been
dominated by economic issues, and
the president will run for re-election
primarily on his questionable eco
nomic accomplishments. But there is
every indication that if Reagan does
win a second term, his next adminis
tration will focus on a radical social
agenda deeply frightening to most
Americans.
Reagan likes catchy, simple, one
shot solutions to big, visible problems.

VIEWPOINT

The enormous Kemp-Roth tax give
away was tailor-made for Reagan; it
was a big change, it was easy to ex
pl::in and it sounded good in speeches.
Kemp-Roth was the kind of economic
program Reagan could handle.
But for a second term, the nation's
economic problems are not going to
b< .is amenable to quick-fix solutions.
Budget deficits and trade deficits are
the kind of messy, detail-ridden prob
lems that Reagan is worst at solving.
Reagan, if re-elected, will have no
political incentives to moderate any of
his ultra-conservative views. His
recent speeches before evangelical
Christians and radio preachers indi
cate that Reagan's second term would
be dominated by social issues, not eco
nomics. A recent example of this new
focus was the school prayer constitu
tional amendment, which narrowly
went down to defeat in the Senate.
The Reagan social agenda is long.
Much involves an unprecedented as
sault on the Constitution. Besides
school prayer, Reagan has endorsed
constitutional amendments on abor
tion, school busing and a balanced
budget. Of course, if Reagan, as seems
likely, can appoint two or three more
Supreme Court justices, then not only
w ill all these amendments be unneces
sary, but many of the current rights we
think we have will be in jeopardy.

Some parts of the Reagan social
agenda are easy to implement. The
administration's continuing attack on
civil rights and affirmative action oc
cur through the Justice Department
and the Reagan-controlled Civil
Rights Commission. James Watt and
Anne Gorsuch Burford are gone, but
the Reagan attack on the environment
goes on unabated in the Environmen
tal Protection Agency and the Interior
Department.
Other parts of the Reagan social
agenda will proceed through a combi
nation of federal and local action.
Reagan will certainly try to repeal the
few, weak federal laws controlling
handguns, and he may launch attacks
to pre-empt state and local gun con
fro/ ordinances. The Department of
Education is already considering ef
forts to aid local school boards in
cleansing libraries of "subversive"
books. Reagan himself repeatedly
calls for a return to the 1950s restric
tions on what books you can buy and
which movies you can see. Moves to
close off government decision making
from the people, to increase secrecy
and to reduce the accountability of
corrupt politicians are a continuing
threat &t both the federal and local
levels.
Taken individually, these and other
Reagan second-term initiatives are
odious. Taken together, they con
stitute a concerted, radical attack on
the structure of American society in
the 1980s. In his first term, Reagan
has mortgaged the future of this
country for a short-term political gain.
In a second term, he will try to saddle
America with a social order that was
out of date 20 years ago. Reagan's so
lutions to the problems and issues of
the '80s is a blind retreat to the
romanticized country he thinks he re
members from the '50s.
