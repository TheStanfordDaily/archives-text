# 'Guns don't die, people do'

### 
When a reporter in last week's press conference
queried President Reagan on his opposition to
handgun control despite strong popular support
for such legislation, the President blithely sides
tepped and left the question unanswered. But with
soul singer Marvin Gaye joining the thousands of
Americans who have been killed by handguns
already this year, it seems appropriate to ask the
question, "Why don't we have strong national
handgun control legislation?"
Public opinion polls repeatedly show that three
out of four Americans favor handgun control. Five
presidential commissions have called for stricter
handgun control legislation; their call has been
echoed by the American Bar Association, the In
ternational Assocation of Chiefs of Police and the
American Civil Liberties Union. So why don't we
have strong national handgun control legislation?
The answer is simple: the National
Rifle Association (NRA). Since its founding in
1871, the NRA has been the tool .by which gun
manufacturers protect their interests at the ex
pense of the American public. The NRA attacks
handgun control legislation by leading its members
to believe that restrictions on deadly handguns will
somehow lead to a ban on all guns, misrepresent
ing the intention of those who wish to make
America safer for law- abiding gun owners.
The NRA is the biggest spending lobby in
America, spending more than $11 million on lob
bying and advertising in 1982 alone; their political
action committee contributed $1.5 million in more
than 500 races nationwide in that year's elections.
"For too long, we have dealt with these deadly
weapons as if they were harmless toys . . . Yet their
very presence, the ease of their acquisition and the
familiarity of their appearance have led to
thousands of deaths each year - and to countless
other crimes of violence as well. It is past time that
we wipe this stain of violence from our land."
—Robert Kennedy, May 1965.
As the trite saying goes, "Guns don't kill people,
people do"— but its a hell of a lot easier to kill
someone if you have a pistol in your hand. And, as
another not-so-trite saying reminds us, "Guns
don't die. people do."
What are the arguments against gun control?
Here are four popular ones:
If guns are banned, other weapons such as knives
and clubs will be used instead . . . where do we
draw the line on banning weapons?
This is a ridiculous argument; other weapons,

such as knives, hammers and the like, have pri
mary purposes which are not lethal. Handguns
alone are designed and made expressly to kill
living creatures, most often humans.
If guns are outlawed, only outlaw,p will have guns.
First off, handgun control only seeks to outlaw
snub-nose handguns such as the Saturday Night
Special, which is too inaccurate for target or sport
shooting. Secondly, a majority of handgun killings
are not committed by "outlaws"— they are crimes
of passion and accidents involving close friends
and family members.
Handgun control is against the second amend
ment to the Constitution.
This common argument is also fallacious: Hand
gun control laws have been on the books beginning
with a 1795 Massachusetts law banned "offensive"
weapons in public and continuing through the
1968 Handgun Control Act, and have been held to
be constitutional throughout. This past fall, the Su
preme Court upheld a handgun ban by the
township of Morton Grove, 111. much to the
chagrin of the gun lobby.
Handgun control does not or cannot work.
This argument has been effectively refuted by
the number of other developed nations that have
enacted handgun control legislation that does
work. Seven of 10 homicides in the United States
are committed with a gun; in Great Britain, where
there are strict gun control laws, only one homicide
in six was gun-related. The familiar poster circ
ulated by Handgun Control, Inc., spells it out
clearly:
In 1980, handguns killed 77 people in Japan.
8 in Great Britain.
24 in Switzerland.
8 in Canada.
23 in Israel.
18 in Sweden.
4 in Australia.
11,522 in the United States.
God bless America.
To use the cost-benefit analysis that the Reagan
Administration is so fond of, what possible benefit
could outweigh the cost of 10,000 lives a year? If
handgun control legislation will reduce these kil
lings by just 25 percent, what is the cost of 2500
lives? Of the anguish and pain felt by the survivors,
the families of handgun crime victims?

What is being done in Congress about the 60
million handguns now in circulation? Since the
NRA thwarted the last major attempt at handgun
control legislation in 1975-76, there have been
several bills that have generated tepid if not
widespread support: the Moynihan-Biaggi Law
Enforcement Officers Protection Bill and the
Kennedy-Rodino Handgun Crime Control Bill.
There is also a bill which threatens to wipe out all
the gains made so far, the McClure-Volkmer Gun
Decontrol Bill, which would gut the 1968 Hand
gun Control Act and reinstate mail-order gun
sales.
The Moynihan-Biaggi Bill would stop the sale
and manufacture of armor-piercing "cop-killer"
bullets, and require a jail sentence for anyone
using such bullets in a crime. The killer bullets are
specially designed to penetrate bullet-proof vests,
and the bill has been endorsed by> every major
police organization. Despite these facts, the hut
has been extensively lobbied against by the NRAv,
to the surprise of many policemen who are mem
bers of the NRA. "Obviously," commented one
officer,"the National Rifle Association does not
respect the basic right of police officers to stay
alive."
The Kennedy-Rodino bill limits gun sales to
licensed dealers, restricts buyers to two firearms
per year, requires that purchasers be screened for
criminal and mental health records, calls for man
datory sentences for anyone using a handgun
during the commission of a crime and would halt
the sale and manufacture of the deadly snub-nosed
handguns. This legislation is too practical, too far
sighted and too necessary to be strangled by the
NRA.
Today in the United States, over 30 will be mur
dered by handguns. Yesterday, over 30 people
were killed with handguns; tomorrow, and on
average, every day of this year, over 30 people will
be killed by handguns. We are not powerless to
stop this senseless killing. The United States public
would have been incensed if the Iranian students
had executed our 53 hostages in 1979, yet it stands
calmly by as similar executions take place today,
tomorrow and every day. It is time for the Amer
ican public to realize that we are being held
hostage — held hostage by the gun lobby.
