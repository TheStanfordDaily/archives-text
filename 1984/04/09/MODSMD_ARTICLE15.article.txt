## American electorate has to reduce apathy 
### 
Why do we have low voter turnouts in this
country? Why do fewer than 50 percent of the
people vote in a nation based on representative
democracy? A number of structural and attitudinal
reasons suggest themselves. If we examine these
reasons we can gain insights into ways to overcome
them and remove our nation's most glaring incon
sistency.
We can do little to eliminate one of the biggest
reasons for low voter turnout because it lies at the

VIEWPOINT

heart of our democracy. America elects a very
large percentage of its government officials and the
multitude of elections both confuses and ex
asperates voters. Consequently, local elections can
have turnouts as low as 15 percent. The vast num
ber of elections is the price we pay for representa
tive government but it also helps explain why
Britain, with three or four elections per year, con
sistently has higher turnouts. Granted, fewer elec
tions means more excitement about voting. Yet no
one could realistically argue for fewer elections to
create higher voting percentages.
Another structural reason why voter turnout
remains low compared to other countries and even
our own past revolves around changes in proce
dure. The advent of the Australian ballot and
other voting reforms drastically reduced big city
machine voting fraud. Thus figures from countries
and periods before their introduction arc artifically
high.
Third World countries like El Salvador can
achieve high turnouts through a mixture of
coercive fines and fraud. American voting in the
• could pr< duce incredibly high voter turnouts

through ballot-box stuffing and intimidation.
However, the procedures in place today effectively
eliminate these problems. They give much more
realistic percentages that seem small when
compared to the inflated Third World and 19th
century American figures. We should realize this
disparity when thinking of improvements in our
voting system. Our problem may not be as sub
stantial when we qualify misleading comparisons.
For some potential voters the decision not to
vote stems from a feeling that the costs outweigh
the benefits. Consider the calculations voters must
make. They must register in advance, learn about
candidates, take time off to vote, travel to the polls
and wait in line to vote. A one-in-a-million-chance
that their vote makes a difference and a vague no
tion of civic duty are all that offset these costs in
their minds. Moreover, in national elections. West
Coast voters feel the benefits are significantly
smaller for them. The election might well be
locked up long before their polls close.
The most disheartening reason why people
refuse to vote lies in their belief that elections do
not matter. To these potential voters, the party
system inevitably yields identical, middle-of-the
road candidates who have really little power to al
ter the edifice of government. Why vote if there is
no choice and only a small sense of political ef
ficacy?
Despite these obstacles, several things can be
done to create higher voting participation. First,
elections need to be more aggressively advertised.
If all the local elections received even one
twentieth of the media attention of the national
election, voters would respond. However, the em
phasis should be placed on quality, not quantity.
The substance of the message should be simple: If

people think their vote doesn't count, then it cer
tainly won't. Only by exercising the right to vote
will suffrage be strong enough to make a differ
ence.
The times in our nation's history when the par
ties have been most responsible and programmatic
coincide with our greatest mass political move
ments. This is not chance but cause and effect.
Consequently, either the government or
entrepreneurial private groups should champion
the democratic meaning of voting so that govern
ment can conform more closely to the wishes of the
people. By appealing to the democratic spirit in
herent in all free people, an aggressive campaign
on the importance of voting would yield bountiful
results both in short-run voting percentages and in
long-term public policy.
However, a nostrum like this may not be
enough. Undoubtedly, it will touch the heart of
many apathetic citizens, yet it does not address the
structural barriers to voting. At the national level.
Congress and the president should declare election
day a national holiday, which would help provide
an atmosphere conducive to mass voting. At the
local level, mail balloting should be instituted. Pro
vided proper fraud prevention techniques are
used, this scheme would solve many problems. The
number of elections, job conflicts, transportation
and queuing would cease to be obstacles and more
people would vote. The easier it is to fulfill our na
tional duty, the better we will feel about doing it —
and the more we will do it.
