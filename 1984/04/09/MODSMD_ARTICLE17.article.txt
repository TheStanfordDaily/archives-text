## Brokaw encourages students to pursue life in public arena 
### HEATHER WRIGHT Staff writer 
I env y your age. You arc
growing up on the cusp of one gen
eration of leadership giving away to
another, NBC anchorman Tom
Brokaw said here Friday.
Delivering the welcoming ad
dress lor the weekend-long
"Conference on Election 1984,"
Brokaw told a White Plaza audi
ence ot about 200 to "immerse
yourselves in the public arena. If
you don't you're abdicating your
obligation."
Brokaw criticized much of con
temporary public service, calling it
"homage to self-interest" and a
"sporting event serving the narrow
interests of financial sponsors." He
added, "We can't entrust our
future to these political eunuchs."
Brokaw joked that since Presi
dent Reagan described the MX
missile as "the peacekeeper" he
will soon be referring to unemploy
ment as "the vacation extender."
Youth in this country face the
new problem of marrying the

private and public sectors, Brokaw
said. This problem calls for a "new
generation of independent voters."
Even though Sen. Gary Hart (D-
Colo.) and Jesse Jackson may not
prevail in the 1984 presidential
campaign, Brokaw considers them
the wave of new U.S. politics.
Brokaw said that "Hart and Jack
son have introduced fresh issues
and new approaches" which will
have great impact on the political
arena.
Reminding students to vote in
1984, Brokaw went on to urge them
to "rise above the trendy upwardly
mobile" and concentrate on the
serious political problems threaten
ing society, rather than solely on
"getting your children into the
private school of your choice."
"Think about the unemployment
of black youth, the relationship be
tween the prosperous and Third
World nations, the environment
and most of all, the madness of the
nuclear race," Brokaw said. "It is a
cop-out to say 'politics bore me.'
You have no right to complain un
less you get involved."
