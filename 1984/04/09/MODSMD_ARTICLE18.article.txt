# Panelists discuss nuclear war ethics

### SHEILA MANKANI 
Three panelists discussing the
morality of the arms race Friday
night in Memorial Church received
repeated ovations from an audi
ence of approximately 500 for each
of many statements asserting that
"nuclear war is unethical."
"The nature of thermonuclear
weaponry we have developed is so
radically other in terms of
destructive capability from anyth
ing we have ever experienced that
it changes the ethical question
completely," according to
Theologist Thomas Ambrogi, exec
utive director of the Commission of
Social Justice for the Archdiocese
of San Francisco.
"The ethical issue must be put
first," Ambrogi said. "The rest of
arms control is, in my opinion, a
dead end."
Ambrogi said the fundamental
ethical issue underlying the arms
race is the immorality of targeting
civilian populations. He called for a
new form of international
diplomacy and a "new way of relat
ing across boundaries to resolve
any differences in thought."
Also on the panel were physicist
Samuel Cohen, inventor of the
neutron bomb, and San Jose Dem
ocratic Assemblyman John Vas

concellos.
Cohen cited inadequate informa
tion of Soviet production and
deployment of nuclear weaponry as
the crucial flaw in the arms race.
But he said he would not adv
ocate a bilateral nuclear freeze be
cause of the impossibilty of
verification caused by "a Soviet
obsession with secrecy and misin
formation." New inspection regu
lations allowing the United States
to learn "exactly what's going on
on the other side" are necessary to
establish trust and to achieve
meaningful arms control agree
ments. he said.
Claiming that morality and nu
clear war are "inconsistent" no
tions, Vasconcellos explained that
"everyone desires the same goals
of peace. . . . The politics (of the
arms race) isn't a conflict of goals."
The conflict, he said, is in the
various means by which people try
to achieve these goals.
"If we love life rather than hate
it,"he said, "if we want to live life
rather than go on to the next one,
then it is incumbent upon us to
make choices. . . .1 would invite
you to become more and more the
kinds of faithful persons who can
truly be moral."
