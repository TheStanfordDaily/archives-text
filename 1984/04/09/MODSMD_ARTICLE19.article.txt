## 
### PETER HAVEN 
"By creating an atmosphere of
fear," the Reagan administration is
trying to control the lives of indi
viduals through draft registration,
David Wayte, a draft resister from
Pasadena, said here Saturday.
Wayte told about 30 people in
Cubberley Auditorium that "If we
unite, then our outcry can be
heard. We can stick together, and
we are all in this together." He was
joined in the discussion by Carol
Delton, a Berkeley anti-draft ac
tivtet and attorney'. 1 1 11

•A'fedela']' 'iti -1982''fofr
failing to register for the draft in
June, 1980, but his case was dis
missed on the grounds that he was
a victim of selective prosecution.
The government appealed the
decision and won in July, and now
Wayte and his lawyers are appeal
ing the case to the Supreme Court.

The audience broke into ap
plause after Wayte began his ad
dress by saying, "I am one of a
half-million people who have bro
ken the law by not registering for
the draft.
"The government likes to think
we can't think and act on our own,"
Wayte said. "For me, draft resis
tance is a way of thinking for
myself and acting on my own. I
own my own body and my own life,
and 1 am here to be a human being
practicing for peace."
Wayte emphasized the need for
draft resiste&s.to;\make a,standifar
peAce" and oieveiop the attitude
that individuals can make a differ
ence.
Wayte called the Solomon
Amendments particularly effective
tools "through which the govern
ment tries to control people."
Those amendments prevent non
registrants from receiving federal
financial aid and participating in
federal job training programs.
Delton. co-author of Everbody's
Guide to Non-Registration, said.
"These amendments are prime ex
amples of why we must keep an eye
on our legislators after we vote for
them. We have to be active and pay
close attention to policy as it goes
through government legislatures.
"Today is an appropriate time to
talk about the Solomon Amend
ments." _she said.
The Supreme Court will also
hear cases involving the Solomon
Amendments on April 23. Delton
urged draft resisters to keep in
formed of the results of these two
events.
