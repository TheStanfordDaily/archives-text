### CINT HIGHFILL Staff writer 
Between 3000 and 4000 people at
tended this weekend's conference on
participation, public policy, politics
and public service, according to John
Hoffmire, director of the ASSU
Lobby Office. The conference boasted
audiences and participants from the
Stanford community as well as 55
other colleges and universities and 17
high schools.
The three-day conference,
sponsored by the Lobby Office, began
Friday with an address by NBC News
anchorman Tom Brokaw in White
Plaza, and concluded last night in
Kresge Auditorium with a forum on
Public Officials and Public Serv ice.
The overall goals of the conference
were "getting students more informed
and more involved," Hoffmire said.
Toward that end, about 35 speakers
in 13 conferences dealt with issues

ranging in focus from security and dis
armament to the importance of
minority participation in the 1984
elections. In addition, the conference
sponsored five workshops on voter
registration.
"Things have really worked out
well," Hoffmire said, and participants
who were interviewed agreed. The
speakers, including a Nobel laureate
and the national co-director of the
Mondale campaign, generated praise

and the speakers themselves were also
impressed.
"I enjoyed it, it was really terrific.
This is the year for people to get poli
tical, and this is the right age for you
people to get involved," according to
Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).
"The conference made me recog
nize the common thread running
through all the Democratic candi
dates," Steve McHugh said. "1 would
now support whoever comes out of the
convention,"he said.
Students from different campuses
were enthusiastic about the opportu
nity to meet. McHugh, of the UC-
Davis Students with Hart group, said,
"I actually came for the voter registra
tion aspects, but one of the best things
is making contacts with other students
political groups."
"The conference was very crucial
for our organization and networking,"
according to Hardy Callcott, Stanlord
co-chairman of Students Against
Reaganism.
Eric Diesel, campus director for
Students for Mondale, said, "The con
ference enabled us to get information
out without the news media and to get
large numbers of students working
with Students for Mondale." For ex
ample, prior to the conference, very
few people were aware that Mondale,
unlike Hart, supports national gay
rights legislation, he said.
The conference itself was a major
undertaking. "Over 100 people have
been involved in the organizing of this
conference," according to Craig Ric
hards, a Stanford alumnus and confer
ence volunteer. He estimated that just
this weekend, at least 1000 hours ot
work went into the running of the
event.
