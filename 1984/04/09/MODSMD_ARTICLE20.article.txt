Two Middle East educators
criticized the inconsistency and
misconceptions in U.S. policy
toward Middle Eastern countries
during a panel discussion in Kresge
auditorium yesterday.
Rashid Khalidi, professor of po
litical studies at the American Uni
versity in Beirut, and Jacob

Goldberg, professor of Middle East
studies at the Shiloach Institute in
Tel Aviv, both identified shortcom
ings in U.S. policy.
Khalidi criticized the "gross
double standard" the United States
applies to the Palestinian question.
"There is a definite asymmetry
to the U.S. approach," he said.
"Israel's right to statehood is taken

as a sine qua non, but the situation
is quite different for the Pales
tinians. They are not considered
people."
Goldberg said the Reagan ad
ministration mistakenly believes all
crises in the Middle East arise from
the Arab-Israeli conflict, and that
the Palestinian question is at the
core of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
