"If women and minorities vote in
the next .election, we pan .change;
the political landscape." EUpne.
Zimmerman, co-director of the
Women's Economic Agenda Proj
ect, told an audience of about 100
people at Kresge Auditorium Sun
day morning.
Zimmerman and two other
panelists, Julian Malveaux, profes
sor of economics at San Francisco
State, and Virginia Dean, a legal

representative for the Comparable
Worth Project, an organization
aimed prompting equitable pay
for jwrcAggu emphasized need
for changes in curr'cnt public polity
concerning the family, child care,
wage equity and social security.
Public policy is based on the
"white middle-class assumption"
that the husband works and the
wife stays at home with the
children, Zimmerman said. It
"does not address the true realities

of what's happening in this
country."
She added that only 17 percent
rnpthv.iv aw. staying and
not working.
An increased number of single
and divorced women trying to sup
port families, lack of child support
and inequity in wages between wo
men and men has led to what Zim
merman calls the "feminization of
poverty.
