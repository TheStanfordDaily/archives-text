### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer 
A former State Department offi
cial predicted "a very serious
regional war in the next one to two
years" in Central America if
Reagan administration policies are
continued.
Wayne Smith, the former direc
tor of Cuban affairs who resigned
his post as director of Cuban affairs \
I because of the administration's in- '
1 flexibility in dealing with Cuba.
J said Reagan has "side-stepped
112 every <jpening /<>/ neyDtiji turn* in i
Central America." Smith and other /
panel members spoke on Central
American policy at Kresge
Auditorium Saturday.
Smith said U.S. objectives in
Central America were clearly de-
signed to "force a military victory
in El Salvador and overthrow the
Sandinista government in
Nicaragua."
Reagan's policies have taken the
United States "further away from
either a military or a negotiated
settlement." he said.
The 300 members of the audi
ence repeatedly interrupted Smith
and the other panel members as
they offered sharp criticism of the
Reagan administration's policies in
Central America.
"A vote for Ronald Reagan is a
vote for war in Central America,"
said Cindy Buhl, human rights co
ordinator of the Coalition for a
New Foreign and Military Policy.
Juan Perez, a Salvadoran
refugee, opened the session and
received a standing ovation for
recounting his experiences in El
Salvador.
Perez, a medical doctor, worked
in a public health clinic and said he
personally witnessed army and
death squads invading emergency
rooms and operating rooms to kiil
patients. He said it was a "regular
occurrence."
Perez said he was taken to prison
and tortured for 24 days by the Na
tional Guard because he wouldn't
give them information about his
patients.
Thomas Ambrogi, executive
director of the commission on so
cial justice for the archdiocese of
San Francisco, said military aid to
El Salvador should be stopped be
cause the "U.S. refuses to use its
power to stop death squads."
