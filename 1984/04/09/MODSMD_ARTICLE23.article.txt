## PROFESSOR'S COMMENTARY: JAN TRISKA The 						changing roles in the world of super-powers 
### 
Prof. Jan Triska came to the
United States in 194 X from his
home in Prague, Czechos
lovakia. He went directly to Yale
University to study law and after
graduating in 1951, Triska at
tended Harvard University
where he earned a Ph.D. in poli
tical science. Before coming to
Stanford in 1960, Triska taught
at Harvard, UC- Berkeley and
Cornell. Currently he is a profes
sor of political science and co
chairman of the International
Relations Program at Stanford.
Triska has traveled extensively in
the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe as well as Latin
America, Africa and other parts
of the world.
The principal aspirations and
hopes of mankind are the
achievement of peace and

prosperity and the avoidance of
war and human inequality.
Since no country in our inter
dependent, finite world can
hope to achieve these goals
alone, collective efforts are re
quired.
But because all countries in
sist on their own sovereignty,
i.e., absolute control over their
own terrritory as the universally
defining national characteristic
of international relations, they
acknowledge only those inter
national rules and regulations
which they themselves volun
tarily accept. Consequently, in
ternational relations still display
relatively few rules which shape
the processes and the substance
of the behavior of states.
For this reason, negotiation
and bargaining loom large on

the international horizon;
countries must cooperate with
others to increase their own
well-being, prosperity and
equality in the world. Because
raw, coercive power has not yet
been placed under international
control, states must also protect
themselves, both singly and col
lectively. against others in order
to maintain peace and avoid
war.
With time, international rela
tions have become increasingly
complex. The number of issues,
states, cultures, technological
capabilities, and interests have
been increasing rapidly.
Moreover, the tempo of change
has been accelerating at an
alarming rate. This complex,
rapid, universal growth has been
calling for more, not fewer.

rules and regulations, in order
that international relations not
get out of hand.
There are many different
structures, formal as well as in
formal, with many different
functions, which shape the
processes and the substance in
international relations, in spite
of its rudimentary nature of or
der. Some are bilateral, such as
commercial treaties or customs
agreements. Some are
plurilateral. and some
are universal, sucn as the United
Nations. Other structures are
strategic, economic or strictly
functional, like the World
Health Organization or the In
ternational Civil Aviation Or
ganization.
Some structures are regional.

such as the Organization of
American States, or the Associ
ation of South East Asian Na
tions: some are global or na
tional. displaying certain char
acteristics that states ha\e in
common. such as the
landlocked States or the
countries of the Third World.
Some of the Third World
countries are formally organized
in the Group of Seventy-Seven,
the Nonaligned Movement, the
Lome Convention states, or the
U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development.
Some international structures
involve relations between domi
nant and dependent nations,
and some aspire to be
normative, trying to improve
world conditions.
To understand the dynamic
complexity of present interna
tional relations, we could study
through international law the
adequacy of these international
structures in terms of their par
ticular functions; or we could
study the complex world of the
United Nations by approaching
international relations through
international organizations. The
basic logic of conflict could be
explored in terms of war and
peace, or balance of power, or
"prisoner's dilemma" of the two
superpowers, the United States
and the Soviet Union; or we
could study the world economic
order through the perceptive
lenses of political economy,
from resource shortages and en
vironmental protections to eco
nomic leverage and deterrence.
In the course on international
relations taught at Stanford by
Professors Ike, North and
myself, we have selected as our
organizing stucture "the world
of superpowers," a pentagonal
model dating back to the early
seventies and including the
United States, the Soviet Union,
China. Japan and Western
Europe.
Formally, the trip of Presi
dent Nixon and Secretary Kis
singer to China in February,
1972 (and their subsequent trip

to the Soviet Union), as well as
the founding of the Trilateral
Commission in 1973 by some
300 "eminent private citizens"
from North America. Western
Europe (Common Market) and
Japan, ushered in a new era
seen by many to signal, in
Nixon's words, "the end of the
dangerously. bilateral model" of
the United States and the
U.S.S.R. The new phase, al
though more complex, appeared
preferable to the past Cold War.
not only because it brought
China out of dangerous isola
tion but also because it estab
lished elements of active col
laboration between the United
States and the U.S.S.R. and be
cause it placed other entities,
such as Europe and Japan, in a
new cooperative context.
The new pentagonal construct
appeared to promise not only
greater safety for the world at
large, but also greater
prosperity for all. By linking to
gether the world's vital centers

of economic output, finance,
management, technology and
trade the rich leaders of the
North would not only col
lectively try to embrace and co
opt the poorer peoples of the
South — the Third World — but
would also attempt to rein
tegrate gradually the world's
economic dropouts, the commu
nist countries — the Soviet
Union, Eatern Europe and
China — into the international
economic system. As a conse
quence, the two new triangles,
one strategic and the other eco
nomic, could be seen as comple
mentary, beneficial constructs
on the world scene linked to
gether hy universal aspirations
for peace, prosperity and
equalit).
After more than a decade
since this new grand interna
tional scheme was inaugurated,
it appears that, in the context of
the harsh reality of the present


Jan Triska
international relations, the pen
tagonal concept, though real
and lasting, was conceived more
as a hopeful vision than an over
lapping, organizing anchor in
the relations among nations. On
the strategic side, the United
States-China-Soviet triangle
has not replaced the conflictual
United States-Soviet bilateral
model because the triangle is
limited in space, issue and value.
In space, it is as yet neither uni
versal nor global, but regional,
limited to the Pacific Asian
area. In issue, the triangle is lim
ited as well because China,
though on the verge of becom
ing a strategic superpower, pos

sesses nuclear capability useful
principally to deter others from
attacking China. And the tri
angle is limited in value because
China is still principally a devel
oping country, which possesses
neither the capabilities nor the
leverages of its two major stra
tegic competitors.
On the economic side, the
United States-West Europe-
Japan triangle was slowed
down, if not stopped, in its am
bitious program of real develop
ment of prosperity and equality
by the emergence of the OPEC
oil embargo in 1973, by the
world economic recession start
ing in the second half of the
seventies and by the sheer size
of global economic inequality.
Some seventy percent of the
world population, located
mostly in the South, suffer from

a low per capita income and a
high degree of illiteracy and
disease, a low level of in
dustrialization, relatively
primitive agriculture and low
political stability. The problem

War 11. The Soviet Union, the

is staggering, and the need is
colossal, far beyond the present
capacity of the industrialized
North in any meaningful sense.
I he United States, a strategic
as well as an economic super
power, no longer makes all the

rely still on diplomatic bargain
ing rather than on real or ex
changeable assets. Japan has
impressively high technological
and financial assets but depends
on the good will of others. And
Western Europe, when acting as

a unit, has the highest gross na
tional product in the world, but
its unity is as yet far from
proven. As a consequence, di
versity and heterogeneity
characterize the major power
centers in the world.
But we must not sell short the
pentagonal concept with its two
complementary triangles. First,
it represents a solid new inter
national structure in an area
proverbially deficient in orderli
ness, where more cooperative
interstate constructs literally
mean more international order.
Second, the newly recognized
dramatic salience of nonsecurity
issues blunts the established
primacy of strategic problems:
Because of the danger that the
operation of the international
economy might spin out of con
trol, world economic concerns

now compete seriously with se
curity issues for priority atten
tion around the globe. Third, a
new level of international con
cern has emerged which is no
longer indifferent to the welfare
of the peoples of the Third
World. The developed nations,
in fact, have begun to respond
to the new challenge, for the
sake of global equality and
justice, to change the present
economic order originally
shaped by a few developed na
tions with common values, com
mon aspirations and common
modes of organization.
In addition to being a solid,
useful new structure in interna
tional relations, "The World of
Superpowers" is thus also an
important comprehensive global
vision of the world, where eco

nomic, technological and scien
tific cooperation could benefit
all on an equitable basis, among
all kinds of countries for all
kinds of trade-offs. Third World
countries would be embraced,
and the Communist countries
would be constructively in
volved in world trade with, and
economic development of,
needy others. The aim is the
coordination of both economic
and security policies of all the
superpowers and a new role for
them — positive, responsible,
stable and sustained — in the
management of international
security and international eco
nomy. That is a tall order, but it
is a challenge well worth pursu
ing as long as it appears to lead
to more peace, more prosperity
and greater equality in the
world.
