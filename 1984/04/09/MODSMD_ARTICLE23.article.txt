## PROFESSOR'S COMMENTARY: JAN TRISKA The
						changing roles in the world of super-powers 
### 
Prof. Jan Triska came to the
United States in 194 X from his
home in Prague, Czechos
lovakia. He went directly to Yale
University to study law and after
graduating in 1951, Triska at
tended Harvard University
where he earned a Ph.D. in poli
tical science. Before coming to
Stanford in 1960, Triska taught
at Harvard, UC- Berkeley and
Cornell. Currently he is a profes
sor of political science and co
chairman of the International
Relations Program at Stanford.
Triska has traveled extensively in
the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe as well as Latin
America, Africa and other parts
of the world.
The principal aspirations and
hopes of mankind are the
achievement of peace and

prosperity and the avoidance of
war and human inequality.
Since no country in our inter
dependent, finite world can
hope to achieve these goals
alone, collective efforts are re
quired.
But because all countries in
sist on their own sovereignty,
i.e., absolute control over their
own terrritory as the universally
defining national characteristic
of international relations, they
acknowledge only those inter
national rules and regulations
which they themselves volun
tarily accept. Consequently, in
ternational relations still display
relatively few rules which shape
the processes and the substance
of the behavior of states.
For this reason, negotiation
and bargaining loom large on

the international horizon;
countries must cooperate with
others to increase their own
well-being, prosperity and
equality in the world. Because
raw, coercive power has not yet
been placed under international
control, states must also protect
themselves, both singly and col
lectively. against others in order
to maintain peace and avoid
war.
With time, international rela
tions have become increasingly
complex. The number of issues,
states, cultures, technological
capabilities, and interests have
been increasing rapidly.
Moreover, the tempo of change
has been accelerating at an
alarming rate. This complex,
rapid, universal growth has been
calling for more, not fewer.

rules and regulations, in order
that international relations not
get out of hand.
There are many different
structures, formal as well as in
formal, with many different
functions, which shape the
processes and the substance in
international relations, in spite
of its rudimentary nature of or
der. Some are bilateral, such as
commercial treaties or customs
agreements. Some are
plurilateral. and some
are universal, sucn as the United
Nations. Other structures are
strategic, economic or strictly
functional, like the World
Health Organization or the In
ternational Civil Aviation Or
ganization.
Some structures are regional.

such as the Organization of
American States, or the Associ
ation of South East Asian Na
tions: some are global or na
tional. displaying certain char
acteristics that states ha\e in
common. such as the
landlocked States or the
countries of the Third World.
Some of the Third World
countries are formally organized
in the Group of Seventy-Seven,
the Nonaligned Movement, the
Lome Convention states, or the
U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development.
Some international structures
involve relations between domi
nant and dependent nations,
and some aspire to be
normative, trying to improve
world conditions.
To understand the dynamic
complexity of present interna
tional relations, we could study
through international law the
adequacy of these international
structures in terms of their par
ticular functions; or we could
study the complex world of the
United Nations by approaching
international relations through
international organizations. The
basic logic of conflict could be
explored in terms of war and
peace, or balance of power, or
"prisoner's dilemma" of the two
superpowers, the United States
and the Soviet Union; or we
could study the world economic
order through the perceptive
lenses of political economy,
from resource shortages and en
vironmental protections to eco
nomic leverage and deterrence.
In the course on international
relations taught at Stanford by
Professors Ike, North and
myself, we have selected as our
organizing stucture "the world
of superpowers," a pentagonal
model dating back to the early
seventies and including the
United States, the Soviet Union,
China. Japan and Western
Europe.
Formally, the trip of Presi
dent Nixon and Secretary Kis
singer to China in February,
1972 (and their subsequent trip

to the Soviet Union), as well as
the founding of the Trilateral
Commission in 1973 by some
300 "eminent private citizens"
from North America. Western
Europe (Common Market) and
Japan, ushered in a new era
seen by many to signal, in
Nixon's words, "the end of the
dangerously. bilateral model" of
the United States and the
U.S.S.R. The new phase, al
though more complex, appeared
preferable to the past Cold War.
not only because it brought
China out of dangerous isola
tion but also because it estab
lished elements of active col
laboration between the United
States and the U.S.S.R. and be
cause it placed other entities,
such as Europe and Japan, in a
new cooperative context.
The new pentagonal construct
appeared to promise not only
greater safety for the world at
large, but also greater
prosperity for all. By linking to
gether the world's vital centers

of economic output, finance,
management, technology and
trade the rich leaders of the
North would not only col
lectively try to embrace and co
opt the poorer peoples of the
South — the Third World — but
would also attempt to rein
tegrate gradually the world's
economic dropouts, the commu
nist countries — the Soviet
Union, Eatern Europe and
China — into the international
economic system. As a conse
quence, the two new triangles,
one strategic and the other eco
nomic, could be seen as comple
mentary, beneficial constructs
on the world scene linked to
gether hy universal aspirations
for peace, prosperity and
equalit).
After more than a decade
since this new grand interna
tional scheme was inaugurated,
it appears that, in the context of
the harsh reality of the present
