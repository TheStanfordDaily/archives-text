## Devils give Card hellish time 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The No. 3-ranked Arizona State Sun
Devils strengthened their hold on first place
in the Pacific-10 Southern Division baseball
conference and returned a favor in the
process, as they completed a three-game
sweep from the defending champion Stan
ford Cardinal with a 7-6 victory over the
C ard at Sunken Diamond yesterday.
A year ago it was the Cardinal who
thrashed Arizona State three times in Palo
Alto en route to its first Pac-10 crown since
1967, a crown that had most recently been
the exclusive property of the Sun Devils.
But this time around the Sun Devils came to
play, pounding Stanford pitchers for 38 hits
and six home runs in the three contests and
then hanging on for dear life to raise their
record to 33-10 and 15-1 in the 'Six-Pac"
Southern Division.
Together with USCs two losses at UC-
Berkeley over the weekend, Arizona State
increased its first place cushion to three
games over the second place Trojans, who
stand at 11-4. Stanford is next in line at 7-8
after suffering its sixth straight conference
loss, one game ahead of Arizona. The Card
fell to 22-18-1 overall.
"I'm pleased with the sweep, but we were
lucky to get out of here alive," said ASU's
Head Coach Jim Brock yesterday.
On Friday, however, no one noticed
Arizona State's shabby defense thanks to an
offensive explosion that carried starting
pitcher Kendall Carter to his 45th career

victory, this one an easy six-hit, 12-2 deci
sion. Carter, now 8-0 in 1984, hadn't even
climbed the mound before the Sun Devils
piled up six first-inning runs with the first of
its many two out rallies in the series.
"We just got a good whipping," con
cluded Stanford mentor Mark Marquess.
The Cardinal bounced back on Saturday,
looking as if they would make ASU pay for
every mistake. Ruben Amaro, Jr. got the
first of his three hits on the day opening the
bottom of the first by rifling a double into
the right field corner. Amaro came around
to score when third baseman Bob
Grandstaff turned Rick Lundblade's
double-play grounder into his third error of
the series. Mike Deßenon's sacrifice flv
plated Stanicek to give Stanford a 2-0 lead.
Meanwhile, Stanford's usually effective
ace John Radtke was not, and the Sun
Devils tallied three times in the fourth to
chase Radtke and take a 4-3 lead. But
Kevin Kunkel held the fort in relief until the
ninth when ASU manufactured a run with
out a hit to break a 6-6 tie.
A ninth inning Cardinal rally fizzled when
reliever Doug Henry coaxed John Verducci
to fly to center and then whiffed pinch hitter
Jeff Ballard to end the game. Henry ran his
record to 9-1 witn an impressive five-inning
stint in which he struck out seven Stanford
batters. Kunkel dropped to 2-5 with the
loss.
Yesterday, Arizona State roared to a 7-0
lead after two innings on the strength of a

three-run first off starter Brian Myers and
four runs against his reliever. Ballard, in the
second.
But Ballard stymied the Sun Devils on
four hits the rest of the way and the Car
dinal clawed its way hack into the contest.
Rick Lundblade jumped on Jose Rodiles
first pitch and rocketed it over the 400-foot
sign in dead center field for a three-run
homer in the fifth that sent Rodiles to the
showers and closed the gap to 7-3.
Unfortunately, the rally hastened the ar
rival of ASU's other smoke-throwing
reliever, Dave Gray bill. Gray bill struck out
eight Cards in five innings to gain his fifth
win without a loss.
By the ninth, the Sun Devils were ready
to return toTempc with a 7-5 win — and it
showed, as two errors, a passed ball and a
ground out produced a run that made the
score 7-6 with two out and one man on
base. Again, Ballard came to the plate with
a chance to tie. Graybill chose to pitch
around the lefty and face John Verducci in
stead, who grounded to second base to end
the contest.
Marquess pinpointed his club's basic diffi
culties that led to the sweep and another
narrow defeat. "When our starters don't go
more than three innings we're not going to
beat too many teams. You've got to give
them credit too. They didn't get that record
without being a good solid team."
