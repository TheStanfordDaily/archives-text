# Golfers take sixth; USC wins easily

### GEOFF SANBORN 
On a windy and bitter cold
final day of play, the Stanford
men's golf team skidded to a
sixth place finish in the Stanford
U.S. Intercollegiate, held on
their home course this weekend.
Stanford came into the tourn
ament as the defending cham
pion, and Coach Tim Schaaf had
hoped for "at least a strong
third place finish" from his Car
dinal golfers in order to solidify
the team's shot at an NCAA
tournament bid. What he got
was some unspectacular play
from his key men and a finish
that left him shrugging his
shoulders and looking to "get
ourselves organized for next
week's tournament in Fresno."
The best individual score for
the Cardinal was senior. Jim
Robinson's tic lor seventh place
with a steady tor
Senior Lanny Sawchuck was in a
tie for third place after shooting

73-72 over the first 36 holes,
hut collapsed to an 82 Sunday
afternoon and finished back in
the pack at 227. Junior Doug
Thompson finished at 229, fol
lowed by junior Scott Erickson's
230, sophomore Carl Wagner's
231, and sophomore Josh
Mondry's 242.
In addition, four Stanford
team members played as indi
viduals. Sophomore Don
Walsworth shot 230 over the 54
holes, followed by classmate
Phil Rowley at 235, freshman
Cole Thompson at 245, and
sophomore Doug Monroe with
a 257.
The main topics of conversa
tion at the golf course Sunday
were the weather and the stellar
