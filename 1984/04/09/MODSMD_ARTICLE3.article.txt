# Foothill-De Anza schools seek funding through tax increase
## 
### SAM DELSON Staff writer 
Educators throughout the state will be
watching this area tomorrow as local voters
pass judgment on Measure A, a proposed
property tax increase to benefit the Foothill-
DeAnza Community College District.
If the measure passes, Foothill-DeAnza will
be the first of the state's 70 community college
districts to bolster its funding through a local
tax measure. In that event, other districts are
expected to seek similar support from their
communities.
The measure would provide approximately
$3.6 million per year in local funding for the
district's two community colleges. It would
cost the average homeowner $25 per year in
extra property taxes.
Funds would be used for building construc
tion, maintenance and improvements and for

purchases of books and equipment.
The colleges would not be able to use the
funds to pay for salaries or other general oper
ating expenses.
The measure has been endorsed by many
members of the Stanford community.
University President Donald Kennedy is a
co-author of the pro-measure argument which
appears on the ballot, and Vice Provost
Raymond Bacchetti is a Foothill-DeAnza
trustee and a strong proponent of Measure A.
In addition, three of Stanford's Nobel
laureates — Chemistry Prof. Henry Taube,
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Technical
Director Burton Richter and Economics Prof.
Kenneth Arrow — have endorsed the mea
sure.
The measure needs two-thirds of local
voters approval to pass, and supporters are
cautiously optimistic. A private poll commis

sioned in early February by the principal
sponsor, the Foothill-DeAnza Taxpayers As
sociation. indicated 64 percent support. -
"We're all sitting here on pins and needles
about the two-thirds part," said Associated
Students of Foothill College President Leslie
Fay.
"But if we have a really good GOTV (get
out the vote) effort and get 20.000 to 30,000
people to vote, we can do it."
Fay said years of budget cuts since Proposi
tion 13 was passed in 1978 have left the com
munity colleges in a desperate position.
"The measure is necessary to make up for
what we've lost," she said.
Fay is a full-time student and also works at
a full-time job.
"I wouldn't have gone to college at all with
out the community colleges, because 1
couldn't afford to pay anything," she said.

FoothiiJ-DeAnza Chancellor Thomas Fryer
said he hopes voters realize that the recent
compromise between Gov. Deukmejian and
the legislature did not solve the funding prob
lems of the community colleges.
"The legislature only restored funding to
last year's level, which was 25 percent less per
student than it was five years ago," Fryer said.
"The $50 fee per semester that was added
will raise only $2 million more for this district,
while the elimination of ten local option fees
will cost us $ 1.7 to $ 1.8 million.
"If we lose any students because of the fees,
we'll actually have less money than last year."
When the funding compromise passed in
February, Fryer said, "All the governor did
was prevent immediate cardiac arrest. And in
a way that amounted to jerking us around one

more time.
He said the pro-measure campaign
has succeeded in educating voters
about the colleges' plight.
"We've put out a monumental ef
fort. and 1 think we have a very good
chance to win."
Foothill College President Thomas
Clements said the measure is neces
sary because years of budget cuts have
led to serious problems of outdated
equipment and deteriorating facilities.
"We already have $5 million in
deferred maintenance costs, and the
leaking roofs will only get worse un
less something is done," Clements
said. "We have a lot of gear that needs
to be replaced."
The Foothill-DeAnza Taxpayers
Association has spent $125,000 on an
intensive campaign for the measure.
In contrast, the Libertarian Party of
Santa Clara County and United Tax
payers Inc., the measure's principal
opponents, have spent only $250 on
one small mailing.
Opponents have charged that
Foothill-DeAnza officials have vio
lated the state education code by run
ning pro-measure phone banks from
college facilities and printing a
"Message of Concern" in the Foothill
class schedule.
"They've spent class money and
class time to promote their cam
paign," said Libertarian spokeswoman
Karen Huffman. "That's blatantly ille
gal."
United Taxpayers Director Henry
Severin said his organization con
tacted Santa Clara County District At
torney Leo Himmelsbach Thursday
night to complain about misuse of the
district's offices.

"They're running illegal phone
banks five nights per week from both
campuses," Severin said. "They also
have illegal signs supporting the mea
sure posted all over the schools."
Clements called the charges of ille
gal campaign practices "absolutely
baloney"
"1 hope they won't have any
negative impact, because we haven't
done anything wrong," he said.
"We checked this fully with our at
torneys, and they assured us there's
nothing improper about what we're
doing," Fryer said.
"The college district is paid for the
calls, all of the callers are volunteers
and no calls are made during working
hours.
"The lawyers are haggling over
technicalities of the meaning of two
different sections of the education
code," he said.
Huffman said the Libertarians
oppose the measure because "we dis
agree with any taxation."
She added. "These people are
trying to get others to pay for their
educations."
United Taxpayers member Dean
Sayre criticized the measure's failure
to specify which projects the funds will
be used for.
Sayre criticized what he called "fluff
classes" in "macrame and field trips"
and added, "If they can raise more
than $100,000 to push this through,
why didn't they spend that money on
education?"
Most of the funding for the pro
measure campaign has come from stu
dents and employees of the two col
leges.
Fryer estimated that more than 750
of the district's 950 employees had
contributed a total of $45,000, while
DeAnza's student association added
$25,000 and Foothill students kicked
in more than $10,000.

classes" in "macrame and field trips"
and added, "If they can raise more
than $100,000 to push this through,
why didn't they spend that money on
education?"
Most of the funding for the pro
measure campaign has come from stu
dents and employees of the two col
leges.
Fryer estimated that more than 750
of the district's 950 employees had
contributed a total of $45,000, while
DeAnza's student association added
$25,000 and Foothill students kicked
in more than $10,000.
Educators throughout the state will be
watching this area tomorrow as local voters
pass judgment on Measure A, a proposed
property tax increase to benefit the Foothill-
DeAnza Community College District.
If the measure passes, Foothill-DeAnza will
be the first of the state's 70 community college
districts to bolster its funding through a local
tax measure. In that event, other districts are
expected to seek similar support from their
communities.
The measure would provide approximately
$3.6 million per year in local funding for the
district's two community colleges. It would
cost the average homeowner $25 per year in
extra property taxes.
Funds would be used for building construc
tion, maintenance and improvements and for

purchases of books and equipment.
The colleges would not be able to use the
funds to pay for salaries or other general oper
ating expenses.
The measure has been endorsed by many
members of the Stanford community.
University President Donald Kennedy is a
co-author of the pro-measure argument which
appears on the ballot, and Vice Provost
Raymond Bacchetti is a Foothill-DeAnza
trustee and a strong proponent of Measure A.
In addition, three of Stanford's Nobel
laureates — Chemistry Prof. Henry Taube,
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Technical
Director Burton Richter and Economics Prof.
Kenneth Arrow — have endorsed the mea
sure.
The measure needs two-thirds of local
voters approval to pass, and supporters are
cautiously optimistic. A private poll commis

sioned in early February by the principal
sponsor, the Foothill-DeAnza Taxpayers As
sociation. indicated 64 percent support. -
"We're all sitting here on pins and needles
about the two-thirds part," said Associated
Students of Foothill College President Leslie
Fay.
"But if we have a really good GOTV (get
out the vote) effort and get 20.000 to 30,000
people to vote, we can do it."
Fay said years of budget cuts since Proposi
tion 13 was passed in 1978 have left the com
munity colleges in a desperate position.
"The measure is necessary to make up for
what we've lost," she said.
Fay is a full-time student and also works at
a full-time job.
"I wouldn't have gone to college at all with
out the community colleges, because 1
couldn't afford to pay anything," she said.

FoothiiJ-DeAnza Chancellor Thomas Fryer
said he hopes voters realize that the recent
compromise between Gov. Deukmejian and
the legislature did not solve the funding prob
lems of the community colleges.
"The legislature only restored funding to
last year's level, which was 25 percent less per
student than it was five years ago," Fryer said.
"The $50 fee per semester that was added
will raise only $2 million more for this district,
while the elimination of ten local option fees
will cost us $ 1.7 to $ 1.8 million.
"If we lose any students because of the fees,
we'll actually have less money than last year."
When the funding compromise passed in
February, Fryer said, "All the governor did
was prevent immediate cardiac arrest. And in
a way that amounted to jerking us around one

more time.
He said the pro-measure campaign
has succeeded in educating voters
about the colleges' plight.
"We've put out a monumental ef
fort. and 1 think we have a very good
chance to win."
Foothill College President Thomas
Clements said the measure is neces
sary because years of budget cuts have
led to serious problems of outdated
equipment and deteriorating facilities.
"We already have $5 million in
deferred maintenance costs, and the
leaking roofs will only get worse un
less something is done," Clements
said. "We have a lot of gear that needs
to be replaced."
The Foothill-DeAnza Taxpayers
Association has spent $125,000 on an
intensive campaign for the measure.
In contrast, the Libertarian Party of
Santa Clara County and United Tax
payers Inc., the measure's principal
opponents, have spent only $250 on
one small mailing.
Opponents have charged that
Foothill-DeAnza officials have vio
lated the state education code by run
ning pro-measure phone banks from
college facilities and printing a
"Message of Concern" in the Foothill
class schedule.
"They've spent class money and
class time to promote their cam
paign," said Libertarian spokeswoman
Karen Huffman. "That's blatantly ille
gal."
United Taxpayers Director Henry
Severin said his organization con
tacted Santa Clara County District At
torney Leo Himmelsbach Thursday
night to complain about misuse of the
district's offices.

"They're running illegal phone
banks five nights per week from both
campuses," Severin said. "They also
have illegal signs supporting the mea
sure posted all over the schools."
Clements called the charges of ille
gal campaign practices "absolutely
baloney"
"1 hope they won't have any
negative impact, because we haven't
done anything wrong," he said.
"We checked this fully with our at
torneys, and they assured us there's
nothing improper about what we're
doing," Fryer said.
"The college district is paid for the
calls, all of the callers are volunteers
and no calls are made during working
hours.
"The lawyers are haggling over
technicalities of the meaning of two
different sections of the education
code," he said.
Huffman said the Libertarians
oppose the measure because "we dis
agree with any taxation."
She added. "These people are
trying to get others to pay for their
educations."
United Taxpayers member Dean
Sayre criticized the measure's failure
to specify which projects the funds will
be used for.

and added, "If they can raise more
