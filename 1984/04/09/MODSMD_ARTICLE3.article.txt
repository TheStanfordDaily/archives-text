# Foothill-De Anza schools seek funding through tax increase
## 
### SAM DELSON Staff writer 
Educators throughout the state will be
watching this area tomorrow as local voters
pass judgment on Measure A, a proposed
property tax increase to benefit the Foothill-
DeAnza Community College District.
If the measure passes, Foothill-DeAnza will
be the first of the state's 70 community college
districts to bolster its funding through a local
tax measure. In that event, other districts are
expected to seek similar support from their
communities.
The measure would provide approximately
$3.6 million per year in local funding for the
district's two community colleges. It would
cost the average homeowner $25 per year in
extra property taxes.
Funds would be used for building construc
tion, maintenance and improvements and for

purchases of books and equipment.
The colleges would not be able to use the
funds to pay for salaries or other general oper
ating expenses.
The measure has been endorsed by many
members of the Stanford community.
University President Donald Kennedy is a
co-author of the pro-measure argument which
appears on the ballot, and Vice Provost
Raymond Bacchetti is a Foothill-DeAnza
trustee and a strong proponent of Measure A.
In addition, three of Stanford's Nobel
laureates — Chemistry Prof. Henry Taube,
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Technical
Director Burton Richter and Economics Prof.
Kenneth Arrow — have endorsed the mea
sure.
The measure needs two-thirds of local
voters approval to pass, and supporters are
cautiously optimistic. A private poll commis

sioned in early February by the principal
sponsor, the Foothill-DeAnza Taxpayers As
sociation. indicated 64 percent support. -
"We're all sitting here on pins and needles
about the two-thirds part," said Associated
Students of Foothill College President Leslie
Fay.
"But if we have a really good GOTV (get
out the vote) effort and get 20.000 to 30,000
people to vote, we can do it."
Fay said years of budget cuts since Proposi
tion 13 was passed in 1978 have left the com
munity colleges in a desperate position.
"The measure is necessary to make up for
what we've lost," she said.
Fay is a full-time student and also works at
a full-time job.
"I wouldn't have gone to college at all with
out the community colleges, because 1
couldn't afford to pay anything," she said.

FoothiiJ-DeAnza Chancellor Thomas Fryer
said he hopes voters realize that the recent
compromise between Gov. Deukmejian and
the legislature did not solve the funding prob
lems of the community colleges.
"The legislature only restored funding to
last year's level, which was 25 percent less per
student than it was five years ago," Fryer said.
"The $50 fee per semester that was added
will raise only $2 million more for this district,
while the elimination of ten local option fees
will cost us $ 1.7 to $ 1.8 million.
"If we lose any students because of the fees,
we'll actually have less money than last year."
When the funding compromise passed in
February, Fryer said, "All the governor did
was prevent immediate cardiac arrest. And in
a way that amounted to jerking us around one
