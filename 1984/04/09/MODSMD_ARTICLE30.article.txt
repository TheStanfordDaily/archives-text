# Card playoff hopes spiked
## 
### TRASK LEONARD 
The men's volleyball team barely had time to
recover from a painful loss to USC on Wednesday
when it again went down to defeat to Long Beach
State on Friday 3-0.
The loss dropped Stanford's record to 12-13
overall and 4-10 in the California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association (CIVA), eliminating the
Cardinal from any playoff hopes at all.
From the outset the team had to climb uphill, as
it opened the first game down 10-0. It played the
49ers even for the rest of the game, but the
opening lapse was too much to overcome, and
Stanford lost 15-6.
"We just couldn't get things going the first part
of the first game," said Asst. Coach Don Shaw.
"We played them even the rest of the game."
Long Beach, led by senior Greg Maxwell, had a
tremendous 50 percent success rate in its at
tempted spikes in the first game, compared to 35
percent for the Cardinal.
Things were different in the second game, as
Stanford fought the 49ers tough, remaining only
two or three points down most of the way. Still,
the game ended with the 49ers on top, 15-11.
In the final game. Stanford started off hesitantly
and was down 5-0. The Cardinal struggled back to
tic the game at 8-8, led by the serving of freshman
Stephen Blue. However, on the way to overcom
ing the 49ers, a surprising call by the officials
seemed to halt the team's momentum.

"We felt that the call by the referee was just
very odd," said" Stanford's Jon Root. "When it
happened, we were closing in on them, but we just
lost our spark after the bad call, and gave up the
last few points very easily."
The call which upset the Stanford pkiyers oc
curred just as the Cardinal was fighting back, with
the score of the third game 11-9 in favor of the
49ers On an attempted block of . Be ch
spike, two Cardinal blockers were whistled tor a
mishandled ball, a very unusual call on such a
play.
"We were just shocked at that call," Shaw said.
"1 know the official who made it, and 1 expect bet
ter of him. It came at such an inopportune time
for us, as we were doing really well after a
mediocre start in the game. It just took the wind
out of our sails.
"But a lot of calls went against them as well, so
it's no excuse for our play." Shaw continued.
Stanford was led by Root and Brett Monello,
who accounted for 28 of the team's 50 kills. Knot
was high with a 47 percent kill success.
With the chances tor a playoff berth lost, the
spikers must now play the spoiler role and try *
eliminate others from a post season opponuniv.
And. as Shaw observed, the future looks very <v
for the Cardinal.
"We're still a very young team with u hing way
to go. We've got no graduating seniors, and tons
of freshmen," Shaw said.

At least senior center fielder Darryl Stephens made some contact with the ball on this at-bat.
The rest of the Cardinal had trouble doing the same as it dropped three straight home games
to Arizona State. . •
