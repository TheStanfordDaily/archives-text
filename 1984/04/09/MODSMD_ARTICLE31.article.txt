# Smith qualifies for Olympic Trials
## Records run amok at track meet 
### RICK BILODEAU 
Stanford was the site of a
multitude of stellar track and
,k Id performances this weekend
is UC-Berkeley, Washington
State, San Jose State and USC
«!s well as the Washington State
and Tennesee women's squads,
came to the University.
While most of the action was
taking place within Stanford
Stadium, however, the best per
formance was at Angell Field,

where the hammer throw was
contested.
Juha Fiainen of Finland, com
peting in a special hammer
throw meet after the collegiate
contest, threw the 16-pound
ball and chain 264 feet 6 inches,
the best throw ever on Ameri
can soil.
Fiainen is no stranger to long
throws, having to his credit a
265' 10" inch heave, which is
the longest throw ever by a non-

Soviet. His toss yesterday was
also the longest hammer throw
in the world this \ear.
In the collegiate hammer
throw. K.jell Bystedt of Sweden
and San Jose State, did some
record-breaking of his own. His
winning effort of 244' 10" set a
new Swedish record. Ironically
it was Bystedt's U.S. soil record
which Fiainen later broke.
Placing second in the col
legiate hammer throw was Stan

ford's Shaun Pickering, who im
proved his own school record
with a 225' 1" throw.
A national standard also fell
in the men's shot put as Wash
ington State's Dimitrios Kout
soukis set a new Greek record
with a 67' 3 I 4" effort. T he
throw was two feet farther than
koutsoukis' previous best.
The women's weight events
were dominated by by Stan
ford's Carol Cady, who threw
her way to double victories in
the shot put and discus. Cady,
last year's NCAA shot put
champion, put away that event
with a throw o! 54' 6 3/4 and
then moved on to the discus,
where she spun to a 194' 8" ef
fort, tops among collegiate
throwers this year. These marks
are even more impressive when
one considers that the Stnaford
senior is only six weeks returned
from painful foot injury.
Excellent marks were not
restricted to the weight events,
as several runners, particularly
in the distance events turned in
fine performances.
In the women's 3000-meter
run, Stanford's Patti Sue Plumer
and Athletics West's Brenda
Webb ran stride for stride the
entire race before Webb surged
in the last 20 yards to nip
Plumer at the finish. Webb's
9:04.2 is the fastest American
clocking this year, while
Plumer's 9:04.3 is the best col
legiate time this year.
Plumer, not satisfied with one
leading mark, returned later in
the day to set another, this time
in the 5000. Running ahead ot
the field with teammate Alison
Wiley, Plumer clocked in at
10:13 for the first two miles.
Then she quickly pulled away
from sophomore Wiley, running
a 5:03 third mile and finishing in
a personal-best, collegiate
leading 15:47.3.
The star in the men's distance
events was Washington States'
Julius Korir, who easily won
both the 3000-meter
steeplechase and the 5000-
meter run. His time in the
former, 8:24.7, is a Stanford
Stadium record as well as the
year's fastest time in the world
for that event.
In the 5000, Korir easily out
distanced teammate Peter

Keock tor a leisurely 13:50.1
victory. Kori.. only a sopho
more. placed in both of these
events at last year's NCAA
Championships.
In the men's 1500 Omar Or
tega, also of Washington State,
led from 400 meters on to take
first in 3:40.8, a new national
record for the native of Argen
tina. Placing third was Cardinal
Jim Smith, whose 3:42.1 broke
Ernie Cunliffe's long-standing
school record of 3:42.2. The
time also qualified Smith for the
Olympic Trials by one tenth of a
second. Other Cardinals
already qualified for the trials
include Plumer in the 3000 and
Cady in the shot put and discus.
Although the sprints, which
were run into a slight wind, did
not provide any exemplary
times, good performances were
turned by I JSC's Darwin Cook
and Tennesee's Mary Bolden.
Cook, a seventh-place finisher
in last year's NCAA 100-meter
run. easily took first in both the
100 and 200, clocking times of
10.51 and 20.95 respectively.
Bolden. one of last year's fastest
high school sprinters, also com
pleted the same sprint double in
12.08 and 24.07.
In the vertical jumps there
was some excitement as assaults
were made on both the stadium
pole vault and high jump
records. Felix Bohni, the 1983
NCAA pole vault champion
from San Jose State, failed three
times at 18' 1 1/4" after winning
the competition with a 17' 6"
clearance. Brent Harken, after
taking the Pacific-10 Confer
ence lead in the high jump with
a 7' 4 1/2" effort, set the bar at
7' 7" but failed as well.
In the team competition, USC
defeated Stanford 90-62, while
Cal outscored San Jose State
86-77. The women's meet was
not scored.
Although Washington State
wasn't officially scored as a
team, it was obvious to every
one present that the Cougars
were the dominating team.
Washington State athletes won
eleven of the nineteen events.
So adding four victories to the
WSU record, the Cougars, the
top dual-meet school in the na
tion last year, have 44 con
secutive victories and onlv nine
losses in the last 11 years.

Stanford senior lim Smith (right) proved that third is sometimes just as good as first. Smith

lJls by a narrow one-tenth of a second margin.

and Tennesee's Mary Bolden.
Cook, a seventh-place finisher
in last year's NCAA 100-meter
run. easily took first in both the
100 and 200, clocking times of
10.51 and 20.95 respectively.
Bolden. one of last year's fastest
high school sprinters, also com
pleted the same sprint double in
12.08 and 24.07.
In the vertical jumps there
was some excitement as assaults
were made on both the stadium
pole vault and high jump
records. Felix Bohni, the 1983
NCAA pole vault champion
from San Jose State, failed three
times at 18' 1 1/4" after winning
the competition with a 17' 6"
clearance. Brent Harken, after
taking the Pacific-10 Confer
ence lead in the high jump with
a 7' 4 1/2" effort, set the bar at
7' 7" but failed as well.
In the team competition, USC
defeated Stanford 90-62, while
Cal outscored San Jose State
86-77. The women's meet was
not scored.
Although Washington State
wasn't officially scored as a
team, it was obvious to every
one present that the Cougars
were the dominating team.
Washington State athletes won
eleven of the nineteen events.
So adding four victories to the
WSU record, the Cougars, the
top dual-meet school in the na
tion last year, have 44 con
secutive victories and onlv nine
losses in the last 11 years.

Stanford senior lim Smith (right) proved that third is sometimes just as good as first. Smith
hroLr the school rccord in the 1500 meter and in fhe process qualified for the Olympic Tri
lJls by a narrow one-tenth of a second margin.
Stanford was the site of a
multitude of stellar track and
,k Id performances this weekend
is UC-Berkeley, Washington
State, San Jose State and USC
«!s well as the Washington State
and Tennesee women's squads,
came to the University.
While most of the action was
taking place within Stanford
Stadium, however, the best per
formance was at Angell Field,

where the hammer throw was
contested.
Juha Fiainen of Finland, com
peting in a special hammer
throw meet after the collegiate
contest, threw the 16-pound
ball and chain 264 feet 6 inches,
the best throw ever on Ameri
can soil.
Fiainen is no stranger to long
throws, having to his credit a
265' 10" inch heave, which is
the longest throw ever by a non-

Soviet. His toss yesterday was
also the longest hammer throw
in the world this \ear.
In the collegiate hammer
throw. K.jell Bystedt of Sweden
and San Jose State, did some
record-breaking of his own. His
winning effort of 244' 10" set a
new Swedish record. Ironically
it was Bystedt's U.S. soil record
which Fiainen later broke.
Placing second in the col
legiate hammer throw was Stan

ford's Shaun Pickering, who im
proved his own school record
with a 225' 1" throw.
A national standard also fell
in the men's shot put as Wash
ington State's Dimitrios Kout
soukis set a new Greek record
with a 67' 3 I 4" effort. T he
throw was two feet farther than
koutsoukis' previous best.
The women's weight events
were dominated by by Stan
ford's Carol Cady, who threw
her way to double victories in
the shot put and discus. Cady,
last year's NCAA shot put
champion, put away that event
with a throw o! 54' 6 3/4 and
then moved on to the discus,
where she spun to a 194' 8" ef
fort, tops among collegiate
throwers this year. These marks
are even more impressive when
one considers that the Stnaford
senior is only six weeks returned
from painful foot injury.
Excellent marks were not
restricted to the weight events,
as several runners, particularly
in the distance events turned in
fine performances.
In the women's 3000-meter
run, Stanford's Patti Sue Plumer
and Athletics West's Brenda
Webb ran stride for stride the
entire race before Webb surged
in the last 20 yards to nip
Plumer at the finish. Webb's
9:04.2 is the fastest American
clocking this year, while
Plumer's 9:04.3 is the best col
legiate time this year.
Plumer, not satisfied with one
leading mark, returned later in
the day to set another, this time
in the 5000. Running ahead ot
the field with teammate Alison
Wiley, Plumer clocked in at
10:13 for the first two miles.
Then she quickly pulled away
from sophomore Wiley, running
a 5:03 third mile and finishing in
a personal-best, collegiate
leading 15:47.3.
The star in the men's distance
events was Washington States'
Julius Korir, who easily won
both the 3000-meter
steeplechase and the 5000-
meter run. His time in the
former, 8:24.7, is a Stanford
Stadium record as well as the
year's fastest time in the world
for that event.
In the 5000, Korir easily out
distanced teammate Peter

Keock tor a leisurely 13:50.1
victory. Kori.. only a sopho
more. placed in both of these
events at last year's NCAA
Championships.
In the men's 1500 Omar Or
tega, also of Washington State,
led from 400 meters on to take
first in 3:40.8, a new national
record for the native of Argen
tina. Placing third was Cardinal
Jim Smith, whose 3:42.1 broke
Ernie Cunliffe's long-standing
school record of 3:42.2. The
time also qualified Smith for the
Olympic Trials by one tenth of a
second. Other Cardinals
already qualified for the trials
include Plumer in the 3000 and
Cady in the shot put and discus.
Although the sprints, which
were run into a slight wind, did
not provide any exemplary
times, good performances were
turned by I JSC's Darwin Cook
and Tennesee's Mary Bolden.
Cook, a seventh-place finisher
in last year's NCAA 100-meter
run. easily took first in both the
100 and 200, clocking times of
