# Netmen sweep but get some surprises

### TOM CLIFFORD 
Although the final result
was familiar, the weekend
was full of surprises for the
Stanford men's tennis team
in Arizona. After clobbering
a good University of Arizona
team 9-0. the team struggled
to finally defeat defeat
Arizona State University 7-
2.
On Friday afternoon
against Arizona, the top
three singles cruised to vic
tory. Stanford's top-seed
Dan Goldie had an ap
parently easy time defeating
the nation's No. 4-ranked
singles player, Paul Cham
berlin, 6-1, 6-2.
Chamberlin is an ag
gressive player, but Goldie's
effective passing shot kept
him off balance throughout
the match. On the No. 2
court, Stanford's Eric Rosen
feld breezed by Arizona's
Randy Vigmostad 6-3, 6-1,
as Rosenfeld took control of

the match early and never let
up. His play typified the
team's play as the Cardinal
lost only one set all after
noon.
After drubbing this strong
Arizona team, the Cardinal
lost some of its intensity and
faced some tough matches
from the ASU Sun Devils on
Saturday. Head Coach Dick
Gould was quick to praise
ASU: "I think they did a
great job. They deserve a lot
of credit."
Goldie beat Keith
Thomas, a freshman at ASU,
6-4, 7-6. Gould explained
why the match was so close
after Goldie's stunning vic
tory the day before. "We
were just generally flat
toady. Danny got his
(service) break early. Then
he just coasted."
Rosenfeld beat Alex Levie
in straight sets, but both went

to a tie-breaker ending with a 7-
6, 7-6 match. "Eric let his serve
get away from him,"Gould said.
"He's got a good serve, but
(Saturday) he was giving up a
lot of points by double
faulting."
Stanford freshman Derrick
Rostagno also had a difficult
match. After winning the first
set 7-5, he eventually lost the
next two 5-7,4-6. Gould noted
that Rostagno may still be af

fected by the broken jaw he suf
fered earlier this year. "1 may be
bringing him back a little too
soon. But still he's a tremen
dously talented athelete. Today
he just had to struggle a little
bit."
Gould's main worry lies with
the doubles teams. "We lacked
intensity. There was an in
finitesimal let up. (Jim) Grabb
and (John) Letts were up two
breaks and they let it slip away.
They should have won it 6-2,
but they ended up losing 5-7."
ASU's Jim Baumann and Alex
Levie eventuallv won the match
7-5,1-6,6-2.
