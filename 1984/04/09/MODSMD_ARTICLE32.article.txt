was familiar, the weekend

Stanford men's tennis team

lost only one set all after

Arizona team, the Cardinal

(service) break early. Then
he just coasted."
Rosenfeld beat Alex Levie
in straight sets, but both went

Arizona State, but senior captain Mark McKeen is at the
"top of his game," according to Coach Dick Gould.
