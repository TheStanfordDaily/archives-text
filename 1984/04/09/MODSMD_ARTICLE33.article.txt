# Women get close 5-4 victory
## Netters finally win at USC 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis team knew it
wasn t facing an easy task Saturday afternoon.
I he Cardinal was in Los Angeles to face USC at
home, where the Trojans had won 94 of their last
95 matches and where Stanford hadn't won in the
live years that Head Coach Frank Brennan has
been on the Farm.
The netters responded to the challenge with an
as-close-as-they-come 5-4 victory. Stanford
opened a 4-2 lead in the singles matches hut
needed a second doubles victory from Kate Gom
pert and Michelle Weiss to lock up the victory.
Gompert and Weiss had no trouble clinching
the match, quickly recording a 6-3, 6-1 victory.
The other doubles teams had slightly more diffi
culty. Patty Fendick and Leigh Anne Eldredge fell
to USCs Susan Pendo and Kelly Henry, 6-2, 7-6,
at No. 1, and Linda Gates and Stephanie Savides
lost a close 3-6, 7-6, 6-4 decision to Heliana
Steden and Anna Fernandez.
The singles matches gave the Card the victory.
Fendick opened with a 6-1, 2-6, 7-5 win over
Henry at No. 1. It was a big win for the freshman,
who came into the match ranked No. 3 in the na
tion, as Henry has been in the top five nationally
during her four years at USC.
Gates had an easy time with Steden — also a
highly regarded player — at No. 2, recording a
straight-set, 6-4, 6-2 triumph. Gates had come

into the match ranked fourth in the country.
Gompert completed the Stanford sweep of the
first three singles matches by defeating Cheryl
Jones at No. 3, 7-6, 6-1. Playing at No. 6, Savides
gave Stanford the lead by putting away Carol
Heynen in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4.
The Cardinal two singles losses came at the No.
4 and 5 positions. Eldredge played a tough match,
losing the first set in a tie-breaker as she lost to
Fernandez, 7-6, 6-4. Weiss also had a close
match, but she succumbed to Pendo, 6-4, 6-4.
The win was Stanford's 15th straight and with
out a doubt reinforced the Cardinal's No. 1 na
tional ranking. Stanford is now 9-0 in the WCAA.
The road doesn't get any easier for the netters.
They move down the coast today to San Diego
State for a match against the Aztecs. When the
two teams met on the Farm March 12, the Car
dinal won 6-3. Brennan, however, knows that
playing in San Diego may be a different story.
"They usually have a very good crowd," he
said. "We won a couple of very close matches up
here that could have gone the other way, so we're
going to have to play well."
Those two matches were won by Gates and
Gompert. Gates edged past Linda Howell in a
thrilling match, 6-3, 6-7, 6-4, while Gompert
staved off a pair of set points in the first set and
went on to defeat Cathy Berry, 7-5, 6-3.
