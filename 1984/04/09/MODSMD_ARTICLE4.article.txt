# Task Force cites DU misbehavior
## 
### HEATHER WRIGHT Staff writer 
The minutes of the Task Force to Study Fraternities and
Sororities, while somewhat uncontroversial, single out the
behavior of the Delta Upsilons.
The minutes, which record the self-impressions and ob
jectives of individual fraternities and sororities gathered
during scheduled meetings, state that some members ot
the task force subcommittee visiting the DU house two
months ago felt unwelcome. Ihe subcommittee cited
"sarcastic side comments'and "rough-housing with a can
of whipping cream" during that meeting.
The report also states that in response to a question con
cerning the advantages and disadvantages ot living apart
from women the first response was "a derogatory sexual
joke and another member stated that tirst ol all he never
used the word 'women', and that the girls who would so
cialize with them at the fraternity were not the type ol
'girls' they would want to go out with.
The task force wrote that "the behavior was obviously a
group response" and that individually the DUs might have
behaved differently, adding that this description ot the
DUs would have been "uncharacteristic five years ago."

Business School Prof. Oscar Serbein, task force chair
man and professor of insurance, said the report speaks for
itself. He said that the group visiting the DUs "received a
particular impression and reported that impression." He
also said that the DUs had not made any efforts to amend
the bad review they received.
But DU President Luke Cole said, "I think the minutes
of the Task Force reflect a fundamental misperception and
misrepresentation of the DU house, and I am writing a
formal letter of protest to the commission.
"The minutes contain factual errors and statements
misquoted or taken out of context; it is my understanding
that the unrevised minutes misconstrued to an even
greater degree our behavior, goals and beliefs as a frater
nity." Cole explained.
Cole said that in addition to writing a formal letter, he
has met with Row Director Diana Conklin and addressed
the Task Force Committee earlier this week in order to
dispel what lie considers a grave injustice.
"1 feel very strongly that we were given the shaft in the
original, unrevised version of the minutes, and only
slitzhtlv less so in the released version." he said.
