# Rush alcohol policy tightened

### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
The Inter-Fraternity Council"
(IFC) plans to enforce stricter com
pliance of rules requiring frater
nities to de-emphasize alchohol
consumption during rush activities
which start today.
The increased concern over al
chohol use by the IFC appears to
be motivated by a genuine concern
by fraternity members and pressure
from Residential Education to les
sen alchohol's role.
Among the most noted rules is
the one most recently added, which
states that failure to comply with
IFC's rules will result in "prompt
action by the IFC Judicial Commit
tee." including possible suspension
of all alcohol privileges for rumain
ing rush functions for any group

found in violation of their laws, ac
cording to an IFC directive circ
ulated to all fraternities.
"Better attention is being
focused on the role of alcohol, and
the IFC's actions to de-emphasize
alcohol in rush is definitely a good
thing." said James Lyons, dean of
student affairs.
The decision whether to have a
"wet" or "dry" rush falls on each

separate fraternity for themselves,
according to Lyons.
"The business of rush is to help
people make choices," Lyons said.
"The individuals as well as the
groups need their wits about them
to be able to make important deci
sions, and the . overuse of alcohol
can get in the way."
"We're definitely cracking down
and being much stricter where our
rules about alcohol's involvment in
rush are concerned," said Steve
Pierce, IFC president. "We'll be
enforcing the nine previously exist
ing rules, and especially the most
recently added tenth rule about
reprimanding a fraternity if it fails
to comply with the IFCs rules.
"We've taken several measures

to make people more aware of our
rules which have been in existence for
at least three years, but which only the
rush chairmen from each house and
IFC members have ever really known
about," Pierce said.
The IFC's first move was to hold a
number of freshmen forums dealing
with all of the aspects surrounding
rush.
"We want to take the mystery out of
rush. For many freshmen, all they
know about fraternities is what
they've seen in movies like Animal
House. We tried to inform them how
the Stanford system is different than
most, to downgrade the image of
drunkards at parties and to put them
at ease about the rushing system in
general," Pierce said.
The IFC has also informed each
fraternity about the monitoring
process.
"We've gone to dinner at each ot
the fraternities and explained that
there will be four to five IFC rush
chairmen circulating through the open
houses at any given time who will be
checking to see that there are no rule
violations," Pierce said.
If and when a violation is noted by
an IFC chairman, he will immediately
locate the group's own rush chairman
and allow him 15 minutes to correct
the violation. If the situation is not im
mediately changed, the group may
lose its alcohol privileges for remain
ing rush functions and face social
probation.
"The IFC chairmen will have name
tags on and be very visible," Pierce
noted. "We're not trying to scare
anyone, rather we're simply trying to
help prevent violations.

"Not all fraternity members see
these policies the same way the IFC
does," said Todd Kerr. IFC vice presi
dent. "A lot of people feel that to
make their house attractive, it's got to
he all fun and alcohol. It would he
two-faced to present fraternities as'so
one-sided, though. There's a much
more serious business-oriented side as
well."
Delta Upsilon President Luke Cole
said, "There very well might be some
flagrant violations of the rules simply
because people often want to party
beyond set guidelines. I think most
people will realize the importance of
these rules and abide by them,
however."
"If there are any major problems
with rush this year, then dry rush
could become a real possibility. Such a
move would depend also on what the
Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities comes up with in their
policy decisions this June," Pierce
said.
According to Lyons, Stanford main
tains one of the few remaining frater
nity systems that still conducts a wet
rush.
Pierce stated, "Any move for dry
rush should come with a University
wide policy concerning alcohol usage,
and not until. It would be almost dis
criminatory against fraternities to in
sist on dry rush now. since all other
groups are allowed to use alcohol in
any way they wish."
All sororities presently hold dry
rushes.
President of the Kappa Alpha Theta
sorority Allison Lutz said, "Although
alcohol is used to create a more infor
mal atmosphere during fraternity
rush, it has never been used by Stan
ford sororities. We like to think that
alcohol isn't necessary for us to still
hold successful rushes."
