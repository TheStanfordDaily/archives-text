Shuttle unable to catch satellite
( ape Canaveral, I 'la. — Spacewalker George Nelson failed
yesterday in three daring attempts to retrieve a costly but
crippled satellite for repairs in space, and officials said the
shuttle crew will make one last try today to grab it with a
robot arm.
"1 omorrow is our day to succeed or not to succeed" to get
the Solar Max satellite into the shuttle's cargo bay for repairs,
said flight director Jay Greene.
T he new plan to snare the satellite depended on efforts by
engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland to
stabilize the satellite with commands to its computers but in
late afternoon yesterday a spokesman announced:
"The bad news is we haven't been able to do anything of
significance to stop the tumbling of the spacecraft as of right
now."
Jim Elliott added, Ihe general feeling in the Payload
Operations Control Center here is that things don't look too
good. We're going to need a lot of luck."
At the time, the satellite had a minimum of two hours of
battery power left. Its electricity-producing solar panels were
rendered ineffective by its tumbling. Electricity is needed to
power coils around bars that act as a compass to steady the
satellite. '*
The Solar Max repair was the main purpose of the 11th
space shuttle flight. Another part of the mission, deploying an
11-ton cylinder loaded with experiments for a 10-month stay
in space, was conducted without a hitch Saturday.
U.S. should aid Soviet defectors
Washington —The United States should join its allies in
setting up an "underground railroad" to transport to asylum
in the West Soviet soldiers who have defected to anti-Soviet
guerrillas in Afghanistan, a staff study by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee urged yesterday.
Warning that the prisoners, perhaps numbering as high as
250, run the risk of death either from Soviet bombing or from
the "moujahedeen" resistance fighters themselves, the com
mittee report argued that offering sanctuary to prisoners who
in many cases want to escape to the West would serve West
ern interests and embarrass the Soviets in several ways. It
would:
• "Encourage further defections, with consequent
deleterious effects on the Soviet war effort."
• "Demonstrate Western determination not to let the Af
ghan issue subside in the international arena."
• "Maintain a higher profile for the war in world public
opinion."
• "Save the lives of scores of Soviet soldiers who were un
willingly sucked into the Kremlin's war in Afghanistan and
made to pay the price for its adventurism."
• "Lift from the moujahedeen the burden of maintaining
and protecting Soviet prisoners."
• "Remove a potential source of embarrassment to Pakis
tan arising from the presence of Soviet prisoners in their bor
der areas."
Jackson disavows threatening
statements, but not Farrakhan
Philadelphia — Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson disassociated himself yesterday from threatening
statements made by Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan
but refused to disavow Farrakhan's political support.
Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Jackson termed
Ftirrakh.m's threats aijajnst Washington Post reporter Milton
Coleman r 'a bit inciting and distasteful." But when asked
whether he would repudiate Farrakhan. a visibly irritated
Jackson said. "I'm not going to do that. I don't think it's fair
for you to attempt to make me do that."
Jackson tried to deal with other issues during the interview
but was drawn back repeatedly by questions about Farrak
han, the religious leader who has strongly supported Jackson,
spoken widely on his behalf and provided bodyguards for
him. At one point Jackson complained that the interviewers
were harassing him.
After the program, Jackson said the continuous question
ing by the media over the Farrakhan issue was an effort to
"make me guilty by association."
During the interview, he said, "to spend the time on this
program, when 1 want to talk about, if 1 might, industrial
policy to put people back to work, or an African policy . . ~ I
think to continue to raise this issue is overspending my
time .... Your continuously raising it now is a form of har
assment."
In a recent radio speech to followers, Farrakham accused
Coleman of having betrayed blacks by disclosing that Jackson
called Jews "Hymie" and New York "Hymietown." Farrak
han said on the radio that "one day soon we will punish you
with death." but has since said he was not directing that com
ment at Coleman.
Mondale promises to keep
Three Mile Island closed
Middletown, Pa. — At the gates to the shuttered Three
Mile Island nuclear power plant, former Vice President Wal
ter Mondale declared yesterday that the reactors in the con
troversial complex would not be restarted if he were presi
dent.
His pledge came in answer to questions and constituted a
considerably stronger stance than he had previously taken on
the matter.
"If I am president of the United States, I guarantee you it
won't open again," Mondale said when he was pressed to be
more specific about the issue of restarting one of the units in
the plant, which has been shut down since 1979.
The plant was the site of the most serious accident in the
history of commercial nuclear power.
For four-and-a-half years Metropolitan Edison Co. has
been pressing for permission to restart Three Mile Island's
Unit No. 1, which was undamaged in the March 1979 acci
dent at Unit No. 2, where a breakdown threatened a massive
release of radioactivity.
Unmanned plane in jeopardy
Washington — Production of the Army's new drone
airplane, already more than two years behind schedule and
nearly $2 billion over budget, should be delayed until fiscal
1986 because of persistent uncertainty about the craft's per
formance, a General Accounting Office study released last
week concluded.
Because most of the critical flight testing on the drone,
known officially as a remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), has yet
to take place, "it may not be prudent to ask the Congress to
provide production funds" until next spring, a year later than
the Army hopes, the GAO said.
If Congress heeds its watchdog agency's recommendation,
the delay will be the latest in a long string of setbacks for the
RPV, which has been under development since 1974.
Originally expected to be $563 million, the drone's price tag
is up to $2.4 billion. "It is too early to estimate how much
higher costs will rise, but the potential exists for substantial
increases," the study said.
The RPV is intended "to give the Army a capability that it
now lacks" by identifying targets and directing artillery fire
with a laser beam from a small, pilotless plane cruising a mile
above enemy territory. Launched by catapult and retrieved
with a large vertical net. the drone carries a television camera
that allows artillery spotters to seek and home in on targets.

Unmanned plane in jeopardy
Washington — Production of the Army's new drone
airplane, already more than two years behind schedule and
nearly $2 billion over budget, should be delayed until fiscal
1986 because of persistent uncertainty about the craft's per
formance, a General Accounting Office study released last
week concluded.
Because most of the critical flight testing on the drone,
known officially as a remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), has yet
to take place, "it may not be prudent to ask the Congress to
provide production funds" until next spring, a year later than
the Army hopes, the GAO said.
If Congress heeds its watchdog agency's recommendation,
the delay will be the latest in a long string of setbacks for the
RPV, which has been under development since 1974.
Originally expected to be $563 million, the drone's price tag
is up to $2.4 billion. "It is too early to estimate how much
higher costs will rise, but the potential exists for substantial
increases," the study said.
The RPV is intended "to give the Army a capability that it
now lacks" by identifying targets and directing artillery fire
with a laser beam from a small, pilotless plane cruising a mile
above enemy territory. Launched by catapult and retrieved
with a large vertical net. the drone carries a television camera
that allows artillery spotters to seek and home in on targets.

Shuttle unable to catch satellite
( ape Canaveral, I 'la. — Spacewalker George Nelson failed
yesterday in three daring attempts to retrieve a costly but
crippled satellite for repairs in space, and officials said the
shuttle crew will make one last try today to grab it with a
robot arm.
"1 omorrow is our day to succeed or not to succeed" to get
the Solar Max satellite into the shuttle's cargo bay for repairs,
said flight director Jay Greene.
T he new plan to snare the satellite depended on efforts by
engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland to
stabilize the satellite with commands to its computers but in
late afternoon yesterday a spokesman announced:
"The bad news is we haven't been able to do anything of
significance to stop the tumbling of the spacecraft as of right
now."
Jim Elliott added, Ihe general feeling in the Payload
Operations Control Center here is that things don't look too
good. We're going to need a lot of luck."
At the time, the satellite had a minimum of two hours of
battery power left. Its electricity-producing solar panels were
rendered ineffective by its tumbling. Electricity is needed to
power coils around bars that act as a compass to steady the
satellite. '*
The Solar Max repair was the main purpose of the 11th
space shuttle flight. Another part of the mission, deploying an
11-ton cylinder loaded with experiments for a 10-month stay
in space, was conducted without a hitch Saturday.
U.S. should aid Soviet defectors
Washington —The United States should join its allies in
setting up an "underground railroad" to transport to asylum
in the West Soviet soldiers who have defected to anti-Soviet
guerrillas in Afghanistan, a staff study by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee urged yesterday.
Warning that the prisoners, perhaps numbering as high as
250, run the risk of death either from Soviet bombing or from
the "moujahedeen" resistance fighters themselves, the com
mittee report argued that offering sanctuary to prisoners who
in many cases want to escape to the West would serve West
ern interests and embarrass the Soviets in several ways. It
would:
• "Encourage further defections, with consequent
deleterious effects on the Soviet war effort."
• "Demonstrate Western determination not to let the Af
ghan issue subside in the international arena."
• "Maintain a higher profile for the war in world public
opinion."
• "Save the lives of scores of Soviet soldiers who were un
willingly sucked into the Kremlin's war in Afghanistan and
made to pay the price for its adventurism."
• "Lift from the moujahedeen the burden of maintaining
and protecting Soviet prisoners."
• "Remove a potential source of embarrassment to Pakis
tan arising from the presence of Soviet prisoners in their bor
der areas."
Jackson disavows threatening
statements, but not Farrakhan
Philadelphia — Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson disassociated himself yesterday from threatening
statements made by Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan
but refused to disavow Farrakhan's political support.
Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Jackson termed
Ftirrakh.m's threats aijajnst Washington Post reporter Milton
Coleman r 'a bit inciting and distasteful." But when asked
whether he would repudiate Farrakhan. a visibly irritated
Jackson said. "I'm not going to do that. I don't think it's fair
for you to attempt to make me do that."
Jackson tried to deal with other issues during the interview
but was drawn back repeatedly by questions about Farrak
han, the religious leader who has strongly supported Jackson,
spoken widely on his behalf and provided bodyguards for
him. At one point Jackson complained that the interviewers
were harassing him.
After the program, Jackson said the continuous question
ing by the media over the Farrakhan issue was an effort to
"make me guilty by association."
During the interview, he said, "to spend the time on this
program, when 1 want to talk about, if 1 might, industrial
policy to put people back to work, or an African policy . . ~ I
think to continue to raise this issue is overspending my
time .... Your continuously raising it now is a form of har
assment."
In a recent radio speech to followers, Farrakham accused
Coleman of having betrayed blacks by disclosing that Jackson
called Jews "Hymie" and New York "Hymietown." Farrak
han said on the radio that "one day soon we will punish you
with death." but has since said he was not directing that com
ment at Coleman.
Mondale promises to keep
Three Mile Island closed
Middletown, Pa. — At the gates to the shuttered Three
Mile Island nuclear power plant, former Vice President Wal
ter Mondale declared yesterday that the reactors in the con
troversial complex would not be restarted if he were presi
dent.
His pledge came in answer to questions and constituted a
considerably stronger stance than he had previously taken on
the matter.
"If I am president of the United States, I guarantee you it
won't open again," Mondale said when he was pressed to be
more specific about the issue of restarting one of the units in
the plant, which has been shut down since 1979.
The plant was the site of the most serious accident in the
history of commercial nuclear power.
