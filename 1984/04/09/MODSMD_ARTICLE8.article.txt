# Weinberger: no troops to Central America
## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Washington — Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger denied yesterday
that the Pentagon is preparing contin
gency plans to send troops into combat in
Central America, but he declined to
deny reports of U.S. involvement in min
ing the harbors of Nicaragua.
Weinberger said. "There is no plan of
that kind, nor is there any necessity" to
deplov combat troops. He also initially
denied that the United States is mining
Nicaraguan ports, but cautioned that he
was not speaking on behalf of the CIA.
The secretary's comments, on ABCs
"This Week with David Brinkley," fol
lowed a week of disclosures and allega
tions about administration policies in
Central America.
The disclosures have come as
Congress considers what the administra

turn calls an emergency military aid bill
tor the U.S.-backed Salvadoran army,
which is lighting leftist insurgents, and
lor U.S.-backed Nicaraguan insurgents
who are battling their country's leftist
government. The aid is being taken up in
a heated political atmosphere with Presi
dent Reagan criticizing Democrats
balking over his Central American
policy.
I he New York Times reported yester
day that the administration is drawing up
contingency plans to introduce combat
troops in Central America in 1955 or
later if local U.S.-supported troops fail to
defeat leftist forces in the region. The
unnamed administration officials quoted
in the account said they were disclosing
the plans in part to persuade Congress to
approve military aid now to forestall the
need to send troops later.

The Washington Post and other
newspapers reported last week that CIA
employees and equipment have played a
direct role in laying underwater mines in
several Nicaraguan ports in cooperation
with U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels.
The CIA role is part of an expanded U.S.
effort to direct and invigorate the
"covert" war against Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.
The mines have damaged at least eight
ships from several countries, according
to Nicaragua, and have drawn protests
from U.S. allies France and Britain.
The Senate approved a bill last week
that includes $2 1 million for the war
against the Sandinistas and $61.7 million
for helicopters and other military equip
ment for the Salvadoran army. The mea
sure now must be considered by the
House, which last year twice rejected re

quests for additional aid for the
Nicaraguan "contras."
U.S. forces have become increasingly
involved in Central America during the
past year, with about 2000 troops now
stationed in Honduras — between
Nicaragua and HI Salvador — and with
U.S. reconnaissance planes Hying in
direct support of the Salvadoran army.
But Weinberger denied that his depart
ment is preparing plans to introduce
combat troops.
'"No. you don't have contingency plans
for almost everything." he said in
response to a question. "You plan for the
kinds of things that you may have to do
and for the things that are part of the
strategy of the United States and our
strategic priorities and objectives, and
this is not one of them."
