# Chernenko sees no progress on talks

From the Los Angeles Times
Moscow — Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko said
yesterday that diplomatic contacts with the Reagan ad
ministration have produced no progress toward the
resumption of suspended talks on nuclear arms control.
"Even if sometimes peace-loving rhetoric is heard
from Washington, it is impossible, however hard one
tries, to discern behind it any signs whatsoever of readi
ness to back up these words with practical deeds,"
Chernenko said in an interview with the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda.
The Soviet leader's comments were clearly intended
as a rejoinder to President Reagan's speech Friday at
Georgetown University in which he said he wanted bet
ter relations with Moscow but not at the price of uni
lateral concessions.
Using the Soviet leadership's traditional "interview"
format for statements. Chernenko indicated that the
Kremlin also was not prepared to budge from its insis
tence that the United States cease deploying new
medium-range missiles in Europe, and prepare to

remove those already sited, before nuclear arms talks
could resume.
His statement appeared calculated to throw cold
water on speculation in Washington that gradual prog
ress was being made toward opening a new dialogue
with the Soviets.
Apparently anticipating that his comments would be
read in the West as election-year pressure on the White
House to make concessions, he denied that this was the
case and insisted that Moscow follows a "principled
policy. .. not subject to transient vacillations."
Turning to the suspended Geneva talks on limiting
strategic and medium-range nuclear weapons, Cher
nenko said: "Our contacts with the American side also
show that no positive changes have taken place in the
position of the United States on these cardinal ques
tions."
The Soviets walked out of both sets of talks late last
year after the United States began deploying cruise and
Pershing 2 missiles to counter Soviet SS-20 missiles
already in place. Chernenko, however, repeated the
Soviet contention that the United States "torpedoed"

both sets of talks.
U.S.-Soviet contacts since then include an exchange
of several letters between the two leaders and two
meetings in the past two months between Foreign Mini
ster Andrei Gromyko and U.S. Ambassador Arthur
Hartman. Both meetings took place after Hartman had
returned to Moscow from consultations with adminis
tration officials in Washington.
Neither side has disclosed the contents of the letters
or the topics Gromyko and Hartman discussed. In all
public statements, Soviet officials continue to insist that
the collapse of nuclear arms talks — and indeed the
general state of U.S.-Soviet relations — is entirely the
fault of the United States. .
The party's Central Committee is expected to open a
plenary meeting Monday or Tuesday that could bring
further shifts in the party leadership following the death
two months ago of Yuri Andropov. On Wednesday, a
session of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Parliament,
is expected to name Chernenko in Andropov's place as
its largely honorary president and head of state.
