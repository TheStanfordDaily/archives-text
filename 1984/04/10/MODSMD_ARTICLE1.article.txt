# Senators shun race

Time constraints, frustration in
dealing with the "egos in the ASSU,"
and the difficulty of making substan
tial contributions are some of the
reasons that ASSU senator Robert
Blum says he is not running for ASSU
Senate in next week's elections.
"You run for the senate and you
think of all these great ideas and you
think they're feasible, but (once you
are elected) it's really hard to work
your way through all the different
rules and egos," Blum says. "You
have to appease this person while not
offending that person. To make a radi
cal change requires a lot of effort and
time."
