# Congressmen denounce Nicaragua port mining

From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — Democrats in Congress yester
day denounced the U.S. role in the mining of
Nicaragua's ports, and a key Democratic leader
said that the Reagan administration's request for
more secret aid to Nicaraguan rebels was "dead."
Moderate Republicans joined the Democrats in
complaining that they had not been consulted
about the operation, directed by the Central Intel
ligence Agency, and reacted angrily to an admin
istration decision to reject World Court jurisdic
tion over cases in Central America — including a
Nicaraguan lawsuit over the mining.
"Up to this point, I have contended that the
Reagan administration's secret war against
Nicaragua was morally indefensible," House
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) said.
"Today it is clear that it is legally indefensible as
well."
O'Neill and House Majority Leader Jim Wright
(D-Tex.) predicted that the House would refuse
to approve an administration request for $21 mil
lion in new aid to the CIA-backed rebels.
"It's dead," Wright said of the aid program,
which the Republican-controlled Senate ap
proved last week. "All the speculation about CIA
involvement (in the mining) adds fuel to the fire."
Rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist government
have taken responsibility for the mining, carried
out in three harbors during February and March,
but U.S. officials have acknowledged privately

that the operation was directed by the CIA, which
funds the rebels. Nicaragua filed suit against the
United States in the World Court yesterday to win
a legal ruling against the rebel aid — one day after
the administration announced that it no longer
recognized the U.N. judicial body's jurisdiction
over such a case.
In the Senate, Minority Leader Robert Byrd
(D-W.Va.) called the mining "an act of ter
rorism" and said that he had not been aware of
the U.S. role in the operation when he voted for
the aid last week.
Sen. Charles Percy (R-III.) chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, complained
that he had not been informed of the mining oper
ation either.
"I think we are all put in an extraordinarily dif
ficult position," Percy said. He said he would hold
a hearing on the issue soon, "and it will be a warm
hearing, to put it mildly."
However, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) a
longtime opponent of the covert aid program, said
he did not believe any senators had been unaware
of the U.S. role in the mining.
"They knew what they were doing," he said.
"Only now their constituents have found out
too. ... I can't imagine that there was any senator
who did now know about it. The reports (of the
Senate Intelligence Committee) were up there,
and we urged them to go look."
