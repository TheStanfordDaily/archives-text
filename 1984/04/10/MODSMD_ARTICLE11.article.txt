Washington â€” Nicaragua asked the International Court of
Justice yesterday to order a stop to U.S.-sponsored mining of
its ports and attacks on its territory, but the Reagan adminis
tration said its eleventh-hour legal maneuver last Friday will
prevent the court from taking the case.
The Nicaraguan action, filed at the court's headquarters in
The Hague, was announced in Washington by Foreign Mini
ster Miguel D'Escoto. who charged that the U.S. secret war is
"nothing less than a direct assault on the international legal
order and constitutes an attempt to bring international behav
ior back to the Stone Age concept that might makes right."
In its lawsuit. Nicaragua charged that "the United States is
recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying
and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding and directing
military and paramilitary action in and against Nicaragua" in
violation of international law. the United Nations charter and
the charter of the Organization of American States.
Nicaragua said more than 1300 of its citizens have been
killed and more than $200 million in damage to crops and
physical facilities has been wrought by the U.S.-backed con
tras operating in or near Nicaraguan territory. It asked the
court to order the United States to stop aiding anti
government forces immediately and to provide monetary
compensation and other legal remedies after the case is tried
before the 15-judge international panel.
The International Court of Justice, also known as the
World Court, is the judicial organ of the United Nations, es
tablished in 1946 to settle differences between nations by le
gal means wherever possible. It was the United Nations which
the United States informed Friday that, for the next two
years, it will refuse to accept the jurisdiction of the World
Court on any cases arising from U.S. actions in Central
America.
