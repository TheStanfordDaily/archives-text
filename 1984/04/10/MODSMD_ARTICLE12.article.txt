## Hoover bells mean heavenly music for this Angell 
### THERESA ELLIS 
What does an Angell do in Hoover
Tower? Well, if he is Electrical Engineering
Prof. James Angell, he does what he has
been doing for the past 23 years: He rings
the Hoover Tower bells.
While his predecessors have gone on to
play at such lofty places as the National Ca
thedral in Washington and the Campanile
at UC-Berkeley, Angell is actually the first
regular bell ringer the Tower has ever had.
He arrived here in 1960 and has played the
bells ever since.
But Angell hasn't been here as long as the
bells. The 35 bells, ranging in weight from
18 to 1400 pounds, arrived at Stanford in
1940 from the New York World Fair. At
that time, Belgium was overrun by the Nazis
and the Belgian American Foundation
Foundation got hold of the bells and gave
them to the Hoover Institution on behalf of
the Belgian people. They wanted to show
their gratitude to Herbert Hoover for the
help he gave to small-world countries after
World War I.
Angell has recently been able to show his
thanks for the 42-year-old gift when he
played for members of the Belgian Royal
Family this past winter. Unfortunately,
though, that's been one of the few times he
has played this year. "I usually try to play

once a week," he said, "but I've only
managed to play five times since Septem
ber."
The bells play on, though. There are
songs programmed on a drum which plays
half its contents —"Harmonious Black
smith" — and its flip side — "To a Wild
Rose" — one at 12:05 p.m. and the other at
5:05 p.m. Each song lasts approximately
two to three minutes, and of these, one was
programmed in 1968 and the other in 1982.
Angell had, however, played a much
larger set of bells before coming to Stan
ford. After receiving his doctorate at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
electrical engineering, he and his wife
moved to Philadelphia where they became
involved in a church which had 63 bells. An
gell was assistant carilloneur there. A caril
lon is a set of bells, usually more than 24,
which are placed and played together.
Even though Stanford has fewer bells,
Angell says that "the Tower is ideal because
it has private courtyards to hear the bells."
His own favorite place to listen is the court
yard between History Corner and Cum
mings Art Building.
But Angell has more plans for the bells
than just playing them. Since 1972, he has
been working on a proposal "to renovate
and augment the bells." His plan, part of an

endowment fund which is "one of my
fondest dreams," is to add to the almost 3-
octave bells to have a 4-octave set. The
heaviest bell of this set would be 6000
pounds. Also, he would like to procure
funds as part of this package to make the
Hoover carilloneur a paid position so that
the bells can continue to be played after he
retires from his position, which is a volun
tary one.
Hoover Tower, however, has been closed
since April of last year due to an upgrading
of the fire safety system, and until this work
is completed, there is little chance for the
proposal to come through.
But Angell, when he has time, continues
to play. Sometimes, he likes to play recog
nizable tunes from shows like "Fiddler on
the Roof' and"The Sound of Music." He is
59 years old now and he still enjoys hearing
the bells and "sharing their unique sounds."
He actually saw the Hoover Tower bells at
the 1940 New York World's Fair when they
were under the Belgian pavilion. He was in
high school then.
In two years, Angell will be on sabbatical
doing research. By that time he hopes to
have a student take his place and to have
guest carilloneurs that come to play, usually
when they on concert tours. Angell hopes to
encourage more carilloneurs with money
from his proposal, too.
