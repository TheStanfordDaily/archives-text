According to the Pentagon's deputy under sec
retary for research and advanced technology, a
proposal made public last week by the U.S. De
partment of Defense (DoD) calling for restric
tions on research contracts given by that branch
of the government to universities would "draw
the line" on how institutions such as Stanford use
DoD funds.
What the DoD fails to recognize is that it is
University President Donald Kennedy and the
presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology and the California Institute of Technology
who have drawn the line against the DoD.
When Kennedy and the heads of the two other
schools shot back a letter to President Reagan's
science adviser and the under secretary of defense
for research and engineering, saying they would
not tolerate such restrictions on research done on
their respective campuses, they were making a
strong statement for the preservation of the aca
demic freedom and the integrity of universities
across the country.

The DoD maintains that 0.7 percent of the re
search projects done at Stanford would be classi
fied as "sensitive" and require a 90-day pre
publication preview and the possibility of publica
tion restrictions for fear of technology transfer to
the Soviet Union. We question just what number
of research grants in the future would fall under
the category of "sensitive" projects and the am
biguity of the word sensitive. In addition, there
appears to be nothing preventing that 0.7 percent
figure from escalating to 7 percent in the near
future.
Any university has the right to make public at
its own discretion something that takes place on
its campus. There is no place for covert research
to take place on a college campus, a fact made
clear last week by Kennedy.
We support Kennedy for taking a stand to
prevent the interests of outside organizations, es
pecially those concerning military research, from
encroaching on the University's own academic
freedom.
