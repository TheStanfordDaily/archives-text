## Salvadoran tales of terror 
### 
"They killed my family in a manner
worse than one should kill a dog."
These words were spoken in a
matter-of-fact tone by a petite,
middle-aged woman in a refugee camp
in El Salvador. She was one of the
dozens of victims of government
repression the ecumenical group I was
a member of talked with in the course

VIEWPOINT

of our weeklong tour of the country.
This column gives these people a
chance to speak — to provide, for a
brief moment, a voice to the voiceless,
to the humble, suffering Salvadorans
who are never visited by the official
U.S. delegations, who are never con
sulted by the State Department ex
perts who certify El Salvador's prog
ress toward "democracy."
One elderly woman we interviewed
had lost three sons within the space of
a few months. The soldiers came for
the first one in the middle of the night.
They broke down the door and
proceeded to administer severe
beating to both the son and the wo
man. Then they led the son away.
When the woman tried to follow, a
soldier knocked her unconscious with
a rifle butt. She has never seen this son
again, nor heard anything of him.
though she has searched for him
desperately. She assumes that he is
dead, but there is always that agoniz
ing uncertainty.
The next son was lucky, by Sal
vadoran standards. He was killed in
stantly. shot down while he was
walking with his mother. When she
asked the soldiers why they had killed
him, they told her that it was none of
her business; she should shut up and
remove the body.
The third son simply failed to come
home one day. A couple of days later,
the woman was told to come to the
morgue to identify his body. It was,
she said, barely recognizable — he had
been worked over with an ice-pick, all
his nails had been pulled out, his legs
had been cut off, and, for good mea
sure, he had been shot repeatedly in
the face.
None of the sons had been involved
in political activity of any sort.
As she recounted the loss of her
third son. the woman started to cry —
quietly, with dignity. The people who
had gathered to listen were all crying

too, crying out of sympathy for the
woman and because her tale evoked
memories of their own similar, private
tragedies.
According to all the accounts we
heard, the army consistently works on
the theory that anyone living in an
area where the guerrillas have been
active is either a guerrilla or a guerrilla
sympathizer, and therefore fair game.
The lucky communities receive warn
ings — soldiers arrive and announce
that as of a certain day, anyone
remaining in the village will be killed.
Unfortunately, many people don't

believe the warnings until it is too late.
Another operating principle of the
army seems to be that any form of
popular organization — i.e., of grass
roots democracy — is a manifesta
tion of communism, and should be
dealt with accordingly. We heard in
numerable accounts of instances
where Salvadorans attempting to
launch such innocuous projects as
popular education programs in
literacy and nutrition, house-building
cooperatives and religious study
groups met with abduction, torture
and death as a result of this attitude.
In addition to their direct conse
quences, these human rights abuses
produce a flood of refugees, who
crowd into tiny camps, where they suf
fer from inadequate food, hygiene and
health care. Inhabitants of these
camps also suffer from fear, for the
authorities regard all refugees as sub
versives.
For me, as an American, one of the
most distressing facts that emerged
from the testimony we heard was that
our government is doing practically
nothing to help the Salvadoran
people. Most U.S. economic aid evi
dently either gets siphoned off into the
private coffers of government and mil
itary officials or goes to finance proj

ects which benefit the tiny wealthy
elite, rather than the poor majority.
Not only is the U.S. failing to help
the people of El Salvador, it also is di
rectly responsible for much of their
suffering. U.S. military aid equips the
Salvadoran military with the means of
repression, and U.S. rhetoric and
diplomacy is responsible for endowing
the Salvadoran regime with whatever
veneer of legitimacy it still possesses.
The Salvadoran people are very
clear as to the ultimate source of the
agony and death that has become their
daily reality. "Here in El Salvador," a

young refugee woman told us, "we
think that Reagan must not have a
heart. We think that he must not
believe in God, or else he could not do
what he is doing to us." And we were
begged again and again to let our fel
low countrypeople know what is really
going on in EI Salvador, to do every
thing in our power to halt the flow of
money, arms and advisers to the
feared and hated Salvadoran military.
The El Salvador described by the
voices that have spoken in this column
is the true El Salvador. It is a land of
corpses and fear, of unspeakable
atrocities and immeasurable grief.
Any attempt to paint a different
picture is a cruel mockery of the Sal
vadoran dead and their relatives.
If we allow ourselves to be conned
into accepting Reagan's rosy version
of the Salvadoran reality, we will be
giving him free rein to escalate his
pursuit of a military solution and to
step up the level of U.S. military inter
vention. These steps can only result in
more atrocities, more deaths, more
grieving relatives, more refugees —
and still greater suffering for the
people of El Salvador.

Another operating principle of the

For me, as an American, one of the
most distressing facts that emerged
from the testimony we heard was that
our government is doing practically
nothing to help the Salvadoran
people. Most U.S. economic aid evi
dently either gets siphoned off into the
private coffers of government and mil
itary officials or goes to finance proj

ects which benefit the tiny wealthy
elite, rather than the poor majority.
Not only is the U.S. failing to help
the people of El Salvador, it also is di
rectly responsible for much of their
suffering. U.S. military aid equips the
Salvadoran military with the means of
repression, and U.S. rhetoric and
diplomacy is responsible for endowing
the Salvadoran regime with whatever
veneer of legitimacy it still possesses.
The Salvadoran people are very
clear as to the ultimate source of the
agony and death that has become their
daily reality. "Here in El Salvador," a

young refugee woman told us, "we
think that Reagan must not have a
heart. We think that he must not
believe in God, or else he could not do
what he is doing to us." And we were
begged again and again to let our fel
low countrypeople know what is really
going on in EI Salvador, to do every
thing in our power to halt the flow of
money, arms and advisers to the
feared and hated Salvadoran military.
The El Salvador described by the
voices that have spoken in this column
is the true El Salvador. It is a land of
corpses and fear, of unspeakable
atrocities and immeasurable grief.
Any attempt to paint a different
picture is a cruel mockery of the Sal
vadoran dead and their relatives.
If we allow ourselves to be conned
into accepting Reagan's rosy version
of the Salvadoran reality, we will be
giving him free rein to escalate his
pursuit of a military solution and to
step up the level of U.S. military inter
vention. These steps can only result in
more atrocities, more deaths, more
grieving relatives, more refugees —
and still greater suffering for the
people of El Salvador.

"They killed my family in a manner
worse than one should kill a dog."
These words were spoken in a
matter-of-fact tone by a petite,
middle-aged woman in a refugee camp
in El Salvador. She was one of the
dozens of victims of government
repression the ecumenical group I was
a member of talked with in the course

VIEWPOINT

of our weeklong tour of the country.
This column gives these people a
chance to speak — to provide, for a
brief moment, a voice to the voiceless,
to the humble, suffering Salvadorans
who are never visited by the official
U.S. delegations, who are never con
sulted by the State Department ex
perts who certify El Salvador's prog
ress toward "democracy."
One elderly woman we interviewed
had lost three sons within the space of
a few months. The soldiers came for
the first one in the middle of the night.
They broke down the door and
proceeded to administer severe
beating to both the son and the wo
man. Then they led the son away.
When the woman tried to follow, a
soldier knocked her unconscious with
a rifle butt. She has never seen this son
again, nor heard anything of him.
though she has searched for him
desperately. She assumes that he is
dead, but there is always that agoniz
ing uncertainty.
The next son was lucky, by Sal
vadoran standards. He was killed in
stantly. shot down while he was
walking with his mother. When she
asked the soldiers why they had killed
him, they told her that it was none of
her business; she should shut up and
remove the body.
The third son simply failed to come
home one day. A couple of days later,
the woman was told to come to the
morgue to identify his body. It was,
she said, barely recognizable — he had
been worked over with an ice-pick, all
his nails had been pulled out, his legs
had been cut off, and, for good mea
sure, he had been shot repeatedly in
the face.
None of the sons had been involved
in political activity of any sort.
As she recounted the loss of her
third son. the woman started to cry —
quietly, with dignity. The people who
had gathered to listen were all crying

too, crying out of sympathy for the
woman and because her tale evoked
memories of their own similar, private
tragedies.
According to all the accounts we
heard, the army consistently works on
the theory that anyone living in an
area where the guerrillas have been
active is either a guerrilla or a guerrilla
sympathizer, and therefore fair game.
The lucky communities receive warn
ings — soldiers arrive and announce
that as of a certain day, anyone
remaining in the village will be killed.
