# In search of minerals
## 
### 
Americans breathed a sigh of relief in 1982-83 when the
emergence of a glut on the world oil market combined
with decreased energy consumption and greater reliance
on alternative fuel sources began to stabilize and then
reduce rampaging oil prices. As oil imports plummeted
from a 1977 peak of 8.78 million barrels per day (MBD)
to about three MBD. it appeared as if we were finally on
the road to resource self-sufficiency.
We have begun celebrating too soon. While our depen
dence on foreign, particularly Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), petroleum has indeed fallen
of late, our reliance on a handful of Third World countries
lor more than 50 percent of the 40 minerals rated essential
to the national economy or strategic force capabilities may
soon make policymakers long for the darkest days of the
energy crisis of the late 19705.
The United States simply does not possess many of
these minerals in quantities necessary to assure an ade
quate supply to industry and national self-sufficiency. No
matter how loudly mining interests whine that unreasona
ble environmental regulations hamper their patriotic ex
ploration efforts, the fact is that even razing the country
would not solve the problem. Central and Southern Africa
contain 95 percent of the world's chromium. 86 percent of
its platinum, 64 percent of its vanadium and significant
percentages of other minerals. Though from more diverse
sources, we also import 95 percent of our bauxite and 72
percent of our tin.
Even American import dependence would not be so
alarming were it not for two other grim geopolitical
realities: European (75 percent) and Japanese (90 per
cent) reliance on foreign mineral resources and virtual So
viet self-sufficiency.
The lines are drawn, particularly in mineral —rich South
Africa, a country on which we currently are dependent for
the four elements most critical to direct defense needs: 53
percent of our manganese ore. 40 percent of our chromite,
53 percent of our platinum group metals and 55 percent of
our cobalt. America is reasonably well-protected against
the short-term effects of some supply disruption: Conser
vation and diversification of sources, insofar as possible,
are national priorities, and the strategic stockpile amounts
to some $12.5 billion worth of 73 crucial minerals.
However, it is inordinately vulnerable to disruptions due
to political or economic instability in the producer states or
even conceivably some form of cartel action, and it is not
at all certain that the U.S. could weather such medium-or
long-term setbacks.
For its part, the U.S.S.R. is angling, as a 1973 speech by
Leonid Brezhnev spells out, "to gain control of the two
great treasure houses on which the West depends: the en
ergy treasure house of the Persian Gulf and the mineral
treasure house of Central and South Africa." It. too, is
willing to resort to a variety of means (some of which may
be less that appreciated by the host of countries in ques
tion) to successfully implement its strategy of denial. Pos
sible attacks include: market manipulation, physical dis
ruption or outright domination of producer or neighboring
states, and to this latter end 38,000 to 44,000 Soviet and
Cuban advisers (by congressional estimate) stationed in
sub-Saharan Africa address themselves.
American resource dependence means far more than
long-term vulnerability to Soviet hijinks in the area. It

erodes our influence with the mineral rich countries them
selves; it lessens our leverage on South Africa's
questionable-to-brutal human rights policies; dampens
our ability to use the World Bank and Agency for Interna
tional Development to ensure wise growth policies in
/aire, Zambia and elsewhere; it makes objectivity on the
issue of Namibian independence an empty pretense.
It also raises disturbing questions about America's role
in the international system. Can a superpower be so heav
ily reliant on foreign resources and remain a superpower?
Is it worthwhile to try to preserve our role when our vital
interests lie in other nations' hands and coercive methods
of securing them leave us open to precisely the charges of
imperialism leveled against the U.S.S.R.? Does the Soviet
threat sound grave enough to Canada and Australia for us
to convince them to despoil their lands to exploit their
considerable mineral wealth when we seem unwilling to
take similar measures at home? We do, after all, possess a
mineral cornucopia in Alaska, which has development po
tential in at least IS strategic minerals.
These questions are not easily answered. In order to
proceed, one major assumption must be made, i.e., while
Americans must do everything possible to lessen its vul
nerability to materials supply disruptions, certain crucial
minerals are of unavoidably vital interest to us. For the
time being, they will have to be treated as such.
As long as we are trying to use Pretoria to benefit
Peoria, we may as well face up to the same facts that per
tain to nonrenewable resources at home. They are finite,
and they are being depleted far too rapidly. Strenuous ef
forts at conservation and substitution would help, as would
making do on a slightly lower standard of liv ing now rather
than watch conditions disintegrate all at once later. AKo,
inasmuch as just one tighter engine requires nearly 13,000
pounds of raw materials (an F-100 engine uses more than
5000 pounds each of nickel and titanium, 1600 pounds of
chromium, 900 pounds of cobalt and nearly 200 pounds of
columbium) and other military equipment consumes
minerals at an equally gluttonous rate, some form of arms
control agreement would be most useful. Above all.
Westerners should not be lulled into thinking that ocean
resources will prove a panacea; exploitation is expensive,
environmentally fraught with danger and torn by interna
tional competition.
If necessary, American agricultural surpluses can be
used as an effective quid pro quo: An agreement signed
with Jamaica in February 1982, for example, provided for
a mutually beneficial bauxite-dairy products exchange.
Wielded forcefully against the U.S.S.R., in concert with
Canada and Australia, American agricultural products
could prove an effective counter to Soviet efforts to des
tabilize and deny. Ideally, food would not he used as a
weapon, and U.S. diplomacy should patiently do its utmost
to keep South Africa and other mineral-rich regions sta
ble. But this is not an ideal world, and if only to buy time
to devise a long-term solution, such measures may become
unavoidable.
Our society depends on a steady supply of minerals, but
we can neither strip-mine North America nor rely on the
goodwill and stability of Southern Africa to do it. In short,
we are caught between a rock and a hard place — without
the rocks.

Westerners should not be lulled into thinking that ocean

Americans breathed a sigh of relief in 1982-83 when the
emergence of a glut on the world oil market combined
with decreased energy consumption and greater reliance
on alternative fuel sources began to stabilize and then
reduce rampaging oil prices. As oil imports plummeted
from a 1977 peak of 8.78 million barrels per day (MBD)
to about three MBD. it appeared as if we were finally on
the road to resource self-sufficiency.
We have begun celebrating too soon. While our depen
dence on foreign, particularly Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), petroleum has indeed fallen
of late, our reliance on a handful of Third World countries
lor more than 50 percent of the 40 minerals rated essential
to the national economy or strategic force capabilities may
soon make policymakers long for the darkest days of the
energy crisis of the late 19705.
The United States simply does not possess many of
these minerals in quantities necessary to assure an ade
quate supply to industry and national self-sufficiency. No
matter how loudly mining interests whine that unreasona
ble environmental regulations hamper their patriotic ex
ploration efforts, the fact is that even razing the country
would not solve the problem. Central and Southern Africa
contain 95 percent of the world's chromium. 86 percent of
its platinum, 64 percent of its vanadium and significant
percentages of other minerals. Though from more diverse
sources, we also import 95 percent of our bauxite and 72
percent of our tin.
Even American import dependence would not be so
alarming were it not for two other grim geopolitical
realities: European (75 percent) and Japanese (90 per
cent) reliance on foreign mineral resources and virtual So
viet self-sufficiency.
The lines are drawn, particularly in mineral —rich South
Africa, a country on which we currently are dependent for
the four elements most critical to direct defense needs: 53
percent of our manganese ore. 40 percent of our chromite,
53 percent of our platinum group metals and 55 percent of
our cobalt. America is reasonably well-protected against
the short-term effects of some supply disruption: Conser
vation and diversification of sources, insofar as possible,
are national priorities, and the strategic stockpile amounts
to some $12.5 billion worth of 73 crucial minerals.
However, it is inordinately vulnerable to disruptions due
to political or economic instability in the producer states or
even conceivably some form of cartel action, and it is not
at all certain that the U.S. could weather such medium-or
long-term setbacks.
For its part, the U.S.S.R. is angling, as a 1973 speech by
Leonid Brezhnev spells out, "to gain control of the two
great treasure houses on which the West depends: the en
ergy treasure house of the Persian Gulf and the mineral
treasure house of Central and South Africa." It. too, is
willing to resort to a variety of means (some of which may
be less that appreciated by the host of countries in ques
tion) to successfully implement its strategy of denial. Pos
sible attacks include: market manipulation, physical dis
ruption or outright domination of producer or neighboring
states, and to this latter end 38,000 to 44,000 Soviet and
Cuban advisers (by congressional estimate) stationed in
sub-Saharan Africa address themselves.
American resource dependence means far more than
long-term vulnerability to Soviet hijinks in the area. It

erodes our influence with the mineral rich countries them
selves; it lessens our leverage on South Africa's
questionable-to-brutal human rights policies; dampens
our ability to use the World Bank and Agency for Interna
tional Development to ensure wise growth policies in
/aire, Zambia and elsewhere; it makes objectivity on the
issue of Namibian independence an empty pretense.
It also raises disturbing questions about America's role
in the international system. Can a superpower be so heav
ily reliant on foreign resources and remain a superpower?
Is it worthwhile to try to preserve our role when our vital
interests lie in other nations' hands and coercive methods
of securing them leave us open to precisely the charges of
imperialism leveled against the U.S.S.R.? Does the Soviet
threat sound grave enough to Canada and Australia for us
to convince them to despoil their lands to exploit their
considerable mineral wealth when we seem unwilling to
take similar measures at home? We do, after all, possess a
mineral cornucopia in Alaska, which has development po
tential in at least IS strategic minerals.
These questions are not easily answered. In order to
proceed, one major assumption must be made, i.e., while
Americans must do everything possible to lessen its vul
nerability to materials supply disruptions, certain crucial
minerals are of unavoidably vital interest to us. For the
time being, they will have to be treated as such.
As long as we are trying to use Pretoria to benefit
Peoria, we may as well face up to the same facts that per
tain to nonrenewable resources at home. They are finite,
and they are being depleted far too rapidly. Strenuous ef
forts at conservation and substitution would help, as would
making do on a slightly lower standard of liv ing now rather
than watch conditions disintegrate all at once later. AKo,
inasmuch as just one tighter engine requires nearly 13,000
pounds of raw materials (an F-100 engine uses more than
5000 pounds each of nickel and titanium, 1600 pounds of
chromium, 900 pounds of cobalt and nearly 200 pounds of
columbium) and other military equipment consumes
minerals at an equally gluttonous rate, some form of arms
control agreement would be most useful. Above all.

resources will prove a panacea; exploitation is expensive,
