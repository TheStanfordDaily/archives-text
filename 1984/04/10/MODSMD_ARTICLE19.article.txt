## University slights French profs 
### 
It is unfortunate that during Presi
dent Mitterrand's visit to the Stanford
campus, few if any of my American
colleagues in the French Department
were asked to be present at a recep
tion given in his honor.
While I personally had little desire
to add another invitation to those
received. I do feel that a grave lack of
courtesy was displayed. Perhaps the
omission is a sign of the low esteem in
which American-born French profes
sors are held.
Although I have not consulted
many of my colleagues before writing
this letter, I do feel it appropriate to
point out that collectively, the titles of
Our publications occupy several pages
in bibliographies; we have addressed
an impressive number of professional
societies here and abroad and the
French Department has contributed
its share of students to the faculties of
similar departments throughout the
country.
! It is ironic and distressing that our
own university has not seen fit to
invite us to meet the president of a
Qountry whose culture we represent.
