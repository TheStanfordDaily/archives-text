Some of Blum's comments are
echoed by other senators attempting
to explain why only three of the 20 un
dergraduates in the senate have cho
sen to seek re-election.
But Senate Chair Jug Jagadish says
many senators leave the senate with
positive feelings, satisfied with their
accomplishments and ready to try
something new.
Deputy Chair Donna Anderson
concurs. "Most of what we do has a
great deal of pertinence," she said.
The high turnover rate in the senate
is not a new phenomenon, but the
reasons for it are currently a source of
both concern and debate among the
members of the organization.
Some undergraduate senators not
running for re-election arc pursuing
other positions in student government,
but many may not be returning be
cause they sense "a real frustration,"
according to Jon Adolstein, one ol the
three senators who is running again.
"They came in hoping to do some

thing positive for the school hut they
find themselves sunk in a bureaucratic
mess." Adelstein says. "They don't
feel that they did accomplish much he
cause of the structure of student gov
ernment."
But the chairman and deputy chair
of the senate disagree.
"It doesn't make sense to partici
pate in the same activity at the same
level year after year." Jagadish said,
explaining his view that senators com
monly serve only one year in the sen
ate in order to vary their extracur
ricular experiences at Stanford.
Jagadish and Anderson take issue
with charges that many undergradu
ates leave the senate because they feel
stifled by an overabundance of rules
"The extreme of the pendulum was
reached sometime last year and now
we are moving back toward what I
would call a happy medium." said
Jagadish.
As an example of the senate's abil
ity to avoid obstructive rules. Jagadish
cites the senate's flexibility in funding
of some of the speakers for the
weekend's public policy conference
despite questions of regulational pro
priety.
