## Daily editorial distorts reality 
### 
I was happy to see that your editorial "Recast and
replace" (Daily, March 14) correctly placed the attack on
the Segal sculpture in the appropriate context of "a certain
homophobic tendency on campus." The destruction of the
sculpture should not be viewed in isolation from the physi
cal and verbal abuse which threaten gay and lesbian
people every day.
It was, therefore, particularly disturbing when you sug
gested that the gay and lesbian community at Stanford
took advantage of the incident. Especially offensive was

VIEWPOINT

the statement, "While the episode might have served some
purpose for the two extremes, the rest of us lose." Firstly,
it is inappropriate to imply that the gay community here
had some purpose "served" by this violence. Of all mem
bers of the Stanford community, we are probably the ones
most disturbed by this loss.
Secondly, that statement appears to equate the actions
of the gay community with those of the attacker by calling
them "two extremes." The only respect in which we repre
sent the opposite extreme from this violent homophobe is
that we are peace-loving and tolerant and support the civil
rights of all people, while he is intolerant and violent
towards those whose views or lifestyles differ from his
own.
The reason the gay community (as well as members of
the straight community) reacted strongly to the attack is
because we felt a deep and personal sense of loss. Also,
many felt that the man who attacked the sculpture would
willingly have taken his hammer to us as well. If anyone
thinks that this is an extreme view, consider the violent
grafitti written on the placards placed at the site or some of
the hate mail received at the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at

Stanford since the event, much of which bears comments
such as, "Apply baseball bats to faggot heads."
The rally was the result of cumulative pressure that had
built up and become intolerable when the statue was
destroyed. It was not an attempt to take advantage of the
incident as your editorial obliquely implies.

The only respect in which we repre
sent the opposite extreme from this
violent homophobe is that we are
peace-loving and tolerant and sup
port the civil rights of all people,
while he is intolerant and violent
towards those whose views or
lifestyles differ from his own.

I suspect that the insensitivity displayed in your editorial
was unintentional. However, it is just this lack of sensitiv
ity, this kind of assumption, that gay people are an
"extreme" that helps perpetuate the violence and preju
dice that we face in this society.
<Please withhold my name from publication with this letter.
Unfortunately, I fear that / would have great difficulties in
my department here at Stanford if it were known that / am
gay, and it would probably make a career in my chosen
field nearly impossible. As you know. Governor Deuk
mejian vetoed the bill that would have made it illegal to fire
someone because lie or she is gay. Until that happens, none
of us will feel safe in our jobs, much less on the street.)
