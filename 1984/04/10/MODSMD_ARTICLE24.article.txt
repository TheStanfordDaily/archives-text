## Does the life of a student-athlete really Paye off? 
### 
I sometimes wonder whether
John Paye actuall} owns any
regular street clothes.
Think about it. For those ot
you who don't know this tine
freshman athlete personally, is
there any time when you've
seen him out of uniform?
For most of you. probably
not. In fact, I find myself hard
pressed to come up with an in
stance when I haven't seen a
number 14 or 20 plastered
across his chest.
After playing football fall
quarter, basketball winter quar
ter and going back to the
gridiron for the spring, Paye
probably can't name more than
a week of time he has had to
himself.
That's probably perfect for
him anyways. Paye (like any
athlete) seems to revel in the joy
of competition. Certainly his sit
uation is nothing new, since
many Stanford athletes partici
pate in two sports.
But Paye's situation seems
somewhat tragic to me. If he
continues along his present
pace, he won't have a quarter
away from an athletic field or
court until the spring quarter of
his senior year.
With that in mind, when is he
ever going to be able to enjoy
the other things that Stanford
has to offer him? Probably
never.
That's the tragedy. Not just
for Paye and other Stanford
student-athletes who miss out
on the opportunity to enjoy
what the university has to offer
them, but also for athletes who
attend other schools.
At other schools,. many ath

letes are stars from the word
"go. I hey are expected to per
form as freshmen. But is that
lair? Even more importantly, is
that obstructing the student
athlete's supposedly main pur
pose of getting a degree?
In Paye's case, it's probably
hard to say. He's very intelligent
so he may find it easier to go
to school and be a full-time ath
lete. But at other schools the
student-athletes are not always
ot Paye's caliber
As a result, athletes at many

other schools are never really
students. From the minute they
enter as freshmen, they're given
jerseys and helmets. Books
come second.
A change has to be made. The
most logical change would be to
make freshmen athletes in
eligible for competition.
This idea is certainly nothing
new. Up until a little more than
a decade ago, freshmen weren't
allowed to play. But under pres
sure from school that wanted to
save money on scholarships, the
NCAA allowed frosh to com
pete.

I hese same schools also
argued that many freshmen ath
letes were good enough to play
as freshman and should he gi\en
that chance. That point is un
deniably true, as players like
Marcus Dupree. Michael Jor
dan. Patrick Ewing and
Wayman Tisdale have proved.
But college athletics must re
evaluate its priorities. The pri
mary responsibility is for the
student to get his degree. George
town (the NCAA basketball
champions) Head Coach John
Thompson apparently has his
priorities straight when he said.
â€¢"We're trying to educate these
kids and get them their
degrees."
It's hard to believe, however,
that most student-athletes can
reasonably adapt to college and
play a varsity sport as freshmen.
Just the mere change from high
school to college is a difficult
transition for the average stu
dent.
If a student is given a year
away from direct competition,
it's not going to hurt his or her
ability substantially. It will give
him or her a good opportunity
to become acclimated to the
university and get some direc
tion.
Otherwise, what is the pur
pose of college? Is it there to
create a four-year minor league
system for prospective profes
sional athletes, or is it trying to
educate some of these people?
One cliche says, "A sound
body equals a sound mind."
Some colleges are guaranteeing
only half of that, and not the
half you might expect.

Freshman John Paye must find a way to work hours of basket
ball into his life without fouling up his freshman year.


Art Streiber/Daily
Paye leads a busy life as a double-sport athlete on the farm.
In addition to spending hours playing football, he has to meet
the demands of Stanford academics.
