# Card netters attempt to boot the Utes today
## 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
Today marks the beginning of
an important phase for the Stan
ford men's tennis team. This af
ternoon's match at the Varsity
Courts against a tough Univer
sity of Utah team is the last
preparation before back-to
back matches against No. 1- and
No. 2-ranked USC and UCLA.
Although the matches in Los
Angeles are critical for the Car
dinal. Head Coach Dick Gould
is not taking Utah lightly, and
for a good reason. The Utah
Utes hive been champions of
the Western Athletic Confer
ence for the past five years.
"They're an experienced
team, and they beat Arizona
earlier this season," Gould said.
The Cardinal just defeated
Arizona this past weekend by a
score of 9-0.
Utah's top three singles
players have impressive statis
tics. Senior and top-seed John
Tsumas made the NCAA
singles tournament with a 29-10
win-loss record last season. Al
though their No. 2 player. West
German Christian Schultz, is

only a sophomore, he was the
Bavarian champion last year
and placed second in the
European Championships for
his age group.
Lasse Maistco, from Finland,
the Utes' third singles player, is a
transfer from Seminole Junior
College in Florida where he led
his team to the conference
championships.
The main concern in today's
matches is whether the Cardinal
can stay strong throughout the
match â€” something which did
not happen in the last contest
against the Arizona State Sun
Devils. "We're going to be
working on consistency. I think
it's going to be a good test for
us. If we can sustain intensity,
we'll reach our full capability,"
Gould noted.
Gould is not worried about
the team's ability to play. He
described the doubles team of
John Letts and Jim Grabb as
being "as good as any (pair) in
the country." He also indicated
that senior and team captain
Mark McKeen played his best
match of the season against
ASU.

Although the team was flat
against the Sun Devils, Gould
remained optimistic. "I think
our team will rebound well. Na
tionals are four weeks off. We
have tc take each match as a
stepping stone."
Today's match is scheduled to
begin at 1:30 p.m.
