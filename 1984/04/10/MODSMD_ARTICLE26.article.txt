### GEOFF SANBORN 
The Stanford women's golf
team picked up its first
tournament victory of the
season yesterday, finishing
first in a three-team field at
the Northern California
Championship in San Jose.
It was an important win for
the team, coming on the
heels of its eighth place finish
in the Lady Mustang Roun
dup in Dallas over spring
break. "This is going to
psyche us up for next week,"
said junior Kathy Nino, re
ferring to the Lady Sun Devil
Tournament in Phoenix
April 14-16, a tournament
which is crucial to the Car
dinal's hopes for a berth in
the NCAA Championship.
Freshman star Kathy
McCarthy added to the
sweetness of the day's tri
umph by scoring her fourth
individual victory of the
season. She put together
rounds of 72-76 for a final
total of 148 in the one-day,
36-hole tournament, defeat
ing Liz Chiarelli of San Jose
State by three strokes.
As a team, Stanford shot
18-hole totals of 305-304 for
a finishing score of 609, six
strokes better than San Jose
State's team score of 615.
Sacramento State, a Division
II school, finished last with a
682.

Freshman Julie Carmic
hael finished the day with a
respectable score of 152, fol
lowed by junior Diane Nixon
with a 153, Nino with a 156
and sophomore Kathy
Kostas with a 157.
Although encouraged by
the win, Nino reported that
the team had "expected to
do even better" against the
relatively light competition it
faced in the tournament. She
added, however, that the
NCAA tournament selection
committee looks for team
scores of 305 and below
when giving out bids, and so
the scores of 305 and 304
"will help us a little bit for
the nationals. Coming after
Dallas, it was good to get
some low numbers up on the
board."
The Cardinal now has only
two tournaments left on the
schedule — the Lady Sun
Devil and the WCAA Cham
pionships in San Diego on
April 25-27.
According to Coach Tim
Baldwin, strong finishes in
both these tournaments, the
latter one in particular,
would go a long way towards
assuring Stanford of an
NCAA berth. Now that the
team has put Dallas behind it
and gotten a tournament vic
tory under its belt, this
scenario is looking more and
more possible.
