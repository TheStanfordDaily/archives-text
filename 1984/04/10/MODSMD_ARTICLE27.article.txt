## 
### 
Oakland, Calif. (AP) â€” The Oakland A s
called on Bill Caudill, their new relief pitch
ing ace, for the third time and posted their
(hird come-l rom-behind victory of the
Reason last night.
Not that Oakland planned it that way this
time.
"If we keep the game close, we've got
Number 36 (Caudill) to bring in, and nine
times out of 10 he'll nail it down for us,"
said Carney Lansford, the hitting star of the
4-3 victory o\er the Toronto Blue Jays.
Caudill didn't nail down this one, the A's
fifth victory in six games, until after he gave
up an eighth-inning homer by George Bell,
a 400-foot blast to center field that led off
the inning and gave the Blue Jays a 3-2 lead.
'"Believe me, I can throw home run
pitches further than that." said Caudill. who
challenged Bell with a fastball on a 3-2

pitch. "It was a case of either walking him or
seeing what he could do with my best
pitch."
Lansford. swinging on an 0-2 pitch, hit
what he described as a very good sinker
from Dennis Lamp and drilled a two-run
homer to left in the bottom of the eighth.
"It wasn't the best swing I've ever made
for a homer, either. I just somehow hap
pened to get the good part of the bat on the
ball." Lansford said.
Caudill faced only three batters in the
ninth, earning his first victory to go with two
saves, when he struck out pinch hitter Ernie
Whitt to end the game. Lansford got his
third game-winning RBI with the homer.
The homer, Lansford's first, scored Joe
Morgan to gave the A's a 5-1 record.
Lansford was the first batter to face
Lamp. Dwayne Murphy reached base on an

error by second baseman Damaso Garcia to
open the A s eighth. Jimmv Ke\ then
relieved Toronto starter Jim C'lancv and got
Morgan to ground into a foreeout before
I.amp. 0-2. came out of the bullpen.
Bell, the tirst batter to face Caudill. sin
gled earlier in the game and is batting .520
through six games.
Oakland broke a scoreless tie with two
runs in the sixth when Lansford and Bruce
Bochte drilled run-scoring singles with two
outs.
The Blue Jays tied it in the seventh with a
two-out rally of their own. Da\c Collins and
Alfredo Griffin singled off A s starter Tim
Conroy and reliever Chris Codiroli was
summoned. The runners advanced on a wild
pitch and Garcia then hit a slow roller
toward third base.
