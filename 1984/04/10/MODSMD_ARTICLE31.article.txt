## 'Splash' infectious, sweetly dazed 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The sparkling comedy-fantasy Splash has
a completely formed narrative shape, from
its sepia-tinted black and white prologue to
its Brigadoon ending. The screenwriters,
Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel and Bruce
Jay Friedman (adapting a story by producer
Brian Grazer), and the director, Ron
Howard, have worked everything out; the
solidly built story carries you along as in a
classic comedy from the 19305.
In the initial scene, two young boys sail a
ferry on Cape Cod, where they are
vacationing with their parents; the older boy
passes his time by peeking under the skirt of
every female he encounters, while his
younger brother stands quietly on deck,
brooding and peering into the water. Sud
denly he sees a little girl swimming; she beck
ons him to join her, and he does — until
he is rescued (he can't swim) and his would
be inamorata swims off into the sunset, her
fins fluttering.
Then 20 years later, when Allen (Tom
Hanks) has grown into a successful but
emotionally unfulfilled young man, running
a produce supply firm with his brother
Freddie (John Candy) — who still peeks un
der women's skirts — he meets his mermaid
(Daryl Hannah) again. Seeking the solace of
an ocean holiday after a love affair has dis
integrated, he drives to Cape Cod, falls out
of a boat, hits his head and — since he still
can't swim — is taken to shore by what he
believes, when he regains consciousness,'to
be a beautiful nude woman. (On land the
mermaid looks like an ordinary female;
water transforms her legs into scales.) She
kisses him and disappears, but when he has
returned to New York, she pops up at the
Statue of Liberty with the wallet he left be
hind.
The makers of Splash didn't invent the
idea of a romance between a nice young
American and an other-worldly creature
who complicates — messes up and enriches
— his life. The film bears some resemblance
to the 1943 Kurt Weill-S.J.Perelman-
Ogden Nash musical. One Touch of Venus,
in which a window dresser in a department
store inadvertently brings a statue of Venus
to life. But Perelman and Nash were
satirists, and Splash, though it contains
humorous bits about the natual belligerence
of New Yorkers (screenwriter Lowell Ganz

has a few bright moments as a tour guide at
the Statue of Liberty) and the peculiar im
pression television might make on a crea
ture viewing it for the first time, really has
its sights on more accessible territory.
The filmmakers drop these running gags
fairly early on and concentrate on the im
plications of Allen's falling in love with a
mermaid who must (a) return to her under
water home before the week is out and (b)
conceal her identity from him. because how
do you tell your lover you're really a mer
maid? An obsessed scientist, Dr. Walter
Kornbluth (Eugene Levy), provides the ele
ment of danger that counterpoints the
romantic plot; having observed Madison (as
the mermaid now calls herself, taking the
name from the nearest New York street
sign) in the waters of Cape Cod, he trails her
through the city, seeking to prove the exis
tence of mermaids.
Levy's role takes the form of a series of
blackout sketches — of variable quality, but
the best of them are excellent — that
punctuate the narrative and, at the crucial
moment, merge with it: He finally comes
face to face with Madison, throws water on
her and exposes her true nature for Allen
and the world to see. (Levy is very funny as
the paranoid, practically sociopathic
Kornbluth, but when the script requires him
to change his stripes near the end, his per
formance fizzles out.)
This old-fashioned comedy has its sen
timental side, yet Howard gives it an unus
ual tone: sweetly dazed. And watching it,
you become infected by it — you feel as if
someone had knocked you lightly on the
head or spun you around a little too fast.
Daryl Hannah helps to create that effect,
because she always looks slightly quizzical,
though her eyes are as bright as the shim
mering Cape Cod waves. For the first two
thirds of the movie I couldn't decide whe
ther Daryl Hannah was a skillful com
edienne or Howard had just done a splendid
job of directing her, but when 1 saw the look
on her face upon being publicly soaked by
Kornbluth — a scene that, directorially,
doesn't quite work — I was convinced that
yes, she can really act. That look wasn't
quite like anything I'd ever seen: It was as
though the water had caused her face as well
as her skin to metamorphose — it was a
look of melted anguish.

Physically, she and Tom Hanks are an in
spired match; when he smiles, his face
becomes blurry, as if water had eroded it.
At first Hanks appears to be a nice guy
comic like Chevy Chase, but he's more ac
curately a saner Bill Murray. (He even looks
like Murray.) The movie relies heavily on

his sympathetic charm, and on the way he
and Daryl Hannah work together, and you
never feel let down in either department.
In the background but pushing steadily to
the fore is Eugene Levy's "SCTV" col
league, the irrepressible John Candy. He
plays Splash's equivalent to the Bill Murray
role in Tootsie — in pure storytelling terms,
the movie could probably function without
him, but he's so unreasonably hilarious that
you start laughing whenever he shows up in
anticipation of what he's going to do.
Ron Howard is a very good director, and
he'll end up a terrific one if he learns to be
more adventurous and imaginative. He of
fers us tantalizing glimpses of Madison's un
derwater kingdom when she saves Allen,
but we never return to it, and so the fantasy
element of the movie is almost entirely
restricted to the idea of a mermaid in love
with a human. (We don't even get to see the
transformation process.) Allen says that he
grew up thinking he'd dreamed his boyhood
encounter with Madison; that should have
been a clue for Howard to create an opening
scene so magical that we, too, think it must
be a dream. No one could complain about
Splash — it's a delightful comedy — but we
can hope that there are real dreams in Ron
Howard's future.

its sepia-tinted black and white prologue to
its Brigadoon ending. The screenwriters,
Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel and Bruce
Jay Friedman (adapting a story by producer
Brian Grazer), and the director, Ron
Howard, have worked everything out; the
solidly built story carries you along as in a
classic comedy from the 19305.
In the initial scene, two young boys sail a
ferry on Cape Cod, where they are
vacationing with their parents; the older boy
passes his time by peeking under the skirt of
every female he encounters, while his
younger brother stands quietly on deck,
brooding and peering into the water. Sud
denly he sees a little girl swimming; she beck
ons him to join her, and he does — until
he is rescued (he can't swim) and his would
be inamorata swims off into the sunset, her
fins fluttering.
Then 20 years later, when Allen (Tom
Hanks) has grown into a successful but
emotionally unfulfilled young man, running
a produce supply firm with his brother
Freddie (John Candy) — who still peeks un
der women's skirts — he meets his mermaid
(Daryl Hannah) again. Seeking the solace of
an ocean holiday after a love affair has dis
integrated, he drives to Cape Cod, falls out
of a boat, hits his head and — since he still
can't swim — is taken to shore by what he
believes, when he regains consciousness,'to
be a beautiful nude woman. (On land the
mermaid looks like an ordinary female;
water transforms her legs into scales.) She
kisses him and disappears, but when he has
returned to New York, she pops up at the
Statue of Liberty with the wallet he left be
hind.
The makers of Splash didn't invent the
idea of a romance between a nice young
American and an other-worldly creature
who complicates — messes up and enriches
— his life. The film bears some resemblance
to the 1943 Kurt Weill-S.J.Perelman-
Ogden Nash musical. One Touch of Venus,
in which a window dresser in a department
store inadvertently brings a statue of Venus
to life. But Perelman and Nash were
satirists, and Splash, though it contains
humorous bits about the natual belligerence
of New Yorkers (screenwriter Lowell Ganz

has a few bright moments as a tour guide at
the Statue of Liberty) and the peculiar im
pression television might make on a crea
ture viewing it for the first time, really has
its sights on more accessible territory.
The filmmakers drop these running gags
fairly early on and concentrate on the im
plications of Allen's falling in love with a
mermaid who must (a) return to her under
water home before the week is out and (b)
conceal her identity from him. because how
do you tell your lover you're really a mer
maid? An obsessed scientist, Dr. Walter
Kornbluth (Eugene Levy), provides the ele
ment of danger that counterpoints the
romantic plot; having observed Madison (as
the mermaid now calls herself, taking the
name from the nearest New York street
sign) in the waters of Cape Cod, he trails her
through the city, seeking to prove the exis
tence of mermaids.
Levy's role takes the form of a series of
blackout sketches — of variable quality, but
the best of them are excellent — that
punctuate the narrative and, at the crucial
moment, merge with it: He finally comes
face to face with Madison, throws water on
her and exposes her true nature for Allen
and the world to see. (Levy is very funny as
the paranoid, practically sociopathic
Kornbluth, but when the script requires him
to change his stripes near the end, his per
formance fizzles out.)
This old-fashioned comedy has its sen
timental side, yet Howard gives it an unus
ual tone: sweetly dazed. And watching it,
you become infected by it — you feel as if
someone had knocked you lightly on the
head or spun you around a little too fast.
Daryl Hannah helps to create that effect,
because she always looks slightly quizzical,
though her eyes are as bright as the shim
mering Cape Cod waves. For the first two
thirds of the movie I couldn't decide whe
ther Daryl Hannah was a skillful com
edienne or Howard had just done a splendid
job of directing her, but when 1 saw the look
on her face upon being publicly soaked by
Kornbluth — a scene that, directorially,
doesn't quite work — I was convinced that
yes, she can really act. That look wasn't
quite like anything I'd ever seen: It was as
though the water had caused her face as well
as her skin to metamorphose — it was a
look of melted anguish.

Physically, she and Tom Hanks are an in
spired match; when he smiles, his face
becomes blurry, as if water had eroded it.
At first Hanks appears to be a nice guy
comic like Chevy Chase, but he's more ac
curately a saner Bill Murray. (He even looks
like Murray.) The movie relies heavily on

his sympathetic charm, and on the way he
and Daryl Hannah work together, and you
never feel let down in either department.
In the background but pushing steadily to
the fore is Eugene Levy's "SCTV" col
league, the irrepressible John Candy. He
plays Splash's equivalent to the Bill Murray
role in Tootsie — in pure storytelling terms,
the movie could probably function without
him, but he's so unreasonably hilarious that
you start laughing whenever he shows up in
anticipation of what he's going to do.
Ron Howard is a very good director, and
he'll end up a terrific one if he learns to be
more adventurous and imaginative. He of
fers us tantalizing glimpses of Madison's un
derwater kingdom when she saves Allen,
but we never return to it, and so the fantasy
element of the movie is almost entirely
restricted to the idea of a mermaid in love
with a human. (We don't even get to see the
transformation process.) Allen says that he
grew up thinking he'd dreamed his boyhood
encounter with Madison; that should have
been a clue for Howard to create an opening
scene so magical that we, too, think it must
be a dream. No one could complain about
Splash — it's a delightful comedy — but we
can hope that there are real dreams in Ron
Howard's future.
