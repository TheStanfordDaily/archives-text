# The 						Alarm doesn't ring true onstage
## 
### CARLA GENTRY 
- The Alarm is another of the
United Kingdom bands which,
like U2 and Big Country, infuse
their music and lyrics with op
timism, hope and commitment.
While this combination of emo
tions works on its albums.
The Alarm failed in delivering
its rebellious stance to the
Wolfgang's audience.
Consisting of two acoustic
guitarists, a bassist and a drum
mer, The Alarm's sound is char
acterized by a loud, ringing and
sometimes harsh sounds. Its
songs speak of such themes as
truth, justice, rebellion, revolt
and honor. In essence, its mu
sical stance is a combination of

Bob Dylan and The Clash. The
Alarm, however, falls short of
the passionate, vehement
opinions and convictions of
either Dylan or the Clash.
Despite an EP and an album
(Declaration) chock full of war
and soldier songs. The Alarm in
concert prove unsuccessful in
delivering this promised
bravado.
Playing to a nearly soldout
crowd at Wolfgang's, there were
moments when The Alarm
managed to stir the audience.
For instance, the tune, "Going
Out In A Blaze Of Glory," in
cluded crowd participation by
chanting the refrain over and
over without musical accom

paniment. Other numbers such
as "Where Were You Hiding
When The Storm Broke" and
"The Stand" were also
welcomed with enthusiasm.
Yet somehow the overall
Alarm performance was fairly
conventional. The lead singer,
Mike Peters, was unconvincing
in either motivation or desper
ate passion while singing such
songs as "Marching On," "For
Freedom" or "Life of the
Land." His stage presence was
unexciting. The exception of the
band was guitarist and vocalist,
Dave Sharp. A Dylan
alike. Sharp moved all over the
stage and was unabashed in con
fronting the audience. His sing

ing was filled with emotion and
his face mirrored a raw passion
which captivated the crowd.
Other pluses in The Alarm's
performance were the use of the
harmonica and the sound it
achieved in the small house at
Wolfgang's. At its best. The
Alarm shows a great deal of po
tential with its streamlined,
basic rock set-up, its accessi
ble lyrics and the showmanship
of Sharp. As openers for both
U2 and The Pretenders, The
Alarm is still one of the more
worthwhile acts to emerge this
year. With some more experi
ence, The Alarm may well be an
act to keep your eye on.
