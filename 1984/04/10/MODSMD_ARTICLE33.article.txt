# Marvin Gaye: A tribute to depth and edge
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry,
But these tears / can 7 hold inside,
Losing you would end my life you see,
'Cause you mean that much to me.
I have regarded these lines from "1 Heard It
Through the Grapevine" as some of the most
emotionally gripping in the history of rock
music, but when I heard them sung hours after
Marvin Gaye's tragic killing, they took on an
even more intense meaning. I was stunned and
shocked, and I know a man ain't supposed to
cry, but I did anyhow.
I was in the midst of a small party with a
bunch of my friends, drunk and having a fine
time, when I heard on the radio that Marvin
Gaye had been fatally shot by his father, who
was a reverend nonetheless. As it was April 1,
my party-mates assured me that it was an April
Fool's prank. However, it proved not to be,
and although my party kept on going, I didn't.
The radio station played an hour's worth of
Gaye's greatest material, and it was a very
moving hour. How senseless a murder and
such a musical loss. He would have been only
45 a day after his death, and losing him espe
cially during his recent musical re-emergence
only adds to the tragedy. "What's Goin' On,"
indeed.
Marvin Gaye, born in Washington, D.C., in
1939, joined Motown shortly after it began
pressing records in the early 19605. Originally
employed as a session drummer, he soon
proved himself to be a supreme vocal talent.
Easily the grittiest and bluesiest mainstay in
the "Motown Family," Gaye was a soul artist
more in the tradition of Otis Redding rather
than Motown's own Smokey Robinson. This is
not to say that Gaye didn't record soft ballads
or easy pop. which he did. What it means is
that he always put a harsh emotional depth and
edge into all of his material, and therefore, his
music sounded more and dirty.
In fact, this "hardness" was what made him
so unique and influential at the time, especially
in regard to how the British Invasion rock
bands respected and tried to emulate his
sound. Mick Jagger patterned much of his vo
cal mannerisms and phrasings on Gaye, and
the Stones tributed him by recording both
"Hitch-hike" and "Can I Get A Witness."
John Lennon's favorite singer (in 1965, at
least) was Marvin Gaye, and Paul McCartney
wrote the soulful "Got To Get You Into My
Life," with Gaye's style in mind. And the
Kinks (along with every garage/bar band since)
recorded a version of "Dancing In The Street,"
a classic rocker which Gaye co-wrote for
Martha and the Vandellas to sing.
After some more hits, the best of which are
"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You),"
"I'll Be Doggone" and "Ain't That Peculiar,"
Gaye teamed up with a number of Motown's
female singers for a series of highly sensual
ballad type tunes. His finest and purest soul
singing was presented in this period which
reached its height when he teamed with Tammi
Terrell in the years 1967 and 1968. They re
corded intense, soulful love songs like, "Ain't
Nothin' Like The Real Tiling," "You're All I
Need To Get By," "Your Precious Love" and
and the heart-stopping "Ain't No Mountain
High Enough."
However, Gaye had his eyes set on broader
musical horizons. His problem, though, was
that he was still only a part in Motown's ma
chinery production line. He enjoyed consistent
Top-10 success, but he had never gained the

"monster" hit which would garner him enough
respect and power within Motown to expand
his musical sound in his own way. He needed a
"monster" to give him musical freedom. And
"1 Heard It Through The Grapevine" did just
that. Released in late 1968, "Grapevine" was
one of the most ominous, terror-filled walls of
sound ever put on vinyl. Gaye sang it as if he
was entering the gates of hell. It was Motown's
finest hour and it remains Motown's largest
selling record to date.
Therefore, with the success of "Grapevine,"
Gaye was able to pursue his own musical vision
which relied on his growing songwriting tal
ents. Laying low (except for the wonderful
"Too Busy Thinking About My Baby," in
1969,) Gaye was working on what was to be
the first black concept album. As it would be
called What's Going On, (released 1971) was
far beyond anything ever recorded by a black
artist. The album was a social commentary
coming from the black perspective and experi
ence. It was the first Motown album to be writ
ten, produced and arranged by the recording
artist, and it consisted of extrapolations on ur
ban and ghetto life, pollution and politics. Yet,
even with such "serious" lyrics, Gaye touched
a musical groove which spawned three huge
hits â€” "What's Goin' On," "Mercy, Mercy Me
(The Ecology)" and "Inner City Blues (Make
Me Wanna Holler)." Without a doubt, What's
Going On was the most important work in
Gaye's career as it paved the way for other
black artists to write, produce and record their
own thoughts. Stevie Wonder's whole career in
the '70s is an outgrowth of What's Going On,
and there is no major black performer who
hasn't been affected by this album.
Strangely enough, for his next work, Gaye
moved from social commentary to sexual com
mentary. Let's Get ItOn{\9l3) was a startling,
dynamic erotic work which lived up to its
name. However, the problem was where do
you go next especially after you've just written
"You Sure Love To Ball"? Therefore, for the
rest of the '70s, Gaye lost sight of his musical
direction and tumbled from the charts. He
even lost sight of his life and he went through a
bleak period which saw him getting divorced,
losing his record contract with Motown and
filing for bankruptcy. Even the No. 1 hit, "Got
To Give It Up," in 1977, couldn't pull Gaye
out of the shambles his life and work were in.
Thankfully, after lost years, he re-emerged
in 1982 in classic form. Taking over where
Let's Get It On left off, Gaye found new musi
cal and spiritual love with Midnight Love. This
album (which had Gaye playing almost all the
instruments, in addition to his songwriting and
production credits) gave birth to the gorgeous
"Sexual Healing" which won a Grammy
Award for the best rhythm and blues song of
1982. It was a strong, positive album which
sparked new life and love into Gaye. He
toured extensively across the United States. I
was fortunate to see him perform last April at
the Circle Star Theater, and it was a wonder
fully long and emotion-raising show. He
seemed so at ease with his audience and still so
capable of generating a powerful musical en
ergy.
And that's how he leaves us. It's a shame
more won't have the chance to see him in live
performance. It's a shame that his new musical
revitalization will be cut short. Above all,
though, it is a shame that another human life is
taken before its time. At least the music
remains . . . but it "ain't nothing like the real
thing."
I know a man ain't supposed to cry,
But these tears / can 7 hold inside,
Losing you would end my life you see,
'Cause you mean that much to me.

edge into all of his material, and therefore, his
music sounded more and dirty.
In fact, this "hardness" was what made him
so unique and influential at the time, especially
in regard to how the British Invasion rock
bands respected and tried to emulate his
sound. Mick Jagger patterned much of his vo
cal mannerisms and phrasings on Gaye, and
the Stones tributed him by recording both
"Hitch-hike" and "Can I Get A Witness."
John Lennon's favorite singer (in 1965, at
least) was Marvin Gaye, and Paul McCartney
wrote the soulful "Got To Get You Into My
Life," with Gaye's style in mind. And the
Kinks (along with every garage/bar band since)
recorded a version of "Dancing In The Street,"
a classic rocker which Gaye co-wrote for
Martha and the Vandellas to sing.
After some more hits, the best of which are
"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You),"
"I'll Be Doggone" and "Ain't That Peculiar,"
Gaye teamed up with a number of Motown's
female singers for a series of highly sensual
ballad type tunes. His finest and purest soul
singing was presented in this period which
reached its height when he teamed with Tammi
Terrell in the years 1967 and 1968. They re
corded intense, soulful love songs like, "Ain't
Nothin' Like The Real Tiling," "You're All I
Need To Get By," "Your Precious Love" and
and the heart-stopping "Ain't No Mountain
High Enough."
However, Gaye had his eyes set on broader
musical horizons. His problem, though, was
that he was still only a part in Motown's ma
chinery production line. He enjoyed consistent
Top-10 success, but he had never gained the

"monster" hit which would garner him enough
respect and power within Motown to expand
his musical sound in his own way. He needed a
"monster" to give him musical freedom. And
"1 Heard It Through The Grapevine" did just
that. Released in late 1968, "Grapevine" was
one of the most ominous, terror-filled walls of
sound ever put on vinyl. Gaye sang it as if he
was entering the gates of hell. It was Motown's
finest hour and it remains Motown's largest
selling record to date.
Therefore, with the success of "Grapevine,"
Gaye was able to pursue his own musical vision
which relied on his growing songwriting tal
ents. Laying low (except for the wonderful
"Too Busy Thinking About My Baby," in
1969,) Gaye was working on what was to be
the first black concept album. As it would be
called What's Going On, (released 1971) was
far beyond anything ever recorded by a black
artist. The album was a social commentary
coming from the black perspective and experi
ence. It was the first Motown album to be writ
ten, produced and arranged by the recording
artist, and it consisted of extrapolations on ur
ban and ghetto life, pollution and politics. Yet,
even with such "serious" lyrics, Gaye touched
a musical groove which spawned three huge
hits â€” "What's Goin' On," "Mercy, Mercy Me
(The Ecology)" and "Inner City Blues (Make
Me Wanna Holler)." Without a doubt, What's
Going On was the most important work in
Gaye's career as it paved the way for other
black artists to write, produce and record their
own thoughts. Stevie Wonder's whole career in
the '70s is an outgrowth of What's Going On,
and there is no major black performer who
hasn't been affected by this album.
Strangely enough, for his next work, Gaye
moved from social commentary to sexual com
mentary. Let's Get ItOn{\9l3) was a startling,
dynamic erotic work which lived up to its
name. However, the problem was where do
you go next especially after you've just written
"You Sure Love To Ball"? Therefore, for the
rest of the '70s, Gaye lost sight of his musical
direction and tumbled from the charts. He
even lost sight of his life and he went through a
bleak period which saw him getting divorced,
losing his record contract with Motown and
filing for bankruptcy. Even the No. 1 hit, "Got
To Give It Up," in 1977, couldn't pull Gaye
out of the shambles his life and work were in.
Thankfully, after lost years, he re-emerged
in 1982 in classic form. Taking over where
Let's Get It On left off, Gaye found new musi
cal and spiritual love with Midnight Love. This
album (which had Gaye playing almost all the
instruments, in addition to his songwriting and
production credits) gave birth to the gorgeous
"Sexual Healing" which won a Grammy
Award for the best rhythm and blues song of
1982. It was a strong, positive album which
sparked new life and love into Gaye. He
toured extensively across the United States. I
was fortunate to see him perform last April at
the Circle Star Theater, and it was a wonder
fully long and emotion-raising show. He
seemed so at ease with his audience and still so
capable of generating a powerful musical en
ergy.
And that's how he leaves us. It's a shame
more won't have the chance to see him in live
performance. It's a shame that his new musical
revitalization will be cut short. Above all,
though, it is a shame that another human life is
taken before its time. At least the music
remains . . . but it "ain't nothing like the real
thing."
I know a man ain't supposed to cry,
But these tears / can 7 hold inside,
Losing you would end my life you see,
'Cause you mean that much to me.
I have regarded these lines from "1 Heard It
Through the Grapevine" as some of the most
emotionally gripping in the history of rock
music, but when I heard them sung hours after
Marvin Gaye's tragic killing, they took on an
even more intense meaning. I was stunned and
shocked, and I know a man ain't supposed to
cry, but I did anyhow.
I was in the midst of a small party with a
bunch of my friends, drunk and having a fine
time, when I heard on the radio that Marvin
Gaye had been fatally shot by his father, who
was a reverend nonetheless. As it was April 1,
my party-mates assured me that it was an April
Fool's prank. However, it proved not to be,
and although my party kept on going, I didn't.
The radio station played an hour's worth of
Gaye's greatest material, and it was a very
moving hour. How senseless a murder and
such a musical loss. He would have been only
45 a day after his death, and losing him espe
cially during his recent musical re-emergence
only adds to the tragedy. "What's Goin' On,"
indeed.
Marvin Gaye, born in Washington, D.C., in
1939, joined Motown shortly after it began
pressing records in the early 19605. Originally
employed as a session drummer, he soon
proved himself to be a supreme vocal talent.
Easily the grittiest and bluesiest mainstay in
the "Motown Family," Gaye was a soul artist
more in the tradition of Otis Redding rather
than Motown's own Smokey Robinson. This is
not to say that Gaye didn't record soft ballads
or easy pop. which he did. What it means is
that he always put a harsh emotional depth and
edge into all of his material, and therefore, his
music sounded more and dirty.
