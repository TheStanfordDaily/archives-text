### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
A "series of misfortunes" left stacks of the
spring quarter ASSU C ourse Guide sitting on a
campus loading dock awaiting delivery, according
to ASSU Project Manager Kate Niccolls.
While the Course Guide was delivered to
campus from printers on March 5, the first day ot
advanced registration, Niccolls said it was lost on
campus and not widely distributed until this week.
"We went to where it was supposed to he
delivered, but we couldn t find it and we assumed
that it was late, which was stupid. Ihe printer had
warned us that it might be late so we didn t tele

The Course Guide, which comes out three times
a year, contains course evaluations and abstracts ot
each quarter's classes. The approximate $4000

our life outside the Course Guide.
"When we did find it there was only one or two
days left of the pre-reg period. We put as big a
bulk as we could on several campus locations,
said Niccolls. However, the actual number of
copies that were delivered on campus before the
end of winter quarter was only about 375 out of
the 4500 printed guides.
Instead of distibuting the guides throughout
finals week and at registration this quarter it was
postponed another week. About halt the remain
ing guides were delivered to spots on campus over
the weekend, and others were delivered to new
housing last night, and the remainder will be given
to the faculty today.
But the course evaluations and abstracts may be
arriving late to aid students in deciding what
