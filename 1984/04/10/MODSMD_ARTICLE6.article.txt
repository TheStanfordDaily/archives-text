# Streleski testifies
## Parole decision due Friday 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer With wire reports 
Testifying at a parole revocation
hearing yesterday afternoon, con
victed murderer Theodore Streleski
claimed that his March 8 threats not to
comply with his parole regulations did
not constitute a parole violation.
A two-person Board of Prison
Terms panel, following extensive tes
timony, postponed the decision on the
47-year-old killer's release until
Friday.
Streleski, the slayer of Mathematics
Prof. Karel deLeeuw, was paroled last
month after serving five-and-one-half
years of his eight-year sentence, but
was returned to prison just three hours
after his release when he indicated
that he would not honor his parole
regulations.
Unhappy with the stipulation of his
parole, that he live in Orange County
and not return to the Bay Area,
Streleski opted to remain in jail. He
stated on the day of his release that he
intended to violate his parole immedi
ately in a non-violent fashion, so that
he could serve the remainder of his
sentence and then leave prison with no
restrictions.
He repeated his claim yesterday
that Stanford officials pressured the
state to change his original San Fran
cisco parole destination because he
refused to promise to stay away from
the University.
Streleski, who feels Stanford
blocked his 19-year quest to earn a
doctorate degree, said he killed
deLeeuw to make a statement about
the way Stanford treats its graduate
students.

He told the two-person panel yes
terday that accepting his scheduled
Orange County parole "makes me
look insincere" in a stance against
Stanford. "It 1 am publicly known to
accept parole changes that are increas
ingly pro-Stanfordhe said, "it soft
ens my criticism of Stanford."
StreJeski said again yesterday after
noon that he would rather go back to
prison than comply with conditions he

blamed on the "power and arrogance"
of the University.
Being paroled to Orange County
under Stanford pressure is "worse
than being in incarceration," he said at
the hearing.
He and his state-appointed attor
ney, Michael McGowan of West
Sacramento, indicated they would ac
cept parole to the San Francisco area.
If the prison board determines that
Streleski violated parole, he could
remain in jail for a maximum of six
months. He would then be re-released
and could receive two additional six
month sentences if he again violated
his parole. After 18 months, he must
be unconditionally discharged.
But if the board decides Streleski
did not violate his regulations, he will
be released following the Friday an
nouncement.
During the four-hour hearing at the
Vacaville State Medical Facility,
Streleski denied that he violated his
parole on March 8. He said he only
told parole officials that he intended
to do so when he arrived in Orange
County.
Once again, Streleski refused to
promise he would not return to
campus.
"In a formal public proceeding, I
won't promise that," he said, "but in
my head right now . . . there's no in
tention of ever setting foot on the
campus of Stanford University."
Streleski's announced parole gained
national attention in January when he
told reporters he was "noncommittal"
about murdering again and said he felt
no remorse for the deLeeuw killing.
Corrections Department officials
then transferred him from Soledad

Prison to Vacaville to undergo a psy
chiatric evaluation before his parole.
Doctors there found no clinical basis
to block the parole, but officials even
tually decided not to release Streleski
in the Bay Area, where he hopes to
reside, after San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein and University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy met with auth
orities to request an alternate loca
tion.
