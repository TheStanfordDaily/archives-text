# USW raps use of temporary workers
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
Officials of the United Stanford Workers
(USW) are accusing the University of using
temporary workers to replace members of the
USW bargaining unit.
USW president Linda Crouse claims the use
of "permanent temporaries" violates "the in
tent of the contract" USW has with the Univer
sity.
Michael Vartain, associate staff counsel for
the University, said the University needs tem
poraries to respond to fluctuating workloads.
He added that the use of temporaries serves to
protect the regular staff.
"If there are reductions in workload and
there are temporaries on the staff, then the reg
ular staff positions can be protected," he said.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to University
President Donald Kennedy, said Kennedy
would not comment at this time.
Crouse claims the existence of significant
numbers of temporary workers in almost all
campus labor shops over a period of many
months — and in some cases years — serves to
discredit the University's rationale.
"Management justifies using temporaries at
all because there are peak loads in work. When
shops hire continuous streams of temporaries
year after year, then that is an attack on our
bargaining unit." she said.
Vartain disagreed and said the University af
firms the collective agreement between
the University and USW. Vartain also pointed
out that union grievances with the University's
labor policies could be brought before an inde
pendent arbitrator.
Crouse said the union would soon press such
grievances. "We intend to begin that kind of
challenge now," she said.
She called the University's use of temporaries
as an effort to weaken the USW and said the

University prefers temporary workers because
it can "keep them out of the union" where
"they have no rights."
"It undercuts the union if half the people in
the labor shop are non-union," she said.
George Nano, field representative of USW,
agreed. Nano feels the University, "not unlike
other management," wants to "break the
union."
"They refuse to recognize that workers have
a right to representation," he added.
Kent Peterson, associate vice-president of
Business and Finance, disagreed. "There's not

Says temporary workers undermine USW
an anti-labor sort of bias at Stanford," he said.
"The people who work for Stanford, whether in
the union or not, are very important to us," he
added.
The 19K2 agreement between USW and the
University recognizes that the "regular staft of
many University shops is part of the USW bar
gaining unit. "Regular staff," however, refers
only to "employees in positions requiring at

least 20 hours per week for a period actually
lasting at least four months."
Crouse explained that this clause allows lie
University to hire temporary workers for peri
ods of up to four months — if a worker stays on
for four months, the worker becomes part of
the bargaining unit.
According to Crouse, the University gets
around this four-month restriction in two ways.
The first, used in the labor and grounds shops,
is by hiring temporaries through outside
agencies, such as Greyhound and Manpower,
and thus never actually having the workers on
the Stanford payroll.
The second, she said, involves hiring tempo
rary labor for periods just under four months;
the worker is then "laid off' for a week or so,
and is then rehired for another 14- or 15-week
stint. Crouse said the electric shop is one place
where this second practice is common.
Several workers in the electric shop affirm
Crouse's claim. One electrician, who spoke on
the condition that he not be named, said that
three years ago, the shop let go of three
workers; one was fired and two were brought
back: one as a temporary and the other as a
fixed-term employee.
A fixed-term employee is paid on the bar
gaining unit pay scale, enjoys full bargaining
unit benefits but is hired only for an agreed
upon length of time. A temporary is paid a set
wage, enjoys no benefits and is subject to dis
missal at the sole discretion of the employer.
USW bargaining unit benefits include vaca
tions, medical and dental coverage, accrued sick
leave, a pension plan and the right to file griev
ances with management.
The electric shop temporary was laid off just
before he had worked four months. After a
week or so off the job, he was rehired. Accord-


Linda Crouse
ing to the electrician, this process was
repeated at least three times until fi
nally the worker got "fed up" and
went to work for the City of Palo Alto.
Several electric shop workers
claimed this practice is used routinely
in hiring and firing temporaries in the
shop. They said that of the 13 workers
presently in the shop, five are tem
poraries, and the shop has had at least
two temporaries for the last three
years.
Leonard Duz, supervisor of the
electric shop, confirmed that the shop
hires temporary workers for 90- to
100-day periods, lays them off and of
ten rehires them.
"If you hire them over 120 days, we
have to keep them permanent," he
said.
Duz claimed the practice exists to
avoid terminating permanent jobs.
"Stanford hates to hire permanent
people and then lay them off," he ex
plained.
Electrical shop temporaries are paid
$15 an hour. Bargaining unit members
at step one, the first 90 days of em
ployment. make $11.78 an hour and
step four members, attained after two

years at Stanford, earn $13.76 an
hour.
An electric shop worker claimed
that it is advantageous for the Univer
sity to hire temporaries, even if they
are paid more, because the cost of the
benefits and the value of job security
are worth far more than the difference
in pay.
Darryl Davillier, USW executive
committee member and an alternate
steward in the labor shop, said that of
the 14 workers presently in the labor
shop, seven of them are temporaries.
Davillier claimed that four years ago,
there were six regular workers and
two temporaries, while three years ago
there were six regulars and four tem
poraries.
"There have been at least two tem
poraries in recent years. When more
people were hired, they were always
temporaries," he said. "When need
was low, they simply transferred the
temporaries to the grounds shop," he
added.
According to Davillier. temporaries
in the labor shop make $6.50 an hour
with no union benefits. Bargaining
unit members performing the same
work make between $7.52 and $8.73
an hour with full benefits.
Members of the grounds shop said
that eight temporaries work alongside
bargaining unit members. The tem
poraries are paid between $5 and

$6.50 an hour for work that pays be
tween $7.52 and $9.7N an hour to bar
gaining unit employees.
One temporary, speaking on the
condition that he not be named, said
he has been working at Stanford for
more than two years. When he started,
he was on the the Stanford payroll at
$6 an hour. Three months later, he
was transferred to the Manpower em
ployment agency's payroll, still at $6
an hour. Almost two years later, he is
still on the Manpower pay roll at $6 an
hour with no bargaining unit benefits.
Crouse charged that had he been
part of the bargaining unit when he
was hired, he would now be making
$y.78 an hour with full benefits.
Jessie Solorio is another temporary
hired through an outside agency.
Solorio was hired about a year ago
through Greyhound employment and
has worked as a laborer, maintainence
person and mechanic. The bargaining
unit pay scales for these jobs vary
from $7.52 to $1 1.25 an hour.
Solorio was hired at $5 an hour. He
said he is paid from the Stanford
payroll for about 14 or 15 weeks out
of each four-month period. For the
remaining week or two. he gets his
paychecks from Greyhound before
being returned to the University
payroll. He pointed out that he is thus
never on the Stanford payroll for any
continuous four-month period.

Solorio claimed that about three
months ago he learned that Stanford
paid Greyhound a $3-an-hour fee for
every hour Solorio worked. While
Greyhound paid him $5 an hour.
Stanford would pay Greyhound $N an
hour. Solorio sa\s he confronted his
supervisors with this information and
at that time his wage was raised to its
present $7.50 an hour.
Solorio said he doesn't know how
much Stanford pays Greyhound now.
Greyhound official Debbie Galdin
declined to comment on University
contracts.
Supervisor of grounds Herb Fong
defended Stanford's use of tem
poraries as necessary. He claimed that
a rapidly shifting workload with ex
treme peaks and valleys makes the
hiring of permanent workers impracti
cal.
"The bargaining unit contract limits
use of temporaries to a four-month
period," he said.
Crouse said the almost constant
number of temporaries over the last
two years — eight this year, nine last
year — shows that permanent workers
are in fact needed.
"There is a need for these guys to
work." she said. "They're not paying
them for the fun of it." She added that
the temporaries "should be hired with
full union rights."
Fong said the fairly constant

workload over the last two years has
influenced the University to create
and fill five permanent positions in
grounds. He said the temporaries
present!) working in grounds will he
considered for the job> hut that man
agement will look elsewhere as well to
"expand the pool" and find the "hest
qualified people" for the jobs.
" Our position is that the tem
poraries who have worked there (at
Stanford) month after month — espe
cially those that have worked there for
over a year - should he hired for
those positions." Crouse said.
