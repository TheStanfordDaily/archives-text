# USW raps use of temporary workers
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
Officials of the United Stanford Workers
(USW) are accusing the University of using
temporary workers to replace members of the
USW bargaining unit.
USW president Linda Crouse claims the use
of "permanent temporaries" violates "the in
tent of the contract" USW has with the Univer
sity.
Michael Vartain, associate staff counsel for
the University, said the University needs tem
poraries to respond to fluctuating workloads.
He added that the use of temporaries serves to
protect the regular staff.
"If there are reductions in workload and
there are temporaries on the staff, then the reg
ular staff positions can be protected," he said.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to University
President Donald Kennedy, said Kennedy
would not comment at this time.
Crouse claims the existence of significant
numbers of temporary workers in almost all
campus labor shops over a period of many
months — and in some cases years — serves to
discredit the University's rationale.
"Management justifies using temporaries at
all because there are peak loads in work. When
shops hire continuous streams of temporaries
year after year, then that is an attack on our
bargaining unit." she said.
Vartain disagreed and said the University af
firms the collective agreement between
the University and USW. Vartain also pointed
out that union grievances with the University's
labor policies could be brought before an inde
pendent arbitrator.
Crouse said the union would soon press such
grievances. "We intend to begin that kind of
challenge now," she said.
She called the University's use of temporaries
as an effort to weaken the USW and said the

University prefers temporary workers because
it can "keep them out of the union" where
"they have no rights."
"It undercuts the union if half the people in
the labor shop are non-union," she said.
George Nano, field representative of USW,
agreed. Nano feels the University, "not unlike
other management," wants to "break the
union."
"They refuse to recognize that workers have
a right to representation," he added.
Kent Peterson, associate vice-president of
Business and Finance, disagreed. "There's not

Says temporary workers undermine USW
an anti-labor sort of bias at Stanford," he said.
"The people who work for Stanford, whether in
the union or not, are very important to us," he
added.
The 19K2 agreement between USW and the
University recognizes that the "regular staft of
many University shops is part of the USW bar
gaining unit. "Regular staff," however, refers
only to "employees in positions requiring at

least 20 hours per week for a period actually
lasting at least four months."
Crouse explained that this clause allows lie
University to hire temporary workers for peri
ods of up to four months — if a worker stays on
for four months, the worker becomes part of
the bargaining unit.
According to Crouse, the University gets
around this four-month restriction in two ways.
The first, used in the labor and grounds shops,
is by hiring temporaries through outside
agencies, such as Greyhound and Manpower,
and thus never actually having the workers on
the Stanford payroll.
The second, she said, involves hiring tempo
rary labor for periods just under four months;
the worker is then "laid off' for a week or so,
and is then rehired for another 14- or 15-week
stint. Crouse said the electric shop is one place
where this second practice is common.
Several workers in the electric shop affirm
Crouse's claim. One electrician, who spoke on
the condition that he not be named, said that
three years ago, the shop let go of three
workers; one was fired and two were brought
back: one as a temporary and the other as a
fixed-term employee.
A fixed-term employee is paid on the bar
gaining unit pay scale, enjoys full bargaining
unit benefits but is hired only for an agreed
upon length of time. A temporary is paid a set
wage, enjoys no benefits and is subject to dis
missal at the sole discretion of the employer.
USW bargaining unit benefits include vaca
tions, medical and dental coverage, accrued sick
leave, a pension plan and the right to file griev
ances with management.
The electric shop temporary was laid off just
before he had worked four months. After a
week or so off the job, he was rehired. Accord-
