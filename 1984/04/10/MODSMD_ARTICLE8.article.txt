Reagan disdains Soviet tone
Washington — The chairman of the President's Commis
sion on Strategic Forces said yesterday that the political at
mosphere between the United States and the Soviet Union is
"as had as it's been in my memory" and warned that adminis
tration rhetoric has helped exacerbate East-West tensions.
But I t. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the retired Air Force officer
who also was national security adviser to President Gerald
Ford, said that while President Reagan's words have
sometimes been inflammatory, administration actions have
not.
And Scowcroft said that the chances of nuclear war "tend
to be decreasing" as the incentives for nuclear surprise attack
diminish.
Reflecting the continued chill in U.S.-Soviet relations,
White House spokesman Larry Speakesearlier in the day said
that President Reagan was "disappointed by the tone" of
remarks made Sunday by Soviet leader Konstantin Cher
nenko. Chernenko dismissed recent U.S. overtures as
"peace-loving rhetoric" and indicated he sees no prospects of
a superpower rapprochement during this election year.
Chernenko denied the suggestion frequently made in
Washington that Moscow, hoping to damage President
Reagan's re-election chances, has decided not to revive rela
tions with the United States until after the November
presidential elections.
Soviets want Olympic meeting
Moscow — The Soviet Olympic Committee, alleging viola
tions of the Olympic charter by the United States, called yes
terday for an "emergency" meeting of the International
Olympic Committee to review the charges.
In a statement carried official Soviet press agency Tass, the
Soviet committee complained that an anti-Soviet campaign
was being mounted in the United States with "open threats of
physical victimization and provocative actions." Citing provi
sions of the Olympic charter, the Soviets also demanded as
surances that all members of the Soviet Olympic delegation
would be allowed into the United States.
The statement was the harshest and most authoritative at
tack on arrangements for the 1984 Summer Games in Los
Angeles in two years of steady criticism by Soviet officials and
the state press. It stopped short of directly threatening a
boycott ot the 1 984 Games, but it noted pointedly that "the
time is ever nearer for the national Olympic Committees to
take a decision on participation in the Olympic games."
I lie deadline for formal entry in the Los Angeles Games is
June 2. eight weeks before the games begin on July 28.
A spokesman tor the U.S. Embassy in Moscow said he had
"no comment on the general thrust of the ridiculous charges."
Shuttle readies satellite rescue
Houston — Flight controllers here succeeded yesterday in
stopping the tumbling of the Solar Maximum satellite and
preparations were completed for today's last-ditch effort by
the astronauts aboard the space shuttle Challenger to rescue
the ailing satellite.
The shuttle astronauts will rendezvous with the sun
observation satellite this morning and try to grab it with the
shuttle's robot arm. Space agency officials were confident that
the satellite rescue would succeed.
"There is now a high probability of success," Flight Direc
tor John Cox said yesterday afternoon.
If Solar Max is captured and berthed in the shuttle's cargo
bay, astronauts George Nelson and James van Hoften will
repair it tomorrow in a six-hour tethered spacewalk. The
satellite would be returned to space Thursday, completing the
repair mission that was the primary task of the current shuttle
(light, and Challenger would return to the Kennedy Space
Center near Cape Canaveral, Fla., Friday.
"We just got lucky," another flight director. Jay Greene,
said yesterday morning after the satellite and the repair mis
sion were rescued from oblivion.
Jackson's PUSH organization
must refund $700,000 grant
Washington — The Department of Education ordered Op
eration PUSH, the self-help civil rights and educational or
ganization tounded by Jesse Jackson, to refund more than
$700.000 in federal grant money yesterday that the govern
ment said PUSH had spent improperly.
After an eight-month dispute with the Chicago-based
group. Department of Education auditors said PUSH for Ex
cellence Inc.. the educational arm of the operation, still had
undocumented federal disbursements totaling $708,431 that
it must pay back. The PUSH-EXCEL program, as it is
known, aims at encouraging young blacks to stay in school
and improve their grades.
Government auditors said the funds apparently were spent
from 1978 to 1981 for salaries and expenses of PUSH staff
members and for "overhead" items such as insurance and
utilities — but without proper documentation showing that
the expenditures were related to the intent of the federal
grants.

Year of Living Dangerously, won the best supporting actress
award — the first time an Oscar has gone to a performer
playing a character of the opposite sex.
"I'm going to cry because this show has been as long as my
career." said an overjoyed MacLaine, who had been
nominated four times previously but never won. Among her
competition was Debra Winger, who played her daughter.
Duvall, clad in country garb, told the audience that he and
his fellow filmmakers had "set out to make a truthful film"
