From The Washington Post
Washington —The CIA views its involvement in the
laying of mines in ports off Nicaragua as part of a
"holding action" until its covert war against that
country's leftist Sandinista government can be stepped
up if President Reagan wins re-election, according to
senior administration officials.
Administration officials said the mine-laying was |tis
tified by intelligence reports pointing to a major au
tumn offensive by leftist rebels in nearby El Salvador.
One official close to the intelligence community said
that "tons of material are flowing into El Salvador"
from Nicaragua for the offensive, which the officials
said could compare to the "Tct offensive" in Vietnam
in 1968.
While acknowledging that the ClA's direct involve
ment in the mining of Nicaraguan ports carries signifi
cant political and diplomatic risks, this official said it is
intended to "harass" Nicaragua, rather than to produce
any immediate military objective in Central America.
If Reagan wins re-election, however, according to

another senior official, "the president is determined to
go all out to gain the upper hand" over leftist forces in
the region. Such a stepped-up effort is likely to involve
substantially more money tor U.S.-supported forces in
the region, rather than the introduction of U.S. troops,
this official said.
The laying of underwater mines was approved after
the administration considered and rejected a much
greater expansion of the covert war late last year, ac
cording to officials.
At one point, when necessary support from Congress
was not forthcoming, the White House asked the CIA it
it could divert money from other operations or "slush
funds" for operations in Central America. The CIA
responded with a legal opinion advising against any at
tempt to skirt the letter or spirit of congressional over
sight.
"The CIA has become very strict on that and does
not want to get into any problems like those in the
past," one White House official said.
CIA officials reportedly said that the harbor-mining

operation was within the guidelines laid down by
Contiress lor the covert war. Congressional intelligence
oversiuht committees were not notified about the min
ing before it began, ottieials said.
The CIA began directing mining operations in
several Nicarauuan ports about two months ago. accor
ding to officials. The mines are dropped from ClA
owned speedboats operated by U.S.-backed
Nicaraeuan rebels and specially trained Latin Ameri
can employes ot the C lA.
The operation is directed from a larger CIA vessel
that sta\s in international waters, the officials said. That
ship is equipped with a helicopter which provides air
cover for the mine-laying operations, they added.
The mines are described as crude "home-made*
devices triggered by the noise ot ships passing over
them. They may cause extensive damage but are
unlikely to sink large ships, officials said. "It is not de
signed to kill am one." one official added.
