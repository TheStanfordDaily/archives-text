Stage Struck
Perform to your heart's content!
\XAietheryou ve chosen Music, Theatre or
Interpretation, at Summer Session you'll learn
by doing.
Take courses that offer opportunities to perform
in the Summer Drama Festival, the Concert
Band, the Community Chorus, or the Presen
tational Aesthetics ensemble.
But if a stage career isn't your goal, consider our
alternatives. From African-American studies and
Business to Computer Science, Radio-TV-Film
and Urban Studies. Over 270 courses including
our eight-week, Concentrated Study program.
And because Summer should be more than
grades and studying, enjoy our private beach,
tennis, sailing, and free concerts on the lawn.
For the entire picture and complete registration
details, request our Course Bulletin.
