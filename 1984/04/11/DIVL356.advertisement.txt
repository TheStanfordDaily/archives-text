This Summer
At Cornell University you can enjoy a
remarkable variety of courses and
learning opportunities. In a setting of
beautiful lakes, parks, ravines, and
waterfalls, you can fulfill requirements,
accelerate your degree program, or
simply take the courses that you've
always put off. Ithaca, a small
cosmopolitan city, is located in a
magnificent, varied countryside that
offers you water sports and ball games,
climbing and camping, theater and
outdoor concerts, soaring and biking,
birding and hiking... Call or write to see
for yourself why Cornell is the place you
should be this summer.
