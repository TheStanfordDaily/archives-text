# ASSU OKs contingent funds
## In case groups lose fee assessment vote 
### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate approved up to
$6000 for each of seven campus or
ganizations last night, effectively
guaranteeing those groups funds
regardless of how students vote in next
week's fee assessment elections.
"If the students say 'yes' to the fee
requests then we'll do nothing, and if
they say 'no,' we'll say 'yes' anyway,"
said graduate senator Eric Berg. "I
really don't see why we should wait
until after the election and then have a
number of random groups beating
down the door for funds," he said.
The ASSU Lobby Office, Stanford
Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum and Stanford Modern Arts Or
ganization (SMARTOR) will each
receive $6000 as part of a proposal
Berg submitted.
By a 16-0 vote, the senate also ap
proved $3725 for the Stanford Pro

gressive Alliance and $4200 each for
the ASSU Speakers Bureau and the
Black Student Union.
In a separate bill also submitted by
Berg, $6000 was approved for
Stanford- in-Government.
According to the approved bills, the
ASSU Senate will grant funds to any
of the organizations if students vote
down their larger special fee requests
in the April 17-18 election.
Proposing the bill before the senate,
Berg said the funds were to cover the
"valid expenses" of the groups.
"We assumed that the groups asked
for as much as they could get," he
said. "But if the student body votes
down $20,000, that doesn't mean the
group shouldn't receive $6000."
Undergraduate senator Mark Soble
spoke against the bill, specifically
against funding for the two ASSU
groups.
"We're supposed to be guided in

what we do by the student vote," he
said. "When ASSU groups don't get
approved, we don't necessarily have to
fund them just because they have valid
expenses."
Deputy senate chair Donna Ander
son supported the bill.
"We are the number one source of
revenue, and if any association has a
valid expense, then we should have
funding for them," she said.
Council-of-Presidents member Su
Uhland also spoke in favor of the bill.
"A lot of the election depends on
The Daily interviews and endorse
ments, and this just tries to clear up
some of the whimsicalness and diffi
culties of elections," she said.
Graduate senator Doug Puffert
from the School of Humanities and
Sciences proposed an amendment
which would limit funding for each

an unneeded rush on ASSU funds.
