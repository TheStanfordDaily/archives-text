When President Reagan says his administration
isn't willing to even consider the possibility ol
negotiating with the Soviet Union over space
weaponry, we're all in over our heads.
Part of it could be that the president jettisons
basic democratic principles when he decides not
t$ give an issue at least some sort of hearing.
But space weapons threaten something more
tangible. Experts agree that the sophisticated
hardware proposed by Reagan in last year's "Star
Wars" speech probably won't even begin to
"render nuclear weapons impotent and ob
solete."
And it's ironic that even if scientists do
mobilize in the name of patriotism and succeed in
filling the president's order, anti-satellite (ASA! )
and other systems promise to undermine, not un
derpin. U.S. security.
ASATs put into peril the very intelligence
gathering satellites crucial to U.S. defense.
Satellites let both nations verify weapons deploy
ment and testing, and interference with that sur
veillance could devastate our intelligence commu
nity. paralyzing existing arms control agreements.

Space-based anti-ballistic missile (ABM) sys
tems — lasers, particle beams and the like — have
at least one flaw. As Sidney Drell. deputy director
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, said at
a campus debate recently. "ABMs just don't
work, and I don't expect them to work in the fore
seeable future." Plans for possibly making them
work have been projected at around $500 billion.
And no guarantees.
Even if a successful ABM system is ultimately
devised, it's unlikely to make anyone secure.
In such a scenario, the Soviets would probably
be compelled to rush and catch up. Or maybe
they'd opt for a pre-emptive strike in hope of
knocking out our missiles while there's still time.
But isn't it worth a try? Not according to
Reagan's own special commission on strategic
forces, headed by Gen. Brent Scowcroft. The
same group that backed the MX missile threw the
whole ABM concept out the window of vul
nerability — and closed that window tightly.
We have the diplomatic option. While there's
still time, let's at least check it out — before we
send the arms race spilling into space.
