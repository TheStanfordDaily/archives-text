# LETTERS
## Funding unethical 
### 
By reading the title under my name
.it the bottom of this letter, one may
quickly discern that I hold many
points in contention with the Students
Against Reaganism political action
committee (STAR-PAC). I believe,
however, that readers who may not
agree with my political beliefs will
agree with the objections I now raise.
STAR-PAC. as described in the
Daily article of April 8, is unam
biguously anti-conservative and anti
administration. Insofar as their stated
goal is to "take on President
Reagan," 1 feel safe in defining them
as a partisan political group on par
with Stanford Students for Reagan
(SSR).
SSR chose to respect the non
partisan nature of the Public Policy
Conference held this weekend by the
Lobby Office (with assistance from
other student-funded organizations)
by not participating in the conference.
I object strongly to having STAR
PAC run registration for the confer
ence. The conference professed its
purpose as informing voters for the
1984 election of the issues involved
and the candidates' positions on these
issues. Because I was unable to attend
the conference. I cannot speak for the
other aspects of their program, but I
do see that the employment of a
partisan political group in an adminis
trate e capacity unquestionably
implies endorsement of this group.
1 voted in the fee assessment elec
tions believing the Lobby Office to be
non-partisan. This cooperation with
STAR-PAC not only undermines the
credibility of the Public Policy Con
ference (and future Lobby Office
programs) but also opens to question
the ethics employed by the office in
soliciting student funds.

Reagan
