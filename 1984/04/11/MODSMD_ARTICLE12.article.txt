# We need a new drug, we need it now

### 
Society is running out of good drugs.
That is a bold statement, I know. But I've
been seeing some crazed actions take place, all
born of the desperate, fruitless search for The
New Drug. You know, the one that won't make
you nervous, or make you feel too good or make
you sleep all day. Yes, Huey Lewis has estab
lished himself as a prophet for the 1980s.
But honestly. Some demented craziness has
been exhibited by those who have run out of
new highs, reaching the end of their list of Old
Drugs to try. The Old Drugs are suddenly not
good enough any more. I just wish my friend had
realized that before he did what he did.
I mean, I'd seen people begin to take their
Old Drugs in weird and different ways in order
to get new and different highs. 1 could handle
that. But it didn't make it any easier to watch
people take marijuana suppositories. It is pretty
twisted, I know, but the scary part was that we
were starting to accept it.
And get this: I've come to understand that
freebasing cocaine is old hat nowadays — the in
thing now is to mainline it with freon. Smoking
opium laced with mescaline is no longer suffici
ent; now people are smoking pieces of rug with
pillowcases. Straight ether is no longer enough
for some. And the demand for yohimbe is rising,
leaving serious shortages and exorbitant prices.
In short, the world of drugs is in disarray. Its
subtle fabric is disrupted, unravelling before us
to reveal the darker side of human motivations,
indeed, of human nature reacting to a confused
and depraved society. One should wonder about
what drug use means about society — it's prob
ably a pretty good indicator that something rot
ten is going on.
I just wish my friend knew this. Some very bad
lunacy could have been avoided.
It all started with spreading, pervading dissat
isfaction with the Old Drugs. My friend was
clearly unhappy with them. He didn't even both
er with the New Methods of Ingestion. Nah, he
skipped all that, going straight to heavy use of
yage, a substance that makes one drool uncon
trollably for 10 to 12 hours and then puts one in
a semi-comatose, paralyzed state for three days.
It was expensive, but evidently he found the ex
periences worth the cost. I had to wonder what
he was escaping from, though. It all did catch up
to him. And it caught up with me, too.

I never really was part of the drug scene. It all
seemed so ... well, ominous. I mean, I went
through the codeine/cough syrup stage, and then
the go-to-the-dentist-that-uses-nitrous-oxide
stage. I had put all that behind me. 1 was going
to be a new man. After all. we all know that drug
use of anv kind kills your brain cells, making you
want to rape and kill. Marijuana especially.
They don't call it reefer madness for nothing,
you know.

Acid, once the scare drug used by the Chinese
to subvert American society, is, I guess, OK
nowadays. But the scary thing is that you never
know when a random acid head, while casually
roaming the streets, will get a flashback of the
rabid, wheezing devil-bats sent from hell to suck
on people's toes. In that state he could perform
some really evil acts — but probably nothing
more than just whimpering quietly to a fire
hydrant. You don't want to take any chances
though. My advice to you is to carry a Louisville
Slugger with you at all times, and, just to be on
the safe side, gently whack anybody you see
whimpering to a fire hydrant. But 1 digress ....
My friend, you see, under the influence of
henbane and nutmeg, received instructions from
the Devil himself to pervert me with dangerous
drug. He was to achieve this dastardly act by sel
ling me large quantities of yage, no doubt to help
support his own vile habit. 1 didn't know the

Devil was in on it until the drug had taken hold
— at that point it was painfully clear. So I
figured that either I accepted my friend's offer,
or he would turn to a life of crime, mugging
street winos. I reluctantly consented. It's awfully
hard to condemn a friend to such a bleak life. I
was doing him a favor.
1 didn't mind the drooling so much. It was
kind of a neat, new experience. But I didn't like
the part when I couldn't move for three days. I

felt like my skin had become tough and scaly,
that my brain was hemorrhaging, and that my
nose was turning into a beak. I don't know about
you. but I like the sensation of being human.
And afterwards — boy, that was nasty. My
tongue felt like an old shag rug that the dog
would lie on when he came in from the rain.
Society has run out of good drugs. The situa
tion had perverted my friend to the point where
he would deliberately sell his friend down the
river for a cheap new high. You gotta wonder
about a society that fosters that kind of behav
ior.
Long gone are the simple days when dope and
acid and glue were enough to radically change
your brain's chemical composition and allow
new perspectives on life. No, now we seek self
destruction through elaborate drugs like PCP
and yage. There is something seriously wrong
here.

I saw Dr. Hunter Thompson at Berkeley a few
weeks ago. Besides being amazed by the hippies
and derelicts there. I was amazed when a male
Yoko Ono look-alike asked Hunter what the
new drug of the '80s was going to be. The es
teemed Dr. Gonzo of "Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas" fame did not have an answer. All he
could do was evade the question bv explaining
that he enjoyed his drugs — but only in modera
tion and for the deliberate purpose of revamping
his consciousness, and not to escape from hidden
fears or societal expectations and rules.
All this talk of drugs includes the licit
prescription drugs, like Valium, and. of course,
alcohol. Why are at least 30 million Americans
taking at least three billion Valium pills a year?
And how about the many more that take many
other tranquilizers? And how about the
widespread alcoholism that grips this country?
Wait a minute. So what do we have here? Are
we really running out of gotxl drugs, or is it that
people are using them for the wrong reasons?
Are people looking for new drugs, or are we
looking for new highs or new ways to cope with
stress or dissatisfaction?
If it's new drugs that we crave, then we can do
two things: 1) mix the existing drugs and take
them in different combinations to produce new,
dazzling and probably lethal effects; or 2) we
can allocate massive federal funds to hire labo
ratory scientists for the purpose of creating a
soma-like drug that everybody can be happy
with. Wouldn't it be great: a society full of
stupified zombies?
But if we're trying to get new highs, to find
new ways of coping, then a New Drug probably
won't help much. We've gotta start asking the
question "Why do we use licit and illicit drugs?"
Chances are that the answers are complex and
vary greatly from individual to individual, but
we can get indications about what is wrong with
society, and what people aren't happy with.
Maybe it will take more than laws and the LB I to
control drug traffic and drug use. Maybe it'll
take an approach that seeks to treat causes and
not symptoms. Or. maybe, it'll just take a New
Drug.
