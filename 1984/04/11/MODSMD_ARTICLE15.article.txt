## The 						ASSU: 'funding the Left for you' 
### 
On Oct. 25, 1983, the ASSU Senate passed a
resolution on the Reagan library complex, advo
cating acceptance of the library, but rejecting the
public affairs center out of concern for "the public
perception of the political orientation of the Uni
versity." The resolution was intended to demon
strate not that the ASSU is anti-Reagan but that it
was sincerely interested in preserving the Univer
sity's pristine non-partisan reputation.
The facade fell away last week, and the senate
showed its true colors, appropriating $140 to Stu
dents Against Reaganism, a federally-certified po
litical action committee. Such overt political activ
ity — the explicit use of student-derived funds for

VIEWPOINT

the targeting of select races in November —
threatens the University's tax-exempt status. What
is surprising is not that the ASSU approved the
money — the majority of student political groups
receiving ASSU money are hostile to the Reagan
administration — but that they gave it to such an
honestly named organization.
Through the Program Board (which is not di
rectly answerable to the student body) the ASSU
finances a host of of innocuously packaged groups
whose activities challenge the values of main
stream America. Take, for example, last
weekend's Voter Participation Conference,
sponsored by the Lobby Office. You will recall
that last spring the student body resoundingly
rejected the Lobby Office's fee assessment pro
posal. but the ASSU second-guessed the students
and gave them the money anyway. Now the ASSU
is proposing $6000 in contingency money "in the
event that their $16,000 Special Fee request fails
to be approved."
The conference's ostensible purpose was to in
crease \oter registration and to raise voter aware
ness — noble objectives indeed. Thus it was organ
ized with at least $15,000 of student money, and

the Lobby Office — which was involved ina rather
dubious transfer of funds last quarter — gained the
legitimacy which has eluded it for more than a
year. But beginning with Tom Brokaw's opening
jokes, the conference was a carefully orchestrated
weekend of anti-Reaganism peppered with a
couple of conservatives for "balance."
From the placards outside the Bookstore it was
clear that racist Reagan beats his wife while plot
ting with the Salvadoran fascists to nuke everyone,
everywhere. Strangely enough, there were no sta
tistics on inflation, no mention of the Zero-Option,
no testimonials from joyous people in Grenada
and not a word about O'Connor, Kirkpatrick.
Heckler and Dole.
I went to Saturday's session, "An Urgent Choice
for Central America: The 1984 Elections," which
was sponsored by SCAAN (Stanford Central
American Action Network.) "Choice" implies op
tions, but for two hours the crowd was incited to
dump Reagan. There was no spokesperson there
for the administration.
SCAAN, which applied for $3005 from the Pro
gram Board, is the same group that has organized
protests against the rescue of Grenada and against
CIA recruiting at Stanford. Given the fact that the
latter demonstration was co-sponsored by the
Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) who
openly advocate the spread of socialism in this
country, it is no wonder that the KGB was con
veniently exempt from their criticism. In the rosy
world view of the DSA, the spreading Soviet
empire is not a factor in the geo-political calculus.
The DSA has applied for $X4O from the Program
Board.
Another soulmate on the left is Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC). SAC's contribution to the
conference was a panel on "Draft Registration and
Financial Aid," which featured a draft resister and
an "activist/attorney" on registration. Advocating
legislative change is one thing: encouraging stu

dents to violate the law is quite another. The
ASSU has no business providing a forum for
groups which advocate breaking the law.
At the hub of this network is the Stanford Pro
gressive Alliance (SPA). "Progressive." Everyone
is for progress, and thus, despite being denied a fee
assessment at the polls by the student body at
large, SPA received $1285 from the ASSU last
year. The ASSU has also approved $3700 in
"contingency funds" in case the student body is
not sufficiently enlightened to grant SPA its re
quested $ 17,500 fee assessment.
"Progress." The question, of course, is progress
in what direction? SPA has consistently shared bil
ling with SCAAN, SAC and the DSA — the SPA
newsletter being a case in point — and there is no
regular mechanism to assure that SPA is not
double-funding these groups. A quick glance at the
Student Directory reveals an interlocking direc
torate among these organizations as well. The SAC
contact is the SPA contact, and the former trea
surer of SPA, who now heads the Lobby Office, is
the contact for "The Stanford Association for
Workplace Democracy," which promotes "co
operatives, employee ownership and alternative
forms of management of the workplace," i.e.,
socialism.
On April 17 and 18 election^will be held to de
termine which student groups get ASSU money.
The issue is not the propriety of allowing leftist or
ganizations at Stanford, for SPA and its surrogates
and the Lobby Office have the right to voice their
opinions. The issue is whether the Stanford student
body wants to finance groups openly antagonistic
to the system which makes it possible for all of us
to attend this great University. Whatever the
outcome of the elections, the ASSU should respect
the will of the students and should be prohibited
from retroactively granting funds to groups denied
fee assessments by general referendum.
