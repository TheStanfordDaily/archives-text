Who's your friend?
Two students at Eastern Illinois Univer
sity have proposed a system they believe will
improve security on the campus. The Buddy
Button System is designed for students to
/ wear colored buttons which correspond with
the area in which they live. A student can
approach a person with the same color but
ton and ask them to be an escort. Also, a
number will be printed on each button to
identify its wearer.
After several appeals to Eastern residence
hall councils to monetarily support the sys
tem, several hall councils have refused to
give funding to the program. The buttons
will cost $1300, but only $200 has been col
lected from the residences. Ford Hall Coun
cil members told The Daily Eastern News
that they believe "the program has too many
loopholes and don't agree with its use."
Lawson Hall Council members do not
monetarily support the system because
"surveys issued in the hall showed the resi
dents would not use the program and did not
want their money to go towards it."
However, a few residence halls have

donated money to the Buddy Button Sys
tem. The East Hall Council gave money as a
gesture of support for the program. While
the East Hall President declined to state the
amount that the hall donated, he said, "The
amount of money we gave is not important,
hut the idea that we are going to give the
program a chance is."

The Carmen Hall Council donated $30 to
show support for the system because it
felt it is an attempt to do something about
campus security.

They think he poisons minds
Although Boy George is currently heard
on pop radio stations throughout the country
and can be seen on the cover of any pop
music magazine, his albums have been
banned from the bookstore at Brigham
Young University pending a review.
"It is more an evaluation of the artist than
of his music," said bookstore director Roger
Utley to the Associated Press, adding that
the records would be reviewed for their
suitability for students.
"We're just not sure what is appropriate
to sell on campus," he added.
A spokesman for the Mormon-owned
school said, "The administration has no
standard policy on Boy George. It's a
bookstore matter."
Utley decided to remove the albums be
cause of recent action taken by student pro
gram officials. For instance. Culture Club
was to be used as the theme for the cam
paign of a student Culture Office candidate.
She planned to use posters featuring herself
posed with several people dressed as Culture
Club members.
She said she was told not to use the photo
because the director of student programs felt
that Culture Club promotes homosexuality
and transvestism.
In addition, school officials said a student
band which appeared under the name "The
Club" — featuring "Guy George" as the
lead singer — had been banned from further
performances.
Anxieties? Not me.
While closets in Bloom County hold
everything from old girlfriends to the Ghost
of Slide Rules Past to "Norma the Nuke,"
students at Smith College were recently
asked by The Sophian what they keep
in their anxiety closets. Many of their
answers sound quite familiar.
Some women worried about daily aca
demic activities, such as "econ exams or
Fridays before vacations," or "the fear that
the computer's going to crash before I

my psychology paper done."
A few women were concerned with their
personal future both in terms of employment
and relationships. One woman expressed her
anxieties as "not having financial resources,
being unemployed and not being able to find
a job; being very alone and not having
anyone to turn to."
Another woman expressed a sense of
despair about the future of her personal life.
"I have a vision: I'm 40 years old, I haven't
found Mr. Right yet, and no one likes me.
Everybody hates me! Not only that, all the
people that I thought were my friends have
turned their backs on me."

were also prevalent. One woman held in her
anxiety closet the fear that "Reagan will be
re-elected. Thinking of all the Supreme
Court justices that the next president will be
able to appoint — if it were Reagan, I'd be
Jello." Another woman stated, "At the mo
ment I'm writing an article on nuclear
holocaust, so I think a nuclear holocaust
would be it."
A final common anxiety had to do specifi
cally with women. According to one junior,
there are two things in every woman's anx
iety closet: that a woman can never feel
comfortable walking alone, and that a wo
man can never see herself in the media as
what she really is.
One woman summed up the range of
anxieties that people store away. "It ranges
from blowing up the world tomorrow to
what I'm going to wear tomorrow."

You ought to be in pictures
Playboy photographer David Chan spent
some time at Indiana University in his search
for models for September's "Girls of the Big
Ten" pictorial. During the week, Chan had
been screening IU women from his room at
the Bloomington Ramada Inn.
One sophomore of the hundred or so wo
men Chan photographed told the Indiana
Daily Student that she thought that being se
lected would be a "good step" in her model
ing career. Another sophomore who also
wants modeling experience said she didn't
have any problems with the Playboy image.
"I'm doing it clothed, so there's not much of
an ethical question."
Other women were more hesitant when
they first met Chan, but apparently the 17-
year Playboy veteran was "a master at put
ting his subjects at ease. He said jokingly to
one woman after seeing a provocative
picture, 'Didn't I see you on the street cor
ner?' " (What a sense of humor.)
Chan expected to have a total of 150 ap
plicants from the IU campus. So far, 10 wo
men said they would pose nude, 25 said they
would pose semi-nude and 35 would pose
clothed. Nude models will be paid $300,
semi-nudes will receive $150 and clothed
models will get $75.
That's what's so wonderful about this op
portunity — freedom of choice.
