# Escondido residents battle University over rent increases
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Daily staff 
More than 125 residents of Escondido Vil
lage expressed their anger with University ad
ministrators last night about proposed rent in
creases during a meeting in the Escondido
Center.
A panel of seven representatives from Es
condido Village, a housing project originally
formed for married graduate students and
their spouses, met with six University admi
nistrators, including Dean of Residential Edu
cation Norm Robinson, before the floor was
opened to often heated questions from mem
bers of the audience.
John McManus, a graduate student in com
munications, began the evening by telling
members of the crowd that they were called
there "out of fear that what we have been told
about rent increases might force some of us to
leave Stanford."

McManus claimed a 1 7 percent increase on
a three-bedroom unit has been proposed for
the coming year, adding to a cumulative five
year increase of 78 percent. He continued that
a survey sent out two weeks ago by The Es
condido Rent Fairness Coalition to the more
than 1200 households in the Village revealed
43 percent of the residents spend half their net
incomes on rent.
The survey also revealed that 51 percent of
the residents said they "must borrow to make
ends meet," McManus said.
During an unorganized and often uncon
trolled floor discussion, one woman vehe
mently added that she and her two young
children are forced to subsist on a $50-per
month food budget. "We can't cut it any
closer," she said.
One of the residents' main gripes is that
they are forced to subsidize the cost of the
new Governor's Corner housing for under

graduates.
"Its a question of equity: Should we have
to pay for housing we can't live in? We're the
wrong people to look to to fund such posh
quarters," McManus said, adding that he did
not "begrudge the undergraduates their fine
housing."
Robinson countered by outlining how the
rent structure for the Village is arranged. He
said that the result of a University survey in
1976 included a decision to put more equity
into the graduate housing complex so "more
students would have the opportunity to live
(there)," adding that the cost of housing in the
Village is "considerably lower than off
campus."
He said that a rate equity tax forum was
formed and an "indexed way of looking at
rates" was implemented for an across-the
board "unified housing system."
Addressing the complaints about graduate

funding for undergraduate housing, Robinson
said that it is a "matter of luck for students as
to what housing was built when."
Robinson closed his statement by stressing
that it "is not the University's goal to raise
rent to a market level" in the Village. Several
members of the audience spontaneously stood
up and directed pointed questions at Robin
son before Pam Lagarde, a member of the Es
condido panel, intervened and let other mem
bers of the University panel speak, including
Ed Scoles, director of Housing and Food Ser
vice management, and Karlene Dickey, asso
ciate dean of Graduate Studies and Research.
Dickey explained the logic behind Univer
sity stipends, currently leveled at $5000,
before she was cut short by Lagarde and other
members of the audience who claimed that
the subject of stipends was irrelevant to the
topic of rent increases.
A common complaint among members ol'

the audience and one addressed by Escondido
panelist Tom Lutz was that residents were not
informed of the future "radical increases" in
rent.
Scoles agreed that this was the "major fail
ure" of the University. He said that the 17
percent rent increase mentioned earlier in the
evening is really a 14 percent increase.
Scoles added that part of the hikes in rent
came from a change in plans of a University
decision to finance new housing. He said that
a proposal to borrow $36 million at an interest
rate of 6 percent to he paid back over 30 years
was postponed until 1981, when the Univer
sity decided to borrow the money at a 10 per
cent rate over 25 years.
Bob Hill, another Escondido panelist, said
that what the audience really wanted to know
was "how much is President Kennedy really
going to listen to us." He said that at least 25
