# Escondido residents battle University over rent increases
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Daily staff 
More than 125 residents of Escondido Vil
lage expressed their anger with University ad
ministrators last night about proposed rent in
creases during a meeting in the Escondido
Center.
A panel of seven representatives from Es
condido Village, a housing project originally
formed for married graduate students and
their spouses, met with six University admi
nistrators, including Dean of Residential Edu
cation Norm Robinson, before the floor was
opened to often heated questions from mem
bers of the audience.
John McManus, a graduate student in com
munications, began the evening by telling
members of the crowd that they were called
there "out of fear that what we have been told
about rent increases might force some of us to
leave Stanford."

McManus claimed a 1 7 percent increase on
a three-bedroom unit has been proposed for
the coming year, adding to a cumulative five
year increase of 78 percent. He continued that
a survey sent out two weeks ago by The Es
condido Rent Fairness Coalition to the more
than 1200 households in the Village revealed
43 percent of the residents spend half their net
incomes on rent.
The survey also revealed that 51 percent of
the residents said they "must borrow to make
ends meet," McManus said.
During an unorganized and often uncon
trolled floor discussion, one woman vehe
mently added that she and her two young
children are forced to subsist on a $50-per
month food budget. "We can't cut it any
closer," she said.
One of the residents' main gripes is that
they are forced to subsidize the cost of the
new Governor's Corner housing for under

graduates.
"Its a question of equity: Should we have
to pay for housing we can't live in? We're the
wrong people to look to to fund such posh
quarters," McManus said, adding that he did
not "begrudge the undergraduates their fine
housing."
Robinson countered by outlining how the
rent structure for the Village is arranged. He
said that the result of a University survey in
1976 included a decision to put more equity
into the graduate housing complex so "more
students would have the opportunity to live
(there)," adding that the cost of housing in the
Village is "considerably lower than off
campus."
He said that a rate equity tax forum was
formed and an "indexed way of looking at
rates" was implemented for an across-the
board "unified housing system."
Addressing the complaints about graduate

funding for undergraduate housing, Robinson
said that it is a "matter of luck for students as
to what housing was built when."
Robinson closed his statement by stressing
that it "is not the University's goal to raise
rent to a market level" in the Village. Several
members of the audience spontaneously stood
up and directed pointed questions at Robin
son before Pam Lagarde, a member of the Es
condido panel, intervened and let other mem
bers of the University panel speak, including
Ed Scoles, director of Housing and Food Ser
vice management, and Karlene Dickey, asso
ciate dean of Graduate Studies and Research.
Dickey explained the logic behind Univer
sity stipends, currently leveled at $5000,
before she was cut short by Lagarde and other
members of the audience who claimed that
the subject of stipends was irrelevant to the
topic of rent increases.
A common complaint among members ol'

the audience and one addressed by Escondido
panelist Tom Lutz was that residents were not
informed of the future "radical increases" in
rent.
Scoles agreed that this was the "major fail
ure" of the University. He said that the 17
percent rent increase mentioned earlier in the
evening is really a 14 percent increase.
Scoles added that part of the hikes in rent
came from a change in plans of a University
decision to finance new housing. He said that
a proposal to borrow $36 million at an interest
rate of 6 percent to he paid back over 30 years
was postponed until 1981, when the Univer
sity decided to borrow the money at a 10 per
cent rate over 25 years.
Bob Hill, another Escondido panelist, said
that what the audience really wanted to know
was "how much is President Kennedy really
going to listen to us." He said that at least 25
letters had been sent to Kennedy and
that he and other members in the
room had received a response from
the president.
The text ot Kennedy's letter to Hill,
a portion of which Hill read to the au
dience, said, "The University aims to
remove major relative differences be
tween the prices ot Escondido Village
apartments and market rates for
equivalent units, but it does not intend
to move all rates to market. We do
think, however, that the rent subsidy
has in the past been too large, espe
cially for certain kinds of units."
Hill said that Kennedy is "not
looking at us as human beings, but as a
source of capital investment."
Lutz added that " a lot of us have
been locked in to (University housing
at Escondido) and now a lot of us are
going to be locked out" because of an
inability to pay rent.
Some members of the audience, as
well as McManus, expressed concern
that many of the brightest graduate
students in the country would be
forced in the future to attend other
universities because they cannot af
ford the rent at Escondido. Lagarde
made an impromptu call for a show of
hands of all those in the room who
knew someone who had to attend an
other institution because of an in
ability to meet rent requirements.
About 20 members of the audience

raised their hands.
Near the end of the meeting.
Camille Marder, a graduate student in
sociology, asked Robinson what he
would do it he could not afford to pay
rent.
Robinson responded that it was a
"hypothetical question." but that he
would try to find a higher paying job
and decrease expenditures. He said
that he once faced a similar situation
as a student himself and he cut back
on his course load to get a higher
paying job and spent an extra two or
three years in school.
Robinson said that he would try to
incorporate aspects of the meeting
into University discussion 011 rent in
creases for next year and try to make
contact with members of the Escon
dido Village Rent Fairness Coalition.
Before the meeting. McManus told
The Daily that he considers himself to
be one of the luckier residents ot the
Village because of the income derived
from his wife's job as a registered
nurse.
."Many people are holding on by a
thread," McManus said, adding that
there are some "dire cases" and that
"a number of people live only on their
stipends."
As the meeting adjourned, the audi
ence was asked to sign up for member
ship in the Village coalition. Members
of the Escondido panel said they
would continue to fight tor media
coverage to keep their struggle in the
public eye and begin a mailing cam
paign to alert alumni to their plight.

percent rent increase mentioned earlier in the
evening is really a 14 percent increase.
Scoles added that part of the hikes in rent
came from a change in plans of a University
decision to finance new housing. He said that
a proposal to borrow $36 million at an interest
rate of 6 percent to he paid back over 30 years
was postponed until 1981, when the Univer
sity decided to borrow the money at a 10 per
cent rate over 25 years.
Bob Hill, another Escondido panelist, said
that what the audience really wanted to know
was "how much is President Kennedy really
going to listen to us." He said that at least 25
letters had been sent to Kennedy and
that he and other members in the
room had received a response from
the president.
The text ot Kennedy's letter to Hill,
a portion of which Hill read to the au
dience, said, "The University aims to
remove major relative differences be
tween the prices ot Escondido Village
apartments and market rates for
equivalent units, but it does not intend
to move all rates to market. We do
think, however, that the rent subsidy
has in the past been too large, espe
cially for certain kinds of units."
Hill said that Kennedy is "not
looking at us as human beings, but as a
source of capital investment."
Lutz added that " a lot of us have
been locked in to (University housing
at Escondido) and now a lot of us are
going to be locked out" because of an
inability to pay rent.
Some members of the audience, as
well as McManus, expressed concern
that many of the brightest graduate
students in the country would be
forced in the future to attend other
universities because they cannot af
ford the rent at Escondido. Lagarde
made an impromptu call for a show of
hands of all those in the room who
knew someone who had to attend an
other institution because of an in
ability to meet rent requirements.
About 20 members of the audience

raised their hands.
Near the end of the meeting.
Camille Marder, a graduate student in
sociology, asked Robinson what he
would do it he could not afford to pay
rent.
Robinson responded that it was a
"hypothetical question." but that he
would try to find a higher paying job
and decrease expenditures. He said
that he once faced a similar situation
as a student himself and he cut back
on his course load to get a higher
paying job and spent an extra two or
three years in school.
Robinson said that he would try to
incorporate aspects of the meeting
into University discussion 011 rent in
creases for next year and try to make
contact with members of the Escon
dido Village Rent Fairness Coalition.
Before the meeting. McManus told
The Daily that he considers himself to
be one of the luckier residents ot the
Village because of the income derived
from his wife's job as a registered
nurse.
."Many people are holding on by a
thread," McManus said, adding that
there are some "dire cases" and that
"a number of people live only on their
stipends."
As the meeting adjourned, the audi
ence was asked to sign up for member
ship in the Village coalition. Members
of the Escondido panel said they
would continue to fight tor media
coverage to keep their struggle in the
public eye and begin a mailing cam
paign to alert alumni to their plight.

Ed Scoles, director of Housing and Food Service management, told Es
condido Village residents that part of their rent increase is caused by a
change in plans for financing housing.
More than 125 residents of Escondido Vil
lage expressed their anger with University ad
ministrators last night about proposed rent in
creases during a meeting in the Escondido
Center.
A panel of seven representatives from Es
condido Village, a housing project originally
formed for married graduate students and
their spouses, met with six University admi
nistrators, including Dean of Residential Edu
cation Norm Robinson, before the floor was
opened to often heated questions from mem
bers of the audience.
John McManus, a graduate student in com
munications, began the evening by telling
members of the crowd that they were called
there "out of fear that what we have been told
about rent increases might force some of us to
leave Stanford."

McManus claimed a 1 7 percent increase on
a three-bedroom unit has been proposed for
the coming year, adding to a cumulative five
year increase of 78 percent. He continued that
a survey sent out two weeks ago by The Es
condido Rent Fairness Coalition to the more
than 1200 households in the Village revealed
43 percent of the residents spend half their net
incomes on rent.
The survey also revealed that 51 percent of
the residents said they "must borrow to make
ends meet," McManus said.
During an unorganized and often uncon
trolled floor discussion, one woman vehe
mently added that she and her two young
children are forced to subsist on a $50-per
month food budget. "We can't cut it any
closer," she said.
One of the residents' main gripes is that
they are forced to subsidize the cost of the
new Governor's Corner housing for under

graduates.
"Its a question of equity: Should we have
to pay for housing we can't live in? We're the
wrong people to look to to fund such posh
quarters," McManus said, adding that he did
not "begrudge the undergraduates their fine
housing."
Robinson countered by outlining how the
rent structure for the Village is arranged. He
said that the result of a University survey in
1976 included a decision to put more equity
into the graduate housing complex so "more
students would have the opportunity to live
(there)," adding that the cost of housing in the
Village is "considerably lower than off
campus."
He said that a rate equity tax forum was
formed and an "indexed way of looking at
rates" was implemented for an across-the
board "unified housing system."
Addressing the complaints about graduate

funding for undergraduate housing, Robinson
said that it is a "matter of luck for students as
to what housing was built when."
Robinson closed his statement by stressing
that it "is not the University's goal to raise
rent to a market level" in the Village. Several
members of the audience spontaneously stood
up and directed pointed questions at Robin
son before Pam Lagarde, a member of the Es
condido panel, intervened and let other mem
bers of the University panel speak, including
Ed Scoles, director of Housing and Food Ser
vice management, and Karlene Dickey, asso
ciate dean of Graduate Studies and Research.
Dickey explained the logic behind Univer
sity stipends, currently leveled at $5000,
before she was cut short by Lagarde and other
members of the audience who claimed that
the subject of stipends was irrelevant to the
topic of rent increases.
A common complaint among members ol'

the audience and one addressed by Escondido
panelist Tom Lutz was that residents were not
informed of the future "radical increases" in
rent.
Scoles agreed that this was the "major fail
ure" of the University. He said that the 17
percent rent increase mentioned earlier in the
evening is really a 14 percent increase.
Scoles added that part of the hikes in rent
