## Card rebounds from weekend losses Broncos blunder ballgame 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The Santa Clara Broncos
decided to play the Easter
Bunny a few days early, but in
stead laid an egg, committing
four first-inning errors that
allowed the Stanford baseball
team to take the basket and run
to a 9-3 non-league triumph at
Sunken Diamond yesterday.
The Cardinal welcomed Santa
Clara's generosity after a
frustrating weekend of waiting
for the big hit that never came
against Pacific-10 Conference
leader Arizona State.
On this day, however, Stan
ford tallied four times in the first
and pounded three different
Bronco hurlers for 13 hits. That
was all starting pitcher Steve
Cottrell needed as he sailed to
his fifth win without a loss, scat
tering four hits over six innings
and raising the Card's season
record to 23-18-1. Reliever Al
Osuna replaced Cottrell in the
seventh.
Cottrell was understandably
pleased afterward After suffer
ing through a 1-10 season as a
quarterback on the football
team, Cottrell's early season
baseball progress was slowed by
an ankle injury. Once back, the
senior right-hander has had
little success in Pac-10 games.
He is 0-0 with a 15.42 ERA in
the conference.
"At times I've gone out and
pitched well and then other
times I wish that I could say
someone else has been wearing
my jersey," he said rather
matter-of-lactly. " A game like
today helps a lot because Santa
Clara, potentially, has a very
good team and they don't have
any easy outs."
Maybe. But yesterday Cot
trell made most of the Broncos
look like very easy outs — all
but Dave Bearden that is.
Bearden was Santa Clara's
entire offense, slamming two
home runs and knocking in all
three runs while enjoying a 3 for
4 afternoon at the plate. The
left-hand hitting center fielder
opened the contest by ripping a
2-2 pitch off the scoreboard in
left field to give Santa Clara a
short lived 1-0 advantage.
It was short lived because the
Broncos (17-20) went into their
charity act in the bottom half of
the first, showing the few spec

tators in the park why they have
dropped five straight games.
Stanford's Walt Harris started
the rally with a one-out single
off losing pitcher Sal Vaccaro.
Harris then advanced to second
when third baseman Rich Mar
tig hooted Darryl Stephens'
grounder.
With Rick Lundblade at the
plate, Harris and Stephens
hooked up on a double steal and
got more than they expected
when catcher Mike MacFarlane
uncorked a wild throw into left
field trying to nail Harris at
third. Harris scored on the error
and Stephens followed to make
it 2-1 when Lundblade picked
up the first of his three RBis
with a single.
Lundblade advanced to
second when his hit was
misplayed in the outfield for an
error. After a walk to Mike
Deßenon, the Broncos pulled
the coup de grace, turning Mark
Davis' potential double-play
grounder into another run as
shortstop Todd Gates first
missed second base, and then
overthrew first base, allowing
Lundblade to score.
John Verducci plated the final
score of the inning with a
sacrifice fly.
The early 4-1 lead was a

change for the Cardinal, who
have been forced to play catch
up ball the past two weekends
against Pac-10 opponents USC
and Arizona State. According to
Cottrell, that has been a key
problem for Stanford.
"It's a matter of our pitchers
going out for a good three in
nings and giving our guys a
chance to get on the board.
Then we can play our game."
But the pitchers have been
falling behind too, and that has
been costly, said the ex
quarterback.
"If you're pitching from be
hind and the hitter can sit back
and guess what you're throwing,
they can take advantage of it.
When you are ahead, you have
two or three pitches to make the
big pitch."
Santa Clara's Vaccaro did just
the opposite, giving up all nine
runs on eight hits in three-and
one-third innings. He surren
dered solo runs in the second
and third and was chased after
yielding a two-run double to
Lundblade that made the score
9-1 in the fourth. His record
now stands at 2-3.

rain-out today at Sunken Dia

Hayward at 2:30 p.m.

join in his jubilation until today when it broke a three-game
losing streak, beating Santa Clara, 9-3.


Stanford's John Ramos helped the Cardinal upend its cur
rent losing slide, but the Santa Clara Broncos may have

been even more helpful. The Broncos committed four
first-inning errors as the Card cruised to victory.

tering four hits over six innings
and raising the Card's season
record to 23-18-1. Reliever Al
Osuna replaced Cottrell in the
seventh.
Cottrell was understandably
pleased afterward After suffer
ing through a 1-10 season as a
quarterback on the football
team, Cottrell's early season
baseball progress was slowed by
an ankle injury. Once back, the
senior right-hander has had
little success in Pac-10 games.
He is 0-0 with a 15.42 ERA in
the conference.
"At times I've gone out and
pitched well and then other
times I wish that I could say
someone else has been wearing
my jersey," he said rather
matter-of-lactly. " A game like
today helps a lot because Santa
Clara, potentially, has a very
good team and they don't have
any easy outs."
Maybe. But yesterday Cot
trell made most of the Broncos
look like very easy outs — all
but Dave Bearden that is.
Bearden was Santa Clara's
entire offense, slamming two
home runs and knocking in all
three runs while enjoying a 3 for
4 afternoon at the plate. The
left-hand hitting center fielder
opened the contest by ripping a
2-2 pitch off the scoreboard in
left field to give Santa Clara a
short lived 1-0 advantage.
It was short lived because the
Broncos (17-20) went into their
charity act in the bottom half of
the first, showing the few spec

tators in the park why they have
dropped five straight games.
Stanford's Walt Harris started
the rally with a one-out single
off losing pitcher Sal Vaccaro.
Harris then advanced to second
when third baseman Rich Mar
tig hooted Darryl Stephens'
grounder.
With Rick Lundblade at the
plate, Harris and Stephens
hooked up on a double steal and
got more than they expected
when catcher Mike MacFarlane
uncorked a wild throw into left
field trying to nail Harris at
third. Harris scored on the error
and Stephens followed to make
it 2-1 when Lundblade picked
up the first of his three RBis
with a single.
Lundblade advanced to
second when his hit was
misplayed in the outfield for an
error. After a walk to Mike
Deßenon, the Broncos pulled
the coup de grace, turning Mark
Davis' potential double-play
grounder into another run as
shortstop Todd Gates first
missed second base, and then
overthrew first base, allowing
Lundblade to score.
John Verducci plated the final
score of the inning with a
sacrifice fly.
The early 4-1 lead was a

change for the Cardinal, who
have been forced to play catch
up ball the past two weekends
against Pac-10 opponents USC
and Arizona State. According to
Cottrell, that has been a key
problem for Stanford.
"It's a matter of our pitchers
going out for a good three in
nings and giving our guys a
chance to get on the board.
Then we can play our game."
But the pitchers have been
falling behind too, and that has
been costly, said the ex
quarterback.
"If you're pitching from be
hind and the hitter can sit back
and guess what you're throwing,
they can take advantage of it.
When you are ahead, you have
two or three pitches to make the
big pitch."
Santa Clara's Vaccaro did just
the opposite, giving up all nine
runs on eight hits in three-and
one-third innings. He surren
dered solo runs in the second
and third and was chased after
yielding a two-run double to
Lundblade that made the score
9-1 in the fourth. His record
now stands at 2-3.
Stanford makes up an earlier
rain-out today at Sunken Dia
mond, battling Cal State
Hayward at 2:30 p.m.

Stanford senior Rick Lundblade celebrated after this home
run against Arizona State. But the Cardinal wasn't able to
join in his jubilation until today when it broke a three-game
losing streak, beating Santa Clara, 9-3.


Stanford's John Ramos helped the Cardinal upend its cur
rent losing slide, but the Santa Clara Broncos may have

been even more helpful. The Broncos committed four
first-inning errors as the Card cruised to victory.
