### CAROLYN TARKINGTON 
Two of Stanford's all-around
gymnasts will be competing in
the NCAA Championships to
be held at UCLA this weekend.
This prestigious event will
feature the top 10 collegiate
gymnastics teams from across
the country along with 24 indi
vidually qualifying all -
arounders.
Sophomore Jon Levy and
freshman Randy Besosa both
put in consistently high-quality
performances at the Pacific-10
Championships in late March,
securing a bid to compete in the
U.S. National Championships.

"We were a little disappointed
with a sixth-place team finish in
the Pac-lOs," Head Coach
Sadeo Hamada said, "but I am
extremely pleased with both
Randy and Jon's performances
throughout the season. We have
always sent individuals to the
Nationals in the past, but this is
the first time in Stanford'v&ym:
nastic history that we have two
qualifiers."

Last year the Cardinal
finished the Pac-10 fifth out of
the nine teams, but this year
UC-Berkeley managed to slip
by the Cardinal into fifth posi
tion with only a few tenths of a
point to spare. Hamada felt the
loss of all-around gymnast Gary
Smith and Shaun Hoffmeyer
hurt the overall team perfor
mance. Placing first was No. 1-
ranked UCLA.
In the individual competition,
Levy placed fifth with an all
time career high 56.30 and Be
sosa tied for eighth place with a
55.05. In the individual events,
both Levy and Besosa lead

going into the high bar finals
and finished in second and third
place respectively with scores of
9.70 and 9.65. Levy also placed
third on floor with a 9.70, fifth
on vault with a 9.55 and sixth on
rings with a 9.50.

in the (nationals) in May, which
is part of the Olympic qualifying
process. But we were all a little
surprised that Randy qualified,

Besosa will also have the
chance to qualify to the nation
als from the NCAAs. "I wasn't
expecting to make it my fresh
man year because there are so
many other adjustments to

me prepare for next season."
Levy, having already been a
NCAA competitor once before,
is approaching the meet with a
different attitude."l scored my
career high total at the Pac-lOs
but I feel I have the potential to
score higher at the NCAAs. My
goal is to perform as consis

and establish myself nation

doing just that, as Hamada
predicts a finish for Levy in the
top 10 is highly probable. Levy
is also a contender for the high
bar title and currently leads the
country in this event.
