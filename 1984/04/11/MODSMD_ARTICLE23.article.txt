# Rank drops despite win
## Netwomen beat Aztecs 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis team has to be as
king themselves what they have to do to stay No.
1. The Cardinal merely defeated No. 5-ranked
San Diego State, 8-1, Monday, but fell to No. 2 in
the NCAA poll despite an unblemished 16-0
record.
Both Stanford and Texas' Trinity University —
the new top-ranked team — received six of the 12
first-place votes, but one voter saw fit to rank the
Cardinal at No. 4 and end Stanford's two-and-a
half month possession of the top spot.
Cardinal Head Coach Frank Brennan took the
drop in stride. "We won't find out until NCAAs
who's No. 1. which is fine with us. They can go
ahead and play the Miami's and SMU's. We're
playing the lop competition in the country in the
San Diego's, USC's and UCLA's."
Brennan was more excited about the netters'
outstanding performance in San Diego. "It was
our best effort of the year," he said. "San Diego
State is the Rodney Dangerfield of tennis. No
respect. They're always No. 4 or 5, but nobody
pays attention."
The Card clinched the match in the singles, win
ning five of the six matches, and then proceeded
to sweep the doubles. "I'm glad we won the
doubles," Brennan said. "A lot of times this year
we had been lackadaisical after having clinched
the match, but the girls pulled together and won
all three."

The big win in doubles came at No. 1. where
Patty Fendick and Leigh Anne Eldredge avenged
an earlier loss to the Aztecs' Cynthia McGregor
and Linda Howell, winning handily, 6-2, 6-3. In
their previous meeting at Stanford on March 12
— a match the Card won. 6-3 — the San Diego
State duo had triumphed, 7-5, 6-4. McGregor and
Howell had been the No. 2-ranked doubles' team
in the nation.
In the other doubles matches, Kate Gompert
and Michelle Weiss defeated Cathy Berry and
Carol Neeld. 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, and Linda Gates
teamed with Stephanie Savides to roll past Anne
Moeller and Taiche Kantner, 6-0, 6-2.
In the singles Brennan switched Fendick from
the top slot to No. 2 and moved Gates up to No. 1.
In the teams' last meeting Fendick had lost to
McGregor and Gates had had a tough three-set
win over Howell, but this time Gates easily
disposed of McGregor, 6-1, 6-2, while Fendick
pulled out a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Berry.
At No. 3 Gompert had what Brennan termed
"a tremendously tough match," winning a third
set tie-breaker to win the match, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6. At
No. 4 Eldredge beat Moeller, 7-5, 6-2, while
Weiss survived a first-set scare to down Neeld. 7-
6, 6-0, at No. 6. Savides dropped the only match
of the day, as Dana Bleicher defeated her, 6-2, 4-
6, 6-3, at No. 5.
The Cardinal is now 16-0 overall, 10-0 in the
WCAA. This weekend the netters will host
Arizona Friday and USC Saturday.
