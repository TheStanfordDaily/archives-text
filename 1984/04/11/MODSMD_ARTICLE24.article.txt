The Stanford men's tennis
team didn't waste much time
yesterday as they trounced the
University of Utah. 8-1. at the
Varsity Courts. The Utes. who
have had some impressive vic
tories this season, never really
challenged the Cardinal until
late in the match.
To start the tempo, top-seed
Dan Goldie needed only 45
minutes to polish off Utah's
John Tsumas 6-0. 6-0. Tsumas
did not attempt to pressure
Goldie and as a result. Goldie
was able to domninate the
entire match.
Head Coach Dick Gould,
who was impressed with the
team's singles play, singled out
sophomore Eric Rosenfeld's
match in particular. "Eric
played very well today," Gould
said. "He was patient in setting
up each point. Both he and (his
opponent Christian Schultes)
started out as even players, but
Eric became the better player as
the match progressed."
In the only singles match that

went to the third set. team cap
tain Mark McKeen defeated
Lasse Mannisto 6-2. 1-6. 6-1.
"Mark played a real line match.
He just lapsed in the second
set." Gould said with a grin.
••But I was really pleased with
our singles play today."
Both sophomore John Letts
and freshman Mark Jacobson
had outstanding singles
matches. Letts beat Jim Morson
6-2. 6-4. and Jacobson beat
John-Erik Rustad 6-3. 6-4. Jim
Crabb had to struggle but was
finally able to defeat Paul Lob
ben 6-3. 7-6.
During the doubles matches,
however, the Cardinal let up
slightly and the Utes took ad
vantage of it. Letts and Grabb,
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team,
won the first set 6-1. but could
not break service in the second
set. They eventually lost it 7-6.
In the third set. they were able
to regroup as they broke service
three times and won, 6-1.
