# Card hopes to burn CSUN
## 
### TRASK LEONARD 
Having played such tough competition as USC
and Long Beach State last week, the men's volley
hall team gets somewhat of a breather tonight
when it hosts Cal State Northridge.
Northridge has been the doormat of the com
petitive California Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation (CIVA) conference thus far, in this, its
first year of play. Currently it posts a league
record of 1-15. Still, the Cardinal is not looking
beyond tonight's match.
"Northridge has done pretty well outside the
conference this year, so we're looking for a pretty
intense evening," said Assistant Coach Don
Shaw. "Where we stand in the conference at 12-
13 we can't afford to look beyond anybody."

Stanford meets an outstanding middle blocker
for Northridge in Dave Shatler, who leads the
CIVA in blocks and ranks second in hitting
percentage. Beyond Shaffer, however, Northridge
lacks depth and could be beaten quite easily it the
Cardinal is playing in top form, according to
Shaw.
"We haven't been on top of our game recently,
so we must make up for our past weaknesses, such
as mental lapses, if we are going to win. It will
take a total effort on our part; we'll have to stay in
the match all the way in order to win." Shaw said.
Tonight's game starts at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion. After that contest, the spikers take on
No. 5-ranked San Diego State on Frida> at 4 p.m.
to close out their home season before travelling tn
Hawaii to take on the University of Hawaii.
