# DUs warned about 'aggressive behavior'
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
Row Director Diana Conklin warned yesterday
that the Delta Upsilon (DU) Fraternity may be
kicked off campus if members continue
"harassing" neighboring houses and passersby.
"Unabated, the kind of behavior that has gone
on could very well lead to the loss of recognition

and the loss of housing," Conklin said.
Conklin said incidents included the "harassment
of neighbors, harassing passersby verbally, throw
ing beer bottles off the roof, trashing bicycles and
generally aggressive and hostile behavior to a
couple other houses, mainly Columbae and Sigma
Chi."
Conklin said she will meet with Inter-Fraternity

Council President Steve Pierce this week to discuss
possible actions against the fraternity. The IFC
Judicial Committee may be asked to launch its own
investigation, she said.
"1 would wait to see what the IFC came up
with," she said.
"One way or another, the behavior has to stop.
It just won't be tolerated any longer. It's enough
already," she said.
DU President Luke Cole said, "While we have
had some behavior problems in the past, we feel
that we have cleared things up and we're looking
to a trouble-free future.
"We've instituted internal disciplinary measures
which we hope will mitigate any future problems,"
he said.
Cole said a "small minority" of house members
has been responsible for the incidents.
He also noted that this year "awareness of
fraternities is at its highest and tolerance of frater
nities is at its lowest."
Conklin said the incidents continued even after
Assistant Director of the Row James Cadena met
with house members two weeks ago to discuss the
problem. She said she has not received reports
of destructive incidents at any other fraternities
this year.
Columbae resident Cecilia Mamby said DU
members once yelled obnoxious degrading com
ments at her while she sat on the Columbae bal
cony.
Other residents reported that a Columbae bike
had been "trashed," a pumpkin was thrown
through a window and lemons were thrown at the
house, but the residents could not verify that the
DUs were responsible.
Columbae Resident Assistant Kurt Lucas said
there had been no incidents this quarter, but that
during the end of last quarter "it was really bad."
A Sigma Chi fraternity officer who asked not to
be identified said the DUs had broken a number of
Sigma Chi windows this year. The DUs replaced
the windows and paid the expense in almost all the
cases, he said.
The University regularly issues warnings to
fraternities when administrators hear about dan
gerous or destructive activities.
The /eta Psi fraternity was kicked off campus
two years ago after several years of warnings and
disciplinary action.
