### SAM DELSON Staff writer 
A property tax initiative to support local community colleges won majority
support yesterday, hut fell short of the two-thirds vote necessary to pass.
The initiative, known as Measure A. would have provided 53.6 million per
year in extra funding for the Foothill-De Anza Community College District.
With 155 of 168 precincts reporting, there were 19,530 votes in favor of the
measure (56.9 percent) and 14.803 opposed.
Foothill-De Anza Chancellor Thomas Fryer expressed disappointment over
the measure's failure, but said he was pleased that "a clear majority of the
people supported us."
Before the election. Fryer predicted that if Measure A failed, "the quality ot
our colleges will continue to slowly deteriorate."
But afterward, he took the results in stride.
"It's not the end of the world." he said. "We'll just have to do the best we can
with the resources available to us."
