# De Anza tax vote fails
## 
### SAM DELSON Staff writer 
A property tax initiative to support local community colleges won majority
support yesterday, hut fell short of the two-thirds vote necessary to pass.
The initiative, known as Measure A. would have provided 53.6 million per
year in extra funding for the Foothill-De Anza Community College District.
With 155 of 168 precincts reporting, there were 19,530 votes in favor of the
measure (56.9 percent) and 14.803 opposed.
Foothill-De Anza Chancellor Thomas Fryer expressed disappointment over
the measure's failure, but said he was pleased that "a clear majority of the
people supported us."
Before the election. Fryer predicted that if Measure A failed, "the quality ot
our colleges will continue to slowly deteriorate."
But afterward, he took the results in stride.
"It's not the end of the world." he said. "We'll just have to do the best we can
with the resources available to us."
He said he had no regrets about the
campaign, declaring. "1 wouldn't do a
single thing differently."
The chancellor held out the possi
bility that the district might make an
other attempt to pass a local tax mea
sure in the future, but he said there are
no plans for such an initiative.
The extra $3.6 million would have
come from property tax surcharges
ranging from $15 to $60 for residen
tial property and from $75 to $375 for
commercial lots.
The money would have been used
for building construction and mainte

nance and for purchases of books and
equipment.
Supporters said the extra money
was needed to make up for budget
cuts since Proposition 13 took effect in
1975.
The Foothill-De Anza Taxpayers'
Association spent approximately
$ 125.000 on an intensive campaign in
favor of the measure.
The measure's principal opponents,
the l ibertarian Party of Santa Clara
County and United Taxpayers. Inc..
did not stage an active campaign
against it.
Foothill College is located in Los
Altos Hills and has approximately
16.000 students. 4500 of whom study
fulltime.
De Anza College is in Cupertino and
has 24.000 students.
