# Experts skeptical of Nicaraguan policy
## 
### MICHAEL GOFF Daily staff 
Local experts said yesterday they
doubt the validity of recent U.S.
actions in Nicaragua and question
the way in which the Reagan ad
ministration has responded to the
criticism leveled at those actions.
Senior administration officials
have released over the past few
days information on direct CIA in
volvement with rebel mining of
ports off the coast of Nicaragua,
sparking discussion around Wash
ington, the country and the world.
Monday's appeal by Nicaragua
to the International Court of
Justice asking it to order a stop to
the U.S.-sponsored mining added
fuel to the fire in light of President
Reagan's message to the United
Nations Friday.
In anticipation of the Nicaraguan
appeal, the United States informed
the United Nations that, for the
next two years, it will refuse to ac
cept the jurisdiction of the World
Court on any cases arising from
U.S. actions in Central America.
William Ratliff, a researcher at
the Hoover Institution who was in
El Salvador only weeks ago, said he
is concerned that while he was in
that country he couldn't find
anyone with information about a
large quantity of imported arms.
"My feeling regarding arming
anti-Sandinista rebels is that it is
only justified when there is consi
derable information that the
country is exporting revolutions
across its borders," Ratliff said.
"Cuba and Nicaragua have been
involved (with El Salvador) in the

past but considerably less so now."
However, not having access to all
the information the government
has kept secret makes it hard for
one to make a judgment, Ratliff
said.
Stanford Central America Ac
tion Network treasurer Julie Fou
quet expressed extreme concern at
the recent events in Central
America.
"It's pretty devastating," she
said. "We shouldn't be harassing
Nicaragua in the first place.
Nicaragua is for the Nicaraguans to
decide on," Fouquet said.
The effects the U.S. actions will
have on the Reagan administration
are uncertain, according to Political
Science Prof. Robert North.
"Reagan has been so skillful at
moving away from all of these
things which I think were terrible
errors, such as Lebanon, that I
can't tell what the effect on him will
be," North said. The president
"will incur trouble with Congress
and especially with the allies" as a
result of the recent CIA actions,"
he added.
Law School Prof. John Barton
said he was more disturbed by
Reagan's attitude toward the
World Court than any other aspect
of the situation.
"The part most upsetting is the
rejecting of the jurisdiction," Bar
ton said. "In an effort to gain a
short-term benefit this has hurt the
long-term possibilities for the
court. The U.S. likes institutions

like that only when they expect to
win."
In Congress, both Democrats and
Republicans say they are concerned
that they weren't informed of the na

mre of the U.S. action in Nicaragua.
Their present cautious attitude threat
ens the passage of other aid hills pres
ently pending approval in Congress,
political analysts say. There is much
speculation, however, that congress
men have known the extent of the
covert action but did not show any ac
tive dissent until now, when their con
stituents have learned the facts.
