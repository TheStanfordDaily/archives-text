Astronauts grab satellite
Cape Canaveral. Fla. — Shouting "We got it." Chal
lenger's astronauts plucked the costly Solar Max satellite
from space yesterday and set it in the shuttle's cargo bay for
an overhaul in or hi t that ushers in an era of spacecraft
salvage.
Dramatic as it was. the job won't be complete until two
astronauts venture into the open cargo bay today to repair the
satellite, which was sent into orbit in 1980 to study the sun.
Challenger was 300 miles above the Indian Ocean when
mission specialist Terry Hart extended the shuttle's cargo
crane and caught a pin on the side of the slowly spinning
satellite.
He snagged it on the first try, saving a mission that looked
like a failure only two days earlier when astronaut George
Nelson flew himself over to it but was unable to dock with it.
Hart gingerly locked the satellite into a special cradle.
President Reagan expressed his delight. "Bob I understand
that the satellite you have on board would cost us about $200
million to build at today's prices," he told Commander
Robert Crippen. "If you can't fix it up there would you mind
bringing it back?"
I hat's precisely what the backup plan is.
Nelson and fellow astronaut James van Hoften, known to
their colleagues as "Pinky" and "Ox." will climb into bulky
space suits today and go into the cargo bay to accomplish in
si\ hours w hat they had planned for 12 earlier in the mission.
They will replace a control box that is four feet high and
four feet wide, to restore the satellite's ability to point its sci
entific instruments.
Beirut shelled depite
new buffer zone agreement
Beirut, Lebanon — Only hours after the signing of an
agreement to create a Beirut area buffer zone between
Lebanon's warring factions, barrages of heavy artillery fell on
both sides of the divided Lebanese capital yestersday, sending
residents running for shelter.
The heaviest bombardment came late yesterday afternoon
in mostly Moslem West Beirut, where shells crashed into
high-rise buildings near Hamra Street in the city's busy com
mercial center.
Cease-fires were called for 5:45 p.m. and 6:15 p.m. but
neither took full effect and the sound of artillery fire contin
ued into the evening, rattling windows throughout the city.
The shelling of West Beirut came from the Christian eastern
half of the city after a warning Monday from a militia there
that it was preparing to fire at the western sector.
The Christian Phalangists accused Moslem militiamen in
West Beirut of terrorizing the people of East Beirut and of
repeated cease-fire violations. In a statement, the Christian
militia told the Moslems that "their efforts . . . against the
state and the people . . . will be useless and rejected."
Bail set for spy suspect
Washington — Richard Craig Smith told the FBI he sold
secrets to the Soviet Union only after he believed he had been
detected, and then sought to avoid prosecution by saying he
would pretend to further cooperate with the Soviets, a federal
prosecutor said yesterday.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said that Smith, a
former I V /\rnj\ counterintelligence officer who for
$11,000 allegedly revealed to the KGB. the Soviet intelli
gence serv ice, the names of six Soviet agents who were actu
ally working for the United States, knew of as many as 24
other similar double-agent operations and may have told the
Soviets more than he claimed.
"The government strongly believes that he has not fully
disclosed all the information that he told the Soviets,"
Aronica said during a bond hearing in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria. "If released on bond, he would pose a serious
threat because of the information he has in his head, plus the
fact that he was inclined to give up the six double-agent
operations."
U.S. District Court Judge Albert Bryan said he could not
deny bond altogether but because Smith. 40, of Bellevue,
Wash, has "the ability to seriously endanger the national
defense." ordered him held in lieu of $500,000 bond.
Economic forecast revised
Washington — The Reagan administration yesterday
revised its official short-term economic forecast and budget
estimates to show somewhat faster economic growth and a
$5.9 billion smaller budget deficit for the currcnt fiscal year.
The new budget estimates do not reflect any of the
administration-endorsed congressional efforts to reduce
future budget deficits, which are pointing toward $15 billion
or $20 billion reductions for 1985 and larger amounts in later
years.
The administration's official revisions show fiscal 1984 out
lavs of $850.5 billion, receipts of $672.7 billion and a deficit
of $ 177.8 billion, according to an Office of Management and
Budget statement. The actual deficit in fiscal 1983 was
$195.4 billion.
With real gross national product projected to rise 5 percent
between the fourth quarter of 1983 and the fourth quarter of
this year — rather than the 4.5 percent estimated in February
— tax revenue will be about $3 billion higher than projected
earlier. "Technical re-estimates" add another $1.6 billion,
while a new timetable for transferring to the Treasury about
$2 billion collected in connection witfo overcharges while oil
price controls were in effect will move that revenue into fiscal
1985.
Student aid package rejected
Sacramento — With opposition from college officials and
students, a bill to ban financial aid to public or private college
students who do not register for the draft was killed in an As
sembly committee yesterday.
The measure, A 82570 by Assemblyman Frank Hill,(R-
Whittier), was defeated on a party-line 5-6 vote of the As
sembly Education Committee. Republicans cast all the yes
votes, and Democrats all voted no.
A 1982 federal law requires students to register for the
draft in order to get federal financial aid, including scholar
ships and federal loans.
Hill's bill would have prohibited the state or any public or
private two-year or four-year college in California from pro
viding any state scholarships or loans to students who had not
registered for the draft as required by law.
Stocks advance modestly
New York — The stock market posted a modest advance
yesterday amid investor wariness about the pace of economic
growth and the direction of interest rates.
Defense and brokerage issues were among the gainers,
while utility and retail stocks were mixed.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 1.68
points on Monday, finished up 4.40 points at 1138.30, the
third consecutive advance in the blue-chip measure after six
straight declines.
