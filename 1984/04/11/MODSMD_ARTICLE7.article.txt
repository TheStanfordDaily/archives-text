From The Washington Post
Washington â€” The Senate \oted overwhelmingly
yesterday to condemn U.S. participation in the mining
of Nicaraguan harbors, rejecting a last-minute effort bv
the Reagan administration to defend its position and its
program of aid to rebels against the leftist government
of Nicaragua.
The 84-12 vote, on a non-binding "sense-of-the-
Congress" resolution that can have no direct effect on
the program, was the first time the Republican
controlled Senate has gone on record in opposition to
any aspect of President Reagan's policy in Central
America.
Earlier, a large number of senators from both parties
gave a hostile reception to administration officials who
came to Capitol Hill to explain the policy. And Sen.
Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz). sent a strongly worded let
ter of complaint about the mining to CIA Director

William Casey.
Goldwater. chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee and a stalwart administration backer, said
in the letter that the mining, which has reportedly
damaged eight ships from five nations, is "an act of war.
1 don't know how we are going to explain it."
The Senate vote put that body on record against the
use of U.S. funds to "plan, direct, execute or support
the mining of the territorial waters of Nicaragua." Sen.
Russell Long (D-L.a) was the only Democrat among the
12 dissenters.
Republicans who voted against the administration in
cluded Majority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee.
Minority Whip Ted Stevens of Alaska and Sen. Paul
Laxalt of Nevada, a firm friend of Reagan's.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass), w ho sponsored the
resolution as an amendment to the administration's tax
bill, said afterward that the vote showed "the deep con

rvrn all Americans tool about the osculation in ( entral
America and Nicaragua, and the real possibility of
American boys dying in the jungles ot C entral
America." Although tills is the first expression of such
sentiment by the Senate, he said. " 1 here will be more.
Kennedy sponsored .1 series ot unsuccessful ettorts
last week to eliminate the administration's request for
$21 million to aid the rebels opposing the Nicaraguan
government and to cut its emergency request tor $62
million in military help tor the government ot El Sal
vador.
The appropriations measure carrying both provisions
passed the Senate virtually unscathed, but House
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass) said yesterday that
it will not pass the House before its Easter recess begins
Friday.
