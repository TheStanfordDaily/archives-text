From The Washington Post
Washington â€” The CIA decision to
mine harbors in Nicaragua was approved
by President Reagan on the recommen
dation of White House national security
affairs adviser Robert McFarlane and the
Pentagon, despite "misgivings" ex
pressed by Secretary of State George
Shultz, informed administration officials
said yesterday.
These officials said that the proposal
was presented to Reagan as part of a
"scaled-down" CIA plan of
"harassment" to cripple the economy of
Nicaragua and make it more difficult for
its Sandinista government to aid leftist
rebels in nearby El Salvador.
"As presented to the president, the
whole plan was one of harassment of the

Sandinistas," said one official. "It did not
focus on the mining."
The official declined comment on the
extent of Reagan's involvement in or
knowledge of the mining decision, saying
only that it was "part of a package" that
was discussed with the president.
Other parts of this package included
increasing from 15,000 to 18,000 the
U.S.-financed "contra" guerrillas oppos
ing the Sandinistas and redirecting their
activities to emphasize attacks on power
plants, bridges and other economic tar
gets.
Administration officials gave conflict
ing signals yesterday about whether the
mining of Nicaraguan ports would con
tinue.
One official said the question of whe

ther to continue the mining was "under
review at high levels." A Republican
congressional source, who was highly cri
tical of the administration for jeopardiz
ing Capitol Hill support for additional
aid to El Salvador, said of the mining op
eration, "They have no choice except to
abandon it."
But another official said that the con
tras consider the handmade acoustic
mines, which explode noisily but are
unlikely to sink a ship, to be "highly cost
effective."
"They're a small force facing a large
Nicaraguan army," said this official.
"The mines are like a sign that says,
"Beware of the dog." "
Nonetheless, the prevailing view
within the administration seemed to be

that there at least would be a pause in the
controversial mining operations.
In Rome. Alfonso Robelo, leader of
the Democratic Revolutionary Alliance,
one of the principal anti-Sandinista
groups, said that the mining would he
stopped if the Sandinista government
lifted news censorship.
The mining operation was discussed in
a National Security Planning Group
meeting chaired by Vice President Bush
in February, according to one official.
White House and State Department offi
cials who asked not to be identified said
that Shultz was initially skeptical of it.
apparently because of the possibility of
diplomatic protests like those that have
been made bv France and Great Britain.
