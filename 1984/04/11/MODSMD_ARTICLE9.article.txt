# Mondale takes clear-cut Pennsylvania win
## 
### 
Philadelphia — Pennsylvania
Democrats yesterday put Wal
ter Mondale on the high road
toward the presidential nomina
tion, with a clear-eut victory
over Colorado Sen. Gary Hart
that gave the former vice presi
dent a commanding lead in con
vention delegates and left Hart
pondering how to restart the
engines of his stalled campaign.
Third-place finisher Jesse
Jackson once again rolled up
massive majorities among

blacks and carried
Philadelphia over
Mondale, 37 per
cent to 35 percent,
to strengthen his
claim as the spokes
man for urban
minorities.
With 72 percent

of the vote counted, Mondale
was leading with 529,962 or 45
percent, Hart had 390,866 or 34
percent, and Jackson had
224,969 or 19 percent.
Mondale's margin was
smaller than his victory over
Hart in last week's New York
primary, but Mondale called it
"a very strong win" and said it
would give him "momentum
toward the nomination and I
believe toward election."
More immediately, his
showing seemed likely to give
him as much as three-fourths of
the 1 72 delegates at stake in the
separate delegate contests yes
terday. That would boost
Mondale past the half-way point
toward the 1967 votes needed
to gain the 1984 Democratic
presidential nomination at the
San Francisco convention in
July and more than 500
delegates ahead of Hart.
Mondale had 949 delegates
coming into Pennsylvania, Hart
557 and Jackson 151, according
to United Press International.
An exuberant Jackson con

tended that "We're going to
keep getting that vote, it's going
to expand and grow and grow."
He predicted that he would
make a "strong showing at the
national convention and that
"this time around, African
politics and Caribbean policy
will be on the front burner."
After absorbing his third
straight loss in a major indus
trial state, Hart clearly needs to
retool and refocus his campaign.
Publicly, he took a hopeful view

of his situation last night, saving
that the fact that Mondale "has
yet to get 50 percent in any
state" guarantees "there will
continue to be political and fin
ancial support for me."
With most of the future con
tests in the West and South,
Hart said, "We're heading into
our territory. We are extremly
optimistic about the states that
are ahead." He said the
nomination fight with Mondale
was "a contest between the
future and the past and the
states to come understand this."
He contended that he would
yet win the nomination and the
presidency because he could
"expand the base of the
(Democratic) party to include
independents and those at
tracted to third parties and
moderate Republicans who un
derstand the need to return
Ronald Reagan to private life."
But there were worrisome
signs for Hart in the pattern of
the Pennsylvania vote.
Mondale continued to pile up
wide margins among self

described Democrats and voter'
over age 50. But, in addition
here, as in New York last week,
he came within a few points of
matching Hart among the
younger voters and among self
described independents that
constitute the core of Hart's
strength.
Mondale optimistic
Philadelphia — All week, as
he traveled from the depressed

mill towns in
the hills of
northeastern
Pennsylvania
to the de
pressed steel
towns along
the Monon
gahela River in

the southwest, Mondale wore a
sober face, protesting, against
all evidence, that the state's
Democratic primary might not
go his way.
Last night, as he stepped off a
jet that had flown him to a
Cleveland fund-raiser while the
Pennsylvania voters delivered
their verdict, he wore a grin so
broad it seemed certain to leap
off his face.
It was, his aides said, a new
Mondale, his confidence
renewed at last after the debacle
of New Hampshire by a virtual
sweep of the primaries in major
industrial states so far. Mondale
termed Pennsylvania, where
172 delegates were at stake, a
"big win" and a turning point.
"What happened, 1 think, is
that about two months ago
(after New Hampshire's pri
mary), we started a debate, and
since then I have had more vic
tories than defeats," he said in a
news conference. "I'm encour
aged to believe that what I'm
saying about where I want to
take the country and the differ

ences (between Mondale and
Hart) as the public perceives
them — all of this is helping gain
momentum toward the elec
tion."
Mondale predicted that he
would win the nomination, and
would do as well in Western
states in upcoming primaries as
he has in the industrial
heartland, where his New-Deal
liberalism has meshed well with
areas of high unemployment
and large concentrations of
union members, ethnic and el
derly voters.
Hart optimistic
Denver — A battered Hart
limped home last night, telling
his supporters that better days
are ahead for his campaign in
the second half of the Demo
cratic presidential race.
"So now we are going into the
locker room for a few days to
talk over the second half of this

contest," he told a rally of sup
porters. "We're heading into
our territory, folks. And when
we come back out in a few days
for the second half of this con
test, you're going to see some
long bombs, you're going to
seen some end runs, you're
going to see some flat passes,
some reverses and some real
exciting football."
Hart, tired but unshaken by
his third major defeat in four
weeks, insisted that the Demo
cratic race is now moving into
more favorable territory for
him.
"The second half is a better
half for us. The playing field is
faster. The sun is coming out. It
will be a faster game," he said in
an interview.
Earlier he told an airport
news conference here that he'd
always thought the "industrial
states would be the hardest for
us. ... I'm not as well known in

those areas."
In the news conference and
again at a rally of about 400 of
his supporters, Hart said he had
done surprisingly well in the
first half of the Democratic
nomination fight.
Jackson optimistic
Philadelphia — The Rev.
Jesse Jackson last night declared
that his "rainbow coalition . . .
continues to grow," as returns
from the Pennsylvania Demo
cratic primary showed him win
ning about 20 percent of the
statewide vote and leading here.
Jackson said that his vote in
Philadelphia, combined with a
smattering of votes in union
dominated areas of Pittsburgh,
shows that his campaign is de
veloping momentum outside of
the black community, which
here, as in New York City and

Chicago, voted overwhemingly
for him.
Jackson said that his substan
tial black vote indicates once
again that blacks have become a
"critical factor in national elec
tions," one that will be a
"triggering mechanism for the
progressive coalition in the
Democratic Party."
Jackson apparently won
about 75 percent of the black
vote here — not quite as a high
a proportion as he received in
New York City.
He attributed the lower
percentage to the "substantial
opposition" against him and for
Mondale by Philadelphia Mayor
Wilson Goode and union
leaders.
Earlier in the evening Goode,
arriving at the Bellevue-
Stratford Hotel for a Mondale
victory party, said that Jackson's
showing in Philadelphia was "a
good win for him."

engines of his stalled campaign.
Third-place finisher Jesse
Jackson once again rolled up
massive majorities among

blacks and carried
Philadelphia over
Mondale, 37 per
cent to 35 percent,
to strengthen his
claim as the spokes
man for urban
minorities.
With 72 percent

of the vote counted, Mondale
was leading with 529,962 or 45
percent, Hart had 390,866 or 34
percent, and Jackson had
224,969 or 19 percent.
Mondale's margin was
smaller than his victory over
Hart in last week's New York
primary, but Mondale called it
"a very strong win" and said it
would give him "momentum
toward the nomination and I
believe toward election."
More immediately, his
showing seemed likely to give
him as much as three-fourths of
the 1 72 delegates at stake in the
separate delegate contests yes
terday. That would boost
Mondale past the half-way point
toward the 1967 votes needed
to gain the 1984 Democratic
presidential nomination at the
San Francisco convention in
July and more than 500
delegates ahead of Hart.
Mondale had 949 delegates
coming into Pennsylvania, Hart
557 and Jackson 151, according
to United Press International.
An exuberant Jackson con

tended that "We're going to
keep getting that vote, it's going
to expand and grow and grow."
He predicted that he would
make a "strong showing at the
national convention and that
"this time around, African
politics and Caribbean policy
will be on the front burner."
After absorbing his third
straight loss in a major indus
trial state, Hart clearly needs to
retool and refocus his campaign.
Publicly, he took a hopeful view

of his situation last night, saving
that the fact that Mondale "has
yet to get 50 percent in any
state" guarantees "there will
continue to be political and fin
ancial support for me."
With most of the future con
tests in the West and South,
Hart said, "We're heading into
our territory. We are extremly
optimistic about the states that
are ahead." He said the
nomination fight with Mondale
was "a contest between the
future and the past and the
states to come understand this."
He contended that he would
yet win the nomination and the
presidency because he could
"expand the base of the
(Democratic) party to include
independents and those at
tracted to third parties and
moderate Republicans who un
derstand the need to return
Ronald Reagan to private life."
But there were worrisome
signs for Hart in the pattern of
the Pennsylvania vote.
Mondale continued to pile up
wide margins among self

described Democrats and voter'
over age 50. But, in addition
here, as in New York last week,
he came within a few points of
matching Hart among the
younger voters and among self
described independents that
constitute the core of Hart's
strength.
Mondale optimistic
Philadelphia — All week, as
he traveled from the depressed

mill towns in
the hills of
northeastern
Pennsylvania
to the de
pressed steel
towns along
the Monon
gahela River in

the southwest, Mondale wore a
sober face, protesting, against
all evidence, that the state's
Democratic primary might not
go his way.
Last night, as he stepped off a
jet that had flown him to a
Cleveland fund-raiser while the
Pennsylvania voters delivered
their verdict, he wore a grin so
broad it seemed certain to leap
off his face.
It was, his aides said, a new
Mondale, his confidence
renewed at last after the debacle
of New Hampshire by a virtual
sweep of the primaries in major
industrial states so far. Mondale
termed Pennsylvania, where
172 delegates were at stake, a
"big win" and a turning point.
"What happened, 1 think, is
that about two months ago
(after New Hampshire's pri
mary), we started a debate, and
since then I have had more vic
tories than defeats," he said in a
news conference. "I'm encour
aged to believe that what I'm
saying about where I want to
take the country and the differ

ences (between Mondale and
Hart) as the public perceives
them — all of this is helping gain
momentum toward the elec
tion."
Mondale predicted that he
would win the nomination, and
would do as well in Western
states in upcoming primaries as
he has in the industrial
heartland, where his New-Deal
liberalism has meshed well with
areas of high unemployment
and large concentrations of
union members, ethnic and el
derly voters.
Hart optimistic
Denver — A battered Hart
limped home last night, telling
his supporters that better days
are ahead for his campaign in
the second half of the Demo
cratic presidential race.
"So now we are going into the
locker room for a few days to
talk over the second half of this

contest," he told a rally of sup
porters. "We're heading into
our territory, folks. And when
we come back out in a few days
for the second half of this con
test, you're going to see some
long bombs, you're going to
seen some end runs, you're
going to see some flat passes,
some reverses and some real
exciting football."
Hart, tired but unshaken by
his third major defeat in four
weeks, insisted that the Demo
cratic race is now moving into
more favorable territory for
him.
"The second half is a better
half for us. The playing field is
faster. The sun is coming out. It
will be a faster game," he said in
an interview.
Earlier he told an airport
news conference here that he'd
always thought the "industrial
states would be the hardest for
us. ... I'm not as well known in

those areas."
In the news conference and
again at a rally of about 400 of
his supporters, Hart said he had
done surprisingly well in the
first half of the Democratic
nomination fight.
Jackson optimistic
Philadelphia — The Rev.
Jesse Jackson last night declared
that his "rainbow coalition . . .
continues to grow," as returns
from the Pennsylvania Demo
cratic primary showed him win
ning about 20 percent of the
statewide vote and leading here.
Jackson said that his vote in
Philadelphia, combined with a
smattering of votes in union
dominated areas of Pittsburgh,
shows that his campaign is de
veloping momentum outside of
the black community, which
here, as in New York City and

Chicago, voted overwhemingly
for him.
Jackson said that his substan
tial black vote indicates once
again that blacks have become a
"critical factor in national elec
tions," one that will be a
"triggering mechanism for the
progressive coalition in the
Democratic Party."
Jackson apparently won
about 75 percent of the black
vote here — not quite as a high
a proportion as he received in
New York City.
He attributed the lower
percentage to the "substantial
opposition" against him and for
Mondale by Philadelphia Mayor
Wilson Goode and union
leaders.
Earlier in the evening Goode,
arriving at the Bellevue-
Stratford Hotel for a Mondale
victory party, said that Jackson's
showing in Philadelphia was "a
good win for him."


Philadelphia — Pennsylvania
Democrats yesterday put Wal
ter Mondale on the high road

over Colorado Sen. Gary Hart
that gave the former vice presi
dent a commanding lead in con
vention delegates and left Hart
