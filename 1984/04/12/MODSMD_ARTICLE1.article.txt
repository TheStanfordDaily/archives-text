# Bernstein sought by GPB
## May conduct class 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
Leonard Bernstein may trade in his
conductor's baton for a box of chalk
and a blackboard if current efforts by
the Guest Professorship Bureau (GPB)
to bring the well-known composer to
campus next spring are successful.
Negotiations with both Bernstein and
labor journalist A.H. Raskin look
promising, according to GPB Director
Enrique Lerner.
Discussions with Bernstein are still
in the early stages , but "the word is
that he's interested in teaching here,"
Lerner said.
The GPB is waiting for Bernstein to
submit a syllabus for his proposed
course, which would be offered spring
quarter. Then the course must gain
departmental accreditation and ASSU
Senate approval. Lerner hopes an
agreement with Bernstein will be
finalized by the end of this quarter or
early next fall.
According to Lerner, Raskin's pro
posed course, which would be offered
next fall, has already been accredited
by the Economics Department All
that remains before a formal invitation
may be extended to Raskin is that he
be approved by the senate.
Raskin is "a very distinguished
writer and lecturer," according to Law
School Prof. William Gould, who first
approached Raskin about a year ago
regarding a guest professorship.
Gould said that Raskin was the
leading labor correspondent for The
New York Times for 35 years, as well
as the assistant editor of the editorial
page. According to Lerner. Raskin is
an expert on labor relations and the
evolution of the labor movement in
the 193 ()s,
Although the CIPH expected to <it
tract Alex Haley and Chaim Potok last
year and failed to do so, Lerner said
he foresees no major obstacles in
bringing Raskin and Bernstein to
campus next year. Haley had other
engagements, Lerner said, and Potok
had family problems.
