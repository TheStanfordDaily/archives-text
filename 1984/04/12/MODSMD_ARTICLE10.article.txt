# House approves significant tax hike
## 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — In the first major legislative action
taken in Congress this year to slash enormous federal
deficits, the House gave overwhelming bipartisan ap
proval yesterday to a package of tax increases totaling
$49.2 billion for this year and the next three.
The bill cleared the Democratic-controlled chamber
by a 3 18-97 vote, with 223 Democrats and 95
Republicans supporting it. Under the rule that
governed debate, the wide-ranging measure could not
be amended.

This is a fair bill that closes tax loopholes without
hurting the average family,' House Speaker Thomas
"lip O Neill (D-Mass.) said. Clearly mindful of com
ing congressional and presidential elections, O'Neill
added, "It rejects President Reagan's supply-side eco
nomics . . . and cuts the Reagan deficit."
Despite the deep conflicts usually generated by
election-year politics, the House bill is remarkably
similar to a $48 billion tax measure being debated in
the Republican-run Senate since Monday. The Senate
bill, which can be amended at will, will probably not be

completed until after Congress' spring recess, which
begins tomorrow.
The Reagan administration supports both the House
and Senate measures, largely because they steer clear
of proposals that would threaten what is most dear to
President Reagan: across-the-board income-tax cuts
enacted in 1981 and indexing of tax brackets.
The House tax bill is part of a deficit-reduction
framework adopted last week that calls for raising taxes
and cutting spending by $IN2 billion over the next
three fiscal years, beginning Oct. 1.
