## Stopping out, stress and depression discussed Johnson Forum aids students with troubles 
### LISA PALMER "I'm so lonely 
The tiny cramped message
on the bathroom wall at
Meyer Library cries out for
help. For four Stanford stu
dents, however, that help
may have come too late.
One such student was
Chris Johnson, who took his
own life two years ago by
jumping from the roof of
lerra house. Three others
have committed suicide in
the past four years.
After his death, Johnson's
parents came to Stanford and
began talking to his friends,
trying to find out why a per
son who was described as "a
poet" and one who "loved
life and learning" would, at
the age of 20, commit
suicide.
112 Rom the issues that were
raised, Johnson's parents
became concerned that there
were student problems that
were not, or could not, be
met by the existing Stanford
University structure. To fill
this need, Johnson's parents
raised $18,000 through a
memorial fund in their son's
name and established the
Chris Johnson Forum.
According to their bro
chure, the goal of the Forum
is "to enable Stanford Uni
versity undergraduates to use
their compassion and vision
to search for truth, dispel
confusion, engender hope
and prepare themselves and
their friends for the new era
of history now breaking."
This year the eight core
members of the Forum have
concentrated on six major
topics: meetings for students
stopping out, discussions on
stress and depression, rela
tions at Stanford, a Western
Culture evaluation, a
Stanford-at-Stanford pro
gram and the possibility of a

pre-Stanford frosh informa
tion exchange.
The highly successful stop
out gathering last quarter
was an opportunity for stu
dents who have stopped out
and others who are consider
ing this alternative to share
experiences and viewpoints.
The Western Culture eval
uation was envisioned as "a
way to talk about the educa
tional process at Stanford,"
according to organizer Brig
ham Johnson, Chris' older
brother. Although he admits
that "there were problems
with the way in which it was
presented,"it enabled "a
small group of people to get
together and discuss educa
tion at Stanford, using the
Western Culture program as
something to talk about
because everyone has been
involved in it."
Another activity spon
sored by the Forum was
informal discussions at the
Old Union Clubhouse last
quarter. According to in
itiator Spencer Yeh, the idea
was to "provide an opportu-.
nity for students to discuss
where they are in their lives.
In the regular dormitory and
classroom situations," Yeh
says, "there often isn't an
outlet to have discussions
about things which are
serious to students."

Another idea which mem
bers of the Forum are cur
rently investigating is the
possiblity of a Stanford-at-
S tan ford program. This
structure seeks to "create a
small community within
Stanford devoted to the
study of such values in a
focused and supportive envi
ronment." Organizers say
this could take the form of a
group of participating stu
dents living together in part
of a large dorm or in an inde
pendent house. Students

would participate for one or
two quarters, taking special
house seminars as well as
"approved" courses on
campus.
Johnson, who is currently
in his final quarter at Stan
ford, states that response to
the Forum has been positive.
He says, "Many people who
have heard about it say that
it's great, that it is what Stan
ford needs." But Johnson
also sees a problem in that
"you do have to have contin
uous strong leadership" as

well as "a focus."
According to Yeh, "last
quarter members of the
Forum went in different di
rections and some energy
was lost. This quarter we are
discussing working together
on a large project so that
more energy will be
generated."
Johnson and Yeh both
hope to see a continuation of
the informal meetings.
Johnson envisions them as "a
kind of verbal opinions page,
an opportunity to really go

into issues." But he adds that
he doesn't see "a great inter
est or tolerance for that kind
of discussion at Stanford."
Currently, the Forum is
trying to find its place in the
Stanford community.
Johnson points out that "this
has only been the second
year of the Forum. The
group is evolving and trying
things, seeing what will work
and what will not."
Johnson mentioned that it
has been suggested by Dean
of Student Affairs James
Lyons that the Forum act as
a foundation. inviting
propositions from people or
groups which need money to
sponsor activities. If the
Forum moves in this direc
tion, it "could continue activ
ities such as informal discus
sions on its own while
moving toward a hybrid
form, foundation approach,"
said Johnson.
What would Chris Johnson
say to the activities of the
Forum? According to his
brother, Chris didn't like
"structure. I think he would
roll his eyes." Nevertheless,
Johnson and others\continue
to work in his brother's
name.
