# Opinions
## The 						Stanford Daily The 						Daily recommends: 
### 
The Daily Editorial Board, composed of seven
Daily editors and three at-large members chosen
by the staff, has interviewed sponsors for 17
groups seeking special fees and more than 20
candidates for the position of ASSU senator. The
Board also talked with two COP slates and spon
sors for the two constitutional measures which will
ASSU Guest
Professorship Bureau - No
The GPB provides an excellent service by
recruiting and funding big-name experts in a vari
ety of fields to come here and teach. The program
is so important that we feel it should be funded by
a University faculty budget, and not by a $39,347
student fee assessment. Other universities fund
their guest professors, and Stanford should be
persuaded to do so. The administration can
promote and administer a guest professorship
program more successfully than the GPB.
ASSU Legal
Counseling Office - Yes
The Legal Counseling Office provides legal ad
vice to all students who do not ask for a fee
relund. At least 8 percent of the student body
uses LCO each year. Legal problems of all types
are handled by the LCO, and it also serves as a
referral service for major cases. While we're
bothered by LCO's refusal to serve those who
take back their funds, the group's fixed costs are
higher than most. This important service is worth
the $50,702 fee assessment, and we recommend a
yes vote.
ASSU Lobby Office - Yes
The Lobby Office has sparked some contro
versy during its first two years, but it has now
defined its goals and shown some results, includ
ing this month's voter participation conference.
A university should have a student lobby to ed
ucate and involve students in issues affecting us
directly, such as financial aid. The Lobby Office is
asking for less than it did last year, and it deserves
support and a chance to demonstrate its effective
ness.
ASSU Speakers Bureau -Yes
The Speakers Bureau exists simply to bring
prominent figures in a variety of fields to speak on
campus. Although many other groups also spon
sor speakers, this ASSU arm disassociates itself
from any special interest. This year it sponsored
or co-sponsored Alan Cranston, Seymour Hersh,
Ken Kesey and Ralph Nader despite not receiving
a fee assessment last year due to a technicality.
While the Speakers Bureau's budget seems a bit
inflated, the $44,655 it requests should pave the
way for a good program next year. We recom
mend a yes vote.
The Band - No recommendation
We love the Band, and it makes an invaluable
contribution to the spirit of Stanford. However,
there are concerns about the Band's $59,762 fee
request. The Band has been lazy in seeking other
sources of funding by not soliciting help from
Band alumni. Also, over a third of the assessment
would go toward defraying the cost of the Band's
pre-season trip to Oklahoma. We think the Band
can find other funding sources for such events.
Black Student Union - Yes
The Black Student Union successfully seeks to
represent black student opinion and raise aware
ness of black culture on campus. The group is as
king for $20,300 largely to fund a variety of con
ferences, rallies and speakers, as well as commu
nication items such as a brochure to be mailed to
every black student. BSU also claims to work with
Res Ed and the admissions office to promote
minority causes. The Black Student Union
deserves your vote.
Club Sports - Yes
More than 1700 students currently participate
in one or more of the University's 31 club-level
sports. The controlling organization, Club Sports,
is seeking $41,000 from the students to accom
pany its $30,000 from the Athletic Department
and $10,000 from fund-raising. In addition, many
clubs do their own fund-raising in order to com
pete in national events. Support physical fitness
and healthy competition by voting yes for Club
Sports.
Concert Network - Yes
Various student groups have been proposing,
staging and losing money on campus concerts for
at least the last five years, prompting President
Kennedy's moratorium earlier this year. The
Concert Network has devised an intricate funding
system that looks like it could work. It requires a
$49,000 special one-time fee in order to back
what it promises will be at least seven shows
next year; sponsors claim this fee is needed as a
reserve and that they won't need any more stu
dent funding for five to 10 years. The Concert
Network also offers student business experience
and concert discounts. Vote yes and give campus
concerts a chance.

appear on next week's ballot.
Only senators who interviewed with us were
considered for endorsement. The Daily's recom
mendation for positions of senator and Council of
Presidents will be printed tomorrow. Please vote
Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Daily - Yes
The Stanford Daily covers the news and events
of the Stanford community everyday for its
25,000 readers. We realize the awkwardness of
endorsing our own non-profit organization, but
we want to explain how The Daily needs your sup
port to continue providing that coverage. We gain
most of our revenue from advertisers but are re
questing the $50,000 fee assessment to go toward
our typesetting, production, printing and distribu
tion costs. You pay less than 3 cents a day for the
newspaper. We urge you to vote yes for The
Daily.
KZSU - Yes
The radio station is not allowed to solicit adver
tisers, and therefore needs student support to
continue operations. The "Zoo" has made a
strong effort to publicize its programming and to
diversify, broadcasting a wide variety of music,
lectures, talk shows and campus and community
events. Without this money — it's asking for
$41,000 — KZSLJ could not continue to improve.
We recommend a yes vote.
Rape Education Project - Yes
The Rape Education Project is asking the stu
dents for $14,000 to educate the community
about rape. In addition to funding programs such
as Facing Rape Week, the group seeks $5000 for
the production of a special film which it hopes
will make its widespread dorm presentations
more up-to-date. This worthy organization also
gets $6000 from outside sources, but has demon
strated a need for the special student fee assess
ment.
Stanford Progressive Alliance - Yes
SPA is a coalition of minority, women's and in
ternational student groups dedicated to
"progressive" issues. Through workshops,
speakers and thematic scries, SPA. seeks to orga
nize and direct 10 smaller campus groups, includ
ing the Stanford Central American Action Net
work, Stanford Against Conscription, the Com
mittee for Justice in the Middle East and the Wo
men's Center. SPA's commitment to diversity
deserves your yes vote.
SMARTOR - No
The Tuesday Night Great Directors Film Series
shows artistic and educational films. The films are
hard to find elsewhere and aie well attended, but
it is not fair for student funds to support this film
series and not others. Moreover, many of the
films shown are relevant to classes here and could
be supported by academic departments.
Stanford-in-Government - Yes
SIG does an impressive job of promoting student
involvement in the public sector. SIG provides in
ternship information and arrangements, coordi
nates the Washington, D.C. summer program and
sponsors public forums and speakers here on
campus. SlG's varied activities and services have
reached a large number of students, and we rec
ommend a yes vote.
SACDF- Yes
SACDF has sponsored numerous educational
programs on the issue of nuclear weapons.
SACDF has brought in people with differing
viewpoints and has done a commendable job in
raising awareness of the issue on campus.
SACDFs seminars, films and speakers are well
organized and popular, and they deserve our con
tinued support.
SURE-Yes
Stanford United for Rape Elimination provides
a free escort service to and from Tresidder, the li
braries and the residences at night. The $15,000
fee request would go toward maintenance of its
golf carts and salaries for drivers. SLJRE has dem
onstrated that, while volunteers can work
switchboards and escort on foot and bike, it must
pay drivers in order to attract responsible
workers. The frightening potential for rape al
ways exists, and SLJRE needs your support to
combat this crime.
Women's Center - No
The Stanford's Women's Center seeks $10,800
for programming and to sustain a resource and
referral service. More than 70 percent of this
budget goes toward speakers, films and a dis
proportionately high salary for workers. The most
important contributions of the Women's Center,
however, are nominal in cost. Women's support
groups, maintenance of a library, small discus
sions, informative bulletin boards — these are
what make the Women's Center a valuable and
important facility, and these can operate at little
or no cost to the student body. Relatively low turn
outs at speakers and films don't justify the addi
tional funds.

tion costs. You pay less than 3 cents a day for the
newspaper. We urge you to vote yes for The
Daily.
KZSU - Yes
The radio station is not allowed to solicit adver
tisers, and therefore needs student support to
continue operations. The "Zoo" has made a
strong effort to publicize its programming and to
diversify, broadcasting a wide variety of music,
lectures, talk shows and campus and community
events. Without this money — it's asking for
$41,000 — KZSLJ could not continue to improve.
We recommend a yes vote.
Rape Education Project - Yes
The Rape Education Project is asking the stu
dents for $14,000 to educate the community
about rape. In addition to funding programs such
as Facing Rape Week, the group seeks $5000 for
the production of a special film which it hopes
will make its widespread dorm presentations
more up-to-date. This worthy organization also
gets $6000 from outside sources, but has demon
strated a need for the special student fee assess
ment.
Stanford Progressive Alliance - Yes
SPA is a coalition of minority, women's and in
ternational student groups dedicated to
"progressive" issues. Through workshops,
speakers and thematic scries, SPA. seeks to orga
nize and direct 10 smaller campus groups, includ
ing the Stanford Central American Action Net
work, Stanford Against Conscription, the Com
mittee for Justice in the Middle East and the Wo
men's Center. SPA's commitment to diversity
deserves your yes vote.
SMARTOR - No
The Tuesday Night Great Directors Film Series
shows artistic and educational films. The films are
hard to find elsewhere and aie well attended, but
it is not fair for student funds to support this film
series and not others. Moreover, many of the
films shown are relevant to classes here and could
be supported by academic departments.
Stanford-in-Government - Yes
SIG does an impressive job of promoting student
involvement in the public sector. SIG provides in
ternship information and arrangements, coordi
nates the Washington, D.C. summer program and
sponsors public forums and speakers here on
campus. SlG's varied activities and services have
reached a large number of students, and we rec
ommend a yes vote.
SACDF- Yes
SACDF has sponsored numerous educational
programs on the issue of nuclear weapons.
SACDF has brought in people with differing
viewpoints and has done a commendable job in
raising awareness of the issue on campus.
SACDFs seminars, films and speakers are well
organized and popular, and they deserve our con
tinued support.
SURE-Yes
Stanford United for Rape Elimination provides
a free escort service to and from Tresidder, the li
braries and the residences at night. The $15,000
fee request would go toward maintenance of its
golf carts and salaries for drivers. SLJRE has dem
onstrated that, while volunteers can work
switchboards and escort on foot and bike, it must
pay drivers in order to attract responsible
workers. The frightening potential for rape al
ways exists, and SLJRE needs your support to
combat this crime.
Women's Center - No
The Stanford's Women's Center seeks $10,800
for programming and to sustain a resource and
referral service. More than 70 percent of this
budget goes toward speakers, films and a dis
proportionately high salary for workers. The most
important contributions of the Women's Center,
however, are nominal in cost. Women's support
groups, maintenance of a library, small discus
sions, informative bulletin boards — these are
what make the Women's Center a valuable and
important facility, and these can operate at little
or no cost to the student body. Relatively low turn
outs at speakers and films don't justify the addi
tional funds.
The Daily Editorial Board, composed of seven
Daily editors and three at-large members chosen
by the staff, has interviewed sponsors for 17
groups seeking special fees and more than 20
candidates for the position of ASSU senator. The
Board also talked with two COP slates and spon
sors for the two constitutional measures which will
ASSU Guest
Professorship Bureau - No
The GPB provides an excellent service by
recruiting and funding big-name experts in a vari
ety of fields to come here and teach. The program
is so important that we feel it should be funded by
a University faculty budget, and not by a $39,347
student fee assessment. Other universities fund
their guest professors, and Stanford should be
persuaded to do so. The administration can
promote and administer a guest professorship
program more successfully than the GPB.
ASSU Legal
Counseling Office - Yes
The Legal Counseling Office provides legal ad
vice to all students who do not ask for a fee
relund. At least 8 percent of the student body
uses LCO each year. Legal problems of all types
are handled by the LCO, and it also serves as a
referral service for major cases. While we're
bothered by LCO's refusal to serve those who
take back their funds, the group's fixed costs are
higher than most. This important service is worth
the $50,702 fee assessment, and we recommend a
yes vote.
ASSU Lobby Office - Yes
The Lobby Office has sparked some contro
versy during its first two years, but it has now
defined its goals and shown some results, includ
ing this month's voter participation conference.
A university should have a student lobby to ed
ucate and involve students in issues affecting us
directly, such as financial aid. The Lobby Office is
asking for less than it did last year, and it deserves
support and a chance to demonstrate its effective
ness.
ASSU Speakers Bureau -Yes
The Speakers Bureau exists simply to bring
prominent figures in a variety of fields to speak on
campus. Although many other groups also spon
sor speakers, this ASSU arm disassociates itself
from any special interest. This year it sponsored
or co-sponsored Alan Cranston, Seymour Hersh,
Ken Kesey and Ralph Nader despite not receiving
a fee assessment last year due to a technicality.
While the Speakers Bureau's budget seems a bit
inflated, the $44,655 it requests should pave the
way for a good program next year. We recom
mend a yes vote.
The Band - No recommendation
We love the Band, and it makes an invaluable
contribution to the spirit of Stanford. However,
there are concerns about the Band's $59,762 fee
request. The Band has been lazy in seeking other
sources of funding by not soliciting help from
Band alumni. Also, over a third of the assessment
would go toward defraying the cost of the Band's
pre-season trip to Oklahoma. We think the Band
can find other funding sources for such events.
Black Student Union - Yes
The Black Student Union successfully seeks to
represent black student opinion and raise aware
ness of black culture on campus. The group is as
king for $20,300 largely to fund a variety of con
ferences, rallies and speakers, as well as commu
nication items such as a brochure to be mailed to
every black student. BSU also claims to work with
Res Ed and the admissions office to promote
minority causes. The Black Student Union
deserves your vote.
Club Sports - Yes
More than 1700 students currently participate
in one or more of the University's 31 club-level
sports. The controlling organization, Club Sports,
is seeking $41,000 from the students to accom
pany its $30,000 from the Athletic Department
and $10,000 from fund-raising. In addition, many
clubs do their own fund-raising in order to com
pete in national events. Support physical fitness
and healthy competition by voting yes for Club
Sports.
Concert Network - Yes
Various student groups have been proposing,
staging and losing money on campus concerts for
at least the last five years, prompting President
Kennedy's moratorium earlier this year. The
Concert Network has devised an intricate funding
system that looks like it could work. It requires a
$49,000 special one-time fee in order to back
what it promises will be at least seven shows
next year; sponsors claim this fee is needed as a
reserve and that they won't need any more stu
dent funding for five to 10 years. The Concert
Network also offers student business experience
and concert discounts. Vote yes and give campus
concerts a chance.

The Daily - Yes
The Stanford Daily covers the news and events
of the Stanford community everyday for its
25,000 readers. We realize the awkwardness of
endorsing our own non-profit organization, but
we want to explain how The Daily needs your sup
port to continue providing that coverage. We gain
most of our revenue from advertisers but are re
