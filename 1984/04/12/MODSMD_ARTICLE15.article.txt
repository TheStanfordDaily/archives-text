# The
						excesses of capitalism

### 
The durability and success of the
American political system, like any
system relying on widespread popular
support, are due in part to the
relatively equal distribution of the
country's wealth. A quick comparison
with Mexico, a potentially rich nation
that has enjoyed independence nearly
as long as the United States, brings
home the point.
In 1970, the income ot the richest 5
percent of Mexicans was 39 times

greater than the income of the poorest
10 percent, while in the United States,
the corresponding ratio was only 8.5.
The inequity of income distribution in
Mexico has tended to increase in times
of steady economic growth, which is
not at all encouraging for most
Mexicans.
It is a natural tendency in capitalist
systems for the gap between rich and
poor to widen — those with money to
spare can afford to invest it. Yet it is
equally true that in a democratic sys
tem the majority of citizens must have
a stake in the system if revolution or
dictatorship is to be avoided. One role
of a democratic government, then,
should be to constrain the excesses of
capitalism and insure that the gap does
not become a chasm.
In light of this it is instructive to
look at a study released last week by
the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO), which examines the combined
effects of the Reagan administration's
income tax and domestic social pro
gram cuts. Reagan has always empha
sized that his 25 percent across-the
board tax cut doesn't affect the
progressivity of the system. While one
can argue whether a 25 percent cut in
a $100 bill provides the same amount
of relief as a 25 percent cut in a
$10,000 tax bill, Reagan is correct on
this point. What is distressing is the ac
companying reduction in social pro
grams.

According to the CBO study,
households with annual incomes less
than $10,000 have lost an average of
$390 a year. This isn't surprising since
these arc the people who received the
most money from federal programs,
while the reductions in their income
taxes were insignificant. Also surpris
ingly, those earning the most
benefited the most from administra
tion policies. Households with annual
incomes between $40,000 and

$80,000 gained an average of $2900,
while those taking in more than
$80,000 have come out $8270 ahead.
Although the CBO is non-partisan
and, in the words of The New York
Times, "respected oil Capitol Hill for
its independence and technical ex
pertise," the Reagan administration's
reaction has been either to discount
the significance of the findings or to
cast doubt on their authenticity. Thus,
David Stockman claims that these are
"meaningless statistical calculations"
and that "alleged regressive income

The number of people living under the poverty
line has risen, the relative income of blacks has
declined with respect to whites and the concept
of equal pay for women is barely taking hold.

transfers" are "an absolute red her
ring."
Reagan, in a press conference the
day after the study was released,
simply ignored the CBO's calculations
but showed a deft and sure-footed way
with figures himself. "You know, as
Disraeli once said, there are lies,
blankety-blank lies and statistics.
When you — we have a tax program
that was a 25 percent cut across-the
board. Now that's a 25 percent reduc
tion in the tax burden of everyone. If

you have someone whose tax burden
is $20. that cut means they'll save $5
and they'll still owe $15. But someone
who owes a hundred times as much,
pays a hundred times as much tax,
$2000, gets $500 but still owes
$ 1500." You can't argue with that.
Incidentally, the CBO also eon
eluded that the tax cuts contribute in a
big way to the federal deficit, esti
mated at $150 billion this year. The
government lost about $93.6 billion in
tax revenues, but only cut $23.1 bil
lion from the social programs in ques
tion. Here it would be unfair to blame
just the president, as Congress has
shown little willingness to reduce the
deficit either.
It's disturbing to see policies like
these at a time when differences in
income seem to be increasing an
nually. Much has been said recently on
this subject — the number of people
living under the poverty line has risen,
the relative income of blacks has
declined with respoct to whites and the
concept of equal pay tor women is
barely taking hold.
The disastrous results of great ex
tremes of wealth and poverty, in
resource-rich countries with the
means to develop, are easy to find —
stasis and corruption in Mexico, politi
cal and economic paralysis in Argen
tina and revolution and chaos in Iran.

The United States will not soon fall
into these traps, but they are vivid
reminders. A large majority of
Americans must have an economic in
terest in preserving a democratic sys
tem, otherwise the system is not worth
preserving. This point was seen by the
Levellers of the English Civil War
more than 300 years ago; it still seems
to elude some of our leaders today.
