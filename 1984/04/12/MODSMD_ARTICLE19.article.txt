## Card clouts Hayward; Marquess tallies No. 299 
### BOB ZWEIG 
Mike Dcßenon and Rick l.undhladc cach
smashed carls home runs to lead the Stanford
baseball team to an easy K-3 victory over visiting
Oil State Hayward yesterday.
I he Card barely broke a sweat in disposing ol
its second non-league opponent in two days and
raised its record to 24-IN-1 on the season. The
win also marked the achievement and near
achie\ement ol two \ery different milestones for
two very different Cardinal members.
The achievement was that of freshman pitcher
Rob Wassenaar. who chalked up his first lifetime
win with a brief starting performance. Wassenaar
yielded one run on two hits in his three innings of
work against the Pioneers. Coming on the heels of
five shutout innings of relief versus Pacific-10
leader Arizona State. Wassenaar was pleased to
get his first "big W."
It feels great." he said after the game. "1 had a
couple of nice plays behind me. All you have to do
is throw strikes with those guys behind vou."
Before the Arizona State series, the rookie
right liander had pitched only eleven-and-two
third innings as he waited in the wings behind an
experienced staff. "It's been tough. 1 had to be pa
tient with all these people with talent around. I
just have to keep proving myself," noted Was
senaar.
According to Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess, the freshman's future may change. "If
he pitches well we're gonna use him," quipped the
Cardinal chief. "He looked pretty good today so
we'll keep throwing him out there."

As it happens. Marquess moved one step closer
to a coaching milestone. Yesterday's triumph was
his 299 th in eight years on the I arm. His career
record now stands at 299-165-4.
Win No. 299 evolved rather rapidly. Oil State
Hayward jumped to a 1-0 lead in the top of the
first with hack-to-hack two-out doubles bv Tim
Wallace and Cliff Farina. But Mike Dcßenon got
the run back, and a little more, with a three-run
homer in the bottom halt of the inning.
With two men out in the Stanford first. Darryl
Stephens and Rick l.undhladc laced singles off
Hayward starter Rod Haynes and each runner ad
vanced a base on a double steal. That turned out
to be unnecessary because Dcßenon launched
Haynes' next offering over the second fence in
deep left field to give the Cardinal a 3-1 lead.
The sophomore right fielder's homer, his third
of the campaign and third in the last five games,
made the rest of the game unnecessary too. Stan
lord built an N-l lead with two runs in the third
and a three-run outburst in the fifth that chased
Haynes.
l.undhladc got all of a 2-2 curve ball and sent it
over the fence in left-center field for a two-run
round-tripper in the third inning. The blast was
the first baseman's sixth of the year, the most on
the club.
In the fifth, reserve Toi Cook ripped a double
off the wall in left field to score two runs and
l.undhladc followed with an RBI double. After
that, it was up to relievers Doug Gvvaltney, Gregg
Lomnicky and Rick Diet/, who combined with
Wassenaar to stifle the Pioneers on five hits.


Freshman hurler Rob Wassenaar chalked up his first career
victory against Cal State Hayward at Sunken Diamond yes
terday. Tne victory also brought Cardinal Head Coach Mark

Art Streiber/Daily file
Marquess one step c loser to 300 coaching victories, as yes
terday's win put him at 299.
