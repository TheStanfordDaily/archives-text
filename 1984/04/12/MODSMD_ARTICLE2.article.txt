The Steve Miller Band and People, Projects, Participa
tion (P 1 ), two of the slates vying to be next year's Council
of Presidents (COP), clashed over some key issues in a
debate last night at Branner Hall.
The third group running for the COP, the Hammer and
Coffin slate, provided, in the words of the moderator,
COP member Peter Spivack, "comic relief."
The Steve Miller Band and P l differed in their ap-

proaches to graduate student needs
and policies on the issue of contingency
funding for student groups that have
been rejected by students in the ASSU
elections.
P l member Alice Wells said one of
the slate's primary goals is to form a
task forcc to look into graduate student
needs.

"What we're trying to do is very comprehensive in that
it incorporates both graduate and undergraduate life at
Stanford," Wells said. "Something the other slate has not
addressed in the campaign at all is that of graduate is
sues ... we have to act as their representatives. I think we
can do that by examining graduate residential aspects, as
well as their academic aspects and their social life."

Benay Lazo, a member of the Steve Miller Band,
disagreed with Wells on the necessity of a task force to
study graduate student needs.
"One of the major differences between the slates is just
what they said: the task forces," Lazo said. "They're advo
cating a lot of task forces, which is precisely the kind of
thing we think students want to get away from. There's
been a lot of concern among students I've talked
to . . . they've just had it with the bureaucracy of every
thing."

Lazo also de-emphasized the impor
tance of social activities that gathered
together both graduate and undergrad
uate students.
"They (graduate students) seem to
be pretty preoccupied with their
studies and such things," Lazo said.
Both P' and the Steve Miller Band
emphasized the need for more equi-

table housing for graduate students, however.
More than 125 residents of Escondido Village, a
housing project originally formed for married graduate
students and their spouses, protested Tuesday night pro
posed rent increases in housing there.
