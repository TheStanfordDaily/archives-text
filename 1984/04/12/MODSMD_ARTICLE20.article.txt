# Spikers crush Northridge

### IRASK LEONARD 
Alter losing the first game of
last night's match against Cal
State Northridge, things were
looking painfully familiar for
the Cardinal men's volleyball
team. However, from then on
Stanford broke loose of the
Matadors" grip and coasted to a
3-1 victory.
The win ups the Cardinal's
record to 5-10 in the California
Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation (CIVA). and lowers
Northridge"s mark to 1-16.
The first game saw a run of
unforced errors for Stanford,
who, according to Asst. Coach
Don Shaw, came out overly
wound-up.
"We started the game a little
bit wired, and as a result came
out trying to overpower them,"
said Shaw. "When that happens,
we tend to make a lot of

mistakes which should not ho
made."
The Cardinal jumped out to
an early 5-0 lead in the first
game, only to lose the game 15-
7, giving up 15 of the final 17
points.
At the start of the second
game, Stanford was down 5-1,
but struggled back to win the
game 15-7. According to Shaw,
this was the most crucial point
of the match.
"We could have easily lost the
match had we gone down that
second game." observed Shaw.
"But we got our act together
that game and just cruised on in.
"Without the gutsy play of
Brett Monello all night, such a
comeback might just have been
a lot moYe difficult. He was all
over the cou'rft ifrvnn^- tor all
loose balls. We needed a guy to
take charge tonight, and for

tunately, Brett was on his
game," continued Shaw.
The sophomore outside hitter
had a remarkable 20 kills
against the Matadors, along
with a 49 percent kill
percentage.
The third game saw more
Cardinal domination, as sopho
more Jon Root served to 6-1.
From them on in it was smooth
sailing, as Stanford took the
game 15-5.
The final game of the match
was much of the same, with the
Cardinal on top 15-3.
The victory was badly needed
for the spikers, who had suf
fered two defeats last week to
tough competition.
"We had to win tonight," said
Root. "We had lost the last two
uames due to iriental errors, and
