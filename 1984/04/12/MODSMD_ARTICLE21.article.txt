I he Stanford baseball team will announce
today the signing of letters of intent of two
blue-chip high school seniors. The Daily
learned yesterday.
According to a source close to the club,
right-handed pitchers Jack McDowell and Ugo
Colella, both of Notre Dame High School in
Sherman Oaks, Calif., are "signed, sealed and
delivered" to Stanford and will enroll on the

Farm this fall.
McDowell and Colella are the one-two
punch on the mound for Notre Dame, the top
team in the Los Angeles area this year. Both
apparently committed to Stanford Head Coach
Mark Marquess on a recent recruiting trip to
Southern California. The recruits are obviously
an attempt by Marquess to fill the pitching void
that will occur with the graduation of senior
hurlers Brian Myers. John Radtke, Steve Cot
trell, Doug Gwaltney and Gregg Lomnicky.
