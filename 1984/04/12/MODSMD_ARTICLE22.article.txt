# Pete Rose going for 4000th career hit
## 
### 
Cincinnati (AP) â€” Pete Rose
took four walks yesterday to
first base.
The Montreal left fielder
went 0-for-l with four walks in
the Expos' 9-3 afternoon vic
tory over the Cincinnati Reds to
remain one hit shy of 4000,
His next shot at that mark will
come in Montreal's home
opener tomorrow against the

Philadelphia Phillies.
"I'm going to get another hit
this year. I'm not worried about
that," Rose said. "I'm just
happy we won today's game.
I'm a little disappointed, hut it
was just one of those things that
happen."
Rose has turned his attention
to getting the lone hit that keeps
him from the plateau reached

only by Ty Cobb.
He swung only once, fouling
off a pitch, while drawing walks
in his first three trips to the plate
against starter Bruce Berenyi.
He walked on a 3-2 count and a
pair of 3-1 counts, while the
fans booed Berenyi's wildness.
Rose hit the first pitch back to
reliever Frank Pastore in the
sixth, and drew a walk on a 3-1

count from Pastore in his last at
bat in the eighth.
Fans tossed debris on the field
when Rose was taken out for a
pinch runner, and Pastore was
booed when he was removed.
Cobb set the all-time record
of 4191 hits in 24 major-league
seasons with Detroit and
Philadelphia in the American
League.
