# Get in on the action
## 
### 
Americans are
action-oriented — we
don't just sit back and
wait for things to
happen - we make
them happen. You can
make things happen
in cancer control.
When you include the
American Cancer So
ciety in your will,
when you give securi
ties, when you par
ticipate in a pooled
income fund or make
the Society a bene
ficiary of life insur
ance or an annuity,
you are part of the
action —the action
against cancer.
All of these plans
provide tax advan
tages but there's
more to them than
that. They provide
funds for research,
public education and
patient service and
help improve the
quality of life for
cancer patients.
For further informa
tion, call your local
ACS Unit or write to
the Crusade Depart
ment of the American
Cancer Society, 777
Third Avenue, New
York, N.Y. 10017. Get
in on the action...
