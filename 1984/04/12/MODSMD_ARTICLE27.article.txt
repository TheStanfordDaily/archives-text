## Music and voices strong in Saratoga's 'Fiddler on the Roof' 
### STEVE MORRIS ELAINE WANG 
Little-known entertainment
surrounds the Stanford campus
in the form of community
theater groups. They are usually
in small auditoriums, more per
sonal and easy to get to. One
such organization is the
Saratoga Drama Group, cur
rently staging a fine production
of "Fiddler on the Roof."
Set in Anatevka, a small vil
lage in Eastern Russia, the time
is 1905, on the eve of the Rus
sian Revolution. In marrying off
three of his daughters — or
them marrying themselves off
— Tevye, a poor milkman,
encounters challenges to his
faith and the Jewish traditions.
"Fiddler" is essentially about a
family which must change with
the world, abandoning the old
ways and embracing the new.
On another level, this is a
story about the religious and po
litical upheavals of the time
when Jews were forced to move
from their homes. Their lives, as
Tevye says, are as precarious as
a fiddler on the roof.
The Saratoga Drama Group's
production of "Fiddler" is
anything but shaky. In fact, cer
tain aspects are excellent,
namely the orchestra and musi
cal direction. Music director
Kathleen Barraclough does a
marvelous job of coordinating
the singers onstage with her
crew of talented musicians. The
musical part of this musical is

impressive; all ot the players can
sing with both volume and ex
pression.
The technical aspects such as
stage management and scene
changes are also worked out ef
ficiently. There is good use of
the stage, with simple, well
crafted props and an attractive
rural backdrop. Director Mel
Solomon and choreographer
Debbie Wilson combined these
elements effectively in blocking
the actors and the rousing dance
scenes.
Perhaps due to opening night,
the first scenes were stiff. Actors
rushed their lines as if they were
simply doing line drills, and
punchlines were anticipated.
But by the inn scene with Tevye
and Lazar Wolf, the actors
became more comfortable with
their own characters, as well as
with each other. From there
"Fiddler" progressed with a
sense of flow and camaraderie
between the cast members, par
ticularly during the group dan
cing scenes.
In the leading role of Tevye,
John Lomeli was too harsh. The
character needed more of a
touch of irony, especially in his
monologues directed at God.
The lines were ironic, but his
expressions weren't. Rarely
smiling throughout the play, he
missed conveying Tevye's ap
preciation of the the whimsical
and his ability to laugh at him
self.
But the well-paced lines were

delivered clearly, and Lomeli
did achieve a rapport with the
audience and his colleagues. His
singing was another strong point
of his performance, and he han
dled Tevye's helplessness —
against changes he could not
control — with great sensitivity.
As his domineering wife
Golde, Katie Hassett displayed
the same harshness as Lomeli,
but softened her performance
later in the musical. She gave a
touching rendition of "Do You
Love Me" with Tevye in the
second act.
Tevye's three eldest
daughters, Tzeitel (Monica Wil
liams), Model (Rebecca White)
and Chava (Barbara Cowie)
were portrayed commendably,
especially White's Model. White
has a lovely singing voice, and as
Model, her relationship with
Pcrchik (Derek Evan) was one
of the highlights of this show.
As an idealistic revolutionary,
Evan played Pcrchik with just
the right amount of flippancy
and affection. Robert Sedgwick,
portraying Motel — the im
poverished, timid tailor who
wins Tzeitel's hand — also
succeeded in endearing himself
to the audience. His "Miracles
of Miracles" was performed
with refreshing exuberance and
the appropriate giddiness re
quired by his character.
One of the most well-rounded
performances was delivered by

Anatole Lubovich, in the role of
Lazar Wolf, the butcher.
Lubovich has definite stage
presence and he fits his part, al
ternating wide-eyed expectation
with feisty indignation when
Tevye first promises Tzeitel,
then retracts the agreement.
While individual scenes were
generally well-directed, the
dream scene in Tevye's
bedroom was particularly
noteworthy. In this scene,
Grandma Tzeitel — delightfully
played by Nina Weber —
returns from the grave to insist
upon the match between Tzeitel
and Motel.
Rising from behind
tombstones, the chorus added
an innovative touch with mimed
movements. In the darkness of
the stage, with only incidental
lighting, their dark costumes
with stark white hoods and
gloves were especially stunning.
On the whole. Saratoga
Drama Group's production of
"Fiddler" is certainly worth the
30-minute drive down the
Peninsula. It's an enjoyable
show with a group of enjoyable
people who do theater outside
of their careers because they
love it. And after they loosen up
on stage a bit, they do it well.
"Fiddler on the Roof' plays
over the next three Fridays and
Saturdays at the Saratoga Civic-
Theater.
