# Murphy's Lawyers keeps an air of fun
## 
### MICHAEL DIMARTINO 
After just experiencing a run of great shows (i.e.
Genesis, Pretenders) I was questionably enthused
about going to the Keystone for a show featuring
three locals. The Keystone is not one of my
favorites. I don't like Bud or Michelob and get
nauseated when I pay $1.50 per glass. The chairs
totter and are too few. The bouncers are impolite
and some qualify as jerks. However, the crowds are
pretty good and the acoustics adequate for most
bands. Besides that, where else in Palo Alto can you
dance to live music?
As always, I was prepared for a late night. Often
the lead, ahem, last band doesn't make it onto stage
until after 11:30. II you arrive late, forget seating
and expect hassles from the jerks. If you arrive
early, expect mediocrity. You don't get disappointed
that way.
I showed.up for thej.-ndl of the Â£hakes. 1 was
pressed. The drummer and guitar player were fine
musicians and the R & R was raw fun. The lead riff
reminded me of Pete Townshend. Of course, 1 only
saw three tunes, so excuse me, Pete.

Tao Chemical was up next and they proved to be
as weak as their album. I'm not big on the Santa
Cruz sound to start with and these guys (and one
gal) did little to dispel the idea that they should have
stayed under the boardwalk. The off-tempo, chic
new wave sound was hampered by their limitations
on talent.
Murphy's Lawyers appeared on stage around 1 1
p.m. and the dancing crowd from the Shakes perfor
mance returned en masse to welcome back the
group. The band played a fast-paced show taking
time only twice to chat with the audience. They tried
to catch their breath one time also. David Schneider
and Cremin, bass and lead guitarists respectively,
kept an air of fun in the show, crashing into the lead
vocalist, Hans Hansen, or contorting at the front of
the stage. Hansen uses lots of facial expressions but
occasionally swallows a word or two. The band
really concentrates on the music more than the act
ing although some lights added effect.
Malcolm Bertoni kept the rhythm on the drums,
although the bass drum wasn't overpowering. Steve
Flash, the newly added keyboard player, was under

emphasized hut sounds real good.
The song repertoire was decent although certain
songs were out of order for the show. Some transi
tions were a hit strained. "Crushed Crush" was the
clear winner from a performance standpoint. I was
disappointed with Second Coming" only because
its my favorite song on the album and lost some
character live. "Ex Post Facto" and "Synthesized
Time were done better than the recordings. The
group played some new material, most notable of
which was "Money in My Shoe," a fun rock-and-roll
tune.
Live, Murphy's Lawyers has a less synthesized
sound than on the disc. A pleasant addition to the
show was an old Murphy classic "Dream About
Me. I hadn't heard that one since the days of
the Tubes "Talk to' Ya Later."
1 left the club with a smile on my face so 1 guess
the evening was My tricnd, who had never
seen Murphy's Lawyers before, mentioned that aII
the music had the same basic beat. It's sort of like
saying McGovern and Askew had the same plat
form. When you're dancing wildly, who cares?
