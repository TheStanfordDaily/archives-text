Birdwatchers have taken an
interest in this clan of Stanford
owls. According to Betty
Groce, who is here doing a
"nest record study for
Cornell/' the mother and
father owl (mom is the larger
one) take turns guarding the
nest from across the street. In
between shifts, the father owl
flies off to hunt. These owlets
were probably hatched in early
March.
