# 'Tarzan' swings bombastically on thin, offensive argument
## 
### STEVEL VINEBLRG 
You get a lot for your five
buck admission to Greystoke:
The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of
the Apes — a title as long as
three ordinary movie titles
strung together, a score stuffed
with Elgar and other stately,
distinguished contributions, and
a two-hour-and-1 5-minute
course in evolution and the in
ability of so-called civilized man
to surmount his innate savagery.
Hugh Hudson, the director,
must have worn a three-piece
suit to the set every day; the
jungle sequences may have been
shot in Cameroon, but they
have the atmosphere of a highly
respected British academy for
boys — or a pulpit, because ac
tually Hudson isn't a filmmaker
at all, he's a preacher. In his last
extravaganza, the Academy
Award-winning Chariots of
Fire, he taught us that athletic
championship is the natural
realm of the deeply religious
and those who take pride in
their ethnic identity; it seemed
impossible, in the movie's point
of view, that anyone could win a
race just by believing in
running. (Clod was the movie's
unbilled co-star.) In Greystoke,
John Clayton (Christopher
Lambert), son of an earl but
raised by apes in the African
wilds, is led into polite English
society, only to learn that he is
surrounded by hypocrites —
men who disclaim their instincts
but behave barbarically — and
that he can only live happily in
the jungle, where his healthy
sensuality (pure id) is accepted.
In other words, if you came to
this picture expecting a good
time, forget it. There will be no
levity in this class.
The plot is constructed like a
series of little lessons, each
making the same essential point.
Clayton (no one in the film ever
uses the name "Tarzan"),
whose parents were
shipwrecked on the African
coast and then died — his father
at the hands of an ape — while
he was still a baby, lives happily
by the grace of a female ape that
has lost her own baby, though
his peaceful existence is con
tinually threatened by native
tribesme n or by the bully that
his father. One day, rum
maging through the abandoned
cottage his father built, he cuts
himself n i
covered; he barely notices the
pain in his joy over finding such

a powerful weapon. By the time
he has grown to manhood, he is
a mere step away from a kind of
benevolent despotism over the
apes — which he gains by
defeating the bullv.
Meanwhile, a party of British
hunters, seeking specimens for
the new British Museum, arrives
on safari, led by a Belgian guide,
Philippe D'Arnot (lan Holm),
and we see the pleasure one ot
these gentlemen (Nigel Daven
port) takes in killing animals
and posing for photographs
before the propped-up corpses.
When the tribesmen attack the
safari party, only D'Arnot
survives; Clayton nurses him
back to health and he, in turn,
teaches Clayton English and
French.
After he has fully recovered,
D'Arnot restores the young
man to the grandfather he's
never seen (Ralph Richardson),
to claim his birthright as the
Seventh Earl of Greystoke.
Back in England he wins the
love of the old earl's ward, Jane
Porter (Andie McDowell), over
the rival efforts of stuffy Lord
Esker (James Fox), whose true
brutality emerges when he is
disappointed in his suit. (He
canes a hapless servant, and
when Clayton defends the boy
by dropping a rock on Esker's

brand-new motor car, Esker
tells him he's got a lot to learn
— about civilized behavior,
presumably.) When his
grandfather dies, Clayton feels
lost, rootless, but D'Arnot —
now his trusted friend and ad
viser — persuades him to take
up the Greystoke legacy.
However, attending the opening
of a new wing at the British
Museum, he comes upon caged
animals in a side room and
recognizes his simian adoptive
father; he resorts to his jungle
self and releases the animal. (At
the end of The Hairy Ape,
Eugene O'Neill had his hero
crushed to death by a gorilla in a
cage; for Hudson, this is the set
ting for a family reunion.)
Greystoke began life as a
screenplay by Robert Towne,
very loosely based on the source
of all Tarzan pictures, Edgar
Rice Burroughs' 1912 ad
venture novel. 1 haven't read
Towne's script, which Hudson
in interviews has pronounced
"brilliant but only half
finished," but I do know that it
was set almost entirely in the
jungle and that Towne didn't
consider it incomplete — in fact,
he was so disgusted with the way
the project was taken away from
him that he insisted on a pseu
donym for the co-writing credit
he received with Michael Aus

tin. (P.H. Vazak, the nom de
plume Towne goes under here,
is actually his dog's name.)
Based on the evidence of
Towne's other scripts (The Last
Detail, Chinatown, Shampoo,
Personal Best), I think it
unlikely that his treatment was
pedantic enough for Hudson —
especially if so little of it
transpired in England, where
Hudson rams his thin little argu
ment home. It might have been
genuinely funny and exciting,
and perhaps you could have told
the apes apart in it, as you can't
in the finished version, despite
the amazing makeup
(supervised by Rick Baker) and
costumes (John Mills), because
the narrative is rushed and con
fusing. But we'll never know
what Towne intended, of
course; we're stuck with the
Hudson pomp and bombast.
I'm not sure which element of
Greystoke offended me more —
the pedantry or the sentimen
tality. Hudson obviously
believes that his sacred vocation
as minister-filmmaker entitles
him to show us a great deal of
fairly graphic violence, as well
as other "realistic" touches, like
a close-up of Clayton feeding
D'Arnot live maggots to cure
him. And he often embellishes
his fable with the most pitiful
excesses of Gothic romance:

the death of Clayton's ape mo
ther practically defines one of
the conventions of bad 19th
century fiction, simply substitut
ing a maternal monkey for a wo
man, and the love scene be
tween Clayton and Jane would
fit snugly into any Harlequin
novel. These sequences are so
extreme that they may appear to
be deliberate travesties, but
Hudson is in deadly earnest —
he believes in this trash. Poor
Christopher Lambert, saddled
with the double burden of
playing this breathless hokum
and enlightening us, can't give
more than a competent perfor
mance. He may be very good —
he's certainly physically right for
Clayton, and his vocal skills
make Clayton's gift for mimicry
entirely plausible — but this is
no part for an actor.
John Alcott has shot some
lovely exteriors (will landscapes
be Hugh Hudson's trademark, I
wonder? Chariots of Fire was
littered with them) but Hudson
stages the action that fills them
clumsily — he's hopeless with
crowds (of human beings or of
apes). You expend too much
energy trying to figure out the
story, because you're not prop
erly introduced to half the char
acters and the oddest scenes are
omitted. We never see Clayton
bid his jungle subjects farewell,
so we're surprised when he
returns to them so joyfully —
we didn't know he cared. And
when the movie is over, you're
still struggling to identify the
retarded boy who appeared sud
denly in one of the early
Clayton-Jane scenes; he seems
to exist so that Esker can beat
him and thus demonstrate his
barbarianism.

Hudson's idea of drama is a
tableau: There's no shipwreck
— after a preposterly overpop
ulated scene in which the
domestics gather to take their
leave of Clayton's parents, he
cuts to a shot of the beached
bodies of sailors. Watching this
movie is an exercise in self
denial, or it would be if Ralph
Richardson weren't in it. As
Clayton's fond old granddad,
whose affection for his new
found heir spills over the

boundaries of decorum. Rich
ardson vivifies every scene he's
in. His death scene, of course,
touches us in a special way he
couldn't have guessed it would,
but it's difficult to mourn an ac
tor who, after his death, can still
provide the only signs of life in .1
huge carcass of a movie. Hud
son had the sensitivity to dedi
cate (ireystoke to Richardson,
but he transcends the tribute,
while the film remains its own
gravestone.
