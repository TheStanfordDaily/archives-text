The Senate needs to watch over its own finances,
boards, bureaus, and services with vigilance. As
Senator next year, I would like to help coordinate
the activities of ASSU organizations and the work of
the Senate. We can write better By-laws for these or
ganizations with a clearer working understanding of
their functions, which means asking questions, get
ting involved and attending meetings. Often Senate
candidates speak of the timeworn need to "improve
communications with students," and this is impor
tant. Yet considering Senators often know little of
what is going on within the ASSU, better coordina
tion needs to begin at home.
♦ Jay A. Alter
Major: Undeclared
Above all an ASSU Senator is responsible to his
constituency. Beyond appointing committee mem
bers and allocating student money, an ASSU Senator
endeavors to improve the quality of life at Stanford.
As a senator I will work to involve students in the
control of important student services, such as The
Stanford Bookstore, Food Service, and the libraries.
Moreover, I hope to institute several changes from
which the student body will benefit: longer library
hours, more lights on campus, and magnetic identi
fication cards.
♦ Ed Anderson
Major: Undeclared
The scope of an individual ASSU Senator's duties
are ultimately determined by forces outside his con
trol, with one important exception. A senator's ul
timate duty is to his constituents, which is
determined by the individual and is the purpose of
this election. Personally I'd like to see the ASSU
bank account system reformed because it isn't
working as well as see the establishment of a word
processing service. But most of all I'd work for what
YOU, the voter, wants. The real difference between
senators is attitude. It may sound corny, but I
believe when you are elected to serve the student
body, that's what you should do.

Every election year, the student body hears the
same campaign themes. And every election year, the
student body resounds: "BULLSHIT! The Senate is a
bureaucratic monstrosity populated by un
responsive and irresponsible 'representatives.' " To
a large degree, they're right.

Given the structure of the Senate, Senators are
limited in scope and influence. Regardless, the Sen
ate should serve as both a vehicle for student needs
and a voice for their consciousness. As a Senator, I
would focus on students and issues, not bylaws. The
ASSU, the administration, faculty, and campus or
ganizations should coalesce over the pertinent is
sues of our education, finances, housing, services
and facilities, and cultural enrichment. And the Sen
ate should provide the primary forum for debate,
communication, and action. With your help and
support, I feel that we could begin the process of
positive change.
♦ Sheila Castilla
Major: International Relations
The duties of an ASSU Senator are to understand
the needs of the Stanford student body and to pro
pose and find methods of effectively meeting these
needs by either making amendments in already
existing institutions, or implementing new ones.
The Meyer Undergraduate Library does not provide
a conducive study atmosphere. The chairs are un
comfortable, the decor is ugly, and there are bats. I
would like to address this problem in order to attain
money for an overhaul of Meyer Library.

The ASSU Senate has taken great strides towards
improved communications with the student body
by means of the "ASSU News" and the dorm dis
tricting system. I believe my main responsibility as
Senator would be to further increase community
awareness of Senate actions. To encourage greater
community participation in Senate actions, I would
begin with the following projects:
1) publicizing upcoming Senate meetings and
describing the issues to be voted on;
2) printing the voting records of all Senators in the
"ASSU News".
♦ Yvonne E. Campos
Major: Political Science
Offices Held: Council of Presidents intern, Fall '82.
It's time to break out of the mold. . .
BUDGET-FEES-BUDGET-FEES comprise a lot of
what the ASSU is about. As a senator, I'm about
focusing on the implementation of services vital to
the student community.
Keep the Coffee House as an ASSU service, not
Tresidder management.
Re-introduce the San Francisco shuttle-bus service.
For minimal fees this can be viable financially and
facilitate getting off campus.
Represent Governor's Corner and Fraternities. There
are currently no senate districts assigned to repre
sent these areas.
Communication with the student body is a pri
mary responsibility! I am committed to serving
YOU.

gram Board (1983-present)
The scope of an ASSU senator's duties is limited
by the interests of her constituency. Because she
assumes a representative role in government, she
must pinpoint the concerns of the students and see
that they are addressed in the Senate. Only through
diligent promotion of increased community be
tween the Senate and the student body can a
senator be most effective.
There are many issues of importance to grapple
with, but I would like to concentrate on the follow
ing areas: 1) development of a program to offset the
spiraling costs of tuition; 2) the lack of minority in
volvement in ASSU organizations; 3) the inadequacy
of food service with its high costs and low quality
meals; 4) the absence of regular Senate/residence
interaction. Howeer, my primary interest focuses on
the maintained interplay between a senator and her
constituents. I would suggest a revitalization about
what the Senate is doing.
♦ Bart Foster
Major: Undeclared
Offices Held: Senate Associate, 1 year; Larkin dorm
President, 2 qtrs.
It is time for a new agenda in the ASSU Senate. In
the past the Senate has wasted large amounts of
time debating useless bylaw changes and tech
nicalities, while neglecting the ideas that could serve
the students directly. As a Senator, I will work to im
prove the services already offered by the ASSU, and
also to provide new services. Among other goals, I
plan to resurrect the concept of a shuttle to San
Francisco for Stanford students that was defeated by
this year's Senate; I plan to work towards machine
readable I.D.'s that would simplify library checkout
and food service; and, most importantly, I will be
receptive to new ideas and concerns. I offer a new
view and a new overall emphasis, not just bureau
cracy.
♦ Gustavo 'Gus' Gomez
Major: Political Science/Economics
Offices Held: Treasurer, Stanford Economics Associ
ation, '83-'B4; Treasurer, Latino Business Society,
'83-'B4
As an ASSU senator, I intend to focus my attention
on the important issues. I staunchly believe in
greater communication among the various sectors
of the Stanford community. Dialogue between stu
dents and trustees, students and senate could be im
proved. I will also support the continuing study of
the ASSU Task Force on Food Service, with the goal
of providing better food at lower prices. Further
more, I would pledge my support to the SF/Stanford
shuttle which I feel would greatly facilitate access to
cultural events. Finally, I would promote the rees
tablishment of a concert network to expand contem
porary entertainment on campus.
