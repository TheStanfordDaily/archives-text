The Senate needs to watch over its own finances,
boards, bureaus, and services with vigilance. As
Senator next year, I would like to help coordinate
the activities of ASSU organizations and the work of
the Senate. We can write better By-laws for these or
ganizations with a clearer working understanding of
their functions, which means asking questions, get
ting involved and attending meetings. Often Senate
candidates speak of the timeworn need to "improve
communications with students," and this is impor
tant. Yet considering Senators often know little of
what is going on within the ASSU, better coordina
tion needs to begin at home.

Above all an ASSU Senator is responsible to his
constituency. Beyond appointing committee mem
bers and allocating student money, an ASSU Senator
endeavors to improve the quality of life at Stanford.
As a senator I will work to involve students in the
control of important student services, such as The
Stanford Bookstore, Food Service, and the libraries.
Moreover, I hope to institute several changes from
which the student body will benefit: longer library
hours, more lights on campus, and magnetic identi
fication cards.

Major: Undeclared
The scope of an individual ASSU Senator's duties
are ultimately determined by forces outside his con
trol, with one important exception. A senator's ul
timate duty is to his constituents, which is
determined by the individual and is the purpose of
this election. Personally I'd like to see the ASSU
bank account system reformed because it isn't
working as well as see the establishment of a word
processing service. But most of all I'd work for what
YOU, the voter, wants. The real difference between
senators is attitude. It may sound corny, but I
believe when you are elected to serve the student
body, that's what you should do.

Every election year, the student body hears the
same campaign themes. And every election year, the
student body resounds: "BULLSHIT! The Senate is a
bureaucratic monstrosity populated by un
responsive and irresponsible 'representatives.' " To
a large degree, they're right.

Given the structure of the Senate, Senators are
limited in scope and influence. Regardless, the Sen
ate should serve as both a vehicle for student needs
and a voice for their consciousness. As a Senator, I
would focus on students and issues, not bylaws. The
ASSU, the administration, faculty, and campus or
ganizations should coalesce over the pertinent is
sues of our education, finances, housing, services
and facilities, and cultural enrichment. And the Sen
ate should provide the primary forum for debate,
communication, and action. With your help and
support, I feel that we could begin the process of
positive change.
♦ Sheila Castilla
Major: International Relations
The duties of an ASSU Senator are to understand
the needs of the Stanford student body and to pro
pose and find methods of effectively meeting these
needs by either making amendments in already
existing institutions, or implementing new ones.
The Meyer Undergraduate Library does not provide
a conducive study atmosphere. The chairs are un
comfortable, the decor is ugly, and there are bats. I
would like to address this problem in order to attain
money for an overhaul of Meyer Library.

The ASSU Senate has taken great strides towards
improved communications with the student body
by means of the "ASSU News" and the dorm dis
tricting system. I believe my main responsibility as
Senator would be to further increase community
awareness of Senate actions. To encourage greater
community participation in Senate actions, I would
begin with the following projects:
1) publicizing upcoming Senate meetings and
describing the issues to be voted on;
2) printing the voting records of all Senators in the
"ASSU News".

It's time to break out of the mold. . .
BUDGET-FEES-BUDGET-FEES comprise a lot of
what the ASSU is about. As a senator, I'm about
focusing on the implementation of services vital to
the student community.
Keep the Coffee House as an ASSU service, not
Tresidder management.
Re-introduce the San Francisco shuttle-bus service.
For minimal fees this can be viable financially and
facilitate getting off campus.
Represent Governor's Corner and Fraternities. There
are currently no senate districts assigned to repre
sent these areas.
Communication with the student body is a pri
mary responsibility! I am committed to serving
YOU.

The scope of an ASSU senator's duties is limited
by the interests of her constituency. Because she
assumes a representative role in government, she
must pinpoint the concerns of the students and see
that they are addressed in the Senate. Only through
diligent promotion of increased community be
tween the Senate and the student body can a
senator be most effective.
There are many issues of importance to grapple
with, but I would like to concentrate on the follow
ing areas: 1) development of a program to offset the
spiraling costs of tuition; 2) the lack of minority in
volvement in ASSU organizations; 3) the inadequacy
of food service with its high costs and low quality
meals; 4) the absence of regular Senate/residence
interaction. Howeer, my primary interest focuses on
the maintained interplay between a senator and her
constituents. I would suggest a revitalization about
what the Senate is doing.
♦ Bart Foster

It is time for a new agenda in the ASSU Senate. In
the past the Senate has wasted large amounts of
time debating useless bylaw changes and tech
nicalities, while neglecting the ideas that could serve
the students directly. As a Senator, I will work to im
prove the services already offered by the ASSU, and
also to provide new services. Among other goals, I
plan to resurrect the concept of a shuttle to San
Francisco for Stanford students that was defeated by
this year's Senate; I plan to work towards machine
readable I.D.'s that would simplify library checkout
and food service; and, most importantly, I will be
receptive to new ideas and concerns. I offer a new
view and a new overall emphasis, not just bureau
cracy.

As an ASSU senator, I intend to focus my attention
on the important issues. I staunchly believe in
greater communication among the various sectors
of the Stanford community. Dialogue between stu
dents and trustees, students and senate could be im
proved. I will also support the continuing study of
the ASSU Task Force on Food Service, with the goal
of providing better food at lower prices. Further
more, I would pledge my support to the SF/Stanford
shuttle which I feel would greatly facilitate access to
cultural events. Finally, I would promote the rees
tablishment of a concert network to expand contem
porary entertainment on campus.

Your questions: What is the ASSU doing? Who is
my Senator? I lost my receipt, why can't I get my fee
assessment refund? Mine is: "Why can't we improve
the image of the ASSU Senate?" I'd like to address
these topics with a fresher perspective after having
seen its bureaucracy and inefficiencies this year as
an ASSU Senate Associate.
Specifically, let's work on (1) student body "card"
for food service, libraries, ID; (2) better voter
receipt/refund system; (3) (you liked it — it failed)
shuttle bus to the City; (4) better funding for student
groups; (5) much more communication; (6) most
importantly, your ideas and YOU!
♦ David M. "Jake" Jeakle
Major: Mechanical Engineering
Having spoken with previous senators, I hope to
use their suggestions and ideas to avoid making the
same mistakes they did. I'm not an expert on eco
nomics or food service or legal precedence, but I
recognize this fact. The senate deals with more is
sues than any one person could specialize in.
However, there are many members of the faculty
and student body who are experts in the fields the
senate will have to debate. I'm willing to seek out
their expertise in order to make the best decision I
can with the time that I'll have.

The responsibility of a senator is to make deci
sions that will benefit the lives and rights of Stanford
students while barring his personal prejudices and
preferences. A senator must realize that a voice is
still important even though it may be a small or
minority voice, and it is his duty to give attention
and service to all students and not just a select group
that he chooses. In short, a senator owes allegiance
to all students, and not just to the constituents that
elected him; his duty as a senator is to therefore fol
low through on this allegiance.
The issues that I will address as senator encom
pass the areas of academics, health and safety. In
terms of academics, I would like to see longer library
hours on a regular basis and not solely during dead
and finals weeks. Also, I would like to see more
valuable cultural and educational events on campus.
For safety, I would work for better lighting on
campus and bike safety precautions. Finally, in the
area of health, I would strive for making Cowell a
more efficient and reliable student health center
that students could trust rather than fear.

As a student union, the ASSU is supposed to be a
representation of the general student body. Yet to
too many people it has the,image.of being a remote,

political clique concerned only with its own inter
ests. An ASSU Senator should bring the power of the
student union back into the power of the students it
represents.
The issues for the coming year will be primarily
carry-over topics from this last Senate. The fee as
sessments and the high cost of food service are two
subjects that have yet to be sufficiently solved. More
important than stating exact answers to possible is
sues here, I'd rather say that I want to change how
senators handle the issues. Too much Senate action
has been taken without the senators researching the
issues. With my news background I've learned infor
mation is the key to efficiency and fairness.
♦ Chris Kober

Offices Held: Lacrosse team treasurer
The basic function of the ASSU Senate is to repre
sent the students' views in pressing for changes
within the University. As it presently stands, few stu
dents know who the senators are, much less what
they do. I would support a policy whereby students
could present their grievances through the Daily,
and the senate could reply as to the action being
taken.
My particular areas of interest are in the preserva
tion and expansion of the fraternity/sorority system
and the reduction of procedures necessary for clubs
and activities to receive their funding.
♦ Fred Laningham
Major: Biology
Student-Senate relationships have become
noticeably better in the past two years and as a
senator I would hope to continue the progress. If
chosen to represent you, I would like to initiate
more ASSU programs that students would benefit
directly from. I would like to: (1) begin an ASSU
sponsored bulletin published weekly that would
serve the purpose of communicating ASSU doings
and also be a free line of communication for stu
dents and groups to announce upcoming campus
and community events; (2) begin an ASSU
sponsored concert series. We all are putting a lot
into Stanford, I want to help us get a lot out also.

gineering (WISE), publicity chairman (3 quarters)
A Senator works in conjunction with the student
body to establish policy concerning those issues of
importance to the students. It is imperative that we
learn to recognize those problems which affect our
fellow humans and the forums of community service
through which we can work to ameliorate them. I
feel that the Senate should foster an environment
receptive to community service awareness through
the establishment of a committee devoted to
representing community service efforts.
Increasing the size of the post office to shorten
long lines and approving the Stanford Coalition on
Minority Admission are also issues of major impor
tance. '•> ti< i > .' • •

Next year, as an ASSU senator my goals would be
to establish better relations between the Stanford
students and the Senate, to adopt a campus wide
meal plan similar to that already in use at Sterling
Quad, and finally to develop a combination photo
ID/ library/ meal card. As a senator, I would like to
see the Senate become more aware and involved
with everyday student problems.

An ASSU senator must act as the representative of
student interests. Specifically, the senator is respon
sible for promoting programs that meet student
needs. A senator should voice student concerns
within the ASSU and to University officials. Most im
portantly, a senator must be an accessible and effec
tive resource for students. As a senator, I will work
for reducing food costs, make the Senate more
responsive to the students with better districting,
work at reducing the bureaucracy of the election
process, and be available to help students and stu
dent groups. As an active student, I would effective
ly represent the various student concerns.

The Senate acts as a liaison between the student
body and the school administration while providing
services to the student.
Among the projects I will pursue are to: 1) draw
more prominent speakers by helping to coordinate
the efforts of the various speaker's bureaus; 2) in
crease our late night eating options; 3) build a
speaker's corner in White Plaza; 4) work toward the
construction of a student organizations center; and
finally, at the risk of sounding sentimental, 5) to in
crease awareness of Stanford traditions.
I have the energy to initiate these projects and
three years to see them through.

As senator, my duties will include bi-weekly visits
to dorms and encouragement of student participa
tion in ASSU committees. I will address minority
concerns in the ASSU and will act as liaison between
students and the University.
As senator, I intend to address the following stu
dent concerns:
1. Adherence to Dead Week Policy. Dead Week
George Ramos, Continued
should be a period of review of course material,
not a time to introduce new material.
2. Expansion of LOTS. New resources must be
found which will enable LOTS to expand, thus
reducing the anxiety experienced by students
in introductory Computer Science courses.
3. Establish a junior class cabinet which will plan
activities similar to those of the senior class.

A senator is a chef. In helping to make the ex
tracurricular desserts, he needs to be particularly
sensitive to the appetite and tastes of Stanford stu
dents. I would like to add to the ASSU's menu: an
endowment fund to bring in political figures and or
ganizations to debate current issues, a spring, all
campus, barbeque SU Festival (a small US Festival),
and mini-busses available for student groups to rent
for field trips and regular San Francisco shuttles. I
also believe Senate meetings should be held in
dorms, with prior, conspicuous posting of agendas.
A fine restaurant like Stanford should offer more ex
tracurricular desserts.

This year I worked hard to be a worthy
representative of my constituency. I will continue
that effort next year, striving to be an informed
senator making decisions based on the student in
put I diligently seek. I have learned well how the
Senate operates; I want to use that experience and
my energy to ensure the ASSU more consistently
meets student needs.
Specifically, I plan to re-introduce my idea for free
shuttle-bus service to S.F., reform the Fee Assess

University — acting before it's too late — and con
tinue pressing for extended library hours.

As an ASSU Senator, I have served students well. I
have attended every senate meeting, tout ensemble.
None of my colleagues can make the same claim.
I have worked to increase "senate to student"
communication by establishing the ASSU News and
by personally writing a district newsletter. I have
tried to increase "student to senate" input by regu
larly attending house meetings and by developing
and distributing surveys.
I care. I have a lot of fun in the ASSU Senate.

Certainly the primary goal of a Senator and the
Senate is to serve the student body. In this capacity
the Senate should:
1. establish a governing committee of student or
ganizations which currently bring speakers to
campus to help them work in a more cohesive
and organized manner.
2. establish a low-cost shuttle service to the air
port during exams and to San Francisco.
3. work to bring concerts to campus through the
Concert Network. Furthermore, the Senate
must continue to address the issues facing the
student body. These issues include both food
service and the scrutiny under which frater
nities and sororities have recently come.

Think. What do you really want? Do you want a
Senator who'll give you a voice in the process, who
realizes that bills he passes may affect everyone? Do
you want a Senator who's got the guts and enthusi
asm to take on difficult projects, but who's also will
ing to do all the mind-numbing background work
that goes along with the job?
If that's what you want, you're looking in the right
place. Because I can be that good for you. I want to
help; I want to make a difference. So elect me, and
let me prove it.

subjects that have yet to be sufficiently solved. More

has been taken without the senators researching the
issues. With my news background I've learned infor

The basic function of the ASSU Senate is to repre
sent the students' views in pressing for changes
within the University. As it presently stands, few stu
dents know who the senators are, much less what
they do. I would support a policy whereby students
could present their grievances through the Daily,
and the senate could reply as to the action being
taken.
My particular areas of interest are in the preserva

and the reduction of procedures necessary for clubs
and activities to receive their funding.

sponsored bulletin published weekly that would
serve the purpose of communicating ASSU doings

working as well as see the establishment of a word

Every election year, the student body hears the
same campaign themes. And every election year, the
student body resounds: "BULLSHIT! The Senate is a
bureaucratic monstrosity populated by un
responsive and irresponsible 'representatives.' " To
a large degree, they're right.

Given the structure of the Senate, Senators are
limited in scope and influence. Regardless, the Sen
ate should serve as both a vehicle for student needs
and a voice for their consciousness. As a Senator, I
would focus on students and issues, not bylaws. The
ASSU, the administration, faculty, and campus or
ganizations should coalesce over the pertinent is
sues of our education, finances, housing, services
and facilities, and cultural enrichment. And the Sen
ate should provide the primary forum for debate,
communication, and action. With your help and

2) printing the voting records of all Senators in the

The scope of an ASSU senator's duties is limited

assumes a representative role in government, she
must pinpoint the concerns of the students and see
that they are addressed in the Senate. Only through
diligent promotion of increased community be

senator be most effective.
There are many issues of importance to grapple
with, but I would like to concentrate on the follow
ing areas: 1) development of a program to offset the
spiraling costs of tuition; 2) the lack of minority in
volvement in ASSU organizations; 3) the inadequacy
of food service with its high costs and low quality
meals; 4) the absence of regular Senate/residence

their expertise in order to make the best decision I

The responsibility of a senator is to make deci
sions that will benefit the lives and rights of Stanford
students while barring his personal prejudices and
preferences. A senator must realize that a voice is
still important even though it may be a small or
minority voice, and it is his duty to give attention
and service to all students and not just a select group
that he chooses. In short, a senator owes allegiance
to all students, and not just to the constituents that
elected him; his duty as a senator is to therefore fol
low through on this allegiance.
The issues that I will address as senator encom
pass the areas of academics, health and safety. In
terms of academics, I would like to see longer library
hours on a regular basis and not solely during dead
and finals weeks. Also, I would like to see more
valuable cultural and educational events on campus.
For safety, I would work for better lighting on
campus and bike safety precautions. Finally, in the
area of health, I would strive for making Cowell a
more efficient and reliable student health center
that students could trust rather than fear.

The scope of an individual ASSU Senator's duties
are ultimately determined by forces outside his con
trol, with one important exception. A senator's ul
timate duty is to his constituents, which is
determined by the individual and is the purpose of
this election. Personally I'd like to see the ASSU
bank account system reformed because it isn't
working as well as see the establishment of a word
processing service. But most of all I'd work for what
YOU, the voter, wants. The real difference between
senators is attitude. It may sound corny, but I
believe when you are elected to serve the student
body, that's what you should do.

Every election year, the student body hears the
same campaign themes. And every election year, the
student body resounds: "BULLSHIT! The Senate is a
bureaucratic monstrosity populated by un
responsive and irresponsible 'representatives.' " To
a large degree, they're right.

Given the structure of the Senate, Senators are
limited in scope and influence. Regardless, the Sen
ate should serve as both a vehicle for student needs
and a voice for their consciousness. As a Senator, I
would focus on students and issues, not bylaws. The
ASSU, the administration, faculty, and campus or

The responsibility of a senator is to make deci
sions that will benefit the lives and rights of Stanford
students while barring his personal prejudices and
preferences. A senator must realize that a voice is
still important even though it may be a small or
minority voice, and it is his duty to give attention
and service to all students and not just a select group
that he chooses. In short, a senator owes allegiance
to all students, and not just to the constituents that
elected him; his duty as a senator is to therefore fol
low through on this allegiance.
The issues that I will address as senator encom
pass the areas of academics, health and safety. In
terms of academics, I would like to see longer library
hours on a regular basis and not solely during dead
and finals weeks. Also, I would like to see more
valuable cultural and educational events on campus.
For safety, I would work for better lighting on
campus and bike safety precautions. Finally, in the
area of health, I would strive for making Cowell a
more efficient and reliable student health center
that students could trust rather than fear.

As a student union, the ASSU is supposed to be a
representation of the general student body. Yet to
too many people it has the,image.of being a remote,

political clique concerned only with its own inter

student union back into the power of the students it
represents.
The issues for the coming year will be primarily
carry-over topics from this last Senate. The fee as
sessments and the high cost of food service are two
subjects that have yet to be sufficiently solved. More
important than stating exact answers to possible is
sues here, I'd rather say that I want to change how
senators handle the issues. Too much Senate action
has been taken without the senators researching the
issues. With my news background I've learned infor

learn to recognize those problems which affect our

feel that the Senate should foster an environment
receptive to community service awareness through
the establishment of a committee devoted to
representing community service efforts.

2. establish a low-cost shuttle service to the air

sponsored concert series. We all are putting a lot
into Stanford, I want to help us get a lot out also.

Every election year, the student body hears the

bureaucratic monstrosity populated by un

Given the structure of the Senate, Senators are
limited in scope and influence. Regardless, the Sen
ate should serve as both a vehicle for student needs
and a voice for their consciousness. As a Senator, I
would focus on students and issues, not bylaws. The
ASSU, the administration, faculty, and campus or

The scope of an ASSU senator's duties is limited

assumes a representative role in government, she
must pinpoint the concerns of the students and see
that they are addressed in the Senate. Only through

senator be most effective.
There are many issues of importance to grapple
with, but I would like to concentrate on the follow

spiraling costs of tuition; 2) the lack of minority in
volvement in ASSU organizations; 3) the inadequacy
of food service with its high costs and low quality
meals; 4) the absence of regular Senate/residence

plan to resurrect the concept of a shuttle to San
Francisco for Stanford students that was defeated by

of providing better food at lower prices. Further

seen its bureaucracy and inefficiencies this year as

However, there are many members of the faculty

senate will have to debate. I'm willing to seek out
their expertise in order to make the best decision I
can with the time that I'll have.

The responsibility of a senator is to make deci
sions that will benefit the lives and rights of Stanford
students while barring his personal prejudices and
preferences. A senator must realize that a voice is
still important even though it may be a small or
minority voice, and it is his duty to give attention
and service to all students and not just a select group
that he chooses. In short, a senator owes allegiance
to all students, and not just to the constituents that
elected him; his duty as a senator is to therefore fol
low through on this allegiance.
The issues that I will address as senator encom
pass the areas of academics, health and safety. In
terms of academics, I would like to see longer library
hours on a regular basis and not solely during dead
and finals weeks. Also, I would like to see more
valuable cultural and educational events on campus.
For safety, I would work for better lighting on
campus and bike safety precautions. Finally, in the
area of health, I would strive for making Cowell a
more efficient and reliable student health center
that students could trust rather than fear.

As a student union, the ASSU is supposed to be a
representation of the general student body. Yet to
too many people it has the,image.of being a remote,

political clique concerned only with its own inter
ests. An ASSU Senator should bring the power of the
student union back into the power of the students it
represents.
The issues for the coming year will be primarily
carry-over topics from this last Senate. The fee as
sessments and the high cost of food service are two
subjects that have yet to be sufficiently solved. More
important than stating exact answers to possible is
sues here, I'd rather say that I want to change how
senators handle the issues. Too much Senate action
has been taken without the senators researching the
issues. With my news background I've learned infor
mation is the key to efficiency and fairness.

limited in scope and influence. Regardless, the Sen
ate should serve as both a vehicle for student needs
and a voice for their consciousness. As a Senator, I
would focus on students and issues, not bylaws. The
ASSU, the administration, faculty, and campus or
ganizations should coalesce over the pertinent is
sues of our education, finances, housing, services
and facilities, and cultural enrichment. And the Sen
ate should provide the primary forum for debate,
communication, and action. With your help and
support, I feel that we could begin the process of
positive change.

The duties of an ASSU Senator are to understand
the needs of the Stanford student body and to pro
pose and find methods of effectively meeting these
needs by either making amendments in already
existing institutions, or implementing new ones.
The Meyer Undergraduate Library does not provide
a conducive study atmosphere. The chairs are un
comfortable, the decor is ugly, and there are bats. I
would like to address this problem in order to attain
money for an overhaul of Meyer Library.

The ASSU Senate has taken great strides towards
improved communications with the student body
by means of the "ASSU News" and the dorm dis
tricting system. I believe my main responsibility as
Senator would be to further increase community
awareness of Senate actions. To encourage greater
community participation in Senate actions, I would
begin with the following projects:
1) publicizing upcoming Senate meetings and
describing the issues to be voted on;
2) printing the voting records of all Senators in the
"ASSU News".

It's time to break out of the mold. . .
BUDGET-FEES-BUDGET-FEES comprise a lot of
what the ASSU is about. As a senator, I'm about
focusing on the implementation of services vital to
the student community.
Keep the Coffee House as an ASSU service, not
Tresidder management.
Re-introduce the San Francisco shuttle-bus service.
For minimal fees this can be viable financially and
facilitate getting off campus.
Represent Governor's Corner and Fraternities. There
are currently no senate districts assigned to repre
sent these areas.
Communication with the student body is a pri
mary responsibility! I am committed to serving
YOU.

The scope of an ASSU senator's duties is limited
by the interests of her constituency. Because she
assumes a representative role in government, she
must pinpoint the concerns of the students and see
that they are addressed in the Senate. Only through
diligent promotion of increased community be
tween the Senate and the student body can a
senator be most effective.
There are many issues of importance to grapple
with, but I would like to concentrate on the follow
ing areas: 1) development of a program to offset the
spiraling costs of tuition; 2) the lack of minority in
volvement in ASSU organizations; 3) the inadequacy
of food service with its high costs and low quality
meals; 4) the absence of regular Senate/residence
interaction. Howeer, my primary interest focuses on
the maintained interplay between a senator and her
constituents. I would suggest a revitalization about
what the Senate is doing.

It is time for a new agenda in the ASSU Senate. In
the past the Senate has wasted large amounts of
time debating useless bylaw changes and tech
nicalities, while neglecting the ideas that could serve
the students directly. As a Senator, I will work to im
prove the services already offered by the ASSU, and
also to provide new services. Among other goals, I
plan to resurrect the concept of a shuttle to San
Francisco for Stanford students that was defeated by
this year's Senate; I plan to work towards machine
readable I.D.'s that would simplify library checkout
and food service; and, most importantly, I will be
receptive to new ideas and concerns. I offer a new
view and a new overall emphasis, not just bureau
cracy.

As an ASSU senator, I intend to focus my attention
on the important issues. I staunchly believe in
greater communication among the various sectors
of the Stanford community. Dialogue between stu
dents and trustees, students and senate could be im
proved. I will also support the continuing study of
the ASSU Task Force on Food Service, with the goal
of providing better food at lower prices. Further
more, I would pledge my support to the SF/Stanford
shuttle which I feel would greatly facilitate access to
cultural events. Finally, I would promote the rees
tablishment of a concert network to expand contem
porary entertainment on campus.

Your questions: What is the ASSU doing? Who is
my Senator? I lost my receipt, why can't I get my fee
assessment refund? Mine is: "Why can't we improve
the image of the ASSU Senate?" I'd like to address
these topics with a fresher perspective after having
seen its bureaucracy and inefficiencies this year as
an ASSU Senate Associate.
Specifically, let's work on (1) student body "card"
for food service, libraries, ID; (2) better voter
receipt/refund system; (3) (you liked it — it failed)
shuttle bus to the City; (4) better funding for student
groups; (5) much more communication; (6) most
importantly, your ideas and YOU!
♦ David M. "Jake" Jeakle
Major: Mechanical Engineering
Having spoken with previous senators, I hope to
use their suggestions and ideas to avoid making the
same mistakes they did. I'm not an expert on eco
nomics or food service or legal precedence, but I
recognize this fact. The senate deals with more is
sues than any one person could specialize in.
However, there are many members of the faculty
and student body who are experts in the fields the
senate will have to debate. I'm willing to seek out
their expertise in order to make the best decision I
can with the time that I'll have.

The responsibility of a senator is to make deci
sions that will benefit the lives and rights of Stanford
students while barring his personal prejudices and
preferences. A senator must realize that a voice is
still important even though it may be a small or
minority voice, and it is his duty to give attention
and service to all students and not just a select group
that he chooses. In short, a senator owes allegiance
to all students, and not just to the constituents that
elected him; his duty as a senator is to therefore fol
low through on this allegiance.
The issues that I will address as senator encom
pass the areas of academics, health and safety. In
terms of academics, I would like to see longer library
hours on a regular basis and not solely during dead
and finals weeks. Also, I would like to see more
valuable cultural and educational events on campus.
For safety, I would work for better lighting on
campus and bike safety precautions. Finally, in the
area of health, I would strive for making Cowell a
more efficient and reliable student health center
that students could trust rather than fear.

As a student union, the ASSU is supposed to be a
representation of the general student body. Yet to
too many people it has the,image.of being a remote,

political clique concerned only with its own inter
ests. An ASSU Senator should bring the power of the
student union back into the power of the students it
represents.
The issues for the coming year will be primarily
carry-over topics from this last Senate. The fee as
sessments and the high cost of food service are two
subjects that have yet to be sufficiently solved. More
important than stating exact answers to possible is
sues here, I'd rather say that I want to change how
senators handle the issues. Too much Senate action
has been taken without the senators researching the
issues. With my news background I've learned infor
mation is the key to efficiency and fairness.

The basic function of the ASSU Senate is to repre
sent the students' views in pressing for changes
within the University. As it presently stands, few stu
dents know who the senators are, much less what
they do. I would support a policy whereby students
could present their grievances through the Daily,
and the senate could reply as to the action being
taken.
My particular areas of interest are in the preserva
tion and expansion of the fraternity/sorority system
and the reduction of procedures necessary for clubs
and activities to receive their funding.
♦ Fred Laningham
Major: Biology
Student-Senate relationships have become
noticeably better in the past two years and as a
senator I would hope to continue the progress. If
chosen to represent you, I would like to initiate
more ASSU programs that students would benefit
directly from. I would like to: (1) begin an ASSU
sponsored bulletin published weekly that would
serve the purpose of communicating ASSU doings
and also be a free line of communication for stu
dents and groups to announce upcoming campus
and community events; (2) begin an ASSU
sponsored concert series. We all are putting a lot
into Stanford, I want to help us get a lot out also.

A Senator works in conjunction with the student
body to establish policy concerning those issues of
importance to the students. It is imperative that we
learn to recognize those problems which affect our
fellow humans and the forums of community service
through which we can work to ameliorate them. I
feel that the Senate should foster an environment
receptive to community service awareness through
the establishment of a committee devoted to
representing community service efforts.
Increasing the size of the post office to shorten
long lines and approving the Stanford Coalition on
Minority Admission are also issues of major impor
tance. '•> ti< i > .' • •

see the Senate become more aware and involved

An ASSU senator must act as the representative of
student interests. Specifically, the senator is respon
sible for promoting programs that meet student
needs. A senator should voice student concerns
within the ASSU and to University officials. Most im
portantly, a senator must be an accessible and effec
tive resource for students. As a senator, I will work
for reducing food costs, make the Senate more
responsive to the students with better districting,
work at reducing the bureaucracy of the election
process, and be available to help students and stu
dent groups. As an active student, I would effective
ly represent the various student concerns.

The Senate acts as a liaison between the student

services to the student.
Among the projects I will pursue are to: 1) draw
more prominent speakers by helping to coordinate
the efforts of the various speaker's bureaus; 2) in
crease our late night eating options; 3) build a
speaker's corner in White Plaza; 4) work toward the
construction of a student organizations center; and
finally, at the risk of sounding sentimental, 5) to in

As senator, I intend to address the following stu

1. Adherence to Dead Week Policy. Dead Week

should be a period of review of course material,

reducing the anxiety experienced by students

3. Establish a junior class cabinet which will plan
activities similar to those of the senior class.

A senator is a chef. In helping to make the ex
tracurricular desserts, he needs to be particularly
sensitive to the appetite and tastes of Stanford stu

endowment fund to bring in political figures and or
ganizations to debate current issues, a spring, all
campus, barbeque SU Festival (a small US Festival),
and mini-busses available for student groups to rent
for field trips and regular San Francisco shuttles. I
also believe Senate meetings should be held in
dorms, with prior, conspicuous posting of agendas.
A fine restaurant like Stanford should offer more ex

Certainly the primary goal of a Senator and the
Senate is to serve the student body. In this capacity
the Senate should:
1. establish a governing committee of student or
ganizations which currently bring speakers to
campus to help them work in a more cohesive
and organized manner.
2. establish a low-cost shuttle service to the air
port during exams and to San Francisco.
3. work to bring concerts to campus through the
Concert Network. Furthermore, the Senate
must continue to address the issues facing the
student body. These issues include both food
service and the scrutiny under which frater
nities and sororities have recently come.
