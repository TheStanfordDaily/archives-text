Humanities and Sciences
♦ Eric M. Berg
Department of Economics, PhD program; Member,
Trustees Committee on Academic Affairs & Develop
ment (1983-84); ASSU Senate (1983-84); Committee
on Graduate Studies (1980-83); SWOPSI Policy Board
(1980-83); Task Group on Housing Rates (1982-83);
Treasurer, Graduate Student Association (1981-date)
As a member of the Senate this year, I have
worked to rationalize the budget and finances of the
ASSU and to increase the accountability of student
organizations for funds they receive from the stu
dent body.
As Co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, I
worked to keep the increase in next year's Associa
tion Fee to a reasonable level (approximately 15 per
cent as opposed to this year's 60 percent increase).
I also remain committed to a strong
representation of graduate student issues (more
graduate housing, protection against conflicts of in
terest, adequate stipends, and input into
departmental decision-making) within the ASSU.
♦ Mark Landesmann
International Policy Studies, Coterminal program;
Chairman, Honor Code Commission (1983-84); Core
Committee Member, Guest Professorship Board
(starting Winter 1984); Vice-president AIESEC
(International Association of Economics and Busi

ness Students, Spring 1983); Energy Representative
(1982-83); Coordinator for Austria, International
Solidarity Day for Soviet Jewry (1982); Co-founder,
Flying Club (Brandeis University, 1982); Co
president, Friendship International (Brandeis Uni
versity, 1982); Representative at the General
Assembly, National Model U.N. (1982)
If elected, my first and foremost priority will be to
increase and ameliorate graduate student housing
on campus. As one of the few strange individuals
that take the ASSU still seriously, I am disturbed by
its irresponsiveness to graduate student concerns
and interests. Senators should not be unwilling to
use the Senate as a political platform to push
towards increases in graduate student housing and
financial assistance. Fee assessments paid by the
graduate constituency are still totally out of propor
tion with the funding and services that are supplied
to it by the ASSU. I'd like to change that and thus re
quest your vote. This candidate is endorsed by
former graduate senator Eric Diesel (CSA).
♦ James McGrath
Computer Science Department; Member, Student
Conduct Legislative Council (83-84); Member,
ASSU-Tresidder Task Force on Tresidder Renovation
(84); ASSU Graduate Senator (81-84); Member,
Committee on Contemporary Entertainment (83-84);
Senate Liaison, ASSU Publications Board (83-84);
Member, ASSU Senate Appropriations Committee
(83-84); Chair, ASSU Senate Graduate Education and
Research Committee (82-84); Member, Concert
Committee (83); Senate Liaison, University Steering
Group on CATV (83); Member and Chair, ASSU Sen
ate Administration and Rules Committee (81-83);
Member, Tresidder Union Board (82-83); Member,
Task Group on Housing Rate Equity (82); Member,
University Committee on Computing and Informa
tion Technology (80-81); Member, ASSU Publica
tions Board (78-80); Member, Subcommittee on the
Evaluation and Improvement of Teaching (77-79)
For the past 3 years I have been working to insure
that graduate student concerns are voiced within
both the ASSU and the University. This has meant
scrutinizing ASSU spending so as to reduce the
amount of fee assessments you pay every quarter
while still bringing you worthwhile services, and
monitoring actions of various University committees
(e.g. the Committee on Graduate Studies and the
Committee on Research) that affect graduate stu
dent interests. I believe I have been able to ac
complish much, but much remains undone.

of Presidents 5/83-5/84; Chair, ASSU Nominations
Commission 1/82-1/83; Project Manager, Splendor
on the Grass 10/81-5/82
As an ASSU Graduate Senator, I would hope to
provide continuity to the Graduate student voice
with regard to several issues through the University
including: access to low cost word processing for
dissertation work regardless of department, extend
ing the hours of Green Library, continuing to bring
the immediate need for new graduate housing to the
attention of the University, and working toward an
increase in both academic and social programming
support for graduate students from the office of Stu
dent Affairs and Graduate Studies.
♦ Roland van Gaalen
Statistics and Economics, PhD program; El Cuadro
Eating Club; LOTS BBoard Society
ASSU Senator since 1982; (1) wrote rules guaran
teeing ASSU guest professors academic freedom; (2)
Roland van Gaalen, Continued
co-authored resolution (not adopted) in favor of
Reagan library and policy center; (3) opposed
resolution banning research with potential applica
tions in nuclear weapons; (4) tried to prevent the
use of ASSU money for frivolous expenditures by
special interest groups; (5) opposes the misconcep
tion that the Senate is authorized to make political
statements on behalf of the student body; (6)
deplores housing shortage on campus and resents
segregation of graduates and undergraduates, but is
powerless to improve matters; (7) favors installation
of nuclear warheads in the Hoover Tower aimed at
Manley and Rebholz.

♦ Giles J. Brereton
Mechanical Engineering Department; Cricket Club
Representative and Member, Finance Committee,
Club Sports Council
Being an Alumnus of Imperial College, London, I
am as much of an imperialist as one can imagine. If
elected, I shall be particularly concerned about the
substantial waste of money on non-military research
in Graduate Schools and lack of elitist political tradi
tions in ASSU elections viz. lack of scandals. I shall
transform the ASSU Senate from a body obsessed
with legalistic procedures to one dedicated to the
finest of Imperial traditions. Dedication to sports
such as polo and cricket; socializing activities like
"yard of ale" drinking and dress codes (wearing ties)
shall be my policy hallmarks.

♦ Gary M. Kaitz
Graduate Law/Business; ASSU Senator 83/84, member
appropriations committee; Business Manager, The
Company
The ASSU is so dominated by undergraduates and
so underwhelmed by graduate apathy that the ASSU
ends up doing very little for the graduate profes
sional schools. I believe things can get better. Spe
cifically I am working towards:
1) More social interaction among students in the
graduate departments and between graduates and
undergraduates.
2) A more effective use of the ASSU's approxi
mately million-dollar budget. We should be able to
cut out a lot of wasted money and reduce tuition and
special PTR fees.
3) More and better on-campus graduate housing.
The University needs to realize that grads need
apartments, not dorm rooms. A good compromise
would be to build more suites.

♦ Wes Sterman
School of Medicine, MD degree program; Assistant
Editor, Inside Stanford magazine; Secretary, The
Campus Connection; Member, Adelfa Council;
Palatability Consultant, Lagunita Food Service
There is a substantial lack of contact between stu
dents in the professional schools and the ASSU. I
plan to work to correct this situation. Improvements
that I would support include restructuring of the
ASSU fee assessments policy in order to differenti
ate between graduate students and undergraduates,
formation of a professional student's association,
and establishing graduate access to the Overseas
Program. Of interest to the general student commu
nity, I would like to see the student information
phone number reinstated, the campus photocopy
ing facilities improved, and an increase in the variety
of items that students can rent from the ASSU.

representation of graduate student issues (more
graduate housing, protection against conflicts of in

If elected, my first and foremost priority will be to
increase and ameliorate graduate student housing
on campus. As one of the few strange individuals
that take the ASSU still seriously, I am disturbed by
its irresponsiveness to graduate student concerns
and interests. Senators should not be unwilling to
use the Senate as a political platform to push
towards increases in graduate student housing and
financial assistance. Fee assessments paid by the
graduate constituency are still totally out of propor

to it by the ASSU. I'd like to change that and thus re
quest your vote. This candidate is endorsed by
former graduate senator Eric Diesel (CSA).

For the past 3 years I have been working to insure
that graduate student concerns are voiced within
both the ASSU and the University. This has meant
scrutinizing ASSU spending so as to reduce the
amount of fee assessments you pay every quarter
while still bringing you worthwhile services, and
monitoring actions of various University committees
(e.g. the Committee on Graduate Studies and the
Committee on Research) that affect graduate stu

Being an Alumnus of Imperial College, London, I
am as much of an imperialist as one can imagine. If
elected, I shall be particularly concerned about the
substantial waste of money on non-military research
in Graduate Schools and lack of elitist political tradi
tions in ASSU elections viz. lack of scandals. I shall
transform the ASSU Senate from a body obsessed
with legalistic procedures to one dedicated to the
finest of Imperial traditions. Dedication to sports
such as polo and cricket; socializing activities like
"yard of ale" drinking and dress codes (wearing ties)
shall be my policy hallmarks.

The ASSU is so dominated by undergraduates and
so underwhelmed by graduate apathy that the ASSU
ends up doing very little for the graduate profes
sional schools. I believe things can get better. Spe
cifically I am working towards:
1) More social interaction among students in the
graduate departments and between graduates and
undergraduates.
2) A more effective use of the ASSU's approxi
mately million-dollar budget. We should be able to
cut out a lot of wasted money and reduce tuition and
special PTR fees.
3) More and better on-campus graduate housing.
The University needs to realize that grads need
apartments, not dorm rooms. A good compromise
would be to build more suites.

There is a substantial lack of contact between stu

plan to work to correct this situation. Improvements
that I would support include restructuring of the
ASSU fee assessments policy in order to differenti
ate between graduate students and undergraduates,
formation of a professional student's association,
and establishing graduate access to the Overseas
Program. Of interest to the general student commu
nity, I would like to see the student information
phone number reinstated, the campus photocopy

of items that students can rent from the ASSU.
