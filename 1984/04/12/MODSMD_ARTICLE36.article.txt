♦ Eric M. Berg
Department of Economics, PhD program; Member,
Trustees Committee on Academic Affairs & Develop
ment (1983-84); ASSU Senate (1983-84); Committee
on Graduate Studies (1980-83); SWOPSI Policy Board
(1980-83); Task Group on Housing Rates (1982-83);
Treasurer, Graduate Student Association (1981-date)
As a member of the Senate this year, I have
worked to rationalize the budget and finances of the
ASSU and to increase the accountability of student
organizations for funds they receive from the stu
dent body.
As Co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, I
worked to keep the increase in next year's Associa
tion Fee to a reasonable level (approximately 15 per
cent as opposed to this year's 60 percent increase).
I also remain committed to a strong
representation of graduate student issues (more
graduate housing, protection against conflicts of in
terest, adequate stipends, and input into
departmental decision-making) within the ASSU.
♦ Mark Landesmann
International Policy Studies, Coterminal program;
Chairman, Honor Code Commission (1983-84); Core
Committee Member, Guest Professorship Board
(starting Winter 1984); Vice-president AIESEC
(International Association of Economics and Busi

ness Students, Spring 1983); Energy Representative
(1982-83); Coordinator for Austria, International
Solidarity Day for Soviet Jewry (1982); Co-founder,
Flying Club (Brandeis University, 1982); Co
president, Friendship International (Brandeis Uni
versity, 1982); Representative at the General
Assembly, National Model U.N. (1982)
If elected, my first and foremost priority will be to
increase and ameliorate graduate student housing
on campus. As one of the few strange individuals
that take the ASSU still seriously, I am disturbed by
its irresponsiveness to graduate student concerns
and interests. Senators should not be unwilling to
use the Senate as a political platform to push
towards increases in graduate student housing and
financial assistance. Fee assessments paid by the
graduate constituency are still totally out of propor
tion with the funding and services that are supplied
to it by the ASSU. I'd like to change that and thus re
quest your vote. This candidate is endorsed by
former graduate senator Eric Diesel (CSA).
♦ James McGrath
Computer Science Department; Member, Student
Conduct Legislative Council (83-84); Member,
ASSU-Tresidder Task Force on Tresidder Renovation
(84); ASSU Graduate Senator (81-84); Member,
Committee on Contemporary Entertainment (83-84);
Senate Liaison, ASSU Publications Board (83-84);
Member, ASSU Senate Appropriations Committee
(83-84); Chair, ASSU Senate Graduate Education and
Research Committee (82-84); Member, Concert
Committee (83); Senate Liaison, University Steering
Group on CATV (83); Member and Chair, ASSU Sen
ate Administration and Rules Committee (81-83);
Member, Tresidder Union Board (82-83); Member,
Task Group on Housing Rate Equity (82); Member,
University Committee on Computing and Informa
tion Technology (80-81); Member, ASSU Publica
tions Board (78-80); Member, Subcommittee on the
Evaluation and Improvement of Teaching (77-79)
For the past 3 years I have been working to insure
that graduate student concerns are voiced within
both the ASSU and the University. This has meant
scrutinizing ASSU spending so as to reduce the
amount of fee assessments you pay every quarter
while still bringing you worthwhile services, and
monitoring actions of various University committees
(e.g. the Committee on Graduate Studies and the
Committee on Research) that affect graduate stu
dent interests. I believe I have been able to ac
complish much, but much remains undone.
♦ Su Uhland
Linguistics, Masters Degree Program; ASSU Council
of Presidents 5/83-5/84; Chair, ASSU Nominations
Commission 1/82-1/83; Project Manager, Splendor
on the Grass 10/81-5/82
As an ASSU Graduate Senator, I would hope to
provide continuity to the Graduate student voice
with regard to several issues through the University
including: access to low cost word processing for
dissertation work regardless of department, extend
ing the hours of Green Library, continuing to bring
the immediate need for new graduate housing to the
attention of the University, and working toward an
increase in both academic and social programming
support for graduate students from the office of Stu
dent Affairs and Graduate Studies.
