# Student Conduct Legislative Council

♦ Jon Adelstein
Major: Political Science and History
Offices Held: Lewis & Clark College ASLC Senator,
1980-82; Stanford: ASSU Senator, 1983-84; Member,
Administration & Rules Committee; Member, Stu
dent Affairs Committee; Winter 1984-present: Guest
Professorship Board, ex-officio; Honor Code Com
mission, ex-officio; Executive Board, Hillel; Mem
ber, Student Conduct Legislative Council
There is currently a blatant discrepancy between
student practices and rules governing student con
duct. The Honor Code declares that students are
obligated to turn in other students who they
encounter violating the Honor Code. Every student
who enters Stanford obliges himself to do so, a re
sponsibility he affirms each time he signs a blue
book. A 1977 survey revealed that 90% of Stanford
students, faced with evidence of infringement,
would be unwilling to turn in another person. Vet
they sign their names, swearing they will. The Honor
Code should be made consistent with student
practices and preferences.
♦ Arthur M. Keller
Major: PhD candidate in Computer Science
Offices Held: Honor Code Commission (1 year)
The Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC)
collectively defines misconduct and appropriate
penalties. The SCLC does not, however, adjudicate
cases or assign specific penalties. The SCLC is cur
rently performing a major review of the Honor
Code.

At my initiative, the HCC will administer during
spring quarter a survey of student opinion on a vari
ety of topics on the Honor Code. I am working with
the SCLC and C-15 (Committee of 15) to review
these surveys so they will assist in the Honor Code
revision. Based on prior surveys and commentary I
have read, these are the major issues regarding the
Honor Code. Proctoring by faculty is prohibited by
the Honor Code, yet it takes place. Penalty grading
should be regulated or prohibited. The cheating in
courses involving computers needs to be addressed
by SCLC legislation based on the needs and desires
of students, faculty, and administrators.

Major: Computer Science Department, MS
Offices Held: Member, Student Conduct Legislative
Council (83-84); Member, ASSU-Tresidder Task
Force on Tresidder Renovation (84); ASSU Graduate
Senator (81-84); Member, Committee on Contem
porary Entertainment (83-84); Senate Liaison, ASSU
Publications Board (83-84); Member, ASSU Senate
Appropriations Committee (83-84); Chair, ASSU
Senate Graduate Education and Research Commit
tee (82-84); Member, Concert Committee (83); Sen
ate Liaison, University Steering Group on CATV (83);
Member and Chair, ASSU Senate Administration
and Rules Committee (81-83); Member, Tresidder
Union Board (82-83); Member, Task Group on
Housing Rate Equity (82); Member, University Com
mittee on Computing and Information Technology
(80-81); Member, ASSU Publications Board (78-80);
Member, Subcommittee on the Evaluation and Im
provement of Teaching (77-79)
This year the SCLC has already tackled such diffi
cult topics as proctoring and penalty grading. It has
also taken a more active role in ensuring that admi
nistrators, who are primarily concerned with smooth
administration, do not violate the rights of individual
students when applying the sanctions provided by
the Fundamental Standard.
The SCLC should not lapse into dormancy as it has
done so often in the past. Issues arising from con
cerns over professional misconduct (i.e. "Mosher"

cases) and administrative abuse of the Fundamental
Standard (i.e. "Zete" cases) still remain to be ad
dressed. I believe I can help address them.
♦ Mark Soble
Major: Economics
Offices Held: ASSU Senator; Administration and
Rules Committee; Undergraduate and Residential
Education Committee; Committee on Committees;
Treasurer, The Lagunita Players; President, Stanford
Chess Guild; KZSU Sportscaster; Daily columnist
Most students are unaware of the purpose of the
SCLC: to draw up and push for improvements in
honor code and fundamental standard legislation.
I think of myself as a person of integrity. I respect
people who deal with others fairly and honestly. I
hope and assume that you feel the same about your
self. My inference is drawn from the fact that when
you entered this university you signed a statement
indicating that you recognized and agreed with the
fundamental standard.
GO AHEAD, MAKE MV DAY. Elect Mark Soble to
SCLC.
♦ Adam J. Wand
Major: Economics, Psychology
The duties of a Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cilor consist of upholding and upgrading the in
tegrity (moral and otherwise) of the regulations
governing student conduct, in accordance with the
spirit of these rules, and the conscience of the Stan
ford community.
Among the issues the SCLC should concern itself
with is that of the Honor Code. Since the question ot
exactly what the Honor Code stipulates is often at
hand (for individuals as well as the Legislature), I feel
this issue deserves attention. The SCLC should seek
to clarify the terms of the Honor Code, in addition to
those of other regulations governing student con
duct. Clarity and unequivocality are the keys to
viable and operational legislation at Stanford, and it
is the job of the SCLC to fulfill these requisites.

student practices and rules governing student con
duct. The Honor Code declares that students are
obligated to turn in other students who they
encounter violating the Honor Code. Every student
who enters Stanford obliges himself to do so, a re
sponsibility he affirms each time he signs a blue
book. A 1977 survey revealed that 90% of Stanford
students, faced with evidence of infringement,
would be unwilling to turn in another person. Vet
they sign their names, swearing they will. The Honor
Code should be made consistent with student
practices and preferences.

The Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC)
collectively defines misconduct and appropriate
penalties. The SCLC does not, however, adjudicate
cases or assign specific penalties. The SCLC is cur
rently performing a major review of the Honor
Code.

At my initiative, the HCC will administer during
spring quarter a survey of student opinion on a vari
ety of topics on the Honor Code. I am working with
the SCLC and C-15 (Committee of 15) to review
these surveys so they will assist in the Honor Code
revision. Based on prior surveys and commentary I
have read, these are the major issues regarding the
Honor Code. Proctoring by faculty is prohibited by
the Honor Code, yet it takes place. Penalty grading
should be regulated or prohibited. The cheating in
courses involving computers needs to be addressed
by SCLC legislation based on the needs and desires
of students, faculty, and administrators.

This year the SCLC has already tackled such diffi
cult topics as proctoring and penalty grading. It has
also taken a more active role in ensuring that admi
nistrators, who are primarily concerned with smooth
administration, do not violate the rights of individual
students when applying the sanctions provided by
the Fundamental Standard.
The SCLC should not lapse into dormancy as it has
done so often in the past. Issues arising from con
cerns over professional misconduct (i.e. "Mosher"

cases) and administrative abuse of the Fundamental
Standard (i.e. "Zete" cases) still remain to be ad
dressed. I believe I can help address them.

Most students are unaware of the purpose of the
SCLC: to draw up and push for improvements in
honor code and fundamental standard legislation.
I think of myself as a person of integrity. I respect
people who deal with others fairly and honestly. I
hope and assume that you feel the same about your
self. My inference is drawn from the fact that when
you entered this university you signed a statement
indicating that you recognized and agreed with the
fundamental standard.
GO AHEAD, MAKE MV DAY. Elect Mark Soble to
SCLC.

The duties of a Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cilor consist of upholding and upgrading the in
tegrity (moral and otherwise) of the regulations
governing student conduct, in accordance with the
spirit of these rules, and the conscience of the Stan
ford community.
Among the issues the SCLC should concern itself
with is that of the Honor Code. Since the question ot
exactly what the Honor Code stipulates is often at
hand (for individuals as well as the Legislature), I feel
this issue deserves attention. The SCLC should seek
to clarify the terms of the Honor Code, in addition to
those of other regulations governing student con
duct. Clarity and unequivocality are the keys to
viable and operational legislation at Stanford, and it
is the job of the SCLC to fulfill these requisites.
