As your Senior Class Presidents we accept the
awesome responsibilities that come with the job.
We realize the immense potential and influence we
have on the policies and direction of Leland Stan
ford Junior University. Should we be called upon to
do something of real importance, we will be sure to
delegate responsibilities to the proper authorities.
There are several things that this University is lack
ing that we intend to make up for. For starters, Kris
tin doesn't like those old blue and gold bear paw
prints around the bookstore and claw. We've
decided it is time to put together an underclassmen
task force and paint them red. Another weak dimen
sion is the fact that eighty percent of the student
body thinks "All Right Now" is our alma mater. It is

not. We need to let people know this. Another
thing, it's time someone should let those, like Mark
Epstein, know what is and is not a worthwhile thing
for an elected official to do. John wanted to intro
duce the rest of the senior class to Kristin.
Doug Grove: "I just got a fifty-two dollar parking
ticket for parking in a handicapped zone. Obviously
they're wrong."
Kristin Hepler: "People keep walking up to me
and saying, 'Who are you?' "
Allyson Brown: "I turned down my Dolly invita
tion down. I date Andy."
John Powell: "People never come up to me and
say 'Who are you?' they just ask 'Why?' "
"We're running as the rest of the senior class."

A ONE HORSE OPEN SLATE foresees a mag
nificent Senior year. We hope to integrate social and
educational ideas, provide a tantalizing variety of ac
tivities, promote student-faculty interaction, act as
liaisons between students and administrators, and
recruit an energetic core. We are four motivated,
fun-loving creatures, committed to beginning some
unorthodox class of '85 traditions, as well as expand

ing on existing programs. We're thinking . . . Senior
"Froshbook" . . . Spring rafting trip . . . Senior
faculty tailgaters . . . roadtrip to wine festival . . .
Futures Fair (careers and beyond) . . . All-class field
day (Seniors win) . . . informal Senior seminars on
resume writing and scalp massage . . . Tasty Pub
Nights, from A-Acapulco's to Z-Zotts . . . Senior
newsletter . . . WHOAA! (and that's just our first
week).
In addition, we want to create opportunities for
smaller get-togethers where Seniors can share ideas
and experiences, and display talents before saying
arrivederci at the graduation sight of our choice. A
class with 11 slates obviously has unbridled enthusi
asm, and with A ONE HORSE OPEN SLATE pulling
the reins, we could have a helluva time!
A ONE HORSE OPEN SLATE — we're prepared to
go over the river and through the woods for you.

We of the JALE Slate recognize our responsibility
to provide the Senior Class with social and practical
enrichment. In addition, we understand our need to
address such important Senior matters as Com
mencement. Our individual skills and backgrounds
allow us, as a group, to meet these important re
sponsibilities.
The Senior Class presidents serve as social chair
persons for the Senior class. To supplement already
existing activities, we aim to begin a shuttle bus ser
vice using Marguerite for Senior Pub Nights. In addi

tion, a "Rent-a-Senior" program for Full-Moon-in
the-Quad would add social variety, as would a
Senior party in the City.
To aid Seniors' practical pursuits, we would invite
successful alumni to speak to small groups of
Seniors about their success in the business world.
This would not only provide us with ideas, but it
would also give us valuable connections.
On the matter of Commencement, we would
serve as liaisons between the class and the adminis
tration. We aim to set up forums with members of
both the university administration and the Senior
Class in order to avoid the problems that have faced
previous Senior Classes.
We are ready to assume the responsibility of Class
presidency. We have experience in government,
and we are from diverse segments of the Stanford
community. We can effectively represent your inter
ests.

Duties of the Senior Class Presidents in our
opinion are: to promote the spirit of the class and of
the individual seniors; to provide a bond between
the individual seniors and form a more cohesive,
less-cliquish senior class; to represent the class of

1985 the best we can; to uphold the tradition of
Senior Pub Night and explore new dimensions
beyond one's inhibition; to provide every senior "a
ride of his/her life."
The issues we see important to the senior class are
the individual senior's perception of the class and
his place in it, and meeting the expectations of every
senior's idea of the senior year. We shall endeavor
to provide solutions to these issues without being
too pushy or overly exuberant. •
We wish to serve, represent the senior class. We
feel we are a well-balanced slate formed with well
balanced individuals, whose intentions are good
and who are willing.
