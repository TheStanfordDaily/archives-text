As your Senior Class Presidents we accept the
awesome responsibilities that come with the job.
We realize the immense potential and influence we
have on the policies and direction of Leland Stan
ford Junior University. Should we be called upon to
do something of real importance, we will be sure to
delegate responsibilities to the proper authorities.
There are several things that this University is lack
ing that we intend to make up for. For starters, Kris
tin doesn't like those old blue and gold bear paw
prints around the bookstore and claw. We've
decided it is time to put together an underclassmen
task force and paint them red. Another weak dimen
sion is the fact that eighty percent of the student
body thinks "All Right Now" is our alma mater. It is

not. We need to let people know this. Another
thing, it's time someone should let those, like Mark
Epstein, know what is and is not a worthwhile thing
for an elected official to do. John wanted to intro
duce the rest of the senior class to Kristin.
Doug Grove: "I just got a fifty-two dollar parking
ticket for parking in a handicapped zone. Obviously
they're wrong."
Kristin Hepler: "People keep walking up to me
and saying, 'Who are you?' "
Allyson Brown: "I turned down my Dolly invita
tion down. I date Andy."
John Powell: "People never come up to me and
say 'Who are you?' they just ask 'Why?' "
"We're running as the rest of the senior class."

A ONE HORSE OPEN SLATE foresees a mag
nificent Senior year. We hope to integrate social and
educational ideas, provide a tantalizing variety of ac
tivities, promote student-faculty interaction, act as
liaisons between students and administrators, and
recruit an energetic core. We are four motivated,
fun-loving creatures, committed to beginning some
unorthodox class of '85 traditions, as well as expand

ing on existing programs. We're thinking . . . Senior
"Froshbook" . . . Spring rafting trip . . . Senior
faculty tailgaters . . . roadtrip to wine festival . . .
Futures Fair (careers and beyond) . . . All-class field
day (Seniors win) . . . informal Senior seminars on
resume writing and scalp massage . . . Tasty Pub
Nights, from A-Acapulco's to Z-Zotts . . . Senior
newsletter . . . WHOAA! (and that's just our first
week).
In addition, we want to create opportunities for
smaller get-togethers where Seniors can share ideas
and experiences, and display talents before saying
arrivederci at the graduation sight of our choice. A
class with 11 slates obviously has unbridled enthusi
asm, and with A ONE HORSE OPEN SLATE pulling
the reins, we could have a helluva time!
A ONE HORSE OPEN SLATE — we're prepared to
go over the river and through the woods for you.

We of the JALE Slate recognize our responsibility
to provide the Senior Class with social and practical
enrichment. In addition, we understand our need to
address such important Senior matters as Com
mencement. Our individual skills and backgrounds
allow us, as a group, to meet these important re
sponsibilities.
The Senior Class presidents serve as social chair
persons for the Senior class. To supplement already
existing activities, we aim to begin a shuttle bus ser
vice using Marguerite for Senior Pub Nights. In addi

tion, a "Rent-a-Senior" program for Full-Moon-in
the-Quad would add social variety, as would a
Senior party in the City.
To aid Seniors' practical pursuits, we would invite
successful alumni to speak to small groups of
Seniors about their success in the business world.
This would not only provide us with ideas, but it
would also give us valuable connections.
On the matter of Commencement, we would
serve as liaisons between the class and the adminis
tration. We aim to set up forums with members of
both the university administration and the Senior
Class in order to avoid the problems that have faced
previous Senior Classes.
We are ready to assume the responsibility of Class
presidency. We have experience in government,
and we are from diverse segments of the Stanford
community. We can effectively represent your inter
ests.

Duties of the Senior Class Presidents in our
opinion are: to promote the spirit of the class and of
the individual seniors; to provide a bond between
the individual seniors and form a more cohesive,
less-cliquish senior class; to represent the class of

1985 the best we can; to uphold the tradition of
Senior Pub Night and explore new dimensions
beyond one's inhibition; to provide every senior "a
ride of his/her life."
The issues we see important to the senior class are
the individual senior's perception of the class and
his place in it, and meeting the expectations of every
senior's idea of the senior year. We shall endeavor
to provide solutions to these issues without being
too pushy or overly exuberant. •
We wish to serve, represent the senior class. We
feel we are a well-balanced slate formed with well
balanced individuals, whose intentions are good
and who are willing.

Why are we running for Senior Class President?
It's simple — because we want to do it. That's it. It's
a chance to make our senior year the best possible.
From planning graduation and maintaining alumni
contacts, to providing senior social events, we can
do a great job.
We feel the major commitment of the Senior Class
President is to increase social interaction on as many
levels as possible. Senior Pub Nights, our weekly

blow-off times, are a blast, but how about a
Senior/Faculty Pub Night? What a great way to meet
professors and get a better perspective on life-after-
Stanford (Yes! It does exist!). Informal gatherings
with guest speakers, drive-in parties, and senior
Frisbee-Golf tournaments are great ways to meet
people. Let's face it, there's a lot more to Stanford
than academics, and we'd like to provide the oppor
tunity for the senior class to enjoy it.
No other group will work as well together, devote
as much time, or have as much fun as we will. Each is
involved in a different aspect of Stanford life, which
gives the group a good, overall viewpoint. We have
a serious commitment to a good time! You'll want to
stay for a fifth year. Vote the "Slate."

We're confident that we have the RIGHT stuff to
make our senior year great! We've planned just the
RIGHT combination of programs to promote class
unity, to provide for student-faculty interaction and
to bring seniors and alumni together. The RIGHT
SLATE's proposals for next year include: Good
Times: Big Game Weekend Extravaganza (Rally Bus

and Hotel Suite in the City); Cardinal Caravan to
U.C.L.A.; Senior Happy Hours at the Dish;
Masquerade Ball/Boat Dance; Faculty-Student Field
Day. Educational Events: "Life After Stanford"
Lecture Series; Career Counseling Seminars. Senior
Traditions: Senior Pub Nights; Senior Tailgaters;
Spring Formal; Senior Casino Night; Student-
Alumni Brunch Program.
These are just a few of the activities that we have
planned for 1985. We're dedicated, hard working
and responsible, and have come up with the RIGHT
ideas for raising funds to support these events.
We're excited about the prospect of working for and
with the senior class to make 1985 a truly unforget
table year!
All RIGHT Now . . . With the Class of '85.

The Senior Class Presidents shouldn't be iden
tifiable as the most high profile students; rather the
most representative and accessible. Their duties
consist of representing the members of the class and
initiating activities promoting involvement and
unity. Excitement turns to disenchantment as hard
work begins to take it's toll. Dedication turns to ac
tion; you won't see an overabundance of exclama
tion points(!) in our statement.

The most important issue for our class is not to
regard senior year as the "end". To avoid this, we
will provide opportunities to meet classmates, and
to make contacts that will last. We're starting off
with "Senior Disorientation Week" consisting of
sherry hours with professors and alumni, pub nights
and a field day. Other activities include on-campus,
inexpensive, non-alcoholic gatherings, class picnics,
trisbee golf tournaments, gambling nights. We plan
to put together a senior book with majors, home ad
dresses and interests. We will work with Stanford
Alumni Network to provide seniors with common
interests an alumni advisor.
Though we aren't claiming to be your fairy god
parents, turning PTRs into job offers, we can and will
do a lot for our class. The overall goal is acquainting
and reacquainting our members with professors, ad
ministration, alumni and most importantly our
selves. We don't mean to sound like approaching
Stanford all over again . . . just voting CLEAN SLATE.

Right from the beginning we want to SHAKE things
up -r get off to a quick start. Too often activities are
concentrated in Spring. We'd like to be PREPARED

for THE FALL. That means having an immediate
awareness of the Senior Class needs, and choosing a
competent and diverse core group to assist in deci
sions from the start. We won't FALL SHORT OF THE
LINE. We're not running by deFAULT!
The issues of unification and participation are im
portant. That's what distinguishes one class from the
next. Be prepared for fantastic pub nights, a wild
Mausoleum party, and the traditional senior casino
night. Get some sleep now for a BACK TO THE FARM
BARN PARTY and the SO CAL FOOTBALL WEEKEND!
Its your Senior year and you still haven't met Presi
dent Kennedy? Why not a Senior "I missed the Frosh
reception" with the President and a Senior "FROSH
BOOK" elaborated upon.
Our greatest strength is that we have proven to
work well together. Cohesive leadership is most im
portant. We feel that energetic leadership can draw
upon the whole class as a resource for innovative
and fun events. That's half the game, the other half
is getting started early!

The Senior Class Presidents are responsible for in
voking spirit and participation among the senior
class, communicating with those dispersed through
out campus as well as off campus, acting as a liaison
between the senior class and university administra
tion, and maintaining responsible control over the
senior class budget. Our prior activities at Stanford
have demonstrated our ability to effectively deal in

these four areas. As Senior Class Presidents, we
would continue the traditional pub nights, Casino
Night, and Mausoleum party. While in Florence this
quarter, we are generating new ideas to comple
ment and enhance these activities:
• We think that bars are getting the advantage of
our business at Pub Nights without giving up
anything in return. With better organization, we
could get discounts on drinks, have raffles and
door prizes, and raise overall participation in the
Senior Pub Night schedule.
• Let's start the year with a bang at a deGuerre pool
party and barbeque, and rejuvenate the Quad/Full
Moon tradition through increased publicity.
• We would like to organize a Tahoe/Reno trip early
in winter quarter and a Senior Boat Dance on San
Francisco Bay during the spring.
We feel that our experience and ideas coupled
with our ability to work together make us very
qualified for this position.
VIVA GELATO!
