We know, we know; it's been said before, many
times, many ways. But we're here to say it again.
Stanford has been unknowing, unsuspecting long
enough. We are here to strip away the gauze of con
spiracy and bathe you in the shifting sands of truth.
Are you willing to face up to the facts of GRAVE
ROBBERS FROM SPACE?

No? Neither are they, our esteemed C.O.P. oppo
nents. They'll delude, bemuse and beguile you with
withering words on food service, elections
processes and student rights. Right. They just don't
want to admit it. They've been briefed by the
powers-that-be. They know what we know.
VISITORS FROM SPACE! That's what this election is
all about and our opponents refuse to acknowledge
this. How can they be so BLIND? Look, it's not that
they are short-sighted. Far from it. They would be vi
sionary student leaders were conditions different. A
shadow of doom hangs over our fair campus like a
cloud of death. We cannot afford to ignore it.
STILL NOT CONVINCED? The evidence lies about
you. Stop. Look. Listen. Still think the Dish is for
communicating with man-made satellites orbiting
the earth? Still think the Oval is merely Arnold Pal
mer's favorite golfing wet dream — that of the
world's largest putting green? NO! Face the truth —

you can pick up radio stations from as far away as
San Francisco or San Jose. But, have you ever heard
anything from the Dish? That's because it's not
broadcasting on OUR wavelengths. Only the aliens
can hear it. Ever see the Oval from the air? Its prox
imity to the San Andreas fault is no mistake. Leland
Stanford Sr. and architect Fredrick Law Olmstead
were controlled by space aliens. They put the Oval
where it is today, near one of the weakest points in
the crust of the earth, to serve as a TARGET. George
Lucas showed us the fate of our globe when the
DEATH STAR blew up that planet in "Star Wars."
The coincidences are too noteworthy to be ignored.
What can you do, what can you do? Vote for the
Hammer and Coffin Slate. Unafraid, uncontrollable,
unpredictable, unabridged. We won't give you a
bum steer. Why should we? Our opponents are
hamburger enough. Heigh-ho.
