We know, we know; it's been said before, many
times, many ways. But we're here to say it again.
Stanford has been unknowing, unsuspecting long
enough. We are here to strip away the gauze of con
spiracy and bathe you in the shifting sands of truth.
Are you willing to face up to the facts of GRAVE
ROBBERS FROM SPACE?

No? Neither are they, our esteemed C.O.P. oppo
nents. They'll delude, bemuse and beguile you with
withering words on food service, elections
processes and student rights. Right. They just don't
want to admit it. They've been briefed by the
powers-that-be. They know what we know.
VISITORS FROM SPACE! That's what this election is
all about and our opponents refuse to acknowledge
this. How can they be so BLIND? Look, it's not that
they are short-sighted. Far from it. They would be vi
sionary student leaders were conditions different. A
shadow of doom hangs over our fair campus like a
cloud of death. We cannot afford to ignore it.
STILL NOT CONVINCED? The evidence lies about
you. Stop. Look. Listen. Still think the Dish is for
communicating with man-made satellites orbiting
the earth? Still think the Oval is merely Arnold Pal
mer's favorite golfing wet dream — that of the
world's largest putting green? NO! Face the truth —

you can pick up radio stations from as far away as
San Francisco or San Jose. But, have you ever heard
anything from the Dish? That's because it's not
broadcasting on OUR wavelengths. Only the aliens
can hear it. Ever see the Oval from the air? Its prox
imity to the San Andreas fault is no mistake. Leland
Stanford Sr. and architect Fredrick Law Olmstead
were controlled by space aliens. They put the Oval
where it is today, near one of the weakest points in
the crust of the earth, to serve as a TARGET. George
Lucas showed us the fate of our globe when the
DEATH STAR blew up that planet in "Star Wars."
The coincidences are too noteworthy to be ignored.
What can you do, what can you do? Vote for the
Hammer and Coffin Slate. Unafraid, uncontrollable,
unpredictable, unabridged. We won't give you a
bum steer. Why should we? Our opponents are
hamburger enough. Heigh-ho.

The Steve Miller Band brings a unique combina
tion of effective innovation and responsible admin
istration to the leadership of the Associated
Students. We know that a familiarity with the
workings of the A.S.S.U. is vital for the competent
direction of student government. Vet, we believe
that to properly respond to the full scope of student
concerns a Council of Presidents must blend its
A.S.S.U. background with a strong record of partici
pation in the Stanford community. The issues that
will concern students in the coming year demand
our combination of practical A.S.S.U. experience
and our background in successful functions inde
pendent of the A.S.S.U. Based on this combination
of experiences we have identified specific areas of
concern and introduce the following proposals:
Food Service: To raise the quality of food and create
savings that can be passed on to you we will
lead student participation in the University's
restructuring of the system.
Student Run Food Services: We will create a network
linking Eating Club, row house, and fraternity
food services to combine buying power and
share service information, thus preventing an
other incident such as the closing of the Uni
versity Commissary.
Residential Education: We will expand the Advising
Associates program to cover all freshmen and
transfers.

San Francisco Shuttle Service: We will start a service
to provide students with convenient access to
the City for a nominal fee.
Minority Affairs: To insure better representation for
all minorities we will create a committee to
promote such areas as minority application
recruitment, tenure for minority faculty, and
academic issues such as an Alternative West
ern Culture track.
A.S.S.U. Senate: To increase communication be
tween you and your Senators; especially in
areas outside the current districting system
(the row houses, the suites, and the frater
nities) we will advocate the specific assign
ment of Senators, so that all residents have a
voice in the Senate.
Women's Coordinating Committee: We will actively
assist the Women's Coordinating Committee
in maintaining a women's support network
that confronts such issues as sexual harass
ment, discrimination, and tenure for women
faculty members.
Concert Network: To insure that the newly created
Concert Network will bring popular contem
porary entertainment back to Stanford we will
place the resources and active support behind
this effort.
The C.O.P. is both the day to day management of
A.S.S.U. and a source of creative guidance. Our
unique combination of A.S.S.U. experience and
proven community leadership makes us best
qualified to respond to student concerns with inno
vative solutions. With the Steve Miller Band you get
action, not alliteration.

The Steve Miller Band brings a unique combina
tion of effective innovation and responsible admin
istration to the leadership of the Associated
Students. We know that a familiarity with the
workings of the A.S.S.U. is vital for the competent
direction of student government. Vet, we believe
that to properly respond to the full scope of student
concerns a Council of Presidents must blend its
A.S.S.U. background with a strong record of partici
pation in the Stanford community. The issues that
will concern students in the coming year demand
our combination of practical A.S.S.U. experience
and our background in successful functions inde
pendent of the A.S.S.U. Based on this combination
of experiences we have identified specific areas of
concern and introduce the following proposals:
Food Service: To raise the quality of food and create
savings that can be passed on to you we will
lead student participation in the University's
restructuring of the system.
Student Run Food Services: We will create a network
linking Eating Club, row house, and fraternity
food services to combine buying power and
share service information, thus preventing an
other incident such as the closing of the Uni
versity Commissary.
Residential Education: We will expand the Advising
Associates program to cover all freshmen and
transfers.

San Francisco Shuttle Service: We will start a service
to provide students with convenient access to
the City for a nominal fee.
Minority Affairs: To insure better representation for
all minorities we will create a committee to
promote such areas as minority application
recruitment, tenure for minority faculty, and
academic issues such as an Alternative West
ern Culture track.
A.S.S.U. Senate: To increase communication be
tween you and your Senators; especially in
areas outside the current districting system
(the row houses, the suites, and the frater
nities) we will advocate the specific assign
ment of Senators, so that all residents have a
voice in the Senate.
Women's Coordinating Committee: We will actively
assist the Women's Coordinating Committee
in maintaining a women's support network
that confronts such issues as sexual harass
ment, discrimination, and tenure for women
faculty members.
Concert Network: To insure that the newly created
Concert Network will bring popular contem
porary entertainment back to Stanford we will
place the resources and active support behind
this effort.
The C.O.P. is both the day to day management of
A.S.S.U. and a source of creative guidance. Our
unique combination of A.S.S.U. experience and
proven community leadership makes us best
qualified to respond to student concerns with inno
vative solutions. With the Steve Miller Band you get
action, not alliteration.

We know, we know; it's been said before, many
times, many ways. But we're here to say it again.
Stanford has been unknowing, unsuspecting long
enough. We are here to strip away the gauze of con
spiracy and bathe you in the shifting sands of truth.
Are you willing to face up to the facts of GRAVE
ROBBERS FROM SPACE?

No? Neither are they, our esteemed C.O.P. oppo
nents. They'll delude, bemuse and beguile you with
withering words on food service, elections
processes and student rights. Right. They just don't
want to admit it. They've been briefed by the
powers-that-be. They know what we know.
VISITORS FROM SPACE! That's what this election is
all about and our opponents refuse to acknowledge
this. How can they be so BLIND? Look, it's not that
they are short-sighted. Far from it. They would be vi
sionary student leaders were conditions different. A
shadow of doom hangs over our fair campus like a
cloud of death. We cannot afford to ignore it.
STILL NOT CONVINCED? The evidence lies about
you. Stop. Look. Listen. Still think the Dish is for
communicating with man-made satellites orbiting
the earth? Still think the Oval is merely Arnold Pal
mer's favorite golfing wet dream — that of the
world's largest putting green? NO! Face the truth —

you can pick up radio stations from as far away as
San Francisco or San Jose. But, have you ever heard
anything from the Dish? That's because it's not
broadcasting on OUR wavelengths. Only the aliens
can hear it. Ever see the Oval from the air? Its prox
imity to the San Andreas fault is no mistake. Leland
Stanford Sr. and architect Fredrick Law Olmstead
were controlled by space aliens. They put the Oval
where it is today, near one of the weakest points in
the crust of the earth, to serve as a TARGET. George
Lucas showed us the fate of our globe when the
DEATH STAR blew up that planet in "Star Wars."
The coincidences are too noteworthy to be ignored.
What can you do, what can you do? Vote for the
Hammer and Coffin Slate. Unafraid, uncontrollable,
unpredictable, unabridged. We won't give you a
bum steer. Why should we? Our opponents are
hamburger enough. Heigh-ho.
