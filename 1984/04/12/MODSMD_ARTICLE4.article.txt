# Legalized prostitution discussed

### SHEILA MANKANI 
"It is essential for women to have
control over their own bodies . . . and
1 think it's essential for prostitutes to
have the light to say yes to the money,
yes to the sex." a former prostitute
said here last night.
Margo St. James, founder of Call
Off Your Old Tired Ethics
(COYOTE), an organization favoring
legalized prostitution, told a Kresge
Auditorium audience of about 100
that "women's sexuality can be com
mercialized to the nth degree" under
existing laws that allow pornography
but prohibit prostitution. She was
opposed in the discussion by Bernard
Walters of the San Francisco district
attorney's office.
St. James claimed that the women's

movement does not involve itself with
the issue of prostitution because wo
men tear the "whore" label. The
whole point of prohibiting prostitution
is to "intimidate women," she said.
The current system that permits in
dividuals as young as 18-years-old to
work in massage parlors and be es
corts already constitutes de facto pros
titution. St. James said. In contrast,
actual prostitutes cannot be granted
licenses. Together, these laws are self
defeating because they encourage
prostitution among young people, she
said.
Legalizing prostitution would also
decrease its dangers. St. James said.
She explained that laws condemning
prostitution promote violence against
prostitutes.

"You don't see serial murders in
other countries that regulate and
legitimize prostitutes' work and
protect them from exploitation instead
of setting them up." she said.
Lesbian, abortion and prostitutes'
rights are the tripod of a power base
for women. St. James said. If part of
that tripod is not talked about, the
whole apparatus will fall.
"If you don't have the right to be a
prostitute, you don't have the right not
to be one — and that whore label will
be used to intimidate women forever,"
she said.
Walters argued that prostitution
causes the "fracturing of identity" and
the "disintegration of personality."
While it is sometimes called
"victimless crime." Walters asserted
that "the most tragic victim of pros
titution is the prostitute herself."
Me criti/ed legalized prostitution as
it exists in parts of Nevada. Because
prostitution in these areas has been
centralized into brothels, organized
crime has been able to more easilv ob

tain profits.
"When prostitution is illegal, organ
ized crime can't control and monitor
the acti\ itics of prostitutes." he said.
He added that the centralization of
the brothel system confines prostitutes
to limited areas. But when allowed to
work without such restrictions, pros
titutes are able to retain more of their
earnings.
For Walters, "the question is not
how to abolish" prostitution, but
"how to address it in the social con
text."
