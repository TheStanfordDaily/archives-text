PEOPLE
Minority Issues: We will work with the minority com
munity to foster the recruitment of minority stu
dents, faculty and staff. The enhancement of theme
houses and the role they play on campus is another
critical issue.
Graduate Students: We will emphasize the need for
more graduate student input within the ASSU and
the University with a particular focus placed on
problems such as graduate housing and Ph.D.
residency requirements.
Women's Issues: Our goal is to facilitate networking
of different women's groups to provide a forum for
issues of interest to women.
PROJECTS
"Quality of Life": Is the Stanford student experience
the best it can be? If not, then how can it be im
proved? By years end we plan to present a compre
hensive evaluation of graduate and undergraduate
student life. Issues to be incorporated are: Housing
(availability, programming, and quality); academic
opportunities (faculty-student interaction, advising,
and quality of instruction); and opportunities for so
cial interaction. We plan to utilize existing University
committees in addition to creating new student di
rected task forces to consider these issues. Our goal
is to provide the administration with an understand

ing of student needs and concerns as well as provide
a launching point for any future changes.
Student Organizations: Our goals are threefold: 1) a
concerted push for a University commitment to
begin construction of student office space; 2) the
creation of a Speakers Council which would coor
dinate the efforts of all organizations interested in
sponsoring speakers, and 3) the simplification of the
current funding process through the coordination of
ASSU and University allocation procedures.
Food Service: We feel fee-for-service is the most
responsive system to student needs. By reconstitut
ing a new Food Service Task Force we will encourage
University policy changes to improve and imple
ment this system campus-wide.
Coffee House: It is imperative the ASSU renew and
maintain the Coffee House contract this year. Stu
dents must play the critical role in designing the
new, relocated Coffee House.
Community Service: In conjunction with the CSC we
plan to use ASSU resources to promote and coor
dinate community service opportunities for stu
dents, faculty, and staff.
PARTICIPATION
The word "participation" embodies our
philosophy of student government. We will actively
encourage students — graduates and undergradu
ates — to contribute their resources and opinions to
the ASSU through internships, individual projects,
committees, and task forces. In person we're much
less intense than our outlined issues suggest. Give
us a call or flag us down if you have any comments
or questions.
