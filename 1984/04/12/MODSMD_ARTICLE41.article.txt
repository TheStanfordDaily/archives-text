TOTAL Special Fee Requests $533,333 $13.93

Explanation
The above table lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee on the
ballot, and indicates the amount that each fee would contribute to the quarterly
total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quarters; the
Summer quarter fee would be half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as "$l.OO per person per quarter" would result in
the collection of $1.00 during each of the first three quarters of the year, and of
$0.50 during the Summer quarter. (The actual collection schedule for each fee will
be determined after the election.) These estimates are based on the assumption
that enrollment will be the same in 1984-85 as was projected in 1983-84.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the Asso
ciation Fee or surcharges which will also be collected. The estimated amounts for
these are shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will be set by the
ASSU Senate on April 10; the amount of the surcharges will be determined after
the election. The surcharges cover the costs of the election, administering the
refund system, and other fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
