# ASSU LEGAL COUNSELING
## 
### 
Sponsor: Karol Watson
Originally formed in 1973 and funded each quarter by the Special Fee Assess
ment, the ASSU Legal Counseling Office provides legal advice to registered stu
dents and their spouses. Confidential counseling is conducted on an appoint
ment basis with a practicing attorney who may write letters and make telephone
calls in the course of helping a student resolve a legal problem. The attorney will
also help students set up their cases properly if they wish to go to Small Claims
Court.
Student legal problems of every description are handled by the LCO. The most
frequent problems arise in the areas of landlord/tenant disputes, car repair,
family-law, wills, starting a business, criminal law (from traffic violations to more
serious charges), car and bike accidents, and consumer problems of all types.
Due to time and budget constraints the LCO lawyers do not personally repre
sent students in lawsuits. They do, however, provide a referral service for any stu
dent needing such representation. Involvement in University-related disputes is
also beyond the scope of the LCO. Such cases are referred to the University Om
budsman.
At least 8% of the student body each year uses the service and user response to
the service is overwhelmingly favorable. Historically, the LCO percentage of NO
votes is one of, if not the, lowest for those groups on the ballot. In addition, the
office returns the least amount of money in assessment refunds.
Those students who request the return of their Special Fee Assessment are not
allowed to use the service and must sign a waiver indicating recognition of such
denial.
