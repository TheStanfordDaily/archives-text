# ASSU Speakers Bureau
## 
### 
Sponsor: Jeff Sims
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers from a variety of professions including politics, literature, music
theatre, art, and other areas. By allowing members of the Stanford community to
hear from and to meet contemporary artists and important political figures, it pro
vides a valuable educational experience. Also, the Speakers Bureau has often
been instrumental in helping independent student organizations to bring
speakers to campus.
Last year, the Speakers Bureau Special Fee Request did not qualify for the bal
lot, and so during 1983-1984 the Speakers Bureau had highly limited resources and
had to operate within very circumscribed limits. However, it did manage to bring
or help bring Ken Kesey, Ralph Nader, Alan Cranston, John Anderson and Donald
Justice, among others.
But in order for the Speakers Bureau to fulfill its potential as a sponsor of major
events, it is essential that its budget be reinstated at an amount comparable to
past years, when speakers such as Raymond Carver, Susan Sontag, Ray Bradbury,
Tillie Olsen, Jeremy Rifkin and Gary Hart spoke here.
Next year, Speakers Bureau hopes to sponsor speaking engagements by the
major presidential candidates, candidates for other offices and others important
to the November election. For winter quarter we are planning a writers series as
well as other speakers.
We are seeking to involve a greater number of undergraduates, graduates and
faculty directly in our programs in order to continue our success in bringing
prominent speakers to Stanford.

We are seeking to involve a greater number of undergraduates, graduates and
faculty directly in our programs in order to continue our success in bringing
prominent speakers to Stanford.

The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers from a variety of professions including politics, literature, music
theatre, art, and other areas. By allowing members of the Stanford community to
hear from and to meet contemporary artists and important political figures, it pro
vides a valuable educational experience. Also, the Speakers Bureau has often
been instrumental in helping independent student organizations to bring
speakers to campus.
Last year, the Speakers Bureau Special Fee Request did not qualify for the bal
lot, and so during 1983-1984 the Speakers Bureau had highly limited resources and
had to operate within very circumscribed limits. However, it did manage to bring
or help bring Ken Kesey, Ralph Nader, Alan Cranston, John Anderson and Donald
Justice, among others.
But in order for the Speakers Bureau to fulfill its potential as a sponsor of major
events, it is essential that its budget be reinstated at an amount comparable to
past years, when speakers such as Raymond Carver, Susan Sontag, Ray Bradbury,
Tillie Olsen, Jeremy Rifkin and Gary Hart spoke here.
Next year, Speakers Bureau hopes to sponsor speaking engagements by the
major presidential candidates, candidates for other offices and others important
to the November election. For winter quarter we are planning a writers series as
well as other speakers.
We are seeking to involve a greater number of undergraduates, graduates and
faculty directly in our programs in order to continue our success in bringing
prominent speakers to Stanford.
