The Black Student Union was formed at Stanford as a representative organiza
tion designed to protect and serve Black students here and to garner a firm and
positive commitment from the University toward admissions, the hiring of Black
faculty and staff, and the development of courses and services responsive to Black
students.
To meet these ends, the BSU has fought hard to obtain the Department of
African and Afro-American Studies, Ujamaa the Black cultural center, and the
Black Community Services Center. In addition to these gains, the BSU has worked
hard to influence the hiring of more Black Faculty and Staff as well as recruitment
of more Black students.
To obtain the goals which the BSU has set for itself in the coming years we have
planned certain events and programs which will address different political, social,
and cultural concerns. Some of the annual events which we plan to continue are
the Celebration, the Soul Food Dinner, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Noon
Rally and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
In addition to these various programs we will also be publishing a BSU Bro
chure which will be mailed to every Black student in order to facilitate more com
munity knowledge of BSU programs. We have also committed ourselves to the
greater campus-wide communication which can only be achieved through an ef
fective publicity campaign for our major programs and meetings.

The Black Student Union was formed at Stanford as a representative organiza
tion designed to protect and serve Black students here and to garner a firm and
positive commitment from the University toward admissions, the hiring of Black
faculty and staff, and the development of courses and services responsive to Black
students.
To meet these ends, the BSU has fought hard to obtain the Department of
African and Afro-American Studies, Ujamaa the Black cultural center, and the
Black Community Services Center. In addition to these gains, the BSU has worked
hard to influence the hiring of more Black Faculty and Staff as well as recruitment
of more Black students.
To obtain the goals which the BSU has set for itself in the coming years we have
planned certain events and programs which will address different political, social,
and cultural concerns. Some of the annual events which we plan to continue are
the Celebration, the Soul Food Dinner, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Noon
Rally and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
In addition to these various programs we will also be publishing a BSU Bro
chure which will be mailed to every Black student in order to facilitate more com
munity knowledge of BSU programs. We have also committed ourselves to the
greater campus-wide communication which can only be achieved through an ef
fective publicity campaign for our major programs and meetings.
