Sponsor: May Braselton
The Club Sports Program is coeducational and exists to provide additional op
portunities in competition, instruction, and recreation for undergraduates,
graduates, faculty, and staff in an array of sports which are not funded through
the other areas of the Stanford Athletic Department. With the emphasis on stu
dent initiative in competition, performance and in team management as well, the
Club Program provides participants the opportunity to shape their own experi
ence to a much greater degree than any other program in the Athletic Depart
ment.
The enthusiasm and team pride engendered by this environment are reflected
by the fact that well over 1700 people currently take part in one or more of the 31
club sports.
The Club Council, made up of one student representative from each club,
decides the activities to be undertaken and the policies to be followed in the or
ganization of the Program. The Club Sports President presides over the Council
meetings and heads the budget and steering committees. The Club Sports Direc
tor, a full-time administrator paid by the Athletic Department serves as advisor,
and oversees all operations.
The Club Council uses its funds to help clubs meet general programming ex
penses such as facility and travel costs, essential non-personal equipment uni
forms, and administrative expenses.
