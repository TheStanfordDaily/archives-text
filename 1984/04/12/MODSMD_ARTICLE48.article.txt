The Concert Network is dedicated to bringing contemporary entertainment
back to the Stanford campus. This one time only fee assessment will give the Con
cert Network the funds to begin concert promotion on campus. The amount of
the fee will be the limit of the funds that we can risk at any one time. We will not
be asking for a fee assessment again. We are going to provide the Stanford com
munity with various popular entertainment, ranging from rock to jazz to folk. Our
concerts will have student discounts, so that popular entertainment will not be
very expensive for the Stanford student. The groups that will come to Stanford
will be decided by the students. We encourage all students who want to get in
volved in concert promotion to join the Concert Network. We believe that
popular entertainment at Stanford has been lacking for too long. The Concert
Network provides a hands-on educational experience for students in all aspects of
concert promotion, while providing diverse entertainment to the Stanford audi
ence. With the approval of our charter by the Dean of Student Affairs, we will be
the only group that can bring in major artists to the Stanford campus. This will
prevent the students from undercutting each other in bidding for artists. In the
past, promoters would play student groups against each other to get the lowest
cost of promoting concerts at Stanford. The Concert Network will be the voice of
the students in negotiating with these promoters. In this manner, concerts can
become a money-making as well as educational and entertainment venture. We
think we have developed a financially sound organization that will allow the stu
dents and University officials to cooperate to bring artists to Stanford. The Con
cert Network would like to offer popular entertainment to meet the different mu
sical tastes at Stanford. With students participating and attending the concerts, we
can make concerts a regular part of what Stanford has to offer. There will be or
ganizational meetings for the Concert Network. We encourage all students inter
ested in the various aspects of concert promotion to attend.
