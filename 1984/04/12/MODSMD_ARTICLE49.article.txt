# STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION

As a member of the Committee on Contemporary Entertainment (COCE), I feel
its important to point out some areas of concern regarding this fee request. The
new concert system is complex, with its financing the most complicated aspect.
This fee request is designed to insure a financially solvent, student run concert
system. The University would promote concerts on campus even if this fee failed,
but then administrators, not students, would have control over the system. But
passage of this fee does not guarantee a student controlled system. After a long
battle, the University has finally agreed to a Concert Network charter which
p aces fairly firm control in the hands of students. But it is expected that this
charter will be significantly revised next year, and already some administrators ex
pect the Concert Network to lose some of its autonomy from the University at that
In any event, no student run concert system is viable unless it either breaks
even or makes a profit. There have been doubts about the profitability of concerts
ever since the ASSU Special Events lost more than $100,000 in one year. The
budget of the Concert Network projects massive deficits for its first two years of
operation, and it is not at all obvious that it will ever wash away this red ink. If con
certs are not profitably run, then the "endowment" portion of this fee will be
quickly used, and the Concert Network will be back asking for more student
