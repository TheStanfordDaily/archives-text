# Professor cautioned
## Former Justice official says be careful 
### KATHY OLMSTED Daily staff 
The former Justice Department ap
pointee who last summer denounced i
the Reagan administration's commit- I
ment to equal rights for women now ;
has sent a letter to a professor here <
warning him to "be more careful"
about what he says to the press. I
Barbara Honegger, who made >
headlines across the nation last Au- I
gust when she charged that her admin- 1
istration job reviewing discriminatory
federal laws and regulations was a
"sham," said in a March 23 letter to
Psychology and Psychiatry Prof. Karl
Pribram that his statements about her
in the March 1984 issue of OMNI
magazine are libelous.
But Honegger, a Stanford graduate,
says that the letter was only intended
to warn Pribram to "tell the truth" in
future conversations with the press,
and was not a threat to sue him.
Most of the one-page OMNI article
deals with Honegger's general career
and character, and Pribram is quoted
in only one paragraph. Honegger
takes issue with this quote, which con
cerns the reasons for a previous legal
battle between Honegger and
Pribram.
Honegger, who worried her feminist
supporters this fall when newspaper
accounts quoted her as saying a super
natural "source" had told her Reagan
would win the 1980 election, charged
Pribram in 1975 with striking her
several times on the head and back
and breaking her glasses. Honegger
was Pribram's personal secretary at
the time.
In response to the alleged assault,
Honegger filed a civil suit against
Pribram asking $50,000 in damages.
The case was finally settled out of
court in June 197K when University
insurance paid Honegger an $KOOO
settlement.
In February 1976, the University
placed Pribram on two year's proba
tion and cut his salary by $3000 for
one year.
Honegger, who later received a
degree in parapsychology from John
F. Kennedy University in Orinda, also
filed a grievance against Pribram,
seeking a "special channel of commu
nication" to protect secretaries

working for the professor. The griev
ance was denied.
In the disputed OMNI article,
reporter Peter Rondinone quotes
Pribram's reasons for his 1975 anger
at Honegger â€” reasons that Honegger
disputes.
In response to the letter from
Honegger, Pribram said in a prepared
statement, "The letter threatens a
libel action. . . .My comments would
therefore raise the possibility of

having to defend myself against alle
gations made by a person who in the
past has shown the inclination and has
had the leisure and finances to be
litiginous.
"I cannot afford to undertake such a
defense."
Pribram also said in his statement
that the favorable coverage Honegger
received in The Daily in 197 5 also
caused him to be circumspect in bis
comments.
' When tbe members of my labora
tory jointly composed a fetter counter
ing her charges in 1975 \, The Daily
refused to publish the document," he
wrote. "When my lawyer (who never
charged to advise me) and others gave
interviews to Daily reporters, these in
terviews never appeared in print.
"Now I am told The Daily is once
again about to provide a forum for


Karl Pribram
Criticized by Honegger
Honegger under the circumstances
described above, which makes an ade
quate reply impossible."
After Honegger finished her em
ployment with Pribram and the Uni
versity. she worked as a research asso
ciate in parapsychology at the Wash
ington Street Research Center in San
Francisco. Later she worked as a re
searcher at the Hoover Institution for
Martin Anderson.
Honegger was put in charge of a
project reviewing and identifying dis
criminatory laws. But after she found
that no laws were changed as a result
of her efforts, Honegger wrote an
opinion piece to The Washington Post
denouncing the Reagan administra
tion's commitment to equal rights for
women. '
An instant heroine to feminists
across the nation, Honegger's sup
porters became concerned when she
linked her activities to her beliefs in
the occult and the supernatural.
Honegger claimed that she had been
misquoted by the press and sabotaged
by the Reagan administration.
Currently Honegger works for the
Rev. Jesse Jackson's presidential cam
paign.
