The Stanford Daily is the primary vehicle for communicating news and events of
the Stanford area to its 25,000 readers in the local community. The Daily itself is
set as an independent non-profit corporation. The twin objectives of The Stanford
Daily are to produce a high quality student newspaper and to provide an educa
tional experience for those involved in running the newspaper. The Student Fee
Assessment is the money that the students pay each year to fund the production
of the paper. Last year each student paid on average $1.20 in fee assessment per
quarter. With 160 issues per year, the student pays less than .03# per issue. While
advertising makes up most of the revenues for the Daily, we still need the fee as
sessment to help fund the newspaper's typesetting, production, printing and dis
tribution. It is a small price to pay for a valuable community service.
