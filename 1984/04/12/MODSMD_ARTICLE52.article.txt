# STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION
## 
### 
Sponsor: Pardner Wynn
Not even the Daily can honestly support their Special Fee request. As a co-chair
of the Appropriations Committee which reviewed the Daily budget, I reached the
conclusion that they just don't need our money.
First, they want to add another $13,000 to already swollen reserves for protec
tion against possible future hard times. That money should not be coming from
this year's students' pockets!
Second, their Fee request is only 6% of their 3/4 of a million dollar budget —
they could easily raise this money by slightly increasing rates for corporate adver
tisers, but they don't want to "burden" high-tech industry recruiters when stu
dent money is so easy to get.
Third, no other student organization claims to need $65,000 for salaries. These
people are using the Daily as a pre-professional training camp, and we're paying
them? Speaking of pay, ask a Daily ad salesperson what they made in commis
sions last fall — that's the best student-work-secret on campus! Why should the
Daily be different from all other student organizations, which rely primarily upon
volunteer support?
Fourth, how do they pay for their happy hours and sandwich breaks we see
mentioned every week?
Finally, they don't even pretend to cover student activities in a comprehensive
fashion. Ask anyone in a small club sport or activity who tried to get nominal Daily
coverage — they probably heard: "put an ad in Once Around the Quad."
Tell the Daily that if they want to "play newspaper" they shouldn't sponge un
necessarily off of "easy" student money. They'll claim that you're only paying
pennies per day — but every home in Palo Alto gets the award-winning Palo Alto
Weekly delivered free!
Look at their budget: the Daily just doesn't need our money.
