The Rape Education Project of Stanford University is an organization of students
dedicated to educating the community, including ourselves, about the problem
of rape. We work to dispel myths about rape, to discuss safety options for wo
men, to offer information about emergency services, and to raise questions about
how traditional expectations of men and women can contribute to the problem of
rape. Toward these ends, we publish and distribute the booklet "Working Against
Rape," lead approximately 60 workshops a year with a film and subsequent dis
cussion, and organize/sponsor other educational events which includes film and
speakers series and our annual fall event, "Facing Rape Week."
