# STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION

The Rape Education Project (REP) educates the Stanford Community about the
problems of rape. This part of its budget, totaling just under $7000, appears to be
money well spent. Stanford/Palo Alto has a history of a series of rapes every few
years. And even one rape or attempted rape is very serious for the victim.
The problem with this special fee request is that it also includes $5045 to begin
work on a film. REP explains that a film is a necessary element of any rape educa
tion discussion, led by any rape education group, anywhere in the country. Such
a film does not presently exist, according to REP.
I do not dispute the need for this film. But before any student votes to approve
money for the film, he/she should be aware of the following factors:
1) This film would be useful to all college campus rape awareness groups. Yet
REP is asking only one student body, Stanford, to fund the film for everyone.
2) The total budget for the film is $13,486. The $5045 will only be a beginning. If
another $8441 is not forthcoming, the $5045 will be wasted. Thus it is highly likely
that if REP gets this fee request, they will be back for more.
3) REP claims it is willing to try to raise some of this money elsewhere, but so far
it has made little effort to do so. For some reason the REP people feel it is appro
priate to tax the Stanford student body first, and only try to raise elsewhere
whatever they can not get from the students.
4) REP has requested and received funding for a film project each of the last
two years. It has yet to spend any of that money on a film.
REP is a worthwhile group. And this film may be a worthwhile idea. But there is
a serious question for you to consider before you vote as to whether a special fee
assessment is an appropriate way to finance the film at this time. Wouldn't it be
more appropriate for REP to raise some outside money and show their commit
ment to the film project first, before they ask us to commit to up to $13,486. In the
meantime the rest of their activities can be funded through the ASSU boards.
