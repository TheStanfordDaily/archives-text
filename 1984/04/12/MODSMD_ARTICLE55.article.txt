# Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament Forum
## 
### 
Sponsor: John Mattox
The Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament Forum (SACDF) is dedicated to
promoting discussion of nuclear weapons issues in the Stanford community.
SACDF refrains from advocacy and strives to arrange equal representation of op
posing view points.
SACDF was founded in the spring of 1981 around the presentation of a series of
informative programs entitled "Weapons Crisis Week." Since then SACDF has
presented to the Stanford Community a substantial number of high quality public
programs. Many of these programs were videotaped and the videotapes are cur
rently available to the Stanford community through the Meyer A-V Library.
In order for SACDF to continue bringing quality programs on nuclear weapons
issues to the Stanford community, we are seeking a special fee for '84-85. The
bulk of our special fee will be applied to expenses related to presenting public
programs in the Stanford community. You will notice that of the $13,284 we plan
to spend for programming, $5624 will be raised by the Forum from non-ASSU
sources.
A small amount of the fee will support other activities. SACDF along with the
local chapter of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility maintains a
computer based teleconference on arms control. This computer system is
available to anyone with a terminal and a 300 baud modem at (415) 948-1474. The
Forum is an affiliate of United Campus to Prevent Nuclear War (UCAM). This af
filiation allows for cooperation with groups similar to SACDF on campuses
throughout the nation. We are also working with Residential Education to es
tablish dormitory programs on nuclear weapons issues.
Although the requested special fee is large, we feel that the money will be very
well spent. You will notice that our budget includes absolutely no expenditures
for salaries. The activities of the forum result from volunteer effort on the part of
SACDF members. Our budget includes only $300 for honoraria — we have found

in the past that eminent figures are quite willing to volunteer their services to our
programs.
