For more than 20 years, Stanford-!n-Government (S-l-G) has promoted student
involvement in government by assisting students in their search for meaningful
public sector internships in national, state, and local government offices, as well
as encouraging student interest in public service. Secondly, S-l-C is dedicated to
stimulating campus debate over issues of political concern by sponsoring public
policy symposia.
Approximately one-third of the special fee will support S-I-G's summer pro
gram of academic and social activities for the more than 200 Stanford D.C. sum
mer interns each year and S-I-G's lobby trip to Washington to help students se
cure public sector employment. Another third is allocated for operating expenses
â€” dissemination of information packets, guides, and newsletters and the mainte
nance of up-to-date office resource listings of public sector internships and of
housing. The final third of our budget supports the S-l-G Public Policy Forum.
The Public Policy Forum is one of S-I-G's most active, popular and important
projects. The Forum was established last year in order to fill a perceived gap in the
civic life of the University: that is, the absence of a non-partisan, aggressive stu
dent group dedicated solely to increasing the level of political debate on the Stan
ford campus through the sponsorship of speeches, debates, symposia, and
smaller-scale sherry hours on topics of timely political interest.
In its first year the S-l-G Public Policy Forum has succeeded not only in bringing
outstanding speakers to campus but also in working with other student groups in
enhancing political awareness on campus. The Forum has either sponsored or co
sponsored talks by John Anderson, Alan Cranston, and Ralph Nader, as well as
talks by lesser-known figures (such as Berkeley political scientist Nelson Polsby)
and panel discussions (on the foreign policy of John F. Kennedy). For spring quar
ter, the Forum has scheduled a conference on Middle East terrorism, a confer
ence on the future of the United Nations, a Supreme Court Week, and a discus
sion on funding for scientific research at Stanford.
The Forum has also been active in this year's "Participation and Public Policy"

conference, a collective project sponsored by many campus groups. In this elec
tion year, the S-l-G Forum has undertaken the ambitious project of sponsoring a
voter registration drive in University residences, an effort conducted with the
help of the Lobby Office and Project Democracy.
In only one year the Forum has established a reputation as a leader among stu
dent groups in encouraging the widely-shared objective of increasing knowledge
of and commitment to public service at Stanford.
On the whole, Stanford-ln-Government programs and services reach out to all
members of the community. With the efficient management of quality programs,
S-l-G achieves its two principle goals: to promote student involvement and inter
est in the public service, and to stimulate campus debate over public policy is
sues.
We look forward to your support.
