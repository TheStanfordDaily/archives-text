# Campaign reform pressed
## 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
"At the present time, political
financing is inadequate, dis
criminatory and ultimately corrupt,"
Law Prof. Robert Girard said yester
day at a Stanford Law Forum on the
role of money in politics and the
future of campaign reform.
"The most serious thing of all is that
potential large contributors have spe
cial access to office-holders and
therefore have undue influence."
Girard said.
Girard proposes limitations on con
tributions as a method of reform —
limitations which would be high
enough to maintain adequate financ
ing but low enough to eliminate the
ability of the affluent to elect officials.
He said a substantial source of new,
relatively no-strings-attached cam
paign funds must be found to alleviate
the erosion of political confidence in
the system.
Girard's views concerning the
necessity for a reform system con
flicted with Lyn Nofziger's, former as
sistant to President Reagan for Politi
cal Affairs. "Reformers would dem
onstrate a lack of faith in those we
elect to public office; my faith in a sys
tem which places its faith in people
does not waver," Nofziger said.
Nofziger argued that government
should allow the present system of
campaign financing to stand on its own.
"The more that government in
trudes, the more that it.and not the
people, will be in charge of elections,"
Nofziger said. "Each regulation
passed is an incumbent insurance
measure: When the resources of a
non-incumbent are limited, his ability
to compete is limited as well.
•"Imposing spending limitations will
not keep the public from making bad
decisions, for you cannot legislate or
control morality," Nofziger stated. He
believes that the solution lies in reduc
ing government control and requiring
all campaign contributions totaling
$1000 or more to be registered as
public information.
A third panelist, attorney Mark
Green, said he sees the issue of money
and politic l :<s an old problem
