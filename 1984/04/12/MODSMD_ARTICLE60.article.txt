Film series are not examples of public goods. They only benefit the people who
attend them, not those who choose to stay at home. Thus it has always been con
sidered a just, as well as a fiscally sound practice for those films not considered
part of the normal educational program offered by the University to charge admis
sion.
Historically film series on campus have been either run by the University as part
of its educational program (and thus funded out of the University Operating
Budget), or have been self financing (by charging admission). Examples of the first
group include the series run by the Languages Departments; those of the second
include the Sunday Flicks, Chaparral Film Series, and the Law School Film Series.
The SMARTOR Tuesday Night Film series has historically been in the latter cate
gory (it is the successor to the Great Directors' Film Series). If this fee is passed,
then why shouldn't the Law School Film Society (which shows many "American
Classic Films") request a fee? Or even the Sunday Flicks? While showing these
films for free does, as the proponents of this fee request state, encourage people
to attend them, the same can be said of ANY activity. Why not simply make ANY
desirable good free, so as to encourage its consumption? Once activities that
should be, at least in part, self financing, are paid for out of public funds, there is
no easy line to draw. Student fees, already growing at an alarming rate, will simply
receive one more big boost.
The film series itself is too expensive (through an unnecessary reliance upon
services provided by Events and Services). Also, it is disproportionately attended
by faculty and staff, who do not pay fees but who can attend the films (in contrast
to the more than 90% of the student body who will pay for these films through
their fees but who will not attend them!).
Given the historically high number of fee requests on the ballot this year, this
fee request is, at best, an unnecessary luxury which can, and should, be defeated.
