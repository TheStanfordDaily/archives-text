# Stanford Progressive Alliance
## 
### 
Sponsor: Paul Baer
The Stanford Progressive Alliance is a coalition of student organizations united
around common concerns including racism, sexism, human, rights, economic
justice, military intervention, and nuclear weapons. Through speakers, forums,
workshops and other activities, SPA strives to bring the discussion of political is
sues to campus, to present a progressive viewpoint, and to involve students
actively in peace and social justice issues.
In winter quarter this year, SPA sponsored a workshop on coalition-building
and a speech by Barry Commoner. Spring quarter SPA played a major role in the
ASSU Lobby Office conference on political participation. SPA activities in past
years include a "disorientation week" 1981 and again in 1982, a symposium series
on U.S. militarism 1982, and a three-part spring series on racism, sexism, and
militarism in 1983. SPA has co-sponsored such events as Hooverville-Reaganville,
the annual November fast, and the 1983 SCAAN Human Rights Symposium.
Speakers (and performers) that SPA has brought or helped bring include Dennis
Banks, Charlotte Bunch, Angela Davis, Ron Dellums, Daniel Ellsberg, Michael
Harrington, Gil Scott Heron, Francis Moore Lape, Linda Lovelace, Kitty McKin
non, Ralph Nader, Holly Near and I.F. Stone. In 1982-83 SPA printed the Progres
sive, which has since spun off into an independent organization.
Groups active in SPA this year include the Associated Students from Turkey, the
Committee for Justice in the Middle East, the Committee for U.S./UNESCO Rela
tions, the Democratic Socialists of America, MEChA, the Stanford African Stu
dents' Association, Stanford Against Conscription, the Stanford Central American
Action Network, Stanford Coalition Against Apartheid, and the Stanford Progres
sive. Last year the BSU, the Womens' Center, and the Rape Education Project par
ticipated actively in the coalition as well. SPA also has members who are not part
of any other student organization.
Next year's planned activities, to be funded by this fee and by other campus
funding sources, include a conference on election issues to be held in early Octo
ber; a forum on the election results in November; a two-week series on foreign
policy issues in the Winter, and a two-week series on domestic issues in the
Spring.
