Sponsor: Derek Passarelli
S.U.R.E. Escort Service is seeking a fee assessment to continue the service it
provides the Stanford community. SURE provides a shuttle service leaving
Meyer/Green libraries and Tresidder Union every night of the week. In addition,
SURE provides an on-call service to students wishing to go anywhere on campus
Sunday-Thursday nights, 8 p.m.-Midnight. We operate our services 6 p.m.-
Midnight during the Winter months. With the purchase of our eight person golf
car, we are able to handle a greater volume of calls and operate the shuttle more
efficiently. The officers of SURE and the bicycle escorts remain voluntary. We pay
the drivers in order to maintain reliability and efficiency. SURE also receives fun
ding from the Department of Public Safety and the Dean of Student Affairs. We
are always seeking out ways in which to provide a better service at a reduced cost.
SURE is always open to suggestions as to how we could improve our service. We
encourage everyone to use our service. We hope the students continue their sup
port of SURE and that they continue to use our service.
