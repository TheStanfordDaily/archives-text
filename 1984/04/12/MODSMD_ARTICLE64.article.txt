# Women's Center
## 
### 
Sponsor: Celeste Landry
The Women's Center serves to educate the Stanford community about wo
men's issues and concerns and to provide services which Stanford women stu
dents, in particular, seek. At our office in the Toyon Eating Clubs, we provide an
informational and referral service for jobs, housing, health and crisis information
and an activities center where classes, workshops, meetings and parties are held.
We maintain a 24 hour events tape and an extensive library with books, magazines
and cassette tapes. Our collection includes the works of women writers, poets
and musicians and topics range from politics to sexuality to issues of race, class
and religion.
The Women's Center is staffed by student volunteers and two part-time pro
gramming coordinators. Most of our money goes to funding campus-wide events
and activities which this year include National Women's History Week, a Bay Area
Women Poets Series, voter registration, a bike maintenance workshop, a Margie
Adam concert, end-of-quarter study halls, various speakers, the selling of t-shirts,
and more. In addition we support A Woman's Guide to Stanford and the SWOPSI
classes on self-defense.

The Women's Center serves to educate the Stanford community about wo
men's issues and concerns and to provide services which Stanford women stu
dents, in particular, seek. At our office in the Toyon Eating Clubs, we provide an
informational and referral service for jobs, housing, health and crisis information
and an activities center where classes, workshops, meetings and parties are held.
We maintain a 24 hour events tape and an extensive library with books, magazines
and cassette tapes. Our collection includes the works of women writers, poets
and musicians and topics range from politics to sexuality to issues of race, class
and religion.
The Women's Center is staffed by student volunteers and two part-time pro
gramming coordinators. Most of our money goes to funding campus-wide events
and activities which this year include National Women's History Week, a Bay Area
Women Poets Series, voter registration, a bike maintenance workshop, a Margie
Adam concert, end-of-quarter study halls, various speakers, the selling of t-shirts,
and more. In addition we support A Woman's Guide to Stanford and the SWOPSI
classes on self-defense.
