Senate Recommendation on
Constitutional Amendment #1
Senate Recommendation: YES
This amendment makes a number of necessary
modifications to the section of the Constitution
dealing with the ASSU's finances. It provides a
process for the appointment of the Financial
Manager (currently Student Financial Manager)
which is consistent with the current practice and
with the appointment of other ASSU officers who
are not directly elected by the student body. The
language dealing with the ASSU's budget and the
banking service (Students' Organizations Fund) is
modernized and clarified.
This amendment also provides that students will
always be able to know the amount of the Associa
tion Fee for the following year before voting on Spe
cial Fees.
As we believe that these changes are necessary
and appropriate, the Senate urges you to vote YES
on this amendment.

Statement in Favor of
Constitutional Amendment #1
Sponsor: Eric M. Berg
This amendment, if approved, would update the
section of the ASSU Constitution which deals with
the ASSU's budget and finances to make it more
consistent with the existing practices of the ASSU
and with the requirements of sound financial man
agement.
Major changes in the amendment would be as fol
lows:
♦ The process by which the Financial Manager is
appointed will be specified in detail; this section fol
lows existing practices but will be included in the
Constitution for the first time. As is true for all other
non-elected ASSU officers, the appointment of the
Financial Manager will be subject to confirmation by
the Senate, and the Senate will have the authority to
remove the Financial Manager from office by a vote
of two-thirds of the members.
♦ The ASSU Operating Budget will be distin
guished from other ASSU budgets (e.g., those of the

Business and Service Projects); a requirement is in
troduced that the Senate approve the budget before
the beginning of the fiscal year.
♦ The process by which the Senate sets the
amount of the Association Fee will be modified so
that this must be accomplished before the Spring
Quarter election. This ensures that students will
know the amount of this fee before voting on Spe
cial Fee requests.
♦ The ASSU office staff will be moved under the
day-to-day supervision of the Financial Manager,
rather than being under the Council of Presidents as
the Constitution currently provides, which is more
in keeping with actual practice.
♦ For the first time, there will be an explicit basis
in the Constitution for the various ASSU agencies in
cluding the Service Projects (Speakers Bureau,
Guest Professor Bureau, etc.) and Business Projects
(Sunday Flicks, Lecture Notes, T-Shirt Service, etc.).
At its March 6 meeting, the necessary two-thirds
of the ASSU Senate voted to place this constitutional
amendment on the ballot and to recommend that
you vote YES on it. Please show your support for the
efficient functioning and financial soundness of the
ASSU by voting YES!
