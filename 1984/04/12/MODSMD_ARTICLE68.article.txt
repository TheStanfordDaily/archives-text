# Statement in Favor of Constitutional Amendment #2

This amendment proposes several changes to the
sections of the ASSU Constitution which provide for
the election of Senators and with the Council of
Presidents.
Regarding the Senate, the two major substantive
changes deal with the election of the graduate mem
bers of the Senate. Both of these changes reflect that
fact that the current system of election of graduate
Senators by districts (rather than at-large) has
resulted in the systematic under-representation of
graduate students in the Senate, since several dis
tricts have consistently failed to elect regular or al
ternate Senators in the two years that this system has
been in effect. Rather than mandating the elimina
tion of district elections, the proposed amendment
would provide flexibility and allow for experimenta
tion until the best arrangements can be found.
Specifically, the changes would be as follows:
♦ Graduate Senators would be elected from "one
or more constituencies." The Senate already can de
termine the number and composition of the dis

tricts; this amendment would allow it to create one
large district (i.e., to reinstitute the at-large election
of graduate Senators) if this seems appropriate at
some future time, without requiring that this be
done.
♦ The Senate would be able to allow a graduate
alternate Senator to fill a seat from another district, if
there are no regular or alternate Senators available
from that district. This means that there will be seats
in the Senate "reserved" for each district, yet there
will still be 10 graduate Senators able to vote.
(Currently, there are always 10 voting undergradu
ates and less than 10 voting graduates.)
The amendment also provides that Council of
Presidents vetoes of Senate legislation could only be
over-riden by the same vote as was originally re
quired to pass that legislation. A veto by the COP
has the effect of requiring the Senate to reconsider
whether an action is really in the best interests of the
student body. Currently, a veto can be over-riden by
a majority vote of the Senate even if the legislation
originally took two-thirds to pass, thus almost ensur
ing that a veto can be over-riden and defeating the
purpose of a veto.
At its March 6 meeting, the necessary two-thirds
of the ASSU Senate voted to place this constitutional
amendment on the ballot and to recommend that

you vote YES on it. None of the current graduate
Senators expressed opposition to this amendment.
Please show your support for fair representation for
graduate students within the ASSU Senate by voting
YES on it.
