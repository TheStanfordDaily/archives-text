# Senate Recommendation on Constitutional Amendment #2
## 
### 
Senate Recommendation: YES
The major changes introduced into the Constitu
tion by this amendment deal with the election of
graduate Senators. First, the amendment would al
low (but not require) all graduate Senators to be
elected at large, rather than requiring that they be
elected from multiple districts. Second, if there con
tinue to be multiple districts, the amendment would
allow a Senator who was absent from a given
meeting to be replaced by an alternate from another
district, if there was no alternatafrom his/her district
present. Both these changes result from the percep
tion than the current Constitutional requirements
result in,t}ie under-represe/itatipp of. graduate stu
dents in the Senate, since some graduate Senate
seats are rarely filled.
In addition, the amendment provides that Council
of Presidents' vetoes of legislation passed by the
Senate can only be over-ridden by the vote required
to pass the original legislation (for instance, a two
thirds vote for changes to the By-Laws), rather than a
simple majority as is now the case. The amendment
would also remove gender-specific pronouns from
the Constitution.
As we believe that these changes are necessary
and appropriate, the Senate urges you to vote YES
on this amendment.
