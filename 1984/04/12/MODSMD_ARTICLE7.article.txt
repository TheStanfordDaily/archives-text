Chernenko appointed presidenl
Moscow — Communist Party leader Konstantin Cher
nenko, completing his rise to power, was appointed yesterday
as president of the nation's nominal Parliament, the Supreme
Soviet.
A brief session of the Supreme Soviet, meeting in the
Grand Palace of the Kremlin, endorsed Chernenko for the
largely honorary presidency with a unanimous show of hands,
an unvarying custom in all decisions taken by the 1500-
memher parliament.
I he title of president gives Chernenko formal authority as
head ol state as well as leader of the Communist Party, where
real power resides. In terms of protocol, it places him on an
equal footing with the president of the United States and
other elected Western leaders.
I he same 45-minute session returned Nikolai Tikhonov,
79, as premier or head of government, for another five-year
term.
In addition, the ruling party Politburo's youngest member,
53-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev, was named to a foreign af
fairs post in the Supreme Soviet, strengthening his status as
number two in the Soviet leadership and heir-apparent to
C hernenko, who is 20 years Gorbachev's senior.
All three appointments had been widely expected. They
signitied the lull resurgence ot an elderly coalition closely
identified with the policies of the late Leonid Brezhnev, who
died in 1982 after IS years in power.
U.S. aid to Salvadoran air force
has intensified bombing raids
San Salvador, hi Salvador — The Salvadoran air force,
aided by new U.S. reconnaissance flights that give it better in
formation about suspected guerrilla positions, has signifi
cantly intensified its bombing of enemy territory in the past
live weeks, according to Salvadoran and foreign military
sources.
The reports follow disclosures by U.S. and Salvadoran offi
cials late last month that U.S. aircralt, which began flying out
of Honduras about two months ago, were providing valuable
information on guerrilla locations to Salvadoran infantry
commanders in the field during battle. The new reports,
however, were the first time that Salvadoran officers des
cribed the importance for the air force of the U.S.-supplied
information.
I here has been no indication that the U.S. planes have
been involved in any combat situations directly.
The U.S. intelligence aid came as the pace of the fighting
intensified in the weeks prior to the March 25 first-round
presidential election. Military sources said the air force in
creased its bombardments in the three weeks prior to the vote
in order to prevent the left-wing rebels from disrupting the
vote, and relief officials complain that the upsurge increased
the number of civilians killed in the fighting. El Salvador's six
U.S.-supplied A 37 "Dragonfly" jet warplanes dropped an
average of 30 bombs a day during that period compared to 10
a day in February, according to the military sources.
Militiamen shell Beirut crossing
Beirut, Lebanon — Shelling closed the only crossing be
tween the Christian and Moslem sides of Beirut for more than
two hours yesterday as French observers along the Green
Line came under sniper fire and civilians deserted the streets
of both sides of the capital.
Sporadic shelling between Lebanon's warring sectarian fac
tions Tuesday killed four persons and wounded 38 as political
leaders struggled to achieve a timetable for implementing a
separation of forces that would disengage militiamen along
the dividing line from Beirut in the north to Souk el-Gharb in
the south.
The National Museum crossing on the Green Line was
deserted yesterday afternoon because of persistent sniper fire
and occasional shelling, in sharp contrast to the normal long
lines of cars waiting three or more hours to cross. Most of the
white-helmeted observers deployed along the 600-yard cross
ing were maintaining low visibility, but were still present,
along with policemen of Lebanon's Internal Security Force.
Streets in the Christian east were virtually empty, in appar
ent expectation ot retaliatory shelling for Tuesday's heavy
bombardment of the Moslem sector of the city.
Two soldiers of the Lebanese army's Moslem-led Sixth
Brigade were killed early yesterday morning and one
wounded when a barrage of mortar shells landed on Shatila
Circle, a key junction on the main road to Beirut
Officials misused HUD funds
Washington — Federal auditors yesterday said that the
Memphis Housing Authority, in "complete disregard" of
government rules, used federal housing subsidies to speculate
in the volatile bond market, buying and selling an average of
$46 million in bonds each month in search of quick profits.
Using $5.7 million in public money to borrow $20 million
from private brokers, Memphis housing officials made 1700
transactions over two and one-half years, the auditors said.
These transactions, which totaled $1.4 billion, sought to
profit from fluctuations in the price of 30-year U.S. Treasury
bonds.
After Housing and Urban Development Department
auditors caught up with them. Memphis Housing Authority
officials sold the bonds last Friday at a loss of $2 million,
nearly wiping out profits reaped before the bond market
declined.
Angola pullout going slowly
Johannesburg, South Africa — The withdrawal of South
African troops from southern Angola — the first step in a
U.S. and United Nations plan to bring peace to the area and
independence to the southwest African territory of Namibia
— is behind schedule, a South African government spokes
man acknowledged yesterday.
The Joint Monitoring Commission, composed of South
African and Angolan representatives to police the withdrawal
of South African troops and keep the area they evacuate from
being infiltrated by Namibian guerrillas based in Angola, "is
encountering problems," another informed source said.
The original target date for all South Africans to be out of
Angola was March 31. with the monitoring group to have
moved progressively south to the Angola-Namibia border in
five stages. But as of yesterday, the monitoring force was
reportedly still 115 miles within Angola and the monitor's
headquarters camp only at stage two in the withdrawal, lo
cated at the village of Mupa.
Stock market drifts lower
New York — The stock market moved broadly lower yes
terday, its retreat accelerating during the day as investors
questioned whether interest rates were headed lower.
Retail stocks fell in advance of today's government report
on March sales, and drug and technology issues were
prominent among the losers. Some auto and brokerage stocks
rose.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 7.33 points to
1130.97, ending a string of three consecutive rises. The blue
chip index only slightly higher than last Thursday's closing
of 1130.55. its lowest since April 8. 1983.
