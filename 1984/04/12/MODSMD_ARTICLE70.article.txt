# Statement Opposing Constitutional Amendment #2

I think that the ASSU Senate is important. As a
corollary, the parameters which define the composi
tion of the senate are material. The importance of

these guidelines is so significant, in fact, that it re
quires a constitutional amendment to change them.
Or at least it does now. If two-thirds of the students
support this legislation, some of this power will be
transferred from students to the senate itself. This,
to me, would be a serious mistake.
So why did the senate put this measure on the bal
lot? Why was I the only senator who chose not to
vote for this constitutional amendment? Well, the
advantage of this amendment is that it would allow
graduate senators to be elected at-large, as under
graduates are elected under the status quo system.
My question, though, is if that is what people want,
why don't they put that on the ballot.
Instead, the senate has opted for a plan which
would permit the senate to organize graduate senate
districts however it likes. Moreover, it could
structure the alternate senators in whatever fashion
it fancies, including by a process of arbitrary
ranking. In effect, the senate would gain control
over which of its members are allowed to vote. This
is what I oppose.
The author of this legislation wants more graduate
senators to be able to vote, to balance the influence

of undergraduates. I understand his concern. The
solution, however, should be a straightforward con
stitutional amendment which specifically states that
graduate senators shall be elected at-large. Then stu
dents could make their choice in the normal man
ner. Minimally, an amendment like this should be
more precise regarding the ranking of alternates. In
that many graduate senators lose interest in the sen
ate quickly, the effect could be far-reaching.
This constitutional amendment would also in
crease the power of the Council of Presidents' veto.
I see no reason to increase the power of the Council
of Presidents relative to that of the senate. A
majority of the senate should be sufficient to
overrule a veto by the Council of Presidents. The
principal purpose of the Council of Presidents' veto
is simply to make the members of the senate recon
sider their decision. My objections to this are sec
ondary.
I have no objections to removing gender-specific
pronouns from the ASSU constitution.
Examine the measure carefully. If your analysis
parallels mine you will vote against Constitutional
Amendment #2.
