From the Los Angeles Times
\N â€” The Reagan administration, lighting
to save its covert war against Nicaragua from a
threatened cutoff ot lunds. is considering an end to fur
ther mining ot Nicaragua's harbors hut has made no
final decision, officials said yesterdav.
Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth Dam and other
administration officials told Congress that the ClA
directed mining was completed last month, according to
congressmen who attended a closed briefing on the
issue.
But administration officials refused to rule out new
mining operations in the future, angering some
moderate Republicans as well as Democrats, the con
gressmen said.
I lie operation has been stopped," one Democratic
congressman who attended the briefing said. "But they
made no commitment about what they might do in the
future."

Administration officials confirmed his account and
said that the initial phase of the mining, which began in
February, was completed well before Tuesdav. when
the Senate voted overwhelminglv. 84-12. to condemn
the action.
Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.). who attended the brief
ing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that
Dam told the panel that the mines were laid "some
time ago. that another Central American nation was
involved in the operation and that some of the mines
had already been removed, apparently by the
Nicaraguans themselves.
Dam. who acknowledged in the closed session that
the I nited States had directed the mining, justified the
operation as an act of "collective self-defense" with the
unnamed Central American nation, he said.
Congressional sources said Dam was apparently re
ferring to either LI Salvador or Honduras, both of
which have accused Nicaragua of aiding leftist guerril

las in their countries.
Both Republicans and Democrats in the House said
thex were angrv that President Reagan had authorized
the mining without consulting with Congress and
predicted that the House would block the administra
tion's request for $21 million in new support for rebels
fighting Nicaragua's leftist regime.
"It doesn't have a chance." said House Speaker
Thomas " lip" O'Neill (D-Mass.). who also called the
mining "terrorism at its worst. Ihe mines have
damaged at least si\ merchant ships and caused at least
five injuries, but no deaths.
"I think it's down the drain." Rep. Olympia Snowe
(R-Maine). a moderate Republican member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, said. "I don't think
what they said can salvage it."
However, the House appeared unlikely to take any
definitive action before its two-week Easter recess
beuins tomorrow , congressmen said.
