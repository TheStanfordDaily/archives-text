# Satellite fixed, ready to resume orbit

From the Los Angeles Times
Houston — In a smooth six-hour space
walk, two astronaut-handymen yester
day fixed the Solar Max satellite and
prepared to return it to space to resume
its sun-watching chores.
It was the first time in history that re
pairs have been made in orbit, opening
the way for regular servicing of satellites
and eventually for the construction of a
U.S. space station.
Astronauts George Nelson and James

van Hoften stepped into the Challenger's
cargo bay about 3 a.m. CST. took out
their tools and headed for the Solar Max.
which had been brought aboard Tuesday
after being snagged by the shuttle's robot
arm.
A work platform was installed on the
arm yesterday, which the astronauts used
as a cherry picker to go to work on the
17-foot-tall satellite.
With lanterns on their helmets to il
luminate their work. Nelson and Van

Hoften used a special wrench to replace
the satellite's faulty attitude control
module. The module malfunctioned in
November 19S0. 10 months after the
satellite was launched, preventing Solar
Max from pointing at specific locations
on the sun and seriously limiting its use
fulness.
After a few minutes, the astronauts
placed a cover over an X-ray sensor to
improve its performance, and then
turned to the satellite's main electronics

box, which needed to be repaired to
revive another instrument.
The electronics box. which had not
been intended for in-flight repair, posed
a tricky problem. The astronauts had to
strip away insulation and remove 36 tiny
screws to get to it.
After the repairs were completed.
Solar Max was hoisted 011 the robot arm
in preparation for its return to orbit
today.
