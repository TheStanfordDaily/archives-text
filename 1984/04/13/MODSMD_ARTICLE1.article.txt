# Stanford gets gift from Digital Corp.
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer 
After a year and a half of plan
ning. a $6 million donation
to the University in research equip
ment and funds by Digital Equip
ment Corporation was announced
yesterday.
Project SUN DEC (Stanford
University and Digital Equipment
Corporation) will include three
types of computers: local area net
works, distributed server-based re
sources and personal computers.
Three different areas within the
University will receive equipment.
The intial equipment is a gift to
the University while research and
equipment maintenance funds are
part of a contractual agreement
stipulating Stanford's research re
spons-ibdities.

Digital Equipment Corporation
is the world's second-largest com
puter and software manufacturer.
The research Stanford will conduct
will later be used by the corpora
tion in the development of its
software.
One of the participants in the
project is the LOTS computer
facility, which will do research on
instructional computer applica
tions.
The Department of Electrical
Engineering will investigate the
aspects of a distributed computer
environment relevant to research
in electrical engineering. Emphasis
in the Electrical Engineering De
partment will also focus on
software that will utilize both per

sonal computers and central com
puters as well as the use of personal
computers as graphics work sta
tions.
The third beneficiary of the pro
gram will he the Graduate School
of Business, which will look at the
application of administrative data
processing and the access of large
data bases in a distributed environ
ment.
According to Electrical Engi
neering Prof. John Hennessy,
"Stanford was chosen because it is
recognized as a leading school in
the computer science and electrical
engineering areas."
The research in the Electrical
Engineering Department will be
done by faculty and graduate stu
dents, Hennessy said. And al
though the contract was only
signed last week, equipment has
already started arriving, Hennessy
said.
"What we are trying to do is to
use computers to design bigger and
better chips . . . and to use a collec
tion of different-sized machines. ..
so that by combining big and small
machines we hope to create a more
cost effective way of doing re
search," Hennessy said.
The long-term effects of SUN
DEC might help to alleviate the
problem of inadequate computer
capacity at LOTS, but in the short
run no significant change will oc
cur, Hennessy said.
The SUNDEC project "will be a
unique experiment in the evolution
of present-day systems into the dis
tributed computing environments
likely to play a major part in the
next generation of University com
puting facilities," according to Sam
Fuller, vice president of Corporate
Research and Architecture at Digi
tal Equipment Corporation.
