## GLAS member discusses issues of gay community 
### VIRGINIA GUISER 
From the recently approved
Inner Quad renovations to the
recently vandalized sculpture
"Gay Liberation," one voice al
ways seems to cry louder and
more often than the others. One
person seems supremely con
cerned with University change.
The voice is that of Gerard
Koskovich, a doctoral candidate
in the Art History Department
a-nd a leading activist and steer
ing committee member of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS).

'All in all, in the time I've been at Stan
ford, there has been increasing recogni
tion, on the part of the University, of gay
students and their needs and problems as
legitimate concerns/

GLAS, formerly the Gay
Peoples Union, was formed 10
years ago to promote and
protect the interests of gay stu
dents at Stanford.
And Koskovich, as a
spokesperson for GLAS, has
vigorously supported gay rights
on campus, and while he feels
that Stanford generally supports
its gay community, he is still
aware of the risks and problems
of leading an openly gay life
here.
"While there are many ways
in which our situation could be
improved and justice afforded
to us to a greater extent than it
is," Koskovich said, "I think
one also has to grant that our
situation here, relative to many
other places, is very good."

Koskovich said the University
has supported the gay commu
nity, but added that there are
still some issues on which GLAS
and the University administra
tion disagree.
The group never experienced
problems obtaining status as a
campus organization, though,
thanks to University support,
Koskovich said. He called
GLAS's office space at the Old
Firehouse provided by the Uni
versity "a considerable form of
support.
"All in all, in the time I've

been at Stanford, there has been
increasing recognition on the
part of the University of gay stu
dents and their needs and prob
lems as legitimate concerns,"
Koskovich said.
"On the other hand, in a
more formal sense, the Univer
sity administration has consis
tently refused numerous re
quests made by gay men and
lesbians to adopt a formal non
discrimination policy," he said.
Adopting a written policy is
not a novel idea, Koskovich
said. California's State Univer
sity system opted for such a plan
last year, he said.
According to Koskovich, the
University has told GLAS a for
mal policy is not needed, offer
ing verbal assurance that it will

not discriminate against gays.
Koskovich sees three prob
lems with Stanford's position.
First, there is no guarantee
the individual administrators,
who made this assurance, will
continue to be the administra
tors in question.
There is also no formal as
surance of non-discrimination
for those thinking of being stu
dents here.
If a University administrator
does discriminate against a stu
dent, there is the additional
problem of a lack of grievance
procedures to handle the mat
ter.
He said he believes the lack of
a formal grievance procedure
prevents many students from
pursuing complaints because
their rights are not guaranteed.
Other students, afraid to
"come out" without written as
surance of their rights, are con
demned to lead double lives,
Koskovich said.
Koskovich gave examples of
University privileges he said are
unavailable to gay students.
The University does not pro
vide spouse cards to gay
couples. They are ineligible for
married student housing.
Stanford maintains that these
privileges cannot be extended to
gay couples because they are
not provided to unmarried
straight couples, Koskovich
said.
"Fundamentally, that is
dodging the issue because those
privileges should be provided to
the unmarried life partners of
heterosexuals," he said. "For
the University to argue that it
discriminates against more than
just gay people just shows that

there is a bigger problem."
More extreme and violent
forms of anti-gay expression are
seldom a problem at Stanford,
Koskovich said.
In his view, however, the
defacement of George Segal's
sculpture, "Gay Liberation,"
symbolized a violent attack
against gays as well as against all
thinking people at Stanford.
Koskovich said the incident
brought up painful memories of

violent threats and actual physi
cal beatings suffered by friends
simply because they are gay.
"It was not implausible to
think it could easily have been
one of us or one of our friends,"
he said.
GLAS placed flowers at the
sculpture's site and organized a
campus rally for people to ex
press their grief about the
statue's destruction.
Koskovich said GLAS's im

mediate response to the press
was not political maneuvering,
and added that speaking out on
issues concerning the gay com
munity is one of GLAS's pri
mary roles.
"(The members of the steer
ing committee) knew that the
straight press was going to des
cend," Koskovich said, "and
they were not going to convey
the feelings we had, to recognize
them or respect them, if we

didn't do something about it."
The organization recently
sponsored a controversial
lecture on pedophilia by Ed
ward Brongersma, a lawyer
from the Netherlands. Bron
gersma supports abolishing age
of consent laws for sexual activ
ity.
Although Koskovich said
GLAS received threats of
protest before the lecture, none
occurred at the speech.
