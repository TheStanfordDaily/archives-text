The People, Projects, Participation slate

Melissa Auchard, Todd Kerr, David Porter and
Alice Wells are the People, Projects, Partici
pation (P 3 ) slate running for the COP and they
deserve unequivocal support.
The slate's mix of ASSU experience will pro
vide an invaluable basis for dealing with the often
labyrinthine structure of student government.
Porter and Auchard have been senators, Porter
for the past two years. Wells was the chair of the
nominations committee and director of the Pro
gram Board this year, and Kerr is director of
ASSU Friends and Helpers.
Without a cogent and firmly grounded vision,
no amount of experience can make the COP an
effective and influential focal point of student
government. P 3 provides this vision.
We support most of the slate's opinions on
campus issues: It sees the need for a fee-for-ser
vice Food Service plan and maintenance of the
Tresidder Coffee House as a student-run opera
tion. P 3 advocates enhancement of theme houses
as well as initiating a loose organization of
minority groups for more effective minority
recruitment. A network of women's groups will
be established to coordinate women's issues. The
slate also wants to begin the push for more office
space for student organizations and increased
graduate student involvement.
For all its experience and thorough treatment
of the issues, P 3 truly distinguishes itself by
looking forward and meeting the issues of the
future, not merely reacting to the issues after they
have become crises. The slate's proposal for a
comprehensive quality of life survey, embracing

the academic, social and residential aspects of
student life, deserves to be well received and
should provide the basis for careful and con
structive consideration of "the Stanford experi
ence."
The outcome of the review can only be positive.
By trying to gauge students' opinion about their
experience at Stanford, the review cannot fail to
give the University and ASSU administrators an
agenda with which to guide policy formulation for
the immediate future. Student involvement will
also be increased with creation of six task forces
to undertake the evaluation. Simply giving more
students the opportunity to participate, meaning
fully, in the ASSU may itself improve the quality
of life here.
In the past, there have been many COP slates
which have begun the campaign and subsequent
term with ideas as promising and attractive as
those with which P 3 begins this year. We realize
that the hard realities of the office may tend to
blunt and divert some of the specific ideas which
are appealing now. However, in this case, even if
the campaign promises are eventually muted, and
there is no reason to believe they will be, we are
certain P 3 will serve students well. The P 3 slate is
marked by a cohesion and commitment of its
members unique in this year's election, and will
assuredly work well together, no matter which is
sues arise next year.
Auchard, Kerr, Porter and Wells complement
each other superbly to form a talented and unified
slate — one undoubtedly worthy of your vote and
worthy to serve you.
