# ASSU senators
## Undergraduate senators 
### 
Jon Adelstein
Senior Jon Adelstein has been a member of the
ASSU Senate this year and would bring experi
ence and continuity to next year's senate. Best of
all, he understands the day-to-day operations of
the ASSU and is willing to immerse himself in
trying to better coordinate its workings.
Jay Alter
Even though he is a freshman, Jay Alter will
bring needed dedication and ability to the senate.
Alter has followed the ASSU closely this year and
has some of the best-researched ideas on the
shuttle service to San Francisco, the Bookstore,
the libraries and Food Service that we've heard.
John Boranian
Active in politics already, John Boranian hopes
to turn his attention to the senate in an effort to
build up student coalitions. He plans to "push the
senate to look beyond the bylaws." The sopho
more public policy/economics major offers a fresh
sense of direction.
Yvonne Campos
Yvonne Campos really is breaking out of the
typical senate mold. The junior in political science
aims to focus her attention on the services the
ASSU should be providing for the students. In
credibly well-informed, Campos plans on inves
tigating representation of Governor's Corner and
the fraternities in the senate districting plan, the
shuttle service to San Francisco and the Coffee
House.
Gustavo Gomez
Gustavo Gomez wants to improve communica
tions between the senate and the rest of the com
munity. His specific interests are in pushing Food
Service changes, working toward getting concerts
back on campus and in looking into the role of
Residential Education.
Nan Ho
Another impressive freshman candidate, Nan
Ho has been involved in the ASSU as a senate as
sociate this year and has come to grips with the
senate process. She has a true understanding of
the bureaucracy involved and of the importance
of student concerns. Shuttle bus service to San
Francisco and better I.D.s are two of her inter
ests. A candidate without self-aggrandizing
motives, she will be a very effective senate mem
ber.

Gloria Johnson
Gloria Johnson hopes to address the areas of
academics and health and safety if elected. Better
lighting on campus and longer library hours are
specific concerns of hers, as are the studies of
theme houses and fraternities and sororities.
Being involved with Program Board, the junior
would like to see more diverse representation in
appropriations decisions.
Derek Passarelli
Very active in student groups including SURE,
the Rape Education Project and the Concert Net
work, Derek Pasarelli has more workable ideas
than most senate candidates. One of his major
goals is to create fewer problems for student
groups. He is interested in studying Food Service,
the fee assessment process and senate districting.
Bob Slater
Bob Slater offers consistent, hard-working rep
resentation and leadership in the senate. Slater
was a senator this year who stuck to his campaign
promises. He plans on reintroducing his plan for
shuttle bus service to San Francisco, which was
voted down this year, reforming the fee assess
ment process and continuing to seek extended li
brary hours.
Mark Soble
Mark Soble will be the first to admit that
sometimes this year it was "me against the sen
ate." As a senate alternate Soble has worked hard
to serve students and to stand by his principles.
He is extremely dedicated and thinks the senate
has taken its own rules too seriously in the past.
