Mark Landesmann
The top concerns for Mark Landesmann are
those of most graduate students: housing and fin
ancial assistance. Landesmann wants to make the
ASSU a more effective platform for graduate stu
dents. He adeptly points to the fact that graduate
students are paying fee assessments that are out
of proportion to the services they receive. The co
terminal student has been involved in the Honor
Code Commission and the 'Guest Professorship
Bureau.
