## Slurs on Hart both unfair and untrue 
### 
In your front page article of April
9, "Conference attracts 4000," Eric
Diesel of Students for Mondale
charges that Gary Hart does not
support national gay rights legislation.
I must respond.
Gary Hart is against the discrimina
tion practiced against gay and lesbian
Americans. In his policy paper on gay
and lesbian civil rights he states that
as president he would:
• Enact an Executive Order which
would prohibit discrimination against
gays and lesbians in federal employ
ment.
• Support and sign the Gay Civil
Rights Bill.
• Seek the repeal of anti-gay exclu
sion language in U.S. immigration
laws.
• Oppose the "McDonald Amend
ment" which restricts legal service
advocacy where homosexuality is the
issue.
In addition, several leaders of the
California gay and lesbian community
have endorsed Hart, including San
Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt and
Santa Cruz Mayor John Laird.
I am sorry the Mondale campaign
is built almost entirely upon mis
repcesenting Gary Hart's views. I for
one pledge to run a positive, issue
oriented campaign on campus this
quarter and I urge all members of the
Stanford community to join me in
that pledge.

Who owns Hart?
Among the issues which should be
on the table as the presidential prima
ries continue is an appropriate federal
investigatory procedure for official
misconduct allegations. Certainly,
officials should not be unduly
deterred from executing, in good
faith, the responsibilities of their
respective offices. Congressional and
executive agency investigations,
however, should be candid with and
loyal to their employers, the Ameri
can public, in marshalling, reporting
and distributing facts obtained.
As ostensible co-author of the
Schweiker Senate Intelligence Report
investigating the Kennedy assassina
tion, Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.)
became a leading figure in a cam
paign to subvert the report and to
place its integrity in doubt.
In April 1976, when the Schweiker
report findings were announced. Hart
told the press the committee un
covered no evidence to question the
fact that Oswald was the lone assas
sin, seriously diminishing the impact
of the historic determination by the

Senate committee which invalidated
the Warren Commission Report and
called for a serious investigation.
Upon release of the full report to the
media, only Sens. Church and
Schweiker were present. (CBS had
informed Schweiker earlier in the day
that Hart was going to boycott the
press conference.) Schweiker was not
appointed to the permanent Senate
Intelligence Committee, Hart was. In
addition, certain "special interest"
groups targeted Church as unfit for
the Senate and poured large sums,
successfully, into his election defeat.)
Did Hart simply have a rapid
change of heart (no pun intended) or
did someone persuade him, volun
tarily or involuntarily, to reverse his
position on the assassination report.
The American public deserves to
know if Hart regularly conducts his
political affairs in this manner, or is
some other invisible hand pulling
Hart's political strings?
If it becomes widely known that
candidate Hart believes the Warren
Commission Assassination Report is
valid, by any standards, Hart's sup
port will vanish faster than a TV pilot
program with low first-week ratings.
Whether Hart will even discuss the
matter in public forum will indicate
who reaily owns Gary Hart.
Finally, in violation of established
principles of International Law,
United Nations Resolutions and
well-settled agreements among the
great religions of the world, Gary
Hurt has pledged to support Israel's
illegal annexation of Jerusalem and
making it the capital city. Current
U.S. policy is correctly opposed to
this move which creates further ten
sion in the area and undermines the
administration's sincere attempt to
achieve peace in the area. Is it the
case that Hart will take whatever
position is most appropriate at
whatever time to obtain votes from
whatever audience to whom he
speaks?

Approaching rush
This time two years ago, I was a
freshman living in Branner. Much like
everyone else, 1 was struggling with
my academics as well as with myself.
Presently, I am a junior and have
lived in a fraternity for close to two
years now. I do not regret joining a
house, but I do regret the way 1
decided to join one. I joined a frater
nity, because I was selected out of
many to join a group of 50 guys who
I greatly respected. I was proud that I
had survived that secret bid meeting
and deemed worthy of being a bro-

ther. I did not stop and think much,
hut I "signed." quickly pleased to
take on the (rat's identity.
After moving into the house, it was
obvious how little being a brother
meant. All of the guys whom I looked
up to were mere students too busy for
me. I had friends in the house, but my
best friends did not rush and lived
elsewhere. Furthermore, I learned
that 50 headstrong men must contain
themselves to operate as a unit effi
ciently. A status quo within the house
proved very stifling to me.
Again, I do not regret joining a
fraternity. Frats are active, energized
groups that force their members into
many social activities. I value the
skills I have gained in dealing with
people, organizing social events, and
being partially responsible for a
budget of about $225,000. I've made
lasting friendships and have had a
great time.
Seeing freshmen getting anxious as
I was two years ago, I worry the
mistake I made will be repeated.
Therefore, here are some hints for
men who will be rushing:
• Be yourself! Because fraternity rush
parties include alcohol and are at best
awkward, it is very easy to drink too
much. Drink only if you want to and
be comfortable if you don't drink.
• Meet as many people as possible.
Don't worry about being superficial.
Rushers get weary of smooth talkers.
• Have a serious side. Ask a friend
who is a member of the fraternity
what he gets out of the Jiouse.
• Find out about the organization. It
you're considering joining a frater
nity, realize that you have a difficult
time regaining your privilege of living
in University housing. Check out all
the alternatives. Maybe you should
wait a year.
Have the following questions an
swered by a fraternity member for
you:
• What programming does the or
ganization have?
• How much money does it cost?
• What community service has the
organization done in the last year?
• How much money was budgeted for
rush? How much of that was for
alcohol? Why so much?
• Why are most of the members
Caucasian?
Whatever, make sure you take
advantage of rush and meet many
people. Please think about it more
seriously than I did. No fraternity is
perfect, but each has its own
strengths. Find these strengths, con
sider the alternatives and then make
an intelligent decision.

who reaily owns Gary Hart.
Finally, in violation of established
principles of International Law,
United Nations Resolutions and
well-settled agreements among the
great religions of the world, Gary
Hurt has pledged to support Israel's
illegal annexation of Jerusalem and
making it the capital city. Current
U.S. policy is correctly opposed to
this move which creates further ten
sion in the area and undermines the
administration's sincere attempt to
achieve peace in the area. Is it the
case that Hart will take whatever
position is most appropriate at
whatever time to obtain votes from
whatever audience to whom he
speaks?

Approaching rush
This time two years ago, I was a
freshman living in Branner. Much like
everyone else, 1 was struggling with
my academics as well as with myself.
Presently, I am a junior and have
lived in a fraternity for close to two
years now. I do not regret joining a
house, but I do regret the way 1
decided to join one. I joined a frater
nity, because I was selected out of
many to join a group of 50 guys who
I greatly respected. I was proud that I
had survived that secret bid meeting
and deemed worthy of being a bro-

ther. I did not stop and think much,
hut I "signed." quickly pleased to
take on the (rat's identity.
After moving into the house, it was
obvious how little being a brother
meant. All of the guys whom I looked
up to were mere students too busy for
me. I had friends in the house, but my
best friends did not rush and lived
elsewhere. Furthermore, I learned
that 50 headstrong men must contain
themselves to operate as a unit effi
ciently. A status quo within the house
proved very stifling to me.
Again, I do not regret joining a
fraternity. Frats are active, energized
groups that force their members into
many social activities. I value the
skills I have gained in dealing with
people, organizing social events, and
being partially responsible for a
budget of about $225,000. I've made
lasting friendships and have had a
great time.
Seeing freshmen getting anxious as
I was two years ago, I worry the
mistake I made will be repeated.
Therefore, here are some hints for
men who will be rushing:
• Be yourself! Because fraternity rush
parties include alcohol and are at best
awkward, it is very easy to drink too
much. Drink only if you want to and
be comfortable if you don't drink.
• Meet as many people as possible.
Don't worry about being superficial.
Rushers get weary of smooth talkers.
• Have a serious side. Ask a friend
who is a member of the fraternity
what he gets out of the Jiouse.
• Find out about the organization. It
you're considering joining a frater
nity, realize that you have a difficult
time regaining your privilege of living
in University housing. Check out all
the alternatives. Maybe you should
wait a year.
Have the following questions an
swered by a fraternity member for
you:
• What programming does the or
ganization have?
• How much money does it cost?
• What community service has the
organization done in the last year?
• How much money was budgeted for
rush? How much of that was for
alcohol? Why so much?
• Why are most of the members
Caucasian?
Whatever, make sure you take
advantage of rush and meet many
people. Please think about it more
seriously than I did. No fraternity is
perfect, but each has its own
strengths. Find these strengths, con
sider the alternatives and then make
an intelligent decision.

In your front page article of April
9, "Conference attracts 4000," Eric
Diesel of Students for Mondale
charges that Gary Hart does not
support national gay rights legislation.
I must respond.
Gary Hart is against the discrimina
tion practiced against gay and lesbian
Americans. In his policy paper on gay
and lesbian civil rights he states that
as president he would:
• Enact an Executive Order which
would prohibit discrimination against
gays and lesbians in federal employ
ment.
• Support and sign the Gay Civil
Rights Bill.
• Seek the repeal of anti-gay exclu
sion language in U.S. immigration
laws.
• Oppose the "McDonald Amend
ment" which restricts legal service
advocacy where homosexuality is the
issue.
In addition, several leaders of the
California gay and lesbian community
have endorsed Hart, including San
Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt and
Santa Cruz Mayor John Laird.
I am sorry the Mondale campaign
is built almost entirely upon mis
repcesenting Gary Hart's views. I for
one pledge to run a positive, issue
oriented campaign on campus this
quarter and I urge all members of the
Stanford community to join me in
that pledge.

Who owns Hart?
Among the issues which should be
on the table as the presidential prima
ries continue is an appropriate federal
investigatory procedure for official
misconduct allegations. Certainly,
officials should not be unduly
deterred from executing, in good
faith, the responsibilities of their
respective offices. Congressional and
executive agency investigations,
however, should be candid with and
loyal to their employers, the Ameri
can public, in marshalling, reporting
and distributing facts obtained.
As ostensible co-author of the
Schweiker Senate Intelligence Report
investigating the Kennedy assassina
tion, Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.)
became a leading figure in a cam
paign to subvert the report and to
place its integrity in doubt.
In April 1976, when the Schweiker
report findings were announced. Hart
told the press the committee un
covered no evidence to question the
fact that Oswald was the lone assas
sin, seriously diminishing the impact
of the historic determination by the

Senate committee which invalidated
the Warren Commission Report and
called for a serious investigation.
Upon release of the full report to the
media, only Sens. Church and
Schweiker were present. (CBS had
informed Schweiker earlier in the day
that Hart was going to boycott the
press conference.) Schweiker was not
appointed to the permanent Senate
Intelligence Committee, Hart was. In
addition, certain "special interest"
groups targeted Church as unfit for
the Senate and poured large sums,
successfully, into his election defeat.)
Did Hart simply have a rapid
change of heart (no pun intended) or
did someone persuade him, volun
tarily or involuntarily, to reverse his
position on the assassination report.
The American public deserves to
know if Hart regularly conducts his
political affairs in this manner, or is
some other invisible hand pulling
Hart's political strings?
If it becomes widely known that
candidate Hart believes the Warren
Commission Assassination Report is
valid, by any standards, Hart's sup
port will vanish faster than a TV pilot
program with low first-week ratings.
Whether Hart will even discuss the
matter in public forum will indicate
who reaily owns Gary Hart.
Finally, in violation of established
principles of International Law,
United Nations Resolutions and
well-settled agreements among the
great religions of the world, Gary
