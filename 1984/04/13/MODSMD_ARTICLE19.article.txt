# Programs let pre-meds see doctors' world
## 
### DEBBIE CRANE 
For undergraduates, the
pre-med education consists
mainly of fat textbooks and a
lot of hard work. Not until
medical school do most stu
dents actually experience
what will eventually be their
lifetime career.
Two programs here, the
Day With a Doctor program
and Emergency Room Obser
vation program, provide under
graduates with a chance to
view the medical profession
first-hand.
The Day With a Doctor
program gives undergradu
ates a chance to spend a day
at the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic finding out the
everyday responsibilities of
doctors in a variety of
specialties, while the Emer
gency Room (ER) Observa
tion program allows students
to see the more technical,
procedure-side of medicine.
Initiated by Dr. Ronald
Kaye, director of medical
education, and Peggy Kent,
from the Academic Informa
tion Center, the Day With a
Doctor program was de
signed to meet the following
goals:
• to give students the op
portunity to look at the
reality of the medical setting.
• to let students see and
feel the experience of the
formation of the pa
tient/doctor relationship.
• to allow students to get
first-hand information about
particular fields.
• to give students the op
portunity to establish a rela
tionship with a doctor in the
community for future advise
or to answer future questions
students might have.
Interested students sign up
for a doctor with the

specialty of their choice at
the Pre-Medical Office of the
AIC. The AIC contacts the
doctor and informs him that
a particular student will be
getting in touch with him.
Then the student calls the
doctor and the two of them
arrange a convenient time
and day.
I he program, now in its
fourth year, has been
deemed by many to be a suc-

cess. According to Kathy
Chavira, pre-professional
advising assistant at the AIC,
there are currrently about 45
doctors from the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic who have
volunteered to take two stu
dents per quarter.
Both students, doctors and
patients have all given posi
tive responses to the pro

gram, according to Chavira,
who has been involved with
the program for two years.
"The student responses have
been positive across the
board. They differ only in the
degree of excitement about
the program," Chavira said.
She also mentioned that
students often find the pro
gram to be an inspirational
boost in the middle of a diffi
cult quarter. "It gives them

something concrete to be
working for," she said.
Freshman Ted Tasch is
one of the many pre-meds
who has taken advantage of
the program. He had the op
portunity to spend the day
with Dr. Charles Arnold,
whose specialty is oncol
ogy/hemotology. Said Tasch
of the experience, "You get

to know what a doctor actu
ally does day by day, the
phone calls, the piles of
paperwork on his desk. But
you also see the importance
of psychology, knowing how
to deal with people."
Overall, Tasch said he felt
it was a very interesting ex
perience and an excellent
chance to get to know a doc
tor in the community. Said
Tasch, "It gave me a chance

to meet the person behind
the profession."
That the doctors also en
joy the program is shown by
their continued participation.
Kaye, who is still actively in
volved in the program,
noted, "the doctors derive
satisfaction from helping
with the career decisions of
students."

Referring to his personal
experience with students in
the program, he said, "It
adds dimension to my under
standing of the profession."
Kaye added that his patients
were usually pleased to have
the students there. "The
patients like to see the moti
vation of the students," he
said.
The ER Observation pro
gram has been equally suc
cessful. About'loo students
per year participate in this
program which is run
through the AIC in conjunc
tion with the Emergency De
partment at the Stanford
Medical Center.
According to ftuby Ma
son, currently an advising
consultant with the AIC,
"the program grew out of an
effort to give undergraduates
exposure to medical settings.
One goal of the program is to
show that emergency room
care is a prominent and
growing part of health care."
The program worked out
between the AIC and the
Emergency Department al
lows for one student to ob
serve during the 3 to 11 p.m.
shift every day including
weekends. Because of the
great number of new interns
and medical students during
the fall quarter, the ER Ob
servation program is held
only during the other two
quarters to avoid confusion
in the emergency room.
The program is renewed
on a year-to-year basis. Every
year so far the Stanford
Medical Clinic has been
happy with the program and
has agreed to continue it.
According to Mason, prob
lems with students while in

the emergency room occur
once a year at most. "There
is an open exchange with the
Emergency Department so
that similar problems in the
future can he averted."
The student's day begins
with a stop by the AIC to
pick up a lab coat and name
tag on his way to the emer
gency room. He reports to
the nursing station by 3 p.m.
on his scheduled day. The
student may be assigned to
go around with the head resi
dent. or, on less busy days,
he may be allowed to move
around freely and observe
wherever he chooses.
Sophomore Hob Diek
roeger participated in the
program and said it was a
verv worthwhile experience.
Diekroeger said he felt
that one value of the pro
gram was the opportunity to
see if he could handle the
sometimes unpleasant scenes
which occur in the emer
gency room. He said that
"the F.R program allowed
me to observe the hands-on
part of medicine, and to see
if I could handle the blood."
The AIC tells students that
eating on the day of observa
tion is important to avoid
dizziness when observing
open wounds or lacerations
in a closed room.
Diekroeger has also par
ticipated in the Day with a
Doctor program, and said he
feels that each program
helped him with his career
decision in a different way.
The Day with a Doctor pro
gram shows the doc
tor/patient relationship while
the ER Observation program
focuses on the procedures of
medicine in an emergency
room setting.
