# USW to vote on union affiliation
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
The University and United Stanford Workers (USW)
are in sharp disagreement over the validity of a referen
dum election USW is holding which would change the law
ful representative of the USW bargaining unit.
USW will hold an election Wednesday to "approve a
transfer of collective bargaining rights from Local 715 to
Local 680" according to Mary Ann Tenuto, labor consul
tant to the USW.
Local 715 of the Service Employees International
Union (SLIIJ) serves approximately 9000 members in
Santa Clara County, while Local 680. if approved, would
exclusively respresent the USW bargaining unit here.

Priscilla Wheeler, University staff counsel, charged that
the scheduled election is not being carried out according to
legal disaffiliation procedures. She said literature dis
seminated by the union is misleading and coercive in its
claims that voting against Local 680 may result in the loss
of the union contract.
Tenuto claims that the USW is conducting the election
properly. "The type ol election we ate conducting is in ac
cordance with federal labor law policy, she said.
USW, when first organized in 1973. was chartered as
Local 680 of SEIU. In 1980, Local 680 was dissolved and
USW instead became affiliated with Local 715.
According to Tenuto. the change was made loi adminis
trative reasons. "USW felt it would be administratively
convenient to affiliate." she said.
Four years later USW feels it would have more
autonomy and be able to better serve the interests ot the
Stanford bargaining unit it it had its own chaitei back.
Tenuto said that USW. as the sole bargaining unit in Local
680. w ill have "more direct control of decision making, m
cluding the hiring and tiring ot stall and union dues and
thus be more responsive to the needs ot Stanford woikers.

The current leadership of the USW was elected in
December on the platform of disaffiliating its bargaining
unit from Local 715 and reinstituting Local 680. On Feb.
3, the SEIU reissued Local 680's charter in "the interests
of both local unions." Shortly afterwards, Michael Baratz,
executive secretary of Local 715, asked the University to
recognize Local 680 as the representive of USW in its
standing collective agreement with Stanford.
The University refused. Wheeler said it would be illegal
for the University to recognize any group other than the
legal representative of the bargaining unit, which she
claimed is still Local 715. "If it's a legitimate affiliation or
disaffiliation election, then that's an internal union mat
ter," she said.
Wheeler said she does not feel that the forthcoming
election is legitimate. She listed four conditions she said
she feels are necessary for the election to be recognized —
notice of the election to all members of the bargaining
unit, adequate time for discussion, a clear statement of the
issue and a fairly conducted vote.
Tenuto said the USW had prepared "far in excess of
what may be required." She said notice had been mailed
first class to every member of the bargaining unit 17 to 18
days prior to the scheduled date, which she said was much
earlier than the law requires. She said that reminders had
also been mailed, also through first class mail, and that
union meetings had been held all over campus to allow op
portunity for discussion.
According to Tenuto, the Ijallot will read roughly as fol
lows: "Do you want Stanford University to recognize
Local 680 of SEIU for the purposes of collective bargain
ing on your behalf and to administer and enforce your con
tract?"
Wheeler claimed that this is not enough. She said that
the real issue was whether employees would rather be
represented by Local 7 15 or 680 and that the ballot mea
sure did not clearly explain that such a choice even exists.
Even if the vote were to be in favor of Local 680's author
ity. Wheeler claims it "would not be a valid election."
She said that until the time a legitimate disaffiliation
vote is held, Stanford will continue to recognize Local 715
as the legal representative of the bargaining unit.
"It Stanford were to recognize Local 680 without a dis
affiliation election, then we would be guilty of an unfair
labor practice." she said.
According to Wheeler. Stanford has already tiled unfair
labor practice charges against both locals with the National
Labor Relations Board for attempting to disaffiliate with
out first holding an election.
