# In search of the perfect California escape
## 
### JEFF MALTZMAN, SUZANNE FAUNCE, JOHN SAGE BRENDA PASCOE 
California is an ideal setting
for the perfect romantic vaca
tion escape. In what other West
ern state can a romance-seeking
traveler enjoy the cool ocean
breeze, ski down the steepest
mountains, hike through Na
tional Forests, rock climb along
the face of a majestic waterfall,
visit some of the best wineries in

the United States and top each
pleasantly exhausting day off
with a scrumptious meal at some
of the finest restaurants in exis
tence? Northern California of
fers all this and more.
In this article we explore the
glorious Northern California
coastal town of Mendocino and
the bustling town of South Lake
Tahoe. In part two (to be
featured next Friday, April 20),
we discover the glamour and
serenity of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains and the incom
parable natural beauty of the
Yosemite Valley.
Perched high amongst the
forested hills overlooking the
rugged Mendocino coast lies
what may be the most unique
inn in all of California. At first
glance it appears to be more of a
Hollywood Wild West set than a
quaint, elegant hotel.
The owners of Blackberry Inn
have recreated the romance and

adventure of the Wild West.
I heir goal in building the inn
was to recreate a highly roman
ticized version of a frontier
town, circa 1870.
Blackberry Inn is comprised
of a series of attached cottages,
each with a full facade of a dif
ferent building of a wild west
town. At Blackberry you don't

stay in a numbered room;
rather, you stay in the Sheriffs
Office, the Livery Stable, the
Saloon or the Town Brothel.
While the Mendocino coast in
and of itself is rugged, beautiful
and romantic, the magical Wild
West atmosphere at Blackberry
enhances the magic of the area.
An infectious spirit of adventure
lives on here.
The owners of Blackberry, an
architect and an interior design
er, have successfully carried
the bewitching charm from the
exterior western facades to the
intimate, luxurious interiors.
Each cottage is unique and dis
tinctive in design.
The comrtion denominator in
all Blackberry's rooms is
quality. All have beautiful rich
interior#, decorated with an
tique style furnishings to match
the 1800s atmosphere.
Over half of,the rooms have
wood-burning fireplaces or iron

stoves, and several are equipped
with huge sunken Roman bath
tubs. Upon arrival guests find
logs in the fireplace,
waiting to be lit. The
sunken baths come with com
plimentary bubble bath.
Room rates at Blackberry are
surprisingly affordable and start
at only $55 per night for a room

with either a king or two twin
size beds and a tub/shower com
bination. Fireplace rooms with a
Roman tub include the Milli
nary ($75) and the
handicapped-equipped Bank
($7O).
The most luxurious room at
Blackberry is Belle's Place, the
local brothel. It features a four
poster bed with a slightly sinful
painting over the headboard,
fireplace, sunken tub,
kitchenette and dining area
overlooking the sea for $95.
The Inn's small size allows the
hosts to take that extra step to
make sure their guests enjoy
their stay. Each morning fresh
fruit and homemade banana nut
bread are placed in each of the
13 rooms.
AII rooms at Black berry lui vjef
extraordinary views overlooking
the sea and include a sitting area
by the window. For a truly
unique romantic adventure visit

the Blackberry Inn. Reserva
tions can be made directly by
calling (707) 937-5281.
If you desire a more "urban
look" at peaceful Mendocino,
the downtown Mendocino
Hotel offers the ideal overall
ambience of comfort, elegance
and historic appeal. The hotel
has a colorful past. During the
1870 sit served first as a board
ing house for loggers and then
as one of Mendocino's 17 bor
dellos.
This Victorian style hotel now
boasts 26 renovated rooms,
some with private baths and
ocean views, a luxurious
fireplace lounge, a bright sunny
greenhouse restaurant, and the
notably charming main dining
room with some of the best
seafood in town.
The hotel is located in the
heart of Mendocino's cultural
district. It is surrounded by
numerous art galleries,
boutiques, antique shops and
mouthwatering bakeries.
The 19th-century Western ex
terior resembles the old brothels
of the Bonanza era, while the
interior atmosphere is one of
leisure, quiet and antique
beauty. The fragile, historical
character of this hotel is as
jealously guarded and preserved
as the coastal village itself.
Upon entering the main
lobby, the traveler is greeted by
the warmth of the elegant soft
sofa chairs, hard wood floors
and antique rugs. The lobby's
glowing fireplace serves as a
gathering spot for hotel guests.
Hot coffees as well as bar drinks
are available.
The Mendocino Hotel is large
enough to have the amenities of
a hotel, yet small enough to of
fer the comforts and personal
attention of a bed and breakfast.
It is ideal for romantic couples.
The elegant hotel dining
room is a must for any visitor,
even those choosing to stay else
where. The menu includes a
wide selection of fresh seafood
dishes as well as some of the
best beef and lamb north of San
Francisco. The pasta and
chicken entrees are also excep
tional. The cost of entrees range
from $8 to $1 5. We also recom
mend the mushroom appetizers
sauteed in blue cheese and yar
lic-ttmJ. tlic ciic.sai suluU tor two.
The wine list features a v/ide "a
riety of excellent local wints.
The rooms are also intimately
decorated, although many of

them are too small to accommo
date the elegant furnishings.
The room rates tend to be a
little on the high side, but one
pays for the convenient location
as well as the excellent reputa
tion the lodge has built for itself.
Rates start at $45 (shared bath)
to $140 for a suite.
A nearby spot worth noting is
a small cafe called the Choco
late Mousse. It is an ideal spot
for a relaxing, quiet breakfast.
Located just around the corner
from the hotel, the Chocolate
Mousse features an exquisite
choice of cakes, fresh breads
and bagels, croissants, juices
and coffees. The cafe is a small
family-run establishment where
one can sit for hours, happily
watching the waves and day go
by.
During the first century of
Mendocino's existence, the
town depended on the logging
and fishing industry for its eco
nomic support. At one time
there were as many as 3500
residents, eight hotels, 17
saloons and over 15 bordellos.
The town is now populated by
only 1100 people and has
achieved the status of a cozy,
sleepy, comfortable town sur
rounded by natural beauty, fine
food and friendly people. The
Mendocino Hotel exemplifies
the history and development of
this coastal town. For reserva
tions at the hotel call (707) 937-
0511.

Continuing our quest for
romantic hideaways, we next
turned our attention to the bus
tling town of South Lake Tahoe.
Tahoe provides a very different
type of romantic escape from
the quiet Mendocino coast.
South Lake Tahoe is an ener
getic resort town on the south
ern shore of majestic Lake
Tahoe and bordering the
Nevada state line.
South Lake Tahoe has
numerous attractions including
skiing, hiking, and gambling in
the nearby glittering casinos.
The larger casinos offer top en
tertainment nightly. The Station
House Inn provides an ideal
spot to stay.
The Inn is only a few blocks
from the hustle and bustle of the
gambling casinos, yet is tucked
away from the noise and traffic
of the strip. It only a half
block away from the lake.
During the warm months the
hotel has a private beach just a
few minutes walk away.
It is important to note that the
Station House Inn is not a small,
quaint guest house. It is instead
a high quality large hotel. Its
large size, while greatly reduc
ing its romantic qualities,
enables it to feature a first- class
restaurant, year-round hot tub
and swimming pool.
Free shuttle transportation is
available to the airport, the

casinos and the nearby ski
slopes, for those of you intend
ing to take advantage of special
Easter-weekend skiing
packages. Ski season in the
Tahoe basin often extends well
into late spring and the weather
is warm enough for waterskiing
as early as the end of April.
The Inn features a cozy ski
chalet style restaurant ideal
after a long day on the slopes or
a relaxing day sunbathing on the
shores of the lake. Upon first
sitting down, a complimentary
bowl of hot cheese fondue and
bread is served. The reasonably
priced menu includes a wide va
riety of steak and seafood items.
Station House's commitment
to quality is reflected in its four
diamond award from the AAA
and their Best Western Golden
Crown Award. The rooms are
typical sterile hotel rooms,
featuring remote control color
cable TV.
Room rates start at $54 per
night double occupancy for
rooms with a queen-sized bed.
King-size bedrooms are $64.
For reservations call toll-free
(800) 822-5953 or see your
travel agent.

If you desire a more "urban
look" at peaceful Mendocino,
the downtown Mendocino
Hotel offers the ideal overall
ambience of comfort, elegance
and historic appeal. The hotel
has a colorful past. During the
1870 sit served first as a board
ing house for loggers and then
as one of Mendocino's 17 bor
dellos.
This Victorian style hotel now
boasts 26 renovated rooms,
some with private baths and
ocean views, a luxurious
fireplace lounge, a bright sunny
greenhouse restaurant, and the
notably charming main dining
room with some of the best
seafood in town.
The hotel is located in the
heart of Mendocino's cultural
district. It is surrounded by
numerous art galleries,
boutiques, antique shops and
mouthwatering bakeries.
The 19th-century Western ex
terior resembles the old brothels
of the Bonanza era, while the
interior atmosphere is one of
leisure, quiet and antique
beauty. The fragile, historical
character of this hotel is as
jealously guarded and preserved
as the coastal village itself.
Upon entering the main
lobby, the traveler is greeted by
the warmth of the elegant soft
sofa chairs, hard wood floors
and antique rugs. The lobby's
glowing fireplace serves as a
gathering spot for hotel guests.
Hot coffees as well as bar drinks
are available.
The Mendocino Hotel is large
enough to have the amenities of
a hotel, yet small enough to of
fer the comforts and personal
attention of a bed and breakfast.
It is ideal for romantic couples.
The elegant hotel dining
room is a must for any visitor,
even those choosing to stay else
where. The menu includes a
wide selection of fresh seafood
dishes as well as some of the
best beef and lamb north of San
Francisco. The pasta and
chicken entrees are also excep
tional. The cost of entrees range
from $8 to $1 5. We also recom
mend the mushroom appetizers
sauteed in blue cheese and yar
lic-ttmJ. tlic ciic.sai suluU tor two.
The wine list features a v/ide "a
riety of excellent local wints.
The rooms are also intimately
decorated, although many of

them are too small to accommo
date the elegant furnishings.
The room rates tend to be a
little on the high side, but one
pays for the convenient location
as well as the excellent reputa
tion the lodge has built for itself.
Rates start at $45 (shared bath)
to $140 for a suite.
A nearby spot worth noting is
a small cafe called the Choco
late Mousse. It is an ideal spot
for a relaxing, quiet breakfast.
Located just around the corner
from the hotel, the Chocolate
Mousse features an exquisite
choice of cakes, fresh breads
and bagels, croissants, juices
and coffees. The cafe is a small
family-run establishment where
one can sit for hours, happily
watching the waves and day go
by.
During the first century of
Mendocino's existence, the
town depended on the logging
and fishing industry for its eco
nomic support. At one time
there were as many as 3500
residents, eight hotels, 17
saloons and over 15 bordellos.
The town is now populated by
only 1100 people and has
achieved the status of a cozy,
sleepy, comfortable town sur
rounded by natural beauty, fine
food and friendly people. The
Mendocino Hotel exemplifies
the history and development of
this coastal town. For reserva
tions at the hotel call (707) 937-

Continuing our quest for
romantic hideaways, we next
turned our attention to the bus
tling town of South Lake Tahoe.
Tahoe provides a very different
type of romantic escape from
the quiet Mendocino coast.
South Lake Tahoe is an ener
getic resort town on the south
ern shore of majestic Lake
Tahoe and bordering the
Nevada state line.
South Lake Tahoe has
numerous attractions including
skiing, hiking, and gambling in
the nearby glittering casinos.
The larger casinos offer top en
tertainment nightly. The Station
House Inn provides an ideal
spot to stay.
The Inn is only a few blocks
from the hustle and bustle of the
gambling casinos, yet is tucked
away from the noise and traffic
of the strip. It only a half
block away from the lake.
During the warm months the
hotel has a private beach just a
few minutes walk away.
It is important to note that the
Station House Inn is not a small,
quaint guest house. It is instead
a high quality large hotel. Its
large size, while greatly reduc
ing its romantic qualities,
enables it to feature a first- class
restaurant, year-round hot tub
and swimming pool.
Free shuttle transportation is
available to the airport, the

casinos and the nearby ski
slopes, for those of you intend
ing to take advantage of special
Easter-weekend skiing
packages. Ski season in the
Tahoe basin often extends well
into late spring and the weather
is warm enough for waterskiing
as early as the end of April.
The Inn features a cozy ski
chalet style restaurant ideal
after a long day on the slopes or
a relaxing day sunbathing on the
shores of the lake. Upon first
sitting down, a complimentary
bowl of hot cheese fondue and
bread is served. The reasonably
priced menu includes a wide va
riety of steak and seafood items.
Station House's commitment
to quality is reflected in its four
diamond award from the AAA
and their Best Western Golden
Crown Award. The rooms are
typical sterile hotel rooms,
featuring remote control color
cable TV.
Room rates start at $54 per
night double occupancy for
rooms with a queen-sized bed.
King-size bedrooms are $64.

Views of the sea are only a part of the pleasure awaiting you at Blackberry Inn in Men
docino.

The facades of the 13 rooms at Blackberry Inn are designed to represent buildings of the
Western frontier days in the late 1800s.
California is an ideal setting
for the perfect romantic vaca
tion escape. In what other West
ern state can a romance-seeking
traveler enjoy the cool ocean
breeze, ski down the steepest
mountains, hike through Na
tional Forests, rock climb along
the face of a majestic waterfall,
visit some of the best wineries in

the United States and top each
pleasantly exhausting day off
with a scrumptious meal at some
of the finest restaurants in exis
tence? Northern California of
fers all this and more.
In this article we explore the
glorious Northern California
coastal town of Mendocino and
the bustling town of South Lake
Tahoe. In part two (to be
featured next Friday, April 20),
we discover the glamour and
serenity of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains and the incom
parable natural beauty of the
Yosemite Valley.
Perched high amongst the
forested hills overlooking the
rugged Mendocino coast lies
what may be the most unique
inn in all of California. At first
glance it appears to be more of a
Hollywood Wild West set than a
quaint, elegant hotel.
The owners of Blackberry Inn
have recreated the romance and

adventure of the Wild West.
I heir goal in building the inn
was to recreate a highly roman
ticized version of a frontier
town, circa 1870.
Blackberry Inn is comprised
of a series of attached cottages,
each with a full facade of a dif
ferent building of a wild west
town. At Blackberry you don't

stay in a numbered room;
rather, you stay in the Sheriffs
Office, the Livery Stable, the
Saloon or the Town Brothel.
While the Mendocino coast in
and of itself is rugged, beautiful
and romantic, the magical Wild
West atmosphere at Blackberry
enhances the magic of the area.
An infectious spirit of adventure
lives on here.
The owners of Blackberry, an
architect and an interior design
er, have successfully carried
the bewitching charm from the
exterior western facades to the
intimate, luxurious interiors.
Each cottage is unique and dis
tinctive in design.
The comrtion denominator in
all Blackberry's rooms is
quality. All have beautiful rich
interior#, decorated with an

of the Bonanza era, while the
interior atmosphere is one of
leisure, quiet and antique
beauty. The fragile, historical
character of this hotel is as
jealously guarded and preserved
as the coastal village itself.
Upon entering the main
lobby, the traveler is greeted by
the warmth of the elegant soft
sofa chairs, hard wood floors
and antique rugs. The lobby's
glowing fireplace serves as a
gathering spot for hotel guests.
Hot coffees as well as bar drinks
are available.
The Mendocino Hotel is large
enough to have the amenities of
a hotel, yet small enough to of
fer the comforts and personal
attention of a bed and breakfast.
It is ideal for romantic couples.
The elegant hotel dining
room is a must for any visitor,
even those choosing to stay else
where. The menu includes a
wide selection of fresh seafood
dishes as well as some of the
best beef and lamb north of San
Francisco. The pasta and
chicken entrees are also excep
tional. The cost of entrees range
from $8 to $1 5. We also recom
mend the mushroom appetizers
sauteed in blue cheese and yar
lic-ttmJ. tlic ciic.sai suluU tor two.
The wine list features a v/ide "a
riety of excellent local wints.
The rooms are also intimately
decorated, although many of

them are too small to accommo
date the elegant furnishings.
The room rates tend to be a
little on the high side, but one
pays for the convenient location
as well as the excellent reputa
tion the lodge has built for itself.
Rates start at $45 (shared bath)
to $140 for a suite.
A nearby spot worth noting is
a small cafe called the Choco
late Mousse. It is an ideal spot
for a relaxing, quiet breakfast.
Located just around the corner
from the hotel, the Chocolate
Mousse features an exquisite
choice of cakes, fresh breads
and bagels, croissants, juices
and coffees. The cafe is a small
family-run establishment where
one can sit for hours, happily
watching the waves and day go
by.
During the first century of
Mendocino's existence, the
town depended on the logging
and fishing industry for its eco
nomic support. At one time
there were as many as 3500
residents, eight hotels, 17
saloons and over 15 bordellos.
The town is now populated by
only 1100 people and has
achieved the status of a cozy,
sleepy, comfortable town sur
rounded by natural beauty, fine
food and friendly people. The
Mendocino Hotel exemplifies
the history and development of
this coastal town. For reserva
tions at the hotel call (707) 937-

Continuing our quest for
romantic hideaways, we next
turned our attention to the bus
tling town of South Lake Tahoe.
Tahoe provides a very different
type of romantic escape from
the quiet Mendocino coast.
South Lake Tahoe is an ener
getic resort town on the south
ern shore of majestic Lake
Tahoe and bordering the
Nevada state line.
South Lake Tahoe has
numerous attractions including
skiing, hiking, and gambling in
the nearby glittering casinos.
The larger casinos offer top en
tertainment nightly. The Station
House Inn provides an ideal
spot to stay.
The Inn is only a few blocks
from the hustle and bustle of the
gambling casinos, yet is tucked
away from the noise and traffic
of the strip. It only a half
block away from the lake.
During the warm months the
hotel has a private beach just a
few minutes walk away.
It is important to note that the
Station House Inn is not a small,
quaint guest house. It is instead
a high quality large hotel. Its
large size, while greatly reduc
ing its romantic qualities,
enables it to feature a first- class
restaurant, year-round hot tub
and swimming pool.
Free shuttle transportation is
available to the airport, the

casinos and the nearby ski
slopes, for those of you intend
ing to take advantage of special
Easter-weekend skiing
packages. Ski season in the
Tahoe basin often extends well
into late spring and the weather
is warm enough for waterskiing
as early as the end of April.
The Inn features a cozy ski
chalet style restaurant ideal
after a long day on the slopes or
a relaxing day sunbathing on the
shores of the lake. Upon first
sitting down, a complimentary
bowl of hot cheese fondue and
bread is served. The reasonably
priced menu includes a wide va
riety of steak and seafood items.
Station House's commitment
to quality is reflected in its four
diamond award from the AAA
and their Best Western Golden
Crown Award. The rooms are
typical sterile hotel rooms,
featuring remote control color
cable TV.
Room rates start at $54 per
night double occupancy for
rooms with a queen-sized bed.
King-size bedrooms are $64.
