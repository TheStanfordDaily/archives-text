## Marquess looks for 300th win Playoff push starts for Card 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The Stanford baseball team
has to expect a better fate this
weekend than it received the
last one.
I he Cardinal had better
receive something better or its
post-season playoff hopes, near
extinction after Pacific-10
Southern Division leader
Arizona State defeated it three
times a week ago, will be
bevond resuscitation.
Today marks the beginning of
the second half of the Pac-10
season, as the Cardinal plays
host to the University of
Arizona lor a three-game series
at Sunken Diamond.
This week's invader from the
state of Arizona is. fortunately,
much less formidable than
Arizona State, which vaulted to

the No. 1-ranking in the nation
after its sweep of Stanford. This
Arizona team, the Wildcats, is
currently fourth in the Pac-10
Southern Division with a 6-9
record, 17-26 overall.
Two of those six conference
wins came at the expense of the
Cardinal when Arizona took
two out of three games in each
team's "Six-Pae" debut at
Arizona in early March. Since
then, the Wildcats have found
the hunting less bountiful, in
cluding two losses to fifth-place
UCLA last week.
The Card. meanwhile,
launched a six-game league win
ning streak to climb into second
before dropping its next six con
tests to ASU and USC. The
result is a 7-8 conference mark
and a 24-18-1 season record.

good enough to harbor hopes ot
a second-place finish and an au
tomatic NCAA playoff bid or an
at-large berth with a third-place
finish.
A near miracle must be in the
Cards to pull it off. but a few
wins over Arizona, 1-8 when
away from Tucson, would be a
down payment on that miracle.
Arizona may also be the payoff
of eight years ot hard work for
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess. Marquess will be
going after his 300 th win on the
Farm today, but his real aim is a
playoff spot.
"Our goal is to win every se
ries from now on and get some
help from someone else (in the
conference)," he said earlier
this week.
Marquess, whose eight-year
record at Stanford is 299-165-3
(a .644 winniug percentage),
will look first to his junior
southpaw Jeff Ballard (4-4) lor
immediate help. Ballard
defeated the Wildcats in relief
earlier this year and will face
Arizona's ace, lefty Joe
Magrane (6-5, 3.73 earned run
average) in today's series
opener. Magrane leads the
league with 78 strikeouts and six
complete games.
"He's a lot like Ballard,"
Marquess said of Magrane.
"He's got good control, he
changes speed on you and is
more of a finesse pitcher."
After Magrane, the Wildcats
are suspect on the mound as
their 6.89 team ERA, worst in
the conference, indicates. Darell
Huenneke (1-4, 5.67 ERA) and
Kevin Blankenship (4-2, 5.66
ERA) are the probable starters
in games two and three.
When the Wildcats win they
win with offense. The Card
found that out in Tucson when
Arizona cranked out 36 runs in
three games. Marquess recalls
that series and remains wary of
Arizona's attack.
"They hit the ball extremely
well against us (in the first se
ries) and they got a lot of extra

base hits. We've got to control
them better than we did down
there," Marquess said.
Surprisingly. Arizona has
only 25 home runs — even
worse than the Card's paltry
total of 26. The Cats like to
make up tor their lack of power
with speed on the base paths,
according to the Stanford
manager.
All-conference shortstop
Bobby Ralston leads the attack
with a .370 batting'average and
a league-leading seven triples.
Stanford counters with a
group of five .300 hitters and a
new batting leader in sopho
more Mike Deßenon. Deßenon
picked on non-league pitching
during the week to raise his
average to .357. Ruben Amaro,
Jr. and Rick Lundblade are next
in line at .344 and .336,
respectively, while Darryl Step
hens (.319) and Pete Stanicek
(.315) round out the Cardinal
offense.
Lunblade has grabbed the
headlines of late with a team
leading six home runs and the
league's fifth best RBI total at
39, but Stanicek leads the club
in just about every other cate
gory, including consistency.
The junior second baseman,
who recently had a hitting
streak that began against
Arizona but was snapped at 16
games, leads the club in stolen
bases, runs scored, hits, triples
and walks. During that span he
hit .343 and clubbed four home
runs.
Consistency has also been the
trademark of senior John
Radtke, Stanford' s pitching
ace. Radtke will carry a 6-1
record and a 2.87 ERA, fifth
best in the "Six-Pac," to the
mound when he faces the
Wildcats tomorrow afternoon.
Marquess has not named his
starter for the final game on
Sunday.
Today's contest gets under
way at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow and
Sunday's games begin at 1 p.m.


Stanford Head Coach Mark Marquess will be looking for his
300 th victory today, which would make him only the second
Cardinal manager to reach that milestone.

The Cardinal will have to sweep more than the infield if it expects to get a shot at a post
season playoff bterth.
