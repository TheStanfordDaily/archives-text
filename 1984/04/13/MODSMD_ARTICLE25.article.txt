# Netmen look for 1-2 punch in Los Angeles
## 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
This is the critical weekend for the Stanford
men's tennis team as it travels to Los Angeles to
face No. I-ranked UCLA and No. 2-ranked USC.
The Cardinal is currently ranked third in the
NCAA.
Head Coach Dick Gould is optimistic, but at
the same time, he is also aware of the difficulties
facing the team. "I'm really pleased with our
singles play," he said.
But he also indicated that the doubles teams
will have to pUy more consistently than they have
if the Cardinal ixpects to win this weekend.
After seeing the NCAA doubles standings, it is
easy to understand Gould's concern. USC has
both the No. I and No. 2 teams and its third
doubles team is ranked No. 26. UCLA, mean
while, has two pairs in the top 30. The only Stan
ford pair ranked in the top 36 is the team of Jim
Grabb and John Letts, which is eighth.
But the singles standings don't present a more
optimistic picture for the Cardinal either. USC
has three players in the top 10: Todd Wilsken at
No. 5; Rick Leach, a freshman, at No. 7; and Matt
Anger at No. 9.
According to Gould, the Trojans are very ag
gressive and run well on the court. Because this
style is typical of many Stanford players, one im
portant factor will be whether the Cardinal can
force the Trojans to change tactics and play
defensively.
UCLA stars Jeff Klaparda and Mike Kures are
ranked No. II and No. 12, respectively. Mark
Bashan and Chuck Willenborg are also ranked in
the top 100 for the Bruins. Unlike USC, the
Bruins tend to challenge their opponents from the
base line.
But UCLA's Head Coach Glenn Bassett said
he feels his team's strength lies mainly with the
starting lineup.
"We don't have a superstar like in years past.
But we're deep. We're solid all the way through,"
he said. In other words, even if the top players
lose, the Bruins aren't sunk.
By comparison, Eric Rosenfeld is the highest

ranked Cardinal at No. 17, followed by Dan
Goldie at No. 26 and Jim Grabb at No. 29. Gould
noted that all three players have improved greatly
since the rankings were compiled last week and
will undoubtedly move up when the rankings
come out again next week.
While USC seems to be a much better team
than UCLA on paper, the Bruins proved last
weekend when the two teams played each other
that they were extremely tough on the court. The
Trojans jumped out to a 4-0 lead and needed only
one more victory to win the match.
But the Bruins refused to accept defeat as they
battled to win the last two singles matches and the
first two of the doubles. In the final match of the
day, after splitting the first two sets, USC eventu
ally prevailed and the Trojans walked away with a
5-4 upset victory. According to the Los Angeles
Times, Trojan Head C6ach Dick Leach called it,
"The greatest USC-UCLA match ever."
UCLA Coach Bassett expressed concern as to
his team's ability to regroup after this draining
match.
"I don't know how our team will react. Our
practices haven't been good this week," he said.
"The personality of a team changes year to year.
Some teams get mad and come back fighting. But
I've seen teams get frustrated and let down and
never come back for the rest of the season. I'm
looking forward to see how they (the Bruins) will
react."
The Cardinal, meanwhile, is on a five-game
winning streak. "I'm very pleased with our prog
ress," Gould said. "From being down 3-0 against
Cal on, we've really improved." Stanford came
back to beat Cal 6-3 and breezed by its next four
opponents. The main test for Stanford tomor
row, then, will be whether it can take advantage of
the Bruins' sudden loss of momentum.
Still, Gould noted how difficult it is to win in
Los Angeles. "In 17 years, we've only won back
to-back victories down there three times. And one
of those times was when (John) McEnroe was
here," he said. "But the critical thing is to be com
petitive."
