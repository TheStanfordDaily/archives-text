Coming oil a successful swing in Southern
California last weekend, the Stanford wo
men's tennis team returns home to open a
five-match WCAA homestand. The Car
dinal opens today by facing Arizona and
takes to the courts again tomorrow when
USC \ isits the Farm.
The netters' last meeting with the Trojans
was Saturday when they handed USC a
5-4 loss. It was only the second loss for the
Trojans in their last 96 matches.
That match was decided when Kate Gom
pert and Michelle Weiss took a quick 6-3, 6-
I decision at second doubles after the Card
had opened up a 4-2 lead in the singles.
T he big win in the singles came at No. 1.
where Patty Fendick captured a tight third
set to defeat Kelly Henry, 6-1, 2-6, 7-5.
Henry, a senior, has been ranked in the top
five nationally for the past four seasons, but
the Stanford freshman hung tough for the
win.
At No. 2 Linda Gates defeated Heliana

Steden by the surprisingly easy score of 6-4,
6-2. There has been talk that USC will
switch Henry and Steden in the lineup to
possibly get a more advantageous matchup,
but nothing has been confirmed.
Also last weekend. Kate Gompert and
Stephanie Savides recorded singles vic
tories, while Leigh Anne Eldredge and
Weiss dropped their matches.
USC will not have the advantage of the
vocal home-court crowd it did Saturday.
Head Coach Frank Brennan said, "The
crowd really got on us. It's something you
don't expect at a tennis match. That crowd
was brutal." The Trojans, however, are a
far, far cry from a pushover. Ranked No. 7
in the country, they will give the Card net
ters a run for their money.
Today's match with Arizona should be
slightly easier. The two teams last met Feb.
I l in Tucson, and the Cardinal took a 6-3
decision. Stanford, however, was playing
without the services of Fendick or Gompert
for that match.
In that match Gates won at No. 1,

F.ldredge moved up to No. 2 and recorded a
straight-set win. Weiss moved up to No. 4
and won handily, and Alyce Werdel moved
into the No. 5 spot in the lineup and took a
6-1, 3-6. 7-5 win. The only two singles
losses came when Savides dropped a match
at No. 3 and Barbara Baughman lost in the
No. 6 spot.
Stanford will he trying to 112 urther entrench
itself in first place in the WCAA. The Car
dinal is currently all alone at the top with a
perfect 10-0 record, and the netters' last
four conference matches are at home. Over
all, the Card is 16-0.
The latest NCAA poll may also give the
netters some incentive this weekend. The
voters dropped Stanford to No. 2 this week
despite Saturday's win at USC and
Monday's 8-1 thrashing of No. 5-ranked
San Diego State. Trinity University (Texas)
moved into the top spot the Card had occu
pied all season.
Today's match is scheduled to begin at
1:30 p.m., with tomorrow's slated for noon.
Both will be played at the Varsity Tennis
Courts.
