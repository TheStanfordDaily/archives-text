# Crenshaw leads Masters
## 
### 
Augusta, Ga. ( AP) — Ben Crenshaw pla\ed
an almost-errorless 5-under-par 67 and took
the lead, one stroke in front of l ee Trevino.
after the first round of the 48th Masters Golt
Tournament yesterday.
"It was a very good round of goll today,
said Crenshaw, so often a challenger hut not
yet a winner in golfs Big Four events.
•But." said the man who is no led among his
peers as one of the finest putters in the game,
"it could have been better.
"I felt like I left a tew shots out there. It
easily could have been two or three shots bet
ter — and that's conservative."
He hit 17 greens, reached two par-5s in two
and did not make a bogey. The problem, said
Crenshaw, lay with the putter, often the most
potent weapon in his arsenal. This time,
however, he made only two putts longer than
30 inches.
"I'm perplexed." said Crenshaw. "I had the
putts at the right angle. I was putting from
where I wanted to be. But 1 just missed em.
The putter hasn't been that good this year."
Trevino, like Crenshaw fascinated with the

possibility of winning this title - * hich ran .

But Trevino. 44. a runnerup in the Tourna

his mind and now ranks a victory in the
Masters as one of his prime goals.

there's 110 place I can t play, he said.
