# Humane societies sue University

### KATHY OLMSTED Daily staff 
Three local humane societies an
nounced yesterday that they are suing
the University, the U.S. Veterans Ad
ministration (VA) Hospital in Palo
Alto and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) for alleged viola
tions of the Animal Welfare Act.
The suit filed by the Palo Alto
Humane Society, the Peninsula
Humane Society and the Humane So
ciety of Santa Clara Valley claims that
a dog which had been the subject of a
research experiment at the VA Hospi
tal last March received improper care.
The suit also claims other dogs and
cats housed at the VA Hospital are
suffering from improper care and asks
the court to force the defendants to
discontinue all animal experimenta

tion until the Animal Welfare Act
standards are met.
University officials declined to com
ment on the suit because they had not
yet seen copies of it.
The suit alleges that the dog, found
by a Stanford medical student after it
escaped from its cage last March, was.
suffering from untreated ulcerated
wounds, pneumonia and dehydration,
among other ailments. The medical
student took the animal to a local
veterinary clinic, where it was
humanely destroyed.
The physician involved in the re
search with the dog and the
veterinarian charged with its care were
from the University. The suit also
names the USDA because that body
has the responsibility for enforcing the
provisions of the Animal Welfare Act.

An internal VA Hospital investiga
tion of the incident determined that
the dog had not been mistreated. The
committee concluded that the dog had
been injured by another dog while it
was recovering from being anes
thetized, and had escaped from its
cage when workmen left a door open.
Officials from the humane societies
said they waited since last year to in
itiate the suit because they have
already pursued all other possible
avenues of legal action. The Santa
Clara County district attorney had
earlier refused to prosecute the case
because of "possible varying inter
pretations of the California Penal
Code," according to the humane
societies.
Lise Giraud, ,an officer of the Palo
Alto Humane Society, said the law

should be changed to "make research
institutions accountable for cruelty to
animals just as individuals are."
Humane society officials claimed
that they are not trying to stop medical
research on animals but are merely
trying to ensure proper care for ex
perimental subjects.
"We're not trying to stop research,"
said Richard Ward, executive director
of the Peninsula Humane Society.
"We're not anti-vivisectionist at all."
Martin Eichner, one of the attor
neys for the humane societies, said the
defendants in the suit have 60 days to
respond after being served.
Eichner said he could not predict
the outcome of the case. "We think
the violations are clear," he said, but
he added that the case has no prece
dent.
