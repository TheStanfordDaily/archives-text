"The Discoverers"
Daniel Boorstin
Random House
$25, 745 pp.
"The Discoverers" is a
massive work, both in size and
in subject. And this may be,
depending on what you try to
get out of the book, either its
blessing or its downfall. It's 745
[ pages, but it tries to take on a lot
| in that space. The subtitle on the
cover says the book is nothing
- less than "a history of man's
search to know his world and
. himself."
If anybody is going to attempt
; to discuss a subject as broad as
the intellectual history of the
world, it had better be Daniel
Boorstin. Presently the Libra
rian of Congress, Boorstin is to
â€¢ resumes what Manhattan is to
phonebooks. He has attended
or taught at a trilling list of uni
versities: Harvard, Yale
the University of Chicago,
Swarthmore, Oxford, Cam
bridge, the Sorbonne, the
University of Rome, Kyoto
University, the University of
Puerto Rico and the University
of Geneva. He is best known for
his trilogy "The Americans,",

the last installment of which
won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973.
I was, needless to say, im
pressed hy the author's creden
tials, but I was even more awed
by the vast scope of knowledge
Boorstin must have to be able to
write a book like "The Dis
coverers." Not only does the
book follow the prehistorians
who discovered the ways of the
heavens and began to regulate
patterns of time, but it lets the
reader ride along with the
Vikings (yes, they did discover
America long before Colombus)
and other brave navigators, as
well as the various scientists,
naturalists, alchemists, doctors,
sociologists and historians who
found out new things about the
world and how life affects it.
If Boorstin has a thesis in this
compendium of facts, dates,
names and anecdotes, it's that
man sure is curious and thank
God for that. You're left with
the overwhelming impression
that if man didn't care what was
over the next hill or why the
stars and moon behave the way
they do, we'd still be walking
around in animal skins and
eating tree bark.
It is this very celebration of

man's sense of curiosity that
makes "The Discoverers" so
much fun to read (and so suc
cessful commercially). Boorstin
is a master storyteller, and he
mixes so many "gee-whiz" facts
in with the stories that you can't
help but admire most of the
characters he describes. The au
thor is obviously in love with
history, and with the desire for
change and discovery that
makes history kinetic, and the
reader is likely to get caught up
in these emotions.
Take, for example, the Fran
ciscan Friar John of Pian de
Carpine (1180-1252). Fie was
commissioned by Pope Innocent
IV in 1245 to travel to Mongolia
to convert the Great Khan,
Kuyuk Khan, to Christianity.
Fiis trek, through snow-bound
Russian steppes and the swel
tering Gobi Desert, was the first
time such a trip had been made
-by a Christian. The Great Khan
received him at his pajace,
admired his fortitude and sent
him back. His return trip was
greeted with boundless praise
by the Europeans, despite the
fact that he had succeeded not a
bit in Christianizing the great
pagan lord.

"The Discoverers" is also a
treasure trove for trivia buffs.
Did you know that the days of
the week are named after the
"planets," as they were known
in Rome 2000 years ago? That's
right, Sunday is named after the
sun, Monday after the moon,
Tuesday after Mars, Wednesday
after Mercury, Thursday after
Jupiter, Friday after Venus and
Saturday after Saturn. The days'
Latin roots confirm this. Or did
you know that the Arabs of the
15th and 16th centuries had
more-developed navigational
systems than the Europeans
who sailed around the tip of
Africa and "discovered" the In
dian Ocean?
"The Discoverers" will be
criticized, and not unfairly, for
taking on much too much. Its
organization, which is generally
chronological, but is arranged
by topic rather than date, is un
conventional and sometimes an
noyingly scrambled. Experts
will rap the author for treating
some subjects with frightening
brevity, given Boorstin's
penchant for often arbitrary or
ganization.
