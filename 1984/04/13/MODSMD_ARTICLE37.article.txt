"The Strength of Art: Poets and Poetry in
the Lives of Yvor Winters and Janet
Lewis"
Edited by Brigitte Hoy Carnochan with an
introduction by N. Scott Momaday
Stanford University Libraries
$15, 47 pp.

Students, faculty and alumni with an interest
in Stanford's history are offered a taste of ma
terials relating to Yvor Winters, one of the
University's most famous professors, in this
catalog to the exhibition that just closed in
the Lurie Rotunda of Green Library. Winters
is known among critics primarily as an in
tensely moralistic judge of texts, a maverick
whose vigorous commitment to his views
rested on his conviction that poetry "is the
finest medium that we have for the exploration
and understanding of the complete human ex
perience." Considered a dogmatist by some.
Winters inspired fierce loyalty and affection
among many of his students and other friends
around the University.
The objects in the exhibition were drawn
from those donated to Stanford by Winters'
wife, Janet Lewis, and it must be emphasized
with praise that the treatment of the materials
did not slight Lewis, an important author in her
own right. Focusing on the couple's work as
poets, and on their relationships with other
writers, rather than on Winters' academic
career, the catalog still provides an intrigu
ing glimpse into an important period in Stan
ford's development as a place for the study of
the humanities.
The catalog only represents a fraction of
the materials available for anyone interested in
Stanford or in Winters or Lewis, and 1 hope it
will provoke examination of the original ma
terial in Special Collections, be it from scholars
or curious members of the University commu
nity.
