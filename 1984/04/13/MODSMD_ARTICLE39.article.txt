## ACT's 'Sleeping Prince' predictable, but pleasant enough 
### MARC FAJER 
••The Sleeping Prince" by Terrence Rat
tigan opened last week at the Geary Theatre
in San Francisco. It is a pleasant enough
piece of fluff, and the American Conser
vatory Theater production is amusing it not
spectacular.
The play is ;i fairy tale of sorts. A pretty,
uncultured American chorus girl (Annette
Bening) full of charm and wit is invited back
to the Carpathian legation by the prince
regent (Peter Donat) of that little Balkan
country for dinner and the usual post-dinner
activities expected of chorus girls. Things
are complicated by important international
business (it is 191 1; there is a crisis in the
Balkans) transacted in front of our heroine,
by the interruptions of the regent's son. the
king (Tom O'Brien), who is 16. dissatisfied
with his father's reactionary rule and plot
ting a coup, and by the appearance of the
regent's wife (Marrian Walters). Our
heroine does not succumb that night and
wakes the next morning and discovers (Oh.
lucky day!) that the regent's wife needs a
lady-in-waiting to go to the coronation, so
she gets to remain involved in the family af
fairs with, as they say, hilarious conse
quences. Needless to say. after much homey
American wisdom and careful display of the
drawbacks of European thought, love con
quers all. the family is (somewhat) reunited

and the crisis is averted. (The play does not
tell us what happens when the war breaks
out three years later.)
Despite the plot, the play was tunny. An
nette Bening is a very good actress, and.
while she might he more suited to meatier
stuff, she does a fine job carrying off the
part of the chorus girl. Her awe at the plush
surroundings, her playful joking about the
formalities and a very real warmth come
across well in her performance and she
delivers her laugh lines nicely. 1 hope ACT
finds her better parts next season. Marrian
Walters is hysterical as the deaf grand
duchess, the regent's wife. The character
never has any real grasp of what is happen
ing. and Walters so confidently carries on in
spite of this that her scenes are the funniest
and most interesting in the production.
Peter Donat is disappointing as the regent.
Me never seems to know how old he is: at
one moment he appears to be moving
fluidly around the stage, the next he will be
displaying pain in a joint or muscle that had
been doing just fine. There does not seem to
be any rhyme or reason to this. His trans
formation from harsh European autocrat to
lover is stereotypical and not particularly
believable. He also, though, is good at the
one-liners.
The total result is the play gets lots of
predictable laughter at fairly regular inter

vals. The oinei characters are lairly stock
sitcom material. William Paterson does his
usual adequate job as the crusty English
diplomat assigned to the legation. Anne
McNaughton is a- dippy Archduchess and
Tynia Thomassie is her spoiled daughter.
They are both funny, but there never were
Austrian princesses who were as untrained
and unrefined as these two. O Brien has
some appealing moments as the young king:
he is pleasant and sincere on stage. But the
playwright has created another unbelievable
combination: in this case ot political in
triguer and small child. It is difficult to see
the 16-year-old who practically bursts into
tears early in the play because his father or
ders the wrong erector set staging a coup,
but maybe I overestimate European ruling
houses.
Director James Edmondson has probably
done as well with a lot ot the play as could
be done, though the show does drag a bit.
Richard Seger's scenery is very impressive,
as are the stream of sen ants, the tons ot
flowers and the upstage doors which open
by themselves as people approach. "The
Sleeping Prince" plays through May 12. and
is a pleasant enough evening, especially il
you want to turn your mind off. I wonder,
however, why a major theater company
would attempt it.


s eter Donat plays the regent and Annette Bening portrays Mary in ACT's "The Sleeping
'rince," a re-telling of the Cinderella tale.
