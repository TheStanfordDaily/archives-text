# Last-day rush swamps Macintosh lottery
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
As the Microdisc lottery wound down yesterday,
a sudden onslaught of customers hoping to buy
Apple Macintosh computers caused five- to six
hour waits and forced administrators to extend the
lottery for those who have already obtained order
numbers.
By noon yesterday, over 1500 orders had been
placed for the first shipments of discounted Macin-

Ed Shaw, the director of Information Technol
ogy Services, said yesterday that students and staff
members who have already taken out order num
bers may continue to place orders today, one day
after the planned deadline for the lottery.
"We can't legally turn pway anyone who is given
an order number before closing tin Thursday, so

we're going to have to remain open for handling
the unprocessed orders until 5 p.m. Friday," said
Ed Shaw.
Wanda Lee, administrative services manager for
Information Technology Systems, warned, "Once
the doors are closed, nobody,'whether they have
an order number or not, will be allowed to have
their orders processed in time for the lottery."
Macintosh purchasers who have missed the lot
tery deadline may now place first-come first
served orders, which will be filled after all lottery
orders.
In order to have all the processing information
in the data base in time for Monday's lottery.
Microdisc will be forced to enlist people to work
over the weekend, Lee said.
"We have on hand around 450 Macintoshes that
can be delivered immediately" to people with fa
vorable lottery numbers, Lee said. "The rest of the
people will be given May or June delivery dates.
"If people would have started coming in last
week instead of waiting until yesterday and today,
this all could have been avoided."
One customer, sophomore Dan Stryev said, " 1
just hadq't made the time to go down and experi
ment with the Macs until yesterday. Basically, I

would attribute my waiting until the last day to buy
a Mac to procrastination."
Lee said yesterday that the late rush caused
some problems.
"Since we didn't expect so many purchasers, we
ran out of order numbers (Wednesday) making it
necessary for people to keep their place in line by
staying there," Lee said. "Today, however, we
have enough numbers, hence freeing people to go
to class or wherever, and come back right before
their order number is called for final processing.
"People seem to feel more secure with an order
number in their hands, and the lines, though
they've gotten much longer, are still very well
behaved," she added.
"There's a feeling of camaraderie among this
waiting line of people who are forced to battle the
high odds to wait" for a computer, said David
Finkelstein, a junior in math sciences, while he
waited in the processing line.
Shaw said that, given the circumstances, the or
dering system is working well.
"We wanted to run a lean, low-overhead activ
ity," he said. "It's working, but this kind of activity
also means long lines.
