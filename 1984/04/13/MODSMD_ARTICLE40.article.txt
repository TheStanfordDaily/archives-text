# Yes still more than the band that performs 'Lonely Heart'
## 
### RON CHRISLEY 
I don't know when it hap
pened to you, but / heard
"Owner Of A Lonely Heart"
for the 1000 th time a couple
months ago on the Marguerite. I
remember overhearing the pas
senger in front of me ask her
companion if she liked "that
new group. Yes." It was then
that 1 began to wonder whether
the band that released 90125

deserved to call itself Yes, for
the Yes of today is in many ways
different from the Yes of the
1970s that gave us such master
works as Fragile, Close To The
Edge, Going For The One, et al,
before finally dissolving grace
lessly in 1980. 1 began to
wonder if Yes had lost more in
the four-year hiatus since then
besides keyboard wizard Rick
Wakeman and guitar giant

Steve Howe.
Yes' return to the Bay Area
on March 30 initially offered
disappointing answers to my
questions. This band, which
used to prime its audiences with
a recording of Stravinsky's
"Firebird Suite," instead
"warmed" us with Bugs Bunny
cartoons and the all-new
extendcd-dance-cum- Human
League version of "Leave It."
Seriously.
Then the performance itself.
The band's opening song,
"Cinema," added to my
suspicion that the musicians
onstage were some alien band
that had mistakenly been
given the name Yes in some sick
joke. Cinema was also the name
of the band that was formed in
1983 by Chris Squire, Alan
White, Tony Kaye (all former
Yes members) and Trevor
Rabin. This band, with music
written by Rabin, had no inten
tion of being called Yes until
Jon Anderson, also a former
Yesman, joined later as
vocalist/lyricist.
And so it was at the concert.
Even as "Cinema" was in effect
being performed by Cinema,
Jon Anderson glided assuredly

onto the round platform, excit
ing the audience with a zealous
calm that merely hinted at his
own. Here was Yes. Not
Cinema. Not Jon Anderson
alone. But Anderson. Squire,
White, Rabin and Kaye to
gether, creating powerful, beau
tiful music.
The show continued with con
sistency. Teasing us with a deli
cate balance between new and
earlier pieces. Yes presented a
remarkable set — "And You
And I," "Hold On," "Your
Move/All Good People," "City
Of Love," "Yours Is No Dis
grace," "It Can Happen" and
"Long Distance Runaround."
Alan White provided a persis
tent yet complicated beat, while
his complement, Chris Squire,
executed the best bass solo this
author has ever experienced
with his signature piece, "The
Fish."
Trevor Rabin's guitars
dominated much of the show,
which was unfortunate even
though Rabin is very accom
plished at his art. He followed
more than adequately in Howe's
legendary footsteps.
Tony kaye's only noteworthy
moment was on "Hearts," when

his delicate keyboard work
sparkled magically. Otherwise,
he was a spasmodic has-been,
demonstrating that not all
studio musicians make good
showmen. Embarrassing.
The audience was captivated
by Jon Anderson's self
accompanied solo performance
of the closing segment of "The
Gates of Delirium," his voice
simultaneously powerful and
controlled.
Special effects enhanced the
show, with lasers artistically
employed on "Owner Of A
Lonely Heart," and "Starship
Trooper," as well as a well
timed and surrealistic video seg
ment that accompanied
"Changes."
Yes then returned for the
necessary encore performance
of "Roundabout," and then
retired — the crowd excited, the
band successful.
The experience demonstrated
to me what Yes of the '80s is all
about. The "changes" the group
has undergone have not
destroyed it, but have instead
made its sound relevant to the
'80s — an age when
"progressive" rock dinosaurs
are supposed to be extinct.
