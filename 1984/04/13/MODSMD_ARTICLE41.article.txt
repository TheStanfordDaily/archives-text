The Phantom of the Paradise
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Brian De Palma made this
wild, hilarious spoof of horror
movies and rock singers with the
kind of freedom he enjoyed in
his underground movie days.
The plot is basically modelled on
The Phantom of the Opera, with
Paul Williams (who wrote the
satirical songs, and they're
surprisingly, wickedly clever) as
the impresario, Jessica Harper as
the promising young singer, and
William Finley as the brilliant
composer who is turned into a
monster and resides in the upper
reaches of the theater, where he
watches over the girl he adores.
In this case, the composer's work
is a "pop cantata" version of
Faust, and De Palma (who wrote
as well as directed) plays on
Faust almost as much as on The
Phantom: On one level the com
poser Winslow is Faust, the
singer Phoenix is Marguerite,
and the impresario Swan is Mep
histopheles, and on another —
an ingenious extension — this
Mephistopheles is also his own
Faust. The movie — a marvelous
entertainment that deserves the
reputation The Rocky Horror
Picture Show has got — is
replete with visual and vocal ref
erences: There are borrowings
from The Picture of Dorian
Gray, Psycho, The Godfather,
The Manchurian Candidate and
even liye bye Birdie. The un
usually winning cast also in
cludes Gerrit Graham as a pop
idol and, as three different rock
trios, Harold Oblong, Jeffrey
Comanor and Archie Hahn.
Watch out for Jessica Harper's
audition number, "Special to
Me"; aside from Pennies from
Heaven, it's the best (and tough
est) thing she's ever done.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with Ziggy Stardust.

Psycho (I960)
Cubberley Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated
return again and again to marvel
at the intricate design of the
suspense sequences and the in
terplay between George
Tomasin's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, expressive
music (scored solely for strings
during the shower scene).
Watching this Grand Guignol
comedy, with its motel office full
of stuffed birds and its extrava
gant. aberrant sexual psychol
ogy, is a perverse pleasure: No
movie until Jaws was so wittily
sadistic in i' s treatment of the
audience. Anthony Perkins is
matvelout* as the crecpy-Jnoiek.-
owner, Norman Bates; the sup
porting cast is headed by Janet
Leigh, Vera Miles, Martin Bal
sam, John Gavin, John Mclntire
and Simon Oakland. Psycho
turned out to be Hitchcock's
summit achievement; none of his
subsequent half-dozen movies
can even be discussed in the
same breath.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.
Never Say Never Again
(1983)
Memorial Auditorium
This leisurely, laid-back spy
whirl, starring Sean Cannery as
James Bond, may seem perverse
to those who go to it seeking the
thrills available in the best parts
of the The Spy Who Loved Me
and Octopussy, but it's like

taking a marvelous vacation. Ir
vin Kershner, the director, chose
a sly, relaxed style to match
Lorenzo Semple's script, in
which "M" (Edward Fox)
decides that Bond's taste for rich
food and drink has worn him
t|l)wn, and so he sends him to a
health clinic. Kershner works in
such an unstressed manner here,
eschewing excitation techniques,
that you're not forced to notice
how beautifully designed and
structured each sequence is.
With a trio of class villains: Bar
bara Carrera, Klaus Maria Bran
dauer and Max Von Sydow.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
The Bicycle Thief (1948)
Adelfa Lounge (Lagunita);
Madera Lounge (Wilbur)
Vittorio De Sica's fable about
a man driven to stealing in the
poverty-stricken Rome of the

post-World War II epoch ap
pears on every list of all-time
great movies. Like the two other
nuo-icaliM mastcipicivs Dc S*ea ..
made with screenwriter Cesare
Zavattini, Shoeshine and
Umberto D, this movie touches
one so intimately that it is almost
an invasion of privacy; it is
shocking, shattering and finally
exhilarating. De Sica takes us to
the deepest reaches of despair
and out the other side. With
Lamberto Maggiorani, Lianella
Carelli and Enzo Staiola.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30
(Lagunita) and Tuesday evening
at 6:30 (Madera).
Days and Nights in the Forest
(1969)
Terman Auditorium
The Indian Satyajit Ray may
be the greatest living filmmaker,
but revival houses have been
scandalously remiss in screening

his pictures in recent years, so
few people know his work. In
Days and Nights in the Forest,
four young men leave their
homes in Calcutta for a rural
holiday and two become in
volved with women; there's no
more plot than that, really, yet as
a series of character studies, as a
sociopolitical study of the Anglo
influence on India, as a tragedy
of failed human connections, it's
an incomparably rich movie.
Soumitra Chatterji (Ray's favor
ite actor) and Sharmila Tagore
take the leading roles; in the
film's most remarkable scene,
the six vacationers play a
memory game and these two are
the final competitors, outlasting
all their friends, and by the time
the game is over we have learned
more about them than another
director could have shown us in
a whole movie.
Plays tomorrow night at

The Rules of the Game (1939)
Cubberley Auditorium
"One starts with the environ
ment to arrive at the self," wrote
Jean Renoir, "i remain a man of
the 19th century, and 1 need ob
servation as a point of
departure." Having chronicled
the death "throes of the
European uristocntkey in Grand
Illusion, Renoir set this film,
made two years later, among the
new aristocracy in France: the
nouveaux riches, for whom love
is a game with a fixed set of
rules, and to break them — as
the anachronistic, romantic
aviator Jurieu (Roland Toutain)
does — is in bad taste and
therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approach
ing his subject triumphs: Rules
of the Game is both a social and
a psychological drama, and it's
one that was almost lost to us
forever — the original negative
was destroyed by the Nazis and
the film was reassembled from
bits and pieces in the 19505.
Renoir worked with Carl Koch
on the screenplay (based loosely
on Alfred de Musset's "Les
Caprices de Marianne"); Claude
Renoir shot it; Coco Chanel de

signed the costumes. The super
lative cast includes Marcel Dalio
(he played the Jew, Rosenthal,
in Grand Illusion), Nora Gregor,
Mila Parely, Odette Talazac,
Julien Carette, Paulette Dubost
and Renoir himself.
Plays Monday evening at 8.
Blade Rjunner (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The Los Angeles of this film
— set in 2019 — is a neon
dotted landscape with electric
fires flashing out of chimneys
and aircraft soaring overhead
like hallucinatory bubbles; from

below, you see enormous adver
tising images projected on float
ing screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the
production designer, Lawrence
Paull, and the photographer,
Jordan Croenenworth, have
created a future with enough vis
ual connections to the past and
the present to be particularly
eerie, and Douglas Turnbull's
special effects are often as
tonishing. Yet it's a cold, repel
lent movie. The story (from a
wry*ci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick
Culled "Do Android* Dream of
Electric Sheep") concerns a
bounty hunter assigned to
"retire" a deceptively human
seeming model of robot and
unable to do his job without
feeling guilt. But Ridley Scott is
not the right director for a movie
that asks for emotional fullness;
his chief concern is how to stage
the violence in freshly shocking,
abstractly beautiful ways. With
Harrison Ford (who seems to be
on automatic pilot), Rutger
Hauer, Daryl Hannah and
others.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with The Road Warrior.
All the Right Moves (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
As the high school football
coach impatient to land a college
job and escapc from the Penn

sylvania steel town he's trapped
in, Craig T. Nelson lends a touch
of authenticity to this mediocre
drama, directed (first time out)
by the gifted cinematographer
Michael Chapman from a script
by Michael Kane. Nelson has a
supporting role, but he acts with
a frightening intensity that
makes the movie's nominal lead,
Tom Cruise, seem like small fry.
Not a terrible picture — just dis
mayingly routine.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Risky Business.

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Anthony Burgess' novel was a
satire on the polarized state he
felt Western society was ap
proaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is
"rehabilitated" by behavioral
psychologists, i.e., reduced to a
benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alterna
tives social and anti-social
conduct — are equally repug
nant. But in Stanley Kubrick's
film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of soci
ety's representatives are such
megalomaniacal halfwits — that
we are manipulated into cheer
ing for his highly objectionable
acts of rebellion. Shrewdly,
Kubrick has cast vivacious, win
ning Malcolm McDowell — a
performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex.
This is a morally questionable
film, directed in such an imper
sonal manner that even the vio
lence doesn't affect us; it seems
to transpire in a vacuum.
Plays today with 2001: A
Space Odyssey.
La Cage aux Folles (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script by Jean Poiret,
Edouard Molinaro, Francis
Veber and Marcello Danon is
the cleverest variation yet on the
oft-tried comic theme of the par
ent who pretends to be someth
ing he is not for the good of his
child. (Damon Runyon may

have been the first to use it, in
his story "Madam La Gimp.")
Ugo Tognazzi plays Renato,
whose son has just become en
gaged to the daughter of a reac
tionary, highly placed govern
ment official. The girl's parents
naturally wish to meet their in
tended in-law, but that poses a
delicate problem: Renato is an
avowed homosexual who lives
with his long-time lover, Albin,

played by Michel Serrault (who
gives a magnificent comic per
formance). The direction (by
Molinaro) is sloppy, and the
stage origins are uncomfortably
clear in the structure of some of
the scenes, but these flaws seem
terribly unimportant when Ser
rault is on screen. When he
walks, every movable part of his
body flutters through a series of
carefully prearranged poses; he
gets more comic mileage out of
his clothing than almost any
other actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow with La Cage
aux Folles 11.
La Traviata (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
It may be a long time before
jiou'll heari a Tnaviatti. iut.iMotlh
sung (by Teresa Stratas, Placido
Domingo, Cornell MacNeil and
others) and conducted (by the
Met's James Levine), but you
have to contend with director
Franco Zeffirelli's imagination,
which is 19th-century in the
worst way: He turns everything
into confectionery. When this
Violetta tells Germont she's
been happy with his son Alfredo,
she gazes at a cage of doves;
when she strives to decide be
tween a life of heedless pleasure
and true love, images of Alfredo
confront her in every doorway.
Since Zeffirelli has ensured that
the decor will upstage the singers
in every scene, it's not surprising
that we keep forgetting about
the drama and get caught up in
other questions, like who in
Paris has enough money to keep
Violetta in a mansion the size of
Versailles, and why doesn't she

have more than one servant?
Teresa Stratas certainly looks
the role of the consumptive
dame aux camelias, and she can
act it, too (though /.eftirelli lets
her overact), but Domingo just
pulls with overemphatic virility
at his coat lapels and screws his
face up to express despair. (He
also looks about 10 years
younger than his "father. Cor
nell MacNeil.) Yes, yes, the
Verdi music is divine, but you
have to go to this movie in a
mood of real romantic abandon
in order to survive it without gig
gling.
Plays Sunday with Blood
Wedding.
Educating Rita (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
On stage Willy Russell's 1480
play, a smash in London's West
End. may have some of the ap
peal of "Pygmalion" and "Born
Yesterday"and the other inter
class pedagogical romances on
which it's built, but in this pro
duction, inconsistently filled out
for the screen (Russell wrote his
own screenplay) and miserably
staged and directed by Lewis
Gilbert, there's no way to tell for
certain. The only reason to see it
is Michael Caine, who — as a
drunken, disenchanted English
professor brought back to life by
a young woman he tutors —
turns a sow's ear of a part into a
silk purse. Julie Walters, repeat
ing her stage performance, is a
glazed-eyed zombie of an actress
who reads her lines as if spon
taneity were a crime against na
ture.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Experience Preferred But
Not Essential.
The Exorcist (1973)
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An outrage. William Peter
Blatty adapted his cheap, revolt
ing thriller about possession and
exorcism to the screen, and
William Friedkin provided extra
shocks, such as a painfully
detailed spinal tap sequence and
close-ups of a man, flung out of a
window, hitting every step
before he splatters on the front
lawn. Friedkin is a terribly slick
director — he drives every
charge home (although the
picture is actually more sicken
ing than scary) — but what kind
of human being would be proud
of making this glaringly calcu
lated, phony-religious,
misanthropic mumbo-jumbo
work? Owen Roizman's photog
raphy has moments of real
elegance; Ellen Burstyn, as the
victim's mother, does some fine
'acting in the first hour; and Ma\
iVon Sydow, as the exorcist. Fa
ther Merrin, tries his damnedest
to bring some dignity to his
scenes.
Plays Tuesday evening with
The Dead Zone.
La Cage aux Folles II (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Albin (Michel Serrault) and
Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) could
become the Abbott and Costello
for the '80s, but not with materi
al like this tedious spy thriller
comedy. The few bright mo
ments are buried under the
pedestrian, implausible plot and
the surprisingly softheaded
treatment of the relationship be
tween the two men. There is
some Gay Liberation
grandstanding that is notably
sour and lacking in sensitivity.
Plays tomorrow with La Cage
aux Folles.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Albin (Michel Serrault) and
Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) could
become the Abbott and Costello
for the '80s, but not with materi
al like this tedious spy thriller
comedy. The few bright mo
ments are buried under the
pedestrian, implausible plot and
the surprisingly softheaded
treatment of the relationship be
tween the two men. There is
some Gay Liberation
grandstanding that is notably
sour and lacking in sensitivity.
Plays tomorrow with La Cage
aux Folles.

The Phantom of the Paradise
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Brian De Palma made this
wild, hilarious spoof of horror
movies and rock singers with the
kind of freedom he enjoyed in
his underground movie days.
The plot is basically modelled on
The Phantom of the Opera, with
Paul Williams (who wrote the
satirical songs, and they're
surprisingly, wickedly clever) as
the impresario, Jessica Harper as
the promising young singer, and
William Finley as the brilliant
composer who is turned into a
monster and resides in the upper
reaches of the theater, where he
watches over the girl he adores.
In this case, the composer's work
is a "pop cantata" version of
Faust, and De Palma (who wrote
as well as directed) plays on
Faust almost as much as on The
Phantom: On one level the com
poser Winslow is Faust, the
singer Phoenix is Marguerite,
and the impresario Swan is Mep
histopheles, and on another —
an ingenious extension — this
Mephistopheles is also his own
Faust. The movie — a marvelous
entertainment that deserves the
reputation The Rocky Horror
Picture Show has got — is
replete with visual and vocal ref
erences: There are borrowings
from The Picture of Dorian
Gray, Psycho, The Godfather,
The Manchurian Candidate and
even liye bye Birdie. The un
usually winning cast also in
cludes Gerrit Graham as a pop
idol and, as three different rock
trios, Harold Oblong, Jeffrey
Comanor and Archie Hahn.
Watch out for Jessica Harper's
audition number, "Special to
Me"; aside from Pennies from
Heaven, it's the best (and tough
est) thing she's ever done.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with Ziggy Stardust.

Psycho (I960)
Cubberley Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated
return again and again to marvel
at the intricate design of the
suspense sequences and the in
terplay between George
Tomasin's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, expressive
music (scored solely for strings
during the shower scene).
Watching this Grand Guignol
comedy, with its motel office full
of stuffed birds and its extrava
gant. aberrant sexual psychol
ogy, is a perverse pleasure: No
movie until Jaws was so wittily
sadistic in i' s treatment of the
audience. Anthony Perkins is
matvelout* as the crecpy-Jnoiek.-
owner, Norman Bates; the sup
porting cast is headed by Janet
Leigh, Vera Miles, Martin Bal
sam, John Gavin, John Mclntire
and Simon Oakland. Psycho
turned out to be Hitchcock's
summit achievement; none of his
subsequent half-dozen movies
can even be discussed in the
same breath.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.
Never Say Never Again
(1983)
Memorial Auditorium
This leisurely, laid-back spy
whirl, starring Sean Cannery as
James Bond, may seem perverse
to those who go to it seeking the
thrills available in the best parts
of the The Spy Who Loved Me
and Octopussy, but it's like

taking a marvelous vacation. Ir
vin Kershner, the director, chose
a sly, relaxed style to match
Lorenzo Semple's script, in
which "M" (Edward Fox)
decides that Bond's taste for rich
food and drink has worn him
t|l)wn, and so he sends him to a
health clinic. Kershner works in
such an unstressed manner here,
eschewing excitation techniques,
that you're not forced to notice
how beautifully designed and
structured each sequence is.
With a trio of class villains: Bar
bara Carrera, Klaus Maria Bran
dauer and Max Von Sydow.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
The Bicycle Thief (1948)
Adelfa Lounge (Lagunita);
Madera Lounge (Wilbur)
Vittorio De Sica's fable about
a man driven to stealing in the
poverty-stricken Rome of the

post-World War II epoch ap
pears on every list of all-time
great movies. Like the two other
nuo-icaliM mastcipicivs Dc S*ea ..
made with screenwriter Cesare
Zavattini, Shoeshine and
Umberto D, this movie touches
one so intimately that it is almost
an invasion of privacy; it is
shocking, shattering and finally
exhilarating. De Sica takes us to
the deepest reaches of despair
and out the other side. With
Lamberto Maggiorani, Lianella
Carelli and Enzo Staiola.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30
(Lagunita) and Tuesday evening
at 6:30 (Madera).
Days and Nights in the Forest
(1969)
Terman Auditorium
The Indian Satyajit Ray may
be the greatest living filmmaker,
but revival houses have been
scandalously remiss in screening

his pictures in recent years, so
few people know his work. In
Days and Nights in the Forest,
four young men leave their
homes in Calcutta for a rural
holiday and two become in
volved with women; there's no
more plot than that, really, yet as
a series of character studies, as a
sociopolitical study of the Anglo
influence on India, as a tragedy
of failed human connections, it's
an incomparably rich movie.
Soumitra Chatterji (Ray's favor
ite actor) and Sharmila Tagore
take the leading roles; in the
film's most remarkable scene,
the six vacationers play a
memory game and these two are
the final competitors, outlasting
all their friends, and by the time
the game is over we have learned
more about them than another
director could have shown us in
a whole movie.
Plays tomorrow night at

The Rules of the Game (1939)
Cubberley Auditorium
"One starts with the environ
ment to arrive at the self," wrote
Jean Renoir, "i remain a man of
the 19th century, and 1 need ob
servation as a point of
departure." Having chronicled
the death "throes of the
European uristocntkey in Grand
Illusion, Renoir set this film,
made two years later, among the
new aristocracy in France: the
nouveaux riches, for whom love
is a game with a fixed set of
rules, and to break them — as
the anachronistic, romantic
aviator Jurieu (Roland Toutain)
does — is in bad taste and
therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approach
ing his subject triumphs: Rules
of the Game is both a social and
a psychological drama, and it's
one that was almost lost to us
forever — the original negative
was destroyed by the Nazis and
the film was reassembled from
bits and pieces in the 19505.
Renoir worked with Carl Koch
on the screenplay (based loosely
on Alfred de Musset's "Les
Caprices de Marianne"); Claude
Renoir shot it; Coco Chanel de

signed the costumes. The super
lative cast includes Marcel Dalio
(he played the Jew, Rosenthal,
in Grand Illusion), Nora Gregor,
Mila Parely, Odette Talazac,
Julien Carette, Paulette Dubost
and Renoir himself.
Plays Monday evening at 8.
Blade Rjunner (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The Los Angeles of this film
— set in 2019 — is a neon
dotted landscape with electric
fires flashing out of chimneys
and aircraft soaring overhead
like hallucinatory bubbles; from

below, you see enormous adver
tising images projected on float
ing screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the
production designer, Lawrence
Paull, and the photographer,
Jordan Croenenworth, have
created a future with enough vis
ual connections to the past and
the present to be particularly
eerie, and Douglas Turnbull's
special effects are often as
tonishing. Yet it's a cold, repel
lent movie. The story (from a
wry*ci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick
Culled "Do Android* Dream of
Electric Sheep") concerns a
bounty hunter assigned to
"retire" a deceptively human
seeming model of robot and
unable to do his job without
feeling guilt. But Ridley Scott is
not the right director for a movie
that asks for emotional fullness;
his chief concern is how to stage
the violence in freshly shocking,
abstractly beautiful ways. With
Harrison Ford (who seems to be
on automatic pilot), Rutger
Hauer, Daryl Hannah and
others.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with The Road Warrior.
All the Right Moves (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
As the high school football
coach impatient to land a college
job and escapc from the Penn

sylvania steel town he's trapped
in, Craig T. Nelson lends a touch
of authenticity to this mediocre
drama, directed (first time out)
by the gifted cinematographer
Michael Chapman from a script
by Michael Kane. Nelson has a
supporting role, but he acts with
a frightening intensity that
makes the movie's nominal lead,
Tom Cruise, seem like small fry.
Not a terrible picture — just dis
mayingly routine.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Risky Business.

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Anthony Burgess' novel was a
satire on the polarized state he
felt Western society was ap
proaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is
"rehabilitated" by behavioral
psychologists, i.e., reduced to a
benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alterna
tives social and anti-social
conduct — are equally repug
nant. But in Stanley Kubrick's
film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of soci
ety's representatives are such
megalomaniacal halfwits — that
we are manipulated into cheer
ing for his highly objectionable
acts of rebellion. Shrewdly,
Kubrick has cast vivacious, win
ning Malcolm McDowell — a
performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex.
This is a morally questionable
film, directed in such an imper
sonal manner that even the vio
lence doesn't affect us; it seems
to transpire in a vacuum.
Plays today with 2001: A
Space Odyssey.
La Cage aux Folles (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script by Jean Poiret,
Edouard Molinaro, Francis
Veber and Marcello Danon is
the cleverest variation yet on the
oft-tried comic theme of the par
ent who pretends to be someth
ing he is not for the good of his
child. (Damon Runyon may

have been the first to use it, in
his story "Madam La Gimp.")
Ugo Tognazzi plays Renato,
whose son has just become en
gaged to the daughter of a reac
tionary, highly placed govern
ment official. The girl's parents
naturally wish to meet their in
tended in-law, but that poses a
delicate problem: Renato is an
avowed homosexual who lives
with his long-time lover, Albin,

played by Michel Serrault (who
gives a magnificent comic per
formance). The direction (by
Molinaro) is sloppy, and the
stage origins are uncomfortably
clear in the structure of some of
the scenes, but these flaws seem
terribly unimportant when Ser
rault is on screen. When he
walks, every movable part of his
body flutters through a series of
carefully prearranged poses; he
gets more comic mileage out of
his clothing than almost any
other actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow with La Cage
aux Folles 11.
La Traviata (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
It may be a long time before
jiou'll heari a Tnaviatti. iut.iMotlh
sung (by Teresa Stratas, Placido
Domingo, Cornell MacNeil and
others) and conducted (by the
Met's James Levine), but you
have to contend with director
Franco Zeffirelli's imagination,
which is 19th-century in the
worst way: He turns everything
into confectionery. When this
Violetta tells Germont she's
been happy with his son Alfredo,
she gazes at a cage of doves;
when she strives to decide be
tween a life of heedless pleasure
and true love, images of Alfredo
confront her in every doorway.
Since Zeffirelli has ensured that
the decor will upstage the singers
in every scene, it's not surprising
that we keep forgetting about
the drama and get caught up in
other questions, like who in
Paris has enough money to keep
Violetta in a mansion the size of
Versailles, and why doesn't she

have more than one servant?
Teresa Stratas certainly looks
the role of the consumptive
dame aux camelias, and she can
act it, too (though /.eftirelli lets
her overact), but Domingo just
pulls with overemphatic virility
at his coat lapels and screws his
face up to express despair. (He
also looks about 10 years
younger than his "father. Cor
nell MacNeil.) Yes, yes, the
Verdi music is divine, but you
have to go to this movie in a
mood of real romantic abandon
in order to survive it without gig
gling.
Plays Sunday with Blood
Wedding.
Educating Rita (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
On stage Willy Russell's 1480
play, a smash in London's West
End. may have some of the ap
peal of "Pygmalion" and "Born
Yesterday"and the other inter
class pedagogical romances on
which it's built, but in this pro
duction, inconsistently filled out
for the screen (Russell wrote his
own screenplay) and miserably
staged and directed by Lewis
Gilbert, there's no way to tell for
certain. The only reason to see it
is Michael Caine, who — as a
drunken, disenchanted English
professor brought back to life by
a young woman he tutors —
turns a sow's ear of a part into a
silk purse. Julie Walters, repeat
ing her stage performance, is a
glazed-eyed zombie of an actress
who reads her lines as if spon
taneity were a crime against na
ture.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Experience Preferred But
Not Essential.
The Exorcist (1973)
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An outrage. William Peter
Blatty adapted his cheap, revolt
ing thriller about possession and
exorcism to the screen, and
William Friedkin provided extra
shocks, such as a painfully
detailed spinal tap sequence and
close-ups of a man, flung out of a
window, hitting every step
before he splatters on the front
lawn. Friedkin is a terribly slick
director — he drives every
charge home (although the
picture is actually more sicken
ing than scary) — but what kind
of human being would be proud
of making this glaringly calcu
lated, phony-religious,
misanthropic mumbo-jumbo
work? Owen Roizman's photog
raphy has moments of real
elegance; Ellen Burstyn, as the
victim's mother, does some fine
'acting in the first hour; and Ma\
iVon Sydow, as the exorcist. Fa
ther Merrin, tries his damnedest
to bring some dignity to his
scenes.
Plays Tuesday evening with

La Cage aux Folles II (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Albin (Michel Serrault) and
Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) could
become the Abbott and Costello
for the '80s, but not with materi
al like this tedious spy thriller
comedy. The few bright mo
ments are buried under the
pedestrian, implausible plot and
the surprisingly softheaded
treatment of the relationship be
tween the two men. There is
some Gay Liberation
grandstanding that is notably
sour and lacking in sensitivity.
Plays tomorrow with La Cage
aux Folles.

The Phantom of the Paradise
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Brian De Palma made this
wild, hilarious spoof of horror
movies and rock singers with the
kind of freedom he enjoyed in
his underground movie days.
The plot is basically modelled on
The Phantom of the Opera, with
Paul Williams (who wrote the
satirical songs, and they're
surprisingly, wickedly clever) as
the impresario, Jessica Harper as
the promising young singer, and
William Finley as the brilliant
composer who is turned into a
monster and resides in the upper
reaches of the theater, where he
watches over the girl he adores.
In this case, the composer's work
is a "pop cantata" version of
Faust, and De Palma (who wrote
as well as directed) plays on
Faust almost as much as on The
Phantom: On one level the com
poser Winslow is Faust, the
singer Phoenix is Marguerite,
and the impresario Swan is Mep
histopheles, and on another —
an ingenious extension — this
Mephistopheles is also his own
Faust. The movie — a marvelous
entertainment that deserves the
reputation The Rocky Horror
Picture Show has got — is
replete with visual and vocal ref
erences: There are borrowings
from The Picture of Dorian
Gray, Psycho, The Godfather,
The Manchurian Candidate and
even liye bye Birdie. The un
usually winning cast also in
cludes Gerrit Graham as a pop
idol and, as three different rock
trios, Harold Oblong, Jeffrey
Comanor and Archie Hahn.
Watch out for Jessica Harper's
audition number, "Special to
Me"; aside from Pennies from
Heaven, it's the best (and tough
est) thing she's ever done.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with Ziggy Stardust.

Psycho (I960)
Cubberley Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated
return again and again to marvel
at the intricate design of the
suspense sequences and the in
terplay between George
Tomasin's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, expressive
music (scored solely for strings
during the shower scene).
Watching this Grand Guignol
comedy, with its motel office full
of stuffed birds and its extrava
gant. aberrant sexual psychol
ogy, is a perverse pleasure: No
movie until Jaws was so wittily
sadistic in i' s treatment of the
audience. Anthony Perkins is
matvelout* as the crecpy-Jnoiek.-
owner, Norman Bates; the sup
porting cast is headed by Janet
Leigh, Vera Miles, Martin Bal
sam, John Gavin, John Mclntire
and Simon Oakland. Psycho
turned out to be Hitchcock's
summit achievement; none of his
subsequent half-dozen movies
can even be discussed in the
same breath.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.
Never Say Never Again
(1983)
Memorial Auditorium
This leisurely, laid-back spy
whirl, starring Sean Cannery as
James Bond, may seem perverse
to those who go to it seeking the
thrills available in the best parts
of the The Spy Who Loved Me
and Octopussy, but it's like

taking a marvelous vacation. Ir
vin Kershner, the director, chose
a sly, relaxed style to match
Lorenzo Semple's script, in
which "M" (Edward Fox)
decides that Bond's taste for rich
food and drink has worn him
t|l)wn, and so he sends him to a
health clinic. Kershner works in
such an unstressed manner here,
eschewing excitation techniques,
that you're not forced to notice
how beautifully designed and
structured each sequence is.
With a trio of class villains: Bar
bara Carrera, Klaus Maria Bran
dauer and Max Von Sydow.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
The Bicycle Thief (1948)
Adelfa Lounge (Lagunita);
Madera Lounge (Wilbur)
Vittorio De Sica's fable about
a man driven to stealing in the
poverty-stricken Rome of the

post-World War II epoch ap
pears on every list of all-time
great movies. Like the two other
nuo-icaliM mastcipicivs Dc S*ea ..
made with screenwriter Cesare
Zavattini, Shoeshine and
Umberto D, this movie touches
one so intimately that it is almost
an invasion of privacy; it is
shocking, shattering and finally
exhilarating. De Sica takes us to
the deepest reaches of despair
and out the other side. With
Lamberto Maggiorani, Lianella
Carelli and Enzo Staiola.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30
(Lagunita) and Tuesday evening
at 6:30 (Madera).
Days and Nights in the Forest
(1969)
Terman Auditorium
The Indian Satyajit Ray may
be the greatest living filmmaker,
but revival houses have been
scandalously remiss in screening

his pictures in recent years, so
few people know his work. In
Days and Nights in the Forest,
four young men leave their
homes in Calcutta for a rural
holiday and two become in
volved with women; there's no
more plot than that, really, yet as
a series of character studies, as a
sociopolitical study of the Anglo
influence on India, as a tragedy
of failed human connections, it's
an incomparably rich movie.
Soumitra Chatterji (Ray's favor
ite actor) and Sharmila Tagore
take the leading roles; in the
film's most remarkable scene,
the six vacationers play a
memory game and these two are
the final competitors, outlasting
all their friends, and by the time
the game is over we have learned
more about them than another
director could have shown us in
a whole movie.
Plays tomorrow night at

The Rules of the Game (1939)
Cubberley Auditorium
"One starts with the environ
ment to arrive at the self," wrote
Jean Renoir, "i remain a man of
the 19th century, and 1 need ob
servation as a point of
departure." Having chronicled
the death "throes of the
European uristocntkey in Grand
Illusion, Renoir set this film,
made two years later, among the
new aristocracy in France: the
nouveaux riches, for whom love
is a game with a fixed set of
rules, and to break them — as
the anachronistic, romantic
aviator Jurieu (Roland Toutain)
does — is in bad taste and
therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approach
ing his subject triumphs: Rules
of the Game is both a social and
a psychological drama, and it's
one that was almost lost to us
forever — the original negative
was destroyed by the Nazis and
the film was reassembled from
bits and pieces in the 19505.
Renoir worked with Carl Koch
on the screenplay (based loosely
on Alfred de Musset's "Les
Caprices de Marianne"); Claude
Renoir shot it; Coco Chanel de

signed the costumes. The super
lative cast includes Marcel Dalio
(he played the Jew, Rosenthal,
in Grand Illusion), Nora Gregor,
Mila Parely, Odette Talazac,
Julien Carette, Paulette Dubost
and Renoir himself.
Plays Monday evening at 8.
Blade Rjunner (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The Los Angeles of this film
— set in 2019 — is a neon
dotted landscape with electric
fires flashing out of chimneys
and aircraft soaring overhead
like hallucinatory bubbles; from

below, you see enormous adver
tising images projected on float
ing screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the
production designer, Lawrence
Paull, and the photographer,
Jordan Croenenworth, have
created a future with enough vis
ual connections to the past and
the present to be particularly
eerie, and Douglas Turnbull's
special effects are often as
tonishing. Yet it's a cold, repel
lent movie. The story (from a
wry*ci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick
Culled "Do Android* Dream of
Electric Sheep") concerns a
bounty hunter assigned to
"retire" a deceptively human
seeming model of robot and
unable to do his job without
feeling guilt. But Ridley Scott is
not the right director for a movie
that asks for emotional fullness;
his chief concern is how to stage
the violence in freshly shocking,
abstractly beautiful ways. With
Harrison Ford (who seems to be
on automatic pilot), Rutger
Hauer, Daryl Hannah and
others.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with The Road Warrior.
All the Right Moves (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
As the high school football
coach impatient to land a college
job and escapc from the Penn

sylvania steel town he's trapped
in, Craig T. Nelson lends a touch
of authenticity to this mediocre
drama, directed (first time out)
by the gifted cinematographer
Michael Chapman from a script
by Michael Kane. Nelson has a
supporting role, but he acts with
a frightening intensity that
makes the movie's nominal lead,
Tom Cruise, seem like small fry.
Not a terrible picture — just dis
mayingly routine.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Risky Business.

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Anthony Burgess' novel was a
satire on the polarized state he
felt Western society was ap
proaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is
"rehabilitated" by behavioral
psychologists, i.e., reduced to a
benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alterna
tives social and anti-social
conduct — are equally repug
nant. But in Stanley Kubrick's
film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of soci
ety's representatives are such
megalomaniacal halfwits — that
we are manipulated into cheer
ing for his highly objectionable
acts of rebellion. Shrewdly,
Kubrick has cast vivacious, win
ning Malcolm McDowell — a
performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex.
This is a morally questionable
film, directed in such an imper
sonal manner that even the vio
lence doesn't affect us; it seems
to transpire in a vacuum.
Plays today with 2001: A
Space Odyssey.
La Cage aux Folles (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script by Jean Poiret,
Edouard Molinaro, Francis
Veber and Marcello Danon is
the cleverest variation yet on the
oft-tried comic theme of the par
ent who pretends to be someth
ing he is not for the good of his
child. (Damon Runyon may

have been the first to use it, in
his story "Madam La Gimp.")
Ugo Tognazzi plays Renato,
whose son has just become en
gaged to the daughter of a reac
tionary, highly placed govern
ment official. The girl's parents
naturally wish to meet their in
tended in-law, but that poses a
delicate problem: Renato is an
avowed homosexual who lives
with his long-time lover, Albin,

played by Michel Serrault (who
gives a magnificent comic per
formance). The direction (by
Molinaro) is sloppy, and the
stage origins are uncomfortably
clear in the structure of some of
the scenes, but these flaws seem
terribly unimportant when Ser
rault is on screen. When he
walks, every movable part of his
body flutters through a series of
carefully prearranged poses; he
gets more comic mileage out of
his clothing than almost any
other actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow with La Cage
aux Folles 11.
La Traviata (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
It may be a long time before
jiou'll heari a Tnaviatti. iut.iMotlh
sung (by Teresa Stratas, Placido
Domingo, Cornell MacNeil and
others) and conducted (by the
Met's James Levine), but you
have to contend with director
Franco Zeffirelli's imagination,
which is 19th-century in the
worst way: He turns everything
into confectionery. When this
Violetta tells Germont she's
been happy with his son Alfredo,
she gazes at a cage of doves;
when she strives to decide be
tween a life of heedless pleasure
and true love, images of Alfredo
confront her in every doorway.
Since Zeffirelli has ensured that
the decor will upstage the singers
in every scene, it's not surprising
that we keep forgetting about
the drama and get caught up in
other questions, like who in
Paris has enough money to keep
Violetta in a mansion the size of
Versailles, and why doesn't she

have more than one servant?
Teresa Stratas certainly looks
the role of the consumptive
dame aux camelias, and she can
act it, too (though /.eftirelli lets
her overact), but Domingo just
pulls with overemphatic virility
at his coat lapels and screws his
face up to express despair. (He
also looks about 10 years
younger than his "father. Cor
nell MacNeil.) Yes, yes, the
Verdi music is divine, but you
have to go to this movie in a
mood of real romantic abandon
in order to survive it without gig
gling.
Plays Sunday with Blood
Wedding.
Educating Rita (1983)

class pedagogical romances on
which it's built, but in this pro
duction, inconsistently filled out
for the screen (Russell wrote his
own screenplay) and miserably
staged and directed by Lewis
Gilbert, there's no way to tell for
certain. The only reason to see it
is Michael Caine, who — as a
drunken, disenchanted English
professor brought back to life by
a young woman he tutors —
turns a sow's ear of a part into a
silk purse. Julie Walters, repeat
ing her stage performance, is a
glazed-eyed zombie of an actress
who reads her lines as if spon
taneity were a crime against na
ture.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Experience Preferred But
Not Essential.
The Exorcist (1973)
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An outrage. William Peter
Blatty adapted his cheap, revolt
ing thriller about possession and
exorcism to the screen, and
William Friedkin provided extra
shocks, such as a painfully
detailed spinal tap sequence and
close-ups of a man, flung out of a
window, hitting every step
before he splatters on the front
lawn. Friedkin is a terribly slick
director — he drives every
charge home (although the
picture is actually more sicken
ing than scary) — but what kind
of human being would be proud
of making this glaringly calcu
lated, phony-religious,
misanthropic mumbo-jumbo
work? Owen Roizman's photog
raphy has moments of real
elegance; Ellen Burstyn, as the
victim's mother, does some fine

New Varsity. Palo Alto
An outrage. William Peter
Blatty adapted his cheap, revolt
ing thriller about possession and
exorcism to the screen, and
William Friedkin provided extra
shocks, such as a painfully
detailed spinal tap sequence and
close-ups of a man, flung out of a
window, hitting every step
before he splatters on the front
lawn. Friedkin is a terribly slick
director — he drives every
charge home (although the
picture is actually more sicken
ing than scary) — but what kind
of human being would be proud
of making this glaringly calcu
lated, phony-religious,
misanthropic mumbo-jumbo
work? Owen Roizman's photog
raphy has moments of real
elegance; Ellen Burstyn, as the
victim's mother, does some fine
'acting in the first hour; and Ma\
iVon Sydow, as the exorcist. Fa
ther Merrin, tries his damnedest
to bring some dignity to his
scenes.
Plays Tuesday evening with
The Dead Zone.
La Cage aux Folles II (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Albin (Michel Serrault) and
Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) could
become the Abbott and Costello
for the '80s, but not with materi
al like this tedious spy thriller
comedy. The few bright mo
ments are buried under the
pedestrian, implausible plot and
the surprisingly softheaded
treatment of the relationship be
tween the two men. There is
some Gay Liberation
grandstanding that is notably
sour and lacking in sensitivity.
Plays tomorrow with La Cage
aux Folles.

The Phantom of the Paradise
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Brian De Palma made this
wild, hilarious spoof of horror
movies and rock singers with the
kind of freedom he enjoyed in
his underground movie days.
The plot is basically modelled on
The Phantom of the Opera, with
Paul Williams (who wrote the
satirical songs, and they're
surprisingly, wickedly clever) as
the impresario, Jessica Harper as
the promising young singer, and
William Finley as the brilliant
composer who is turned into a
monster and resides in the upper
reaches of the theater, where he
watches over the girl he adores.
In this case, the composer's work
is a "pop cantata" version of
Faust, and De Palma (who wrote
as well as directed) plays on
Faust almost as much as on The
Phantom: On one level the com
poser Winslow is Faust, the
singer Phoenix is Marguerite,
and the impresario Swan is Mep
histopheles, and on another —
an ingenious extension — this
Mephistopheles is also his own
Faust. The movie — a marvelous
entertainment that deserves the
reputation The Rocky Horror
Picture Show has got — is
replete with visual and vocal ref
erences: There are borrowings
from The Picture of Dorian
Gray, Psycho, The Godfather,
The Manchurian Candidate and
even liye bye Birdie. The un
usually winning cast also in
cludes Gerrit Graham as a pop
idol and, as three different rock
trios, Harold Oblong, Jeffrey
Comanor and Archie Hahn.
Watch out for Jessica Harper's
audition number, "Special to
Me"; aside from Pennies from
Heaven, it's the best (and tough
est) thing she's ever done.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with Ziggy Stardust.

Psycho (I960)
Cubberley Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated
return again and again to marvel
at the intricate design of the
suspense sequences and the in
terplay between George
Tomasin's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, expressive
music (scored solely for strings
during the shower scene).
Watching this Grand Guignol
comedy, with its motel office full
of stuffed birds and its extrava
gant. aberrant sexual psychol
ogy, is a perverse pleasure: No
movie until Jaws was so wittily
sadistic in i' s treatment of the
audience. Anthony Perkins is
matvelout* as the crecpy-Jnoiek.-
owner, Norman Bates; the sup
porting cast is headed by Janet
Leigh, Vera Miles, Martin Bal
sam, John Gavin, John Mclntire
and Simon Oakland. Psycho
turned out to be Hitchcock's
summit achievement; none of his
subsequent half-dozen movies
can even be discussed in the
same breath.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.
Never Say Never Again
(1983)
Memorial Auditorium
This leisurely, laid-back spy
whirl, starring Sean Cannery as
James Bond, may seem perverse
to those who go to it seeking the
thrills available in the best parts
of the The Spy Who Loved Me
and Octopussy, but it's like

taking a marvelous vacation. Ir
vin Kershner, the director, chose
a sly, relaxed style to match
Lorenzo Semple's script, in
which "M" (Edward Fox)
decides that Bond's taste for rich
food and drink has worn him
t|l)wn, and so he sends him to a
health clinic. Kershner works in
such an unstressed manner here,
eschewing excitation techniques,
that you're not forced to notice
how beautifully designed and
structured each sequence is.
With a trio of class villains: Bar
bara Carrera, Klaus Maria Bran
dauer and Max Von Sydow.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
The Bicycle Thief (1948)
Adelfa Lounge (Lagunita);
Madera Lounge (Wilbur)
Vittorio De Sica's fable about
a man driven to stealing in the
poverty-stricken Rome of the

post-World War II epoch ap
pears on every list of all-time
great movies. Like the two other
nuo-icaliM mastcipicivs Dc S*ea ..
made with screenwriter Cesare
Zavattini, Shoeshine and
Umberto D, this movie touches
one so intimately that it is almost
an invasion of privacy; it is
shocking, shattering and finally
exhilarating. De Sica takes us to
the deepest reaches of despair
and out the other side. With
Lamberto Maggiorani, Lianella
Carelli and Enzo Staiola.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30
(Lagunita) and Tuesday evening
at 6:30 (Madera).
Days and Nights in the Forest
(1969)
Terman Auditorium
The Indian Satyajit Ray may
be the greatest living filmmaker,
but revival houses have been
scandalously remiss in screening

his pictures in recent years, so
few people know his work. In
Days and Nights in the Forest,
four young men leave their
homes in Calcutta for a rural
holiday and two become in
volved with women; there's no
more plot than that, really, yet as
a series of character studies, as a
sociopolitical study of the Anglo
influence on India, as a tragedy
of failed human connections, it's
an incomparably rich movie.
Soumitra Chatterji (Ray's favor
ite actor) and Sharmila Tagore
take the leading roles; in the
film's most remarkable scene,
the six vacationers play a
memory game and these two are
the final competitors, outlasting
all their friends, and by the time
the game is over we have learned
more about them than another
director could have shown us in
a whole movie.
Plays tomorrow night at

The Rules of the Game (1939)
Cubberley Auditorium
"One starts with the environ
ment to arrive at the self," wrote
Jean Renoir, "i remain a man of
the 19th century, and 1 need ob
servation as a point of
departure." Having chronicled
the death "throes of the
European uristocntkey in Grand
Illusion, Renoir set this film,
made two years later, among the
new aristocracy in France: the
nouveaux riches, for whom love
is a game with a fixed set of
rules, and to break them — as
the anachronistic, romantic
aviator Jurieu (Roland Toutain)
does — is in bad taste and
therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approach
ing his subject triumphs: Rules
of the Game is both a social and
a psychological drama, and it's
one that was almost lost to us
forever — the original negative
was destroyed by the Nazis and
the film was reassembled from
bits and pieces in the 19505.
Renoir worked with Carl Koch
on the screenplay (based loosely
on Alfred de Musset's "Les
Caprices de Marianne"); Claude
Renoir shot it; Coco Chanel de

signed the costumes. The super
lative cast includes Marcel Dalio
(he played the Jew, Rosenthal,
in Grand Illusion), Nora Gregor,
Mila Parely, Odette Talazac,
Julien Carette, Paulette Dubost
and Renoir himself.
Plays Monday evening at 8.
Blade Rjunner (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The Los Angeles of this film
— set in 2019 — is a neon
dotted landscape with electric
fires flashing out of chimneys
and aircraft soaring overhead
like hallucinatory bubbles; from

below, you see enormous adver
tising images projected on float
ing screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the
production designer, Lawrence
Paull, and the photographer,
Jordan Croenenworth, have
created a future with enough vis
ual connections to the past and
the present to be particularly
eerie, and Douglas Turnbull's
special effects are often as
tonishing. Yet it's a cold, repel
lent movie. The story (from a
wry*ci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick
Culled "Do Android* Dream of
Electric Sheep") concerns a
bounty hunter assigned to
"retire" a deceptively human
seeming model of robot and
unable to do his job without
feeling guilt. But Ridley Scott is
not the right director for a movie
that asks for emotional fullness;
his chief concern is how to stage
the violence in freshly shocking,
abstractly beautiful ways. With
Harrison Ford (who seems to be
on automatic pilot), Rutger
Hauer, Daryl Hannah and
others.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with The Road Warrior.
All the Right Moves (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
As the high school football
coach impatient to land a college
job and escapc from the Penn

sylvania steel town he's trapped
in, Craig T. Nelson lends a touch
of authenticity to this mediocre
drama, directed (first time out)
by the gifted cinematographer
Michael Chapman from a script
by Michael Kane. Nelson has a
supporting role, but he acts with
a frightening intensity that
makes the movie's nominal lead,
Tom Cruise, seem like small fry.
Not a terrible picture — just dis
mayingly routine.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Risky Business.

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Anthony Burgess' novel was a
satire on the polarized state he
felt Western society was ap
proaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is
"rehabilitated" by behavioral
psychologists, i.e., reduced to a
benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alterna
tives social and anti-social
conduct — are equally repug
nant. But in Stanley Kubrick's
film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of soci
ety's representatives are such
megalomaniacal halfwits — that
we are manipulated into cheer
ing for his highly objectionable
acts of rebellion. Shrewdly,
Kubrick has cast vivacious, win
ning Malcolm McDowell — a
performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex.
This is a morally questionable
film, directed in such an imper
sonal manner that even the vio
lence doesn't affect us; it seems
to transpire in a vacuum.
Plays today with 2001: A
Space Odyssey.
La Cage aux Folles (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script by Jean Poiret,
Edouard Molinaro, Francis
Veber and Marcello Danon is
the cleverest variation yet on the
oft-tried comic theme of the par
ent who pretends to be someth
ing he is not for the good of his
child. (Damon Runyon may

have been the first to use it, in
his story "Madam La Gimp.")
Ugo Tognazzi plays Renato,
whose son has just become en
gaged to the daughter of a reac
tionary, highly placed govern
ment official. The girl's parents
naturally wish to meet their in
tended in-law, but that poses a
delicate problem: Renato is an
avowed homosexual who lives
with his long-time lover, Albin,

played by Michel Serrault (who
gives a magnificent comic per
formance). The direction (by
Molinaro) is sloppy, and the
stage origins are uncomfortably
clear in the structure of some of
the scenes, but these flaws seem
terribly unimportant when Ser
rault is on screen. When he
walks, every movable part of his
body flutters through a series of
carefully prearranged poses; he
gets more comic mileage out of
his clothing than almost any
other actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow with La Cage
aux Folles 11.
La Traviata (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
It may be a long time before
jiou'll heari a Tnaviatti. iut.iMotlh
sung (by Teresa Stratas, Placido
Domingo, Cornell MacNeil and
others) and conducted (by the
Met's James Levine), but you
have to contend with director
Franco Zeffirelli's imagination,
which is 19th-century in the
worst way: He turns everything
into confectionery. When this
Violetta tells Germont she's
been happy with his son Alfredo,
she gazes at a cage of doves;
when she strives to decide be
tween a life of heedless pleasure
and true love, images of Alfredo
confront her in every doorway.
Since Zeffirelli has ensured that
the decor will upstage the singers
in every scene, it's not surprising
that we keep forgetting about
the drama and get caught up in
other questions, like who in
Paris has enough money to keep
Violetta in a mansion the size of
Versailles, and why doesn't she

have more than one servant?
Teresa Stratas certainly looks
the role of the consumptive
dame aux camelias, and she can
act it, too (though /.eftirelli lets
her overact), but Domingo just
pulls with overemphatic virility
at his coat lapels and screws his
face up to express despair. (He
also looks about 10 years
younger than his "father. Cor
nell MacNeil.) Yes, yes, the
Verdi music is divine, but you
have to go to this movie in a
mood of real romantic abandon
in order to survive it without gig
gling.
Plays Sunday with Blood
Wedding.
Educating Rita (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
On stage Willy Russell's 1480
play, a smash in London's West
End. may have some of the ap
peal of "Pygmalion" and "Born
Yesterday"and the other inter
class pedagogical romances on
which it's built, but in this pro
duction, inconsistently filled out
for the screen (Russell wrote his
own screenplay) and miserably
staged and directed by Lewis
Gilbert, there's no way to tell for
certain. The only reason to see it
is Michael Caine, who — as a
drunken, disenchanted English
professor brought back to life by
a young woman he tutors —
turns a sow's ear of a part into a
silk purse. Julie Walters, repeat
ing her stage performance, is a
glazed-eyed zombie of an actress
who reads her lines as if spon
taneity were a crime against na
ture.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Experience Preferred But
Not Essential.
