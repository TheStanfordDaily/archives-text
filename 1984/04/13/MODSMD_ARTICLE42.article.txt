# Experts debate on U.S. missile

### SHEILA MANKANI 
What the United States considers
"one of its few foreign policy suc
cesses' — deployment of intermediate
land-hased missiles in Western
Europe — is actually "an outstanding
failure," said Douglas Mattern, direc
tor of the World Citizens International
Registry and a writer and lecturer on
disarmament.
Mattern faced Gerald Frost, execu
tive director of the Institute for
European Defense and Strategic
Studies, at a debate held yesterday af
ternoon in Branner Lounge entitled
"NATO and the Nuclear Deploy
ment: Where Do We Go From
Here?"
Even though Mattern claimed that
the SS-20 land-based missiles which
the Soviets developed did not ap
preciably increase the threat to
Europe, the development of the
Cruise and Pershing II missiles as well
as other weapons "are touted by the
U.S. as admirable."
Mattern pointed out that while the
Soviets' SS-20s are not able to reach
the United States, American Pershing
II missiles "only take minutes and
reach all major cities in the Soviet
Union," and "all you have to do is put
more fuel in it (a Pershing missile) and
it can reach downtown Moscow."
Stating that "nations go to war gen
erally as a result of a military calcula
tion," Frost claimed, "I don't think
the advent of nuclear weaponry has
changed that part of the situation at
all."
Mattern attacked those responsible
for making such calculations, charging
that "many of the decisions that will
affect the future of humanity are made
in the most haphazard way." He
added that "the military-industrial
complex is responsible for many of the
weapons produced in America. The
rationale for those weapons systems

4 have to be developed by the Pent
■. agon."
"Military spending under the
Nixon, Ford, and Carter administra
i tions fell," countered Frost, adding.
: "Reagan is trying to correct this im
balance. I don't think his perception is
wrong."
Criticizing the creators of U.S.
foreign policy, Mattern asserted that
"they've had plenty of opportunities
to cut down the arms race," but have
endorsed the development of new and
more sophisticated weapons systems
instead. He said that "as far back as
1979 Leonid Brezhnev was willing to
cut down the number of Soviet SS
-2()s" yet this suggestion was ignored as
were later Soviet gestures.
"A nuclear freeze will lock
America's technological inferiority
into place," claimed Frost.
Mattern responded that "any
neutral weapons experts I've spoken
to have said that our technology is at
least three to five years ahead of Rus
sia's. This inferiority is simply a bogus
issue." «
"The Soviets have always been con
sistent in their actions," said Frost.
"Their military buildup has been con
tinuous and accompanied by a process
of expansion in other countries which
is not matched by anything on the
American or Western side," he said.
Claiming that the Soviet Union is a
"country that wants and needs peace
desperately," Mattern denied that the
Soviet Union exhibits expansionist
tendencies. "Their vast military ma
chine is built, not on paranoia, but on
a fear based on their historical experi
ences. Their feelings are understan
dable."
"We perceive the Soviet threat as a
haunting specter. What threat?" asked
Mattern. He continued, "the freeze
will stop the madness (of erroneous
threats) and there is no other way to
stop it."
