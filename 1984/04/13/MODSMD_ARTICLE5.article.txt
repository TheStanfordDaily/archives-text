... change the rules.
During a publicity stunt in White Plaza yesterday, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy tossed softballs to
dump a jeering Council-of-Presidents member into the
icy waters of a dunking tank. But after a few minutes of
more miss than hit, Kennedy appeared to give up.
Through quick thinking, however, the president found a
way to prevail after all. He cheated. Kennedy rushed
the dunking booth and pushed the plunger, dropping a
startled Peter Spivack into the tank. Kennedy left con
tented, and Spivack sank to the bottom.
