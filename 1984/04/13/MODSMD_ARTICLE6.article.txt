"Cliveden is a country estate with trees and
flowers. There are more pubs in Oxford.'' said
Mark Mancall. director of Overseas Studies.
The first group of students to exchange the
countryside estate for the relatively cosmopolitan
city of Oxford and enter Stanford's new British
campus this fall has recently been selected.
According to Michael Jackson, assistant director
of Overseas Studies. onl> 52 of 155 applicants
were accepted for the new Oxford program.
"We knew it would be competitive and it was.
It's more competitive than any other campus.'" he
said. The group will include 3li men and 22 women
from 27 different maiors. There will be 10 son

homores, 29 juniors and 13 seniors.
Jackson said all students were considered
equally tor admission. "Emphasis was given to the
fact that juniors were graduating earlier, but it was
not an overriding factor in the decision." he said.
Special pre-Oxford courses in the Humanities
and Sciences will be required of future Oxford stu
dents. Mancall said.
"The assumption that England is so like us that
we don't have to study is not true. Just because we
share the same language, it is not the same culture.
"People assume that since they know English
they are prepared for English culture, when En
glish culture is really as different from ours as
French culture," he said.
According to Jackson, the academic program
committee feels that the required courses will al

low students to derive more from their courses at
Oxford.
"We're really trying to emphasize that it is a
very serious academic program. Students will
begin to engage in courses here that emphasize
studies there" he said.
However, Jackson said he did not feel that the
Oxford campus would he academically more diffi
cult than any other campus.
â€¢ | hate to say that one campus is more rigorous
than another. It depends on the student's ap
proach. and we hope that all students approach
overseas studies in a serious way." he said.
Mancall said the competition for spots at Oxford
will diminish as time goes on.
