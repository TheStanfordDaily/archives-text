Houses work out Salvador aid
W ashington — Congressional leaders, still deeply divided
over the course of U.S. policy in Central America, agreed late
vesterday to allow the Reagan administration to draw $32
million in emergency funding to help the government of El
Salvador continue fighting rebel forces.
I lie agreement, reached in a flurry of backstage maneuver
ing. left unsettled the larger questions of what role the U.S.
should play in aiding covert operations to topple Nicaragua's
Sandinista government and how large its ultimate aid package
to El Salvador will be.
It was announced as the House moved toward passage of a
measure identical to Tuesday's Senate resolution, passed
overwhelmingly, denouncing the use of U.S. funds for the
mining of Nicaraguan harbors. House and Senate negotiators
are expected to meet after Congress' one-week Easter break,
which begins today, to work out their differences over longer
range funding aimed at Central America.
Leaders of both houses indicated that they would not ob
ject if the Reagan administration obtains the funding through
one of two options: diverting resources from other programs,
a procedure known technically as "reprogramming," or
drawing upon a special emergency fund that contains about
$75 million.
"It's now in their hands to tell us what they want to do,"
said an aide to Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.). The administration indicated that it was weighing
both options and had not determined which it would take.
Gunmen hijack Israeli bus
Jerusalem — Gunmen believed to be Arab terrorists
hijacked an Israeli civilian bus last night and held about 15
passengers hostage in the Gaza Strip near the Egyptian bor
der.
The hijackers, reportedly five men armed with guns, knives
and hand grenades, demanded the release of Arab prisoners
held by the Israeli authorities.
Israel's military censors blacked out many of the details,
but some information emerged about the drama, which began
about 7 p.m. and was continuing through the early hours this
morning.
Eight passengers, including the driver, reportedly escaped,
although some reports said that some of them might have
been wounded. Two pregnant women were later released by
the hi jackers.
The British Broadcasting Corporation said Israeli security
forces shot out the tires of the bus to prevent it from moving
again from its location in a village near the town of Rafah,
which is bisected by the border between the Israeli-occupied
Gaza Strip and the Egyptian Sinai.
Senate votes on tax increases
Washington — The Senate refused yesterday to kill a tax
increase on liquor or spread it to wine as it worked its way
through a complex election-year bill that would raise federal
revenues by $48 billion over the next three years.
The votes were a blow to the distilled spirits industry, which
is hurting from a decline in sales and had fought vigorously
against its inclusion in the bill. The Senate provision would
add about 41) cents to taxes on a fifth of 100-proof liquor and
about 35 cents to the cost of a fifth of 86-proof.
.. A .compvxuhlu--tpasaed Wednesday l-hnute
would raise taxes even higher, 75 cents for a fifth of 100-
proof and 60 cents for one of 86-proof.
In other action, the Senate voted to limit tax breaks for
luxury automobiles used for business and to extend until Dec.
31.1985, tax credits for residential energy saving efforts such
as installing insulation.
The Senate also 'agreed to eliminate tax-exempt bond
income in calculating whether Social Security recipients must
pay taxes on some of their benefits.
OAS chastises former leader
Washington — The Organization of American States
(OAS) yesterday formally chastised its former secretary gen
eral. Alejandro Orfila, branding his employment with a
prominent Washington public relations firm during his last
three months at the OAS "censurable."
A resolution approved 26-0 by the OAS's permanent coun
cil labeled Orfila's dual employment, for which he received
$75,000 from the firm of Gray and Co. and $22,000 in OAS
salary , "incompatible with his status as a senior international
civil servant."
"This (action) puts an end to the era of frivolity in this or
ganization," said Bolivian Ambassador Fernando Salazar
after the roll call vote. "We have opened the door to a new
phase." Salazar called the public reprimand a "process of
purification" for the OAS.
Orfila. 58, a former Argentine ambassador to Washington,
was not present during the hour's debate that preceded yes
terday's vote and could not be reached for comment.
Senators sponsor bill restoring
broad anti-bias interpretation
Washington — Civil rights legislation to restore broad in
terpretation of anti-discrimination laws, already the focus of
strong bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House,
was introduced in Congress yesterday.
Leaders of both houses said they expected swift action on
the bill, known as the Omnibus Civil Rights Act of 1984. Sen.
Robert Packwood (R-Ore.) one of the bill's three original
sponsors, predicted "overwhelming and speedy passage, with
or without the administration's support."
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) another of the original spon
sors. said passage of the legislation was necessary to protect
civil rights, which he said were "grossly undermined " by a
Feb. 28 Supreme Court decision in a sex-discrimination case.
At that time, the court ruled 6-3 that the law that bans sex
discrimination at institutions receiving federal funds applied
solely to the particular program benefiting from the aid. Spe
cifically, in the case of Grove City College in Pennsylvania,
the court said that a college that receives federal aid for stu
dent loans must ban sex discrimination only in the financial
aid programs, not in athletics or other areas.
The court's ruling was read as an acceptance of the Reagan
administration's position that acceptance of federal funds
does not subject an entire institution to federal regulation un
der the law. known as Title IX. Representatives of women's
groups and other civil rights organizations expressed outrage
at the time of the decision.
