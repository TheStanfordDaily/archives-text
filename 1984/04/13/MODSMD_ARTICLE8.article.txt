# CIA mining funds may run out next week

From The Washington Post
VSashington â€” The operations arm of the CIA that
oversees its secret war against the leftist Sandinista gov
ernment of Nicaragua has been notified that monev for
the program could run out next week, perhaps as soon
as Sunday, and steps should be taken to begin dis
engagement. senior administration sources said yester
day.
Congressional Democrats, reacting to news reports
about direct CIA involvement in the mining of several
Nicaraguan harbors, have predicted that the House will
refuse to approve $21 million President Reagan has re
quested to continue the covert operation.
Republican members of Congress and administration
officials said they still hope to win approval of the fun
ding after next week's congressional recess.
The CIA-supported "Contra" guerrillas still may
have enough money to operate for several more weeks,
but $22 million of the current $24 million for their sup
port was spent by the end of last month, the sources
said, and it appears that the Reagan administration is
uncertain about what to do next.
CIA Director William Casey is considering the possi
bility of asking another country, such as Saudi Arabia,

to send money to the Contras until the funding problem
is solved, according to one well-placed source, but no
decisions have been made. ,
Casey is viewed inside the CIA as the primary
moving force behind the secret war against Nicaragua
and the controversial mining of its harbors.
"Casey cooked this whole thing up." one informed
source said.
But Casey's enthusiasm for the covert operation in
Nicaragua is not widely shared among senior CIA offi
cials despite Casey's popularity because of the greatly
increased funding he has secured for the agency.
John McMahon, the ClA's No. 2 man. who has 33
years of experience, believed from the beginning that
the Nicaraguan operation was ill-conceived, according
to an official familiar with his thinking.
"John just knew it would come to this where there
would not be enough public and congressional support
and we'd withdraw," the official said.
McMahon reportedly has argued that, after the
American intelligence community scandals of the
19705, it is now a time to rebuild the ClA's
intelligence-gathering capabilities rather than risk more
damage to it with uncertain covert operations.

Ask oil about this, a CIA spokesman said that,
whatever personal opinions MeMahon may have voiced
about specific operations in staff discussions, he is not
opposed to am ongoing CIA operations. Several
sources said the mining of Nicaragua was not intended
to stop the How of arms from the Sandinistas to leftist
rebels in nearbv HI Salvador, which is one the justifica
tions that Congress has been given for the covert opera
tion against Nicaragua.
"It's harassment pure and simple." said one adminis
tration official, "and designed to keep them busy. ;i di
version."
The State Department has issued a legal opinion,
circulated in the Senate Select Committee on Intelli
gence. say ing the harbor mining is "self-defense" and
designed to stem the unlawful flow of arms. A senior
administration official said yesterday, "unfortunately
it's bull " and would add to the perception that one
hand of the administration does not know what the
other is doing.
Administration sources said attacks by the ClA
supported anti-Sandinista guerrillas have had a serious
impact on the Nicaraguan economy but have not
slowed the How of arms into El Salvador.
