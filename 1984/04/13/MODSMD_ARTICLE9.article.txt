# Shuttle finishes satellite repair mission
## 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Houston — The repaired Solar Max
was successfully returned to orbit yester
day, completing the world's first in-flight
service call.
After Challenger's robot arm let go of
the satellite more than 300 miles above
the Earth, NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., re
ported that Solar Max was functioning
properly and would now undergo 30
days of tests before resuming its task of
studying solar flares.
"Satellite servicing is something that's
here to stay," the commander of the
shuttle, Robert Crippen. said in a press
conference from space a few hours later.
Crippen and his crew wore T-shirts
that said, "Ace Satellite Repair C 0.,"
and Crippen extended the shuttle's
motto to "We pick up. repair and
deliver." Previous shuttle crews, called

upon mostly to launch communications
satellites, had taken as their motto "We
deliver."
Crippen, the pilot of the first shuttle
(light three years ago yesterday, said he
and John Young, commander of that first
flight, never expected the shuttle pro
gram to come so far in three years, but he
foresaw still more progress in the next
three.
The success of the Solar Max repair
mission, which had seemed in jeopardy
Sunday when the satellite tumbled out of
control, bolsters NASA's desire to
retrieve one or both of the communica
tions satellites that were put in useless
orbits in February. Both satellites experi
enced rocket failures following their
launch from the shuttle.
"I know we can do it," said Lt. Gen.
James Abrahamson, the outgoing head
of the shuttle program, in an interview.

The final decision about retrieving the
satellites rests with their owners. West
ern Union and the government of In
donesia, which are weighing a number of
factors, including insurance coverage.
Solar Max, which was nearly lost after
the first attempt to capture it on Sunday
failed, was finally caught on Tuesday by
the shuttle's 50-foot mechanical arm and
was repaired on Wednesday before being
dropped off in space at 4:26 a.m. EST
yesteday.
Live television pictures showed the
arm letting go and drawing slowly away.
Then the shuttle backed up and stood bv
for a half hour until the controllers in
Maryland were satisfied that Solar Max
was no longer in need of assistance.
Controllers said Solar Max was stable
on its own in orbit, "dead on the sun" to
keep its batteries charged. The satellite
showed none of the spinning tendency

that kept it from studying the sun for the
past three years.
"It doesn't look right." joked
astronaut George Nelson, an
astronomer. "It isn't spinning."
In answer to reporters' questions.
Crippen said yesterday that his un
successful attempt to grapple Solar Max
on Sunday after the spacewalking Nelson
was unable to latch onto it seemed like
the right thing to do at the time even
though it used up much of the shuttle's
maneuvering fuel.
"In retrospect, if 1 had known we
would he able to stabilize the satellite 1
would have probably backed out ear
lier,'' he said. "The satellite was rotating
at a speed and in a way that we had never
really attempted (in practice simulations)
and was probably not a viable thing to at
tempt."
