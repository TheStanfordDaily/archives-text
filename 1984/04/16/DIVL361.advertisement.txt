FORESTRY ASSIGNMENTS
for SCIENCE MAJORS
About 550 Peace Corps Volunteers are engaged in forestry and natural resource
projects in over 45 developing nations. Another 300 are requested, with the
demand expected to increase because of growing awareness of tropical
deforestation.
Peace Corps forestry projects usually fall into the following categories:
• REFORESTATION: Large-scale tree planting is restricted to areas judged
better suited to growing trees than to farming.
• VILLAGE WOODLOTS: Smaller scale plantings, 3to 10 acres, supply
fuelwood, poles, posts, and other construction materials.
• AGROFORESTRY: This system of land management combines the
production of wood crops for human food and for animal fodder.
• INTRODUCTION OF WOOD CONSERVING TECHNOLOGIES: These
may include more efficient stoves, improved charcoaling techniques, or uses of
wood most consistant with its physical properties.
• NATIONAL FORESTS: Planning, developing and carefully harvesting
national forests to preserve resources and to utilize the harvest to better the
lives of local people.
