# On the campaign trail
## Mondale pulls no surprises

San Francisco â€” "This is the campaign trail. When
the candidates are in the state, we've got to follow them
around."
The reporter slipped a little tape recorder into her
purse and smiled hesitantly at a cluster of other
reporters shuffling out the door of a meeting room in
the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero.
Presidential aspirant Walter Mondale, along with
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, had just ducked
out a different exit, putting an abrupt end to a Friday
press conference that attracted about 100 people.
The reporter's voice rose slightly. "At least there's
still time for lunch," she said, one of her ankles snared
in an electric wire leading from a corner outlet to some
microphones atop a podium at the front of the room.
The former vice president had stood there moments
before, reminding everyone that a California victory
could be crucial to securing the Democratic nomina
tion.

You could remember he'd been standing there by the
the big blue-and-white "Welcome, Walter Mondale"
banner on the wall. It would remain hanging for an
other five minutes before a pair of campaign workers
rolled it up and carried it off, presumably to some
future engagement.
The reporter had to hurry. Her friends were already
out the door, and the news editor wanted her back at
the office in San Diego within hours.
If she squeezed in a meal now, she'd have more than
enough time to write up the story on the flight home.
The conference fizzled, the press left. Mondale's visit
probably wasn't overblown because nobody bothered
to make a big deal about it.
This is not to give the impression of singling out this
candidate from the others, or of underscoring the im
portance of any stop on the campaign trail.
But for at least some of the reporters committed to
