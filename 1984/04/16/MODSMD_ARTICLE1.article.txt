# On the campaign trail
## Mondale pulls no surprises 
### TROY EID Daily staff 
San Francisco — "This is the campaign trail. When
the candidates are in the state, we've got to follow them
around."
The reporter slipped a little tape recorder into her
purse and smiled hesitantly at a cluster of other
reporters shuffling out the door of a meeting room in
the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero.
Presidential aspirant Walter Mondale, along with
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, had just ducked
out a different exit, putting an abrupt end to a Friday
press conference that attracted about 100 people.
The reporter's voice rose slightly. "At least there's
still time for lunch," she said, one of her ankles snared
in an electric wire leading from a corner outlet to some
microphones atop a podium at the front of the room.
The former vice president had stood there moments
before, reminding everyone that a California victory
could be crucial to securing the Democratic nomina
tion.

You could remember he'd been standing there by the
the big blue-and-white "Welcome, Walter Mondale"
banner on the wall. It would remain hanging for an
other five minutes before a pair of campaign workers
rolled it up and carried it off, presumably to some
future engagement.
The reporter had to hurry. Her friends were already
out the door, and the news editor wanted her back at
the office in San Diego within hours.
If she squeezed in a meal now, she'd have more than
enough time to write up the story on the flight home.
The conference fizzled, the press left. Mondale's visit
probably wasn't overblown because nobody bothered
to make a big deal about it.
This is not to give the impression of singling out this
candidate from the others, or of underscoring the im
portance of any stop on the campaign trail.
But for at least some of the reporters committed to

covering every press conference at
every hotel, every patriotic pitch to
every Elks club, every $100-a-plate
dinner for every local chapter of every
splinter of American politics — there
must be lots of deja vu.
Always the candidate, looking and
sounding pretty much the same as he
did three hours ago in Modesto. And
always your counterpart from the Or
ange County Register or the
Sacramento Bee, trying to do your job
maybe just a little better than you do.
Reporters smug in their intimate
relationships with Fritz and Gary and
Jesse, even if they've never met.
To the person just happening to
walk past the Hyatt on the way back
from lunch, the mini-drama of an ar
riving could-be head-of-state was just
a taste of what promises to be an excit
ing summer.
First a siren, then a small squadron
of policemen sealing off the block.
Then procession, and finally a black
limosine sliding up to the curb amid a
swelling crowd of media, well-wishers,
<?vii-wishers unci s» </<n /Jink htare
Krishnas in Nike tennis shoes chanting
the maha-mantra.
As the Secret Service agents try to
clear a path to the hotel, the candidate
shakes hands below a canopy of
microphones.
He probably can't see the half
comedian, half-lunatic in a hard hat

and Ray-Bans yelling, "I am the can
didate fighting for a liberal, non
colloquial America"from atop a
bench a few yards away. He probably
can't hear the young executive in the
brown three-piece suit mumbling,
"Just get us out of Central America"
from somewhere beyond all those
journalists and their probing ques
tions.
The audience fades out as Mondale
glides through the door, where the
media faces a low-level dilemma:
whether to stick with the candidate,
hoping he'll reward them with an
informative-filled aside, or to rush
ahead and grab the best possible seat
in the quickly-filling conference room.
But the inside atmosphere is
decidely non-electric. Reporters seem
more interested in renewing acquain
tances and setting up equipment than
with Mondale's five-minute prepared
statement on the evils of President
Reagan's consumption tax or the fol
lowing 15-minute question-and
answering, during which nothing of
any real interest is discussed.
The conference is over. Mondale
and Feinstein head out the door, and
one reporter turns to another.
"What paper are you with?"
"The Tribune."
*'/ hope y<.*u all the way
up here for this."
Pause.
"No, I guess not. Now I'm supposed
to go over to Mondale's headquarters
at 300 Market."
"I bet you can't wait."
"You bet. It's a good thing I've
already eaten lunch."

can't hear the young executive in the
brown three-piece suit mumbling,
"Just get us out of Central America"
from somewhere beyond all those
journalists and their probing ques
tions.
The audience fades out as Mondale
glides through the door, where the
media faces a low-level dilemma:
whether to stick with the candidate,
hoping he'll reward them with an
informative-filled aside, or to rush
ahead and grab the best possible seat
in the quickly-filling conference room.
But the inside atmosphere is
decidely non-electric. Reporters seem
more interested in renewing acquain
tances and setting up equipment than
with Mondale's five-minute prepared
statement on the evils of President
Reagan's consumption tax or the fol
lowing 15-minute question-and
answering, during which nothing of
any real interest is discussed.
The conference is over. Mondale
and Feinstein head out the door, and
one reporter turns to another.
"What paper are you with?"
"The Tribune."
*'/ hope y<.*u all the way
up here for this."
Pause.
"No, I guess not. Now I'm supposed
to go over to Mondale's headquarters
at 300 Market."
"I bet you can't wait."
"You bet. It's a good thing I've
already eaten lunch."
