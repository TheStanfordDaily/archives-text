# Moynihan resigns committee post

From The Washington Post
Washington â€” Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-
N.Y.) resigned yesterday from the vice chairmanship ot
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence because
he said the CIA broke its "relationship of trust" by
failing to inform the committee about its direct role in
the mining of Nicaraguan harbors.
Moynihan made his decision known in an interview
filmed Friday in his office and broadcast yesterday on
ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley." He said in a
statement from his office that the resignation was "the
most emphatic way I can express my view that the Sen
ate committee was not properly briefed on the mining
of Nicaraguan harbors with American mines from an
American ship under American command."

He said in a later telephone interview that a C IA
briefing March 8 contained only a one-sentence refer
ence in an 84-page transcript on the activities ot Un
supported rebels in Nicaragua. An aide said the sen
tence was phrased passively, so that the senators were
told only that "magnetic mines have been placed" in
three harbors, without an explanation of the direct U.S.
role.
The issue of what senators knew about the mining
and when they knew it has become an interesting
sidelight to the overall question of U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua.
Other senators on the committee have said they did
know the CIA was directing the mining operation.
Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Malcolm Wallop (R-

Wyo.), both members of the intelligence committee,
told ABC they were aware of the U.S. role before the
debate two weeks ago in which the Senate approved
$21 million for continued U.S. covert activity in
Nicaragua.
"The committee has been fully informed on all the
activities, including that one, and to claim otherwise is
disingenuous," Wallop said.
Leahy said, "There were senators who voted one way
the week before and a different way the following
week, who knew about the mining in both instances,
and I think were influenced solely by the public
opinion. And I think that's wrong and that's a lousy job
of legislative action."
