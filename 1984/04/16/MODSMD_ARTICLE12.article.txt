Niearaguan mining
The United States' role in the
mining of Nicaraguan harbors
came under broad attack from
American allies and both parties
in Congress last week. The ad
ministration s policy of aiding
the rebels, starting three years
ago, has now set the scene for a
major foreign policy debate in
this year's presidential cam
paign.
As unease built during the
week the Reagan administration
denied that American military
pilots had flown into combat in
El Salvador and that the Pent
agon had contingency plans for
further action in Central
America pending President
Reagan's re-election. Reagan
also used his emergency "draw
down" authority to assign $32
million in aid to El Salvador be
cause he was unable to persuade
Congress to speed the addi
tional money for helicopters,
ammunition, medical supplies
and spa.'; parts.
The W, 'te House is hoping
Congress wi.' authorize the aid
within 120 da, s; the mood as
Congress brok, for Easter
recess, however, was not con
ciliatory and the latest
"emergency" action did not
help. "I think it's wrong, wrong,
wrong," Maryland Democrat
Clarence Long said.
Barry Goldwater, an Arizona
Republican who chairs the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee and
usually supports the president,
said in a sharp letter to CIA
Director William Casey that the
mining was a violation of inter
national law. "It is an act of
war," he wrote. "For the life of
me I don't see how we're going
to explain it."
Democratic House Speaker
Thomas O'Neill said, "I have
contended that the Reagan Ad
ministration's secret war against
Nicaragua was morally indefen
sible. Today it is clear that it is
legally indefensible as well."
British Prime Minister Mar
garet Thatcher condemned the
mining as being dangerous to in

ternational shipping. France
also condemned the United
States' actions.
The Reagan Administration's
withdrawal from the jurisdiction
of the World Court only two
days before Nicaragua took its
case there and reports of direct
U.S. involvement in the port
mining fueled the uproar to the
point that a bill to provide $21
million in new money for the

Nicaraguan rebels seems
headed for defeat in the House.
The extreme shift in congres
sional sentiment became ob
vious in votes taken by both
houses. In the Senate, 41
Republicans, including the
majority leader, Howard Baker,
joined in an overwhelming non
binding vote against the admin
istration. The Senate vote fol
lowed similar action in the
House.
Reagan has been careful to
avoid personal identification
with the volatile issue knowing

the potential effect it could have
on his bid for re-election. The
Democratic candidates,
however, have jumped on the
topic.
Former Vice President Wal
ter Mondale said, "... If this
pattern of irresponsibility and
deception continues, I predict
America could be involved in a
full-scale war in Central
America." Colorado Sen. Gary

Hart deplored the "return to the
cowboy days of the CIA." The
Rev. Jesse Jackson suggested
that the president could be re
sponsible for "an impeachable
offense."
Campaigns head west
After last Tuesday's Pennsyl
vania primary the three candi
dates went their separate ways
and tried to find what has
been lacking in their cam
paigns. Former Vice President
Walter Mondale headed out to
California with significant vic-

tories in the northeastern labor
states. His quest: the votes
and money necessary to reach a
goal that now seems attainable,
winning a majority of conven
tion delegates before the end of
the primary season. Hart
retreated home to Colorado.
His quest: a new pair of cowboy
boots, a symbol of the region he
says is going to save his cam
paign. The Rev. Jesse Jackson
moved his campaign down to
Arizona. His quest: to add a few
more colors to his virtually
monochromatic "rainbow coali
tion" by attempting to recruit
Hispanics and American Indi
ans.
Mondale's clearcut victory
in Pennsylvania has set him in a
good position for what many see
as another phase of the cam
paign. His help from organized
labor made the difference be
tween a fair showing and a defi
nite win.
Though he shies away from
the title of front runner,
Mondale is, with nearly twice
the number of delegates held by
Hart, clearly in a dominant
position. He obviously feels
quite confident about his situa
tion since he has decided to take
a good part of this week off to
recuperate from the last few
weeks of heavy campaigning.
Mondale, however, may be
facing problems of a different
kind. Because he has been
confident that by spending
freely he could amass enough
delegates to assure his nomina
tion by the end of April, he has
already spent nearly $14 million
of the $20.2 million federal
spending limit. Hart, on the
other hand, has spent only $6
million, leaving his campaign
free to outspend Mondale three
or four times over. Mondale's
campaign manager Robert Be
ckel acknowledged that this was
true but he questioned Hart's
ability to raise the necessary
funds in the next 55 days.
Hart has adopted a fall-back
strategy for the rest of the cam

paign hoping to win enough of
the Western primaries and
caucuses to renew questions
about Mondales ability to defeat
Reagan in November. Then, ac
cording to Hart strategists,
delegates, who in any case are
not legally bound to a can
didate, will turn to the Hart
camp. Hart plans to push ques
tions on the legality and propri
ety of "independent delegate
committees," which are
financed by union political ac
tion committees and are helping
to pay for field staff and get
out-the-vote activities for the
Mondale campaign now that
Mondale is feeling a financial
squeeze.
Ace satellite repair
Last week's space shuttle mis
sion successfully accomplished
the first major in-orbit repair
job. The first attempt at captur

ing the malfunctioning Solar
Max, an orbiting solar obser
vatory, by a free-flying
astronaut over last weekend
failed. He actually worsened the
situation by sending the satellite
into an end-over-end spin.
Ground controllers were able to
stabilize the craft and the
astronauts brought Solar Max
into the cargo bay of the shuttle
using the mechanical arm.
The technicians then went to
work making the satellite func
tional again. They had to
replace the positioning box of
the satellite. This module
helped Solar Max point its in
struments by fixing the positions
of certain stars with tiny tele
scopes.
The repair was a much
needed triumph for the National
Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration shuttle program. Lieut.
Gen. James Abrahamson, the
outgoing head of the program,

noted, "The mission's sig
nificance is that it will change
the way designers around the
world think about satellites."
Future rescue missions will
depend on whether saving a
satellite is worth the expense.
"It no longer makes sense to
walk away from a satellite that
breaks down," said Dr. Frank
Cepollina, head of NASA's
satellite servicing program. That
was the case with Solar Max.
The cost of the rescue mission
came to $50 million with esti
mated replacement costs at
about $235 million. Cheaper
spacecraft rescues may not be as
compelling; for example the
case of the two communications
satellites, Westar-6 and Palapa
B-2 valued at $75 million each,
that were launched during
February's shuttle mission and
failed to achieve proper orbit.
