# No on Amendment 2
## 
### 
Figuring out exactly what Constitutional
Amendment No. 2 includes is no easy task. The
senate has lumped together three very unrelated
concerns into one package deal in hopes of get
ting them all by the students.
Not only do we not like such a questionable
technique, we don't like what's being snuck
through either. Mainly it is an effort to bypass the
very process of having students vote on matters of
constitutional proportion in the future.
The troubled section of this bill concerns the
selection and voting of graduate senators. Cur
rently graduate senators are elected by specific
districts defined by the school in which they are
enrolled. Supporters of Amendment 2 assert that
thr senate needs the power to change the system
to any way it so desires — even back to the old at
large process.
They did not have the guts to place a simple at
large constitutional change on the ballot. No. Pos
sibly tearing that students would vote down the
change, they opted to write a more complicated
amendment. This one wouldn't require a specific
change, but would leave that possibility open if
the senate, and not necessarily the students, sup
ported it. It effectively transfers the traditional

power of the students into the hands of the sen
ate.
In addition the bill would allow any graduate
alternate — to be determined by some arbitrary
senate ranking — to fill in for a graduate senator
who is absent from a senate meeting. While such
an effort seems like it would help to give graduate
students more of a senate voice — which they
need — it is begging the question of providing
better senate representation and accountabilty.
If the senate really wants to address the prob
lem of the lack of graduate students interested in
participating in the senate, it should look into how
little it has been doing for those students, and not
how it can increase its own power.
Unfortunately, the other two sections of
Amendment 2 — an assertion of the Council-of-
Presidents veto power and the removal of gender
specific pronouns from other sections of the con
stitution — can only pass if students vote for the
graduate districting "clarification" as described
above. These other referendums deserve support.
We hope they will be brought up under their own
auspices in another election after students vote
down amendment 2.
