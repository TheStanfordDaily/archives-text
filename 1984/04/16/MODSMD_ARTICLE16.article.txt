# Communism? Oh no!

Socialism. Communism. Ooooh.
There's somthing about those words
that sets a little red alert signal ringing
in every true American's head.
"Danger, Danger," it says, "Pull out
the garlic and crosses."
What is it with words? My grand
mother would probably flinch more if
I said, "Socialized medicine, gee, good
idea," than if 1 rattled off a string of
four-letter words. I wonder why. I
mean, this is a reflex action in most
Americans and, assuming that most
Americans have had about as much
practical experience with socialist and
communist systems as they've had
hunting the mythical Blue Bellied
Beastie from the jungles of Bora Bora,
the response is fairly difficult to ex
plain. So what's the big deal?
Well, you don't think I'd bother
writing my column about the subject if
1 wasn't sure 1 knew the answer, do
you? The big deal is that most U.S.
citizens can tell you socialism and
communism are wrong. Few of them
can tell you just whal the words mean.
but who cares as long as we know
they're bad?
1 must admit something now. My
strategy here was to give you nice, in
nocuous dictionary definitions of
socialism and communism to drive
home my point that the words in
themselves are harmless. But lo and
behold! My always-honest dictionary
has definitions of communism that are
guaranteed to raise any Republican's
hackles. But I don't care. I can have
more fun with these.
Get this. What does Webster's New

Collegiate Dictionary call a Commu
nist? Three guesses, a) Anyone unfor
tunate enough to live in Godless Rus
sia: b) Anyone unfortunate enough to
live in Godless Red China; c) One
held to engage in left-wing, sub
versive, or revolutionary activities.
Everyone who picked choice 'c' raise
your hands. Congratulations! You've
just won an all-expense-paid trip to
Provo, Utah. A communist is a sub
versive. revolutionary activist. Gosh,
and I always thought they were just
people who like to share. Silly me.
Who wants to bet that Russian dic
tionaries define "capitalist" as c) One
held to engage in right-wing, sub
versive, or revolutionary activities?
Communism gets a slightly kinder
definition. It's called "a system in
which goods are owned in common
and are available to all as needed."
Sounds like a neat idea. But wait, just
in case any naive, impressionable kids
stumble onto that definition and
decide maybe they'd like to try this
communism fhin√ü. Webster quickly
adds: "the official ideology of the
U.S.S.R." How's that for a gratuitous
scare tactic? Now, us enlightened col
lege kids know that communism hap
pens to be the ideology of lots of
places. But mentioning Moscow is a
simple way of earning the idea instant
dismissal.
Ah, but what about socialism? Take
this test: Socialism. Ungood, right?
Now . . . Communism! Double plus
ungood, right? Most people, includ
ing, apparently, Mr. Webster, are
more tolerant of socialism. (That

means they cringe less when someone
mentions the word.) I assume this is
because some of our allies-of-the
week follow this inferior system. So
the word socialism has a slightly dif
ferent use than the word communism,
which belongs in the Necrominicon.
Socialism is what wealthy people call
great ideas that they don't want to
implement because then they couldn't
be as rich as they are now.
It works like this: Someone suggests
that it might be nice to lessen the gap
between the rich and poor. Everyone
agrees that such an act would be ad
mirable, and some future-minded
politician devises a plan that would
halt the rich where they are and start
to raise the poor up to the level of the
rich. Everyone pats the politician on
the back and commends him for out
lining a system that helps the under
privileged without harming the
privileged. Then another politician
whose oldest son just graduated from
med school mentions that this idea
reeks of socialism. The proposnl
torn into millions of teeny-tiny pieces.
What happens now is that all the
pre-meds throw away my column and
say, "He's just an idealistic socialist;
his ideas would never work." Tee-hee.
I have bad news for you. I'm not a
socialist; I'm a freshman. I'm not ad
vocating any policy.
It's the theory you have to criticize,
not the words.
