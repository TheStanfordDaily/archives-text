## Women's Center provides a unique, valuable resource 
### 
Regarding The Daily's "no" re
commendation tor the Women's
Center funding request, I would like
to address two issues. First the Wo
men's Center only pays for 10 salary
hours each week. Staffers are paid
lust as they are at The Daily or at
SURE for administrative work such

as bookkeeping or publishing their
newsletter.
Second, in order to continue the
important services such as support
groups and small discussions, the
Women's Center needs to reach the
Stanford community with speakers
and films. These programs inform

students of the services available at
the Women's Center.
Since this organization provides a
unique and valuable resource for
Stanford, I urge all students to vote
for the Women's Center on April 17
and 18.

Contingent funds
I am writing to correct what I
believe are several mistaken impres
sions created by your story (Daily,
April 11) on a meeting of the ASSU
Senate.
Although your reporter was able to
quote me correctly, she did so out of
context. In particular, my comments
which appeared in the second para
graph of the article were made in
response to Doug Puffert's proposal,
which was not mentioned until almost
the last paragraph. My statement was
that if the senate planned to approve
contingent funding, it might as well
do so before the election, since
knowledge of the election outcome
would be irrelevant if we planned to
fund groups whose fee requests were
defeated.
Thus, if the senate agreed in princi
ple to the idea of contingent funding.
I saw no reason to delay making a
decision, since after the election
either contingent funding would be
unnecessary (for groups whose fee
passed), or the senate would be ig
noring the fact that the fee request
had been defeated by approving
contingent funding. My remarks were
then a statement as to when a deci
sion should be made, not an argu
ment for a particular decision.
In addition, the proposal for con
tingent funding was "Berg's" only in
a very technical sense. The requests
for such funding were reviewed ini
tially by the Program Board
(consisting of six non-senators and a
director) and later by the senate

Appropriations Committee
(consisting of six senators). I was the
author of the final bill making the
allocations in my capacity as the
co-chair of the Appropriations Com
mittee.
If there is strong opposition to the
contingency funding approved by the
senate, the senate's decision can be
overturned by a referendum.
Perhaps more important, The Daily
article failed to mention that the
senate approved an Association Fee
(excluding contingent funding) of
close to $2()(),()00 for next year, an
increase of approximately 9 percent
over the currcnt year. Other actions
taken by the senate, including a deci
sion not to allcoate $1000 for a visit
to campus this quarter by Walter
Mondale, also went unreported.

Film series
merits fees
Tuesday Films, Great Directors
Film Series plays artistic/educational
films free of charge each week. The
films are not commercially viable and
thus can only be played at art
museums and universities, where they
can he subsidized.
The film series is mislabled on the
ballot for ASSU elections as
"SMARTORTues. film Grt. Dir."
After refunds, the series will cost
each student an average of 25 to 30
cents each quarter. Students who
don't plan to attend can get this
refunded. Since "many of the films
show n are relevant to classes here,"
The Daily feels the film series should
be funded by the University directly
rather than through a fee assessment,
and therefore recommends voting
"no" on the series. All this will ac
complish is terminating the film se
ries. The University won't fund such a

film series and never has. This is the
reason this series was created last
year by students.
Please vote "yes" at the election.
About 450 people attend the series
each week. If you don't want to see
any of the films, vote "yes" and get
your 25 cents refunded each quarter.
Don't vote "no" and ruin things for
the rest of us.

Checking facts
Apparently The Daily Editorial
Board actually takes at face value the
"facts" presented in The Daily's news
stories. They should know better. 1
am referring specifically to the edito
rial "Bickering and by-laws" (Daily,
April 9).
If they had bothered to check their
facts they would have discovered that
there was no attempt to "control" the
opposition to the Special Fees (fee
assessments) up for approval in this
upcoming election.
On March 7, nine days before the
deadline for filing statements in op
position to those fees, I wrote a
memo to the elections commissioner
informing him that statements against
The Daily, the Band, the Concert
Network, SMARTOR and the Rape
Education Project fees would be
submitted in the coming week, and
that he should feel free to accept
statements opposing any other fee
submitted to him. This memo was
posted in the elections commission
office (where all election notices are
posted) for a week.
On March 12, four days before the
statement deadline, I wrote another
memo to the elections commissioner
informing him that some individuals
had expressed interest in submitting
opposition statements against The
Daily, the Band, the Concert Net
work. SMARTOR. the Rape Educa
tion Project, k/SU. the BSU and the

Women's Center fees. At that time I
formally relinquished my right to
submit statements iri opposition to
any fee except for the Concert Net
work and SMARTOR. This memo
was also posted in the elections com
mission office.
Throughout the weeks prior to the
deadline for submission of opposition
statements I encouraged everyone
who had expressed an interest in
writing statements. In addition to my
memos I kept in informal contact
with the elections commissioner to
ensure that no one who wanted to
write such a statement was dis
couraged.
In every such instance I relin
quished my right to submit such a
statement as soon as possible. At no
time did I discuss with these individ
uals what they intended to write, read
drafts or the final version of their
statements prior to submission to the
elections commissioner, or in any way
act as a "censor" of their ideas.
At all times I acted within the
complete spirit, as well as within the
letter, of the election rules. I tried
very hard to provide the student body
with some arguments against the
various fees, so that people could
more intelligently' debate their merits.
The complaints of Eric Diesel
(sponsor of the SMARTOR fee) do
not stem from some concern over
whether I acted properly (in all my
actions I have enjoyed the full sup
port of the elections commissioner).
Rather, he simply resents the fact that
someone was able to point out some
of the liabilities of his Special Fee.
As for The Daily, the Editorial
Board has allowed the organizations
requesting fees to appear before them
seeking endorsements, but has
refused to hear their opponents. It is
amazing that a news organization
such as The Daily apparently wishes
to stifle the debate on these fees.

mittee.
If there is strong opposition to the
contingency funding approved by the
senate, the senate's decision can be
overturned by a referendum.
Perhaps more important, The Daily
article failed to mention that the
senate approved an Association Fee
(excluding contingent funding) of
close to $2()(),()00 for next year, an
increase of approximately 9 percent
over the currcnt year. Other actions
taken by the senate, including a deci
sion not to allcoate $1000 for a visit
to campus this quarter by Walter
Mondale, also went unreported.

Film series
merits fees
Tuesday Films, Great Directors
Film Series plays artistic/educational
films free of charge each week. The
films are not commercially viable and
thus can only be played at art
museums and universities, where they
can he subsidized.
The film series is mislabled on the
ballot for ASSU elections as
"SMARTORTues. film Grt. Dir."
After refunds, the series will cost
each student an average of 25 to 30
cents each quarter. Students who
don't plan to attend can get this
refunded. Since "many of the films
show n are relevant to classes here,"
The Daily feels the film series should
be funded by the University directly
rather than through a fee assessment,
and therefore recommends voting
"no" on the series. All this will ac
complish is terminating the film se
ries. The University won't fund such a

film series and never has. This is the
reason this series was created last
year by students.
Please vote "yes" at the election.
About 450 people attend the series
each week. If you don't want to see
any of the films, vote "yes" and get
your 25 cents refunded each quarter.
Don't vote "no" and ruin things for
the rest of us.

Checking facts
Apparently The Daily Editorial
Board actually takes at face value the
"facts" presented in The Daily's news
stories. They should know better. 1
am referring specifically to the edito
rial "Bickering and by-laws" (Daily,
April 9).
If they had bothered to check their
facts they would have discovered that
there was no attempt to "control" the
opposition to the Special Fees (fee
assessments) up for approval in this
upcoming election.
On March 7, nine days before the
deadline for filing statements in op
position to those fees, I wrote a
memo to the elections commissioner
informing him that statements against
The Daily, the Band, the Concert
Network, SMARTOR and the Rape
Education Project fees would be
submitted in the coming week, and
that he should feel free to accept
statements opposing any other fee
submitted to him. This memo was
posted in the elections commission
office (where all election notices are
posted) for a week.
On March 12, four days before the
statement deadline, I wrote another
memo to the elections commissioner
informing him that some individuals
had expressed interest in submitting
opposition statements against The
Daily, the Band, the Concert Net
work. SMARTOR. the Rape Educa
tion Project, k/SU. the BSU and the

Women's Center fees. At that time I
formally relinquished my right to
submit statements iri opposition to
any fee except for the Concert Net
work and SMARTOR. This memo
was also posted in the elections com
mission office.
Throughout the weeks prior to the
deadline for submission of opposition
statements I encouraged everyone
who had expressed an interest in
writing statements. In addition to my
memos I kept in informal contact
with the elections commissioner to
ensure that no one who wanted to
write such a statement was dis
couraged.
In every such instance I relin
quished my right to submit such a
statement as soon as possible. At no
time did I discuss with these individ
uals what they intended to write, read
drafts or the final version of their
statements prior to submission to the
elections commissioner, or in any way
act as a "censor" of their ideas.
At all times I acted within the
complete spirit, as well as within the
letter, of the election rules. I tried
very hard to provide the student body
with some arguments against the
various fees, so that people could
more intelligently' debate their merits.
The complaints of Eric Diesel
(sponsor of the SMARTOR fee) do
not stem from some concern over
whether I acted properly (in all my
actions I have enjoyed the full sup
port of the elections commissioner).
Rather, he simply resents the fact that
someone was able to point out some
of the liabilities of his Special Fee.
As for The Daily, the Editorial
Board has allowed the organizations
requesting fees to appear before them
seeking endorsements, but has
refused to hear their opponents. It is
amazing that a news organization
such as The Daily apparently wishes
to stifle the debate on these fees.

Regarding The Daily's "no" re
commendation tor the Women's
Center funding request, I would like
to address two issues. First the Wo
men's Center only pays for 10 salary
hours each week. Staffers are paid
lust as they are at The Daily or at
SURE for administrative work such

as bookkeeping or publishing their
newsletter.
Second, in order to continue the
important services such as support
groups and small discussions, the
Women's Center needs to reach the
Stanford community with speakers
and films. These programs inform

students of the services available at
the Women's Center.
Since this organization provides a
unique and valuable resource for
Stanford, I urge all students to vote
for the Women's Center on April 17
and 18.

Contingent funds
I am writing to correct what I
believe are several mistaken impres
sions created by your story (Daily,
April 11) on a meeting of the ASSU
Senate.
Although your reporter was able to
quote me correctly, she did so out of
context. In particular, my comments
which appeared in the second para
graph of the article were made in
response to Doug Puffert's proposal,
which was not mentioned until almost
the last paragraph. My statement was
that if the senate planned to approve
contingent funding, it might as well
do so before the election, since
knowledge of the election outcome
would be irrelevant if we planned to
fund groups whose fee requests were
defeated.
Thus, if the senate agreed in princi
ple to the idea of contingent funding.
I saw no reason to delay making a
decision, since after the election
either contingent funding would be
unnecessary (for groups whose fee
passed), or the senate would be ig
noring the fact that the fee request
had been defeated by approving
contingent funding. My remarks were
then a statement as to when a deci
sion should be made, not an argu
ment for a particular decision.
In addition, the proposal for con
tingent funding was "Berg's" only in
a very technical sense. The requests
for such funding were reviewed ini
tially by the Program Board
(consisting of six non-senators and a
director) and later by the senate

Appropriations Committee
(consisting of six senators). I was the
author of the final bill making the
allocations in my capacity as the
co-chair of the Appropriations Com
mittee.
If there is strong opposition to the
contingency funding approved by the
senate, the senate's decision can be
overturned by a referendum.
