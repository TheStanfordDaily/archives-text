## Professor's commentary: Ronald Hilton Mexico: Will change be wrought by revolution? 
### 
Emeritus Prof. Ronald Hilton
has been at Stan ford since IV4I.
A professor in the Humanities
Department, Hilton founded
Bolivar House and the Latin
American program. He has been
studying Central America for
half a century and is also in
volved in the World Affairs
Report. The Report, which Hil
ton founded and edits, is
available at 50,000 computer
terminals around the world, in
cluding those at Stanford.
Americans rightly wonder
what will happen in Mexico and
how it will affect the United
States. They see thousands of
Mexicans swarming across the
border fleeing from misery com
pounded by runaway inflation,
while once-beautiful provincial
Mexico City becomes the
world's most monstrous
megalopolis, with its slums
spreading out under a blanket of
fog.
The vacation-minded think of
Acapulco and the islands off
Yucatan. This vision misses the
heartland of Mexico, which
Americans fly over or quickly
drive through. This is clerical,
conservative Mexico, like the
heartland of Spain. Draw a line
from Veracruz through Mexico
City to the Pacific. Mexico City
and the area south of the line is
revolutionary Mexico.
The clash between revolu
tionary Spain and Catholic con
servative Spain was the cause of
the Spanish Civil War. There is
a deep conflict between revolu
tionary Mexico and Catholic
conservative Mexico. Will this
conflict burst into war as it did
in Spain?
The two areas of Mexico
agree on some things for differ
ent reasons. They both despise
the official party, the Partido
Revolucionario Institucional
(PRI). The collapse of the peso
has stripped the PRI of
whatever prestige remained.
The last two presidents, Jose
Lopez Portillo and Luis Ec
heverria, are accused of having
stolen millions while the people
faced ruin. Some even say that if

they showed themselves in
public the> would be murdered.
Echeverria is despised for
neglecting Mexican poverty
while junketing around the
globe posing as the leader ol the
Third World. As president,
Miguel de la Madrid is automat
ically suspected of being cor
rupt.
Revolutionary Mexico uses
left-wing parties like the United
Socialist Party (of which the
core is Communist) to attack
the PRI. Catholic conservative
Mexico attacks the PRI from
the right, through parties such
as the National Action Party?

Both Mexicos view the
United States negatively. They
resent the U.S. role in Central
America, which they view as
Mexico's backyard. Revolution
ary Mexico hates the United
States. The other Mexico, from
which the mass of the migration
to this country comes, envies
it but tries to avoid
Americanization. The attraction
of the colossus of the North
concerns revolutionary Mexico,
where some fear that part of the

North will secede and join the
United States.
One cause of revolution is not
poverty itself, hut the blatant
contrast between luxury and
misery. The contrast is not
marked in Catholic conserva
tive Mexico, but it stinks in
Mexico City and Acapulco.
Misery is exploited by student
leaders throughout Mexico; in
Catholic, conservative Mexico
the universities are radical
enclaves. The best way for stu
dents to achieve power and all
that goes with it is not by a slow
climb up the professional lad
der, which in many cases has

broken under the weight of all
those trying to climb i"t. It is
quicker and more exciting to
start a revolution against a
hated government, as in Cuba
and Nicaragua.
The University of
Guadalajara, long known as a
socialist university, is a revolu
tionary enclave from which
sallies are made into conserva
tive territory. I was in the gover
nor's palace in Guadalajara
when it was invaded by a

banner-toting, slogan-shouting
crowd of peasants led by two
young men who looked like law
students. They marched into the
main hall of the palace and
demanded that the governor
meet with them. One of the stu
dents placed himself at the back
of the crowd, the other at the
front. From time to time, the
one at the back would shout a
slogan. The one at the front
picked up the cue and led the
shouting like the conductor of
an orchestra. The zombie-like,
mechanical shouting by the
crowd was not an encouraging
sight.
The students are generally re
garded as a public nuisance, out
of harmony with the prevailing
dignity of the cities with their
superb colonial monuments.
The churches, beautifully kept
and decorated with tlowers, are
full all day long with people at
tending Mass. Not even Poland
or Ireland is as demonstratively
Catholic. Women and some
men go the long distance from
the porch to the altar on their
knees.
At what is supposed to be the
center of Mexico rises the Cerro
del Cubilete, a peak sur
mounted by a gigantic monu
ment to Christ the King. The
shrine was erected as a quiet af
firmation of the Church's vic
tory. It is not the dead Christ,
his pale body slashed with
ghastly wounds, seen in so many
Mexican churches. It is a Christ
of reconciliation, his out
stretched arms welcoming all
who wish to come to him.
The governing party, tradi
tionally as dogmatically anti
clerical as the governing party of
Poland, realizes that the Pope
may not have many divisions,
but he controls the hearts of
millions of Mexicans, while it
controls at best their purse
strings. The party faces the same
fiilemma as Polish leader Woj
ciech Jaruzelski: Should it go to
Canossa? Should it at least
make up to the Church in the
hope that a little respectability
will rub off onto it?

The Church is not keen on
bailing out the PRI. At the 32nd
plenary assembly of the
Mexican episcopate, held in No
vember 1983. Mexico's primate.
Archbishop Ernesto Corripio
Ahumada. blamed Mexico's so
cial structure for the people's
misery. The assembly did not
exonerate political parties, in
cluding the PRI. but it followed
Pope John Paul II in rejecting
U.S.-style capitalism. Speakers
made digs at U.S. symbols like
Coca-Cola, criticized its •"pre
potence" in the international
sphere and its control of the in
ternational mass media. The at
tention the Mexican press paid

There is a conflict between revolu
tionary Mexico and Catholic, conser
vative Mexico. Will it burst into war
or will part of the North secede and
join the United States as some fear?

to the assembly was testimony
to the influence of the Church.
In contrast with revolutionary
Catholic conservative
Mexico seems orderly and
prosperous. Guadalajara has
built a superb mall through its
center. Leon, now the fourth
city in the republic, has grown
impressively, not depressingly.
Despite complaints about the
desperate economic situation,
there seems to be little
widespread hunger.
The huge new market in
Guadalajara, with its in
numerable little grocery stores
and eateries, displays an in
credible variety of food, includ
ing fish. Hundreds of people are
eating there all day long. On the
sireets, peasant women offer for
sale a few bags of nuts or other

edibles. One wonders how they
stay alive, but they do. The col
lapse of the peso has helped
northern Mexico in some ways:
U.S. companies have set up
plants there to take advantage
of cheap labor.
In " Anti-Semitic Death
Squads" (Feb. l >). Jack Ander
son described Guadalajara as
the headquarters of the World
Anti-Communist League,
whose affiliate, the Latin Amer
ican Anti-Communist Con
federation. he alleged is behind
death squads in Argentina and
other countries. He charged that
the League receives money

from wealthy Arabs who sup
port its anti-Semitic activities.
Anderson's report would seem
to be blown up out of all
proportion, but it adds another
element to the picture of Catho
lic conservative Mexico.
All Mexicans are wondering
what will happen to their
country. There is a chilling par
allel with Spain just before the
Spanish Civil War, or indeed
with El Salvador when the
revolutionary winds began
blowing from Nicaragua. The
prospect is grim. More funda
mental than party, ideological
or religious differences is the
population explosion, which,
combined with the expanding
desert in the countryside, could
blow the country apart. Mexico
City will become the most

populous city id the world, and
even Mexicans admit it will be
one big hell, short ol food anil
water.
The government is taking
steps to block the influx o!
peasants, while it protests
against U.S. attempts to limit
migration to the United States.
In addition to diverting the
wave into the United States, this
will increase the Mexican popu
lation in this country, which the
Mexican government can use
lor political blackmail. Due to
opposition from the Church, the
Mexican government is making
feeble attempts to promote tam-

i1 y planning. The result is
children everywhere.
The United States is faced
with an insoluble problem.
There may be a bigger and
worse replay of the revolution
ary "fire over Mexico" which
spread to the United States
when in March 1916 Pancho
Villa crossed the border and at
tacked Columbus, New Mexico,
killing a number of Americans
and destroying part of the town.
Giving way to pressure from
Mexicans, the Columbus town
council recently approved a
monument celebrating the inva
sion and its "hero". Sometimes
the image of Uncle Sam as
Uncle Sap seems justified.
Whatever policy we adopt
toward Mexico, let's not be
saps.

of the colossus of the North
concerns revolutionary Mexico,
where some fear that part of the

North will secede and join the

One cause of revolution is not
poverty itself, hut the blatant
contrast between luxury and
misery. The contrast is not
marked in Catholic conserva

Misery is exploited by student

Catholic, conservative Mexico

quicker and more exciting to

The University of
Guadalajara, long known as a
socialist university, is a revolu
tionary enclave from which
sallies are made into conserva
tive territory. I was in the gover
nor's palace in Guadalajara
when it was invaded by a

banner-toting, slogan-shouting
crowd of peasants led by two
young men who looked like law
students. They marched into the
main hall of the palace and
demanded that the governor
meet with them. One of the stu
dents placed himself at the back
of the crowd, the other at the
front. From time to time, the
one at the back would shout a
slogan. The one at the front
picked up the cue and led the
shouting like the conductor of
an orchestra. The zombie-like,
mechanical shouting by the
crowd was not an encouraging
sight.
The students are generally re
garded as a public nuisance, out
of harmony with the prevailing
dignity of the cities with their
superb colonial monuments.
The churches, beautifully kept
and decorated with tlowers, are
full all day long with people at
tending Mass. Not even Poland
or Ireland is as demonstratively
Catholic. Women and some
men go the long distance from
the porch to the altar on their
knees.
At what is supposed to be the
center of Mexico rises the Cerro
del Cubilete, a peak sur
mounted by a gigantic monu
ment to Christ the King. The
shrine was erected as a quiet af
firmation of the Church's vic
tory. It is not the dead Christ,
his pale body slashed with
ghastly wounds, seen in so many
Mexican churches. It is a Christ
of reconciliation, his out
stretched arms welcoming all
who wish to come to him.
The governing party, tradi
tionally as dogmatically anti
clerical as the governing party of
Poland, realizes that the Pope
may not have many divisions,
but he controls the hearts of
millions of Mexicans, while it
controls at best their purse
strings. The party faces the same
fiilemma as Polish leader Woj
ciech Jaruzelski: Should it go to
Canossa? Should it at least
make up to the Church in the
hope that a little respectability
will rub off onto it?

The Church is not keen on
bailing out the PRI. At the 32nd
plenary assembly of the
Mexican episcopate, held in No

Archbishop Ernesto Corripio
Ahumada. blamed Mexico's so
cial structure for the people's
misery. The assembly did not
exonerate political parties, in
cluding the PRI. but it followed
Pope John Paul II in rejecting
U.S.-style capitalism. Speakers
made digs at U.S. symbols like
Coca-Cola, criticized its •"pre

to the assembly was testimony
to the influence of the Church.
In contrast with revolutionary
Catholic conservative
Mexico seems orderly and
prosperous. Guadalajara has
built a superb mall through its
center. Leon, now the fourth
city in the republic, has grown
impressively, not depressingly.
Despite complaints about the
desperate economic situation,
there seems to be little
widespread hunger.
The huge new market in
Guadalajara, with its in
numerable little grocery stores
and eateries, displays an in
credible variety of food, includ
ing fish. Hundreds of people are
eating there all day long. On the
sireets, peasant women offer for
sale a few bags of nuts or other

edibles. One wonders how they
stay alive, but they do. The col
lapse of the peso has helped
northern Mexico in some ways:
U.S. companies have set up
plants there to take advantage
of cheap labor.
In " Anti-Semitic Death
Squads" (Feb. l >). Jack Ander
son described Guadalajara as
the headquarters of the World
Anti-Communist League,
whose affiliate, the Latin Amer
ican Anti-Communist Con
federation. he alleged is behind
death squads in Argentina and
other countries. He charged that
the League receives money

from wealthy Arabs who sup
port its anti-Semitic activities.
Anderson's report would seem
to be blown up out of all
proportion, but it adds another
element to the picture of Catho
lic conservative Mexico.
All Mexicans are wondering
what will happen to their
country. There is a chilling par
allel with Spain just before the
Spanish Civil War, or indeed
with El Salvador when the
revolutionary winds began
blowing from Nicaragua. The
prospect is grim. More funda
mental than party, ideological
or religious differences is the
population explosion, which,
combined with the expanding
desert in the countryside, could
blow the country apart. Mexico
City will become the most

populous city id the world, and
even Mexicans admit it will be
one big hell, short ol food anil
water.
The government is taking
steps to block the influx o!
peasants, while it protests
against U.S. attempts to limit
migration to the United States.
In addition to diverting the
wave into the United States, this
will increase the Mexican popu
lation in this country, which the
Mexican government can use
lor political blackmail. Due to
opposition from the Church, the
Mexican government is making
feeble attempts to promote tam-

i1 y planning. The result is
children everywhere.
The United States is faced
with an insoluble problem.
There may be a bigger and
worse replay of the revolution
ary "fire over Mexico" which
spread to the United States
when in March 1916 Pancho
Villa crossed the border and at
tacked Columbus, New Mexico,
killing a number of Americans
and destroying part of the town.
Giving way to pressure from
Mexicans, the Columbus town
council recently approved a
monument celebrating the inva
sion and its "hero". Sometimes
the image of Uncle Sam as
Uncle Sap seems justified.

Ronald Hilton
Emeritus Prof. Ronald Hilton
has been at Stan ford since IV4I.
A professor in the Humanities
Department, Hilton founded
Bolivar House and the Latin
American program. He has been
studying Central America for
half a century and is also in
volved in the World Affairs
Report. The Report, which Hil
ton founded and edits, is
available at 50,000 computer
terminals around the world, in
cluding those at Stanford.
Americans rightly wonder
what will happen in Mexico and
how it will affect the United
States. They see thousands of
Mexicans swarming across the
border fleeing from misery com
pounded by runaway inflation,
while once-beautiful provincial
Mexico City becomes the
world's most monstrous
megalopolis, with its slums
spreading out under a blanket of
fog.
The vacation-minded think of
Acapulco and the islands off
Yucatan. This vision misses the
heartland of Mexico, which
Americans fly over or quickly
drive through. This is clerical,
conservative Mexico, like the
heartland of Spain. Draw a line
from Veracruz through Mexico
City to the Pacific. Mexico City
and the area south of the line is
revolutionary Mexico.
The clash between revolu
tionary Spain and Catholic con
servative Spain was the cause of
the Spanish Civil War. There is
a deep conflict between revolu
tionary Mexico and Catholic
conservative Mexico. Will this
conflict burst into war as it did
in Spain?
The two areas of Mexico
agree on some things for differ
ent reasons. They both despise
the official party, the Partido
Revolucionario Institucional
(PRI). The collapse of the peso
has stripped the PRI of
whatever prestige remained.
The last two presidents, Jose
Lopez Portillo and Luis Ec
heverria, are accused of having
stolen millions while the people
faced ruin. Some even say that if

they showed themselves in
public the> would be murdered.
Echeverria is despised for
neglecting Mexican poverty
while junketing around the
globe posing as the leader ol the
Third World. As president,
Miguel de la Madrid is automat
ically suspected of being cor
rupt.
Revolutionary Mexico uses
left-wing parties like the United
Socialist Party (of which the
core is Communist) to attack
the PRI. Catholic conservative
Mexico attacks the PRI from
the right, through parties such
as the National Action Party?

Both Mexicos view the
United States negatively. They
resent the U.S. role in Central
America, which they view as
Mexico's backyard. Revolution

tionally as dogmatically anti
clerical as the governing party of
Poland, realizes that the Pope
may not have many divisions,
but he controls the hearts of
millions of Mexicans, while it
controls at best their purse
strings. The party faces the same
fiilemma as Polish leader Woj
ciech Jaruzelski: Should it go to
Canossa? Should it at least
make up to the Church in the
hope that a little respectability
will rub off onto it?

The Church is not keen on
bailing out the PRI. At the 32nd
plenary assembly of the
Mexican episcopate, held in No
vember 1983. Mexico's primate.
Archbishop Ernesto Corripio
Ahumada. blamed Mexico's so
cial structure for the people's
misery. The assembly did not
exonerate political parties, in
cluding the PRI. but it followed
Pope John Paul II in rejecting
U.S.-style capitalism. Speakers
made digs at U.S. symbols like
Coca-Cola, criticized its •"pre
potence" in the international
sphere and its control of the in
ternational mass media. The at
tention the Mexican press paid

There is a conflict between revolu
tionary Mexico and Catholic, conser
vative Mexico. Will it burst into war
or will part of the North secede and
join the United States as some fear?

to the assembly was testimony
to the influence of the Church.
In contrast with revolutionary
Catholic conservative
Mexico seems orderly and
prosperous. Guadalajara has
built a superb mall through its
center. Leon, now the fourth
city in the republic, has grown
impressively, not depressingly.
Despite complaints about the
desperate economic situation,
there seems to be little
widespread hunger.
The huge new market in
Guadalajara, with its in
numerable little grocery stores
and eateries, displays an in
credible variety of food, includ
ing fish. Hundreds of people are
eating there all day long. On the
sireets, peasant women offer for
sale a few bags of nuts or other

edibles. One wonders how they
stay alive, but they do. The col
lapse of the peso has helped
northern Mexico in some ways:
U.S. companies have set up
plants there to take advantage
of cheap labor.
In " Anti-Semitic Death
Squads" (Feb. l >). Jack Ander
son described Guadalajara as
the headquarters of the World
Anti-Communist League,
whose affiliate, the Latin Amer
ican Anti-Communist Con
federation. he alleged is behind
death squads in Argentina and
other countries. He charged that
the League receives money

from wealthy Arabs who sup
port its anti-Semitic activities.
Anderson's report would seem
to be blown up out of all
proportion, but it adds another
element to the picture of Catho
lic conservative Mexico.
All Mexicans are wondering
what will happen to their
country. There is a chilling par
allel with Spain just before the
Spanish Civil War, or indeed
with El Salvador when the
revolutionary winds began
blowing from Nicaragua. The
prospect is grim. More funda
mental than party, ideological
or religious differences is the
population explosion, which,
combined with the expanding
desert in the countryside, could
blow the country apart. Mexico
City will become the most

populous city id the world, and
even Mexicans admit it will be
one big hell, short ol food anil
water.
The government is taking
steps to block the influx o!
peasants, while it protests
against U.S. attempts to limit
migration to the United States.
In addition to diverting the
wave into the United States, this
will increase the Mexican popu
lation in this country, which the
Mexican government can use
lor political blackmail. Due to
opposition from the Church, the
Mexican government is making
feeble attempts to promote tam-

i1 y planning. The result is
children everywhere.
The United States is faced
with an insoluble problem.
There may be a bigger and
worse replay of the revolution
ary "fire over Mexico" which
spread to the United States
when in March 1916 Pancho
Villa crossed the border and at
tacked Columbus, New Mexico,
killing a number of Americans
and destroying part of the town.
Giving way to pressure from
Mexicans, the Columbus town
council recently approved a
monument celebrating the inva
sion and its "hero". Sometimes
the image of Uncle Sam as
Uncle Sap seems justified.
Whatever policy we adopt
toward Mexico, let's not be
saps.
