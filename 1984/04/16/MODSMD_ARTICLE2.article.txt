# Hart goes after yuppie vote
## News 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
The Lion and Compass in Sunnyvale is the kind of
restaurant yuppies like. Yuppies are Young Urban
Professionals, and the Lion and Compass, with its con
stant video display of New York Stock Exchange trades
flashing above the bar, is perfect for thern.
Yuppies are the kind of people Gary Hart likes. His
campaign staffers say Hart hopes to attract the support
of Silicon Valley types to ensure a win in the June 5
California primary.
So it's no surprise to anyone that Gary Hart has cho
sen the Lion and Compass for a $500-a-plate breakfast
with 70 Silicon Valley professionals.
Hart tells the yuppies that he's trying to shake his
party's "anti-marketplace" and "anti-private sector"'
image, and they like what they hear.
The press, huddled around the coffee and the carrot
cake, doesn't like what it hears. Hart won't be making a
public statement at the Lion and Compass, he won't be
leaving Sunnyvale for an hour and his $>00-a-plate

brunch in San Francisco will be off-limits for the
reporters.
They grumble, but after another cup of coffee they
begin to move outside, where 25 Hart supporters hold
conspicuously similar homemade campaign signs.
"GARY. GARY" they begin to chant.
Just before Hart emerges, the chant dies. In its place,
a man yells, "Go for it, Gary."
Hart waves to his supporters before deciding to put
his western boots to use and wade through the ivy to
shake some hands. The crowd is ecstatic. Hart looks
mildly pleased.
As soon as the candidate ducks into his blue sedan,
the camera crews bolt for the station wagons.
The motorcade
Campaign motorcades are not for the weak of heart.
Within 30 seconds, the whole operation — six sedans,
two station wagons and four Highway Patrol cruisers —
is rolling toward Highway 101.
