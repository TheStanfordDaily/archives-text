# Hart goes after yuppie vote
## News 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
The Lion and Compass in Sunnyvale is the kind of
restaurant yuppies like. Yuppies are Young Urban
Professionals, and the Lion and Compass, with its con
stant video display of New York Stock Exchange trades
flashing above the bar, is perfect for thern.
Yuppies are the kind of people Gary Hart likes. His
campaign staffers say Hart hopes to attract the support
of Silicon Valley types to ensure a win in the June 5
California primary.
So it's no surprise to anyone that Gary Hart has cho
sen the Lion and Compass for a $500-a-plate breakfast
with 70 Silicon Valley professionals.
Hart tells the yuppies that he's trying to shake his
party's "anti-marketplace" and "anti-private sector"'
image, and they like what they hear.
The press, huddled around the coffee and the carrot
cake, doesn't like what it hears. Hart won't be making a
public statement at the Lion and Compass, he won't be
leaving Sunnyvale for an hour and his $>00-a-plate

brunch in San Francisco will be off-limits for the
reporters.
They grumble, but after another cup of coffee they
begin to move outside, where 25 Hart supporters hold
conspicuously similar homemade campaign signs.
"GARY. GARY" they begin to chant.
Just before Hart emerges, the chant dies. In its place,
a man yells, "Go for it, Gary."
Hart waves to his supporters before deciding to put
his western boots to use and wade through the ivy to
shake some hands. The crowd is ecstatic. Hart looks
mildly pleased.
As soon as the candidate ducks into his blue sedan,
the camera crews bolt for the station wagons.
The motorcade
Campaign motorcades are not for the weak of heart.
Within 30 seconds, the whole operation — six sedans,
two station wagons and four Highway Patrol cruisers —
is rolling toward Highway 101.

Sen. Gary Hart speaks at the opening of his East Bay campaign headquarters in Berkeley Saturday.
I he network cameramen stand on
the tailgates of the station wagons with
one hand on the camera and one hand
on the luggage rack.
A Time writer later asks another
reporter why the cameramen don't
just sit down.
"Its because of the accidents," the
reporter says. "So many people get
killed in these motorcades and the TV
people want to be ready. Nixon killed
four, Ford killed one, Carter killed a
couple and Reagan's already killed a
few."
Once on the freeway, the
cameramen relax. But as soon as the
motorcade hits San Francisco, they're
on the tailgates again.
Up and down the hills at 60 miles
per hour, the cameramen hold on to
the luggage racks for dear life as a
dozen motorcycle cops join the
motorcade, leapfrogging intersections
to block traffic for the procession
which never stops until it reaches its
destination.
San Francisco
I he small group waiting outside the
hour Seasons-Gift Hotel when the
motorcade pulls in isn't the same sort
of campaign-stop crowd that had
chanted "GARY, GARY" 40
minutes earlier in Sunnyvale.
There are no middle-aged couples
with "I love Hart" posters at the cor
ner of Geary and Taylor. Instead,
teen-aged girls hold Duran Duran
souvenir programs from Friday night's
concert in Oakland.
It's one of those things that isn't
supposed to happen. The pop group
Duran Duran has spent the night at
the Four Seasons-Clift Hotel, and two
dozen teenyboppers are waiting
outside to see their idols when Hart
arrives.
Minutes after Hart begins talking
business at the $500-a-plate brunch
upstairs, Duran Duran leaves the
hotel. The girls scream the names of
their heroes as the band comes
through the doors of the hotel,
pass through Hart's motorcade and
disappear behind the smoked-glass
windows of white limosines.
After the band has pulled out of
sight, a reporter asks the girls which
musician is cutest. "Simon," one
screams. "Roger," shouts another.
"John," screeches a third. Finally,
they agree that the entire band is per
fect and one of the girls slumps against
the hotel, half-sighing and half-crying,
"I didn't touch Roger, but I touched
Simon and John and Andy."
The Secret Service and the CHP
and the network soundmen love it.
"No way num." one highway patrol
men jokes, a toothpick hanging from
his mouth, "I'll never live the life of
fame."
But when a leggy brunette steps
into a Duran Duran limo, a Secret
Service man admits, "There are some
advantages to fame."
The network soundmen, in between

phallic jokes with their microphone
booms as props, imitate the girls
whenever a female campaign staffer
passes through the crowd. "Ooh, it's
Donna. Ooh, ooh."
But alter the imitations get old, the
soundmen begin to moan in unison:
"How long?" They have been waiting
tor Hart on the sidewalk for almost an
hour, and the Hart people will only
tell them "pretty soon."
112 inally, the local TV camera crews
— the network soundmen call them
"cockroaches" — position themselves,
hotel security crews begin to look ner
vous again, the doors fly open and
Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood
walks out, a tall blonde hanging on his
shoulder.
The excitement cools then heats
again as a new crowd gathers, at
tracted by the commotion without
knowing its cause.
The network men raise their
microphone booms — "I'm fishin'
now," one says — and Hart emerges
from the hotel lobby, waves twice and
climbs into the back seat of a blue
sedan.
The camera crews and the reporters
and the campaign staffers race for
their cars while the CHPs pull into po
sition.
Berkeley
After another hair-raising ride
through the City and across the Bay
F3ridge, the motorcade turns into
Berkeley, where a new set of police
takes turns blocking intersections. Fi
nally, the TV crews and the campaign
staff pull away, circling around the
back of a building, while the press bus
pulls around front, where 1000 Hart
suppporters are waiting to welcome
their candidate to his new East Bay
campaign headquarters.
The crowd is pushed aside to make
way for the press. There's resentment

from both sides. The Hart supporters
are angry beause they've been waiting
all morning to see their candidate and
now they're being pushed out of the
way by the press. The reporters are
mad because they have to deal with
people like the "Mutant Bunny," a fat
man in a rabbit suit backing "Nobody
for President."
It's hot on the asphalt, and the
excitement of the crowd does little for
the tired press. Once again, the übiq
uitous "GARY, GARY" starts and
ends minutes before Hart appears.
A campaign staffer climbs on the
stage, offers a few "We must defeat
Ronald Reagans" and then introduces
another Hart supporter, a popular
Berkeley assemblyman. "Oh, shit," a
Chronicle reporter moans. Berkeley is
the last event before the reporters can
go home for a day off and now they
have to stand in the sun to hear an
other politician.
"This man cannot speak," one
reporter tells another. And the
reporter is right. The assemblyman
paces nervously, flails his arms and
seldom talks into the microphone. But
he says the right things, and the crowd
loves him.
The crowd goes wild when its
man takes the stage. He takes off his
coat, roll up his sleeves and loosens his
tie. A reporter asks, "Where's the
beef?"
But after undressing, Hart doesn't
seem to know what to do with his
hands. He points at campaign signs
and then gives an awkward thumbs
up, not unlike a middle-aged version
of Fonzie from "Happy Days."

But the crowd doesn't care. They
interrupt his speech dozens of times,
clapping and screaming. It's that kind
of speech — a string of catch phrases
and attacks on Reagan's domestic and
foreign policies.
• "I want to send Ronald Reagan
back to his ranch."
• "This election is about nothing less
than the future of this country. I
believe we cannot afford four more
years of Reaganomics for the rich."
• "This country in 1985 is going to
have a government totally and un
equivocally committed to civil rights in
our time."
• "We as Americans and as human
beings cannot afford four more years
of a dangerous and costly and un
necessary arms race."
The reporters have heard it all
before. An NBC camera crew mouths
entire portions of the speech, word for
word, right along with the candidate.
The speech ends and the reporters
race for the prels bus to the Oakland
Airport.
A handful of reporters is left
stranded in Berkeley; someone told
them the press bus would take them
back to their cars in San Francisco.
Now it won't, so they go looking for
the BART station, walking through a
flea market where a black family sells
used sneakers and a chicit no boy
hawks a five-week old pit bull. "Leave
your house and know it will be there
when you come back," the boy says.
"I've been covering this for three
weeks," an Oakland Tribune reporter
says as he walks through the dust of
the flea market. "Now I'm going
home."

cameramen relax. But as soon as the
motorcade hits San Francisco, they're
on the tailgates again.
Up and down the hills at 60 miles
per hour, the cameramen hold on to
the luggage racks for dear life as a
dozen motorcycle cops join the
motorcade, leapfrogging intersections
to block traffic for the procession
which never stops until it reaches its
destination.
San Francisco
I he small group waiting outside the
hour Seasons-Gift Hotel when the
motorcade pulls in isn't the same sort
of campaign-stop crowd that had
chanted "GARY, GARY" 40
minutes earlier in Sunnyvale.
There are no middle-aged couples
with "I love Hart" posters at the cor
ner of Geary and Taylor. Instead,
teen-aged girls hold Duran Duran
souvenir programs from Friday night's
concert in Oakland.
It's one of those things that isn't
supposed to happen. The pop group
Duran Duran has spent the night at
the Four Seasons-Clift Hotel, and two
dozen teenyboppers are waiting
outside to see their idols when Hart
arrives.
Minutes after Hart begins talking
business at the $500-a-plate brunch
upstairs, Duran Duran leaves the
hotel. The girls scream the names of
their heroes as the band comes
through the doors of the hotel,
pass through Hart's motorcade and
disappear behind the smoked-glass
windows of white limosines.
After the band has pulled out of
sight, a reporter asks the girls which
musician is cutest. "Simon," one
screams. "Roger," shouts another.
"John," screeches a third. Finally,
they agree that the entire band is per
fect and one of the girls slumps against
the hotel, half-sighing and half-crying,
"I didn't touch Roger, but I touched
Simon and John and Andy."
The Secret Service and the CHP
and the network soundmen love it.
"No way num." one highway patrol
men jokes, a toothpick hanging from
his mouth, "I'll never live the life of
fame."
But when a leggy brunette steps
into a Duran Duran limo, a Secret
Service man admits, "There are some
advantages to fame."
The network soundmen, in between

phallic jokes with their microphone
booms as props, imitate the girls
whenever a female campaign staffer
passes through the crowd. "Ooh, it's
Donna. Ooh, ooh."
But alter the imitations get old, the
soundmen begin to moan in unison:
"How long?" They have been waiting
tor Hart on the sidewalk for almost an
hour, and the Hart people will only
tell them "pretty soon."
112 inally, the local TV camera crews
— the network soundmen call them
"cockroaches" — position themselves,
hotel security crews begin to look ner
vous again, the doors fly open and
Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood
walks out, a tall blonde hanging on his
shoulder.
The excitement cools then heats
again as a new crowd gathers, at
tracted by the commotion without
knowing its cause.
The network men raise their
microphone booms — "I'm fishin'
now," one says — and Hart emerges
from the hotel lobby, waves twice and
climbs into the back seat of a blue
sedan.
The camera crews and the reporters
and the campaign staffers race for
their cars while the CHPs pull into po
sition.
Berkeley
After another hair-raising ride
through the City and across the Bay
F3ridge, the motorcade turns into
Berkeley, where a new set of police
takes turns blocking intersections. Fi
nally, the TV crews and the campaign
staff pull away, circling around the
back of a building, while the press bus
pulls around front, where 1000 Hart
suppporters are waiting to welcome
their candidate to his new East Bay
campaign headquarters.
The crowd is pushed aside to make
way for the press. There's resentment

from both sides. The Hart supporters
are angry beause they've been waiting
all morning to see their candidate and
now they're being pushed out of the
way by the press. The reporters are
mad because they have to deal with
people like the "Mutant Bunny," a fat
man in a rabbit suit backing "Nobody
for President."
It's hot on the asphalt, and the
excitement of the crowd does little for
the tired press. Once again, the übiq
uitous "GARY, GARY" starts and
ends minutes before Hart appears.
A campaign staffer climbs on the
stage, offers a few "We must defeat
Ronald Reagans" and then introduces
another Hart supporter, a popular
Berkeley assemblyman. "Oh, shit," a
Chronicle reporter moans. Berkeley is
the last event before the reporters can
go home for a day off and now they
have to stand in the sun to hear an
other politician.
"This man cannot speak," one
reporter tells another. And the
reporter is right. The assemblyman
paces nervously, flails his arms and
seldom talks into the microphone. But
he says the right things, and the crowd
loves him.
The crowd goes wild when its
man takes the stage. He takes off his
coat, roll up his sleeves and loosens his
tie. A reporter asks, "Where's the
beef?"
But after undressing, Hart doesn't
seem to know what to do with his
hands. He points at campaign signs
and then gives an awkward thumbs
up, not unlike a middle-aged version
of Fonzie from "Happy Days."

But the crowd doesn't care. They
interrupt his speech dozens of times,
clapping and screaming. It's that kind
of speech — a string of catch phrases
and attacks on Reagan's domestic and
foreign policies.
• "I want to send Ronald Reagan
back to his ranch."
• "This election is about nothing less
than the future of this country. I
believe we cannot afford four more
years of Reaganomics for the rich."
• "This country in 1985 is going to
have a government totally and un
equivocally committed to civil rights in
our time."
• "We as Americans and as human
beings cannot afford four more years
of a dangerous and costly and un
necessary arms race."
The reporters have heard it all
before. An NBC camera crew mouths
entire portions of the speech, word for
word, right along with the candidate.
The speech ends and the reporters
race for the prels bus to the Oakland
Airport.
A handful of reporters is left
stranded in Berkeley; someone told
them the press bus would take them
back to their cars in San Francisco.
Now it won't, so they go looking for
the BART station, walking through a
flea market where a black family sells
used sneakers and a chicit no boy
hawks a five-week old pit bull. "Leave
your house and know it will be there
when you come back," the boy says.
"I've been covering this for three
weeks," an Oakland Tribune reporter
says as he walks through the dust of
the flea market. "Now I'm going
home."


The Mutant Bunny


A bit young even for Gary Hart, teenyboppers scream for Duran Duran
outside San Francisco's Four Seasons-Clift Hotel, while the senator


Rod Searcey/Daily
speaks at a fund-raiser inside. Meanwhile, singer Simon Le Bon carries
out a futile attempt at calming his fans.
The Lion and Compass in Sunnyvale is the kind of
restaurant yuppies like. Yuppies are Young Urban
Professionals, and the Lion and Compass, with its con
stant video display of New York Stock Exchange trades
flashing above the bar, is perfect for thern.
Yuppies are the kind of people Gary Hart likes. His
campaign staffers say Hart hopes to attract the support
of Silicon Valley types to ensure a win in the June 5
California primary.
So it's no surprise to anyone that Gary Hart has cho
sen the Lion and Compass for a $500-a-plate breakfast
with 70 Silicon Valley professionals.
Hart tells the yuppies that he's trying to shake his
party's "anti-marketplace" and "anti-private sector"'
image, and they like what they hear.
The press, huddled around the coffee and the carrot
cake, doesn't like what it hears. Hart won't be making a
public statement at the Lion and Compass, he won't be
leaving Sunnyvale for an hour and his $>00-a-plate

brunch in San Francisco will be off-limits for the
reporters.
They grumble, but after another cup of coffee they
begin to move outside, where 25 Hart supporters hold
conspicuously similar homemade campaign signs.
"GARY. GARY" they begin to chant.
Just before Hart emerges, the chant dies. In its place,
a man yells, "Go for it, Gary."
Hart waves to his supporters before deciding to put
his western boots to use and wade through the ivy to
shake some hands. The crowd is ecstatic. Hart looks
mildly pleased.
As soon as the candidate ducks into his blue sedan,
the camera crews bolt for the station wagons.
The motorcade
Campaign motorcades are not for the weak of heart.
Within 30 seconds, the whole operation — six sedans,
two station wagons and four Highway Patrol cruisers —
is rolling toward Highway 101.


Rod Searcey/Daily
Sen. Gary Hart speaks at the opening of his East Bay campaign headquarters in Berkeley Saturday.
I he network cameramen stand on
the tailgates of the station wagons with
one hand on the camera and one hand
on the luggage rack.
A Time writer later asks another
reporter why the cameramen don't
just sit down.
"Its because of the accidents," the
reporter says. "So many people get
killed in these motorcades and the TV
people want to be ready. Nixon killed
four, Ford killed one, Carter killed a
couple and Reagan's already killed a
few."
Once on the freeway, the
cameramen relax. But as soon as the

on the tailgates again.

"How long?" They have been waiting
tor Hart on the sidewalk for almost an
hour, and the Hart people will only
tell them "pretty soon."
112 inally, the local TV camera crews
— the network soundmen call them
"cockroaches" — position themselves,
hotel security crews begin to look ner
vous again, the doors fly open and
Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood
walks out, a tall blonde hanging on his
shoulder.
The excitement cools then heats
again as a new crowd gathers, at
tracted by the commotion without
knowing its cause.
The network men raise their
microphone booms — "I'm fishin'
now," one says — and Hart emerges
from the hotel lobby, waves twice and
climbs into the back seat of a blue
sedan.
The camera crews and the reporters
and the campaign staffers race for
their cars while the CHPs pull into po
sition.
Berkeley
After another hair-raising ride
through the City and across the Bay
F3ridge, the motorcade turns into
Berkeley, where a new set of police
takes turns blocking intersections. Fi
nally, the TV crews and the campaign
staff pull away, circling around the
back of a building, while the press bus
pulls around front, where 1000 Hart
suppporters are waiting to welcome
their candidate to his new East Bay
campaign headquarters.
The crowd is pushed aside to make
way for the press. There's resentment

from both sides. The Hart supporters
are angry beause they've been waiting
all morning to see their candidate and
now they're being pushed out of the
way by the press. The reporters are
mad because they have to deal with
people like the "Mutant Bunny," a fat
man in a rabbit suit backing "Nobody
for President."
It's hot on the asphalt, and the
excitement of the crowd does little for
the tired press. Once again, the übiq
uitous "GARY, GARY" starts and
ends minutes before Hart appears.
A campaign staffer climbs on the
stage, offers a few "We must defeat
Ronald Reagans" and then introduces
another Hart supporter, a popular
Berkeley assemblyman. "Oh, shit," a
Chronicle reporter moans. Berkeley is
the last event before the reporters can
go home for a day off and now they
have to stand in the sun to hear an
other politician.
"This man cannot speak," one
reporter tells another. And the
reporter is right. The assemblyman
paces nervously, flails his arms and
seldom talks into the microphone. But
he says the right things, and the crowd
loves him.
The crowd goes wild when its
man takes the stage. He takes off his
coat, roll up his sleeves and loosens his
tie. A reporter asks, "Where's the
beef?"
But after undressing, Hart doesn't
seem to know what to do with his
hands. He points at campaign signs
and then gives an awkward thumbs
up, not unlike a middle-aged version
of Fonzie from "Happy Days."

But the crowd doesn't care. They
interrupt his speech dozens of times,
clapping and screaming. It's that kind
of speech — a string of catch phrases
and attacks on Reagan's domestic and
foreign policies.
• "I want to send Ronald Reagan
back to his ranch."
• "This election is about nothing less
than the future of this country. I
believe we cannot afford four more
years of Reaganomics for the rich."
• "This country in 1985 is going to
have a government totally and un
equivocally committed to civil rights in
our time."
• "We as Americans and as human
beings cannot afford four more years
of a dangerous and costly and un
necessary arms race."
The reporters have heard it all
before. An NBC camera crew mouths
entire portions of the speech, word for
word, right along with the candidate.
The speech ends and the reporters
race for the prels bus to the Oakland
Airport.
A handful of reporters is left
stranded in Berkeley; someone told
them the press bus would take them
back to their cars in San Francisco.
Now it won't, so they go looking for
the BART station, walking through a
flea market where a black family sells
used sneakers and a chicit no boy
hawks a five-week old pit bull. "Leave
your house and know it will be there
when you come back," the boy says.
"I've been covering this for three
weeks," an Oakland Tribune reporter
says as he walks through the dust of
the flea market. "Now I'm going
home."


The Mutant Bunny


A bit young even for Gary Hart, teenyboppers scream for Duran Duran
outside San Francisco's Four Seasons-Clift Hotel, while the senator


Rod Searcey/Daily
speaks at a fund-raiser inside. Meanwhile, singer Simon Le Bon carries
out a futile attempt at calming his fans.
