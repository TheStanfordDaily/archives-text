## Card diamondmen scratch Cats to sweep series 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Pitching and detense — lots
of it.
The Stanford baseball team
used that combination to keep
its postseason playoff hopes
alive with a three-game sweep
of the University of Arizona
that chased the Wildcats back to
Tucson, their offense gasping
for air.
All three of Stanford's start
ing pitchers hurled a full nine in
nings. one even flirting with des
tiny. as the Card played some of
its best baseball of the season to
give Head Coach Mark
Marquess wins No. 300. 301
and 302. and boosted its record
to 27-IS-1 in the process.
The Cardinal, now 10-8 and
four-and-one-half games out of
first in the Pacific-10 Southern
Division race, dropped Arizona
to 17-29 and 6-12 in the league.
The odds on Stanford reaching
the NCAA regional are still
high and the key to getting there
is still simple.
"We have to show that we're
playing well at the end of the
year and then hope for the
best," Marquess explained yes
terday.
Beginning on Friday, the
Card set out to establish that it
was indeed playing well.
Marquess became only the
second Stanford manager to
reach the 300-win plateau as
Stanford exploded for its biggest
inning of the year to back the
six-hit pitching of junior south
paw Jeff Ballard in a 1 2-5 romp.

Only Ray Young. Marquess
predecessor, tallied more wins.
Young notched 323 victories
during his nine-year stint (I 965-76)
76) on the Farm.
"I hope we get to the next
300 a little quicker." was the
Stanford mentor's response to
the fuss. "We II take em one at
a time."
The Cardinal sent 14 hitters
to the plate in a nine-run sixth
inning that chased Arizona s top
starter Joe Magrane (6-6) and
gave Stanford an insur
mountable 12-1 lead. Mike
Dcßcnon. who went 4 tor 5
with five RBl's on the after
noon. collected a single, a
double and three RBIs in the
uprising. Ballard raised his
record to 5-4 with the complete
game \ictorv.
Unlike Magrane. Arizona's
second-game starter. Kevin
Blankcnship, reduced the
Cards' batting averages rather
than padding them by surren
dering but one hit through eight
innings.
That hit was a powerful drive
off the bat of Darryl Stephens
that kissed the scoreboard in
leftfield for a solo home run that
gave Stanford a 1-0 lead. It was
also the only hit in the ballgame
through the top of the eighth.
That's right: Stanford's John
Radtke was pitching a dream
game, a no-hitter. Through
seven innings he pitched to just
