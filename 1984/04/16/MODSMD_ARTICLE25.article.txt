## Card diamondmen scratch Cats to sweep series 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Pitching and detense — lots
of it.
The Stanford baseball team
used that combination to keep
its postseason playoff hopes
alive with a three-game sweep
of the University of Arizona
that chased the Wildcats back to
Tucson, their offense gasping
for air.
All three of Stanford's start
ing pitchers hurled a full nine in
nings. one even flirting with des
tiny. as the Card played some of
its best baseball of the season to
give Head Coach Mark
Marquess wins No. 300. 301
and 302. and boosted its record
to 27-IS-1 in the process.
The Cardinal, now 10-8 and
four-and-one-half games out of
first in the Pacific-10 Southern
Division race, dropped Arizona
to 17-29 and 6-12 in the league.
The odds on Stanford reaching
the NCAA regional are still
high and the key to getting there
is still simple.
"We have to show that we're
playing well at the end of the
year and then hope for the
best," Marquess explained yes
terday.
Beginning on Friday, the
Card set out to establish that it
was indeed playing well.
Marquess became only the
second Stanford manager to
reach the 300-win plateau as
Stanford exploded for its biggest
inning of the year to back the
six-hit pitching of junior south
paw Jeff Ballard in a 1 2-5 romp.

Only Ray Young. Marquess
predecessor, tallied more wins.
Young notched 323 victories
during his nine-year stint (I 965-76)
76) on the Farm.
"I hope we get to the next
300 a little quicker." was the
Stanford mentor's response to
the fuss. "We II take em one at
a time."
The Cardinal sent 14 hitters
to the plate in a nine-run sixth
inning that chased Arizona s top
starter Joe Magrane (6-6) and
gave Stanford an insur
mountable 12-1 lead. Mike
Dcßcnon. who went 4 tor 5
with five RBl's on the after
noon. collected a single, a
double and three RBIs in the
uprising. Ballard raised his
record to 5-4 with the complete
game \ictorv.
Unlike Magrane. Arizona's
second-game starter. Kevin
Blankcnship, reduced the
Cards' batting averages rather
than padding them by surren
dering but one hit through eight
innings.
That hit was a powerful drive
off the bat of Darryl Stephens
that kissed the scoreboard in
leftfield for a solo home run that
gave Stanford a 1-0 lead. It was
also the only hit in the ballgame
through the top of the eighth.
That's right: Stanford's John
Radtke was pitching a dream
game, a no-hitter. Through
seven innings he pitched to just

second base. The Wildcats did not jump up when the three-game series was

dinal, 12-5 Friday, 4-3 Saturday and 4-1 yesterday.
22 batters, one over the minimum. Radtke was six
outs from destiny — and a few outs from disaster.
With two gone in the eighth, Garr Millay
stroked a grounder past a diving Ken Green at
third to ruin the senior right hander's bid for
glory.
Radtke was obviously disappointed afterwards:
"I can't tell you how much I wanted the no-hitter.
I thought I had a great chance to get it.(The
pitch) was a slider that was up on his hands."
The worst was yet to come. Leading off the
ninth, pinch-hitter Joe O'Donnell got Arizona's
second hit on a Baltimore chop. A few batters
later, Dave Cooper rapped a single to right field
that put the Wildcats and Blankenship ahead 2-1
and sent Radtke and his teammates to the dugout
shaking their heads.
"1 had a no-hitter in the eighth and I'm close to
getting a loss," said Radtke. "It's one of those
things where life isn't fair."
Stanford refused to go down, parlaying an in
field hit and Rick Lundblade's two-out check
swing double down the right field line into the
tying run.
Millay promptly ruined everything in the tenth
when he sent another slider from Radtke out of
the ballpark to put Arizona up 3-2. But after
Doug Gwaltney relieved Radtke to retire the side,
Blankenship also learned that life is not fair.
Two singles in the Stanford tenth sent Blanken
ship to the bench in favor of reliever Chip Dill.
Dill got two men out, but balked the runners to
second and third. Up stepped freshman Toi Cook,
with all of 24 at-bats under his belt this year. He
gave the Card a 4-3 win when he slapped a l-l
pitch up the middle that second baseman Hale
knocked down with a desparation dive.
John Verducci scored the tying run and pinch
runner Fred Laningham followed with the winner
when the throw from shortstop Bobby Ralston,
via Hale, was late.
Gwaltney was the beneficiary, evening out his
record at 1-1 and Blankenship (4-3) absorbed the
loss.
Yesterday, Stanford's Kevin Kunkel apparently
thought he could top Radtke's performance. His
no-hit bid lasted only four innings, but at least he
got the win in a 4-1 triumph, his third against five
losses.

Kunkel was exuberant. "1 think our pitching
staff is coming of age. I think we're in (the Pac
-10) race because I think our pitching can shut
down anybody."
The Cardinal built an early 4-0 cushion against
loser Derek Huenneke (1-5). Pete Stanicek
tripled and scored in the first and then homered in
the fifth to make it 2-0. Lundblade added u two
run double in the seventh.
Kunkel, who gave up only three hits in his
complete-game victory, was nicked for a wind
blown home run by Pat Coveney to leadoff the
eighth and looked to be in more trouble when the
next batter, pinch hitter O'Donnell, laced a deep
drive to right-center field.
But center fielder Darryl Stephens raced over
and made a spectacular diving grab to silence the
Wildcats short-lived rally and seal Stanford's
sweep.
The Cardinal will now try to carry the momen
tum of a five-game win streak on the road when
they travel to Santa Clara Tuesday and then visit
UCLA for a three-game set beginning Thursday.

the ballpark to put Arizona up 3-2. But after
Doug Gwaltney relieved Radtke to retire the side,
Blankenship also learned that life is not fair.
Two singles in the Stanford tenth sent Blanken
ship to the bench in favor of reliever Chip Dill.
Dill got two men out, but balked the runners to
second and third. Up stepped freshman Toi Cook,
with all of 24 at-bats under his belt this year. He
gave the Card a 4-3 win when he slapped a l-l
pitch up the middle that second baseman Hale
knocked down with a desparation dive.
John Verducci scored the tying run and pinch
runner Fred Laningham followed with the winner
when the throw from shortstop Bobby Ralston,
via Hale, was late.
Gwaltney was the beneficiary, evening out his
record at 1-1 and Blankenship (4-3) absorbed the
loss.
Yesterday, Stanford's Kevin Kunkel apparently
thought he could top Radtke's performance. His
no-hit bid lasted only four innings, but at least he
got the win in a 4-1 triumph, his third against five
losses.

Kunkel was exuberant. "1 think our pitching
staff is coming of age. I think we're in (the Pac
-10) race because I think our pitching can shut
down anybody."
The Cardinal built an early 4-0 cushion against
loser Derek Huenneke (1-5). Pete Stanicek
tripled and scored in the first and then homered in
the fifth to make it 2-0. Lundblade added u two
run double in the seventh.
Kunkel, who gave up only three hits in his
complete-game victory, was nicked for a wind
blown home run by Pat Coveney to leadoff the
eighth and looked to be in more trouble when the
next batter, pinch hitter O'Donnell, laced a deep
drive to right-center field.
But center fielder Darryl Stephens raced over
and made a spectacular diving grab to silence the
Wildcats short-lived rally and seal Stanford's
sweep.
The Cardinal will now try to carry the momen
tum of a five-game win streak on the road when
they travel to Santa Clara Tuesday and then visit
UCLA for a three-game set beginning Thursday.

Pitching and detense — lots
of it.
The Stanford baseball team
used that combination to keep
its postseason playoff hopes
alive with a three-game sweep
of the University of Arizona
that chased the Wildcats back to
Tucson, their offense gasping
for air.
All three of Stanford's start
ing pitchers hurled a full nine in
nings. one even flirting with des
tiny. as the Card played some of
its best baseball of the season to
give Head Coach Mark
Marquess wins No. 300. 301
and 302. and boosted its record
to 27-IS-1 in the process.
The Cardinal, now 10-8 and
four-and-one-half games out of
first in the Pacific-10 Southern
Division race, dropped Arizona
to 17-29 and 6-12 in the league.
The odds on Stanford reaching
the NCAA regional are still
high and the key to getting there
is still simple.
"We have to show that we're
playing well at the end of the
year and then hope for the
best," Marquess explained yes
terday.
Beginning on Friday, the
Card set out to establish that it
was indeed playing well.
Marquess became only the
second Stanford manager to
reach the 300-win plateau as
Stanford exploded for its biggest
inning of the year to back the
six-hit pitching of junior south
paw Jeff Ballard in a 1 2-5 romp.

Only Ray Young. Marquess
predecessor, tallied more wins.
Young notched 323 victories
during his nine-year stint (I 965-76)
76) on the Farm.
"I hope we get to the next
300 a little quicker." was the
Stanford mentor's response to
the fuss. "We II take em one at
a time."
The Cardinal sent 14 hitters
to the plate in a nine-run sixth
inning that chased Arizona s top
starter Joe Magrane (6-6) and
gave Stanford an insur
mountable 12-1 lead. Mike
Dcßcnon. who went 4 tor 5
with five RBl's on the after
noon. collected a single, a
double and three RBIs in the
uprising. Ballard raised his
record to 5-4 with the complete
game \ictorv.
Unlike Magrane. Arizona's
second-game starter. Kevin
Blankcnship, reduced the
Cards' batting averages rather
than padding them by surren
dering but one hit through eight
innings.
That hit was a powerful drive
off the bat of Darryl Stephens
that kissed the scoreboard in
leftfield for a solo home run that
gave Stanford a 1-0 lead. It was
also the only hit in the ballgame
through the top of the eighth.
That's right: Stanford's John
Radtke was pitching a dream
game, a no-hitter. Through
seven innings he pitched to just

dinal, 12-5 Friday, 4-3 Saturday and 4-1 yesterday.
22 batters, one over the minimum. Radtke was six
outs from destiny — and a few outs from disaster.
With two gone in the eighth, Garr Millay
stroked a grounder past a diving Ken Green at
third to ruin the senior right hander's bid for
glory.
Radtke was obviously disappointed afterwards:
"I can't tell you how much I wanted the no-hitter.
I thought I had a great chance to get it.(The
pitch) was a slider that was up on his hands."
The worst was yet to come. Leading off the
ninth, pinch-hitter Joe O'Donnell got Arizona's
second hit on a Baltimore chop. A few batters
later, Dave Cooper rapped a single to right field
that put the Wildcats and Blankenship ahead 2-1
and sent Radtke and his teammates to the dugout
shaking their heads.
"1 had a no-hitter in the eighth and I'm close to
getting a loss," said Radtke. "It's one of those
things where life isn't fair."
Stanford refused to go down, parlaying an in
field hit and Rick Lundblade's two-out check
swing double down the right field line into the
tying run.
