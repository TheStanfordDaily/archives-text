# Cardinal women ace out Arizona, trounce the Trojans in tennis play
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis team may
just be unstoppable. The netters extended
their winning streak to IS matches with a
pair of WCAA victories at home this
weekend, blowing past Arizona, 8-1, Friday
and then disposing of No. 7-ranked USC in
surprisingly easy fashion. 7-2, Saturday.

conference record to 12-0 with only two

dez has been a thorn in the Cardinal's side
this year. Last week she defeated Leigh
Anne Eldredge at fourth singles, and she
has won both of her doubles matches
against Stanford.
The other moves didn't pay off for the
Trojans. They came close to getting a win at
No. 3, but Kate Gompert held off Heliana
Steden, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3. Gompert was a game
away from losing to Steden, the No. 2-
ranked singles player in the nation, trailing

Last Saturday Stanford won its first match against
USC in Los Angeles since Head Coach Frank
Brennan took over five years ago.

WC'AA matches remaining. Despite being
undefeated in 18 outings, Stanford fell to
No. 2 in last week's NCAA poll, behind
Texas' Trinity College. The folks who do
the voting may be questioning that move
after this weekend, though.
The Cardinal beat USC in Los Angeles a
week ago. the first Stanford victory there
since Head Coach Frank Brennan took over
five years ago. The 5-4 win was only the
second loss for the Trojans at home in their
last 96 starts. Things were a little easier for
Brennan and his team this weekend back on
the Farm.
The Card clinched this one in the singles
matches, opening a 5-1 lead, then took two
of the three doubles matches. In Los An
geles, the Trojans won only one of the top
four singles matches, which prompted them
to shuttle their lineup. It didn't help. USC
won only one of the top four matches again.
That came at No. 2, where Linda Gates
fell to Cecila Fernandez. 6-3. 6-3. Fernan

5-2 in the second set. but she took the next
five straight games to win the set. She also
suffered from leg cramps during the match
and did not play her scheduled doubles
match.
Patty Fendick registered another impres
sive win at first doubles, defeating Kelly
Henry, 6-3, 6-4. Fendick had also beaten
I lenry in their earlier meeting.
Eldredge faced Cheryl Jones — normally
the Trojans' No. 3 player — at fourth
singles, and recorded a 6-3. 6-4 victory.
Michelle Weiss faced Susan Pendo again
at No. 5 and avenged an earlier loss with a
3-6, 6-2. 6-2 win. At No. 6 Stephanie
Savides clinched the match for Stanford by
defeating Carol Heynen for the second time
in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.
In doubles Fendick and Eldredge made
up for last week's loss to Henry and Pendo
by coming back to knock off the USC duo,
2-6, 7-5, 6-3. The Trojan pair was ranked in

the top ten in the nation. Gates and Savides
moved up to No. 2 and came away with a 3-
6, 6-2, 6-2 triumph over Jones and Dana
Levy. At No. 3 Barbara Baughman filled in
for Gompert and teamed with Weiss, but
the pair fell to Steden and Fernandez, 6-4,
6-3.
The Cardinal hadn't expected things to be
so easy. As Kldredge said, "We were really
surprised we won it in the singles. It was
great."
Friday's match was a little easier. Stan
ford svvepf flic similes matches and dropped
only one doubles contest to the Wildcats.
In that match it was Brennan who did the
lineup shifting, and it obviously paid off.
Gompert moved into the top spot and
demolished Cheryl Tebbutt, 6-0, 6-1.
Eldredge moved up to No. 2 and responded
with a 6-1. 6-3 win over Joan Levedeff.
Weiss shifted up two notches to No. 3 and
defeated Jill Smoller, 6-3, 6-2.
Playing down at No. 4, Fendick blanked
Julie Newell, 6-0, 6-0. Gates recorded a 6-
3, 6-4 win over Tina Rimer at No. 5, and
Savides put away Kim Jones at No. 6, 6-3,
7-6.
Gates and Savides played at No. 1
doubles and defeated Smoller and Newell,
6-2. 6-3. At No. 3, Gompert and Weiss put
away Tebbutt and Karen Bucholz, 6-3, 6-1.
The Card's only loss of the day came at
No. 2 doubles, where Fendick and Eldredge
dropped a 7-5, 1-6, 6-4 decision to
Lebedeff and Rimer. "We didn't put it to
gether at all," Eldredge said. "We're
streaky, but we haven't flaked out that
badly all year.'"
The netters have indeed been doing very
little flaking out all year. Their next match is
tomorrow against Long Beach State.
Thursday they face UC-Santa Barbara in a
non-conference match. Both contests begin
at 1:30 p.m. at the Varsity Courts.
