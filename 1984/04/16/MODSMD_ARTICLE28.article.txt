# Hawaii next for Card
## Spikers strike Aztecs 
### TRASK LEONARD 
The men's volleyball team
lifted itself off the floor after
losing the first game of Friday's
match against No. 5-ranked San
Diego State and came hack to
defeat the Aztecs, 3-1.
The win puts the Cardinal at
6-10 in the competitive Califor
nia Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association (CIVA), and drops
San Diego to 9-9 and out of the
CIVA playoffs.
The Aztecs took charge early,
winning the first game I 5-7. But
after a very long and hard
fought second game, Stanford
came out ahead 19-17. The
Cardinal then cruised on its mo
mentum and determined play of
game two and took the last
two games, 15-11 and 15-8.
The key to the match was
clearly the second game, in
which both teams struggled
back from deficits, until Stan
ford ended up with the win.
"The way we played at the
end of the second game, coming
back when San Diego was about
to close us out, was what won
this match for us," said Asst.
Coach Don Shaw. "We had just
played an awful first game, and

to come back and fight in the
second like we did was what we
needed. It was a definite shot in
the arm."
The first game saw many
mental errors by the Cardinal,
who started the game down 7-3,
and from then on had no chance
of capturing the game. If Stan
ford had lost the tight second
game after giving the Aztecs the
first, the outcome of the match
probably would have been a lot
different.
"We're a very young team,
and as a result, we still need to
prove to ourselves that we can
win," said middle blocker Jon
Root. "After we played super
and won that second game, we
knew that we could beat them.
All we needed was a little confi
dence; we definitely have the
talent to knock off many other
good teams like San Diego."
In the second game, Stanford
jumped out to an early 5-0 lead,
but saw its lead evaporate until
the Aztecs made their move and
went ahead 9-8. The game went
back and forth from then until
the Cardinal won 19-17, turning
back many San Diego match
points.

Another important aspect of
the spikers' play, according to
Shaw, was the outstanding
bench support.
"Dan Parr wasn't playing too
well in the first game so we put
in Chris Braun and he played a
tremendous game," said Shaw.
"A year or so ago, we couldn't
count on the bench as we can
now."
In the third game, several
questionable calls were made
against Stanford, but unlike
against Long Beach last week,
the otficials had no great effect
on their play.
"When we put in a little extra
etfort as we did against San
Diego, nothing like that seems
to bother us a lot," said outside
hitter Brett Monello.
With their confidence at a
high level, the spikers easily
won the final game, 15-8.
Leading the match for all
players was Root with 33 kills.
Monello followed close behind
with 29.
Tomorrow the team leaves
lor Hawaii to finish off the
season with two games against
the University of Hawaii, a team
that Stanford has never beaten
on its home court.

Freshman Stephanie Savides grimaces as she turns a forehand, but she and her teammates
were all smiles after they won both of their matches here over the weekend.
