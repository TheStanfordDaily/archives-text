# Smog gets to Card in L.A.; netters lose to USC, UCLA
## 
### 
By TOM CLIFFORD
With a five-game winning streak at
stake, the Stanford men's tennis team
battled No. 1- and No. 2-ranked UCLA
and USC in Los Angeles this weekend
and lost both matches by the identical
score of 6-3. The defeats pushed the
Cardinal's record to 15-4 overall and 5-2
in the Pacific-10 Conference.
Stanford's Head Coach Dick Gould
was nevertheless pleased with his team's
performance, although victories in L.A.
would have been ideal. Since Stanford
will meet USC and UCLA again, Gould
was hoping for signs which would indi
cate that the Cardinal can sweep when
the two schools visit the Farm next
weekend. He got them.
The first indication was the Cardinal's
singles play, which continued to improve
ok they knocked off top-ranked players.
Stanford was able to win three of the six
singles matches on both Friday against
USC and Saturday against UCLA.
Perhaps the most impressive perfor
mance, however, was by the Cardinal's
top-seed, Dan Goldie. Goldie defeated
USC's No. 5-nationally ranked Todd
Wilsken 7-5, 6-4, and UCLA's No. 11-
ranked Jeff Klaparda 6-3, 6-4. As of
April 2, Goldie was ranked No. 26.
Gould emphasized Goldie's progress
since the rankings last came out. "Since
April, he has wins against the No. 5-, 6-,
9-, 10-, 11-, and 17-ranked players in
the country. He should move up into the

top ten," he said.
Freshman Derrick Rostagno also had
wins on both days — and both in straight
sets. Against USC's Tim Pawsat, Ros
tagno won 7-6, 6-3. He also crushed
UCLA's Mark Basham, 6-3, 6-3.
Other winners for the Cardinal in
cluded Mark McKeen, who, after losing
to USC's Jorge Lozano, defeated
UCLA's Chuck Willenborg, 6-1, 6-2.
Stanford sophomore John Letts defeated
Paul Emerson of USC, 6-1, 6-7, 6-1.
"Mark has beaten Lozano in four
times previous to this and he also has the
best won-loss record on the team. And
John is good enough that he shouldn't
lose a match at No. 6 (singles)," Gould
said.
Gould also has confidence in his No. 2
and No. 3 singles players. Eric Rosen
feld. No. 2, and Jim Grabb, No. 3, both
played in close matches, but failed to
.score for the Cardinal. "Eric and John
are a lot better than they played down
there," he said.
While the potential of the Cardinal
singles players became evident, Gould
was also pleased with the strength of the
doubles play, although none of the teams
came up winners.
"We know we can beat both USC's
and UCLA's No. 1 doubles team and
(against USC) our No. 2 doubles was
very close to winning," Gould said.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team of
Grabb and Letts almost knocked off

Lozano and Todd Wilsken of USC (who
own the No. 1 overall ranking in the
country), losing 7-6, 4-6, 7-5. UCLA's
No. 1 doubles team is just as tough. The
Bruins' team came back to defeat the
Cardinal duo 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
Gould felt the No. 2 doubles play of
McKeen and Rostagno was close to vic
tory against the Trojans. They lost 6-4,
6-4. "It went to 4-4 (in the first set). We
were really in position; we were very
much in the match. We just have to put
things together," Gould said. UCLA was
tough and beat the team of McKeen and
Rostagno, 6-1, 6-2.
Still, it is significant that the Cardinal
played well away from its home courts.
Gould was optimistic about the Car
dinal's ability to win both matches
against USC and UCLA next weekend.
"Overall," he said, " 1 am very en
couraged. 1 think we're really set. We
played tight matches and we played them
down to the wire. 1 think the home court
can make a difference.
"I feel really good about this weekend.
If we can get the students behind us, I
think we can do a great job. This
weekend we're going to have the No. 1
and No. 2 teams here; they may not be
that when they leave."
The Cardinal meets San Jose State on
the Varsity Courts at 1:30 p.m. tomor
row. The team then has the rest of the
week to prepare for the important
weekend matches.


Sophomore Dan Coldie stretched to win his matches
this weekend; he beat his USC opponent as well as his

)ae So/Daily file
UCLA competitor. The Cardinal still dropped its
matches to the Trojans and the Bruins.

mance, however, was by the Cardinal's
top-seed, Dan Goldie. Goldie defeated
USC's No. 5-nationally ranked Todd
Wilsken 7-5, 6-4, and UCLA's No. 11-
ranked Jeff Klaparda 6-3, 6-4. As of
April 2, Goldie was ranked No. 26.
Gould emphasized Goldie's progress
since the rankings last came out. "Since
April, he has wins against the No. 5-, 6-,
9-, 10-, 11-, and 17-ranked players in
the country. He should move up into the

top ten," he said.
Freshman Derrick Rostagno also had
wins on both days — and both in straight
sets. Against USC's Tim Pawsat, Ros
tagno won 7-6, 6-3. He also crushed
UCLA's Mark Basham, 6-3, 6-3.
Other winners for the Cardinal in
cluded Mark McKeen, who, after losing
to USC's Jorge Lozano, defeated
UCLA's Chuck Willenborg, 6-1, 6-2.
Stanford sophomore John Letts defeated
Paul Emerson of USC, 6-1, 6-7, 6-1.
"Mark has beaten Lozano in four
times previous to this and he also has the
best won-loss record on the team. And
John is good enough that he shouldn't
lose a match at No. 6 (singles)," Gould
said.
Gould also has confidence in his No. 2
and No. 3 singles players. Eric Rosen
feld. No. 2, and Jim Grabb, No. 3, both
played in close matches, but failed to
.score for the Cardinal. "Eric and John
are a lot better than they played down
there," he said.
While the potential of the Cardinal
singles players became evident, Gould
was also pleased with the strength of the
doubles play, although none of the teams
came up winners.
"We know we can beat both USC's
and UCLA's No. 1 doubles team and
(against USC) our No. 2 doubles was
very close to winning," Gould said.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team of
Grabb and Letts almost knocked off

Lozano and Todd Wilsken of USC (who
own the No. 1 overall ranking in the
country), losing 7-6, 4-6, 7-5. UCLA's
No. 1 doubles team is just as tough. The
Bruins' team came back to defeat the
Cardinal duo 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
Gould felt the No. 2 doubles play of
McKeen and Rostagno was close to vic
tory against the Trojans. They lost 6-4,
6-4. "It went to 4-4 (in the first set). We
were really in position; we were very
much in the match. We just have to put
things together," Gould said. UCLA was
tough and beat the team of McKeen and
Rostagno, 6-1, 6-2.
Still, it is significant that the Cardinal
played well away from its home courts.
Gould was optimistic about the Car
dinal's ability to win both matches
against USC and UCLA next weekend.
"Overall," he said, " 1 am very en
couraged. 1 think we're really set. We
played tight matches and we played them
down to the wire. 1 think the home court
can make a difference.
"I feel really good about this weekend.
If we can get the students behind us, I
think we can do a great job. This
weekend we're going to have the No. 1
and No. 2 teams here; they may not be
that when they leave."
The Cardinal meets San Jose State on
the Varsity Courts at 1:30 p.m. tomor
row. The team then has the rest of the
week to prepare for the important
weekend matches.


Sophomore Dan Coldie stretched to win his matches
this weekend; he beat his USC opponent as well as his

)ae So/Daily file
UCLA competitor. The Cardinal still dropped its
matches to the Trojans and the Bruins.
