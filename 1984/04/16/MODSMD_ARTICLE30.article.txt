# Golfers lose Pepsi challenge
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
The Stanford men's golf team
continued its frustrating month
long slump this weekend as it
struggled to a lOth-place finish
in the Fresno-Pepsi Classic, held
at the Sunnyside Country Club
in Fresno.
Host team Fresno State won
the two-day, 54-hole tourna
ment, pulling out a surprising
five-stroke victory over power
ful USC. The Trojans, who won
last week's Stanford U.S. Inter
collegiate by 29 strokes, are
ranked sixth in the nation.
Taking individual honors was
USC's red-hot Sam Randolph,
who scorched the demanding
Sunnyside course with a ten
under-par 206. Stanford's Carl
Johnson, a sophomore who has
claimed victories in each of the
last three tournaments held on
the Stanford Golf Course,
simply described Randolph as,
among other things,
"awesome."
The Cardinal golfers were, for

the third straight tournament,
unable to muster any awesome
play of their own. "We've had
high expectations for our
selves," said sophomore Don
Walsworth, "and 1 think we've
been pressuring a little too
much."
The low scorer for Stanford
was senior Tim Robinson, who
shot an even-par 216. Senior
Lanny Sawchuck finished with a
222, followed by junior Scott
Erickson with a 223, Wagner
with a 224, junior Doug
Thompson with a 226 and
Walsworth with a 229.
Despite finishing fourth, sixth
and tenth in their last three out
ings. the mood of the Stanford
golfers is determinedly optimis
tic as they head into the
homestretch of their run for an
NCAA tournament bid.
Walsworth remains convinced
that the team stands a "good
chance" of winning the Pacific
-10 Championships at the end of
the month, a victory which
would assure the Cardinal of an

NCAA berth.
In addition to the Pac-10
champion, the NCAA will invite
five other teams from the Far
West region, and Stanford is still
in the running for one of those
spots.
According to Walsworth,
Stanford, Arizona, San Jose
State and the University of the
Pacific are the main competitors
for the final three regional in
vitations, although Fresno State
could still conceivably gain a
tournament bid.
"If we could finish ahead of at
least one or two of those teams
in our last three tournaments, I
think we'll be looking all right, "
said Walsworth.
The next tournament for the
Cardinal is the Western Inter
collegiate, U be held in Santa
Cruz from April 17-19, and
Walsworth minces no words in
assessing the importance of this
and the remaining two tourna
ments on the schedule.
"Starting here," he said flatly,
"it's now or never."
