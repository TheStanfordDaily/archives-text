# USW set to file charges against Stanford today

### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
The United Stanford Workers
(USW) will file two charges today of
unfair labor practices against the Uni
versity with the National Labor Rela
tions Board (NLRB).
The first charge cites the University
with reneging on its contract with
USW by refusing to recognize officials
of Local 680 of the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) in griev
ance and arbitration hearings.
The second charge accuses the Uni
versity of illegally interfering in inter
nal union affairs in an attempt to dis
rupt Wednesday's USW referendum
election.
Jim Eggleston, counsel to USW,
said the first charge is based on Stan
ford's "refusal to honor an existing
contract." He said that although both
Locals 715 and 680 as well as the In
ternational have agreed to sever their
connections, Stanford has refused to

recognize officials of Local 680 as
legitimate representatives of the bar
gaining unit.
"Local 715 has informed Stanford
in writing that 680 is to be their cer
tified representative," Eggleston said.
Local 680, representing the 1200-
member USW bargaining unit, affili
ated with Local 715, a 9000-member
union serving Santa Clara County, in
1980. A move to disaffiliate was un
dertaken last December by both local
unions and was approved by the
800,000-member international in
February.
Michael Vartain, associate staff
counsel for the University, said the
University has not neglected its con
tract. "The contract has stayed in ef
fect; nothing has changed," he said.
"In fact, it's Local 715 that has
backed down on its contractual obliga
tion," Vartain said. "Since February,
Local 715 has refused to represent its
employees."

Though officials from Local 680
have attempted to represent
employees in hearings, Vartain said
that Local 680 is not the legal repre
sentative of the bargaining unit and
that Local 715 is still "the party to the
contract."
"We don't believe Local 680 has
been authorized by the employees
yet," he said, and added that recogni
tion would not occur until a formal
vote of disaffiliation is taken.
Eggleston maintains that both the
affiliation in 1980 and the present
severance proceedings are "internal
union matters" and "entirely consis
tent with NL.RB precedent.
"Legally the process is appropriate.
First you deal with the internal ma
chinery and then you put it to an ap
proval vote. In the interim. 715 has
designated its legal representative. It's
analagous to if 7 1 5 had a change in its
