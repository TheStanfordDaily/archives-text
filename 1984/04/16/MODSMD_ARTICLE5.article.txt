## Streleski to remain in prison 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
With wire reports
Convicted killer Theodore Streleski had his parole
revoked for six months Friday when a two-member state
panel ruled that he violated his parole conditions on
March 8.
Streleski, 47, was released on parole last month after
serving five and one-half years in prison for the 1978 ham
mer slaying of Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw. But of
ficials returned him to prison immediately because he told
authorities and news reporters that he planned to violate
parole when he reached his parole location in Orange
County.
"When a parolee expressly states he will violate the con
ditions of parole . . . this board is not required to wait un
til a parolee actually commits crime." the Board of
'farus panel ruled.
Streleski was charged with three parole violations:
refusing to cooperate with release procedures, refusing to
cooperate with parole procedures and refusing to accept
parole supervision.
The panel rejected the first two charges as
"inappropriate" but upheld the third, imposing the maxi
mum six-month term for parole violation and saying that
Streleski "represents a significant danger to others."
"It is not possible to predict his future acts," the panel
said in the ruling read to Streleski by Hearing Officer Bob
Seabridge. The decision described Streleski as "more than
a little grandiose. ... He feels he is a person with a mission
or a message."
Though Streleski told the panel his frustration with
Stanford, where he struggled unsuccessfully for 19 years to

obtain a doctorate in mathematics, "has been worked off
by the murder," the parole panel said Streleski "still feels
a great deal of anger at Stanford."
Streleski has said he would rather serve the remainder
of his sentence in prison than accept a conditional parole
forbidding him to enter four counties surrounding Stan
ford.
"I want to do the time," Streleski said. "I want to 'top
out.' "
Streleski repeated his claim that Stanford officials pres
sured the state to change the original parole destination
from San Francisco to the City of Orange. For this reason
he opted to remain incarcerated, telling parole officials he
wants to be released only without the stipulation prohibit
ing him from returning to the Bay Area.
Parole officials said Streleski had refused to sign routine
document* acknnw)edjzinj> receipt <>/ /»<•/-** /•>/ < >/u-/ /%
aiiU at litt ids tcfuscU iu accept gate
money," and told authorities he intended to violate his
parole "in a non-violent way" when he arrived in Orange
County.
Streleski's board-appointed lawyer, Michael McGowan,
argued that Streleski did nothing after his release that vio
lated any conditions, and that simply announcing an inten
tion to violate parole is not itself a violation.
But the panel decided that "a clear intention to break
parole did violate the conditions," according to Joan
Cavanaugh, executive officer of the Board of Prison
Terms.
Under current state law, a convicted killer found guilty
of a parole violation may be returned to prison for life, but
under 1978 law, which applies to Streleski, six months is
the maximum period for such a violation.
Streleski may receive two additional six-month sen
tences it he again violates parole, but in 18 months he must
he unconditionally discharged.
He again refused to promise he would not return to
campus but said he has no plans to do so.
"In a formal public proceeding, 1 won't promise that,"
he said, "but in my head right now . . . there's no intention
of ever setting foot on the campus of Stanford University."
