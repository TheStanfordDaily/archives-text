# Discovery of afflicted donor prompts call for new AIDS tests
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer With wire reports 
A doctor here has called for in
creased testing of blood donors after it
was discovered recently that a man
who gave blood 13 times in the Bay
Area over the last four years suffers
from Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome, or AIDS.
Eight of the 12 patients who
received blood between 1980 and
1983 from the man have died, al
though none showed symptoms of
AIDS.
Of the three who survive, only one
has abnormalities that may indicate
AIDS. However, Dr. Edgar
Engleman, director of the Stanford
Blood Bank and professor of pathol
ogy at the Medical School, cautioned
that the disease does have a two- to
three-year incubation period.
The man, whom medical officials
refuse to identify, only donated blood
to Stanford once — in July 1983 at a
mobile unit at a local industry,
Engleman said.
But Stanford rejected his blood at

that time because, unlike most blood
banks, it uses biological testing to
detect blood that may carry AIDS.
"The test enables us to throw out
the blood of people who don't have
clinically apparent AIDS," said
Engleman.
"Stanford has been screening all
blood for AIDS since June 1983, but
up until now other blood banks have
relied upon voluntary deferral by
donors," said Engleman.
"This case shows we have to im
prove our screening process," he said.
In the past two to three weeks, other
Bay Area blood banks have an
nounced their intention to use biologi
cal tests on donated blood.
Under voluntary deferral, blood
banks hand out information sheets
and ask high-risk groups not to donate
blood.
This form of screening is useful.
Engleman said, but many people
donate blood anyway. These donors
may inadvertantly spread AIDS since
seemingly healthy people may have
the disease for two to three years
before it becomes clinically apparent.

Biological testing has not been used
previously bv most blood banks be
cause it shows "false affirmatives," or
non-diseased blood appearing to be
diseased. Engleman said, and because
"a lot of blood banks had been ar
guing that AIDS was not a problem
for blood banks."
However, 41 people have con
tracted the disease from blood trans
fusions and all have died, according to
the National Center for Disease Con
trol in Atlanta.
"Biological testing should be done
everywhere, especially in high-risk
areas like San Francisco. Los Angeles
and New York. We feel very strongly
that it should be a mandatory require
ment." Engleman said.
The donor, a homosexual in his 3()s,
has been under treatment at the Uni
versity of California-Irvine Medical
Center since it was discovered a few
weeks ago that he had AIDS.
The man had a skin infection at the
time of his last blood donation in July
and now has Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare
skin cancer that frequently afflicts
AIDS victims.
