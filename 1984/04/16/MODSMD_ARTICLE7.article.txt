Bomb kills two U.S. diplomats
Johannesburg, South Africa — Two American diplomats
involved in monitoring the pullback of South African troops
Ironi southern Angola were killed yesterday in a bomb explo
sion near the Angolan-Namibian border. South African and
U.S. authorities reported.
South African authorities, who administer Namibia (South
west Africa) under a long-expired League of Nations
mandate, said that the two Americans were refueling their
automobile at Okatana, just northwest of Oshakati. when a
bomb was exploded at a fuel pump adjacent to their vehicle.
Oshakati is South Africa's military headquarters in northern
Namibia.
One of the Americans was killed instantly and the other
died from burns en route to a hospital, the announcement
said. Official announcement of the identities of the slain
Americans was delayed until their next of kin in the United
States are notified.
Rebel leader in Nicaragua
plans appeal for Israeli aid
Washington — The largest Nicaraguan rebel group plans to
ask Israel for aid because Congress has 112 ailed to authorize any
further CIA expenditures for the "contras"' fight against the
leftist Sandinista government, a rebel official said yesterday.
The official, a member of the Nicaraguan Democratic
Force, said the leaders of his organization were scheduled to
meet with U.S. intelligence officials today to discuss their op
tions for finding new funds.
The Reagan administration has requested $21 million to
continue its covert aid to the rebels, but the Democratic-led
House of Representatives postponed action on the issue last
week amid an uproar over the CIA-directed mining of
Nicaragua's harbors.
"We can do without the mining, but we cannot wage a war
without resources," said the rebel official, who asked not to
be identified by name.
He said that without substantial aid soon, the estimated
15,000 rebels grouped in three rival organizations would
begin shutting down their military operations. "We will
survive as a movement, but we won't be able to do anything
that will have a real effect on the Sandinistas," he said.
The CIA has warned in unusually open statements that the
last congressional appropriation for the covert war — $24
million approved last November — "is running out quickly,"
in the words of one intelligence official.
U.S. arms sales upset China
Peking — China warned President Reagan yesterday that
the continuing controversy over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan
cannot be avoided during his discussions with Chinese leaders
here later this month and that Taiwan would remain at the
center of Sino-American relations for a long time.
The authoritative journal World Affairs declared in a
review of relations between Peking and Washington that the
Taiwan issue cannot be bypassed, as it said some Americans
hope, if ties between the two countries are to improve and
economic cooperation is to expand.
Reagan will be pressed by Chinese leaders during his six
day visit here to use what the journal called "his power of dis
cretion" to reduce weapons sales to Taiwan, as the United
States promised to do in August 1982.
ministration officials have sought to minimize the importance
of Taiwan in relations between Peking and Washington, sug
gesting that this controversy was largely behind them. But
World Affairs said that, just as Taiwan was the focus of vir
tually every major Sino-American negotiation from initial
contacts in 1955 through the visit to Washington in January
of Premier Zhao Ziyank, "neither will it be possible to sides
tep this issue in the future."
Israel warns terrorist backers
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet vowed yesterday to take
action against Arab governments that support terrorist at
tacks on Israeli targets, but it was intentionally vague about
just what it might do.
"We all know the part of several Arab states in supporting
terrorism," Cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor told reporters
after a meeting devoted almost entirely to last week's hijack
ing of an Israeli civilian bus. "Our position here is known, and
all the relevant parties know our position."
But w hen he was asked to be more specific, Meridor would
only say that the Israeli government would "react accord
ingly."
The Damascus-based Popular Front claimed responsibility
for last week's bus hijacking, but Israeli Defense Minister
Moshe Arens has said it was more likely that Fatah was re
sponsible.
Hart takes Arizona caucases
Los Angeles — It has been, in his own words, a "rough
couple of weeks" for Gary Hart, but the Colorado senator
wrapped up a two-day California campaign swing yesterday
in good spirits after a victory in the Arizona Democratic
caucuses and declared that "things look better now, particu
larly now that we're here in the West."
After successive losses to Walter Mondale in the Illinois,
New York and Pennsylvania primaries, Hart met with
reporters for an outdoor press conference at the Beverly Hil
ton Hotel in Beverly Hills to suggest that momentum in the
1954 race for the Democratic presidential nomination once
again has shifted in his favor.
Hart won 45.4 percent of the 34,000 votes, compared to
39.8 percent for Mondale and 13.4 percent for Jesse Jackson.
California primary will play
key role in Democratic race
Los Angeles — As the Democratic presidential race heads
into its second phase, California, which has the richest trea
sure of delegates in the country, now promises to play its most
important role in the nominating process in more than a de
cade.
Only a few months ago, when it appeared that former Vice
President Walter Mondale would lock up the nomination by
late spring. California's June 5 primary looked virtually irrel
evant. Democrats in Sacramento, the state capital, even
prepared legislation to move up the primary date in the
future.
But now. because of the volatile pattern of the Democratic
race and a rule change allowing convention delegates more
freedom to change their minds, California has become very
important in the eyes of the three major contenders.
First, with its 209 delegates to be chosen on primary day,
California gives Mondale — who is far ahead of Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson in
delegates — a chance to wrap up the nomination on the last
day of the primary season.
Second, even if the nomination is not wrapped up in Cali
fornia. just winning the primary will give a candidate tremen
dous momentum going into critical "horse-trading" period
between the end of the primary season and the opening of the
Democratic convention in San Francisco on July 16,
