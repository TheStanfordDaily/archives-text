From the 1 os Angeles l imes
Beirut. Lebanon — A professor ;it the American
University of Beirut who was kidnapped more than two
months ago was rescued yesterday afternoon when
Moslem militiamen stormed into a West Beirut house
and set him free.
Frank Regier. chairman ol the engineering depart
ment at the university, was freed along with a French
engineer. Christian Joubert. who was also in the house.
Neither was harmed.
The two men were released in the presence of U.S.
Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew at the home of
Nabih Bcrri. the Shia Moslem leader whose militiamen
now control major portions of West Beirut.
Regier and Joubert both wore red and white striped
pajamas, their attire during captivity, and they were
heavily bearded from their months of confinement. The
men said they were blindfolded during the two months
they were held captive.
"Let me say it was a terrifying experience." said

Regier. 50. who has lived in Beirut for 27 years. "I am
very happy to be here.
'1 believed I would get out eventually, but I
sometimes questioned whether my sanitv would still be
intact at that time."
Regier said that he and Joubert were held in several
locations during the last two months but that he
suspected they were always inside Beirut because ol the
sound of gunfire he kept hearing.
Berri would say only that the kidnappers of the two
men were members of a fundamentalist Islamic sect.
He appeared reluctant to divulge any more informa
tion. possibly because of concern for the safety ol two
other missing Americans.
The latter are William Buckley, a political officer at
the U.S. Embassy and Jeremy Levin. Beirut bureau
chief for Cable News Network. Buckley was kidnapped
March 16 while en route to the embassy. Levin was
believed to have been kidnapped March 7. although the
circumstances of his disappearance are cloudy. He was

at home 111 the Cili l\ morning but did not arrive at work
later in the day. No ransom demands or claims of re
sponsibility have been made in the cases of either
Buckley or I evin. but none were ever made tor Regier
or Joubvert.
Regier was forced into a black automobile as he
walked along a street near the university Feb. 10. His
abuction occurred tour days aftei Moslem militiamen
took control of West Beirut away from the army and on
the same day tluit the U.S. Embassy was carrying out a
helicopter evacuation of Americans from the city be
cause of fears that the anarchy here would be danger
ous for U.S. citizens. The next day. a number of
Americans who showed up for the second phase of the
evacuation said that Regier's kidnapping had convinced
them to leave.
Joubert. 3b. was also abducted in February by gun
men who forced him into a car. He was heie to woik on
the construction of prefabricated homes for a local
Sunni Moslem charitable organization.
