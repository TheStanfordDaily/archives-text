# CIA points to threats in Nicaragua
## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Washington — The Reagan adminis
tration is try ing to salvage faltering con
gressional and public support for its se
cret war against Nicaragua by attempting
to focus new attention on the size of the
Soviet and Cuban military buildup in
Central America and playing down the
controversy over U.S.-directed mining of
Nicaraguan harbors.
In an effort to rescue $21 million in
funding for the covert operations, CIA

Director William Casey told the Senate
last week that the controversial ClA
directed mining of Nicaraguan harbors
was not an integral part of the program.
President Reagan and intelligence offi
cials also began giv ing stronger emphasis
to specific figures about the scope of the
threat they see in the region.
CIA officials have said that their intel
ligence collection shows:
• The Soviet Union is spending between
$4 billion and $4.5 billion each year in

Cuba and $250 million to $300 million
elsewhere in Central America.
• The Soviets have about 10.000 person
nel in Cuba: 8000 of these are tech
nicians and 2000 are military. There are
also about 100 Soviets in Nicaragua.
• The Cubans have between 7000 and
10.000 personnel in Nicaragua, ot whom
between 2500 and 3500 are military.
Casey has said that the Cuban military
personnel in Nicaragua have shaved their
Castro-style beards, discarded their

Cuban uniforms and been integrated into
manv units of the regular Sandinistu
army.
Others in and out of the administra
tion are skeptical of the CIA figures.
One congressional source familiar with
the intelligence estimates said yesterday.
"My fear is that in the effort to save the
program they will overstate their case
and undermine the truth, which is that
there has been a very substantial
buildup" by the Soviets and Cubans.
