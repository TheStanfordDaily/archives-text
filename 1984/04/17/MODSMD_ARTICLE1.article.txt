# Concert freeze lifted
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer 
A moratorium banning concerts on
campus imposed in August by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and
Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son was lifted Friday.
"The moratorium was instated be
cause the concert system was taking
up too much University administrative
time," according to COP member
Vinnie Freda. The new concert sys
tem, which was recommended by the
Committee on Campus Entertainment
(COCE) to Kennedy and Robinson,
was approved in March but the
moratorium was just lifted last week.
Under the new proposal a Concert
Network would be established to
replace the COCE and to arrange all
rock and jazz concerts brought to
campus. The Concert Network will
consist of a University Concert Advi
sory Committee which will "make
sure the Concert Network follows the
policies outlined in the charter and
abides by the University's rules," said
Derek Passarelli, a member of the ad
visory committee.
One COP member, one ASSU
senator and the ASSU financial
manager will all be part of this com
mittee. The rest of the members of the
committee, also students, will be
nominated by the ASSU nominations
committee, as are all appointees to
University committees.
"We hope to have a staff assembled
by the end of May," Passarelli said.
A concert adviser, who will be a
University administrator, will have the
power to sign contracts and in that
respect will have a veto power, Freda
said. The adviser will be an employee
of Tresidder Union, which requires
the Concert Network to have two
years salary for the adviser in its
reserve funds. Applications are
now being solicited nationwide
for this position.
The interim Concert Network
Board is already planning
events for this summer and next
fall. Frost Amphitheater has been
reserved for a few summer
engagements as well as for two
dates in October. Groups being
considered for these events are
the Tubes, the Cars, Jimmy Buf
fet, the Eurythmics and Huey
Lewis and the News. Memorial
Auditorium would be used for
concerts during the winter when
it is no longer possible to use
Frost.
The Concert Network is one
of the many groups seeking a
Special Fee assessment in the
ASSU elections today and to
morrow.
