## The 						Stanford Daily Contingency confusion 
### 
L.ast week, the ASSU Senate passed a contin
gency funding bill which promises funds to certain
student groups if those groups fail to gain a fee
assessment. This appeared to be a blatant snub of
student opinion, and one graduate senator
seemed to confirm this when he urged the immed
iate passage of the bill, "If the students say 'yes'
to the fee requests then we'll do nothing," he said,
"and if they say 'no,' we'll say 'yes' anyway."
It is unfortunate that one senator's foolish
statement tainted the purpose of what basically
was a well-intended bill. Without any money,
well-organized student groups could not function.
The ASSU's intent is to ensure a group's ability to
survive the year, providing fewer services until it
can ask for a fee assessment again. The ASSU
does not want to ignore the feelings of the stu
dents, but instead to guarantee minimal survival
funding to legitimate groups.
According to the Council of Presidents of the
ASSU, the ASSU's role is to provide funding for
well-organized student groups. Given that pur
pose, the ASSU will give money to most any
group that requests it, including those that are
denied fee assessments by the students.
The mixed signals coming from the ASSU have
created uncertainty over what the fee assessment

elections are actually for. Do the students vote
against a group, or against the fee assessment for
the group? Ballots are only marked "yes" and
"no"; there is no middle-ground option. And
having it known before the election that only
some groups qualify for contingency funding adds
to the confusion.
With the ASSU's decision, students should
realize that they are voting to determine the
degree of funding that some groups will receive,
not on the existence of the groups.
To avoid future confusion and controversy, fee
assessments should be considered as additional
funding to an amount decided upon by the senate
and announced before the election. All groups
would be eligible. Any group which wanted more
money than the senate allots it from the Associa
tion Fee could go for a fee assessment. Since the
group would not lose its portion of the Associa
tion base, there would be no need for arbitrary
contingency fund decisions. Students would only
decide if the group deserves more funding.
This way the senate could continue to keep a
check on student group budgets. Legitimate stu
dent groups would still be provided for by the
ASSU. And most importantly, students for once
will understand exactly what their vote means.
