## Considering SCLC candidates 
### 
1 was disappointed to learn that
The Daily will not be interviewing
candidates for Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) for en
dorsement. 1 was informed that the
large number of candidates for the
ASSU Senate, Council of Presidents

and Senior Class Presidents precluded
consideration of SCLC candidates.
That The Daily considers it insuffi
ciently important to consider SCLC
candidates is a symptom of some
problems of the Honor Code. The
Honor Code is predicated on students

taking responsibility for their own
conduct in course-related activities as
well as the conduct of others. Without
student interest and cooperation, the
Honor Code cannot succeed.
