## ASSU group financing done without bias 
### 
In his viewpoint (Daily, April 11), Robert
Larkins accused the ASSU of being anti-Reagan.
He also accuses various left-of-center campus
groups of actions and positions of which they are
innocent. I would like to answer all of these ques
tions here: And I should note at the outset that I

am not a member of any of these organizations,
and that I am therefore not defending any vested
interest, except, 1 hope, fair play.
Larkins' first volleys were fired at SCAAN
(Stanford Central American Action Network),
"the same group that has organized protests
against the rescue of Grenada and against CIA
recruiting at Stanford." Imagine that — SCAAN
dares to exercise it right of speech on two issues on
which there exists legitimate differences of
opinion! I'm scandalized, too — but not by
SCAAN.
He attacked the DSA (Democratic Socialists of
America) next, because they "openly advocate the
spread of socialism in this country." Well, it's true
that DSA advocates a form of socialism, demo
cratic socialism. But they are hardly the bedfellows
of the KGB, as Larkins accuses. In fact, if the DSA
were in Western Europe, they'd probably be in
power. Some notable democratic socialists in
Europe include Francois Mitterrand and Helmut
Schmidt, both of whom are strong supporters of
NATO, democracy and the West — and who are
strong opponents of communism and the Soviet
Union.
SAC (Stanford Against Conscription) is next on

Larkins' hit list because SAC encourages students
to break the law on draft registration. Actually,
SAC encourages students to make an informed
decision as to whether to break the law or not — a
fine distinction, perhaps, but a legally important
one. And, of course, despite his opinion of SAC, I
trust that Larkins is in favor of informed decision.
His heaviest attack, however, is reserved for
SPA (Stanford Progressive Alliance), the "hub of
the network." SPA's first crime is that it consis
tently shares billing with SCAAN, DSA and SAC.
Yet SPA was conceived as, and has remained, an

alliance of those campus groups which define
themselves as "progressive" in the SPA fashion.
Of course, it shares billing with these groups — it's
only an umbrella organization. Its second sin, in
Larkins' eyes, is the fact that in the Student Direc
tory, the SAC contact and the SPA contact are the
same person. Again, since SPA is an alliance of
these and other groups, it would be very strange
indeed if the SPA contact were not the contact for
some other group.
After denouncing these groups for their alleged
sins, Larkins says the important issue is whether
the Stanford student body should be financing such
groups "openly antagonistic to the system which
makes it possible for all of us to attend this great
university." Aside from the fact that there exist

great universities in other countries, all of which
have at least slightly different systems, Larkins is
under the misimpression that these groups are an
tagonistic to the system in this country.
All these groups see problems in the system,
tnie, and want to improve it — who doesn't? —
but they work within the system to change it. This
work the system encourages, and the ability of the
citizen to express his views in a peaceful manner is
the cornerstone of the system. If these groups were
antagonistic to the system, as Larkins accuses, they
would be acting differently — throwing bombs, as
sasinating people or whatever.
Now, it's true that SAC does implicitly advocate
the violation of one law within the system, but this
position rests on a philosophical and political anal
ysis which is based on the ideals of our great system
itself. It therefore supports its conception of what
the system is all about — which Larkins and others
may well disagree with, but which they should try
to understand, if only to understand the system
better.
All this is not to deny that there is a legitimate
question as to whether or not the ASSU should be
financing political groups of any color. But the
ASSU does not appear to be financing the left to
the exclusion of the right. If the right doesn't get as
much money as the left, that's because the right is
far smaller on campus than the left, and it
presumably meets the needs of fewer students.
ASSU funding, too, is allocated on the basis of the
market system of this country, and not as a part of
any "red conspiracy," despite what Larkins ap
pears to believe.
