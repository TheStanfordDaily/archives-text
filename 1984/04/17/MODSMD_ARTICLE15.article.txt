# Vote Maxwell for senate
## 
### 
Election fever has hit Stanford.
I'm not talking about the Democratic primary, which
has begun to resemble "Family Feud" except that no one
kisses Richard Dawson.
I'm talking about the big one. I'm talking ASSU.
The ASSU has captured the imaginations of students in
a way that national politics haven't been able to. Perhaps
it's because the candidates here are willing to tackle the
real issues — like, "Was I social chairman for the Betas in
1982?" and. "Do we really want someone who used to be
a Dolly as senior class president?"
There seem to be about 20 different slates running for
Council of Presidents. Actually, it's the same four people
who list their names in different order, figuring that no one
is paying that much attention.
The senate race is perhaps the most gripping, with an
overwhelming 23 undergraduates struggling for a mere 20
seats. Students will have to study the candidates closely
before they decide which three not to vote for. All too of
ten this vital choice is made on the basis of superficial
qualities like having silly posters, an ugly sweater or being
social chairman for the Betas.
In the interests of letting Stanfordites cast a more in
formed vote against the candidates of their choice, The
Daily is running this, the first of one article which is an in
terview with one of the more obscure Senate candidates.
Q. What did you say your name was?
H.M. Hubie Maxwell. As in "to the max." Well.
That doesn't sound familiar. Have I seen your flyers?
Well, 1 didn't have any, because of the death squads. I
couldn't take the risk that my campaign workers would be
assaulted by right-wing goons armed with submachine
guns.
And you thought this was a real possibility?
Yeah, plus I ran up a huge bill at Kinkos last fall when 1
had all my roommates Western Culture books Xeroxed.
But it's the death squads too.
And you're on the ballot for ASSU Senate?
Well, no. My petitions were disqualified because of a
technicality.
What was that?
They had been signed again and again by me. It was an
honest mistake.
So you're hoping, for a write-in vote?
Many of my supporters are pre-meds, Jim; they can't
write. But I've instructed the ASSU that if any of the bal
lots have illegible scrawls or marks on them, those votes
are tor me. Of course, I want people who can write to sup
port me too.
Why should people vote for Hubie Maxwell?
I'm the "new ideas" candidate.
What ideas are those?
If I had them now, they'd be old by the time I took of
fice. But I promise I'll think about them a lot when I'm
home this summer.

What are your stands on the issues? For example, what
about a shuttle to San Francisco on the weekends?
I don't think that's feasible. I mean, they need those
things to pick up satellites and stuff— I don't think they'd
let us use them to go to San Francisco when we can take
the bus.
What do you think of photo I.D.s?
I'm concerned with the possibility of photography steal
ing people's souls, as some fundamentalist groups have

The ASSU has captured the imagina
tions of students in a way that na
tional politics haven't been able to.
Perhaps it's because candidates here
are willing to tackle the real issues -
like, "Was I social chairman for the
Betas in 1982?" and\ "Do we really
want someone who used to be a
Dolly as senior class president?"

charged. Some say this is unlikely, hut there was a photog
rapher at my senior prom, and I had an awful time.
Do you advocate any major changes in the Food Service
system?
I'd like students to be given a Maoist option — they
would be given as much food as they could eat as long as
they spend their unguaranteed year working in a rice field.
Do you think you could reorganize the ASSU to make it
more efficient?
An efficient bureaucracy is a dangerous thing. Look at
Stalin, he was efficient. I think you have to face the possi
bility that if the ASSU gets its act together, in a year's time
we'll have 20 million dead kulaks on our hands.
What are your qualifications for office?
I have never been social chairman for the Betas.
Is that all?
No, I also have never been a Dolly, and I am not a mem
ber of the Big Way Yacht Club.
But are you responsible? Experienced? Diverse? All the
other candidates are.
No, I'm none of those things. Basically, I'm confused. 1
think'this puts me in closer touch with most students' atti
tude about the ASSU.

write. But I've instructed the ASSU that if any of the bal
lots have illegible scrawls or marks on them, those votes
are tor me. Of course, I want people who can write to sup
port me too.
Why should people vote for Hubie Maxwell?
I'm the "new ideas" candidate.
What ideas are those?
If I had them now, they'd be old by the time I took of
fice. But I promise I'll think about them a lot when I'm
home this summer.

What are your stands on the issues? For example, what
about a shuttle to San Francisco on the weekends?
I don't think that's feasible. I mean, they need those
things to pick up satellites and stuff— I don't think they'd
let us use them to go to San Francisco when we can take
the bus.
What do you think of photo I.D.s?
I'm concerned with the possibility of photography steal
ing people's souls, as some fundamentalist groups have

The ASSU has captured the imagina
tions of students in a way that na
tional politics haven't been able to.
Perhaps it's because candidates here
are willing to tackle the real issues -
like, "Was I social chairman for the
Betas in 1982?" and\ "Do we really
want someone who used to be a
Dolly as senior class president?"

charged. Some say this is unlikely, hut there was a photog
rapher at my senior prom, and I had an awful time.
Do you advocate any major changes in the Food Service
system?
I'd like students to be given a Maoist option — they
would be given as much food as they could eat as long as
they spend their unguaranteed year working in a rice field.
Do you think you could reorganize the ASSU to make it
more efficient?
An efficient bureaucracy is a dangerous thing. Look at
Stalin, he was efficient. I think you have to face the possi
bility that if the ASSU gets its act together, in a year's time
we'll have 20 million dead kulaks on our hands.
What are your qualifications for office?
I have never been social chairman for the Betas.
Is that all?
No, I also have never been a Dolly, and I am not a mem
ber of the Big Way Yacht Club.
But are you responsible? Experienced? Diverse? All the
other candidates are.
No, I'm none of those things. Basically, I'm confused. 1
think'this puts me in closer touch with most students' atti
tude about the ASSU.
