# 'Life Flight' service takes off on May 1
## 
### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
The Peninsula's first helicopter
emergency transport system, capable
of treating victims during flight, will
begin next month under the joint au
thority of Stanford University Hospi
tal and the Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center (SCVMC).
The airborne emergency ward will
go into operation May 1. Test flights
are currently being held to train the
crew.
The helicopter will transport victims
to helipad-equipped hospitals, most
likely to one of the two hospitals pro
viding the sen ice.
The aim of the "Life Flight" system,
as it is known at 21 other hospitals
nationwide which have related pro
grams, is to cut down on the time it
takes to begin treating a victim who
needs immediate care.
Care given by paramedics at the
scene of an accident will be supple
mented by the helicopter's services,
according to Barbara Behrens of Stan
ford Hospital's Emergency Depart
ment.
"We're all absolutely thrilled, she
said.
"There won't be any cutbacks on
the ground, in the hospital s emer
gency wards. . . . The care lor the pa
tient will just start sooner, she said.
One of the premier advantages of
the helicopter over conventional auto
mobile ambulances is the speed with
which it can reach the site ot an acci
dent, as well as in cases ot a traffic jam
or a very remote spot where a conven

tional ambulance cannot reach the vic
tims at all. The helicopter flies at a
speed of approximately 140 miles an
hour, while a ground vehicle must deal
with speed limits and traffic.
One area cited as a problem is Pa
checo Pass, a stretch of highway south
east of San Jose. Officials of the proj
ect have said they believe the helicop
ter will cut down in response time to
this and other sites.
The hospitals are emphasizing the
helicopter will be used in conjunction
with, and not instead of, traditional
means of assisting a victim in need of
help.
The hospitals will take turns
housing the helicopter which will be
staffed by the current host medical
center. The doctors are professionals,
not students, all with some experience
in similar medical procedures, and the
nurses are members of the' National
Flight Nurses Association, recruited
through nationwide advertising, Beh
rens said.
Landing pads have been installed at
both hospitals, but the helicopter will
be based at Stanford 75 percent of the
time. "This arrangement keeps us
from duplicating equipment and
work." Behrens said.
The University has not divulged the
cost of the operation or what
percentage each hospital will pay.
The area served by the helicopter
will be a 150-mile radius around the
SCVMC and Stanford, although if
called upon the helicopter would go as
far away as Marin County, Behrens
said.
