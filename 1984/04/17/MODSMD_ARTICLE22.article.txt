## 'The Legends of Football-Stanford Style' announced 
### BETH KLEID Daily staff 
Alter five weeks of intensive
practice, spring football will
come to a close on the I arm on
May 5. And Head Coach Jack
Elway's crew will go out in style.
Stanford stvle. that is.
Yesterday at Hyatt Rickey's
in Palo Alto, a football game
entitled "The Legends ot toot
ball â€” Stanford Stvl9" was an
nounced. Stanford alumni will
return to the Farm to compete
against the present varsity squad
in the Stanford Stadium.
The last alumni-varsity game
was held eight years ago, and
the varsity squad won. Elway
offers no predictions as to who
he thinks will w in this game, but
he does predict that good things
will come out of it.
"There is a lot of excitement
over this," he said. "It will be a
great final for our spring ball."
According to Elway, the
event will be an opportunity for
the alums to talk about old
times and swap stories, while it
will generate enthusiasm for the
coming football season.
The alumni game, born by El
way and supported wholeheart
edly by Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, has attracted 92 ex-
Cardinal to date. "And I know
that the list is is going to grow,"
said Elway.
The alumni players who have
committed themselves include
1972 Rose Bowl quarterback
Don Bunce, quarterbacks Mike
Boryla and Mike Cordova, tight
end Boh Moore and linebackers
Chuck Evans and Gordy
Ceresino.
Evans, who played on the
Farm from 1976-1979, said that
he hopes the game will help to
get the community involved in
the football season. "We hope
that this will get things rolling
on the right track."
Evans is pleased with the
response to the game. "The
response we've had from former
players has been tremendous,
and the support we've had from
the Athletic Department has
been unbelievable."
Evans is also looking forward

to seeing some of his old
buddies back in their cardinal
and-white uniforms.
Los Angeles Raiders quarter
back Jim Plunkett. who played
for the Cardinal in 1968-1970.
is looking forward to seeing it
his old friends w ill be able to get
back into their duds. "We'll
have to see if some of the guys
lit into their old uniforms," he
said.
Plunkett will be joined by
other NI L stars on the alumni
roster, but the current NFL
players will not be allowed to
play in the actual game. They
will participate in the e\ent by
stay ing on the sidelines and sign
ing autographs at a special ses
sion after the game.
According to Plunkett, the
game w ill be a perfect opportu
nity tii get Elway's football pro
gram off to a good start. He is
optimistic about the Cardinal,
and said that "without question
I think that the program will im
prove tremendously."
The quarterback remembers
the last alum-student athlete
game as "a lot of fun," but this
year's game has larger goals
than just providing a good time
for those involved. Plunkett
noted that interest in the game
could set the tone for the fall
season.
"Hopefully this game will get
people's interest in Stanford's
program underway early in the
spring," he said. "It might get
a lot of fans involved in watch
ing some of the spring practices,
which not many people do. An
alumni game has been been
good for a lot of schools."
An alumni game is good for
a lot of reasons, but Denver
Broncos quarterback and ex-
Stanford star John Elway has
less serious reasons in mind. "1
think the main reason I'm
looking forward to this is be
cause it'll be the first time I'll
get to tailgate before a Stanford
game," Elway said with a
chuckle.
The young Elway anticipates
a fun weekend, but he does
realize the importance of the
game to the Stanford program.

For the quarterback, the game
will show the public that tradi
tion is valued on the Faim.
"It will show how steeped in
tradition Stanford football is,
and if it goes well this year it can
really help start a great tradi
tion," he said. Elway said that
he has no advice to give his fa
ther on coaching his old team,
but his father jokingly said,
"You're being nice John, you
just don't want to go public."
The elder Elway may need
some advice, as he is not only
facing a star-studded team, he is
facing an illustrious coaching
staff. The alumni team will be

Co-coached by Chuck Taylor
and Bill Walsh. Taylor is a
former player, football coach
and athletic director at Stan
ford. He was involved in three
Rose Bowls, and was recently
elected to the College Football
Hall of Fame.
Walsh, who was head coach
here in 1977-1978, is now the
coach of the San Fransisco
49ers. He led the 49ers to the
Super Bowl in 1952 and he led
the Cardinal to victories in the
1977 Sun Bowl and the 1978
Bluebonnet Bowl.
"I'm not looking forward to
coaching against Bill Walsh,"
said Elway.

But Elway is looking forward
to the interchange between the
varsity and the alumni. "I think
the interchange will contribute
to us having a successful fall,
and the varsity is really excited
about meeting the players who
have played here in the past."
Elway also joked that he
wants to see if the alums are in
as good shape as he is.
After the game a reception
will be held for the participants,
and along with the lighthearted
attitude toward the May 5 con
test, Elway laughed, "I'll go to
it, but I won't drive back home
to San Jose afterwards."
