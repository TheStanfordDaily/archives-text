# Card netmen battle with Spartans on the Farm
## 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
After tough losses against USC and UCLA this
past weekend, the Stanford men's tennis team will
try to bounce back against the San Jose State
Spartans today on the Varsity Courts . The Car
dinal needs this match to restore its confidence
before it meets the Trojans and Bruins again this
weekend. In Los Angeles, the team won half of
the singles matches against both USC and UCLA,
but lost all six of the doubles matches. Coach Dick
Gould indicated that he could possibly alter his
doubles lineup.
"We might make some changes in our No. 2 or
No. 3 doubles teams," Gould said. His No. 1 pair
of Jim Grabb and John Letts played in extremely
close matches, especially against USC's team,
which is No. 1 in the country, losing by only a few
points 7-6, 6-4, 7-5.
Last year, Stanford had a strong doubles team.
Gould indicated that the loss of Scott Davis, who
turned pro, had a tremendous impact on the team.
"We have the same team as last year, but we
lost Scott Davis who has become the No. 22
player in the world. He is an outstanding doubles
player and his mere presence on the court had a
big impact," he said.

The inexperience of freshman Derrick Ros
tagno is another factor that caused Gould to re
think his doubles combinations. Rostagno did not
play doubles last year in high school as extensively
as other Cardinal players. Also, Gould indicated
that he has been injured for much of the season
and is still not at his best level of performance.
Gould is pleased to have a match with San Jose
State before going against the L.A. schools again.
"I think having a match will make us concentrate
and keep our mind on tennis. Sometimes when
you have an important match, you become too
wrapped up in the match itself and you begin to
lose sight of what you're doing. The one thing 1
don't what is a let-up," he said.
Today's match against the Spartans is scheduled
to begin at 1:30 p.m. at the Varsity Courts.
After today's match the Card will focus on pre
paring itself for the weekend. The match against
the Bruins will begin at noon on Friday. Satur
day's match against the Trojans will also begin at
noon, with five singles and one doubles match
played outdoors, and the remaining matches
played at 6:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.

Mark McKeen is looking up to the singles competition today when Stanford hosts San Jose
State University. However, he and the rest of the Card men's tennis team are more likely
concerned with a doubles lineup that dropped six-of-six matches to UCLA and USC over the
weekend.
