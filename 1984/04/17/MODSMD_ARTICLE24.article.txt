# Burgin is back for the Card
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's
tennis team hosts Cal State
Lon t > Beach today in a
WCAA match, and the Car
dinal is going into the contest
with a couple pieces of good
news.
The first is that senior
Elise Burgin, the Cardinal's
top player, will return to ac
tion this afternoon. At a
press conference yesterday.
Head Coach Frank Brennan
disclosed that Burgin would
play doubles with Linda
Gates, her partner last year.
The pair finished second at
the NCAA Championships
last season.
Burgin has missed all of
Stanford's matches this year
due to a back injury. Doctors
believe that the injury was
caused by the constant
pounding of hard courts and
not by one single incident.
Burgin was in traction and
has taken the past several
months off to recuperate.
Burgin's return should
help an already strong Stan
ford squad. She was ranked
No. 2 in the pre-season poll
in both singles and doubles.
Brennan, however, plans
only to use her in the
doubles, thinking that
playing two matches may be
too much to ask at this stage.
Brennan thinks that Bur
gin is ready to come back. If
she plays for us, she'll help,"
he said. "It's just a question
of 'can she get it all to
gether?' "
Gates had previously been
playing at third doubles with
freshman Stephanie Savides,
and the pair is ranked No. 9
in the nation in the latest
poll. .
The second bit of good

news for Stanford was
UCLA's 5-4 victory over
Trinity in Texas. Trinity had
taken over the No. 1 spot in
the team, poll from Stanford
last week despite Stanford's
perfect 18-0 record. The
Cardinal had occupied the
top spot all season. It ap
pears, barring a very slanted
vote or an upset, that the
Cardinal will be back on top
in the next poll.

Brennan is not overly con
cerned about today's ma,tch
with Long Beach. "They're
about medium," he said.
"We're looking forward to
some routine matches. My
doctor says it's good for my
heart to have these matches
every once in a while."
Brennan will in all
likelihood go with his usual
ladder — Putty Fendick,
Gates, Kate Gompert, Leigh

Anne Eldredge, Michelle
Weiss, and Savides — in the
singles. Fendick and
Eldredge, along with Gom
pert and Weiss should he the
other doubles teams.
Today's match begins at
l:30 p.m. at the Varsity Ten
nis Courts. The netters' next
match is Thursday, when
IJC-Santa Barbara visits the
Farm.

Elise Burgin, one of the Cardinal's top players, will play in her first match this season
against Cal State Long Beach on the Varsity Courts today. Burgin, who was slotted in first
singles for all of last year, is returning from a back injury that doctors said was caused by
the constant pounding exerted during her many years of playing.
