## 'Hotel N.H.' accomplished but disastrous, no surprises 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The bestselling "The World
According to Garp" had fresh
ness and verve, but one John Ir
ving novel may be all a reader
can stand. I felt that "The Hotel
New Hampshire" was super
fluous after "Garp," not only
because of the reiterated motifs

(hears, jogging), settings
(private hoys schools, Vienna),
character types (whores, radi
cals, coaches, writers) and
literary conceits ("the Under
toad," the book's euphemism
for creeping disaster, is replaced
by Sorrow, the Berry family's
emblematic dead dog in "The
Hotel New Hampshire"), but
also because once you've
figured out John Irving's system
there are no surprises.
Nothing exists for its own
sweet sake in Irving; everything
that occurs presages or parallels
a later event, and innocent
pranks inevitably lead to major

tragedies. I hated reading "The
Hotel New Hampshire" because
I knew that my worst fears for
the characters were all hound to
come true — that when the mo
ther told her son, who had just
stuffed the deceased dog as a
family treat, that she didn't find
dead things amusing, she herself

would be dead within a chapter.
Irving sees life as a tragic bur
lesque in which the most gifted
players speak in resonant
ironies and startling philosophi
cal phrases, but after one-fourth
of his 400-page novel 1 longed
for a few unconscious characters
who didn't say things like
"We're all screwed down for
life" and "Keep passing the
open windows" and "Sorrow
floats" and "It's all a fairy tale"
over and'over, like a demented
chorus.
The film version of "The
Hotel New Hampshire" is a
serious endeavor with a group

of very talented actors — Beau
Bridges, Jodie Foster, Nastassja
Kinski, Wallace Shawn, Wilford
Brimley, Dorsey Wright,
Amanda Plummer, etc. —
struggling to convey Irving's vi
sion and the meaning of his text.
It's also a fiasco, though not a
laughable one. Merely attempt-

ing to film a book which is ull
motifs may well have been folly;
certainly the project was
doomed when the director,
Tony Richardson, came up with
a screenplay with almost noth
ing left out. Did he think he was
adapting "King Lear" or
"Waiting for Godot," and
therefore had no right to edit it?
And since he compressed 400
pages into a two-hour movie, if
you blink or stop listening for a
moment you're liable to miss a
character's motivation or the
logic behind a whole chain of
events. The action rushes by so
fast that it becomes meaning

less.
For example, the opening
flashback, in the form of the
story the father (Beau Bridges)
tells his children about courting
their mother (Lisa Banes), con
tains the first hotel in the compli
cated story, the first bear, our
first encounter with the bizarre

German Jew named Freud
(Wallace Shawn) — not Sig
mund Freud (though Irving
wants us to think of both Freuds
all the time) — but it takes up so
little screen time that it barely
makes an impression. At the
end of it. Beau Bridges cradles a
dead bear in his arms and cries,
and we don't understand why;
it's impossible to get emotion
ally caught up in a precis.
The book is weirdly detailed,
but in the movie the details
elude our comprehension, and
there isn't a thing most of the
actors can do to clarify what we
see. Watching this picture, I had

the sense I sometimes have in
fassbinder's movies that the ac
tors were all part of a meticu
lous collaborative network, that
if you interviewed any of them
he would he able to articulate
the significance of each individ
ual moment, but that through
some peculiar communication
breakdown we in the audience
failed to make any connection
with them.
Aside from Wallace Shawn,
no one in the movie acts atro
ciously, but only a couple of the
performers (Jodie Foster, Wil
i'ord Brimley) are actually good
and only one (Amanda Plum
mer, in a bit part) is memorable.
Or rather, they're all
memorable in the wrong ways
— you associate them with the
peculiar physical affectations Ir
ving has supplied each charac
ter, not with anything they've
created as actors. So we think of
Nastassja Kinski in her bear
suit, Beau Bridges with his
baseball bat, Rob Lowe in his
running shorts and undershirt,
Jennie Dundas in clothes much
too old-looking for her and so
on.
I haven't attempted to sum
marize the plot of The Hotel
New Hampshire here because it
is extremely complicated and, I
think, explains nothing. It con
tains a heart attack, a rape, a
stroke, a plane crash, a murder,
a bomb explosion and a suicide;
two characters go blind and one
doesn't grow; one character is
homosexual, one is lesbian, and
one — the rape victim — sleeps
with the lesbian, a sadistic por
nographer and her own brother
before returning to her devoted
childhood suitor.
Irving undoubtedly believes
that his focus on important is
sues like rape, incest, sexuality
and death indicates profundity,
and that his flaky tone makes all

the brutality bearable, but for
those of us unwilling to go along
with this assessment, his book
— and Richardson's dutiful
movie — may just seem crccpy
and unpleasant. We might also
ask ourselves why this cele
brated author, honored by Ms.
Magazine, insists on portraying
women as whores or sexually
crippled individuals whose psy
chic damage is mysteriously
repaired when they sleep with
the hero (Rob Lowe), whose
name is John and who also
serves as first-person narrator.
The only exceptions to this role
are John's sister Lilly (Jennie
Dundas), who remains physi
cally a little girl all her life, and
his mother, who is more or less a
specter even before the plot kills
her off.
The photographer, David
Watkin, varies the lighting
dramatically according to the
setting — the New Hampshire
scenes have a creamy soft focus

look (like Yentl, his last tilm,
did) and Vierfria has a hard,
decrepit surface. It's very ac
complished work. And Richard
son carries off some sequences
— like the suicide and the fairy
tale resurrection finale — grace
fully and elegantly.
None of this matters, though,
just as Jodie Foster's consis
tently intelligent leading perfor
mance doesn't matter. Perhaps
only Amanda Plummer's pas
sionate few minutes on screen
matter, because they don't illus
trate the sacred text. When
Plummer. playing a radical who
cherishes American literature
despite its alleged decadence,
hides a copy ot "•The Great
Gatsby" in her blouse or when,
having made love for the first
time, she asks her lover sadly,
"Is that all?," the movie sheds
John Irving's pseudo
profundities and acquires a
human dimension. But all too
briefly.

"Waiting for Godot," and
therefore had no right to edit it?
And since he compressed 400
pages into a two-hour movie, if
you blink or stop listening for a
moment you're liable to miss a
character's motivation or the
logic behind a whole chain of
events. The action rushes by so
fast that it becomes meaning

less.
For example, the opening
flashback, in the form of the
story the father (Beau Bridges)
tells his children about courting
their mother (Lisa Banes), con
tains the first hotel in the compli
cated story, the first bear, our
first encounter with the bizarre

German Jew named Freud
(Wallace Shawn) — not Sig
mund Freud (though Irving
wants us to think of both Freuds
all the time) — but it takes up so
little screen time that it barely
makes an impression. At the
end of it. Beau Bridges cradles a
dead bear in his arms and cries,
and we don't understand why;
it's impossible to get emotion
ally caught up in a precis.
The book is weirdly detailed,
but in the movie the details
elude our comprehension, and
there isn't a thing most of the
actors can do to clarify what we
see. Watching this picture, I had

the sense I sometimes have in
fassbinder's movies that the ac
tors were all part of a meticu
lous collaborative network, that
if you interviewed any of them
he would he able to articulate
the significance of each individ
ual moment, but that through
some peculiar communication
breakdown we in the audience
failed to make any connection
with them.
Aside from Wallace Shawn,
no one in the movie acts atro
ciously, but only a couple of the
performers (Jodie Foster, Wil
i'ord Brimley) are actually good
and only one (Amanda Plum
mer, in a bit part) is memorable.
Or rather, they're all
memorable in the wrong ways
— you associate them with the
peculiar physical affectations Ir
ving has supplied each charac
ter, not with anything they've
created as actors. So we think of
Nastassja Kinski in her bear
suit, Beau Bridges with his
baseball bat, Rob Lowe in his
running shorts and undershirt,
Jennie Dundas in clothes much
too old-looking for her and so
on.
I haven't attempted to sum
marize the plot of The Hotel
New Hampshire here because it
is extremely complicated and, I
think, explains nothing. It con
tains a heart attack, a rape, a
stroke, a plane crash, a murder,
a bomb explosion and a suicide;
two characters go blind and one
doesn't grow; one character is
homosexual, one is lesbian, and
one — the rape victim — sleeps
with the lesbian, a sadistic por
nographer and her own brother
before returning to her devoted
childhood suitor.
Irving undoubtedly believes
that his focus on important is
sues like rape, incest, sexuality
and death indicates profundity,
and that his flaky tone makes all

the brutality bearable, but for
those of us unwilling to go along
with this assessment, his book
— and Richardson's dutiful
movie — may just seem crccpy
and unpleasant. We might also
ask ourselves why this cele
brated author, honored by Ms.
Magazine, insists on portraying
women as whores or sexually
crippled individuals whose psy
chic damage is mysteriously
repaired when they sleep with
the hero (Rob Lowe), whose
name is John and who also
serves as first-person narrator.
The only exceptions to this role
are John's sister Lilly (Jennie
Dundas), who remains physi
cally a little girl all her life, and
his mother, who is more or less a
specter even before the plot kills
her off.
The photographer, David
Watkin, varies the lighting
dramatically according to the
setting — the New Hampshire
scenes have a creamy soft focus

look (like Yentl, his last tilm,
did) and Vierfria has a hard,
decrepit surface. It's very ac
complished work. And Richard
son carries off some sequences
— like the suicide and the fairy
tale resurrection finale — grace
fully and elegantly.
None of this matters, though,
just as Jodie Foster's consis
tently intelligent leading perfor
mance doesn't matter. Perhaps
only Amanda Plummer's pas
sionate few minutes on screen
matter, because they don't illus
trate the sacred text. When
Plummer. playing a radical who
cherishes American literature
despite its alleged decadence,
hides a copy ot "•The Great
Gatsby" in her blouse or when,
having made love for the first
time, she asks her lover sadly,
"Is that all?," the movie sheds
John Irving's pseudo
profundities and acquires a
human dimension. But all too
briefly.


The saga of the eccentric Berry family: Paul McCrane and Jodie Foster with Beau Bridges in a family discussion.
The bestselling "The World
According to Garp" had fresh
ness and verve, but one John Ir
ving novel may be all a reader
can stand. I felt that "The Hotel
New Hampshire" was super
fluous after "Garp," not only
because of the reiterated motifs

(hears, jogging), settings
(private hoys schools, Vienna),
character types (whores, radi
cals, coaches, writers) and
literary conceits ("the Under
toad," the book's euphemism
for creeping disaster, is replaced
by Sorrow, the Berry family's
emblematic dead dog in "The
Hotel New Hampshire"), but
also because once you've
figured out John Irving's system
there are no surprises.
Nothing exists for its own
sweet sake in Irving; everything
that occurs presages or parallels
a later event, and innocent
pranks inevitably lead to major

tragedies. I hated reading "The
Hotel New Hampshire" because
I knew that my worst fears for
the characters were all hound to
come true — that when the mo
ther told her son, who had just
stuffed the deceased dog as a
family treat, that she didn't find
dead things amusing, she herself

would be dead within a chapter.
Irving sees life as a tragic bur
lesque in which the most gifted
players speak in resonant
ironies and startling philosophi
cal phrases, but after one-fourth
of his 400-page novel 1 longed
for a few unconscious characters
who didn't say things like
"We're all screwed down for
life" and "Keep passing the
open windows" and "Sorrow
floats" and "It's all a fairy tale"
over and'over, like a demented
chorus.
The film version of "The
Hotel New Hampshire" is a
serious endeavor with a group

of very talented actors — Beau
Bridges, Jodie Foster, Nastassja
Kinski, Wallace Shawn, Wilford
Brimley, Dorsey Wright,
Amanda Plummer, etc. —
struggling to convey Irving's vi
sion and the meaning of his text.
It's also a fiasco, though not a
laughable one. Merely attempt-

ing to film a book which is ull
motifs may well have been folly;
certainly the project was
doomed when the director,
Tony Richardson, came up with
a screenplay with almost noth
ing left out. Did he think he was
adapting "King Lear" or
"Waiting for Godot," and
therefore had no right to edit it?
