San Francisco — Former Secretary of State and Na
tional Security Adviser Henry Kissinger predicted
"significant" U.S.-Soviet negotiations in the next 12 to
15 months and called for a national consensus on
Central American policy before 2000 California Com
monwealth Club members and guests yesterday at the
San Francisco Hilton.
Hecklers interrupted Kissinger twice, calling him "a
Soviet agent of influence," while about 500
demonstrators outside the hotel protested U.S. involve
ment in Latin America and the threat of nuclear war.
"You want the U.S. thrown out of Central America
the same way you got the U.S. thrown out of Vietnam

. . . Are you a Soviet agent of influence?" one well
dressed woman demanded while being hurried out of
the room by a burly man.
"Few people can unify the American people like I
can," Kissinger chuckled. "I have a great constituency
among the nuts on the left and I have an equally pas
sionate constituency among the nuts on the right."
The structure of the Soviet leadership and the state
of the Soviet economy will "bring about the necessity of
negotiations," Kissinger said. In most modern states
obedience goes to the office, but in the Soviet system, it
goes to the person, he said.

nenko and other Politburo
members — are all in their
middle 70s, Kissinger said, "it is
highly probable that significant
changes in the top Soviet lead
ership over the next live years
are inevitable."
While "that does not mean
they will come forward with
very grand schemes, it does
mean that they will not want a
prolonged atmosphere of
crisis," Kissinger said.
Kissinger also believes the
state of the Soviet economy will
prompt a "relaxation of tensions
on the part of the Soviets."
"You cannot run a modern
economy by total planning, but
at the same time \ou may not be
able to run a communist state
without total planning." he said.
The greatest danger of war is
that the Soviets "might attempt
to clean up the external envi
ronment before they turn to
domestic reform." If the United
States can prevent this — "if we
can contain Soviet expan
sionism" — Kissinger believes
negotiations are inevitable.
Once we enter arms control
negotiations, "A great deal
depends on our own attitudes.
"If the Soviets think that
America gets extremely restless
and frightened — that they can
panic us into unilateral conces
sions — then there will be no
progress," he said.
Regarding Central America,
Kissinger acknowledged that
the original causes of turmoil
were "undoubtedly not caused
originally by Moscow or
Havana."
