# Lobby drive to use today's voting lists
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Lobby Office, in con
junction with four other groups
seeking fee assessments in ASSU
elections, will have access to the
names of today's voters to aid in its
lobbying activities.
Only students who vote in the
elections are eligible for refunds.
Voting receipts are therefore recorded
as a means of validating refund claims,
according to elections commissioner
Phil Halperin.
But this year those records will be
available to groups who gave "prior
written notification" to Halperin
before last night in accord with the
bulletin posted 10 days ago in his of
fice. "The Lobby Office has taken
control of the whole thing and applied
under the auspices of several groups,"
Halperin said. Those groups include
The Women's Center, the Black Stu
dent Union and the Stanford Progres
sive Alliance. ,
According to Mark Barham of the
Lobby Office, all the groups "agreed
to cooperate to go through the lists to
gether" and the Lobby Office is
working with and not for the other
groups.
The Lobby Office has a list of ap
proximately 1500 people who are ac
tive in the groups it represents and
who it plans to call and encourage to
vote. Under the new system it will be
able to check off those who have
already voted and limit the number of
phone calls it needs to make before
the last day of balloting tomorrow.
The controversial measure, which
was debated at length in the ASSU
Senate in February, was supposed to
go into practice last year but never
did. Halperin's interpretation of the
bylaws allowed for use of the records
by student groups, but senate approval
was needed for confirmation.
"The bylaws say that before the

election is completely over no tally can
be released . . . but it wasn't clear
whether "tally' meant the number of
votes received or the number of votes
cast," said Jug Jagadish, senate chair.
The senate decision to interpret
tally as only the number of votes
received confirmed Halperin's inter
pretation. "I don't think there's any
thing wrong with it," Halperin said.
And Barham agreed. "Think about
the normal election process. Groups
are given access to the role of voters.

We are not looking at people's votes
to see how they voted. It's a basic part
of the democratic process. It happens
all over the country," he said.
But others disagree. "It can be seen
as an invasion of privacy. Students
have enough campaigning without
people calling them on the phone,"
said ASSU senator Mark Fleischauer,
who voted against the measure. "It
would be bothering students unneces
sarily," he added.
The task of the lobbying groups may
be - even tougher due to an expected
increase in voter turnout. "We expect
more people to vote due to the in
creased publicity about the need to
vote in order to get fee assessments
back," Halperin said.
To accommodate more voters, poll
hours have been expanded particu
larly at the Graduate School of Busi
ness and at the Medical School. There
is also a new polling site near Meyer
Library which will be called Meyer
East.

Last year's elections cost ap
proximately $12,000 and this
year's expenses are only slightlv
increased due to increased
publicity, a bigger voter's hand
book. and the large number of
candidates. There are I 7 groups
seeking fee assessments. 25 un
dergraduate senatorial candi
dates and eight graduate candi
dates. 1 1 senior class president
slates and two slates seeking the
Council of Presidents. The
Hammer and Coffin Slate
withdrew last night. Halperin
said.
