# Two sophomores win Truman awards
## 
### 
A pair of Stanford sophomores, spurred by an
interest in public service, have joined 103 other
U.S. college students recently selected to receive
the 1984 Truman Scholarship.
Susan Rice and Kirsten Swinth will receive an
annual maximum stipend of $5000 for the last two
years of college and two years of graduate study.
The University nominates two nominees per year
for the prestigious award, which has been garnered
by Stanford students eight times in the past four
years.
The news made Swinth 'very happy, honored,
excited and relieved." Rice said she is •'really
glad." adding. "It's something to look forward to
and something to help with tuition."
The selection process started in October with
appointed faculty representatives of more than
1900 colleges and universities who interviewed
candidates for consideration. A total of 952
nominations were received.
Regional panels composed of civic, business and
academic leaders screened and reviewed the
nominations, interviewed candidates and submit

ted their recommendations to a national board of
trustees.
A citizen of the District of Columbia. Rice said
her four years of summer work on Capitol Hill
helped make her feel more comfortable during her
regional interview, which was conducted in Wash
ington, D.C.
"Prof. (Hubert) Marshall sort of prepared me
for the possibility that the regional interview would
be stressful, but the whole process was relaxed,"
she said.
Margaret Truman Daniel, daughter of the late
President Harry S. Truman, will present the schol
arships to the recipients at a ceremony next month
in the Truman Library in Independence. Mo.
The scholarship was established by an act of
Congress in tribute to the nation's 33rd president.
Eligibility is extended to students in all 50 states,
the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In addi
tion. Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa
and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands are
considered as a single entity .
Rice, a tutor for freshman history classes and a

volunteer at the Mid-Peninsula Support Network,
said receiving the nomination from Stanford was
perhaps the most difficult step in securing the
award.
Swinth, a Montana resident, concurred. "I was
most anxious about the elimination from the two
nominees from Stanford," she said. A member of
the Arms Control and Disarmament Forum,
Swinth plans to study at Israel's Haifa University
next year.
To be considered for nomination as a Truman
Scholar, a student must have selected an under
graduate field of study that will permit admission
to a graduate program leading to a career in gov
ernment service.
The program, now in its eighth year and ad
ministered by a national foundation, makes one
new scholarship available annually to a qualified
student from each state and the other areas. In ad
dition, the board of trustees authorizes each of the
13 regional review panels to recommend up to four
additional students for consideration as scholars
at-large.


Stanford University Hospital and Santa Clara Valley Medical Center
will launch a new 'Life Flight' ambulance service which will serve the

Jill Gilbert/Daily
Bay Area starting in May. The helicopter will greatly reduce the time it
takes to transport patients needing immediate hospital care.
