Reagan sends Bush to meeting
with chemical weapons plan
Washington — President Reagan yesterday sent Vice Presi
dent George Bush to the 40-nation U.N. Conference on Dis
armament in Geneva with the administration's new proposal
for a treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide.
With U. S.-Soviet nuclear missile talks now stalled, Reagan
said the Bush mission is 'extremely vital ... in the cause of
peace" and urged the vice president to press hard for accep
tance.
"I'll sure try," said Bush, who was to depart last night and
present the treaty tomorrow.
There is already an international agreement that the
United States, Soviet Union and most other countries have
signed renouncing the first use of such weapons. The pro
posed new treaty would prohibit their production and stock
piling as well. It also contains new verification procedures
that could be an obstacle to agreement with the Soviets.
Yesterday, in Moscow, the official Soviet newspaper lzves
tia said the treaty draft is accompanied by "patently unaccep
table convictions."
Reagan, for his part, said "we know this won't be easy to
achieve," but added that the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and
other efforts to control chemical weapons "lacked effective
compliance provisions."
"Chemical weapons provide a sad example ... of past arms
control failures," he said.
Soviet planes near Afghanistan
Washington —The Soviet Union has stationed about three
dozen medium-range bombers at airfields near its border with
Afghanistan, presaging a possible new phase in the war
against Afghan guerrillas, administration officials said yester
day.
U.S. officials cautioned that they are uncertain about the
significance of last week's deployments, which included 36
Tul6 Badger bombers and about 100 lighter bombers and
ground attack planes. The movement could be intended as a
signal to Pakistan or connected to events in the Iran-Iraq war,
since the Persian Gulf is within the 1200-mile range of the
Badgers.
But the officials said they believe the deployment of the
planes, accompanied by support aircraft and large amounts of
munitions, indicates the Soviets may be planning large-scale
aerial bombing as part of their expected spring offensive in
Afghanistan. Helicopter gunships have been used extensively
in the war, but until now the Soviets have not engaged in the
kind of high-altitude, widespread bombing that the United
States used in Vietnam in an effort to demoralize the enemy.
U.S. to maintain role in Angola
Johannesburg, South Africa — The United States will con
tinue to participate in the monitoring of the disengagement of
military forces in the Angola-Namibia border region despite
the deaths of two U.S. officials in an apparent terrorist bom
bing in the area. U.S. Ambassador Herman Nickel said yes
terday.
Diplomat Dennis Keogh and Army Lt. Col. Kenneth
Crabtree were killed Sunday. They were the ranking State
and Defense department representatives on the U.S. liaison
team based in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia (South-West
Africa).
Nickel said, "The United States is committed lo bring
about pence in southern Africa. The liaison office is part of
that effort. It will not be brought to:in end through continued
violence."
He added. "The tragic death of the U.S. representatives in
Namibia does not diminish our commitment" and declared
that the American role will continue.
Keogh and Crabtree had driven to northern Namibia on
what a U.S. Embassy spokesman described as a routine visit.
They were to have conferred with South African defense
force officers overseeing the withdrawal of South African
army units from southern Angola.
While refueling their four-wheel drive vehicle at a commer
cial service station on the outskirts of Oshakati, not far from
the Angolan border, a bomb exploded at the fuel pumps, kil
ling three persons, including the two Americans.
Cancer virus may cause AIDS
Washington — Researchers from the National Cancer In
stitute and other laboratories have'found persuasive evidence
that a variant of a human cancer virus may be the major cause
of the mysterious and deadly condition known as AIDS, ac
cording to medical sources.
Experts familiar with the research say that a team headed
by Dr. Robert Gallo has found "very strong" signs that a
newly discovered form of the Human T-Cell Leukemia
(HTLV) virus infects victims of AIDS (acquired immune
deficiency syndrome). It also affects those with an illness that
may precede AIDS.
Promising work with variants of the HTLV virus is also un
der way in laboratories at France's Pasteur Institute and at
the federal Centers for Disease Control, which is coordinating
the United States study of AIDS, sources said.
Supreme court will investigate
political action committees
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday agreed to
consider whether political action committees (PACs) can
continue to make unlimited "independent expenditures" in
support of presidential candidates.
The case, a Democratic challenge to conservative organiza
tions which spent millions of dollars independently in support
of President Reagan's 1980 election, tests the con
stitutionality of a law limiting spending by an independent
PAC to $1000 per candidate in the general election for presi
dent.
The law has never been enforced and two federal court
panels have declared it unconstitutional, on the grounds that
it impermissibly restricts the First Amendment right of people
to band together to express their views on candidates.
Even higher levels of independent expenditures are ex
pected during this year's general election campaign. The
court did not act yesterday on a request to speed up consider
ation of yesterday's case. Unless it does, a ruling before the
election is extremely unlikely.
The law at issue yesterday — the Presidential Election
Campaign Fund Act — applies only to general election cam
paigns for president. Under it. presidential candidates give up
the right to accept private campaign contributions in ex
change for receiving public funds. However, unaffiliated or
ganizations may raise and spend private money so long as the
spending is not coordinated with the candidate they are sup
porting.
Late rally lifts stock market
New York — A late rally in blue-chip stocks helped lift the
overall market to a slight gain in moderate trading yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 7.01 on
Friday and down another 5 points early in yesterday's session,
used its late rally to post a 10.15-point advance to 1160.28.
