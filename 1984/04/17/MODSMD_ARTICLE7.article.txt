From The Washington Post
San Salvador. El Salvador — In an im
portant boost lor the campaign of
moderate presidential candidate Jose
Napoleon Duarte. the head of El Sal
vador's third-largest party said yesterday
that his group would not endorse
Duarte's right-wing rival Roberto
D'Aubuisson.
In a separate development, uniden
tified gunmen shot and killed the highest
ranking Salvadoran security officer
working at the U.S. Embassy. The vic
tim. Joaquim Alfredo Zapata. 59,

reportedly had received death threats
recently regarding his work at another
job as head of security for the Sheraton
Hotel.
Francisco Guerrero, leader of the Na
tional Conciliation Party, said his party
would remain neutral in the May 6
runoff election between Duarte and
D'Aubuisson. The choice of neutrality
was a setback for D'Aubuisson because
he. unlike Duarte, had been thought to
have a chance of gaining Guerrero's sup
port. Salvadoran politicians said.
Guerrero's statement, in an interview

at his home, ended three weeks ot
speculation over whom he would back in
the runoff. Both Duarte and
D'Aubuisson courted his support in a se
ries of private meetings, but Gueriero
said he Ikhl decided to stay out ol the
frav after consulting other party officials.
"I feel that they (Duarte and
D'Aubuisson) are very radicalized. \eiy
polarized. Our people say they don t
want to participate in a tight between
them." Guerrero said.
Guerrero won nearly 20 percent ot the

vote in ,lie Mi"*-' ll -- s first-round ballot, a
bloc of support that is crucial to
D'Auhuisson in the runoff. D'Auhuisson
received 29.N percent in the first round,
substantially behind Duarte's 43.4 per
cent.
Duarte's Christian Democratic Party
was predicting victory in the runoff long
before Guerrero made his announce
ment. Party officials said they had
received results over the weekend of an
opinion poll showing that Duarte would
beat D'Auhuisson 6N percent to 32 per
cent in the second round.
