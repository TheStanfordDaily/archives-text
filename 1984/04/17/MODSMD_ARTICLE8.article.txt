From the Los Angeles Times
Moscow — The Soviet Union, in an apparent effort
to maintain suspense around its participation in the
1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, issued conflict
ing signals yesterday, saying that it would never boycott
the Games but that it had not decided whether to at
tend.
The chairman of the Soviet Olympic Committee.
Marat Gramov, told a news conference repeatedly in
response to reporters' questions that Moscow would
never consider boycotting the Olympic Games.
But he also said that the Soviet Union would send a
team only if it were satisfied that the United States was
fully observing the Olympic charter — and that the So

viet Union alone, not the International Olympic C om
mittee, would make this judgment.
"We do not intend to boycott the Summer Games in
Los Angeles in 1984." said Gramov. who oversees all
Soviet athletic activities as chairman ot the State ( om
mittee on Physical Culture and Sports.
He said that a statement issued by the Soviet Olym
pic Committee last week, alleging American violations
of the Olympic charter in preparation tor the games,
had been misinterpreted in the West.
"Certain people said the statement was used to seek
advantages or as a prelude to a boycott, Gramov said.
"I can immediately tell you that both views are mis
taken and represent a distortion . . . with evil inten

tions.
"We will never boycott the Games. We support the
rules and traditions of the Olympics. Such a word is not
in our lexicon." Gramov said emphatically.
But he sought to draw a distinction between boycot
ting and not attending. In adding:
"In the event that the Olympic Charter is fully ob
served. we will participate in the Games."
Asked to say unequivocally whether the Soviet
Union will or will not send a team to the Los Angeles
Games. Gramox replied. "What do you mean unequiv
ocally? Soviet sportsmen must have normal conditions
for participating in the Olympic Games. This is a very
important consideration leading toward our decision."
