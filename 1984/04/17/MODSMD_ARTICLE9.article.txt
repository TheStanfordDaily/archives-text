## Conflicting careers Married profs worry about more than just tenure 
### CAROLYNN MANN 
Marcus and Shirley Feldman,
both on the faculty of Stanford
University, are among the
growing ranks of dual career
couples. He's a professor of bio
logical science. She's an assis
tant professor of psychology.
"In the past 15 or 16 years,
we've been lucky to get jobs at
the same institution,"
Mrs. Feldman said, "where the
move has been good for both of
us." Neither has been forced to
sacrifice his or her career for
the other.
But the faculty at Stanford is
highly prized and other institu
tions often try to lure them
away. Sometimes, these other
job offers are attractive oppor
tunities and faculty members
are tempted to move on.
Such is the case with
Mrs. Feldman.
Because she is still under con
sideration for a position at an
other university, she prefers not
to talk about her possible move,
but if she gets the job, the

Feldmans will confront a di
lemma that many working
couples must face.
As the number of working
couples increases, the conflicts
between personal and profes
sional life become greater — the
compromises more considerable.
Not long ago, it was common
for the wife's career to take the
backseat while she followed her
husband, across the country if
necessary, as he pursued his
vocation. But times have have
changed and the career deci
sions are no longer so auto
matic.
At Stanford, the problem
facing the Feldmans is not un
common. Other faculty couples
have dealt with this same di
lemma and each has handled it
in their own way.
When Prof. George Collier,
director of Latin American
Studies, was offered a position
at Stanford in 1969, Jane Col
lier was still writing her disserta
tion.
"I was never faced with what

dual career couples are faced
with now," Mrs. Collier said, "1
was of the generation where wo
men were expected to follow
their husbands and do the best
they could."
Mrs. Collier did very well,
eventually gaining a post as as
sociate professor of anthropol
ogy and director of Feminist
Studies at Stanford. If she
hadn't received tenure,
however, they both might have
looked for something else, she
acknowledged.
The Colliers were lucky. For
them, the possibility of conflict
ing careers never came true.
Others, though, have not been
so lucky and have had to make
important decisions concerning
their career, marriage and fam
ily.
Prof. Robert Keohane, once
chair of the Political Science
Department at Stanford, left in
1981 for what might be consid
ered a lesser position back East
when his wife, Nannerl, was
chosen as president of Wellesley

College.
Keohane said he doesn't see it
as a sacrifice. "The academic
hierarchy isn't that clear-cut,"
Keohane said, "and in some
ways, there's more going on in
my field here (at Brandeis)."
He is now a professor at
Brandeis University and also
lectures at Harvard and Yale.
Because the Keohanes had
children ranging from nine to 15
at the time, their overriding
consideration was that they live
in the same place.
Keohane considered staying
at Stanford for a year and then
taking a leave of absence to look
for something else. In the end,
though, it was his kids that made
the final decision. "Given the
age of the children, I didn't want
to he away that long," Keohane
said.
For some couples, career
decisions carry more weight
than other factors. For exam
ple, Michael Hannon, a profes
sor of sociology, will leave Stan
ford in June to marry Susan Ol
zak, an assistant professor of
sociology at the University of
Georgia. Both have accepted
jobs at Cornell University.
The academic resources of
Cornell were strong factors in
their decision to accept the of
fers. The facilities available to
them, the people with whom
they would work and the poten
tial for maximizing their re
search were all considered.
Hannan also has three sons,
all in high school. Though their
feelings were important to him,
he admits he didn't give their
wishes as much weight as those
involving career.
"We're moving someplace
we're liable to be a long time,"
he said. "The boys are only
looking at a couple of years."
His sons are still deciding
whether to go with him or to
stay in California with their mo
ther.
Which spouse will move with
the other also depends on the
respective stage of the couple's
careers at the time.

Like Jane Collier, Renee
Cohn had just finished law
school when her husband. Prof.
Robert Cohn, was offered a po
sition here as a visiting professor
of religious studies. Though she
had been hired by the firm of
Sidley and Austin in Chicago,
she had not yet started there.
She remembered seeing an
announcement of a teaching fel
lowship at the Stanford Law
School and her inquiries proved
fruitful. The Cohns decided to
come to Stanford for a year with
the blessing of both her em
ployer and his. Northwestern
University.
"Our former employers were
very accommodating about
granting leave of absences,"
Prof. Cohn said. "But if Renee
had already started working and
had clients depending on her, it

wouldn't have been as easy."
The Cohns had agreed that if
they couldn't both do something
they liked, or if her career had
to be put on hold for a year,
they would not have come.
Since their arrival, they've
had a son, five-month-old
Gideon. Working on the same
campus allows them to alternate
child-care duties and see each
other during the day, they said.
On the other hand, when one
spouse's career and reputation
is already well-established, the
move seems to be easier. This
was the case with Hannan and
Olzak. the couple that will move
to Cornell.
"Mike is at a different stage in
his career," Olzak noted. "He's
a full professor. I'm an assistant
professor.
"He feels that I'm at a stage

where I need to keep my pro-'
ductivity high. That was a high
priority for both of us," she said.
But of paramount importance
to all the couples interviewed
was the desire to live in the
same place. Olzak, much of
whose courtship occurred over a
long distance, expressed this
desire best.
"My memories of last year
are long tunnels in airports,"
she said. "Airport music ringing
in my ears."
But there are regrets too.
Though all agreed that it can
be good for people to make
changes, Robert Keohane said,
"1 miss Stanford. 1 miss my
many friends and the wide vari
ety of friends 1 had outside the
department."
"And I want you to quote me
on that," he added.

Department at Stanford, left in
1981 for what might be consid
ered a lesser position back East
when his wife, Nannerl, was
chosen as president of Wellesley

College.
Keohane said he doesn't see it
as a sacrifice. "The academic
hierarchy isn't that clear-cut,"
Keohane said, "and in some
ways, there's more going on in
my field here (at Brandeis)."
He is now a professor at
Brandeis University and also
lectures at Harvard and Yale.
Because the Keohanes had
children ranging from nine to 15
at the time, their overriding
consideration was that they live
in the same place.
Keohane considered staying
at Stanford for a year and then
taking a leave of absence to look
for something else. In the end,
though, it was his kids that made
the final decision. "Given the
age of the children, I didn't want
to he away that long," Keohane
said.
For some couples, career
decisions carry more weight
than other factors. For exam
ple, Michael Hannon, a profes
sor of sociology, will leave Stan
ford in June to marry Susan Ol
zak, an assistant professor of
sociology at the University of
Georgia. Both have accepted
jobs at Cornell University.
The academic resources of
Cornell were strong factors in
their decision to accept the of
fers. The facilities available to
them, the people with whom
they would work and the poten
tial for maximizing their re
search were all considered.
Hannan also has three sons,
all in high school. Though their
feelings were important to him,
he admits he didn't give their
wishes as much weight as those
involving career.
"We're moving someplace
we're liable to be a long time,"
he said. "The boys are only
looking at a couple of years."
His sons are still deciding
whether to go with him or to
stay in California with their mo
ther.
Which spouse will move with
the other also depends on the
respective stage of the couple's
careers at the time.

Like Jane Collier, Renee
Cohn had just finished law
school when her husband. Prof.
Robert Cohn, was offered a po
sition here as a visiting professor
of religious studies. Though she
had been hired by the firm of
Sidley and Austin in Chicago,
she had not yet started there.
She remembered seeing an
announcement of a teaching fel
lowship at the Stanford Law
School and her inquiries proved
fruitful. The Cohns decided to
come to Stanford for a year with
the blessing of both her em
ployer and his. Northwestern
University.
"Our former employers were
very accommodating about
granting leave of absences,"
Prof. Cohn said. "But if Renee
had already started working and
had clients depending on her, it

wouldn't have been as easy."
The Cohns had agreed that if
they couldn't both do something
they liked, or if her career had
to be put on hold for a year,
they would not have come.
Since their arrival, they've
had a son, five-month-old
Gideon. Working on the same
campus allows them to alternate
child-care duties and see each
other during the day, they said.
On the other hand, when one
spouse's career and reputation
is already well-established, the
move seems to be easier. This
was the case with Hannan and
Olzak. the couple that will move
to Cornell.
"Mike is at a different stage in
his career," Olzak noted. "He's
a full professor. I'm an assistant
professor.
"He feels that I'm at a stage

where I need to keep my pro-'
ductivity high. That was a high
priority for both of us," she said.
But of paramount importance
to all the couples interviewed
was the desire to live in the
same place. Olzak, much of
whose courtship occurred over a
long distance, expressed this
desire best.
"My memories of last year
are long tunnels in airports,"
she said. "Airport music ringing
in my ears."
But there are regrets too.
Though all agreed that it can
be good for people to make
changes, Robert Keohane said,
"1 miss Stanford. 1 miss my
many friends and the wide vari
ety of friends 1 had outside the
department."
"And I want you to quote me
on that," he added.

Profs. George and Jane Collier were lucky enough to find positions at the same university.

Mike Hannon will move to Cornell — his children must decide whether or not they will go
with him.
Marcus and Shirley Feldman,
both on the faculty of Stanford
University, are among the
growing ranks of dual career
couples. He's a professor of bio
logical science. She's an assis
tant professor of psychology.
"In the past 15 or 16 years,
we've been lucky to get jobs at
the same institution,"
Mrs. Feldman said, "where the
move has been good for both of
us." Neither has been forced to
sacrifice his or her career for
the other.
But the faculty at Stanford is
highly prized and other institu
tions often try to lure them
away. Sometimes, these other
job offers are attractive oppor
tunities and faculty members
are tempted to move on.
Such is the case with
Mrs. Feldman.
Because she is still under con
sideration for a position at an
other university, she prefers not
to talk about her possible move,
but if she gets the job, the

Feldmans will confront a di
lemma that many working
couples must face.
As the number of working
couples increases, the conflicts
between personal and profes
sional life become greater — the
compromises more considerable.
Not long ago, it was common
for the wife's career to take the
backseat while she followed her
husband, across the country if
necessary, as he pursued his
vocation. But times have have
changed and the career deci
sions are no longer so auto
matic.
At Stanford, the problem
facing the Feldmans is not un
common. Other faculty couples
have dealt with this same di
lemma and each has handled it
in their own way.
When Prof. George Collier,
director of Latin American
Studies, was offered a position
at Stanford in 1969, Jane Col
lier was still writing her disserta
tion.
"I was never faced with what

dual career couples are faced
with now," Mrs. Collier said, "1
was of the generation where wo
men were expected to follow
their husbands and do the best
they could."
Mrs. Collier did very well,
eventually gaining a post as as
sociate professor of anthropol
ogy and director of Feminist
Studies at Stanford. If she
hadn't received tenure,
however, they both might have
looked for something else, she
acknowledged.
The Colliers were lucky. For
them, the possibility of conflict
ing careers never came true.
Others, though, have not been
so lucky and have had to make
important decisions concerning
their career, marriage and fam
ily.
