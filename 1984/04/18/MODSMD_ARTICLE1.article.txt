# Turnout heavy for elections

### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
With the first day of ASSU elections
over, election officials say yesterday's
voter turnout was surprisingly heavy
and expect an even greater number of
students to vote in the election today.
According to elections commis
sioner Phil Halperin, yesterday's
heavy turnout may he due to an in
crease in publicity on fee refunds.
"More people probably know now
that they need their voting receipts to
get fee refunds, so we have a heavy

turnout," he said. "There also seems
to be more pressure on seniors to vote,
so that might have made more of them
come out on the first day."
Malperin estimated that approxi
mately 4200 votes were cast yester
day. According to Malperin, that num
ber is "very big" because the total
number of votes cast in last year's
election was around 5500.
The large turnout at the polls yes
terday may cause the ASSU to print
temporary voting receipts today, Hal
perin said.
"The only thing that may go wrong
is if we run out of receipts, and then
we'll have to print up some temporary
receipts to give to people," he said.
"But if that happens, people will be
able to get their regular, permanent
receipts in 10 days."
Halperin said that, in the past, the
number of people voting on the
second day of the election has been
greater than on the first, and he ex
pects that trend to continue this year.

At separate polling locations,
workers said the turnout was rather
sparse, with a greater number of
people voting in between class times.
In addition, workers at the polls
which were open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
said they seemed to have a greater
number of graduate students showing
up to vote.
Laurie Hill, a senior working at the
Engineering Corner poll, said she had
"definitely seen a greater number of
graduates than undergraduates."
According to assistant elections

commissioner Andy Cohen as well as
workers at the various polls, yester
day's election ran smoothly with no
administrative problems.
Election results should he available
Thursday at 7 p.m.. according to Hal
perin. But the heavy turnout expected
at the polls tomorrow may cause the
results to he "a little bit late, Hal
perin said.
There are 25 candidates vying tor
the position of undergraduate senator
and 17 groups requesting special fee
assessments on the current ballot. Stu
dents going to the polls today will also
he voting for council-of-presidents
members and two constitutional
amendments.
