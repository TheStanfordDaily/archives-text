# Turnout heavy for elections

### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
With the first day of ASSU elections
over, election officials say yesterday's
voter turnout was surprisingly heavy
and expect an even greater number of
students to vote in the election today.
According to elections commis
sioner Phil Halperin, yesterday's
heavy turnout may he due to an in
crease in publicity on fee refunds.
"More people probably know now
that they need their voting receipts to
get fee refunds, so we have a heavy

turnout," he said. "There also seems
to be more pressure on seniors to vote,
so that might have made more of them
come out on the first day."
Malperin estimated that approxi
mately 4200 votes were cast yester
day. According to Malperin, that num
ber is "very big" because the total
number of votes cast in last year's
election was around 5500.
The large turnout at the polls yes
terday may cause the ASSU to print
temporary voting receipts today, Hal
perin said.
"The only thing that may go wrong
is if we run out of receipts, and then
we'll have to print up some temporary
receipts to give to people," he said.
"But if that happens, people will be
able to get their regular, permanent
receipts in 10 days."
Halperin said that, in the past, the
number of people voting on the
second day of the election has been
greater than on the first, and he ex
pects that trend to continue this year.
