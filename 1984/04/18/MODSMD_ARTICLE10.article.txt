## The
						Stanford Daily End temporary abuse 
### 
Jesse Solorio has worked at Stanford for over a
year. For 14 to 15 weeks out of every four months,
Solorio is on the Stanford payroll. For the
remaining week or two, Solorio is paid by the
Greyhound employment agency, through which
Stanford hired him.
Solorio is paid in this odd manner because he is
a "temporary" worker. If he were ever to work
four continuous months here, Solorio would
become part of the United Stanford Worker
(USW) bargaining unit, and the University would
be obliged to pay him a decent wage and grant
him union benefits — medical and dental
coverage, a pension plan, sick leave, vacation, the
right to grievance hearings — things that an em
ployer should provide its employees.
Solorio is by no means alone. The grounds shop
alone has seven other temporaries, paid on the
average between $5 and $6 an hour with no union
protection or benefits. They do the same work
that pays their bargaining unit co-workers be
tween $8 and $ 1 1 an hour with full union rights.
The electric shop gets around the four month
restriction by hiring its temporaries for 12-14
week periods, "laying them off," and then turning
around and hiring other temporaries — in many
cases the same ones — to replace them.
The University defends its use of temporaries

by claiming that it needs them to manage shifting
workloads as well as to protect permanent positions
when demand is low. We have no arguments with
this.
But when the grounds and labor shops, to name
two examples, need between seven and nine tem
poraries each for the last two years and the Uni
versity finds it necessary to use subterfuge to get
around its contractual agreement, then the Uni
versity is clearly abusing both temporary labor
and the USW bargaining unit.
Union busting is wrong anywhere, but in a uni
versity environment — supposedly a center of
"enlightenment" — it is downright reprehensible.
We are optimistic about the University's deci
sion to create and fill five permanent positions in
grounds. Though this is a step in the right direc
tion. we believe there is still much to be done.
We believe that Solorio, and others like him,
have proven their talent and dedication to the
University by toiling as long as they have with no
union protection or benefits. Those temporaries
who have worked here the longest should be
given first preference in filling those five posi
tions.
We hope the University recognizes this and
hires all necessary temporaries as full-fledged
members of the bargaining unit.
