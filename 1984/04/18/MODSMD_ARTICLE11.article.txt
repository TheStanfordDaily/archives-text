# The

There was that scene in Airplane when Robert
Hays, trying to catch his flight and his girl, is con
fronted b\ a series of airport Hare Krislin.is who
want his money, his support and his sympathy.
Deftly. Hays fights off each of the pink-gowned
zealots, and he goes on to get the girl, land the
plane and save hundreds of lives.
Walking in White Plaza is a lot like walking
through that airport.
Just the other day we were traversing White
Plaza when our senses were assaulted by various
groups demanding, er, our money, our support
and our sympathy. And while the invaders
weren't dressed in pink or beating tambourines, it
wasn't exactly your typical stroll down Main
Street. U.S.A., either.
There was the guy in the superman suit trying
to get us to purchase a rubber boat. "Your social
life is sunk without us," he insisted.
There were three kids and a dog playing frisbee
football in Mem Claw.
There was a little Italian man selling operas and
listening to his fruit.
There was the guy on the soapbox decrying
socialism, flanked by a pair of clipboard-toting
radicals crying out for a new social vision and a
group of sorority women crying about the lack of
socialization.
There was clcar evidence that Election '84,

ASSU style, was in full swing. Posters, banners
and leaflets littered the area. Catchy slogans,
painted eight-foot high planks of wood,
wrapped around garbage cans, hanging from tree
branches and taped to the concrete, demanded at
tention. despite our efforts to slink by un
obtrusively. "1" equals 0181;" "A One Horse
Open Slate meets the Right Slate in a space race
guaranteed to be the Ride of Your Life;" "The
Steve Miller Band plays on campus April 17-18."
All this while University President Donald
Kennedy impatiently attempted to dunk a COP
member into a tank of water, the Band rallied
through on its way to the Lake and people
watchers munched egg rolls, Teriyaki beef and
shave ice — offerings of Extravaganza '84 —
while they danced to the noon music of Tresid
der's patio. Not to mention the flower stand,
handicraft tables and other assorted peddlers
vying for our, er, money, support and sympa
thy.
So the next time you saunter through the war zone
known as White Plaza late for a class, be prepared
to evade the hungry activists, avoid the budding
campaigners, sidestep the coming bicycles and
step past the sidewalk sales. And if you see a
group of guys with short hair and pink dresses, tell
them you've got to catch a flight. They'll under
stand.
