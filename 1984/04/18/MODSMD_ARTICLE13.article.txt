# Blameless? Of course I am!
## 
### 
Mick Jagger, bard and voice of a generation ob
viously starved for both bards and voices, once
sang. "I shouted out who killed the Kennedys?'—
when, after all. it was you and me." This disturbed
me; honestly, I was nowhere nearby at the time,
nor in much of condition to do anything.
However, this still bothered me. Finally, 1 could
stand it no longer. One day, out by the pool, the
urge rose in me to really find out. I waited until
Jerri Hall. Mick's paramour, had left, not wishing
to upset her with such talk. "Mick." I began, "this
thing about the Kennedys, you know, you don't
. . . well, you don't really blame tne, do you?"
He seemed startled that 1 would bring such a
thing up. "Why. I never really considered it that
way. but no. of course not — 1 don't blame you for
it."
He sunk into a reverie. "No. not at all."
Deep in thought, he pursed his lips — quite a
sight — and continued. "Chris, I honestly don't
think any right-thinking individual could reason
ably blame you lor any of the troubles, problems
or ill-favored events in the world today."
I've often thought back to that time and more
and more it strikes me that Mick, in his rough and
simple way, had hit upon a great truth. Perhaps it
could be stated most easily by noting that I've led a
completely blameless existence on this earth, per
haps most truthfully that my total impact on every
one's life has been positive, but definitely most
completely in saying that so far my behavior and
intentions have been, for want of a more appropri
ate word, perfect.
Simple analysis bears this out. Let's look at our
troubles and seek out my role in their perpetuation

or extirpation.
Poverty and unemployment, the two greatest
evils facing mankind: what were my actions? Did I
waffle and prevaricate, like our politicians, chained
by interests so conflicting as to cause small brush
fires in the Senate cloakrooms? Did I agitate, like
well-intentioned activists who failed to see that the
flow of enthusiasm they generated, pent up for
want of release, would vent itself in destructive and
harmful rages? Did I scorn the masses, or throw
scraps to a starving crowd?
No, of course not.
No. 1 stayed at home, not taking jobs from the
needy and spent the money of my parents, who, in
their wisdom and sound fiscal sense, allowed me
only enough as they could afford and as would
have been proper for my age.
What of the troubles facing the planet itself?
The pollution that threatens the \irgin wilderness,
pollution spread by insatiable lusts for profits on
the part of men too crass and dull to consider their
actions. Myself. I own no paper mills, no refineries
or other pollutants, but at the same time I have not
fallen into the trap of opposing all industry, at cost
to the working man, on behalf of a hysterical devo
tion to nature. No sir; not me.
My part in the split between man and man?
Where do I stand in the numberless tragedies
sparked by differences over religion and morals?
Again, blameless; those who know me will loudly
assert that I have no religion and few morals.
Still, some may say that it is easy enough to be in
the right by not taking any extreme stands. Such
fools! Surely it's obvious enough that it's easiest to
be in the right by taking only extreme stands. The

metaphor extends to voting: Vote once, they say,
and you're throwing your vote away. One voice, or
one moderate stand, has little effect. Vote several
thousand times and you will not only have affected
the election, but you'll be interviewed a few times
on the way to prison, thus able to further dis
seminate your views.
If your extreme view is wrong, or your votes
elect the wrong man. you can change it later and
campaign to impeach the official. You will have been
in the right, in an overblown way, and the weak
nesses of \our position will be explainable as in
evitabilities required of all extreme positions. That
fail-safe, that coward's exit, is not for me.
Rather. I fine-tune my views and beliefs to the
highest precision possible, without care for the ex
cesses I could do, for which I would be forgiven.
Neither following the oligarchs nor the masses, I
pick my own course, vigilant and true.
Perhaps a further note is needed to prove my
claim of unalloyed perfection in behavior. Al
though my appropriate modesty restrains me, I
shall therefore have to point out that I, a possibly
graduating senior, have been here for four years
and never ran for ASSU senator, the COP. or class
office. 1 believe, therefore, that 1 have the sincere
gratitude of a weary world.
As you go out to vote for these callous and un
caring people, I have only one thing to say: a quote
from a man much older than I, though we are
about in the same ballpark, wiseness-wise. "The
voice of the people is the voice of God," he said,
and. as we all know. God is dead.
