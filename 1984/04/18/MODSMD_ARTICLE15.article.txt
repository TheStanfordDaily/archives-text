## Amendment 2 deserves a yes vote 
### 
I am writing in response to the
editorial (Daily, April 6) opposing
ASSU Constitutional Amendment 2
which is on the ballot in this week's
election. This recommendation, it
followed, would continue the effec
tive disenfranchisement of graduate
students, who make up 50 percent of
the student body at Stanford, at the
behest of a Daily editorial board
composed largely of undergraduates.
The Daily's opposition to the
amendment stems from the fact that
it would give the senate the power to
create one district for the election of
graduate members of the ASSU
Senate. The senate already has the
power to specify the number and
composition of the districts; this
amendment would only remove the
requirement that there be more than
one.
In the three years that district
elections have been in effect, they
have proven to have advantages as
well as costs. Rather than deciding at
this point to abolish them, the
amendment asks the student body to
delegate to the senate the authority to
election of graduate senators. Since
find the optimum system for the
this is the third year in a row that an
amendment on this topic has been on
the ballot — all of them uncontrover
sial until now — the current proposal
hardly seemed radical.
As the author of the proposed
amendment, 1 particularly resent the
allegation that anything is being
"snuck through" by placing it on the
ballot. 1 believe that the statements in
the election handbook describe quite
accurately what the intent and effects
of the amendment are. Only in the
minds of the Daily is there anything
sneaky going on.

Women's Center
I was disappointed to read that The
Daily gave the Stanford Women's
Center's request for a Special Fee a
negative recommendation in its list of
Special Fee recommendations (Daily.
April 12).
As an ex-officio member of the
ASSU Senate Appropriations Com
mittee, I reviewed thoroughly all the
Special Fee requests and found the
Women's Center to be one of the few
I found to be above question.
Not only is the request the smallest
of any fee, it is nearly $2000 less than
last year's. As a result of the smaller
budget, the salary of the coordinator
does represent a larger amount of the
total, but the Women's Center coord
inator is necessary to make the exist
ing resources (which The Daily lauds)
accessible to the Stanford community.
The Stanford Women's Center

provides information on jobs, intern
ships. health, housing and women's
issues.
Through the Women's Coordinat
ing Committee it serves as a focus for
a variety of women's organizations,
facilitating communication and
cooperation between these groups.
Without a Special Fee, its services
would not only be reduced, but pos
sibly eliminated.
1 encourage students to vote "yes"
on the Women's Center request for a
Special Fee, and for less than 30 cents
a quarter, maintain this valuable
resource.

Yes on GPB
I was shocked to wake up and find
that The Daily had failed to endorse
student funding for the Guest Profes
sorship Bureau (GPB). The Daily's
notion that the administration could
or should be willing to administer a
GPB is completely baseless. Nobody
in the administration has indicated
any interest or willingness to un
dertake such a project.
During the McCloskey fiasco last
spring, for instance, nobody in the
administration or in the Political
Science Department made any effort
whatsoever to contribute toward
administration of the GPB. After the
event, the administration was willing
to offer criticism, yet it never sugges
ted that it should have, nor was it
willing lo play a more central role in
the process of offering a course.
Moreover, a student-run GPB is
designed to be a learning experience
for those who become involved in
arranging for the courses and solicit
ing prominent guest professors. The
energy we put in and the enthusiasm
we display form the basis for the
success of the GPB. I doubt the ad
ministration would put forth the
same, considering it has displayed no
interest in doing so and do not have
the resources a student-run program
can draw on.
The GPB is and always has been a
student-initiated, student-run and
student-financed program designed to
serve student interests. Each year,
academic departments host a myriad
ol visiting professors, at the behest of
faculty members who arc interested
in their research. The GPB brings
distinguished individuals, often from
outside academia and often contro
versial. who students find attractive;
these individuals would not otherwise
find a classroom forum at Stanford.
Even if the administration were
willing to lund a similar program,
which is a distant hypothetical, it
wouiu 111) longer be the GPB; it might

resemble some of the currently exist
ing \ isiting lecturer series, hut the
GPB's mission, the very point of its
existence as a student-run undertak
ing. would he lost.
The Daily's suggestion that the
administration could be more
successful than the ASSU in operat
ing the GPB seems ludicrous in light
of the fact that no Stanford adminis
trator has suggested taking a much
more active role. Students, including
myself, are already negotiating with
Leonard Bernstein, labor journalist
A.H. Raskin and peace activist and
nuclear policy expert Daniel Ellsberg
for next year. A GPB course is cur
rently underway with environmen
talist David Brower.
The Daily's unresearched and
baseless suggestion only serves to
undermine these student efforts, and
it threatens valuable academic oppor
tunities for Stanford students next
year. A more realistic assessment
would support funding for a student
operated GPB next year.

On the left
"The issue is whether the Stanford
student body wants to finance groups
openly antagonistic to the system
which makes it possible for us to
attend this great University."
This line from a viewpoint (Daily,
April I I) was written in opposition to
ASSU-sponsored leftist organiza
tions. This vocifcrous objection was
made under the guise of a desire to
"(preserve) the University's pristine
non-partisan reputation."
And yet, isn't it curious that the
sustaining system in question is one
threatened by groups like STAR
PAC, SCAAN, SAC and DSA? If
these groups are "soulmates on the
left," is their inevitable opponent on
the right the University itself?
Can it be that Stanford exists be
cause of a right-wing system so sus
ceptible to dissent that the allotment
of $ 140 to a student political project
is viewed by some as political ex
tremism on the part of the ASSU?
Surely even someone in the current
administration would agree that "the
system which makes" Stanford possi
ble includes voices from the left, and
that universities, nay even America
herself, exist because of a pluralistic
dialogue, not a staunch unilateral
polemic.
Maybe before they cast stones at
others, some should look down to be
sure that they don't have a pile of
stones at their own feet.
