## Advising associates Making freshman year a little easier 
### TINA-MARIE BASKIN Staff writer 
We've all heard of TAs,
we've all known RAs,
some of us want M.A.'s, but
what in the world are
A.A.-'s?
If you're a freshman living
in an all freshman residence
than you probably know
what these letters stand for.
For those people who don't
fit this category and think
that A.A. stands for all-
America or Alcoholics

Anonymous, you're in for a
surprise. An A.A. is actually
an advising associate.
According to Alice Sup
ton, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education, an A.A.
works with the staff or fac
ulty adviser and provides a
link between the incoming
freshmen and their adviser.
"This not only makes the job
of faculty adviser easier, but
it is supposed to make the
new student feel more com
fortable knowing that they
can also get advice from a

well-qualified student," Sup
ton said.
The idea of having advis
ing associates was developed
by three students who felt
that freshmen needed to be
able to talk to other students
who were well informed to
give advice. "A.A.'s take a
course the spring before they
begin their job to learn about
University resources, to
learn how to listen and to
learn how to get students to
think about their educational
course planning," Supton
said.
The advising program
began five years ago in
Trancos with six A.A.'s and
has grown to 125 A.A.'s in
the 10 all-freshman

residences that use the pro
gram today.
David Godat. an advising
associate in Branner, said the
fact that he never had an
advising associate made him
interested in being one. His
brother also made him inter
ested in the program, he said.
"I have really enjoyed my
experience with the program.
I see myself as being there as
a friend as well as an adviser.
More importantly, perhaps,
is the aspect of my job is not
just to give advice but to
show them where to get ad
vice on their own so that they
can get to know the Univer
sity on their own as well,"
Godat said.
Freshman Eric Rosenfeld
said his advising associate
has allowed him to get to
know the University by in
forming him of the possibili
ties open to him. "I use the
sources around me: the AIC
(Academic Information Cen

ter), my RA, the depart
ment that I want to major in,
my R.F. It's a good system."
"My problem is getting too
involved," said Kate Nik
kols, another advising associ
ate at Branner. "I consider
my advisees so much my
friends that it's sometimes
tough to be hard on them
and stay purely academic. I
see my job as a mental thing
too. You know, how to take
midterms and finals, tell
them that there is life after
that first D, help them pick
those fun courses and things
like that.
"It has been a wonderful
experience for me. It's the
type of thing where you can
put in as much time as you
want. You're supposed to
meet with your advisees once
a week but I think it really
depends on your relationship
with the kids. I advise them
to try stuff they've never
tried before. I think it's im
portant not to get too tunnel
visioned," Nikkols said.
Bob Stocking, coordinator
of the advising associate pro
gram for 1984-85, agrees with
Nikkols. "Students should

major in an area that is inter
esting to them and fun as
well. If they are just aiming
at a skill area then who
knows if that one area will be
of use by the time that they
want to use it? In my own
education, I've tried not to
be too narrow and balance
the quantitative areas with
liberal arts."
There are three categories
of advisers, and salaries are
determined by the specific
position, said Frank Coufal,
one of the two coordinators
for 1983-84. "Coordinators
are paid $515 a quarter,
head advisers who are in
charge of all the advisers for
a particular dorm are paid
$125 a quarter," he said.
Applicants are usually cur
rent sophomores and juniors.
"We like sophomores be
cause they are the ones who
will stay with the program for
two years," Coufal said.
Advisers are chosen
through an applica
tion/interview process. "We
interview applicants on the
basis of their application and
interview only a great frac
tion of them," Coufal said.
