# The 						Stanford Weekend
## 
### 
It was hard to step outside on campus without crashing a
party this weekend. Crossing White Plaza, you may have
thought you took a wrong turn east, as the Asian
Extravaganza brought traditional Chinese dances to the
Farm. Solo dancers (right), martial arts exhibitions (far

right) and the
dragon dance
(below) filled
the center of
campus.
Meanwhile,
Lake Lagunita
looked
decidedly
Southern
Californian as
dozens of sun
worshippers
flocked to the
beach (lower
right).
Windsurfing
classes
supplanted the
traditional
waterskiing for
Aquafollies, but
the party — and
the Band —
went on anyway
(upper middle).
Ah, the Stanford
weekend.
