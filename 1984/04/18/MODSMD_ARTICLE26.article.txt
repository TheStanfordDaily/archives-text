# Olympic hoop team opens spring practice

### 
Bloomington, Ind. (AP) — The U.S.
Olympic basketball team will be composed
of players from the Bobby Knight mold —
quick, defensive-minded, and willing to
sacrifice themselves for the good of the
team.
Knight and his staff, which includes about
two dozen college coaches, began putting 72
of the nation's top amateurs through those
evaluations yesterday. The 72 will eventu
ally be winnowed down to the final Olympic
squad of 12.
"What we did today was simply try to set
things up by position." Knight said at a news
conference after the opening of the trials
scheduled to end with double-header
scrimmages at Indiana University's Assem
bly Hall over the weekend.

"Our primary purpose is to evaluate, not
teach," Knight said.
Knight, who emphasized that the team
will be picked on what it shows in tryouts
rather than on reputation, made it clear the
kind of player he wants.
"There are three things you've got to de
termine," said Knight, who believes a man
to-man defense is the best weapon for win
ning basketball. "Number one is can you
play defense. Can you guard somebody?
We've got some that can and some that
can't.
"But they all have the potential to be able
to guard someone. If we can't do that, we
can't play successfully," he said.
The second and third priorities are unsel
fishness and quickness.

"We've got to be able to play unselfishly
on offense. We've got to be able to see
what's going on, get the ball where it should
go, have the kind of movement that enables
us to get people open," he said.
Knight said he hasn't determined exactly
how many players will be invited back when
the team begins pre-Olympic training in
May.
"Once we come here in May then we're
going to start teaching the way we want to
play, not now. What we've got to do is put
the kids in a situation where we can evaluate
them," he said.
The first evaluations will come during two
daily practice sessions and scrimmages. On
Saturday about 30 of the hopefuls will be
kept for the weekend double
headers.
Knight praised the National
Basketball Association for its
help in protecting the amateur
status of those selected to repre
sent the United States in Los
Angeles this summer by encour

aging teams who draft Olympic
hopefuls not to sign them until
after the games.
The players selected this
week will return for a mini
camp in mid-May.
They will return in mid-June
for another month of practice
and conclude pre-Olympic
practice with two weeks of com
petition in San Diego against
NBA Summer League teams.

A tentative series of exhibi
tion games was also announced.
Exhibitions against squads of
NBA players will be held in
Minneapolis, lowa City, In
dianapolis. Milwaukee and San
Diego between July 1-25. The
first exhibition will be held here
on June 22, when many of
Knight's former Indiana stars
return to Assembly Hall to play
the U.S. team.
