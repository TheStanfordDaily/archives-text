# Stanford Criterium slated for weekend
## Cyclists gears up for big race 
### LARRY GREEN Daily staff 
Stanford's club cyling team, highly ranked in
tercollegiately, will host the annual Stanford
Criterium this weekend. The event will take place
on a loop around the Wilbur and Stern dor
mitories.
The roads will belong to bikers.
The course should be challenging for the
cyclists who compete because it combines tight
corners with wide straightaways. The course at
some points favors bike-handlers, cyclists who
maneuver well through turns, and at other points
favors sprinters. The uneven road surface should
also have an effect on the race, but because the
course is Hat a fast race is probable.
The Cardinal cyclists have fared extremely well
heading into this important race. The team
opened the season with a stunning victory in the
University of Santa Clara Road Race. Riders Tom
Dresner (novice B), Eric Topp (novice A), Liz
Newberry and Jennie Kiesling (women), and Art
Walker (expert) were the top competitors for
Stanford. The following day first-year rider Cini
Brown won the women's event in the Chico
Criterium.
The Cardinal next topped the list in the UC-
Berkeley Criterium. Brad Chen's victory in the
expert class and Steve Keehn's strong finish in the
novice race helped Stanford's fortunes tremen
dously.

The next test came in two consecutive road
races sponsored by UC-Santa Cruz. Russell
Mead's performances in the two expert races helped
pace the Cardinal. Crashes, flats and mechanical
failures hampered the novice men in these two
meets, as did injuries for the women. However,
Stanford Coach Tim Nicholson felt "very proud
and happy" about his team's performance, par
ticularity his women's squad. Stanford took
second in the team standings on both days behind
archrival UC-Santa Barbara.
Team captains Sean Devin and Jennie Kiesling
look forward to the Stanford Criterium as a prep
aration for the approaching championships.
The Cardinal will face stiff team competition
from UC-Santa Barbara. Devin said, "We haven't
beaten Santa Barbara all year. If we can't beat
them at Stanford we're not likely to do it at the
championships in San Luis Obispo."
The Stanford-Santa Barbara rivalry goes back
several years. The overall league title is awarded
on cumulative results through the spring. Last
year Stanford won the championships but lost the
league title to Santa Barbara. In 1982 the final
results were reversed. This year may end in
similar fashion.
In addition to the collegiate races, a special in
tramural race will be held for interested Stanford
students. The event will begin before the other
races and riders should wear helmets.


Stanford's cycling club hopes to get off to a good start this
weekend in the Stanford Criterium held on a course that will
be marked around Stern and Wilbur halls. Over 150 cyclists
are expected to be on hand, including men's expert riders

and men's novices, as well as women's racers. In addition, a
special intramural race is planned for Stanford students not
