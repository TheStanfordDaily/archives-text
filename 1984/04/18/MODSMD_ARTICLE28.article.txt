# Card preparing for UCLA and USC
## Card netmen demolish Spartans 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
The Cardinal men's tennis team
erushed the visiting San Jose State Spar
tans at the Varsity Tennis Courts yester
day 9-0. Stanford took control early and
the Spartans nev6r really challenged the
Cardinal.
I he Cardinal's singles play was again
its strength. Top-seed Dan Goldie con
tinued to win as he" defeated John
Saviano in straight sets 6-2, 6-2. Car
dinal Head Coach Dick Gould predicted
that Goldie may become the top-seed at
the Pac-10 tournament in two weeks.
Team captain Mark McKeen also had
a tremendous outing. He defeated Bob
Hepner easily 6-0, 6-2.
In the second singles position, Stan
ford's Jim Grabb gave up the first set to
Paul Van Eynde 5-7, but came back in
the last two sets 6-1, 6-2. John Letts

defeated Alex Winslow by the identical
score: 5-7, 6-1, 6-2.
The doubles play is an area of concern
for the Cardinal. The second team of
McKeen and Gordie McKee clobbered
Saviano and Greg Bulwla 6-0, 6-3.
Junior Paul Robinson and freshman
Mark Jacobson played on the third
doubles slot and breezed to a 6-2, 6-2
win over Winslftw and Van Eynde.
But yesterday's first doubles team of
Eric Rosenfeld and Jim Grabb ran into a
bit of trouble. The Spartan pair of Hep
ner and Dave Kuhn won the first set 6-3
and were serving for the match at 5-4.
Rosenfeld and Grabb then pulled things
together and broke service. After hold
ing their own, they broke service again
and won the set 7-5. The Cardinal team
went on to win the third set easily 6-2.
None of the doubles teams were

playing with their usual partners. Only
three of the six Cardinal doubles players
were starters in Los Angeles last
weekend against UCLA and USC.
However, Gould had indicated he might
make a change in his doubles lineup.
Gould is very optimistic about the
Cardfhal's chances this weekend. He
feels sure of winning at least one of the
matches, preferring, of course, to win
both. "Today we had a good effort. San
Jose State has been improving and we
picked it up when the matches were on
the line," he said.
The Bruins will challenge the Cardinal
on Friday at the Varsity Courts, and
Stanford will play the Trojans on Satur
day. The match against USC will begin at
the Varsity Courts with the top singles
and doubles matches scheduled indoor at
Maples Pavilion.
