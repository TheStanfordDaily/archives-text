# 104 faculty sign latest Hoover petition
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
One hundred and four faculty members here
have signed a petition calling for an independent
visiting committee to look into relations between
the University and the Hoover Institution.
The petition's authors, Political Science Prof.
John Manley and English Prot. Ronald Rcbholz,
have led a crusade against the Hoover Institution
since last spring, when they circulated a similiar
petition signed by 84 faculty members and over
l 500 students.
Manley and Rebholz claim that the Hoover In
stitution is partisan, which goes against the Univer
sity's policy of political non-partisanship. The
petitioners claimed in February that the problem
had become "far worse" and had been largely
overshadowed by the controversy over the Reagan
library complex.
According to the two professors, the Board of
Trustee committee formed to look into the issue
was created to strengthen ties between the two in
stitutions, thereby presupposing the "real" issue ot
Hoover's continued existence as a political think
tank.
"We know everyone is sick of hearing about the
Hoover Institution, but the fact is that the Univer
sity has yet to address the central question about
Hoover that we raised a year and a halt ago and
raise again today." Manley and Rebholz said yes
terday in a written statement accompanying the
release of the 104 signatures.
"Does the Hoover Institution engage in political

activities on behalf of certain candidates and, if so,
should such activites be permitted to continue?"
the petitioners wrote. \
As evidence of Hoover's partisan activites, the
statement quoted President Reagan from Hoover's
Annual Report. "During my recent campaign."

Reagan is quoted as saying, "I called on more
people from the (Hoover) Institution to help with
my campaign than from any other institution."
The statement also said Reagan credited the
Hoover Institution with building the "knowledge
base that made the changes now taking place in
Washington possible."
Manley and Rebholz said they continue to ques
tion Hoover because the issue is central to the mis
sion of the University.
"To the extent that Hoover engages in political
activities, and to the extent that Hoover's ties with
Stanford assist it in those activities, Stanford is
necessarily drawn into political activities too," they
said.
According to Manley, his battle is almost over.
"Ours has essentially been a fight to open up the
issue of Hoover to community view and participa
tion. We've been raising questions and presenting
evidence upon which the questions are based," he
said.
Manley likened the lack of response from the
University administration thus far to a stone wall.
"At some point stone walls prevail. The great
power of silence is undeniable. The politics of
silence can prevail, but that is particularly regret
table in a University community where the politics
of discourse should prevail," he said.
Manley says that he will not keep asking his
questions forever.
"It's now up to the Stanford community to

decide whether it wants to face the
problem of Hoover or ignore it. I
think it can be squelched temporarily.

but can't be squashed completely," he
said.
"If the central question is not ad
dressed. fatigue sets in." he said, "and
it will go away only to break out again
four or five years down the road when
Hoover becomes more entangled in
political activites."
