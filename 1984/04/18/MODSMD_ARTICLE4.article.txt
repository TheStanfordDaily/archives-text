# State Dept. names Campbell to panel
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell has been named to a
14-member State Department panel
created to examine whether the
United States should reconsider its
decision to withdraw from the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The Reagan administration an
nounced last December that, unless
significant changes are made, the
United States would withdraw from
UNESCO at the end of this year. The
administration charged UNESCO
with politicizing programs, promoting
anti-Western values and wasteful
management.
The panel, headed by University of
South Carolina President James Hol
derman. will recommend to the Secre
tary of State before the end of 1984
whether the United States should
reconsider its decision because of
recent changes in the organization.
When asked about his views on the
withdrawal, Campbell said. "I don't
approach an assignment like this with
any preconceived ideas."
"It looks like a good, well-qualified
panel to consider this," Campbell said.
Campbell, appointed to his Hoover
post in 1960 by then-Governor
Ronald Reagan, has held six ap
ppointments under four presidents.
He is currently chairman of the Presi
dent's Intelligence Oversight Board
and a member of the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
Holderman is chairman of the U.S.
National Commission for UNESCO
and a critic of the U.S. decision to
withdraw.
Lacy Wright, State Department
director of the Office of Communica
tions and UNESCO Affairs, said the
panel contains "a good balanced
group of people." "It was not filled
with people who are going to rubber
stamp what's already going to be
dot???*' he said.
Education Prof. Hans Weilcr. direc
tor of the UNESCO-affiliated Inter
national Institute for Educational
Planning from 1974 to 1977, said the
administration probably has no inten
tion of changing its decision.
"It is completely unrealistic to ex
pect UNESCO to change its policies
and program orientations in the per
iod of 12 months," he said. "You
make it look like it was UNESCO's
own fault by saying you gave them the
golden opportunity to change."
"It's not remedial, but punitive,"
Weiler said.
Communication Prof. Elie Abel, a

former U.S. delegate to the UNESCO
conference, said the threat to
withdraw may bring about positive
changes in the organization.
"It is a really badly run organiza
tion. It is enormously ideological. The
question is whether this is the most ef
fective way to get changes made, and
it may be," he said. "UNESCO may
very well benefit from this kind of
shock."
Britain, West Germany and several
other Western countries have also ex
pressed dissatisfaction with
UNESCO's activities and warned they
may reconsider their membership if
improvements are not made this year.

A congressional committee is ex
pected to start an investigation of the
workings of the organization this
month, and Britain's Crown auditor in
conducting an independent audit of
the organization from 19N0 to 1983.
Members of the panel include
Harold Andersen, president of the
Omaha World-Herald, Linda Chavez
staff director of the U.S. Commissior
or/ Civil Rights, Lea nurd Mark.-,,
former director of the U.S. Informa
tion Agency, author James Michener
and Frederick Seitz, president
emeritus of Rockefeller University.
Also included are Wendy Bor
cherdt, former deputy undersecretary
for education, George Haley, former
U.S. delegate to a UNESCO confer
ence, Marta Istomin, aritistic director
of the Kennedy Center, Michael
Novak, former U.S. representative to
the U.N. Human Rights Commission,
economist Arthur Ross, Jack
Torczyner, head of the Theodore Her
zel Institute for Education. •
