# Professor, battling Zschau, makes bid for Congress
## 
### SAM DELSON Staff writer 
Education Professor Martin Carnoy Mas
declared his candidacy for the U.S.
Congress, which could turn the election in
California's 12th District into a Stanford vs.
Stanford contest.
If Carnoy defeats Richard Mattoon in the
June 5 Democratic primary, he will face Re
publican incumbent Ed /schau. a former as
sistant professor in the Graduate School of
Business.
Mattoon is a follower of former U.S.
l abor Party leader Lyndon Laßouche. and
is not considered a serious candidate.
Many political experts consider the 12th
District a safe Republican seat.
The district has a higher percentage of Re
publican voters than the national average,
and it has been represented by Republican
congressmen for more than a decade.
Former Rep. Paul - Pete" McCloskey won
more than 70 percent of the district's votes
in both 1978 and 1980, and/schau captured
63 percent in his first campaign in 1982.
/schau "surely has a safe seat." according
to "The Almanac of American Politics
1984," and a recent article in California
Journal looks beyond the 1984 congres

sional race to predict that /.schau will run for
the U.S. Senate in 1986.
But Carnoy believes /schau can be
beaten.
The incumbent is "a Reagan conservative
in a moderate district." Carnoy said. "He

has to compromise himself because the dis
trict is more liberal than he is."
The district's boundaries have been reap
portioned since the 1982 election, giving
Democrats a small plurality in voter registra
tion. Carnoy noted. Palo Alto and Stanford
account for 14 percent of the district's

290,000 voters, and Carnoy hopes to in
crease that proportion by urging students to
register here instead of at their parents' ad
dresses.
The challenger'is focusing his campaign on
two issues: opposition to the arms race and

'/ hope to carry the high
tech issue one step further
by working to see that high
tech industries are at the
service of society rather
than of the arms buildup'

to U.S. intervention in Central America.
"Ed /.schau savs one thing in his con
stituency meetings and votes the opposite
way on the floor ot the House of Represen
tatives." Carnoy said. "He has voted for
every major weapons system that has come
up since he's been in congress.

Carnoy noted that /schau voted for the
MX missile three different times in 1983.
The incumbent has also voted against
amendments that would have limited the
number of U.S. advisers in El Salvador,
barred deployment of U.S. combat troops in
Central America and cut off CIA operations
against the Nicaraguan government.
"There are certain issues, like the nuclear
freeze, that it would be fatal for /schau to
vote against, so he supports amendments to
weaken them, then votes for the final bills."
Carnoy said.
For example, /schau voted for several at
tempts to weaken HR 2760, a bill that would
prohibit covert aid to forces attempting to
overthrow the government of Nicaragua,
then voted for the bill. Carnoy said.
Such seemingly contradictory votes are
not hypocritical, Carnoy said, but merely
"the politics of survival.
• He's too conservative for the district, and
his constituents are really pushing him
against the wall on these issues," Carnoy
said.
Carnoy conceded that /.schau's record is
"good on ERA. abortion and some environ
mental issues."
But he contended that the incumbent is

too conservative on most other issues.
While disarmament and opposition to
U.S. intervention in Central America are the
cornerstones of Carnoy's campaign, he is
also promoting proposals for educational
reforms and increased environmental
protection.
In addition, he advocates conversion of
Silicon Valley's economy away from reliance
on defense industries.
"There's no question that high-tech will
he booming for years in the valley," said
Carnoy. "The question is what it will he used
for.
"I hope to carry the high-tech issue one
step further by working to see that high-tech
industries are at the service of society rather
than of the arms buildup.
"It's naive to expect the high-tech com
panies to make a moral decision not to build
arms. But many of these people would
prefer to produce things like light rail sys
tems if the government was supporting con
tracts for them," Carnoy said.
Lack of money is expected to be a major
problem for Carnoy.
