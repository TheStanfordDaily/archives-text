Supreme Court OKs searches
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that
federal immigration agents may conduct surprise inspections
of factories to seek and question suspected illegal aliens,
In another decision widening police authority to search, the
court also held that officers looking for marijuana do not
need warrants to enter privately owned fields, even when the
j property is fenced and posted with "no trespassing" signs.
The justices' ruling in the illegal aliens case gives the Im
migration and Naturalization Service (INS) a tool it calls criti
cal to the enforcement of immigration laws. More than 2 mil
lion illegal aliens were counted in the 1980 census, and
several million more are believed to be in the country. Fac
tory inspections account for as much as 60 percent of the
aliens caught awav from the U.S. border, according to the
INS.
The court, ruling in a Los Angeles case, unanimously ap
proved the sweeping searches of the work place that authori
ties call "factory surveys" and that critics call "raids." Such
inspections by themselves do not constitute an unlawful
detention of an entire work force, it said.
By a vote of 7-2, the justices said further that incre ques
tioning of workers about their citizenship during a "brief
encounter" does not violate their constitutional rights.
Reagan demands 'no-nonsense'
! policy in Central America
Washington — President Reagan called yesterday lor a
"no-nonsense" approach to protecting U.S vital interests in
Central America, where he charged that the Soviet Union is
trying "to change the strategic balance of the world" by creat
ing "a string of anti-American. Soviet-style dictatorships."
Reagan chose the torum of a luncheon speech to a National
Hispanic Leadership Conference to speak out in defense of
his Central America policy and attempt to increase public
support for it.
Referring to the bitter debate being waged in Congress
over his military funding requests for El Salvador and anti-
Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua, Reagan declared. "There's
still time to defend freedom. But to do so, we can't stand as a
house divided against itself."
The president added. "We must recognize our common
values. We must take a no-nonsense approach to protecting
our vital interests."
Congress adjourned for an Easter recess last Friday with
out approving Reagan's requests for an additional S21 million
for the Nicaraguan guerrillas and $62 million for the Sal
vadoran army. In the case of El Salvador, however, the presi
dent temporarily bypassed Congress by invoking emergency
powers to provide ammunition, supplies and medical equip
ment. He was legally prohibited from providing more money
for the guerrillas, who are backed covertly by the CIA.
Congress reacted especially negatively to the covert fun
ding request after it was disclosed that the CIA had directed
the guerrilla commando mining of Nicaragua's harbors.
White House deputy press secretary Robert Sims, who spe
cializes in national security issues, told reporters yesterday
that the guerrilla operations were "done with full warning in
advance that mines had been placed." He added that "no
lives were lost."
Court studies harbor mining
) 'l he Hague, Netherlands — The International Court of
Justice began closed deliberations here yesterday on
Kic.u;igu;i's motion to condemn the United States tor military
intervention in the Central American country.
A spokesman for the United Nations' court said it might
take some time to reach a verdict on the issue. The court first
will have to rule whether it has jurisdiction over the case.
Nicaragua had filed charges with the Hague court April 9
accusing the United States of "using military force and inter
fering with the sovereign territorial integrity and political in- .
dependence" of Nicaragua.
The charges referred to reports that the U.S. administra
tion was backing guerrillas fighting the Sandinista govern
ment in Managua and that the CIA helped mine Nicaraguan
ports.
The Nicaraguan government also asked the U.N. court to
issue an urgent verdict requiring the United States to stop im
mediately all military support and activities against
Nicaragua.
The Reagan administration, however, declared April 6 that
it would not recognize jurisdiction of the Hague court over
any Central American matters for the next two years.
Midwest gets first quake grant
Washington — The Federal Emergency Management
Agency, announcing its first earthquake preparedness grant
to the Midwest, yesterday allocated $300,000 to seven states
near the New Madrid fault in southeastern Missouri — site of
one of the most severe quakes in American history.
A major quake is likely to occur along the fault before the
end of this century, FEMA officials said. They estimate that
damage could reach $60 billion and that deaths and injuries
could number in the thousands if the region does not upgrade
its ear thquake preparedness program.
"While California is normally thought of by people as the
worst for earthquakes, the most severe area is really the New
Madrid fault," agency Director Louis Giuffrida said.
"Scientists tell us that a recurrence of an earthquake along
the New Madrid fault would cause significant damage over a
200,000-square-mile area," he said. "Near-total destruction
ivould occur close to the epicenter, producing a natural dis
aster unequaled in the nation's history in terms of human life
and economic losses."
German leader urges larger
European role in defense
Bonn. West Germany — The chief disarmament spokes
man of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Party called yesterday for a greater role by Europe in its own
nuclear defense and, eventually, a West German voice in the
use of nuclear weapons.
Writing in the Hamburg daily. Die Welt, Juergen Toden
hoefer. called for a "fusion" of French and British nuclear
forces with the 572 U.S. intermediate-range nuclear missiles
now being deployed in Western Europe to create a unified
nuclear defense for the continent.
While Todenhoefer's remarks do not constitute official
West German government policy and reportedly have drawn
criticism within his own party, they do reflect a growing West
German concern about the need for greater European and
West German say on nuclear issues.
