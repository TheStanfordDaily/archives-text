From the Los Angeles Times
London â€” A gunman inside the Libyan limbassy
here yesterday fired at people demonstrating outside
against the Libyan regime ol Col. Moammar Khadafy
and killed a policewoman and wounded 10 other
people.
By nightfall, hundreds of police officers had sealed
off the embassy in fashionable St. James's Square in the
center of London and dozens of specially armed men
had been sent to the scene. Large blue plastic curtains
were put up to block the view of television cameras.
Home Secretary Leon Brittan called the shooting
"an outrageous, murderous onslaught" and demanded
that the Libyans evacuate the embassy, which is in a
graceful. 18th-centur> townhouse and is now known as
the Libyan People's Bureau.
The police set up a special telephone line into the
embassy and indicated that communications had been
established with the people inside. But the police would
give no details and would not say whether the Libyans
planned to agree to Brittan's demand that they clear
the building in order that it could be searched for arms
and explosives.
The police appeared to be trying to wait out the
Libyans inside the embassv until some diplomatic com
promise could be arranged.

A special Cabinet room, known as Cobra, was set up
to deal with the touchy situation that could lead to fur
ther deterioration of relations between Britain and
Libya or even the severence of diplomatic contacts.
In Portugal, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on an
otticial visit said she was "gravely concerned" over the
embassy shooting and she deplored the death of the
police officer.
In Tripoli. Libyan soldiers were reported to have sur
rounded the British Embassy there and the Libyan
press has reported the incident as an unprovoked attack
by British police against the Libyan diplomats.
During the day. a British Caledonian airliner bound
for Libya was ordered to turn back to London by
British Foreign Office officials.
And at London's Heathrow Airport, six Libyans
were reportedly arrested and held for questioning as
they headed lor an outbound Libyan airliner.
The Libyan demonstrators were protesting against
the Khadafy regime yesterday morning outside the
building that shelters the Libyan Peoples Bureau, lo
cated in one of the most exclusive districts of London
between Picadilly and Paul Mall.
Shortly after 10 a.m.. an automatic weapon opened
fire from one of the embassy windows at the

demonstrators, the bullets striking 10 of them and
police constable Yvonne Fletcher. 25. She was hit in
the abdomen and died in the operating room of
Westminster Ilospital.
"It's a barbarous outrage and a terrible tragedy that a
uning policewoman could have lost her lite this way."
declared Brittan.
Brittan's aim of evacuating and searching the em
bassy is complicated by the fact that it is technically
foreign soil and inviolate to search under the 1947
Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations.
Further, some 22 members of the Libyan staff have
diplomatic status and therefore legal immunity for any
crimes they may commit in Britain.
Shortly after the shooting, a tall Libyan lett the em
bassy with his hands up. But lie was later identified as a
Libyan journalist who had arranged for television
coverage of the demonstration yesterday and had ot
tered his services as a negotiator.
The British government made a strong protest to the
Libyan government in Tripoli about the shootings. And
former Foreign Secretary David Owen, now leader ot
the Social Democratic Party, said that the British gov
ernment should order all Libyan diplomats out ot the
country and close the embassy.
