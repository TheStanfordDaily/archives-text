# CIA led raids on Nicaragua's coast last fall

From The Washington Post
Washington — CIA officers aboard a
"mother ship'' off the coast of Nicaragua
directly supervised commando raids
from speedboats that heavily damaged
Nicaraguan port facilities last fall,
months before they supervised the con
troversial mining of the country's har
bors in January, administration and con
gressional sources said yesterday.
The CIA leased the ship last summer,
according to the sources, and American
agents aboard it furnished the speed
boats, guns and ammunition and directed
the raid by anti-government rebels in the
port city of Corinto last Oct. 10. The
CIA officers stayed on the ship in inter
national waters beyond the 12-mile limit.

while CIA-trained Latin commandos
piloted the speedboats into the harbor
and shot up an oil terminal, the sources
said.
The raid heavily damaged oil storage
tanks and forced thousands of in
habitants to flee. At the time, the
N'icaraguan government charged that the
"criminal attack" was part of a CIA plan,
but the U.S.-supported "contras" of the
Honduras-based Nicaraguan Democratic
Front (FDN) claimed credit for the raid.
A senior White House official con
firmed that CIA agents supervised the
attack, saying their role was necessary
because "they (CIA officers) had the
speedboats."
A CIA spokesman declined to com

ment yesterday, except to say that
Congress had been informed of its covert
operations as required by the intelligence
oversight laws.
But, as in the case of the mining, con
gressional sources said the House and
Senate intelligence committees were not
told of the direct involvement of
Americans in the port raids until
recently.
CIA Director William Casey already is
under fire from congressmen for his al
leged lack of candor in informing intelli
gence committees of the details of the
Reagan administration's supposedly se
cret war against Nicaragua.
One congressional source said staff

members of the House intelligence com
mittee first "got wind of the mother ship
about mid-October." but didn't get a full
briefing on either the ship's role in the
raid or the mining until Jan. 31 and then
only after persistent questioning from
members.
But another source said some House
committee members didn't know until
yesterday that the CIA had directed the
raid, as well as the mining.
"We were directly misled." he said.
"They led us to believe it was the con
tras. hut as it turns out it was CIA per
sonnel on the mother ship, directing the
operations, picking the targets and the
whole business."
