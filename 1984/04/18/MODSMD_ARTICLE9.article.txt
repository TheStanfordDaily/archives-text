# Missouri favors Mondale; Hart monopolizes media

Missouri caucus today
Kansas City, Mo. — One way
to understand the difference be
tween a caucus and a primary is
to consider the semantics.
In a primary, a person who
casts a ballot without first
having been cajoled,
transported, arm-twisted or
tugged at by appeals to
friendship and loyalty is known
as "a voter."
In a caueus, that same person
is known as a "walk-in," and, in
Missouri anyway, is quite a
novelty.

The distinc
tion takes on
considerable im
portance in the
current phase of
the Democratic
presidential
nominating
season. Sen.

Gary Hart of Colorado needs
some victories, but the next two
major showdowns — today in
Missouri (75 national conven
tion delegates) and on May 5 in
Texas (169 delegates) — are
both caucuses.
Hart says the West ought to
be his turt, but the caucus sys
tem here clearly favors Walter
Mondale, as it does almost
everywhere else. Hart's cam
paign brass in Missouri say
they'll do well to capture more
than a third of the delegates, a
projection that seems based as
much on genuine frustration as
on tactical low-balling.
"The whole point of the
caucus process is to exclude the
average voter," fumes I.orilei
Lorch, Hart's western Missouri
coordinator.
The caucus system is a
process devised and dominated
by political insiders and this
year it is riding high. Thirty-one
states will pick 1460 delegates
(37 percent of the total) to the
July Democratic National Con

vention by caucus, up from 25 in
1980.
Depending on one's perspec
tive, and to some extext on the
calendar and local custom,
caucuses can be town meetings
where interested citizens engage
their neighors in earnest debate,
or they can be wired, boys-in
the-backroom affairs that do
violence to everything from citi
zen partication to the principle
of one man, one vote.
The lowa precinct caucuses,
the nation's most famous be
cause they head the nomination

calendar, are a good example of
the more benign model. lowans
are such old hands that they
turn out to caucus in greater
percentages than some state
electorates turn out for primary
elections. This year, 85,000
lowa Democrats caucused, 16
percent of those eligible.
Missouri, by contrast, at
tracted fewer than 12,000
voters to its 1980 Democratic
caucuses, a meager four-tenths
of 1 percent of those eligible.
This year, with some drama still
left in the Democratic contest,
party leaders believe the turn
out today will be at least
double that and perhaps much
more.
Still, the Hart forces are con
vinccd thai ordinary voters are
intimidated by the caucuses. At
a strategy meeting Monday
night. I orch urged ward coord
inators to telephone prospective
caucus-goers beforehand.
"Call them up and tell them
that you'll take care of them
Wednesday night, that you'll be

there to explain how it all
works, that you'll walk them
through it," she said.
"Yeah, but who's going to
lead us?" a coordinator mused
from the back of the room, to
laughs all around.
The question points up the in
experience of the Hart troops.
Karl Zobrist, a lawyer who has
been leading the Kansas City
organizing effort, says he's
"looking forward to the
caucuses like a kid going to his
first birthday party. I've never
been to one before." Zobrist

said the key to
getting new
people to go to
caucuses is
"doing it the
way Amway
does. You call
10 of your
friends, they

each call 10 of their friends and
so on."
"Promise them anything, then
tell them after Wednesday night
that you lied," advised state
Democratic Rep. Annette Mor
gan. "Seriously, the key is to
make the appeal personal. Say
that it really means a lot to me if
you come."
Hart enters lions' dens
Columbus, Ohio — Hart went
into the political lions' den in
three states yesterday.
The lions didn't eat him alive,
but at two stops they clawed him
enough to draw blood.
Hart aides say they hope that
the public encounters, largely
staged for television consump
tion, will give their candidate
the same fighter image that has
helped fellow Democratic
presidential contender Moncl;ile
in recent weeks.
The first occurred at the 94th
Aero Squadron Restaurant in St.
Louis, where Hart met with two
union leaders from the nearbv

McDonnell Douglas Corp. fac
tory. Hart told them that he
didn't like two military planes
manufactured by the firm, the
Air Force F-15 and the Navy F
lKa, because they were "too ex
pensive and not maneuverable
enough."
He said he wanted to build
more but different and better
fighters.
This wasn't what the union
officials wanted to hear. Cassell
Williams, a machinists' union
leader, said he considered the
McDonell Douglas planes to be
"an integral part of the protec
tion of the free world."
Williams said he admired
Hart's frankness but that he still
intends to vote for Mondale in
the Missouri caucuses today. He
said he was worried about "my
job, my bread and butter. Any
time when there is a threat of
personal security, you'll find
concern."
Hart, trying to recover from a
string of primary losses before
last Saturday's victory in
Arizona, next went to Lake
County, Ind., the heart of the
nation's largest steel producing
area. He told a forum of steel
workers and management
spokesmen in East Chicago that
he favors industry-wide pro
grams to revive the steel and
auto industries rather than
"bail-outs, handouts and Band-
Aids" favored by Mondale.
Hart's third encounter of the
day was with Ohio Gov. Rich
ard Celeste, who his aides say
intends to endorse Mondale
next week. Hart met with him
here in Ohio's capital in late af
ternoon, but afterward both
fended off questions about an
endorsement.
Meanwhile, Jesse Jackson
continued canvassing Missouri
for support.
Campaigning in St. Louis yes
terday, he repeatedly

denounced the caucus system,
declaring that "it" they used the
caucus system in Nicaragua, we
would have another reason for
mining the harbor." Jackson
repeatedly has complained that
both the caucuses and the
method of allocating delegates
in several primaries has worked
against him.
Jackson courts Hispanics
Washington — Making a bid
for Latino votes, Jackson Mon
day said if he is elected he will
convene a meeting with the na

tion's business leaders in an ef
fort to get them to sign a "'trade
agreement" that would provide
$50 billion worth of business for
blacks and Latinos.
The proposed agreement,
modeled on those that Jackson
negotiated as president of Oper
ation PUSH, calls for each of
the Fortune 500 companies to
buy $100 million in goods and
services from the two
minorities. Jackson said.
Later, in an interview, he said
that it was the first time he had
made such a proposal "in the

context of the presidential cam
paign."
Speaking to National
Hispanic Leadership Confer
ence, a group of about 50
leaders of Latino groups from
around the nation. Jackson said
that Latinos have a "natural"
unity with blacks and urged the
two groups to "live together as
brothers and sisters or we shall
surely die apart as fools."

Missouri caucus today
Kansas City, Mo. — One way
to understand the difference be
tween a caucus and a primary is
to consider the semantics.
In a primary, a person who
casts a ballot without first
having been cajoled,
transported, arm-twisted or
tugged at by appeals to
friendship and loyalty is known
as "a voter."
In a caueus, that same person
is known as a "walk-in," and, in
Missouri anyway, is quite a
novelty.

The distinc
tion takes on
considerable im
portance in the
current phase of
the Democratic
presidential
nominating
season. Sen.

Gary Hart of Colorado needs
some victories, but the next two
major showdowns — today in
Missouri (75 national conven
tion delegates) and on May 5 in
Texas (169 delegates) — are
both caucuses.
Hart says the West ought to
be his turt, but the caucus sys
tem here clearly favors Walter
Mondale, as it does almost
everywhere else. Hart's cam
paign brass in Missouri say
they'll do well to capture more
than a third of the delegates, a
projection that seems based as
much on genuine frustration as
on tactical low-balling.
"The whole point of the
caucus process is to exclude the
average voter," fumes I.orilei
Lorch, Hart's western Missouri
coordinator.
The caucus system is a
process devised and dominated
by political insiders and this
year it is riding high. Thirty-one
states will pick 1460 delegates
(37 percent of the total) to the
July Democratic National Con

vention by caucus, up from 25 in
1980.
Depending on one's perspec
tive, and to some extext on the
calendar and local custom,
caucuses can be town meetings
where interested citizens engage
their neighors in earnest debate,
or they can be wired, boys-in
the-backroom affairs that do
violence to everything from citi
zen partication to the principle
of one man, one vote.
The lowa precinct caucuses,
the nation's most famous be
cause they head the nomination

calendar, are a good example of
the more benign model. lowans
are such old hands that they
turn out to caucus in greater
percentages than some state
electorates turn out for primary
elections. This year, 85,000
lowa Democrats caucused, 16
percent of those eligible.
Missouri, by contrast, at
tracted fewer than 12,000
voters to its 1980 Democratic
caucuses, a meager four-tenths
of 1 percent of those eligible.
This year, with some drama still
left in the Democratic contest,
party leaders believe the turn
out today will be at least
double that and perhaps much
more.
Still, the Hart forces are con
vinccd thai ordinary voters are
intimidated by the caucuses. At
a strategy meeting Monday
night. I orch urged ward coord
inators to telephone prospective
caucus-goers beforehand.
"Call them up and tell them
that you'll take care of them
Wednesday night, that you'll be

there to explain how it all
works, that you'll walk them
through it," she said.
"Yeah, but who's going to
lead us?" a coordinator mused
from the back of the room, to
laughs all around.
The question points up the in
experience of the Hart troops.
Karl Zobrist, a lawyer who has
been leading the Kansas City
organizing effort, says he's
"looking forward to the
caucuses like a kid going to his
first birthday party. I've never
been to one before." Zobrist

said the key to
getting new
people to go to
caucuses is
"doing it the
way Amway
does. You call
10 of your
friends, they

each call 10 of their friends and
so on."
"Promise them anything, then
tell them after Wednesday night
that you lied," advised state
Democratic Rep. Annette Mor
gan. "Seriously, the key is to
make the appeal personal. Say
that it really means a lot to me if
you come."
Hart enters lions' dens
Columbus, Ohio — Hart went
into the political lions' den in
three states yesterday.
The lions didn't eat him alive,
but at two stops they clawed him
enough to draw blood.
Hart aides say they hope that
the public encounters, largely
staged for television consump
tion, will give their candidate
the same fighter image that has
helped fellow Democratic
presidential contender Moncl;ile
in recent weeks.
The first occurred at the 94th
Aero Squadron Restaurant in St.
Louis, where Hart met with two
union leaders from the nearbv

McDonnell Douglas Corp. fac
tory. Hart told them that he
didn't like two military planes
manufactured by the firm, the
Air Force F-15 and the Navy F
lKa, because they were "too ex
pensive and not maneuverable
enough."
He said he wanted to build
more but different and better
fighters.
This wasn't what the union
officials wanted to hear. Cassell
Williams, a machinists' union
leader, said he considered the
McDonell Douglas planes to be
"an integral part of the protec
tion of the free world."
Williams said he admired
Hart's frankness but that he still
intends to vote for Mondale in
the Missouri caucuses today. He
said he was worried about "my
job, my bread and butter. Any
time when there is a threat of
personal security, you'll find
concern."
Hart, trying to recover from a
string of primary losses before
last Saturday's victory in
Arizona, next went to Lake
County, Ind., the heart of the
nation's largest steel producing
area. He told a forum of steel
workers and management
spokesmen in East Chicago that
he favors industry-wide pro
grams to revive the steel and
auto industries rather than
"bail-outs, handouts and Band-
Aids" favored by Mondale.
Hart's third encounter of the
day was with Ohio Gov. Rich
ard Celeste, who his aides say
intends to endorse Mondale
next week. Hart met with him
here in Ohio's capital in late af
ternoon, but afterward both
fended off questions about an
endorsement.
Meanwhile, Jesse Jackson
continued canvassing Missouri
for support.
Campaigning in St. Louis yes
terday, he repeatedly

denounced the caucus system,
declaring that "it" they used the
caucus system in Nicaragua, we
would have another reason for
mining the harbor." Jackson
repeatedly has complained that
both the caucuses and the
method of allocating delegates
in several primaries has worked
against him.
Jackson courts Hispanics
Washington — Making a bid
for Latino votes, Jackson Mon
day said if he is elected he will
convene a meeting with the na

tion's business leaders in an ef
fort to get them to sign a "'trade
agreement" that would provide
$50 billion worth of business for
blacks and Latinos.
The proposed agreement,
modeled on those that Jackson
negotiated as president of Oper
ation PUSH, calls for each of
the Fortune 500 companies to
buy $100 million in goods and
services from the two
minorities. Jackson said.
Later, in an interview, he said
that it was the first time he had
made such a proposal "in the

context of the presidential cam
paign."
Speaking to National
Hispanic Leadership Confer
ence, a group of about 50
leaders of Latino groups from
around the nation. Jackson said
that Latinos have a "natural"
unity with blacks and urged the
two groups to "live together as
brothers and sisters or we shall
surely die apart as fools."
