But is Dean Fred watching?
While their parents shop at the Bookstore, Rebbeca Matheson and Peter Landreth do a little pleasure
reading in the hopes that Dean Fred soon may be there. Matheson (potential class of '03) and Landreth
(potential class of '99) hope the reading list they are compiling now, will help them when they have to
apply to college in the coming years.
