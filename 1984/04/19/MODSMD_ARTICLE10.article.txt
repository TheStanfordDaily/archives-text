## Guest professor speaks out Brower worried about resources, nuclear energy 
### MARY YUH 
His goal is the goal of environmentalism: "a
society that lives on the earth's income, not on
capital. His view is the view of environmen
talism: 'earth, sea, air, energy and life have
been and are being severely impaired by the
excesses and carelessness of the human popu
lation."
He is David Brower, known on campus as
the ASSU guest professor, but known to
America, and quite possibly the world, as the
foremost living environmentalist.
Tributes to his efforts and achievements are
many. He has honorary degrees from Hobart
and William Smith Colleges, Colorado Col
lege, University of Maryland and others. Add
to these the National Parks Asociation
Award, the Paul Bartsch Award, the Golden
Ark Award, the John Muir Award and
nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize in
1978 and 1979, and it is easy to see how com
pletely Brower has dominated the environ
mental world.
But such accolades do not make the man.
The 71-year-old is a dedicated crusader, in
tensely loyal and committed to his ideals. He
is also a husband and the father of four
children. His dedication extends to his family,
as seen in his recent visit to Nepal to see his
daughter, studying on a Fulbright Scholarship,
marry a fellow student.
While his life's work has been centered
mostly on conservationism, he has ap
proached it in various ways. For instance, he
was and still is involved with the Sierra Club, a
political group concerned with the environ
ment. After serving, for 17 years, as the club's
first executive director, he remains active and
. currently serves on its hoard of directors.
In addition, Brower also founded the multi
national Friends of the Earth in 1969, of
which he is chairman, as well as many other
organizations.
But his interests do not stop with the form

ing of environmental groups. He has also led
the establishment of many national parks, the
protection of valuable forests and the preven
tion of dams at Dinosaur National Monument
and the Grand Canyon.
His numerous experiences have also
prepared him for writing. He has edited many
books on environmentalism including "In
Wildness is the Preservation of the Earth,"
which was judged one of the 10 most beautiful
books in the world at the Leipzig Interna
tional Book Fair in 1963.
Brower was drawn into environmentalism
through his love of and concerns for nature.
He is accomplished in climbing and ski moun
taineering and started the knapsack, river and
threshold trips with the Sierra Club Wilder
ness Outings program, leading some 4000
people into remote regions of the wild and
back.
Because of this great fondness for the out
doors, the destruction and contamination of
the wilderness continually causes him great
sadness.
"It used to be that one could go into the
mountains and drink from the streams. No
more, for the water is contaminated. The
beauty and the purity of our earth, the only
one we have, is being destroyed," Brower la
ments.
It isn't just the destruction of beauty that
disturbs him, though, but also the destruction
of resources. As a society, he says, Americans
consume 1 0 times the world average of natu
ral resources. By now, the wastefulness and
carelessness of American society have been
well-publicized and the situation has im
proved, but, Brower says, it has not improved
enough.
In 1982, Brower founded yet another or
ganization, the Earth Island Institute, a group
committed to promoting ecological concerns
and "instilling an ecological conscience." In
that same year he also initiated the First Bien

nial Conference of the Fate of the Earth. The
second will be held later this year in Washing
ton, D.C., and its aim is to educate the people
concerning current situations, to offer ideas
and to discuss possible solutions to the prob
lems which continue to trouble many people.
Brower has taught here once before, in the
spring of 1981, and one of the most tangible
results of that class is Stanford for Environ
mental Education (SEE), founded by Stan
ford graduate David Kreger that fall. Seeing
his students take off and do work in environ
mentalism is one of the greatest rewards of
teaching, Brower says. He says that he teaches

to spark interest and involvement in conser
vationist issues and to help prepare a genera
tion of future leaders.
With these goals in mind, he has come to
Stanford this quarter as guest professor and is
teaching a class entitled "Environmental So
lutions: Science, Ethics and Policy." Its focus
is not only on what needs to be done, but also
on how to do it: to use the media in educating
the public and to use legislation toward help
ing solve problems.
Chief among the problems which trouble
Brower is the possibility of nuclear disaster,

and, like many others, he has become increas
ingly involved in the nuclear issue. Prevention
of an atomic catastrophe has become of pri
mary importance to every major environmen
talist, for it would "totally destroy," Brower
says,"the one and only earth we have, render
ing it uninhabitable.'' The concern is so great
that not only nuclear weapons but also nuclear
energy is being opposed.
The dangers of nuclear energy far outweigh
the benefits, believes Brower, and, citing
Three Mile Island, Love Canal and Diabho
Canyon as cases in point, he feels that this en
ergy resource is not even proving to be cost ef
fective. Brower believes that we should look
to other energy sources, such as the sun, as
well as monitoring our energy consumption.;
This issue of nuclear disaster has drawn en
vironmentalists even deeper into politics than
they were before. Brower sees political in
volvement as essential in the achievement of
environmentalist goals, and that government
cooperation and support is of great benefit.
"The Reagan administration has done y
great deal of damage to environmentalist!) and
has really set us back a number of years," he
said.
He cites not only the actions of James Watt,
former secretary of the Interior, but also the
disintegration of many agencies and organiza
tions as well as the cutting off of financial and
ideological support in having made the past
several years "extremely difficult for environ
mentalism."
Brower is a man who has dedicated his life
to a cause and manifested his dedication in
varied ways: political actions and battles, dis
persion of information and promotion of
awareness and activities, centered on the ap
preciation of nature. He is reserved and dig
nified and full of energy despite being at an
age when many are retired. As a man and as
an enviromentalist, he shows little sign of
slowing down.

mary importance to every major environmen
talist, for it would "totally destroy," Brower
says,"the one and only earth we have, render
ing it uninhabitable.'' The concern is so great
that not only nuclear weapons but also nuclear
energy is being opposed.
The dangers of nuclear energy far outweigh
the benefits, believes Brower, and, citing
Three Mile Island, Love Canal and Diabho
Canyon as cases in point, he feels that this en
ergy resource is not even proving to be cost ef
fective. Brower believes that we should look
to other energy sources, such as the sun, as
well as monitoring our energy consumption.;
This issue of nuclear disaster has drawn en
vironmentalists even deeper into politics than
they were before. Brower sees political in
volvement as essential in the achievement of
environmentalist goals, and that government
cooperation and support is of great benefit.
"The Reagan administration has done y
great deal of damage to environmentalist!) and
has really set us back a number of years," he
said.
He cites not only the actions of James Watt,
former secretary of the Interior, but also the
disintegration of many agencies and organiza
tions as well as the cutting off of financial and
ideological support in having made the past
several years "extremely difficult for environ
mentalism."
Brower is a man who has dedicated his life
to a cause and manifested his dedication in
varied ways: political actions and battles, dis
persion of information and promotion of
awareness and activities, centered on the ap
preciation of nature. He is reserved and dig
nified and full of energy despite being at an
age when many are retired. As a man and as
an enviromentalist, he shows little sign of
slowing down.

Renowned environmentalist and current guest professor David Brower speaks to a
crowd of enthusiasts during a recent campus visit.
His goal is the goal of environmentalism: "a
society that lives on the earth's income, not on
capital. His view is the view of environmen
talism: 'earth, sea, air, energy and life have
been and are being severely impaired by the
excesses and carelessness of the human popu
lation."
He is David Brower, known on campus as
the ASSU guest professor, but known to
America, and quite possibly the world, as the
foremost living environmentalist.
Tributes to his efforts and achievements are
many. He has honorary degrees from Hobart
and William Smith Colleges, Colorado Col
lege, University of Maryland and others. Add
to these the National Parks Asociation
Award, the Paul Bartsch Award, the Golden
Ark Award, the John Muir Award and
nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize in
1978 and 1979, and it is easy to see how com
pletely Brower has dominated the environ
mental world.
But such accolades do not make the man.
The 71-year-old is a dedicated crusader, in
tensely loyal and committed to his ideals. He
is also a husband and the father of four
children. His dedication extends to his family,
as seen in his recent visit to Nepal to see his
daughter, studying on a Fulbright Scholarship,
marry a fellow student.
While his life's work has been centered
mostly on conservationism, he has ap
proached it in various ways. For instance, he
was and still is involved with the Sierra Club, a
political group concerned with the environ
ment. After serving, for 17 years, as the club's
first executive director, he remains active and
. currently serves on its hoard of directors.
In addition, Brower also founded the multi
national Friends of the Earth in 1969, of
which he is chairman, as well as many other
organizations.
But his interests do not stop with the form

ing of environmental groups. He has also led
the establishment of many national parks, the
protection of valuable forests and the preven
tion of dams at Dinosaur National Monument
and the Grand Canyon.
His numerous experiences have also
prepared him for writing. He has edited many
books on environmentalism including "In
Wildness is the Preservation of the Earth,"
which was judged one of the 10 most beautiful
books in the world at the Leipzig Interna
tional Book Fair in 1963.
Brower was drawn into environmentalism
through his love of and concerns for nature.
He is accomplished in climbing and ski moun
taineering and started the knapsack, river and
threshold trips with the Sierra Club Wilder
ness Outings program, leading some 4000
people into remote regions of the wild and
back.
Because of this great fondness for the out
doors, the destruction and contamination of
the wilderness continually causes him great
sadness.
"It used to be that one could go into the
mountains and drink from the streams. No
more, for the water is contaminated. The
beauty and the purity of our earth, the only
one we have, is being destroyed," Brower la
ments.
It isn't just the destruction of beauty that
disturbs him, though, but also the destruction
of resources. As a society, he says, Americans
consume 1 0 times the world average of natu
ral resources. By now, the wastefulness and
carelessness of American society have been
well-publicized and the situation has im
proved, but, Brower says, it has not improved
enough.
In 1982, Brower founded yet another or
ganization, the Earth Island Institute, a group
committed to promoting ecological concerns
and "instilling an ecological conscience." In
that same year he also initiated the First Bien

nial Conference of the Fate of the Earth. The
second will be held later this year in Washing
ton, D.C., and its aim is to educate the people
concerning current situations, to offer ideas
and to discuss possible solutions to the prob
lems which continue to trouble many people.
Brower has taught here once before, in the
spring of 1981, and one of the most tangible
results of that class is Stanford for Environ
mental Education (SEE), founded by Stan
ford graduate David Kreger that fall. Seeing
his students take off and do work in environ
mentalism is one of the greatest rewards of
teaching, Brower says. He says that he teaches

to spark interest and involvement in conser
vationist issues and to help prepare a genera
tion of future leaders.
With these goals in mind, he has come to
Stanford this quarter as guest professor and is
teaching a class entitled "Environmental So
lutions: Science, Ethics and Policy." Its focus
is not only on what needs to be done, but also
on how to do it: to use the media in educating
the public and to use legislation toward help
ing solve problems.
Chief among the problems which trouble
Brower is the possibility of nuclear disaster,

and, like many others, he has become increas
ingly involved in the nuclear issue. Prevention
of an atomic catastrophe has become of pri
mary importance to every major environmen
talist, for it would "totally destroy," Brower
says,"the one and only earth we have, render
