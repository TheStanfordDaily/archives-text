## The 						Stanford Daily Guests of honor 
### 
The Daily editorial board recommended that
students vote no on the Guest Professorship
Bureau (GPB) $39,347 special fee request, and
instead persuade the administration to fund the
worthwhile program. Regardless of how the vote
turns out, the GPB should move in this direction
and redefine its function.
The GPB recruits distinguished experts to
teach at Stanford for part of the year. The bureau
has had some notable successes, including courses
taught by Friends of the Earth founder David
Brower and former presidential candidate John
Anderson. Conductor Leonard Bernstein is a
possibility next year. The GPB uses the student
money to pay the professors and administer the
program.
Those students who devote their time to the
GPB deserve our praise. Their efforts add diver
sity to the curriculum and give students exposure
to important world figures. The GPB leaders
themselves also gain valuable organizational and
negotiation skills.
The GPB student coordinators point to these
successes and the benefits of the program when
asking for a continuation of ASSU funding. They
also argue that the administration has indicated
no interest in supporting the program. We agree
that the GPB is an important project, but we feel

it can be vastly improved with University financial
support.
The University has a responsibility to use tui
tion funds to create a top-rate educational experi
ence. This experience includes the diversity that
GPB professors provide. Assessment money is
designed for promoting extracurricular activities;
the University's faculty budgets are designed for
promoting curricular activities.
With administration funding, the GPB could
expand the program and sponsor several big
name experts each quarter. The current GPB is
hindered in negotiations since its budget for next
year is still undetermined. An administration
funded program would have a secure, long-term
budget allotment and the funds to better publicize
and attract professors. The learning experience
for students would remain, as they would be in
volved in choosing the professors and conducting
the negotiations.
Other universities pay for all their guest profes
sors, and Stanford students should not have to
sacrifice to relieve the administration of its re
sponsibility. Whether or not the fee request
passes, we hope the GPB student leaders will
work toward bringing more guest professors to
Stanford. The first step is an appointment with
University President Donald Kennedy.
