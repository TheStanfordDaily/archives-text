# Nicaraguan nightmares

### 
The thing that bothers us the most about the
growing controversy over the Reagan administra
tion's support of the mining of Nicaraguan har
bors is not the fact that the move has very little
support in Congress.
Our primary concern is not that the CIA has
been supervising commando raids off the
Nicaraguan coast since last fall and has failed to
inform Congress about its activities in the region,
an oversight that is against the law.
Nor is it the most galling that even Republican
Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the self
described Mr. Conservative and hawk, wrote a
letter to William Casey, the head of the CIA,
saying that the CIA had betrayed the Senate by
not informing the Intelligence Committee ade
quately about the extent of the mining.
It doesn't even really kill us that Democratic
Sen. Daniel Moynihan of New York plans to
resign because of the perniciousness of the ClA's
lack of interest in paying attention to law.
It's only relatively annoying that the Reagan
administration chose to slap international
cooperation in the face by withdrawing from the
jurisdiction of the World Court days before
Nicaragua decided to complain to the court about
the mining.
We'll just let Goldwater express, in his inim
itably eloquent way, our real beef with the
Reagan administration over the issue.
"Bill," Goldwater wrote to Casey, "how can we

back his (Reagan's) foreign policy when we don't
know what the hell he is doing? Mine the harbors
in Nicaragua? This is an act violating interna
tional law. It is an act of war. For the life of me, I
don't see how we are going to explain it."
What really bothers us about the Reagan ad
ministration's policy towards Nicaragua (and
Central America in general) is that there really
isn't much of a policy.
Sometimes, President Reagan says we are
fighting the Sandinistas to make sure that they ad
here to their promises of democracy in Nicaragua.
But on other occasions, the president makes it
very clear that the Sandinistas are godless com
munists who can't be trusted to stick to any of
their promises anyway. And at other times,
Reagan asserts that his only real goal is to make
the Sandinistas stop supporting the rebels in El
Salvador.
The result is a patchwork of policies that are
confusing and really not supported by any suc
cessful foreign policy precedents. The Reagan ad
ministration is not defining to the Nicaraguan
people — or to the American people — exactly
what it is it wants from that Central American
country.
The mining of Nicaraguan harbors, and the ac
companying lack of concern in the CIA about ad
hering to legal standards, is even more confusing
to us. We are left wondering, just like Goldwater,
"What the hell is he doing?"
