## DUs a responsible fraternity 
### 
I am writing in response to the
article "DUs warned about
'aggressive behavior' " (Daily, April
11). Three points need to be em
phasized.
i
%
1.) There is an important differ
ence between Stanford dormitories
and fraternities. If a person living in a
dormitory is guilty of gross mis
behavior, then the University will
ta'ke direct disciplinary action against
that person. If a fraternity member
misbehaves, then the fraternity itself

has the collective responsibility to
discipline that member. If the frater
nity fails to take prompt action
against the offending member, up to
and including kicking him out of the
fraternity, then the entire fraternity
may come under fire from the Uni
versity.
2.) The Delta Upsilon fraternity
recently instituted a set of very tough
internal disciplinary measures to deal
with any member who may mis
behave. In the past 12 months, two
people have been expelled from the

fraternitv.
3.) A large majority of the people
who live in the Delta Upsilon house
are responsible, well-behaved
gentlemen. In my judgment, the DUs
are substantially above average in the
contributions they make to the Stan
ford University community. The
student body president is a DU. The
DU vice president is a Rhodes
Scholar.
