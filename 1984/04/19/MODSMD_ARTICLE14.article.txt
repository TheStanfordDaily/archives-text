## Good judgment prevails at Stanford

Columnist Diego Cordovez (Daily, April 6)
asked the question: Why the contradiction be
tween University Police policy regarding alcohol
usie by minors? It's a good question to raise just
now.
There are different policies about alcohol use
because different institutions created them.

VIEWPOINT

policies are justified when they
promote educational missions and safeguard the
quality of campus life. It makes no sense for Stan
ford to have policies merely to duplicate public
laws. Those who crafted the University policy on
alcohol many years ago found no compelling
reasons to address the use of alcohol on the basis
of age. They did find other matters to address; the
value of self-regulation; the need to discourage al
cohol abuse and to ensure that students (who are.
after all. adults) know of the public laws; and the
desire to protect members of the Stanford commu
nity. These are the foundations of Stanford's policy
which was designed to maintain the appropriate
educational environment.
ft would be a mistake to conclude that the ab
sence of a University rule about underage drinking
means that Stanford condones it. It doesn't. In
fact, the University has no policy at all about it.
A number of reasons probably account for
public laws: Public safety, prevailing notions of
morality and assuring that license fees, beverage
and sales taxes are assessed and paid. Even though
of these laws are way out of whack with
public norms of behavior, they remain on the
books and are enforced. As many know, enforce

ment is uneven — like enforcement of many laws.
But take care. The absence of regular enforcement
doesn't mean that the law is gone. It's still there.
That leads to another point. Stanford is not a
sanctuary from the enforcement of public laws.
Police, including the deputized members of the
Stanford Police, are sworn to enforce public laws.
Thus, some drivers may, and do, get cited for reck
less driving and driving under the influence, etc.,
even though the University may have not such laws
or rules.

It is a simple fact that large
public events where alcohol is
served will draw more attention
than small private events, such
as a dorm room. If minors are
being served at the large events,
or if anyone is served to excess,
the odds of escaping notice go
down and the odds of enforce
ment increase.

Most who violate the motor vehicle laws don't
get caught most of the time. Fair — no. Life — yes.

more public the event, the more likely the enforce
ment by police. It takes only a call from a disturbed
neighbor to complain about loud music to get them
there and to notice what is going on. If what is
going on is somehow unlawful, the police cannot
be expected to ignore it.
Civil law is another matter; it can be a broader
broom than criminal law. What happens when
someone who drinks too much at a party gets in a
car and crashes? Who's responsible? Who agonizes
over a death, a serious injury, a lost friend? Who
gets sued? Drivers, of course. Also those who did
the serving if those served were underage or left
the party drunk. The bucks in such matters are big
— very big. The real question, however,
transcends the law and material consequences.
Who wants a serious death or injury on their con
science? Worry about this more than the law. The
potential costs of irresponsibility are higher than
the costs of lawlessness when it comes to alcohol
related accidents.
Stanford is not a rule-conscious place. Many of
us hold to the Utopian idea that good judgment
and personal, collective responsibility are better
than big systems of rule enforcement. Generations
of Stanfordians have liked it that way, and for good
reason. It works well as long as most pitch in to
make it it work.
But let's not kid ourselves: We're not a tight
little island sheltered from public laws and their
enforcement.
