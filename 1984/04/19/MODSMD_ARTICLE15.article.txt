# Playing partisan politics
## 
### 
Two weekends ago Stanford hosted what organizers
called a " Public Policy Conference." It was billed as a non
partisan campaign against apathy designed to make stu
dents aware of important issues and to urge them to regis
ter to vote. But what was advertised differed greatly from
what was delivered.
What was delivered was a series of seminars which in
most cases amounted to little more than rallies against
present administration policies toward Central America,
the United Nations and draft registration among others.
The event's pervading theme was all too clear after at
tending seminars and voter registration workshops: Attack
the policies of the Reagan administration and register
voters who would most likely vote against Ronald Reagan
in November.
The Public Policy Conference appears to have been a
sort of Trojan Horse: Under the guise of a non-partisan
balanced presentation of the issues, the ASSU Lobby Of
fice along with various members of the Stanford Progres
sive Alliance, staged what amounted to a three-day high
budget political rally.
-When political groups at Stanford and anywhere else act
openly as advertised, they do nothing ethically objec
tionable. But when groups stoop to misrepresentation to
achieve their political goals as some did two weeks ago,
they exceed the bounds of legitimacy.
Admittedly, these are quite serious allegations, but
when one examines the actual events of the conference, it
is difficult to reach any other conclusion.
The conference's attempt to address the issue of Central
America was entitled, "An Urgent Choice For Central
America: The 1984 Elections." Those attending the semi
nar heard: a pro-rebel Salvadoran immigrant; a human
rights worker for the anti-Reagan administration Coalition
for a New Foreign and Military Policy (CNFMP); the
director of the Central America department of the
CNFMP: and a Catholic anti-U.S. military aid activist.
A more fitting title for the Central America seminar
would have been: "Oust Reagan in '84: U.S. out of
Central America," for each speaker, without exception,
denounced Reagan administration policies and called for
the United States to cut off military aid to the Salvadoran
government and Nicaraguan contras. Each speaker, too,
urged that Reagan be "booted out of office" and that "a
vote for Ronald Reagan is a vote for war in Central
America."
"Draft Registration and Financial Aid" consisted of a
registration resister and an anti-registration activist; both
univocally condemned Reagan administration policy.
At the seminar entitled "U.S. - UNESCO Relations,"
members of the audience heard a former U.S. representa
tive to UNESCO, a San Francisco State professor, and a
UNESCO representative from Bangladesh speak, again,
univocally against the recent administration decision to
withdraw from UNESCO.
Another session, "The Importance of Minority Partici
pation in 1984," amounted to nothing more than a cam
paign rally for Jesse Jackson and a barrage of ad hominum
attacks on Ronald Reagan — speakers called him a racist
and called for his removal from office. One speaker at the
seminar, Dick Gregory, went beyond attacks on Reagan in
his remarks, stating: "This vicious school we're at right
now is more dangerous than Ronald Reagan ... If God
came down to earth today he would destroy Stanford."
At almost every seminar, speakers called for targeting

prospectively anti-Reagan voters and registering them to
vote. The conference's voter registration workshops con
sisted mostly of traditional "how to" instruction — that is,
how to oust Ronald Reagan from office.
This event, erroneously named "Public Policy Confer
ence at Stanford," was not at all a conference on public
policy. It was a deplorable display of deception in advertis
ing — a three-day propaganda-fest that operated under an
umbrella of legitimacy. A title indicative of the confer
ence's events would have been "Rally Against Current
Domestic and Foreign Policy: Registration Drive to Oust
Reagan in '84."
One wonders how students could have organized such a
slanted slate of participants. The mystery fades when one
examines some of the seminars' organizers.
The session "An Urgent Choice for Central America"
was arranged by the Stanford Central American Action
Network — a group vigorously opposing military aid to
governments in the region and outspoken in its attacks
against the Reagan administration.
Stanford Against Conscription, an organization opposed
to the draft, registration and registration as a prerequisite
to aid awards, organized "Draft Registration and Financial
Aid."
Members of the Committee for U.S.-UNESCO Rela
tions (students against the U.S. pullout from UNESCO)
organized the seminar "U.S.-UNESCO Relations."
One seminar, however, broke from the mold of political
self-servitude that colored the conference's treatment of
the most urgent issues. "U.S. Foreign Policy in the Middle
East," organized jointly by the Hillel Club and the Com
mittee for Justice in Middle East, treated its audience
to two diametrically opposed speakers' views of U.S!
Middle East policy. Attenders of this balanced presenta
tion enjoyed a stimulating and informative debate;
audiences at most other seminars endured speaker's un
challenging pontifications.
Regrettably, the overwhelming majority of sessions
could aptly be described as partisan and slanted. If the
ASSU Lobby Office's goals were balanced presentations
of differing views on important issues, it failed miserably.
But one can legitimately doubt the Lobby Office's osten
sibly even-handed intentions in light of the abundant
evidence presented above — evidence that suggests
strongly that the Lobby Office had no intention of putting
on a neutral conference to combat apathy.
Partisan political groups were put in charge of "helping
to organize" events at a conference professed to be
balanced and non-partisan. These groups abused the
Public Policy Conference's forum of legitimacy with the
blessing of the ASSU Lobby Office.
The conference's organization reeks of administrative
irresponsiblity and abuse of power. It seriously un
dermines the legitimacy of the Lobby Office as a non
partisan group and also brings into question the ethics of
several political groups. At the very least, the Lobby Office
and certain groups have proven themselves unworthy of
student trust — and funding.
Especially disappointing is that the fiasco described
above took place at Stanford University — an institution
whose ostensible dedication to academic liberalism was as
saulted by the sham of two weekends ago.
