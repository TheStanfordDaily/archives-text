# Students hit polls as election closes
## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
An estimated 6200 students cast
ballots Tuesday and yesterday in the
ASSU election, and ASSU officials
say this is probably the largest voter
turnout since 1970.
Elections commissioner Phil Hal-

perin said the results of the election
will he announced tonight at 7 p.m. in
the ASSU Office in Tresidder Union.
Election workers tallied the write-in
votes last night, and the rest of the
votes will be counted by machine
today.
"Last year 39 percent of the stu
dents voted and this year we beat that

substantially," said Halperin.
Halperin said pressure on juniors to
vote for senior class president helped
account for the high voter turnout.
"The juniors turned out in droves,"
said Halperin. "There were 44 people
(on 11 slates) running for senior presi
dent which meant that one out of 40
juniors was running and there was a
tremendous amount of one-on-one
campaigning."
If no senior class president slate
receives more than 50 percent of the
vote, as seems likely, the run-off elec
tion between the top two slates will be
held Wednesday. According to Hal
perin, the two slates will be allowed to
spend an additional $25 campaigning
and will place half-page ads in The
Daily with their platforms.
Election officials cited an especially
high turnout among graduate students
and an increased awareness that stu
dents must vote to be eligible for fee
refunds as other factors contributing
