# Students hit polls as election closes
## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
An estimated 6200 students cast
ballots Tuesday and yesterday in the
ASSU election, and ASSU officials
say this is probably the largest voter
turnout since 1970.
Elections commissioner Phil Hal-

perin said the results of the election
will he announced tonight at 7 p.m. in
the ASSU Office in Tresidder Union.
Election workers tallied the write-in
votes last night, and the rest of the
votes will be counted by machine
today.
"Last year 39 percent of the stu
dents voted and this year we beat that

substantially," said Halperin.
Halperin said pressure on juniors to
vote for senior class president helped
account for the high voter turnout.
"The juniors turned out in droves,"
said Halperin. "There were 44 people
(on 11 slates) running for senior presi
dent which meant that one out of 40
juniors was running and there was a
tremendous amount of one-on-one
campaigning."
If no senior class president slate
receives more than 50 percent of the
vote, as seems likely, the run-off elec
tion between the top two slates will be
held Wednesday. According to Hal
perin, the two slates will be allowed to
spend an additional $25 campaigning
and will place half-page ads in The
Daily with their platforms.
Election officials cited an especially
high turnout among graduate students
and an increased awareness that stu
dents must vote to be eligible for fee
refunds as other factors contributing

to the high turnout.
"You know how those MBA stu
dents are," business student Mark
Mazur said. "When they get a dollar
waved in front of their face, they'll go
out and vote."
Reversing a previous trend, the
turnout on the second day was much
smaller than the first day."The rain
probably had something to do with it,
but I think people were just conscien
tious to vote on the first day," Hal
perin said.
John Hoffmire, the director of the
ASSU Lobby Office, said several stu
dent groups took advantage of their
access to voter receipts to call mem

bers of their group who had not voted.
"They probably made a few hundred
phone calls," he said.
However, Halperin questioned the
effectiveness of this tactic. "1 don't
think that had any true impact at all,"
he said. "They were calling about
1500 people who had been involved in
the groups and most of those people
probably would have voted anyway."
Several rumors concerning ques
tionable campaigning have been circu
lating, according to hearing officer
Kurt Zimmerman, who is responsible
for investigating campaign violations.
"However, 1 have not received any
sort of evidence that would lead me to
believe that a violation has occurred,"
he said. "I have heard rumors con
cerning all aspects of the campaign but
I have no evidence yet."

Halperin estimated the entire cost
of the election at about $12,500, with
the major expenses being the cost of
the ballots and the election handbook,
the manning of the polling places and
the salaries of officials involved in the
election. A run-off election for senior
class president would cost an addi
tional $700, he said. Expenditures for
those running were limited to $250 for
COP slates, $ 100 for senior class pres
ident slates, $75 for senate candidates
and $60 for candidates for the Student
Conduct Legislative Council.
"The only complaints I've received
about the campaign have come from
people saying we've turned the
campus into a trash can," said Hal
periri referring to the large number of
posters covering the campus.
"Candidates have three days to
remove these materials," he said,
"and if they don't, we'll shoot them. - '
