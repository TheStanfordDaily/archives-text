## Card nine itching to sweep UCLA 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sports writer 
The l«<st time the Stanford
bas'eball team had a six-game
winning streak going, it was in
the middle of a three-game
homestand against the UCLA
Bruins. The Card swept the
Bruins to push the string to
eight games.
On the other hand, the last
time the Cardinal visited Los
Angeles to play a few ballgames
it was rudely swept by USC.
Ironically, that trip ended the
aforementioned win streak,
which had reached nine in a
row.
If the past is any indication.
Stanford, now 28-iB-l overall,
in the Pacific-10 Southern
Division and winners of six
straight, will carry its "sweep

or-be-swept" banner to Los
Angeles when it begins a three
game series tonight at UCLA.
Stanford currently holds third
place in the conference, trailing
the nation's No. 1- and No. 3-
ranked teams, Arizona State
and USC, hy five and three
games, respectively. If the
standings remain the same.
ASU and USC will receive au
tomatic NCAA tournament bids
while the Cardinal will be com
peting for an at-large berth. An
other sweep might be nice for
the Card. In the six league se
ries in which the Card has
played, five have ended with
sweeps; Stanford was the
sweeper at home against UC-
Berkeley, UCLA and Arizona,
and the sweepee victimized by
USC and Arizona State.

The Bruins have been on the
short end of a few sweeps too.
With a 23-22 season record and
a 5-13 "Six-Pac" record, just
good enough to tie UC-
Berkeley for the conference cel
lar, the Bruins are out of the
hunt for any post-season playoff
spot.
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess, however, remains
wary of the Bruins, who were
once mentioned as title con
tenders.
*T think they're a much
stronger team than their record
indicates, especially offensively.
(Pete) Beall. (Lindsay) Meggs
and (Shane) Mack are their
power guys and they can present
a lot of problems for you."
Meggs has 1 1 home runs on
the year and Beall is hitting

.359. eighth host in the confer
ence. Hut Mack threatens op
posing pitchers most. He is the
league's third best hitter (.389).
second in home runs (14) and
fourth in runs batted in (44).
"As lie goes, so goes the
team," Marquess said of Mack.
"V ou want to be able to control
him because he is such a big part
ot their offense. You just hope
that lie doesn't get the big hit."
I hat's exactly what the Stan
ford pitching staff did when the
two teams first met, holding
Mack to a 6 for 20 series at the
plate with only one extra base
hit and three RBIs.
In Los Angeles lefty Jeff Bal
lard (5-4) and right-handers
John Radtke (6-1, 2.MM earned
run average) and Kevin Kunkel
(3-5) will get the call from
Marquess to stop Mack. Each of
these starters turned in out
standing performances a week
ago in Stanford's sweep of
Arizona.
Offensively, the Card has had
problems scoring runs of late —
only 14 in the last three contests
— despite a few hot bats in the
lineup.
Junior Mike Deßenon leads the
club in hitting with a .350
average. He is also the Card's
hottest hitter, ripping opposing
pitching to the tune of .423 in
his last 15 games.
The rest of the offensive
leaders are the same names as
usual — Rick Lundblade (.338
and 52 RBIs. second best in the
"Six-Pac"), Pete Stanicek
(.335), Ruben A-.naro, Jr.
(.333) and Darryl Stephens
(.331).
The first two games of the
UCLA series take place at night
and the third will be Saturday
afternoon. After a single-game
stop at Fresno State, Stanford
returns home next week for a
three-game set with USC.
ESPN television will be on hand
for the April 28 Saturday after
noon meeting and will rebroad
cast the contest on Sunday eve
ning April 29.
The Card will also be host to
the San Francisco Giants for an
exhibition game on Thursday
May 17. Call 497-1021 or 800-
BEAT CAL for ticket informa

Toi Cook hopes to run the basepaths frequently when the Cardinal faces UCLA in the first of
a three-game set tonight in Los Angeles. Stanford is hoping to sweep the Bruins, a feat it ac
complished earlier this year at Sunken Diamond, to keep its playoff hopes strong.
