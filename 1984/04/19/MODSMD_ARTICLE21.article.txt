Gettmg-up set
Stephen Blue rose high to set this ball and he'll have to do a lot more of the same if the
Cardinal expects to beat the University of Hawaii at Honolulu tomorrow in the second
of a two-game series in Hawaii. The Card dropped the first match last night in four sets,
5-15, 18-16, 6-15, 8-15, and could use a win in the season finale against its California
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association rival.
