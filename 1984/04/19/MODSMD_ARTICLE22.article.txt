# Tickets for Olympics still available

### 
•Los Angeles (AP) — A May 1 deadline
has been set for Americans ordering tickets
to the Summer Games, with 1.4 million
tickets still available to the public, Olympic
organizers said yesterday.
Acknowledgments confirming more than
320,000 ticket orders — totaling more than
3.4 million tickets and $80 million in reve
nue — will be mailed next week, according
to G. Edward Smith, vice president for tick
eting for the Los Angeles Olympic Organiz
ing Committee (LAOOC).
"Refunds where appropriate will be sent
the week after that," said Smith. About $15
million in refunds will be returned.
Sold-out events, including opening and

closing ceremonies at the Coliseum, now
number 10, with cycling, fencing and judo
joining the list.
Of the 368 ticketed sessions, 186 are sold
out — an increase of 63 sessions since No
vember, he said.
Only about half of the 600,000 tickets all
ocated for overseas purchase have been or
dered and the 40 to 50 countries that
haven't responded could lose their allot
ment if they fail to answer by mid-May, ac
cording to Harry Usher, LAOOC executive
vice president and general manager.
Those tickets would be made available for
some of the sold-out events or placed in the
bin for the U.S. general public.

A problem, he explained, has been in
communicating with the 155 countries since
the March 31 deadline passed for the na
tional Olympic committees.
In the case of North Korea, three at
tempts to send credentials were unsuccess
ful and many national Olympic committees
lack telex equipment, Usher said.
The 1.4 million tickets available are for
Southern California competition sites only.
They do not include several hundred
thousand soccer tickets being sold at An
napolis, Harvard University and Stanford.
Six soccer games will be played at An
napolis, six at Harvard, with nine days of
competition at Stanford.
