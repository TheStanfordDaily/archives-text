# Soviet complaints may mar Games
## 
### 
In the late 1960s a film en
titled The Russians Are
Coming played upon
America's of fear of commu
nist takeover. Today, the ex
act opposite is crossing this
land.
In the last couple of
i months the Soviet Union has
I openly criticized the upcom
; ing Summer Olympics to be
held in Los Angeles. Many
organizers feel that the im
plicit motivation is that the
Soviets are planning to
boycott the Games, just as
the United States did in
1980.
They have criticized the
amount of smog in L.A., the
level of security for the
Games (both high and low)
and even the so-called
"commercialization" of the
event.
; Despite the implicit fear of
i a Soviet backout, Los An
\ geles Olympic Organizing
Committee (LAOOC) chief
Peter Ueberroth said with
confidence that he thought
the Soviets would show. In
fact, an anonymous Soviet

source said, "Boycott is not
part of our vocabulary."
It is certainly hard to dis
agree with either one of
these persons. The Soviets
are firm believers in respect
through achievement, espe
cially athletic achievement.
This belief probably far out-

On Second
Thought
Jason Cole

weighs the incentive to stay
home because of "poor"
conditions.
Then why, you may ask
yourself, are the Soviets
being so critical? In fact, why
are they being so critical
when much of this criticism is
either somewhat foolish or
even contradictory?
For example, the indict
ment of L.A. air-quality
seems rather silly. The smog
levels in L.A. have not

changed since the location
was picked more than eight
years ago. Why wait until a
few months before the
Games to point out the prob
lem?
Another strange criticism
is that of security. The
Soviets have not only com
plained about it, they've
even contradicted them
selves. One Soviet athlete
claimed that security was so
low that he feared for his life,
while another athlete ques
tioned whether he could per
form at "gunpoint."
Two valid criticisms have
been that the LAOOC has
over-commercialized the
Games and that the U.S.
government was out of line
when it requested visas for
the Olympic entourage.
Commercialization, how
ever, has made this Olympics
nearly self-solvent. In fact,
the LAOOC has spent a
mere $610 million to the
Soviets' $9 billion in 1980.
The visa snafu is another
matter. In this case, the

Reagan administration stuck
its nose into something in
which it does not belong.
Historically, visas are never
required for Olympic offi
cials and athletes, such
people arc free to move at
will (with normal excep
tions). Requiring visas im
mediately sets up an aura of
distrust, something that
doesn't belong at the Olym
pics.
Why are the Soviets doing
this? That question probably
has several answers depend
ing on how you look at it.
They could be trying to
deflect criticism toward the
United States or trying to
embarrass the Reagan ad
ministration. The possible
scenarios vary quite substan
tially.
But the Soviets may be
doing themselves more harm
than good. Stupid criticisms
do nothing to support one's
cause. They only bring on
disrespect and anger from
the criticized party. The
Soviets should think a little
bit more before they act.
