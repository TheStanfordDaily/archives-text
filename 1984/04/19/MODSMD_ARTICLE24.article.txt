# Women face 'medium' UCSB
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis
team goes for win No. 20 this af
ternoon as the netters host UC-
Santa Barbara in a non
conference match.
The Cardinal got its 19th win
Tuesday with a 9-0 victory over
Cal State Long Beach. That was
a routine match for the Card, as
only one match went three sets,
and it gave Head Coach Frank
Brennan a chance to move his
lineup around some. Brennan
had a chance to get some
players from further down the
ladder into that match.

There is every indication that
today's match could be more of
the same. Brennan described
UCSB as "medium. They're
about the same as Long Beach,"
he said, "maybe just a little bit
better."
Tuesday's match also marked
the return to the Cardinal lineup
of Elise Burgin. The No. 2-
ranked singles player in the pre
season poll, Burgin teamed with
Linda Gates — the pair was
ranked second in the country in
doubles as well — and recorded
a 6-3, 6ro win at first doubles.
Burgin was not totally back to
form after a layoff of several

months, but at times showed her
old form.
After today's match the net
ters have only one dual match
remaining this season — the
regular-season finale at home
against UCLA on May 6. Priop
to that WCAA showdown, the
Card will travel south to th£
Ojai Collegiate Championships
next Thursday through Sunday
before returning home for a
mixed match with the men's
team versus UC-Berkeley on
May 5.
Today's match is scheduled
for 1:30 p.m. at the Varsity
Tennis Courts.
