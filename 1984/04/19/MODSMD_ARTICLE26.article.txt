Bloomington, Ind. (AP) — It's a foregone con
clusion that Georgetown's Patrick Ewing will he
the starting center for the U.S. Olympic basket
ball team.
Who will be his backup, though, is one of the
tough decisions facing Head Coach Bobby Knight
as he puts 72 players through trials this week at
Indiana University.
With the withdrawal from the trials of Ken
tucky big men Melvin Turpin and Sam Bowie
along with Memphis State's Keith Lee. and Hous
ton's Akeem Olajuwon being ineligible because
he's a Nigerian citizen, will there be enough beef
up front?
Especially since the Soviets — if they don't
boycott — could have a front line with players
measuring 7-foot-5 and 7-2.
Knight shrugged off the three withdrawals at a
news conference yesterday, saying. "I'm just glad
the vast majority of kids have things in a pretty
good priority, that they feel this (representing the
U.S.) is something they really like to do."
After morning and afternoon practice sessions,
the players were divided into four teams for last
night's scrimmage games — two were held simul
taneously followed by two more — with the media

and representatives of the National Basketball
Association teams on hand.
They played 70-minute games with brief
halftime breaks.
New York Knicks scout Dick McGuire, for one,
thought that Jon Koncak of Southern Methodist
and Joe Kleine of Arkansas played well in the
scrimmage and either could handle the center spot
for the U.S. team if Ewing needs a breather or is
in foul trouble.
"Both Koncak and Kleine can do the job."
McGuire said. "Without a doubt, we're so much
better than the other countries. We have the bet
ter athletes and there are plenty of them here."
Kleine, 6-1 1, 240, led the Razorbacks in
scoring and rebounding with marks of 1N.2 and
9.2 last season. Koncak, 7-0, 240, averaged 14.6
points and 1 1.5 rebounds in 1983-84.
Creighton Head Coach Willis Reed, who is one
of Knight's aides for the trials, said, "We may not
have the height to match the Russians, but we've
got great basketball players and we'll put out the
best team. Bobby (Knight) knows what it's all
about. He's got it well-organized."
