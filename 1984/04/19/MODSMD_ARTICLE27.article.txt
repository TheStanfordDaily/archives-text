### GEOFF SANBORN 
To paraphrase the words
of more than one exultant
Stanford entrant, "they got
in."
for all intents and
purposes, the Stanford wo
men's golf team locked up an
invitation to the NCAA
championships in In
nisbrook. Fla., yesterday
with a strong third-place
finish in the Phoenix-based
Lady Sun Devil Invitational.
"This tournament was the
last question mark." said an
extremely pleased Coach
Tim Baldwin. "After this, we
will definitely receive a bid."
The field the Cardinal
faced in Phoenix was as
tough as any the team has
gone up against all season.

and was in tact very similar
to the field of the Lady Mus
tang Roundup, a tournament
held last month in which
Stanford finished eighth. Un
der these circumstances.
Baldwin was all the more
euphoric about his team's
tinish in the tournament. "It
showed me that the girls are
capable of playing in the up
per level," said the fifth-year
coach.
The overall winner of the
54-hole tournament was
Tulsa, which finished with a
team total of N93. Holding
down second place was Stan
ford's major Pac-10 rival,
Arizona State, with a score
of K9B, followed by the Car
dinal at 91 1. Oklahoma State
at 915 and Lamar at 916.

On the individual side, the
tournament's low scorer was
Arizona State's Tina Tombs,
who finished with a one
over-par 2 14 on the par-71
course. The best numbers on
the Stanford side of the
scoreboard came from soph
omore Kathy Kostas, who
fired a 226. good for 10th
place.
Coming right behind
Kostas was freshman Kathy
McCarthy with a final total
of 227. followed by junior
Kathy Nino and freshman
Julie Carmichael at 229.
Junior Diane Nixon trailed at
a distance with a score of
253.
For Baldwin, one of his
team's most impressive and
encouraging achievements

came early in the final round
of play. Stanford was paired
with Tulsa and Arizona State
over the last 27 holes, and
after nine holes ot head-to
head play with the tourna
ment leaders, the Cardinal
stood only two strokes ott
the lead.
This kind of success
against the NCAA elite will
be a big psychological boost
for Stanford when the team
heads down to Innisbrook
for the three-day champion
ship beginning May 23.
"Now we're going to walk in
there with our heads held
high," he said.
Stanford's final tourna
ment before Innisbrook will
be the WCAA Champion
ships, to be held in San
Diego beginning on April 25.
