## Wealth of vocal talent in 'The Mikado' 
### NANCY HENRY 
The objective of an operetta, particularly a Gilbert and Sul
livan operetta, is to entertain. The songs, the singing and the
comic timing determine success or failure. "The Mikado,"
presented by the Stanford Savoyards, upholds that group's
high musical standards and is consistently entertaining.
For these reasons, it is possible to overlook certain flaws
such as the uninspired choreography and occasionally listless
acting, and to call the play a qualified success. It is worth
seeing for the exceptional wealth of vocal talent alone, but
there are other equally impressive qualities to recommend it.
The plot is, of course, nonsensical, the characters hilarious
stereotypes. The Mikado is the ruler of Japan, and the charac
ters belong to the court of his "Lord High Executioner, Ko
Ko." I he tact that "The Mikado" is set in Japan merely
means that the makeup, costume and set design combine to
create a rather unconvincing oriental atmosphere. The songs
and the satirical nature of the play provide plenty of opportu
nities for the characters to distinguish themselves.
Several do, and they make "The Mikado" something spe
cial. Chief among these is William Marshall as Pooh-Bah, of
noble birth and unparalleled prominence at court. If anyone
comes close to stealing the show, it is Marshall. As the regal,
superior and uncompromising (unless offered the right price)
adviser to Ko Ko and the "retailer of state secrets," he dis
plays a powerful presence, magnificent voice and precise
comic timing. Whether bullying the nervous and cowardly
Lord High Executioner, ably played for full comic effect by
Geordie Lawry, or conducting a debate between his multiple
personalities; Lord Chief Justice vs. First Lord of the Trea
sury, Official Counselor vs. the Archbishop and Commissar
of Police, etc. (none of whom are above taking a bribe), Mar
shall gives a first rate and memorable performance.
He and Lawry are supported but not matched by Jamie
Carlin as Nankie-Pooh and Mary Workman as Yum Yum, the
melodramatic and naive young lovers around whose
frustrated attempts to be together the plot revolves. Both are
rather colorless characters and lack the vitality that might
have lent some life to their roles. Yum Yum, for example, is
put to shame by the energy with which Michele Collopy plays
the small part of Peep-80. Carlin and Workman do, however,
hold their own when putting their lovely well-trained voices
to use.
The second act clearly outshines the first. The musical
numbers involve fewer people and are thus more easily
managed. They flow more smoothly and reveal the true
quality of the singing. Two new major characters are intro
duced, and both contribute to the success of act two. Susan
Squires as the sinister, frighteningly ugly Katisha, an older
woman with designs on Nanki-Pooh, and Rick Dehmel as the
mighty Mikado are certainly the most visually striking charac

ters. Dynamic and dominating figures, their not-so-subtle
game of one-upmanship, played with the entire cast on stage,
is one of the night's most sparkling moments. Katisha
proclaims the superiority of the Daughter-in-Law Fleet (her
title) Over the Mikado himself, and the confused chorus must
first bow to one, then to the other as commanded. Squires and
Dehmel seem to enjoy themselves, taking full advantage of
the hamming-up their roles permit.
The "Symphonious Orchestra," as the program reads, skill
fully accompanies the choral numbers. Though the percus
sions occasionally rise to drown out the voices, this was rare,
and the volume and timing were expertly controlled by con
ductor Dan Powers. The chorus, always of major significance,
provides humor, commentary and beautiful harmony, all of
which more than make up for its somewhat awkward move
ment on stage.
Overall, "The Mikado" is an admirable accomplishment. It
is probably not the cleverest nor the most musically
memorable of the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, but it is rep
resentative, always amusing and occasionally hilarious. This
version is not perfect. It starts off slowly and must overcome
several mediocre performances; however, a few exceptional
individual efforts, combined with the general quality of the
music, make for an enjoyable evening of theater.
