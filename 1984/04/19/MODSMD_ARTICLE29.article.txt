# San Jose Rep's 'School for Scandal' polished
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
Articulation and flair mark the San
Jose Repertory Company's production
of "The School for Scandal," currently
playing at the Montgomery Theater until
April 29. Written in 1777 by Richard
Brinsley Sheridan, the plot revolves
around such contrivances as mistaken
rumors, greediness and so-called high
fashion in London. jjgi'jMWTriL l
The elderly Sir Peter Teazle marries a
rustic country girl and brings her home,
where she soon learns from Lady Sneer
well's school for the snide. The latter, in
league with Joseph Surface, spreads
rumors of Lady Teazle's infidelity with
Joseph's brother Charles, who will
Teceive a fortune from their Uncle
. .'Oliver, and who is engaged to Sir
I Teazle's ward Maria.
; Joseph wishes to incriminate the free
spirited Charles and gain Maria, and
|[ Lady Sneerwell covets Charles' love and
| inheritance. Meanwhile, Uncle Oliver
| returns from a long absence in India and
| resolves to test the characters of his ne
| phews. Masquerading as a usurer, he goes

to the prodigal Charles, who offers to sell
off all his ancestral portraits — except
that of his uncle!
The plot congeals for the hypocritical
Joseph when Sir Teazle catches him
seducing Lady Teazle — in a mar
velously fun scene with people behind
screens and in (closets. The final unravel
ing, of course, brings everyone into one
room on stage, where the true
scandalmongers and the true lovers are
exposed.

This comedy of English manners and
society requires a consistent and quick
pace, as well as versatile expressions
from the actors, since much of the play is
witty dialogue. In this, director Julian
Lopez-Morillas succeeds admirably, for
even the numerous scene changes are in
corporated into the main plot action. The
butler. Trip (snootily played by Ed
Dubbs), arrogantly pantomimes supervi
sion of the maids; in the Inst few scene
changes, however, they make him do the
moving. It is a delightful touch, and feeds
the slightly malicious wit which
Sheridan's comedies often evoke.
The enunciation of all the players —
except perhaps Mrs. Candour (Molly
Mayock), who tended to trade articula
tion for appropriate flamboyance — was
excellent. Although Sheridan's witty
lines take some tuning of the ear to
catch, this company makes the process
rhuch easier. They not only deliver the
given lines, but also significant gestures
to enhance the complicated interplay
onstage.
It's a polished performance, and the

timing is right on — never a dull, inactive
moment, though there is plenty of poten
tial for "Scandal" to become solely
pointed-and-humorous dialogue.
One particularly clever blocking move
was when Sir Benjamin Backbite and his
Uncle Crabtree began lambasting a
mutual acquaintance in Lady Sneerwell's
parlor. The two pivot on their canes and
alternatingly deliver diatribes to the au
dience. n
The acting is highly stylized, and the
troupe throws itself into the mannerisms
with a glee which Sheridan might ap
plaud. Especially notable is the bit part
of the snivelling Snake, played by J.
Stephen Coyle. Snake is the journalist
who supplies the smut, yet comes out in
the end for truth; Coyle drew the most
laughs for his two entrances onstage —
his movements emulating a reptile, with
an occasional flick of the tongue.
This production of "School for Scan
dal" is fine entertainment by a talented
company, and definitely worth an eve
ning in town.
