# USW approves Local 680
## Recognition bout continues in wake of vote 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
The 1321-member bargaining unit of the United Stan
ford Workers (USW) yesterday approved a measure that
USW officials claim will make Local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) the bargaining
unit's legal representative in its collective agreement with
the University.
The 630-125 vote will sever a four-year affiliation with
SEIU's Local 715, a 9000-member union serving Santa
Clara County, according to USW officials.
The election was held yesterday and conducted by the
American Arbitration Association, an outside group that
specializes in union elections. Secret ballots were available
for all bargaining unit members at Tresidder Union, the
Medical Center and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter (SLAC).
According to Dennis Blake, USW treasurer, the work
site polling places were used to "obtain and encourage the
maximum voter turnout." Blake added that he was
"satisfied with our decision."
According to Mary Ann Tenuto, labor consultant to

USW, yesterday's turnout was "just amazing." Tenuto
said the turnout represented "the most people we have
had voting in any election since we have had the union"
and approximately twice the number that voted in the af
filiation election in 1980.
"It's just an overwhelming show of support and all of us
are just thrilled," she added.
The landslide election is the latest step in a four-month
battle between USW and the University over USW's
desire — and the University's refusal — to be represented
by Local 6,80 rather than 715.
USW received its charter in 1973 as Local 680. In
1980, the bargaining unit voted to affiliate with Local 715.
According to Tenuto, the affiliation was undertaken be
cause of administrative considerations.
Under Local 715's leadership USW went on a five-week
strike, the longest in the union's 11-year history, in 1982.
The strike ended with the bargaining unit accepting a pro
posal roughly equivalent to the one the University offered
before the walkout.
In a move designed to increase
USW autonomy, the present union
leadership was elected last year on a
platform that promised to begin disaf
filiation proceedings. The newly
elected executive committee gathered
more than 500 signatures on a petition
asking for a disaffiliation vote.
In February, the 800,000 member
International gave back Local 680's
charter and officials of Local 715
asked Stanford to accept Local 680 as
the legal representative of the bar
gaining unit.
The University refused to recognize
officials of Local 680 as representa

ti\es of the bargaining unit and filed
untair labor practice charges with the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) against both locals for disaf
filiating without a vote.
University officials said that Local
680 would not be recognized until a
vote of disaffiliation was taken in ac
cordance with federal labor law.
In response, USW decided to con
duct a referendum election for ap
proval. According to USW officials,
an election approving the transfer of
collective bargaining rights was far
easier and quicker than pursuing
litigation.
Kim Waldron, a representative of
the SEIU in Washington D.C., echoed
this belief. "It's a strong and quick
way to settle the concerns Stanford
has," she said. Waldron affirmed that
the election was a "valid and legal"

procedure of transferring representa
tion.
After University officials stated that
the validity of the election was in
question and declared that Local 680
may not be recognized regardless of
the outcome of the election. USW
filed unfair labor practice charges
against the University. Union officials
claimed that statements by University
officials constituted "illegal inter
ference" in internal union matters and
were conscious attempts to "disrupt
and sabotage the election."
Yesterday's ballot was worded as
follows: "Do you want Stanford Uni
versity to recognize United Stanford
Workers, Service Employees Interna
tional Union Local 680, for purposes
of collective bargaining on your be
half, and to administer and enforce
your current contract?"
University Staff Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler told The Daily last week that
a ballot worded in that manner would
not change the University's position
regarding Local 680. Wheeler said
that an affirmative vote would be
meaningless because it "would not be
a valid election."
Tenuto disagreed. She said that
there was "no question as to its (the
election's) propriety."
"I expect the University to honor
the wishes of its employees," Tenuto
said. "If they believe in democracy
they have no choice but to recognize
680," she added.
USW President Linda Crouse
agreed. "USW workers have sent a
clear message to Stanford that they
want Local 680 recognized as their
bargaining agent. Stanford challenged
us to this election. Now, we challenge
Stanford to respect our democratically
expressed wishes," she said.

USW, yesterday's turnout was "just amazing." Tenuto
said the turnout represented "the most people we have
had voting in any election since we have had the union"
and approximately twice the number that voted in the af
filiation election in 1980.
"It's just an overwhelming show of support and all of us
are just thrilled," she added.
The landslide election is the latest step in a four-month
battle between USW and the University over USW's
desire — and the University's refusal — to be represented
by Local 6,80 rather than 715.
USW received its charter in 1973 as Local 680. In
1980, the bargaining unit voted to affiliate with Local 715.
According to Tenuto, the affiliation was undertaken be
cause of administrative considerations.
Under Local 715's leadership USW went on a five-week
strike, the longest in the union's 11-year history, in 1982.
The strike ended with the bargaining unit accepting a pro
posal roughly equivalent to the one the University offered
before the walkout.
In a move designed to increase
USW autonomy, the present union
leadership was elected last year on a
platform that promised to begin disaf
filiation proceedings. The newly
elected executive committee gathered
more than 500 signatures on a petition
asking for a disaffiliation vote.
In February, the 800,000 member
International gave back Local 680's
charter and officials of Local 715
asked Stanford to accept Local 680 as
the legal representative of the bar
gaining unit.
The University refused to recognize
officials of Local 680 as representa

ti\es of the bargaining unit and filed
untair labor practice charges with the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) against both locals for disaf
filiating without a vote.
University officials said that Local
680 would not be recognized until a
vote of disaffiliation was taken in ac
cordance with federal labor law.
In response, USW decided to con
duct a referendum election for ap
proval. According to USW officials,
an election approving the transfer of
collective bargaining rights was far
easier and quicker than pursuing
litigation.
Kim Waldron, a representative of
the SEIU in Washington D.C., echoed
this belief. "It's a strong and quick
way to settle the concerns Stanford
has," she said. Waldron affirmed that
the election was a "valid and legal"

procedure of transferring representa
tion.
After University officials stated that
the validity of the election was in
question and declared that Local 680
may not be recognized regardless of
the outcome of the election. USW
filed unfair labor practice charges
against the University. Union officials
claimed that statements by University
officials constituted "illegal inter
ference" in internal union matters and
were conscious attempts to "disrupt
and sabotage the election."
Yesterday's ballot was worded as
follows: "Do you want Stanford Uni
versity to recognize United Stanford
Workers, Service Employees Interna
tional Union Local 680, for purposes
of collective bargaining on your be
half, and to administer and enforce
your current contract?"
University Staff Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler told The Daily last week that
a ballot worded in that manner would
not change the University's position
regarding Local 680. Wheeler said
that an affirmative vote would be
meaningless because it "would not be
a valid election."
Tenuto disagreed. She said that
there was "no question as to its (the
election's) propriety."
"I expect the University to honor
the wishes of its employees," Tenuto
said. "If they believe in democracy
they have no choice but to recognize
680," she added.
USW President Linda Crouse
agreed. "USW workers have sent a
clear message to Stanford that they
want Local 680 recognized as their
bargaining agent. Stanford challenged
us to this election. Now, we challenge
Stanford to respect our democratically
expressed wishes," she said.
