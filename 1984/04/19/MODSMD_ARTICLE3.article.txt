# USW approves Local 680
## Recognition bout continues in wake of vote 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
The 1321-member bargaining unit of the United Stan
ford Workers (USW) yesterday approved a measure that
USW officials claim will make Local 680 of the Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) the bargaining
unit's legal representative in its collective agreement with
the University.
The 630-125 vote will sever a four-year affiliation with
SEIU's Local 715, a 9000-member union serving Santa
Clara County, according to USW officials.
The election was held yesterday and conducted by the
American Arbitration Association, an outside group that
specializes in union elections. Secret ballots were available
for all bargaining unit members at Tresidder Union, the
Medical Center and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter (SLAC).
According to Dennis Blake, USW treasurer, the work
site polling places were used to "obtain and encourage the
maximum voter turnout." Blake added that he was
"satisfied with our decision."
According to Mary Ann Tenuto, labor consultant to

USW, yesterday's turnout was "just amazing." Tenuto
said the turnout represented "the most people we have
had voting in any election since we have had the union"
and approximately twice the number that voted in the af
filiation election in 1980.
"It's just an overwhelming show of support and all of us
are just thrilled," she added.
The landslide election is the latest step in a four-month
battle between USW and the University over USW's
desire — and the University's refusal — to be represented
by Local 6,80 rather than 715.
USW received its charter in 1973 as Local 680. In
1980, the bargaining unit voted to affiliate with Local 715.
According to Tenuto, the affiliation was undertaken be
cause of administrative considerations.
Under Local 715's leadership USW went on a five-week
strike, the longest in the union's 11-year history, in 1982.
The strike ended with the bargaining unit accepting a pro
posal roughly equivalent to the one the University offered
before the walkout.
