# 'El Norte' requires act of political faith
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
El Norte tells the story of two
young Guatemalans, brother
and sister, whose village is
wiped out by the army in
response to stirrings of revolt
among the oppressed peasants.
Forced to pass as Mexicans be
cause of anti-Indian sentiment,
Rosa and Enrique use the pitiful
savings of their godmother (one
of the few survivors in their
home village) to travel into
Mexico and — illegally, with the
aid of an outlaw guide, or
"coyote" — into Calfornia, the
land of promise the
Guatemalans call "el norte"
("the north"). There they con
tinue to struggle against poverty
and discrimination while living
in terror of the unpredictable
appearances of immigration of
ficers.
The tale of Enrique and Rosa
is an authentic tragedy, and the
appalling details of lives led in
chains in one country, in squalor
in another and in fear in a third
certainly demand to be treated
by filmmakers. One admires
Gregory Nava, the director, and
his wife, Anna Thomas, the
screenwriter — they co
produced the picture — for their
persistence in working on a
project of such questionable
commercial potential. It took
them five years to complete, and
they had to surmount
unthought-of obstacles to do so;
at one point, during a shoot in
Mexico, some of the negatives
were seized by gunmen.
But devotion and integrity
and right-mindedness don't nec
essarily produce good movies.

and El Norte is an enervating
one. Sitting through all of it (it
runs nearly two and a half
hours) may be an act of political
faith, but it offers little aesthetic
or sensual pleasure.
Nava and Thomas have
structured the film as an epic
melodrama, with one-third of
the action transpiring in each lo
cation; wherever Rosa and En
rique try to survive, the self
serving and the intolerant gang
up on them — bloodthirsty sol
diers, murderous thieves,

rate them or corrupt their
ideals. Yet they fight on against
overwhelming odds, until finally
Enrique confronts the seductive
American route to success: He
has a chance at a job that may
earn him his green card but
would mean leaving his ailing
sister behind.
By this point, we have no
doubt about what his decision
will be. Has anyone ever really
believed in these noble peasant
icons that have been with us
since the intellectuals of the left
invented them in the 19305?
Steinbeck couldn't turn them
into flesh-and-blood characters,
and in the famous 1954 film Salt
of the Earth, about Chicano zinc
miners on strike in New Mexico,
the simple, moral workers who
made the flowers bloom in their
rented yard and listened to clas
sical music on their radio (their
single luxury) until the creditors
took it away were so saintly that
you turned your head away in
embarrassment.
Watching Salt of the Earth
was an act of political faith, too,
because the director, Herbert
Biberman, lacked a sense of
drama and a sense of beauty,
and because the actors were un
believably rigid; almost all non
professionals, they wore their
inexperience like a badge of
honor. And wasn't there some
thing slightly condescending in
this canonization of "the little
people"?
El Norte is infinitely more
vivid than Salt of the Earth — it
has a glittering shot of L.A. by
night that looks like the
filmmakers constructed a neon
lit toy city, and the leading
actress, Zaide Silvia Guitierrez,
sings a mourning song at her fa
ther's funeral that conveys real
power — but its portrayal of its
plebeian hero and heroine raises

the same question.
In movies, strong social or pi}rj
litical content often presents it
self in the form of melodrama
and a number of such films

Gregory Nava is really a
pedestrian dramatist:
technically unsophisticated. h>|f
doesn't indulge his lyrical sida :
very far (though the
Guatemalan scenes cry out for a
primal, bleeding Garcia Lore#
kind of imagery), and he doesn'j:
have the first clue to how to,
direct his actors.
Except for Stella Ouan as the
godmother and Lupe Outiveros
as Nacha, who befriends Rosa at
an L.A. laundry where they
work together, the acting is
painfully amateurish. Both
these actresses, playing canny,
resilient women, get to display
some wit; /aide Silvia Guitier
rez and David Villalpando, as
Enrique, barely register on the
human scale — they smile those
smiles of boundless endurance
and remind each other with
Joadian conviction that they
must go on.
The closest Nava ever comes
to successful melodrama is one
scene in which Rosa and En
rique cross the Mexican-U.S.
border through a dark tunnel. In
the middle of the tunnel
(actually a long barrel) a troop
of rats scampers across their
path; there seem to be
thousands of them, and Nava in
tercuts this horrendous
proliferation with shots of a
helicopter above the tunnel,
casting its searchlights below in
quest of illegal aliens. But even
this sequence, which is effective
in a primitive way, undercuts it
self: The rats disappear as sud
denly as they came, and though
the incident is to have repercus
sions later in the film, at that
moment the protagonists look
barely injured — just a little
grimy from all that crawling.

thinking of the scene in The
Birds in which Tippi Hedren
walks into an attic full of
screaming, vengeful birds and
escapes with only the odd
scratch. El Norte inspires the
kind of reverential acceptance

Norte isn't likely ever to be seen
by an audience that would laugh
appreciatively at Nava's
blunder. But I couldn't help
thinking of the scene in The
Birds in which Tippi Hedren
walks into an attic full of
screaming, vengeful birds and
escapes with only the odd
scratch. El Norte inspires the
kind of reverential acceptance
no real filmmaker would ever
demand.
El Norte tells the story of two
young Guatemalans, brother
and sister, whose village is
wiped out by the army in
response to stirrings of revolt
among the oppressed peasants.
Forced to pass as Mexicans be
cause of anti-Indian sentiment,
Rosa and Enrique use the pitiful
savings of their godmother (one
of the few survivors in their
home village) to travel into
Mexico and — illegally, with the
aid of an outlaw guide, or
"coyote" — into Calfornia, the
land of promise the
Guatemalans call "el norte"
("the north"). There they con
tinue to struggle against poverty
and discrimination while living
in terror of the unpredictable
appearances of immigration of
ficers.
The tale of Enrique and Rosa
is an authentic tragedy, and the
appalling details of lives led in
chains in one country, in squalor
in another and in fear in a third
certainly demand to be treated
by filmmakers. One admires
Gregory Nava, the director, and
his wife, Anna Thomas, the
screenwriter — they co
produced the picture — for their
persistence in working on a
project of such questionable
commercial potential. It took
them five years to complete, and
they had to surmount
unthought-of obstacles to do so;
at one point, during a shoot in
Mexico, some of the negatives
were seized by gunmen.
But devotion and integrity
and right-mindedness don't nec

one. Sitting through all of it (it
runs nearly two and a half
hours) may be an act of political

or sensual pleasure.
Nava and Thomas have
structured the film as an epic
melodrama, with one-third of
the action transpiring in each lo

rate them or corrupt their
ideals. Yet they fight on against
overwhelming odds, until finally
Enrique confronts the seductive
American route to success: He
has a chance at a job that may
earn him his green card but
would mean leaving his ailing
sister behind.
By this point, we have no
doubt about what his decision
will be. Has anyone ever really
believed in these noble peasant
icons that have been with us
since the intellectuals of the left
invented them in the 19305?
Steinbeck couldn't turn them
into flesh-and-blood characters,
and in the famous 1954 film Salt
of the Earth, about Chicano zinc
miners on strike in New Mexico,
the simple, moral workers who
made the flowers bloom in their
rented yard and listened to clas
sical music on their radio (their
single luxury) until the creditors
took it away were so saintly that
you turned your head away in
embarrassment.
Watching Salt of the Earth
was an act of political faith, too,
because the director, Herbert
Biberman, lacked a sense of
drama and a sense of beauty,
and because the actors were un
believably rigid; almost all non
professionals, they wore their
inexperience like a badge of
honor. And wasn't there some
thing slightly condescending in
this canonization of "the little
people"?
El Norte is infinitely more
vivid than Salt of the Earth — it
has a glittering shot of L.A. by
night that looks like the
filmmakers constructed a neon
lit toy city, and the leading
actress, Zaide Silvia Guitierrez,
sings a mourning song at her fa
ther's funeral that conveys real
power — but its portrayal of its
plebeian hero and heroine raises

the same question.

litical content often presents it

Gregory Nava is really a
pedestrian dramatist:
technically unsophisticated. h>|f
doesn't indulge his lyrical sida :
very far (though the
Guatemalan scenes cry out for a
primal, bleeding Garcia Lore#
kind of imagery), and he doesn'j:
have the first clue to how to,
direct his actors.
Except for Stella Ouan as the
godmother and Lupe Outiveros
as Nacha, who befriends Rosa at
an L.A. laundry where they
work together, the acting is
painfully amateurish. Both
these actresses, playing canny,
resilient women, get to display
some wit; /aide Silvia Guitier
rez and David Villalpando, as
Enrique, barely register on the
human scale — they smile those
smiles of boundless endurance
and remind each other with
Joadian conviction that they
must go on.
The closest Nava ever comes
to successful melodrama is one
scene in which Rosa and En
rique cross the Mexican-U.S.
border through a dark tunnel. In
the middle of the tunnel
(actually a long barrel) a troop
of rats scampers across their
path; there seem to be
thousands of them, and Nava in
tercuts this horrendous
proliferation with shots of a
helicopter above the tunnel,
casting its searchlights below in
quest of illegal aliens. But even
this sequence, which is effective
in a primitive way, undercuts it
self: The rats disappear as sud
denly as they came, and though
the incident is to have repercus
sions later in the film, at that
moment the protagonists look
barely injured — just a little
grimy from all that crawling.
