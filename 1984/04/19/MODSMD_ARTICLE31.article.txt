# 'Moscow on the Hudson' an astonishing, masterful film
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Paul Mazursky's magnificent
Moscow on the Hudson could be
called You Can't Go Home
Again. In it. Vladimir Ivanoff
(Robin Williams), a saxophonist
with a Moscow circus playing a
New York tour, decides at the
last moment to defect — in
Bloomingdale's, where the Rus
sian performers have been per
mitted 30-minutes' shopping
time.
The personnel at
Bloomingdale's who assist him
in eluding the grasp of the So
viet officials also forge his initial
link to America: Lionel Wither
spoon (Cleavant Derricks), a
black security guard, offers him
a temporary home in his fam
ily's Harlem apartment, and
Lucia (Maria Conchita Alonso),
an Italian saleswoman, becomes
his lover.
The first part of the film, set
in Moscow (and performed in
Russian, with English subtitles),
shows us how the mediocrity of
Vladimir's existence and the
constant overarching presence
of the KGB instill a spirit of
revolt in him without his realiz
ing it's there, so that when his
best friend, the circus clown
Anatoly (Elya Baskin), who has
sworn to defect during the tour,
finds he lacks the courage to do
so. Vladimir finds he can act in
Anatoly's place — the combina
tion of his slowly mounting dis
gust at Soviet life and his full
hearted response to what he
sees in America have already
made the decision for him. The
second section concerns his ad
justment to America and how
he copes with the loss of his old
life, his old identity.
On one level Moscow on the
Hudson deals with the move
ment from repression to
freedom, what freedom implies
and what its constraints and
contradictions are, and on an
other level it's a comedy about
the seductive appeal of Ameri
can decadence for Russians, like

Ninotchka was. But that is the
simplest (and least original) of
the movie's themes.
Centrally, Mazursky and his
co-writer Leon Capetanos are
interested in what happens to a
man who makes the choice to
cut himself off from home and
family forever. The entire story
is written from Vladimir's point
of view,, so when he waves
goodbye to Anatoly outside
Bloomingdale's, we see the
clown for the last time, too, and

family responds to the news of
his defection, or if thev ever

receive the letters he writes
them every week. Mazursky
doesn't force us to examine
Vladimir's self-imposed root
lessness the way a more conven
tional director might; there's no
single moment when Vladimir
suddenly confronts the meaning
of what he has done and
despairs. (Just the fact that the
movie is about something more
complex than the joys of
embracing freedom in America
distinguishes it from a lyrical en
tertainment like Ninotchka.)
Instead, the sadness Vladimir
must inevitably accept as a part
of his choice creeps up on us, as
it creeps up on him. Like
Mazursky's best pictures from
the 1970s — Blume in Love,
Harry and Tonto, Next Stop,
Greenwich Village — Moscow
on the Hudson has a melancholy
undertone that takes over the
movie, though you couldn't say
exactly when. Vladimir's affec
tion for Lionel's acid-tongued
grandfather (Tiger Haynes),
who reminds him (though he
never says so) of his own: the

unanswered letters to Moscow
we hear in voice-overs; his in
volvement with the Russian im
migrant community in New
York — all of these elements
suggest Vladimir's attempts to
rediscover what he has given up.
"I hated my life in Moscow, hut
I loved my misery, because it
was mine and I could hold it,"
he tells Lionel.
Mazursky's last film, Tempest,
was mostly a disaster, hut it had
one extraordinarily funny, off
the-cuff scene in it, in which a
group of Japanese tourists ap
plauded Jewish musicians in a

nightclub in Greece. The TV
newswoman who covers
Vladimir's defection in Moscow
on the Hudson is an Asian,
Kaity Tong, and everyone
Vladimir comes in contact with
is transplanted from somewhere
else — Lucia, his Cuban lawyer
Orlando Ramirez (Alejandro
Rey), doctors and cab drivers
and immigration officers, and
even Lionel, who tells the TV
cameras, "I'm a refugee from
Alabama; 1 know how the brot
her feels."
Mazursky and Capetanos are
concerned with the problem of
assimilation. Lucia, who came
over to the U.S. under the spon
sorship of an aunt and uncle, has
an accent as thick as Vladimir's,
but she dreams of a career in
sportscasting or newscasting,
like Kaity Tong's, and she
resists the increasing closeness
of her relationship with
Vladimir because he doesn't fit
into the dream — he's not suffi
ciently "American."
Mazursky is a warm, funny,
life-embracing director but he's

also a realist; he respects Lucia's
dream but he knows it isn't
likely to come true, and that un
derstanding informs a number
of the scenes between Lucia and
Vladimir in a touching, painful
way. Vladimir and Lucia and all
the other immigrants we meet
have hurled themselves into the
melting pot, but the glimpses
Mazursky offers us of the old
Italian mamas on the porch
after the celebration of Lucia's
newly acquired citizenship
remind us that we carry our first
homes with us all our lives.
Robin Williams gave a ter
rific, full-scale comic perfor
mance in last year's The Sur
vivors, but his only previous
dramatic role, Garp, didn't
stimulate him to do the kind of
acting his amazing comedy
routines on TV and in clubs in
dicated he was capable of. Wil
liams' childlike approach to
Garp — he looked like a super
annuated baby — was rather
sweet, and he had some lovely
moments (like the scene in
which he scrawled a crayon face
on his pregnant wife's belly),
but he did nothing startling. As
Vladimir, he wears a thick black
beard that lends him a thick
Russian bear look (stripped to
the waist, he looks even more
bear-like, because his chest and
arms are covered in black hair),
and he's buried in his character;
this emotionally full,
demonstrative Soviet sax player
is an ideal part for an actor of
Williams' energy and comic im
agination — for someone who's
bursting at the seams — but you
don't catch Robin Williams the
television comedian peeking
through that beard.
Vladimir's eyes twinkle like
Mork's did, but they are crossed
with pain, and when Vladimir
speaks English, it's an authentic
Russian immigrant's English,
not a schtick. Even his voice
sounds different here (especially
in the Moscow scenes) —
deeper and less fey. It's a bril

liant performance, as eloquent
in the early, attentive scenes
when Vladimir registers silently
the indignities he experiences in
the Soviet Union as in the New
York scenes, where, free to ex
press himself, he unleashes his
personality. (It's one of the fas
cinating incidental illuminations
of this movie that when
Vladimir gives vent to his emo
tions, behaving in an ex
troverted way he defines as es
sentially Russian, he does what
he was never actually permitted
to do in his native Russia.)
The whole cast is marvelous
— Cleavant Derricks, hoarse
voiced Maria Conchita Alonso,
Tiger Haynes (who doesn't get
to do enough), Savely
Kramarov as Boris, the circus
manager, and especially Elya
Baskin as Anatoly and Alexan
der Beniaminov as Vladimir's

renegade grandfather.
Mazursky coaxes hyperbolic
performances out of these two,
as he has in the past with some
of his supporting players, most
memorably Shelley Winters as
Lenny Baker's overbearing mo
ther in Next Stop, Greenwich
Village.
Baskin does the first tragic
clown number in years that
doesn't come across as a
platitude, and hawk-eyed
Beniaminov provides in just a
couple of scenes a vivifying
portrait of an old man, a one
time comedian, who hasn't per
mitted age or monotony to dull
his perceptions — whose anti
establishment grumbling
represents a living, unrepressed
spirit. Vladimir has his grandfat
her in him, of course. Their
scenes together are effervescent
and intimate in a way that noth
ing else in the film is — they
execute a vocal improvisation
based (loosely) on "Take the
'A' Train" at one point, and at
another, when Vladimir returns
to the apartment late after an
evening of lovemaking, laughing
with remembered pleasure, the
old man throws one arm ground
his grandson, claps his hand on
the young lover's mouth to keep
him from waking up the house,
and tells him a conspiratorial
whisper, "There are whores in
Gorky Park who have carved
my name on the trees."
When Mazursky's in high
gear, few directors can touch
him. At the end of the Moscow
section, Vladimir plays his
saxophone where he can find
the most privacy — in the circus
stable, where the camels and
zebras watch him in wonder.
The camera tracks way up into
the sky and descends again,
down the length of a giant bill
board depicting Abe Lincoln
wearing a pair of earphones and
above him the slogan, "All
stereophones are not created
equal." That may be the wittiest
transitional shot in recent
American movies.
The scene that follows — the
Muscovites' first glimpse of
decadent America — could
hardly be better. Mazursky
carries off an amazingly tricky
sequence in which Lucia and
other immigrants recite the
citizenship oath (tricky because
it borders on the sentimental)

and comes so close to succeed
ing with an even riskier scene, in
a coffee shop peopled entirely
by customers of different ethnic
origins, that the attempt takes
your breath away. He rarely
miscalculates — there's a dis
pensable bit involving a gay
clerk at Bloomingdale's and an
encounter with a Texan on his
first trip to New York that
doesn't clinch, but no other
scenes come to mind that don't
enrich the film in some way.
Sometimes, Mazursky
engages so many emotional
tracks simultaneously that you
can't analyze exactly which ele
ment is affecting you most
profoundly. Lionel has a child
back in Alabama he's never
seen, and at Vladimir's urging
he takes a trip home; Vladimir,
now working as a chauffeur,
drives him to the airport, and
Lionel says goodbye to him in
Russian and sets off with a fur
hat on his head. This beautiful
scene made me weep, but 1
wasn't sure why — whether 1
was moved by the departure of
Vladimir's closest friend since
Anatoly, or by the way in which
they seemed to swap identities,
or by the fact that Lionel was
able fo do what Vladimir never
could.
The words "home" and
"leave" resonate in half a dozen
ways in this astonishing movie,
which goes on playing in your
head long after you've left the
theater. 1 loved it in a very spe
cial way — the way in which,
perhaps, you can only love Paul
Mazursky's movies, because
they have a distinctly urban
ethnic comic temperament
coupled with a Chekhovian
feeling for the small tragedies of
human beings. But he lost his
way for a while — An Un
married Woman, commercially
successful though it was, took its
subject awfully seriously, and
both Willie and Phil and
Tempest played like ideas for
movies: They had no emotional
focus. His last good picture, the
autobiographical Next Stop,
Greenwich Village, came out in
1976, but Moscow on the Hud
son was worth the 8-year wait.
Perhaps the greatest irony in
this tenderly ironic film is that in
making a movie about the im
possibility of returning home,
Mazursky has done just that.

demonstrative Soviet sax player
is an ideal part for an actor of
Williams' energy and comic im
agination — for someone who's
bursting at the seams — but you
don't catch Robin Williams the
television comedian peeking
through that beard.
Vladimir's eyes twinkle like
Mork's did, but they are crossed
with pain, and when Vladimir
speaks English, it's an authentic
Russian immigrant's English,
not a schtick. Even his voice
sounds different here (especially
in the Moscow scenes) —
deeper and less fey. It's a bril

liant performance, as eloquent
in the early, attentive scenes
when Vladimir registers silently
the indignities he experiences in
the Soviet Union as in the New
York scenes, where, free to ex
press himself, he unleashes his
personality. (It's one of the fas
cinating incidental illuminations
of this movie that when
Vladimir gives vent to his emo
tions, behaving in an ex
troverted way he defines as es
sentially Russian, he does what
he was never actually permitted
to do in his native Russia.)
The whole cast is marvelous
— Cleavant Derricks, hoarse
voiced Maria Conchita Alonso,
Tiger Haynes (who doesn't get
to do enough), Savely
Kramarov as Boris, the circus
manager, and especially Elya
Baskin as Anatoly and Alexan
der Beniaminov as Vladimir's

renegade grandfather.
Mazursky coaxes hyperbolic
performances out of these two,
as he has in the past with some
of his supporting players, most
memorably Shelley Winters as
Lenny Baker's overbearing mo
ther in Next Stop, Greenwich
Village.
Baskin does the first tragic
clown number in years that
doesn't come across as a
platitude, and hawk-eyed
Beniaminov provides in just a
couple of scenes a vivifying
portrait of an old man, a one
time comedian, who hasn't per
mitted age or monotony to dull
his perceptions — whose anti
establishment grumbling
represents a living, unrepressed
spirit. Vladimir has his grandfat
her in him, of course. Their
scenes together are effervescent
and intimate in a way that noth
ing else in the film is — they
execute a vocal improvisation
based (loosely) on "Take the
'A' Train" at one point, and at
another, when Vladimir returns
to the apartment late after an
evening of lovemaking, laughing
with remembered pleasure, the
old man throws one arm ground
his grandson, claps his hand on
the young lover's mouth to keep
him from waking up the house,
and tells him a conspiratorial
whisper, "There are whores in
Gorky Park who have carved
my name on the trees."
When Mazursky's in high
gear, few directors can touch
him. At the end of the Moscow
section, Vladimir plays his
saxophone where he can find
the most privacy — in the circus
stable, where the camels and
zebras watch him in wonder.
The camera tracks way up into
the sky and descends again,
down the length of a giant bill
board depicting Abe Lincoln
wearing a pair of earphones and
above him the slogan, "All
stereophones are not created
equal." That may be the wittiest
transitional shot in recent
American movies.
The scene that follows — the
Muscovites' first glimpse of
decadent America — could
hardly be better. Mazursky
carries off an amazingly tricky
sequence in which Lucia and
other immigrants recite the
citizenship oath (tricky because
it borders on the sentimental)

and comes so close to succeed
ing with an even riskier scene, in
a coffee shop peopled entirely
by customers of different ethnic
origins, that the attempt takes
your breath away. He rarely
miscalculates — there's a dis
pensable bit involving a gay
clerk at Bloomingdale's and an
encounter with a Texan on his
first trip to New York that
doesn't clinch, but no other
scenes come to mind that don't
enrich the film in some way.
Sometimes, Mazursky
engages so many emotional
tracks simultaneously that you
can't analyze exactly which ele
ment is affecting you most
profoundly. Lionel has a child
back in Alabama he's never
seen, and at Vladimir's urging
he takes a trip home; Vladimir,
now working as a chauffeur,
drives him to the airport, and
Lionel says goodbye to him in
Russian and sets off with a fur
hat on his head. This beautiful
scene made me weep, but 1
wasn't sure why — whether 1
was moved by the departure of
Vladimir's closest friend since
Anatoly, or by the way in which
they seemed to swap identities,
or by the fact that Lionel was
able fo do what Vladimir never
could.
The words "home" and
"leave" resonate in half a dozen
ways in this astonishing movie,
which goes on playing in your
head long after you've left the
theater. 1 loved it in a very spe
cial way — the way in which,
perhaps, you can only love Paul
Mazursky's movies, because
they have a distinctly urban
ethnic comic temperament
coupled with a Chekhovian
feeling for the small tragedies of
human beings. But he lost his
way for a while — An Un
married Woman, commercially
successful though it was, took its
subject awfully seriously, and
both Willie and Phil and
Tempest played like ideas for
movies: They had no emotional
focus. His last good picture, the
autobiographical Next Stop,
Greenwich Village, came out in
1976, but Moscow on the Hud
son was worth the 8-year wait.
Perhaps the greatest irony in
this tenderly ironic film is that in
making a movie about the im
possibility of returning home,
Mazursky has done just that.


Newfound best friend Cleavant Derrick embraces Robin Williams, who stars as a Russian
defector to America in "Moscow on the Hudson."
Paul Mazursky's magnificent
Moscow on the Hudson could be
called You Can't Go Home
Again. In it. Vladimir Ivanoff
(Robin Williams), a saxophonist
with a Moscow circus playing a
New York tour, decides at the
last moment to defect — in
Bloomingdale's, where the Rus
sian performers have been per
mitted 30-minutes' shopping
time.
The personnel at
Bloomingdale's who assist him
in eluding the grasp of the So
viet officials also forge his initial
link to America: Lionel Wither
spoon (Cleavant Derricks), a
black security guard, offers him
a temporary home in his fam
ily's Harlem apartment, and
Lucia (Maria Conchita Alonso),
an Italian saleswoman, becomes
his lover.
The first part of the film, set
in Moscow (and performed in
Russian, with English subtitles),
shows us how the mediocrity of
Vladimir's existence and the
constant overarching presence
of the KGB instill a spirit of
revolt in him without his realiz
ing it's there, so that when his
best friend, the circus clown
Anatoly (Elya Baskin), who has
sworn to defect during the tour,
finds he lacks the courage to do
so. Vladimir finds he can act in
Anatoly's place — the combina
tion of his slowly mounting dis
gust at Soviet life and his full
hearted response to what he
sees in America have already
made the decision for him. The
second section concerns his ad
justment to America and how
he copes with the loss of his old
life, his old identity.
On one level Moscow on the
Hudson deals with the move
ment from repression to
freedom, what freedom implies
and what its constraints and
contradictions are, and on an
other level it's a comedy about
the seductive appeal of Ameri
can decadence for Russians, like

Ninotchka was. But that is the
simplest (and least original) of
the movie's themes.
Centrally, Mazursky and his
co-writer Leon Capetanos are
interested in what happens to a
man who makes the choice to
cut himself off from home and
family forever. The entire story
is written from Vladimir's point
of view,, so when he waves
goodbye to Anatoly outside
Bloomingdale's, we see the
clown for the last time, too, and
wc never learn how Vladimir's
family responds to the news of
his defection, or if thev ever

receive the letters he writes
them every week. Mazursky
doesn't force us to examine
Vladimir's self-imposed root
lessness the way a more conven
tional director might; there's no
single moment when Vladimir
suddenly confronts the meaning
of what he has done and
despairs. (Just the fact that the
movie is about something more
complex than the joys of
embracing freedom in America
distinguishes it from a lyrical en
tertainment like Ninotchka.)
Instead, the sadness Vladimir
must inevitably accept as a part
of his choice creeps up on us, as
it creeps up on him. Like
Mazursky's best pictures from
the 1970s — Blume in Love,
Harry and Tonto, Next Stop,
Greenwich Village — Moscow
on the Hudson has a melancholy
undertone that takes over the
movie, though you couldn't say
exactly when. Vladimir's affec
tion for Lionel's acid-tongued
grandfather (Tiger Haynes),
who reminds him (though he
never says so) of his own: the

unanswered letters to Moscow
we hear in voice-overs; his in
volvement with the Russian im
migrant community in New
York — all of these elements
suggest Vladimir's attempts to
rediscover what he has given up.
"I hated my life in Moscow, hut
I loved my misery, because it
was mine and I could hold it,"
he tells Lionel.
Mazursky's last film, Tempest,
was mostly a disaster, hut it had
one extraordinarily funny, off
the-cuff scene in it, in which a
group of Japanese tourists ap
plauded Jewish musicians in a

nightclub in Greece. The TV
newswoman who covers
Vladimir's defection in Moscow
on the Hudson is an Asian,
Kaity Tong, and everyone
Vladimir comes in contact with
is transplanted from somewhere
else — Lucia, his Cuban lawyer
Orlando Ramirez (Alejandro
Rey), doctors and cab drivers
and immigration officers, and
even Lionel, who tells the TV
cameras, "I'm a refugee from
Alabama; 1 know how the brot
her feels."
Mazursky and Capetanos are
concerned with the problem of
assimilation. Lucia, who came
over to the U.S. under the spon
sorship of an aunt and uncle, has
an accent as thick as Vladimir's,
but she dreams of a career in
sportscasting or newscasting,
like Kaity Tong's, and she
resists the increasing closeness
of her relationship with
Vladimir because he doesn't fit
into the dream — he's not suffi
ciently "American."
Mazursky is a warm, funny,
life-embracing director but he's

also a realist; he respects Lucia's
dream but he knows it isn't
likely to come true, and that un
derstanding informs a number
of the scenes between Lucia and
Vladimir in a touching, painful
way. Vladimir and Lucia and all
the other immigrants we meet
have hurled themselves into the
melting pot, but the glimpses
Mazursky offers us of the old
Italian mamas on the porch
after the celebration of Lucia's
newly acquired citizenship
remind us that we carry our first
homes with us all our lives.
Robin Williams gave a ter
rific, full-scale comic perfor
mance in last year's The Sur
vivors, but his only previous
dramatic role, Garp, didn't
stimulate him to do the kind of
acting his amazing comedy
routines on TV and in clubs in
dicated he was capable of. Wil
liams' childlike approach to
Garp — he looked like a super
annuated baby — was rather
sweet, and he had some lovely
moments (like the scene in
which he scrawled a crayon face
on his pregnant wife's belly),
but he did nothing startling. As
Vladimir, he wears a thick black
beard that lends him a thick
Russian bear look (stripped to
the waist, he looks even more
bear-like, because his chest and
arms are covered in black hair),
and he's buried in his character;
this emotionally full,
demonstrative Soviet sax player
is an ideal part for an actor of
Williams' energy and comic im
agination — for someone who's
bursting at the seams — but you
don't catch Robin Williams the
television comedian peeking
through that beard.
Vladimir's eyes twinkle like
Mork's did, but they are crossed
with pain, and when Vladimir
speaks English, it's an authentic
Russian immigrant's English,
not a schtick. Even his voice
sounds different here (especially
in the Moscow scenes) —
deeper and less fey. It's a bril

liant performance, as eloquent
in the early, attentive scenes
when Vladimir registers silently
the indignities he experiences in
the Soviet Union as in the New

cinating incidental illuminations
of this movie that when
Vladimir gives vent to his emo

troverted way he defines as es
sentially Russian, he does what
he was never actually permitted
to do in his native Russia.)

Tiger Haynes (who doesn't get

Kramarov as Boris, the circus

Baskin as Anatoly and Alexan
der Beniaminov as Vladimir's

renegade grandfather.

memorably Shelley Winters as

Lucia (Maria Conchita Alonso),
an Italian saleswoman, becomes
his lover.
The first part of the film, set
in Moscow (and performed in
Russian, with English subtitles),
shows us how the mediocrity of
Vladimir's existence and the
constant overarching presence
of the KGB instill a spirit of
revolt in him without his realiz
ing it's there, so that when his
best friend, the circus clown
Anatoly (Elya Baskin), who has
sworn to defect during the tour,
finds he lacks the courage to do
so. Vladimir finds he can act in
Anatoly's place — the combina
tion of his slowly mounting dis
gust at Soviet life and his full
hearted response to what he
sees in America have already
made the decision for him. The
second section concerns his ad
justment to America and how
he copes with the loss of his old
life, his old identity.
On one level Moscow on the
Hudson deals with the move
ment from repression to
freedom, what freedom implies
and what its constraints and
contradictions are, and on an
other level it's a comedy about
the seductive appeal of Ameri
can decadence for Russians, like

Ninotchka was. But that is the
simplest (and least original) of
the movie's themes.
Centrally, Mazursky and his
co-writer Leon Capetanos are
interested in what happens to a
man who makes the choice to
cut himself off from home and
family forever. The entire story
is written from Vladimir's point
of view,, so when he waves
goodbye to Anatoly outside
Bloomingdale's, we see the
clown for the last time, too, and

receive the letters he writes
them every week. Mazursky
doesn't force us to examine
Vladimir's self-imposed root
lessness the way a more conven
tional director might; there's no
single moment when Vladimir
suddenly confronts the meaning
of what he has done and
despairs. (Just the fact that the
movie is about something more
complex than the joys of
embracing freedom in America
distinguishes it from a lyrical en
tertainment like Ninotchka.)
Instead, the sadness Vladimir
must inevitably accept as a part
of his choice creeps up on us, as
it creeps up on him. Like
Mazursky's best pictures from
the 1970s — Blume in Love,
Harry and Tonto, Next Stop,
Greenwich Village — Moscow
on the Hudson has a melancholy
undertone that takes over the
movie, though you couldn't say
exactly when. Vladimir's affec
tion for Lionel's acid-tongued
grandfather (Tiger Haynes),
who reminds him (though he
never says so) of his own: the

unanswered letters to Moscow
we hear in voice-overs; his in
volvement with the Russian im
migrant community in New
York — all of these elements
suggest Vladimir's attempts to
rediscover what he has given up.
"I hated my life in Moscow, hut
I loved my misery, because it
was mine and I could hold it,"
he tells Lionel.
Mazursky's last film, Tempest,
was mostly a disaster, hut it had
one extraordinarily funny, off
the-cuff scene in it, in which a
group of Japanese tourists ap
plauded Jewish musicians in a

nightclub in Greece. The TV
newswoman who covers
Vladimir's defection in Moscow
on the Hudson is an Asian,
Kaity Tong, and everyone
Vladimir comes in contact with
is transplanted from somewhere
else — Lucia, his Cuban lawyer
Orlando Ramirez (Alejandro
Rey), doctors and cab drivers
and immigration officers, and
even Lionel, who tells the TV
cameras, "I'm a refugee from
Alabama; 1 know how the brot
her feels."
Mazursky and Capetanos are
concerned with the problem of
assimilation. Lucia, who came
over to the U.S. under the spon
sorship of an aunt and uncle, has
an accent as thick as Vladimir's,
but she dreams of a career in
sportscasting or newscasting,
like Kaity Tong's, and she
resists the increasing closeness
of her relationship with
Vladimir because he doesn't fit
into the dream — he's not suffi
ciently "American."
Mazursky is a warm, funny,
life-embracing director but he's

also a realist; he respects Lucia's
dream but he knows it isn't
likely to come true, and that un
derstanding informs a number
of the scenes between Lucia and
Vladimir in a touching, painful
way. Vladimir and Lucia and all
the other immigrants we meet
have hurled themselves into the
melting pot, but the glimpses
Mazursky offers us of the old
Italian mamas on the porch
after the celebration of Lucia's
newly acquired citizenship
remind us that we carry our first
homes with us all our lives.
Robin Williams gave a ter
rific, full-scale comic perfor
mance in last year's The Sur
vivors, but his only previous
dramatic role, Garp, didn't
stimulate him to do the kind of
acting his amazing comedy
routines on TV and in clubs in
dicated he was capable of. Wil
liams' childlike approach to
Garp — he looked like a super
annuated baby — was rather
sweet, and he had some lovely
moments (like the scene in
which he scrawled a crayon face
on his pregnant wife's belly),
but he did nothing startling. As
Vladimir, he wears a thick black
beard that lends him a thick
Russian bear look (stripped to
the waist, he looks even more
bear-like, because his chest and
arms are covered in black hair),
and he's buried in his character;
this emotionally full,
demonstrative Soviet sax player
is an ideal part for an actor of
Williams' energy and comic im
agination — for someone who's
bursting at the seams — but you
don't catch Robin Williams the
television comedian peeking
through that beard.
Vladimir's eyes twinkle like
Mork's did, but they are crossed
with pain, and when Vladimir
speaks English, it's an authentic
Russian immigrant's English,
not a schtick. Even his voice
sounds different here (especially
in the Moscow scenes) —
deeper and less fey. It's a bril

liant performance, as eloquent
in the early, attentive scenes
when Vladimir registers silently
the indignities he experiences in
the Soviet Union as in the New
York scenes, where, free to ex
press himself, he unleashes his
personality. (It's one of the fas
cinating incidental illuminations
of this movie that when
Vladimir gives vent to his emo
tions, behaving in an ex
troverted way he defines as es
sentially Russian, he does what
he was never actually permitted
to do in his native Russia.)
The whole cast is marvelous
— Cleavant Derricks, hoarse
voiced Maria Conchita Alonso,
Tiger Haynes (who doesn't get
to do enough), Savely
Kramarov as Boris, the circus
manager, and especially Elya
Baskin as Anatoly and Alexan
der Beniaminov as Vladimir's

renegade grandfather.
Mazursky coaxes hyperbolic
performances out of these two,
as he has in the past with some
of his supporting players, most
memorably Shelley Winters as
Lenny Baker's overbearing mo
ther in Next Stop, Greenwich
Village.
Baskin does the first tragic
clown number in years that
doesn't come across as a
platitude, and hawk-eyed
Beniaminov provides in just a
couple of scenes a vivifying
portrait of an old man, a one
time comedian, who hasn't per
mitted age or monotony to dull
his perceptions — whose anti
establishment grumbling
represents a living, unrepressed
spirit. Vladimir has his grandfat
her in him, of course. Their
scenes together are effervescent
and intimate in a way that noth
ing else in the film is — they
execute a vocal improvisation
based (loosely) on "Take the
'A' Train" at one point, and at
another, when Vladimir returns
to the apartment late after an
evening of lovemaking, laughing
with remembered pleasure, the
old man throws one arm ground
his grandson, claps his hand on
the young lover's mouth to keep
him from waking up the house,
and tells him a conspiratorial
whisper, "There are whores in
Gorky Park who have carved
my name on the trees."
When Mazursky's in high
gear, few directors can touch
him. At the end of the Moscow
section, Vladimir plays his
saxophone where he can find
the most privacy — in the circus
stable, where the camels and
zebras watch him in wonder.
The camera tracks way up into
the sky and descends again,
down the length of a giant bill
board depicting Abe Lincoln
wearing a pair of earphones and
above him the slogan, "All
stereophones are not created
equal." That may be the wittiest
transitional shot in recent
American movies.
The scene that follows — the
Muscovites' first glimpse of
decadent America — could
hardly be better. Mazursky
carries off an amazingly tricky
sequence in which Lucia and
other immigrants recite the
citizenship oath (tricky because
it borders on the sentimental)

and comes so close to succeed
ing with an even riskier scene, in
a coffee shop peopled entirely
by customers of different ethnic
origins, that the attempt takes
your breath away. He rarely
miscalculates — there's a dis
pensable bit involving a gay
clerk at Bloomingdale's and an
encounter with a Texan on his
first trip to New York that
doesn't clinch, but no other
scenes come to mind that don't
enrich the film in some way.
Sometimes, Mazursky
engages so many emotional
tracks simultaneously that you
can't analyze exactly which ele
ment is affecting you most
profoundly. Lionel has a child
back in Alabama he's never
seen, and at Vladimir's urging
he takes a trip home; Vladimir,
now working as a chauffeur,
drives him to the airport, and
Lionel says goodbye to him in
Russian and sets off with a fur
hat on his head. This beautiful
scene made me weep, but 1
wasn't sure why — whether 1
was moved by the departure of
Vladimir's closest friend since
Anatoly, or by the way in which
they seemed to swap identities,
or by the fact that Lionel was
able fo do what Vladimir never
could.
The words "home" and
"leave" resonate in half a dozen
ways in this astonishing movie,
which goes on playing in your
head long after you've left the
theater. 1 loved it in a very spe
cial way — the way in which,
perhaps, you can only love Paul
Mazursky's movies, because
they have a distinctly urban
ethnic comic temperament
coupled with a Chekhovian
feeling for the small tragedies of
human beings. But he lost his
way for a while — An Un
married Woman, commercially
successful though it was, took its
subject awfully seriously, and
both Willie and Phil and
Tempest played like ideas for
movies: They had no emotional
focus. His last good picture, the
autobiographical Next Stop,
Greenwich Village, came out in
1976, but Moscow on the Hud
son was worth the 8-year wait.
Perhaps the greatest irony in
this tenderly ironic film is that in
making a movie about the im
possibility of returning home,
Mazursky has done just that.


Newfound best friend Cleavant Derrick embraces Robin Williams, who stars as a Russian
defector to America in "Moscow on the Hudson."
Paul Mazursky's magnificent
Moscow on the Hudson could be
called You Can't Go Home
Again. In it. Vladimir Ivanoff
(Robin Williams), a saxophonist
with a Moscow circus playing a
New York tour, decides at the
last moment to defect — in
Bloomingdale's, where the Rus
sian performers have been per
mitted 30-minutes' shopping
time.
The personnel at
Bloomingdale's who assist him
in eluding the grasp of the So
viet officials also forge his initial
link to America: Lionel Wither
spoon (Cleavant Derricks), a
black security guard, offers him
a temporary home in his fam
ily's Harlem apartment, and
Lucia (Maria Conchita Alonso),
an Italian saleswoman, becomes
his lover.
The first part of the film, set
