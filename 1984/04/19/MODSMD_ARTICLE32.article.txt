# Mazursky stresses freedom, not patriotism
## 
### STACEY WAYNE 
Los Angeles — Robin Williams and Paul
Mazursky attribute their success with Moscow
on the Hudson to believing in the movie's char
acters. Filming in Russia and working with
defected Russian actors enabled both men to
understand the problems of defectors. Wil
liams' character, Vladimir Ivanoff, is miserable
in Moscow because as Williams put it, "it's so
hard to jam with the KGB."
Vladimir longs for freedom, but Mazursky
stresses in his film and his comments that
defecting does not bring instant happiness. "1
interviewed a lot of (defected) Russians before
starting the movie," he said, "and many of
them are very lonely and unhappy here."
However, Mazursky also wanted to capture
the enthusiasm some of the Russians had for
American freedom and extravagant living. He
based much of Williams' character on a Rus
sian saxophonist named Wally West. In the
film, Vladimir lives in West's shabby New
York apartment which is not an example of
American decadence, but according to Wil
liams, it is part of his American dream..
"Remember the American flag shower cur
tains you saw in the movie," he said, "we
didn't add those. They were really his."
This love of freedom comes out in almost
every character in the film, but Mazursky
stressed that he did not intend for his film to be
patriotic. That he might be criticized for being
too sentimental angered Mazursky. He argued,
"I can't be accused of being patriotic after pro
testing against our government with people
like Jane Fonda. I know that action alone
earned me a file with the FBI."

He feels Moscow on the Hudson shows both
the good and the bad sides of American life,
unlike films like Missing which he considers
"too black and white." M , ~
Robin Williams takes this "serious
— like everything — more lightly than his
director. He joked that he can't expect his per
formance to stop people from calling him
Mork, but perhaps it will make some smaller
impact. He believes his success portraying
Vladimir resulted more from understanding
what it means to be an immigrant in the 1980s
than from learning the saxophone and Russian.
Williams remembers his Russian lessons as
"five months at five hours a day locked in a
small room with a man named David." As for
his proficiency on the saxophone, Williams
said that after 20 takes of the scene where he
plays in the stable, "the elephant started
crying."
If anything, it was his ineptness at the Rus
sian language that let Williams understand the
frustration immigrants like Vladimir have with
English. "Any time you stick your neck out
like that it is going to make you understand,"
he explained. "You feel like saying don't
mind-fuck me and they're thinking tell him this
fork is a spoon. OK. Then you won't mind
being killed with a spoon."
Williams is unsure about his next film. He
said he would like something with a bathtub
scene like the one in Moscow with Maria Con
chita, but with "more bubbles" ("Maria kept
asking me what is that in my back and wouldn't
believe a microphone.") Other possibilities are
Deep Bambi or Robin Williams is Ella
Fitzgerald.


Robin Williams frequently bursts out in laughter during
a press conference at Columbia's Burbank Studios.
