# Caterpillars bug campus

You're fidgeting in that straight
backed chair as your professor
drones on with a soporific
monotone that would make a
presidential campaign speech
melodramatic by comparison.
Suddenly you come to life as
your eye catches a small furry crea
ture crawling through the hair of
the blonde who sits in front of you
at every lecture.
It traverses from her left ear to
her right ear, overcoming a great
obstacle at a triple-braid running
down the center of her scalp. She
continues to take notes furiously,
unaware of the new being that has
found comfort in her presence.
Now it is crawling on her ear,

causing an entire row of students
behind her to cringe as they recall a
gruesome scene from Star Trek II:
The Wrath of Khan.
Then, WH AP! Her arm rises and
quickly crushes the creature into
oblivion.
What, you ask, was that furry
being which seems more common
around campus during springtime
than prospective ASSU senators'
flyers?
None other than the dreaded oak
moth, a tiny insect that, in its cur
rent stage of development,
manifests itself as a caterpillar
which hangs from, and eats the
leaves of, oak trees.
Or, for science buffs, that was
none other than an arthropoda in

secta lepidoptera in the larvae
stage.
While the caterpillars can be
found all over the campus area, the
most traditionally infested areas in
clude Crothers Memorial, Annen
berg Auditorium and Hoover
Tower.
Although these insects, when en
countered in great numbers, may
be frightening, there is no evidence
to justify any feelings of threat. Ex
perts here say the creatures are as
scared of humans as are humans of
them.
According to most, the oak moth
in this stage is neither dangerous
nor particularly altruistic. In fact, it
has been known to live for itself,
rarely to show any affection for
others.

Caterpillars have recently made their traditional appearance on the Farm and have caused the usual
nuisances for everyone.
