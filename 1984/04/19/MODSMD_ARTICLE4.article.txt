# Says Hoover issue is 'played out'
## Juilland won't fight petition 
### PETER HAVEN 
French and Italian Prof. Alphonse
Juilland, who authored a counterpeti
tion last year to a petition calling for
an investigation of the ties between
the University and the Hoover Institu
tion, will not answer a similar appeal
currently being circulated.
Juilland spearheaded a response last
year to the initial petition by Political
Science Prof. John Manley and En
glish Prof. Ronald Rebholz. The
Manley-Rebholz petition called
Hoover a politically partisan institu
tion in violation of University policy.
But Juilland, saying the issue is now
"played out," will not respond to a
second Manley-Rebholz petition call
ing for an independent visiting com
mittee to look into the University's re
lationship with Hoover. That petition
I was rcccntly signed by 104 faculty
members.
"I wish I could (say) that, if I felt
like it, I could easily collect two times
as many signatures on a new counter
petition," Juilland said. "The truth is
that I fear for my health. If I had the
gall to approach my friends with an
other request for another signature on
another Hoover counterpetition,
they'd belt me in the mouth or kick me
in the groin.
"The issues raised in the last peti
tion have been raised again and again
and have been discussed again and
again in every imaginable medium and
body of this University," Juilland said.
Juilland also said the Board of Trus
tees committee appointed to investi

gate the Hoover-University relation
ship "ought to be left alone to do its
work."
Manley and Rebholz have called
into question the objectivity of that
committee. Three of its five members
serve on the Hoover Board of Over
seers, Rebholz said.
"When in a small committee like

this there are representatives from two
sides, both the overseers and the trus
tees, one has to question their objec
tivity in judging the Hoover issue,"
said Rebholz.
Rebholz said he felt the decision by

Juilland not to initiate a counterpeti
tion was unfortunate because it would
not help open up debate between the
University and Hoover.
"It's a pity. I always thought his
counterpetition last year was useful
for stirring up debate," Rebholz said.
"General campus debate is good, and
neither the trustee's committee nor
the six-person group appointed by
Donald Kennedy to advise them have
opened up any debate.
"Given the actions of the trustees
and the president, they seem deter
mined not to allow reasonable discus
sion, " Rebholz said.
But Juilland did not entirely rule
out the possibility of future action on
his part, saying that he might consider
another petition should he perceive a
threat to "conservatives in the Quad."
'•/ cut me- out txscnuae I wus pi uvoAo/
by Mr. Ma nicy and Mr. Rebholz and
their friends," he said. "I value my
skin. If I feel that it's in danger, I'll do
what I can to protect it,"he said.
Rebholz said his petition is confined
to the "political philosophy" of
Hoover and is not directed at individ
uals.
Acccording to Juilland, the cam
paign by Manley and Rebholz against
the Hoover Institution is going
"nowhere."
"Obviously, these gen 'emen
(Manley and Rebholz) enjoy this
game. And they're going to keep
playing it as long as they enjoy it. I
think they lost to me a long time ago,"
he said.
