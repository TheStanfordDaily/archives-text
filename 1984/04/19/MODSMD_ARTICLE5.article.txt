# Experts offer graphic porn presentation
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Psychiatry Prof. Herant Katchadourian told an
audience of about 50 at Governor's Corner last
night that certain forms of pornographic material
may elicit sexual violence.
Speaking with Katchadourian, in a presentation
entitled "Pornography: Another Victimless
Crime?," was Cheryl Lawrence, a Ph.D. candidate
in the Psychology Department here. She said she
agreed that violence may result from certain types
of pornography, noting that "pornography has
become more commonplace, more socially accep
table, and more violent" in the last decade.
Both Lawrence and Katchadourian referred to a
1970 study which found no evidence that pornog
raphy caused violence, but both speakers said
today's "new" pornography would change those
results.
Katchadourian, author ot a textbook on human
sexuality, addressed the general question of "How
to decide what is legally pornographic?" He said
there are two views of the answer to this: one citing
portrayals of explicitness or nudity as illegal and
the other calling depictions of unacceptable sexual
behavior illegal.
"Is it sex or the use to which sex is put that con
stitutes pornography," the vice provost asked.
He discussed three deleterious effects of por
nography: its harm to children: its role as a catalyst
for violence in potential and actual sexual of
fenders, such as rapists and wife-beaters: and its
creation of negative attitudes toward women.
"Pornography is brought about by men for the
use of men." he said. In this light, he said, the harm
it does to women is great.
He called some forms of pornography "a symbol
of male dominance and an instrument of subjuga
tion and degradation of women."
But he made clear his belief that the issues sup
porting this "extremely confusing topic are not
clear-cut. Deciding whether a photograph or
painting or sculpture has artistic merit or is simply
pornographic cannot be done easily in many cases,
he said.
To illustrate this. Katchadourian showed a series
of slides portraying erotic art from many different
Western and Eastern cultures. He noted that many
works which some would characterize as por
nographic are respected, even sacred, in other
societies. One figure, a small man with a large,
erect penis, was a powerful religious statuette that

was traditionally buried with deceased members of
a certain culture, he said.
Katchadourian also included in his presentation
a series of powerful slides either showing or sug
gesting: female exploitation, witnessed in many
advertisements; fetishism, seen in a graphic photo
graph of a half-naked hospital nurse: voyeurism, a
streaking culprit; sado-masochism and rape.
"Should we censor things because we don't want
them to happen?" he asked.
Lawrence's slide presentation, even more graph
ic than Katchadourian's. dealt with female
bondage, dehumanization, child pornography and
sexual violence against women.
She said the intended purpose of her speech was
to familiarize people with the different kinds ot
pornography that exist and to gain support tor re
search in related areas, including the relationship
betweeH pornography and violence.
Her first slides, photos of what she called

"woman bondage," depicted women tied up,
beaten and sexually abused. "You don't have to
look hard to find (this type of pornography)," she
said. The two major themes these scenes state or
suggest are that women crave abuse and that wo
men deserve it, she said.
In the dehumanization section of her presenta
tion. she explained the male urge to objectify wo
men. Many of her slides were record albums and
advertisements exploiting the female body and of
ten cutting the head out of the picture. She also
showed more explicit photographs from por
nographic magazines.
Demonstrating depictions of sexual violence
against women, she included at the end of her se
ries of slides a few grotesque scenes of "Nazi
porn," sadism and self-mutilation.
Because of the seriousness of the subject and its
effects, she said she hoped people would see the
presentation as educational and not entertaining.
