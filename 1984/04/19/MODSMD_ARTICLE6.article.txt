Committee plans to investigate
CIA involvement with mining

Washington — The Central Intelligence Agency and the
Senate Intelligence Committee have stumbled almost inad
vertently into a noisy conflict over the way Congress monitors
secret U.S. intelligence operations — a conflict that raises
basic questions about the effectiveness of the seven-year-old
oversight system for the huge intelligence agency.
The dispute began last week over whether CIA chief
William Casey had fully informed the Senate panel of the
U.S. role in mining Nicaragua's harbors. But it has steadily
become both broader and more bitter, with each side accusing
the other of dereliction of duty.
"The trust isn't there," Sen. David Durenburger (R-
Minn.), a moderate Republican member of the committee,
charged. "There is an important amount of trust that has to
exist between the Senate and the committee that represents
it, and between the committee and the (CIA) professionals
it's overseeing. And it's in this area that things have fallen
down."
The committee announced yesterday that it planned to
hold hearings next week both to re-examine the ClA's covert
operations in Central America and to register its complaints
that Casey has not kept it informed.
Members of the committee, including its conservative
chairman. Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), have charged that
Casey deliberately failed to tell them that CIA personnel
were aboard a mother ship in international waters just off
shore and were directly supervising the Latin American com
mando teams that carried mines into Nicaragua's harbors ear
lier this year.
Gemayel turning to Syria
Beirut, Lebanon — President Amin Gemayel, stymied so
far in his efforts to achieve a political settlement among
Lebanon's feuding factions, hopes that his visit to Damascus
today to confer with Syrian President Hafez Assad will bail
him out of his difficulties.
The visit, which was first planned to take place two weeks
ago but was canceled by the Syrians, was confirmed yesterday
in Damascus. It is hoped that the one-day visit will lead to the
end of more than two months of factional fighting in Beirut if
the two leaders can work out an agreement on how to deal
with the Lebanese crisis.
The announcement of the visit came amid reports that a
team of observers, and possibly 1800 army recruits, will be
deployed along the Beirut confrontation line as part of an ef
fort to impose a lasting cease-fire between Christian and
Moslem militiamen. The plan is to install the observers, who
will be retired army officers, and the recruits along the so
called Green Line through the center of the city to act as a
buffer between the two warring sides.
The first stage of the operation is tentatively scheduled to
take place at noon today. The announcement followed a call
yesterday by a security committee made up of representatives
of the various factions for a lasting cease-fire both in Beirut
and in the mountains above the city.
Syria, which has a long history of close involvement in the
affairs of neighboring Lebanon, pledged to support the
Lebanese government in its efforts to end the violence after
Gemayel agreed to abrogate Lebanon's troop-withdrawal
and security agreement with Israel. The Syrians also are
strong supporters of Lebanese leftist leaders who have
opposed the Gemayel presidency and who have demanded
political reforms to give Lebanon's Moslems more of a say in
how the country is run.
Bush submits ban on weapons
Geneva, Switzerland — The 66-page draft of a treaty to
destroy and ban chemical weapons entirely throughout the
world was offered here yesterday by Vice President George
Bush, with "an unprecedented open-invitation verification
procedure" as its central feature.
"This would permit international inspection teams to visit
on short notice all military or government-owned or
-controlled facilities in the signatory countries," Bush told
reporters at a news conference after addressing a special for
mal session of the 40-nation U.N. disarmament conference
here at the Palais des Nations.
"It would, the United States believes, permit us to
overcome the principal obstacle to an effective chemical
weapons ban agreement in the past — the obstacle of verifica
tion," Bush said. "This pledge for an open invitation for in
spections is not made lightly."
Bush added that he was "saddened that some — without
even seeing a draft of our proposals — have already chosen to
issue statements charging that this is the result of simple poli
tical motivation." Ever since President Reagan announced
two weeks ago that he would send Bush to Geneva with new
proposals, the Soviet Union has been denouncing what the
official Tass news agency most recently called "unacceptable
conditions to camouflage plans for building up U.S. chemical
arsenals."
Mondale takes Missouri
Jefferson City, Mo. — Former Vice President Walter
Mondale won Missouri's Democratic caucuses last night
where 75 national convention delegates were at stake.
Results compiled by the Democratic State Committee were
slow in coming, but they showed Mondale outdistancing both
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart and the Rev. Jesse Jackson by a
wide margin.
In addition, unofficial tallies by both the Mondale cam
paign and supporters of Hart showed Mondale was the easy
winner.
With 46 counties of the 114 counties reporting, Democratic
Party figures showed Mondale winning 124 local delegates,
Hart winning 51. Jackson with three and seven local delegates
uncommitted.
State Party Chairman Pat Lea of Sikeston, who was at the
party's Columbia headquarters, said even with partial results
"I would call it a Mondale victory."
Missouri Democrats were selecting 955 local delegates to
state and congressional district conventions at their caucuses,
and state party officials counted the local delegates elected,
not the total votes cast at the meetings.
The local delegates chosen at the meetings later will deter
mine the makeup of 75 of Missouri's 86-member delegation
to the Democratic National Convention. State party officials
said they did not have enough results counted with which to
project how the caucus results would translate into national
convention delegates.
Rumors lead to market decline
New York — The stock market retreated in active trading
yesterday in a session punctuated by unfounded rumors.
Oil, airline, auto, financial and steel issues were numerous
among the declines.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, seldom ahead
throughout the day, lost 8.06 to 1156.51, offsetting its 4.29-
point gain on Tuesday.
Losers led gainers 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange,
whose composite index dropped 0.58 to 90.83.

oversight system for the huge intelligence agency.
The dispute began last week over whether CIA chief
William Casey had fully informed the Senate panel of the
U.S. role in mining Nicaragua's harbors. But it has steadily
become both broader and more bitter, with each side accusing
the other of dereliction of duty.
"The trust isn't there," Sen. David Durenburger (R-
Minn.), a moderate Republican member of the committee,
charged. "There is an important amount of trust that has to
exist between the Senate and the committee that represents
it, and between the committee and the (CIA) professionals
it's overseeing. And it's in this area that things have fallen
down."
The committee announced yesterday that it planned to
hold hearings next week both to re-examine the ClA's covert
operations in Central America and to register its complaints
that Casey has not kept it informed.
Members of the committee, including its conservative
chairman. Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), have charged that
Casey deliberately failed to tell them that CIA personnel
were aboard a mother ship in international waters just off
shore and were directly supervising the Latin American com
mando teams that carried mines into Nicaragua's harbors ear
lier this year.
Gemayel turning to Syria
Beirut, Lebanon — President Amin Gemayel, stymied so
far in his efforts to achieve a political settlement among
Lebanon's feuding factions, hopes that his visit to Damascus
today to confer with Syrian President Hafez Assad will bail
him out of his difficulties.
The visit, which was first planned to take place two weeks
ago but was canceled by the Syrians, was confirmed yesterday
in Damascus. It is hoped that the one-day visit will lead to the
end of more than two months of factional fighting in Beirut if
the two leaders can work out an agreement on how to deal
with the Lebanese crisis.
The announcement of the visit came amid reports that a
team of observers, and possibly 1800 army recruits, will be
deployed along the Beirut confrontation line as part of an ef
fort to impose a lasting cease-fire between Christian and
Moslem militiamen. The plan is to install the observers, who
will be retired army officers, and the recruits along the so
called Green Line through the center of the city to act as a
buffer between the two warring sides.
The first stage of the operation is tentatively scheduled to
take place at noon today. The announcement followed a call
yesterday by a security committee made up of representatives
of the various factions for a lasting cease-fire both in Beirut
and in the mountains above the city.
Syria, which has a long history of close involvement in the
affairs of neighboring Lebanon, pledged to support the
Lebanese government in its efforts to end the violence after
Gemayel agreed to abrogate Lebanon's troop-withdrawal
and security agreement with Israel. The Syrians also are
strong supporters of Lebanese leftist leaders who have
opposed the Gemayel presidency and who have demanded
political reforms to give Lebanon's Moslems more of a say in
how the country is run.
Bush submits ban on weapons
Geneva, Switzerland — The 66-page draft of a treaty to
destroy and ban chemical weapons entirely throughout the
world was offered here yesterday by Vice President George
Bush, with "an unprecedented open-invitation verification
procedure" as its central feature.
"This would permit international inspection teams to visit
on short notice all military or government-owned or
-controlled facilities in the signatory countries," Bush told
reporters at a news conference after addressing a special for
mal session of the 40-nation U.N. disarmament conference
here at the Palais des Nations.
"It would, the United States believes, permit us to
overcome the principal obstacle to an effective chemical
weapons ban agreement in the past — the obstacle of verifica
tion," Bush said. "This pledge for an open invitation for in
spections is not made lightly."
Bush added that he was "saddened that some — without
even seeing a draft of our proposals — have already chosen to
issue statements charging that this is the result of simple poli
tical motivation." Ever since President Reagan announced
two weeks ago that he would send Bush to Geneva with new
proposals, the Soviet Union has been denouncing what the
official Tass news agency most recently called "unacceptable
conditions to camouflage plans for building up U.S. chemical
arsenals."
Mondale takes Missouri
Jefferson City, Mo. — Former Vice President Walter
Mondale won Missouri's Democratic caucuses last night
where 75 national convention delegates were at stake.
Results compiled by the Democratic State Committee were
slow in coming, but they showed Mondale outdistancing both
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart and the Rev. Jesse Jackson by a
wide margin.
In addition, unofficial tallies by both the Mondale cam
paign and supporters of Hart showed Mondale was the easy
winner.
With 46 counties of the 114 counties reporting, Democratic
Party figures showed Mondale winning 124 local delegates,
Hart winning 51. Jackson with three and seven local delegates
uncommitted.
State Party Chairman Pat Lea of Sikeston, who was at the
party's Columbia headquarters, said even with partial results
"I would call it a Mondale victory."
Missouri Democrats were selecting 955 local delegates to
state and congressional district conventions at their caucuses,
and state party officials counted the local delegates elected,
not the total votes cast at the meetings.
The local delegates chosen at the meetings later will deter
mine the makeup of 75 of Missouri's 86-member delegation
to the Democratic National Convention. State party officials
said they did not have enough results counted with which to
project how the caucus results would translate into national
convention delegates.
Rumors lead to market decline
New York — The stock market retreated in active trading
yesterday in a session punctuated by unfounded rumors.
Oil, airline, auto, financial and steel issues were numerous
among the declines.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, seldom ahead
throughout the day, lost 8.06 to 1156.51, offsetting its 4.29-
point gain on Tuesday.
Losers led gainers 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange,
whose composite index dropped 0.58 to 90.83.

Committee plans to investigate
CIA involvement with mining

Washington — The Central Intelligence Agency and the
Senate Intelligence Committee have stumbled almost inad
vertently into a noisy conflict over the way Congress monitors
secret U.S. intelligence operations — a conflict that raises
basic questions about the effectiveness of the seven-year-old
oversight system for the huge intelligence agency.
