From the Los Angeles Times
London — The Libyan Embassy in
London remained sealed off by police
yesterday while negotiations continued
in an effort to resolve the crisis that
began Tuesday when a gunman inside
the building opened lire at a group of
demonstrators opposed to Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafy.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office an
nounced that 25 British diplomats and
dependents had been given permission to
leave the British Embassy in Tripoli,
where they had been surrounded Tues
day by Libyan troops in apparent retalia
tion for the police blockade of the
Libyan Embassy here.
An unspecified number of those inside
the building subsequently left, a Foreign
Office spokesman said. He said that
Libyan guards remained around the
building, but the release of the British

diplomats took much of the international
tension out of the situation and raised
hopes for a settlement.
Col. Khadafy was reported to have
taken personal charge of the Libyan end
of the negotiations.
A Scotland Yard police spokesman
here said the talks with the people inside
the embassy here were proceeding
"slowly, calmly and patiently" and the
Foreign Office said Ri'chard Luce, a
senior diplomatic official, had been in
touch with Muftah Fitouri, an official in
the embassy's political section.
Late yesterday, it was reported that
Fitouri left the besieged embassy and
went to the Foreign Office to meet per
sonally with Luce in an effort to reach a
compromise solution.
Luce said that the Libyans inside the
embassy had "expressed regret" about
the killing Tuesday of 25-year-old police

Constable Yvonne Fletcher but no for
mal apology was offered.
Diplomatic observers speculated that
the solution eventually reached might
result in the expulsion of some diplomats
from each country, but apparently nei
ther side wants to break diplomatic rela
tions. The countries do an estimated
$450 million a year in trade and more
than 8000 Britons are estimated to be
working in Libya on various construc
tion, oil, and agricultural projects and in
stallations.
Earlier yesterday in Tripoli, British
Ambassador Oliver Miles was escorted
from his embassy to see the Libyan
foreign minister and later was returned
to the embassy. There was no indication
of the nature of the discussions.
At about the same time, Libya
removed the Revolutionary Guards who
had surrounded the ambassador's

residence, where his wife and four
children had been trapped. The families
of seven other British diplomats in
Tripoli were free to move in and out of
their homes, the Foreign Office said, but
the guards who had surrounded them
Tuesday remained outside.
Tripoli Radio, meanwhile, continued
to broadcast strongly anti-British rheto
ric and to charge that the shooting in
London started after police and
demonstrators attacked the Libyan Em
bassy. That version was unanimously
contradicted by all known eyewitnesses.
The area around St. James's Square,
where the Libyan Embassy is situated in
central London, was cordoned off to all
traffic yesterday, and office buildings in
the neighborhood remained empty. The
usually busy square was deserted except
for police. Hundreds of officers were po
sitioned in and around the area. •
