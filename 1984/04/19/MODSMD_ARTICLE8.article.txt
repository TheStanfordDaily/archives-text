From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — A U.S. Army helicopter carrying two
U.S. senators was hit by ground fire yesterday and
forced down in Honduras near the border of El Sal
vador. No one aboard the helicopter or an accompany
ing craft was injured, U.S. officials said.
The two unarmed UH-l helicopters, carrying Sens.
Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) and J. Bennett Johnston (D-
La.), were en route from a Honduran air force base at
Palmerola to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees
camp at Colomoncagua, Chiles' office said here.
The source of the fire could not immediately be de
termined.
"If we knew it was unfriendly, we would have said
so," a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in the Hon
duran capital of Tegucigalpa said in a telephone inter
view.
The spokesman said that the helicopter was forced
down at Marcala. about 55 miles west of Tegucigalpa.
The area is about 10 miles north of the border with El
Salvador.

Chiles and Johnston left Washington Sunday on a
weeklong fact-finding mission and were scheduled to
return tomorrow. The two helicopters carried a total of
six crew members and nine passengers, including some
members of the embassy staff, officials in Honduras
said.
Both helicopters and the passengers were flown back
to the air force base and then Tegucigalpa later yester
day. The senators and their party then flew on to
Panama City for the next leg of their tour, which was to
include a stop in Nicaragua.
Enrique Perez, a spokesman at the embassy in Hon
duras, said the UH-l helcopter carrying Chiles and
Johnston made a "precautionary landing" after it was
struck by ground fire on its approach to the refugee
camp about 4 p.m.
Diana Negroponte, wife of John Negroponte, U.S.
ambassador to Honduras, was aboard the helicopter
that was not hit, Perez said. He said three congressional
staffers also were believed to have been among the
party.

Two of the staffers were identified by Senate aides as
Richard Collings of the Senate Appropriations Com
mittee and Douglas Olin of the Senate Budget Com
mittee. Johnston and Chiles are both members of the
committees, which have played a key role in approving
funds for U.S. operations in Central America.
Johnston, speaking at a Tegucigalpa airport news
conference after the incident yesterday, said that he
had no idea what was happening aboard the helicopter
until he felt air coming up from the floor of the craft.
The pilot put the aircraft down safely, he said, and the
passengers and crew were flown from the area aboard
the second helicopter.
Ambassador Negroponte, who was not traveling with
the senators, said at the news conference, "This inci
dent shows the need to move the Salvadoran refugee
camps into the interior of Honduras."
He said he planned to discuss the issue with repre
sentatives of the U.N. refugee office. About 32,000
Salvadoran refugees are in Honduras, with 6000 of
them in the Colomoncagua camp.
