### 
From The Washington Post
Washington — The State De
partment yesterday rejected
Nicaragua's nomination of Dep
uty Foreign Minister Nora As
torga to be its ambassador to the
United States because a
Nicaraguan general was mur
dered in her bedroom in 1978.
Nicaraguan officials said no
official explanation was given to
them in the five-line rejection
notice that was delivered to the
Foreign Ministry in Managua.
But a State Department official
said, "The unofficial line is we
don't want that assassin here.

She's not appropriate."
At the same time, President
Reagan's former special envoy
to Central America, Richard
Stone, called on Reagan to take
a personal role in building sup
port in Congress for his policies
in the region.
"You can't conduct a foreign
policy with Congress largely
against you," Stone said at a
luncheon with Washington Post
editors and reporters.
What is needed now, he said,
is a major effort to build biparti
san support for U.S. aid to the
government of El Salvador and

for the administration's tough
policy toward nearby
Nicaragua. Stone recommended
"an informal presidential ef
fort" of meetings with moderate
members of Congress, begin
ning with House Foreign Affairs
Committee Chairman Dante
Fascell (D-Fla.) and with other
chief congressional actors in the
Central America debate.
"I'd use the White House and
I'd use Camp David, everything
there is, to make the effort,"
Stone said. He said he is confi
dent that agreement is possible
despite adverse Capitol Hill re

action to Reagan's charges that
Congress is undercutting his
policies.
Astorga, 36, who was chosen
by Nicaragua's Sandinista gov
ernment to be its ambassador
here, is an articulate, energetic
attorney who was prominent in
the revolutionary army of the
Sandinista National Liberation
Front that ousted dictator Anas
tasio Somoza in 1979.
She has acknowledged that in
March 1978, when she was
working in secret for the Sandi
nistas, she invited Gen.
Reynaldo Perez Vega, one of

Somoza's key officers, to her
bedroom, where five Sandinis
tas were waiting in hiding to
kidnap him. She has said that
the general resisted and was
killed in the ensuing struggle.
In an extraordinary series of
leaks when Astorga was
nominated by the Sandinistas a
month ago, CIA officials let it
be known that the general, who
was deputy commander of
Somoza's National Guard, had
been cooperating with them and
that they resented lit-; l«-»cc nnH
harbored a grudge against As
torga.
