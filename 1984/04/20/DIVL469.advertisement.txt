I plan on living a long
and healthy lite, so I
get regular cancer
checkups. You see, the
best time to get a
checkup is be/ore you
have any symptoms.
So take care ot
yourself, now. Call or
write your local unit of
the American Cancer
Society for a free
pamphlet on their new
cancer checkup
guidelines.
Because if you're like
me, you want to live
long enough to do
it all.
