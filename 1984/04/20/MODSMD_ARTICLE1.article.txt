# ASSU election results pack a few surprises
## Five groups lose fee assessments 
### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
The student body voted down the
special fee requests of five groups on
the ASSU election ballot, with Stan
ford Progressive Alliance (SPA) and
SMAR TOR Tuesday Film Series suf
fering the greatest defeats.
Special fee requests for the ASSU
Lobby Office, Stanford-, n-Gov
ernment and the Women's Center
were also defeated.
Eric Diesel, sponsor of the SMAR
TOR fee request, attributed the defeat
to a number of factors.
"I think the ASSU bylaws didn't
prevent false statements from being
issued about our group in the election
handout, and I don't think people
realized that our group was the Friday
film series" over the summer before
changing to Tuesday nights last fall, he
said.
Diesel said he tried for "hours and
hours to have "Great Directors Film
Series" printed on the ballot, but that
his request was "treated as a joke" by


" e ' eC,i ° nS "» ri«
the elections commissioner.
Paul Baer, sponsor of SPA's fee re
quest, said he wasn't surprised at the
voters' response.
"We realize that we don't have that
many big fans on campus," he said.
"SPA has never pretended to be non
partisan, and we tend to be more
liberal than the average student."
The Stanford Arms Control and
Disarmament Forum (SACDF) had a
narrow win in Tuesday's and Wednes
day's election.
According to Benjamin Austin,
director of the SADCF, the group ran
out of money and was unable to
publicize before the-election.
"It was close, but I think the reason
we won is that we're non-partisan,

have a good track record, and we deal
with an important issue," Austin said.
SURE Escort Service had the
greatest victory of all the groups on
the ballot, and the Rape Education
Project also won by a wide margin.
Jim Oswald, a worker with the Rape
Education Project, said it was frustrat
ing that the Women's Center lost its
fee request.
"The Women's Center is probably
one of the most misunderstood groups
on campus," he said.
Most of the people associated with
groups which lost fee assessment re
quests said that voters in this year's
election probably are not involved in
student groups.
"I think most of the people that
voted don't favor a lot of funding for
groups anyway, and they probably
voted just to get their refunds back,"
Austin said.

Students who voted in this year's
election passed Constitutional
Amendment No. 1, while defeating
Constitutional Amendment No. 2. a
measure to amend articles I and II of
the current constitution.
Students also voted in favor of two
referendums placed on the ballot by
the ASSU Lobby Office. The vote was
in favor of the Office's advocat
ing protection of state and federal fin
ancial aid programs as well as in favor
of a commission to address the
shortage of low cost housing in the
Stanford area.
