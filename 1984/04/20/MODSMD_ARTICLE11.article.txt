## Hackers plug into 'bboards' 
### LARRY LEE 
Nearly everyone gets burned in a computer science class
once, staying up until the early morning the day that a pro
gram is due. But now, computer enthusiasts don't even need
to be enrolled in a class to teel the heat and intensity of
working with computers.
With the advent of computer bulletin boards, or "bboards"
tor short (pronounced beeboards ), computer whizzes with a hot
issue to discuss can jump right into open debate with others.
Judy Anderson, a graduate student in computer science, is
a regular flamer, one of a growing group of people who use
bboards to discuss political, social and religious issues. She es
timates that there are about 15 others like her who often use
the bboard at LOIS. Anderson said the bboard can
sometimes even become a 'spectator sport to see who gets
burned worse by the flames."
But flamers are not the only people to use the bboards to
transmit their \ iews to the public. James McGrath, a graduate
student in computer science, explained another one of the
bboard's interesting uses.
While I was an ASSU senator, I used the bboard to keep
my constituents in contact with what was happening at the
ASSU. Indeed, two years ago I asked people to open up a
debate on reforming the tec assessment system. Their com
ments formed the basis for the current system," McGrath
said.
Because of the public access, the bboard can sometimes
resemble the want ads of a newspaper, as users can advertise
nearly anything, from houses for rent to jobs for hire. Users
of the bboard have also been known to exchange recipes, to
complain about LOTS or simply to ask for information.
When someone asks a question, there's always someone
in the audience who can answer it," according to Greg Ching,
student coordinator at LOTS.
Besides the general bboards, there are a multitude of
special-interest bulletin boards as well. Bboard Micro is a
LOTS board devoted exclusively to discussions concerning
microcomputers, for example, while Bboard SF-Lovers is an
other LOTS bboard for science 112 iction fans.
The computers at Stanford receive a number of nationwide,
special interest bulletin boards, which may be funded com
mercially or by the government. Unlike local bboards, most
national bboards are essentially "read only" and are similar
to magazines: Contributors send materials to the bboard's
editor who selects the articles for publication.

Some examples of national bboards are the AI-List, on
which artificial intelligence is discussed or Sky-Fans, which is
for amateur astronomers. SCTV is used by fans of the SCTV
televison show, while Cube-Lovers allows users to exchange
the latest information on Rubik's Cube.
Using a modem, a machine which converts characters into
electronic signals to be sent over telephone lines, personal
computer owners can send messages to or receive messages
from the larger bboards, and almost instantly, send their
message out to scores of people.
In order to serve the large population of personal computer
owners, some private individuals have started their own
bboard systems. About 30 privately owned bboard systems
operate free of charge in the Bay Area and supply a wide va
riety of services.
One popular bboard is Sunrise Omega-X() in Oakland. The
first-time user opens an account on the system by giving his
name, city and a secret password. He or she can then use the
system to receive or send electronic mail, read and send
messages on the bboard or "chat" via keyboard with the
"SYSOP," the system operator who usually owns and main
tains the system.
Another popular bboard system. Conference Tree No. 3 in
Hayward, divides its bboard into categories and subtopics.
The user can choose to read messages from the category
"software," and the bboard responds by printing a menu of
available messages dealing with that topic.
A few bboards in the Bay Area are X-rated. Upon logging
on, users are asked to promise that they are at least 18. They
can then read messages and also leave behind equally explicit
ones. Logging onto these X-rated systems is quite difficult,
though, because their phone lines are busy almost 24 hours a
day.
Other free bboard-type services include computerized
matching and dating services, like Dial-Vour-Match No. 56 in
Mountain View. Users fill out multiple-choice questionnaires
about their physical and social characteristics and the bboard
computer attempts to find a match among its list of hundreds
of callers. Other users can read these questionnaires and send
or receive messages.
What might the future hold for bboards? According to
McGrath, the coming years look bright. "As the cost of
hooking people up decreases, more and more people are
going to be using electronic mail facilities (including bboards)
to supplement the telephone, newspaper and special interest
groups. As a new mode of communication, it has the advan
tages of the phone, coupled to that of the printing press, with
out their drawbacks."
