# Moses delivers Whitman to culinary promised land
## 
### DANA RATLIFF 
You ask yourself, how many
times this quarter have eggplant
stack-ups or tofu zucchini
casserole appeared on your
plate? The thrill of these gour
met dishes quickly dies after the
first week of freshman year. But
not at the Whitman House
kitchen, where Moses Myers
delivers his flock from food ser
vice slavery every day.
However. this unique
liberator doesn't see himself as a
rebel but as an artist. To Moses,
a visit to the cafeteria should be
almost like a trip to the Museum
of Modern Art.
"The aesthetic value of a dish,
the colors and presentation,
should make a dinner like eating
a Van Gogh," Moses says. "To
me, the entire kitchen is like a
living canvas. Cooking is very
personal. I write short stories
with lasagna."
Moses takes his work very
seriously.
"When I cook food I want it
to come off right. People are
going to eat what I make and I
want to please them," he says.
Born in South Carolina 38
years ago, Moses has been in
California for six years, most of
which he has spent as a cook on
the Stanford campus. By now,
cooking comes naturally to him,
and he says he almost feels
guilty taking money for it."I
love the business. It's not work,
it's fun . . . like coming to a
playground every day."
Still, as much as he likes
cooking, he feels that his rela
tionship with the residents is
more valuable. "For me, it is an
ongoing learning process be
tween me and the students. It's
like having a big family. To be
honest, I usually forget that I am
working when I get into a really
good discussion in the kitchen,"
he says.
Whitman residents couldn't
agree more. "You can count on
Moses to be there in the kitchen
to talk to," according to Brian
Priansayer. "He understands
where you are at."
"My thing," says Moses, "is
that I listen a lot."
And the kitchen, somewhat
like Moses, is an escape for stu
dents. "It's like Switzerland, a
neutral area. You can do any
thing you want in here so long as
you clean it up," Moses said.
But Moses does not always
feel completely secure about
himself. As a child, he was shy.
"I played hooky a lot so I could
go to libraries to read . . . mostly
history and art books. Every
thing was so alive, I couldn't
wait to see what was around the
corner of the next building."
Sometimes, he still lapses into
this boyhood insecurity."l got
caught in my own trap, my own
comfort zone a few years ago.

After the first year, the whole
house changed when many new
people moved in. 1 was scared to
death if the new people were
going to like me. Would they
like my cooking? I'd talk to the
old people because they were
predictable and I felt com
fortable," Moses explained.
But now it no longer makes
any difference to Moses when a
new flock moves in.
"Each group I've seen has
been unique," he says. "1 no
longer try to change them. If
you sort of believe in everyone
here, then you get a sense of

continuity while still giving
people a lot of room to change."
Having once worked as a cor
rections officer, Moses likes
being around all types of youth.
"I love being around kids. I
see them as little growing
people . . . kind of like going
from junior to giant cupcake. I
like the fresh views that they
have. I get to see the world
through their eyes."
Moses says his dream is to
someday have about 30 kids
who don't have anyone else to
love them and to put them on a
farm with cows and many other
animals. He would like to be a

father to unwanted and home
less children "of all colors,
shapes and sizes."
Because Moses is approach
ing 40 years of age, he wants to
share his experiences and help
lead the younger generations
on. However, he believes it is
not as easy to grow old now as it
was when youth looked up to
old age for advice and knowl
edge.
"Growing old is a bad thing in
our society," Moses says. "It's
not like the caveman days when
there were elders who could still
feel useful. Now, young people

have books to find everything
in. But I think people can al
ways make themselves useful if
they try."
As for his own future, Moses
plans to attend the San Fran
cisco Culinary Institute or an
other school once his roommate
completes her Ph D. here in
civil engineering.
But for now, Moses is happy
in Whitman, and the house is
glad to have him. "The harac
ter of this house is ce- tered
around Moses," Priansayer said.
"I'm glad we arc not a co-op be
cause then we wouldn't have
him here."
