Three years ago, a small group of law students
saw a need: While Palo Alto's 60,000 residents
had more than 500 attorneys at their service. East
Palo Alto's 18,000 residents had only one.
Most of us would have filed the statistic away in
our minds and gone back to our own lives, con
cerned a little, but not enough to do anything
about it.
But a group of law students cared. And last
week, they officially opened the East Palo Alto
Law Project.
There are a number of reasons this project is so
heartening.
First, the students opened the project without
University funding or a fee assessment. They
wanted something, and they worked to find the
money for it from outside the University.
Second, these students are helping to solve
problems here and now. Often people concen
trate on far-off problems in far away lands while
pressing needs closer to home go unmet. The law
students bucked that trend and tackled a problem

in their own backyard — even though East Palo
Alto is, socially and economically, a backyard in
quite another neighborhood.
Third, the students went a long way to dispel
the stereotype of graduate students. A Council
of-Presidents candidate said recently that
graduate students cared almost exclusively about
their studies. With the Law Project, the uprising
at Escondido Village over rent increases and the
pile of mail we've received from grads over the
ASSU Senate's vote on contingency funding, it's
obvious that graduate students care about a great
deal more.
It seems today, when faced with a problem,
Stanford students automatically sponsor a few
speeches and establish a dozen committees and
then feel confident that they've done their share
to make the world better.
But this small group of law students knows bet
ter. They've thrust themselves into the heart of
the problem and have done something about it.
This project is what Stanford should be all about.
