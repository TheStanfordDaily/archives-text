## Hitler and Reagan: frightening parallels 
### 
Drawing parallels between the past
and the present isn't always wise, but
the Reagan administration is bringing
back some bad memories. Adolf Hit
ler also glorified the use of military
force and aroused the apprehension of
civilized people everywhere. Nazi
Germany also savaged smaller.

VIEWPOINT

weaker nations and openly scorned
the established machinery for settling
international disputes. Hitler's regime
also spread lies and silenced political
debate.
These memories returned on April
5, when President declared that
"military force must remain an
available part of American foreign
policy," and attacked Congress for
being "less than wholly comfortable"
with this idea. Reagan was not talking
about defending the United States but
about exerting U.S. power abroad.
On April 9 Reagan called for the
celebration of Law Day, saying that
"without law there can be no freedom,
only chaos and disorder. And without
freedom law is but a cynical veneer for
injustice and oppression."
But just two days earlier the United

States had rejected World Court juris
diction over Nicaragua's complaint
that U.S.-backed forces had mined its
ports, destroyed its crops and physical
facilities and killed more than 1300
Nicaraguans. The Reagan administra
tion had already shown its contempt
for international peacekeeping efforts
by casting the only vote — a veto —
against a U.N. Security Council
resolution condemning the mining of
Nicaragua's ports. The U.S. invasion
of Grenada last October was in clear
violation of the U.N. charter and the
charter of the Organization of Ameri
can States.
The Reagan administration's dis
regard for truth was clearly
demonstrated on April 8, when
Caspar Weinberger claimed on na
tional television that "the United
States is not mining the harbors of
Nicaragua" — and then, since the
news was out, was forced to add that
he wasn't talking about the CIA.
Reagan's press conferences have been
replete with phony statistics and mis
statements of fact, including the claim
that left-wing rebels in El Salvador
were responsible for the death squad
killings.
So far we have been fortunate. The

press still reveals much of what our
government is doing, including the un
ethical behavior of several Reagan ap
pointees. Members of Congress still
vigorously oppose administration
policies.
But now Robert McFarlane, the ex-
Marine who is Reagan's national se
curity adviser, has blasted Congress
for openly criticizing the Reagan ad
ministration's follies in Lebanon.
Once a decision is made, he said,
criticism should only be made
privately, to the president — a proce
dure that would deprive the public and
Congress of the benefits of open
debate. The framers of the Constitu
tion explicitly guaranteed Congress
the power to control expenditures and
to declare war, as a means of checking
executive power. If Reagan regards
the legislature only as a rubber stamp,
he misunderstands the fundamental
principles of our democracy.
A senior administration official was
quoted on April 10 as saying that after
the election "the president is deter
mined to go all-out after leftist forces"
in Central America. Other officials
report that contingency plans have
been made to send U.S. troops to EI
.Salvador. Since popular opinion is

strongly opposed to such an action,
there will inevitably be protest. What
then? If Congress can he pressured to
remain silent, ordinary citizens, are
even more vulnerable. "National se
curity" has more than once been the
pretext for crushing dissent.
Reagan was correct in saying that
without law there is only chaos and
disorder. But the effectiveness of law
depends not on compulsion but on
mutual trust, a tacit agreement among
members of the community to abide
by established rules of behavior. It is
the Reagan administration that is
tearing apart this fabric of trust, both
at home and abroad, with its lies, its
contempt for world opinion and its de
termination to impose its will wher
ever and however it chooses.
Reagan's style as an amiable, old
actor surely doesn't resemble ojie of
history's greatest criminals, but his ad
ministration supports torture cham
bers, death squads and the killing of
thousands of Central Americans. If
the accelerated arms race he has
prov'oJted leads to war, he will
be responsible tor a greater! tragedy
than Hitler ever envisioned.
