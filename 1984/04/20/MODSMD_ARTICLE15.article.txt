## Brazil needs solidarity in move for elections 
### 
After 20 years under a military dictatorship,
Brazil is demonstrating an increasing tendency in
favor of its redemocratization. The recent public
demonstrations that have taken place in different
parts of the country during this month demonstrate
the internal struggle by Brazilians to dismantle the

VIEWPOINT

most complex and resilient military dictatorship in
Latin America today.
An analysis of the recent popular demonstra
tions that culminated with a gathering of more
than 1,000,000 people in Rio de Janeiro on April
10 shows that the solution to the national Brazilian
problem has been led by public opinion and by the
political parties in a manner that is characterized
by steady moderation rather than by violent
struggle.
From every region in the country one can hear
of the familiar words — "Diretas Ja!" (Direct
[elections] Now!), and this general slogan is
chanted with a certain arbitrariness bv a group of

generals and their delegates in the National
Congress that must decide if there will be direct
elections for the president of the republic. The
suspense of the decision is heightened by the fact
that what is in the cards is not just the willingness
to vote, but principally, the probable victory of the
opposition that will have to handle the national
debt differently than the creator of this debt, the
military government, has done.
The Brazilian political arena contains the mili
tary, the general public and external forces, partic
ularly the International Monetary Fund. Because
we believe that this popular cause is being fought
for by the people who suffer under various forms
of oppression, their voices must be echoed in this
grave political moment.
The North American press seems to be very un
equally attentive to the causes of countries in the
process of gaining their autonomy. It pays a lot of
attention to a few specific problems, like Central
America and the Mideast (which are undeniably
very important, but which are not the only
struggles in the world today), and virtually ignores

other areas. It is clear to the Brazilian community
that in a first phase, the objectives of forces that
want to act here, by the friends of Brazil, should be
two: 1) to unite Brazilian groups, to prepare chan
nels for new circulation and to form task forces in
favor of direct elections, and 2) to promote the
debate regarding Brazil, as much in the diverse in
stitutions that favor democratic causes as to create
channels in the press to report on the internal sit
uation of the country.
What most worries the Brazilian community in
the United States is that our struggle might be
confused with the rest of the questions regarding
Latin America in general. What would really be
useful would be the creation of a movement, here
and now, by Brazilians who are trying to focalize
our cause independently; we prefer to continue
struggling for direct elections with the support of
institutions sympathetic to our cause, without
being paternalized by them.
