# The 						proud and the arrogant
## 
### 
The mixture of respect and con
tempt with which most outsiders
regard Stanford is the natural counter
part to the combination of pride and
arrogance which Stanford often ap
pears to possess. The balance between
the qualities of pride and arrogance is
a critical one because a person's
respect and admiration become dis
respect and disgust when he or she
perceives arrogance, even when that
arrogance is a simple overextension of
pride or an impulsive outpouring of
confidence.
The provocation of such feelings
threatens Stanford's role in the com
munity because no one wants to work
with or for something perceived as ar
rogant. Stanford students and faculty
enter the community with a reputation
for talent and quality, yet these deli
cate impressions can be tarnished and
ignored if they are juxtaposed with ar
rogance and loftiness.
The basis for pride is obvious, as it is
the pitfall which leads to arrogance.
Stanford as an institution evokes
respect, and the pride of taking part in
such an organization is very powerful.
However, this association can easily
extend to the point where false pride
develops, and individuals become
sneering and arrogant as they identify
themselves with an impressive institu
tion.
This is the concept which fuels the
sale of a multitude of items bearing
Stanford's name. The bookstore
pushes T-shirts, sweatshirts, shorts,
bumper-stickers, toilet seat covers and
other products designed to tell every
one that you go to Stanford. In case
one has to go home, or to a high
school reunion, one's Stanford label
will assure others of one's worth. In
case one ventures into the City, or
among the "low-lifes" of area clubs,
one's Stanford label will reinforce
one's esteemed position, regardless of
personal qualities.
While Stanford products exhibit
something between pride and ar

rogance, depending on one's attitude,
other common slogans leave no room
for doubt. Cheers at football games
such as "we got in" or "that's al
right/that's okay/you will work for us
someday" are completely smug. The
tradition of shaking keys reputedly
began at a Big Game where students
shook keys to symbolize their new
cars. This type of pride is wrong.
Recently I was involved in a compe
tition between area colleges in which
the audience and the competitors were
openly hostile and angry toward Stan
ford. It is a sad fact that in this area a
certain antagonism has developed
toward Stanford, partly due to a
resentment of its size and power, but
also because of a perception of its
misplaced superiority.
In view of clearly imperfect admis
sions and financial aids systems, it is
often merely good fortune and solid
finances which distinguish Stanford
students. The opportunity to come
here has often depended on going to a
good high school, writing a funny ap
plication, catching Dean Fred on a
good day or being able to pay.
Rightly or wrongly, many people in
the community, aware of the factors
involved in being able to go to Stan
ford, are hurt by a perceived sense
that Stanford students have a mis
rooted pride. Particularly on the issue
of finances, it is believed that many
students mistake dollars for sense.
In general, arrogance is not
prevalent on campus, at least not
among individual students. However,
this feeling is perceived among resi
dents of this area, and, on those occa
sions when associational pride
replaces personal pride and publicly
manifests itself, then these feelings are
reinforced, further developing a prej
udice against Stanford and the leaders
it strives to produce.
