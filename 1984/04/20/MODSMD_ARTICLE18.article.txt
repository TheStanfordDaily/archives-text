## Housing rate hikes unfair to graduate students 
### 
As a fourth-year graduate student
at Stanford 1 find myself once again
exerting all of my mental energy in an
effort to solve a seemingly hopeless
dilemma. Is my inner turmoil due to a
problem with my research? When 1
don't sleep well, is it because I am
trying to come to grips with the
writing of my dissertation? Am 1
struggling because my "contribution
to the body of knowledge" seems
insignificant? Not at all. I'm simply
trying to figure out how to feed my
wife and child in the face of another
unbelievable rent increase at Escon
dido Village.
*
Since coming to Stanford in 1980,
inflation has taken a sizeable piece of
my buying power from me. Tuition
increases, running well above the
inflation rate, have cut much too
deeply for my modest income to
cover; student loans were the only
answer (I pay all of my tuition myself,
with no Stanford support). But now,
for the third consecutive year, rent
increases have outstripped both tui
tion and inflation.
The administration has condes
cendingly informed us that the pro
posed 14 to 17 percent rent increases
for family housing are part of a
master plan to insure equity in the
housing program. If this plan is so
eminently equitable, why hasn't the

University published it far and wide
both to attract graduate students and
to help us plan our financial futures?
If equity means that students with
children and spouses to support are
expected to bear the brunt of paying
for gold-plated single-student housing
(i.e.. Governor's Corner, at a cost of
$50,000 per student room) then I
must be reading the wrong dictionary.
And attending the wrong university.

Stanford's housing office is propos
ing increases next year of up to three
times the rise in the consumer price
index for graduate housing. That's on
top of increases between 72 and 83
percent since 1980.
Why?
To their credit, administrators have
been candid. That's what it costs to
fund Governor's Corner, the 800-unit
undergraduate housing complex next
to Lake Lagunita.
It may be entirely appropriate for
this university to build housing with
baby grand pianos, all-oak furniture,
fireplaces built with reclaimed
sandstone blocks from Stanford's
early days, sundecks overlooking the
lake, handmade leather couches and

exposed beam ceilings, among other
amenities. The $50,000-per-unit cost
of the construction does not seem so
outlandish when one considers that
Stanford passed the $1 billion mark
in endowment last fall, and raised
more ($9l million) in contributions
last year than all but one American
university.
But many of us in Escondido Vil
lage question whether it is appropri
ate to ask us to pay for Governor's
Corner — we who live at our loan
limits, on academic stipends that
don't keep pace with rent hikes and
on what's left from spouses' incomes
after child care has been deducted.
The rent hikes have hit particularly
hard at families and foreign students.
More important, we question whe
ther it's just for us to be asked to pay
for housing in which we are not per
mitted to live.
Until Governor's Corner began to
drive rental costs upward several
years ago, the University divided its
housing money into graduate and
undergraduate pools proportionate to
costs of the respective housing. That
was appropriate since the University
has quite different policies regarding
the two groups. Stanford is
ted to meeting the housing needs of
undergraduates who want to live on
campus. No such committment exists

for graduates (for reasons unclear to
many of us.)
Now the University has one
housing pool, although the different
policies remain for filling that
housing. It's inconsistent.
According to the 1982-83 housing
budget, Escondido rents last year
already subsidized other University
housing in the amount of $1.1 mil
lion. We simply can't afford to pay
much more.
Let me cite a few statistics from a
survey completed in the last three
weeks by 40 percent of the families
with children in Escondido Village:
• 43 percent report that half or more
of their total income goes to rent.
• 51 percent must borrow to make
ends meet.
• 40 percent say the current rent
spiral may force them to discontinue
their studies at Stanford.
In conclusion, Stanford is not just
hurting Escondido Village residents,
the University is hurting its chances
of recruiting top graduate students,
particularly the growing category who
have worked for several years before
college and return to campus with
special skills, and with children who
expect to eat.

ate to ask us to pay for Governor's
Corner — we who live at our loan
limits, on academic stipends that
don't keep pace with rent hikes and
on what's left from spouses' incomes
after child care has been deducted.
The rent hikes have hit particularly
hard at families and foreign students.
More important, we question whe
ther it's just for us to be asked to pay
for housing in which we are not per
mitted to live.
Until Governor's Corner began to
drive rental costs upward several
years ago, the University divided its
housing money into graduate and
undergraduate pools proportionate to
costs of the respective housing. That
was appropriate since the University
has quite different policies regarding
the two groups. Stanford is
ted to meeting the housing needs of
undergraduates who want to live on
campus. No such committment exists

for graduates (for reasons unclear to
many of us.)
Now the University has one
housing pool, although the different
policies remain for filling that
housing. It's inconsistent.
According to the 1982-83 housing
budget, Escondido rents last year
already subsidized other University
housing in the amount of $1.1 mil
lion. We simply can't afford to pay
much more.
Let me cite a few statistics from a
survey completed in the last three
weeks by 40 percent of the families
with children in Escondido Village:
• 43 percent report that half or more
of their total income goes to rent.
• 51 percent must borrow to make
ends meet.
• 40 percent say the current rent
spiral may force them to discontinue
their studies at Stanford.
In conclusion, Stanford is not just
hurting Escondido Village residents,
the University is hurting its chances
of recruiting top graduate students,
particularly the growing category who
have worked for several years before
college and return to campus with
special skills, and with children who
expect to eat.
