## 
### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
The ASSU election results an
nounced last night brought good news
for . pj < the "people, projects, partici
pation slate, as well as a few surprises
for three senior class presidential
slates, two of which will face a runoff
election next week.
David Porter, Alice Wells, Todd
Kerr and Melissa Auchard, the P'
slate, beat the Steve Miller Band in
the Council of Presidents (COP)
voting. The Hammer and Coffin Slate
dropped out of the election shortly
before it started.
According to Wells, the new council
plans to start working immediately on
goals concerning the "quality of life."
We II start work on redesigning the
Coffee House, creating a speakers
council and evaluating Food Service
right away," Wells said.
After announcing results for the
COP and fee assessment elections,
elections commissioner Phil Halperin
told senior class presidential candi
dates gathered to hear the results of
their election, "We have a big prob

lem."
According to Halperin, junior* at
the Stanford campuses in Florence
and Vienna did not receive their bal
lots in time to vote. Halperin said this

was due to "the worst combination:
Italian mail and Easter week."'
Three of the slates, the 01 HI Slate,
the Clean Slate, and The Right Slate,
were close enough to guarantee a run
oft next week, Halperin said.
The problem comes in with
Florence since they have 45 juniors,"
he said. "Those votes can majorly af
fect any of the top three slates at this
point."
