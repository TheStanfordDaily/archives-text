## 
### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
The ASSU election results an
nounced last night brought good news
for . pj < the "people, projects, partici
pation slate, as well as a few surprises
for three senior class presidential
slates, two of which will face a runoff
election next week.
David Porter, Alice Wells, Todd
Kerr and Melissa Auchard, the P'
slate, beat the Steve Miller Band in
the Council of Presidents (COP)
voting. The Hammer and Coffin Slate
dropped out of the election shortly
before it started.
According to Wells, the new council
plans to start working immediately on
goals concerning the "quality of life."
We II start work on redesigning the
Coffee House, creating a speakers
council and evaluating Food Service
right away," Wells said.
After announcing results for the
COP and fee assessment elections,
elections commissioner Phil Halperin
told senior class presidential candi
dates gathered to hear the results of
their election, "We have a big prob

lem."
According to Halperin, junior* at
the Stanford campuses in Florence
and Vienna did not receive their bal
lots in time to vote. Halperin said this

was due to "the worst combination:
Italian mail and Easter week."'
Three of the slates, the 01 HI Slate,
the Clean Slate, and The Right Slate,
were close enough to guarantee a run
oft next week, Halperin said.
The problem comes in with
Florence since they have 45 juniors,"
he said. "Those votes can majorly af
fect any of the top three slates at this
point."

According to Halperin. the votes of
juniors at the Florence campus and
the votes of 21 juniors at the Vienna
campus will determine which of the
three slates are to face a runoff elec
tion.
Since students at the Florence
campus went on vacation yesterday
morning. Halperin said he would not
know the results until midnight Wed
nesday.
"What we will conceivably do then
is allow the slates to campaign on
Thursday and Friday, with the voting
to be held on Friday," he said. "That
way we can know the results by Friday
evening."

The votes coming in from the
Florence and Vienna campuses might
also play a role in the undergraduate
senatorial election, causing the order
ing of senators to change.
"The votes will definitely cause the
order to change, which means chang
ing which senators are now regular
and which are alternate," senate chair
Jug Jagadish said. "And that means
changing which senators will be able
to vote."
While Halperin would not say which
one of the top three senior class
presidential slates received the most
votes, he did release the order of
senators according to votes received.
Gustavo "Gus" Gomez, Nan Ho,
Yvonne Campos and Mark Soble were
the top four vote-getters in the under
graduate senatorial race.

Reactions from those who won their
elections were enthusiastic.
"It's oh-so live!" Porter, of the P 1
slate, said.
Wells said the k/SU debates
definitely helped the P- 1 slate get
elected.
"I think that made us really work on
formulating our goals and not just rely
on our past experience," she said.
"I'm happy, but I don't want this ex
perience ever again."
Soble, Jon Adelstein and
Adam Wand were elected to the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council.
Senators elected from the Graduate
School of Humanities and Sciences
were Eric Berg, Mark Landesmann
and Su Uhland. Giles Brereton, Gary
Kait and Wes Sterman were also
elected graduate senators.
