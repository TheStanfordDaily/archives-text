# Don't miss the many splendors of Yosemite Park
## 
### JEFF MALTZMAN SUZANNE FAUNCE 
There are few spots on earth
so magnificent that roy alty from
six countries and 10 United
States presidents would trek
thousands of miles to visit it.
Ralph Waldo Emerson. Judy
Garland and Mae West came to
this place. The perfect escape
these people found is Yosemite
National Park; it lies less than
five hours from Stanford.
Yosemite in the spring offers
an ideal spot for a romantic
escape. The overwhelming
crowds of summer have not yet
arrived and the pristine natural
beauty of the park is at its best.
Yosemite is a deep, dramatic
valley surrounded bv sheer
granite cliffs carved out cen
turies ago by ice age glaciers.
The cliffs are accented by
numerous waterfalls, ribbons of
water that plunge thousands of
feet to the graceful valley below.
Yosemite Falls, the highest
waterfall in the park, boasts an
awesome 2425-foot vertical
drop. During the spring as the
Sierra snow melts, Yosemite's
waterfalls are at full flow, pro
viding a stunning dramatic
backdrop to the grandiose val
ley.
Yosemite offers numerous ac
tivities. Hiking, backpacking,
rock climbing, skiing (cross
country and down-hill) and ice
skating are among the favorite
activities. The open-air skating
rink is conveniently located
close to the lodges and Curry
Village.
Amongst this natural beauty
is one of America's most dis
tinctive hotels, the Ahwahnee.
This huge stone castle was built
in 1927 on a scale to match the
majesty of Yosemite. The inte
rior of the Ahwahnee features
beautiful large public rooms
"with high ceilings and huge
picture windows. Everything

here is on a grand scale; enor
mous stone fireplaces warm the
common areas.
Despite the hotel's si/c, its ar
chitects made sure that the Ah
wahnee didn't interfere with the
park's natural beauty. Its
massive facade blends gracefully
with the grassy meadow and
cliffs which surround it. Inside
and out the hotel is an architec
tural work of art.
The Ahwahnee offers one of
the best and most romantic
dining rooms in California. The
room is a perfect blend of
elegance and naturalness.
Decorated in an oriental and In

dian motif, it is surrounded In
tall ceiling-to-floor picture win
dows. so that guests can enjoy
the beauty and serenity of the
majestic forest even while
seated indoors.
The menu, cuisine and service
are all exceptional. Visitors
should he aware that while
breakfast and lunch are quite
casual, dinner in the Ahwahnee
dining room is semi-formal.
Men are required to wear jack
ets and ties in the evening.
Accommodations at the Ah
wahnee include 121 rooms, in
cluding 24 cottages and six par
lor suites. The main hotel rooms

are beautiful and elegant; the
cottage suites offer a more rustic
and secluded atmosphere. All
rooms at the Ahwahnee are
open to reservation, including
the exclusive top floor suites
which were built for Stanford's
Tresidder family and recently
housed England's Oueen
Elizabeth II when she visited
California.
Room rates range from $117
to $157 per night, double oc
cupancy. While a bit expensive,
they are well worth the splurge.
Special midweek packages are
available which offer significant
savings on room rates and in
clude either two sessions in the
Yosemite Ski School and a full
day lift ticket at Badger Pass Ski
Area or an all-day cross-country
(Nordic) ski lesson at the
Y ose mite M o un tain ee ring
School. Yosemite's ski area,
Badger Pass, is expected to
remain open at least through the
Easter weekend.
Guests at the Ahwahnee are
offered numerous special
services. Complimentary tea is
served daily in the Great
Lounge from 5 to 5:30 p.m. and
a complimentary after-dinner
demitasse is served from 7:30
until 10 p.m. There is full room
service including a special five
course "Candlelight Dinner For
Two" available to all Ahwahnee
guests for $65.
The hotel also hosts several
special events throughout the
year. The most famous is the an
nual Christmas fete, the
Bracebridge Dinner. This
pageant is a re-creation of an
1819 tale about Bracebridge
Hall in Yorkshire, England. The
extravaganza, originally created
by Stanford's Donald Tresidder,
is a combination feast, festival
and play all in one.
Another more recent event at

the Ahwahnee is the annual
Vintner's Holiday. This is a
wine-tasting event featuring
seminars by some of California's
premiere vintners. Vintner's
Holiday provides an excellent
chance to taste the "grape" out
doors. Prices start at only $25
per person per night (Lodge)
and $40 (the Ahwahnee) and
include lodging and all tastings
and seminars. For date informa
tion contact Yosemite reserva
tions at (209) 252-4848. Ad
vance reservations are recom
mended lor all accommoda
tions.
For those wishing to stay in
Yosemite but unable to afford
the luxurv of the Ahwahnee.

Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany also offer accommodations
in the Yosemite Lodge. Or for
those who want the adventure
of tent-camping with the luxury
of a bed and mattress, electric
lighting and a hardwood floor,
there is Curry Village.
Lodge accommodations range
from $28.50 per night for
wooden cabins to $61 per night
for deluxe hotel rooms. Special
midweek ski packages are also
available.
The Yosemite Lodge rooms
are quite a bit more rustic than
those of the Ahwahnee. Our
room at the lodge was badly in
need of new carpeting and
painting. We had a beautiful

balcony overlooking a pine
grove, hut our balcony door was
so old it rarely locked when we
wanted to close it and had to be
kicked when we wanted it
opened. Unlike the Ahwahnee's
world class service, it took us
over two hours just to get an ex
tra towel delivered to our lodge
room.
Regardless of where you stay
in Yosemite. a visit to the Ah
wahnee is a must. Stop and en
joy an elegant meal in the dining
room or just wander through
the magnificent public rooms.

Hiking trails are everywhere in the park; one of the longer
and more arduous paths takes hikers up to the summit of
Yosemite Falls.

The Ahwahnee Hotel has a notorious guest list, having hosted royalty including Queen
Elizabeth II and other notables such as actress Judy Garland and Stanford's Tresidder family.Â«
