## Netmen face the old 1-2 punch 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
The Stanford men's tennis
team is looking for revenge.
After losing last weekend to
both No. 1-ranked UCLA and
No. 2-ranked USC, the Car
dinal has a chance to even the
score here this weekend.
The Cardinal will challenge
the Bruins this afternoon at
noon at the Varsity Courts. To
morrow's match against the
Trojans will begin at noon as
well, but with the No. 1 singles
and the top two doubles
matches beginning at 6:30 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion.
Head Coach Dick Gould sees
these matches as crucial in his
overall preparation for the
NCAA Tournament in early
May. "Right now, everything
focuses on getting ready for the
nationals," he said. "Our goal is
to be one of the top three teams.
We're third currently, but its a
tenuous third; we may not keep
it if we don't win this weekend.
"Last week I was hoping for a
solid effort. We got it. But this
week we need a win â€” at least
one," Gould said.
That won't be an easy task.
UCLA's lineup is very tough,
although it does not have an un
beatable superstar as in years
past. But it does have Jeff
Klaparda and Mike Kures, who
are currently ranked No. 11 and

No. 12, respectively. Still, Bruin
Head Coach Glenn Bassett
believes his team's strength lies
in the depth of its lineup.
"Everyone is pretty close to
each other," Bassett said. "I've
had better (and more talented)
teams in the past, but I don't
think I've been happier than
with this team here." It would
be difficult not to be happy with
the Bruins this year since they
have posted a 25-1 record.
Gould described the charac
ter of the team as the strength of
the Bruins. "They're scrappy
and tenacious and they're very
competitive," he said.
The manner in which UCLA
fought back against USC after
falling behind 4-0 (only to lose
5-4 in the third set of the final
match of the day), and their vic
tories over UC-Berkeley 9-0
and Stanford 6-3 last weekend,
are indicative of the Bruins'
competitive spirit.
Stanford's job is just as diffi
cult on Saturday, when it meets
USC. Three of the six Trojan
singles players are ranked in the
top 10 in the country, and their
doubles teams hold the No. 1, 2,
and 26 spots. Trojan Head
Coach Dick Leach is particu
larly pleased with his team's
doubles play.
"Our biggest strength would
be our doubles. The doubles

play has been very good for us
this year," he said.
Leach sees this as a great as
set especially when playing top
teams. "The singles matches are
early (in the order of events)
when the match is not on the
line. But it is on the line during
the doubles matches," he noted.
Thus, in a close match, the
Trojans are extremely tough be
cause their doubles squad is so
outstanding.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal
has reason to be optimistic
about turning last week's
defeats into victories. Stanford's
team captain, Mark McKeen,
who lost to USC's Jorge Lozano
last week, has beaten him on
three previous occasions.
"If I can stay close to him,
then I've got a good chance to
beat him," McKeen said. "In
the first set, he was pretty
pumped up. In the second set, I
tried to attack and pressure him
more, and I almost turned it
around."
Gould has a lot of confidence
in his team too, and for good
reason. Stanford sophomore
Dan Goldie is playing excep
tional tennis, and freshman
Derrick Rostagno has recovered
from an earlier injury to become
one of Stanford's strongest

players. The doubles team of
Jim Grabb and John Letts
played USC's team very close
last weekend as well.
"We're capable of winning
singles matches against both
(the UCLA and USC) teams,"
he said. "We know we can beat
their No. 1 doubles, and No. 2
doubles came very close to win
ning. We just have to put things
together. I think the home court
can make a difference."
Stanford is doing all it can to
take advantage of the home
court by arranging each day's
program to be almost ideal for
tennis fans. Instead of playing
all six singles matches simulta
neously, the matches will be
split up into two rounds, which
would allow every match to be
played within the tennis
stadium. Thus the four, five and
six singles, which rarely receive
direct support from the fans,
will play before the entire
crowd. Saturday's match against
USC will be played in a similar
fashion, but the top three
matches will be played in
Maples.
Gould said he expects a
crowd of about 5000 for the in
door matches. In addition,
spareribs and ice cream will be
given away to the first 250 stu
dents at Maples.

Having completely returned to form after an early-season injury, Derrick Rostagno may be
able to help Stanford get some revenge over UCLA and USC, both of which downed the Car
dinal last weekend.
