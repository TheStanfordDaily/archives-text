Stanford gymnasts Jon Levy and Randy Be
sosa put in excellent performances last
weekend in the NCAA Championships held at
UCLA.
Levy placed 15th overall with a total score of
110.35 and received All- America honors on
the rings with a 9.45 and a sixth-place finish.
Besosa placed 23th overall with a score of
107.40.
"I was very pleased with Jon's improvement
and progress over the past year." Head Coach
Sadao Hamada said. Levy placed 23rd at the
NCAAs last year. "Jon is also the first All
American we've had since three-time NCAA
pommel horse champion Ted Marcy, in 1976,"
Hamada said.
"I revised my ring set right before the com
petition," Levy said. "I was scoring lower with
it than I wanted to be all season. 1 knew I'd
have to add more difficulty if 1 wanted to make
I the finals."
Freshman Besosa also had strong and con

sistent performances. "The experience was
great and I'm really psyched for next year," he
said. "Both Jon and I plan on being in the top
10 all-around next year."
UCLA dominated the competition, taking
the top three all-around places, and placing
first in the team competition with a total of
287.30. Penn State placed second with 281.25
and Ohio State third with 281.10.
Stanford finished the season ranked 15th, up
from its 20th place finish a year ago.
Levy will be competing in the regional quali
fying meet in San Jose April 28th. He has
already qualified to compete in the USA
Championships to be held in Chicago in May.
"I want to add some difficulty to my routines
so I'll have a better chance of qualifying for the
Olympic Trials," Levy said. "I'm going to use
this regional competition as a practice meet."
Levy placed 48th in the USA Champion
ships last year but will be aiming for one of the
top 18 spots this year.
