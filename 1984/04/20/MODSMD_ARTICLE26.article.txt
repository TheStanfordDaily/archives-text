# Card netters down Gauchos
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Yesterday dawned like any other day.
The sun shined, students slept through
lectures, lunch at Food Service was mediocre
and the Stanford women's tennis team won
another match, defeating UC-Santa Bar
bara. 8-1. Nothing ever seems to change.
Take Patty Fendick. The freshman has
sometimes taken it easy on less talented op
ponents, which sometimes causes onlookers
to think she's having trouble. Take her first
set. which she won in a tie-breaker, 7-6.
Then Fendick got down to business and
destroyed Jena Strozier in the second set, 6-
0. Another routine win.
Linda Gates did her job a little quicker.
Gates played second singles yesterday and
put away Mollie Shea, 6-3, 6-0. No surprise
there.
Kate Gompert won again. So what?
Gompert is 18-1 this season. She loses
about as often as it snows here. Yesterday's
unfortunate-was Lisa Blackshear, who
quietly succumbed, 6-0, 6-2. Next victim,
please.
Michelle Weiss moved up to fourth
singles yesterday, a change from the usual
lineup. That's about all that was changed.
Weiss faced Leslie Lipser, and she had no
difficulty in recording a 6-2, 6-0 win.
Stephanie Savides had a three-set match.
Big deal. Savides probably leads the team in
three-set matches. The thing is — she wins
most of them. June Argus took the first set,
but Savides came back to win the next two
and the match, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4.
Here we go — an exception. Barbara
Baughman, who is usually not in the Car
dinal's starting lineup, got the nod at the
No. 6 position. She lost to Julie Newman, 6-
2, 6-3. Despite being down on the Stanford
ladder, Baughman wins more often then
not, but this was not one of those times.
So, in spite of that, the Cardinal clinched
the match by opening up an 5-1 lead in
.singles. Certainly not an uncommon oc
curence. Fans at Stanford matches have
learned not to show up a couple of hours
late — the doubles matches are usually as
crucial as studying for a physical education
class.
The Card has on occasion realized this
and foregone the doubles. Not yesterday.
The sweep began with Elise Burgin's second
match since returning from the back injury
that had sidelined her for the past several
months. Burgin hasn't forgotten how to win.
She teamed with Gates — the partner with
whom she was runner-up at NCAA's last
year — and the pair recorded a 6-3, 6-3 vic
tory over Blacksheart and Gamma Alexan
der.
The other doubles matches provided
more of the same. Savides and Fendick

defeated Newman and Lisa Glasser. 6-1, 6-
2, and Gompert and Leigh Anne Eldredge
beat Argus and Lisa Frank. 6-3. 6-2.
The win was the netters' 20th of the year.
They finish their non-conference schedule
with a perfect 7-0 mark, and only UC LA on

May 6 stands between them and a perfect
season.
Before that match, the Cardinal will
travel south for the Ojai Collegiate Cham
pionships next weekend and will host UC-
Berkeley in a mixed match May 5.
