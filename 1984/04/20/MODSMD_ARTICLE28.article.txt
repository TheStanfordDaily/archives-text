# Young admits mistake after 'wayside' comment

### 
Chicago (AP) — Los Angeles quarterback
Steve Young said yesterday that he felt ■"horrible"
about all the attention given his prediction that
the struggling United States Football League
"may soon fall by the wayside . . . sooner than you
think."
"I got involved in league politics and I shouldn't
have," said Young, who recently signed a $40 mil
lion contract with the Express to become the high
est paid player in professional football.
"I learned my lesson, and I'll bear the brunt for
it. 1 hope people don't make a big deal of it.... I'm
not perfect. But you've got to be careful what you
say. 1 will from now on."
In a telephone interview with Chicago reporters
the day before, the 21-year-old quarterback said
he thought the National Football League "is just
going to quietly take on about four or five teams
— very exciting ballclubs — and then watch the
rest of the league fall by the wayside. And it might
happen sooner than you think."
But at a news conference yesterday evening,
after arriving for today's game with the Chicago
Blitz, he pleaded guilty to talking too much about
things he shouldn't have.
"I guess I threw an interception there, but we'll
just have to recover," he said, adding that his
speculation of how many teams would likely

survive a merger with the NFL is "just guessing
along with every other sports fan in America
about what's going to happen."
He says he has no regrets about signing with the
USFL Express and emphasized that "I'm having
the time of my life out there on the field."
Earlier yesterday, the USFL issued a sharp
response out of its New York office.
. "His comments were unfortunate," said Jim
Byrne, the USFL's director of communications, in
a prepared statement. "They obviously were the
remarks of an inexperienced young man who
probably had little concept of the impact they
would have."
Young, who set or tied 13 NCAA passing
records while at Brigham Young University,
agreed.
"I take total blame for anything bad that comes
out of this," he said. "I feel horrible . . . I'm still
young and haven't learned yet what you can say
and what you can't."
He added that he was dismayed that the
publicity "turned out so negative."
"I said a lot of positive things about the USFL
in that interview," he said. "I talked about the
head-to-head competition and all the options the
league will have down the road. I think this was all
blown out of proportion."
