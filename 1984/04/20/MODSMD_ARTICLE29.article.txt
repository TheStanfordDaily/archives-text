## Big Macintosh attack leaves hundreds hungry 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer 
Some people.just can't get enough
of this draw thing.
As if testing their luck in the
housing draw wasn't enough, last
week more than 1800 Stanford stu
dents decided to play the game early
by entering the Macintosh lottery.
"The first 480 people are in the
process of getting systems," said Jan
Thomson, director of administrative
services for Information Technology
Services.
About 40-45 people a day are get
ting Macintoshes, she said, with "the
next 200 getting theirs in May."
But people at the end of the list will
not receive their computers until next
October, she estimates, because Ap
ple only has one plant to supply the
entire nation and they "just can't
produce enough systems to match
demand.
"We've been led to believe that by
this fall, the delivery problem will go
away, but to be honest, this remains to
be seen," said Thomson.
Junior Eric Dalgren drew number
1 10 and took delivery of his Macin
tosh vesterday. His reaction: "I wish I

could've drawn like that in the housing
draw."
Although he has no specific use in
mind. Dalgren said. "I figured it.was
such a good deal that I'd get one and
figure out something to use it for."
"I'm very pleased with the com
puter," said freshman David Lyle,
who drew 43. "It's one of the best
buys I've made."
Kyle is using his Macintosh for word
graphics and word processing.
For students who have not yet
placed an order but are still interested
in ordering a Macintosh, Thomson
advises that they go to IRIS
(Instruction & Research Information
Systems) in Cypress Hall to get infor
mation on the various systems and to
take advantage of the "excellent, ex
cellent consulting services."
The consulting is offered to help
students decide which system is right
for them, Thomson said.
"Everyone was extremely im
pressed with how very gracious the
people who ordered were about the
whole thing," said Thomson. "They
couldn't have been more accommo
dating and understanding."
