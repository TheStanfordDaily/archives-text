# University skeptical about USW elections
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
University officials remain reluctant
to recognize United Stanford Workers
(USW) Local 680 of Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) despite the overwhelming af
firmative vote in Wednesday's USW
election.
The 132 1 -member USW bargaining
unit approved Local 680 by a 630 to
125 vote in an election heralded as
having the largest turnout of any
Union election in USW's 1 1-year
history, thereby approving a disaffilia
tion with the larger Local 715.
Priscilla Wheeler, University staff
counsel, said she has several reserva
tions about the validity of the election.
She said yesterday the University has
yet to receive certification regarding
the results.
"All I know about the election is
what I read in The Daily," she said.
Wheeler added that neither Local
715, the 9000-member county-wide
union that has represented the USW
bargaining unit for the last four years,
nor the American Arbitrators Associ
ation (AAA), the group that con
ducted Wednesday's election, had
contacted the University regarding the
election.
"We haven't received any certifica
tion of a valid vote from anyone," she
said.
Mary Ann Tenuto, labor consultant
to USW Local 6KO, said that both
groups would be certifying the elec
tion within days. She said AAA was
waiting for seven absentee ballots to
be returned before certifying the elec
tion results. Tenuto said April 26
would be the deadline for receiving
absentee ballots and that AAA would
certify the election at that time.
Tenuto also claimed that Local 715
would speedily inform the University
of its support ol the election results.
"Local 715 will be sending the Uni
versity a letter saying that Local 680 is
their legitimate successor, she said.

Michael Baratz, executive secretary
ot Local 715, affirmed this, saying the
union is in the process of notifying the
University of the succession.
But Wheeler also questioned the
wording of the ballot, which she said
left "no choice" between accepting
Local 680 or remaining with Local
715.
Wednesday's ballot read as follows:
"Do you want Stanford University to
recognize United Stanford Workers,
Service Employees International
Union Local 680, for purposes of col
lective bargaining on your behalf, and
to administer and enforce your current
contract?"
Wheeler claims that the ballot left
unclear that a choice between Locals
715 and 680 even existed, which she
says was "misleading."
Wheeler also said the University
would not recognize Local 680 until
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) reached a decision on unfair
labor practice charges the University
filed against both local unions in
March for disaffiliating without a vote.
Wheeler said the University would
await the NLRB's decision before
making any binding acknowledgement
of Local 680.
Tenuto denied there was any am
biguity regarding the ballot's wording.
"We believe we have acted in accor
dance with NLRB law and that we
(Local 680) are now the legal repre
sentatives of Stanford workers," she
said.
Tenuto also claims that USW ex
pects "a favorable decision" from the
NLRB when it gives a ruling early
next week. She said the disaffiliation
had proceeded in accordance with
labor law and precedent and the union
had no cause for concern.
She added that once the NLRB
hands down its ruling, the University
will no longer have any grounds what
soever to delay recognition. "Once the
NLRB makes a decision, the Univer
sity' will be obligated to abide by that
decision," she said.
