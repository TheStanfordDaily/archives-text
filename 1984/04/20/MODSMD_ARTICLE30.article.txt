There is a strange, mixed
feeling upon encountering a
"Mom and Pop" type Mexican
rrestaurant like La Huasteca. In
itially, there is almost a dread of
the decor, replete with bullfight

posters, linoleum floor and
plastic-covered tables and
chairs, all giving a quasi
cafeteria impression. But upon
leaving, one is also struck by the
unique flavor of a piping-hot
meal served in authentic
Mexican style amidst people
who know what real Mexican
food is.
Located in a Chicano neigh

borhood in Menlo Park, La
Huasteca is small and and un
complicated, and so is its menu.
Although the variety of beer
is large, including Mexican and
domestic brands, and the soda
and wine lists adequate, there is
not a margarita to be found. In
fact, the menu is free of many
of the California-Mexican
mainstays — ehimi-changas.

tacos, nachos — so popular
among more commercial restau
rants.
Indeed, the best word to
describe La Huasteca is authen
tic. English is spoken, but as the
owners and clientele are
primarily Mexican, even halting
Spanish might prove surpris
ingly successful in ordering.
In keeping with the tradi

tional Mexican atmosphere,
before dinner came the conven
tional tortilla chips and picante
sauce, which was almost too
spicy to handle. In addition, we
ordered an appetizer order of
guacamole which was thick and
flavorful.
Although the menu featured
some exotic entrees such as pig's
feet, we opted for more sedate

choices. Polio a la Mexicana,
chicken Mexican style, was an
adequate, although certainly not
abundant, meal. Drenched in a
tomato-based sauce, the
chicken was garnished with
onions, and was slightly peppery
but not overpowering. It was ac
companied by rice sprinkled
with paprika and retried beans.
The traditional Mexican

Enchilada de Queso was filled
with melted cheese, and covered
by a bed of sour cream and
shredded lettuce. It was gar
nished with two jalapeno pep
pers which, although colorful,
are better left uneaten. The

enchilada came with a surpris
ingly crispy, fried chicken
drumstick and curried rice. The
dish was very filling and in
cluded retried beans and tomato
slices.
Our choice of corn or wheat
tortillas was also included, and
were a welcomed, albeit bland
complement to a spicy meal.
Although we were somewhat
disappointed by the fact that the
menu offered no desserts, large,
steaming hot cups of coffee
were a nice final touch.
As there were surprisingly
few customers for a Saturday
night, the service was excellent,
with virtually no waiting be
tween courses. The atmosphere
was relaxed, and a jukebox
cranked loud Mexican tunes
throughout the meal.
The owners were reluctant to
converse in English but did so
freely in their native language,
and a young Mexican girl from
the next table felt free to invite
herself for a sample of our beer.
As the only Americans in the
restaurant, we enjoyed a spicy
taste of Mexico.
