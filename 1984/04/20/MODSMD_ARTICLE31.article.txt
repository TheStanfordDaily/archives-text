A friend of ours, a Stanford graduate and a
rather popular Sacramento restaurant critic,
has a certain theory about Mexican and
Chinese restaurants.
"It's the great HO percent," he says often.
"Eighty percent of all Mexican and Chinese
restaurants are just fine, neither very special
nor very had. Ten percent are truly wonderful,
and 10 percent are truly awful. But most are in
the great SO percent."
The Red Pepper is a strong contender in the
80 percent variety; it is neither particularly
good nor particularly bad. There are no
surprises, either way.
The first non-surprise at The Red Pepper is
the übiquitous basket of nachos on the table.
The Red Pepper's variety is a good one — hot
and a little greasy, just as nachos should be.
The accompanying sauce was a little hot for

either of us, but then we aren't the insane
burn-our-mouths-with-incredibly-hot-food
types.
And that brings up another point. The Red
Pepper wins big kudos from both of us in one
very important area: water. Too many restau
rants bring water only after a certain amount of
pleading, and then forget that your empty glass
and burning throat exist from then on out.
The Red Pepper was a pleasant exception.
Our waitress filled our glasses every time she
passed the table. We never went thirsty, and
that made us happy.
We decided, probably foolishly, to order the
$4.25 appetizer nachos. For four people, the
nachos could have been an appetizer. For the
two of us, they should have been dinner. The

Red Pepper's nachos come on a giant plate
("Hot plate, hot plate," the waitress kept
saying) and are piled high with mounds'of sour
cream and guacamole. The sour cream was
abundant and fresh, but the avocadoes in the
gaucomole were overpowered by the onions.
But it didn't really matter. We scraped the
plate clean.
We probably shouldn't have. When our din
ners came five minutes later, neither of us was
hlingrv enough to eat much. But in the name of
journalism, we ate on.
One of us ordered The Red Pepper Grande.
At $7.50, the Grande is a fairly typical
Mexican combination plate, with a taco, a
cheese enchilada, a tamale, a chile relleno and
the ever-present rice and beans.
Nothing was bad, but nothing was that won
derful, either. The enchilada and beans were
very cheesy, and the taco was a taco. Not much
more can be said.
The other ordered the flautas, a pair of
rolled, fried corn tortillas filled with spiced
shredded beef and covered with sour cream
and the same onion-powered guacamole. At
$5.95, the flautas were better than most and
not impossibly crunchy, as many are.
The Red Pepper is decorated in a toned
down version of the standard Mexican restau
rant flavor. There are, thank God, no black
velvet bullfighter prints.
The Red Pepper offers wine and beer, im
ported and domestic, and take out food as well.
So for a quiet, reasonably-priced Mexican
meal. The Red Pepper is a fine choice — but
just one in that great 80 percent.
