Mexican restaurants aren't exactly rare around here no matter
him the\ tr> to hide themselves away. Casa Isabel, located at 2434
Park Blvd. around the corner from California Avenue, isn't exactly
hiding behind those Mexican wall hangings it uses as curtains, but it
doesn't exactly jump out at you either.
Its two small dining rooms serve a varied clientele for lunch and
dinner. Noontime brings the business crowd and dinnertime brings
in the families and the regulars. The family-run restaurant provides

a pleasant dining atmosphere amid the sombreros and toucans
hanging from the walls and ceilings.
And we mean family-run. As son Sergio Almendares explained.
"My mother does the cooking, my father helps out and my two
sisters are the waitresses.'' The Tuesday night we were there the
restaurant was quite empty, not surprising on a week night, but
most of the diners were regulars who knew the family well. We
overheard some of them asking Sergio how his parents were and
making friendly conversation.
But what about the food, you ask. We started out with a pitcher of
Sangria ($5) and four chicken flautas served with guacamole and
sour cream ($3.80) for an appetizer. We passed on the usual nachos
and margaritas. The flautas were good and crisp but difficult to eat
without plates.
The menu offers a wide range of entrees for such a small restau
rant. You can order dinners served with rice and beans, steak and
seafood specials a la carte or even platos tipicos. The dinners in
clude the usual fare such as Chile Verde — chunks of pork loin,
made in green sauce, salad and tortillas ($7.55) — and the Ureen
Burrito — cubes of sirloin rolled in a flour tortilla, topped with a
mild sauce and cheese, chile relleno and salad ($7.65). In the spe
cials category, one can delve into the Steak Picado — diced New
York steak sauteed and cooked with tomatoes, onions and peppers
($8.25) or maybe the Puerto Vallarta Plate, which is two enchiladas
filled with crab meat, topped with diced avocados, green olives,
tomatoes sourcream and marisco sauce and comes with rice and
salad ($8.50).
We opted for the a la carte Tostadas Jardin ($8) and the platos
tipicos Chimichangas ($7.25). The tostadas were huge. We're
talking big. It was a good tostada because it wasn't all-lettuce as you
often find elsewhere. The chicken, covered with beans, lettuce,
cheese, tomatoes, guacamole, avocado, olives and sour cream
tasted scrumptious. They were, as advertised, quite crispy. As one
of our roommates said after finishing off the second one (which we
had to take home because there was so much), it tasted just as good
the second day as it did the first.
The Chimichangas weren't as promising. The beef version served
on two flour tortillas fried to a crispy, golden brown were topped
with guacamole, sour cream and parmesan cheese and served with
rice and beans. The chimichangas were fairly large but just weren't
anything special. One certainly can find the same quality much
cheaper at some place like Casa Real.
The best part of a visit to Casa Isabel is tasting the homemade
sauces. Sergio explained to us that the restaurant no longer makes
its own tortillas because it found quite good pre-made ones. We
found the tortillas to be fine.
Our total bill came to just over $25 — quite expensive for a visit
to a small Mexican restaurant. And that's the only real gripe we
have about Casa Isabel. The food is fine, but it does not seem to be
so outstanding as to warrant such high prices.
The restaurant is open for lunch Monday through Friday 11:30
a.m. to 2 p.m. and for dinner from 5:30 p.m. until 9 p.m. (10 p.m.
on Friday). On Saturdays, dinner is served from 5 p.m. until 9:30
p.m.. and the restaurant is closed on Sunday.
