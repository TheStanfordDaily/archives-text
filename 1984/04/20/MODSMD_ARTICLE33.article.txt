# Is it really the best burrito?

1 do not stay up late into
the night debating about
where to find the best burrito
in town, but apparently some
people do. Some of these
burrito aficionados claim
that this honor belongs to
Estrellita Restaurant in Los
Altos.
This praise combined with
the fact that Estrellita has
existed for 30 years makes
one curious about the source
of its success.
It probably isn't the
drooping string of Christmas
lights that adorns the outside
of the sort of nondescript
building near San Antonio
Shopping Center. Although
these lights are cleverly ar
ranged in a green, white and
red pattern like the Mexican
tlag, over half of the bulbs
are burned out. so this just
doesn't seem to be the secret.
It could be the pink walls
inside the restaurant, which
are highlighted by hot pink
beams, but somehow 1 doubt
it. Another familiar Mexican
establishment, Taco Tio, has
a similar color scheme on the
outside and that doesn't
seem to have done wonders
for it.
I also doubt whether it's
the pictures of entrees that
canvas the walls when you
walk in â€” the calendars,
mexican rugs, posters or for
mica tables.
In fact, the formula for
Estrellita's success does not
become at all obvious until
the entrees arrive, and even
then only if you have chosen
carefully. The food is spicy,
of good quality, and
generous. Most of the tortil
las are homemade and so is
the chorizo, a spicy mexican
sausage, as are many of the
sauces. One might be
tempted to say that it's more

"authentic" Mexican food,
or that it tastes like "what
Mom makes." but since I've
never been to Mexico, and
Mom generally makes
enchiladas a la Van de
kampes. I'll have to just sav
that it tasted good.
However, your meal at
Estrellita could well be onlv
average if you don't order
carefully. The menu is exten
sive and as the manager later
told us that there are items
for both the veteran and
those who have ulcers.

We oidered the great hur
rito with chicken and beans
($5.25) and the chalupa
($4.75). The meal started
out with the basic chips and
picante sauce of the ex
tremely hot variety, which
eventually led the waitress to
leave a pitcher of water at
the table. I've heard that
drinking water just makes
your mouth hotter but the
relief was still appreciated. A
rather unattractive salad,
which is included in the meal,
followed.
The "great" in the name of
the burrito refers to both the
large size and the flavor. It
consists of a huge homemade
flour tortilla stuffed with
chicken and beans and cov
ered with sauce and cheese. I
would recommend the spicy
green sauce which is made in

large quantities everyday and
is thick with green chiles. It is
strong and flavorful and a hit
different than the average
red sauce. The flavor combi
nation of the burrito was
delicious, but do not expect
to eat it with your hands be
cause it is huge and messy.
The chalupa consists of
two flour tortillas sandwich
ing shredded chicken and
cheese and covered with sour
cream and parmesan cheese.
This is a rather bland entree
and would be good tor some-

one who doesn't like the
more standard mexican fare.
There was a little too much
sour cream and not enough
parmesan cheese for my
tastes.
This restaurant would be a
good transition from the
highly commercialized
mexican restaurants and the
whole- in-the-wall places
where you need a working
vocabulary in Spanish and an
iron tongue to survive. The
restaurant is popular and the
clientale the night I tried it
consisted of lots of gringos.
When you go be sure to ask
your waitress to tell you
about the restaurant's best
food, and the meal should be
satisfying.
