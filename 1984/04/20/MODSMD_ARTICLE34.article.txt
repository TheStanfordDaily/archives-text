i* rant seems to he the Stanford

| nian interpretation of quasi-
I Mexican dining. It's truly an
I expansive set-up with a very
I large bar area to the right of
I the entrance hallway and a
I large dining area to the left.
I The margaritas and bar are
| probably its biggest attrac
tion and money maker, so
the restaurant is designed
K with this in mind.
The dining area is divided
I into several sections and on a
( Friday night the bar is filled
| to capacity with various

modifications of the basic
"yuppie" (young urban
professional) theme. The
decor is some sort of
California - Mexican - Casa
blanca cross-over, which,
if not scrutinized too closely,
evokes this mixed ambience
without being overly offen
sive.
Moving right along from
first impressions to the
hostess' podium, one should
be prepared to wait a good
50 minutes for a table at 8
p.m. on a Friday. We went
without the wait in the bar to
run some errands, though
everyone certainly looked to
be having a good time in that
direction.
Upon returning and being

immediately seated at 9 p.m.
we dug right into the very
warm, fresh and crisp tortilla
chips (free), tasty guacamole
($3.50) and rather strong (in
my lightweight opinion) mar
garitas, all of which, particu
larly this last item, explained
the happy bar atmosphere.
The menu was basic with
the exception of some inter
esting nightly specials and
other regulars such as the
crab enchiladas. We ordered
the Friday night special,
Steak Pedro ($8.75) and the
secciones ($6.50), both of
which included salad, beans
and rice. The Steak Pedro
consisted of tender cuts of
steak marinated in a special
red sauce, which our waiter

claimed would not be too
spicy. Our choice for sec
ciones was a tamale which
was rumored to be spicy, and
chile relleno, rumored to be
very good and especially
suited for those with a lower
spice tolerance.
Our service was attentive
and helpful — both the chip
basket and water glasses
were never empty for more
than a few seconds, and our
waiter was more than accom
modating in suggesting din
ner choices. Salads arrived
almost immediately. Both
main dishes were good and,
as the case in most Cal-Mex
restaurants, the portions
were more than generous.
Though I had a bit of trou
ble distinguishing one item
from the other upon arrival,
as everything blended into
one smear on the plate,
things became quite iden
tifiable once I started eating.
The tamale was spicy as
promised and the chile rel
leno mild, while the Steak
Pedro was just plain good.
A second visit would,
however, definitely lend it
self to tasting some of the
more unusual specialties,
such as the aforementioned
crab enchilada. I'm sure they
don't eat this in Mexico but
what the heck, they're not
fooling anybody with the
food here anyway.
After such an abundant
meal one could hardly con
sider dessert and it's even
harder to consider since
Pedro's doesn't really offer
any real desserts. But if you
really must, there are several
liqueur-coffee combinations
all topped with whipped
cream and chocolate
sprinkles ($3).
Overall, the restaurant is
what it appears to be with
very few surprises. My sug
gestion is to take a deep
breath and a group of good
friends, plunge into the bar
for some yummy margaritas
while waiting for a table,
then enjoy a filling dinner in
an entirely Calif ornian-
