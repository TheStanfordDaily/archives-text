# A 						fast-food burrito tip
## 
### TROY EID 
Vou can't expect me to rehash rriy life story
again. I hit all the best points in last month's
Vinebergian stream-of-unconscious vignette on
Chez Louis, in which I duly demonstrated my
worldliness by deploying lots of foreign words.
But I've really got a deadline this time, so let's
rush to the point. The peninsula is still besmirched
by evil eateries, but there's a place a little north of
here that has tasty, cheap Mexican food.
Why would anybody drive all the way up to
Millbrae to expend time and resources on El
Super Burrito? One friend lured me over there
last weekend with his pledge that "the burritos

weigh at least three pounds."
My friend says he first heard about the place
from an old roommate who used to head up there
for lunch everyday. That guy must have been
weird. But if you're near the airport you ought to
take the Millbrae St. Exit and turn right after a
few blocks. It's on the right side of the street.
If that's confusing, just head north on El
Camino. If you see a sign advertising First Na
tional Bank of Coos Bay, you've probably gone
too far.
Interjection: Apparently this place is or used to
be a Band hangout, which may or may not be an
endorsement.
My friend wants everybody to try El Super, and
he's got a point. It's open every day of the week
and even offers take-out, but don't expect much. I
phoned in an order from here on Tuesday. I'm
still waiting.
