Bringing Hp Baby (1938)
Kresge Auditorium
Katharine Hepburn (as a daffy
heiress), Gary Grant (as a
paleontologist) and twin
leopards, one of which responds
to a chorus of "I Can't Give You
Anything but Love, Baby," star
in this Howard Hawks classic —
everyone's favorite screwball
comedy. Some sequences, like
the one in which Hepburn
swings on a jail cell door and
tells the company, "They call me
Swinging Door Susie," are so
hilarious that you chuckle over
them in private for years, though
it isn't easy to explain why to
someone who hasn't seen the
movie. Dudley Nichols and
Hagar Wilde wrote the script,
which is performed by a tip-top
cast including May Robson,
Charles Ruggles, Walter Catlett,
Fritz Feld, Jonathan Hale and
Barry Fitzgerald.
Plays tonight at 9,
The Big Chill (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
A glib, empty movie about the
middle-aged crises of the
children of the 19605, written
and directed by Lawrence Kas
dan (Barbara Benedek col
laborated on the screenplay), in
which the jazzy montages sug
gest rock videos and the musical
selections not only determine
the editing but also define the
content of each scene. A group
of college friends learns of the
suicide of one of their number
and gathers to mourn him and
re-examine their own lives. In
this movie about the triumph of
friendship over the scariness of
the world outside, the women
are warm and maternal and a
little dopey, and the ultimate
sacrifice to propagate the '60s
spirit occurs when one of them
lets her husband sleep with her
best friend so that she, too, can
becomc a mother. Jeff
Goldblum and William Hurt
give the best performances; the
cast also includes Glenn Close,
Kevin Kline. Mary Kay Place,
Tom Berenger, Jobeth Williams
and Meg Tilly.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.'
The Philadelphia Story
(1940)
Cubberley Auditorium
The quintessential Hollywood
studio entertainment. Philip
Barry wrote this sparkling high
comedy in 1939; Katharine
Hepburn, who had been
declared box office poison after
a series of movie flops, left for
Broadway to play the role of
Tracy Lord, the rich girl with an
intolerance for weakness, and
the film version, the following
year, marked her triumphant
return. Donald OgiJen :nl'wflPP
adapted the play, George Cukor
directed it.and Hepburn's co
stars were Cary Grant and Jim
my Stewart, whose portrayal of
the love-struck reporter
Macaulay Connor won him an
Oscar. These three give the
definitive performances of their
roles; Barry's lines are so
marked with their readings that
the play has never succeeded in
revival, and a musical film ver
• sion. High Society, in 1956 (with
Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and
Frank Sinatra), was cut-rate and
crass. With Ruth Hussey,
Roland Young, John Halliday,
Mary Nash, Virginia Weidler.

John Howard and Henry
Daniell; shot (in glistening black
and whit£) by Joseph Rutten
berg, and designed by Cedric
Gibbons.
Plays Monday evening at 8.
The Elephant Man (1980)
Adelfa Lounge (Lagunita);
Madera Lounge (Wilbur)
David Lynch's remarkable
movie about John Merrick, the
"Elephant Man," a human being
hideously deformed from birth.
The screenplay by Christopher
DeVore, Eric Bergren and
Lynch is strong and unsentimen
tal, but the film is romantic — in
the truest sense. It subject is the
triumph of the human spirit over
the horrors of birth and environ
ment. John Hurt is superb as
Merrick; Anthony Hopkins,
much more restrained than
usual, is surprisingly effective as
Frederick Treves, the London
doctor who "discovers" him.
Freddie Francis' magnificent
black and white photography
emphasizes the symbols of the
Industrial Revolution: The film
looks like Dickens might have
directed it. With fine supporting
performances by John Gielgud
and Wendy Hiller.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30
(Adelfa) and Tuesday evening at
6:30 (Madera).
The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
In Hollywood in the 19405,
there were Orson Welles, Pres
ton Sturges, Vincente Minnelli
and John Huston — and that was
about it, except for the oc
casional picture by William
Wyler or William Wellman. In
the context of that artistically
parched decade, this movie —
Huston's variation on Greed —
flawed as it is, seems truly
remarkable: tough-minded and
self-assured in all but a few
scenes, with sections that make
you think of Conrad and
Hemingway. The major flaws
are Max Steiner's music and the
sentimentality that creeps into a
scene in which a loving letter is
read aloud. Also, Tim Holt, a
very uninspired actor who had
the good luck to keep landing
roles in terrific pictures (he's the
young heir of The Magnificent
Ambersons), is just adequate as
the youngest of the three
nrnsner.tors whUS£^tOrv„HuS.ton
tells. But Humphrey Bogart is
stupendous as the paranoic, Fred
C. Dobbs; it's his best perfor
mance. And everything Huston's
father Walter does makes you
grin. (He won the supporting
actor Oscar for his work.) Shot
by Ted McCord; based on a
novel by B. Traven.
Plays through Wednesday
with Beat the Devil.
Melvin and Howard (1980)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Bo Goldman wrote this im
aginative reconstruction of the
possible meeting between Mel
vin Dummar (Paul Le Mat) and
Howard Hughes (Jason

Robards) in the Nevada desert
and about the eight years be
tween that night and Hughes'
death — and the uncovering of
the so-called "Mormon will,"
which named Dummar as one of
the beneficiaries. It's a classic
American comedy, directed by
Jonathan Demme, who gives it a
unique texture and lyricism.
There aren't any stock charac
ters in this movie; everybody has
idiosyncrasies, but Demme and
Goldman do not condescend to
any of them. Featuring excellent
performances by Le Mat, Mary
Steenburgen and Pamela Reed
as his two wives, and Jason
Robards, who towers over the
movie.
Plays Thursday with One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
Shoot the Piano Player (1960)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Charles Aznavour plays the
title role in this justly famous
Francois Truffaut tragicomedy,
which he and Marcel Moussy
adapted from a David Goodis
novel. Like Godard in
Breathless, Truffaut takes the
American gangster melodramas
of the '30s and '40s as his start
ing point; what he ends up with
is charming and lyrical and al
together unpredictable. Raoul
Coutard is the photographer,
and of the supporting players,
Marie Dubois makes the most
memorable appearance.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Jules and Jim.
Beat the Devil (1954)
Festival, Palo Alto
One of the greatest flukes —
and one of the greatest jokes —
in movie history. Truman
Capote and the director, John
Huston, wrote the script while
the movie was being made, and
reputedly the actors learned of
the plot developments one day
at a time. Perhaps if it had been
made in a more conventional
manner, this exotic intrigue
spoof wouldn't have been so
quirky and uninflated, or the
performers so creatively
idiosyncratic — except for
Humphrey Bogart, who lumbers
through the picture with obvious
lack of conviction. Gina Lol
lobrigida, Robert Morley, Peter
Lorre and especially Jennifer
Jones are much more successful,
and the film is a riot. The fluke
didn't extend to the box office,
Vivinvtci; ritfai<\.iaYly,**Oeu< the
Devil was a calamity.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre.
Camelot (1967)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The inept director, Joshua
Logan, can't seem to decide
whether he wants magic or
realism, Broadway or romance,
in this ill-fated adaptation of the
Lerner-Loewe musical about
King Arthur and the Knights of
the Round Table. On stage, the
material cries out for the ex
pansiveness of the big screen,
but Logan has little imagination
and he never really mastered the

film medium — almost every
scene appears to be a gigantic
mistake. (Did he get to supervise
this blockbuster because of his
reputation as a Broadway direc
tor?) The breathtaking Vanessa
Redgrave works some magic of
her own, however, in the role of
Guenevere. With Richard Harris
wailing away as Arthur, Franco
Nero as a beefcake Lancelot,
David Hemmings as Mordred
and Laurence Naismith as Mer
lin.
Plays Sunday with The
Lion in Winter.

Eraser head (1976)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
David Lynch's film starts out
as a demonically funny vision of
American family life and turns
into a nightmare about things
that squish and spurt and float:
It might be called The Liquefac
tion of America. Watching this
movie — and listening to it (the
aural_ genius Alan Splet devised
the soundtracTc; ITT which nor
mally incompatible noises, like
ringing and sizzling, melt into
each other) — is such a dis
orienting experience that you
may walk around for the rest of
the evening with your head
cocked to the side and one eye
half-closed. The best images in
the picture (which Lynch wrote,
designed, produced and di
rected) are worthy of Dali. Jack
Nance plays Henry, a young man
with a permanently pained ex
pression and hair cut like a badly
trimmed swath of carpet whose
wife gives birth to a monster
with a shrivelled cobra's head.
Plays Thursday with Freaks.
