# Senate hears report on new LOTS plan
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer 
The nightmare of endless queues at
LOTS may finally be coming to an
end. Vice Provost Robert Street told
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
A new machine has arrived and will
be in use at LOTS by May, decreasing
the load on the present LOTS A and E
machines. Last winter there were
7000 users at LOTS, and the facilities
only have capacity for 3000, Street
said.
There was also a 115 percent in
crease in enrollment in the second
level computer science courses, in
stead of a decrease that one might ex
pect because of overloading, Street
said.
Over the next two years Street said
that LOTS administrators hope to be
able to take "the next technological
step." a bigger capacity machine that
would be compatible with the present 1
DEC2O machines. Unfortunately, the
necessary machine does not presently I
exist. s
Also outlined in Street's report v
were plans for increasing student i
access to terminals by installing more F
in Terman Engineering Center and
in dormitories.

"The Microdisc program led to or
ders for about 17 50 personal pur
t chases of microcomputers in the first
» two weeks. Action is continuing and
i many are taking seriously our advice
to seek help and to take their time in
11 making selections," Street said. In or
g der to aid students in their decisions

e tion Systems (IRIS) program a ill give

The students are not the only ones
who need help in handling all the new
technology. Law Prof. John Mer
ryman said of Street's acronym-filled
report, "What is very seriously needed
is an effort to bridge the gup ... it is
not such a problem for the students as
for us aging faculty . . . we want to
take advantage but we don't really un
derstand what you're talking about."
But Street said the Faculty Authoi
Development Program is aimed at
"putting micro-computers in the ,
hands of faculty, backed by as much
support as they need." The program
will help in the implementation of fac
ulty ideas for academic use of com
puter systems.
The Faculty Senate also discussed
the role of the Hoover institution at
yesterday's meeting.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
criticized as too biased toward Hoover
the six-person group formed to advise
the Board of Trustee's committee
about appointment procedures at the
Hoover Institution. The committee
consists of two members of Hoover,
two faculty members who have no as
sociation with Hoover and two with
joint appointments.
"In seeking this mix did you not
foresee, given the propensity of
human beings not to bite the hand
which feeds them, that, on any contro
versial point, there would very prob
ably be four votes in favor of the
Hoover position?" Rebholz asked
University President Donald Ken
nedy.
Rebholz also asked the president
when the University would consider
the question of whether Hoover, as an
institution, espouses a political ideol
ogy. This is also the question raised in

a petition Rebholz and political sci
ence Prof. John Manley have circ
ulated since February.
To support his contentions, Rebholz
referred to statements made by Presi
dent Reagan, who called Hoover the
brightest star in a small constellation
of conservative think tanks.
Kennedy responded, "Why aren t
we looking at the question of whether
the Hoover Institution has a political
ideology? The answer is that we
simply don't consider that the primary
question . . . The primary question is
government appointments."
Another issue that was brought up
at the meeting that is not yet resolved
is the issue of proposed Department of
Defense (DoD) restrictions on unclas
sified but sensitive research. The re
strictions would include DoD review
of research before publication.
"Even in the worst case, contracts
likely slated for that kind of review
would be an extremely small
percentage . . . nevertheless it is a sig
nificant principle and I would preter
that the Department of Defense not
adopt it in any (research)," Kennedy
said.
