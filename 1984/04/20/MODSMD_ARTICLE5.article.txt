## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer 
The nightmare of endless queues at
LOTS may finally be coming to an
end. Vice Provost Robert Street told
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
A new machine has arrived and will
be in use at LOTS by May, decreasing
the load on the present LOTS A and E
machines. Last winter there were
7000 users at LOTS, and the facilities
only have capacity for 3000, Street
said.
There was also a 115 percent in
crease in enrollment in the second
level computer science courses, in
stead of a decrease that one might ex
pect because of overloading, Street
said.
Over the next two years Street said
that LOTS administrators hope to be
able to take "the next technological
step." a bigger capacity machine that
would be compatible with the present 1
DEC2O machines. Unfortunately, the
necessary machine does not presently I
exist. s
Also outlined in Street's report v
were plans for increasing student i
access to terminals by installing more F
in Terman Engineering Center and
in dormitories.

"The Microdisc program led to or
ders for about 17 50 personal pur
t chases of microcomputers in the first
Â» two weeks. Action is continuing and
i many are taking seriously our advice
to seek help and to take their time in
11 making selections," Street said. In or
g der to aid students in their decisions
B the Instruction and Research Informa
e tion Systems (IRIS) program a ill give
s technical advice and aid in software
t selection and utilization
The students are not the only ones
who need help in handling all the new
technology. Law Prof. John Mer
ryman said of Street's acronym-filled
report, "What is very seriously needed
is an effort to bridge the gup ... it is
not such a problem for the students as
for us aging faculty . . . we want to
take advantage but we don't really un
derstand what you're talking about."
But Street said the Faculty Authoi
Development Program is aimed at
"putting micro-computers in the ,
hands of faculty, backed by as much
support as they need." The program
will help in the implementation of fac
ulty ideas for academic use of com
puter systems.
