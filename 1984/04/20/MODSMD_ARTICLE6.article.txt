# How much do students here know about the world outside?

Although universities in the Bay Area may
not adequately prepare their students tor the
challenges ot intematational business and
diplomacy. Stantord does a tairly good job. a
recent study says.
The study, funded by the Hewlett Founda
tion. noted that although 25 percent ol the
United States gross national product involves
foreign trade, most college graduates are ig
norant about international subjects and aie
unable to speak or read a foreign language.
Of the estimated 100.000 students included
in the study, only 3 percent took courses con
cerning overseas issues such as history,
politics, economics and literature. Ihree times
as many students studied Western Europe
than studied any other region, and only 471
students in the entire Bay Area took courses
about Asia, the study said.
"This study was part of a larger effort to
raise the consciousness ot the public in the
Bay Area to linkages that the Bay Area has to
the outside world," said Robert Watd. direc
tor of the Center for International Research
Studies here. ,
And. Ward said, the study showed that in
ternational awareness is higher here than at
neighboring universities.

"By comparison to other universities in the
area Stanford is very good indeed. The area as
a whole stands out highly as far as interna
tional awareness is concerned. You cannot
match the combination of Berkeley and Stan
ford anywhere in the country, except maybe in
New York City, with Columbia and Prince
ton." he said.
But although students and professors here
said they feel Stanford students have a basic
knowledge of the world outside of their own
country, they say that knowledge is less than it
could be.
"They're not as bad as the national average
of their age," said junior Neil Rimer, a Swiss
student here. "Some are really aware, and
others like to think they are, but don't make
enough of an effort to find out what's going
on."
But Jan Nash, a senior majoring in Ameri
can Studies, counters that "Stanford students
are not provincial."
"They read the newspapers, they know
what some of the trends are. As a rule, they
know what's going on although they might not
understand it." Nash said.
Many said they feel students" lack of aware
ness is not a reflection on Stanford, but on the
climate of the United States as a nation.
"America is designed to be self sufficient in

every way," Rimer said. "People go through
life here with one language, and by the nature
of their upbringing they are not really pushed
to explore. You can't fault the University for
it."
Political science Prof. David Danelski
agreed.
"The main thing is that most Stanford stu
dents are American," he said. "That's a start
ing point. Because of their geological isola
tion, Americans are not pressed to learn about
the rest of the world."
"Americans are not particularly aware be
cause they have never had a need to be â€”
they've always been in a power position," said
Christina Fink, a sophomore who plans to
study at a Japanese university next year.
"Stanford students have a responsibility to
become more aware politically because, as a
particularly intelligent group, they will have a
lot of power to have a big impact later on."
Others attributed Stanford students' gen
eral lack of international concern to more per
vasive trends of political apathy and increased
vocational pursuits.
"In the late '60s and early '70s students
were more politically committed, and had
more political experience. Few students get
