Cease fire monitors take posts

Beirut. Lebanon — After hours of delay caused by sniper
fire, a team of Lebanese cease-fire observers took up posi
tions between Beirut's warring militias yesterday as President
Amin Gemayel flew to Damascus seeking Syrian help in en
ding the violence here.
The deployment of the observer force, made up of about
100 retired Lebanese army officers, was the first phase of a
plan to disengage Christian and Moslem militiamen along the
main fighting front — the so-called Green Line that divides
Beirut's Christian and Moslem sectors.
The observers were originally scheduled to move into the
area at noon after gathering at the old Beirut race track,
which is near the only crossing point between Christian East
and mostly Moslem West Beirut that remains open. But
sniper fire along the line delayed the operation and it was not
until early afternoon that the observers began occupying the
posts from which they will oversee the cease-fire.
T he next phase of the operation is scheduled to begin
today, when an estimated 1800 army recruits are to fan out
along the Green Line, as well as in the nearby mountains, to
act as a buffer between the Christian and Moslem militias. As
the observers gathered at the race track, they were issued
white helmets similar to the ones worn by the 40 French sol
diers who have been sent to Beirut to assist in keeping the
crossing point open.
Mitterrand garners support
Paris, I"ranee — France's Socialist leaders early this mor
ning averted an open crisis within the ruling left-wing coali
tion by winning a vote of confidence from their Communist
allies in the national assembly despite serious differences over
economic policy.
After a 10-hour debate in the assembly, Communist
deputies voted to remain in President Francois Mitterrand's
Socialist-dominated coalition that has ruled France for nearly
three years. But they also made clear that their party will con
tinue to distance itself from the government over a strategy of
economic modernization that has already led to a sharp in
crease in unemployment and factory closures.
The result of the confidence debate, which was seen by
Socialist leaders as a way of forcing the Communists to take a
clear stand for or against the government, seems unlikely to
end the strains in the coalition, in which the Communists head
four ministries. With neither party willing to back down on a
wide range of policy stands, their alliance is being held to
gether by little more than their common electoral interest in
presenting a united front to the right.
China trip to open new era
Washington — President Reagan leaves Sunday for a six
day visit to China that administration officials say will mark a
new era in U.S.-Chinese relations and could eventually send
tens of thousands of Americans to China to work in energy,
education, agriculture and other fields.
With more than seven hours of talks scheduled between
Reagan and Chinese officials, both nations are hailing the
visit as an historic event that could strengthen and expand re
lations.
At the same time, the extent of future cooperation will
depend largely upon how well the two nations resolve prob
lems of trade, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and other differ
ences. Chinese officials already have served notice that they
will press for a reduction in the arms sales.
The Chinese reportedly are pleased with plans for the trip
and are confident that they can establish enough rapport with
Reagan to ultimately persuade him to reduce the sales and
relax his support of Taiwan.
Despite administration assurances that the president is
prepared to reject such requests, the trip has unnerved
Taiwan, a country Reagan has staunchly supported for years
and which he visited twice before becoming president.
"The people of Taiwan are nervous as hell about this trip,
but we've reassured them and they don't believe the president
will make concessions on Taiwan," said an administration of
ficial who asked not to be identified.
NATO seeks arms compromise
Vienna, Austria — In a major move to end the stalemate in
the 11-year-old Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks,
the Western allies announced yesterday a modification of
their demand for agreement with the Warsaw Pact on the size
of existing forces in Central Europe before actual reductions
can be negotiated.
"Rather than asking for formal agreement on data ex
changed, we stand ready to accept figures that fall within an
acceptable range of our estimates," Canadian Ambassador
Thomas Hammond told reporters in outlining the new
proposals by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization powers.
"This represents a substantial change in the Western posi
tion. It is an effort to revitalize the negotiations and provide a
way of slicing through the data problem. It is a clear
demonstration of flexibility by the West," Hammond said.
Soviet Ambassador Valerian Mikhailov, who had been
briefed on the new proposals in advance of their formal
presentation at the 364 th plenary session of the talks in
Vienna's Hofburg Palace, immediately brushed them aside —
a response that was expected but was unlikely to be the
Soviets" last word.
Mondale emphasizes future
Cincinnati — In a major campaign speech dominated by
the futuristic themes that have been the rallying cry of his
chief Democratic presidential rival, Walter Mondale yester
day portrayed President Reagan as a threat to the future of
America.
The speech marked the beginning of a new campaign ap
proach for Mondale. Buoyed by his big win Wednesday in the
Missouri caucuses, the former vice president appeared to be
looking beyond the faltering challenge of Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart to the main event with Reagan this fall.
In the process, he blended some of Hart's most successful
themes into his standard repertoire, producing what sounded
like a bid to pull the Hart and Mondale camps together for a
concerted assault on Reagan.
"Today we have everything we need for the future except a
leader to take us there," Mondale told a crowd of students
and faculty at the University of Cincinnati, who listened in
tently and responded with polite applause.
"Instead of building our future," he added, "Mr. Reagan is
dismantling it" with actions ranging from a massive buildup in
the national debt to cutbacks in education spending for the
country's future work force.
"Worst of all," he said, "instead of fighting for arms con
trol, Mr. Reagan has fought to conduct an arms race. In the
year 2000, unless we change course, we will be living in per
petual fear — or perhaps not at ail."
"The first step in improving the year 2000," he said, "is in
removing Mr. Reagan."

Cease fire monitors take posts

Beirut. Lebanon — After hours of delay caused by sniper
fire, a team of Lebanese cease-fire observers took up posi
tions between Beirut's warring militias yesterday as President
Amin Gemayel flew to Damascus seeking Syrian help in en
ding the violence here.
The deployment of the observer force, made up of about
100 retired Lebanese army officers, was the first phase of a
plan to disengage Christian and Moslem militiamen along the
main fighting front — the so-called Green Line that divides
Beirut's Christian and Moslem sectors.
The observers were originally scheduled to move into the
area at noon after gathering at the old Beirut race track,
which is near the only crossing point between Christian East
and mostly Moslem West Beirut that remains open. But
sniper fire along the line delayed the operation and it was not
until early afternoon that the observers began occupying the
posts from which they will oversee the cease-fire.
T he next phase of the operation is scheduled to begin
today, when an estimated 1800 army recruits are to fan out
along the Green Line, as well as in the nearby mountains, to
act as a buffer between the Christian and Moslem militias. As
the observers gathered at the race track, they were issued
white helmets similar to the ones worn by the 40 French sol
diers who have been sent to Beirut to assist in keeping the
crossing point open.
Mitterrand garners support
Paris, I"ranee — France's Socialist leaders early this mor
ning averted an open crisis within the ruling left-wing coali
tion by winning a vote of confidence from their Communist
allies in the national assembly despite serious differences over
economic policy.
After a 10-hour debate in the assembly, Communist
deputies voted to remain in President Francois Mitterrand's
Socialist-dominated coalition that has ruled France for nearly
three years. But they also made clear that their party will con
tinue to distance itself from the government over a strategy of
economic modernization that has already led to a sharp in
crease in unemployment and factory closures.
The result of the confidence debate, which was seen by
Socialist leaders as a way of forcing the Communists to take a
clear stand for or against the government, seems unlikely to
end the strains in the coalition, in which the Communists head
four ministries. With neither party willing to back down on a
wide range of policy stands, their alliance is being held to
gether by little more than their common electoral interest in
presenting a united front to the right.
China trip to open new era
Washington — President Reagan leaves Sunday for a six
day visit to China that administration officials say will mark a
new era in U.S.-Chinese relations and could eventually send
tens of thousands of Americans to China to work in energy,
education, agriculture and other fields.
With more than seven hours of talks scheduled between
Reagan and Chinese officials, both nations are hailing the
visit as an historic event that could strengthen and expand re
lations.
At the same time, the extent of future cooperation will
depend largely upon how well the two nations resolve prob
lems of trade, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and other differ
ences. Chinese officials already have served notice that they
will press for a reduction in the arms sales.
The Chinese reportedly are pleased with plans for the trip
and are confident that they can establish enough rapport with
Reagan to ultimately persuade him to reduce the sales and
relax his support of Taiwan.
Despite administration assurances that the president is
prepared to reject such requests, the trip has unnerved
Taiwan, a country Reagan has staunchly supported for years
and which he visited twice before becoming president.
"The people of Taiwan are nervous as hell about this trip,
but we've reassured them and they don't believe the president
will make concessions on Taiwan," said an administration of
ficial who asked not to be identified.
NATO seeks arms compromise
Vienna, Austria — In a major move to end the stalemate in
the 11-year-old Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks,
the Western allies announced yesterday a modification of
their demand for agreement with the Warsaw Pact on the size
of existing forces in Central Europe before actual reductions
can be negotiated.
"Rather than asking for formal agreement on data ex
changed, we stand ready to accept figures that fall within an
acceptable range of our estimates," Canadian Ambassador
Thomas Hammond told reporters in outlining the new
proposals by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization powers.
"This represents a substantial change in the Western posi
tion. It is an effort to revitalize the negotiations and provide a
way of slicing through the data problem. It is a clear
demonstration of flexibility by the West," Hammond said.
Soviet Ambassador Valerian Mikhailov, who had been
briefed on the new proposals in advance of their formal
presentation at the 364 th plenary session of the talks in
Vienna's Hofburg Palace, immediately brushed them aside —
a response that was expected but was unlikely to be the
Soviets" last word.
Mondale emphasizes future
Cincinnati — In a major campaign speech dominated by
the futuristic themes that have been the rallying cry of his
chief Democratic presidential rival, Walter Mondale yester
day portrayed President Reagan as a threat to the future of
America.
The speech marked the beginning of a new campaign ap
proach for Mondale. Buoyed by his big win Wednesday in the
Missouri caucuses, the former vice president appeared to be
looking beyond the faltering challenge of Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart to the main event with Reagan this fall.
In the process, he blended some of Hart's most successful
themes into his standard repertoire, producing what sounded
like a bid to pull the Hart and Mondale camps together for a
concerted assault on Reagan.
"Today we have everything we need for the future except a
leader to take us there," Mondale told a crowd of students
and faculty at the University of Cincinnati, who listened in
tently and responded with polite applause.
"Instead of building our future," he added, "Mr. Reagan is
dismantling it" with actions ranging from a massive buildup in
the national debt to cutbacks in education spending for the
country's future work force.
"Worst of all," he said, "instead of fighting for arms con
trol, Mr. Reagan has fought to conduct an arms race. In the
year 2000, unless we change course, we will be living in per
petual fear — or perhaps not at ail."
"The first step in improving the year 2000," he said, "is in
