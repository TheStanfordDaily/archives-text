Prom the Los Angeles Times
Washington — The White
House is searching for new ap
proaches to build public and
congressional support tor Presi
dent Reagan's policies in
Central America after setbacks
over the ClA's role in covert
warfare against the leftist gov
ernment of Nicaragua, senior
administration officials said yes
terday.
Several presidential assistants
and Republican political
strategists said Reagan should
attempt to shift the debate away
from covert CIA activities and
focus it instead on the larger
goal of stopping the spread of
communism in the region.
"It's all how the debate is
framed, and if we get

sidetracked on the CIA and the
World Court, it's a loser," said a
White House official. "We've
got to come back to first prin
ciples."
This reassessment follows
overwhelming votes by the
House and Senate in support of
a non-binding resolution con
demning the CIA-backed min
ing of Nicaragua's harbors, the
strongest congressional repudia
tion of a Reagan foreign policy
to date. With its request for mil
itary aid to El Salvador stalled,
the White House then bypassed
Congress and invoked emer
gency authority to send the aid.
The administration officials
stressed that Reagan is deeply
committed to the current course
of his Central American policy.

Regardless of the political risks,
they said. Reagan is not likely to
pull back from the region, as he
did under pressure in Lebanon.
They said Reagan is deter
mined to prevent Soviet- and
Cuban-backed forces from top
pling any democratic govern
ment in the region "on our
watch," as one of them put it.
But some administration offi
cials are privately worried about
the political fallout of the recent
disclosures that the CIA played
a direct role in the war being
fought by rebels against the left
ist regime in Nicaragua, includ
ing the mining of harbors and
the CIA-directed attack on a
Nicaraguan oil storage facility.
These officials said they
believe that political support for

Reagan's larger goals in Central
America could be undermined it
the focus becomes CIA activi
ties rather than what Reagan
has called the "faraway,
totalitarian power" that is
"committing enormous re
sources to change the strategic
balance of the world by turning
Central America into a string ot
anti-American. Soviet-style dic
tatorships."
"We can sell Central America
if it's not a clandestine CIA
thing." one official said. "The
CIA has a connotation, some
thing we shouldn't be doing, and it
brings up Chile and the Bay ot
Pigs."
As a result, the officials said
they wanted to change the focus
of the debate away from the

CIA and its covert activities,
even though they believe such a
shift will not affect the actual
CIA role in Central America or
the basic policy the administra
tion is pursuing.
Several officials noted that
CIA Director William Casey
has close tics to Reagan per
sonally and that he has used
them to win approval for CIA
activities in the region. They
also noted that chief of staff
James Baker, who is often the
White House adviser most
sensitive to potential political
problems for Reagan, has been
a staunch backer of the adminis
tration effort in Central
America, and would be unlikely
to urge Reagan to change
course now.
