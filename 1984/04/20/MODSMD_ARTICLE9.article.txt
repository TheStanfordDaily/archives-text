# GNP surges; inflation, interest should rise

From the Los Angeles Times
Washington â€” The U.S. economy
grew at a stunningly rapid 8.3 percent
annual rate in the first three months of
this year even after adjustment for infla
tion, the Department of Commerce re
ported yesterday.
The news immediately fueled fears
that the economy is growing too fast for
its own good. Some private economic
forecasters said it confirmed their predic
tions that interest rates and inflation will
rise through the rest of the year.
Reagan administration officials,
worried about the political impact of
such trends while President Reagan is
seeking re-election, sought to play down
the dangers.

"There isn't any overheating," Martin
Feldstein, chairman of Reagan's Council
of Economic advisers, said. Feldstein
noted that a large accumulation of busi
ness inventories, rather than a burst of
potentially inflationary demand for
goods and services, accounted for most
of the economic growth during the first
quarter.
Such robust growth in the gross na
tional product (the measure of the na
tion's output of goods and services) is
unusual for the second year of an eco
nomic recovery. The spurt reversed a
gradual decline that had set in after a 9.7
percent burst of growth in the second
quarter of last year.
The 8.3 percent growth exceeded the

Department of Commerce's 7.2 percent
"flash" estimate issued last month,
before the quarter had ended. Most
analysts expected the new estimate,
which is still preliminary, to be lower,
reflecting signs that the economy began
cooling off in March.
Instead, economic growth turned up
even more from the 5 percent annual
rate of the previous quarter because
business inventories built up twice as fast
as in the last three months of 1983. Sales
of goods and services grew only 3.6 per
cent on an annual basis in the first three
months of this year, down slightly from
the previous quarter.
The new Department of Commerce
figures showed inflation continuing to

edge up. On an annual basis, the price of
the nation's goods and services rose by
4.7 percent in the first quarter, up from
4.2 percent in the last three months of
1983 and 4.3 percent for 1983 as a
whole.
Feldstein contended there was "less
than meets the eye" to the burst of eco
nomic growth in the first quarter.
"I could imagine people misun
derstanding these figures," lie told
reporters. In fact, he said, the inventory
buildup is over, growth in sales is running
near the administration's projections and
inflation is somewhat lower than the ad
ministration has projected.
