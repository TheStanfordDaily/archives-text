# Possible AIDS virus discovered
## Experts question announcement 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
Government scientists announced
yesterday the discovery of a virus that
may cause acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but
Stanford experts caution that the fin
dings rest on assocations that have not
been rigorously proven.
Margaret Heckler, secretary of
Health and Human Services, told a
news conference in Washington, D.C.,
that the identification of a virus called
HTLV-111 as the probable cause of
AIDS will enable blood centers to
diagnose AIDS victims and to prevent
the spread of AIDS by blood transfu
sion.
"We now have a blood test for
AIDS which we hope can be widely
available within about six months,"
Heckler told the Associated Press.
"With the blood test, we can identify
AIDs victims with essentially 100 per
cent certainty."
Prominent medical doctors from the
Stanford community, however, ques
tion whether the recent findings will
insure that blood for transfusion is
free from AIDS because the cause of

the disease has yet to he determined
According to Asst. Prof. F.dg; t
Engleman, director of the Stanfoi i
Medical School Blood Center, tlu
prediction that AIDS may be detectc I
in donated blood with a 100 percent
certainty is overly optimistic. He said
the Blood Center is using some indi
rect tests right now to attempt to dis
tinguish contaminated blood, a proce
dure that other centers in the B v
Area have only recently begun to fol
low.

discoveries are usually announced .it
conferences and are accompanied by.
the relevant data. He said a govern
ment official issuing a public state
ment without the backup data "is not
the usual way that scientific informa
tion is disseminated."
Engleman characterized AIDS as a
political "hot potato." He Said the un-;
usual politics that surround AIDS has'
caused the government to adopt an of
fensive posture in an effort to show
that it has not backed away from the
controversial associations that sur
round AIDS. The political sensitivity
of the issue may have caused the De
partment of Health and Human
Services to make a premature an
nouncement. he said.
Since AIDS frequently afflicts
homosexuals, people in the past have
charged the government has not made
a thorough study to combat AIDS.
Now, however, Engleman said,
"everyone wants the credit."
Engleman said the assertion that
HTLV-111 is the cause of AIDS rests
on some unproven associations. He
said the work of Dr. Robert Gallo. the
National Cancer Institute researcher
who isolated HTLV-111. utilizes
"leaps of logic."
Gallo maintains that the presence of
antibodies against the virus 111 L V-111
in a victim's system supports the hy
pothesis that HTLV-111 is the
probable cause of AIDS. He also
points to the the isolation of HTLV
III virus in about 50 AIDS victims and

carriers.
But Lnglemen said the presence ol
HIT \ antibodies mereh proves that
the victim has been exposed to the
virus. 'They have little evidence
beyond a strong association to con
vince us that the virus is the cause of
the disease." he said.
I nglemen stressed the difficulty in
downplaving the recent findings be
cause Gallo heads a distinguished
team of researchers and because none
of the data have been published.
Medical School Prof. Gary School
nik agrees that Gallo's research leaves
room for questioning because the
scientist has not utilized the traditional
methods of proof, lie said the virus
HTI V-111 as a cause ol A IDs has not
passed Koch s Postulates.
According to Koch's Postulates, the
isolated virus must be cultivated in the
laboratory. The infectious agent must
then be administered to another host,
such as a monkey, and must cause
AIDS in the host. Gallo and his col
leagues have injected the virus into
test animals, but not enough time has
passed for the disease to develop.
