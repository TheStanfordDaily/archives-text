may cause acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but
Stanford experts caution that the fin

Health and Human Services, told a
news conference in Washington, D.C.,
that the identification of a virus called
HTLV-111 as the probable cause of
AIDS will enable blood centers to
diagnose AIDS victims and to prevent

"We now have a blood test for
AIDS which we hope can be widely
available within about six months,"
Heckler told the Associated Press.
"With the blood test, we can identify
AIDs victims with essentially 100 per

Prominent medical doctors from the
Stanford community, however, ques

insure that blood for transfusion is
free from AIDS because the cause of
