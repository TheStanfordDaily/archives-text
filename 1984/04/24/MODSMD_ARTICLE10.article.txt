From the Los Angeles Times
Ansel Adams, whose camera cele
brated nature's wonders and whose life
was dedicated to perpetuating the purity
of her creations, is dead at 82, it was
learned yesterday.
He died late Sunday night in Commu
nity Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula,
near Big Sur on the California Coast,
where he had lived, photographed and
battled for his beloved environment.

Adams had undergone heart surgery
in 1979 and was admitted to the hospital
Friday with the recurring heart problem.
Adams and Edward Weston were the
two names most often mentioned when
historians tried to decide when photogra
phy had moved from the realm ot hob
byists and was accorded a niche in the
world's art salons and museums.
And it was Adams, the gruffly pleas

ant, bear of a man, who generally is
credited with taking Weston's visions ol
unsullied clarity and moving them from
the curious to the commercial, providing
throughout his lengthy and prolific
career thousands of negatives and prints
from the photographic assignments that
he said came "from within."
At his death, more than one million
books of his photographs rested on cof

fee tables and in libraries throughout the
world.
A single Adams photograph once
commanded $70,000 and, more impor
tant to Adams the man, 5000 students
had trudged to his studio and then on
with him to view the scenic glories of the
United States, watching as the gradually
aging master set up his tripod to capture
what he said were the "images and not
just records" of their world.
