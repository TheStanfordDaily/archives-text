On the road to China
As President Reagan began his trek
to China this weekend, he left behind
the political turmoil caused by the
ClA's increasingly overt role in the
covert Central American war.
Reagan told a crowd in Honolulu
Sunday he was beginning a "long jour
ney for peace" to China. At the same
time, military experts and members of
Congress said the Pentagon is now
ready to begin an actual combat role
in Central America, should the presi
dent give the order.
Both Reagan and Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger have said
repeatedly that they have no plans to
send American troops to fight in El
Salvador or Nicaragua, but the guer
rilla forces in Fl Salvador have in
creased their strength and, some ex
perts believe, the temptation for a
more active U.S. military role.
On Friday, the U.S. Navy began
Ocean Venture I, its most extensive
Caribbean exercise this year. Led by
the aircraft carrier America, the exer
cise will eventually put 350 ships and
30,000 U.S. servicemen in the seas
near Central America.
Meanwhile, a U.S. Army helicopter
carrying two senators was forced down
by Salvadoran rebel fire after it al
legedly flew a reconnaissance mission
over guerrilla-held territory.
Administration critics have become
more outspoken in their fears that the
United States will be drawn, perhaps
unintentionally, into an actual combat
role.
"The more people you have on the
spot, the more chance you have of
casualties and the more chance you
have of confrontation with Sandinista
troops and their Cuban advisers or the
Salvadoran guerrillas," Sen. Jeff Bin
gaman, a democrat from New Mexico,
told The New York Times.
However, administration officials
have remained adamant that they
have no plans for increased U.S. mili

tary intervention.
The president vowed in May not to
"Americanize" the war in Central
America, and Weinberger said
recently that there was "no plan, no
strategy, no thought of putting U.S.
combat troops" into Central America.
Critics have also begun to speak out
against the growing role the CIA is
playing in shaping the administration's
policy in Central America.
Support has been given these critics
by recent disclosures that the CIA di
rected the mining of Nicaraguan har
bors and, more recently, supervised
and supplied rebel units of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force operat
ing from Honduras.
Congress has reacted strongly to
these latest revelations. New York
Sen. Patrick Moynihan announced he
will resign as vice chairman of the Sen
ate Select Committee on Intelligence
in protest over what he calls the failure
of the CIA to inform his committee
fully of actions in Central America.
Such disclosure is required of the CIA
by law.
Congress has also blocked $N mil
lion for an airfield the administration
wishes to build in Honduras until the
administration spells out more clearly
its long-term plans for Central
America.
Picking up Pulitzers
Four American newspapers won
two Pulitzer prizes each last week.
The New York Times, the Los An
geles Times, The Boston Globe and
the Wall Street Journal shared top
honors in the annual competition for
the Pulitzers.
Theodor Suess Geisl, better known
as Dr. Seuss, received a special cita
tion for his contribution to the
"education and enjoyment" of Ameri
can children and parents over the last
50 years.
William Kennedy's novel
"Ironweed" and David Mamet's

"Glengarry Glen Ross' took the
prizes for fiction and drama,
respectively.
The Long Island newspaper
Newsday won the prize for general
local reporting for its coverage of
Baby Jane Doe and other children
whose parents refuse medical care lor
them.
The editorial writing and cartooning
prizes went to Albert Scardino of I he
Georgia Gazette and Paul Conrad of
the Los Angeles Times, respectively.
Trouble on the border
Two Czechoslovakian Air Force
planes fired on a U.S. Army helicopter
Friday while the chopper was on an
observation mission along the West
German-Czechoslovakian border.
The U.S. Cobra helicopter was not
hit by the cannon and rocket fire, the
Pentagon said, and returned safely to
its home station in West Germany.
Later, German witnesses to the at
tack said that the U.S. copter had vio
lated Chechoslovakian airspace.
The Pentagon said the aircraft
which fired on the copter were Soviet
MiG warplanes, which are used by
many Warsaw Bloc air forces.
The Cobra is a single-engine attack
helicopter that normally carries a crew
of two. Some advanced versions of the
chopper are armed with TOW anti
missile, 20-millimeter cannon and
2.75-inch rockets.
Kissinger clash in SF
A clash between demonstrators and
police outside a San Francisco hotel
last week brought back memories of
riots at the 1968 Democratic Conven
tion in Chicago and stirred fears about
protests at June's convention in San
Francisco.
Police arrested 191 protesters
outside a speech by former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger last Monday.
The demonstrators, who protested

U.S. action in Central America, claim
that San Francisco's horse-mounted
police overreacted and clubbed many
of them, including those who did not
initiate the violent exchanges.
Police commanders countered that
the demonstrators wanted a con
frontation with police in order
publicize their positions. Furthermore,
police said, they only clubbed those
protesters who had physically
threatened police officers.
Democratic organizers expressed
their fears about a violent convention
last week, but San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein, considered to be a
possible vice-presidential candidate
herself, said she sees no problems.
The Peace and Environmental

Coalition announced plans last week
for a $250,000 protest party to
coincide with the convention, and
plans are underway for a National
March for Lesbian/Gay Rights to be
concurrent with the convention.
Britain breaks with Libya
Britain announced Sunday it had
broken diplomatic relations with
Libya and ordered the occupants of
the Libyan Embassy in London to
leave the country by Sunday.
The move came after a gunman
inside the embassy shot into a crowd
of protesters outside the embassy last
week, killing a London constable and
wounding 10 demonstrators.
The Libyan government of Col.

Moammar Khadafy refused to
cooperate in the inquiry into the
shooting.
British officials said Sunday night
that embassy occupants — including
the gunman — would be guaranteed
safe passage out of the country.
The week-long police siege of the
embassy is expected to continue until
Sunday, when either the Libyans will
leave or the police will raid the build
ing. Such a move is impossible now
because the Libyans are protected by
diplomatic immunity, but as of Sunday
they will lose that status and British
police will be allowed to intervene.

Protesters clashed with police outside a Henry Kissinger speech in San Francisco last week, and despite
Mayor Dianne Feinstein's promises to the contrary, many critics predict the violent altercation could be a
grim precursor to this summer's Democratic Convention in San Francisco.

Trouble on the border
Two Czechoslovakian Air Force
planes fired on a U.S. Army helicopter
Friday while the chopper was on an
observation mission along the West
German-Czechoslovakian border.
The U.S. Cobra helicopter was not
hit by the cannon and rocket fire, the
Pentagon said, and returned safely to
its home station in West Germany.
Later, German witnesses to the at
tack said that the U.S. copter had vio
lated Chechoslovakian airspace.
The Pentagon said the aircraft
which fired on the copter were Soviet
MiG warplanes, which are used by
many Warsaw Bloc air forces.
The Cobra is a single-engine attack
helicopter that normally carries a crew
of two. Some advanced versions of the
chopper are armed with TOW anti
missile, 20-millimeter cannon and
2.75-inch rockets.
Kissinger clash in SF
A clash between demonstrators and
police outside a San Francisco hotel
last week brought back memories of
riots at the 1968 Democratic Conven
tion in Chicago and stirred fears about
protests at June's convention in San
Francisco.
Police arrested 191 protesters
outside a speech by former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger last Monday.
The demonstrators, who protested

U.S. action in Central America, claim
that San Francisco's horse-mounted
police overreacted and clubbed many
of them, including those who did not
initiate the violent exchanges.
Police commanders countered that
the demonstrators wanted a con
frontation with police in order
publicize their positions. Furthermore,
police said, they only clubbed those
protesters who had physically
threatened police officers.
Democratic organizers expressed
their fears about a violent convention
last week, but San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein, considered to be a
possible vice-presidential candidate
herself, said she sees no problems.
The Peace and Environmental

Coalition announced plans last week
for a $250,000 protest party to
coincide with the convention, and
plans are underway for a National
March for Lesbian/Gay Rights to be
concurrent with the convention.
Britain breaks with Libya
Britain announced Sunday it had
broken diplomatic relations with
Libya and ordered the occupants of
the Libyan Embassy in London to
leave the country by Sunday.
The move came after a gunman
inside the embassy shot into a crowd
of protesters outside the embassy last
week, killing a London constable and
wounding 10 demonstrators.
The Libyan government of Col.

Moammar Khadafy refused to
cooperate in the inquiry into the
shooting.
British officials said Sunday night
that embassy occupants — including
the gunman — would be guaranteed
safe passage out of the country.
The week-long police siege of the
embassy is expected to continue until
Sunday, when either the Libyans will
leave or the police will raid the build
ing. Such a move is impossible now
because the Libyans are protected by
diplomatic immunity, but as of Sunday
they will lose that status and British
police will be allowed to intervene.

On the road to China
As President Reagan began his trek
to China this weekend, he left behind
the political turmoil caused by the
ClA's increasingly overt role in the
covert Central American war.
Reagan told a crowd in Honolulu
Sunday he was beginning a "long jour
ney for peace" to China. At the same
time, military experts and members of
Congress said the Pentagon is now
ready to begin an actual combat role
in Central America, should the presi
dent give the order.
Both Reagan and Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger have said
repeatedly that they have no plans to
send American troops to fight in El
Salvador or Nicaragua, but the guer
rilla forces in Fl Salvador have in
creased their strength and, some ex
perts believe, the temptation for a
more active U.S. military role.
On Friday, the U.S. Navy began
Ocean Venture I, its most extensive
Caribbean exercise this year. Led by
the aircraft carrier America, the exer
cise will eventually put 350 ships and
30,000 U.S. servicemen in the seas
near Central America.
Meanwhile, a U.S. Army helicopter
carrying two senators was forced down
by Salvadoran rebel fire after it al
legedly flew a reconnaissance mission
over guerrilla-held territory.
Administration critics have become
more outspoken in their fears that the
United States will be drawn, perhaps
unintentionally, into an actual combat
role.
"The more people you have on the
spot, the more chance you have of
casualties and the more chance you
have of confrontation with Sandinista
troops and their Cuban advisers or the
Salvadoran guerrillas," Sen. Jeff Bin
gaman, a democrat from New Mexico,
told The New York Times.
However, administration officials
have remained adamant that they
have no plans for increased U.S. mili

tary intervention.
The president vowed in May not to
"Americanize" the war in Central
America, and Weinberger said
recently that there was "no plan, no
strategy, no thought of putting U.S.
combat troops" into Central America.
Critics have also begun to speak out
against the growing role the CIA is
playing in shaping the administration's
policy in Central America.
Support has been given these critics
by recent disclosures that the CIA di
rected the mining of Nicaraguan har
bors and, more recently, supervised
and supplied rebel units of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force operat
ing from Honduras.
Congress has reacted strongly to
these latest revelations. New York
Sen. Patrick Moynihan announced he
will resign as vice chairman of the Sen
ate Select Committee on Intelligence
in protest over what he calls the failure
of the CIA to inform his committee
fully of actions in Central America.
Such disclosure is required of the CIA
by law.
Congress has also blocked $N mil
lion for an airfield the administration
wishes to build in Honduras until the
administration spells out more clearly
its long-term plans for Central
America.
Picking up Pulitzers
Four American newspapers won
two Pulitzer prizes each last week.
