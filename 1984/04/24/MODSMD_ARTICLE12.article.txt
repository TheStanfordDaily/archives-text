## The 						Stanford Daily Greek discrimination 
### 
In the traditional confusion surrounding the
spring housing draw, one statement from Resi
dential Education's Draw Book'is clear enough:
No student may be refused a special priority be
cause of a subjective judgment made by one or
more individuals.
In other words, each and every student should
share the same right to live in any on-campus
residence.
The policy applies to all forms of campus
housing: dormitories, co-ops, suites, independent
and ethnic theme houses, trailers and apartments.
All forms of campus housing except one: frater
nities.
A fraternity house is the one place on campus
in which the current residents are allowed to
choose those students who may join their ranks
next year. Stating the obvious? Perhaps. But the
obvious isn't necessarily good.
Think about it. Say two people both want to
live in a certain dormitory next year. Both enter
the draw, choose draw numbers and then are as
signed to a campus residence based strictly and
equally on those numbers. While both may not
get the dormitory they want, both at least have an
equal shot going in.
But let's say instead that these two individuals
want to live in a certain fraternity next year. Both
can go to the rush parties, tell the current mem
bers of the fraternity how much they'd like to join
them, and then wait for them to decide who will
be accepted into the group.
Maybe the fraternity members choose both. But
maybe they choose just one. Or maybe neither. In
any case, somebody else has decided if these two
students will be able to live where they want to
live. That's called discrimination. And that's not
fair.

We all know that life's not fair and that there's
discrimination out there in the "real world." But
a university is supposed to be the ideal world of
enlightenment, and, in that ideal world, life
should be fair.
To reach that end, all Stanford fraternities
should follow the lead of Alpha Sigma, which
decided to become part of the housing draw a few
years ago, forcing it to sever all ties with its na
tional organization. If two people both want to
live at Alpha Sigma next year, they have an equal
chance in this week's housing draw. That's the
way it should be everywhere.
While such a move means other Stanford
fraternities may have to sever ties with their na
tional organizations, the obvious attraction of a
non-discriminatory system is greater than that of
national affiliation.
But without self-selectivity, fraternities
couldn't exist and we'd all be poorer for having
lost them as an all-male housing option, right?
Wrong.
If students maintain an interest in living in
fraternities, fraternities will continue to exist;
they will be filled with residents who draw and list
fraternities as their top choices. Just as certain
draw-chosen theme houses on campus are filled
year after year by students with an interest in
American Studies or Italian or social change
through non-violence, draw-chosen fraternities
would be filled year after year by students with an
interest in a fraternity environment.
But unlike the present system, a draw-chosen
fraternity system would mean all students would
have an equal chance to share in the option
fraternities provide. It would be an ideal situation
in an ideal world, and, at a supposedly en
lightened institution such as this one. that isn't too
much to ask.
