## The 						Escondido rent squeeze

We would like to add our voice to
those who deplore Stanford Univer
sity's avowed intent to bring the Es
condido Village rents to near market

VIEWPOINT

value. As newlywed Harvard under
graduates four years ago, we were
caught in the same cycle of annual rent
increases as Harvard brought its
housing to "market value." The first
year we swallowed hard, took part
time jobs in addition to heavy aca
demic workloads and an unexpected
pregnancy, and paid. The second year,
facing a 22 percent rent increase, we
were forced to move 30 minutes from
campus to an apartment featuring rats,
holes in the kitchen floor, two crum

bling walls and inadequate electricity
and plumbing.
Our time at Stanford, on the other
hand, has been golden. Certainly Es
condido Village housing has played a
major part in our happiness here. Our
apartment is sunny, safe and designed
for children. Perhaps more important,
though, is the commitment we've
found here not only to intellectual ex
cellence, but to excellence in the home
as well.
Families are fragile things. The
pressure of achieving the aforemen
tioned academic excellence in the face
of poverty, young children (who, con
trary to popular wisdom, do not al
ways arrive according to schedule) and
prohibitively expensive childcare are
severe indeed. Add to this an adminis

tration that has indicated its reluc
tance to provide support for those who
have foolishly "chosen" to have "large
families" of two children while still in
graduate school, and we will shortly be
left with a fine teaching and research
institution without any sensitivity to or
allowance for personal relationships
and the continuity of the family.
We acknowledge the rare opportu
nity that is ours to live and study here,
and we are willing to make what
sacrifices we can. We live well below
the allotted budget for students with
spouses and two children, and we will
leave in June after two years, $25,000
in debt. There's not much more we
can do.
