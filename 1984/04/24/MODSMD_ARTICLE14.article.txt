## Contingency funding fairness 
### 
There are dozens of groups that receive funding from
students through the ASSU in amounts ranging from $50
to $50,000. Some of these groups are large, enjoy cam
puswide support and fight special fee elections to have

their enormous budgets approved by the entire student
body. Other groups are small, provide programming that
benefits only certain sections of the student body and
operate on budgets whose size is small enough that the
cost and effort of an election is not justified. Besides, each
group would probably not obtain the support of a majority
of the students due to its small size and specific program
ming. However, the activities of these groups help foster
the diverse cultural environment on campus. Students pay
for these groups through a lump sum association fee.
In a dynamic world, some small groups grow and fight

special fee elections; some large groups dissipate and
become small groups that cannot win an election. Contin
gent funding is a mechanism that, among other things,
exists in this transition.
Contingent funding is given to groups that do not
receive widespread student support on a competitive basis
with other small groups. Their budgets are scrutinized and
only attractive activities will be funded. The senate is not
some monstrous power-hungry beast trying to thwart the
will of the student body. It is just a body of people trying to
do its job as best it can. The appropriate question to ask is
not "Why contingent funding?" The appropriate question
is what the threshold for that funding should be. If you feel
that $5000 is too high, tell your senator that you want it
lowered â€” the senate will respond.
