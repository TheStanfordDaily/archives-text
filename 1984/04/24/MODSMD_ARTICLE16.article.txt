# An uncertain future

No description of Cairo city buses is more apt than
in'sha'allah. Variously translated from the Arabic as "if
Allah wills it"and "manana (or the next day),"
in'sha'allah tells the whole madcap story of running to
catch the bus wherever it slows or stops, clinging either to
the outer railing or to the passenger who boarded immedi
ately before and taking care not to be pushed to the
middle of the bus lest it become impossible to disembark
before the end of the route.
Watching people board the bus in such a manner is mar
ginally entertaining, and describing Cairo traffic is a ter
rific way to bring the teeming city to life for the folks back
home. It probably is not as pleasant to be one of the 150 or
so people jammed onto a bus adequate for about 60, and
the spectacle becomes deadly serious when it is seen as a
metaphor for the city whose daytime population ap
proaches 20 million.
Egyptians have reason to be proud of their country's
achievements, both ancient and modern, and to be opti
mistic about its future. But if the country does not take
drastic — and prompt — action to limit its population, the
economic and social gains made since independence will
disintegrate under a demographic load it simply cannot
support.
Egypt is clearly not the only country facing acute prob
lems of overpopulation: Most nations are similarly af
flicted. Both peril and potential are high there, though. A
growth rate of 2.5 percent is swelling a population of
roughly 40 million who are already vying to make a living
on six million acres of arable land. On the other hand, a
fairly solid industrial base, a large export market for cot
ton and the fact that the tillable land is tremendously
fertile means that Egypt should in theory be able to well
support its present population.
In the meantime, overpopulation (18S1 people per
square mile in the Nile valley and delta) relative to
available resources poses obstacles to economic develop
ment particularly in the areas of sanitation, housing and
education.
There is an Egyptian saying to the effect that "whoever
drinks from the Nile will someday return to Egypt" which
could easily be amended to. "whoever drinks from the
Nile will never leave Egypt." Somehow Egyptians cope
with the poor water quality, but each drop is at a premium
— no great surprise when 96 percent of the country is des
ert.
The Aswan High Dam was supposed to alleviate the
problem: It was designed to generate huge amounts of
cheap energy and open up large tracts of irrigated, and
thus tillable, land. Considering the scope of the havoc
which the dam has wreaked, 1 walked away from the
monument to "eternal Soviet-Egyptian friendship" quite
glad that President Eisenhower curtailed our own involve
ment with that particular project. Now. however, we need
to help devise some workable solutions for the problems
the Aswan Dam failed to solve.
Inadequate sewage facilities is a related key issue. In
December 1982, a main line of the Cairo municipal sewer
system burst. Hooding sections of the city for days. The
system, built in 1914 for a population of one million, is in
desperate need of modernization, to put it mildly.

Meilhut, mv Egyptian guide, avoided mentioning the in
cident. though our group from Stanford was there while
clean-up operations were underway. He also appeared
most uncomfortable when we passed neighborhoods of
squalid housing, and became unnecessarily defensive when
he tried to pass off the sight of people living in cemeteries
as relatives ot the deceased making short visits. There arc
plenty ot Cairenes (and American citizens) who lack even
that shelter.
Dispiriting as those problems may be, they are not
nearly the Gordian knot that the educational paradox
represents. Illiteracy, while steadily declining since Gamal
Abdel Nasser took power in 1952, hampers a majority of
the population. Primary facilities are egregiously over
crowded and urban schools run double shifts.

On the other hand, many college graduates stagnate for
lack of professional opportunities, hut since the govern
ment has guaranteed them jobs, they join the already
swollen bureaucracy.
Obviously such anecdotal evidence cannot provide a
comprehensive overview of the national dilemma.
Anyway, the story is far from hopeless: The national staple
food, fid (lava beans), is protein-rich; tourism brings in
much welcome foreign exchange; Egypt's young men have
more of a chance to develop their country rather than
supply cannon fodder than most of their counterparts in
the Middle East.
Unfortunately, that is not enough. Before it can even
think about supporting 60 million people (World Bank
projection for the year 2000), Egypt must boost its per
capita gross national product above $250. Trying to do
that, it will run into a vicious circle. Modernization in
cludes a shift to capital-intensive, rather than labor
intensive, enterprises, but the government must find a way
to keep the people occupied.
Population control is unarguably essential. Nasser ac
knowledged it in I 962 when he decreed family planning to
be an official government policy; Sadat confirmed it a de
cade later in his "Program of National Development."
Regrettably, bureaucracy and the powerful sway of reli
gious and agrarian culture have prevented strong results.
Stronger state participation, up to and including tempo
rary coercive measures, arc in order. Alternative scenarios
— mass starvation, civil strife, increased mortality rates —
are even less desirable.
