## Increasing voter turnout 
### 
Hail to see why the ASSU election
officials find the heavy voter turnout
in the ASSU elections so surprising
(Daily. April 18.)
An "incentive to vote" electoral
system is not very far removed from a
compulsory electoral system, and
\oter turnout is traditionally very
high in systems of the latter type. For
example, voter turnout has been
extremely high in the last two elec
tions in El Salvador, where non
voters are subject to punishment for
"subversion." Under these condi
tions, a high voter turnout is hardly
surprising.
The ASSU elections differ only in
degree: non-voters are deprived only
ot the right to withdraw their finan
cial support from those campus or
ganizations from which they derive no
benefit.
1 am quite certain that voter turn
out in state and national elections
would increase dramatically if eligible
voters were required to furnish proof
of having voted in order to receive
income tax refunds.
I am equally certain that such a
practice would be declared uncon
stitutional
