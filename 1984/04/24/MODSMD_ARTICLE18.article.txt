## Now here's the real John Paye 
### 
Yes, John Paye does have street clothes! John shares a
dorm with 101 freshmen, tour resident assistants and two
resident fellows. We all have seen him in jeans and a short
sleeve pullover shirt. We've seen him in various apparel
purchased at such strange places as Macys, Bullocks and
the Emporium. Jason Cole never talked to John about the
column "Does the life of a student athlete really Paye

off?" (Daily, April 10). 1 have spoken to John and have a
few things to say.
In our dorm, in addition to John, we have four-and-a
half other full scholarship athletes including Olympic
swimmer Pablo Morales. In total we have 15 varsity ath
letes participating in football, baseball, men's volleyball,
women's tennis, Softball, basketball, hockey, men's and
women's crew, sailing, men's and women's soccer and
swimming.
All our athletes participate because they want to. John
plays basketball during winter quarter not because he has
to, but because he wants to.
True. Stanford offers hundreds of widely diverse oppor
tunities. But John chose the opportunity he was most in
terested in — basketball John was not recruited for bas
ketball; in fact. John didn't even know that he would make
it off the "grey squad." Furthermore, according to the ath
letes in our dorm, the maximum amount of time per day
(during the height of the season) that any sport consumes
(baseball and football being the most time consuming) is
five-and-a-half hours — five-and-a-half hours from the
time they leave the dorm until the time they return.
For the organized scholar-athlete (and most by necessity
are) there is still plenty of time to be involved in other
"opportunities." Tennis scholarship player Stephanie
Savides feels that "athletes usually tend to make much

better use of their time. When motivated they can do as
much or more than people who have so much time that
they waste it." Another of our athletes feels that the time
spent in practice isn't really different from the pre-med
who spends all his extra time in the library.
Our athletes know that they're here as Stanford students
first, Stanford Cardinal second. Prohibiting athletes from
playing during their freshman year would serve little pur
pose at Stanford or comparable institutions. The transition
from high school to college is no great step for the athlete
who is both smart enough to get into Stanford and physi
cally talented to get an athletic scholarship. John spent

about seven hours a day studying and three hours a day at
practice during high school, about the same as he does
here on the Farm.
The hours that our five-and-a-half scholarship athletes
and 10 other varsity athletes spend in practice and compe
tition are hours well spent.
Who's to say that John's playing basketball is any worse
an exercise of opportunity than it would be if he did volun
teer work at SI.AC or was a member of the Stanford
Flying Club? John Paye, Pablo Morales, Stephanie Savides
and all our other athletes play sports because they want to.
They are taking advantage of what they see as the best op
portunities available to them.
Who's to tell them that something else is a better
choice?
