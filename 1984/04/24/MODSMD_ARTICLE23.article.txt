# Faculty commentary: Michael Boskin
## Dancing around the federal budget mess 
### 
Michael Boskin, professor of
economics and chairman of the
Center for Economic Policy Re
search, belongs to a small hut
growing fraternity of what l ime
ami Newsweek call the "New
Economists." They are clustered
about Cambridge, Chicago and
Stanford, and hold diverse views
hut share a common theme
which is as lime pat it: The
rising rebel cry for less govern
ment, more incentive and invest
ment. Boskin specializes in the
role of government in the eco
nomy, especially taxation, gov
ernment expenditures and social
security.
As the recovery continues, em
ployment rises and inflation
holds steady at a modest level,
many politicians and economists
express alarm over our budget
dilemma. Various pundits argue
that 1) the deficits are helping
the recovery; 2) the deficits will
reignite inflation; 3) the deficits
will shift the composition of out
put by crowding out investment
and net exports; 4) deficit
phobia will eventually help con
trol the growth of spending;
and/or 5) deficits don't matter.
Disagreement even extends to
open disputes within the
Reagan administration between
Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan and Martin Feldstein,
chairman of the council of eco
nomic advisers.
Meanwhile, no less than eight
deficit reduction bills and
resolutions have been intro
duced in Congress. The relevant
committees of both houses of
Congress have passed tax in
creases estimated to raise $48
billion during the next several
years as part of a $150 billion
overall deficit reduction pack
age. Of course, this amount of
revenue will not be raised. We

are a far distance away from the
$100 billion spending curb nec
essary to complete a "down
payment" package.
Where does all this economic
argument and political
maneuvering leave us? First,
some rough numbers. Most es
timates place the deficit as a
fraction of gross national prod
uct (GNP) at 5 percent or more
for the remainder of the decade.
This amounts to most of domes
tic private saving. The adminis
tration is slightly more optimis
tic, but assumes steadily falling
interest rates in its forecast. If
interest rates remain at current
levels, the administration's fiscal
year 1989 forecast w ill be more
than $100 billion too low, and
the deficit will exceed $300 bil
lion. Deficits of between $200
and $300 billion per year for
several years will double the na
tional debt, and correspond
ingly. interest payments neces
sary to service it.
Before turning to the likely
effects of such deficits, the first
thing that we must all admit is
that the prospects of such
deficits at a time when the eco
nomy is supposed to be at
relatively full employment in
peacetime is simply unprece
dented. Thus, any forecast of
the effects of these deficits
should be viewed as subject to
substantial uncertainty.
Why is spending running at
more than 24 percent of GNP,
while tax receipts are running
about 19 percent? Simply put,
spending has gone up, not
down, as a percentage of GNP
under President Reagan. Most
people naively put the entire
blame for this increase on the
defense buildup.
The really big increases have
in fact been in the interest on

the national debt (1.8 percent
above what had been predicted
and about 1 percent above what
it was in 1981) and in middle
class entitlement payments
which are not related to need.
The most important of these en
titlement programs is Social Se
curity, only some of whose
benefits accrue to low income
elderly individuals. The big cuts
have been in grants-in-aid to
state and local governments and
in those transfer payments with
specific eligibility standards. But
these cuts have been more than
swamped by the increases men
tioned above. Of course, we
have had a substantial tax cut,
made larger in real terms than
had been predicted because of
the rapid decline in inflation.
Should we be concerned? My
evaluation of the evidence is
that deficits sometimes do mat
ter for various economic
outcomes. When the economy is
at substantially less than full
employment, a tax cut can
produce some stimulus in ag
gregate demand. However, it is
important to realize that this
stimulus is much less than tradi
tional textbook Keynesian
models predict. This fact
severely limits the possibility of
substantial fiscal stimulus.
Next, it is simple aYithmetic
that at full employment, con
tinuing substantial deficits even
tually would lead to monetiza
tion by the Federal Reserve and
inflation.
While the empirical evidence
is hardly overwhelming, it is
very likely that these deficits
contribute to high interest rates
both directly and through un
certainty regarding how they
will be resolved and their likely
economic effects. With deficits
of this order of magnitude, it is

Hopes for spending and tax reforms

not surprising that crowding out
of business investment occurs.
Thus, deficits do matter
sometimes, and that difference
can be important. At the very
least, running deficits for the
foreseeable future at 5 percent

of GNP is likely to make it very
difficult for interest rates to fall
substantially and for the dollar
to return to purchasing power
parity. This is likely to lead to a
twist in the composition of out
put away from investment and

net foreign trade. Since the in
vestment rate in the I nited
States is already the lowest ot
any major industrialize
country, fiscal policies that
hinder investment are a source
of major concern.
While a tax increase in the
middle of a recession is hardly
desirable, some indication that
our political process will be ca
pable of dealing with these
massive deficits in the lutuic i s
sorely needed. I he dance
around the deficit currently
taking place in Washington is
hardly comforting. In 1985.
regardless ol who is elected
president, major changes in our
projected spending and taxes
will b economically necessary,
even it politically dilticult.
Additional deficit dilemmas
will occur beyond the 1980s. A
re-examination ol the detense
buildup and a much more
serious attempt to make Social
Security and Medicare cost
conscious and target-effecti\e.
as well as elimination ol the
myriad of programs which can
only be called welfare tin the
rich (e.g., maritime subsidies) in
our budget is desperately
needed. In fact, these reductions
in the growth of spending would
be desirable independent of any
prospective deficits.
But it is unlikely that such
spending control will by itsell be
sufficient (and there are some
potentially legitimate claims tor
increases in spending looming
on the horizon). II we raise
taxes, we should move toward a

better tax system rather th;in
just raise more revenue.
Thus. I favor unifying the cor
porate ami personal income
taxes, substantially broadening
the base while lowering the
rates less than the base is
broadened and switching the tax
base to personal consumption,
or as it is sometimes called,
consumed income. People
would be taxed on their con
sumption. rather than their
income.
I believe that such a tax not
only would be more efficient,
but that it could be made much
more equitable than our existing
tax system. I might add that
such a tax system should treat
investment in human beings
symmetrically with investment
in tangible capital.
What are the political
prospects tor such tax
reform increases as part of our
deficit dilemma? It is hard to
judge how serious those who
have introduced various partial
versions of these proposals
really are in an election year.
The only way to get such a
broad based tax reform passed
would be to have the politicians
of both parties and houses of
Congress, as well as the admin
istration. taking the blame and
heat, as well as the credit, for
the reform.
I remain cautiously optimistic
that such spending and tax
reforms will be forthcoming in
1955-S6. It not, the economic
consequences might well be se
vere.

The only way to get such a

would be to have the politicians

Michael Boskin, professor of
economics and chairman of the
Center for Economic Policy Re
search, belongs to a small hut
growing fraternity of what l ime
ami Newsweek call the "New
Economists." They are clustered
about Cambridge, Chicago and
Stanford, and hold diverse views
hut share a common theme
which is as lime pat it: The
rising rebel cry for less govern
ment, more incentive and invest
ment. Boskin specializes in the
role of government in the eco
nomy, especially taxation, gov
ernment expenditures and social
security.
As the recovery continues, em
ployment rises and inflation
holds steady at a modest level,
many politicians and economists
express alarm over our budget
dilemma. Various pundits argue
that 1) the deficits are helping
the recovery; 2) the deficits will
reignite inflation; 3) the deficits
will shift the composition of out
put by crowding out investment
and net exports; 4) deficit
phobia will eventually help con
trol the growth of spending;
and/or 5) deficits don't matter.
Disagreement even extends to
open disputes within the
Reagan administration between
Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan and Martin Feldstein,
chairman of the council of eco
nomic advisers.
Meanwhile, no less than eight
deficit reduction bills and
resolutions have been intro
duced in Congress. The relevant
committees of both houses of
Congress have passed tax in
creases estimated to raise $48
billion during the next several
years as part of a $150 billion
overall deficit reduction pack
age. Of course, this amount of
revenue will not be raised. We

are a far distance away from the
$100 billion spending curb nec
essary to complete a "down
payment" package.
Where does all this economic
argument and political
maneuvering leave us? First,
some rough numbers. Most es
timates place the deficit as a
fraction of gross national prod
uct (GNP) at 5 percent or more
for the remainder of the decade.
This amounts to most of domes
tic private saving. The adminis
tration is slightly more optimis
tic, but assumes steadily falling
interest rates in its forecast. If
interest rates remain at current
levels, the administration's fiscal
year 1989 forecast w ill be more
than $100 billion too low, and
the deficit will exceed $300 bil
lion. Deficits of between $200
and $300 billion per year for
several years will double the na
tional debt, and correspond
ingly. interest payments neces
sary to service it.
Before turning to the likely
effects of such deficits, the first
thing that we must all admit is
that the prospects of such
deficits at a time when the eco
nomy is supposed to be at
relatively full employment in
peacetime is simply unprece
dented. Thus, any forecast of
the effects of these deficits
should be viewed as subject to
substantial uncertainty.
Why is spending running at
more than 24 percent of GNP,
while tax receipts are running
about 19 percent? Simply put,
spending has gone up, not
down, as a percentage of GNP
under President Reagan. Most
people naively put the entire
blame for this increase on the
defense buildup.
The really big increases have
in fact been in the interest on

the national debt (1.8 percent
above what had been predicted
and about 1 percent above what
it was in 1981) and in middle
class entitlement payments
which are not related to need.
The most important of these en
titlement programs is Social Se
curity, only some of whose
benefits accrue to low income
elderly individuals. The big cuts
have been in grants-in-aid to
state and local governments and
in those transfer payments with
specific eligibility standards. But
these cuts have been more than
swamped by the increases men
tioned above. Of course, we
have had a substantial tax cut,
made larger in real terms than
had been predicted because of
the rapid decline in inflation.
Should we be concerned? My
evaluation of the evidence is
that deficits sometimes do mat
ter for various economic
outcomes. When the economy is
at substantially less than full
employment, a tax cut can
produce some stimulus in ag
gregate demand. However, it is
important to realize that this
stimulus is much less than tradi
tional textbook Keynesian
models predict. This fact
severely limits the possibility of
substantial fiscal stimulus.
Next, it is simple aYithmetic
that at full employment, con
tinuing substantial deficits even
tually would lead to monetiza
tion by the Federal Reserve and
inflation.
While the empirical evidence
is hardly overwhelming, it is
very likely that these deficits
contribute to high interest rates
both directly and through un
certainty regarding how they
will be resolved and their likely
economic effects. With deficits
of this order of magnitude, it is

Hopes for spending and tax reforms

not surprising that crowding out
of business investment occurs.
Thus, deficits do matter
sometimes, and that difference
can be important. At the very
least, running deficits for the
foreseeable future at 5 percent

of GNP is likely to make it very
difficult for interest rates to fall
substantially and for the dollar
to return to purchasing power
parity. This is likely to lead to a
twist in the composition of out
put away from investment and

net foreign trade. Since the in
vestment rate in the I nited
States is already the lowest ot
any major industrialize
country, fiscal policies that
hinder investment are a source
of major concern.
While a tax increase in the
middle of a recession is hardly
desirable, some indication that
our political process will be ca
pable of dealing with these
massive deficits in the lutuic i s
sorely needed. I he dance
around the deficit currently
taking place in Washington is
hardly comforting. In 1985.
regardless ol who is elected
president, major changes in our
projected spending and taxes
will b economically necessary,
even it politically dilticult.
Additional deficit dilemmas
will occur beyond the 1980s. A
re-examination ol the detense
buildup and a much more
serious attempt to make Social
Security and Medicare cost
conscious and target-effecti\e.
as well as elimination ol the
myriad of programs which can
only be called welfare tin the
rich (e.g., maritime subsidies) in
our budget is desperately
needed. In fact, these reductions
in the growth of spending would
be desirable independent of any
prospective deficits.
But it is unlikely that such
spending control will by itsell be
sufficient (and there are some
potentially legitimate claims tor
increases in spending looming
on the horizon). II we raise
taxes, we should move toward a

better tax system rather th;in
just raise more revenue.
Thus. I favor unifying the cor
porate ami personal income
taxes, substantially broadening
the base while lowering the
rates less than the base is
broadened and switching the tax
base to personal consumption,
or as it is sometimes called,
consumed income. People
would be taxed on their con
sumption. rather than their
income.
I believe that such a tax not
only would be more efficient,
but that it could be made much
more equitable than our existing
tax system. I might add that
such a tax system should treat
investment in human beings
symmetrically with investment
in tangible capital.
What are the political
prospects tor such tax
reform increases as part of our
deficit dilemma? It is hard to
judge how serious those who
