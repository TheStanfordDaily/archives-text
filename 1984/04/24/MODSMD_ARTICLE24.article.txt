# Stanford and SLAC put the squeeze on Glueball
## 
### 
Have gluebaNs®" been seen?
.. ■
Yes. They are found at the
Stanford Bookstore and
elsewhere.* The joining of
any two gluons® will always
give rise to an unambiguous
glueball®. Glueballs""' are
made up of different pairs of
gluons" 14 and are experi
mentally distinguishable only

by their color. Glueballs®
can be split by the weakest of
all Forces found in Nature,
i.e., the sub-adult force or
child force. When a
Glueball® is made to collide
head on with any hard
smooth target surface, it will
deform upon impact and
spread like a pancake, it will
then recover and with luck, it

mav split into separate
gluons™. Glueballshave
strangely long lifetimes if you
keep them clean. Glueballs®
are indeed a find of special
significance. Glueballs®
make excellent gifts for those
who have everything.
