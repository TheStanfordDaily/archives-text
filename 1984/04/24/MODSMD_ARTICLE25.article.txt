## Netmen beat battered UCLA, fault to USC 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
The weekend was full of surprises for the
Stanford men's tennis team. Unfortunately,
they weren't all in the Cardinal's favor, as it
clobbered UCLA on Friday, 7-2, but lost a
very close match to USC on Saturday, 5-4.
The Cardinal is now I 7-5 overall and 6-3 in
the Pac-10.
UCLA began the weekend on a bizzare
note when it announced Friday morning
that it would not play it's top two singles
players, Jeff Klaparda and Michael Kures.
Klaparda and Kures are ranked No. 11 and
No. 12 respectively in the national coaches
poll. The Bruins were vague in explaining
the absence of their stars, citing only
stomach problems as Klaparda's alibi.
Still, the Cardinal struggled to win the in
dividual matches. Dan Goldie, who Head
Coach Dick Gould considers to be among
the top five singles players in the country,
defeated Jimmy Pugh 7-5, 6-4. Pugh usually

plays on the No. 3 spot and is currently un
ranked.
Stanford's No. 2 player, Eric Rosenfeld,
faced UCLA's No. 5 seed, Mark Basham
and lost a close match in three sets 7-5, 3-6,
7-5. Basham was up 5-2 in the third set, but
Rosenfeld fought back.
By breaking Basham's serve twice and
holding his own. Rosenfeld tied the score at
5-5. Unfortunately, that's where the come
back ended as Basham broke Rosenfeld's
serve and then held his own for the match.
Gould expressed concern over Rosen
feld's serve. "Eric has had problems (with
his serve) for the past few weeks. It's some
thing we're going to have to work on," he
said.
In other singles matches, Stanford's Jim
Grabb clobbered Chuck Willenborg 6-2, 6-
1. Team captain Mark McKeen had a scare
but eventually defeated Craig Ventor 6-7,
6-3, 6-4. The Cardinal wound up winning

five of the six singles matches.
At this point, with the Cardinal up by four
matches with only three remaining,
Klaparda entered the match with his usual
doubles partner. Ventor, to take on the Car
dinal's No. 2 team of Goldie and Roscnfeld.
Although Klaparda and Ventor are ranked
No. 28 in the country, the Cardinal pair was
victorious 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.
Stanford's No. I team of Grabb and John
Letts cruised past UCLA's makeshift team
of Basham and Peter Moin Bet, 6-1, 6-3.
Stanford defaulted at No. 3 doubles after
losing the first set 6-3.
Although Stanford had a win, Gould was
disappointed. "Without their No. 1 or 2, it
was kind of a hollow victory," he said. "1
didn't think we played all that well, even in
a few of the matches we won."
If the match against UCLA was hollow.
Saturday's match against USC was filled
with importance and excitement. This was
the annual indoor match where the top
three matches (No. 1 singles and No. 1 and
2 doubles) were played in the evening at
Maples Pavilion. The match began outdoors
with the No. 3, 4, and 6 singles matches.
USC's No. 3 player, Rick Leach, got off
to a fast start and defeated Grabb 6-3, 6-2.
Grabb was never in control and never broke
Leach's serve. Stanford came back and won
on the No. 4 court as McKeen regained his
domination over Jorge Lozano, who beat
him last week in Los Angeles, winning this
time by the score of 6-3, 6-2. Letts contin
ued his winning ways as he polished off Matt
Emerson 6-4, 6-2. His win put Stanford in
front 2-1.
Freshman Derrick Rostagno, who has
been playing exceptional tennis recently,
took control of his match against Tim Paw
sat and never let go as he won 6-1, 6-3. But
the Trojans came back to keep the match
close at 3-2 as Todd Witsken knocked off
Rosenfeld 6-1, 6-2.
Then in the only doubles match of the af
ternoon, the Cardinal gave the Trojans a
scare. The No. 3 doubles team of Emerson
and Matt Anger which is ranked No. 26 in
the country, took on McKeen and Gordie
McKee, who had paired up only four times
previous to this match. USC won the first
set easily 6-2, but in the second set, the Car
dinal pair kept the pressure on the Trojans
by breaking their serve four times and win
ning the set 7-5. The third set was just as
close but the Trojans were able to get their
break in the seventh game and won the
match 6-4.
Gould was very happy with McKeen and
McKee's performance. "They (the Trojans)
weren't expecting it to be a close match," he

Sophomore Eric Rosenfeld has had trouble with his serve lately and that trouble may
have cost the Cardinal Saturday night. As the scoreboard indicates (left), Rosenfeld's

rustration.
said. "1 think they were glad
when the match moved inside."
With that win and the overall
score tied at 3-3, the match
moved into Maples. Again the
Cardinal's doubles play
surprised the Trojans. Stan
ford's No. 1 team of Letts and
Cirabb challenged Leach and
Pawsat, who are ranked No. 1 in
the nation for USC, and shut
them out in the first set 6-0. But
then, half way through the
second set with the Cardinal up
4-2, the Trojans changed their
strategies and remained- at the
baseline.
"At first, they just tried to
slug it out," Gould said. "But
then they stayed back to return
our shots, and we had no place
to hit a volley. We were a little
slow in adapting." The Trojans
were able to roll off four straight
games and win the set 6-4.
In the third set. Letts and
Grabb changed their tactics and
stayed back as well. The set was
very close as the Cardinal broke

service in the last game and won
the set 6-4. With this victory,
Stanford was up 4-3 and needed
only to win one of the two
remaining matches to beat USC.
But the Cardinal ran out of
surprises, and the Trojans came
up with a few of their own.
Goldie, who has been
phenomenal lately was defeated
in straight sets by Anger 6-3, 6-
3. "Obviously at the beginning,
Danny overhit," Gould said.
"Also he rushed a bit. It's really
a disadvantage to rush as a
back- court player. Also he was
a little nervous. He almost had a
chance to pull it out, but it was
too little, too late."
After a 15-minute break,
Goldie came back on the court
to team up with Rosenfeld and
take on Witsken and Lozano,
who are ranked No. 2 in the na
tion. The teams split the first
two sets with USC winning the
first 6-4, and with Stanford
coming back and winning the
second, 6-3.
At 11:30 p.m., and before
true die-hard tennis fans, the
two teams played one of the
most exciting sets of tennis all
year. There were four back-to

back breaks, as one team would
try to pull ahead by breaking
service but being denied as the
other would answer with a
break of their own. The teams
went into the 12th game and
USC had a 6-5 lead. With the
Trojans up double break and
match point, Rosenfeld double
faulted and USC walked away
from the 12-hour marathon
with a 5-4 victory.
Although Gould was disap
pointed his team did not get the
victory, he still looked at the
match from a positive perspec
tive. "They (USC) are
beatable," he said. "They're the
top team in the country and we
came down to the wire with
them. That's encouraging. I
think if the guys keep healthy
and if we regain our confidence,
then we'll be a factor."
In three weeks the Cardinal
will travel to Athens. Ga., for
the NCAA Championships.
Gould is optimistic about the
team's chances. "We have a
great chance to beat them
(USC) if we play them in the
NCAAs," he said. "We're No. 3
which is not the best; but it's
awfully close."
The weekend was full of surprises for the
Stanford men's tennis team. Unfortunately,
they weren't all in the Cardinal's favor, as it

and Matt Anger which is ranked No. 26 in
the country, took on McKeen and Gordie
McKee, who had paired up only four times
previous to this match. USC won the first
set easily 6-2, but in the second set, the Car
dinal pair kept the pressure on the Trojans
by breaking their serve four times and win
ning the set 7-5. The third set was just as
close but the Trojans were able to get their
break in the seventh game and won the
match 6-4.
Gould was very happy with McKeen and
McKee's performance. "They (the Trojans)

said. "1 think they were glad
when the match moved inside."
With that win and the overall
score tied at 3-3, the match
moved into Maples. Again the
Cardinal's doubles play
surprised the Trojans. Stan
ford's No. 1 team of Letts and
Cirabb challenged Leach and
Pawsat, who are ranked No. 1 in
the nation for USC, and shut
them out in the first set 6-0. But
then, half way through the
second set with the Cardinal up
4-2, the Trojans changed their
strategies and remained- at the
baseline.
"At first, they just tried to
slug it out," Gould said. "But
then they stayed back to return
our shots, and we had no place
to hit a volley. We were a little
slow in adapting." The Trojans
were able to roll off four straight
games and win the set 6-4.
In the third set. Letts and
Grabb changed their tactics and
stayed back as well. The set was
very close as the Cardinal broke

service in the last game and won
the set 6-4. With this victory,
Stanford was up 4-3 and needed
only to win one of the two
remaining matches to beat USC.
But the Cardinal ran out of
surprises, and the Trojans came
up with a few of their own.
Goldie, who has been
phenomenal lately was defeated
in straight sets by Anger 6-3, 6-
3. "Obviously at the beginning,
Danny overhit," Gould said.
"Also he rushed a bit. It's really
a disadvantage to rush as a
back- court player. Also he was
a little nervous. He almost had a
chance to pull it out, but it was
too little, too late."
After a 15-minute break,
Goldie came back on the court
to team up with Rosenfeld and
take on Witsken and Lozano,
who are ranked No. 2 in the na
tion. The teams split the first
two sets with USC winning the
first 6-4, and with Stanford
coming back and winning the
second, 6-3.
At 11:30 p.m., and before
true die-hard tennis fans, the
two teams played one of the
most exciting sets of tennis all
year. There were four back-to

back breaks, as one team would
try to pull ahead by breaking
service but being denied as the
other would answer with a
break of their own. The teams
went into the 12th game and
USC had a 6-5 lead. With the
Trojans up double break and
match point, Rosenfeld double
faulted and USC walked away
from the 12-hour marathon
with a 5-4 victory.
Although Gould was disap
pointed his team did not get the
victory, he still looked at the
match from a positive perspec
tive. "They (USC) are
beatable," he said. "They're the
top team in the country and we
came down to the wire with
them. That's encouraging. I
think if the guys keep healthy
and if we regain our confidence,
then we'll be a factor."
In three weeks the Cardinal
will travel to Athens. Ga., for
the NCAA Championships.
Gould is optimistic about the
team's chances. "We have a
great chance to beat them
(USC) if we play them in the
NCAAs," he said. "We're No. 3
which is not the best; but it's
awfully close."
The weekend was full of surprises for the
Stanford men's tennis team. Unfortunately,
they weren't all in the Cardinal's favor, as it
clobbered UCLA on Friday, 7-2, but lost a
very close match to USC on Saturday, 5-4.
The Cardinal is now I 7-5 overall and 6-3 in
the Pac-10.
UCLA began the weekend on a bizzare
note when it announced Friday morning
that it would not play it's top two singles
players, Jeff Klaparda and Michael Kures.
Klaparda and Kures are ranked No. 11 and
No. 12 respectively in the national coaches
poll. The Bruins were vague in explaining
the absence of their stars, citing only
stomach problems as Klaparda's alibi.
Still, the Cardinal struggled to win the in
dividual matches. Dan Goldie, who Head
Coach Dick Gould considers to be among
the top five singles players in the country,
defeated Jimmy Pugh 7-5, 6-4. Pugh usually

plays on the No. 3 spot and is currently un
ranked.
Stanford's No. 2 player, Eric Rosenfeld,
faced UCLA's No. 5 seed, Mark Basham
and lost a close match in three sets 7-5, 3-6,
7-5. Basham was up 5-2 in the third set, but
Rosenfeld fought back.
By breaking Basham's serve twice and
holding his own. Rosenfeld tied the score at
5-5. Unfortunately, that's where the come
back ended as Basham broke Rosenfeld's
serve and then held his own for the match.
Gould expressed concern over Rosen
feld's serve. "Eric has had problems (with
his serve) for the past few weeks. It's some
thing we're going to have to work on," he
said.
In other singles matches, Stanford's Jim
Grabb clobbered Chuck Willenborg 6-2, 6-
1. Team captain Mark McKeen had a scare
but eventually defeated Craig Ventor 6-7,
6-3, 6-4. The Cardinal wound up winning

five of the six singles matches.
At this point, with the Cardinal up by four
matches with only three remaining,
Klaparda entered the match with his usual
doubles partner. Ventor, to take on the Car
dinal's No. 2 team of Goldie and Roscnfeld.
Although Klaparda and Ventor are ranked
No. 28 in the country, the Cardinal pair was
victorious 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.
Stanford's No. I team of Grabb and John
Letts cruised past UCLA's makeshift team
of Basham and Peter Moin Bet, 6-1, 6-3.
Stanford defaulted at No. 3 doubles after
losing the first set 6-3.
Although Stanford had a win, Gould was
disappointed. "Without their No. 1 or 2, it
was kind of a hollow victory," he said. "1
didn't think we played all that well, even in
a few of the matches we won."
If the match against UCLA was hollow.
Saturday's match against USC was filled
with importance and excitement. This was
the annual indoor match where the top
three matches (No. 1 singles and No. 1 and
2 doubles) were played in the evening at
Maples Pavilion. The match began outdoors
with the No. 3, 4, and 6 singles matches.
USC's No. 3 player, Rick Leach, got off
to a fast start and defeated Grabb 6-3, 6-2.
Grabb was never in control and never broke
Leach's serve. Stanford came back and won
on the No. 4 court as McKeen regained his
domination over Jorge Lozano, who beat
him last week in Los Angeles, winning this
time by the score of 6-3, 6-2. Letts contin
ued his winning ways as he polished off Matt
Emerson 6-4, 6-2. His win put Stanford in
front 2-1.
Freshman Derrick Rostagno, who has
been playing exceptional tennis recently,
took control of his match against Tim Paw
sat and never let go as he won 6-1, 6-3. But
the Trojans came back to keep the match
close at 3-2 as Todd Witsken knocked off
Rosenfeld 6-1, 6-2.
Then in the only doubles match of the af
