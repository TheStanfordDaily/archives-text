## Netmen beat battered UCLA, fault to USC 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
The weekend was full of surprises for the
Stanford men's tennis team. Unfortunately,
they weren't all in the Cardinal's favor, as it
clobbered UCLA on Friday, 7-2, but lost a
very close match to USC on Saturday, 5-4.
The Cardinal is now I 7-5 overall and 6-3 in
the Pac-10.
UCLA began the weekend on a bizzare
note when it announced Friday morning
that it would not play it's top two singles
players, Jeff Klaparda and Michael Kures.
Klaparda and Kures are ranked No. 11 and
No. 12 respectively in the national coaches
poll. The Bruins were vague in explaining
the absence of their stars, citing only
stomach problems as Klaparda's alibi.
Still, the Cardinal struggled to win the in
dividual matches. Dan Goldie, who Head
Coach Dick Gould considers to be among
the top five singles players in the country,
defeated Jimmy Pugh 7-5, 6-4. Pugh usually

plays on the No. 3 spot and is currently un
ranked.
Stanford's No. 2 player, Eric Rosenfeld,
faced UCLA's No. 5 seed, Mark Basham
and lost a close match in three sets 7-5, 3-6,
7-5. Basham was up 5-2 in the third set, but
Rosenfeld fought back.
By breaking Basham's serve twice and
holding his own. Rosenfeld tied the score at
5-5. Unfortunately, that's where the come
back ended as Basham broke Rosenfeld's
serve and then held his own for the match.
Gould expressed concern over Rosen
feld's serve. "Eric has had problems (with
his serve) for the past few weeks. It's some
thing we're going to have to work on," he
said.
In other singles matches, Stanford's Jim
Grabb clobbered Chuck Willenborg 6-2, 6-
1. Team captain Mark McKeen had a scare
but eventually defeated Craig Ventor 6-7,
6-3, 6-4. The Cardinal wound up winning

five of the six singles matches.
At this point, with the Cardinal up by four
matches with only three remaining,
Klaparda entered the match with his usual
doubles partner. Ventor, to take on the Car
dinal's No. 2 team of Goldie and Roscnfeld.
Although Klaparda and Ventor are ranked
No. 28 in the country, the Cardinal pair was
victorious 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.
Stanford's No. I team of Grabb and John
Letts cruised past UCLA's makeshift team
of Basham and Peter Moin Bet, 6-1, 6-3.
Stanford defaulted at No. 3 doubles after
losing the first set 6-3.
Although Stanford had a win, Gould was
disappointed. "Without their No. 1 or 2, it
was kind of a hollow victory," he said. "1
didn't think we played all that well, even in
a few of the matches we won."
If the match against UCLA was hollow.
Saturday's match against USC was filled
with importance and excitement. This was
the annual indoor match where the top
three matches (No. 1 singles and No. 1 and
2 doubles) were played in the evening at
Maples Pavilion. The match began outdoors
with the No. 3, 4, and 6 singles matches.
USC's No. 3 player, Rick Leach, got off
to a fast start and defeated Grabb 6-3, 6-2.
Grabb was never in control and never broke
Leach's serve. Stanford came back and won
on the No. 4 court as McKeen regained his
domination over Jorge Lozano, who beat
him last week in Los Angeles, winning this
time by the score of 6-3, 6-2. Letts contin
ued his winning ways as he polished off Matt
Emerson 6-4, 6-2. His win put Stanford in
front 2-1.
Freshman Derrick Rostagno, who has
been playing exceptional tennis recently,
took control of his match against Tim Paw
sat and never let go as he won 6-1, 6-3. But
the Trojans came back to keep the match
close at 3-2 as Todd Witsken knocked off
Rosenfeld 6-1, 6-2.
Then in the only doubles match of the af
ternoon, the Cardinal gave the Trojans a
scare. The No. 3 doubles team of Emerson
and Matt Anger which is ranked No. 26 in
the country, took on McKeen and Gordie
McKee, who had paired up only four times
previous to this match. USC won the first
set easily 6-2, but in the second set, the Car
dinal pair kept the pressure on the Trojans
by breaking their serve four times and win
ning the set 7-5. The third set was just as
close but the Trojans were able to get their
break in the seventh game and won the
match 6-4.
Gould was very happy with McKeen and
McKee's performance. "They (the Trojans)
weren't expecting it to be a close match," he

Sophomore Eric Rosenfeld has had trouble with his serve lately and that trouble may
have cost the Cardinal Saturday night. As the scoreboard indicates (left), Rosenfeld's
final serve against the Trojans, which went long for a double-fault, ended the match and
