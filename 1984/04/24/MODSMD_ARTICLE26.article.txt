### ROB ZWEIG Staff sports writer 
What a difference a few
weeks make.
Two weeks ago. the Stanford
baseball team sat in third place
in the Pacific-1 0 Conference
Southern Division, saddled with
a six-game conference losing
streak and four games behind
second-place USC.
Today, thanks to the Univer
sity of Arizona and to the Card's
pitcher-pinch hitter Jeff Ballard.
Stanford is one game out of
second place and a possible
NCAA tournament berth.
Arizona has apparently taken
a liking to Stanford, doing the
Cardinal a big favor for the
second weekend in a row. Ten
days ago the Wildcats bowed
meekly to the Cardinal three

straight times. This past
weekend they became tigers,
feasting to a series sweep of No.
2-ranked USC. Meanwhile.
Stanford set up a showdown
with USC at Sunken Diamond
this week by winning two out ot
three games at UCLA during a
busy holiday weekend. The
Card also traveled to Fresno
State for a non-league contest
last night, the result of which
was not available at press time.
That brings us to Jeff Ballard.
Ballard completed an unusual
"double" in Los Angeles,
literally winning the first and
third games of the series from
two different positions.
Thursday night. Ballard — the
left-handed pitcher — twirled a
four-hit. complete game shutout
of the Bruins. 7-0.

tagged a two-out eighth-inning
home run that boosted Stanford
to a 5-4 get-away-day victory
and new heights in the "Six-
Pac" race.
"Not bad." was Stanford
Head Coach Mark Marquess'
evaluation of the versatile
pitcher's weekend. As for his
ballclub's weekend Marquess
was thankful to reti'rn with two
wins, saying, "I didn't feel that
we hit the ball all weekend,
but lately we've done enough to
win. especially since we haven't
been swinging a hot bat."
The Card, now 30-19-1 over
all and 1 in the league, didn't
need to hit the ball in the first
game as it scored twice in the
second inning without a hit and
never looked back. Mike
Deßenon helped to seal Bal
lard's sixth win against four
losses, going 2 for 4 with two
runs batted in. UCLA starter
Jeff Pries (5-3) got the loss.
"I feel like I'm starting to
really get in the groove," said
the winning hurler, an all
conference reliever as a sopho
more last year. " My fastball
was moving real well and 1 had
good command of my breaking
pitches. That keeps the batter
off balance."
The Stanford hitters were the
ones off balance the next night
collecting just seven hits off two
pitchers including Andy
Naworski (1-5), the winner in
relief. Stanford's lone run came
in the ninth, but the game had
already been decided in the two
previous frames.
The Card's John Radtke had
some more hard luck this week,
throwing six shutout innings
before John Nero ripped a two
out homer in the seventh to give
UCLA a 2-0 lead. Then the roof
caved in.
After a double. Matt Mor
rison grounded to sure-handed
and usually sure-footed
shortstop John Verducci, but
Verducci caught his spike in his
shoelace and fell to the ground
giving the Bruins new life in the
inning. Two pitchers later,
UCLA's Shane Mack blasted a
bases-loaded double to make
the score 5-0. Radtke dropped

to 6-2 the season with the
loss.
1 he Cardinal bounced back
to pound out 13 hits in Satur
day's 5-4 triumph, including
three by Darryl Stephens and
two each from Rick Lundblade
and Mark Davis, to back the
strong pitching performances of
starter Kevin kunkel and
relievers Doug Gwaltney (the
winning pitcher) and freshman
Rob Wassenaar. who recorded
his first career save.
"The pitching has been out
standing the last two weeks,"
Marquess aptly noted.
UCLA's Nero was again
troublesome for the Stanford
hurlers, tripling in two runs to
give the Bruins an early 2-0 lead
in the second and then doubling
and scoring the go-ahead run in

the seventh to put UCLA up 4-
Stantord scored twice in the
third to tie the game 2-2. hut
squandered a golden opportu
nity to blow the game open in
the fourth. After loading the
bases with none out. the Card
scored only once before killing
its own rally.
In the end. the hallgamc came
down to Ballard's two-out blast
alter Walt Harris opened the
eighth with a single. Ballard
popped a 1-2 slider from loser
Dana Ridenour (2-4) over the
right-center field wall tor a two
run homer, his second of the
campaign. The loss kept UCLA
tied for the "Six-Pac" cellar
spot at 6-14 in conference and
24-24 on the season.

What a difference a few
weeks make.
Two weeks ago. the Stanford
baseball team sat in third place
in the Pacific-1 0 Conference
Southern Division, saddled with
a six-game conference losing
streak and four games behind
second-place USC.
Today, thanks to the Univer
sity of Arizona and to the Card's
pitcher-pinch hitter Jeff Ballard.
Stanford is one game out of
second place and a possible
NCAA tournament berth.
Arizona has apparently taken
a liking to Stanford, doing the
Cardinal a big favor for the
second weekend in a row. Ten
days ago the Wildcats bowed
meekly to the Cardinal three

straight times. This past
weekend they became tigers,
feasting to a series sweep of No.
2-ranked USC. Meanwhile.
Stanford set up a showdown
with USC at Sunken Diamond
this week by winning two out ot
three games at UCLA during a
busy holiday weekend. The
Card also traveled to Fresno
State for a non-league contest
last night, the result of which
was not available at press time.
That brings us to Jeff Ballard.
Ballard completed an unusual
"double" in Los Angeles,
literally winning the first and
third games of the series from
two different positions.
Thursday night. Ballard — the
left-handed pitcher — twirled a
four-hit. complete game shutout
of the Bruins. 7-0.

After the Cardinal dropped
game No. 2. S-l, Ballard, then
wearing his pinch-hitter's hat.
tagged a two-out eighth-inning
home run that boosted Stanford
to a 5-4 get-away-day victory
and new heights in the "Six-
Pac" race.
"Not bad." was Stanford
Head Coach Mark Marquess'
evaluation of the versatile
pitcher's weekend. As for his
ballclub's weekend Marquess
was thankful to reti'rn with two
wins, saying, "I didn't feel that
we hit the ball all weekend,
but lately we've done enough to
win. especially since we haven't
been swinging a hot bat."
The Card, now 30-19-1 over
all and 1 in the league, didn't
need to hit the ball in the first
game as it scored twice in the
second inning without a hit and
never looked back. Mike
Deßenon helped to seal Bal
lard's sixth win against four
losses, going 2 for 4 with two
runs batted in. UCLA starter
Jeff Pries (5-3) got the loss.
