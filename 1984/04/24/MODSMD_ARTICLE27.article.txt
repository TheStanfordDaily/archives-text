# Spikers end season with loss to Hawaii
## 
### TRASK LEONARD 
The men's volleyball team
packed its hags and left for a
two-game set against the Uni
versity of Hawaii at the end of
last week. Unfortunately, the
spikers did not come back with
what they had hoped for, losing
both matches, 3-1.
The losses make Stanford's
final record 6-12 and placed it
Kth in the competitive Califor
nia Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association (OVA). Hawaii,
who had not won at home this
year until it beat the Cardinal,
finished at 9-9.
In the first match, held on
Wednesday, Hawaii dominated
the spikers, winning by scores of
15-5, 16-IS, 15-6,and 15-8. On
Friday, it was the same story for
the Cardinal, as Hawaii won
scores of 11-15, 15-13, 15-S
and 15-6.
Stanford met a team at the
top of its form, according to
Head Coach Fred Sturm. " They
were just playing as well as they
had all year long." said Sturm.
"They were really fired up to
win their first home match of
the year. But I still felt that we
were in control for a while, only

to have a lot of unforced errors
take us down."
Brett Monello, who injured
his back in the first match and
was unable to play all of the
second match, agreed with
Sturm.
"They played solidly all the
way around. Hawaii is a team
that can beat people, even
though they don't have all that
great a record. They beat USC
in l.os Angeles earlier this year,
so we realized going into the
game that we had to play well,"
said Monello.
In the first match, Craig
Lauchner led Stanford with 29
kills and a 42 percent kill rate.
Jon Root was tops in the second
match at 14 kills, with Monello
and Stephen Blue close behind
at 13 and 12, respectively.
Even though the Cardinal
finished the year at a disap
pointing mark of 13-15 overall,
the future looks brighter. Not
only does the team have no
starters graduating, but it
landed the top recruit in the na
tion this year in Scott Fortune.
"We definitely are looking
forward to /text fall," said
Monello.
