# Tremendous last-day comeback for Card
## Golfers drive for playoff bid 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
The Stanford men's golf
team, a highly probable selec
tion for the NCAA tournament
a month and a half ago, has sud
denly embarked on an inex
plicable run of mediocrity.
,Early in April, the team
finished sixth in the Stanford
U.S. Intercollegiate — on its
home course — and then
slumped to a disappointing
lOth-place finish in the Fresno-
Pepsi Classic two weeks later.
All at once, the team's rela
tive security is gone. With three
tournaments left on the
schedule, the Cardinal men find
themselves in a real struggle for
the last berth in the Far West
region with Arizona, Fresno
State and the University of the
Pacific-
On April 17, Stanford headed
down to Santa Cruz for the
Western Intercollegiate,
knowing it must finish ahead of
these three major competitors
in order to maintain serious
contention.
But the skid continued. On
Tuesday, the first day of play,
the best individual round by a
Cardinal golfer was senior Doug
Thompson's six-over-par 78,
and the team as a whole shot a
miserable 399, landing it in 17th
place.
Wednesday was not much
better. Sophomore Carl Wagner
topped the Stanford scoreboard
with an unimpressive 77, the
team struggled to a 393, and
with 18 holes to go the Cardinal
stood in 12th place, five strokes
behind Pacific, 11 away from
Fresno State, and 17 very large
strokes behind its chief rival for
the NCAA bid, Arizona. The
NCAA has never looked so far
away.
You have to understand this
background information in or
der to appreciate what the Stan
ford golfers accomplished in the
final round of the Western In
tercollegiate last Thursday.
With its backs against the wall,
the Cardinal came out and
played one of its most inspired
rounds of the year, and when
the dust had cleared, Stanford
stood in fifth place for the
tournament, ahead of Pacific,
Fresno State and, incredibly,

even Arizona.
The numbers speak for them
selves. Stanford fired a three-over
par 363 over the last IK holes.
30 strokes lower than the team's
previous round, and the lowest
score of the day by 11 strokes.
The worst round of the day by a
Stanford golfer was junior Scott
Erickson's 75. The best was
Wagner's 7 1.
Coming from 17 strokes be
hind on the last day to defeat a
key rival is no mean feat, and
for Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf,
there could hardly have been a
better time for it.
"I was really worried about
(the team's) mental attitude
after losing at home and in
Fresno." said Schaaf. who
added that he felt this comeback
would provide an important
psychological boost for this
weekend's Sun Devil Classic in
Phoenix.
Host team San Jose State
emerged as the tournament vic
tor, effectively assuring itself of
a tournament berth by shooting
a 1105, 33 strokes better than
runner-up UCLA's 1138. San
Diego State finished at 1153.
USC wound up at 1 154. and
Stanford vaulted to a final score
of 1155 — only three shots out
of third place.
Individual honors went to San
Jose State's Grant Barnes, who
fired a three-over-par 219.
Among the players tied for
second at 220 were USC's Sam
Randolph, recent winner of the
Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate
and Arizona State's Jim Carter,
individual champion of the 1983
NCAA tournament.
Low scorer for the Cardinal
was senior Tim Robinson, who
finished with a 229. Wagner
ended up one stroke back at
230, followed by Thompson at
233, Erickson and sophomore
Don Walsworth at 234 and
senior Lanny Sawchuck with a
235.
Still, Stanford is far from
being out of the woods. There
are two very tough tournaments
left to play, and the Cardinal
must continue to play well and
finish ahead of Arizona, Pacific
and Fresno State in order to
assure a bid.
