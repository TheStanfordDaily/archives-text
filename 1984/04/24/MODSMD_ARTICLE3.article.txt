### TROY EID Daily staff 
An ASSU graduate senator was
among 37 demonstrators jailed Friday
morning for attempting to take com
munion in a busy intersection outside
the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in Livermore.
Erik Thompson, a student til the
Graduate School of Business and a
teaching associate in the Peace Studies
program, was accused oi obstructing
traffic near an entrance to the
Livermore facility, home ot much of
the nation's nuclear weapons research.
He was released later in the day, con
tingent on a court appearance that
remains to be scheduled.
Thompson said he opted tor civil
disobedience after his repeated letters
to congressmen tailed to achieve tan
gible results.

"It would seem that action out of
court doesn't work." he said. "I think
that these weapons are unjust, and
that devoting some of the best minds
in our country to nuclear weapons
production is unjust.
"1 got to the point where 1 was will
ing to go to jail. It the courts could de
termine that this is illegal, then they
can put a stop to it."
The Good Friday demonstration,
the largest in a weeklong series of Bay
Area protests, has become an annual
gathering for local peace activists. In a
related event, seven demonstrators
were arrested for trespassing at Site
300, Livermore's high explosive test
ing facility near Tracy.
The week's arrest tally of 56 fell
short of the 2000 protesters taken into
custody at similar demonstrations in
1982 and 1983. But Thompson, who

serves as chairman of the board of the
United Christian Campus Ministry,
said he is convinced the effort achieves
results.
"People who work at the lab . . . will
be more and more aware of what's
going on," he said. "We only blocked
one entrance to the lab. We publicized
the event so that workers could use
other entrances.
"We have not been charged with
anything, but were told we will receive
a citation in the mail," Thompson
said. "Most of us plan to plead not
guilty if charged." The 1000
demonstrators arrested last year
elected to stay in jail for two weeks to
continue their protest.
Nuclear parity between the super
powers means that a unilateral U.S.
