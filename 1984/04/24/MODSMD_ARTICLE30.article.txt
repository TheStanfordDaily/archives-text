## Director Schepisi makes 'Iceman' beautiful 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
In an era in which more and
more film directors are coming
from television, and movies,
which many people see on cable
rather than in theaters, tend
more and more to be reduced in
scope, the Australian emigre
Fred Schepisi still thinks in
terms of the big screen.
You can't get on HBO what
Iceman offers you in a
moviehouse: from the majestic
opening shots of twin choppers
dancing under an arch of swirled
ice, Schepisi uses his camera to
engage his audience. We seem
to be in a fairy-tale palace — a
setting for Hans Christian An
dersen's "The Snow Queen,"
perhaps. The magic continues
as, amid the vast Arctic ex
panse, a team of archeologists
pack a huge block of ice in net
ting and secure it to the runners
of one of the helicopters; the
machine glides off like some
regal bird holding a prize in its
beak.
The first 20 minutes or so of
Iceman are breathtaking — the
way Schepisi's The Cham of
Jimmie Blacksmith, set in rural
Australia, was, and parts of his
first American picture,
Barbarosa, a western in which
the characters constantly
seemed to be defined by their
relationship to the land.
Working with the cinematog
rapher lan Baker, Schepisi
brings an extraordinary beauty
and immediacy to the revivifica
tion of the "iceman," a Nean

derthal who — through a time
arresting miracle the doctors at
this Arctic outpost seek an ex
planation for — has survived
perfectly intact, frozen in ice.
for somewhere between 20,000
and 40.000 years.
We watch a laser slicing
through the mass of ice. and as
the surface mirrors the crimson
glare, unseen hands appear to
be pumping blood into the body
petrified inside. What we see
through the filter of ice might be
a death mask of porcelain or
ivory; when the ice thaws —
running in thin ropes of water
down the metal arms it rests on,
like tendons loosened by the
heat — the whitened form that
emerges suggests a sculpture by
Rodin. The bearded face has a
Biblical cast — it's a face so far
transported by emotion that we
can read either agony or rapture
in it — and the arms and legs,
extended in the air. seem to be
set on an invisible ladder. What
was this prehistoric figure doing,
we wonder, when the ice caged
him — trying to climb toward
heaven?
Iceman tells the story of what
happens to this man when he
awakens to the scrutiny ol a
team of doctors who want to in
vestigate how his system works,
how it has survived unknown
centuries, and to the curiosity of
a compassionate anthropologist,
Shephard (Timothy Hutton),
who hopes to learn from him
how man evolved.
The Chip Proser-John Drim

mer script sets up the division
between science and humanism
at the outset, when Shephard,
entering the operating room as
the iceman gains consciousness,
insists on tearing off his hospital
mask si) that the waking patient
can glimpse another human
face. It's a beautiful moment but
a tired thesis, and the
screenwriters drive it into the
ground in the course of the film,
which spends too much time on
Shephard's efforts to
"unfreeze" the humanitarian
impulses of the brilliant doctor,
Brady (Lindsay Crouse), at the
head of the medical team. It is a
measure of the narrowness and
pedestrianism of the script that
when Shephard establishes
communication with the Nean
derthal and hears him speak his
name, which sounds like
"Shoru," he vulgarizes it into
"Charlie," and that unfortunate
moniker sticks to this noble,
complex character to the end of
the picture. As one might ex
pect, the scientists' conferences
about Charlie's fate and the im
plications of bringing him back
to life are excruciating: Proser
and Drimmer approach three or
four of the most puzzling ques
tions of modern civilization and
scrawl their answers in crayon.
(They would have done better
to leave the querying to
Schepisi's camera.)
It doesn't help that Shephard

and Brady keep addressing each
other by their last names, like
the crew members in Alien; if
this was meant to be a comment
on the dehumanizing atmo
sphere created by scientific re
search, it is both fatuous and in
appropriate (since Shephard
presumably doesn't belong in
the scientists' camp).
But the heart of the movie lies
in the scenes that center on
Charlie, played by the Chinese-
American actor John Lone, who
has appeared in (and directed)
several of David Henry
Hwang's plays. In a role that re
quires him to communicate
thoughts and feelings exclu
sively through his face and body
and through the inflections of
his voice — Charlie's speech has
the subtle musicality of birds or
jungle animals — Lone gives an
immaculate performance. He
makes Charlie's bewilderment
and sorrow, his physical and
emotional and even spiritual
hungers piercingly clear.
The scenes in which he and
Shephard get to know one an
other, especially the first, carry
the same excitement of dis
covery that The Wild Child had.
and some of the early sections of
The Elephant Man (I'm thinking
particularly of the moment
when John Merrick recited the
Lord's Prayer, proving that he
possessed entirely functioning
mental processes) and of E.T.,

too. Lone's acting is so fully
energized, and touched with
such a fine sense of wonder, that
he infects Lindsay Crouse,
whose only good scene is with
him. and Timothy Mutton,
whose character only comes
alive in this movie when he's
responding to Charlie.
In the film's most charming
sequence, Hutton, in a moment
of quiet relaxation in the
"bavarium" Charlie inhabits (a
wooded area the scientists have
enclosed in a hothouse to shel
ter wild animals and birds),
begins to sing the Neil Young
tune "Heart of Gold" half
aloud, beating out the rhythm
on a piece of bone, and Charlie
responds, urging Shephard to
continue and constructing a
weird counterpoint of his own.
Hutton's marvelous in this scene
— he moves from embarrass
ment at being caught off guard
to fascination with Charlie's
musical contributions to whole
hearted enjoyment. I can't think
of another movie that affirms
friendship in such a funny and
imaginative way. And when
Schepisi cuts to an exterior shot
of the bavarium, where the deli
cate prisms the last rays of the
sun cast on the evening air make
the Arctic cold almost palpable,
we still hear the voices of these
two men whose bond spans
most of time.
Aside from the scenes inside

the compound, where poorly
drawn characters hicker in un
convincing phrases about the
nature of scientific inquiry and
the progress of civilization, the
biggest problem in Iceman
results from a conceptual deci
sion. Schepisi keeps us locked
inside the bavarium with
Charlie for nearly the entire
movie, and after those first un
paralleled views of the northern
expanse, we experience this
restricted perspective as sensory
privation. No doubt Schepisi in
tended this: When Charlie
returns to the outdoors in the
last scenes, we share his as
tonishment and deep pleasure.
But while Schepisi remains in
the bavarium. his camera seems
shackled. I Ic does e\ cry thing he
can to vivify Charlie's initial
connection with his environ
ment (he even provides a cave
with smooth, striated walls that
the art directors. Leon Ericksen
and Josef Russo. might have
dreamed up after reading
Borges' stories), but he can only
manage so much in this limited
context.
Furthermore, the climactic
sequence, when Charlie gains
entry into the compound, isn't
all it could be. Schepisi shifts to
a hand-held camera, picking up
Charlie's terror in its nervous,
jarring movement, but doesn't
transform what Charlie
encounters — a mirror, test
tubes, a Xerox machine — into
the eerie, menacing objects he
perceives in them. In fact, the

whole last half hour of the
movie is rushed and ditticult to
follow: the filmmakers
compress the most unusual and
complex thematic material —
Charlie's spiritual quest — into
a few barely comprehensible
scenes, and the manner in which
Shephard arrives at an under
standing of it is so implausible
that it distracts us. despite the
magnificent final images (which
bring the movie, visually, full
circle).
Did Universal tamper with
Iceman at all. I wonder? The
movie contains breaks in
rhythm surprising in a Fred
Schepisi picture, and I know
that they recut his last one.

without advance publicity, so of
course no one saw it. They
couldn't have known what they
were doing when they as
sembled trailers for Iceman that
made it look like John
Carpenter's remake of The
Thing: even with the good
notices the film has received, it
will be a miracle if people
choose to go to it over that in
flated. clunky piece of pres
tigious pedagogy. Greystoke. to
which it hears some thematic
resemblance. But don't be
misled by ads that make
Greystoke look like an event
and Iceman like a horror film.
Fred Schepisi is a director to the
marrow in his hones, and Hawed
as it is. Iceman is the kind of
picture that reminds us why we
started going to movies in the
first place.

through the mass of ice. and as
the surface mirrors the crimson
glare, unseen hands appear to
be pumping blood into the body
petrified inside. What we see
through the filter of ice might be
a death mask of porcelain or
ivory; when the ice thaws —
running in thin ropes of water
down the metal arms it rests on,
like tendons loosened by the
heat — the whitened form that
emerges suggests a sculpture by
Rodin. The bearded face has a
Biblical cast — it's a face so far
transported by emotion that we
can read either agony or rapture
in it — and the arms and legs,
extended in the air. seem to be
set on an invisible ladder. What
was this prehistoric figure doing,
we wonder, when the ice caged
him — trying to climb toward
heaven?
Iceman tells the story of what
happens to this man when he
awakens to the scrutiny ol a
team of doctors who want to in
vestigate how his system works,
how it has survived unknown
centuries, and to the curiosity of
a compassionate anthropologist,
Shephard (Timothy Hutton),
who hopes to learn from him
how man evolved.
The Chip Proser-John Drim

mer script sets up the division
between science and humanism
at the outset, when Shephard,
entering the operating room as
the iceman gains consciousness,
insists on tearing off his hospital
mask si) that the waking patient
can glimpse another human
face. It's a beautiful moment but
a tired thesis, and the
screenwriters drive it into the
ground in the course of the film,
which spends too much time on
Shephard's efforts to
"unfreeze" the humanitarian
impulses of the brilliant doctor,
Brady (Lindsay Crouse), at the
head of the medical team. It is a
measure of the narrowness and
pedestrianism of the script that
when Shephard establishes
communication with the Nean
derthal and hears him speak his
name, which sounds like
"Shoru," he vulgarizes it into
"Charlie," and that unfortunate
moniker sticks to this noble,
complex character to the end of
the picture. As one might ex
pect, the scientists' conferences
about Charlie's fate and the im
plications of bringing him back
to life are excruciating: Proser
and Drimmer approach three or
four of the most puzzling ques
tions of modern civilization and
scrawl their answers in crayon.
(They would have done better
to leave the querying to
Schepisi's camera.)
It doesn't help that Shephard

and Brady keep addressing each
other by their last names, like
the crew members in Alien; if
this was meant to be a comment
on the dehumanizing atmo
sphere created by scientific re
search, it is both fatuous and in
appropriate (since Shephard
presumably doesn't belong in
the scientists' camp).
But the heart of the movie lies
in the scenes that center on
Charlie, played by the Chinese-
American actor John Lone, who
has appeared in (and directed)
several of David Henry
Hwang's plays. In a role that re
quires him to communicate
thoughts and feelings exclu
sively through his face and body
and through the inflections of
his voice — Charlie's speech has
the subtle musicality of birds or
jungle animals — Lone gives an
immaculate performance. He
makes Charlie's bewilderment
and sorrow, his physical and
emotional and even spiritual
hungers piercingly clear.
The scenes in which he and
Shephard get to know one an
other, especially the first, carry
the same excitement of dis
covery that The Wild Child had.
and some of the early sections of
The Elephant Man (I'm thinking
particularly of the moment
when John Merrick recited the
Lord's Prayer, proving that he
possessed entirely functioning
mental processes) and of E.T.,

too. Lone's acting is so fully
energized, and touched with
such a fine sense of wonder, that
he infects Lindsay Crouse,
whose only good scene is with
him. and Timothy Mutton,
whose character only comes
alive in this movie when he's
responding to Charlie.
In the film's most charming
sequence, Hutton, in a moment
of quiet relaxation in the
"bavarium" Charlie inhabits (a
wooded area the scientists have
enclosed in a hothouse to shel
ter wild animals and birds),
begins to sing the Neil Young
tune "Heart of Gold" half
aloud, beating out the rhythm
on a piece of bone, and Charlie
responds, urging Shephard to
continue and constructing a
weird counterpoint of his own.
Hutton's marvelous in this scene
— he moves from embarrass
ment at being caught off guard
to fascination with Charlie's
musical contributions to whole
hearted enjoyment. I can't think
of another movie that affirms
friendship in such a funny and
imaginative way. And when
Schepisi cuts to an exterior shot
of the bavarium, where the deli
cate prisms the last rays of the
sun cast on the evening air make
the Arctic cold almost palpable,
we still hear the voices of these
two men whose bond spans
most of time.
Aside from the scenes inside

the compound, where poorly
drawn characters hicker in un
convincing phrases about the
nature of scientific inquiry and
the progress of civilization, the
biggest problem in Iceman
results from a conceptual deci
sion. Schepisi keeps us locked
inside the bavarium with
Charlie for nearly the entire
movie, and after those first un
paralleled views of the northern
expanse, we experience this
restricted perspective as sensory
privation. No doubt Schepisi in
tended this: When Charlie
returns to the outdoors in the
last scenes, we share his as
tonishment and deep pleasure.
But while Schepisi remains in
the bavarium. his camera seems
shackled. I Ic does e\ cry thing he
can to vivify Charlie's initial
connection with his environ
ment (he even provides a cave
with smooth, striated walls that
the art directors. Leon Ericksen
and Josef Russo. might have
dreamed up after reading
Borges' stories), but he can only
manage so much in this limited
context.
Furthermore, the climactic
sequence, when Charlie gains
entry into the compound, isn't
all it could be. Schepisi shifts to
a hand-held camera, picking up
Charlie's terror in its nervous,
jarring movement, but doesn't
transform what Charlie
encounters — a mirror, test
tubes, a Xerox machine — into
the eerie, menacing objects he
perceives in them. In fact, the

whole last half hour of the
movie is rushed and ditticult to
follow: the filmmakers
compress the most unusual and
complex thematic material —
Charlie's spiritual quest — into
a few barely comprehensible
scenes, and the manner in which
Shephard arrives at an under
standing of it is so implausible
that it distracts us. despite the
magnificent final images (which
bring the movie, visually, full
circle).
Did Universal tamper with
Iceman at all. I wonder? The
movie contains breaks in
rhythm surprising in a Fred
Schepisi picture, and I know
that they recut his last one.

resemblance. But don't be
misled by ads that make
Greystoke look like an event

Fred Schepisi is a director to the
marrow in his hones, and Hawed
as it is. Iceman is the kind of
picture that reminds us why we
started going to movies in the
first place.

In an era in which more and
more film directors are coming
from television, and movies,
which many people see on cable
rather than in theaters, tend
more and more to be reduced in
scope, the Australian emigre
Fred Schepisi still thinks in
terms of the big screen.
You can't get on HBO what
Iceman offers you in a
moviehouse: from the majestic
opening shots of twin choppers
dancing under an arch of swirled
ice, Schepisi uses his camera to
engage his audience. We seem
to be in a fairy-tale palace — a
setting for Hans Christian An
dersen's "The Snow Queen,"
perhaps. The magic continues
as, amid the vast Arctic ex
panse, a team of archeologists
pack a huge block of ice in net
ting and secure it to the runners
of one of the helicopters; the
machine glides off like some
regal bird holding a prize in its
beak.
The first 20 minutes or so of
Iceman are breathtaking — the
way Schepisi's The Cham of
Jimmie Blacksmith, set in rural
Australia, was, and parts of his
first American picture,
Barbarosa, a western in which
the characters constantly
seemed to be defined by their
relationship to the land.
Working with the cinematog
rapher lan Baker, Schepisi
brings an extraordinary beauty
and immediacy to the revivifica
tion of the "iceman," a Nean

derthal who — through a time
arresting miracle the doctors at
this Arctic outpost seek an ex
planation for — has survived
perfectly intact, frozen in ice.

head of the medical team. It is a
measure of the narrowness and
pedestrianism of the script that
when Shephard establishes
communication with the Nean
derthal and hears him speak his
name, which sounds like
"Shoru," he vulgarizes it into
"Charlie," and that unfortunate
moniker sticks to this noble,
complex character to the end of
the picture. As one might ex
pect, the scientists' conferences
about Charlie's fate and the im
plications of bringing him back
to life are excruciating: Proser
and Drimmer approach three or
four of the most puzzling ques
tions of modern civilization and
scrawl their answers in crayon.
(They would have done better
to leave the querying to
Schepisi's camera.)
It doesn't help that Shephard

and Brady keep addressing each
other by their last names, like
the crew members in Alien; if
this was meant to be a comment
on the dehumanizing atmo
sphere created by scientific re
search, it is both fatuous and in
appropriate (since Shephard
presumably doesn't belong in
the scientists' camp).
But the heart of the movie lies
in the scenes that center on
Charlie, played by the Chinese-
American actor John Lone, who
has appeared in (and directed)
several of David Henry
Hwang's plays. In a role that re
quires him to communicate
thoughts and feelings exclu
sively through his face and body
and through the inflections of
his voice — Charlie's speech has
the subtle musicality of birds or
jungle animals — Lone gives an
immaculate performance. He
makes Charlie's bewilderment
and sorrow, his physical and
emotional and even spiritual
hungers piercingly clear.
The scenes in which he and
Shephard get to know one an
other, especially the first, carry
the same excitement of dis
covery that The Wild Child had.
and some of the early sections of
The Elephant Man (I'm thinking
particularly of the moment
when John Merrick recited the
Lord's Prayer, proving that he
possessed entirely functioning
mental processes) and of E.T.,

too. Lone's acting is so fully
energized, and touched with
such a fine sense of wonder, that
he infects Lindsay Crouse,
whose only good scene is with
him. and Timothy Mutton,
whose character only comes
alive in this movie when he's
responding to Charlie.
In the film's most charming
sequence, Hutton, in a moment
of quiet relaxation in the
"bavarium" Charlie inhabits (a
wooded area the scientists have
enclosed in a hothouse to shel
ter wild animals and birds),
begins to sing the Neil Young
tune "Heart of Gold" half
aloud, beating out the rhythm
on a piece of bone, and Charlie
responds, urging Shephard to
continue and constructing a
weird counterpoint of his own.
Hutton's marvelous in this scene
— he moves from embarrass
ment at being caught off guard
to fascination with Charlie's
musical contributions to whole
hearted enjoyment. I can't think
of another movie that affirms
friendship in such a funny and
imaginative way. And when
Schepisi cuts to an exterior shot
of the bavarium, where the deli
cate prisms the last rays of the
sun cast on the evening air make
the Arctic cold almost palpable,
we still hear the voices of these
two men whose bond spans
most of time.
Aside from the scenes inside

the compound, where poorly
drawn characters hicker in un
convincing phrases about the
nature of scientific inquiry and
the progress of civilization, the
biggest problem in Iceman
results from a conceptual deci
sion. Schepisi keeps us locked
inside the bavarium with
Charlie for nearly the entire
movie, and after those first un
paralleled views of the northern
expanse, we experience this
restricted perspective as sensory
privation. No doubt Schepisi in
tended this: When Charlie
returns to the outdoors in the
last scenes, we share his as
tonishment and deep pleasure.
But while Schepisi remains in
the bavarium. his camera seems
shackled. I Ic does e\ cry thing he
can to vivify Charlie's initial
connection with his environ
ment (he even provides a cave
with smooth, striated walls that
the art directors. Leon Ericksen
and Josef Russo. might have
dreamed up after reading
Borges' stories), but he can only
manage so much in this limited
context.
Furthermore, the climactic
sequence, when Charlie gains
entry into the compound, isn't
all it could be. Schepisi shifts to
a hand-held camera, picking up
Charlie's terror in its nervous,
jarring movement, but doesn't
transform what Charlie
encounters — a mirror, test
tubes, a Xerox machine — into
the eerie, menacing objects he
perceives in them. In fact, the

whole last half hour of the
movie is rushed and ditticult to
follow: the filmmakers
compress the most unusual and
complex thematic material —
Charlie's spiritual quest — into
a few barely comprehensible
scenes, and the manner in which
Shephard arrives at an under
standing of it is so implausible
that it distracts us. despite the
magnificent final images (which
bring the movie, visually, full
circle).
Did Universal tamper with
Iceman at all. I wonder? The
movie contains breaks in
rhythm surprising in a Fred
Schepisi picture, and I know
that they recut his last one.

course no one saw it. They

misled by ads that make
Greystoke look like an event

Fred Schepisi is a director to the
marrow in his hones, and Hawed

picture that reminds us why we
started going to movies in the
first place.
