# 'This is Spinal Tap' is a hilariously accurate parody

Everybody should have a good time at
Thus Is Spinal Tap, a mock documentary, di
rected by Rob Reiner, about the history of a
rock 'n' roll band. At the root of the film's
appeal is a witty screenplay, by Reiner and
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and
Harry Shearer (who also portray the band
members). Spinal Tap is always enjoyable as
it traces a tour of the aging rock group,
which over the years has altered its style to
capitalize on every rock trend, (and done it
all badly) as their 16th album is being
released.
The cleverest parts of the film are the in
terviews with the band members. Rob
Reiner conducts these undoubtedly im
provised discussions, playing the director in
an effective deadpan style. The dialogue is
superb and the performances, especially by
Guest and McKean, capture perfectly the
stereotype of rock n' roll performers. The
band members talk about their evolution as
musicians, their reactions to attacks from
critics and their opinions of each other.
Much of the humor seems fairly obvious as
when Reiner mentions a series of the band's
albums (like Intravenous De Milo) and
quotes from a critic's evaluation of each.
However, nearly all of the jokes, some in
spired, some routine, hit the mark.
We also get to see the band members in
concert, belting out their sometimes preten
tious, sometimes simply stupid lyrics and
playing their instruments with little finesse
but much energy. One of the best scenes in
volves the lead guitarist telling us about his
famed solos; then we see and hear him
create his "music," as the noise level begins
to rise. This is funny enough, but fairly ob
vious. However, just when we think the bit
is over, he grabs a violin and starts scratch
ing it violently across the guitar strings.
There are many other concert scenes just
as funny, (a complex joke involving
Stonehenge parodies perfectly the elabo
rate, overbearing stage effects of many
heavy metal shows), yet the concert footage
is at the same time amazingly realistic. This
band is not too different from most other
heavy metal bands; in a sense, it is a real
heavy metal band. Therefore, the humor
can stem from the realistic documentary
style and this style can be sustained
throughout the film.

As the film proceeds, the hand's fortunes
begin to decline, as gigs are canceled and as
everything imaginable goes wrong with the
release of the new album. There is a won
derful scene at an opening night party where
the cover for the album is discussed. The
conversation is hilarious, but the film
captures very realistically the atmosphere of
the rock 'n' roll social world. Nothing
seems contrived or exaggerated. The satire
emerges simply by viewing real events.
One can appreciate the jokes and
parodies of Spinal Tup without any intellec
tual analysis. In fact, one may not wish to

look beyond the wild humor. However, as
the movie progresses, one cannot help but
discern another level. Even in the early
scenes, some of the jokes go beyond light
parody. There is a running joke about the
number of drummers in the band who have
died, more than 30 in all. One of them dies
by choking on vomit, not his own. When
one thinks about actual deaths in the rock
world, the humor acquires some added bite.
Another thread of humor involves the
band members claims of profundity. In one
scene, the lead guitarist states that he has
been influenced by Mozart and Bach. In an
other, the bassists talks about the sophisti
cation of the ideas in a song called "Sex
Farm."
We see mobs of teenagers going crazy
over these performers who disguise what
talent they have and create instead outland
ish, numbing spectacles of sight and sound.
One cannot help but think that when so
many people are devoted so fiercely to
something this mindless, it does bode well
for society. Behind all of the outrageous

humor, there lies a definite attack on che
creators and consumers of popular culture.
This feeling of spiritual emptiness
beneath the raucous surface is confirmed
towards the end of the film, after one of the
band members walks off stage during an
embarrassing show for a military social.
Next, the band plays at a theme park in
Stockton in front of a handful of fans, and
all of a sudden the humor is gone and only ;i
sense of sadness remains.
For a moment, the band members face
tht? fact that this tour will be their last: the
great illusions have temporarily been

destroyed. The music remains incredibly
bad and the lifestyle remains vapid and
destructive, but the band members can onh
survive and prevail by putting on their show.
Certainly, the satiric tone is still strong, as
the current drummer says just before he is
to spontaneously combust on stage that he
could live without rock 'n' roll as long as
there were still sex and drugs.
Yet, all does seem right with the world as
the band once again blasts out its "music" to
a frenzied crowd.
This Is Spinal Tap is not a perfect movie.
Some of the jokes are too obvious, as when
the band members talk of their brotherly re
lationship and then are seen fighting. Also,
one can question the profundit#of the sa
tire.
However, the film does provide more
than just a series of mindless laughs. It sees
the humor in the real behavior of real
people, and it never strays too far from this
admittedly bizarre reality. It's a movie to
enjoy and to ponder if you so choose.
