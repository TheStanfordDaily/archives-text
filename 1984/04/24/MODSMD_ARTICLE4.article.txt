Gregorio, Dan O'Keefe. Tom
Huening and Becky Morgan in stress
ing the need for the protection of Bay
Area water supplies during a debate
between candidates for the 1 Ith Dis
tict. which includes San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties.
The candidates joined in opposing
another Peripheral Canal proposal.
Last November's canal initiative,
which was rejected by California

The current closed primaries allow
Democratic voters to vote only for
Democratic candidates and
Republicans to vote only for Republi
can candidates.
This system produces highly par
tisan candidates, and "partisanship
has just about paralyzed the process in
Sacramento," Gregorio said.
Although there were some differ
ences over the implementation strate
gies, all the candidates also supported
the concept of workfare.

Workfare, a proposal on the No
vember state ballot, would require ca
pable welfare recipients to work in ex
change for their benefits.
Huening and Gregorio stressed the
need for local control.
Any program has to be able to ad
just to local needs and "needs incen
tives at the local level to make it work
in a humane way," said Gregorio.
Morgan agreed with the workfare
proposal but went a step further.
"We've got to provide a quality edu
cational system." she said, because
"well-educated students are less likely
to need welfare."
