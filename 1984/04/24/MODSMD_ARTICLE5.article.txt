### BING TSO 
The Stanford Community Report, an experi
mental newsletter intended to increase community
contact with Stanford, has so tar drawn veiv posi
tive responses, according to Andy Doty, directoi
of community relations.
At a cost of $10,000 the first issue ot the Com
munity Report, which followed a slick, loim.it
somewhat similar to that used in both the C ampus
Report and the Stanford Observer, was mailed out
to approximately 70.000 homes in the neighboring
communities ol Menlo Park. Palo Alto. I os 1 1os.
Portola Valley and East Palo Alto.
The next issue is tentatively scheduled tor next
fall, with more or less the same format which in
cludes schedules of events, calendars and articles

about the University. "We've only scratched the
surface of what we know about this institution and
how it affects this area." Doty said.
The publication will undoubtedly benefit neigh
boring cities and the University itself by promoting
interaction between the two. Doty said.
" We're aware that Stanford is separated
geographically from its neighbors and that there is
an impression among many in the area that Stan
lord is aloof, removed, elite and doesn't care. So
we wanted ... to help reduce this image In inviting
people to events on campus, to take tours and to
volunteer for activities." Doty said.
And so far. the public has been delighted with
what it has seen. The returns from an informal sur
vey printed within the Community Report indicate

that people are quite pleased that Stanford is
making a concerted effort to reach out to them.
Dot\ said.
However, the publication is more than just a
noble gesture on Stanford's part. The increased
publicity is hoped to draw more volunteers and
donors to gi\e their time and gifts to University
programs as well as resulting in greater ticket reve
nues for Stanford plays, concerts and sporting
events.
•We could justify this entire project solely on
the basis of increased ticket sales." Dot} said.
One major stumbling block in community rela
tions. Dot} said, was that people are simply not
aware of the opportunities available to the public
at Stanford.
' I often give talks to public groups
in which I try to report the many ways
that Stanford benefits the area —
through revenues, student groups, the
many available activities, the steady
employment, the recreation opportu
nities — and invariably people are
well impressed.
"I'm very proud of the fact that our
gestation period was about five
months from the original conception
to when the publication was on the
streets," Doty said.
