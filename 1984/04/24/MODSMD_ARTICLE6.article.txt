# The 						Draw: What if you're not that good at Trivial Pursuit?
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
"We've worked very hard for the last four or five
years to make the Draw as simple and as understand
able as possible," says Rodger Whitney, director of
the Housing Center and assistant dean of Student Af
fairs.
"Some of the principles behind the Draw are not so
simple, but I think we've come a long way to streamline
the process and make it easier for students to under
stand. We review the Draw and make some changes
each year."
This year's undergraduate housing Draw begins
today, and the first change to note is the new location

— the Clubhouse in the Old Union Courtyard. Stu
dents can pick Draw numbers there until Friday after
noon.
Round One preliminary housing assignments will be
announced in mid-May and Round Two's final Draw
assignments will be available at the end of May.
Unlike last year, graduating seniors will not be
allowed to participate in the Draw "because of the un
necessary hassle they cause," according to senior Jen
nifer King, student Draw coordinator. "Their cards
have to be processed even though they will not be living
here next year," she said, "and the assigning process is
tied up unnecessarily."
Whitney said he does not expect results to change
significantly from last year, when row houses such as
Storey, 558 Mayfield and American Studies and
Governor's Corner quarters such as Yost, Murray and
the four-person suites proved the most difficult
residences to secure.
"But the new residences of Governor's Corner, espe
cially desirable the first year they were available, will
probably fall into the whole process this year (and thus

not be quite so coveted)," he explained.
Whitney recommends ranking choices "by where yoi
want to live instead of by last year's cutoff numbers,
but says those numbers provide a useful general guide
"It's a good idea to list a wide range of choices and t
put some general choices, ones that you're likely to gi
into, last," he said.
Running the Draw is more than just another ehor
for Whitney, who calls it "one of the most interesting
things we do at the Housing Center."
"I hope students see the Draw as an enjoyable as
well as a serious process," he said.
This year's Trivial Pursuit theme reflects that desire.
The Draw Book, designed by Deborah Drew, assistant

to the Housing Center, has the board game's design and
contains bits of Stanford trivia. The student who draws
5000, the worst number, will receive a free edition of
the trivia game.
"1 think we've also made the Draw Book easier to
understand," Whitney said. "When I first came, it was
enormously cumbersome. . . . But more people seem to
understand the Draw each year. People should not be
put off by complexity."
Although some complain that the process appears
complex or unfair, especially when compared with
residence assignment procedures of many universities
with ample housing. Whitney says students gripe infre
quently.
"I have not heard a lot of complaints about housing
assignments," he said, "especially now that we have
more mobility (to assign more students housing as a
result of new residences)."
Whitney clears up what he considers a common lal
lacy here, noting the results of a study conducted last
year.

"Many people seem to think that
returning resident priorities at certain
houses make it impossible for them to
get in. Only 25 to 30 percent of resi
dents (of houses that have this
priority) are returning from a previous
year. That means ... 70 to 75 percent
o! (those) houses will he open to new
residents."
Many students entering the Draw
do not have guaranteed housing next
year. But it extra places open up in the
housing pool, these hopefuls may be
added — it they draw low enough —
to the "assignable" group, meaning
they will be considered as though thev
do have guaranteed housing next year.
The assignable group may or may not
have a large number of extra available
spots.
Whitney points out. however, that
these students cannot obtain returning
residence priorities and are thus at a
distinct disadvantage from many
others in the Draw.
