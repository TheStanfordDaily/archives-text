Reagan receives China briefing
Honolulu — U.S. officials are optimistic that President
Reagan and Chinese leaders will be able to sign an interim
agreement on commercial nuclear cooperation between their
two nations when the president visits China later this week.
But there would "have to be a firm commitment" from the
Chinese to work out differences over the handling of nuclear
waste products, said a senior administration official traveling
with Reagan.
I he president was conferring yesterday with aides and re
ceiving a briefing on the Soviet military buildup in the Pacific
region, in preparation for his meetings in Peking.
Focusing on the Soviets, Reagan summoned Adm. William
Crowe, commander of the U.S. Pacific forces, to his suite at a
luxury hotel overlooking the ocean.
"The Soviet capability and Soviet threat is of concern to us,
the Japanese and probably the Chinese," said one senior of
ficial accompanying Reagan.
The official, who spoke on the condition that he not be
identified by name, said Reagan wanted to be prepared to
discuss the subject with the Chinese.
The issue of the nuclear agreement, which could be worth
$20 billion to U.S. contractors, has been an unanswered ques
tion as the president's arrival Thursday in Peking draws near.
U.S. officials have made clear that they would like to have a
treaty of some sort ready for him to sign, although a major
stumbling block over the handling of spent nuclear fuel
seemed, until the weekend, to be insurmountable.
But one senior administration official said as Reagan
arrived in Honolulu on Sunday that an interim agreement "is
more than possible."
Chinese efforts to purchase nuclear technology from
American firms have spurred negotiations that have been
conducted over two years.
Director Landis to stand trial
Angeles — Film director John Landis and two others
were ordered yesterday to stand trial for involuntary
manslaughter in the 1982 deaths of actor Vic Morrow and
two child actors on the set of the movie Twilight Zone.
The ruling, by Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Brian
Crahan, came at the close of a preliminary hearing that began
last January about the helicopter crash that claimed the lives of
Morrow, 53; Renee Chen, 6, and Mycan Dinh Lee, 7.
All three were killed in the movie's final scene as Morrow
waded with one child in each arm across a shallow stream in a
mock Vietnamese village in Saugus, Calif. Morrow was to
have rescued the children from a helicopter attack. But the
helicopter, disabled by heat from a delayed special-effects ex
plosion, crashed on top of them, killing them instantly.
"Mr. Landis, with his quest for'cinema verite,' directed the
actors ... to demonstrate an effective conclusion to his film
segment, which would be both noteworthy and memorable,"
Crahan wrote in concluding a 30-page opinion.
"In achieving such absolutism, he appears to have gone
beyond the realm of simple mechanical direction, (and) in
fact set up . . . the combination of circumstances which in the
final seconds of filming caused death and destruction," the
judge said.
Leaky pump delays Diablo
.San Luis Obispo — A leaky coolant pump will delay the
startup of the embattled Diablo Nuclear power plant to the
"end of this week." a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. spokesman
said yesterday.
Technicians began repairing the seal of one of four coolant
pumps on the Unit 1 reactor at the plant yesterday, a job that
was expected to take 12 hours, PG & E spokesman George
Sarkisian said.
Following more pre-startup testing, the plant is scheduled
to begin operating at low power at the end of this week,
Sarkisian said.
Aside from the coolant pump leak, "everything has run
very smoothly," he said.
Anti-nuclear activists said yesterday the coolant pump leak
is indicative of what they have claimed all along: The plant is
unsafe.
" Had the plant been operating at low power (when the leak
developed), it would have leaked radioactive steam and
water." Abalone Alliance spokeswoman Pam Metcalf said.
"What they consider business as usual, we consider dis
aster," Metcalf said.
The Abalone Alliance is a coalition of anti-nuclear groups
that has organized demonstrations against the $4.9 billion
plant for years.
Sarkisian said water with radioactive particulates would
have leaked had the plant been operating, but the contamina
tion would not have left the reactor containment building.
He said a sump pump within the building would have
removed the particulates, purified the water and returned the
water to the cooling system.
"There's nothing unusual at all (about the leak)," Sarkisian
said. "That's why there's testing."
Meanwhile, police reported six protesters were arrested
yesterday morning at the front gate of the plant and booked
for investigation of trespassing.
Reporter kicked out of Grenada
St. George's, Grenada — Grenadan authorities, disturbed
by what they say is evidence that the revolutionary New Jewel
Movement is beginning to reorganize after last October's in
vasion by the United States, have expelled an American jour
nalist accused of "trying to incite dissent" on the island.
The journalist, Don Foster, is a freelance working for
several Washington radio stations.
After two weeks here he left Grenada just before the
Easter holiday on orders of the police commissioner, Mervyn
Holder, who came here from the Barbados police force.
Holder said the journalist was "using local difficulties
which were inherited to indicate that conditions had become
worse on Grenada since the Americans arrived."
Holder said he had used his powers as police commissioner
and chief of immigration to curtail Foster's entry permit. "We
don't want that sort of problem here," he said.
The local difficulties referred to are extensive electricity
and water-supply cuts, which in recent weeks have left most
businesses and homes with no power for 12 to 18 hours a day.
and without water for days at a time.
According to Nicholas Brathwaite, chairman of Grenada's
interim administration, which is governing the island until
elections are held later this year, the cuts are partly due to a
breakdown of old equipment, and partly the result of
"sabotage" by supporters of the late Maurice Bishop's ill
fated revolution.
