# Libyans will leave embassy on Sunday
## 
### 
From the L.os Angeles Times
London — A spokesman lor the
Libyan Embassy here said yesterday that
he and the others inside would leave the
besieged building as demanded by the
British government but not until just
before the Sunday deadline the British
have set.
Despite shrill statements on Libyan
radio and television, the spokesman,
reached by telephone by the British
Broadcasting Corp., indicated a calm ac
ceptance of the decision bv Britain to
break diplomatic relations with Libya
over the incident a week ago when some
one inside the building sprayed a
demonstration outside with automatic
weapons fire, killing a 25-year-old
British policewoman on guard.
Asked why it would take the 20 to 30
Libyans so long to leave the embassy,
which the Libyan government calls the

Libyan People's Bureau, the spokesman,
who did not identify himself, said.
"Because they had some things to do —
packing and everything. OK?" lie said
arrangements were being made for a
Libyan airliner to fly them from Britain
on Sunday afternoon, just hours before
the Sunday midnight deadline set by the
British government for all Libyan
diplomats and all other Libyans inside
the embassy to leave the country .
Although the spokesman's statements
indicated that there would be no contin
ued defiance of the British, government
officials here told journalists that the
British government had received no offi
cial word from the Libyan government
on when the embassy would be
evacuated.
Moreover, in Libya, government radio
and television broadcasts announced that
the Libyans inside the embassy here had

sent a message to Libya's leader. Col
Moammar Khadafy. in rripoli. saying.
"We pledge to you the defense of our
principles until we realize them or die in
the process. It was assumed in London,
however, that this kind ot bluster was
only for I ibyan domestic consumption.
It the Libyans do refuse to leave the
embassy bv Sunday midnight, police
might then move against the building,
since it presumably would no longer have
diplomatic immunity. "II they don t
come out." John Keyte. a police superin
tendent. told British television, "the
police will have to go in and take them
out by force."
In its first official act in the matter
since it broke relations with Libya on
Sunday, the British government yester
day expelled a 26-year-old Libyan stu
dent who was believed to have played a
significant role in running the embassv.

He was identified as Saleh Ibrahim
Mahruk. who police said was a member
of .i self-styled Revolutionary Commit
tee of tour students who had taken over
the running of the embassy from regular
diplomats in February.
It was not known if Mabruk. who was
arrested Saturday, was inside the em
bassy at the time of the shooting.
A good deal ot frustration was
reflected in the British press over the
realization that the break in diplomatic
relations and the expulsion from Britain
of all those inside the building means
that British police will probably escort
the killer ot the policewoman to
freedom. The popular Daily Mirror, for
example, told its readers. " The trigger
happy Libyan gunman who savagely
murdered policegirl Yvonne Fletcher is
to go free."
