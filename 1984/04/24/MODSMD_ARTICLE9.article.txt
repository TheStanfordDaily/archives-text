# Nicaraguan rebels' supplies to last to June

From The Washington Post
legucigalpa, Honduras - Paramilitary forces attack
ing the Nicaraguan government have enough supplies
to continue guerrilla warfare into the summer even
without more funding from Congress, their leaders say.
But a congressional cutoff or serious reduction would
create a pinch beginning in June, probably forcing a
cutback in the scale and number of rebel operations
against the Marxist-oriented Sandinista leadership in
Managua, they add.
Leaders of the main guerrilla group, the Nicaraguan
Democratic Force, expressed confidence in interviews
here that Congress eventually will approve more funds
for their two-year-old campaign.
But they anticipated that the debate in Washington
may mean reduced financing, delays and new restric
tions on the level of participation by CIA employees.
"We are very confident they will not cut the aid off
completely," said Edgar Chamorro, a member of the

group's National Directorate and Military-Civil Com
mand. "But they may condition it.' as they do tor El Sal
vador."
The risk of a fund cutoff over a political dispute in
Washington has dramatized for rebel leaders the
predicament they are in.
What for them is a struggle to overthrow the Sandi
nistas and set up a new government in Nicaragua, in
volving life-and-death commitment, is for the Reagan
administration a harassment policy linked to broader
Central American concerns, and subject to fluctuation
according to the political atmosphere in Washington or
relations between Congress and the White House.
"That may be. I don't know," Chamorro said. "But
our people who are fighting are patriots. They may be
pawns of the (United) States. But they are fighting be
cause they are patriots."
Viewed from Tegucigalpa, where the Nicaraguan
Democratic Force is headquartered, the Washington

debate over CIA and rebel goals thus loses some of its
meaning.
For the Nicaraguans attacking government forces
inside Nicaragua, the goal is to topple the Sandinistas
for what the rebels regard as the fate of their country,
their leaders declared, although lack of money and
means may prevent them from doing so.
A second rebel group, the Revolutionary Democratic
Alliance, is based in Costa Rica and is also believed to
receive covert U.S. funds.
The Reagan administration has stated its goal in
aiding the rebels is only to disrupt arms traffic to Sal
vadoran rebels and pressure Managua to adopt policies
more acceptable to Washington.
But guerrilla leaders said this would be unconvincing
for Nicaraguans asked to risk their lives for months
long stretches of hiding in the rugged hills and ambush
ing Sandinista troops.
