# How safe are we if big quake hits here?

While some buildings at Stanford
are very earthquake-resistant, other
structures would probably suffer ex
tensive damage in a moderate-to
strong earthquake, according to seis
mic experts here.
Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh
Shah said University buildings are
"very good" in general, but he added
that there are some dormitories and
labs, particularly the older ones, that
are not very earthquake-resistant.
Shah declined to name specific
facilities, saying he did not wish to
worry students and staff that lived and
worked in the buildings.
Although it is possible to construct
earthquake-resistant buildings, Shah
said, an earthquake-proof building is
an impossibility. "If the same
earthquake (yesterday's) were cen
tered under the Quad, you would have
a lot of trouble and damage," he said.
Dean of Earth Sciences Allan Cox
concurred. "All buildings in this area
are designed to withstand damage, yet
when earthquakes happen, damage
occurs," he said.
According to Shah and Cox, a vari
ety of factors determine the
earthquake resistance of a given build
ing. While newer buildings are gener
ally more earthquake-resistant than
older buildings because of more strin
gent construction guidelines. Shah
pointed out that the structural design
is an important consideration.
Terman Engineering Center and
Mitchell Earth Sciences Building are
examples of the importance of struc
tural design in determining safety.
Terman was built only six or seven
years ago, while Mitchell is 10 years
old. But according to Shah, Mitchell is
more earthquake-resistant.
This peculiarity occurs because Ter
man is a composite structure, in terms
of both materials and design, while
Mitchell is a very symmetrical and
simple building. Terman is very
"complex" while Mitchell is "a box,"
Shah said.
While people inside Mitchell would
tic very safe, however, those under the
overhang would not. Shah said the
overhang is constructed of large con
crete blocks that are likely to fall in
the event of a major quake.
According to Cox. building material
and underlying soil composition are
also important in determining building
stability. Cox said wooden structures
are more earthquake-resistant than
brick ones, and buildings with founda
tions :n soil and landfill are more un
stable than those based on bedrock.
Shah, with Civil Engineering Prof.
James Gere, is co-direCtor of the
Klume Earthquake Engineering Cen
ter. which studies the effects of
earthquakes on buildings and
determines how to design earthquake
resistant structures.
The pair have written a pamphlet
entitled "Earthquakes: How to
Protect Your Life and Property." The
booklet gi\es advice for behavior
before, during and after an
earthquake. Some suggestions for
' during" include:
• Remain calm.
• If indoors, move to a safe place; i.e.
under a desk or a table or in a door
way.
• Unless you're in an unreinforced
building (e.g. brick), stay indoors.
• Do not run for elevators or stair
wells: they are likely to be jammed.
• If outdoors, stay away from power
line;> and buildings.
• Be wary of aftershocks.
The University, according to Shah,
has been in a process of strengthening
and reinforcing vulnerable buildings
since 1960. The program will probably
take another 10 to 15 years before
completion. Shah said.
Shall noted that the process is ex
tremely expensive because the Uni
versity attempts to retain the original
architectural style.
"Rather than demolishing the
building and replacing it.the Univer
sity takes apart the original structure
stone by stone and rebuilds it,'" he
said.
