# How safe are we if big quake hits here?

While some buildings at Stanford
are very earthquake-resistant, other
structures would probably suffer ex
tensive damage in a moderate-to
strong earthquake, according to seis
mic experts here.
Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh
Shah said University buildings are
"very good" in general, but he added
that there are some dormitories and
labs, particularly the older ones, that
are not very earthquake-resistant.
Shah declined to name specific
facilities, saying he did not wish to
worry students and staff that lived and
worked in the buildings.
Although it is possible to construct
earthquake-resistant buildings, Shah
said, an earthquake-proof building is
an impossibility. "If the same
earthquake (yesterday's) were cen
tered under the Quad, you would have
a lot of trouble and damage," he said.
Dean of Earth Sciences Allan Cox
concurred. "All buildings in this area
are designed to withstand damage, yet
when earthquakes happen, damage
occurs," he said.
According to Shah and Cox, a vari
ety of factors determine the
earthquake resistance of a given build
ing. While newer buildings are gener
ally more earthquake-resistant than
older buildings because of more strin
gent construction guidelines. Shah
pointed out that the structural design
is an important consideration.
Terman Engineering Center and
Mitchell Earth Sciences Building are
examples of the importance of struc
tural design in determining safety.
Terman was built only six or seven
years ago, while Mitchell is 10 years
old. But according to Shah, Mitchell is
more earthquake-resistant.
This peculiarity occurs because Ter
man is a composite structure, in terms
of both materials and design, while
Mitchell is a very symmetrical and
simple building. Terman is very
"complex" while Mitchell is "a box,"
Shah said.
