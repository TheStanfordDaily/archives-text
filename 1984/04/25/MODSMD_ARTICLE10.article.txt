# Soviets ready to consider new arms ideas
## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Moscow — Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko
was quoted yesterday as telling visiting Italian Foreign
Minister Giulio Andreotti that Moscow was prepared
to consider "new ideas" that could break the current
impasse in nuclear arms negotiations.
But Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, in a speech
at a luncheon for Andreotti, warned that the deploy
ment last year of NATO nuclear missiles in Italy could
lead to a disaster worse than the destruction of Pompeii
in 79 A.D.
Gromyko told the visiting Italians: "People remem
ber the disaster at Pompeii which was turned to ashes
by a volcano. .. . And how many Vesuviuses does one
thermonuclear bomb contain?" Members of the Italian
delegation said they considered Gromyko's choice of
words when referring to Italy fairly harsh. The text of
Gromyko's speech was carried by the official news
agency Tass.
Speaking to journalists after his one-hour meeting
with Chernenko, Andreotti said it was premature to
make public the "new ideas" Chernenko had men

tioned but left the impression that he had discussed
them with the Soviet leader.
Andreotti's two-day official visit here, the first by a
senior NATO official since Chernenko took power, ap
peared to have produced no significant breakthrough.
Perhaps the only notable aspect of the published ac
count of Andreotti's meeting with Chernenko and
Gromyko was that the Soviet officials did not reiterate
Moscow's earlier insistence that nuclear arms talks
could be resumed only if the .West shows willingness to
remove new American medium-range missiles
deployed in Western Europe over the past five months.
Last year Moscow broke off talks on limiting both
strategic and medium-range nuclear weapons to protest
the deployment of U.S.-made medium-range nuclear
missiles in Western Europe.
Andreotti's visit here is to be followed by similar
trips to Moscow by West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher and British Foreign Secretary
Geoffrey Howe. The visits appear to reflect Moscow's
renewed flirting with the three countries that have ac
cepted the Pershing 2 and cruise missiles.

Gromyko coupled a relatively soft reference to the
need for removing "obstacles" to the resumption (if
strategic and medium-range nuclear arms talks with
sharp criticism of Italy's policies.
Diplomatic observers here said the Soviets seem to
be encouraged by renewed anti-war protests in West
ern Europe during the Easter holidays. The goal of So
viet policy appears to be designed to reinforce
European fears that the new U.S. missiles are increas
ing the likelihood of a nuclear conflict.
Gromyko in his public remarks sought to underscore
this point by arguing that Europe — including Italy —
is far less secure today than before the deployment of
the U.S. missiles. As one diplomat put it, Moscow sees
the NATO deployment as possibly having painful and
lasting adverse consequences on the Western alliance.
The fact that Moscow was not able to halt the
deployments was a serious setback for Moscow, the
diplomat said.
"But the Russians have lost a battle but not the war,"
he added.
