## Nicaraguan impressions: one student's view Trekking through a country torn by an endless war 
### CHRISTOPHER HEDRICK 
Stanford senior Christopher Hedrick
spent two weeks traveling about
Nicaragua during spring break. The
following is a written and pictorial ac
count of the trip. Currently majoring in
political science, Hedrick will attend
Oxford University next year on a
Rhodes Scholarship.

One striking feature about
Nicaragua is the nation's tremendous
youth — about half the population is
under 16.
The very young seem particularly
prevalent in the military. Though the
minimum age for enlistment is
supposed to be 16, many soldiers ap
pear younger. I met one boy named
Lucas who had become, at age 13, a
hero of the revolution. During a battle
against U.S.-backed contras in the
mountains of north-central Nicaragua,
Lucas' father was shot and killed.
Lucas picked up the dead man's rifle
arid shot the soldier who had slain his
father. Still officially underage to
fight, Lucas now works in public rela
tions for the Sandinistas.

The first Nicaraguan I got to know
was a young man named Dayton.
Sporting a Philadelphia Flyers jersey,
he introduced himself in quite good
English as "Dayton. You know, like
Daytona Beach. Where is Daytona
Beach anyway, man?"
Dayton fought in the revolution and
he has the scars to prove it. A good
chunk of his left calf was ripped away
by a bullet fired by one of Somoza's
national guard.
In the United States, a boy used to
be proud to be the first one on his
block to own a bicycle. Now it is a per
sonal computer. Dayton was the first
boy on his block to own a submachine
gun.
He fought and nearly died for the
revolution and he still feels a profound
hatred for Somoza and his supporters,
but he is discontent with the Sandi
nista government. Like others of his
class — his mother owns a small busi
ness — he misses the luxury goods that
were available before the war. Dayton
supports the revolution, but wishes he
could still go window shopping at the
Managua Sears.

Support for the Sandinistas seems to
vary from region to region and be
tween social and economic classes. In
Leon, a university city, support for the
government is very strong. But in the
capital of Managua, there seems to be
a fair amount of discontent. The rural
areas and the small towns are stongly
pro-Sandinista. Small farmers,
peasants and workers generally are
very supportive of the revolution and
the government. Large farmers and
business owners are more critical.
The majority in Nicaragua, those
who have received the advantages of
the tremendous education, health
care, land reform and housing ad

vances of the past five years, are pro-
Sandinista. The minority, those who
have lost their luxuries, have either
left the country or remain in relatively
silent opposition.
Disagreement with the policies of
the Sandinista government, though,
does not translate into support for the
contras. I saw no visible support for
the counter-revolutionary forces.
Most seem to regard them as merely
the remnants of Somoza's brutal na
tional guard.

Public transportation in Nicaragua,
as in most less-developed countries, is
what the guide books call "a real ex
perience." If you think the standing
room-only buses of the capital are fun,
I suggest the train from Leon to
Managua. Few trips can compare with
this three-hour ride in a train designed
to hold 50 — in 100 degree heat, 90
percent humidity, with iOO people and
a score of screeching chicken strug
gling, not always in vain, to free them
selves from their owners' grasp.

On the whole, I felt very welcome in
Nicaragua. Only once was I met with a
call of "Go Home, Yankee!" On that
occasion, I pretended to be German
and walked away.
Generally, though, the Nicaraguan
people were more receptive to me as a
foreigner than those in any other
country I have visited. They seem to
have the remarkable ability to distin
guish between the American people
and the policies that the Reagan ad
ministration has directed against their
nation.
Much of this capability is due, I
believe, to the Americans who visit
and live in Nicaragua. They are
usually quite sympathetic to the revo
lution and to the Nicaraguan people.

One sweltering afternoon in
Managua I visited a state-run center
for the handicapped. That day a group
of young handicapped Nicaraguans
were having a celebration with a band
and dancing.
I was caught up in the good feeling
there until I accidentally bumped into
a man about my age. Sitting in his
wheelchair in his Sandinista army uni
form his head bai*ely came up to my
chest. Looking at his two stumps for
legs it was disturbing to realize that my
tax dollars had gone at least indirectly
to pay for the mutilation of his body.

Even more disquieting was my ex
perience in the village of San Raphael
del Norte. Nestled in the coffee
growing region of mountainous north
central Nicaragua, San Raphael is
strongly identified with the father fig
ure of the revolution, Augusto San
dino. It was there that his wife was
born, that they were married and that
more than 50 years ago he had his
headquarters during his fight against
the U.S. occupation and domination
of his country.

I was in San Raphael March 20 to
watch the funerals of several Sandi
nista militiamen who had been killed
earlier during a contra ambush. The
next morning, while the Sandinista
troops were in the mountains search
ing for the ambushers, U.S.-backed
contra forces, about 400 in number,
mortared the town, destroying several
buildings, including the homes of 12
civilians.
Next the contras descended from
the hills, chanting "we are here in the
name bf Christ to save you from the
communists." Marching past the ca
thedral where Sandino was married,
they attacked the elementary school,
straifing it with bullets and setting fire
to the library's books. After holding
the town for a couple of hours, they
left, taking several hostages, including
children with them.
I returned to San Raphael del Norte
a few days later and spoke with the
parish priest. Enraged by the attacks,
he lashed out, "1 am sick and tired of
burying children and blessing
corpses." To my British companion he
said, "You are also to blame. You En
glish are the fathers and mothers of

those Americans. Why can you not tell
them simply to leave us alone?"
* * *
The Sandinista government does
not claim to be perfect and in fact it is
not. It has been insensitive in dealing
with the Misquito Indians, it has been
inefficient in managing the economy,
it still censors the opposition newspa
per — La Prensa, mail coming into
Nicaragua from America is routinely
opened and examined, and there are
shortages of consumer goods. There is
little indication that opposition parties
will be given free access to the mass
media in the upcoming national elec
tions.
For all these faults, though,
Nicaraguans will ask you to look at
their situation in light of three factors.
First, be reminded that they consider
themselves under seige both economi
cally and militarily. Second, compare
Nicaragua to the other nations of
Central America. Finally, and perhaps
most importantly, compare the
Nicaragua of today to the Nicaragua
under Somoza. For most, there is
indeed no comparison.
