Just about everyone associated with the ASSU
seems pleased with the rather large increase in
voter turnout in last week's elections. Who
wouldn't be with what appears to be evidence of a
rekindled interest in student government on
campus?
We question, however, whether students were
really voting out of concern for University
politics. After a closer inspection, it looks as if
some students were voting for all the wrong
reasons â€” they may have been voting more out of
concern for their pocketbooks than for their
politics.
As this year's election commissioner put it,
"More people probably know now that they need
their voting receipts to get refunds." In other
words, the knowledge that only those who voted
in this spring's election would be eligible for a fee
assessment refund was the impetus for the turn
out of some students at the polls.
It is a morally bankrupt action to cast a ballot
simply in order to receive a refund nearly a year
later. The amount refunded is insubstantial in
comparison to that paid by the average student

for tuition and would have little effect on keeping
a student's checkbook balanced.
We propose two possible solutions to alleviate
the problem of students voting solely for mone
tary gain. The first would simply abolish the
refund system altogether. It seems extremely un
usual for a voting structure to be based on a
revocable taxation policy. One can almost picture
Joe Garagiola hawking the ASSU elections on
local television, "Cast a vote, get a check!"
The other alternative would be to at least end
the requirement that to receive a refund one
needs to produce a receipt from the election.
Refunds could continue and everyone would be
eligible, regardless of whether or not he or she
took the time to vote. Certainly there is a need to
combat apathy in student elections, but forced
voting just doesn't do it.
We commend the student body for expressing
interest in the recent elections and sincerely hope
that they voted out of concern for the future di
rection of student government and student groups
as the elections were intended.
