## Mining Nicaraguan harbors is in our best interests 
### 
Last week the U.S. Congress exploded with
indignation when reports surfaced about ClA
directed mining of Nicaraguan harbors.
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill blustered through a
statement about international law, Ted Ken
nedy ummed and ahhed similar sentiments,
and Daniel Patrick Moynihan threw a temper
tantrum over a lack of adequate briefing from
the administration. As it turns out, these
members of Congress have known about the

VIEWPOINT

mining since at least April 1, some having
been informed as early as Jan. 31. But then
again, it's primary season, and the Democrats
know they can't beat Reagan on domestic is
sues.
The self-serving sermonizing of the
aforementioned politicians is the quintessence
of what Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick
exposed in "Dictatorships and Double Stand
ards," which she wrote in 1979 just after the
Carter administration had pulled the rug out
from under Somoza in Nicaragua. Their
selective fits of conscience are typical of
American liberals who three times in the last
decade have cheered the fall of traditional
autocrats friendly to the United States, while
remaining silent when these governments
were replaced by totalitarian regimes openly
hostile to American interests.
We heard a great deal about human rights
violations in Thieu's Vietnam, the Shah's Iran
and Somoza's Nicaragua, but after these
countries had fallen to our foes, few bothered
to apply American standards any longer.
Granted, the governments we supported were
hardly snow white, but the horror unleashed
by the Communist victory in Vietnam and the
madness of the Ayatollah made Thieu and the
Shah look like knights in shining armor. Ad
mittedly, John Stewart Mill was not one of

Somoza's favorite authors, but while heavy
handed, Somoza never attempted to control
the culture and education of his country. He
had no desire to reorganize Nicaraguan soci
ety along Cuba's totalitarian lines. Most im
portantly, he had no ambitions to dominate
his neighbors.
The Sandinistas do all of these things and
more. They harass the Church, they
"relocate" the Misquito Indians (much like
Stalin "reorganized" the Ukraine), they recog
nize the regime of Kampuchea (Vietnam's
Auschwitz), they travel frequently to Moscow
and they play host to several thousands of
Eastern bloc "advisers." In short, "They have
betrayed the revolution" — this is the view of

Eden Pastora, former Sandinista hero, better
known as Commander Zero, who now com
mands a band of contras fighting in the south.
This is the harsh reality of the Sandinista
regime, but American liberals who once sym
pathized with that revolution lack the courage
of Commander Zero to admit that the revolu
tion has gone sour. And now, faced with a
golden opportunity for redemption, they seem

on the verge of committing the same mistake
all over again.
Currently in El Salvador, Nicaraguan
backed rebels are waging a guerrilla (this
is a violation of international law), destroying
the infrastructure and economy, spreading
famine and misery. At the same time, the CIA
has been assisting Nicaraguan freedom
fighters in their struggle against the Marxist
Sandinista regime. The Reagan administra
tion's strategy is to pressure the Sandinistas to
discontinue destabilizing the government of
El Salvador because El Salvador is our ally,
whereas Nicaragua is allied with Cuba and the
Soviet Union, who, incidentally, are not our
allies.

In other words, we are mining Nicaragua's
harbors to dissuade the Sandinistas from un
dermining the government of El Salvador. But
suddenly last week, three of the most power
ful Democrats in Congress were overcome
with piety, preaching in high tones about in
ternational law and morality. Cries of
"another Vietnam!" resounded in the
hallowed chambers of our Capitol.

The invocation of Vietnam raises an inter
esting point, for as time goes by and truth
seeps out, the "lesson of Vietnam" seems to
be changing 180 degrees. The Reagan ad
minstration goes to great lengths to demon
strate the difference between the two con
flicts, but as Norman Podheretz explains in
the April edition of Commentary, the presi
dent's strongest case can be made by laying
bare the reality of Vietnam and demonstrating
the similarities of the situations.
For example, in both cases there exists the
myth of the indigenous struggle — the roman
tic notion of a poorly armed, exploited
peasant class overthrowing a corrupt regime
allied to the United States. But the facts
brought to light since the communist conquest
have shattered the illusion. As Podhoretz
points out, the North Vietnamese have by
now "admitted that they had indeed created
and directed the National Liberation Front
(NLF) in the south." Instead of pitchforks and
slingshots, the guerrillas had AK-47s and
RPGs. Nevertheless, in El Salvador the myth
lives on, despite overwhelming evidence of
external communist support of the Soviet-
Cuban-Nicaraguan variety.
In both cases there is the myth of achieving
a negotiated settlement. Again and again we
hear that it is the United States who opposes
negotiations. Which is true — we won't
negotiate with people who seek power out of
the barrel of a gun instead of through the bal
lot box. The instructive parallel in Vietnam is
that they now openly admit that they had no
intention of negotiating. Total victory was
their objective. Podhoretz notes that after the
American withdrawal and collapse of the
south, the North "refused to allow even their
communist allies, let alone the non
communists in the NLF to share in the power
for which they had fought." Still there are
those who want to negotiate with the rebels in
El Salvador.

Finally, in both cases we face the option of
an authoritarian government friendly to the
United States versus a communist government
sympathetic to the Soviets. Can America ab
sorb another exodus on the scale of the boat
people?
In retrospect, it is crystal clear that the les
son of Vietnam is not that we were on the
wrong side of history — for the communist
victory was by no means inevitable — but
rather that the American government failed to
make its case to the public. Not wanting to
alarm the nation, the government never ex
plained what was at stake. Eventually,
America lost her nerve.
The same situation confronts us today in
Central America, although the stakes are a lot
higher. As Richard Nixon pointed out a year
ago in a piece entitled, "Don't Let El Salvador
Become Another Vietnam," the issue is
simple: Will we allow El Salvador to become
another Soviet base in Central America? If we
do, "it will be because Castro, Khadafi, the
Soviets and the Sandinistas were willing to do
more for the communist guerrillas than we
were willing to do for the anti-communist gov
ernment," as Nixon said.
If we can't stand by our allies in times of ad
versity — if every time the going gets tough,
we pack up and run — we are soon going to
find that we don't have any friends left in this
very hostile world. The price of freedom is
precious indeed, and defending our liberties
cannot be entrusted to summer soldiers and
sunshine patriots. The struggles we must
endure to preserve our way of life are certain
to last more than 18 months. In fact, the
struggle is never over, unless, of course, we
capitulate.
Considering what is at stake, laying a few
mines in Nicaragua's ports was the least we
could do.
