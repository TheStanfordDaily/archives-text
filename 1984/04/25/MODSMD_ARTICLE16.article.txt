# Learning not to grow up
## 
### 
On Easter Sunday, a friend of mine asked me if 1
was going on the dorm Easter egg hunt. I barely
managed to avoid guffawing in his face. I quickly
mumbled "Naah, gotta study" and ran to my
room, turned up the already howling stereo and
busted up laughing. Come on. Even though I'm 22
years old wishing I was 12 again and often acting
like it, I'm 22! I'm an adult now. 1 mean, what
adult runs around the courtyard with a silly little
basket in hand, rooting about the recycling bins,
and prodding suspicious looking bushes and con
spicuous clumps of grass, looking for some stupid
painted eggs? Geez, just go into Food Service if
you want eggs for brunch. No need for the big pro
duction.
And. to boot, I never liked Easter egg hunts. I
wasn't good at Easter egg hunts when I was a
kid. 1 was kinda slow and lazy and never found
many eggs. I'd look in the refrigerator or under the
table or I'd check to see if my dad had taped some
to the ceiling. By the time I was done doing all this,
my brothers had found them all. So I was reduced
to finding egg-shaped rocks and trying to pass
them off as eggs. I didn't have much fun.
And besides, in the time I would have wasted
looking for fancied-up chicken embryos, I could
have read the Wall Street Journal and found out
about what is really important in life..
And so I convinced myself that the Easter egg
hunt was actually just a plot cooked up by the
dorm council to see who would be foolish enough
to show up for a childish little game. Upon
people's arrival at the meeting place, the council
no doubt would write down names, give out the
nice egg baskets, take a big group picture then
laugh in everybody's faces and leave. Later, they'd
probably send the list of names to the CIA. and
tack the picture up on the bulletin board for the
dorm's enjoyment. Hah. I was one fish they didn't
catch. Besides, it was just a childish little game and
I didn't want to play. Right?
But something just wasn't sitting well with me. I
wasn't laughing anymore. I started thinking and
found that I had confused the word "childish" with
the word "childlike." I knew what childish meant.
I was always pretty childish, I was good at that:
"Maaaahhhmm, can I have a glass of water? .. .
But I don't want to get it myself. You get it for me.

OK? . . . Howcum no? Get it for me or I'll start
whining! Mom? Mom! ... No Mom, put the slip
per away! Pleezz Mom!" Or: "Daaad, I want a 10-
speed bike, a Tonka truck, some Lincoln Logs and
a trip to Nepal for Christmas .... I know it's only
April, Daddy, but I want to tell you now so you
don't forget.... Whaddaya mean I'll be lucky if I
get a trip around the block and a kick in the pants?
If I don't get what I want for Christmas, I'll throw
myself in front of a big bus, and then you'll have to
pay the hospital bills, and then you'll be sorry!
You'll miss me! I'll show you!"
But 1 got over being childish a long time ago. I
mean, the last stunt I pulled was when I asked Dad
for all that stuff for Christmas, and I was 19 then.
It's been a long time. But I wasn't sure what
"childlike" meant.
So I did some reading in a book called "Growing
Young" by Ashley Montagu. Paraphrasing him,
being childlike means having the abilities and en-

trying to get a job. Unfortun
ately, putting "I play tic-tac
toe" on a resume will not be
incredibly impressive.

ergy to explore, to play, to be curious, to learn, to
delight in simple things, to love and be loved. A
scientific field of study exists in this area of
"growing young," and it is called neoteny or
paedomorphism. Why "grow up" and learn to lose
those characteristics, Montagu asks. Why not grow
young and have a good time with life?
I gotta figure that Montagu is right. We all know
it to be true, intuitively. Why else do we fear get
ting old so much? We've all heard the mundane
phrase "you're as young as you feel." But we all
thought that the only people who believed that one
were either in therapy, didn't get enough oxygen at
birth or were about to turn 40. Well maybe these
people were right.

Doesn't it sound great to be able to learn, love,
play and wonder for the rest of our lives? And yet,
don't you feel like you're being socialized into be
coming a cold, old and machine-like adult who has
learned to repress emotions, feelings and intui
tion? If you don't, I'd like to meet you and pop
your bubble. No, actually, I'd really like to meet
you in the hopes that some of your attitude rubs off
on me.
It's not just me with this problem. I see a lot of
people around me who are old beyond their years
— who have grown up too fast — and they're not
happy at all. I see adults around me who somehow
believe that mining harbors and attacking islands
the size of Redwood City is good for America and
the safety of the Free World. I see other adults
who, having lost the ability to play for hours in the
box the bike came in, need bigger and more com
plex toys like PCP or portable stereos complete
with turntable, receiver, tape deck, synthesizer and
refrigerator/freezer. And if it's not one thing, it's
another. It's a boat, or a new car, or a VCR or a
video camera. If »it's not cocaine, it's freebasing
cocaine. Why must we lose the wonderful ability to
always be at play? Sometimes we're working so
hard to be able to play that we lose sight of the
playing.
Sure, it's kinda hard to play during a midterm or
when trying to get a job. Unfortunately, putting "I
play tic-tac-toe" on a resume will not be incredibly
impressive. But there are limitations we choose to
have and those that we don't. Wearing a blue
polyester three-piece suit during the day doesn't
necessarily mean that we need to sell out totally. It
might be easier, but it's not necessary. And accor
ding to the science of neoteny, we aren't meant to
sell our childlike traits and development as caring
humans down the river.
Armed with these fresh insights, I was all set to
answer The Question most often asked seniors. Fi
nally. my chance came. A friend of mine asked.
"What do you want to be when you graduate?" "A
kid," I answered, very pleased with myself. "Oh. I
could never be a kid again," she replied.
It was the most depressing thing I think I've ever
heard.
