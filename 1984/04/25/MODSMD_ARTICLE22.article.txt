Northwestern freshman Jeff Hagan would
be the envy of every Stanford student, at
least for this week. Hagan was lucky enough
to draw No. I in the undergraduate housing
lottery.
Within half an hour of his triumph, he was
passing out beers and celebrating riotously
in his room, trying to decide where he wants
to live next year.
When asked by The Daily Northwestern
what his secret was, he said "I cheated." He

added with a sly grin, "You get these little
cards with your number on it, and 1 had one
in my palm. Of course I got number one.
They fell for it hook, line and sinker."
Kidding aside, Hagan said he felt confi
dent that luck was on his side as he trudged
through the April snow to (he the "fateful
fishbowl of potentially lousy housing assign
ments."
The student who drew 7000 (the equiva
lent of Stanford's dreaded 5000) was for
tunately already guaranteed a space in a
dorm due to his status as a dorm officer.
While both students continued to
celebrate with friends, a crowd of NU stu
dents waited nervously in line, hoping for
No. 2.
The Trojan has Hart
Out of 2M voters polled at the University
of Southern California, Gary Hart received
102 votes, Ronald Reagan received 80 votes
and Jesse Jackson placed third with 16 votes.
Walter Mondale received only 12 votes.
Mike Martinez, president of the Under
graduate Political Science Association, told
The Daily Trojan, "It's very surprising that
Gary Hart won on this traditionally conser
vative campus. This shows that students are
interested in voting how their conscience
feels."
However, UPSA finance chairman Mark
Decker may have been more realistic when
he said, "Hart is for young, upwardly mobile
professionals, and USC is known for that."
Hart received more than half of his votes
from women. Hart's stance on foreign af
fairs, the military, women's rights and his
charismatic appeal were among the factors
that encouraged women to support him.
Another interesting aspect of the survey

was that one-third of the Republicans voted
for Hart. Hart received 23 votes to Reagan's
70.
The poll coincided with a voter registra
tion drive that Decker and Martinez called
"a huge success." Although the poll may
have been affected by the fact that many
Republicans were already registered to vote
and could not participate in the poll. Decker
said the poll may indicate that the university
does not deserve the label of being a conser
vative campus.
Looking for the day after
According to The Daily Texan, among the
825 students who were polled by U.S. News
and World Report 29.1 percent said they ex
pected a nuclear war in their lifetime. 36.3
percent said they did not. and 34.6 percent
said they were unsure.
However, 75.2 percent of the students
said they have not changed their lifestyles
despite their worries about nuclear war. One
student stated. "If a nuclear war is going to
occur, there is nothing I can do. 1 can't live
my life being frightened all the time."
When asked what country is "most likely"
to begin a nuclear war, 47.6 percent of those
polled named the Soviet Union, while only
7.7 percent named the United States.

While 21.7 percent of the students felt a
nuclear war could be limited in scope, 58.2
percent felt the damage to the United States
in a full-scale nuclear war would be
"virtually total destruction.'" The other 35.1
percent thought there would be "enormous
destruction but survival of perhaps half the
population."
Most students were angry at both super
powers for not settling their disputes and
starting to disarm. The vast majority of those
polled — 76.3 percent — blamed both the
United States and the Soviet Union for con
tinuing the arms race. A total of 52.8 per
cent of the students favored an immediate,
bilateral nuclear freeze, while almost 20 per
cent advocated an unconditional U.S. freeze.

It's all in the name
Prior to UC-Berkeley's ASUC elections,
Hie Daily Californian reported that barely
one-third of the students knew the name o!
the current ASUC president or planned to
vote in the upcoming campus elections.
ASUC President Cathy Campbell said she
was indeed surprised by the results ot the
name-recognition question. "It's more than
I'd expect." Campbell said. "In a sense, it's a
sign of how many students follow the
ASUC."
A considerably higher percentage of wo
men — 47 percent — knew Campbell's
name. Campbell commented that her work
on women's issues might he responsible for
the fact that women were twice as likely to
know her name. She added that "for some
women on campus, having a woman presi
dent means something. I think there may be
more progressive women on campus than
progressive men."
The lack of interest in student government
was significantly less evident among first
year students. Forty percent were able to
name the ASUC president. An overwhelm
ing 74 percent of first-year students said
they plan to vote in the spring elections,
compared to the 45 percent total ol all un
dergraduates.
These percentages were significantly
higher than the 15 percent of registered stu
dents who usually vote in ASUC elections.
Overall, 90 percent of students polled
were unable to name any of the candidates
for next year's ASUC presidency. However,
the survey was conducted just before the
candidates were allowed to begin campaign
ing and litter the campus with campaign
posters.
Well be home early, mom
If you thought you had outgrown curfews,
think again. The University of Pennsylvania
may implement a policy that would require
that all student functions be monitored to
end at 3 a.m. The policy also stipulates that
one University official be present for every
250 students attending an event, functions
must be registered at least two weeks in ad
vance, and music and other noise must be
kept to a reasonable level.
Drafts of the policy have now been dis
tributed to several student groups who are in
the process of formulating responses. Accor
ding to the Daily Pennsylvanian, the reac
tion appears to be mixed.
Associate Director of Student Life Jac
queline Wade said that some students have
already responded positively to the policy.
"Everyone agrees that there should be some
sort of policy," she said. "Students say the
policy makes sense."
But Wade added that several students
have complained about it, particularly stu

dents in fraternities and sororities. Some stu
dents feel the policy is reasonable lor public
buildings but not for private houses.
Interfraternity Council President Bob
Kramer believed that "the language ot the
policy doesn't seem to relate to fraternities.
For example, the policy mentions facilities
supervisors monitoring functions, and we
don't have any facilities supervisors."
Undergraduate Assembly Chairman Ken
Meyers objected to the monitoring require
ment of the policy. "We believe that any
type of university official acting as a guard is
not only an infringement of our rights but
also will hamper the party atmosphere."
He added that the assembly objected to
the 3 a.m. curfew. "We don't feel students
should be given a bedtime by the University.
When we want to end our parties, we'll end
our parties."

"a huge success." Although the poll may
have been affected by the fact that many
Republicans were already registered to vote
and could not participate in the poll. Decker
said the poll may indicate that the university
does not deserve the label of being a conser
vative campus.
Looking for the day after
According to The Daily Texan, among the
825 students who were polled by U.S. News
and World Report 29.1 percent said they ex
pected a nuclear war in their lifetime. 36.3
percent said they did not. and 34.6 percent
said they were unsure.
However, 75.2 percent of the students
said they have not changed their lifestyles
despite their worries about nuclear war. One
student stated. "If a nuclear war is going to
occur, there is nothing I can do. 1 can't live
my life being frightened all the time."
When asked what country is "most likely"
to begin a nuclear war, 47.6 percent of those
polled named the Soviet Union, while only
7.7 percent named the United States.

While 21.7 percent of the students felt a
nuclear war could be limited in scope, 58.2
percent felt the damage to the United States
in a full-scale nuclear war would be
"virtually total destruction.'" The other 35.1
percent thought there would be "enormous
destruction but survival of perhaps half the
population."
Most students were angry at both super
powers for not settling their disputes and
starting to disarm. The vast majority of those
polled — 76.3 percent — blamed both the
United States and the Soviet Union for con
tinuing the arms race. A total of 52.8 per
cent of the students favored an immediate,
bilateral nuclear freeze, while almost 20 per
cent advocated an unconditional U.S. freeze.

It's all in the name
Prior to UC-Berkeley's ASUC elections,
Hie Daily Californian reported that barely
one-third of the students knew the name o!
the current ASUC president or planned to
vote in the upcoming campus elections.
ASUC President Cathy Campbell said she
was indeed surprised by the results ot the
name-recognition question. "It's more than
I'd expect." Campbell said. "In a sense, it's a
sign of how many students follow the
ASUC."
A considerably higher percentage of wo
men — 47 percent — knew Campbell's
name. Campbell commented that her work
on women's issues might he responsible for
the fact that women were twice as likely to
know her name. She added that "for some
women on campus, having a woman presi
dent means something. I think there may be
more progressive women on campus than
progressive men."
The lack of interest in student government
was significantly less evident among first
year students. Forty percent were able to
name the ASUC president. An overwhelm
ing 74 percent of first-year students said
they plan to vote in the spring elections,
compared to the 45 percent total ol all un
dergraduates.
These percentages were significantly
higher than the 15 percent of registered stu
dents who usually vote in ASUC elections.
Overall, 90 percent of students polled
were unable to name any of the candidates
for next year's ASUC presidency. However,
the survey was conducted just before the
candidates were allowed to begin campaign
ing and litter the campus with campaign
posters.
Well be home early, mom
If you thought you had outgrown curfews,
think again. The University of Pennsylvania
may implement a policy that would require
that all student functions be monitored to
end at 3 a.m. The policy also stipulates that
one University official be present for every
250 students attending an event, functions
must be registered at least two weeks in ad
vance, and music and other noise must be
kept to a reasonable level.
Drafts of the policy have now been dis
tributed to several student groups who are in
the process of formulating responses. Accor
ding to the Daily Pennsylvanian, the reac
tion appears to be mixed.
Associate Director of Student Life Jac
queline Wade said that some students have
already responded positively to the policy.
"Everyone agrees that there should be some
sort of policy," she said. "Students say the
policy makes sense."
But Wade added that several students
have complained about it, particularly stu

dents in fraternities and sororities. Some stu
dents feel the policy is reasonable lor public
buildings but not for private houses.
Interfraternity Council President Bob
Kramer believed that "the language ot the
policy doesn't seem to relate to fraternities.
For example, the policy mentions facilities
supervisors monitoring functions, and we
don't have any facilities supervisors."
Undergraduate Assembly Chairman Ken
Meyers objected to the monitoring require
ment of the policy. "We believe that any
type of university official acting as a guard is
not only an infringement of our rights but
also will hamper the party atmosphere."
He added that the assembly objected to
the 3 a.m. curfew. "We don't feel students
should be given a bedtime by the University.
When we want to end our parties, we'll end
our parties."



Draw, partner
Northwestern freshman Jeff Hagan would
be the envy of every Stanford student, at
least for this week. Hagan was lucky enough
to draw No. I in the undergraduate housing
lottery.
Within half an hour of his triumph, he was
passing out beers and celebrating riotously
in his room, trying to decide where he wants
to live next year.
When asked by The Daily Northwestern
what his secret was, he said "I cheated." He

added with a sly grin, "You get these little
cards with your number on it, and 1 had one
in my palm. Of course I got number one.
They fell for it hook, line and sinker."
Kidding aside, Hagan said he felt confi
dent that luck was on his side as he trudged
through the April snow to (he the "fateful
fishbowl of potentially lousy housing assign
ments."
The student who drew 7000 (the equiva
lent of Stanford's dreaded 5000) was for
tunately already guaranteed a space in a
dorm due to his status as a dorm officer.
While both students continued to
celebrate with friends, a crowd of NU stu
dents waited nervously in line, hoping for
No. 2.
The Trojan has Hart
Out of 2M voters polled at the University
of Southern California, Gary Hart received
102 votes, Ronald Reagan received 80 votes
and Jesse Jackson placed third with 16 votes.
Walter Mondale received only 12 votes.
Mike Martinez, president of the Under
graduate Political Science Association, told
The Daily Trojan, "It's very surprising that
Gary Hart won on this traditionally conser
vative campus. This shows that students are
interested in voting how their conscience
feels."
However, UPSA finance chairman Mark
Decker may have been more realistic when
he said, "Hart is for young, upwardly mobile
professionals, and USC is known for that."
Hart received more than half of his votes
from women. Hart's stance on foreign af
fairs, the military, women's rights and his
charismatic appeal were among the factors
that encouraged women to support him.
Another interesting aspect of the survey

was that one-third of the Republicans voted
for Hart. Hart received 23 votes to Reagan's
70.
The poll coincided with a voter registra
tion drive that Decker and Martinez called
"a huge success." Although the poll may
