## Bulldogs bark and bite at Card 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sports writer 
The Stanford baseball team had a chance to
tune up for this week's pivotal Pacific-10 se
ries with USC in a non-league contest at
Fresno State Monday night. Maybe it was the
long bus ride, or maybe the Card was looking
ahead to USC, but whatever the reason, the
result was a lackluster 2-1 loss to the N0.6
Bulldogs.
Fresno State, 3-2 winners over Stanford
earlier this year in Palo Alto and the victors in
30 of its last 35 games, lived up to its national
ranking by stifling the Cardinal on just four
hits. The win lifted the Northern California
Baseball Association leader's record to 38-
10-2 and gave reliever Eric Solberg his sixth
win without a loss.
Solberg was one of five Bulldog hurlers who
combined to strike out 15 Cardinal on the
evening and hold Stanford scoreless until the
top of the ninth inning. The entire Cardinal
offense consisted of two singles by Darryl
Stephens, stretching his hitting streak to 13
games, and singles from both Pete Stanicek
and Mark Davis.
In fairness, the Stanford pitchers Steve Cot
trell, Rob Wassenaar and Doug Gwaltney
turned in a pretty fair performance of their
own, scattering 10 hits and fanning seven bat
ters. But the Bulldogs nicked Wassenaar for a
run in the fifth on a walk and two singles, just
enough for the freshman to get the loss and
even his record at 1-1.
A single by catcher Craig Wiley and an run
scoring double by Ed Jacobo in the home half
of the seventh gave Fresno State a 2-0 lead
before the Card mounted a last gasp rally in
the ninth.
Walt Harris, John Vfcrducci and Toi Cook
were all issued free passes to load the bases
with one out in the inning. Jeff Ballard
stepped up with a chance to repeat his recent
heroics, but managed only a sharp grounder to
third that scored a run when third sacker Bob
Bafia booted the ball for an error.
That was it, as neither Greg Lorenzetti nor

Pete Stanicek could tie the ballgame leaving
Stanford to return home with a 30-20-1
record.
The Cardinal must regroup before hosting
USC for a three-game series beginning
Friday. The series could go a long way toward

deciding the fate of both teams' post-season
playoff aspirations. The Trojans, who
dropped five places to No. 7 in the most
recent national rankings, are currently in
second place in the Pac-10 Southern Division
race, one game ahead of Stanford.


Senior Darryl Stephens and his team could not run fast enough to catch the Bulldogs
on the loose. Fresno overtook the Cardinal 2-1 on Monday night.
