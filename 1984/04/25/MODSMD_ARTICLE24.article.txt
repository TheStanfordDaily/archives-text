## U.S. meets with Soviets in Switzerland 
### 
Lausanne, Switzerland (AP) â€”
Top U.S. and Soviet Olympic or
ganizers were meeting today with
the International Olympic Com
mittee to discuss Soviet criticisms
of arrangements for the Los An
geles Games.
The meeting was called by lOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch
after repeated harsh Soviet
criticism of the United States.
"I'm optimistic, but then I have

to be," Samaranch said before the
meeting. Neither he nor other lOC
officials would comment further.
The Soviet charges range from
alleged U.S. violations of the
Olympic charter, to complaints
about smog, crime, commercializa
tion and possible "anti-Soviet"
demonstrations.
Peter Ueberroth, president of
the Los Angeles Olympic Organiz
ing Committee, has said the

LAOOC will not "kow-tow" to the
Soviets, but that he welcomes the
chance to "sit' down and qualify
misunderstandings or misconcep
tions that exist."
Marat Gramov, president of the
U.S.S.R.'s Olympic committee, has
aired many of the Soviet charges in
the past week, but refused to dis
cuss them further Monday night.
"The comments will come after
meeting," Gramov said.

In press commentaries and con
ferences for foreign journalists, the
Soviets have charged U.S. govern
ment officials violated the Olympic
charter in procedures for admitting
Soviet athletes to the Games; that
Soviet athletes are threatened with
kidnappings by an anti-Soviet
group; that President Reagan is
using the games for election-year
politics; and that Los Angeles has
too much smog, is too dangerous
and too expensive and the Games
are over-commercialized.
Gramov has denied, however,
that the Soviet campaign is to
i...* i.

avenge the U.S.-led boycott of the
Moscow Olympics in 1980 that
protested the Soviet invasion of
Afganistan and kept athletes from
some 60 nations away from the
Games.
The Soviets have concentrated
their criticism on Olympic-related
matters, ignoring the parallel chill
in U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations
over disarmament and the deploy
ment of new NATO missiles in
Western Europe.
The Soviet Union has until June
2 to make its decision on the
Games, but it already has con

traded to receive transmission of
the Summer Games in the
U.S.S.R., according to the chair
man of Netcom, the San Francisco
based satellite transmission corpo
ration handling international trans
mission for the Los Angeles Olym
pics.
"Because Netcom will receive a
nonrefundable deposit from the
Soviet Union, we anticipate trans
mitting events in which Russian
athletes will compete," William
Tillson, chairman of Netcom, said
Monday. The Soviet deposit is ex
pected by May 1.
