# Olympic hoop squad chosen
## 
### 
Bloomington, Ind. ( VP) — U.S. Coach
Bobby Knight said he didn't want to talk
about the 20 players selected to the U.S.
Olympic basketball team.
Then he did at Monday's news conference
to announce the players — eight more will
be cut before the Olympics — selected from
72 athletes after the grueling weeklong tri
als at Indiana University.
His comments weren't all positive. In fact,
he said. "The only question I have is the
outside shooting of the team. This is not a
team of outside shooters."
But of the choices decided by the selec
tion committee and his staff. Knight said.
"The 20 players were far and away beyond
everyone (else) involved in the trials. There
was no one else remotely close.''
The team is overloaded with 10 guards,
including North Carolina's Michael Jordan,
who can play forward.
Some of knight's comments on individ
uals:
Steve Alford. Indiana, guard: "He's
probably the best shooter we had here. He's
not a guy that can manufacture shots for
himself. If he can get open by way of screens
and get away from people and set up cuts,
that becomes a very positive thing for him
because of his great shooting ability."
Johnny Dawkins, Duke, guard: "I think

Dawkins played much more under control
than I've seen him play. I thought his judg
ment was better than in the past."
Charles Barkley. Auburn, forward: "lie
will have different demands than have been
placed on him to date. He's got to work at
becoming a better defensive player and
sharpening those things he does well."'
Sam Perkins. North Carolina, forward: "I
think Perkins had excellent effort ... He
gets things done easily."
Wayman Tisdale. Oklahoma, forward:
"He does one or two things acceptable by
my standards."
Jeff Turner, Vanderbilt forward: "He
plays with a good conservative approach.
He takes very good shots and is crisp with
his passes."
Chuck Person, Auburn, forward:
"Outstanding athlete. He got a jolt to the
thigh (in a scrimmage last week). It took a
real tough kid to come back the two nights
(for the weekend games)."
Chris Mullin, St. John's, forward: "In my
mind, Mullin is a forward. That's where
Mullin has to play to make the squad. Good
shooter from the perimeter."
Leon Wood, Fullerton State, guard: "He
knows the first four letters in defense.
Hopefully, he'll learn the rest of them.
That'll be very important to him."

Michael Jordan. North Carolina, guard
forward: "As flexible as a player can he . . .
affords opportunities in a variety of ways."
John Stockton. Gon/aga. guard: "Smart
player."
Alvin Robertson. Arkansas, guard: "The
greatest player is one who plays one on
nohody with any consistency (a reference to
his ability to steal and take the hall in) ... .
Has ability to apply excellent defense pres
sure. As a defensive player lie's real. Needs
to be more careful with the basketball."
Lancaster Gordon. Louisville, guard:
"Excellent judgment, awfully good. Almost
everything he did was what he should have
done."
Knight said the centers' post play couldn't
by truly evaluated because there were no set
patterns used at the trials' games.
Patrick Ewing of Georgetown heads the
centers, which also include Jon Koncak of
Southern Methodist. Joe Kleine of
Arkansas and Tim McCormick of Michigan.
Also making the squad were guards Vern
Fleming of Georgia, Maurice Martin of St.
Joseph's (Pa.) and Terry Porter of
Wisconsin-Stevens Point.
The players will return to Indiana Univer
sity for a five-day mini-camp May 10 and
again for formal practices June 15.
