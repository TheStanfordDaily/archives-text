Colorado Springs, Colo. (AP)
— Cheryl Miller and Pam
McGee of NCAA champion
Southern California and Cindy
Noble and Lea Henry of
runner-up Tennessee head the
17 finalists selected Monday to
compete for 12 berths on the
U.S. Olympic women's basket
ball team.
Coach Pat Head Summitt an
nounced the names of the 17
players after three days of trials
at the U.S. Olympic Training
Center here. Some 106 players
competed in the trials.
Summitt will put her squad
through a series of games with
international opponents before
naming the 12 team members

and four alternates, probably by
May 3. However, Summitt said
Monday that if she and her as
sistants aren't ready to choose
their starters next week, they
will hold another round of
practices in May, and choose
after that.
The squad was originally to
be cut to 16, but was left at 17
because of a knee injury to
guard LaTaunya Pollard of
Long Beach State. She suffered
torn cartilage in her right knee
Saturday night and was sched
uled for arthroscopic surgery to
determine how long she likely
will be sidelined.
"Her performance up to the
time of her injury was strong

enough for consideration for se
lection to the group of 16," said
Lea Plarski, chairwoman of the
Amateur Basketball Associa
tion women's games committee.
"I'm in no rush to name the
12 final players," Summitt said.
"We selected the best individ
uals who possess the offensive
and defensive skills to play in
our team concept."
Other finalists joining the 6-
foot-2 Miller at forward are 6-0
Cathy Boswell of Illinois State
and 6-1 Denise Curry of
UCLA.
The guards, in addition to
Henry and Pollard, are Patty Jo
Hedges of Kentucky, 5-11

Lynette Woodard of Kansas,
Kim Mulkey of Lousiana Tech,
Joyce Walker of Louisiana
State, 5-1 1 Teresa Edwards of
Georgia and Kamie Ethridge of
Texas.
The posts, including the 6-3
McGee and the 6-5 Noble, are
6-8 Anne Donovan of Old
Dominion, Janice Lawrence of
Louisiana Tech, 6-7 Tresa
Spaulding of Brigham Young
and Carol Menken-Schaudt of
Oregon State.
Donovan, Woodard, Nohle,
Curry and Pollard were mem
bers of the Olympic team,
struck by the U.S. boycott of the
games in Moscow.
