## Ram's Head 'Anything Goes' a big exciting production 
### NANCY HENRY 
Major musical productions on
the scale of Ram's I lead's spring
extravaganza, "Anything
Goes," are relatively rare at
Stanford. The student-run
theatrical society apparently in
vested a great deal of time and
energy into their final show of
the year, and the effort has paid
off.'
The first striking aspect of
this particular version of the
Cole Porter classic is the profes
sionalism of the set and costume
designs. The artistic crews have
done an exceptional job of set
ting the scene â€” a luxury cruise
ship overloaded with 1930s soph
isticates. It is a scene ripe for
social satire, romance and witty
Porter tunes.
Unfortunately, some of the
players seem to have a bit of dif
ficulty capturing that spirit of
vaudeville on which the show
depends. Occasionally the lines
are repeated, well-rehearsed
and well-timed, yet fail to draw
laughs. It is hard to determine
exactly why. Jokes are often
typical, but not dated. Perhaps
the play lacks a sufficient num
ber of actors with the special
comic talent necessary to pull
off lines delivered in a style so
different from what today's
audiences are accustomed. But
this is a problem with any pro
duction of this sort It cannot be
counted as a major flaw of the
Ram's Head players who, for

the most part, give consistently
energetic and impressive perfor
mances.
The roles have been well cast,
and allow the actors to display
their different talents. Robin
Mitchell stars as Reno Sweeney,
the glamorous, flashy,
evangelist-turned-nightclub
singer who overwhelms the ship
(and the audience) with her
dynamic presence. Mitchell's
voice is the best suited of any in
the cast to this jazzy style of

singing, and she carries off the
high-powered numbers with
classy flare. She tones down just
enough for the slower songs,
and throughout the evening
delivers each line with appropri
ately witty sass.
Jim Schurz is Billy Crocker, a
temporarily unemployed, but
optimistic stockbroker. Billy is a
loyal friend to Reno, but it is the
young, innocent (and engaged)
Hope, skillfully underplayed by
the vocally gifted Anne

Hotchkiss, whom he loves.
Schurz's forte is the dance and,
though his disciplined, classical
style is a bit out of place in a role
that calls more for a broadway
hoofer, it is hard to fault his
technically perfected numbers
or to deny that he does stand
out each time he dances.
In the comedy department,
Jeff Gill as Moonface Martin,
the harmless public enemy No.
13, has been given some of the
play's best lines. As corny as

some of them seem. Gill creates
a character so refreshingly inno
cent we cannot help but laugh at
lines such as, "Are you taking a
sabbatical abroad?" "That's not
a sabbatical, that's Reno
Sweeney." He is like a little boy
playing cops and robbers, and
his enthusiasm is infectious; it
delights the audience.
The show reflects competent
and conscientious directing. The
large numbers are not
overdone. The scenes involving
the whole cast are well
choreographed and not overly
ambitious; consequently, they
are some of the best. The
second act, especially, is filled
with truly entertaining mo
ments. Songs such as "Public
Enemy Number One," "Let's
Misbehave" and "Blow, Gabriel
Blow" combine the multiple tal
ents of a gifted cast. Robin
Mitchell and her chorus of
"Angels" especially shine, and
at times magically bring to life
the spirit of the 19305. For these
musical triumphs, for fine
(though too few) displays of
dance and for some classic
slapstick comedy, see
"Anything Goes."
The show will run for the
second weekend, Thursday
through Saturday at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium. Tickets
are $5 for reserved seating and
are available at the Tresidder
Ticket Office.
