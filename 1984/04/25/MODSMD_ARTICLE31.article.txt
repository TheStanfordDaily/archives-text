# Care of minors an issue
## Prof discusses law in medicine 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
One of the most difficult legal prob
lems in medicine is determining the
maturity of minors who wish to have
abortions without telling their parents,
a law professor said in a speech at
Otero Monday.
••There is no litmus paper test for
maturity," Law School Prof. Robert
Mnookin said in his discussion of the
legal aspects of many medical dilem
mas in society. Mnookin also ad
dressed the treatment of the disabled
elderly and the care of profoundly
handicapped infants.
Although the law in many states re
t|iiires parental consent for minors to
have an abortion, some states have
found this to be unconstitutional. In
these states, the minor can request
that a judge decide if she is mature
enough to make her own decision
without informing her parents.
In these cases, "the core dilemma is
that individual decisions of maturity

are exceedingly difficult, and general
rules of thumb that are thought to be
able to eliminate the problem are arbi
trary themselves." Mnookin said.
"These decisions depend almost en
tirely on the nature of the judge and
give this official enormous discretion
on the case." he said.
The advantage of requiring a judi
cial decision is the care and thought
that go into the final decision.
"'ln an age of increased imper
sonated medical care, the consent re
quirement encourages, if not requires,
serious discussion between the patient
and the doctor before the medical ma
chine rolls onward." Mnookin said.
Decisions on continuing care for the
handicapped elderly are also often left
in the hands of the law. Frequently the
elderly are unable to communicate
their desires, and their relatives and
the courts are left to decide what is in
their best interests.
These difficult decisions often re
quire "predictions beyond our capa
bilities," Mnookin said.

• The central question is whether
the death is being sought for the exclu
si\c benefit of the person dying or for
the convenience of others." Mnookin
said.
Mnookin also discussed whether
parents, with medical consultation,
should be allowed to withhold medical
treatment for their handicapped
newborn.
Courts ruling on cases involving in
fant rights must decide it it is
legitimate to terminate care for a
handicapped newborn in order to
remove the burden on the rest of the
family. Hut right-to-life groups claim
that "first its the fetus, then it will be
profoundly handicapped infants,
where will it end?"
Mnookin said he does not anticipate
the role of the courts to continue to in
crease at the rate it has for the last de
cade.
• | certainly hope that we don't
reach a point where every medical
decision must be considered first in
court."he said.
