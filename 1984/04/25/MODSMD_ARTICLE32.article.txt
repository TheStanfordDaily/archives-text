Staff lunch
An almost-fogotten Daily tradition
rears its not-at-all-ugly head for a
comeback. That's right, it's the staff
lunch and it's tomorrow. Communica
tions Prof. Marion Lewenstein will
join The Daily staff for lunch and talk
about reporting, writing and inter
viewing tomorrow at noon in the
offices here. All reporters — new and
old — should attend. And that means
you. Sparky. It's an education for all
of us. Be there.
