# Quake shakes Stanford area
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff With wire reports 
Houses slid off their foundations,
San Francisco skyscrapers were sent
swaying, and at least 13 people were
injured yesterday when a powerful
earthquake struck the Bay Area.
But while the earthquake was easily
felt by Stanford students and resi
dents, there was little or no damage
done at the University.
A jolt measuring 6.2 on the Richter
scale hit yesterday at 1:16 p.m. with
an epicenter near Mt. Hamilton on the
Calaveras fault, about 12 miles east of
San Jose. The quake sent shock waves
as far south as San Luis Obispo, 250
miles away, and as far east as Nevada.
Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh
Shah called yesterday's earthquake
"the largest in the Bay Area since
1906." He estimated that the jolt felt
at Stanford was equivalent to a quake
of 4.0 to 4.5 on the Richter scale had
the epicenter been here. Most of the
quake's energy had been dissipated by
the time the shock wave arrived here.
Shah said.
The Richter scale is a gauge of the
energy released by an earthquake, as
measured by the ground motion re
corded by a seismograph. Every in
crease of one in the scale corresponds
to a 10-fold increase in ground motion

and a 30-fold increase in energy con
tent.
Shah said the relatively high magni
tude of the earthquake meant that
damage was almost a certainty.
"Anytime you have an earthquake
above 6.0 (on the Richter scale), you
expect some damage," he said.
There was no real damage on
campus, however. Books tell from
shelves in some libraries and clouds of
dust from insulation floated in the
Psychology building, but no structural
damage was reported.
Many 1:15 p.m. classes were forced to
leave buildings in the Quad after the
shake, but most classes resumed
minutes later* Although many faculty
members reported taking cover under
desks and tables, most students said
they simply rode out the waves until
the shaking stopped.
Dozens of students congregated
around a seismograph in Terman En
gineering Center minutes after the
earthquake, watching the aftershocks
which occurred during the next few
hours and describing their feelings
about the quake.
"All that cement felt like jelly," one
professor told another while watching
the seismograph record the after
shocks.
