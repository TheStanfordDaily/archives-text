# NLRB dismisses University charges against USW
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
yesterday dismissed charges of unfair labor
practices filed by the University against two
local service unions, according to United Stan
ford Workers (USW) officials.
The decision follows the April inflection in
which the USW bargaining unit approved by a
630-125 vote a measure making Local 680 of
the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU) the legal representative of the bargain
ing unit.
The University had filed charges of unfair
labor practices on March 15 against Local 715,
the VOOO-member union serving Santa Clara
County, as well as Local 680, the 1200-member
group representing the USW bargaining unit, for
attempting disaffiliation without a vote.

Jim Eggleston, counsel to USW, said he was
told of the NLRB's decision to dismiss the
charges yesterday morning. He said that the
NLRB had also verbally notified University offi
cials of their decision by noon yesterday.
University officials could not be reached for
comment.
Linda Crouse, USW president, said the deci
sion was ''the result we expected" and hoped the
University would now "begin bargaining in good
faith with us."
Mary Ann Tenuto, labor consultant to USW,
was also pleased with the decision. "We felt all
along that the charges had no merit to them,"
she said.
USW has been attempting to end its four-year
affiliation with Local 715 since December by re
ceiving a separate charter as Local 680, the same
local that represented the USW bargaining unit

when the union was first organized in 1973.
SEIU rechartered Local 680 in February and
Local 715 stopped representing USW in griev
ance and arbitration hearings.
The University, however, had refused to rec
ognize officials of Local 680 until USW took an
approval vote. Both USW and SEIU fought that
stance but decided that holding an election
would be easier than litigating the matter.
But after the election was held, the University
continued to refuse to recognize 680 as the legal
representative of the Stanford bargaining unit.
Priscilla Wheeler, University staff counsel, told
The Daily April 19 that the decision whether or
not to recognize 680 would depend on the
NLRB's decision on the University's March 15
charges.
Eggleston claimed that the charges had been
filed in the first place in order to discourage bar

gaining unit members from voting in last week's
disaffiliation election. "If they continue to refuse
to recognize 680, it will be apparent that they're
acting in bad faith,'" he said.
According to Eggleston, USW has also
amended its March 16 unfair labor practice
charge against the University. The union made
two charges last week. One claimed the Univer
sity was illegally interfering in USWs elections,
and the other charged Stanford with neglccting
its collective bargaining agreement with US W by
refusing to recognize officials of Local 680 as le
gal representatives of the union.
The amended charge applies to the second
complaint and says that even after the election
the University is still neglecting its contractual
obligation by refusing to recognize officials of
Local 680 in grievance hearings. Eggleston said
this amended charge was filed Monday.
