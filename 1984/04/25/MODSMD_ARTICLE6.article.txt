# Kennedy, Meese discuss Reagan library
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese, meeting
privately here with University President Donald
Kennedy, said on Monday that Hoover Institution
Senior Fellow Martin Anderson will serve as the
White House representative in Stanford planning
for the Ronald Reagan presidential library com
plex.
Anderson, a former domestic policy adviser to
President Reagan who remains close to the admin
istration, was the unofficial spokesman for the
White House during preliminary planning for and
negotiations over the presidential library. As the
White House's direct representative, he will serve
as its eyes and voice on the library planning com
mittee headed by Robert Freelen, vice president
for public affairs.
Meese, whose nomination to become attorney
general is stalled while allegations of his miscon
duct are investigated by a special prosecutor, is
continuing to serve as counselor to the president
and will continue as the Washington, D.C., repre
sentative for the White House.
Both Anderson and Freelen were present at the
meeting, which was the first between University
and White House officials since agreement was
reached to bring the presidential library and
museum to Stanford.
After being told that the planning committee
had scheduled a meeting after his session with

Kennedy, Meese volunteered to attend and answer
questions.
According to the Stanford News Service, Meese
told the committee that the president visualizes the
Reagan library as a living library for use by
scholars and students. According to Anderson,
Meese indicated the library should be designed to
be accessible to undergraduate and graduate stu
dents.

The president, Meese said, believes the
presidential museum should be an adjunct to
scholarly research at the library and would have no
objection to having the library and museum
housed in a single building. Reagan's nonpresiden
tial memorabilia, Meese reiterated, would be dis
played at Eureka College in Illinois, the presi
dent's alma mater.
Meese said Cabinet officials and other key ad
ministration personnel have been invited to
deposit their papers in the presidential library, but
did not elaborate.
According to Freelen, the planning committee
also reviewed studies of possible library sites done
by a committee headed by University Vice Presi
dent William Massy.
The White House has indicated that it favors a
site in the foothills adjacent to the Center tor Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. Another
site being considered is on University land bor
dered by Interstate Highway 280 and Page Mill
Road.
It is expected that a site for the library will soon
be chosen, but detailed plans for the library are not
likely to be made until after the November elec
tion. Kennedy has pointed out that because a two
term president is likely to accumulate twice as
many documents for the presidential archive, the
size of the building — and thus its final design —
cannot be determined until after it is known whe
ther the president has been re-elected.
