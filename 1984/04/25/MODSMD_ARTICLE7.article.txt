# Petitioners to meet with Hoover panel
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
A new look at ties between the
Hoover Institution and the University
is in the making, according to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
Responding to a petition circulated
by two professors here. Kennedy said
he seeks to arrange a meeting between
representatives of the Board of Trus
tees Committee on Hoover and the
authors of the petition.
Political Science Prof. John Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Rebhol/
garnered 102 signatures on their peti
tion calling for an "independent and
distinguished visiting committee" to
assess relations between the Univer
sity and the Hoover Institution.
Although Rebholz expressed op
timism at the prospect of such a
meeting, he remained skeptical as to
whether the partisanship of Hoover
will he addressed.

"It's the first time after many at
tempts that they've expressed a wil
lingness to talk," he said. "At least
we've won an audience from some
body, but the positions are so well
spelled out, that (consensus) will be
very hard."
Although Manley and Rebholz's
petition expresses concern over
Hoovers political activities, Kennedy
did not include Hoover's political ac
tions in his definition of the issue.
"The primary question is gover
nance. the appointments process and
how the relationship works," he said
at last week's Faculty Senate meeting,
according to Stanford News Service.
Bob Hamrdla. special assistant to
the president, said that no date has
been set for the meeting.
Both Rebholz and Manley hope
that Kennedy and members of the
trustee committee will attend the pro
posed meeting.

"It's hard for me to believe that
President Kennedy and trustee com
mittee members would not want to
meet directly," Manley said.

Public discussion of the Hoover
controversy is warranted, Manley
added.
"The time is getting ripe for public
airing. Why not have an open public
discussion?" he said. "That way the
Stanford community will be informed
and participating in a matter of major
importance to the University.
Manley said he feels the petition
will be successful only after the visiting
committee has been appointed and
open debate has been established.
"Our case against Hoover has es
sentially been ignored — not relutcd
Kennedy has defined the issue, and we
have defined it," Manley said. "The
two definitions have yet to meet in
open discussion against one another.
"I am looking forward to doing that
sometime soon," he said.
Kennedy and Board of Trustees
President William Kimball were un
available for comment.
