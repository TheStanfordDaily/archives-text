Navy exercises set in Latin gulf
Washington — The U.S. Navy is to begin a "coastal
surveillance exercise" this week in the Gulf of Fonseca in an
effort to help I londuras and El Salvador stop the flow of arms
from the government of Nicaragua to leftist Salvadoran
rebels, Pentagon officials said yesterday.
The officials said two destroyers will be deployed to the
gulf, which is bordered by the three nations at the heart of the
conflict in Central America: El Salvador, Honduras and
Nicaragua.
El Salvador and Nicaragua are about 20 miles apart at the
mouth of the gulf.
"It's obviously just part of the bigger picture," said a con
gressional source critical of U.S. involvement in Central
America.•"But it is getting U.S. combatants in the middle of a
gulf sided by three countries at war. You could say you're
putting a ship in harm's way."
Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified said the
maneuver will extend a pattern in which U.S. training exer
cises in the region have been planned to coincide with actual
military goals.
Reagan administration officials have said that the Gulf of
Fonseca is a primary route for secret arms shipments to Sal
vadoran rebels. And Washington has been frustrated by Sal
vadoran inability, despite U.S. assistance, to interdict that
traffic.
The officials stressed that the Navy destroyers will not par
ticipate in challenges of arms-bearing craft that may be en
countered during the exercise. They said the U.S. ships might
help identify those craft, but the Honduran or Salvadoran
navies would engage them.
U.S. points to Soviet bombing
Washington — The United States accused the Soviet Union
yesterday of "high-altitude saturation bombing" of Afghan
villages in its intensive new spring offensive against guerrilla
forces in that occupied country. The bombing is backed by
what is apparently the greatest concentration of Soviet
ground forces used thus far in Afghanistan.
In a statement, State Department spokesman Alan Rom
berg called the tactics "an escalation of the destructive and
brutal anti-civilian Soviet warfare in Afghanistan" that will
"no doubt inflict increased suffering on the Afghan people."
One senior analyst compared the Soviet offensive to a
scorched-earth policy, saying, "The Soviets are out to
demoralize and punish the population in farming areas for al
lowing the guerrillas to operate there. They are frustrated at
being unable to stop the guerrillas, so they're trying to destroy
the food supply."
This is the seventh Soviet drive in the key Panjshir Valley
since the 1979 invasion.
More than 60 Soviet Tu-16 medium-range bombers took
part in the air raids last week, officials said, and some reports
put the number at up to 100.
In addition, about 60 to 80 heavily armed helicopter gun
ships, 12,000 to 20,000 Soviet troops and 500 tanks and
armored personnel carriers are taking part in the offensive
drive up the Panjshir Valley 50 miles north of Kabul, U.S. of
ficials said. Total Soviet military manpower in Afghanistan is
between 108,000 and 115,000, officials estimated.
'Star Wars' plan is questioned
Washington — A study done for Congress' Office of Tech
nology Assessment and released yesterday strongly questions
the technical feasibility of President Reagan's proposed "star
wars" anti-missile defense system.
The study, stressing the likely effectiveness of Soviet coun
termeasures, gives critics fresh ammunition as Congress nears
its first legislative showdown over Reagan's space-based
weapons program.
Sens. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) and Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.)
in releasing the study, said it demonstrates that "a trillion or
more dollars" would be wasted in developing laser-armed
space satellites and related weapons to defend against a So
viet missile attack.
Ashton Carter, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, was hired to do the study by the non-partisan
technology office, which said the report would be used as
"background for a broader, lull-fledged" review of new bal
listic missile defense technologies.
The report's release came as Democratic presidential front
runner Walter Mondale called in Cleveland for a temporary
freeze on testing and deployment of such systems, and as Air
Force Gen. James Abrahamson, head of the administration's
space weapons research program, defended it before a con
gressional subcommittee.
Abrahamson, at a hearing before the Senate Armed
Services Subcommittee on Strategic and Theater Nuclear
Forces, said that the system proposed by Reagan probably
could not be deployed without changes in current arms con
trol pacts with the Soviet Union. Research on such technol
ogy is allowed under the agreements, he said, but modifica
tions in the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty are "the only
way we can deploy" a new system.
Reagan urges approval of
Micronesian independence
Honolulu — President Reagan flew to Guam yesterday,
and in remarks prepared for delivery there, urged Congress to
approve a pact that would give most of the islands of
Micronesia their independence from the United States.
However, he admitted that a dispute over U.S. nuclear
weapons was holding up any such agreement with the Palau
Islands of Micronesia.
Reagan flew to Guam, a U.S. territory, on the next-to-last
leg of his trans-Pacific journey to China. In a speech to be
given today on arrival at Guam International Airport, the
president said self-government for the Micronesian islands,
which have been administered by the United States since
World War 11, "should not be delayed."
"We have a natural interest in the progress of all the island
peoples of the Pacific," Reagan declared. "We want to help
the development of their economies, and we will help keep
the region free from tension and rivalries. With our partner
ship, much can and will be accomplished."
The Micronesian islands stretch out over 2000 miles in the
central Pacific just north of the equator. Since 1947, the
United States has run the islands as a trust territory under a
U.N. mandate.
For the past few years, the United States has been attempt
ing to arrange a new form of relationship called "free associa
tion" with three different groups of islands within Micronesia.
Under this arrangement, each of the island groups would be
independent and would conduct its own foreign policy, but
the United States would retain exclusive military rights over
the islands and their territorial waters.
