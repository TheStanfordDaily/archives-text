# Tripoli told embassy to fire on crowd
## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Washington — Several hours before a
gunman in the Libyan Embassy in Lon
don opened fire on demonstrators and
police last week, the Libyan government
sent a coded radio message to the em
bassy ordering the staff to defend the
building, fire on the demonstrators and
create disturbances, including bombings,
in public places, according to informed
sources.
The sources said the government of
radical ruler Moammar Khadafy has sent
many strident messages to its embassies,
which the Libyans call "people's
bureaus," but that the one sent hours
before the London shooting was particu
larly grim.
The message was intercepted by West
ern electronic intelligence-gathering
methods, the sources said. But it was ap
parently not decoded and translated in

time to be distributed to British security
authorities before the shooting began at
midmorning on Tuesday. April 1 7.
A British policewoman was killed and
11 Libyan exiles among a crowd of 70
anti-Khadafy demonstrators were
wounded in the shooting. American
specialists said a bombing at London's
Heathrow Aiqiort three days later also
was "almost certainly" linked to
Khadafy's agents.
Contrary to some newspaper and tele
vision reports here and in Britain,
knowledgeable sources said the coded
message was not intercepted by Ameri
can intelligence and passed to the
British The Americans, these sources
said, were "not involved" in the
intelligence-gathering and received their
information from the British after the
shooting.
American specialists said the message

and the subsequent shootings are part ot
an escalating campaign by Khadafy to try
to eliminate exiles opposed to his regime
around the world.
Khadafy's campaign against dissidents
abroad began four years ago and has
spawned violence in several countries. In
the last six months, however, Khadaty
has become "completely paranoid." one
source said. "He is going atter
everybody." another said, adding that
"Libya is going to be a big problem.
Khadafy's campaign against the dissi
dents apparently is spurred by increas
ingly daring attempts on his lite and a
number of bombings in Libya, an Ameri
can specialist said. The Libyan dissident
movement is growing, he added, and
some dissidents have begun to slip back
into Libya.
Last December, the military barracks
where Khadafy lives were hit by an ex

plosion soon after 1000 pounds of
dynamite was reported stolen, the spe
cialist said.
Britain lias provided refuge tor many
of the thousands of Libyans who have
gone into exile.
In March. U.S. sources said. London's
Scotland Yard, acting on tips from
Libyan dissidents, was successful in pre
venting terrorist incidents planned by the
Libyan regime. But on March 10. two
bombs exploded in London and
Manchester, wounding some two dozen
Arabs. Five Libyans, described as
"students." were deported by the British
government.
British authorities have noted some
apparent similarities between these bomb
ings and the Heathrow explosion last
Friday. London has not accused Libyans
of responsibilitv for the airport attack.
