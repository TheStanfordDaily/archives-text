# Race should not be a factor in child custody cases, court says
## 
### 
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the
effects of racial prejudice cannot be considered in deciding
child custody disputes.
The justices unanimously held unconstitutional an order by
a Florida judge who sent a young white girl to live with her fa
ther after her divorced mother married a black man. The
judge had concluded that despite the nation's strides towards
racial harmony, it was inevitable that the girl would suffer
from the "social somatization" of an interracial household.
The justices agreed that the child's welfare was the con
trolling factor in custody cases and that the state's primary
duty was to protect the interests of young children. But the
potential effect of racial bias does not justify removing a child
from its natural mother, they said.
"The Constitution cannot control such prejudices, but nei
ther can it tolerate them," Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote
for the court. "Private biases may be outside the reach of the
law. but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them ef
fect."
Burger noted that decades ago the court had rejected the
notion that legal classifications based on race were permissi
ble as a way to avoid racial conflict. In 1917. the court struck
down a Kentucky law forbidding blacks from buying homes in
white neighborhoods, declaring that ensuring the public
peace could not he accomplished at the expense of denying
constitutional rights.
