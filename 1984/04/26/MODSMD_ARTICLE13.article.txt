### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Alalia, (iuam — President Reagan arrived in Peking
today for a six-day visit in which he will tell
Chinese leaders that the future of U.S.-Chinese rela
tions is "bright with potential."
His aides have said the trip would usher in an era of
cooperation in commerce, culture and other fields and
Reagan himself made it clear that he believed relations
would flourish despite significant differences between
the United States and China, the first communist
country he has visited.
"We can be proud, considering our differences, of
how much has already been accomplished." he said in a
toast prepared for delivery at a dinner hosted by Li
Xiannian. the 79-year-old president of the People's
Republic.
"... We believe even greater progress can be made
if our future efforts are based on 'hu jing hu luii'
mutual respect and mutual benefit. II we have the will

to live up to it, hu jing hu hui can make our countries
more prosperous and more secure. It can help us be
friends, even while recognizing that we do not totally
agree on some things which we believe important."
In the prepared toast Reagan several times mentions
"differences" between the two countries, but he never
describes them.
A major problem in relations lias revolved around
U.S. support for the Nationalist C hinese govermcnt on
Taiwan and aims sales to the laiwan military. 1 he
Communist government ol China considers laiwan to
be a breakawav province and has vowed to one day
unity it with the mainland.
Although shortly before Reagan departed on his
China trip. Peking publicly put the United States on
notice that China would press the president on the issue
of arms sales to laiwan. both sides have generally
tended to ignore the issue in recent weeks.
And Reagan administration officials say they do not

believe the arms sales or .tii\ othei problem will spoil
what thcv expect to he truittul andrelatively smooth
sessions between the president and ( hinese leaders.
James Baker, the White House chief of staff, who is
accompanv ing Reagan on the trip, said lie expected no
surprises from the meetings. Baker said he anticipated
that leaders from both nations would approve several
cooperative agreements and the president would sign a
tax treats designed to assist U.S. businesses operating
in China.
In Ins prepared toast. Reagan noted that it was 200
years ago that the first American ship called on a
Chinese port, and that while this seemed like "the blink
of an eye to Chinese civilization, it spanned about the
entire historv of the United States.
Reagan is the first American president to visit China
since relations were normalized in l l >7y during the
Carter administration.
