## 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Peking — President Reagan
arrived here today in a capital
that has been swept, scrubbed,
painted and even rebuilt in parts
in the most elaborate prepara
tions China has made for a state
visit in modern history.
Not only is Reagan's entour
age of nearly 800 the largest
Peking has received in this cen
tury, but the arrangements the
Chinese government has made
for the six-day presidential visit
are extraordinary.
For more than a month,
Peking has been plunged into a

clean-up, paint-up. tix-up cam
paign in anticipation of the
Reagan visit. Convo\s ot dump
trucks have been hauling refuse
day and night from sites that he
and Nancy Reagan will visit in
and around the city.
The state guest house where
they will stay has been refur
bished at a cost ot $2 million.
The hotel where the president
will give a formal dinner for the
Chinese leadership and that will
serve as the American press
center was rushed to comple
tion.
Elaborate security arrange

ments have been made over the
past four months and then
tightened further in the last
week after Chinese police
received bomb threats.
No details are available of the
bomb threat that Peking police
said that they had received, but
security was increased in the
city's diplomatic quarters
around the state guest house
and the Great Wall and at the
hotel where the press will be
housed.
The official Chinese news
media, normally critical ot the

United States, have blossomed
with features praising the presi
dent and hailing his visit. Even
the nettlesome issue of U.S. re
lations with Taiwan has been
brought up only as a reminder
and almost with regret.
To ensure the visit's success.
China agreed to let the White
House have its way on a number
of touchy questions in preparing
for the visit. Reagan will use
U.S. military aircraft in China,
not Chinese planes as other
leaders, including Presidents
Rifhard Nixon and Gerald

ford, have diSne. He will also
bring his own limousine.
I he White House communi
cations agency has established
ill depende nt com municatioils
centers in Peking and the two
other cities Reagan will \isit.
Hying in two planeloads of
equipment to each. A U.S. Se
cret Service contingent, esti
mated at 100 to 150 agents with
their own arms, also was permit
ted. And. despite initial Chinese
reluctance, more than 300
American correspondents have
been accredited to cover the
visit.
