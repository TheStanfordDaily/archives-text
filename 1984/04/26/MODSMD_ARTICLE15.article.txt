lost notable of these petitions — one circ

urged "an immediate and indepen
nt inquiry, including a public report" on the sit
uation.

That petition of May 1983 garnered 84
signatures from concerned faculty. A similar ap
peal circulated this winter and spring has tallied
102 signatures. While Manley grants that
"everyone is sick of hearing about the Hoover In
stitution" — indeed everyone is probably sick of
these petitions — he claims that the University
has still not answered their questions.
Such a response appears imminent. President
Kennedy is reportedly arranging a meeting be
tween representatives of the Trustee Committee
on Hoover and the two professors. Although the
rendezvous is still in the planning stages, these
plans do indicate that the University is finally
recognizing the importance of keeping the rest of
us informed on this volatile issue.
We can only agree with Manley's latest com
ments: "The time is ripe for public airing. . . .
That way the Stanford community will be in
formed and participating in a matter of major im
portance to the University."
We appreciate that this is a long process — 10
months long — but a status report from the com
mittee and perhaps an open public forum is more
than overdue. The community needs to be
reassured that something is happening behind
those closed doors.
