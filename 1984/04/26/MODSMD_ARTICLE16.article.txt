## Fraternities attacked unfairly 
### 
\\ in n mt-tubers ot it fraternity on
..us campus misbehave, the fraternity
itself often comes under fire for the
acts ot its members. Now ii may or
m >\ not be wise to attribute col
lective guilt to the fraternity lor indi
vidual acts. But 1 find it amazing that,
in the absence of misbehavior, frater
nities here ha%e to defend their very
existence from half-baked attacks
such as the editorial entitled "Greek
discrimination" (Daily. April 24).
I he editorial suggests that frater
nities' rit'ht to choose their members
is discrimination, and since discrimi
nation is unfair, fraternities should be
integrated into the Draw. This logic is
preposterous. Is Stanford University
discriminatory because it has a legal
right to select its students? Is an
employer discriminatory because he
makes a judgment as to the
desirability <->1 prospective employees?
(11 ourse not. It is only when irrele
. mt • ileri:i such as race or religion
jA' introduced into -election
processes that those processes
become discriminatory. But the edito
rial does not allege that Stanford
fraternities are guilty of using such
criteria, and 1 dare anyone to make
such a claim.
I here are in fact many organiza
tions on this campus that have a right
t i choose their own members. Every
:htng from the varsity football team
to dorm theatrical productions oper
ate on this principle. The indictment
contained in tie editorial is absurdly
broad. One may complain that the
particular choices such organizations
make .ire unfair because they are
sometimes arbitrary, but this is an
entirelv different matter from the
underlving right to restrict member
ship Fiaternities here should and do
cho sc membcis on the basis of their
interest in. and potential to contribute
to. the house. The process itself is
perfectly legitimate, and is only sub
ject to criticism to the extent that
actual'selection criteria depart from
tins ideal.
One possible diflerence between
fraternities and other selective stu
dent organizations is that fraternities

control an important University asset
— housing. But this distinction simply
docs not make fraternities any less
legitimate. Almost any individual who
attends fraternity rush functions will
find that there is at least one frater
nity — probably several — eager to
embrace him if he demonstrates a
strong interest in joining. This is
especially true now that new housing
is available in Governor's Corner and
there is a plethora of living options
open to the Stanford undergraduate
(although, sadly, not to the graduate
student).
The editorial does demonstrate,
albeit unintentionally, one real failure
of Stanford fraternities — the failure
to educate the Stanford community
about their nature and purposes. The
editorial reflects a gap between two
sectors of the student population
which should not exist because it is
based on ignorance and misinforma
tion.

The Stanford Daily's views on
Greek discrimination should not be
restricted to fraternities, but should
be applied to other areas, such as the
Stanford admissions policy. Let's
suppose that one applicant has a 4.0
grade point average (GPA) and the
other has a 1.5 GPA. The admissions
committee accepts the 4.0 applicant
and rejects the 1.5 applicant. That's
discrimination. And that's unfair! In
the interest of fairness, 1 propose that
the admissions policy be changed to a
1 5,000-person random draw.
In all seriousness. The Daily fails to
address the main problem with frater
nity selectivity, which is discrimina
tion based on race. In order to attract
men who are genuinely interested in
participating in the house, some form
of subjectivity must be used. The

fraternity cannot assume the sterile
and unrealistic objectivity which The
Daily proposes. However, when the
selection process requires potential
members to be either white or a
token minority, Greek discrimination
should be a serious concern to us all.

Stanford borrowed millions to build
luxurious, $50,000-per-room dorms
for undergraduates. To meet the loan
debt, graduate students have been
notified that rents will be raised, in
some cases by as much as 17 percent.
A similar increase has occurred each
of the last two years.
Many graduate students are already
barely surviving financially. Most
graduate programs do not guarantee
sufficient funding for graduation,
unlike undergraduate programs.
Many students now pay 75 percent of
their monthly income in rent to the
University. For example, the Educa
tion Department pays half-time stu
dent employees $629 per month and
rent for a two-bedroom apartment is
$445 now and will increase to $500
this fall. The purpose of student
housing should be to make it possible
to house our young families while we
are in school; yet rent increases will
make it literally impossible for many
of us. Students with families have few
cheap housing options in the Palo
Alto community.
It is not equitable to ask graduate
students who must struggle to fund
themselves and their families to also
fund luxurious apartments for under
graduate students. Stanford does not
practice what it preaches about equal
opportunity.
The University is making a clear
statement by this policy: Two-student
families, single parents and students
with wives and children to support
are not welcome here.

\\ in n mt-tubers ot it fraternity on
..us campus misbehave, the fraternity
itself often comes under fire for the
acts ot its members. Now ii may or
m >\ not be wise to attribute col
lective guilt to the fraternity lor indi
vidual acts. But 1 find it amazing that,
in the absence of misbehavior, frater
nities here ha%e to defend their very
existence from half-baked attacks
such as the editorial entitled "Greek
discrimination" (Daily. April 24).
I he editorial suggests that frater
nities' rit'ht to choose their members
is discrimination, and since discrimi
nation is unfair, fraternities should be
integrated into the Draw. This logic is
preposterous. Is Stanford University
discriminatory because it has a legal
right to select its students? Is an
employer discriminatory because he
makes a judgment as to the
desirability <->1 prospective employees?
(11 ourse not. It is only when irrele
. mt • ileri:i such as race or religion
jA' introduced into -election
processes that those processes
become discriminatory. But the edito
rial does not allege that Stanford
fraternities are guilty of using such
criteria, and 1 dare anyone to make
such a claim.
I here are in fact many organiza
tions on this campus that have a right
t i choose their own members. Every
:htng from the varsity football team
to dorm theatrical productions oper
ate on this principle. The indictment
contained in tie editorial is absurdly
broad. One may complain that the
particular choices such organizations
make .ire unfair because they are
sometimes arbitrary, but this is an
entirelv different matter from the
underlving right to restrict member
ship Fiaternities here should and do
cho sc membcis on the basis of their
interest in. and potential to contribute
to. the house. The process itself is
perfectly legitimate, and is only sub
ject to criticism to the extent that
actual'selection criteria depart from
tins ideal.
One possible diflerence between
fraternities and other selective stu
dent organizations is that fraternities

control an important University asset
— housing. But this distinction simply
docs not make fraternities any less
legitimate. Almost any individual who
attends fraternity rush functions will
find that there is at least one frater
nity — probably several — eager to
embrace him if he demonstrates a
strong interest in joining. This is
especially true now that new housing
is available in Governor's Corner and
there is a plethora of living options
open to the Stanford undergraduate
(although, sadly, not to the graduate
student).
The editorial does demonstrate,
albeit unintentionally, one real failure
of Stanford fraternities — the failure
to educate the Stanford community
about their nature and purposes. The
editorial reflects a gap between two
sectors of the student population
which should not exist because it is
based on ignorance and misinforma
tion.

Viewing
discrimination
The Stanford Daily's views on
Greek discrimination should not be
restricted to fraternities, but should
be applied to other areas, such as the
Stanford admissions policy. Let's
suppose that one applicant has a 4.0
grade point average (GPA) and the
other has a 1.5 GPA. The admissions
committee accepts the 4.0 applicant
and rejects the 1.5 applicant. That's
discrimination. And that's unfair! In
the interest of fairness, 1 propose that
the admissions policy be changed to a
1 5,000-person random draw.
In all seriousness. The Daily fails to
address the main problem with frater
nity selectivity, which is discrimina
tion based on race. In order to attract
men who are genuinely interested in
participating in the house, some form
of subjectivity must be used. The

fraternity cannot assume the sterile
and unrealistic objectivity which The
Daily proposes. However, when the
selection process requires potential
members to be either white or a
token minority, Greek discrimination
should be a serious concern to us all.

Not welcome here
Stanford borrowed millions to build
luxurious, $50,000-per-room dorms
for undergraduates. To meet the loan
debt, graduate students have been
notified that rents will be raised, in
some cases by as much as 17 percent.
A similar increase has occurred each
of the last two years.
Many graduate students are already
barely surviving financially. Most
graduate programs do not guarantee
sufficient funding for graduation,
unlike undergraduate programs.
Many students now pay 75 percent of
their monthly income in rent to the
University. For example, the Educa
tion Department pays half-time stu
dent employees $629 per month and
rent for a two-bedroom apartment is
$445 now and will increase to $500
this fall. The purpose of student
housing should be to make it possible
to house our young families while we
are in school; yet rent increases will
make it literally impossible for many
of us. Students with families have few
cheap housing options in the Palo
Alto community.
It is not equitable to ask graduate
students who must struggle to fund
themselves and their families to also
fund luxurious apartments for under
graduate students. Stanford does not
