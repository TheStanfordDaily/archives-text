# Releasing inhibitions in Mazatlan

1110 waiters didn't look kindly on

this, they had few options open to them.
Dinner was eaten in the same rousing atmo
sphere. I don't especially enjoy eating in such a
noisy place, but thank God at least I don't work
there. The waiters compensated for their working
conditions by overcharging us, and it was pointless
to argue. Lest this description sound a bit negative,
1 should mention that everyone seemed to be
having a hell of a time.
It set me wondering again about why we should
travel so far for this, instead of hitting a local party
or bar. I've decided that for many of us, leaving the
country provides a release from inhibitions.
In Mazatlan we have transplanted a small piece

of America out of the reach of society's con
straints. The local culture can be safely ignored.
Having pretended to escape from American soci
ety, we actually remake it in a fantasized form.
On the beach, the Mexicans are confined mostly
to vendors. There are the inevitable hats, blankets,
jewelry and hammocks, but occasionally some
doughnuts and clever little puzzles, too.
A friend of a friend has attracted a hammock
vendor's attention and is playing some variations
on the theme of bargaining. "How much for your
shirt?" he asks impulsively. The vendor laughs a
bit. "I'll give you 100 pesos," Chris offers. The
man smiles and shakes his head. "Okay, 50 pesos
then," says Chris, "that's my final offer." No dice.
An offer to trade a frrsbee for a pair of shoes is
declined as well. However, the possibilities are not
yet exhausted. "How much for your sister?" Chris
demands. I try to shrink down to a point and can
not. But if the vendor is insulted he doesn't show
it. After a few moments he enters into the spirit of
things and, pointing to the nearest beautiful
blonde, he asks Chris to name a price.
(Back in California, everyone is subdued again;
another quarter has started. I don't feel cheated or
misled; it was more or less the kind of vacation 1
expected, but I do have a sense of unease. In
Mazatlan Americans and Mexicans became
caricatures of themselves. I still wonder what im
pression of Mexico the others took home and
what impression the Mexicans have of us.
