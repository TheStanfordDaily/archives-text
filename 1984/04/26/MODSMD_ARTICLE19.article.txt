## A 						new spirit in East Palo Alto 
### 
In this cynical age, it is often consid
ered admirably hardheaded, or
"realistic" for one to believe that col
lective efforts to achieve greater
justice, freedom and equality almost
always produce the opposite results of
those intended. The notion, for in
stance, that a small, relatively poor
community such as East Palo Alto can
truly better its own condition is con
sidered laughable by many. Yet a look

VIEWPOINT

at what is happening in East Palo Alto
provides evidence that conventional
wisdom may be in error.
The common stereotypes about
East Palo Alto tend to focus only on
the community's many problems.
These stereotypes, while not wholly
inaccurate, are misleading to the ex
tent they suggest matters have always
been this way or must continue to
remain so. Moreover, typical descrip
tions fail to capture many of the posi
tive qualities of life in East Palo Alto
and tend to suggest that the problems
which do exist are the community's
own doing.
East Palo Alto is small. Yet it is so
because significant chunks of the com
munity have been annexed by sur
rounding cities whenever they have
become developed enough to provide
attractive tax revenue sources. East
Palo Alto has a small commercial sec
tor in part because the construction
and placement of the Bayshore
Freeway destroyed a striving commer
cial community and isolated the town
from surrounding communities-.
It is composed predominantly of
poor minority residents; neither of
these attributes are particularly
welcomed or tolerated in nearby cities
which have allowed growth to push
out low-income residents. It is plagued
by crime both because of poverty itself
and the ineffectiveness of the San
Mateo County Sheriff s office. A look
at East Palo Alto's history shows that
many of its current problems have
been exacerbated by outside forces.
Looking forward, however, one can
see a different, dynamic development.
Last June, voters in East Palo Alto in
itiated a decisive break with the past.
The community voted to become a

self-governing city rather than remain
a neglected child of San Mateo
County. There were, of course, many
who opposed incorporation. Absentee
landlords feared that cityhood would
change East Palo Alto's status as a
haven from regulation. Some among
the white minority felt uncomfortable
with the prospect of living under black
leadership, while many simply
doubted such a relatively small, poor
community could muster the financial
resources to sustain self-government.
The controversies surrounding in
corporation have been bitter and pro
incorporation forces have already
been forced to fight — and win — two
lawsuits and a referendum. Yet the
results so far suggest that the struggle
has been well worth the price.
Absentee landlords and the tradi
tional old guard have failed to main
tain positions of privilege, bringing
greater democratic control and pos
sibly allowing many citizens to finally
look forward to a better life. Renters,
for instance, constitute 55 percent of
the community. Faced with the
hardships caused by soaring rents and
the injustice of arbitrary evictions, the
city council passed and the voters
recently confirmed a fair and
moderate rent control measure which
will offer tenants protections they so
badly need.
The city has plans to transform a
surplus school site into a recreational
facility. This acquisition will provide a
healthy outlet for the energies of the
city's youth and help prevent juvenile
delinquency.
The council has also announced its
intention to eventually assume law en
forcement responsibilities from the
county. The Sheriff s Department has
extremely poor standing in the com
munity. All of the officers who patrol
East Palo Alto are white and none live
in the community. There have been
numerous reports of police abuse and
complaints that blatantly open drug
trafficking is ignored. Only commu
nity control can restore respect for law
enforcement.
Independent studies carried out
prior to incorporation suggest that the
city can expect to sustain a budget
surplus through its first five years.
East Palo Alto has rezoned some

properties for commercial use and
created two commissions responsible
tor suggesting ways the city can attract
new business. Finally, the city recently
hired an experienced and extremely
well-qualified city manager to oversee
city operations.
Perhaps as important as official acts
of the city council have been the posi
tive developments which have
emerged in the community as side ef
fects of the incorporation drive. A
small community newspaper has
survived for more than a year now.
Supporters of incorporation helped
establish a chamber of commerce.
Voter registration has almost doubled
since the incorporation drive began.
An active and effective tenants move
ment has emerged. Cooperation be
tween Stanford Law School and com
munity leaders has led to the opening
of a much-needed community law
clinic which will provide services to
low-income residents at little or no
charge.
Incorporation has brought a
heightened degree of pride and op
timism to flic majority of East Palo
Alto residents. The city council has
sponsored town meetings to explain to
citizens how their city is run and
garner suggestions and criticisms. A
large number of talented and con
cerned individuals have applied to till
a variety of city commissions and task
forces. The experience ot autono
mous, democratic self-government has
generated a great deal of enthusiasm
among many in East Palo Alto. For
the first time, the community has a
chance to determine its own fate.
They are determined to prove the
cynics wrong and eventually wipe
away the negative stereotypes associ
ated with East Palo Alto. As the fights
over incorporation and rent controls
have already proven, nothing will
come easily or quickly. An array of
obstacles and problems persist. But
experience has also proven that
change is possible. One thing is cer
tain: East Palo Alto is no place for
cynics right now. Let us hope it stays
that way.

In this cynical age, it is often consid
ered admirably hardheaded, or
"realistic" for one to believe that col
lective efforts to achieve greater
justice, freedom and equality almost
always produce the opposite results of
those intended. The notion, for in
stance, that a small, relatively poor
community such as East Palo Alto can
truly better its own condition is con
sidered laughable by many. Yet a look

VIEWPOINT

at what is happening in East Palo Alto
provides evidence that conventional
wisdom may be in error.
The common stereotypes about
East Palo Alto tend to focus only on
the community's many problems.
These stereotypes, while not wholly
inaccurate, are misleading to the ex
tent they suggest matters have always
been this way or must continue to
remain so. Moreover, typical descrip
tions fail to capture many of the posi
tive qualities of life in East Palo Alto
and tend to suggest that the problems
which do exist are the community's
own doing.
East Palo Alto is small. Yet it is so
because significant chunks of the com
munity have been annexed by sur
rounding cities whenever they have
become developed enough to provide
attractive tax revenue sources. East
Palo Alto has a small commercial sec
tor in part because the construction
and placement of the Bayshore
Freeway destroyed a striving commer
cial community and isolated the town
from surrounding communities-.
It is composed predominantly of
poor minority residents; neither of
these attributes are particularly
welcomed or tolerated in nearby cities
which have allowed growth to push
out low-income residents. It is plagued
by crime both because of poverty itself
and the ineffectiveness of the San
Mateo County Sheriff s office. A look
at East Palo Alto's history shows that
many of its current problems have
been exacerbated by outside forces.
Looking forward, however, one can
see a different, dynamic development.
Last June, voters in East Palo Alto in
itiated a decisive break with the past.
The community voted to become a

self-governing city rather than remain
a neglected child of San Mateo
County. There were, of course, many
who opposed incorporation. Absentee
landlords feared that cityhood would
change East Palo Alto's status as a
haven from regulation. Some among
the white minority felt uncomfortable
with the prospect of living under black
leadership, while many simply
doubted such a relatively small, poor
community could muster the financial
resources to sustain self-government.
The controversies surrounding in
corporation have been bitter and pro
incorporation forces have already
been forced to fight — and win — two
lawsuits and a referendum. Yet the
results so far suggest that the struggle
has been well worth the price.
Absentee landlords and the tradi
tional old guard have failed to main
tain positions of privilege, bringing
greater democratic control and pos
sibly allowing many citizens to finally
look forward to a better life. Renters,
for instance, constitute 55 percent of
the community. Faced with the
hardships caused by soaring rents and
the injustice of arbitrary evictions, the
city council passed and the voters
recently confirmed a fair and
moderate rent control measure which
will offer tenants protections they so
badly need.
The city has plans to transform a
surplus school site into a recreational
facility. This acquisition will provide a
healthy outlet for the energies of the
city's youth and help prevent juvenile
delinquency.
The council has also announced its
intention to eventually assume law en
forcement responsibilities from the
county. The Sheriff s Department has
extremely poor standing in the com
munity. All of the officers who patrol
East Palo Alto are white and none live
in the community. There have been
numerous reports of police abuse and
complaints that blatantly open drug
trafficking is ignored. Only commu
