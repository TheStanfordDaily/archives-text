# Union recognition linked to NLRB
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
The University yesterday indicated
that recognition of Local 680. Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU), is not imminent and is to a
large degree dependent upon a Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
decision.
Michael Vartain, associate staff
counsel to the University, said the
recognition issue is extremely compli
cated and will not be resolved until the
validity of the United Stanford
Workers' (USW) April 18 election is
determined by the NLRB.
USW officials claim the University's
refusal to recognize Local 680 as the
legitimate representative of the Stan
ford bargaining unit is merely a delay
ing tactic designed to weaken the
union.
Jim Eggleston. counsel to USW,
called the University's action "an at
tempt to stall in "bad faith and an
effort "to weaken union representa
tion at Stanford."
USW held an approval election on
\pril 18 to confirm its disaffiliation
Irom SEIU's Local 715, the l H)00-
member county wide union. Prior to its
affiliation with 715 four years ago.
USW was represented by Local 680.
Union officials claim that last Wed
nesdays election, in which Local 680
garnered a 630-125 margin, was the
final step in the disattiliation proce
dure and the University is now legally
obligated to recognize Local 680.
Vartain said the NLRB had indi
cated that although it was dismissing

charges filed by the University against
Locals 715 and 680 last month, Stan
ford had been correct in not recogniz
ing L ocal 680 without an approval
vote.
The University had filed unfair
labor practice charges on March 15
against both local unions. The charge
against 715 claimed that the union was
reneging on its contract with the Uni
versity by not representing the USW
bargaining unit. Local 680 was
charged for seeking recognition with
out first conducting an approval elec
tion.
Vartain claimed the NLRB had said
the University's charges, though likely
to be dismissed, had the beneficial ef
fect of pressuring USW into holding
an election.
Eggleston said this was not true. He
claimed that USW had begun planning
an approval election almost immedi
ately following SEIU's early February
decision to separate the two unions
and recharter Local 680.
Vartain also claimed that the NLRB
was planning to dismiss USW's April
l(t charges against the University.
The union had accused Stanford of
violating its collective agreement with
USW by refusing to recognize officials
of Local 680 in grievance and arbitra
tion hearings as well as unlawfully in
terfering in USW's internal affairs by
publicly denouncing the validity of
its forthcoming election.
USW amended this charge Monday,
adding that the University was refus
