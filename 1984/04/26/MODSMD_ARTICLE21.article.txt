## Texans sprinkle some hometown spice on the Farm 
### BETH KNEELAND 
Armed with a large dose of creative ideas and a
dash of hot chili powder, Stanford seniors Philip
Chalk and Vance McMahan have managed to give
new life to a dying club, the Texans-at-Stanford.
The charter members of the club signed their
names among splatters ot salsa and guacamole on
a menu from Chili's Bar and Cirill in Cupertino
earlier this year. Chili's, a restaurant which
features authentic "Tex-Mex" food, has become
the official meeting place of the club, and mem
bers are looking forward to another one opening
soon in Palo Alto.
The main purpose of the organization, accor
ding to club members, is for Texans to gather for
"chow and chatter" in an atmosphere reminiscent
of home. The club has a distinct tongue-in-cheek
nature. On their membership form, for instance,
they explain. "We are a resume-building club;
everyone is a vice-president "
The club does have a more serious side, though.
It has an official logo — complete with armadillo
— which dominates the club stationery, and offi
cers meet monthly. Members have even designed
special sweatshirts with the words "Texans-at-

'Texans feel more comfortable
going to California than going
above the Mason-Dixie line
where people wear tweed/

Stanford" emblazoned on a Texas flag across their
chests. The club boasts more than 100 members,
including a few out-of-state members who have
been granted the status of "honorary Texans."
The Texans-at-Stanford do business both on
and off the Farm. On campus, visiting high
schoolers from the Lone Star state can stay with
club members while touring the University,
making the transition frr-n Texas to California i
little easier. In Texas, prospective Stanfordites

can get a taste ot the club from Keith Light, assis
tant director of Univeristy admissions, who prom
ises to sport the club T-shirt on recruiting jaunts
to Texas high schools.
Texas is one of the most represented states on
campus. McMahan claims that Texans love Stan

is a vice-president/

League school with a more Texas-like setting."
Chalk adds that "Texans feel more comfortable
going to California than going above the Mason-
Dixie line, where people wear tweed."
Because of the range of ethnic diversity in cities
such as Houston and Dallas, it is difficult to refer
to Texa; . as a cohesive group "Texas is so big,"
said Chalk, "you can leave the eastern part of the
state, drive half way to California and still be in
Texas."
Yet Texans manage to come together despite
this diversity and distance. Chalk feels that the
unique history of the state has a lot to do with
Texan unity. "We were a nation for nine years."
he noted.
Texas gained its independence from Mexico on
March 2, 1836, and revelled in its freedom for
some years before joining the Union. Appropri
ately, the Texans-at-Stanford host a celebration
each year 011 this date.
Chalk said that most Texans are very attached
to their state and that many club members will
probably go back there after graduation. "My
bedspread is a 10-foot Texas flag," he quipped.
Membership fees to the club arc minimal. An
nual dues of $2 will suffice for an authentic Texan,
while $10 necessary for out-of-staters wishing
to become honorary members.
