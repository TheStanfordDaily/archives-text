## McCarthy named MVP Women gear up for NCAA 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
It's been a very good year, and the Stanford wo
men's golf team seems intent on making it even
better.
The Cardinal, having already locked up a bid to
the NCAA Tournament in Innisbrook, Fla.,
May 23-26, had nothing to lose when it went
down to El Cajon for the WCAA Championships
Monday and Tuesday. With no pressure other
than that self-imposed to win, the Stanford golfers
turned in one of their better performances of the
year, finishing only one stroke behind their chief
rival in the WCAA this year, Arizona State.
The tournament marked the end of what has
been an outstanding regular season for the Car
dinal, and when the WCAA All-Conference team
was announced after play ended Tuesday, the ex
cellence of the Stanford golfers was resoundingly
acknowledged by the conference.
Freshman Kathy McCarthy, who won five tour
naments this year, was named conference MVP
and placed in the lead position on the five-person
first team, an astounding accomplishment for a
first-year player.
Two other Stanford players joined McCarthy
on the All-Conference team â€” freshman Julie
Carmichael was named to the fifth spot on the
first team, and sophomore Kathy Kostas was
placed in the second position on the second team.
The selections for the first team reflect the
domination which Stanford and Arizona State
have enjoyed in their conference this year: The

three other players named to the first squad
besides McCarthy and Carmichael are all trom
Arizona State.
According to Carmichael, a natural rivalry has
sprung up between the two teams as a result of
their year-long battle for supremacy in the confer
ence. This rivalry provided a definite incentive for
victory in the WCAA Championships among the
Stanford players.
Indeed, the Cardinal very nearly pulled it off.
Coming into the final hole of the tournament, a
short par 3 which Carmichael admitted "wasn't a
very hard hole," Stanford was almost dead even
with Arizona State. But the Cardinal golfers ran
into trouble on the green, as all four bogeyed the
hole, including Carmichael, whose second putt
"just lipped out of the hole."
As a result. Arizona State eked out a victory
with a 54-hole total of 916, followed by Stanford
at 917. and USC, the only other team in real con
tention, at 923.
The individual tournament champion was
ASU's Tina Tombs, who shot a 4-over-par 220.
McCarthy finished in a three-way tie for second at
225, while Carmichael wound up tied for fifth at
230. Rounding out the Stanford totals were
Kostas at 232, Kathy Nino at 233 and Diane
Nixon at 240.
The Cardinal will warm up for the NCAA with
two amateur exhibition tournaments: the Car
dinal Club Celebrity on May 7 and the Spring
Blossom Festival on May 17.
