Lausanne, Switzerland (AP) — The Soviet Union ap
peared closer to competing in the Summer Olympics in
Los Angeles after a meeting here with Olympic or
ganizers and American representatives.
"I'm very happy with the results of the meetings,"
Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the Interna
tional Olympic Committee (IOC), said Tuesday. "We
may say that the black clouds jn the Olympic sky have
vanished or will very soon disappear."
Samaranch had called the session in response to a re
quest by the Soviets, who had cast doubt on their par
ticipation in the Games and charged the United States
had violated the Olympic Charter. But after Tuesday's
meetings, the Soviets promised that they would attend
the Games if the Los Angeles organizers "uphold the
Olympic Charter."
Peter Ueberroth, president of the Los Angeles

Olympic Organizing Committee and the chief U.S. rep
resentative at the talks, refused to characterize the
meeting as a "breakthrough" guaranteeing Soviet at
tendance. But he said he would guarantee that the
LAOOC would comply with the Charter.
"There has been some progress, but this is not a
breakthrough," Ueberroth emphasized after a meeting
with Marat Gramov, chief of the Soviet Olympic Com
mittee.
A joint communique said:"The Soviet Union's Na
tional Olympic Committee declares that Soviet athletes
have the firm intention of participating in the Games in
Los Angeles at the 23rd Olympiad under the condition
that the Olympic Charter is enforced. The Los Angeles
Committee gave its assurances in declarations that the
Olympic Charter would be entirely respected."
Gramov, however, would not say definitely that the

Soviets would attend the Games.
"A step forward has been made, by getting rid of
some impediments which had been accumulating
recently," he said. "I'm satisfied with the assurances
given by Ueberroth. But a number of questions still
have to be discussed. I'm sure that with further close
contact with the LAOOC, the problems will be
solved."
The Soviets repeatedly have said they do not intend
to boycott the Olympics as the United States did in
1980 at Moscow in protest of the Soviet Union's mili
tary intervention in Afghanistan. But they have not
fully ruled out withholding their athletes over alleged
U.S. violations of the Charter.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has denied that it in
tended to require visas for Soviet athletes and team of
ficials.
