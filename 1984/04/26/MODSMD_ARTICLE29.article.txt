## 
### 
Stanford (AP) — The
Olympic Games are in dan
ger of "self-destruction" and
athletes are threatened with
health and psychological
problems because of the in
fluence of the news media
and advertisers, says Stan
ford's Brooks Johnson, the
coach of the U.S. women's
track team.
" It's P.T. Barnum gone
absolutely stark-raving
mad," says Johnson. Stan
lord track and field director.
Johnson, who also coached
Olympic teams in 1476 and
1980, told a luncheon
meeting of the Palo Alto Ro
tary Club that the media
have sensationalized the
Olympics so much that the
Games are now an event for

advertisers, nut athletes or
coaches.
American athletes, he
said, are being made into na
tional heroes in order to
promote the Games, and
the> are portrayed as battlers
against things like com
munism instead of other ath
letes' physical abilities.
"The thought that the
Olympics have transcended
politics is naivete in its
simplest form," Johnson
said.
Johnson pointed to the
marathon at the 19N4 Los
Angeles Olympics as an ex
ample of how media domina
tion affects athletes.
"The air (in Los Angeles)
is at its worst at about 5
p.m.," he said. "But that's

when they're going to hold
the marathon, because it's
(television's) prime time.
"ABC (which will broad
cast the Games) wants tan
gible returns on its money."
he said. "The only way for it
to do that is to hype the
American athletes."
Although many athletes
tare well during the Olym
pics. Johnson predicted the
media and advertisers will
bring an end to the Games.
"There's only three or four
countries in the world now
that can afford to sponsor the
Games," he said. "I think it
will self-destruct and be
replaced by smaller World
Cups and championships."
Some athletes are hurt

psychological!) by the stigma
of failure at the Games, he
said. Rather than feeling
good about ju>t competing in
the Olympics. the\ feel dis
appointed if they fail to per
form up to the media's, ex
pectations.
Figure skating champion
Scott Hamilton's perfor
mance during the 1954 Win
ter Games was a good exam
ple of how o\ erpromotion
can affect the athletes.
Johnson said.
"What were the first words
out of his mouth after wining
the gold medal? He said."l'm
sorry," because he didn't
have perfect scores. That is
the worst indictment of the
media." Johnson said.
