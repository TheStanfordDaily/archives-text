### CLAY CALVERT Daily staff 
In response to recent protests from
residents of Escondido Village, a plan
to establish a "grandfather" rent
structure for the graduate student
housing project may be finalized
within the coming week, according to
James Lyons, dean of student affairs.
In another rent-related matter,
Rodger Whitney, assistant director of
residential housing said that there is
"strong support" from a number of
committees to institute a system in
which married graduate students with
out children would pay a quarterly —
instead of monthly — rent charge.
Lyons said that the grandfather sys
tem would entail a 10.85 percent rent
increase for all current residents to be
paid next year on all three-bedroom
apartments. That figure represents the
general increase predicted by the Uni
versity on rent for all campus housing
for the coming year, Lyons said.
All incoming renters after next fall
would be assessed a higher fee deter
mined as the difference between the

average rent increase and a "fully in
dexed ratio" of rents on all University
housing "in relation to one another."
according to Norm Robinson, dean of
residential education.
Lyons said the grandfather structure
would apply to three-bedroom apart

ments primarily because rent lor th. >e
units has increased at a faster pace in
recent years. He explained that tl •
three-bedroom units had previously
been underpriced.
Lyons stressed that current resi
dents would pay no "greater or less"
rent adjustments than students in
other University housing. Residents
moving in next fall have already been
sent letters notifying them ol probable
rent charges and the University will
attempt to stick to th• >se fLuri.
regardless of the propo'. Is uil<>| io>
or rejection, he said.
A meeting of the administrative
council is scheduled for tomorrow in
order to make a decision nt pre;
posal.
John McManus. one ol the
ganizers of the Escondido Coal ; tinn
for Rent Fairness, said he is "h;i[ i>\
the University has at least considered
an alternative to their previous
proposals, but there is not much dif
ference with the new plan." He said
rent would increase from the initially

Proposes rent revisions
proposed 9 percent on two-bedroom
apartments to the 10.85 percent level,
effectively nullifying the decrease on
three-bedroom units from 14 percent.
Tom Lutz, another member of the
Escondido group, said residents would
"still keep on fighting" the University
for a more reasonable increase.
Whitney said there has been "no
definite decision" on whether a mea
sure calling for a quarterly rent assess
ment for all married graduate students
without children will be adopted by
the University.
He said married students with
children will continue to make rent
payments on a monthly basis regard

less of the decision. Still, there are
"lots of reasons" for billing on a quar
terly schedule, an established practice
in which all undergraduates currently
participate via the PTR system.
One impelling factor for the change
is what Whitney termed "'a matter of
equity," commenting that graduate
students often "come and go" during
the year and the resulting vacancies
are hard to fill. He said students now
have a 45-day period in which to
notify the University of their intent to
leave.
Lyons said he was unaware of this
proposal. Robinson said he did not
know the specifics of the plan.
One resident of the village who re
quested anonymity said the proposal
would create hardships for residents
whose sources of income are either

biweekly or monthly. The University
is "ignoring the simple fact that
graduate students' income is by the
month, not the quarter. Graduate stu
dents are very different from under
graduates, and the University is not
recognizing this," she said.
She explained that instead of paying
$396 per month for rent on a one
bedroom apartment, students would
be asked to pay a lump sum of approx
imately $1200. "The only way most
students could pay for this is if they
have thousands of dollars salted
away."
Pam Hansson, a supervisor in the
Student Acounts office, said such a
rent structure would force many stu
dents to defer rent payments. The
University charges a $20 fee and 12
percent interest on all deferments.
