In response to recent protests from
residents of Escondido Village, a plan
to establish a "grandfather" rent
structure for the graduate student
housing project may be finalized
within the coming week, according to
James Lyons, dean of student affairs.
In another rent-related matter,
Rodger Whitney, assistant director of
residential housing said that there is
"strong support" from a number of
committees to institute a system in
which married graduate students with
out children would pay a quarterly —
instead of monthly — rent charge.
Lyons said that the grandfather sys
tem would entail a 10.85 percent rent
increase for all current residents to be
paid next year on all three-bedroom
apartments. That figure represents the
general increase predicted by the Uni
versity on rent for all campus housing
for the coming year, Lyons said.
All incoming renters after next fall
would be assessed a higher fee deter
mined as the difference between the

average rent increase and a "fully in
dexed ratio" of rents on all University
housing "in relation to one another."
according to Norm Robinson, dean of
residential education.
Lyons said the grandfather structure
would apply to three-bedroom apart

ments primarily because rent lor th. >e
units has increased at a faster pace in
recent years. He explained that tl •
three-bedroom units had previously
been underpriced.
Lyons stressed that current resi
dents would pay no "greater or less"
rent adjustments than students in
other University housing. Residents
moving in next fall have already been
sent letters notifying them ol probable
rent charges and the University will
attempt to stick to th• >se fLuri.
