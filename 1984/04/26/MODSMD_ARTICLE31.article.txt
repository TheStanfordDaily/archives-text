# David Gilmour proves his talent in About Face'
## 
### BARRY LURIE 
A mere one year after Pink
Lloyd's The Final Cut, David
Gilmour, the band's lead
guitarist, has struck out on his
own to create his sensational
About Face. While the new al
bum still matches him with Ins
former Llovdian cronies, it dis
tinctively captures the Gilmour
we've grown to learn and love in
Dark Side of the Moon, Wish
You Were Here and The Wall.
The album succeeds on all
fronts. About Face never lets the
listener forget who Gilmour is
probably one of the most
talented lead guitarists ol
modern music ever, who also
was responsible for many of
I'ink Floyd's musical innova
tions. haunting guitar style,
whispy vocals and nihilistic
lyrics.
In conjunction with Roger
Waters, Gilmour's virtuoso tal
ents in songwriting and guitar
work allowed the Floyd to break
from the ranks of mediocre
bands which have dissipated
from our short-term memory.
"We always felt right from the
beginning that there could be
more to rock 'n' roll than
standing on stage playing
Johnny B. Goode,' " Waters
said of his band a short while
before the release of Dark Side,
known in the Guinness Book
of World Records as the most
persistently best-selling album
in history (11 years on the Top
200 charts). Pink Floyd gave
rock a classic touch, and David
Gilmour. in his recent album,
clearly remains faithful to his
musical heritage.
Gilmour begins his album, as
Pink Floydians will, with a
haunting song, forecasting a sort
of impending doom, yet estab
lishing the main flavor of the al
bum. "What we sow we cannot
reap or keep at all," he writes in
"Until We Sleep." The song
conveys a futility of so many of
our efforts and intentions. The

style, progressive and eerily
futuristic, reflects the steady,
strong momentum and am
biance of his first solo album,
David Gilmour.
However, this new work is
markedly different. Where his
earlier album seemed more like
a display of guitar skill which
put the trivialities of lyrics on a
back burner, Gilmour's latest
endeavor asserts strong and
emotion-packed messages. It is
almost as if the former lead
guitarist feels a compulsion to
perpetuate the aura of the Pink
Floyd that probably is, unfor
tunately, no longer. The album
is rich with synthesizers, guitar
solos, cynicism and matter-of
factness that were all standard
Pink Floyd features. Yet the
pessimism conveyed is not there
merely for pessimism's sake.
The resolution develops
throughout the album — which
must be heard in its entirety.
The song "Murder," with its
sudden ups and downs of tone
and its strong bass presence, is

probably the best example of
Waters' influence on the lead
guitarist. The song ascends, and
Gilmour's nihilism pierces
through: "None of the tears that
we cry in sorrow or rage/Can
make any difference or turn
back the page." It is a song of
mass mentality. Its sudden
change in tone, like the sudden
passions of a lynch mob, reflect
the horror in the power of the
many. The guitar solo at the end
(a Pink Floyd invention) is
practically onomatopoetic, len
ding itself to a sense of confu
sion and overwhelming,
unbridled terror. The end of the
solo seems almost a tribute to
his earlier guitar work in Pink
Floyd's Animals.
"Love on the Air," with lyrics
written by Pete Townshend, is a
complete, well-constructed and
pretty tune rivaling Gilmour's
earlier classic off The Wall,
"Comfortably Numb." 'While
one is tempted to call it a love
song, that is the last generaliza
tion that one could ascribe to it.

f or there is onl\ mockers of love
and its foolhardiness of blind,
uncontrolled passions. The
irony of the song's tone, which
sounds like a love song, allows
Gilmour to make Townshend's
lyrics even more poignant. Pink
Floyd, to be sure, was never
much one for love songs; they
never wrote one in their entire
career as a band.
"Blue Light," similarly, takes
a bite out of hypocrisy and the
excess trust people place in one
another. In Pink Lloyd
paranoid fashion. Gilmour
seems to write that trust will al
ways fall through. Horns remain
persistent throughout the song
and a bongos interlude and sud
den guitar solo add to the song's
variety.
The subject changes then, or
so it seems, when "Out of the
Blues," a song on the all
pervasiveness of war and the
chunk of time in our lives it
demands, starts to play. But Gil
mour is not trying to make quick
comments, subject from subject.
The theme is one of trust and his
point is that there is none except
in one's self. Betrayal and the
horrors of it come in all shapes
and sizes — from relatives,
lovers, even from country,
which once promised to protect
you: "Out of the blue . . ./A
messenger comes, bearing
regrets/For the time that he
steals." The regrets, of course,
are vacuous and devoid of sin
cerity, and the simple, no
nonsense style of the song, as
well as its sudden ending, make
Gilmour's sentiment and the
song's title especially biting.
"All Lovers Are Deranged"
and "You Know I'm Right"
complement each other's com
mon disgust at insincere
relationships. Untamed love is
like "burning wine" which
"intoxicates and takes all cau
tion in its flames/All lovers are
deranged." The latter matches

the first song in its style. Gil
mour belts out a powerful guitar
bash, as if tearing himself away
from Ins noticeably constricted
guitar solos in later Pink Floyd
albums. It is his rockiest song,
balanced b\ the subtle ups and
downs of "You Know I'm
Right." with its jazzy and or
chestral touches. It deals with
impervious attitudes in interac-

tion, both interpersonal and po
litical. "Why should you bother
with the other side," writes Gil
mour, "when you know yours is
right?" A howling guitar and
powerful trumpets get lost by
the end, seeming, in a way, to
tangle with each other and then
dwindle in righteous obscurity.
Gilmour's ability to create a
sense of struggle is remarkable.

"Let's Get Metaphysical" is a
fantastic instrumental which sets
the haunting undertones for the
album's last song. "Near the
End." The song is apth titled,
for the doom foreshadowed in
the album's beginning is rearing
its head now: "And when you
see what's been achieved Is
there a feeling that \ou've been
deceived?" All the hard work

you have done has amounted to
so little. The impact of the sub
sequent. unexpected guitar solo
is sudden and enriches the song,
much like "Time" in Dark Side.
Unique to Gilmour and
Floyd, this use of
onomatopoetic guitar is some
how a corroboration of the
lyrics themselves and gives an

etheral substance to an other
wise merely lyrical one. Few
rock groups have managed to
achieve this harmony between
lyrics and music, especially
when making political and social
statements. Music and accom
panying lyrics must reflect each
other, and this works so well
here, affirming the former Floyd
member as a complete musician.

There is a coldness, an empti
ness, in his final melody, creat
ing a sense of something having
been irretrievably left behind.
We are truly near the end of our
lives and we don't know what
we want. All we've ended up
with is what we didn't want.
Resolution: Don't let anyone
manipulate you or alter your
course.

David Gilmour, lead guitarist for Pink Floyd, has another success with his latest solo album
entitled "About Face."
A mere one year after Pink
Lloyd's The Final Cut, David
Gilmour, the band's lead
guitarist, has struck out on his
own to create his sensational
About Face. While the new al
bum still matches him with Ins
former Llovdian cronies, it dis
tinctively captures the Gilmour
we've grown to learn and love in
Dark Side of the Moon, Wish
You Were Here and The Wall.
The album succeeds on all
fronts. About Face never lets the
listener forget who Gilmour is
probably one of the most
talented lead guitarists ol
modern music ever, who also
was responsible for many of
I'ink Floyd's musical innova
tions. haunting guitar style,
whispy vocals and nihilistic
lyrics.
In conjunction with Roger
Waters, Gilmour's virtuoso tal
ents in songwriting and guitar
work allowed the Floyd to break
from the ranks of mediocre
bands which have dissipated
from our short-term memory.
"We always felt right from the
beginning that there could be
more to rock 'n' roll than
standing on stage playing
Johnny B. Goode,' " Waters
said of his band a short while
before the release of Dark Side,
known in the Guinness Book
of World Records as the most
persistently best-selling album
in history (11 years on the Top
200 charts). Pink Floyd gave
rock a classic touch, and David
Gilmour. in his recent album,
clearly remains faithful to his
musical heritage.
Gilmour begins his album, as
Pink Floydians will, with a
haunting song, forecasting a sort
of impending doom, yet estab
lishing the main flavor of the al
bum. "What we sow we cannot
reap or keep at all," he writes in
"Until We Sleep." The song
conveys a futility of so many of
our efforts and intentions. The

style, progressive and eerily
futuristic, reflects the steady,
strong momentum and am
biance of his first solo album,
David Gilmour.
However, this new work is
markedly different. Where his
earlier album seemed more like
a display of guitar skill which
put the trivialities of lyrics on a
back burner, Gilmour's latest
endeavor asserts strong and
emotion-packed messages. It is
almost as if the former lead
guitarist feels a compulsion to
perpetuate the aura of the Pink
Floyd that probably is, unfor
tunately, no longer. The album
is rich with synthesizers, guitar
solos, cynicism and matter-of
factness that were all standard
Pink Floyd features. Yet the
pessimism conveyed is not there
merely for pessimism's sake.
The resolution develops
throughout the album — which
must be heard in its entirety.
The song "Murder," with its
sudden ups and downs of tone
and its strong bass presence, is

probably the best example of
Waters' influence on the lead
guitarist. The song ascends, and
Gilmour's nihilism pierces
through: "None of the tears that
we cry in sorrow or rage/Can
make any difference or turn
back the page." It is a song of
mass mentality. Its sudden
change in tone, like the sudden
passions of a lynch mob, reflect
the horror in the power of the
many. The guitar solo at the end
(a Pink Floyd invention) is
practically onomatopoetic, len
ding itself to a sense of confu
sion and overwhelming,
unbridled terror. The end of the
solo seems almost a tribute to
his earlier guitar work in Pink
Floyd's Animals.
"Love on the Air," with lyrics
written by Pete Townshend, is a
complete, well-constructed and
pretty tune rivaling Gilmour's
earlier classic off The Wall,
"Comfortably Numb." 'While
one is tempted to call it a love
song, that is the last generaliza
tion that one could ascribe to it.

f or there is onl\ mockers of love
and its foolhardiness of blind,
uncontrolled passions. The
irony of the song's tone, which
sounds like a love song, allows
Gilmour to make Townshend's
lyrics even more poignant. Pink
Floyd, to be sure, was never
much one for love songs; they
never wrote one in their entire
career as a band.
"Blue Light," similarly, takes
a bite out of hypocrisy and the
excess trust people place in one
another. In Pink Lloyd
paranoid fashion. Gilmour
seems to write that trust will al
ways fall through. Horns remain
persistent throughout the song
and a bongos interlude and sud
den guitar solo add to the song's
variety.
The subject changes then, or
so it seems, when "Out of the
Blues," a song on the all
pervasiveness of war and the
chunk of time in our lives it
demands, starts to play. But Gil
mour is not trying to make quick
comments, subject from subject.
The theme is one of trust and his
point is that there is none except
in one's self. Betrayal and the
horrors of it come in all shapes
and sizes — from relatives,
lovers, even from country,
which once promised to protect
you: "Out of the blue . . ./A
messenger comes, bearing
regrets/For the time that he
steals." The regrets, of course,
are vacuous and devoid of sin
cerity, and the simple, no
nonsense style of the song, as
well as its sudden ending, make
Gilmour's sentiment and the
song's title especially biting.
"All Lovers Are Deranged"
and "You Know I'm Right"
complement each other's com
mon disgust at insincere
relationships. Untamed love is
like "burning wine" which
"intoxicates and takes all cau
tion in its flames/All lovers are
deranged." The latter matches

the first song in its style. Gil
mour belts out a powerful guitar
bash, as if tearing himself away
from Ins noticeably constricted
guitar solos in later Pink Floyd
albums. It is his rockiest song,
balanced b\ the subtle ups and
downs of "You Know I'm
Right." with its jazzy and or
chestral touches. It deals with
impervious attitudes in interac-

tion, both interpersonal and po
litical. "Why should you bother
with the other side," writes Gil
mour, "when you know yours is
right?" A howling guitar and
powerful trumpets get lost by
the end, seeming, in a way, to
tangle with each other and then
dwindle in righteous obscurity.
Gilmour's ability to create a
sense of struggle is remarkable.

"Let's Get Metaphysical" is a
fantastic instrumental which sets
the haunting undertones for the
album's last song. "Near the
End." The song is apth titled,
for the doom foreshadowed in
the album's beginning is rearing
its head now: "And when you
see what's been achieved Is
there a feeling that \ou've been
deceived?" All the hard work

you have done has amounted to
so little. The impact of the sub
sequent. unexpected guitar solo
is sudden and enriches the song,
much like "Time" in Dark Side.
Unique to Gilmour and
Floyd, this use of
onomatopoetic guitar is some
how a corroboration of the
lyrics themselves and gives an

etheral substance to an other
wise merely lyrical one. Few
rock groups have managed to
achieve this harmony between
lyrics and music, especially
when making political and social
statements. Music and accom
panying lyrics must reflect each
other, and this works so well
here, affirming the former Floyd
member as a complete musician.

There is a coldness, an empti
ness, in his final melody, creat
ing a sense of something having
been irretrievably left behind.
We are truly near the end of our
lives and we don't know what
we want. All we've ended up
with is what we didn't want.
Resolution: Don't let anyone
manipulate you or alter your
course.
