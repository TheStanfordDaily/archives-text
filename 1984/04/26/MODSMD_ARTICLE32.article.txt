# Unknown Chaplin' offers some revealing footage
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
If the film industry ever erects
a monument to the historians
who have worked to preserve its
heritage, Kevin Brownlow's
name should certainly be the
first on the honor list.
Brownlow's 700-page "The
Parade's Gone By" has not been
surpassed by any other history
of the silent movie, and his
reconstruction of Abel Gance's
towering romantic epic
Napoleon, which played in
theaters across the United
States in 1981 and 1982 accom
panied by a grand new score by
Carmine Coppola, came close to
achieving the impossible feat of
recreating history.
Brownlow's most recent proj-

ect, in collaboration with David
Gill, is three 50-minute pro
grams for the BBC featuring
Charlie Chaplin footage long
presumed lost. When the San
Francisco Film Festival
screened Unknown Chaplin last
Sunday evening, what the audi
ence saw was almost beyond
belief — a collection of rushes
and filmed improvisations and
cut scenes no one had any right
to think still existed.
Chaplin didn't work from a
script; he simply ran the camera
while lie rehearsed sequences,
shifting actors, props and story
elements until he was satisfied
with what he had constructed.
From the time he began to
direct at First National in 1917,
he ordered the discarded rushes
burned, but Gill and Brownlow
located reels of unused footage
from his hectic days at Mutual
Pictures (1915-1917), where he
cranked out 12 comedies in 16
months. In the first program,
"My Happiest Years," we see
liow twn-retlers like The Citre
and The Immigrant changed

shape in the course of shooting.
On the set of The Cure — a
health spa — Chaplin im
provises on an escalator, brings
in a wheelchair, multiplies it by
12 and casts himself as a hotel
valet directing wheelchair traffic
in the lobby, switches focus to a
revolving door, and in the end
employs only snatches of the
gags he's attempted. His stock
company at Mutual, which in
cludes Edna Purviance, Albert
Austin, Henry Bergman, Eric
Campbell and John Rand, es
says one role after another; in a
scene in a cafe which expands to
become The Immigrant, he
achieves a very different effect by
replacing Henry Bergman with
the enormous, scowling mime

Eric Campbell in the role of the
bullying waiter.
The remarkably perceptive
narration (read by James
Mason) points out details all but
the most devoted Chaplin
aficionados would be likely to
miss — like his uncharacteristic

broadness in an early take of the
cafe scene, when he discovers
that he has no money to pay for
his food — as well as conveying
the impression, throughout this
initial episode, that we are par
ticipating in the unravelling of a
series of long-unsolvrd mys
teries. How did Chaplin work
out his routines? What did he
start with? How did he create
his trick effects? By studying the
rushes of an amazing bit cut
from Behind the Screen, involv
ing a falling axe that seems to
miss Chaplin's foot by mil
limeters, we learn what Gill and
Brownlow must have spent days
figuring out: that Roland Tot
heroh, Chaplin's cameraman,
wound the film in reverse.
The second program, "The
Greatest Director," covering
the period at First National
(1917-1923) and Chaplin's
work at United Artists through
City Lights (1931), contains in
terviews with his first wife, Lita
Grey, with Jackie Coogan, his
juvenile co-star in The Kid
(1921), and especially revealing
ones with Virginia Cherrill, who
played the blind girl in
City Lights, and the immodest
Georgia Hale, his leading lady
in The Gold Rush (1925). We
hear riveting tales of Chaplin's
unorthodox ingenuity and per
fectionism and fits of pique, of
his meticulous method of direct
ing actors ("You'd find yourself
feeling that he was you," Cher
rill says, with a mixture of awe
and resentment), of his refusal
to work when uninspired (this
revelation is neatly documented
by stacks of shooting schedule

reports Brownlow and Gill got
their hands on somewhere), of
his getting sick — along with
Mack Swain — after eating prop
shoes made of licorice in take
after take of the famous boiled
shoe scene in The Gold Rush.
And the editor-historians
have discovered unofficial
footage of Chaplin directing
Cherrill in City Lights and stills
of sequences shot on location
for The Gold Rush and later re

shot in the studio, with Georgia
Hale substituting for the
original female star, l.ita Grey
(who had married Chaplin in
the interim and beeome preg
nant). Incredibly, there even
remains a fragment of the last
scene from City Lights — a
rehearsal on film — with Hale,
whom Chaplin almost hired to
replace Cherrill. (The co-stars
had a very rocky working rela
tionship.) The clip is an amazing
curio, though you can see why
Chaplin didn't reshoot the
picture (aside from the official
financial reasons): Hale is far
too strident, too aggressively
sexy, for the part, and when we
see the celebrated, heartbreak
ing ultimate scene of City Lights
as Chaplin eventually shot it,
Cherrill's acting is considerably
better than he or Hale gave her
credit for.
Each of the programs in
Unknown Chaplin has a differ
ent focus; put another way, each
demonstrates a slightly different
kind of film scholarship. In the
last, "Hidden Treasures," we
have the opportunity to watch
sequences cut from the release
pi int-, of &iu>ul<der 4r#is
The Circus (1927), City Lt#/ils.
Modern Times (1936) and

others. In every case we under
stand why Chaplin removed
them, but there isn't a single se
quence that doesn't contain at
least an exquisite moment or
two. (The footage from The
Circus had never been as

sembled, but Brownlow and Gill
unearthed Chaplin's cutting in
structions and pieced these
scenes together themselves.)
There are also a couple of au
thentic jewels: a snippet from a
benefit film (to raise money for
the British wounded in World
War I) in which Chaplin and the
Scottish music hall balladcer
Harry Lauder mimic each
other's walk, and the only reel
Chaplin ever shot of what would
have been a First National
three- or four-reeler in 1923,
The Professor. A priceless
schtick revolving around a flea
circus in this unfinished comedy
shows up three decades later
(and much the worse for wear)
in Limelight, and other trashed
ideas resurface, too — a barber
shop routine cut from Sunny side
(1919) passes, greatly im
proved, into The Great Dictator
(1940), and so does a bit ol
clowning Chaplin indulges in at
one of Douglas Fairbanks' par
ties, mercifully preserved in a
home movie: We actually see
him improvising a little dance
with a globe. Could anyone
have suspected that one ol
Chaplin's most delicate and ad
venturous moments on film
originated at a party in the '20s?
In Unknown Chaplin. Kevin
Brownlow and David Gill have
not merely legitimized film
scholarship; they have made it
thrilling.


Chaplin dines on a boiled shoe in "The Gold Rush." In this fa
mous scene the prop shoe was made of licorice, and Chaplin
had to eat so many that he got sick.


Chaplin and Virginia Cherrill ft* "Crty Lights." Chaplin found making thin risky late silent film
— and directing Cherrill — extremely frustrating.

If the film industry ever erects
a monument to the historians
who have worked to preserve its
heritage, Kevin Brownlow's
name should certainly be the
first on the honor list.
Brownlow's 700-page "The
Parade's Gone By" has not been
surpassed by any other history
of the silent movie, and his
reconstruction of Abel Gance's
towering romantic epic
Napoleon, which played in
theaters across the United
States in 1981 and 1982 accom
panied by a grand new score by
Carmine Coppola, came close to
achieving the impossible feat of
recreating history.
Brownlow's most recent proj-

ect, in collaboration with David
Gill, is three 50-minute pro
grams for the BBC featuring
Charlie Chaplin footage long
presumed lost. When the San
Francisco Film Festival
screened Unknown Chaplin last
Sunday evening, what the audi
ence saw was almost beyond
belief — a collection of rushes
and filmed improvisations and
cut scenes no one had any right
to think still existed.
Chaplin didn't work from a
script; he simply ran the camera
while lie rehearsed sequences,
shifting actors, props and story
elements until he was satisfied
with what he had constructed.
From the time he began to
direct at First National in 1917,
he ordered the discarded rushes
burned, but Gill and Brownlow
located reels of unused footage
from his hectic days at Mutual
Pictures (1915-1917), where he
cranked out 12 comedies in 16
months. In the first program,
"My Happiest Years," we see
liow twn-retlers like The Citre
and The Immigrant changed

shape in the course of shooting.
On the set of The Cure — a
health spa — Chaplin im
provises on an escalator, brings
in a wheelchair, multiplies it by
12 and casts himself as a hotel
valet directing wheelchair traffic
in the lobby, switches focus to a
revolving door, and in the end
employs only snatches of the
gags he's attempted. His stock
company at Mutual, which in
cludes Edna Purviance, Albert
Austin, Henry Bergman, Eric
Campbell and John Rand, es
says one role after another; in a
scene in a cafe which expands to
become The Immigrant, he
achieves a very different effect by
replacing Henry Bergman with
the enormous, scowling mime

Eric Campbell in the role of the
bullying waiter.
The remarkably perceptive
narration (read by James
Mason) points out details all but
the most devoted Chaplin
aficionados would be likely to
miss — like his uncharacteristic

broadness in an early take of the
cafe scene, when he discovers
that he has no money to pay for
his food — as well as conveying
the impression, throughout this
initial episode, that we are par
ticipating in the unravelling of a
series of long-unsolvrd mys
teries. How did Chaplin work
out his routines? What did he
start with? How did he create
his trick effects? By studying the
rushes of an amazing bit cut
from Behind the Screen, involv
ing a falling axe that seems to
miss Chaplin's foot by mil
limeters, we learn what Gill and
Brownlow must have spent days
figuring out: that Roland Tot
heroh, Chaplin's cameraman,
wound the film in reverse.
The second program, "The
Greatest Director," covering
the period at First National
(1917-1923) and Chaplin's
work at United Artists through
City Lights (1931), contains in
terviews with his first wife, Lita
Grey, with Jackie Coogan, his
juvenile co-star in The Kid
(1921), and especially revealing
ones with Virginia Cherrill, who
played the blind girl in
City Lights, and the immodest
Georgia Hale, his leading lady
in The Gold Rush (1925). We
hear riveting tales of Chaplin's
unorthodox ingenuity and per
fectionism and fits of pique, of
his meticulous method of direct
ing actors ("You'd find yourself
feeling that he was you," Cher
rill says, with a mixture of awe
and resentment), of his refusal
to work when uninspired (this
revelation is neatly documented
by stacks of shooting schedule

reports Brownlow and Gill got
their hands on somewhere), of
his getting sick — along with
Mack Swain — after eating prop
shoes made of licorice in take
after take of the famous boiled
shoe scene in The Gold Rush.
And the editor-historians
have discovered unofficial
footage of Chaplin directing
Cherrill in City Lights and stills
of sequences shot on location
for The Gold Rush and later re

shot in the studio, with Georgia
Hale substituting for the
original female star, l.ita Grey
(who had married Chaplin in
the interim and beeome preg
nant). Incredibly, there even
remains a fragment of the last
scene from City Lights — a
rehearsal on film — with Hale,
whom Chaplin almost hired to
replace Cherrill. (The co-stars
had a very rocky working rela
tionship.) The clip is an amazing
curio, though you can see why
Chaplin didn't reshoot the
picture (aside from the official
financial reasons): Hale is far
too strident, too aggressively
sexy, for the part, and when we
see the celebrated, heartbreak
ing ultimate scene of City Lights
as Chaplin eventually shot it,
Cherrill's acting is considerably
better than he or Hale gave her
credit for.
Each of the programs in
Unknown Chaplin has a differ
ent focus; put another way, each
demonstrates a slightly different
kind of film scholarship. In the
last, "Hidden Treasures," we
have the opportunity to watch
sequences cut from the release
pi int-, of &iu>ul<der 4r#is
The Circus (1927), City Lt#/ils.
Modern Times (1936) and

others. In every case we under
stand why Chaplin removed
them, but there isn't a single se
quence that doesn't contain at
least an exquisite moment or
two. (The footage from The
Circus had never been as

sembled, but Brownlow and Gill
unearthed Chaplin's cutting in
structions and pieced these
scenes together themselves.)
There are also a couple of au
thentic jewels: a snippet from a
benefit film (to raise money for
the British wounded in World
War I) in which Chaplin and the
Scottish music hall balladcer
Harry Lauder mimic each
other's walk, and the only reel
Chaplin ever shot of what would
have been a First National
three- or four-reeler in 1923,
The Professor. A priceless
schtick revolving around a flea
circus in this unfinished comedy
shows up three decades later
(and much the worse for wear)
in Limelight, and other trashed
ideas resurface, too — a barber
shop routine cut from Sunny side
(1919) passes, greatly im
proved, into The Great Dictator
(1940), and so does a bit ol
clowning Chaplin indulges in at
one of Douglas Fairbanks' par
ties, mercifully preserved in a
home movie: We actually see
him improvising a little dance
with a globe. Could anyone
have suspected that one ol
Chaplin's most delicate and ad
venturous moments on film
originated at a party in the '20s?
