# Nicaraguan editor blasts censorship

### EILEEN FITZGERALD 
When a revolution comes to
power, there is no free press, they
simply squeeze the tree press out,"
Pedro Chamorro, editor and director
ot the only independent newspaper in
Nicaragua, told a capacity Terman
Auditorium crowd last night.
" I reedom of the press has become a
daily battle" since the Sandinista gov
ernment implemented its official cen
sorship policy in 1982, Chamorro said.
Since then his paper. La Prensa. has
been shut down seven times due to
censorship violations, and an addi
tional 22 times it did not appear be
cause it had been so heavily censored.
"Sometimes and quite often we
can't print the paper at all," he >aid.
According to Chamorro, the days of
l a Prensa are numbered. "I don't
think the Sandinistas want a free press
at all," he said. "La Prensa is a
censored and terribly censored news
paper."
1 hi instance, every time a wire item
Di an article uses the words "guerilla"
< "rebel." the censor inserts the word
â€¢ounter-revolutionary." Although
censorship severely limits freedom of
the press. Chamorro said he and his
sia are struggling to preserve the few
freedoms they do have.
Mthough the censorship office,

called the Directorate of Media and
Communication, censors every
headline, article, photo and advertise
ment. it can not yet dictate what to
print.
"If they also say what we have to
put in the paper, then 1 won't be editor
of La Prensa." Chamorro said. "We
don't receive guidelines, and we don't
follow orders."
Because ot this, the paper offers a
sense of hope to the people of
Nicaragua, he said.
"When we don't publish, people
know there is a free mind in La
Prensa."
The censorship makes running a
newspaper very difficult since presses
must wait until every line has been
read and every picture and advertise
ment have been inspected for sub
liminal and subversive messages,
Chamorro said.
"We are actually waiting to see our
work destroyed," he said.
La Prensa has been destroyed three
times, twice by earthquakes and once
in a deliberate missile strike by the
Somoza regime, the rulers of
Nicaragua before the Sandinistas
came to power. Chamorro said the
paper knows "how to come through
the ashes."
