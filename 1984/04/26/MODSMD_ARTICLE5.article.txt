# Quad cement slated to be replaced

Freshmen entering Stanford next fall will never traverse the Quad on its
eement walkways.
The walks are soon to disappear, and most of the Inner Quad will be
repaved with red-brown cement paving blocks as part of the Inner Quad
renovation plan. "We're preparing for construction the day after Com
mencement, and we intend to finish it over the summertime," according to
Project Manager Max Mazenko.
Some phases of the project are already underway. The Inner Quad was
permanently closed to motor vehicles earlier this month with the place
ment of posts and bollards, as the first step in the renovation plan.
In addition, samples of the cement paving blocks have been on display
in the Inner Quad, and recently the project's advisory committee recom
mended a modification of sample No. 5.
The final paving stone will be a bit more brown than this sample and
will be shaped somewhat like a modified octagon. Mazenko said. Within
the next several weeks, he said, "We hope to get another sample of the
final color and shape. We're also doing preliminary work on the drainage
system."
The installation of new decorative paving throughout most of the three
and-one-half acres of the courtyard is the most obvious and major im
provement in terms of both appearance and cost, Mazenko said. The plans
also include improvement of the storm drainage system, renovation of the
eight existing planting circles and reconstruction of the paved rosette in
front of Memorial Church.
The existing eve-level shrubs and hushes in the planting circles will be
replaced with lower trees and shrubbery, "the idea being to allow you to
see the entire courtyard." Mazenko said. In addition, each circle will be
enclosed by a low seat wall.
New lighting fixtures may also be installed in the planting circles. Ac
cording to Mazenko, "That's one of the remaining decisions we need."
The Victorian-style globe fixtures will be similar to those found elsewhere
on campus, and each planting circle will probably contain tour tixtures.
The Inner Quad renovation project has come under tire in the past tor
failing to adhere to the original architect's plan for the courtyard.
However. Mazenko believes the current plans retain the "monumental,
classical shapes" of the original layout. That plan suggested a "granite
like pavement," probably cement, according to Mazenko. "We don't
know what color granite or what size."
The paved walkways now in place in the Quad aren't in the original
plan, and their removal is "really the major change," Mazenko said.


Renovation of the Inner Quad continues, with these workmen trying
to locate subterranean water lines and install manhole covers.
