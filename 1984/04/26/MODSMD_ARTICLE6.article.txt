# Drell lambasts 'Star Wars' plan in Congress
## 
### 
The co-director of Stanford's Center tor Inter
national Security and Arms Control blasted Presi
dent Reagan's proposed "Star Wars" defense plan
m front of of a Senate committee in Washington
yesterday.
"The U.S. must not let the new fascina
tion . . . detract us from taking important measures
to assure our deterrent capability and to maintain
adequate conventional strength." Prot. Sidney
Drell told the Senate Foreign Relations C ommit
tee yesterday.
Rather than begin the new program. Drell said
the United States should "make a determined ef
fort. through sensible program restraints as well as
through negotiations, to keep space trom becom
ing one more dimension of unnecessary weapons
competition between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union."

However, President Reagan's science adviser
told the committee the United States should delay
for "the next couple of years" such negotiations so
that future U.S. weapons programs are "not
blocked by a previous patchwork of treaty obliga
tions."
George Key worth, the President's adviser, was
one of five administration officials who defended
Reagan's "Star Wars" plan in front of the commit
tee yesterday.
Drell. testifying in support of Senate Joint
Resolution 124. which proposes a ban on the test
ing of space weapons, told the Foreign Relations
Committee yesterday there is "no prospect" of a
"technological fix" against strategic nuclear attack
and urged the committee to consider a ban on test
ing of the anti-satellite weapons the Reagan ad
ministration has proposed.

"Technology alone will not solve the political
problem of managing the strategic relationship
with the Soviet Union." Drell said, "nor does it ni
ter an escape from deterrence in a world heavily
armed with nuclear weapons.
Drell said there is no way to build an eflectiu
nationwide defense against nuclear attack "unless
the offensive threat is first tightly constrained tech
nologically and greatly reduced numerically as a
result of major progress in arms control."
Under Reagan's "Star Wars" defense plan,
more than 300 laser platforms would be put into
space to shoot down enemy intercontinental bal
listic missiles (ICBMs). a move Drell said is simply
not cost-effective.
Such a plan. Drell said, would require over 300
space shuttle launches, with total cost
estimates ranging upward from $500
billion.
"The space stations can be
destroyed by relatively cheap space
mines places in nearby orbits and
detonated from radio command from
the ground." Drell explained.
"Indeed, the space stations themselves
are more vulnerable than the ICBMs
against which they are targeted."
But even it the stations did survive.
Drell said current technology would
not allow the lasers to successfulh
stop all incoming missiles.
"With unconstrained proliferation,"
Drell said, "no defensive system will
work."
Ohio Sen. John Glenn, a member ol
the Foreign Relations Committee,
agreed.
"The president has misled the
people of this country" into believing
the "Star Wars" proposal will work.
Glenn said. "It he wants to be Buck
Rogers, I understand that. But it is
preposterous to carry on at this
(spending) level. The whole thing rests
on specific technologies that haven't
yet been invented."
Drell also contended the program
would speed the arms race.
"Accelerated pursuit of anti
ballistic missiles (ABMs) will give new
impulse to the expansion and diver
sification of offensive forces," Drell

said. "It will undermine deterrence by
imperiling the ABM treaty. Sooner or
later an extensive test program will be
required in order to establish confi
dence in the technical performance of a
large and technically sophisticated de
fensive system."
That program would violate the cur

rent ABM treatv on developing, test
ing or deploying ABM systems or
components, Drell said.
"A very useful and practical first
step en route to more comprehensive
restraints that may be more difficult to
achieve would he to negotiate a ban
on testing," he said.
