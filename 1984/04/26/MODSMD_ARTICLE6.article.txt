The co-director of Stanford's Center tor Inter
national Security and Arms Control blasted Presi
dent Reagan's proposed "Star Wars" defense plan
m front of of a Senate committee in Washington
yesterday.
"The U.S. must not let the new fascina
tion . . . detract us from taking important measures
to assure our deterrent capability and to maintain
adequate conventional strength." Prot. Sidney
Drell told the Senate Foreign Relations C ommit

Rather than begin the new program. Drell said

ministration has proposed.

"Technology alone will not solve the political
problem of managing the strategic relationship
with the Soviet Union." Drell said, "nor does it ni

Drell said there is no way to build an eflectiu
nationwide defense against nuclear attack "unless
the offensive threat is first tightly constrained tech

result of major progress in arms control."
Under Reagan's "Star Wars" defense plan,
more than 300 laser platforms would be put into
space to shoot down enemy intercontinental bal
