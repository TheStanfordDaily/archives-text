Washington â€” The Supreme Court, in a ruling likely to
produce more lawsuits against organized labor, yesterday
imposed new restrictions on how some unions can spend
money collected from workers compelled against their will to
pay dues.
The court said such workers cannot be made to pay for
union organizing activities or for certain types of union
sponsored litigation to which they object. The court allowed
them to be charged for a union's social activities, conventions
and publications, however.
The unions are already barred by prior rulings from using
the compelled dues of dissenters for political or ideological
activities unrelated to collective bargaining.
The decision directly affects unions in the transportation
industry and is also expected to have an impact on public
employee unions. It does not immediately affect union activ
ity covered under the National Labor Relations Act.
The actual financial impact of the ruling is small, labor
lawyers said yesterday. Only a small percentage of union
funds come from dues payers like those involved in yester
day's case. But the court's action'could create additonal ac
counting and money-handling problems.
