# Nicaragua takes U.S. to court
## 
### 
1 he Hague, I he Netherlands — Nicaragua launched its le
gal battle against the United States at the International Court
of Justice here yesterday, urging the court to halt covert
Reagan administration support for anti-government guerril
las.
Nicaraguan ambassador to The Hague, Carlos Arguello,
asked the court to impose immediate "interim measures" —
equivalent to a temporary restraining order in U.S. law — as
it formally decides whether to accept the case for delibera
tion.
In the course of a one-half hour opening statement in the
court's crowded, oak-paneled chamber, Arguello charged
President Reagan with personally authorizing the mining of
Nicaraguan ports and the United States with violating inter
national law and Nicaraguan sovereignty.
Following a one-day adjournment today, the United States
is expected to respond tomorrow by contending the court has
no jurisdiction in the case.
The U.S. argument is expected to hinge mainly on a contro
versial Reagan administration move on April 6. just a few
days before Nicaragua filed a complaint with the court, to al
ter the terms of court jurisdiction that the United States had
agreed to 38 years ago. The State Department said it feared
Nicaragua would use the court as a propaganda forum and
that it would not recognize court jurisdiction over Central
American matters for two years.
Still, a team of IS State Department lawyers has assembled
here to argue the jurisdictional phase.
