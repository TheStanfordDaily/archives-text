# Stockwell pans CIA activities
## 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
John Stockwell, the highest
ranking official ever to resign from
the CIA, told a capacity audience
in Kresge Auditorium last night
that a minimum of one million
people have died due to CIA
covert actions.
A covert action is "the
manipulation of another country's
affairs through political and violent
means," Stockwell said. "This is
accomplished through destabilizing
programs, which attempt to make
the people so miserable that their
society and economy stops and just
falls apart.
"How does the CIA do this? We
blow up bridges so the farmers
can't get their goods to market, we
roll grenades into schoolhouses, we
put grenades in department stores,
we destroy the people," Stockwell
said.
This type of activity is not what
the American public has been told
about the CIA. "The government
is committed to a policy of lying,"
Stockwell said. "The president and
the secretary of state have to lie to
protect the CIA, and the CIA lies
to protect itself."
To explain these statements
about the CIA, Stockwell des
cribed his involvement and even
tual disenchantment with the CIA.
"I went through the CIA recruit
ment pitch, which is similar to the
Army television ads, and I believed
it. It sounded exciting and
glamorous. But there's another
side where men have their legs
blown off, or their intestines
wrapped around their necks," he
said.
Stockwell entered the CIA train
ing corps. "We were the best and

the brightest. They taught us how
to recruit agents â€” they were never
called spies. They taught us to
assess people. If they were venal,
we gave them money; if they were
carnal, we brought pornographic
material; if they were religious, we
brushed up on our Martin Luther.
"They taught us that there were
no rules to what we could do to get
an agent. Our imagination was the
only limit," Stockwell said.
Stockwell's first assignment as
CIA field case officer was indeed
"glamorous," he said. The CIA
presence in Africa was eventually
ruled unnecessary and it was or
dered to leave Africa. Rather than
leave, the CIA increased its num
ber of stations to support the "hard
target" program.

That program, presented to the
State Department, the White
House and Congress, was crucial
"to recruit key KGB and Chinese
officials as CIA informants,"
Stockwell said. "A friend told me
later that the whole point of the
'hard target' program was to
maintain CIA influence in Africa."
In addition, prostitutes were
hired, under the title of special
access agents, to sleep with Soviet
and Chinese embassy officials.
"One special access agent cost
$28,000 in taxpayer money to tell
us information that we already
knew," he said.
Stockwell then became chief of
station in Vietnam in 1973, where

In Kresge Auditorium last night, John Stockwell, a former CIA offi
cial, lambasted the organization's involvement in covert activities.
"the CIA had been conducting
covert actions tor 15 years before
the actual war began." he said.
"The police chief there was a
practicing sadist. He took live
prisoners and a bottle of cognac
into a cellar and carved them up all
night. In the morning he dumped
the pieces into the river and slept it
off." Stockwell said.
The Vietnam evacuation in 1975
was a scandal for the CIA. "We
had to burn the files and get out."
Stockwell said. "We left a lot of
loyal men behind. I was told that it
was not our fault that they had the
misfortune of being born Viet
namese."
Three months later Stockwell
was made Angola Task Force
Commander for the beginning of
the Angolan covert war. "I took
the job because I would know
every secret there was to know."he
said. "I made a deal with the de\il
to see for myself. I wanted to
believe that my government, my
country made sense."
"At the National Security Coun
cil meetings. I found not the wise
bearded men I had been led to

believe existed, hut instead a group
of fat. old men who slept through
half of the meeting while we
decided how many people would
die in Africa." Stockwell said.
"Never at am point did we tell
the truth to the American people."
he said. "In the end. we got caught
in our lies and had to leave Africa.
I spent a year with the National Se
curity Council, hut I had to get
out."
Stockwell then outlined several
of the ClA's more involved covert
actions, including efforts to des
tabilize China. Guatemala. Iran.
Cuba. Vietnam and Chile. He also
described the Public Safety Pro
gram that the CIA set up in Latin
America to teach the police force
how to torture people.
Stockwell said of current CIA
covert actions. "What about
Grenada? We were not at war with
Grenada. It was a pure and simple
practice of brutality in preparation
for our Nicaraguan involvement.
"It's a tough world and il a lew
people have to die so that we can
have another car in our garage,
that's life. At least that's our presi
dent's policy." he said.
Stockwell stated three reasons
why he feels the American public
needs to be concerned about CIA

covert actions. "First, people don't
run such operations overseas and
then come back model citizens.
They run covert experiments in
volving spreading viruses on the
American public.
"Second, these actions involve us
in wars. America has been in a war
every ten years of its existence and
it's been ten years since Vietnam.
The Central American war will
begin in ten months." Stockwell
predicted.
"II these reasons aren't enough,
we now live in a world containing
52.000 atom bombs. President
Reagan wants to build and deploy
another 17.N00 in the next live
years, while continuing the ClA's
worldwide destabilizing efforts.
Reagan also wants to extend the
arms race to space.
"Forty-four wars are be inn
fought today. The CIA is currently
involved in ten major covert opera
tions. This is madnes. We must stop
it before we fall off the cliff."
Stockwell said.
Stockwell's speech was met with
a five-minute standing ovation.
The speech was sponsored by the
Stanford Central America Action
Network (SCAAN) and the Stan
ford African Students' Association
(SASA).
