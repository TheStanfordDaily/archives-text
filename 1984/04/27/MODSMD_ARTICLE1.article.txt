# Stockwell pans CIA activities
## 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
John Stockwell, the highest
ranking official ever to resign from
the CIA, told a capacity audience
in Kresge Auditorium last night
that a minimum of one million
people have died due to CIA
covert actions.
A covert action is "the
manipulation of another country's
affairs through political and violent
means," Stockwell said. "This is
accomplished through destabilizing
programs, which attempt to make
the people so miserable that their
society and economy stops and just
falls apart.
"How does the CIA do this? We
blow up bridges so the farmers
can't get their goods to market, we
roll grenades into schoolhouses, we
put grenades in department stores,
we destroy the people," Stockwell
said.
This type of activity is not what
the American public has been told
about the CIA. "The government
is committed to a policy of lying,"
Stockwell said. "The president and
the secretary of state have to lie to
protect the CIA, and the CIA lies
to protect itself."
To explain these statements
about the CIA, Stockwell des
cribed his involvement and even
tual disenchantment with the CIA.
"I went through the CIA recruit
ment pitch, which is similar to the
Army television ads, and I believed
it. It sounded exciting and
glamorous. But there's another
side where men have their legs
blown off, or their intestines
wrapped around their necks," he
said.
Stockwell entered the CIA train
ing corps. "We were the best and

the brightest. They taught us how
to recruit agents â€” they were never
called spies. They taught us to
assess people. If they were venal,
we gave them money; if they were
carnal, we brought pornographic
material; if they were religious, we
brushed up on our Martin Luther.
"They taught us that there were
no rules to what we could do to get
an agent. Our imagination was the
only limit," Stockwell said.
Stockwell's first assignment as
CIA field case officer was indeed
"glamorous," he said. The CIA
presence in Africa was eventually
ruled unnecessary and it was or
dered to leave Africa. Rather than
leave, the CIA increased its num
ber of stations to support the "hard
target" program.

That program, presented to the
State Department, the White
House and Congress, was crucial
"to recruit key KGB and Chinese
officials as CIA informants,"
Stockwell said. "A friend told me
later that the whole point of the
'hard target' program was to
maintain CIA influence in Africa."
In addition, prostitutes were
hired, under the title of special
access agents, to sleep with Soviet
and Chinese embassy officials.
"One special access agent cost
$28,000 in taxpayer money to tell
us information that we already
knew," he said.
Stockwell then became chief of
station in Vietnam in 1973, where
