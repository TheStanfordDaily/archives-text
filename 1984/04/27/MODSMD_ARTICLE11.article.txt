## Students write most well-read book on campus 
### LESLIE SVALSTAD 
While practically no one
reads all his Western Culture
books, and tew finish every
thing for Freshman English,
there is one book which
nearly all Stanford students
explore in-depth: "Ap
proaching Stanford."
"There is a certain person
ality to 'Approaching Stan
ford.' It's a combination of
the pictures and the little
quotes," said freshman Jeff
Dort. "I think the picture of
mud football really clinched
it for me."
An informational publica
tion from which incoming
students choose their West
ern C ulture and Freshman
English choices, "Ap
proaching Stanford" is
not just Stanford rhetoric. It
also includes pictures, a glos
sary of college lingo,
humorous quotes and infor
mation helpful for incoming
students. It has been labeled
by some as "the veritable
gospel of the freshman
class."
The underlying enthusi
asm in the student-produced
publication makes freshmen
especially attracted to it."I
remember carrying it around
the pool along with my high
lighter for over two weeks,"
said freshman Wendy Hart.
"I even took notes on this
one part," said Dort.
Vet behind this energetic,
humorous depiction of col
lege life stands a group of
nine student editors, Staff

Coordinator Kathy
Thoelecke and faculty spon
sor Carolyn Lougee.
Working together, they try to
create a total picture of the
University.
Each autumn, 50-100

prospective editors interview
and submit a writing sample
or possible quotes for
"Approaching Stanford."
According to Thoelecke,
who selects the staff, the
quote option serves two

purposes. "It shows how in
ventive people are and gives
us the good quotes we need,"
she said.
Because of the high num
ber of well-qualified appli
cants, the hardest part of the

year-long project is choosing
the staff, Thoelecke said. In
selecting, she strives for cul
tural, academic and geogra
phical diversity. This year's
staff, for instance, consists of
a senior in medical school, an

English major, a co-term stu
dent and one freshman, to
name a few.
Before 1978, however,
freshman alone composed
the staff and received three
units of credit from SCIRE.
But in order to get a different
perspective and gain insight
from older, more experi
enced students, the coordin
ators expanded the applicant
pool.
For students, the project is
completely voluntary, but to
most, it is well worth the time
and effort. "During winter
quarter, it's just like having a
three-unit class. We also
spent part of spring break
finishing up layouts," said
Carol Cini, a student editor.
"The staff really builds up a
rapport."
"We (the student editors)
rewrite the whole thing from
scratch, taking into consider
ation what has been effective
in the past," said Jack Chin,
photo and design editor and
a second-year staffer. "There
might be a tendency just to
read the quotes. Our hope is
that people will read it all."
Though the publication of
"Approaching Stanford"
costs $10,000-$ 12,000 per
year, Thoelecke feels the
book is a necessary part of
the orientation process.
"There are a lot of people
concerned about what they
will find here," said
Thoelecke. "They need to
know resources. 'Ap
proaching Stanford' meets
this need."
