## The 						Stanford Daily Gary Hart for president 
### 
Since its founding, this country has been a
model of progress, adapting to changing eco
nomic, social and international conditions to
remain the leading exponent of freedom and
higher ideals. Today the United States is in a rut,
stymied by unjust laissez-faire and inefficient
welfare state economic programs and by a
militaristic foreign policy which ignores the devel
opment and needs of more than a third of the
world. The presidential election provides a
needed opportunity for change, and the candidate
to lead America forward again is Gary Hart.
The senator from Colorado is the only can
didate in the race with the combination of experi
ence. pragmatism and vision to lead this country
into the future. The press and polls have become
so obsessed with asking "Where's the beef?" that
they have not sought the answer. The beet is
there.
First, Gary Hart has the qualities to foster
change. He has 10 years experience in the U.S.
Senate, where he maintained an independent
mind and struggled for reform. He is young, intel
ligent and articulate. He has reached out to top
academics and practitioners for ideas, and he
would bring a group of energetic and fresh ex
perts to the White House. Like a Lincoln,
Roosevelt or Kennedy, he has the mix of realism
and idealism that can make him a successful
leader of reform.
Hart also has new ideas. He rejects
Reaganomics for its cruelty to the disadvantaged

of our society, and he rejects the worn and wob
bling New Deal economics. Hart proposes a
domestic policy to meet the demands of a chang
ing economy. Mis plan includes cutting the deficit
by eliminating government handouts to corpora
tions and targeting government spending to the
needy. He supports new investments in education
and worker training, and proposes more worker
participation in management.
Moreover, Hart is a student of modern
history. Unlike those who cling to an anachronis
tic view that the world is split into two camps, one
good, one evil. Hart recognizes the special needs
of the developing countries and proposes to wage
' war with food and medicine rather than guns. As
a recognized expert on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, he has fought against the
wastefulness and insanity of large-scale nuclear
weapons, and he proposes instead improvements
in conventional forces to maintain deterrence and
peace. He understands the need to sit down and
talk with other world leaders, rather than com
municate through Cold War propaganda.
Finally, Hart can be elected. He attracts
support from all over the political spectrum, and
does best among the largest bloc — those be
tween the two extremes. A Hart presidency
would replace old labels of liberal and conserva
tive with new definitions, so that those who care
about peace, civil rights and the hungry can also
support economic freedom and efficiency.
