## Grad housing not affordable 
### 
I would like to draw your attention
to a problem which concerns survival
for many graduate students at Stan
ford University. It involves the unrea
sonable rent increases that have been
proposed for the residents of Escon
dido Village. The housing administra
tion seems to have followed this policy
of increments, which are more than
twice the rate of inflation, throughout
the past few years. Furthermore, it

VIEWPOINT

promises to continue until the debt ac
cumulated in building luxurious
Governor's Corner is repaid. I under
stand the simple economic necessity of
paying one's bills. In fact, it is
precisely that need which brings me to
write this letter. I propose, however,
that the funds for repaying the debt be
found elsewhere, not from the already
overtaxed residents of the graduate
student community.
I believe the proposed rent increase
is a very important issue for two
reasons. The first concerns the per
sonal well-being of my family, and
that of many of my friends and col
leagues; the other concerns the quality
of education at this university. Stan
ford's reputation is worldwide. The
opportunity to work and study with
researchers who are leaders in their
fields draws bright students from all
parts of the United States and many
other countries as well. Often, these
people come with scholarships: They
have the opportunity to study
anywhere — and they come to Stan
ford.
However, as rent continues to in
crease well beyond the housing costs
at other universities, those bright
graduate students are choosing to
study elsewhere, and the quality ot
education, research and teaching at
Stanford will suffer. Five students
from my undergraduate university —
all exceptional people — considered

coming to Stanford, but they changed
their minds when 1 told them my story.
Only the rich will be able to afford to
live here. There will still be plenty of
students, but they will be people less
qualified than now. and Stanford's
name will cease to be associated with
the nation's best graduates.
The personal well-being of individ
uals is also at stake. When 1 was of
fered the opportunity to enter a Ph.D.
program at Stanford, 1 carefully col
lected all sorts of information about
living expenses in this community, and
prepared a budget. Because I am a
Canadian. 1 am not allowed to work
outside the University. 1 am a single
mother, so 1 have no spouse to support
my two small children. In addition to
the usual expenses of a student, I have
child care costs and additional health
insurance.
Before accepting the offer from
Stanford, I carefully planned my
budget, including the inflationary in
creases of 7 percent per year, in order
that my scholarship, stipend and
savings would support us for the full
five years of my program. Once again,
in June. 1983. before leaving my home
in Canada, I requested information
from the housing office concerning
rent and any proposed rent increases,
and was told that my apartment would
cost $430 per month and that in
creases had not yet been determined.
When I arrived in August, 1983, I was
horrified to learn that the increase had
indeed been determined: It would rise
in just two weeks to $504 per monfh!
The presently proposed increase will
bring my bill to $590 — a jump of 37
percent over my first rent payment
eight months ago. We don't live ex
travagantly. At present, our family
food budget is $50 per month. I just
cannot cut it any closer. If the rent in
creases at the same rate in 1985 we
simply will not be able to survive; I
will have to quit school.
Most of the people in the Stanford

administration that I have met and
spoken with are sympathetic. Some
have helped to make things easier in
small ways. But the fact remains that I
feel cheated and lied to. I gave up
many opportunities to study at other
universities where my scholarship and
stipend would have been more than
adequate for a good standard of living.
1 based my decision on the premise
that the rent would increase only as
much as inflation, and now I find that
my children and I are locked into rent
increases that are slowly starving us. I
don't mean to imply that the Univer
sity has responsibility for feeding my
children — that belongs to me alone.
But, the University is responsible
for providing correct and complete in
formation to its prospective students,
and for living up to that information.
We should not be made to suffer large
increases, determined without our
knowledge, and implemented after
our arrival. 1 am not the only student
in this position: Many other residents
of Escondido Village would tell stories
that differ only in details.
This rent issue is a great problem to
all of us — to the administration as
well as to the students of Stanford. 1
believe a reasonable solution can be
found. 1 propose:
• That rent increase only as much as
the rate of inflation.
• That rent at Stanford be comparable
to housing costs at other universities
across the country, regardless of the
market rate in Palo Alto.
• That present and future residence
construction projects be funded by
donations from Stanford's alumni and
friends.
I implore the administrators respon
sible for the academic and financial
well-being of Stanford University to
reconsider, before they do permanent
harm to my future, and to the future of
education at this fine institution.

our arrival. 1 am not the only student
in this position: Many other residents
of Escondido Village would tell stories
that differ only in details.
This rent issue is a great problem to
all of us — to the administration as
well as to the students of Stanford. 1
believe a reasonable solution can be
found. 1 propose:
• That rent increase only as much as
the rate of inflation.
• That rent at Stanford be comparable
to housing costs at other universities
across the country, regardless of the
market rate in Palo Alto.
• That present and future residence
construction projects be funded by
donations from Stanford's alumni and
friends.
I implore the administrators respon
sible for the academic and financial
well-being of Stanford University to
reconsider, before they do permanent
harm to my future, and to the future of
education at this fine institution.

I would like to draw your attention
to a problem which concerns survival
for many graduate students at Stan
ford University. It involves the unrea
sonable rent increases that have been
proposed for the residents of Escon
dido Village. The housing administra
tion seems to have followed this policy
of increments, which are more than
twice the rate of inflation, throughout
the past few years. Furthermore, it

VIEWPOINT

promises to continue until the debt ac
cumulated in building luxurious
Governor's Corner is repaid. I under
stand the simple economic necessity of
paying one's bills. In fact, it is
precisely that need which brings me to
write this letter. I propose, however,
that the funds for repaying the debt be
found elsewhere, not from the already
overtaxed residents of the graduate
student community.
I believe the proposed rent increase
is a very important issue for two
reasons. The first concerns the per
sonal well-being of my family, and
that of many of my friends and col
leagues; the other concerns the quality
of education at this university. Stan
ford's reputation is worldwide. The
opportunity to work and study with
researchers who are leaders in their
fields draws bright students from all
parts of the United States and many
other countries as well. Often, these
people come with scholarships: They
have the opportunity to study
anywhere — and they come to Stan
ford.
However, as rent continues to in
crease well beyond the housing costs
at other universities, those bright
graduate students are choosing to
study elsewhere, and the quality ot
education, research and teaching at
Stanford will suffer. Five students
from my undergraduate university —
all exceptional people — considered

coming to Stanford, but they changed
their minds when 1 told them my story.
Only the rich will be able to afford to
live here. There will still be plenty of
students, but they will be people less
qualified than now. and Stanford's
name will cease to be associated with
the nation's best graduates.
The personal well-being of individ
uals is also at stake. When 1 was of
fered the opportunity to enter a Ph.D.
program at Stanford, 1 carefully col
lected all sorts of information about
living expenses in this community, and
prepared a budget. Because I am a
Canadian. 1 am not allowed to work
outside the University. 1 am a single
mother, so 1 have no spouse to support
my two small children. In addition to
the usual expenses of a student, I have
child care costs and additional health
insurance.
Before accepting the offer from
Stanford, I carefully planned my
budget, including the inflationary in
creases of 7 percent per year, in order
that my scholarship, stipend and
savings would support us for the full
five years of my program. Once again,
in June. 1983. before leaving my home
in Canada, I requested information
from the housing office concerning
rent and any proposed rent increases,
and was told that my apartment would
cost $430 per month and that in
creases had not yet been determined.
When I arrived in August, 1983, I was
horrified to learn that the increase had
indeed been determined: It would rise
in just two weeks to $504 per monfh!
The presently proposed increase will
bring my bill to $590 — a jump of 37
percent over my first rent payment
eight months ago. We don't live ex
travagantly. At present, our family
food budget is $50 per month. I just
cannot cut it any closer. If the rent in
creases at the same rate in 1985 we
simply will not be able to survive; I
will have to quit school.
Most of the people in the Stanford

administration that I have met and
spoken with are sympathetic. Some
have helped to make things easier in
small ways. But the fact remains that I
feel cheated and lied to. I gave up
many opportunities to study at other
universities where my scholarship and
stipend would have been more than
adequate for a good standard of living.
1 based my decision on the premise
that the rent would increase only as
much as inflation, and now I find that
my children and I are locked into rent
increases that are slowly starving us. I
don't mean to imply that the Univer
sity has responsibility for feeding my
children — that belongs to me alone.
But, the University is responsible
for providing correct and complete in
formation to its prospective students,
and for living up to that information.
We should not be made to suffer large
increases, determined without our
knowledge, and implemented after
our arrival. 1 am not the only student
in this position: Many other residents
of Escondido Village would tell stories
that differ only in details.
This rent issue is a great problem to
all of us — to the administration as
well as to the students of Stanford. 1
believe a reasonable solution can be

the rate of inflation.
• That rent at Stanford be comparable

across the country, regardless of the
