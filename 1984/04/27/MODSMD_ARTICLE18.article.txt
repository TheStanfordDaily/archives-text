# Out with Reagan, in with justice
## 
### 
During the last three and a halt years the
Reagan administration and the entire Republican
party have done more to frighten, worry and
thoroughly embarrass me than any one group,
movie or freak show I have ever witnessed. No
horror film, no Ripley's tale, nor any two-headed
dog in the circus can compare to the monstrous
acts of the present executive branch. Daily these
people cast insults and grief upon the head of every
American who believes in truth, honesty and equal
opportunity. We are lied to. we are pushed aside
and we are denied our basic rights by a man we
hired to serve us and to look after our interests. I
oppose the politics of today's administration. I can
no longer sit by and simply hope things get better.
When looking over the list of Reagan atrocities,
the most recent act can be called nothing less than
a kick in the knee to world order and a stab in the
back to American integrity. Of course, I am
addressing the mining of harbors in Central
America. President Reagan and the CIA had no
right to tamper with or destroy the waterways of
another country. I am positive that the United
States exports and imports goods and supplies that
other countries feel "threaten" their security; yet
no nation would dare mine our harbors. Reagan
destroyed Nicaragua's harbors because he knew he
could get away with it. He knew Nicaragua was
helpless to stop him and also helpless to retaliate
against him. His imperialistic actions embarrassed
this country before the world, and they
jeopardized future peace in Central America.
But equally as embarrassing and decadent as the
mining were Reagan's maneuvers when the truth
was finally revealed. Did he quickly admit the min

ing after we all knew? NO! Did he hold a big press
conference and answer questions about it? NO! In
stead of facing the matter, Reagan carried on as if
nothing had happened.
He refused to answer questions about Nicaragua
when asked, and he showed no interest in the
opinions of U.S. citizens. Reagan even rejected the
jurisdiction of the World Court, a body that the
United States pushed for in an attempt to avoid in
ternational conflict and to preserve world peace.
Because of his evasiveness and apparent contempt
for international law. I no longer believe he is in
terested in peace. Reagan seems to have graduated
first in his class from the school of "might makes
right," and he must be stopped before he uses our
might to make us all dead.
Reagan's domestic policies have moved beyond
being insulting. They are ugly and grotesque. The
president, a man who supposedly fights for and
represents all citizens of this country, is not doing
his job. A president who can say that hunger does
not exist in America is a president who can ignore
the truth and cause people to suffer. A president
who can call ketchup a vegetable, but has yet to
serve it at the White House instead of tomatoes or
corn, is a man who can set a double standard and
still sleep at night. A president who can tly to
China in order to strengthen relations and progress
before he sits down with leaders from the ghettos,
barrios, the reservations and all poverty areas is a
president who cares more about his image than he
does about his people. Reagan is such a president.
He has practically called anyone who cries "I'm
hungry" a liar and has belittled millions of
Americans who are forced to live on welfare until

more jobs are available.
Reagan and his officials have food and money
and more food and more money. As the Republi
can commercials have stated, they like the direc
tion of this country and want things to remain the
same. 1 sincerely believe they will fight relentlessly
to maintain their grip on the necks of the poor.
When I first saw the commercials, I was amazed at
the way in which they dodged the truth. After
watching them a number of times. I became deter
mined to do everything I can to fight against them.
I do not want things to stay on this Reaganomic
road when women earn only two-thirds as much as
men do while doing the same job. I cannot applaud
this president as long as old people must eat pet
food and freeze in the winter. 1 cannot hail
Reagan as long as he interferes in the politics of
other nations and ignores the poor of this one.
There should be no first and second class citizens
in the country. The people who believe in Reagan
and his ways have challenged those who oppose
them to try and "ruin" their "good life."
Whenever the "good life" of a lew means the
misery of the masses, policies must change. All
citizens are entitled to food, work and a certain
amount of comfort. Reagan is hyperactive on is
sues concerning weapons, but very much asleep
when it come to the social and health needs of
minorities, women and the poor. Reagan and his
party have not gotten out of bed in almost four
years. He does not work for all of America and I
am completely in favor of putting him out of the
White House.

China in order to strengthen relations and progress
before he sits down with leaders from the ghettos,
barrios, the reservations and all poverty areas is a
president who cares more about his image than he
does about his people. Reagan is such a president.
He has practically called anyone who cries "I'm
hungry" a liar and has belittled millions of
Americans who are forced to live on welfare until

more jobs are available.
Reagan and his officials have food and money
and more food and more money. As the Republi
can commercials have stated, they like the direc
tion of this country and want things to remain the
same. 1 sincerely believe they will fight relentlessly
to maintain their grip on the necks of the poor.
When I first saw the commercials, I was amazed at
the way in which they dodged the truth. After
watching them a number of times. I became deter
mined to do everything I can to fight against them.
I do not want things to stay on this Reaganomic
road when women earn only two-thirds as much as
men do while doing the same job. I cannot applaud
this president as long as old people must eat pet
food and freeze in the winter. 1 cannot hail
Reagan as long as he interferes in the politics of
other nations and ignores the poor of this one.
There should be no first and second class citizens
in the country. The people who believe in Reagan
and his ways have challenged those who oppose
them to try and "ruin" their "good life."
Whenever the "good life" of a lew means the
misery of the masses, policies must change. All
citizens are entitled to food, work and a certain
amount of comfort. Reagan is hyperactive on is
sues concerning weapons, but very much asleep
when it come to the social and health needs of
minorities, women and the poor. Reagan and his
party have not gotten out of bed in almost four
years. He does not work for all of America and I
am completely in favor of putting him out of the
White House.
