New York — University President
Donald Kennedy, along with about 60
Stanford faculty members, arrived
here yesterday to begin a four-day
conference on "Life in the 20th Cen
tury."
The conference, called "an invasion
of New York by Palo Alto," by coord
inator and Stanford alumnus Ralph
Davidson, is an effort by the Univer
sity to reach out to the estimated
10,000 to 12,000 Stanford alumni and
parents in the New York area. About
2000 alumni and parents are expected

to attend the speeches, roundtable dis
cussions and panels led by Stanford
faculty members.
The four-dav conference will in
clude programs by the Graduate
School of Business, the School of En
gineering and Stanford libraries. On
Sunday, the Athletic Department will
host a brunch for those brave enough
to run through Central Park with Ken
nedy.
According to Kennedy, the confer
ence is the first of its kind ever to be
held in the East. "We do have some
thing like this every year in Los An
geles, but it's much smaller — we

bring about six or eight faculty mem
bers down," he said.
Kennedy explained that the confer
ence was designed to draw attention to
the University not only from East
Coast parents and alumni but also
from the local media and the "thought
leaders of the East."
"We want people to recognize that
Stanford is internationally renowned
and that we are at the top of the intel
lectual tree," Kennedy said.
Stanford has paid little attention to
the hast Coast in recent years, at least
from the development angle; Stan
lord's New ork development office,
the only one the University estab
lished in the East, was closed four
years ago. Although Kennedy would
not say whether there is any direct
connection between the conference
and a reopening of the East Coast de
velopment office, he commented, "If
there is a very positive response to this
conference it is something we might
consider." He also said the alumni
club plans to "drum up activity" in
New York after the conference.
