## Sexism rampant in Daily's policies 
### 
In your article on faculty couples
(Daily, April 17). you refer to the
men as "professor" and the women as
"Mrs." At first we had trouble decid
ing whether your editorial policy was
deliberately sexist or an archaic form
of "respect" for women.
We surmised that respect clearly
does not lie behind your peculiar way
of referring to women on the faculty,
for you also describe women who
have achieved tenure and faculty
couples who find jobs on the same or
neighboring campuses as "lucky," as
though fate had given them their
jobs, not clear achievement.
It's more than a pity that in that
same issue The Daily came out

against a student fee assessment tor
the Women's Center and that the
vote also went against that vital activ -
ity With other campus groups, such
as Feminist Studies and the Center
lor Research 011 Women, the Wo
men's Center can help to bring The
Daily out of the sexist dark ages
suggested in your use of asymmetrical
forms of address.

Editor's note: In the article men
tioned above, The Daily was placed in
the awkward position of having to
attribute (/notations from husbands
and wives who are both professors.
The Daily 's usual style when quoting
someone is to refer to the last name of
the person, but in this case using
simply the last name would have been
confusing and incomplete. The
intended remedy was to use
"Mr." and "Mrs." before the
names of the people (/noted, but due to
editing errors this format was not
implemented. The Daily regrets the error.
