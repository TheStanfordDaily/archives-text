## Revolution unlikely in Mexico 
### 
Under the headline, "Mexico: Will change be wrought
by revolution?" (Daily, April 14). Prof. Ronald Hilton ex
pressed a rather anecdotal view of Mexico's current situa
tion. In spite of the dramatism which pervades the article
(which we can take to be a rhetorical resource), Hilton cor
rectly points out some of the problems of contemporary
Mexico. Nevertheless, he also suggests some interpreta-

VIEWPOINT

tions which do not seem to be adequate.
First, Hilton claims that "there is deep conflict between
revolutionary Mexico and Catholic conservative Mexico,"
and asks whether this conflict will "burst into war as it did
in Spain," suggesting that there is a "chilling parallel with
Spain just before the Spanish civil war." Now, what does
Hilton mean by "revolutionary Mexico?"
He mentions the universities, which he considers to be
"radical enclaves," as well as the area south of an imagi
nary line drawn from Veracruz to the Pacific through
Mexico City; this area, he says, is "revolutionary Mexico."
Leaving aside the facts that Mexican universities (with
very few exceptions) are much more pluralistic and open
than what Hilton would make us believe and that the
"area south" of the imaginary line is quite heterogeneous,
we can understand the point that the poorer part of the
country is more likely to suffer from social unrest. Indeed,
the peasants (campesinos) of that area are quite poor and
there have been local political problems in a small city of
the State of Oaxoca (Juchitan). But this does not mean
that the poor campesinos of southeast Mexico use "left
wing parties like the United Socialist Party (USP. the core
of which is communist) to attack the PRI (Partido
Revolucionario Institucional)." The USP is a ridiculously
minor party (receiving about five percent of the vote in
19H2) that has no influence among the "masses," and the
"radical enclaves" have no relation whatsoever with the
campesinos! The campesinos do not know anything about
communism or confrontations with "Catholic conservative
Mexico": As a matter of fact, they are the most important
part of "Catholic conservative Mexico' and the only thing
they want is land (or respect for their land) and basic
health and educational services.
Hilton says that "both Mexicos" resent the U.S. role in
Central America, "which they view as Mexico's back
yard." This is not correct. First, the fact that some
Americans view the countries south of the American bor

der as the United States' backyard should not suggest that
Mexicans in general do the same with respect to the
countries at the south of the Mexican border. No historical
analogy can be traced in this case. In the second place, it is
not surprising to see the (small) leftist groups opposing the
U.S. role in Central America, but you do not have to be a
communist in order to feel serious doubts regarding the
wisdom of that role.
Hilton claims that in "revolutionary Mexico, some fear
that part of the north will secede and join the United
States." Well, this is simply preposterous. I had never
heard anything like that before in my life. Practically
nobody in Mexico would think of doing such a thing.
Rather, what some Mexicans tear (1 hope unjustifiably) is
that the United States could take yet another bite out of
Mexico, but this is a very different story. We admire some
good things of the United States. But that is all. We would
like to have an all-Mexican prosperous country with good
friends in the north. Why do some Americans have diffi
culty understanding this notion?
I do not see any parallel with Spain before the civil war
and not even with El Salvador "when the revolutionary
winds began blowing from Nicaragua." I would say that it
is rather exaggerated to suggest that there is a revolution
ary crisis in Mexico. True, the prospects arc grim and pop
ulation growth is a real problem. But it is not more grim
than what it has been many times in the past. Even the
Catholic church is beginning to face seriously the problem
of population growth. Of course, a revolution could start
within the next 12 months, because these phenomena have
proven to be unpredictable in Mexico. But 1 do not think
that Mexicans feel like going to a secession war. In any
case, if a revolution starts it will not be due to ideological
or religious reasons because, leaving aside some noisy
socialists in the universities and a few fascists hanging
around, Mexicans do not care about ideologies and there is
no religious conflict at nil in Mexico.
Hilton ends his commentary saying that "whatever
policy we adopt toward Mexico, let's not be saps." I do not
see what is the point of this bravuconada but it sounds like
fear and misunderstanding. The problems of our friends
the Americans is not that they are saps (which I do not
think they are); only that they have not found yet the road
to a better understanding of that complex reality which is
south of the border.

good things of the United States. But that is all. We would
like to have an all-Mexican prosperous country with good
friends in the north. Why do some Americans have diffi
culty understanding this notion?
I do not see any parallel with Spain before the civil war
and not even with El Salvador "when the revolutionary
winds began blowing from Nicaragua." I would say that it
is rather exaggerated to suggest that there is a revolution
ary crisis in Mexico. True, the prospects arc grim and pop
ulation growth is a real problem. But it is not more grim
than what it has been many times in the past. Even the
Catholic church is beginning to face seriously the problem
of population growth. Of course, a revolution could start
within the next 12 months, because these phenomena have
proven to be unpredictable in Mexico. But 1 do not think
that Mexicans feel like going to a secession war. In any
case, if a revolution starts it will not be due to ideological
or religious reasons because, leaving aside some noisy
socialists in the universities and a few fascists hanging
around, Mexicans do not care about ideologies and there is
no religious conflict at nil in Mexico.
Hilton ends his commentary saying that "whatever
policy we adopt toward Mexico, let's not be saps." I do not
see what is the point of this bravuconada but it sounds like
fear and misunderstanding. The problems of our friends
the Americans is not that they are saps (which I do not
think they are); only that they have not found yet the road
to a better understanding of that complex reality which is
south of the border.
