# Asia: less than $3000 and more fun than classes
## 
### STEFFAN LANDAUER 
It you are doing no cartwheels
at the prospect of a nine-to-five
job, another semester of assign
ments and exams or even a
summer fighting the crowds in
Europe, you do have an alterna
tive: Asia.
For a relatively low cost, you
can trek through the Himalaya
mountains of Nepal, travel on
your own in China or relax on a
houseboat in Kashmir. While
others busy themselves note
taking and networking, you
could be cruising down the
Yangtze River, riding a camel
across the deserts of Rajasthan
or swimming to the front door
of your beachfront hut in
Thailand.
But first you must face the
most difficult part of indepen
dent travel in Asia — deciding
to go. Once there, most
travelers find that the concerns
which prevent people from
going to Asia, such as health,
money, language or companion
ship, are in fact relatively minor.
While Asia does pose more
health risks than America or
Europe, with reasonable
precautions the chances of get
ting seriously ill are slim. By
getting vaccinations before you
leave and watching what you eat
and drink, you, like most inde
pendent travelers, will
encounter few problems.
Likewise, money is less of a
problem than you may think.
Unless you choose to travel first
class and stay in luxury hotels, it
is difficult to spend more than
$10 per day on food, accom
modations and transportation
(excluding airfare).
English-speaking travelers
also have a highly marketable
skill and can earn money teach
ing in Japan. Taiwan, Hong Kong
or South Korea. Openings for
English instructors are ad
vertised in newspapers, or you
can ask your fellow travelers
where to look.
Your English will get you by
traveling in any country in Asia,
but you will enjoy yourself more
if you make the effort to learn a
few words of the local language.
As for companionship, if you
don't want to travel alone and
can't find a companion here —

go ahead and go over there.
You'll be certain to meet many
fellow travelers on the road.
There are two types of
travelers — those who travel
light and those who wish they
had. So first lay out everything
you think you "must" take and
then put half of it back. Internal
frame backpacks are the most
convenient luggage to take.
Due to the summer monsoon
season throughout much of
Asia, the best time to travel in
most areas is September
through May. There are a num
ber of intriguing routes, hut
here is one possibility: For
$360, fly from San Francisco to
Hong Kong on China Airlines.
Stay at the Traveler's Hostel on
the 16th floor of Chungking
Mansions where a dormitory

bed costs $2.50 per night. An
individual tourist visa tor China
costs $12 and processing is done
in one day.
Buy a Chinese phrasebook
and learn a few words before

boarding the train to Canton.
Suggestions on where to stay in
each city are included in the

from Beijing you can get a last
train to Shanghai, stopping en
route at Oufu. Confucius'
birthplace. In Shanghai, a three
day cruise back to Hong Kong
(including meals) costs $50.
China is more expensive —
you might have to spend as
much as $ 15 to $20 per day. On
the rest of your trip. $7 per day
will be plenty. In Hong Kong

Thailand or trek through the

Golden Triangle area in the

known as "Little Tibet." Here
you can visit the monasteries
atop the barren Himalayan
slopes of this ancient Buddhist
land, and even sit in on the morn
ing services.
From here, you can continue
to explore Asia, or if you've had
enough, fly home from Delhi for
$600. In four or five months,
you will have had the adventure
of your lifetime for under
$3000, while learning a good
deal about the people and cul
ture of Asia. And chances are,
upon your return they'll still be
offering classes, jobs . . . and
