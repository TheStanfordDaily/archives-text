## Trojans march to Farm; Card nine armed for series 
### ROB ZWEIG 
In case you hadn't heard,
there's a big hall game at Sunken
Diamond this afternoon. And
tomorrow and Sunday too, as the
Stanford baseball team hosts the
No. 7-ranked USC Trojans in a
three-game series that could de
termine which team advances to
the NCAA championship
tournament in May.
The two clubs will go toe-to
toe in a battle for second place
in the Pacific-10 Conference
Southern Division, a battle the
Trojans are currently winning.
At 13-8 in the conference and

37-17 overall, USC is four
games behind the "Six-Pac"
leader Arizona State and one
game ahead of the defending
champion Cardinal, now 12-9 in
league play and 30-20-1 on the
year. Neither club will catch the
front-running Sun Devils, but the
runner-up can claim an at-large
bid to the NCAA Rcgionals*.
A glance at the future reveals
how vital these three contests
are to the Card. Stanford travels
to the Devils' den in Tempe to
play Arizona State next week
and finishes its Pac-10 season
against UC-Berkeley. USC, on

the other hand, closes against
the cellar dwellers — Cal and
cross-town rival UCLA.
"This is the big weekend for
everything to happen," Stanford
Head Coach Mark Marquess
said yesterday. "If you look at
the schedule, USC has a better
chance than we do. I think the
team that's playing the best
baseball in the league is Cal. So
we're playing the three best
teams in the league right now."
But the biggest obstacle to
Stanford's playoff hopes may be
in the person of Mark McGwire,
USC's junior first baseman.

McGwire is on the verge of he
coming the first player in Pac-10
history to win the coveted triple
crown outright. Presently, he
leads the "Six-Pac" in hitting
with a .390 average, in home
runs with 26 and in RBIs with
66. In 1975, USC's Steve
Kemp, currently with the New
York Yankees, won the triple
crown, but tied for the home run
title.
McGwire padded his stats the
last time he saw the Cardinal,
crunching four of the Trojans'
eight home runs in a three-game
sweep of Stanford. "Obviously,
you have to control him,"
Marquess said. "But (Jeff)
Brown (.354, 12 HR's), (Jack)
Del Rio (.359) and (Alby) Sil
vera (.343) are all capable of
beating you. But we don't want
McGwire to beat us. We'll walk
him if a base is open."
USC Head Coach Rod
Dedeaux also has a more than
able pitching corps. Sid Akins
(8-4, 3.13 ERA) Brad Brink (5-
2, 3.87 ERA) and Randy
Robertson (8-3, 4.73 ERA) will
start in that order for the
Trojans. "They were the best
we've faced all year (in Los An
geles)," said Stanford's skipper.
"But they're also capable of get
ting beat, as Arizona and Cal
showed."
Marquess is referring to the
Trojans' recent skid after they
dumped Arizona State twice in
a row. Since then USC has lost
six straight, four in the Pac-10,
and the latest two against non
league weaklings Cal State Los
Angeles and Southern Califor
nia College. The ultimate
barometer, McGwire, reads
much the same — only three
homers since the Stanford se
ries.
On paper, the Cardinal is well
prepped for this week's show
down. The Card has won eight
of its last 10 and five of six in
conference play. Leading the
way is this week's Pac-10 Player
of the Week Darryl Stephens,
who brings a 13-game hitting
streak into the series. The senior
center fielder hit .420 during
that span and is hitting .343 on
the year. He is also tied for the
club lead with six home runs.
First baseman Rick
Lundblade also continues to
swing a hot bat. Lundblade's
RBI total of 53 is second only to
/ McGwire among conference

hitters and he is also hitting
.333. If one adds the team's
leading batter Mike Deßenon
(.348) to the list, it appears that
the Stanford offense is finally
perking.
Marquess disagrees, saying
that the Card has been collect
ing hits but not runs lately. The
Stanford pilot called Monday
night's performance against
Fresno State (four hits and 15
strikeouts) "one of the worst
I've seen since I've been here,"
and said he hopes his club can at
least produce in the clutch situa
tions this weekend.
"We've done that recently.
We came back in the tenth in
ning against Arizona and then
we got the big pinch-hit home

run from (Jeff) Ballard (against
UCLA). We have to hit better if
we want to make a serious run
at (a playoff spot)," Marquess
said.
In any event, all signs point to
the Stanford pitching staff's
ability to stop McGwire & Co.
as being the key to the series.
That is fine with the Cardinal.
Jeff Ballard will climb the hill
today with his sights set on his
third straight complete game
victory. The junior southpaw is
tied for second in the confer
ence in that category with four,
is second in strikeouts with 74
and sports a 6-4 season record.
Senior John Radtke (6-2,
four complete games) will face
the Trojans tomorrow.

Radtke and his 2.87 ERA,
second best in the "Six-Pac,"
will be facing ESPN television
cameras too.
ESPN will be on hand to tape
the 1 p.m. contest and the game
will be rcbroadcast Sunday
night at 5 p.m., as well as twice
on Monday at 12 a.m. and
9 a.m. Free Stanford painters
caps will be given to the first
500 fans in Sunken Diamond.
Finally, it will be Kevin
Kunkel (3-5, 4.45 ERA) on
Sunday. The sophomore has
returned to his early season
form with strong performances
in each of his last four appear
ances.
, The two clubs square off at
; 2:30 p.m. today and I p.m. on
tomorrow and Sunday.

The Card will be back-to-back with the USC Trojans in a three-game series this weekend,
and it will try not to get behind.

Senior Darryl Stephens' on-the-ball batting helped him to gain recognition as this week's
Pac-10 Player of the Week. Stephens has hit .420 in the last 13 games.
