# Netmen play tourney in Ojai

### TOM CLIFFORD 
The season is winding down
for the Stanford men's tennis
team, but the matches are be
coming more important. I he
team is in the middle of the Pac
-10 Championships which are
being held in Ojai, California.
While Arizona. Arizona
State, UCLA. USC, UC-
Berkeley and Stanford (which
are all of the Pac-10 schools that
play tennis) keep team scores,
the matches are mainly for indi
vidual honors.
The Cardinal is currently 17-
5 overall and 6-3 in the Pac-10.
This record puts the Card in the
No. 3 spot in the country While
dual match rankings are impor
tant in determining the seeding
of the NCAA tournament, they
bear no weight in the final deci
sion of the NCAA champion.
Thus, quite simply, the winner
of the tournament is No. I.
Still, Head Coach Dick Gould
said he feels it is very important
to maintain a high ranking.
"Currently, we're third; but it's
a tenuous third," he said.
After the Ojai matches. Pep
perdine University will chal
lenge Stanford for that No. 3
spot. Pepperdine is currently
right behind the Cardinal at No.
4. The match against
the Wave is scheduled for
Wednesday at the Varsity
Courts.
For the past two weekends,
Stanford has gone up against

both No. 1-ranked USC and
No. 2-ranked UCLA. Although
the Cardinal only won one of
the four matches against the
Southern California teams, all
of the individual matches were
extremely close. A swing of a
few points would ii.i\e given the
Cardinal victories.
As Gould pointed out."lf you
play a top team down to the
wire, you're not doing too hadly
yourself." While Stanford's win
loss record is not as impressive
as last year's 23-1. the team's
play should give the Cardinal
confidence.
After Peppcrdine. Stanford
will take on Cal on Friday,
again at the Varsity Courts. On
Saturday, the men's and wo
men's squads will team up and
take on the Bears in World
Team Tennis-style. This match,
which will be played in Maples
Pavilion, will be great from the
fans' perspective, since mixed
matches allow for a tremendous
amount of variety. This will be
the last match before the
NCAA Championships in At
hens, Georgia.
For some unknown reason,
Georgia has become a second
home for the Cardinal. Because
the Championships are always
held there, Stanford has
returned six times in the past
eight years. The Cardinal's
record there is a phenomenal
23-1. "Yeah," Gould said, "I
like playing there."
