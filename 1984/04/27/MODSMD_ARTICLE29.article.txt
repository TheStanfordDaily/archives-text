Pedro Arrupe, superior general of
the Jesuits for many years, remarked
in the mid-1970s that the church was
stormily experiencing an era of
profound change, hut he added with
obvious satisfaction that "a time of
great change is also a time of chal
lenge." "Medicine: the State of the
Art" presents for the public the great
changes that a technological revolu

medical care; authors Charles Mangel

I and Allen B. Weisse, however, do not see
I the coming decade as a time of chal-
I lenge. Compared with the recent

I nomic or ethical surveys down to

I riences), fhe forecasts in their book
K are written from a different perspec
b tive. The perspective is that of un
v tainted and all-inclusive optimism.
in any thoughtful description of the
modern medical system, the issues of
Hi change and challenge must be tightly
intertwined. The greatest challenges
are gathering at the intersection of
economic and ethical issues, as two
current announcements indicate. An
editorial in the leading British medical
journal notes tersely that "between
2000 and 3000 people die yearly in
the U.K. from renal failure and many
of these deaths are unnecessary;" they
are attributed to an inadequate supply
* of technical care. Former Secretary of
I lealth Joseph Califano recently told a
San Francisco conference that health
. insurance already accounts for over
$000 of the price of a new Chrysler, a
figure that is continually rising as our
national health expenditures rush past
$ I billion a day.
It may seem tempting to react
against the technology laid out in
"State of the Art" by casting on it the
full yoke of guilt for crises measured in

thousands of lives unnecessarily lost
and in billions of dollars paid out. But
one must ask to just what extent these
sorts of problems are to be linked with
the specific technological revolutions
described by Mangel and Weisse.
One approach is to separate our
ethical and economic medical prob
lems into three largely independent
areas, designated as classic, chronic
and revolutionary medical care. We
can place under "classic" care the
familiar range of services from vacci
nations and antibiotics to most diag
nostic services, deliveries and most
surgical procedures. Objections raised
to rapidly rising costs in these areas
mainly center on payment structure,
what economist Paul Menzel has
labeled as built-in incentives for
"providers to prescribe care and for
patients to use it, even when its
benefits approach zero." Because
Mangel and Weisse describe only
procedures with dramatic and immed
iate effects on the patient's condition,
their work lies entirely outside of this
first category, whose problems can
only be controlled by a brave, essen
tially socio-political restructuring of
the overall health card, system.
The second area, chronic care, is
also a field with pressing ethical and
economic issues. While overall costs
have skyrocketed, total nursing home
costs have increased even faster,
growing four-fold in their share of
total medical costs between 1960 and
1978. However, as Stanford Econom
ics Prof. Victor Fuchs has pointed out,
many nursing home costs are not
medical in the term's true sense, and
in part represent a social shift of the
elderly from family care to nursing in
stitutions; further, the demographic
boom in the over-70 population was

clear long before development of the
technologies described in "State of the
Art" began. Similarly, the much
discussed ethical issues in the in
definite prolongation of life largely
involve the application of relatively
"low-tech" and conventional
procedures to the continuum from
major brain damage (in numbers, this

is overwhelmingly age-related types
like Alzheimer's disease) to actual
brain death.
What kind of problems, then,
emerge in the changes and challenges
of the blossoming third category,
"revolutionary" medical change?
Mangel and Weisse describe dramatic
new developments in a wide range of
clinical areas, from neonatology to
cancer therapy, from CT scans to or
gan transplants. Their discussions,
which are usually both clear and accu-

rate, mix presentations of typical
patients (from the first vague pain to
the awful diagnosis to the total cure)
with readable descriptions of the biol
ogy and technology involved. Even
when the authors visit the ultimate
tertiary care centers, Sloan-Kettering
in New York or St. Jude's in Ken
tucky, everyone they meet is getting
better. (After reading these dozens of
patient histories, one will feel vaguely
disconcerted by cases like your Uncle
Charlie, who last year just got cancer
and went to a major hospital and
died.)
Viewing this book as a whole, with
respect to social challenges, we can
sort out two kinds of technological ad
vances in medicine. The first is ex
emplified by computerized
tomography, the CT scan, which al
lows a series of "slice" views of the
head or abdomen. When first intro
duced 10 years ago, CT scanners were
criticized as intolerably expensive
devices presenting only very few uses
which could justify their application.
Today, the machines are widely used
for an extensive range of diagnostic
services and their one-time purchase
cost has rapidly fallen with increased
production; further, the cost of a CT
scan can replace many invasive diag
nostic surgical procedures.
Nonetheless, there is a fly in
medicine's new technological oint
ment, and it is a very, very large fly.
Unlike CT scans, we can see that a
second class of the new technological
treatments described in "State of the
Art" are in very limited supply and are
very expensive. There might seem to
be straightforward historical prece
dent for this, in the years needed to
provide widespread distribution of in
sulin after its purification in 1922, or
in the time needed to scale-up to na
tional production of polio vaccine
after its discovery in the early '50s.
But these advances and others, like
antibiotics, showed promise, relatively
early on, of becoming widely available

to people who would otherwise die. In
sharp contrast, it is very uncertain that
advances like lung transplants will
ever approach the necessary supply,
and virtually certain that even when
advances like liver transplants become
technically practical, they will remain
very expensive.
1 argue that, to a significant degree,
these developments raise genuinely

new challenges, though many — cer
tainly, Mangel and Weisse — do not
treat them as such. In a brief epilogue
which is less an afterword than a disor
ganized afterthought, they allude to
the need for reform of the medical
cost system, using arguments not
much different from those expressed
in the 1912 movements in several
states for compulsory health insur

ance, or by the 1928 national Com
mittee on the Cost of Medical Care
(chaired by Stanford President Ray
Lyman Wilbur). The arguments have
remained the same while the problems
have undergone drastic transforma
tion into new problems bearing little
resemblance to the old. For example,
the CCMC could show the direct
benefits of costs toward improved
sanitation in terms of man-hour
dollars of worker productivity. Cru
cially, when individual medical costs
become very high, it becomes clear
that this is a non-symmetric argu
ment: Human-hour-dollars clearly define
only a lower limit, not an upper one,
to costs. Quite unlike insurance for a
car or a house, with human life there is
no simple upper limit exactly bounded
by replacement cost. Yet it is clear
that we are now approaching such a
limit with some procedures, as
evidenced by reported current recon
sideration by Medi-Cal to revise
downward its present policy to finance
liver transplants. The policy was in
stituted last year after the telexed spec
tacle of tearful parents pleading for
donations to save their childrens' lives.
What is to be done? Possibly, the
existence of effective, though expen
sive, medical procedures will provide
additional incentive for the re
allocation of funds already within the
medical system away from procedures
with the least relative benefit (the
problem cited by Menzel, above).
Preventive medicine is another
relatively untapped area. Recent sta
tistics indicate that of 1000 young men
who smoke, one will be murdered, six
will be killed in auto accidents, and
250 will die of smoking-related
causes. A few slickly-produced Super
Bowl commercials showing a colorful
autopsy of a 40-year-old lung cancer
victim would be cost-effective in terms
of dollars eventually saved in cancer
treatment, even if only a few dozen
viewers quit. Finally, in their epilogue
the authors mention indirectly that
since 1945, the earning power of
registered nurses relative to physicians
has dropped by 50 percent. However,
such effects of a relative undersupply
of physicians (first pointed out in Mil
ton Friedman's Ph.D. thesis in 1937)
may be coming to an end. The change
will be a great deal more dramatic if,
as Harvard sociologist Paul Starr
predicts, the increasing corporatiza
tion of medicine transforms this over
supply of physicians into an actual
shortage of physician jobs.
In summary, "Medicine: the State
of the Art" provides a good overview
of the technological changes that are
affecting modern American health
care. But the relentlessly cheery and
mellow tone, which makes it hard to
believe the authors are not from Cali
fornia, carries the risk of missing the
problems and pressures for social
change inherent in many of the
wonders they describe.

ethical and economic medical prob
lems into three largely independent
areas, designated as classic, chronic
and revolutionary medical care. We
can place under "classic" care the
familiar range of services from vacci
nations and antibiotics to most diag
nostic services, deliveries and most
surgical procedures. Objections raised
to rapidly rising costs in these areas
mainly center on payment structure,
what economist Paul Menzel has
labeled as built-in incentives for
"providers to prescribe care and for
patients to use it, even when its
benefits approach zero." Because
Mangel and Weisse describe only
procedures with dramatic and immed
iate effects on the patient's condition,
their work lies entirely outside of this
first category, whose problems can
only be controlled by a brave, essen
tially socio-political restructuring of
the overall health card, system.
The second area, chronic care, is
also a field with pressing ethical and
economic issues. While overall costs
have skyrocketed, total nursing home
costs have increased even faster,
growing four-fold in their share of
total medical costs between 1960 and
1978. However, as Stanford Econom
ics Prof. Victor Fuchs has pointed out,
many nursing home costs are not
medical in the term's true sense, and
in part represent a social shift of the
elderly from family care to nursing in
stitutions; further, the demographic
boom in the over-70 population was

clear long before development of the
technologies described in "State of the
Art" began. Similarly, the much
discussed ethical issues in the in
definite prolongation of life largely
involve the application of relatively
"low-tech" and conventional
procedures to the continuum from
major brain damage (in numbers, this

is overwhelmingly age-related types
like Alzheimer's disease) to actual
brain death.
What kind of problems, then,
emerge in the changes and challenges
of the blossoming third category,
"revolutionary" medical change?
Mangel and Weisse describe dramatic
new developments in a wide range of
clinical areas, from neonatology to
cancer therapy, from CT scans to or
gan transplants. Their discussions,
which are usually both clear and accu-

rate, mix presentations of typical
patients (from the first vague pain to
the awful diagnosis to the total cure)
with readable descriptions of the biol
ogy and technology involved. Even
when the authors visit the ultimate
tertiary care centers, Sloan-Kettering
in New York or St. Jude's in Ken
tucky, everyone they meet is getting
better. (After reading these dozens of
patient histories, one will feel vaguely
disconcerted by cases like your Uncle
Charlie, who last year just got cancer
and went to a major hospital and
died.)
Viewing this book as a whole, with
respect to social challenges, we can
sort out two kinds of technological ad
vances in medicine. The first is ex
emplified by computerized
tomography, the CT scan, which al
lows a series of "slice" views of the
head or abdomen. When first intro
duced 10 years ago, CT scanners were
criticized as intolerably expensive
devices presenting only very few uses
which could justify their application.
Today, the machines are widely used
for an extensive range of diagnostic
services and their one-time purchase
cost has rapidly fallen with increased
production; further, the cost of a CT
scan can replace many invasive diag
nostic surgical procedures.
Nonetheless, there is a fly in
medicine's new technological oint
ment, and it is a very, very large fly.
Unlike CT scans, we can see that a
second class of the new technological
treatments described in "State of the
Art" are in very limited supply and are
very expensive. There might seem to
be straightforward historical prece
dent for this, in the years needed to
provide widespread distribution of in
sulin after its purification in 1922, or
in the time needed to scale-up to na
tional production of polio vaccine
after its discovery in the early '50s.
But these advances and others, like
antibiotics, showed promise, relatively
early on, of becoming widely available

to people who would otherwise die. In
sharp contrast, it is very uncertain that
advances like lung transplants will
ever approach the necessary supply,
and virtually certain that even when
advances like liver transplants become
technically practical, they will remain
very expensive.
1 argue that, to a significant degree,
these developments raise genuinely

new challenges, though many — cer
tainly, Mangel and Weisse — do not
treat them as such. In a brief epilogue
which is less an afterword than a disor
ganized afterthought, they allude to
the need for reform of the medical
cost system, using arguments not
much different from those expressed
in the 1912 movements in several
states for compulsory health insur

ance, or by the 1928 national Com
mittee on the Cost of Medical Care
(chaired by Stanford President Ray
Lyman Wilbur). The arguments have
remained the same while the problems
have undergone drastic transforma
tion into new problems bearing little
resemblance to the old. For example,
the CCMC could show the direct
benefits of costs toward improved
sanitation in terms of man-hour
dollars of worker productivity. Cru
cially, when individual medical costs
become very high, it becomes clear
that this is a non-symmetric argu
ment: Human-hour-dollars clearly define
only a lower limit, not an upper one,
to costs. Quite unlike insurance for a
car or a house, with human life there is
no simple upper limit exactly bounded
by replacement cost. Yet it is clear
that we are now approaching such a
limit with some procedures, as
evidenced by reported current recon
sideration by Medi-Cal to revise
downward its present policy to finance
liver transplants. The policy was in
stituted last year after the telexed spec
tacle of tearful parents pleading for
donations to save their childrens' lives.
What is to be done? Possibly, the
existence of effective, though expen
sive, medical procedures will provide
additional incentive for the re
allocation of funds already within the
medical system away from procedures
with the least relative benefit (the
problem cited by Menzel, above).
Preventive medicine is another
relatively untapped area. Recent sta
tistics indicate that of 1000 young men
who smoke, one will be murdered, six
will be killed in auto accidents, and
250 will die of smoking-related
causes. A few slickly-produced Super
Bowl commercials showing a colorful
autopsy of a 40-year-old lung cancer
victim would be cost-effective in terms
of dollars eventually saved in cancer
treatment, even if only a few dozen
viewers quit. Finally, in their epilogue
the authors mention indirectly that
since 1945, the earning power of
registered nurses relative to physicians
has dropped by 50 percent. However,
such effects of a relative undersupply
of physicians (first pointed out in Mil
ton Friedman's Ph.D. thesis in 1937)
may be coming to an end. The change
will be a great deal more dramatic if,
as Harvard sociologist Paul Starr
predicts, the increasing corporatiza
tion of medicine transforms this over
supply of physicians into an actual
shortage of physician jobs.
In summary, "Medicine: the State
of the Art" provides a good overview
of the technological changes that are
affecting modern American health
care. But the relentlessly cheery and
mellow tone, which makes it hard to
believe the authors are not from Cali
fornia, carries the risk of missing the
problems and pressures for social
change inherent in many of the
wonders they describe.

modern medical system, the issues of
Hi change and challenge must be tightly
intertwined. The greatest challenges
are gathering at the intersection of
economic and ethical issues, as two
current announcements indicate. An
editorial in the leading British medical

It may seem tempting to react
against the technology laid out in
"State of the Art" by casting on it the
full yoke of guilt for crises measured in

thousands of lives unnecessarily lost

one must ask to just what extent these

rate, mix presentations of typical
patients (from the first vague pain to
the awful diagnosis to the total cure)
with readable descriptions of the biol
ogy and technology involved. Even
when the authors visit the ultimate
tertiary care centers, Sloan-Kettering
in New York or St. Jude's in Ken
tucky, everyone they meet is getting
better. (After reading these dozens of
patient histories, one will feel vaguely
disconcerted by cases like your Uncle
Charlie, who last year just got cancer
and went to a major hospital and
died.)
Viewing this book as a whole, with
respect to social challenges, we can
sort out two kinds of technological ad
vances in medicine. The first is ex
emplified by computerized
tomography, the CT scan, which al
lows a series of "slice" views of the
head or abdomen. When first intro
duced 10 years ago, CT scanners were
criticized as intolerably expensive
devices presenting only very few uses
which could justify their application.
Today, the machines are widely used
for an extensive range of diagnostic
services and their one-time purchase
cost has rapidly fallen with increased
production; further, the cost of a CT
scan can replace many invasive diag
nostic surgical procedures.
Nonetheless, there is a fly in
medicine's new technological oint
ment, and it is a very, very large fly.
Unlike CT scans, we can see that a
second class of the new technological
treatments described in "State of the
Art" are in very limited supply and are
very expensive. There might seem to
be straightforward historical prece
dent for this, in the years needed to
provide widespread distribution of in
sulin after its purification in 1922, or
in the time needed to scale-up to na
tional production of polio vaccine
after its discovery in the early '50s.
But these advances and others, like
antibiotics, showed promise, relatively
early on, of becoming widely available

to people who would otherwise die. In
sharp contrast, it is very uncertain that
advances like lung transplants will
ever approach the necessary supply,
and virtually certain that even when
advances like liver transplants become
technically practical, they will remain
very expensive.
1 argue that, to a significant degree,
these developments raise genuinely

new challenges, though many — cer
tainly, Mangel and Weisse — do not
treat them as such. In a brief epilogue
which is less an afterword than a disor
ganized afterthought, they allude to
the need for reform of the medical
cost system, using arguments not
much different from those expressed
in the 1912 movements in several
states for compulsory health insur

ance, or by the 1928 national Com
mittee on the Cost of Medical Care
(chaired by Stanford President Ray
Lyman Wilbur). The arguments have
remained the same while the problems
have undergone drastic transforma
tion into new problems bearing little
resemblance to the old. For example,
the CCMC could show the direct
benefits of costs toward improved
sanitation in terms of man-hour
dollars of worker productivity. Cru
cially, when individual medical costs
become very high, it becomes clear
that this is a non-symmetric argu
ment: Human-hour-dollars clearly define
only a lower limit, not an upper one,
to costs. Quite unlike insurance for a
car or a house, with human life there is
no simple upper limit exactly bounded
by replacement cost. Yet it is clear
that we are now approaching such a
limit with some procedures, as
evidenced by reported current recon
sideration by Medi-Cal to revise
downward its present policy to finance
liver transplants. The policy was in
stituted last year after the telexed spec
tacle of tearful parents pleading for
donations to save their childrens' lives.
What is to be done? Possibly, the
existence of effective, though expen
sive, medical procedures will provide
additional incentive for the re
allocation of funds already within the
medical system away from procedures
with the least relative benefit (the
problem cited by Menzel, above).
Preventive medicine is another
relatively untapped area. Recent sta
tistics indicate that of 1000 young men
who smoke, one will be murdered, six
will be killed in auto accidents, and
250 will die of smoking-related
causes. A few slickly-produced Super
Bowl commercials showing a colorful
autopsy of a 40-year-old lung cancer
victim would be cost-effective in terms
of dollars eventually saved in cancer
treatment, even if only a few dozen
viewers quit. Finally, in their epilogue
the authors mention indirectly that
since 1945, the earning power of
registered nurses relative to physicians
has dropped by 50 percent. However,
such effects of a relative undersupply
of physicians (first pointed out in Mil
ton Friedman's Ph.D. thesis in 1937)
may be coming to an end. The change
will be a great deal more dramatic if,
as Harvard sociologist Paul Starr
predicts, the increasing corporatiza
tion of medicine transforms this over
supply of physicians into an actual
shortage of physician jobs.
In summary, "Medicine: the State
of the Art" provides a good overview
of the technological changes that are
affecting modern American health
care. But the relentlessly cheery and
mellow tone, which makes it hard to
believe the authors are not from Cali
fornia, carries the risk of missing the
problems and pressures for social
change inherent in many of the
wonders they describe.
