# Research controls too tough
## New report warns Pentagon 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff With wire reports 
A National Research Council (NRC) report to be pub
lished today warns that the Pentagon's proposed research
controls may drive scientists away from critical defense
related fields.
"If the present climate of uncertainty continues, we may
witness an increasing migration of the best minds away
from those areas of science and engineering where con
trols are (or may be) imposed, the very fields where new
talent is most critical to U.S. technological lead time," the
study concluded.
The Pentagon is now considering a proposal that would
require prior approval for publication of research classi
fied as applied and "sensitive."
While such controls may be justified to help protect par
ticularly sensitive areas, the Reagan administration's
blanket approach has caused concern among scientists, the
report said.
The report, whose key findings will be published today
in the journal Science, also criticized repeated delays in a
planned National Security Council review of technology
transfer.
According to the report, which was prepared by NSC
staff member Michael Wallerstein, "There is a danger that

the lack of effective government-wide coordination will
undermine the perceived legitimacy of government pro
grams among the research community."
University officials here echoed the report's criticism.
"If indeed this type of restriction is placed on certain
areas of research the faculty will not do research in those J
areas," said Gerald Lieberman, the dean of Graduate
Studies and Research.
"I am a little more optimistic perhaps in that it will be
possible to have the Pentagon ease up on the restrictions,"
Lieberman said.
The Pentagon has also restricted the presentation of re
search results at about three international scientific con
ferences this year causing great "consternation" among
scientists, Lieberman said.
University President Donald Kennedy also criticized thu
controls during an alumni conference in New York yestev
day.
"Science prospers best when it's an open door," he said
"Although a lot is supposed about University leakage,
there's no proof that it's a serious threat or that significant
information has been lost."
Richard Delauer, undersecretary of defense for researcl
and development, has taken a strong
stand against the restrictions, and
l.ieberman said his position would be
helpful in convincing the Pentagon to
ease up.
The study was prepared earlier this
year for the NRC Committee on Sci
ence. Engineering and Public Policy,

an operating arm of the National
Academy of Sciences.
The report said controls on scien
tific data go "considerably beyond"
what was recommended in IL>N21 L >N2 by a
top-ranking panel that investigated
leakage of militarily valuable technol
ogy to the Soviet bloc.
That panel, chaired by Cornell Uni
versity president emeritus Dale Cor
son. acknowledged there might be
areas of research considered sensitive

and recommended the Pentagon he
given the right to review, but not ap
prove. results before publication.
Kennedy. MIT President Paul Grey,
and California Institute of Technology
President Marvin Goldberger recently
wrote a joint letter to administration
officials strongly opposing the restric
tions.
Lieberman sits on a University-
Pentagon working panel examining
the effect of export controls on aca
demic scientists.
