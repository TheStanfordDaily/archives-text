The bloody coup d'etat of
1973 which saw the assassina
tion of recently elected Presi
dent Salvador Allende and the
rise to power of a ruthless mili
tary dictatorship headed by
General Augusto Pinochet
marked Chilean literature
profoundly. Prominent exiled
writers felt a moral obligation to
grapple with the shock of the
military coup, in which many
thousands of people were bru
tally tortured or assassinated,
and one-tenth of Chile's popu
lation exiled. Important Chilean
writing took the form of literal
accounts of the coup's violent
aftermath. The decisive events
of had equal repercussions
in works of fiction and fantasy.
Chileans have produced in
the last decade a number of the
most consequential Latin
American novels, including
•"War Chorale" by Stanford
Spanish and Portugese Prof.
Fernando Alegria, as well as "A
House in the Country" by Jose
Donoso. recently translated into
English.
Donoso's novel is a paradoxi
cal attempt to convey in literary
terms v\hat its author claims
cannot be expressed by
literature: '•[Tjhe experience of
pain beyond a certain point can
not be conveyed through fan
tasy which by its very nature is
suggestive and therefore dis
respectful." Since literature

cannot do justice to the experi
ence of torture, Donoso
renounces to document it. He
declines indeed to create a fic
tional world in which appear
ances are taken as reality. In
Donoso's world of fantasy and

fable, "the appearance of reality
is always accepted as appear
ance." The narrator consistently
intervenes to remind his
readers, as in a kind of Brech
tian device, that fiction is an ar
bitrary concoction.

Donoso does not mean to
revel in a fictional world of un
masked appearances. Rather,
he lays bare the process by
which appearances that do not
correspond to reality are
sometimes taken for it, as in the

story of the emperor's new
clothes.
I'he central characters of the
novel, the Ventura family, take
their annual vacation on a
country estate near their gold
mines. The "grown-ups." as the
adults of the family are called,
live in a world of appearances:
their library ostensibly contains
the great works. In fact, there is
not a single page behind the
leather panels and gold lettering
that simulate the spines of
volumes. As the narrator points
out. the Ventura grown-ups do
not need to learn because they
communicate by repeating
dogmas. The eldest family
members provide the official
version of events which require
interpretation. When reality
does not happen to correspond
to their whims or interests, they
modify it. For instance, a preg
nant woman wishes to give birth
to a beautiful baby daughter,
but bears a boy instead. She
dresses him up as a girl, which
enables the family to forget the
original gender of the child.
As far as the Venturas are
concerned, the neighboring
natives who work their mines
are "cannibals," a label which
justifies their exploitation.
Adriano Gomara, an alert
young doctor, marries into the
family. In his first outing to the
country house he takes interest
in the natives. He discovers that,
far from being "cannibals," they
are peaceful descendants of an
older civilization. He even finds
that the house in the country sits
on land that originally belonged
'to the natives. The vision of the
Indian presented by Donoso

corresponds more to the roman
tic idea of the bon saitvuge than
that of the Latin American In
dian. It certainly cannot be the
Chilean Indian, the fierce
Araucano who was virtually ex
terminated. yet never subdued
by either the Incas. Spaniards or
the Republic of Chile. In any
event. Gomara becomes con
cerned with the natives' welfare
in this novel. He is promptly
strait-jacketed and imprisoned
by the Venturas on grounds he
is insane.
To simplify a long story: The
grown-ups leave on a picnic
which is actually an expedition
to survey a potential lode.
Adriano and the natives
manage, albeit in a disorganized
way. to undo some of the injus
tices of the Venturas. The
grown-ups become privy to these
events and decide to stay away.
Their servants, armed to the
teeth and headed by the ruthless
butler, recapture the house in a
military assault. They massacre
the natives who had
"endangered the children,"
then torture and kill children
sympathetic to the natives. The
allusions to the Pinochet coup
are self-evident.
Adriano Gomara's final
speech resembles Salvador Al
lende's last words: "We must
not be afraid. We are strong be
cause we have faith in our in
alienable rights and in our
reason. They are attacking with
gunpowder, we are defending
with iron: no matter because in
the end. after the nightmare and
the sacrifice in which I and
many of you will surely perish,
history shall pay us with justice

and time will bring forth what
we have sowed in her."
In a climactic moment, after
the grown-ups return, a Ventura
woman recognizes a tortured
child. She assumes her boy's
mutilated face is a mask. She or
ders him to remove the mask.
Since he does not because he
cannot, she tries to "rip off the
mask of his torture, raking his
skin, shouting at him to obey."
As a result of this disturbance,
the Venturas send for strait
jackets and put awav both
grown-up and child on grounds
that they are insane.
The message of the novel is
stated explicitly: "[Everything
that had happened . . . with its
triumphs and its inexcusable
blunders, along with the pain
and humiliation of the assault
(by the servants) had etched
into every heart, native and
child alike, a consciousness, an
outrage that would never again
allow anything to be as before."
Donoso knows that pointing
out the process by which false
appearances are taken for
reality can yield the most violent
reprisals. His novel exposes the
mechanisms by which violence
and torture are unleashed, while
refusing to convey the experi
ence of pain. "A House in the
Country" makes constant allu
sions to the events of the 1973
coup, without quite becoming
an allegory. It takes on the ap
pearance of a world of fable and
fantasy that actually provides us
with tools for understanding the
horrible events of recent
Chilean history.
