The Seven Samurai (1954)
Cubberley Auditorium
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century Japan.
A community of farmers, slowly
starving under the double bur
den of land taxes and the raids of
brigands, hires samurai to
protect it, and swords really start
to fly. The characters have a
funny, foolish braggadocio, and
the actors (Toshiro Mifune,
Takashi Shimura, Yoshi Inaba,
etc.) give stylized performances
reminiscent of the silent
comedies. The real star, of
course, is Kurosawa, who dis
plays the kind of witty mastery
of film technique that still makes
audiences grin.
Plays Monday at X.
The Candidate (1972)
Kresge Auditorium
This drama about the selling
of a senatorial candidate, which
c„m*. out in election year,
seemed to have everything going
for it: The director, Michael
Ritchie, had made a promising
debut with the modest but
assured Downhill Racer, the
screenplay was by Jeremy
Lamer, who had been a
speechwriter for Eugene
McCarthy and Robert Redford
played the attractive young ail-
American boy whose campaign
was to be scrutinized. But the
only snow job in sight, it turned
out, was the one being per
formed on the audience. It's a
slick, fast-moving picture —
speed standing in for ideas —
and when the movie's over we
still have no idea why the can
didate won the election (or else
why his opponent, a comic-book
conservative played by Don
Porter, ever had a chance against
him). Peter Boyle, Allen Gar
field and Melvyn Douglas ap
pear in supporting roles.
Plays tonight at 9.

Zelig (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
Woody Allen made this
charming movie about a man
whose fear of being ostracized
permits him to change his
features at will to conform to the
people around him. It's a cer
tifiable anomaly: Zclig's tale is
told through the combination of
deftly doctored footage from the
1920s and early '30s, present
day interviews, statements
delivered by contemporary so
cial observers and "historical"
scenes between Zelig (Allen)
and his psychiatrist-lover (Mia
Farrow). And the tone is a weird
hybrid of sage and lunatic, like
the best of Allen's short stories.
Zelig lacks the breadth of great
comedy, but for what it is, it's
just about perfect.
Plays Sunday at 7 & 9:30.
El Topo (1971)
Cubberley Auditorium
Alexandro Jodorowsky made
this heavily symbol-laden im
agist fable in Mexico, and it had
some success as a head film
when it was released in this
country. Amid all the other
garishly violent pictures in 1971
(Straw Dogs, Dirty Harry, A
Clockwork Orange, The Cow
boys, Polanski's Macbeth), the
stoned audiences barely regis
tered the carnage, the lakes of
blood, etc., that Jodorowsky of
fered for their delectation. It's a
deeply offensive movie, though,
and it lacks any genuine visual
poetry or invention or power —
without the interminable footage
of human and animal corpses
there Would be no movie at all.
(The dead animals are real; the
SPCA has no branches in
Mexico.) Jodorowsky stars as
the mystical hero.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.

Aguirre, the Wrath of God
(1977)
Adelfa Lounge (Lagunita);
Madera Lounge (Wilbur)
Werner Herzog's austere epic
about the fate of a Spanish ex
pedition in Peru is very tough
going, because he has absolutely
no sense of pacing — before you
first glance at your watch, you
don't know whether you've been
watching for 20 minutes or 90.
And he pays gruelling attention
to gruesome details (a few of
which are actually funny, in a
Teutonic sort of way). He's an
amazing image-maker, though,
and the film — unlike
Fitzcarraldo, which came five
years later — is worth the en
durance test. As Aguirre, Klaus
Kinski is malevolent in a surreal
way, like Cherkassov in Ivan the
Terrible.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30
(Adelfa) and Tuesday evening
at 6:30 (Madera).
Oliver Twist (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
Through the years Alec Guin
ness' portrayal of Fagin has
aroused considerable contro
versy. Sometimes called anti-
Semitic, it is in fact no such thing
— Guinness just gives the
slavering old villain a larger
than-life grandeur that is pure
Dickens. (It's hard to believe
this was only his second movie.)
David Lean directed this

remarkably intelligent, evocative
film from a screenplay he
worked up with Stanley Haynes,
and Guy Green shot it. The cast
also includes Robert Newton as
Bill Sikes, Kay Walsh as Nancy,
John Howard Davies as Oliver,
Francis L. Sullivan as Bumble,
Anthony Newley as the Artful
Dodger and Henry Stephenson
as Brownlow.
Plays through Wednesday
with David Copperfield.
David Copperfield (1935)
Festival, Palo Alto
This 1935 George Cukor ver
sion of Dickens' novel is very
much in the arch M-G-M
vellum-bound classics style,
though it has to its credit Edna
May Oliver as Aunt Betsey
Trotwood, Herbert Mundin as
Barkis and Elsa Lanchester as
Clickett, as well as a great set
piece: the Peggotty house, in the
shape of a boat. The celebrated
Micawber is W.C. Fields, al
though, truth to tell, he and the
role do not illuminate much in
each other. Freddie Bar
tholomew and then Frank Law
ton play David; Basil Rathbone

is cruel Mr. Murdstone; Roland
Young is Uriah Heep; Maureen
O'Sullivan and Madge Evans are
Dora and Agnes; and Lionel
Barrymore, Lewis Stone,
Elizabeth Allan, Jessie Ralph,
Violet Kemble-Cooper and Una
O'Connor also show up.
Plays through Wednesday
with Oliver Twist.
The Ballad of Orin (1977)
Cubberley Auditorium
Masahiro Shinoda's movie, set
in Japan in the 1910s, derives
from a novel by Tsutomu
Minagami (adapted by Shinoda
and Keiji Hasebe). Orin (Shima
Awashita) is a blind girl who
joins a band of goze — travelling
musicians — because it is the
only honorable choice for blind
women, who must otherwise
become whores. When she takes
a lover, she falls from grace and,
expelled from the goze house,
must depend on other lovers to
protect her. Much has been writ
ten in praise of Mizoguchi's
treatment of women in dire
straits (in films like A Geisha
and The Life of Oharu), but
Shinoda's study of Orin's
sexuality and how it, along with
her blindness, determines her

fate,' is far more unusual and
poignant than Mizoguchi's
"problem" pictures. A major
filmmaker who has yet to be
recognized in this country,
Shinoda thinks like a poet — in
terms of motifs (sea, snow, the
clogs that the goze wear) and
pellucid, compelling symbols.
Shot by Kazu Miyagawa, who
uses a soft-toned pallette; the
plaintive score is by Toru
Takemitsu.
Plays Wednesday evening at
7:30.
Testament (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Among the handful of sur
vivors in Lynn Littman's movie
about nuclear holocaust is a little
retarded Asian boy named
Hiroshi. If that detail doesn't
make you want to run for the
nearest exit, then you may not
mind the rest of the film, either,
or the fact that Littman has
probably invented a new kind of
manipulative guilt. Jane Alexan
der plays the woman whose
"testament" the film is; she gives
the kind of serious, committed,
unvariated performance that
makes your head ache.
Plays Wednesday with Atomic
Cafe.

Chilly Scenes of Winter
(1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A recut version of Joan Mick
lin Silver's 1979 Head Over
Heels, adapted from Ann
Beattie's first novel — and one
of the few examples of a movie
that improves on material by a
talented writer. Silver is a
screenwriter-director, and her
ear far surpasses her eye: Her
strengths show up when the ac
tors open their mouths and the
words that float out of them
seem exactly right. John Heard
and Mary Beth Hurt do fine
work as survivors of the '60s
generation who deal with the
banal, workaday world as
though it were transitory, a
phase in their lives that they can
goof about someday. With
memorable supporting perfor
mances by Peter Riegert, the
late Gloria Grahame, Nora
Heflin, Frances Bay and the
endlessly remarkable Kenneth
McMillan.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Big Chill.
Cousin, Cousine (1976)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Jean-Charles Tacchiella's
comedy has plenty of what many
reviewers call "Gallic charm":
that usually means tiresome
jokes about sex and stupid, in
sensitive characters whose inter
minable interplay is supposed to
give audiences boundless plea
sure. This one did, apparently —
it was a huge hit — which makes
it an even more infuriating
picture in retrospect. Marie
-1 France Pisicr is the best thing in
it.
Plays today with The Gift.

people around him. It's a cer
tifiable anomaly: Zclig's tale is
told through the combination of
deftly doctored footage from the
1920s and early '30s, present
day interviews, statements
delivered by contemporary so
cial observers and "historical"
scenes between Zelig (Allen)
and his psychiatrist-lover (Mia
Farrow). And the tone is a weird
hybrid of sage and lunatic, like
the best of Allen's short stories.
Zelig lacks the breadth of great
comedy, but for what it is, it's
just about perfect.
Plays Sunday at 7 & 9:30.
El Topo (1971)
Cubberley Auditorium
Alexandro Jodorowsky made
this heavily symbol-laden im
agist fable in Mexico, and it had
some success as a head film
when it was released in this
country. Amid all the other
garishly violent pictures in 1971
(Straw Dogs, Dirty Harry, A
Clockwork Orange, The Cow
boys, Polanski's Macbeth), the
stoned audiences barely regis
tered the carnage, the lakes of
blood, etc., that Jodorowsky of
fered for their delectation. It's a
deeply offensive movie, though,
and it lacks any genuine visual
poetry or invention or power —
without the interminable footage
of human and animal corpses
there Would be no movie at all.
(The dead animals are real; the
SPCA has no branches in
Mexico.) Jodorowsky stars as
the mystical hero.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.

Aguirre, the Wrath of God
(1977)
Adelfa Lounge (Lagunita);
Madera Lounge (Wilbur)
Werner Herzog's austere epic
about the fate of a Spanish ex
pedition in Peru is very tough
going, because he has absolutely
no sense of pacing — before you
first glance at your watch, you
don't know whether you've been
watching for 20 minutes or 90.
And he pays gruelling attention
to gruesome details (a few of
which are actually funny, in a
Teutonic sort of way). He's an
amazing image-maker, though,
and the film — unlike
Fitzcarraldo, which came five
years later — is worth the en
durance test. As Aguirre, Klaus
Kinski is malevolent in a surreal
way, like Cherkassov in Ivan the
Terrible.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30
(Adelfa) and Tuesday evening
at 6:30 (Madera).
Oliver Twist (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
Through the years Alec Guin
ness' portrayal of Fagin has
aroused considerable contro
versy. Sometimes called anti-
Semitic, it is in fact no such thing
— Guinness just gives the
slavering old villain a larger
than-life grandeur that is pure
Dickens. (It's hard to believe
this was only his second movie.)
David Lean directed this

remarkably intelligent, evocative
film from a screenplay he
worked up with Stanley Haynes,
and Guy Green shot it. The cast
also includes Robert Newton as
Bill Sikes, Kay Walsh as Nancy,
John Howard Davies as Oliver,
Francis L. Sullivan as Bumble,
Anthony Newley as the Artful
Dodger and Henry Stephenson
as Brownlow.
Plays through Wednesday
with David Copperfield.
David Copperfield (1935)
Festival, Palo Alto
This 1935 George Cukor ver
sion of Dickens' novel is very
much in the arch M-G-M
vellum-bound classics style,
though it has to its credit Edna
May Oliver as Aunt Betsey
Trotwood, Herbert Mundin as
Barkis and Elsa Lanchester as
Clickett, as well as a great set
piece: the Peggotty house, in the
shape of a boat. The celebrated
Micawber is W.C. Fields, al
though, truth to tell, he and the
role do not illuminate much in
each other. Freddie Bar
tholomew and then Frank Law
ton play David; Basil Rathbone

is cruel Mr. Murdstone; Roland
Young is Uriah Heep; Maureen
O'Sullivan and Madge Evans are
Dora and Agnes; and Lionel
Barrymore, Lewis Stone,
Elizabeth Allan, Jessie Ralph,
Violet Kemble-Cooper and Una
O'Connor also show up.
Plays through Wednesday
with Oliver Twist.
The Ballad of Orin (1977)
Cubberley Auditorium
Masahiro Shinoda's movie, set
in Japan in the 1910s, derives
from a novel by Tsutomu
Minagami (adapted by Shinoda
and Keiji Hasebe). Orin (Shima
Awashita) is a blind girl who
joins a band of goze — travelling
musicians — because it is the
only honorable choice for blind
women, who must otherwise
become whores. When she takes
a lover, she falls from grace and,
expelled from the goze house,
must depend on other lovers to
protect her. Much has been writ
ten in praise of Mizoguchi's
treatment of women in dire
straits (in films like A Geisha
and The Life of Oharu), but
Shinoda's study of Orin's
sexuality and how it, along with
her blindness, determines her

fate,' is far more unusual and
poignant than Mizoguchi's
"problem" pictures. A major
filmmaker who has yet to be
recognized in this country,
Shinoda thinks like a poet — in
terms of motifs (sea, snow, the
clogs that the goze wear) and
pellucid, compelling symbols.
Shot by Kazu Miyagawa, who
uses a soft-toned pallette; the
plaintive score is by Toru
Takemitsu.
Plays Wednesday evening at
7:30.
Testament (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Among the handful of sur
vivors in Lynn Littman's movie
about nuclear holocaust is a little
retarded Asian boy named
Hiroshi. If that detail doesn't
make you want to run for the
nearest exit, then you may not
mind the rest of the film, either,
or the fact that Littman has
probably invented a new kind of
manipulative guilt. Jane Alexan
der plays the woman whose
"testament" the film is; she gives
the kind of serious, committed,
unvariated performance that
makes your head ache.
Plays Wednesday with Atomic
Cafe.

Chilly Scenes of Winter
(1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A recut version of Joan Mick
lin Silver's 1979 Head Over
Heels, adapted from Ann
Beattie's first novel — and one
of the few examples of a movie
that improves on material by a
talented writer. Silver is a
screenwriter-director, and her
ear far surpasses her eye: Her
strengths show up when the ac
tors open their mouths and the
words that float out of them
seem exactly right. John Heard
and Mary Beth Hurt do fine
work as survivors of the '60s
generation who deal with the
banal, workaday world as
though it were transitory, a
phase in their lives that they can
goof about someday. With
memorable supporting perfor
mances by Peter Riegert, the
late Gloria Grahame, Nora
Heflin, Frances Bay and the
endlessly remarkable Kenneth
McMillan.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Big Chill.
Cousin, Cousine (1976)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Jean-Charles Tacchiella's
comedy has plenty of what many
reviewers call "Gallic charm":
that usually means tiresome
jokes about sex and stupid, in
sensitive characters whose inter
minable interplay is supposed to
give audiences boundless plea
sure. This one did, apparently —
it was a huge hit — which makes
it an even more infuriating
picture in retrospect. Marie
-1 France Pisicr is the best thing in
it.
Plays today with The Gift.


The Seven Samurai (1954)
Cubberley Auditorium
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century Japan.
A community of farmers, slowly
starving under the double bur
den of land taxes and the raids of
brigands, hires samurai to
protect it, and swords really start
to fly. The characters have a
funny, foolish braggadocio, and
the actors (Toshiro Mifune,
Takashi Shimura, Yoshi Inaba,
etc.) give stylized performances
reminiscent of the silent
comedies. The real star, of
course, is Kurosawa, who dis
plays the kind of witty mastery
of film technique that still makes
audiences grin.
Plays Monday at X.
The Candidate (1972)
Kresge Auditorium
This drama about the selling
of a senatorial candidate, which
c„m*. out in election year,
seemed to have everything going
for it: The director, Michael
Ritchie, had made a promising
debut with the modest but
assured Downhill Racer, the
screenplay was by Jeremy
Lamer, who had been a
speechwriter for Eugene
McCarthy and Robert Redford
played the attractive young ail-
American boy whose campaign
was to be scrutinized. But the
only snow job in sight, it turned
out, was the one being per
formed on the audience. It's a
slick, fast-moving picture —
speed standing in for ideas —
and when the movie's over we
still have no idea why the can
didate won the election (or else
why his opponent, a comic-book
conservative played by Don
Porter, ever had a chance against
him). Peter Boyle, Allen Gar
field and Melvyn Douglas ap
pear in supporting roles.
Plays tonight at 9.

Zelig (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
Woody Allen made this
charming movie about a man
whose fear of being ostracized
permits him to change his
features at will to conform to the
people around him. It's a cer

told through the combination of
deftly doctored footage from the

watching for 20 minutes or 90.
And he pays gruelling attention
to gruesome details (a few of
which are actually funny, in a
Teutonic sort of way). He's an
amazing image-maker, though,
and the film — unlike
Fitzcarraldo, which came five
years later — is worth the en
durance test. As Aguirre, Klaus
Kinski is malevolent in a surreal
way, like Cherkassov in Ivan the
Terrible.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30
(Adelfa) and Tuesday evening
at 6:30 (Madera).
Oliver Twist (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
Through the years Alec Guin
ness' portrayal of Fagin has
aroused considerable contro
versy. Sometimes called anti-
Semitic, it is in fact no such thing
— Guinness just gives the
slavering old villain a larger
than-life grandeur that is pure
Dickens. (It's hard to believe
this was only his second movie.)
David Lean directed this

remarkably intelligent, evocative
film from a screenplay he
worked up with Stanley Haynes,
and Guy Green shot it. The cast
also includes Robert Newton as
Bill Sikes, Kay Walsh as Nancy,
John Howard Davies as Oliver,
Francis L. Sullivan as Bumble,
Anthony Newley as the Artful
Dodger and Henry Stephenson
as Brownlow.
Plays through Wednesday
with David Copperfield.
David Copperfield (1935)
Festival, Palo Alto
This 1935 George Cukor ver
sion of Dickens' novel is very
much in the arch M-G-M
vellum-bound classics style,
though it has to its credit Edna
May Oliver as Aunt Betsey
Trotwood, Herbert Mundin as
Barkis and Elsa Lanchester as
Clickett, as well as a great set
piece: the Peggotty house, in the
shape of a boat. The celebrated
Micawber is W.C. Fields, al
though, truth to tell, he and the
role do not illuminate much in
each other. Freddie Bar
tholomew and then Frank Law
ton play David; Basil Rathbone

is cruel Mr. Murdstone; Roland
Young is Uriah Heep; Maureen
O'Sullivan and Madge Evans are
Dora and Agnes; and Lionel
Barrymore, Lewis Stone,
Elizabeth Allan, Jessie Ralph,
Violet Kemble-Cooper and Una
O'Connor also show up.
Plays through Wednesday
with Oliver Twist.
The Ballad of Orin (1977)
Cubberley Auditorium
Masahiro Shinoda's movie, set
in Japan in the 1910s, derives
from a novel by Tsutomu
Minagami (adapted by Shinoda
and Keiji Hasebe). Orin (Shima
Awashita) is a blind girl who
joins a band of goze — travelling
musicians — because it is the
only honorable choice for blind
women, who must otherwise
become whores. When she takes
a lover, she falls from grace and,
expelled from the goze house,
must depend on other lovers to
protect her. Much has been writ
ten in praise of Mizoguchi's
treatment of women in dire
straits (in films like A Geisha
and The Life of Oharu), but
Shinoda's study of Orin's
sexuality and how it, along with
her blindness, determines her

fate,' is far more unusual and
poignant than Mizoguchi's
"problem" pictures. A major
filmmaker who has yet to be
recognized in this country,
Shinoda thinks like a poet — in
terms of motifs (sea, snow, the
clogs that the goze wear) and
pellucid, compelling symbols.
Shot by Kazu Miyagawa, who
uses a soft-toned pallette; the
plaintive score is by Toru
Takemitsu.
Plays Wednesday evening at
7:30.
Testament (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Among the handful of sur
vivors in Lynn Littman's movie
about nuclear holocaust is a little
retarded Asian boy named
Hiroshi. If that detail doesn't
make you want to run for the
nearest exit, then you may not
mind the rest of the film, either,
or the fact that Littman has
probably invented a new kind of
manipulative guilt. Jane Alexan
der plays the woman whose
"testament" the film is; she gives
the kind of serious, committed,
unvariated performance that
makes your head ache.
Plays Wednesday with Atomic
Cafe.

Chilly Scenes of Winter
(1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A recut version of Joan Mick
lin Silver's 1979 Head Over
Heels, adapted from Ann
Beattie's first novel — and one
of the few examples of a movie
that improves on material by a
talented writer. Silver is a
screenwriter-director, and her
ear far surpasses her eye: Her
strengths show up when the ac
tors open their mouths and the
words that float out of them
seem exactly right. John Heard
and Mary Beth Hurt do fine
work as survivors of the '60s
generation who deal with the
banal, workaday world as
though it were transitory, a
phase in their lives that they can
goof about someday. With
memorable supporting perfor
mances by Peter Riegert, the
late Gloria Grahame, Nora
Heflin, Frances Bay and the
endlessly remarkable Kenneth
McMillan.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Big Chill.
Cousin, Cousine (1976)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Jean-Charles Tacchiella's
comedy has plenty of what many
reviewers call "Gallic charm":
that usually means tiresome
jokes about sex and stupid, in
sensitive characters whose inter
minable interplay is supposed to
give audiences boundless plea
sure. This one did, apparently —
it was a huge hit — which makes
it an even more infuriating
picture in retrospect. Marie
-1 France Pisicr is the best thing in
it.
Plays today with The Gift.
