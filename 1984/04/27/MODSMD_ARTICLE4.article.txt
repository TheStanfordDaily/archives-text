# Housing assignments draw mixed reviews

The thrill of 0005. The agony of
5000. The Draw. The green chest is
open invitingly, your hand sinks down
amidst the throng of little envelopes.
And then there it is. Your number.
You know it immediately. You have
felt lucky all day. Now the moment of
truth is at hand.
For sophomore K.K. Bush, the mo
ment was right. She drew number five,
but others were not so lucky. Fresh
man Kim Wall drew one thousand
times Bush's number. The dreaded
5000. "I felt really lucky and we
Hipped a coin to see who would draw.
I won. . .1 couldn't believe it. . .of all
the people in the whole school it never
occured to me it was possible. Maybe
we will get number one next time,"
Wall said.
And there is still a chance tor some
lucky person to draw that number
today. Although numbers five and
lour have been taken, the first three
numbers are still waiting.
The methods of drawing are as dif
ferent as the numbers themselves.
Freshman Arnold Tang brought his
robot to help him draw yesterday. He
maneuvered a robotic arm to pick out
his number. However. Fangs robot
made more of an impression than did
his number: 327 N.
According to Draw Coordinator
Jennifer King, other antics have in
cluded a group ot tour women who
held hands together while the last one
drew the number. I here have been
â€¢huddles" and a lot of yel'.'-ig and
screaming. King said. C hampagne
corks have also been sent tlying after
successful draws.
But despite the successes, there aic
also failures. And those who were not

so lucky have come to question the
system itself. Juniors Robb Waterman
and Jamie Krueger are among those
who have been victims of the system.
They have spent all three years of
their Stanford careers in Stern Hall
and this year they drew 4016. To add
insult to injury, they are unguaranteed
next year.
"Returning residence priority is
screwed. I think the idea of continuity
in the houses is nice, but I'd rather
have less continuity and more vari
ety," Waterman said.
Krueger added, ''When un
guaranteed people get assigned to
good places it's ridiculous. They
should be put in the leftover places."
Another problem they see is that
inequality has intensified because of
the new housing. "Potter gets new
computers over Christmas break and
what do we get? New drain plugs,"
Waterman said.
In response to these arguments,
Rodger Whitney, director of housing,
said, "We've reduced the impact of re
turning residence priority. In the
average residence only 25-30 percent
of students are returning residents."
But the rationale behind returning
residence priorities still remains.
"There is some need in a residential
system that's as diverse as ours and as
spread-out geographically to have
continuity." Whitney said.
In order to increase the importance
of the guaranteed years, Whitney said.
"We are thinking about using a system
to help you draw into more selective
housing by drawing from a better
group of numbers."
Despite the increased housing now
available, demand seems to have also
