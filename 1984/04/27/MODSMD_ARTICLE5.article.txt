The Stanford Charity Carnival, the lund-raiser
held last weekend to aid the Children's Hospital,
was able to raise $200. according to student or
ganizers.
Jeanie Gilliam, one of the principal organizers,
said the high costs of running the carnival left very
little money for the Children's Hospital, which is
now under construction.
"But we're not disappointed at all." she said,
"we decided we would he satisfied it we could
break even, and so we were very happy to make a
profit."
Gilliam estimated that approximately 2000
people turned out for the three-day carnival, which
featured names, rides, a record-setting Twister

game and a fireworks display.
"We wanted to make money," Gilliam said,
"but. more importantly, we wanted to create an
awareness of the hospital and show the community
that there were Stanford students willing to work
for it."
"The turnout wasn't fantastic, but it helped get a
tradition started," Pam Cloyd. a junior involved in
organizing the carnival, said.
Cloyd said the poor turnout was partially due to
advertising problems.
"Milton-Bradley sponsored the Twister event,
and we thought they were going to take care of the
advertising as well," she said. "That didn't happen,
and it created one big problem."
According to Cloyd, the turnout for student-run
booths was also poor.

"We were really disappointed with the booths
run by student organizations since they didn't have
a huge turnout," she said. "But those people who
did show up had a good time, so we're glad it was a
success in that way."
According to carnival organizer Pete Sidebot
tom, there are a number of improvements being
planned for next year's carnival.
"We would like to have a new location and a
weekend other than Easter weekend, and then
maybe we can attract 5000 people rather than only
20(H)," he said.
Sidebottom said he would like to see next year's
carnival held in a "more visible location such as
one of the intramural fields behind the stadium.

Freshman Arnold Tang brought a little computerized assistance with
him when it came time to participate in the Draw. The robot designed


by the Rinconada resident did not fare too well, as it reached into the
chest and came up with number 3278.
