people were killed in the town of Morris, about 40 miles
south of Tulsa in east-central Oklahoma.

25 injuries in Terlton. a town of about 155 people about 30
miles west of Tulsa.

Diplomats to depart Sunday
London — With timing like that of an exchange of
prisoners, the wives and children of British diplomats in Libya
returned home to London last night at about the same time as
the wives and children of Libyan diplomats in Britain flew
home to Tripoli.
The exchange seemed to presage a peaceful end to the
crisis of the Libyan Embassy, which has been under siege by
British police since April 17, when a gunman inside fired
from a window, killing a British policewoman and wounding
11 Libyan demonstrators.
Britain, which has broken off diplomatic relations with
Libya, has ordered all those inside the embassy to leave by
midnight Sunday. With their dependents already in Libya,
there seems little doubt that those inside the embassy intend
to go.
There were some anxious moments in Britain, however, as
the Libyan authorities refused for six and a half hours to let
the 30 British dependents leave Tripoli. The Libyans were
evidently waiting to make sure that the 137 dependents of the
Libyans would be allowed leave Heathrow Airport in Lon
don.
Tanker ablaze in Persian Gulf
Washington — A Saudi supertanker loaded with Iranian
crude oil caught fire in the Persian Gulf Wednesday night
after an explosion in one of its oil storage cells, shipping
sources and Lloyd's of London Shipping Intelligence reported
yesterday.
The source of the explosion was not known, but speculation
immediately focused on whether Iraq, with which Iran is at
war, might have attacked the tanker Safina al-Arab. Iraq has
denied responsibility for the explosion, according to an
Arabic news broadcast over Radio Monte Carlo.
In London, a Lloyd's official told Stanley Meisler of the
Los Angeles Times that one crew member from the tanker
told the captain of a rescue ship that the Safina al-Arab
"appeared to be hit by a projectile," possibly a missile. The
captain added in a radio message to Lloyd's that the damage
might also have been caused by a floating mine.
But State Department officials, speaking on condition that
they not be identified, conceded that "we are making the as
sumption that the Iraqis did it."
American copter wandered
over Czechoslovak border
Washington — The Pentagon acknowledged yesterday that
a U.S. Artny AH-IS Cobra helicopter had "inadvertently
crossed' about six miles into Czechoslovak air space last
Friday when it was fired on by two Czechoslovak MiG-21
fighter jets.
An investigation conducted by the Army's European Com
mand blamed "pilot error" for the incident. Department of
Defense spokesman Michael Burch said. It found that the
unarmed helicopter, flying what was described as a "routine
border reconnaissance" mission, crossed from West Germany
and flew over Czechoslovak territory for 20 minutes in clear
weather.
Nonetheless, Burch complained that the jets' attack on the
helicopter with missile and cannon fire was "excessive and
unwarranted," forcing the U.S. craft to take evasive action to
escape damage.

New drug will treat herpes
Washington — The first long-term, "meaningful" treat
ments are being reported for genital herpes, a disease now af
fecting an estimated 5 million to 20 million Americans.
Doctors from five medical centers have used an oral form
of acyclovir, a drug first used on genital herpes in ointment
form two years ago, to ease the recurring attacks most victims
suffer.
Other doctors, it was learned, are finding that daily use of
the oral drug has prevented the bulk of recurrences for as
long as eight months.
Researchers are also finding that the drug's use shortens
the period in which victims shed herpes virus, which may in
fect others.
