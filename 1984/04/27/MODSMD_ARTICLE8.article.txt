From The Washington Post
Peking — President Reagan, in the first major public
appearance of his visit to China, prepared to lecture the
Chinese today on the advantages of living in a free soci
ety and the need to deter Soviet military expansionism.
He also was expected to officially announce that the
United States and China have negotiated a nuclear
cooperation agreement that will allow U.S. companies
to sell billions of dollars worth of atomic energy equip
ment to the Chinese.
The president, a conservative who has spent a politi

cal lifetime crusading against communism and is visiting
a Communist country for the first time, said in remarks
prepared for delivery to a select Chinese audience for
telecasting later that the United States and C hina
"must always be realistic" about their differences and
"never minimize them."
"But let us not be dominated by them," he ad
monished, "I have not come to China to hold forth on
what divides us, but to build on what binds us.
Reagan, who arrived in Peking yesterday amid
wintry weather — "We got a cold wave from Siberia

sent by some Russian guy. a Chinese government
guide quipped to reporters — was to speak today to
600 people in the cavernous Great Hall of the People.
The audience was handpicked by the Chinese govern
ment and consisted primarily, a Reagan administration
senior official said, ot "America-watchers — I guess
what you might call intellectuals."
After some initial hesitation by the Chinese govern
ment. it was decided that a tape ot Reagan's speech was
to be televised into 200-or-so million homes tonight.
