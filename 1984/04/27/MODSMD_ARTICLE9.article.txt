### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — President Reagan
asked Congress yesterday to strengthen
his highly publicized "war on terrorism"
by providing rewards of up to $500,000
for information about terrorist acts
around the globe.
The proposed rewards were set forth
in a package of legislation sent to
Congress by White House officials on the
president's behalf while he was visiting
China. In addition, the legislation would
extend federal jurisdiction over hostage

taking, tighten laws against airplane
sabotage and impose jail terms on
Americans aiding terrorist groups.
"I am determined that my administra
tion will do whatever is necessary to
reduce the incidence of terrorism against
us anywhere in the world and to see that
the perpetrators of terrorists acts are
brought to justice." Reagan said in his
message to Congress. "The legislation 1
am sending to Congress is an important
step in our war against terrorism."
In recent weeks, the president has au

thorized both preemptive strikes and
reprisal raids against terrorists abroad.
Security also has been strengthened at
the White House and other U.S. govern
ment facilities, including those overseas.
Over the last 15 years, according to
the administration, Americans have been
the victims of more than 2500 terrorist
acts at home and abroad. In a
record number of Americans were killed
in terrorist acts, most of them Marines
who died last October in the terrorist
bombing of military barracks in Beirut.

At present, according to administra
tion officials, the rewards that the gov
ernment can pay for information about
acts of terrorism are small and can he
paid only in connection with incidents
within the United States.
The legislation proposed by Reagan
not only would increase the rewards but
also would authorize them for informa
tion about terrorism in other countries.
I he rewards would be provided for in
formation leading to the arrest of a ter
rorist or the prevention of a terrorist act.
