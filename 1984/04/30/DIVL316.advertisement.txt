ACCESS CONTROL
STUDY
in ENGINEERING LIBRARY
Stanford University Libraries (SUL) is considering limiting
access to the Science and Engineering branches to indi
viduals who possess a valid Stanford identification card —
student registration card, faculty-staff ID, purchased
privileges card, etc. The Engineering Library will conduct a
study during May to estimate the number of people who
would be affected by such a policy. Staff members ask
that library users be prepared to show IDs to the entrance
checkers. For Stanford faculty, staff and students, a
Stanford ID will suffice. Non-Stanford users will be asked if
they have a legitimate library card issued by the Green Lib
rary Privileges Division, but will not be denied access if
they do not. Non-Stanford users will be given information
about purchasing library privileges through Green Library
(telephone number 497-1491). Please bear with us. We
will try to inconvenience you as little as possible. If you
have questions regarding the Engineering Library study,
please call Michael Sullivan at 497-3769.
