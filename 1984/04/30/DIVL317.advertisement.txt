—COMMITTEE ON RESEARCH ANNUAL OPEN
MEETING
All interested members of the University community are invited to attend the Com
mittee on Research's Annual Meeting to be held on Wednesday, May 2nd, from 4
to 6 o'clock in the Assembly Room of Bechtel International Center. The meeting is
for the purpose of soliciting comments on any issue related to University research
policies and their implementation. In particular, comments are invited on the fol
lowing two matters:
I The desirability of reaffirming or modifying current Stanford policy which pro
hibits the University from basing decisions concerning the acceptability of research
on "speculations concerning the political or moral impropriety of the uses which
might be made of (research) results."
a) The Senate of the Academic Council charged the Committee this year with
two tasks: one was to recommend whether this policy should be retained or
amended: the other was to recommend whether additional policy guidance is
needed in order to protect the rights and responsibilities of researchers to each
other in those cases where groups of researchers and affiliated individuals are in
volved in activities that are collaborative or interdependent.
II The adequacy of the Secrecy in Research Guidelines, which were most re
cently revised in December, 1982.
a) These Guidelines are required by policy to be reviewed at least annually by
the Committee.
Before the Committee submits its recommendations to the Senate on these issues,
the Committee is seeking input from the wider University community. Contact Pat
ricia Devaney at 497-3763 for information.
