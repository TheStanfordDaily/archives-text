We're different.
At Stanford Federal Credit Union, you'll find the .
financial services you need. And you'll discover something else you
probably didn't expect.
Unlike banks and savings & loans, we're not here to make a profit.
We're here to serve you. SFCU is a financial cooperative, owned and directed
by its 23,000 members.
Checking, high-yield federally insured investments, a full line-up of loans,
secured VISA Cards, IRAs, Christmas and Vacation Clubs, traveler's checks,
automatic deposit and payment options, money orders, notary services, and
transactions by mail and phone as well as in person — and that's just a
sampling of the services offered at each of our three branch offices. Plus
rates and terms that are very competitive.
SFCU membership is open to Stanford University employees, and to
everyone* who lives on Stanford land, or works for or is paid by an
organization** located on Stanford land (including Stanford Industrial Park).
In addition, Stanford graduate and postgraduate students are eligible for
membership.
