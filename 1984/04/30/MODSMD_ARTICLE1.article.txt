# Stanford weekend in N.Y.
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
New York — When Leland Stanford
first constructed his university, the in
tention was to recreate a prestigious
East Coast university in the West.
This weekend his successors did just
the opposite. They brought Stanford
to the East Coast.
I rue, the Stanford Alumni Confer
ence did not succeed in bringing West
Coast sunshine to the New York Hil
ton, and perhaps the only visible palm
trees were in the hotel lobby. But the
conference did provide almost 2000
former Stanford students with a taste
of the University's current intellectual
life.
There were four days of lectures,
tours and seminars, with the bulk of
the conference scheduled on Saturday.
Stanford professors gave a series of
talks in the morning and afternoon on
"Life in the 21st Century," and Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy ad
dressed a lunch-time crowd of about
1 200 on the future of education.
The professors speaking Saturday
principally offered predictions about
the future of the arts and sciences,
though a few, such as Assoc. Art Prof.
Wanda Corn, chose to summarize cur
rent trends rather than make predic
tions.
"As an art historian," Corn ex
plained during her talk, "1 'm not too
comfortable looking into a crystal
ball."
Corn later added, however, that
she'd found no real problem with the
topic of the conference. "It was open,
and gave professors a chance to say
pretty much whatever they wanted
to," she said.
She added that the chosen faculty
had over a year to prepare their talks.
Kennedy, in his speech, expressed
concern about the future of American
education, but ended optimistically.
He said that America had become a
nation of consumers (wanters) rather
than investors (waiters). Since educa
tion is an investment, it is becoming
more and more deemphasized. In ad
dition, the "brilliant experiment" of
allowing Universities to conduct most
government research, a function
unique in American democracy, is be
coming endangered.
Kennedy indicated that the solution
to the crisis in contemporary educa
tion is primarily financial. "The an
swer lies in how we allocate our re
sources in the future," he said.
"I want to believe that American
society can transform itself into a soci
ety of 'wanters.' This can be done
primarily through tax reform."
An informal hand poll taken during
lunch revealed that about 75 percent
of the conventioneers had come from
the New York area but that others had
traveled from all over the eastern
seaboard, from Canada to Florida.
The conference gave alumni a
chance to hear both new and
familiar professors speak, but dlso
gathered together a vast number of
new and familiar Stanford faces. Jill
Stein, a medical writer from
Seacaucas. New Jersey, was impressed
by the number and diversity of alumni
at the conference. "I can't believe the
diversity of the people here."
Stein was in fact more interested in
meeting people than attending classes;
she said she'd spent most of the day
wandering around talking to alumni.

"I've been living in this area for a few
years now and 1 find it's really hard to
meet people here." she said." When 1
got the information on the conference,
I thought, 'what the heck, I'll meet
some Stanford people." "
Stein added, however, that she had
no intention of going to the reunion
planned for her class that evening. "I
can't stand people who are 'rah
rahs," " she said.
Susan Delaney, an opera singer
from the class of 'MO. was more enthu
siastic about her class reunion and the
meeting of old Stanford classmates.
She and Roberta Shepard, class of
'76, discovered they had a group of
mutual friends. While they were
reminiscing, Roberta's husband Mi
chael explained that they had flown up
from Washington. D.C. just to go to
the conference.
"Roberta and I both went to Stan
ford," he said. "In fact, we met in our
freshman dorm."
There were of course alumni who
attended the conference for more aca
demic reasons. The oldest alumni
present. Katherine McClintock. class
of '21. said she came because "a friend
of mine has a grandaughter who's al
ways raving about this Elsen fellow
(Art Prof. Albert Elsen), and I'm very
involved in the art world, so I wanted
to see what he had to say."
On the other end of the spectrum,
perhaps the youngest alum at the con
ference was Mark Wilson, class of '84.
Wilson, a former Daily cartoonist, said
that he had been doing freelance work
in the New York area for several
months, and that he'd gone to the con
ference because he was homesick.

got the information on the conference,
I thought, 'what the heck, I'll meet
some Stanford people." "
Stein added, however, that she had
no intention of going to the reunion
planned for her class that evening. "I
can't stand people who are 'rah
rahs," " she said.
Susan Delaney, an opera singer
from the class of 'MO. was more enthu
siastic about her class reunion and the
meeting of old Stanford classmates.
She and Roberta Shepard, class of
'76, discovered they had a group of
mutual friends. While they were
reminiscing, Roberta's husband Mi
chael explained that they had flown up
from Washington. D.C. just to go to
the conference.
"Roberta and I both went to Stan
ford," he said. "In fact, we met in our
freshman dorm."
There were of course alumni who
attended the conference for more aca
demic reasons. The oldest alumni
present. Katherine McClintock. class
of '21. said she came because "a friend
of mine has a grandaughter who's al
ways raving about this Elsen fellow
(Art Prof. Albert Elsen), and I'm very
involved in the art world, so I wanted
to see what he had to say."
On the other end of the spectrum,
perhaps the youngest alum at the con
ference was Mark Wilson, class of '84.
Wilson, a former Daily cartoonist, said
that he had been doing freelance work
in the New York area for several
months, and that he'd gone to the con
ference because he was homesick.
