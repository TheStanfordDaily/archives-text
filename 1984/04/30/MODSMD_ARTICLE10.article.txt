# Rebels expect new funding conditions

From the Los Angeles Times
Washington â€” The Reagan
administration, in an attempt to
win congressional support for
new CIA aid to Nicaraguan
rebels, may soon impose new
conditions on the funds, rebel
sources said yesterday.
The officially secret program
has run into trouble in Congress
in the wake of revelations that
CIA officers supervised the
rebels' mining of Nicaraguan
harbors, but the administration
still hopes to win at least some
of a $21 million funding re
quest.
The issue is scheduled to be
debated this week in a House-
Senate conference on an emer
gency appropriation bill which
also includes $62 million in mili
tary aid for the U.S.-backed
government of El Salvador.
U.S. and Nicaraguan sources
said administration officials
have been discussing ways to

meet Congressional objections
to some rebel tactics without
crippling their ability to harass
the leftist Sandinista regime.
Among the conditions under
consideration are a ban on
sabotage operations like the
mining and a redirection of the
rebels' efforts against
Nicaraguan arms shipments to
the leftist guerrillas in El Sal
vador, the sources said.
Such conditions would force a
reversal of a CIA strategy
adopted last year, when the
agency advised the rebels that
attacks on strategic economic
targets like harbors and electri
cal generators would be the
most effective use of their lim
ited force.
"They have told us that we
probably won't get all the
money, and that we may have to
stop the mining, the economic
attacks," an official of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force,

the largest rebel group, said.
"We don't think it's a good idea,
but we can live with it. It the
United States is providing the
money, the United States can
set the conditions, and we will
follow them."
Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.),
a member of the Senate Intelli
gence Committee which over
sees the program, said he
believed the Senate might ap
prove continued aid if such con
ditions were imposed.
"It will depend a lot on how
closely prescribed those opera
tions are," Biden said on NBC
News' "Meet the Press."
The Delaware senator said he
opposed the funding because he
believes it involves the United
States in an attempt to over
throw Nicaragua's government.
But he said he would support
aid "to allow the contras to be
involved in activities that were
disrupting the flow of arms into

El Salvador."
He acknowledged that Presi
dent Reagan has promised that
overthrowing the Nicaraguan
regime is not an aim ot U.S.
policy, but said, "1 don't believe
it."
Democratic leaders in the
House of Representatives have
vowed to block any further fund
ing.
But some House aides said
that if the conference produces
a compromise that imposes
strict conditions on the rebels,
the administration might win a
majority in the House as well.
However, Congress is
unlikely to resolve the issue
before the May 6 presidential
election in El Salvador, which is
holding up consideration of fur
ther aid to the Salvadoran army,
they said.
Biden said that if the Sal
vadoran presidency is won by
rightist candidate Roberto

d'Auhuisson. Congress would
probably vote to continue mili
tary aid, but under stricter con
ditions to force the Salvudoran
regime to meet U.S. human
rights standards.
He said d'Auhuisson, who
has been accused of directing
rightist "death squads," enjoys
"littlfc respect and even less trust
among the members of the U.S.
Congress."
Biden predicted that
Congress will also reduce the
administration's aid request for
El Salvador to "the range of $30
to $40 million."
He said the conflict between
the Senate Intelligence Com
mittee and CIA Director
William Casey over whether the
panel had been informed of the
mining of Nicaragua's harbors
was partly the senators' fault.
"The committee's almost as
much at fault here as the agency
is," he said.
