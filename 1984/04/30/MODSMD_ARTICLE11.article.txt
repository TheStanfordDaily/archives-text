Reagan concludes visit
Even while admonishing the
Chinese leadership to concen
trate on "what binds us, not
what divides us," President
Reagan will conclude his six-day
trip to China in an atmosphere
far different from, and, say ob
servers, less accommodating
than, that which prevailed when
President Nixon made his his
toric visit in 1972.
The Chinese leaders denied
what some American officials
had thought would be an oppor
tunity to present a live televised
speech by Reagan to the
Chinese people. Instead, in a
delayed broadcast, they
censored portions in which
Reagan condemned the Soviet
downing of a Korean airliner
last fall and Soviet "military ex
pansionism" in Afghanistan and
Cambodia, and in which he
pointed out that "America's
troops are not massed at China's
borders" while Russia's are.
The White House expressed
"regret" at the censorship, but
anti-Soviet comments in an in
terview Reagan gave Chinese
reporters were again eliminated
when the interview was broad
cast.
To remind Reagan that they
toe an independent line and no
longer openly seek a common
front against the Russians, the
Chinese announced on the eve
of Reagan's arrival that Ivan
Arkhipov, a Soviet first deputy
prime minister, is to come to
Peking in mid-May for talks on
expanding Chinese-Soviet trade
and technical cooperation.
Nevertheless, Reagan told
Chinese leaders that the future
of Sino-American relations is
"bright with potential," and that
"we believe even greater prog
ress can be made if our future
efforts are based on 'hu jing hu
hui' (mutual respect and mutual
benefit). If we have the will to
live up to it, hu jing hu hui can

make our countries more
prosperous and more secure. It
can help us be friends, even
while recognizing that we do not
totally agree on some things
which we believe important."
Reagan appeared reluctant to
elaborate on the "differences"
to which he alluded several
times in his remarks.
Points of disagreement were
not readily in evidence in the
economic sphere, though, as
Reagan and Chinese leader
Deng Xiao-Ping concluded a se
ries of commercial agreements
which signified "an historic
step" toward peaceful coopera
tion and economic cooperation,
according to Reagan.
Both sides privately project
visions of large cooperative
ventures to develop China's vast
energy reserves. The Chinese
concession last week — accept
ing American legal conditions
on the export of American nu
clear technology — has cleared
the way for the initialing today
of a nuclear agreement that may
yield sales of $10-$ 15 billion in
American technology over the
next 15 years.
In the triangular diplomacy
practiced by Washington,
Peking and Moscow, it was
Nixon who held the trump cards
and could play off the two com
munist powers against each
other. Now, the Chinese are in
the middle, able to play the
Russian card against Reagan as
they please.
History has altered the tactics
of diplomacy. Nixon's visit took
place in the shadow of the
Chinese-Soviet border war of
1969 and amid hints from Mos
cow that is might launch a
preemptive nuclear strike
against China. Then, the
Chinese needed the implied
shelter of the American nuclear
umbrella. Today, Peking still
faces 50 Soviet divisions along
the northern frontier. China

opposes Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan, is backing Cam
bodian guerrillas against pro-
Soviet Vietnamese in Indochina
and endures border disputes
with Moscow. But with the two
superpowers at odds, with
American protection now
assumed and with no actual
fighting with Moscow in
prospect, the Chinese can afford
the luxury of letting Reagan
carry the burden of rhetorical
attacks on the Kremlin.
Reagan's visit was preceded
by a massive facelift in the
Chinese capital: Peking has
been immersed in a clean-up,
paint-up and fix-up campaign
for more than a month prior to
the arrival of Reagan and his
entourage. The state guest
house where they stayed was
refurbished at a cost of $2 mil
lion; the hotel where the presi
dent gave a formal dinner for
the Chinese leadership and that
served as the American press
center was rushed to comple
tion.
Libyans return home
Libyan diplomats left London
for home yesterday, where they
will be received as victims, not
perpetrators, of a cause celebre
which left one British
policewoman dead and 11 ex
patriate Libyans wounded.
Libya's controlled press pou:ed
out a stream of vitriol against
the British and the Americans,
who are accused of mastermind
ing a "secret plot" hatched by
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government "to
launch a siege on the diplomatic
mission building and to change
it into a center in the service of
American and British im
perialism."
Libya's attempt to portray it
self as the wronged party does
not square very well with
available intelligence, however.

According to Western sources,
the Libyan governments sent a
coded radio message to its em
bassy in London ordering the
staff to defend the building, fire
on the demonstrators and create
disturbances, including bom
bings in public places, several
hours before an unknown gun
man opened fire from inside the
embassy.
Knowledgable sources said
that the coded message was not
intercepted by American intelli
gence and passed to the British,
as some newspapers and televi
sion stations here and in Britain
have reported. Rather, the
Americans received their infor
mation from the British after
the shooting.
American specialists said the
message and the subsequent
shootings are part of an escalat
ing campaign by Libyan Presi
dent Moammar Khadafy to try
to eliminate exiles opposed to
his regime around the world.
Khadafy's bid is aided by the
apparantly strong support he
enjoys among sizable numbers
of young people, who subscribe

to the official view that Libya,
the world's most advanced
revolutionary nation, is the nat
ural target of imperial coun
terattack. Youthful groups have
played a significant role in
dealing with Khadafy's oppo
nents, including dissidents living
abroad. According to one West
ern diplomat, "This is Libya ex
porting its problems to other
countries and solving them in its
own way."
Democrats gear up
Heading into the next-to-last
round of Democratic presiden
tial primaries and caucuses, in
which 720 delegates will be se
lected over the next 9 days,
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart last
week prepared for a goal-line
stand aimed at depriving
presidential hopeful Walter
Mondale of a first ballot victory.
In keeping with his theme that
Mondale is too deeply in debt to
"special interests," Hart
launched an attack that raised
questions about the legality of
some of Mondale's indirect con

tributions from organized labor.
Mondale, who had staunchly
defended their legality, ordered
several Mondale delegate com
mittees disbanded and said that
$300,000 of the $500,000 they
had spent might be deemed
questionable and would be
returned.
If neither this attack nor the
rest of his campaigning nets him
a strong enough showing in the
crucial primaries and caucuses
which will be decided by May 8,
Hart is preparing an alternative
strategy. Some Hart aides have
begun talking of their man as
the candidate of the future —
the post-Mondale future — if
Hart does not rebound in the
Western states.
Along with the May 8 prima
ries in Ohio, Indiana, Maryland
and North Carolina, the Texas
caucuses on Saturday are critical
to Hart's electability claims,
which may already have begun
to fade.
Europeans view campaign
Hart's inevitable defeat ap

pears to be the dominant
European perception. The-
European press, which until*
recently heaped praise on Hart's
head, is now touting Mondale as
the candidate who "inspires
more confidence" on Central"
America and other issues. On.
the other hand, David Steel, the."
leader of the British Liberal
Party, commented that even if -
Mondale wins the nomination
this year, "Gary Hart must still
be reckoned with as the next
likely president of the United
States — in 1988."
A lot of Western Europeans
still appear to be searching for
their ideal candidate. The
French press, for the most part,
seems to think that President
Reagan is likely to win re
election, and there is little in
clination to view that as a dis
aster. But elsewhere, Reagan is
widely accused of having in
creased East-West tensions. Die
Zeit publisher Marion Donhoeff
recently took a full page in her
paper to lament what she con
sidered the president's failures:
corruption, insensitivity to wo
men, Latin American policy,
treatment of minorities arid
more.
Interest in this year's cam
paign appears to be running
high judging by the press
coverage, which is fuller and
more sophisticated than in
either 1976 or 1980. Attacks on
the nominating process have
flowed freely, spearheaded by
David Watt, director of the
Royal Institute of International
Affairs in London. In his weekly
column in the Times of London,
he attacked the American sys
tem as preoccupied with images
at the expense of ideas and
asserted that the United States
desperately needed "a better
educated and more discriminat
ing public opinion."
