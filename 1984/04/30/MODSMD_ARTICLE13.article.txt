! "Terrifying quake," screamed Wednesday's
Chronicle in three-inch high letters.
It was no surprise, really. All of us with Mid
western or Eastern relatives had certainly been
given plenty of warning.
"Stanford?" they asked. "That's in California,
isn't it? Hell, I'd never live in California with all
' those earthquakes. One day, you'll fall right off
into the Pacific Ocean."
Apparently, CBS radio in New York shares our
relatives' concerns. Minutes after the quake, the
network broke in on KCBS and said all lines of
communication were down and asked, more or
less, if California still existed. It sounded like
something from"The Day After."
But for those of us from California, it wasn't so
frightening.
Sure, the quake shifted a few homes off their
in Morgan Hill and broke some win
dows in San Jose. But for most of us, it was little
more than a great roller coaster ride.
• After all, three days later we read that seven
; people were killed in a series of Oklahoma tor
nadoes. And this weekend six feet of snow — with

drifts reported at 15 to 20 feet — covered parts of
Montana, leaving some residents with snowshoes
and skis as the only viable forms of transporta
tion. Elsewhere, hurricanes and floods are com
mon occurrences.
This all proves that Mother Nature can kill in a
variety of forms — and earthquakes are often
less "terrifying" than her other tricks.
Still, quakes can kill; as the Peninsula Times
Tribune warned the next day,"It could have been
worse."
That's why it was a little disturbing that most of
us just sat where we were, happy to be riding out
the quake, living the ultimate California cliche.
We heard the stories of faculty meetings imme
diately breaking up. University administrators
running for safety outdoors and of the professor
who dove under his podium to avoid the falling
debris that never fell.
We all knew they were doing the right things,
but still we didn't follow suit. We laughed. And
the Times Tribune was right. It could have been
worse. Maybe next time — and there will be a
next time — we should dive under our desks too,
no matter how silly it looks.
