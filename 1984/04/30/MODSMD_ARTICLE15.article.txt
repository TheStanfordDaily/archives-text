## Learning to define the enemy in EI Salvador 
### 
She is by any judgment a striking young wo
man. The rigors of life in the Salvadoran
countryside have given her lithe frame a
strong but slender resiliency. Rosario (not her
real name) is 15 years old, already a wo
man by Salvadoran standards. In a country
where one's family is everything, she has
nothing. She is an orphan and a refugee.

VIEWPOINT

Rosario's home village sits in the shadow of
Guazapa volcano, a guerrilla stronghold of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
(FMLN). Over the past four years, the Sal
vadoran army has launched numerous of
fensives there against the FMLN, with consi
derable support from the country's air force.
The civilian population has borne the brunt of
art escalating air war unleashed across the
country.
At the end of March 1984, the U.S.-
supplied A-37 Dragonfly attack jets bombed
arid rocketed her village. There is no way to
soften the simple and irrevocable. Her moth
er, father and six brothers and sisters died

that day. She is the only survivor.
We sit and talk in the shaded courtyard on
the grounds of a San Salvador seminary that is
now home to 1200 refugees. Rosario arrived
from Guazapa less than a month ago. It was
here that she received medical attention for
her badly burned right hand and arm, a result
of the attack.
Her family wiped out, her perfect body
scarred and crippled by fire, she speaks with
an almost dream-like serenity, of a tragedy we
have difficulty imagining. The shadow of that
other U.S. war — in faraway Southeast Asia,
unmentioned and unmentionable in U.S. mili
tary press briefings here — sweeps the Sal
vadoran countryside with the terrifying preci
sion of a bird of prey.
The faintest edge of hysteria cuts through in
her voice. Speaking quietly, her fingers
sweeping the bench, she looks straight at me,
eyes ablaze with memory that refuses to fade:
"The sound of the bombs left me deaf for
some time. When they explode there is a great
wind. The earth trembles."
Bombing victims like Rosario stream daily
into San Salvador, where an array of churches

and international relief agencies extends aid
to the several hundred thousand refugees, or
desplazados (displaced persons), who flee the
unrelieved terror in the countryside.
The desplazados are the hidden face of El
Salvador's stalemated four-year civil war.
They live in converted churches, seminary
grounds, in sprawling barrios (neighborhoods)
that have sprung up around the provincial
capitals, or in hastily built shacks along
roadsides and railroad right-of-ways.
No one knows how many there are. Es
timates run as high as 500,000 — one-tenth of
the country's population. This is aside from
the 500,000 living — mostly without legal
status — in the United States. Countless
others have sought refuge in Mexico and in
neighboring Central American countries.
Women and old people make up the bal
ance of the refugee population. Teenage boys
and adult males under 50 are strikingly ab
sent. Boys as young as 13 are picked up on the
street, "recruited" h? the army. This is com
mon, technically legal in El Salvador, and in
creasingly necessary to fill army ranks. Men
who have escaped the ranks or the wrath of

the army frequently seek work in other parts
of the country when their families flee. Many
other men, and more than a few hoys, join the
guerrillas. The middle ground is dissolving in
El Salvador.
The broadcasting antenna of Catholic
Radio YSAX is located behind the San Fran
cisco church, in the working-class Mexicanos
barrio of San Salvador. YSAX provides the
prime link with the outside world for many
campesinos in the countryside. It provides a
ray of hope for those who have organized
themselves into the Christian base communit
ies that have been primary targets for the
death squads. Through YSAX, campesinos
know that the archbishop's office in San Sal
vador will do what it can to aid and protect
those refugees lucky enough to make their
way to the relative safety of the capital city.
Consuelo (a pseudonym) tied her home in
eastern San Vicente province after the air
Torcebombe3 tfiere last December. She
rex&fls"the words of a neighbor, who told her
that she need not fear the army: "Don't
worry, someone who has done nothing wrong
has nothing to fear."

The army killed her neighbor in a post
bombing sweep operation.
Consuelo made her way to Usultan with her
children and the three orphans she took under
her care after the bombing. In the turmoil, she
lost her I.D. booklet, or cedilla.
Travel is especially dangerous without the
cedula. Buses are subject to frequent searches
by the army along the highway, and pas
sengers must show their cedillas.
Consuelo felt that whatever the risk, their
only chance for survival lay in attempting to
reach San Salvador; many refugees face the
same hard choice. To be pulled off a bus with
out a cedula can often mean death.
Consuelo says, "By the grace of God we
made it from Usutlan that day. The enemy did
not stop the bus once. As God is great, he
brought us safely to refuge."
She had referred to "the enemy" several
times in our conversation. Asked to clarify,
she gives an incredulous look, as if her words
could leave any doubt.
"The army," she says, "is the enemy."
