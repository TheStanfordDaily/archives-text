## Writing well can't hurt 
### 
About 15 years ago, I had a high
school English teacher who penned
the following note across an essay 1
had written: "Trite essays deserve
trite grades â€” C." Perhaps if some of
The Daily writers had had the

VIEWPOINT

privilege of having that particular in
structor, they would not now be pen
ning the garbage that occasionally
finds its way to the opinions page.
What has been most disappointing,
however, is the intellectual shallow
ness displayed by many of the writers
(at Stanford of all places). Too many
are guilty of mutilating history, non
sequiturs, an unreasoning venomous
dismissal of contrary viewpoints and
simply ignoring the facts. For reasons
that are not clear to me, the guilty par
ties are most frequently of the pro

socialism, anti-capitalism or virulent
anti-Reaganism viewpoint. Some of
the explantions I've heard for the phe
nomenon of poor writing include lack
of time, tunnel education, over
education (i.e., education without in
tellectual understanding), adolescent
arrogance and poor potty training.
Frankly, 1 couldn't care less what
the viewpoints are as long as they are
well thought out and have a logical
conclusion. 1 realize that there are
many demands on students' time, but,
jeepers, guys and gals, can't Stanford
students do better than babble about
such items as Webster's fourth defini
tion of Communist? By the way, I'm
neither a socialist, a capitalist or a
Reaganist. I'm only a radical prag
ma tist.
