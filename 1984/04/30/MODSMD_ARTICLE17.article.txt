## Microdisc system reveals Palo Alto centrism 
### 
The people at Microdisc seem
oblivious to the fact that that most
full-time students don't attend sum
mer session here, opting instead for
employment and relaxation in other
parts of the universe. These students
won't be able to pick up their com
puters on campus when they get their
little cards in the mail in Washington,
Texas or New York. What happens to
their orders? After 10 days,
Microdisc will "store" it for a dollar a
day, potentially adding another $100
to an order.
Microdisc's alternative? "Find
someone to pick it up for you." I
really find this a wanting option.
I suggest three options, but I'm
sure others would think of other
constructive solutions, if thought
would be given them at Microdisc.

• Microdisc, for a reasonable charge,
could offer to ship orders to summer
addresses.
• Microdisc could supply local orders
(people staying or living on or near
campus) out of their summer ship
ments, and could then fill the other
orders next September.
• Microdisc could offer to store the
systems without charge until Sept. 24.
I don't think it is rational for
Microdisc to leave students with the
option of either tallying more charges
onto their computer bills, or finding
someone to retrieve their system
when Microdisc gives the word. Let's
have a little consideration for us
non-Palo Altans.

Of mice and owls
This is a bit esoteric, but here it
goes.
Last year was an exceptionally
good year for rodents. Heavy rains
promoted luxuriant vegetative
growth. The increase in available
food led to an explosion of the goph
er, field mouse and rat population
on campus.
To combat the rodent scourge the
University has used traps, and, when
traps fail, poison. This poison is
deployed in such a way that it poses
practically no threat to human beings
It does, however, pose a threat to a
relatively silent minority: the raptors
of Stanford and its surrounding area.

Owls, American kestrels, red-tailed
hawks and other birds of prey have
benefited from the rodent explosion
and are now in danger. Often the
scream one hears far off when return
ing from the library is the cry of a
great horned owl out hunting.
It cannot distinguish a poisoned rat
from from a healthy one; in fact, one
dying from poison is probably easier
to catch. After feeding on poisoned
rodents, it is only a short while before
the bird dies. I wonder then if there is
not a biologically more sound way
available to the University of exter
minating rodent pests and saving its
birds of prey.
