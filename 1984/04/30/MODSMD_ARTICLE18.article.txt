# Why doesn't my editor like me?
## 
### 
I don't think my editor likes me.
He doesn't like me because I wouldn't tell him
what my major is. To be more precise, I told him
something different every time he asked me. Two
weeks ago I said operations research. Before that it
was chemical engineering and physics before that.
I didn't think this was such a heinous crime.
Apparently, my editor got offended. And. in the
tradition of all great newspapermen who get mad
at,"people, instead of asking me why I did what I
did. he called me names.
Ring, ring, went my phone one night.
"'Hello," went unsuspecting me.
"'Tim," went my editor on the other end. "about
this operations research."
t'Yeah?" I asked.
''We were thinking . . . something different."
"Like what?" I innocently replied.
"We were thinking . . . flatworm."
"What?"
"Yeah, we were thinking, 'Tim Quirk is a
parasitic flatworm.' "
This sarcasm was unbecoming. But I was in
trigued. My editor had called me a flatworm. This
was both mature and intellectual. When I yell at
people. I usually just call them a jerk or something.
But flatworm? This sounded worse than dickweed.
So; I looked it up. Ugh. Flatworms are not nice
thjngs to be. My editor must have been pretty mad
at tne.
Why? I suppose he thought I was making fun of
The Daily. He couldn't figure out how. but he
knew I was. Well, I was. But. there's a reason I
kept changing my major, just like there's a reason I
reprinted my interesting conversation with my
editor.

So, why won't I tell anyone my major? That's
the wrong question. What I want.to know is why
does anyone need to ask me in the first place? Who
cares? I'm still me whether I'm a physics major or
a history major.
Asking people what they major in is nothing
more than training for when we graduate and go to
cocktail parties. Then, when we're introduced to
people, we'll ask, "And what do you do?"

Do?? For Christ's sake, I can
think of ten thousand things I
want to do, and getting a job
isn't one of them. I'd like to
swim, eat, write 112 breathe, bowl
and lots of other stuff.

Majors are a means of classifying people, uncon
sciously labeling them and filing them away in or
dered little drawers so they don't threaten us.
What's scarier than someone who freelances?
Someone who doesn't have a profession, or, even
worse, someone who doesn't want one. Whenever
someone asks me what my major is, I feel like Ele
phant Man; I want to shout maniacally, "I am not a
specialist, I am a human being!"
I tell people I didn't come here to get a job â€” I
came here to learn, and they laugh and say I've
come to the wrong place. No one takes me
seriously, but I'm as serious as I can get. "Really,
what do you want to do when you graduate?"

Do?? For Christ's sake, I can think of ten thousand
things I want to do, and getting a job isn't one of
them. I'd like to swim, eat, write, breathe, bowl
and lots of other stuff. Maybe they won't let me do
those things if I don't get a job, but at least I've got
my priorities straight.
Now, why'd my editor get mad? I know he'll
print the first part of this column because he'd like
to think he's got journalistic integrity and all those
Woodward and Bernstein qualities, but his phone
call makes a point. His reaction to my ever
changing major is typical. There's something
wrong with people who won't tell you their majors.
It's not normal. They must be ashamed or em
barrassed. So he decided to put me in my place. In
stead of writing I was an operations research major
like 1 told him, he wrote, "Tim Quirk is an un
declared freshman." Ouch. That hurts.
I think calling someone undeclared at Stanford
is meant to be an insult. It's bad. It's worse than
being a parasitic flatworm. I guess being an un
declared parasitic flatworm is just about as low as
one could get. It implies that you haven't decided
how you're going to make your first million yet.
You know you're going to make a million, that's
the only reason you came to Stanford, right? But
you're not sure how.
Some of us, not many, came here to learn, and
our opinions piece in The Daily about Lebanon is
just as valid whether or not we gratuitously add
that we're majoring in international relations un
der our article. People are people, not areas of in
terest. If The Daily has any sense it will stop defin
ing students by their majors.
(Tim Quirk is an undeclared parasitic flatworm.
His column appears every other Monday.)
