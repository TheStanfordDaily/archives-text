## Members aiming for 10 percent increase Student coordinators bring life to blood donations

Lynette Wong wants your blood.
So do Julie Mermelstein and Joe Chavez.
They'd like a pint now and another in about
57 days.
Wong, Mermelstein and Chavez are three
of 28 volunteer student blood-drive coordina
tors at Stanford. The coordinators have
lormed an official campus organization, with a
purpose to publicize and organize on-campus
blood drives that focus on making donors out
of Stanford students.
Ihe coordinators work with the Stanford
University Blood Bank (SUBB), a division of
the Stanford Medical School Blood Center.
Last year, 3000 Stanford students donated
4200 pints of blood. That's about 25 percent
of the Stanford student population — five

average.

times greater than the national average.
Only five percent of the population of the
United States donates blood — totaling 12
million units from eight million people last
year.
In Europe, however, where donating blood
is a common, accepted and almost expected
activity, the U.S. and even Stanford statistics
are put to shame. Between K5 and 95 percent
of the adult population of Europe donates
blood regularly.
To help solicit more donations and get
Stanford on the right track, SUBB recruiter
Carol Christofferson organized the student
blood-drive coordinators this year. Christof
lerson stressed that the new system is more ef
fective than the old one.
In the past, Christofferson would call the
secretary at the dorm where the drive was to
be held, and the secretary would then seek a
volunteer to help with the drive. This would
lead to inconsistent turnouts, said Christoffer
son. "Each blood drive was different — some
good, some bad. It all depended upon the en
thusiasm of the volunteer."
With the new coordinators program,
though, consistency seems to have been
found. Coordinators now sign up to organize
drives in the same dorm for the whole year.
The new system is "much, much better,"
said Susan lepaske-King, the office assistant

at Wilbur Hall. "The coordinator is involved
and motivated and uses his own network in
the dorm.
"We had our most successful drive in four
years," she said. "The coordinator for that
drive was Sarah Harrow, a resident assistant
in Otero. She worked at blood drives at home
in Pittsburgh for three years, and her fall
quarter drive in Otero had 84 donors, with 36
first-timers.
"Donating blood is really a responsibility —
not one to be taken lightly," Tepaske-King
continued. "Blood banks are always under
supplied — there is never enough blood." As
a coordinator her job is to publicize and make
appointments for the drive. "Most people
didn't know what it's like to give blood," she
said.

Mermelstein concurs. "Most people are
afraid it's going to hurt," she said.
Donor Tom Lee quickly disputes that myth.
"After the initial pin-prick, it doesn't feel like
anything," he said. Lee said he has given
blood five times; "whenever 1 can."
Why doesn't everyone give if it is so easy?
"A lot of people say that they have AIDS,"
explained coordinator Wong. "I ignore that."
The fallacy that one can get AIDS from
donating blood has been severely detrimental
to blood banks.
"You can't get AIDS from donating
blood," said Wong. "Everything is totally
sterile and disposable."
Christofferson agrees. She explains that
every needle, cotton swab and band-aid is
completely sterile, used once and then thrown
away.
Another excuse is the fear of side effects.
Christofferson calls this a myth as well, saying
that 95 percent of all donors are completely
unaffected by the process, and of the 5 per
cent who suffer side effects, 99 percent of
them just feel a little dizzy while they're
waiting in the "canteen" with the nurses, who
keep a close watch on donors after they give.
The donation process is short and simple.
Donors are first asked to give a brief medical
history. The nurses then check blood pressure,

body temperature and perform a quick blood
test.
"The majority of the time is spent protect
ing the donor," said Wong.
After all the preparation, the donor is
ready; most give between 450-500 cc. of
blood, depending on the donor's body weight.
Registered nurses oversee the whole proce
dure, which takes five to eight minutes.

'Donating blood is a real responsibility -not one to be
taken lightly/

State law requires that donors then sit in the
canteen for 15 minutes to make sure they are
OK. During this time they drink juices to
replenish body fluids and eat Mrs. Field's
cookies to raise their blood sugar ("A real
drag," said coordinator Harrow laughingly).
Then, after 45 minutes or less, the donors

are free to go home.
After the donor leaves, however, the dona
tion process continues. The pint of blood is
later filtered and processed. It can be used
whole or divided up into four components:
red cells, white cells, plasma and platelets. By
doing so, each donor's blood often helps more
than one person. The platelets are used to
stop bleeding (they cause blood to clot) and
are very valuable. The red cells are oxveen-

carriers and especially useful for shock vic
tims.
SUBB also has two very unique services.
The Premature Infant Program tests blood for
CMV, cytomeglo virus. Fifty-four percent of
the population has had CMV — and didn't
know it.

"It feels like a bad cold," said Christoffer**
son.
CMV is basically harmless to adults, but to
premature infants and immuno-suppressed
patients (patients who have had surgery or are
very sick), it can be deadly. By finding blood
containing no traces of CMV, the Blood Bank
has aided the hospital in saving the lives of
premature infants.
The Blood Bank also does T-cell subset'
analysis. T-cells control immunity responses."
In victims of AIDS, for instance, the correct
helper/suppressor T-cell ratio is reversed. T
cell analysis helps the Blood Bank stop in
fected blood and also alerts donors to poten-"-
tial health problems.
The Blood Bank calculates donors' blood
types as well. After finding out that he has O
negative blood — an uncommon type —
donor Ken Groves now plans to give regu
larly.

Freshmen have proven the
best recruits — a recent
Branner drive yielded 62
donors. The Business and
Law Schools also have con
sistently good turnouts.
The worst group on
campus is the faculty and
staff, with less than 2 per
cent donating each year. Co
ordinators do admit,
however, that most of their
energies are focused on stu
dents.
Christofferson said that
having 35 percent of the stu
dents donating, a 10 percent
increase, would be great.
"Forty percent would be fan
tastic." While this would rep
resent quite a large increase
— 1200 donors — it may not
be unrealistic: The 28 stu
dent coordinators are
working on campus to
overcome excuses and obsta
cles as thev run into them.
