## Card takes 2 of 3 from USC in weekend series here 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The Stanford baseball team
captured the first two games of
its weekend series with the
seventh-ranked USC Trojans,
but failed to grab the charm the
third time around as its late rally
felt short in a 6-4 loss yesterday
at Sunken Diamond.
The defeat placed Stanford at
32-21-1 on the season and in a
second place tie with the
Trojans at 14-10 in the Pacific
-10 Conference Southern Divi
sion race. USCs avoidance of a
three-game sweep ended its
eight-game losing string and left
the Trojans, now 3K-19 overall,
in the driver's seat for an at-

large NCAA postseason tourna
ment hid due to its 4-2 record in
head-to-head competition with
the Cardinal.
"It's gonna he awful tough,"
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess said of his team's
postseason chances. "We have
to play five out of six on the
road and we have to win our
share of those."
The Trojans did little to help
the Card's cause yesterday when
they jumped on Stanford starter
Kevin Kunkel for three early
runs and then huilt a 6-0 lead
behind starter Randy
Robertson.
Kunkel, now 3-6 after collect
ing the loss, lasted just 2Vi in
nings before Rob Wassenaar
bailed him out with the score 3-
0. Wassenaar scattered three
hits the rest of the way and went

unscathed until the sixth inning,
when the Trojans nicked him
for three runs.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal of
fense sputtered. On the after
noon, the Card landed a base
runner in eight of nine innings
while collecting 11 hits, but was
also victimized by four double

plays.
In their half of the sixth,
however, the Cardinal hitters
came alive. Rick Lundblade's
two-run double cut the deficit to
6-2 and in the eighth Stanford
inched two runs closer, thanks
in part to Mike Deßenon's RBI
double. But USCs ace reliever

Rick Weible put out the lire and
sealed starter Randy
Robertson's ninth win in 12
decisions.
Marquess had a simple expla
nation for the loss: "We had
plenty of opportunities to score;
we just couldn't get the big hit.
USCs veteran mentor Rod

Dedeaux also had a simple ex
planation for his club's defeats
in the first two games. "Their
defense beat us those two ball
games. We just couldn't hit the
ball between them."
That "them" is the heart of
the Stanford defense — second
baseman Pete Stanicek,

shortstop John Verducci and
center fielder Darryl Stephens.
The latter made an outstanding
catch in each Cardinal win and
the infielders contributed with
their own defensive gems to
help stifle the dangerous Trojan
offense.
But Dedeaux forgot his

hitters, even triple-crown threat
Mark McGwire, wilted to win
ning pitchers Jeff Ballard and
John Radtke. In fact, through
the three games, Stanford
pitchers held McGwire to only
two doubles and no RBIs in 12
plate appearances.
Friday, Ballard hurled his
third straight complete-game
victory and raised his record to
7-4 in the process as the Card
literally ran roughshod over the
Trojans 7-2.
Ballard had control problems
early and surrendered a two-run
home run to Gary Snell in the
second inning, but mowed down
USC thereafter, twirling a fiye
hitter in his sixth complete game
of the campaign. He retired 16
of the last 18 men he faced.
Like Dedeaux, Ballard
praised the Cardinal defense.
"Our defense is super. It's a
shame to walk people because
they're going to catch (the ball)
if you keep it in the yard."
While Stanicek was one of
those key defenders, he also ran
his way into the record books.
By virtue of his five stolen bases
on Friday and two more on Sat
urday, the junior second sacker
established a new Stanfoird
season mark of 40, surpassing
Larry Reynolds' 38 in 1976-77.
In all, the Card swiped eight
bases in the first game, with the
majority coming while USC
starter and loser Sid Akins (8-5)
was on the mound.
"He's a right hander and he's
pretty slow to the plate," Ex
plained Stanicek. "We knew
ahead of time that if we got on,
we were running."
Down 2-1, Stanford tied the
game in the fourth inning on
Deßenon's RBI double off the
top of the fence in left field. In
the fifth, pinch-hitter Mark
Machtolf singled to opeif the in
ning, then turned the ball game


Pete Stanicek, a junior second baseman, slides safely into base en route to
breaking the single-season stolen base record this weekend. Stanicek swiped
seven bases in the three-game series, and broke the previous record of 38 in a

around when he raced home to
put the Cardinal on top 3-2
amid USC's confusion on a
hunt. The Card put the game
out of reach with a four-run
seventh.
It was a different triumph on
Saturday, if for no other reason
than the presence of ESPN tele
vision, which was on hand to
tape the contest. Radtke took
advantage of the free publicity
by garnering his first win in
more than a month with a 4-3
victory. The junior right hander
allowed eight hits in 8% innings
and got relief help from Doug
Gwaltney to ensure his seventh
win against two losses.
Radtke was also touched for
an early home run, this one to
the second batter of the game
Alby Silvera. USC's starter,
freshman Brad Brink could not
hold the lead, however, virtually
handing the Card three runs in
the bottom of the first.
Brink walked the bases full
and Walt Harris made him pay
with a line single to center that
scored two runs. Verducci fol
lowed with a run-scoring single
and Stanford had a 3-1 lead that
it would not relinquish.

Pete Stanicek, a junior second baseman, slides safely into base en route to
breaking the single-season stolen base record this weekend. Stanicek swiped
seven bases in the three-game series, and broke the previous record of 38 in a

around when he raced home to
put the Cardinal on top 3-2
amid USC's confusion on a
hunt. The Card put the game
out of reach with a four-run
seventh.
It was a different triumph on
Saturday, if for no other reason
than the presence of ESPN tele
vision, which was on hand to
tape the contest. Radtke took
advantage of the free publicity
by garnering his first win in
more than a month with a 4-3
victory. The junior right hander
allowed eight hits in 8% innings
and got relief help from Doug
Gwaltney to ensure his seventh
win against two losses.
Radtke was also touched for
an early home run, this one to
the second batter of the game
Alby Silvera. USC's starter,
freshman Brad Brink could not
hold the lead, however, virtually
handing the Card three runs in
the bottom of the first.
Brink walked the bases full
and Walt Harris made him pay
with a line single to center that
scored two runs. Verducci fol
lowed with a run-scoring single
and Stanford had a 3-1 lead that
it would not relinquish.
The Stanford baseball team
captured the first two games of
its weekend series with the
seventh-ranked USC Trojans,
but failed to grab the charm the
third time around as its late rally
felt short in a 6-4 loss yesterday
at Sunken Diamond.
The defeat placed Stanford at
32-21-1 on the season and in a
second place tie with the
Trojans at 14-10 in the Pacific

sion race. USCs avoidance of a
three-game sweep ended its
eight-game losing string and left
the Trojans, now 3K-19 overall,

large NCAA postseason tourna
ment hid due to its 4-2 record in
head-to-head competition with
the Cardinal.
"It's gonna he awful tough,"
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess said of his team's
postseason chances. "We have
to play five out of six on the
road and we have to win our
share of those."
The Trojans did little to help
the Card's cause yesterday when
they jumped on Stanford starter
Kevin Kunkel for three early
runs and then huilt a 6-0 lead
behind starter Randy
Robertson.
Kunkel, now 3-6 after collect
ing the loss, lasted just 2Vi in
nings before Rob Wassenaar
bailed him out with the score 3-
0. Wassenaar scattered three
hits the rest of the way and went

unscathed until the sixth inning,
when the Trojans nicked him
for three runs.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal of
fense sputtered. On the after
noon, the Card landed a base
runner in eight of nine innings
while collecting 11 hits, but was
also victimized by four double

plays.
In their half of the sixth,
however, the Cardinal hitters
came alive. Rick Lundblade's
two-run double cut the deficit to
6-2 and in the eighth Stanford
inched two runs closer, thanks
in part to Mike Deßenon's RBI
double. But USCs ace reliever

Rick Weible put out the lire and
sealed starter Randy
Robertson's ninth win in 12
decisions.
Marquess had a simple expla
nation for the loss: "We had
plenty of opportunities to score;
we just couldn't get the big hit.
USCs veteran mentor Rod

Dedeaux also had a simple ex
planation for his club's defeats
in the first two games. "Their
defense beat us those two ball
games. We just couldn't hit the
ball between them."
That "them" is the heart of
the Stanford defense — second
baseman Pete Stanicek,

shortstop John Verducci and
center fielder Darryl Stephens.
The latter made an outstanding
catch in each Cardinal win and
the infielders contributed with
their own defensive gems to
help stifle the dangerous Trojan
offense.
But Dedeaux forgot his

hitters, even triple-crown threat
Mark McGwire, wilted to win
ning pitchers Jeff Ballard and
John Radtke. In fact, through
the three games, Stanford
pitchers held McGwire to only
two doubles and no RBIs in 12
plate appearances.
Friday, Ballard hurled his
third straight complete-game
victory and raised his record to
7-4 in the process as the Card
literally ran roughshod over the
Trojans 7-2.
Ballard had control problems
early and surrendered a two-run
home run to Gary Snell in the
second inning, but mowed down
USC thereafter, twirling a fiye
hitter in his sixth complete game
of the campaign. He retired 16
of the last 18 men he faced.
Like Dedeaux, Ballard
praised the Cardinal defense.
"Our defense is super. It's a
shame to walk people because
they're going to catch (the ball)
if you keep it in the yard."
While Stanicek was one of
those key defenders, he also ran
his way into the record books.
By virtue of his five stolen bases
on Friday and two more on Sat
urday, the junior second sacker
established a new Stanfoird
season mark of 40, surpassing
Larry Reynolds' 38 in 1976-77.
In all, the Card swiped eight
bases in the first game, with the
majority coming while USC
starter and loser Sid Akins (8-5)
was on the mound.
"He's a right hander and he's
pretty slow to the plate," Ex
plained Stanicek. "We knew
ahead of time that if we got on,
we were running."
Down 2-1, Stanford tied the
game in the fourth inning on
Deßenon's RBI double off the
top of the fence in left field. In
