# Cardinal swingers take ninth place in Sun Devil Invitational
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
The Stanford men's golf team may not
be playing as well as it can, but it just
might be playing well enough to earn it
self an invitation to the NCAA tourna
ment.
Over the weekend, the Cardinal gol
fers went to Scottsdale, Ariz, and put on
yet another exhibition of the distinctly
mediocre play which has characterized
most of their performances this spring,
shooting their way to a tie for ninth place
in the Sun Devil Invitational. Once
again, it did not seem to be the sort of
finish which would sufficiently impress
the NCAA selection committee.
Fortunately for Stanford, however, its
three challengers for the last of the six
NCAA bids given to the Far West region
— Arizona, Pacific and Fresno State —
appeared determined to prove them
selves equally unworthy of selection. The
best that Fresno State could manage in
the Scottsdale tournament was a tie for
ninth with Stanford, while Pacific
struggled to a 13th-place finish and
Arizona wound up in 14th.
And so, despite its recent string of

below-average play, the Cardinal men
head into the Pacific-10 Championships,
beginning today in Tucson, as an odds
on bet to pick up an NCAA bid. Stanford
can effectively assure itself of a berth in
the NCAA tournament by either win
ning the Pac-10 championship outright,
or by finishing well ahead of Arizona
while Fresno State and Pacific put in a
poor showing in the Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association Championship.
The overall winner of the Sun Devil
Invitational was host-team Arizona
State, which shot 1091 over 54 holes.
UCLA finished four strokes back at
1095, while San Jose State wound up in
third at 1101. Stanford finished a dis
couraging 43 strokes behind ASU with a
final total of 1134.
Jim Carter of ASU, the defending
NCAA champion, fired a 3-under-par
213 to emerge the low individual scorer.
The best performance by a Stanford
player was sophomore Carl Wagner's
224, followed by classmate Don
Walsworth at 226 and senior Tim Robin
son at 227. Senior Lanny Sawchuck shot
230 for the tournament, while junior

Scott Erickson and senior Doug
Thompson finished at 233.
Erickson, the team's No. 2 golfer, of
fered one explanation for the team's puz
zling inabilty to play up to its great po
tential this year — the pressure of
representing a team which has won the
NCAA championship six times.
"People expect us to play a lot better
than we do," said Erickson, a native of
nearby Phoenix for whom the Scottsdale
tournament was a homecoming of sorts.
"They think we shouldn't even have to
worry about getting an NCAA bid. I
know I've put a little pressure on myself
as a result of that."
Nonetheless, Erickson feels that if the
team does play up to its potential, it
stands a very good chance of winning the
Pac-10 championship and finishing
among the top 10 in the NCAA tourna
ment. "We're from a strong district, and
we've faced tough competition all year,"
he said, noting that this would give the
Cardinal an advantage over many of the
eastern teams invited to the NCAA
tournament.
Now all they have to do is get in.
