# No frosh in theme houses
## Committee recommends housing changes 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
In an interim report released last
week, the faculty Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (CUS) proposed
broad changes in the residential sys
tem, including the recommendation
that freshmen not be assigned to eth
nic theme houses.
The committee also recommended
that residential fraternities and future
residential sororities be filled by the
draw, and that no priority or quota
system based on ethnicity be used for
ethnic theme houses.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who reviewed the report last
week and made some suggestions for
changes, said, "1 think the recommen
dations will ultimately strengthen the
freshmen program and make possible
stronger themes that over time will
respond to student interest."
Lyons said that once the final report
comes out it is "not yet clear where it
goes. Depending on what the final
recommendations are, some might go
to the Senate, some to me and some to
the president, who ultimately has final
say on all such things," he said.
Lyons said it is also not yet clear
whether the recommendations on
fraternities and sororities will be in
cluded in the committee's final report.
"It's likely that the recommendation
will just be made to the fraternity and
sorority task force," he said referring
to a task force which will report its find
ings on fraternities and sororities in
early June. "The most weighty recom
mendation concerning them
(fraternities and sororities) will come
out of the fraternity and sorority task
force.
"It's an opinion held strongly by a
number on campus that University
residences be filled by the draw,"
Lyons added. "That's one of the
things the task force is considering."
Bruce Parker, professor or radiol
ogy and pediatrics and CUS chairman
said the report's ultimate impact if
impossible to predict. "The report has
no regulatory effect" he said. "At this
point we are interested in getting addi

tional input for the final report which
will be issued at the end of the quar
ter." Parker said the preliminary
report would be discussed at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting Thursday.
The committee, consisting of seven
faculty members, three students and
four ex officio members, has been
meeting since November to review the
findings of the Subcommittee on Resi
dential Education and Advising (S
-REA), which met for two years and
submitted its report last autumn.
The committee also recommended
that enough all-freshmen houses be
available to house freshmen choosing
that option. According to Lyons, ap
proximately 70 percent of incoming
freshmen indicate that they would

prefer to live in all-freshmen dorms,
though only 60 percent of the fresh
men are assigned to these residences.
While most recommendations in the
report were reportedly based on a
consensus, a dissenting opinion from
three members is included over the
issue of whether freshmen should be
eligible for ethnic theme houses.
"Surely some of the minority stu
dents who say they want to live in eth
nic theme houses as freshmen do so
because they want to maintain and
reinforce their sense of their ethnic
identity in a University which they
know full well is predominately
Caucasian in student body, faculty
and staff and which they feel will try to
swallow them up in the majority cul
ture," the minority said.
Other recommendations on theme
houses were that these houses should
include no students who lack interest
and commitment to the academic
theme, that theme houses should be
placed in physical facilities whose size
and amenities best support the pro
grams and facilitate their success, and
that S-REA be responsible for the de
velopment of criteria for establish
ment, continuation, and termination
of theme houses.
According to senior Ken Mertzel. a
student on the committee, "All the
recommendations are intended to
strengthen the theme houses. We
decided that theme houses were
definitely something useful so our dis
cussion was how to improve them."
Mertzel said, however, that first
priority was given to what would be
best for the students. "If freshmen
want to be exposed to a lot of different
experiences, that's more important
than just keeping a theme house
going. To fill the house with people
who are uninterested seems to be
defeating the purpose."
Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of
humanities and sciences and an ex
officio member of the committee, said
that the recommendations of the com
mittee might make theme houses
smaller but also stronger.
"It looks like putting them in
smaller houses would be beneficial,"
she said.
Arturo Pacheco, associate dean of

the School of Education and resident
fellow of Casa /apata. disagreed with
the committee's recommendation to
eliminate freshmen from ethnic theme
houses.
"It would be tremendously damag
ing to both the theme house and the
freshmen." he said. Pacheco said that
the resident fellows of the theme
houses told the committee they
favored theme houses with freshmen
and that the committee recommended
"exactly the opposite.
"The report was fashioned by
people who have little or no experi
ence in theme houses." Pacheco said.
"The report neglects cultural differ
ences in this country. It doesn't ad
dress those issues at all," he said.
"We've had very strong academic
programs in /apata, but in addition
we have a lot of cultural reasons for
existing together as a community. I
think there's much more than
academics yet the report talks about
the intellectual parameter as if it were
the only thing that counts," he said.
Mertzel said the recommendation
that fraternities and sororities be filled
by the draw was made on "principle"
and not specific problems. "We feel
that fraternities are more of an excep
tion on campus right now and we were
trying to bring more uniformity into
the residential system," he said.
The report says that residential
fraternities and sororities "are given
unique rights of self-selection,
however, not available to any other
campus-based residential unit." It also
states that "self-selection appears to
us antithetical to the goals of the Resi
dential Education Program and seems
to exist for social, not academic
purposes."

Lyons added. "That's one of the
things the task force is considering."
Bruce Parker, professor or radiol
ogy and pediatrics and CUS chairman
said the report's ultimate impact if
impossible to predict. "The report has
no regulatory effect" he said. "At this
point we are interested in getting addi

tional input for the final report which
will be issued at the end of the quar
ter." Parker said the preliminary
report would be discussed at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting Thursday.
The committee, consisting of seven
faculty members, three students and
four ex officio members, has been
meeting since November to review the
findings of the Subcommittee on Resi
dential Education and Advising (S
-REA), which met for two years and
submitted its report last autumn.
The committee also recommended
that enough all-freshmen houses be
available to house freshmen choosing
that option. According to Lyons, ap
proximately 70 percent of incoming
freshmen indicate that they would

prefer to live in all-freshmen dorms,
though only 60 percent of the fresh
men are assigned to these residences.
While most recommendations in the
report were reportedly based on a
consensus, a dissenting opinion from
three members is included over the
issue of whether freshmen should be
eligible for ethnic theme houses.
"Surely some of the minority stu
dents who say they want to live in eth
nic theme houses as freshmen do so
because they want to maintain and
reinforce their sense of their ethnic
identity in a University which they
know full well is predominately
Caucasian in student body, faculty
and staff and which they feel will try to
swallow them up in the majority cul
ture," the minority said.
Other recommendations on theme
houses were that these houses should
include no students who lack interest
and commitment to the academic
theme, that theme houses should be
placed in physical facilities whose size
and amenities best support the pro
grams and facilitate their success, and
that S-REA be responsible for the de
velopment of criteria for establish
ment, continuation, and termination
of theme houses.
According to senior Ken Mertzel. a
student on the committee, "All the
recommendations are intended to
strengthen the theme houses. We
decided that theme houses were
definitely something useful so our dis
cussion was how to improve them."
Mertzel said, however, that first
priority was given to what would be
best for the students. "If freshmen
want to be exposed to a lot of different
experiences, that's more important
than just keeping a theme house
going. To fill the house with people
who are uninterested seems to be
defeating the purpose."
Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of
humanities and sciences and an ex
officio member of the committee, said
that the recommendations of the com
mittee might make theme houses
smaller but also stronger.
"It looks like putting them in
smaller houses would be beneficial,"
she said.
Arturo Pacheco, associate dean of

the School of Education and resident
fellow of Casa /apata. disagreed with
the committee's recommendation to
eliminate freshmen from ethnic theme
houses.
"It would be tremendously damag
ing to both the theme house and the
freshmen." he said. Pacheco said that
the resident fellows of the theme
houses told the committee they
favored theme houses with freshmen
and that the committee recommended
"exactly the opposite.
"The report was fashioned by
people who have little or no experi
ence in theme houses." Pacheco said.
"The report neglects cultural differ
ences in this country. It doesn't ad
dress those issues at all," he said.
"We've had very strong academic
programs in /apata, but in addition
we have a lot of cultural reasons for
existing together as a community. I
think there's much more than
academics yet the report talks about
the intellectual parameter as if it were
the only thing that counts," he said.
Mertzel said the recommendation
that fraternities and sororities be filled
by the draw was made on "principle"
and not specific problems. "We feel
that fraternities are more of an excep
tion on campus right now and we were
trying to bring more uniformity into
the residential system," he said.
The report says that residential
fraternities and sororities "are given
unique rights of self-selection,
however, not available to any other
campus-based residential unit." It also
states that "self-selection appears to
us antithetical to the goals of the Resi
dential Education Program and seems
to exist for social, not academic
purposes."
In an interim report released last
week, the faculty Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (CUS) proposed
broad changes in the residential sys
tem, including the recommendation
that freshmen not be assigned to eth
nic theme houses.
The committee also recommended
that residential fraternities and future
residential sororities be filled by the
draw, and that no priority or quota
system based on ethnicity be used for
ethnic theme houses.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who reviewed the report last
week and made some suggestions for
changes, said, "1 think the recommen
dations will ultimately strengthen the
freshmen program and make possible
stronger themes that over time will
respond to student interest."
Lyons said that once the final report
comes out it is "not yet clear where it
goes. Depending on what the final
recommendations are, some might go
to the Senate, some to me and some to
the president, who ultimately has final
say on all such things," he said.
Lyons said it is also not yet clear
whether the recommendations on
fraternities and sororities will be in
cluded in the committee's final report.
"It's likely that the recommendation
will just be made to the fraternity and
sorority task force," he said referring
to a task force which will report its find
ings on fraternities and sororities in
early June. "The most weighty recom
mendation concerning them
(fraternities and sororities) will come
out of the fraternity and sorority task
force.
"It's an opinion held strongly by a
number on campus that University
residences be filled by the draw,"
Lyons added. "That's one of the
things the task force is considering."
Bruce Parker, professor or radiol
ogy and pediatrics and CUS chairman
said the report's ultimate impact if

tional input for the final report which
