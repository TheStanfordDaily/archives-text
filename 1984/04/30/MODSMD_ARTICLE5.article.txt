### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer 
About 50 Black Student Union a
(BSU) members and Ujamaa resi- I
dents last night protested last week's
recommendation by the Committee t
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) that t
freshmen not be placed in ethnic
theme houses. i
During a two-hour discussion at
Ujamaa, the group generally sup
ported CUS' recommendations that
Ujamaa and other ethnic theme
houses adopt a stronger academic em
phasis, and that the ethnic priority for
theme houses be eliminated.
Members of the group also pro
posed that Ujamaa have
"independent food service," an item
not mentioned in the committee
report.
A BSU committee will consider the
proposals discussed at the meeting and
then write a letter to the Faculty Sen
ate. The Senate will take up the CUS
recommendations at its May -
meeting.
The CUS report also suggested that
theme houses which could not fill
av:i i I 'A hie snaces with interested stu

dents consider relocation to smaller
houses, and the BSU group reluctantly
agreed to consider that option for
Ujamaa.
Students at the meeting emphasized
that freshmen are needed for the con
tinued success of Ujamaa.
"We need frosh vitality; they are
usually the most active house mem
bers," said junior Cynthia Moore,
chairperson of the BSU's Ujamaa
committee.
Sophomore David Troutt, editor of
the BSU's The Real News, said,
"Most of the blacks that come to live
here as upperclassmen lived here as
freshmen."
"The BSU has decided that that's
, out of the question," said Rhonda
: Trotter, BSU chairperson, in regard ti
the exclusion of freshmen,
e Currently, about 40 of Ujamaa'
d 120 residents are freshmen.
i- Participants were concerned that
5' move to a row-type house would ri
3 quire the reduction of Ujamaa's si/
to 60 pcop/c. However, junior Duvr
t Porter, BSU treasurer, seemed r<
voice the consensus opinion when he
said he would support a move to the
row "if we have one of the larger row
houses, freshmen, a resident fellow
and independent food service."
The group also decided to propose
"a stronger academic basis" for
Ujamaa and a seminar requirement
for upperclassmen.
"Without the academic component,
Ujamaa will suffer the same problem
it's always faced â€” being seen as a
'hangout,' " said Ron Hudson,
Ujamaa's resident fellow and the as
sistant dean of student affairs.

The group, after much discussion,
eventually agreed with the report s
suggestion that "the existing priority
tor ethnic theme houses which is given
to members of ethnic minorities he
abolished, as well as the rule that no
more than 50 percent ot places in the
house can he filled hy students claim
ing priority as members of the ethnic
group."
