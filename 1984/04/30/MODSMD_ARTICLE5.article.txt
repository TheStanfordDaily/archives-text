About 50 Black Student Union a
(BSU) members and Ujamaa resi- I
dents last night protested last week's
recommendation by the Committee t
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) that t
freshmen not be placed in ethnic
theme houses. i
During a two-hour discussion at
Ujamaa, the group generally sup

Ujamaa and other ethnic theme
houses adopt a stronger academic em
phasis, and that the ethnic priority for
theme houses be eliminated.
Members of the group also pro
posed that Ujamaa have
"independent food service," an item
not mentioned in the committee
report.
A BSU committee will consider the

then write a letter to the Faculty Sen

theme houses which could not fill

Ujamaa.
Students at the meeting emphasized

chairperson of the BSU's Ujamaa
committee.
Sophomore David Troutt, editor of
the BSU's The Real News, said,
"Most of the blacks that come to live
here as upperclassmen lived here as
freshmen."
"The BSU has decided that that's
, out of the question," said Rhonda

the exclusion of freshmen,
