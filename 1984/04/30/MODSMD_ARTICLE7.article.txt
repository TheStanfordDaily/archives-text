constitute "the gut issue" in the ongoing dispute
between the University and the tederal govern
"l don't think anybody's going to tind evidence

loss of militarily significant information trom this

Kennedy recently jointed the presidents of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology andi the
California Institute of Technology in warning DoD

authorities that "it would be impossible tor our in
stitutions - and for the majonty of Amer ' ca . un '"

Kennedy added that there has been some
■■encouraging movement 1 ; in the forum by fede a
officials and indicated his own support for bnet
delays in publication in those limited instances

There are "strong" internal policy differences
within government agencies where "policy people
are concerned with technology leakage, and sci
entific researchers "recognize that you can t dance
very well when you're watching your teet all the
time." Kennedy said.

from degenerating "to the point where the issue is
who can get whose congressman to make the most
angrv call to the agency.
• I know from my own time in government that s
not the most productive way to resolve differ
ences," said the former head of the Food and Drug
Administration.
In the long run, greater cooperation betwen uni
versities and industry on this issue "might be use
ful " although business is much more concerned
with controls on the export of hardware than are
universities, Kennedy said.
