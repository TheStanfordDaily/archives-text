China signs mine agreement
with Occidental Petroleum
Peking —China entered into its most ambitious collabora
tion with Western capitalism yesterday, signing an agreement
with Occidental Petroleum Corp. to jointly develop the
world's potentially largest open-pit coal mine at a cost ex
pected to reach $640 million.
The deal — its signing was timed by Occidental's chairman,
Armand Hammer, to coincide with President Reagan's visit
here — is expected eventually to yield 45 million tons of coal
yearly from the mine in central China.
It is the latest example of what is becoming an extensive
commitment of private American capital to development of
China's energy sector as the nation modernizes. U.S. oil com
panies have targeted $500 million for the exploration of off
shore oil.
Hammer, 86. who pioneered American business dealings in
the Soviet Union decades ago, came to Peking to sign the
agreement in a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. The
project, he said in a statement, "combines the best of Ameri
can know-how, technology and managerial systems with
China's recognized commitment to modernize development
and production of its natural resources."
Hammer, speaking to reporters, said the agreement would
be formalized in a contract in July, capping four years of
negotiations complicated by the drop in international coal
prices. Occidental plans to begin production in 1987, exploit
ing a mine in rural Shanxi Province with proven reserves said
to reach 1.4 billion tons of coal. Initial output is expected to
be 15 million tons annually, with the yield tripling in later
phases of the project, Hammer said.
The potential profits of the Occidental deal are huge. Even
at currently depressed coal prices, 1 5 million tons could earn
$600 million on the international market.
Contadora talks commence
Panama City, Panama —Foreign ministers of nine Latin
American nations began arriving here yesterday for a review
of negotiations in the search for peace in Central America,
but hopes for an early negotiated end to the regional conflicts
appeared dim.
Diplomatic observers said that this latest round in the so
called Contadora process was effectively undermined when
three Central American countries published details last week
of secret negotiating positions that had emerged during the
talks.
"It is very difficult for these countries to reach an agree
ment at this time," Colombian Foreign Minister Rodrigo
Lloreda Caicedo said upon his arrival here. Colombia, to
gether with Mexico, Venezuela and Panama, compose the
Contadora Group, which has been searching for a peaceful
solution to Central American controversies since January,
1983.
The four Contadora foreign ministers and their counter
parts from five Central American nations — Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua — will meet
today to examine a series of draft agreements prepared by
their representatives.
On Thursday, a joint declaration by El Salvador, Costa
Rica and Honduras was published that openly discussed
, negotiating positions for the first time since the Contadora
process began.
"Nicaragua has rejected the idea of achieving a regional
military and security equilibrium in Central America,"the
three countries charged, "claiming that it will accept no limits
on its right to arm itself since its problems are with the United
States and not with its neighbors."
Israel fights Jewish terrorism
Jerusalem —Stung by complaints of police laxity in com
bating violence by Jews against Arabs, Israel's security forces
have launched a tough new campaign against Jewish ter
rorism, apparently including infiltration of spies into radical
nationalistic organizations headquartered in the occupied
West Bank.
A senior official, talking to reporters after yesterday's regu
lar meeting of the Cabinet, said the government recently
made a "difficult decision" to employ against Jewish ter
rorism some of the same methods that traditionally have been
used to combat Arab terrorism.
The official, who did not wish to be identified by name, said
the program paid off when police foiled a sophisticated plan
to bomb Arab buses when they would have been jammed
with passengers returning from Friday mosque services.
Police have provided only sketchy details of the case, but it
is now known that about 35 persons, all of them Jewish, have
been arrested so far. Most were residents of Jewish settle
ments in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River or the
annexed Golan Heights, although some came from commun
ities inside Israel's pre-1967 borders.
Police rounded up about 1 5 of the suspects yesterday in the
second wave of arrests. Most of the rest had been arrested
Friday, although the case was kept secret until Saturday.
Several of the suspects appeared in court yesterday and
were ordered held in jail for 15 days to provide time for a
complete investigation. The court refused to permit publica
tion of the names of the suspects or of any information that
could identify them. However, Israeli press, radio and televi
sion reports said those arrested included several prominent
West Bank citizens including some active in the Gush
Emunim organization, which sponsors Jewish settlement of
the occupied territories.
The Davar newspaper said police acted on the basis of in
formation from a secret agent working inside the organization
that planned the attack. Security sources declined to confirm
the report although all of the circumstantial evidence seemed
to point in that direction.
Senate debate on deficit slows
Washington —The Republican-led Senate is trying to chip
away at high federal deficits with a new round of budget cuts,
but election-year politics is slowing the pace of debate to a
crawl, even by ponderous Senate standards.
The Senate has moved barely an inch since Tuesday, when
it first took up the three-year, $144 billion deficit reducing
package supported by President Reagan. Cuts in federal pro
grams are politically sensitive in a year in which one-third of
the seats in the Senate are up for grabs.
With some 38 amendments still pending, it seemed likely
the Senate will spend this entire week on the bill.
"We will just keep plowing through it," said Senate
Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), who has called
the Reagan package, worked out with Senate GOP leaders,
"the best we can get."
However, Senate Democrats are pressing for deeper cuts in
military spending.
The Reagan plan would let defense grow each year by more
than 7 percent above the rate of inflation. It would freeze
most discretionary spending in 1985 and let it grow by the
rate of inflation in 1986 and 1987. It would not touch Social
Security and other guaranteed-payment benefit programs.
The $144 billion plan includes a $47 billion tax increase
already approved.

here — is expected eventually to yield 45 million tons of coal
yearly from the mine in central China.
It is the latest example of what is becoming an extensive
commitment of private American capital to development of
China's energy sector as the nation modernizes. U.S. oil com
panies have targeted $500 million for the exploration of off
shore oil.
Hammer, 86. who pioneered American business dealings in
the Soviet Union decades ago, came to Peking to sign the
agreement in a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. The
project, he said in a statement, "combines the best of Ameri
can know-how, technology and managerial systems with
China's recognized commitment to modernize development
and production of its natural resources."
Hammer, speaking to reporters, said the agreement would
be formalized in a contract in July, capping four years of
negotiations complicated by the drop in international coal
prices. Occidental plans to begin production in 1987, exploit
ing a mine in rural Shanxi Province with proven reserves said
to reach 1.4 billion tons of coal. Initial output is expected to
be 15 million tons annually, with the yield tripling in later
phases of the project, Hammer said.
The potential profits of the Occidental deal are huge. Even
at currently depressed coal prices, 1 5 million tons could earn
$600 million on the international market.
Contadora talks commence
Panama City, Panama —Foreign ministers of nine Latin
American nations began arriving here yesterday for a review
of negotiations in the search for peace in Central America,
but hopes for an early negotiated end to the regional conflicts
appeared dim.
Diplomatic observers said that this latest round in the so
called Contadora process was effectively undermined when
three Central American countries published details last week
of secret negotiating positions that had emerged during the
talks.
"It is very difficult for these countries to reach an agree
ment at this time," Colombian Foreign Minister Rodrigo
Lloreda Caicedo said upon his arrival here. Colombia, to
gether with Mexico, Venezuela and Panama, compose the
Contadora Group, which has been searching for a peaceful
solution to Central American controversies since January,
1983.
The four Contadora foreign ministers and their counter
parts from five Central American nations — Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua — will meet
today to examine a series of draft agreements prepared by
their representatives.
On Thursday, a joint declaration by El Salvador, Costa
Rica and Honduras was published that openly discussed
, negotiating positions for the first time since the Contadora
process began.
"Nicaragua has rejected the idea of achieving a regional
military and security equilibrium in Central America,"the
three countries charged, "claiming that it will accept no limits
on its right to arm itself since its problems are with the United
States and not with its neighbors."
Israel fights Jewish terrorism
Jerusalem —Stung by complaints of police laxity in com
bating violence by Jews against Arabs, Israel's security forces
have launched a tough new campaign against Jewish ter
rorism, apparently including infiltration of spies into radical
nationalistic organizations headquartered in the occupied
West Bank.
A senior official, talking to reporters after yesterday's regu
lar meeting of the Cabinet, said the government recently
made a "difficult decision" to employ against Jewish ter
rorism some of the same methods that traditionally have been
used to combat Arab terrorism.
The official, who did not wish to be identified by name, said
the program paid off when police foiled a sophisticated plan
to bomb Arab buses when they would have been jammed
with passengers returning from Friday mosque services.
Police have provided only sketchy details of the case, but it
is now known that about 35 persons, all of them Jewish, have
been arrested so far. Most were residents of Jewish settle
ments in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River or the
annexed Golan Heights, although some came from commun
ities inside Israel's pre-1967 borders.
Police rounded up about 1 5 of the suspects yesterday in the
second wave of arrests. Most of the rest had been arrested
Friday, although the case was kept secret until Saturday.
Several of the suspects appeared in court yesterday and
were ordered held in jail for 15 days to provide time for a
complete investigation. The court refused to permit publica
tion of the names of the suspects or of any information that
could identify them. However, Israeli press, radio and televi
sion reports said those arrested included several prominent
West Bank citizens including some active in the Gush
Emunim organization, which sponsors Jewish settlement of
the occupied territories.
The Davar newspaper said police acted on the basis of in
formation from a secret agent working inside the organization
that planned the attack. Security sources declined to confirm
the report although all of the circumstantial evidence seemed
to point in that direction.
Senate debate on deficit slows
Washington —The Republican-led Senate is trying to chip
away at high federal deficits with a new round of budget cuts,
but election-year politics is slowing the pace of debate to a
crawl, even by ponderous Senate standards.
The Senate has moved barely an inch since Tuesday, when
it first took up the three-year, $144 billion deficit reducing
package supported by President Reagan. Cuts in federal pro
grams are politically sensitive in a year in which one-third of
the seats in the Senate are up for grabs.
With some 38 amendments still pending, it seemed likely
the Senate will spend this entire week on the bill.
"We will just keep plowing through it," said Senate
Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), who has called
the Reagan package, worked out with Senate GOP leaders,
"the best we can get."
However, Senate Democrats are pressing for deeper cuts in
military spending.
The Reagan plan would let defense grow each year by more
than 7 percent above the rate of inflation. It would freeze
most discretionary spending in 1985 and let it grow by the
rate of inflation in 1986 and 1987. It would not touch Social
Security and other guaranteed-payment benefit programs.
The $144 billion plan includes a $47 billion tax increase
already approved.

China signs mine agreement
with Occidental Petroleum
Peking —China entered into its most ambitious collabora
tion with Western capitalism yesterday, signing an agreement
with Occidental Petroleum Corp. to jointly develop the
world's potentially largest open-pit coal mine at a cost ex
pected to reach $640 million.
The deal — its signing was timed by Occidental's chairman,
Armand Hammer, to coincide with President Reagan's visit
