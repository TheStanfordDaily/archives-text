From The Washington Post
President Reagan put aside differences with Chinese
leaders today to stress the historic ties between the
United States and China and declare that the two na
tions had reached •"the point where we can build the
basis for a lasting friendship."
In a speech prepared for delivery at Fudan Univer
sity here, the president, who once had viewed China as
a bitter foe, quoted approvingly from the late Chinese
Communist leader Chou En-lai, saying the United
States and China should become "pairing neighbors."
"Your government's policy of forging closer ties to
the free exchange of knowledge has not only enlivened
your economy, it has opened the way to a new conver
gence of Chinese and American interests," Reagan
said. "You have opened the door — and let me assure
you that ours is open also."
Reagan's words underscored the actions he was
scheduled to take at a departure ceremony in Peking's
Great Hall of the People where he and Chinese
Premier Zhao Ziyang were to sign a tax agreement de
signed to encourage private U.S. investment in China

as weii as a new cultural exchange accord.
The cultural accord restores and broadens formal ex
changes that were interrupted by the Chinese after the
Reagan administration granted political asylum to
China's leading woman tennis player. Hu Na. in 1983.
The tax agreement, based on similar treaties the United
States has with many other nations, will prevent double
taxation and give U.S. investors knowledge of the tax
consequences of doing business in China.
Both agreements had been worked out long before
Reagan came to China, but the president used the occa
sion of their signing to smooth over differences that
surfaced in Peking during three days of meetings with
Chinese leaders.
The differences centered on Taiwan, a subject on
which both sides agreed that no viewpoints had been
changed by Reagan's visit, and on global issues. The
Chinese objected to U.S. deployment of nuclear
missiles in Western Europe and to U.S. policy in
Central America and the Middle East. On successive
days they also censored Reagan speeches on Chinese
television, deleting passages in which he criticized the
Soviet Union and promoted democratic ideals.

In his return toast Saturday night, /.hao said, "The
current visit hv President Reagan once again shows that
frank and sincere dialogue is a bridge enabling us to
continue to explore ways of increasing trust so as to es
tablish a stable and enduring relationship.
The dialogue was described as "frankest." the term
used hv diplomats for disagreements, when Reagan and
the Chinese leaders talked of global issues. China made
it clear that it does not approve ot U.S. policy in
Central America and the Middle hast or ot its deploy
ment of medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
Chinese leaders tried to play down the censorship,
insisting that the state-run media have devoted unusual
attention to Reagan s visit, allegedly more than Zhao
received from the American press when he toured the
United States in January.
Both sides seemed eager to stress the positive aspects
of the visit, particularly the U.S. commitment to
cooperate with China in economic development.
Reagan and Deng appeared relaxed and triendly in
their picture-taking sessions and joked about their ad
vancing age.
