# Committee to vote on African plan
## Shares to go against apartheid 
### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
The University will vote its shares of
Standard Oil of California stock at the
company's annual meeting tomorrow
in favor of a resolution which attempts
to deal with apartheid in South Africa.
According to Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody, a member of the Uni
versity's President's Commission on
Investment Responsibility, the pro
posal calls for Standard Oil to adopt
resolutions in favor of fair labor
practices and investments in black
education and training.
"Standard Oil has been a pioneer in
supporting principles which deal with
apartheid, but now we're asking them
to adopt resolutions which take them
into two new areas having to do with
influx controls," Brody said.
According to Brody, influx controls
prevent black South African workers
from migrating with their families into
cities.
"The workers aren't able to bring
their families with them, and it's these
internal restrictions which we believe
cause social injury," he said.
The shareholder proposal sup
ported by the University favors the
adoption of resolutions outlined by
Bishop Desmond Tutu, general secre
tary of the South African Council of
Churches.
According to the resolutions, corpo
rations will also call for labor mobility
and announce to the South African
government their opposition to influx
controls.
The recognition of representative
black trade unions and the presenta
tion by corporations of family-type ac
commodations for workers are also in
cluded in the resolutions.
II adopted, the resolutions will ef
fect Caltex Petroleum, a jointly owned
subsidiary of Standard Oil and

Texaco.
The President's Commission on In
vestment Responsibility, composed of
faculty, students, staff and alumni,
gave a unanimous recommendation to
the Board of Trustees on April 20 in
favor of the shareholder resolution.
Brody said the commission was
satisfied with the resolutions since
"they didn't ask the company to break
the law in any way."
The Board of Trustees Special
Committee on Investment Responsi
bility accepted the recommendation to
vote the university's 156,400 shares at
the shareholders' meeting tomorrow.
According to Brody. the University
will also send a letter to Standard Oil,
commending the corporation for its
past adoption of similiar resolutions.
"Basically, we're telling them that
they've done a great job in the past
and we'd like to see them continue,"
he said.
Though most shareholder proposals
only receive a minority vote, Brody
said Standard Oil might still volun
tarily adopt Bishop Tutu's resolutions.
"There's also the fact that Stanford
carries influence, and we can help
bring moral pressure to bear," he said.
The President's Commission on In
vestment Responsibility will consider
separately a similiar proposal to
Texaco.
"We'll have to consider it separately
to see what other conditions it may
have," Brody said. "But I expect it to
be nearly the same as Standard Oil's,
and then we'll probably recommend
its support to the Board of Trustees.
"In any case, we do have a responsi
bility to advise the Trustee committee
on areas of business activity which we
feel involve social injury, and there
are numerous actions we can recom
mend besides support of a sharehold
ers' proposal,'! he said.
