## Simple is best 
### 
When the Soviets walked out of the Geneva
talks on limiting nuclear forces in Europe last No
vember, President Reagan said he was disap
pointed with them. "The United States will never
walk away from the negotiating table," he said.
And if you look at the record since the walkout
— or "suspension," as the administration prefers
to call it — you can't honestly accuse the presi
dent of not sticking to his guns. After all, it was
only a month ago that the Soviets said they might
be willing to discuss a comprehensive superpower
ban on anti-satellite weapons.
The administration's argument against such a
ban was simple enough: You can't walk away
from the negotiating table if you won't go to it.
Meanwhile, build bargaining chips.
The past five months have confirmed that the
simple road really is best. And that's the beauty of
the administration's latest arms deal, the chemical
weapons draft treaty Vice President George Bush
hand-delivered a couple weeks ago to the 40-
nation United Nations Conference on Disarma
ment in Geneva.
As the president said on the brink of Bush's
mission. "Chemical weapons provide a sad exam
ple ... of past arms control failures." The admin
istration's proposal would change all that, render
ing impotent and obsolete the threat of these
armaments via a universal ban on testing, produc
tion and deployment.
As Bush pointed out amid much Geneva
fanfare, it is the simplicity of the new U.S. ap
proach that makes it so attractive. The key ele
ment, "an unprecedented open-installation
verification procedure," is especially appealing.

"This would permit international inspection
teams to visit on short notice all military or
government-owned or -controlled facilities in sig
natory countries," the vice president said. Mean
while, build bargaining chips.
It's such a simple scheme that one wonders why
past administrations favored more complicated
approaches.
in fact, the only problem seems to be that
everything in the Soviet Union is government
owned or -controlled, which means everything is
open for international inspection. How could the
president have been so thoughtless, especially in
an election year?
Philip Farley, the alternate chairman of the
U.S. delegation to SAI.T 1, suggests one possibil
ity.
"It sounds like there was a deliberate effort to
make the thing just as difficult for the Soviets as
possible," he says. A senior research fellow at
Stanford's Center for International Security and
Arms Control, Farley favors a more comprehen
sive, phased approach over the administration's
"all or nothing" package.
In that way, "You would not face the Soviet
Union with this very hard choice of accepting an
extreme degree of inspection at the early stage of
a long, drawn-out arms reduction process."
But why chisel away at a comprehensive ap
proach when you can upstage the Soviets in
Geneva instead? After all, let's not betray the
very heart of an administration that repeatedly
demonstrates its commitment to arms control.
Remember, if you can't trust the Soviets, put
your faith in simplicity. Meanwhile, build bar
gaining chips.
