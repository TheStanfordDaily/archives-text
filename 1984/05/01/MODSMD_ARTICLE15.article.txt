## Fraternities overemphasize sex

By means of the Rush book, pub

Stanford fraternities are allowed to
create the image they wish to present
to the Stanford community and to
prospective pledges. The various ad
vertisements found in the Rush book

VIEWPOINT

describe not only living quarters and
food quality, but also the social atmo
sphere generated in particular Greek
houses. The majority of the frater
nities choose to give the impression
ilia! they are primarily organizations
dI drinking and womanizing. The
drinking is the fraternity members'
own concern and has little effect on
others; however the disrespect they
show for women has a very harmful
effect on student attitudes toward
both fraternities and women at Stan
ford .
Many fraternities use the Rush
book to advertise their houses as par
lors of delight with sexually willing
women toted as the door prize. Delta
Upsilon claims: "We boast the highest
ration of D.U.I.sand I.U.D.s on
campus. Take the D.U. challenge."
Kappa Alpha promises that their
"spacious two-room doubles provide
the privacy that all consenting adults
need." This creates an image on
campus that the fraternities are little
more than orders of seduction. When
members of a fraternity spend an af
ternoon on the roof of their house
harassing passersby with sexual invita
tions or insults they only confirm this
image.
In the Rush book, these fraternities
choose to portray their members as
single-sighted men with little purpose
bevond that of sexual conquest. The

DU house depicts its membership as
"always up to something fishy. In the
famous words of Linda Lovelace,
'What more can you ask for?' " It
becomes difficult to consider such
fraternities as meaningful, positive
facets of the Stanford community.
Many individual members of these
fraternities uphold this impression by
listing majors in the Rush book such
as "consummating," "beef injec
tions," "sloppy breasts," "little girls,"
"17-year-old nymphs" and "miles of
scumming."

Many members list
majors in the Rush book
such as 'consummating/
'beef injections/ 'sloppy
breasts/ 'little girls/
'17-year-old
nymphs' . . .

At the beginning of the Rush book.
University President Donald Kennedy
writes: "The vitality of the fraternity
depends on the students working to
gether in realizing objectives in a resi
dential setting." The objectives of the
fraternity may vary, but the goal which
most emphasize in the Rush book is
sexual activity. This portrayal of wo
men as sexual objects for men's lust
and entertainment builds a very poor
image of the fraternity members — an
image of stunted intellectual develop
ment, which prevents them from
recognizing women as intellectual, not
solely sexual, beings.
Although not all Stanford fraternity

members share this view of women,
those that do have popularized this
image to the point of overwhelming
any positive impression built by other
fraternities. Seen in this light, many
fraternities not only hinder progress in
social awareness on campus, but may
in fact corrode progress already made
in this area.
Perhaps the greatest problem with
some fraternities' attitute of women as
sexual objects is that they encourage a
disrespect for both women at Stanford
and women in general. The archaic
ideal of women they present forces the
women at Stanford to fight for the
respect they are entitled to as equal
human beings.
Furthermore, fraternity members
who do not hold this view of male
dominance are pressured to prove
their opposition if they wish to avoid
blanket condemnation of fraternal
living. The unnecessary sexual tension
created becomes a too-easily accepted
part of the campus atmosphere. It is
when we accept and excuse these atti
tudes as typical of fraternities and are
therefore no longer offended by them,
that we need to re-examine our values
and decide whether we wish to ignore
this problem.
If these fraternities are not genuine
in their portrayal of women as sexual
objects, they should reconsider the
impression they present to the Stan
ford community. If they honestly view
women as the Rush book indicates,
they project a sadly limited and dis
torted view of male-female relation
ships, and Stanford students should
consider the detrimental effect these
fraternities have on campus.
