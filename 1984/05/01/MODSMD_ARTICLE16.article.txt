## U.S. hostility to Nicaragua unjustified 
### 
Robert Larkins' justification of the mining of
Nicaraguan harbors (Daily, April 25) neglected
several important points which need to be ad
dressed and which would change such an analysis
significantly.
First, he portrays congressional criticism of the
CIA operation as a partisan attack on the Reagan

VIEWPOINT

administration in an election year. Actually, the
condemnation was both overwhelming and biparti
san. Even Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.)
criticized the CIA for the first time and wrote CIA
chief William Casey that he was "pissed off' at the
CIA.
Next Larkins complains about American
liberals' "selective fits of conscience" in criticizing
oppressive regimes of the right ("friendly to us"),
but not those of the left ("openly hostile to Ameri
can interests"). Poppycock. One Soviet dissident
gets much more attention than hundreds of
Guatemalan Indians in our media, which are gen
erally accused of being liberal.
Anyway, what are these "American interests" to
which leftist regimes are so hostile? l arkins
doesn't say, but he doesn't like Nicaragua because
of its human rights violations and because it's
trying to "dominate its neighbors." This last attack
is downright silly, since Larkins clearly wants the
United States to dominate its neighbors, such as
Latin America. Who's got the double standard?
But let's look at human rights.
We can begin with "disappearances" (political
murders) and torture, which are easily the most
ile of human rights abuses. In El Salvador, both ol

these are rampant, mostly committed by the mili
tary through its semi-official death squads, but
committed by the rebels as well. Torture and poli
tical murders are widespread and systemic. In
Nicaragua, there have been a few cases of torture,
but the individuals responsible have generally been
punished by the regime. There have also been
quite a few instances in which prisoners have been
beaten — "police brutality," we call it — which is
on the border between "ill-treatment" and
"torture." Take your pick. The State Depart
ment's human rights report also mentions a few

"disappearances," while Amnesty International's
report does not. Again, take your pick. In any case,
it's obvious that El Salvador is a'lot worse than
Nicaragua.
The civil rights sphere is muddier. No one in El
Salvador has any basic rights such as privacy of the
home or habeus corpus, although there are no cen
sorship laws. In Nicaragua, on March 15, 1982, a
state of emergency was declared and some rights
were curtailed, as permitted during emergencies
under international law. Isolated excesses also oc
cur. although in one major case involving lbO
Misquito Indians, these violations were to a large
degree remedied on appeal. There is also an on-off

censorship of newspapers and films, but not of
books. Overall, Nicaragua looks only slightly bet
ter here, although it's obviously much better in
terms of international law, whatever that's worth.
Nicaragua also allows groups such as Amnesty In
ternational to inspect its prisons, something El Sal
vador would never dream of, which indicates that
Nicaragua is to some degree sensitive to interna
tional public opinion.
Larkins ends with a long discussion of Vietnam,
which we needn't get into here, much as I disagree
with his analysis. One of his claims, however,
stands out: that we hist Vietnam because the U.S.
government "failed to make its case to the public."
That's ridiculous — the government always made
its view on the issue well known. The government
lost the debate, fair and square. I.arkins wants to
intervene in Central America in the way he thinks
we should have intervened in Vietnam. for
yourself whether that's a good idea.
The strangest fact of all is neither stated nor
implied in Larkins' column: Nicaragua is a major
Central American country, while El Salvador is
not. You'd think it would be to our advantage to
make Nicaragua our ally regardless of its form of
government, or in Larkins' terms, regardless of its
human rights violations. After all, we're perfectly
capable of cooperating with China, even though it
is both a greater human rights violator and a far
greater potential threat to this country than is
Nicaragua. China is even a full-fledged communist
country, and Nicaragua far less so. There is ab
solutely no good reason for us to be so hostile to
Nicaragua.
