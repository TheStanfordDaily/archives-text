# Beating the Reagan Look
## 
### 
Last year I used to write a column for a newspaper
called The Stanford Progressive. I assume it's defunct now,
but then, everyone assumed it was defunct when I was
writing for it, so it's probably still around.
One of my columns was called "Dead Tuna On a
Beach." It was about Ronald Reagan. I claimed that
Reagan was doing so badly that in order to make the 1 984
election at all interesting, he needed some hints (the only
advice I remember was telling him to date Jodie Foster).
Boy, was that a mistake. One year later. Reagan is more
popular than a four-person suite. The Ronald Reagan
Look is threatening to eclipse the Michael Jackson Look
as our nation's fad: Instead of white gloves and untied
shoes, students are dying their hair and sleeping in the
afternoon. And the Democratic primary campaign is
beginning to resemble those scenes in the old Westerns
where the undertaker comes out and takes the sheriffs
measurements.
I feel it is up to me to preserve the democratic system in
this country by correcting this imbalance. I am offering
some issues that the Democratic candidate can use — not
in the spirit of partisanship, but because I don't want to be
prepared to stay up all night watching election returns and
have a big bowl of popcorn made only to have Roger
Mudd tell me at 4 p.m. that, based on returns from New
Jersey, Reagan has been re-elected in a landslide.
The Economy: I his is a toughie for the Democrats. Busi
ness is booming, housing starts aren't stopping and the
Dow is keeping up •• ith the Joneses.
On the other hand. /.8 percent unemployment is hardly
•'Happy Days are Here Again." And with the cancellation
of the Girl Scout cookie sale, Reagan has lost his last
chance at narrowing the budget deficit.
Reagan is going to ask the voters, "Are you better off
now than you were four years ago?" 1 don't know — high
school was pretty fun. On the other hand, in November of
1980 a girl I had had a crush on for four months turned me
down for a date to homecoming. So maybe Reagan has an
edge here.
Nicaragua: CIA involvement in the mining of
Nicaragua's harbors has brought Reagan's covert war back
to the nation's attention. He says he is only harassing the
Sandinistas to encourage them to hold elections. On this
theory I should blow up David Stockman to make sure
Reagan doesn't try anything funny.
He also says he is putting pressure on the Nicaraguans to
stop them from supporting Salvadoran guerrillas. But they
say they are only trying to pressure the Salvadoran gover
ment into not maiming and killing peasants. The Sal
vadorans in turn say they have to put pressure on the
peasants to stop them from whining about food all the
time.
Some say the Democrats cannot make an issue out of
the mining because Congress was notified beforehand. But
recently it has been revealed that Congress misunderstood
the ClA's briefing. "I thought they said they were putting
Mayans in the harbor," one senator explained. "I said OK
because they were an indigenous ethnic group."

Kd Meese: So the guy took a few $30,000 loans in return
for cushy government jobs. You want him to go hungry
and spoil America's perfect record?
The office of attorney general, however, is traditionally
given only to men of highest honor and integrity — like
John Mitchell. Giving it to Ed Meese is like giving the sec
retary of state position to Mr. T, or the Department of the
Interior to James Watt.
Reagan said it was his fault that all those
Marines got killed. Why would he say that? He knew that
all his supporters would say, "Aw, shucks, Ron. you did
your best," and that none of his opponents believe any
thing he says anyway.
If Carter pulled a stunt like sending troops to a foreign
country, letting half of them get blown up by a mad trucker

and then pulling'them out in a strategic running-away, he
would have been publically stoned. Or at least people
would think he was stoned. Yet Reagan gets away with it.
Why? I think it's possible that Reagan had this warm,
folksy, man-of-the-people charm — kind of like Joe
Stalin. Actually, it Reagan grew a moustache and started
wearing a lurry hat, there'd be a strong resemblance.
II he did this, the "Uncle Joe" Look would soon sweep
our nation s high schools. Students would wear bulky Red
Army uniforms and start collectivizing agriculture.
Well, at least it's better than running around with your
shoes untied.
