## Linzmeier makes a splash on U.S. swimming scene 
### PETER HAVEN 
Marybeth Linzmeier started
her swimming career as a 9-
year-old trying to heat the heat
in Visalia, California, and now
she may be on the verge of en
ding it with an Olympic gold
medal this summer in Los An
geles.
In what should be the Car
dinal co-captain's second-to-last
year of competition, Linzmeier
has stopped out of school this
quarter to train for the U.S.
Olympic Team Trials in In
dianapolis starting June 25.

Although only two women
will be chosen for each event,
Linzmeier's coach, George
Haines, feels she has a strong
chance of making the team.
"She has the ability to do well
in the three events, the 200, 400
and 800 (yard) freestyles, where
most (swimmers) only have one
(event)," Haines said. "She has
a great opportunity to go to
L.A."
"I think you have to consider
her to be one of the great swim
mers in U.S. women's swim
ming," he added. '
Although Linzmeier said
"that the ultimate goal for
anyone is to come home with
the gold," she also said that she
did not want to get ahead of
herself.
"My first goal is to make the
Olympic team and then go for
the gold," the Cardinal swim
mer said.
As one of the top freestyle
swimmers in the country,
Linzmeier was a member of the
1980 Olympic team which never
made it to Moscow because of
President Carter's decision to
boycott those games. She was
also a silver medalist in the 500-
yard freestyle at the Pan-
American Games last summer.
In just three years on the

Farm. Linzmeier has set school
records in the 200-yard and
500-yard freestyle events as
well as being a member of the
KOO-free relay team that holds
the school's best time. Along
the way she has racked up eight
NCAA swimming titles.
While it may have been the
sun that tirst brought Linzmeier
to a swimming pool, it was her
natural ability and competitive
ness that drove her to higher
and higher standards.
"It gets pretty hot in central
California," she said of her early
motivation to swim. "1 thought
it would he a good way to cool
off. From then on the ball just
kept on rolling and getting big
ger."
As the youngest of six
children who all swam in high
school, Linzmeier said she
"followed in the footsteps" of
her brothers and sisters. But it
soon became apparent that she
would surpass all her siblings in
the pool.
"I excelled more than they
did at it (swimming), so I
wanted to pursue it more. I've
always been tall and had long
arms, the perfect physique for a
swimmer," said the 5-foot-11
All America swimmer. "I was
naturally built for swimming."
Linzmeier was an "intense"
swimmer by the time she was
14, as well as a great natural
athlete. As a freshman at
Visalia's Mt. Whitney High
School, Linzmeier played on the
varsity volleyball team and was
an Ail-American in the pool.
"1 liked athletics," she said,
"but I had to decide on only one
thing. Since my swimming was
at such a peak, I decided to stay
with that.
"1 couldn't just compete in
central California because it
didn't have the competition. II I
wanted to improve I had to
leave the area," Linzmeier said.
The result was that Linzmeier
journeyed south to Mission
Viejo and one of the best swim
ming programs in the nation.
Mission Viejo's complex is so
good that Linzmeier had consid
ered training there for the up
coming trials. She did train
there for a week early this quar
ter, but she was drawn back to
Stanford and Haines, who is
also the coach of the Stanford
women's team and the U.S.
Olympic team.
"Everything down there was
the same, but my needs have

changed. I need more of a
quality workout, not an en
durance workout," Linzmeier
said.
"He (Haines) was another
reason that I returned. I feel ex
tremely comfortable with
George," she said.
While attending high school
in Mission Viejo, Linzmeier
lived with a host family for three
years. All the while she weath
ered the grueling workouts
that started daily at 5 a.m.
Linzmeier soon blossomed
into one of the best young swim
mers in the nation. At the age of
15 she was competing in the
senior nationals, and even in
defeat she shined.
In 1979, for example.

Linzmeier missed a world
record in the 1500-meter
freestyle while competing in Ft.
Lauderdale. She took second in
the race and shaved 24 seconds
off her previous clocking in that
event.
She garnered three more All-
American honors at Mission
Viejo. Before graduation, she
had tallied six California lnter
scholastic Federation (CIF)
Southern California titles, and
in her senior year she broke her
own CIF records for the 200-
and 500-freestyle.
Linzmeier was selected for
the U.S. Olympic B-Team in
1979 and swam against the
Canadians in Montreal. She
won the 400- and 800-yard

freestyle events there.
Linzmeier moved up to the
Olympic team in 1980, but the
boycott denied her a chance at
an Olympic medal.
"It (the boycott) was a major
disappointment, but we had to
ask the question, 'Who do we
swim for?'," she said. "We swim
for the United States and we
had to keep a positive attitude
and support our president's
decision."
As a freshman at Stanford in
1981, Linzmeier won the first
three of her eight NCAA titles.
She became a triple-threat
swimmer, winning the 200-,
500- and 1650-freestyle events
at the NCAA Championships.
That same year Linzmeier

traveled to Kiev, Russia to com
pete in a U.S.-U.S.S.R. dual
meet, where she touched first in
the 400 and 500.
Linzmeier continued with her
world traveling in 1982, as she
accompanied the World Cham
pionship Team to Guayaquil,
Ecuador. She had taken first
and second in the 200 and 400,
respectively, at the trials, but in
Guayaquil she struggled to two
dissapointing sixth-place
finishes.
"Everyone did poorly,"
Linzmeier said. "We only had
two weeks to prepare and moti
vation was a problem."
Here at Stanford, Linzmeier
led the Cardinal women to their
first NCAA championship in

March, 1983. She added to her
string of NCAA titles in that
meet by winning the 500 and
1650, but also suffered her only
loss in championship compe
tion, taking second in the 200.
Last March at the 1983-84
Championship in Indianaplois,
Linzmeier avenged that defeat,
taking the 200, 500 and 1650
for the second time in her
career. Her times of 1:45.47 in
the 200 and 4:38.91 in the 500
were both NCAA records.
Despite her demanding swim
ming schedule, the junior com
munication major plans to
graduate only one quarter late.
In addition, she has served as
student representative from
Governors Corner and the Car
dinal Club, as well as sports
broadcaster for KZ.SU radio.
"I don't think that my social
life has been missed,"
Linzmeier said. "I've tried to
get involved in as many activi
ties as I could.
"I will be ready to retire from
swimming, but I will miss it. I
feel it's made my life more en
joyable and made me more
well-rounded. I've had to miss a
couple of ski weekends that I
would like to have gone on, but
I'll make those up after the
Olymipcs."
Haines is impressed by
Linzmeier's performance both
in the pool and out.
"She is just a great human
being on top of being a great
swimmer," he said. "She always
has a smile on her face and is
willing to help somebody out.
That's what makes her great."
Linzmeiers's stiffest competi
tion at the Olympic Team Trials
will be Tiffany Chin, a friend of
Linzmeier's and a senior at her
old high school, Mission Viejo.
Chin, like Linzmeier in 1980,
is young, fast and hungry for a
chance to swim for her country
in an Olympiad.
When asked if she would like
to see both herself and Chin
make the team, Linzmeier said.
"I'd like to see myself make it
first. I'm not really thinking
about her. There are other
friends I would like to see make
the team before her."
Perhaps it is not that
Linzmeier wants to sound un
friendly, but that she knows that
what athletes remember most
about their careers is the way
they ended them.
Marybeth Linzmeier wants
her memories to be golden ones.

ness that drove her to higher
and higher standards.
"It gets pretty hot in central
California," she said of her early
motivation to swim. "1 thought
it would he a good way to cool
off. From then on the ball just
kept on rolling and getting big
ger."
As the youngest of six
children who all swam in high
school, Linzmeier said she
"followed in the footsteps" of
her brothers and sisters. But it
soon became apparent that she
would surpass all her siblings in
the pool.
"I excelled more than they
did at it (swimming), so I
wanted to pursue it more. I've
always been tall and had long
arms, the perfect physique for a
swimmer," said the 5-foot-11
All America swimmer. "I was
naturally built for swimming."
Linzmeier was an "intense"
swimmer by the time she was
14, as well as a great natural
athlete. As a freshman at
Visalia's Mt. Whitney High
School, Linzmeier played on the
varsity volleyball team and was
an Ail-American in the pool.
"1 liked athletics," she said,
"but I had to decide on only one
thing. Since my swimming was
at such a peak, I decided to stay
with that.
"1 couldn't just compete in
central California because it
didn't have the competition. II I
wanted to improve I had to
leave the area," Linzmeier said.
The result was that Linzmeier
journeyed south to Mission
Viejo and one of the best swim
ming programs in the nation.
Mission Viejo's complex is so
good that Linzmeier had consid
ered training there for the up
coming trials. She did train
there for a week early this quar
ter, but she was drawn back to
Stanford and Haines, who is
also the coach of the Stanford
women's team and the U.S.
Olympic team.
"Everything down there was
the same, but my needs have

changed. I need more of a
quality workout, not an en
durance workout," Linzmeier
said.
"He (Haines) was another
reason that I returned. I feel ex
tremely comfortable with
George," she said.
While attending high school
in Mission Viejo, Linzmeier
lived with a host family for three
years. All the while she weath
ered the grueling workouts
that started daily at 5 a.m.
Linzmeier soon blossomed
into one of the best young swim
mers in the nation. At the age of
15 she was competing in the
senior nationals, and even in
defeat she shined.
In 1979, for example.

Linzmeier missed a world
record in the 1500-meter
freestyle while competing in Ft.
Lauderdale. She took second in
the race and shaved 24 seconds
off her previous clocking in that
event.
She garnered three more All-
American honors at Mission
Viejo. Before graduation, she
had tallied six California lnter
scholastic Federation (CIF)
Southern California titles, and
in her senior year she broke her
own CIF records for the 200-
and 500-freestyle.
Linzmeier was selected for
the U.S. Olympic B-Team in
1979 and swam against the
Canadians in Montreal. She
won the 400- and 800-yard

freestyle events there.
Linzmeier moved up to the
Olympic team in 1980, but the
boycott denied her a chance at
an Olympic medal.
"It (the boycott) was a major
disappointment, but we had to
ask the question, 'Who do we
swim for?'," she said. "We swim
for the United States and we
had to keep a positive attitude
and support our president's
decision."
As a freshman at Stanford in
1981, Linzmeier won the first
three of her eight NCAA titles.
She became a triple-threat
swimmer, winning the 200-,
500- and 1650-freestyle events
at the NCAA Championships.
That same year Linzmeier

traveled to Kiev, Russia to com
pete in a U.S.-U.S.S.R. dual
meet, where she touched first in
the 400 and 500.
Linzmeier continued with her
world traveling in 1982, as she
accompanied the World Cham
pionship Team to Guayaquil,
Ecuador. She had taken first
and second in the 200 and 400,
respectively, at the trials, but in
Guayaquil she struggled to two
dissapointing sixth-place
finishes.
"Everyone did poorly,"
Linzmeier said. "We only had
two weeks to prepare and moti
vation was a problem."
Here at Stanford, Linzmeier
led the Cardinal women to their
first NCAA championship in

March, 1983. She added to her
string of NCAA titles in that
meet by winning the 500 and
1650, but also suffered her only
loss in championship compe
tion, taking second in the 200.
Last March at the 1983-84
Championship in Indianaplois,
Linzmeier avenged that defeat,
taking the 200, 500 and 1650
for the second time in her
career. Her times of 1:45.47 in
the 200 and 4:38.91 in the 500
were both NCAA records.
Despite her demanding swim
ming schedule, the junior com
munication major plans to
graduate only one quarter late.
In addition, she has served as
student representative from
Governors Corner and the Car
dinal Club, as well as sports
broadcaster for KZ.SU radio.
"I don't think that my social
life has been missed,"
Linzmeier said. "I've tried to
get involved in as many activi
ties as I could.
"I will be ready to retire from
swimming, but I will miss it. I
feel it's made my life more en
joyable and made me more
well-rounded. I've had to miss a
couple of ski weekends that I
would like to have gone on, but
I'll make those up after the
Olymipcs."
Haines is impressed by
Linzmeier's performance both
in the pool and out.
"She is just a great human
being on top of being a great
swimmer," he said. "She always
has a smile on her face and is
willing to help somebody out.
That's what makes her great."
Linzmeiers's stiffest competi
tion at the Olympic Team Trials
will be Tiffany Chin, a friend of
Linzmeier's and a senior at her
old high school, Mission Viejo.
Chin, like Linzmeier in 1980,
is young, fast and hungry for a
chance to swim for her country
in an Olympiad.
When asked if she would like
to see both herself and Chin
make the team, Linzmeier said.
"I'd like to see myself make it
first. I'm not really thinking
about her. There are other
friends I would like to see make
the team before her."
Perhaps it is not that
Linzmeier wants to sound un
friendly, but that she knows that
what athletes remember most
about their careers is the way
they ended them.
Marybeth Linzmeier wants
her memories to be golden ones.

Junior Marybeth Linzmeier hopes this stroke will be good enough to win a medal in the Olympic Games this summer.
Marybeth Linzmeier started
her swimming career as a 9-
year-old trying to heat the heat
in Visalia, California, and now
she may be on the verge of en
ding it with an Olympic gold
medal this summer in Los An
geles.
In what should be the Car
dinal co-captain's second-to-last
year of competition, Linzmeier
has stopped out of school this
quarter to train for the U.S.
Olympic Team Trials in In
dianapolis starting June 25.

Although only two women
will be chosen for each event,
Linzmeier's coach, George
Haines, feels she has a strong
chance of making the team.
"She has the ability to do well
in the three events, the 200, 400
and 800 (yard) freestyles, where
most (swimmers) only have one
(event)," Haines said. "She has
a great opportunity to go to
L.A."
"I think you have to consider
her to be one of the great swim
mers in U.S. women's swim
ming," he added. '
Although Linzmeier said
"that the ultimate goal for
anyone is to come home with
the gold," she also said that she
did not want to get ahead of
herself.
"My first goal is to make the
Olympic team and then go for
the gold," the Cardinal swim
mer said.
As one of the top freestyle
swimmers in the country,
Linzmeier was a member of the
1980 Olympic team which never
made it to Moscow because of
President Carter's decision to
boycott those games. She was
also a silver medalist in the 500-
yard freestyle at the Pan-
American Games last summer.
In just three years on the

Farm. Linzmeier has set school
records in the 200-yard and
500-yard freestyle events as
well as being a member of the
KOO-free relay team that holds
the school's best time. Along
the way she has racked up eight
NCAA swimming titles.

lived with a host family for three
years. All the while she weath
ered the grueling workouts
that started daily at 5 a.m.
Linzmeier soon blossomed
into one of the best young swim
mers in the nation. At the age of
15 she was competing in the
senior nationals, and even in
defeat she shined.
In 1979, for example.

Linzmeier missed a world
record in the 1500-meter
freestyle while competing in Ft.
Lauderdale. She took second in
the race and shaved 24 seconds
off her previous clocking in that
event.
She garnered three more All-
American honors at Mission
Viejo. Before graduation, she
had tallied six California lnter
scholastic Federation (CIF)
Southern California titles, and
in her senior year she broke her
own CIF records for the 200-
and 500-freestyle.
Linzmeier was selected for
the U.S. Olympic B-Team in
1979 and swam against the
Canadians in Montreal. She
won the 400- and 800-yard

freestyle events there.
Linzmeier moved up to the
Olympic team in 1980, but the
boycott denied her a chance at
an Olympic medal.
"It (the boycott) was a major
disappointment, but we had to
ask the question, 'Who do we
swim for?'," she said. "We swim
for the United States and we
had to keep a positive attitude
and support our president's
decision."
As a freshman at Stanford in
1981, Linzmeier won the first
three of her eight NCAA titles.
She became a triple-threat
swimmer, winning the 200-,
500- and 1650-freestyle events
at the NCAA Championships.
That same year Linzmeier

traveled to Kiev, Russia to com
pete in a U.S.-U.S.S.R. dual
meet, where she touched first in
the 400 and 500.
Linzmeier continued with her
world traveling in 1982, as she
accompanied the World Cham
pionship Team to Guayaquil,
Ecuador. She had taken first
and second in the 200 and 400,
respectively, at the trials, but in
Guayaquil she struggled to two
dissapointing sixth-place
finishes.
"Everyone did poorly,"
Linzmeier said. "We only had
two weeks to prepare and moti
vation was a problem."
Here at Stanford, Linzmeier
led the Cardinal women to their
first NCAA championship in

March, 1983. She added to her
string of NCAA titles in that
meet by winning the 500 and
1650, but also suffered her only
loss in championship compe
tion, taking second in the 200.
Last March at the 1983-84
Championship in Indianaplois,
Linzmeier avenged that defeat,
taking the 200, 500 and 1650
for the second time in her
career. Her times of 1:45.47 in
the 200 and 4:38.91 in the 500
were both NCAA records.
Despite her demanding swim
ming schedule, the junior com
munication major plans to
graduate only one quarter late.
In addition, she has served as
student representative from
Governors Corner and the Car
dinal Club, as well as sports
broadcaster for KZ.SU radio.
"I don't think that my social
life has been missed,"
Linzmeier said. "I've tried to
get involved in as many activi
ties as I could.
"I will be ready to retire from
swimming, but I will miss it. I
feel it's made my life more en
joyable and made me more
well-rounded. I've had to miss a
couple of ski weekends that I
would like to have gone on, but
I'll make those up after the
Olymipcs."
Haines is impressed by
Linzmeier's performance both
in the pool and out.
"She is just a great human
being on top of being a great
swimmer," he said. "She always
has a smile on her face and is
willing to help somebody out.
That's what makes her great."
Linzmeiers's stiffest competi
tion at the Olympic Team Trials
will be Tiffany Chin, a friend of
Linzmeier's and a senior at her
old high school, Mission Viejo.
Chin, like Linzmeier in 1980,
is young, fast and hungry for a
chance to swim for her country
in an Olympiad.
When asked if she would like
to see both herself and Chin
make the team, Linzmeier said.
"I'd like to see myself make it
first. I'm not really thinking
about her. There are other
friends I would like to see make
the team before her."
Perhaps it is not that
Linzmeier wants to sound un
friendly, but that she knows that
what athletes remember most
about their careers is the way
they ended them.
Marybeth Linzmeier wants
her memories to be golden ones.
