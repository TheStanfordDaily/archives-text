The Clean Slate cleaned up the race for senior class
president in yesterday's ASSU election run-off, tallving
300 votes to slate #0181's 215. Seven write-in ballots were

cast for the Right Slate.
"It was a decisive victory," said ASSU elections com
missioner Phil Halperin. Halperin said the outstanding
votes from Stanford's Tours and Vienna campuses would
not change the outcome of the electiw

"They're irrelevant. At the most they have 60 votes,"
Halperin said. The Clean Slate, composed of Shaun
Avant, Jim Duffey, Kathy Ko and Joyce Weatherford,
won by 85 votes.
Yesterday's voting was a run-off between the Clean
Slate and slate #0181. which is composed of John Even,
Rick Hoskins, Jennifer Torbett and Lisa Tseng. The two
slates survived a primary vote last week among the original
field of 11 slates.
"We're glad its over," said Halperin. A run-off election
has been necessary every three to four years in the past,
whenever a slate does not garner more than 50 percent of
the vote on the first ballot, he said.
Halperin was surprised at yesterday's voter turnout.
"Over one-third of (next year's) senior class voted, which
is amazing for a run-off election." he said.
During the campaign, the Clean Slate stressed the need
to maintairl contacts with professors, fellow students and
