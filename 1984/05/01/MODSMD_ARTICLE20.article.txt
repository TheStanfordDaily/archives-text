## Through the Wilderness' a unified, revealing piece 
### MARC FAJER 
The traditional vision ot the
American frontier is over
whelmingly masculine. John
Wayne. Garv Cooper. Paul
Bunyan and a host of other leg
endary men settled the West ac
cording to popular mythology
with little assistance of women.
"Through the Wilderness to the
Stars." compiled by Theater-
Works Artistic Director Robert
kelley from the diaries, letters,
and memoirs of America's
female pioneers, displays an
other side to the story of the
West. A cast of 1 1 talented
actresses vividly recreate the ex
perience of the women who
went to the frontier, and the
production gives a new perspec
ti\e to the old myths for those
who are unaware of the female
contributions to this large por
tion of American history .
Kelley, who conceived and di
rected the production, has done
a fine job on all counts. Theatri
cal pieces that are made up of
fragments tend to feel disjointed
and awkward, yet "Through the
Wilderness" retains the smooth
quality of a unified piece
throughout. The show glides

from the decisions to move west
through the perils ot the journey
and on to the problems of build
ing first homes, and then com
munities, The direction accen
tuated the flow of the piece and
there was a real impression of
fluidity that was very appealing,
though hampered slightly by the
lighting.
While the acting was gener
ally pretty good, there were a
few performances that stood
out. Each woman played a vari
ety of roles over the course of
the evening, though they tended
to get segments that conformed
to their type. Jennifer Adams
was very funny as a society wo
man engaged to a soldier who
had to undergo the indignities of
life at a frontier post. Anne
Houlc. who enjoys a special
ability to convey life and joy on
stage, was good at recreating a
town dance scene and one in
which she hid with her
boyfriend. Kay Martin con
veyed a different quality al
together. She often was used to
bring across the despair of the
women lacing the barrenness of
the frontier existence and the
proximity of death. The pain

that she showed counting the
graves by the roadside as they
traveled, realizing the little
bleak house would be her home
and being unable to provide a
proper Christmas, was touching
and convincing.
Ev Shiro had a series of nice
moments portraying Chinese
women brought to America and
the unique problems they faced.
Jennifer Barroga portrayed an
Indian woman who watched her
tribal ways disappear over the
course of her life. Jodi Bab
bington was charming, as al
ways. as a young woman who
goes through the trial of choos
ing a husband, and then of
learning to be a housewife. The
sequence in which she attempts
to do the laundry was both
funny and very revealing; you
got a real sense of how back
breaking a job maintaining a
family in the wilderness must
have been.
In all, "Through the Wilder
ness to the Stars" is a revealing
and interesting production. It
will be performed Thursday
through Saturday at the Burgess
Theater in Menlo Park, and is
well worth seeing.
