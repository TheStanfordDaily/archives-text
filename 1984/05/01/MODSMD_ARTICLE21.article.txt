# 'Still Life': complex mosaic of violence moves too quickly
## 
### JOHN WILKINS 
1 inily Mann's documentary drama,
"Still Life," reveals a landscape of un
bridled pain and cruelty. Unlike many
plays which deal with the subject of
violence, the violence in "Still Life"
does not sensationally explode to the
surface of the play; it is the surface of
the play. The play is a complex mosaic
of changing attitudes, forms and
feelings about a world seemingly
composed entirely of violence.
The drama of "Still Life" rests in
the character-subjects' attempts to
reconcile themselves to this world. I
use the word character-subject be
cause Mann did not create the people
or the language of this play. In Mann's
own words, "The play is a documen
tary because it is a distillation'of the
interviews I conducted during that
(1978) summer." The people and
events are real: Mark, a Vietnam vet
eran, Cheryl, his wife and Nadine, his
mistress. The juxtaposition of their
monologues is Mann's. "Still Life" is
nothing more than the chronicling of
three interrelated histories. Each
character-subject tells his/her story di
rectly to the audience; they are not
only part of the violent mosaic of "Still
Life" but the creators of it as well.
This ambivalence between an indi
vidual's suffering in the world and an
individual's complicity in making that

world is central to the concerns of
"Still Life." The title of the play
reflects this problem. A still life, a
photograph, has no history. It is the
revealing of one moment in time, and

The nature of the play demands that
the words of these people be savored,
hung on to, as if a hidden gunman will
assassinate them for a faulty delivery.

cannot capture the past or the future
of that moment. It stays, by its nature,
a testimony of rigidity and stagnation,
a virtual monument to the inability to
change. "Still Life," however,
connotes change, the ability to accept
life, to go on. It is the opposite of
stagnation and rigidity; it holds out the
hope to go on living no matter what
the moment of the still life, the photo
graph, suggests. It is the one hope the
character-subjects have of escaping
the world they have created. This is
both the tragedy and the hope of "Still
Life."
Wendy Turton's production of "Still
Lite," which played at The Nitery this

weekend, missed much of the tension
and ambivalence of the play, but did
manage to capture some of the drama.
Because the character-subjects tell
their stories directly to the audience.

the pace of the play is crucial. The au
dience, in a sense, witnesses the crea
tion of history. The pace of this pro
duction was much too fast. At times, it
raced by lines, pauses and breaks in
the character's thoughts, like there
was some drastic need to finish the
play at a specific time. The nature of
the play demands that the words of
these people be savored, hung on to,
as if a hidden gunman will assassinate
them for a faulty delivery. "Still Life"
is not the words of a playwright fil
tered through a troupe of characters,
but the words of the characters filtered
through a playwright. These words
mean a lot to these people; they need

time to speak them.
The relationship between the char
acters on stage is both simple and in
tricate. Simple, because they represent
(he classic husband, wife and mistress
triangle. Intricate, because dramati
cally the affair launches the character
subjects into exploring their own lives.
This exploration centers around the
violence that the character Mark has
brought back with him from the war,
and how it affects his wife and
mistress. In almost every way, from his
place at center stage to the concerns of
the other characters, Mark represents
the focal point of "Still Life." Leigh
Sealy, as Mark, was unable to hold the
type of intensity and power th:it th<
play demands. In no way did Sealy s
portrayal convey the history that Mark
is creating. It was an unaffected per
formance, entirely inappropriate to
the play. Mark carries an inexplicable
war within himself; it is the tension be
tween the identity of the war and his
own identity that makes Mark and
part of the play like a bomb waiting to
explode. This explosive element was
missing in this production.
Johanna Dickey played Cheryl, a
simplistic twit who becomes angry by
the end of the play; it was a tremen
dous misreading of the part. Cheryl is
the most analytical of the three char
acters on stage; her lack of pretension

is not a sign of idiocy, but a sign of
honesty. Her awareness of the world
around her is compounded by both
her small son, Danny, and her preg
nancy. She is aware that her actions
are not self-serving, and that they
have serious repercussions on the
people around her. Also, the idea of
having a character change emotionally
from the beginning to the end of the
show is structurally suspect. The play's
structure is one of stillness, not
progression. These arc "still lives,"
and within the structure of the play

they should not change much from
one moment to the other. Instead of
change, the actor and actresses should
strive toward re-creation, portraying
exactly the same character from
beginning to end without the idea of
development. A still life's history does
not progress, but stays the same,

waiting to be examined by whomever
should come along.
Nancy Beagle's portrayal of Nadine
accomplished everything an actor
actress should do within the confines
of the play and more. She successfully
created a stagnant character, one who
did not progress, but yet had a great
amount of depth. Beagle let the audi
ence move into one moment in the life
of Nadine. Beagle s Nadine did not
develop, but waited like a photograph
for herself and the audience to dissect
the character. It was a superior perfor-

mance and much in the spirit of the
play.
"Still Life" offers no answers to the
problems afflicting these people and
the society around them, but it does
offer a beautifully detailed portrait of
three disturbed lives clutching for jus
tification to go on living, to "still" live.
