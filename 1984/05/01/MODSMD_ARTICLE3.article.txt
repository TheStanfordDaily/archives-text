# Bank to be reduced
## 
### TROY EID Daily staff 
Wells Fargo Bank has pushed plans
for the renovation of Tresidder Union
"three years ahead of schedule" by
tentatively agreeing yesterday to
reduce the size of its campus office,
according to Tresidder Union Direc
tor Ellie Oppenheim.
Faced with an option to renew its
lease, Wells Fargo opted to
"downsize" the Tresidder branch,
which "fit perfectly" with the long
range union revamping plans
developed two years ago, Oppenheim
said.
But she said the renovations will be
limited to size and not scope. "We
plan to reduce the space hut keep the
services," she said.
Pat McGuire, Wells Fargo senior
vice president, concurred, saying the
tentative arrangement is likely to be
finalized "within a couple of weeks."
"The agreement we've come up
with will certainly be good for the
community, and I think we're pleased
with it,"he said. "We have a couple of
things to be ironed out. They're just
very minor things. 1 think we're basi
cally there."
The bank changes are part of an
overall scheme to renovate Tresidder.
The plan, which was announced last
year, includes expanding the Coffee
House and The Store, removing the
bowling alley and revamping the
union's lobby.
Oppenheim said the scaling down of
Wells Fargo was made possible by
electronic innovation, which has
played a key role in transforming
banking in recent years.
"Unlike 12 years ago when the
bank lease was first written, automatic
tellers have changed the nature of the
transactions taking place on campus,"
Oppenheim said. "Nobody expected
the changes in the banking industry
that have taken place" over the course
of the lease.
McGuire agreed, adding that a
deregulated banking industry also af
fected the decision.

The bank downsizing will probably
make room lor three additional union
meeting rooms and a specialty
lounge" tor reading or watching telc
vision. Oppenheim said.
Oppenheim said the Tresidder
renovation project will continue to un
ravel in the coming weeks, with the
union looking substantially dilterent
"when the dust stops flying.
