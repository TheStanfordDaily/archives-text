# South Korean ambassador to U.N
## Official backs industrialization 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
The solution to the economic, social
and military problems of South Korea
will come from increased in
dustrialization and an expanding eco
nomy, Kyung Won Kim, South
Korean ambassador to the United Na
tions, said yesterday at a speech in
Branner lounge.
All these issues are "intertwined
and they cannot really be separated,"
the South Korean official said.
Kim, who holds a doctorate from
Harvard in political science, said the
South Korean economy is already
making rapid economic progress,
while North Korea, which has more
resources, has lagged.
"South Korea has forged ahead. It's
a vibrant, dynamic economy," Kirn
said. "It (the North Korean economy)
is stagnant. It's regimented. It's con
trolled from the top and it's not going
anywhere."
The fact that South Korea's per
capita gross national product (GNP)
has risen from less than $60 in I 956 to
nearly $2000 dollars today is evidence
of the country's expansion, Kim said.
"We have literally risen from
ashes," he said. "When I came as an
undergraduate to this country, I surely
was doubtful that we (the South
Koreans) could even put together a
decent bicycle.
"We were short of everything. We
were totally dependant on the U.S.
military and economic assistance to
meet our budgetary requirements, to
feed ourselves, to clothe ourselves and
to just survive from one winter to an
other."
While growing up in Korea, Kim
said he wondered how to "liberate our
people from this hunger, disease, fear
of sudden death and mentally degrad

ing menial labor. The magic word was
industrialization. I still believe it is in
dustrialization."
Kim said the communist economy
of North Korea has given it an advan
tage in military armament over the
South Koreans, but peace has been
preserved on the Korean peninsula bv
U.S. military presence and by the
South Koreans' own military efforts.
"We are still militarily inferior to
the North Koreans despite the fact
that we have twice the population and

'We have literally risen
from ashes. . . . The
magic word was in
dustrialization. I still
believe it is in
dus tria liza tion. '*

five times the GNP of North Korea,"
he said. "The reason is that we all
ocate about 6 percent of our GNP for
our defense, whereas the North
Koreans use more than 20 percent."
The North Koreans' military advan
tage would be negated in the future by
the more dynamic South Korean eco
nomy, the ambassador said.
"In five to ten years we will prob
ably catch up with and pass by the
North Koreans, even in the military
field, as our own GNP keeps growing
and the North Koreans' GNP does
not," Kim said.

Kim said there are many barriers
that must he overcome before North
and South Korea can reunite.
Last October's assasination attempt
in Rangoon, Burma on South Korean
President Chun Doo Hwan is, Kim
said, one act that the South Koreans
cannot overlook.
"Three North Korean armed agents
placed and detonated a bomb killing
17 of our senior officials, including
many of my closest friends who were
on a goodwill mission with my presi-

dent," Kim said.
However, Kim said the South
Korean people still believe they will
one day be united with North Korea,
but the process will be ;i long integra
ted one.
"We simply believe in our guts that
we are going to be unified because we
are a homogenous nation. This is our
strength and our weakness," Kim said.
"We speak the same language. We are
ethnically homogenous, racially
homogenous. We have existed as one

political entity for many centuries
Kim graduated magna cum laude
from Williams College in Massachu
setts in 1959. and he received his doc
torate from Harvard in 1963. A pro
fessor initially. Kim was a teaching fel
low at Harvard before he went on to
teach at York University in Toronto.
Kim has also taught political science at
New York University and Korea Uni
\ersity.
In 1975. Kim began his career as a
public servant in Korea. He was first
appointed as a special assistant in the
area ol international affairs, and in
1980 he was made the secretary gen
eral to the president of South Korea.
In 1981 he was officially appointed to
his current post.
Kim flew here from Seattle where
he was on business. He will speak
today at the U.S. Korean Chamber of
Commerce in San Francisco.
