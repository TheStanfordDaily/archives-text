# Track coach discusses Olympic politics
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Stanford Track Coach Brooks Johnson, speak
ing in C'ardenal Lounge yesterday, said the history
ot the Olympic Games is consistent with the
"normal, natural phenomenon of athletics reflect
ing what's going on in society.
"Things haven't changed," he said. "It was
never a case of one man winning." He called the
Olympics a "substitute for war," saving that the
original events were all war games.
Johnson, who will coach the United States wo
men's track team in the Olympics this sum
mer. told a small audience that media hype has
caused "massive misconceptions and myths."
He called the U.S. Olympic boycott "the
most consistent thing we could've done" giv en the

world situation at the time. In the original Games,
countries at war did not compete.
Addressing the possible Soviet boycott of the
19N4 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Johnson
said. "The Russians arc between a rock and a hard
place.
"If they go (to Los Angeles), the East Germans
are gonna whip their ass," he said. "And if they
stay home, (Soviet BJoc) countries will go
anyway."
"And what will that do?" he asked. "Embarrass
the leader of the Soviet Bloc.
Johnson used coffee cups to represent the na
tions as he captivated his audience with a presenta
tion ot the Soviet dilemma.
Johnson\ candid statements ot Ins sports philos
opln spurred a discussion in which he deemed

world-class athletes "psychotic" and downplayed
his own nomination as an Olympic coach, which he
attributed to "political savvy" rather than merit.
"I've never had a great athlete who didn't have a
screw loose," he said. "I've never had a great ath
lete who was dumb either," he added. Johnson
said Olympic training requires an effort that goes
far bey ond the norm.
"It you go beyond the norm, you're abnormal. If
\ou go much beyond it. you're neurotic. These
(Olympic-caliber) athletes are psychotic. ... Is
pulling a bow back 1000 times a normal thing to
do?"
Johnson cited large salaries and monetary
rewards as the motivation behind the great amount
of time and effort athletes spend train
ing tor various forms of competition.
"If (U.S. sprinter) Carl Lewis wins
four golds (in Los Angeles), that's
worth $1 million he said.
Johnson said athletes are often
motivated to compete because they
are repressed in their society. He said
their excessive training and concentra
tion on winning athletic events is an
overcompensation to curb their own
feelings of inadequacy. "If you didn't
feel inadequate, you wouldn't over
compensate," he said.
The title "women's Olympic track
coach" is a misnomer, Johnson said.
"Nty ji i> is to subordinate my consi
derable ego" to the athletes' personal
trainers.
Johnson sees himself as a "caddie"
whose advice is crucial only to athletes
he has already trained. "If you haven't
coached most of them, you don't know

the buzzwords, what makes them go.
The best thing >011 can do is not to
mess with them.'' he said.
As a world-class sprinter. Johnson
set the National collegiate indoor
record in the 60-yard dash while at
1 utts University and broke the world
record tor that event in 1960. Al
though he cited his reason tor racing
as "wanting to whip people's asses."
he said his coaching st\le emphasizes
"success rather than winning.
"I want my athletes to maximize
their ability." he said.
Johnson's digressions on civil rights
reflect his belief that Americans con
tinue to discriminate. "Since blacks
think they got it made, they aren't
doing all the things they used to do.
and we'll go right back to where we
were at in 1940." he said.
He said Americans are guilty of a
"convenient memory" and thus
quickly forget blacks and their ac
complishments in the United States.
