I rom the Los Angeles Times
Washington — In the aftermath of the
Libyan Embassy shouting in London, the
I nited States called upon other nations
yesterday to join in "meaningful opposi
tion" to the policies of Libyan strongman
Moammar Khadafy, who it savs supports
international terrorism and subversion.
Reagan administration officials ex
pressed hope that the fatal shooting of a
policewoman and the wounding of 11
Libyan demonstrators outside the Lon
don embassy last month would spur
European allies and other nations into
individual or joint economic and political
action.
Sd far, the United States, which in
1 ys 1 expelled Libyan diplomats and
subsequently embargoed Libyan oil im
ports, has stood largely alone in its sanc
tions against Khadafy's Islamic revolu
tionary regime. In its efforts to persuade
nations such as Britain. France and Italy
to take similar steps, it has been
frustrated by their greater dependence
on Libyan oil and their considerable eco
nomic ties to the North African state.
But now, backed by a tough new anti
terrorist policy endorsed bv President
Reagan, the administration is looking for
rising public anger in Europe to force
governments there to impose at least
economic sanctions against I ibya. This
would show the Khadafy regime that it
"can't act with impunity," according to
one U.S. official.
The possibility of some covert action
against the mercurial Libyan leader can
not be ruled out, another official ac

knowledged. But he added that despite
growing wrath in France ;ind West Ger
many. as well as that already in Britain,
there seemed little real prospect that a
joint operation could be mounted to
punish or topple Khadafy.
Similarly, he said, there appears to be
less chance ol concerted multinational
political and economic sanctions against
Khadafy than of punitive moves by indi
vidual states.
At the State Department, spokesman
Alan Romberg indicated that the United
States would approach the other govern
ments following a review now under way
in Washington on possible anti-Libyan
actions. Results of the rev iew reportedly

will be discussed with Reagan and his
key aides after their return from China
tomorrow.
A prepared statement read yesterday
by Romberg cited numerous recent
Libyan offenses, including bombings in
the Sudan, the occupation of northern
Chad and other unspecified "terrorist
acts." as well as the London shooting.
"The death of a London policewoman
who was shot from within the former
Libyan mission is another tragic
reminder that Khadafy has not chosen to
alter his unacceptable behavior." Rom
berg said. "The security implications of
Libya's actions remain a matter of con
cern for the United States and. we

believe, for all European and other na
tions. ...
He continued. "We hope that other
nations . . . will arrive at the same con
clusions we have reached regarding the
need to demonstrate to Khadafy
meaningful opposition to his policies,
particularly Libya's state-supported ter
rorism and subversion of its neighbors."
The 1981 U.S. sanctions, which also
included the imposition of the tightest
U.S. controls ever on exports to I ibya,
were implemented following intelligence
reports that a five-man Libyan "hit
squad" was being prepared to assassinate
Reagan.
