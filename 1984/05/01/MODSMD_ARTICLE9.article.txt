London (AP) — Col.
Moammar Khadafy of Libya
will keep hunting down his
opponents abroad, despite
the diplomatic uproar follow
ing the killing of a British
policewoman by a gunman in
the Libyan Embassy, ter
rorism experts say.
They fear there will be little
international action to smash
what one authority called
"nests of terrorists disguised
as diplomats."
However, they believe
European governments will
toughen diplomatic rules to

curb fanatical students — the
cutting edge of Khadafy's ter
ror campaign — who use
Libyan embassies as bases.
"He'll go easy for a while."
retired Maj. Gen. Richard
Cluueibuck told The Associ
ated Press yesterday. "But he
won't abandon his campaign
against his opponents because
he really doesn't mind how
many people he kills. He's
very unscrupulous ."
Paul Wilkinson, professor
of international relations at
Aberdeen University, said by
phone: "He'll probably now

change tactics, possibly focus
ing on dissidents in North
Africa and the Middle East
rather than Europe. His
people have been very active
in that region lately."
The Times of London has
quoted Libyan sources in
Britain as saying Khadafy or
dered his hit squads to lie low
after the 1 1-day siege of the
Libyan Embassy and Britain's
decision to break diplomatic
ties.

campaign.

threatened to »;ike action
against Britain for
