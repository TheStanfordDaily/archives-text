# Student survey to evaluate present status of Honor Code
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer First of a two-part series 
In an effort to evaluate student
attitudes and experiences regarding
the Honor Code, the Honor Code
Commission (HCC), the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) and the Committee of 15
mailed a survey to both undergrad
uate and graduate students last
week.
The three groups are all involved
in updating the present Honor
Code. "We all realized that we
didn't understand as much as we
should about the Honor Code,"
said Arthur Keller, a member of
the HCC.
A 19N0 survey "found some in
teresting things, but we're researching
more thoroughly this time," Keller
said. One concern that students ex
pressed in the 19K0 survey was that
an inadequate supply of resources
led students to cheat.
Students also said that some
teaching practices provided undue
temptation. "We went into that
more thoroughly this time." Keller
explained.
The survey also evaluates stu
dent knowledge about the Honor
Code in general, the issue ot proc
toring and the system ot penalty
grading.

The survey results will be used
by the HCC, an advisory educa
tional and research committee, to
prepare a report for the SCLC and
the Committee of 15.
The SCLC is made up of elected
student representatives and ap
pointed faculty and staff members.
It is responsible for defining mis
conduct and penalties. The Com
mittee of 15 defines the judicial
process and jurisdiction.
The HCC is also concerned with
using the results of the survey to
educate the Stanford community
about the Honor Code. "We will
be talking at next year's orientation
about how new students can be in
formed about the Honor Code,"
Keiler said.
Michele Fisher, director of the
Center of Teaching and Learning,
who is responsible for teaching as
sistant and faculty orientation at
the beginning of fall quarter, will
also use the material.
This is only one of the many in
stances of revision and updating
that the Honor Code has un
dergone. It was first written by Law
School students who "were inter
ested in controlling their own
honesty," Keller said.
"It is important that students
realize that the Honor Code is
there because students wanted it,"
he said.

But students today obviously
want something different than their
predecessors. The first Honor
Code proposed in 1914 stated that,
"In case of any cheating being de
tected. the students themselves are
not to be expected to report the
case to the professor or the student
council, but are to go to the of
fender and inform him that such
practices are not in accord with the
spirit of Stanford, and will not be
countenanced in the future."
Since that time, however, the
Honor Code has changed and stu
dents are now given full respon
siblity for taking "an active part in
seeing that others as well as them
selves" uphold the code. That re
sponsibility now includes reporting
the offense to the professor or
proper authorities.
Earlier versions of the Honor
Code have further changed by
leaving non-academic concerns in
the hands of the students.
However, in 1959 that was not this
case. The Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard handbook for that
year contains this entry under the
heading: Student Affairs and Dan
cing. "Good judgment and proper
respect for morality and order
should be the spirit in which stu
dent dances and social affairs are
planned, presented, and con
ducted."
