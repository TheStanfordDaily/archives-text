Mart falters in South
Nashville, lenn. — Former
Vice President Walter Mondale
last night won the important
I ennessee Democratic
presidential primary where Sen.
Clary Hart had hoped to re
charge his faltering campaign.
At the same time, Jesse Jack
son scored the first outright vic
tory of his resilient challenge for
the party's presidential nomina
tion, defeating Mondale and
Hart in the District of Colum
bia.
Jackson, again turning out a
large black vote, was locked in a
tight battle with Hart for second
place in Tennessee.
The Tennessee vote, with 75

percent of the precints report
ing, was Mondale, 97,347 or 41
percent; Hart, 71,724 or 30 per
cent; and Jackson, 58,757 or 25
percent.
But in the District of Colum
bia, where Mondale and Hart
had scarcely campaigned and
where Jackson's victory was
conceded, the Chicago civil
rights leader piled up 64 percent
of the "morning vote" to 30
percent for Mondale and 7 per
cent for Hart.
The "morning vote" in ballot
boxes collected at about noon
represented about 40,000
voters.
The two primaries, with 80
national convention delegates
combined, are the first in a se
ries of contests in the next seven
days to select 717 delegates and
to test Hart's vow of a come
back.

The results were not good
news for Hart, whose campaign
manager, Oliver Henkel, said
that the Colorado senator must
provide convincing evidence
over the next week that he can
mount a second-half comeback
in the race with Mondale.
After a startling string of vic
tories early in the year. Hart has
not won a primary election since
Connecticut March 27.
Mondale defeated him in Illi
nois, New York and Pennsylva
nia in less than a month to re
establish himself as the clear
front-runner for the nomina
tion.
Tennessee, a primary long
overlooked by campaign
strategists, became the focus of

attention in recent weeks.
Both Hart and Mondale con
cluded that the outcome in Ten
nessee could have an effect far
beyond the 65 delegates at stake
because Texas and Ohio follow
so closely on its heels.
It was the second time in the
fight for delegates when the
South appealed pivotal.
After being stunned by Hart
in New England, Mondale held
on to win in Georgia and Alabama
and revive a candidacy that
seemed on the brink of defeat.
Hart looked to Tennessee to
do the same for his campaign,
but voters here followed their
tradition of turning out in small
numbers, damaging Hart's
chances to deal Mondale a
major defeat.
Though most of the attention
during the climactic days of the
campaign centered on

Mondale's under-pressure
refund of political action com
mittees' contributions to his del
egate committees, Hart had
heavily staked his hopes in Ten
nessee on the rural vote.
But early indications were
that the only heavy votes came
in predominantly black
precincts where Jackson had
ignited the only real excitement
of the campaign.
Mondale will outspend rivals
Washington — Despite
Mondale's decision to pay back
about $350,000 raised by his
controversial delegate
candidate committees, he will
be able to outspend his rivals in
the closing weeks of the cam
paign, according to officials.
Mondale has been taking in
about $300,000 a week, finance
director Tim Finchem said yes
terday. That healthy cash flow,
combined with federal matching
grants, will enable the campaign
to spend from $2.5 million to $3
million from the start of this
month through the major pri
maries on June 5, which include
California and New Jersey, he
said.
Conversely, fund-raising for
Hart has taken a nose dive since
his defeat March 20 in the Illi
nois primary.
Henkel, Hart's campaign
manager, said contributions
have dropped from over
$100,000 a day, or $700,000 to
$850,000 a week, to under
$40,000 a day.
Jackson has been running a
shoestring campaign, spending
no money on television adver
tising. By the end of March, he
had spent $2.1 million,
compared with $7.1 million by
Hart and $13.3 million by
Mondale.
In early March, Mondale not
only was reeling from losses to
Hart in New England but was

facing the prospect of being out
spent by Hart during the rest of
the campaign. Mondale spent
huge sums in 1983 and in the
first two months of 1984, while
Hart had spent next to nothing
during that period. With a $20.2
million federal spending limit,
Hart had more than enough
running room, and donations
were pouring in. But Mondale
was in danger of bumping into
the federal limit in the final
weeks of the campaign.
In addition, Mondale last
week renounced the use of
"delegate committees" that had
spent money on his behalf with
out it counting against his
federal spending limit. He
promised to pay back all politi
cal action committee (PAC)
donations made to the commit
tees and all individual contribu
tions exceeding $1000 — at a
cost of $250,000 to $350,000 to

his campaign.
He also agreed to count
against his spending limit the
$450,000 to $500,000 these
committees spent. The decision
increased the danger that
Mondale would be massively
outspent in the closing weeks of
the campaign.
But the sharp decline in the
volume of contributions to Hart
has ended that danger, at least
for the moment.
Finchem said that as of the
end of April, the Mondale cam
paign had spent about $15 mil
lion against the $20.2 million
federal cap. When the money
spent by delegate committees is
added to the total, Mondale will
have about $4.6 million left to
carry the campaign through the
convention in July.
"We can get by on what we
have at least to June 5 (the final
major primary day) even if we

have to have an all-volunteer
convention operation,"
Finchem said.
Hart seems to be in no danger
of hitting the federal spending
limit since he remains about $ 10
million under it.
And Henkel said Hart's
reduced cash flow means
Mondale probably will outspend
him through June 5.
Reagan renounces Klan
Washington — President
Reagan, with the issue of the Ku
Klux Klan's endorsement of his
re-election bid threatening to
become an issue before the Civil
Rights Commission, yesterday
denounced "the politics of racial
hatred and religious bigotry
practiced by the Klan."
In a letter sent from China to
Morris Abram, the commis
sion s vice chairman, Reagan
said he was distressed to learn
that questions had been raised
about whether his views had
changed since 1980, when he
repudiated a similar Klan en
dorsement.
"If anything, my feelings on
this subject have only grown
stronger," he wrote Abram.
Reagan's letter was in
response to a call to the White
House last week by Abram, who
noted that Mary Frances Berry,
one of the commission's shar
pest critics of Reagan's civil
rights policies, wanted the issue
of the Klan endorsement dis
cussed at the commission's
meeting yesterday.
Berry, in an April 17
memorandum asking that the
subject be added to the agenda,
attached a wire service report
that Reagan's spokesmen at the
White House and at his re
election campaign refused com
ment when asked about the en
dorsement. The next day,
however, presidential spokes
man Larry Speakes said,

"There's been no change in the
president's views since 19K0."
As they made public
Reagan's letter, Abram and
John Bunzel, both Reagan ap
pointees to the commission,
challenged Jackson to repudiate
his endorsement by Black Mus
lim leader Louis Farrakhan.
They noted that Farrakhan,
whom they charged preaches ra
cial hatred, has served as a war
mup speaker at Jackson rallies
and has furnished the candidate
with bodyguards. Farrakhan has
threatened the life of a black
reporter who reported that
Jackson had referred to Jews as
"Hymies" and has called Hitler
a "wickedly great" man.
If Jackson "has not
repudiated the sentiments and
endorsements of Louis Farrak
han before our next meeting, we
would like this issue placed on
the agenda for discussion," they
said in a memorandum that
Abram read at yesterday's
meeting.
Jackson has voiced disagree
ment with Farrakhan's com
ments but has refused to disas
sociate himself from the Black
Muslim leader.
Abram and Bunzel appeared
to pick up a theme of Vice Pres
ident George Bush, who last
month criticized Mondale and
Hart for not being firm enough
in their denunciations of Far
rakhan.
They said that the commis
sion's discussion "should also
focus on whether other
presidential candidates are un
equivocal in disassociating
themselves from individuals
who espouse racism, bigotry, in
timidation or threats of violence
or those who accept the open
support of those who do."
