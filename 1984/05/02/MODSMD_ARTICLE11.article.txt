## The 						Stanford Daily Remember the workers 
### 
Last December, the current leadership of the
United Stanford Workers (USW) was elected on
a platform that included a promise to begin
USW's disaffiliation from the Service Employees
International Union's (SEIU) Local 715. USW
had been affiliated with the countywide local
since 1980.
After USW's executive committee had gath
ered over 500 signatures calling for a disaffiliation
election. Local 715 withdrew from representing
the Stanford bargaining unit. Michael Baratz, ex
ecutive secretary of Local 715, explained in a let
ter to the University that the SEIU had separated
the unions and had rechartered the Stanford bar
gaining unit as Local 680. Baratz asked that the
University recognize officials of Local 680 as rep
resentatives of Stanford's employees.
The University balked. Claiming that recogni
tion of 680 could not occur until a disaffiliation
election had been held, Stanford refused to recog
nize officials of Local 680 in grievance and ar
bitration hearings. University officials say that
their contract is still with Local 715, and only offi
cials of Local 715 will be recognized as represen
tatives of the bargaining unit.
Since then, much has happened: Both the Uni
versity and Local 680 have filed charges of unfair
labor practices with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), USW has held an election whose
validity the University is disputing, and in

response USW has tiled additional charges
against the University for not accepting the elec
tion as valid and final.
At this time, the entire matter remains un
resolved. The University is waiting for the
NLRB's ruling on IJSW's latest charge before
saying anything more. The complexities of labor
law and the protracted struggle encourage the
casual observer to ignore the issue entirely. It has
become very easy to forget that this battle, thus
far, has had only one real loser: the Stanford
employees.
The University claims to be looking out for the
workers' democratic rights to choose their repre
sentatives. We feel the workers have already cho
sen. Back in December, the union membership
elected the present USW leadership. They con
firmed their desire by a vote of 630 to 125 last
month.
Whether the union is called 680 or 715 is a
matter of semantics.
Because it refuses to even tentatively accept the
elections outcome, the University, by not pro
cessing grievance and arbitration requests, is
merely hurting its employees.
The University may not be breaking the law
when it refuses to recognize Local 680 before the
NLRB makes a ruling. But if the University is
honestly concerned with its employees' rights,
then it should make every effort to process griev
ances in the interim.
