## Keep theme houses open to frosh 
### 
I was extremely upset to read the
article entitled "No frosh in theme
houses" (Daily, April 30). A move
such as the one described would be
totally detrimental to Stanford's
efforts to provide a supportive, com
fortable and equitable housing situa
tion for all students.
Providing ethnic theme houses as
an option for freshmen entering
Stanford is essential. All students
should be allowed a place "to go
home to" where they can feel like
part of a community. Furthermore,
different cultures and attitudes at
Stanford should he encouraged and
protected. The theme of my freshman
year was "diversity." Is the theme of
next year's frosh going to be
"assimilation?"
It is also true that white freshmen
can benefit from being exposed to the
learning environment in an ethnic
theme house.
1 think it is essential to look at the
whole issue from another standpoint.
How would the majority of white
freshmen coming to Stanford feel
about being left no option but to live
in an ethnic theme house? Sounds
like an outrageous question, right?
Then how, in all fairness, can we
expect to force all minority freshmen
to live in predominantly caucasian
housing, that is, to live in "white
theme houses?"
Stanford minority freshmen need a
place on this campus where they will
be provided with a supportive envi
ronment during their introduction to
Stanford as well as a place where they
can learn about their heritage.
A move to keep freshmen out of
ethnic theme houses would be a tragic
setback to the concept of residential
education at Stanford.
