## Political hardball in the Big Leagues 
### 
He was very old, the Pitcher was, hut he carried himself so well
that very tew seemed to notice, although everyone knew. Despite
his age he was very successful, and perhaps the most popular
pitcher the team had had in a long time. He had been, of all
things, a cricketer, but when he had become too old for that sport
he had tried to be. and became, the pitcher for the team.
He had lost, it was supposed, all of his "stuff," and this was
true. His fastball floated, his curveball hung, and he had no
change of pace. Still, he was very successful, and this was because
ol his delivery. With furious gesticulation and mock rage he would
cow a batter, or with seeming openness and friendliness he would
lull the hitter. It worked.
This upset the catcher greatly. He, stocky and unkempt, envied
the Pitcher's ease in playing the game, and begrudged him his po-

sition on the mound. The catcher had spent his whole life playing
the game, but had never been asked to pitch. That he could live
with; he never pictured himself pitching anyway, he told himself.
Still, he could hope, and he did his best to make things uncomfort
able for the old Pitcher. The two of them could never seem to
agree on the signs, and before almost every pitch they would both
fly into a rage. The catcher would turn to the fans, and complain
of the unreasonableness of what the Pitcher wanted, and how he,
with his great experience, should be the one to make the calls.
The Pitcher would just turn to his team and shake his head sadly.
On this team, you see, the Pitcher was also the manager. He
had gotten to pick almost the whole team behind him, except for
the catcher, and. although this was kind of a team secret, the first
baseman. Except for those two, and even the first baseman was
coming around, he could count on their support. They, under
standably enough, gave it to him.
" Buckle down out there, kid!" the first baseman cried, feeling a
bit ridiculous as he yelled. He didn't really like the Pitcher at all,
and they had, in training, fought bitterly over who was going to
get to pitch. He had thought he had it all sewn up, but the Pitcher
did some tricky stunts — not cheating, mind you, the first
baseman would never imply that — and suddenly here he was at

first base. Furthermore, the first baseman didn't much care for the
Pitcher's choice of an infield, whose errant throws and miscues he
was always having to cover.
Indeed, the middle infielders were not the best of ballplayers,
but the Pitcher felt that it was more important to have a strong
team spirit than a great defense. The men he had picked were old
friends, but, on their own. they would never have gotten out of
the low minors. They had no "feel" for the game, nor did they
have any great talent, and, worst of all, they simply did not know
how to get along with the fans.
The Pitcher almost despaired at this. It came so easy to him, yet
they were at such a loss. He had even tried different people, other
friends, at those positions (he had been forced to experiment,
really; the original shortstop had shot himself in the foot) but

none did any better than others. Things were getting worse
though.
This team, such as it was, was readying for the most important
game of the season. Today they would play the Other Team, their
crosstown rivals, and, as they were tied for first place, the winner
would get his pick of all the farm teams. The old Pitcher was eager
for the game, as was his whole team, although some fans won
dered if there wasn't a better way to set up the farm system and
allow for trades.
The Other Team played under a different system. (This was
possible because there were no rules to the game, other than the
ones that a team might apply to itself. Although a team breaking
the other team's rules might set itself up for some squabbling with
the umpires, there really was nothing to be done.) Although they
carried a huge squad, only one man would come to bat. Even od
der, he was usually the oldest of the team.
He would stand at the plate and hit and hit, until the strain of
running all the time was too great for him and he died. At which
point one of the younger men on the team would come in to run
for him, but another oldster would come to bat. They'd get a run
then, since their hitter always hit prodigious drives, but their
scores were, necessarily, few and far between.

The Pitcher's team did not score much either, due to the insis
tence that the players and the fans had for always being on
defense. This vexed the old Pitcher, hut he knew how quirky the
fans could be about honor. ;ind deep down he probably sym
pathized. Today, however, lie had a problem.
The heavy hitter on the Other Team was continually sending
ringing shots to the outfield, and it was obvious that he had to do
something about his outfielders. They needed help, but the only
place he could get it from was the Unaligned Team. He didn't
want to do that, but he had no choice.
The Unaligned Team was an oddity. It had a similar strategy to
the Other Team, but they played by the Pitcher's team's rules.
Furthermore, they all wore the same uniform, at home or on the
road, even when they were traded. So, it was very difficult for the
Pitcher to reconcile himself to the idea of sending to them for
help, especially as when you sent for one you were liable to get
thousands. But, as it was said, he had no choice.
I he Pitcher knew that his decision would be unpopular with his
team, especially will) the third baseman (who, on his side,
very close to the line), but he did it. Late in the game an outfield
gate broke open, and thousands of men from the Unaligned Team
came spilling into the outfield.
The hitter for the Other Team, seeing this, knew he had to do
something very special, and, although he had sort of promised he
would never use it, he took out his special bat. If he couldn't get a
hit to the outfield, he would hit it clear out of the park.
The Pitcher, seeing this, decided he would have to, although he
swore he never would, use his special pitch. This scared everyone
on the team, for they felt that at the very best it would wreck the
Pitcher's arm, and at the worst . . . well, they chose not to think
about it.
The fans grew very uneasy, for they knew that this was the thing
that could end the league. If both teams used their ultimate weap
ons, then the game would no longer be fun, and the league would
be broken up. They were very frightened, and they sat on the
edge of their seats, as the Pitcher wound up. and the Unaligned
Team moved to swallow up the mound.
The Pitcher tossed the pitch with more reluctance than usual, a
looping, dying throw. The batter, fearing yet wanting to swing,
batted hesitantly at the ball. Doing so. he kicked up a great cloud
of dust.
When the dust settled, the ball was in the catcher's mitt, and the
batter had struck out. Both men looked toward their "secret
weapons with disgust, and thought that they weren't so special
after all. Bah! they said, "We can do just as well on our own, as
we have been doing all along!" So they left the field, vowing never
to use their specialties again.
So, too, the fans left, feeling relieved but troubled by a vague
notion that they had missed something.
