## Reagan blatantly violating international law 
### 
No matter whether one considers the tragic
events in Central America as inevitable products
of global communist-led insurgency or as the result
of generations of internal social inequities, the
Reagan administration's policy toward the region
and its people must be seen as a strong disregard
for, if not a blatant violation of, international law.

VIEWPOINT

The inhumane treatment of El Salvadoran
refugees in the United States and the mining of
Nicaragua's harbors illustrate the Reagan adminis
tration's selective use of international standards of
justice — standards which the administration
ignores when they hinder the Reagan gunboat
diplomacy in Central America.
In the Refugee Act of 1980. the United States
pledged adherence to the United Nations Conven
tion on Refugees. That agreement requires its sig
natories to admit any person who is outside his or
her country "owing to a well-founded fear of being
persecuted for race, religion, nationality, member
ship of a particular social group or political
opinion." The United Nations High Commission
on Refugees has determined Salvadorans who
have fled their country to be political refugees.
However, the Reagan administration has consis
tently denied undocumented Salvadorans political
asylum status, stating time and again that these
refugees are "economic migrants." even though
church groups in El Salvador have documented
many cases of the Salvadoran military viciously
torturing and killing their countrymen on the basis
of suspected political sympathy for the leftist

groups. The State JDepartment persists in main
taining that the refugees from El Salvador are not
fleeing political persecution, even though the
United Nations Commission has issued two warn
ings to the United States to the effect that the
deportation of Salvadorans could be a violation of
international law and in spite of reports that many
of the deportees arc killed upon their return to El
Salvador.
The ClA's direct involvement in the mining of
Nicaraguan harbors also runs contrary to the
standards of international justice. In fact, conser
vative Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), chairman
of the Select Committee on Intelligence, called the
mining an "act violating international law. ..an
act of war."
As a reaction to this latest act of American inter
vention in its affairs, Nicaragua brought a com
plaint in the International Court of Justice against
the United States. The complaint charged the
United States with trying to destabilize and over
throw the Sandinista government. Prior to the
Nicaraguan action, the Reagan administration an
nounced that it would not accept the I.C.J.'s juris
diction on matters concerning Central America for
the next two years. That announcement led one
Republican senator to suggest that the executive
branch was running from World Court jurisdiction
"like some criminal jumping bail."
Though the Reagan administration considers
Nicaragua's plea to the I.C.J, a propaganda move,
it nonetheless has sent a team of 15 U.S. State De
partment lawyers to argue that the court has no
jurisdiction in the Nicaraguan matter. The State
Department's legal team based its assertion on the
hypertechnical claim that Nicaragua had never

tiled an official statement of ratification accepting
the court's jurisdiction. The chief U.S. legal ad
viser said that the United States was only appear
ing at the World Court "because of its deep and
longstanding commitment to the International
Court of Justice as an important institution for
resolving differences of a judicial character be
tween states."
That statement by the State Department's attor
ney underscores why adherence to international
standards is so crucial in our volatile world.
Though international legal institutions have no ef
fective enforcement mechanisms, nations have
realized that a certain modicum of international
law is necessary for the maintenance of global or
der (e.g., recognition of national sovereignity),
commerce (e.g., the freedom of the high seas) and
decency (e.g., the treatment of prisoners of war ac
cording to the Geneva War Convention). Even the
Reagan administration has been quick to cite
breaches of international law by the Soviet Union's
downing of the Korean airliner, by the Polish gov
ernment's oppression of its own people and by the
Libyan government's support of terrorism.
The Reagan administration's response to the El
Salvadoran refugee situation and to the
Nicaraguan mining incident undermines its own
arguments for the application of international legal
standards. More importantly, the Reagan adminis
tration is destroying an already tenuous hope that
international problems and disputes can be solved
by peaceful rather than militaristic and parochial
means.
