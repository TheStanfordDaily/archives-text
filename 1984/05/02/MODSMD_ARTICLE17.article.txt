## Underage drinking University policy stresses self regulation 
### ALICE YANG 
A tew weeks ago, on a night much like any other, two students
left a party to get some air. Less than 100 yards from their dorm
they were stopped by a policeman. One of the students was cradling
a bottle of Jack Daniels.
After the officer left, the Jack Daniels was gone — in its place, a
notice to appear in court. The student, a minor, was cited for pos
session of alcohol. That's the law.
Although it may be illegal tor a minor to have alcohol, enforce
ment of the law on campus is sporadic. Incidents like the one above
are more the exception than the rule, but they raise an important
question: What is the policy that determines the enforcement of this
and other laws regarding alcohol?
The answer is complicated, not always complete and involves
Residential Education, the Stanford Police and organizers of
campuswide parties such as Splendor on the Grass.
Res Ed wants to de-emphasize alcohol but will not enforce alco
hol laws; the Stanford Police will not interfere with parties that
serve minors unless there is an incident; party organizers presently
depend on beer company sponsorship for financial support.
Captain Marvin Moore of the Stanford Police Department ex
plained that the police will respond to violations, but will not "go

out there like bloodhounds and smell out every person who's drink
ing underage. If we pass a party and we see people standing out
with cups, we're not going to look and see what's in the cup. But if
we see somebody walking down the street with a cup and they ap
pear to be under the influence, we would probably stop that person
and, if necessary, take enforcement action."
The reluctance to seek out violations is due largely to limited re
sources, but even more important, Moore explained, "We know
that in a university setting there's underage drinking, and we realize
there's a socialization process going pp. It's part ol the University
and it comes under the University guidelines."
And such guidelines, said Alice Supton, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education, are to afford students with the opportunity to
soundly decide on their own, with knowledge of the law, whether or
not to drink. Res Ed now requires all public parties to serve food
and non-alcoholic beverages ("Water doesn't count," says Supton)
in addition to any alcohol, but it steers away from enforcing the law.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, explained the policy, saying,
"Self regulation is, whenever possible, preferable, because we're
just a university that's not very good at policing."
But Lyons emphasized that the University does not encourage
underage drinking, saying, "Some students might mistake the tact
that the police aren't there every time there s a keg tapped to mean
somehow that the University condones underage drinking. We
don't. We don't have a position on it."
He added that despite the apparent gap in enforcement left by
Res Ed and the Stanford Police, the University is not a sanctuary for
students from state drinking laws.

a sanctuary for students from state drinking laws.
Nevertheless, there has been a recent increase in the number of
beer-company-sponsored, all-campus events and this has both the
police and University officials worried that self regulation is not al
ways sufficiently exercised.
The police department's concern, said Moore, is that "bringing in
a truck with 50 kegs of beer to assure that everybody there can
drink all the beer they want and the beer supply will never run out
. . . provides a catalyst for those that normally may not overextend
themselves to overextend themselves. These kinds of parties in
crease the potential for disastrous outcome 10-fold because of the
large quantities of beer consumed."
Lyons agrees that the number of large parties has increased to the
"discomfort level" for the University because there is not always
self regulation to see that underaged students are not served and
that people in general are not served too much. Moreover, said
Lyons, steps are not always taken to take care of intoxicated party
goers so as to minimize alcohol-related accidents.
Just how necessary is beer company sponsorship to the success of
an all-campus event? As an alternative, Supton suggested sponsor
ship by non-alcohol companies. Could campuswide events function

without the beer companies?

"Absolutely," said David Eis
ner, head organizer of this
year's Splendor on the Grass.
However, Eisner is nevertheless
looking forward to a Miller
sponsorship. He explains, "The
only reason most (events) do
have beer sponsorship is that
the beer companies are the most
interested because they get the
most direct advertising. It's very
difficult to put on a party that
has an $8000 budget, and if Mil
ler's going to offer us a substan
tial amount more than, say, Ap
ple Computer, why should we
go with Apple Computer?"
Eisner says he is frustrated
that University officials "talk a
lot" about getting away from
beer sponsorship, but provide
no tangible incentives to do so,
such as matching the contribu
tions of a non-alcoholic sponsor.
But, Lyons argues, "Not only
is it not our practice to provide
that direct support, but it's
probably one of the least impor
tant things in the University, to
use University funds to buy kegs
for a student party."

Meanwhile, Moore and the police department talk of limiting the
number of alcoholic campuswide events. That, too, is not a step the
University is eager to take, despite its concern about the abundance
of such events. "It's not something we can easily regulate, probably
not something we want to regulate, probably something we ought
not to regulate," said Lyons. "But we can regulate the conditions
under which parties are given. It's conceivable that we could
become a party school . . . but what we do about it is another mat
ter."
Perhaps University officials, the police, and even some students

may find comfort in knowing that the beer truck trend is not neces
sarily irreversible. Already there are small but hopeful signs. Accor
ding to Bob Levy, head of Club Big Way, Michelob is just as happy
to have "oodles of frisbees, hats, and cups for give-away" than to
bring in a beer truck. What is perhaps more surprising, said Levy, is
that "people actually drank more soda than beer at our golf event
because there were sodas right next to the beer."

a bottle of Jack Daniels.
After the officer left, the Jack Daniels was gone — in its place, a
notice to appear in court. The student, a minor, was cited for pos
session of alcohol. That's the law.
Although it may be illegal tor a minor to have alcohol, enforce
ment of the law on campus is sporadic. Incidents like the one above
are more the exception than the rule, but they raise an important
question: What is the policy that determines the enforcement of this
and other laws regarding alcohol?
The answer is complicated, not always complete and involves
Residential Education, the Stanford Police and organizers of
campuswide parties such as Splendor on the Grass.
Res Ed wants to de-emphasize alcohol but will not enforce alco
hol laws; the Stanford Police will not interfere with parties that
serve minors unless there is an incident; party organizers presently
depend on beer company sponsorship for financial support.
Captain Marvin Moore of the Stanford Police Department ex
plained that the police will respond to violations, but will not "go

out there like bloodhounds and smell out every person who's drink
ing underage. If we pass a party and we see people standing out
with cups, we're not going to look and see what's in the cup. But if
we see somebody walking down the street with a cup and they ap
pear to be under the influence, we would probably stop that person
and, if necessary, take enforcement action."
The reluctance to seek out violations is due largely to limited re
sources, but even more important, Moore explained, "We know
that in a university setting there's underage drinking, and we realize
there's a socialization process going pp. It's part ol the University
and it comes under the University guidelines."
And such guidelines, said Alice Supton, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education, are to afford students with the opportunity to
soundly decide on their own, with knowledge of the law, whether or
not to drink. Res Ed now requires all public parties to serve food
and non-alcoholic beverages ("Water doesn't count," says Supton)
in addition to any alcohol, but it steers away from enforcing the law.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, explained the policy, saying,
"Self regulation is, whenever possible, preferable, because we're
just a university that's not very good at policing."
But Lyons emphasized that the University does not encourage
underage drinking, saying, "Some students might mistake the tact
that the police aren't there every time there s a keg tapped to mean
somehow that the University condones underage drinking. We
don't. We don't have a position on it."
He added that despite the apparent gap in enforcement left by
Res Ed and the Stanford Police, the University is not a sanctuary for
students from state drinking laws.

a sanctuary for students from state drinking laws.
Nevertheless, there has been a recent increase in the number of
beer-company-sponsored, all-campus events and this has both the
police and University officials worried that self regulation is not al
ways sufficiently exercised.
The police department's concern, said Moore, is that "bringing in
a truck with 50 kegs of beer to assure that everybody there can
drink all the beer they want and the beer supply will never run out
. . . provides a catalyst for those that normally may not overextend
themselves to overextend themselves. These kinds of parties in
crease the potential for disastrous outcome 10-fold because of the
large quantities of beer consumed."
Lyons agrees that the number of large parties has increased to the
"discomfort level" for the University because there is not always
self regulation to see that underaged students are not served and
that people in general are not served too much. Moreover, said
Lyons, steps are not always taken to take care of intoxicated party
goers so as to minimize alcohol-related accidents.
Just how necessary is beer company sponsorship to the success of
an all-campus event? As an alternative, Supton suggested sponsor
ship by non-alcohol companies. Could campuswide events function

without the beer companies?

"Absolutely," said David Eis
ner, head organizer of this
year's Splendor on the Grass.
However, Eisner is nevertheless
looking forward to a Miller
sponsorship. He explains, "The
only reason most (events) do
have beer sponsorship is that
the beer companies are the most
interested because they get the
most direct advertising. It's very
difficult to put on a party that
has an $8000 budget, and if Mil
ler's going to offer us a substan
tial amount more than, say, Ap
ple Computer, why should we
go with Apple Computer?"
Eisner says he is frustrated
that University officials "talk a
lot" about getting away from
beer sponsorship, but provide
no tangible incentives to do so,
such as matching the contribu
tions of a non-alcoholic sponsor.
But, Lyons argues, "Not only
is it not our practice to provide
that direct support, but it's
probably one of the least impor
tant things in the University, to
use University funds to buy kegs
for a student party."

Meanwhile, Moore and the police department talk of limiting the
number of alcoholic campuswide events. That, too, is not a step the
University is eager to take, despite its concern about the abundance
of such events. "It's not something we can easily regulate, probably
not something we want to regulate, probably something we ought
not to regulate," said Lyons. "But we can regulate the conditions
under which parties are given. It's conceivable that we could
become a party school . . . but what we do about it is another mat
ter."
Perhaps University officials, the police, and even some students

may find comfort in knowing that the beer truck trend is not neces

to have "oodles of frisbees, hats, and cups for give-away" than to
bring in a beer truck. What is perhaps more surprising, said Levy, is
that "people actually drank more soda than beer at our golf event
because there were sodas right next to the beer."

A tew weeks ago, on a night much like any other, two students
