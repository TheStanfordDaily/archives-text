# Chemistry: easy asl-2-3

### JILL GILBERT 
Imagine a chemistry class
where you can perform all
experiments in your dorm
room and where most of the
students are not worried
about the MCATs. Despite
what your pre-med friends
may try to tell you, such a
course does exist here.
Chemistry 123, a new
course taught this quarter by
Prof. Dick Zare, has
"intellectual curiosity" as its
only prerequisite.
Designing the course for
the humanities-oriented stu
dent, Zare chose to number
the class one-two-three, per
haps intending to reflect the
comparatively simple, un
complicated nature of its
content. In his twice weekly
lectures, Sara—emphasizes
that "science is a human ac
tivity, done by real people,"
while encouraging "a deeper
sense of wonderment in the
world we live in."
Chem 123 offers a differ
ent perspective on the
sciences than a more conven
tional introductory course,
not only because of contex
tual disparities, but also be
cause of the diversity of the
students' attitudes. "They
don't have to pass MCATs,"
says Zare. Teaching assistant
Sarah Williams adds that "a
new perspective is brought to

chemistry by those who
aren't used to thinking in a
scientific manner."
Freshman Tracey Reese
admits that although her ini
tial motivation to sign up for
Chem 123 was to fulfill her
Natural Sciences distribution
requirement, she now finds
the course "good for people
who don't want to continue
in the sciences, but want to
get an idea of how the world
works," which, she adds,
"everyone should know.
"I started to take Chem 30
and it was so boring and
detailed. In here, it's fun,
without being too compli
cated. Professor Zare really
gives good lectures and I en
joy how he relates chemistry
to things we don't under
stand," Reese said.
The tone of the lectures
are reminiscent ot those edu
cational science programs on
Sunday morning public tele
vision. But, unlike those
shows, the purpose of this
class is not entertainment
value, but the serious explo
ration of scientific
phenomema as well as the
elucidation of the role of sci
ence in society. It is a class
about science as much as it is
a chemistry class. Williams
says that the class "helps a
student to understand what a
scientist does and why she

does it." Furthermore, the
required readings aren't dry
texts, but include James
Watson's "The Double
Helix" and Isaac Asimov's
"On Chemistry" as well.
Zare's vibrant enthusiasm
pervades each lecture, as
does his extended efforts to
produce as informative, sub
stantial and interesting a
course as possible. You can
find evidence of his zeal
manifested in the personal
ads he places in The Daily
Classifieds every day. Al
though he was prepared to
accept as many as 100 stu
dents for this quarter, he was
disappointed to find only 22
students enrolled. He is
hoping for more popularity
next year when more stu
dents ktiOW about (he Course.
Chem 123 should certainly
be considered by those with
any interest in chemistry
whatsoever. Despite her ex
tensive background in
chemistry, Williams "still
learns new things in every
lecture. We teach just
enough to show the student
how much they don't under
stand," she said.
So if you don't like dealing
with numbers as high as the
one you just picked in the
Draw, you just might be in
terested in Chem 123.
