## 
### CLAY CALVERT Daily staff 
The University announced yesterday morning at
a meeting with residents of Escondido Village that
it will institute a "grandfather" rent structure for
present members of that graduate student housing
project beginning this spring, according to Ed
Scoles, director of housing management.
Under the "grandfather clause" rent structure,
all incoming renters starting this tall will be as
sessed a higher fee. determined as the difference
between the average rent increase and a tully in
dexed ratio of rents on all University housing.

Pam Lagarde, a member of the Escondido Rent
Fairness Coalition, said the new system amounts to
"a leveling out of percentage increase" for Village
units and is "really not a grandfather clause." She
said the 10.85 percent increase next year lowers
the initially projected rent on three-bedroom units
from 14 percent, yet raises the previously
predicted level on one- and two-bedroom apart
ments.
Scoles acknowledged that Village residents are
"still not too happy" with the new system, but
stressed that the 10.85 percent figure is the
average increase for all campus housing, including

undergraduate residences.
Past rent increases were "certainly higher than
inflation." Scoles said, adding that the University
failed to notify present residents at the time of ap
plication to Stanford what future rent increases
would be. He said the Graduate Financial Aids Of
fice "will entertain individual situations" where
residents have serious financial difficulties due to
high rent increases.
Tom Lutz, an Escondido resident, said his rent
has increased 78 percent since he came to the Uni-
versity in 19N1. Lutz said rent on his
three-bedroom apartment has in
creased from $323 a month to $559 a
month.
Lutz said Scoles told residents yes
terday that these were the final plans
for the Escondido rent structure and
that he was not willing to negotiate the
new system.
Scoles said the University will make
advance information about rent in
creases over a period of four to live

years available to perspective resi
dents in the future.
Lutz said the 10.85 increase is still
considerable when added "on top ot
16. 15 and 14 percent increases of the
past." He added that present residents
with two-bedroom units would actu
ally be paying higher rent than future
residents.
While many graduate students art
upset that they are financing under
graduate housing in which they cannot
live, Scoles noted that "everybody in
the housing system would participate"
in future housing projects.
