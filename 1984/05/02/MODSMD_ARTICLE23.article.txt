# Stanford prepares $50 million bond sale
## 
### DANNY PEARL 
The University announced Monday
that it will issue $50.2 million in bonds
May 9 and will set aside $l million for
purchase by faculty, staff and
"friends" of Stanford.
The bonds will pay 6 to 10 percent
interest, depending on maturity date,
and will provide $11.5 million for a
new telecommunications system. $9
million for updating the animal re
search facility, $21.5 million for four
years of general plant improvements,
$1.8 million for the Blood Center and
$1.3 million for expansion of Bowman
Alumni House.
According to Harry Turner, associ
ate University treasurer, many inves
tors have already expressed interest in
the bond issue. "We have every ex
pectation that there will be commit
ments to purchase 80 to 90 percent of
the issue before the bonds are actually
put on sale," he said.
"It's a blue-chip investment possi
bility. The degree of assurance that
Stanford can pay off the bonds
through good and bad times is almost
absolute," Turner said.
Turner said the bonds will be sold
all over the country, but Stanford has
reserved $1 million in a "Stanford
Friends Account 1 ' through a special
arrangement with underwriter L.F.

Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin in or
der to give those connected with the
University a better chance to invest.
The bonds can be purchased in
$5000 increments, after a minimum
investment of $5000. Turner said the
investors will have no voting rights
and no control over University
policies.
Stanford is one of many large uni
versities, including the University of
Southern California, UC-Berkeley
and many of the Ivy League schools,
that have issued bonds. However,
Stanford is unique in the sense that it
received a triple-A rating, which al
lows the University to pay the lowest
interest rate available, without having
to put up any property as collateral.
"We are borrowing just on the
promise to repay the loan," Turner
said.
As a private institution, Stanford
cannot issue the bonds directly but has
to issue them through the California
Education Facilities Authority.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the Uni
versity president, said the bond issue
would not forestall a tuition increase,
however. Hamrdla noted that bond is
sues are primarily used to finance
building projects, while tuition money
is used for the University's operating
costs.
