## UCLA's Gray will forgo senior season 
### 
Angeles (AP) — Center
Stuart Gray, who never lived up
to expectations at UCLA, said
yesterday he will pass up his
senior year in college and make
himself available for the June 19
National Basketball Association
draft.
"It's something 1 had to do."
said Grav. a 7-footer. "1 made
the decision last week. I've been
thinking about it for about three
months.
"The guy who's going to rep
resent me, Keith Glass, knew
how unhappy 1 was. It was a dif
ficult three years (at UCLA) lor
me. 1 just had to close this chap
ter of my life and start some
thing else."
As a senior at Kennedy High
in nearby Sepulveda. he was one
of the most highly recruited
prep players in the country.
"There's a lot of things that
didn't go right, but I really don't
want to get into why 1 was un
happy," lie told the Associated
Press by telephone. "Things just
didn't turn out like 1 expected.
"It was time for me to bow
out quietly, that's what 1 have to
do. It's just something I had to
do for personal reasons and it
was a business decision, too. If
you look at next year's draft, it's
really tough."
Gray, a 235-pounder who
turns 21 later this month,
started all 28 of UCLA's games
this past season, averaging 9.9
points and 7.9 rebounds per

game with a single-game high of
22 points. He made 60.5 per
cent of his field goal attempts
and 68.9 percent of his free
throw tries.
As a freshman, he averaged
4.9 points and 4.8 rebounds per
game and as a sophomore, he
averaged 7.8 points and 6.9
rebounds per outing.
Gray acknowledged that he
didn't get a great deal of scoring
opportunities during his career
at UCLA, but added: "I'm not
saying I wanted to have the of
fense centered around me,
that's the last thing I would have
wanted. That's too much pres
sure."
Gray emphasized that the
recent changes of coaches at
UCLA — Larry Farmer
resigned and Walt Hazzard was
hired — had nothing to do with
his decision.
"Believe me, it's not a reflec
tion on Coach Hazzard," he
said.
Hazzard issued the following
statement through the UCLA
sports information office:
"We wish the young man
well. I'm surprised, hut I wish
him well. We will have a fine
team next year and we will
depend upon Brad Wright to
play center for us. We are
looking ahead to next year in a
very positive way. We feel we
have enough to get done what
has to get done."
