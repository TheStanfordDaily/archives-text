# Netters hope Waves are at low tide

### TOM CLIFFORD 
The Stanford men's tennis
team is making its final prepara
tions for the NCAA Champion
ships. The Cardinal will face No.
4-ranked Pepperdine University
today and UC-Berkeley on
Friday, on the heels of the
Pacific-10 Individual lourna
mcnt in Ojai, which took place
last weekend.
In Ojai, Stanford's No. 1
singles player, Dan Goldie, had
another strong outing. Goldie.
who was the No. 2 seed in the
tournament, made it to the
semifinals by defeating USC's
Tim Pawsat 6-3. 6-2. But unfor
tunately he was eliminated
before reaching the finals as Mi
chael kures of UCLA defeated
him 7-6, 6-4.
In the doubles competition,
Stanford's No. 1 team of Jim
Grabb and John Letts and the
No. 2 team of Goldie and Eric
Rosenfeld were able to advance
to the semifinals as well. Grabb
and Letts were knocked out by
USC's (and the country's) No. 1
team of Matt Anger and Antony
Emerson, 6-3. 6-4.
As usual, Goldie and Rosen
feld were involved in another
close match. This time their op
ponents were UCLA's Kures and
Mark Basham According to
Head Coach Dick Gould, "We
were down 0-4 in the first set
and came back to win the set 6-
4. But UCLA just came back
strong in the last two."
Although the Bruin pair won
6-1, 6-1, the score was not in
dicative of the match. "There
were a lot of 3-3 games in that
match," Gould said. "1 guess
since they (the Bruins) won
those games, they're a better
team.

"We were looking to improve
in certain areas, and in the areas
we needed to improve, we did.
We were looking at the tourna
ment as a stepping stone; we took
it seriously, but you can't give it
too much weight. On the whole,
though. I didn't think it was a
great perfomance. Now we're
going to need some momentum
before going into the NCAAs."
The Cardinal, which is cur
rently ranked third in the
country, will have its hands lull
when it takes on Pepperdine.
The Waves will be trying to con
tinue a 13-game winning streak
which has pushed their record to
an impressive 25-3. They have
only lost to New Mexico once
and UCLA twice.
Its roster is quite similar to
the Cardinal's. Only two of their
starters are seniors and three of
them are freshmen. Playing at
No. 1 for the Waves will be
Jerome Jones, who is ranked
No. 25 nationally. Kelly Jones,
their No. 2 player is ranked at
No. 42.
While its singles lineup
looks strong, its doubles
teams look even stronger. Pep
perdine's three teams have a
combined win-loss record of 50-
15. Its top pair of Jones and
Jones is ranked at No. 5 in the
country and its second team
of Rill Baxter and Ed Nagel is in
the No. 9 spot.
Gould indicated the match
will be challenging for the Card.
"If we're going to beat Pep
perdine, it will take our best ef
fort," Gould said. Because the
NCAA Tournament is only a
week and a half off, a victory
against Pepperdine is important
lor two reasons.
The first is the rankings.

iould indicated he thought it
was essential for the Cardinal to
go into the tournament seeded
third or better. Since the Waves
are ranked fourth, a loss would
probably knock Stanford out ot
third.
Also, a win will give Stanford
confidence and help to improve
its mental attitude. Gould indi

cated he thought the Cardinal
h;is a good chance to do well at
the NCAAs. "I think it we can
t>et some momentum, we're
going to be a real threat.
Today's match, as well as
Friday's against Cal. will begin
at 1:30 p.m. at the Varsity len
nis Courts.
