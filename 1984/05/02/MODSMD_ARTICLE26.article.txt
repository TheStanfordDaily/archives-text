### 
Philadelphia (AP) â€” Star
middle-distance runner Syd
ney Maree, who left his
native South Africa because
of its policy of racial segrega
tion, became a United States
citizen yesterday, pledging to
"give as much or more than
we will take from this
promised land of opportu
nity."
The 27-year-old Maree,
who hopes to run the 1 500-
meter event for the U.S. in
the 1984 Olympics this sum
mer at Los Angeles, said
after taking the oath that he
felt excited to be "officially a
part of the American fam
ily."
Maree was sworn in with
39 other immigrants from 23
countries in ceremonies at
Congress Hall, which adjoins
Independence Hall.
"Freedom is meaningless
unless it is accompanied by a
willingness and resolve to be
responsible in its daily exer
cise. As new citizens, we wish
to give as much or more than
we will take from this
promised land of opportu
nity, whose founding fathers
were immigrants like our
selves, and whose contribu
tions we can only hope to
emulate," Maree said in a
statement as the official
spokesman for the group.
As a black South African,
Maree was barred from com

petition in all international
track meets because of his
country's practice of apar
theid, or racial separation.
He left that country in 1977.
He attended Villanova
University near Philadelphia,
and last August set a world
record of 3 minutes, 31.24
seconds in a 1500-meter
race in West Germany. The
record stood for one week
before Britain's Steve Ovett
broke it with a time of
3:30.77.
This summer, Maree said,
he is "going for the gold," at
Los Angeles, but added that
"anything can happen."
"I have more to lose than
any other athlete who will set
foot on that track on that day
of the 1500 meters (race),
because 1 had to go through
so much fo be able to reach
the starting point," he said.
Maree added that he can't
take away the fact that he
was born in South Africa,
and that is where his mother
still lives.
"All I can say is that I
hope the people in South
Africa's government under
stand that for the world to
become a better place, towns
and countries like South
Africa have to improve their
working and understanding
with all the people in the
world," he said.
