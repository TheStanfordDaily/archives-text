# Defensive stance in NFL draft
## 
### 
New York (AP) — With the
United States Football League
having picked off some of the
glamour names, the National
Football League went heavily
for defensive and offensive
linemen while choosing only
one quarterback and one run
ning back in the first two rounds
of its annual draft yesterday.
After New England ratified
its choice of wide receiver Irving
Fryar of Nebraska, already
signed to a four-year, $2.6 mil
lion contract, and Houston did
the same with Fryar's ex
teammate, guard Dean
Steinkuhler, the NI L. shifted
emphatically to defense.
Of the next 14 picks, 13 were
defensive players. Only
Philadelphia, which used the
fourth pick of the draft to take
Penn State wide receiver Kenny
Jackson, broke the mold.
With the USFL previously
having signed the top quarter
back and running back — Steve
Young of Brig ham Young and
Heisman Trophy winner Mike
Rozier of Nebraska,
respectively — there was little
interest in those two glamour
positions.
The first running back picked
was Greg Bell of Notre Dame,
who missed most of the past two
seasons with injuries. He was
taken with the 26th pick by Buf
falo, which is seeking a replace
ment for Joe Cribbs, who
defected to Birmingham of the
USFL. The second running back
taken was Herman Heard of
Southern Colorado, by Kansas
City with the fifth pick of the
third round.
There was no quarterback
taken on the first round for the
first time since 1974, when
Danny White was selected by
Dallas on the third round as the
first quarterback.
This time, the first signal
caller to go was Boomer Esiason
of Maryland, whose injured

passing shoulder might have
hurt his first-round chances. He
was taken as the 10th pick of the
second round by Cincinnati,
which is seeking an eventual re
placement for veteran Ken An
derson. The next quarterback
picked was West Virginia's Jeff
Hostetler, by the New York
Giants with the third pick of the
third round.
In all, 17 of the 2K first-round
choices were defensive players
and so were the first eight on the
second round — making it 25
defensive players of the first 36.
Of the 25, 10 were linebackers
and nine were linemen.
Most of the suspense of the
first round revolved around the
New York Giants, who held the
third choice and were known to
be seeking offensive linemen.
With Steinkuhler gone, they had
hinted that they might trade
down and take Ohio State of
fensive tackle Bill Roberts with
a later pick.
Instead, they ended up with
the best of both worlds.
Despite one of the strongest
linebacking corps in the NFL,
they took linebacker Carl Banks
of Michigan State. Then, with
Roberts still available, they
traded two second round picks
to the Washington Redskins for
the 27th overall pick.
Then Philadelphia took Jack
son and immediately announced
it had signed him. That was
something of a counter-coup for
the NFL against the USFL —
Jackson's brother Roger plays
for the Philadelphia Stars and
the Stars had actively sought
Kenny.
Then came the onslaught of
defensive players.
Kansas City, which had
wanted Banks, settled for de
fensive tackle Bill Maas of Pitt;
San Diego, always looking for
defense, took cornerback Mossy
Cade of Texas; Cincinnati chose
Arizona linebacker Riekv Hun

ley; the Colts went for Vander
bilt cornerback Leonard Cole
man.
Then it was defensive tackle
Kick Bryan of Oklahoma to At
lanta; defensive back Russell
Carter of Southern Methodist to
the New York Jets; linebacker
Wilber Marshall of Florida to
Chicago; defensive end Al
phonso Carreker of Florida
State to Green Bay; defensive
end Keith Millard of Washing
ton State to Minnesota;
linebacker Jackie Shipp to
Miami, which traded up for Buf
falo's choice; defensive end Ron
Faurot of Arkansas to the Jets,
and defensive end Pete Koch of
Maryland to Cincinnati.
Then, finally, with the 17th
pick came an offensive player —
the St. Louis Cardinals taking
wide receiver Clyde Duncan,
who spent most of his career
backing up the Chicago Bears'
Willie Gault at Tennessee.
The choice of Marshall by the
Bears was thought to be a calcu
lated risk. Expected to go much
higher, Marshall apparently
scared off other teams with his
reported demand for $1 million
a year over four years that

surfaced during his talks with
Houston, which wanted to take
him with the second pick in the
draft.
But Marshall deemed those
reports untrue.
"I wanted to play in the NFL
all along," he said. "It was a
childhood dream."
After Duncan, the Cleveland
Browns chose safety Don
Rogers of UCLA.
The Colts, with the choice
they got last year when they
traded quarterback John Elway
to Denver, took guard Ron Solt
of Maryland; tight end David
Lewis of California went to
Detroit; offensive tackle John
Alt of lowa to Detroit; corner
back Terry Taylor of Southern
Illinois to Seattle; wide receiver
Louis Lipps of Southern Missis
sippi to Pittsburgh; linebacker
Todd Shell of Brigham Young
to San Francisco; linebacker
Billy Cannon Jr. of Texas
A&M, son of the 1959 Heisman
Trophy winner, to Dallas; Bell
to Buffalo, which traded places
with Miami; Roberts to the
Giants, and offensive tackle
Brian Blados of North Carolina
to Cincinnati.
