# Mullins homeward bound
## 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
Stanford wide receiver Eric
Mullins was the only Stanford
senior chosen in the first nine
rounds of yesterday's National
Football League draft. The
reserve receiver was a surprise
sixth-round choice of the Hous
ton Oilers.
Mullins played behind
receivers Mike Tolliver and
Emile Harry last season and ad
mitted that he never expected to
get drafted as high as he did.
("It was kind of a surprise to
me," Mullins said. "I was in
kind of a unique situation. I
didn't have much playing time

and 1 didn't have the stats, but 1
ran for a couple of people (at
minicamps before the draft) and
felt that my speed may have
helped me.
"Houston needs a receiver
that could go deep and I was
able to run a 4.4 40-yard dash
for them. I felt I did a good job
(at the minicamps)," he said.
(Mullins, who is from Houston,
was especially pleased about the
prospect of returning home.
"I'm thrilled to death," he said.
"I came quite a distance to play
here at Stanford. I'm really
excited about the prospect of
going home and getting a
chance to play in Houston."
