Hie sole faculty member of the In
ternational Development Education
Center from a Third World country
has tiled a grievance over his denial of
tenure.
Assoc. Education Prof. Edmundo
Fuenzalida officially filed his griev
ance in late February, he said in a tele
phone interview from Chile.
The grievance was "basically
grounded on two areas," Fuenzalida
said. He believes the faculty did not
consider that his long-term research
has not been completed and that his
work is highly specialized.
Fuenzalida said most of the faculty
has little knowledge of his field, which
is the sociology of development and
education in the Third World.
Dean of the School of Education
Myron Atkin, who is handling Fuen
zalido's appeal, said he has asked a
professor emeritus to advise him on
whether the tenure denial should be
officially reviewed. The professor will
report back to Atkin by the end of the
month.
Fuenzalida said he didn't know if he
was discriminated against because of
his minority status.
He said he believed that his work
had been misunderstood. "I have tried
very hard to make clear the nature of
my work to my colleagues," he said.
"If given the opportunity to explain

. . . the misunderstanding will disap
pear."
"I don't believe my denial was
really a personal question. I believe it
was more of a policy question." Fuen
zalida added.
If Fuenzalida does not obtain ten-

ure, the School of Education will have
no minorities in tenured positions.
Fuenzalida said the denial of his ten
ure will therefore "have a serious
negative impact."
"Over the years Stanford has built a
good program in international devel
opment education," he said. "It has
not just been my work, but also the
work of a group of people. But even

so, we can't have a credible program
in international development educa
tion without any faculty who come
from developing countries."
When asked if the school will suffer
from the loss and whether it will affect
recruitment of minority students.
Fuenzalido responded, "definitely, no
doubt about that."
Fuenzalida said many difficulties
were involved in evaluating his re
search. "Normal research in tradi
tional fields with well-established re
search methods can be easily
evaluated," he said. "People who
produce research this way can be
evaluated even without complete
results.
"But my research is a different
kind," he said. "It has to do with reor
ganization of the field. It involves new
methods and new questions. The
result is that it's difficult to evaluate
while it's still being done.
"The question is that I'm engaged in
different research altogether from that
done by my colleagues at Stanford,"
he said.
Fuenzalida said his research in
volves "developing new research pro
grams rather than simpiy implement
ing research."
Fuenzalida said he thinks the Stan
ford School of Education "has become
the best in the United States." But in
order to become the "very best in the
world," the school will need to make a

concerted effort to recruit faculty
members from developing countries
and minority groups, he said.
Educational problems are world
wide. Fuenzalida said. Therefore the
Education School must have impor
tant representation in the faculty ot
people from both the developing
world and from other developed na
tions. he said.
F uenzalida said he is optimistic
about his chances for eventually at
taining tenure.
"I don't consider my situation hop*,
less," Fuenzalida said. "I have good
reasons for my grievance and I believe
my colleagues are reasonable people.
Fuenzalida has received much stu
dent support in various forms.
