Mercy, mercy me
Tomorrow's another day. But
beyond the obvious. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy will appear

from the heavens at a staff lunch to
morrow at The Daily offices. Noon.
Be there. The question is, where are
Lisa Lunch and Richard Launch? In
New Jersey and waiting around for
computer trainees at 12:30 p.m.
today, respectively.
