Operations and Maintenance, another division of Facilities
and Services, for four years and had worked at the Univer
sity for almost 20 years.
"He and Amy (Blue) had some policy differences. In
the end, he felt it better that he depart," Massy said.

job of that. He did not feel so comfortable with the goal of
greater responsiveness and sensitivity with regards to the
community," Massy added. "It was not one of his long
suits."
Blue said, "You look for compatibility. Jim's and my
styles are very different, and Jim chose to leave."
