# Personnel changes in Facilities and Services
## Shakeup leaves staff hopeful 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
Alter a four-month management shuttle, the reor
ganized administra tian of University Facilities and
Services is stressing its commitment to making the depart
ment more responsive.
' "I think that there has not been enough effort in the de
partment in reaching out to students and faculty," said
Amy Blue, the department's new head. "I think our role in
Facilities and Services has to he very attentive to meeting
their needs."
Three top administrators have left the department
during the last four months. In January, Blue took the top
post, which had been vacated by Jason Mavis. Mavis left to
take a position as the executive vice president of a Stock
ton bank.
"He got an offer he couldn't refuse," said William
Massy, vice president for business and finance, who over
sees Facilities and Services.
Blue was moved up from her spot as head of Project
Management within Facilities and Services, a position she

had held for four years.
Operations and Maintenance head James Horgan tooV
early retirement at the end of February because of a con
flict in management style with Blue. He had headed
Operations and Maintenance, another division of Facilities
and Services, for four years and had worked at the Univer
sity for almost 20 years.
"He and Amy (Blue) had some policy differences. In
the end, he felt it better that he depart," Massy said.
"Jim's long suit was efficiency and he did a very good
job of that. He did not feel so comfortable with the goal of
greater responsiveness and sensitivity with regards to the
community," Massy added. "It was not one of his long
suits."
Blue said, "You look for compatibility. Jim's and my
styles are very different, and Jim chose to leave."
Horgan refused to comment.
Facilities and Services Associate Director Gary Cavazos
was laid off last month after his duties were taken on b>
other administrators.
"His position was essentially
eliminated," Blue said.
Responsiveness to Univt >ity needs
is a major objective of the newly reor
ganized department. Massy said.
Blue agreed that "there are a lot of
opportunities for increased productiv
ity and efficiency."
Facilities and Services oversees a
wide range of campus jobs, including
Housing and Food Services, Opera
tions and Maintenance, Procurement,
Project Management and Utilities.
The department includes 580
employees and has an annual budget
of $51 million.
Operations and Maintenance, which
is responsible for carpentry, heating,
painting, electrical work and grounds
maintenance, was merged with
Utilities last week in a move that Blue
hopes will improve efficiency and
coordination. Jerry Ostrander, former
head of Utilities, was asked to
administer the new double depart
ment.
Blue said the merger was a natural
one because the groups' duties over
lap. The two departments were
separated about five years ago be
cause administrators felt the demands
were too great for one organization.
"It was too much work for any one
person to do," Mavis said. "I split
them to give each enough direct man
agement and time to develop mar
ginally and to get improved technical
personnel."

Massy said the management
changes will not affect the University's
relationship with the union or the Uni
versity's policies on contracting out
work to non-union workers, winch has
been a sore spot in labor relations
here.
Workers in Operations and Mainte
nance provide one of the strongest
bases tor union support on campus.
"Good relations at the employee
level are a priority," Massy said. "We
don't think that will change, and we
don't want that to change."
According to Blue, "If we have the
ability and have to do it. my prefer
ence is always to do it with our own
people. The time we go out is when we
can get better services for the money.
It's not done with any intent of hurting
the union."
Blue said she is currently working to
replace a number of temporary non
union positions with permanent spots
that will come under the bargaining
contract.
