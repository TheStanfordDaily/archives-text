After 15 months in office, Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los
Altos) is brimming with energy, looking forward to his
re-election campaign this year and excited about the
prospects for implementing his program of economic
reforms.
/schau (pronounced like "show" in "shower") has
received a great deal of favorable publicity during his
first term in Congress. Recent articles in California
Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle have
portrayed him as a high-tech guru and singled h-im out
as a rising star in the Republican party who is destined
for higher office.
In an interview Tuesday, /.schau said he has not
given much thought to his campaign yet. but expressed
confidence that he will retain his seat.
"Mavbe it's a naive view, but 1 don't think in terms of
politics and campaigning," /.schau said. "1 just want to
do the best job I can and hope the public will notice it.'
/schau said he is most proud of his work as chairman
of a House Republican task force on high-technology
industries. The task force recently announced a 14-
point program of legislative initiatives intended to
"create an environment in which innovation is tos
tered."
The four major goals of the program are to promote
basic research, increase incentives for risk-taking,
strengthen the American educational system and im
prove both domestic and foreign marketing opportuni
ties. /.schau said.
Although he is a member of the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee, /schau said he is still educating him

self about international issues.
"In the first year, I was more of a spectator than a
participant on foreign policy," he said,"but I'm coming
on fast and trying to play a more active role."
Economics Prof. Martin Carnoy. who is seeking the
Democratic nomination to oppose /schau in Novem
ber, has charged that the incumbent "waffles" on the
issues by pledging to vote one way, then actually voting
the other.
When asked whether Carnoy's contention is accu
rate, the congressman replied firmly. "The answer is
no."
/.schau said his critics have misrepresented his record
on military intervention in Central America.
"I'm happy to defend my record as long as it's ac
curately described," he said. "Sometimes even people
here in the House don't understand all of the implica
tions of every amendment, but I do because 1 read them
all."
Last October, /schau returned from an 1 1-day fact
finding tour of Central America and told The Daily's
editorial board he opposed covert U.S. aid to the
counter-revolutionaries fighting the Sandinista govern
ment in Nicaragua.
Two weeks later, however, he voted against the
Boland-Zablocki amendment to the Intelligence Au
thorization bill, which would have cut off such aid. The
amendment passed the House by a 227-194 vote but
was not approved by the Senate.
/schau said the amendment would have actually in-
