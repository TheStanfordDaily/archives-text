# Rep. Zschau, looking toward re-election, defends voting record
## News 
### SAM DELSON Staff writer 
After 15 months in office, Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los
Altos) is brimming with energy, looking forward to his
re-election campaign this year and excited about the
prospects for implementing his program of economic
reforms.
/schau (pronounced like "show" in "shower") has
received a great deal of favorable publicity during his
first term in Congress. Recent articles in California
Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle have
portrayed him as a high-tech guru and singled h-im out
as a rising star in the Republican party who is destined
for higher office.
In an interview Tuesday, /.schau said he has not
given much thought to his campaign yet. but expressed
confidence that he will retain his seat.
"Mavbe it's a naive view, but 1 don't think in terms of
politics and campaigning," /.schau said. "1 just want to
do the best job I can and hope the public will notice it.'
/schau said he is most proud of his work as chairman
of a House Republican task force on high-technology
industries. The task force recently announced a 14-
point program of legislative initiatives intended to
"create an environment in which innovation is tos
tered."
The four major goals of the program are to promote
basic research, increase incentives for risk-taking,
strengthen the American educational system and im
prove both domestic and foreign marketing opportuni
ties. /.schau said.
Although he is a member of the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee, /schau said he is still educating him

self about international issues.
"In the first year, I was more of a spectator than a
participant on foreign policy," he said,"but I'm coming
on fast and trying to play a more active role."
Economics Prof. Martin Carnoy. who is seeking the
Democratic nomination to oppose /schau in Novem
ber, has charged that the incumbent "waffles" on the
issues by pledging to vote one way, then actually voting
the other.
When asked whether Carnoy's contention is accu
rate, the congressman replied firmly. "The answer is
no."
/.schau said his critics have misrepresented his record
on military intervention in Central America.
"I'm happy to defend my record as long as it's ac
curately described," he said. "Sometimes even people
here in the House don't understand all of the implica
tions of every amendment, but I do because 1 read them
all."
Last October, /schau returned from an 1 1-day fact
finding tour of Central America and told The Daily's
editorial board he opposed covert U.S. aid to the
counter-revolutionaries fighting the Sandinista govern
ment in Nicaragua.
Two weeks later, however, he voted against the
Boland-Zablocki amendment to the Intelligence Au
thorization bill, which would have cut off such aid. The
amendment passed the House by a 227-194 vote but
was not approved by the Senate.
/schau said the amendment would have actually in-

creased U.S. military involvement in
the region.
He said the unamended bill cut off
covert aid, while the amendment
called for additional funds for "overt"
assistance.
"People who didn't understand
thought I was voting against cutting
off covert aid,l',./.schau said. "But
those who read the amendment know
that wasn't the ease."
Zschau has also been criticized for
his votes against the Shannon amend
ment to limit the number of U.S. mili
tary advisers in LI Salvador and the
Markey amendment, which would
have barred deployment of LJ.S. com
bat troops in Cential America unless
explicitly authorized by a joint resolu
tion of Congress.
He explained that although he does
not support U.S. intervention in the
region, he also believes the amend
ments would have been unconstitu
tional usurpations of presidential au
thority.
"I support the War Powers Act, but
I don't support Congress playing
commander-in-chief," Zschau said.
The congressman said he opposes
the Reagan administration's plans for
developing an elaborate "Star Wars"
space defense system.
"We should keep the arms race out
of space," Zschau said. "I support a
moratorium on ASAT (anti-satellite
weapons) tests."
Zschau also defended his record on
domestic issues.
In order to understand the zero
rating he received from Congress

Watch, a consumer group, "you have
to look at the votes involved," he said.
For example, Zschau said he was
marked down "because I supported a
15 percent increase for the Consumer
Product Safety Board, but they
wanted a 20 percent increase."
The vote was consistent with his
philosophy of "trying to oppose what I
consider excessive government spend
ing," /schau said. "We have to do

something about the budget deficits
because they threaten the current eco
nomic recovery."
He said he will continue to oppose
new spending that he considers fiscally
irresponsible, even if it costs him
popularity with some interest groups.
During his first year in office.
Zschau maintained a grueling
schedule that brought him back to the
12th District for more than 100 town
meetings.
The pace didn't wear him down, he

said, because he enjoyed "the
adrenaline and the challenge of the
job."
Zschau noted that many people
have urged him to run for Alan
Cranston's U.S. Innate seat in 1986.
He said he is flattered by the offers,
but insisted it is unlikely he will enter
the Senate race.
"First of all, it's unlikely that I could
win." he said. "But even it I thought it

7 had to spend so
much last time
because of my name.
People couldn't
pronounce it or spell
it/

was likely, the Senate seat would re
quire me to spend a longer time in
public office than I had planned on.
"I have a different view of Congress
than some people. I don't view it as a
career. I believe in the Jeffersonian
model of the farmer leaving his fields
to serve his country for a few years,
then returning home."
He said he expects to retire from
Congress in 1988, after serving three
terms.
/schau spent $630,570 during his

first congressional campaign, more
than 10 times as much as his Demo
cratic opponent .
Although he doesn't know how
much he'll spend this year, he said,
"It's very doubtful if I'll even come
close to what I spent in '82."
"I had to spend so much last time
because of my name," /.schau said.
"People couldn't pronounce it or spell
it. Our polls showed that only 90 days
before the election I still had very low
name identification despite the enor
mous time and money I'd invested."
Earlier in his career, Zschau spent
six years at Stanford as both a student
and a professor in the Graduate
School of Business.
He said his years on The Farm were
"the most enjoyable period of my
life."
"Stanford really transformed me.
When I arrived here in the fall of
1961, I knew nothing about business.
I'd been a philosophy major at Prince
ton, and Stanford gave me a whole
new intellectual perspective. I estab
lished friendships with students which
have lasted to this day."
Although Zschau officially left the
faculty in 1969, he said he "stayed on
as a lecturer without salary for 10
more years" while serving as president
of Systems Industries, a Milpitas com
puter firm that he founded at age 28.
Only 15 years after its creation, Sys
tems Industries is expected to have
sales of more than $100 million this
year.
During the late 19705, Zschau led a
successful effort by the electronics in
dustry to convince Congress to cut the
capital gains tax in half. The tax cut
was intended to stimulate new invest
ment in innovative industries.
