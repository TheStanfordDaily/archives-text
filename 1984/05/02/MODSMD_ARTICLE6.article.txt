Walesa joins May Day Parade
Warsaw, Poland — Lech Walesa surprised local officials by
sneaking into an official parade in Gdansk and police dis
persed thousands of Solidarity demonstrators in at least seven
cities yesterday as Poles marked the third May Day since the
authorities crushed their independent workers movement un
der martial law.
An excited Walesa told Western reporters by telephone
after his coup that it had been "the most successful May Day
of my life."
Witnesses described Polish functionaries as stupefied when
the Nobel Peace Prize-winner suddenly appeared only
10 feet from their reviewing stand in the middle of a carefully
orchestrated official parade, his arm raised defiantly in a V
for-victory sign.
Government spokesman Jerzy Urban also claimed success
on behalf of the state authorities, calling counter
demonstrations organized by the anti-government under
ground a "pitiful" failure and boasting of larger than ex
pected crowds at official observances.
Urban said that preliminary police estimates were that "not
more than 8000" persons participated in protest actions
around the country yesterday, compared with 8 million in the
otticial marches. Last year, he said, there were "incidents" in
35 Polish towns and cities involving about 43,000 persons.
"It was a beautiful manifestation for stabilization, calm, for
Poland's Socialist development and also peace in the world
and in Europe," Urban said of the day's events.
Soviets gain half of key valley
New Delhi, India — Soviet ground forces have pushed
more than halfway north through the strategic Panjshir Val
ley in Afghanistan but. for the most part, have been unable to
engage Afghan anti-communist guerrillas in battle despite the
most aggressive spring offensive yet. according to Western
diplomatic reports from Kabul that reached here yesterday.
Reports from two diplomatic missions in Kabul said the Af
ghan guerrillas had withdrawn into side valleys and mountain
hideouts, leaving a force of up to 15,000 Soviet troops and
2000 Afghan government troops, supported by 400 to 600
tanks and armored vehicles, largely unopposed, except for
hit-and-run attacks.
The Soviet and Afghan forces, according to the diplomatic
sources, reached the town of Rokha. about halfway up the
winding. 70-mile corridor northest of Kabul, and were ad
vancing toward the town of Bazarak. The Panjshir is the main
supply link between Kabul, the Afghan capital, and the Soviet
Union.
Diplomats try for peace plan
Panama City, Panama — The foreign ministers of nine
Latin American countries yesterday ordered a working group
of diplomats to draw up a general plan for peace in Central
America.
The plan will incorporate parts of a series of peace
proposals covering political, social, economic and security is
sues that the foreign ministers reviewed Monday during a
meeting sponsored by the so-called Contadora Group.
"The progress we made in the meetmg contrasts with the
alarming increase in regional violence, military activity and
weaponry as well as with the increasing foreign military pres
ence in the area," the foreign ministers declared in a joint
statement issued yesterday morning.
Lower-level diplomats from the four Contadora nations —
Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela and five
Central American - countries"-* Guatemala", El "Salvador,
Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica — have been trying
since January to draft the various peace documents. They
have fallen short of agreement because of differences over
political and military issues.
House committee approves bill
against semiconductor copying
Washington — The House Judiciary Committee voted
unanimous approval yesterday to a bill sought by California's
Silicon Valley that would make it illegal to copy computer
semiconductor chips without approval.
The measure's sponsors, Reps. Don Edwards and Norm
Mineta (both D-Calif.) said that a company can spend up to
$100 million developing a single silicon chip, only to find a
competitor duplicating it for $50,000.
U.S. computer firms have complained that their develop
ments are being stolen increasingly by foreign competitors.
Anti-piracy legislation has been pushed by Edwards and
Mineta since 1978. but it was not until recently that the U.S.
industry could agree on a specific bill, according to Marie
McGlone. a spokeswoman for Edwards.
"With this bill, we will close a gap in intellectual property
laws by giving needed protection to the innovative products
of our nation's high-tech companies," Edwards said in a
prepared statement.
"At the same time we are establishing this safeguard for the
economic health of our country, we are also carefully protect
ing the interests of consumers and of legitimate researchers in
industry," he said.
The bill would grant 10 years of proprietary protection to
the developer of a silicon chip, which is the heart of a com
puter.
State stamps out underage IDs
Sacramento — State officials are hoping to make extinct
what is practically an American teen-age institution: the fake
ID.
Beginning yesterday, all California driver's licenses and
state identification cards issued to people under the legal
drinking age of 21 will bear large red letters saying
"UNDER 21 UNTIL (the date the bearer turns 21)."
The Department of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Al
coholic Beverage Control and state law enforcement officials
hope the new license format w ill help put an end to teen-age
drinking in California.
John Thompson, assistant director of the southern divisiofi
of DABC, said sale of alcoholic beverages to persons under
2 1 was "very, very prevalent throughout the state."
"Fake IDs are readily available and easily exchanged be
tween minors," Thompson said. "We needed a better way of
precluding minors from using fake IDs. Kids have been able
to 'fine tune' their license by altering the date of birth. Now,
in addition to the normal photograph and date of birth,
minors' licenses will have the big red stamp, which they won't
easily be able to alter."
. The new licenses, which will be issued to anyone born after
May 2. 1963, will permit bartenders to know "at a glance"
that a person is under 21.
"This stamp takes most of the hesitation, guesswork or
mental arithmetic out of deciding whether the person is old
enough to be given liquor legally," DMV Director George
Meese said.
