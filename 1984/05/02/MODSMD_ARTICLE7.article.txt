From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — The top-secret aircraft that crashed
last week in Nevada, killing Air Force I t. Gen. Robert
Bond, was an advanced Soviet airplane, probably it
MiG-23 fighter, not an American "Stealth" plane, two
sources said yesterday.
The Air Force, in its official reaction to the crash,
described the plane only as a "specially modified test
aircraft." But Pentagon, national security and aircraft
industry officials agreed yesterday that, contrary to ear
lier reports, it was not a "Stealth" aircraft. "Stealth"
planes are being developed in this country with special
capacity to escape detection by radar.
The Soviet plane flown by Bond, who was vice com
mander ot the Air Force Systems Command, had ap
parently been modified in the United States, perhaps
for test purposes or for a future mission in or near the
Soviet Union.
Extreme secrecy has surrounded the accident, ap
parently because of the highly sensitive manner and

purpose for which it had been modified or because ot
the way the United States obtained the plane.
In the past, defectors have escaped to allied countries
in Soviet aircraft, among them a Russian pilot who Hew
a late-model MiG to Japan. Some world arms dealers
also specialize in obtaining Soviet aircraft parts and
equipment through Third World countries that receive
them as part of Moscow's military-aid programs.
One source said that Bond. 54. was flying close to the
surface of the desert at Mach 2 (twice the speed ol
sound) when the plane apparently went out of control
and crashed Thursday. Bond ejected before the crash,
but his parachute shredded because of the extreme
speed and he was killed.
A number of Air Force. Pentagon and other
knowledgeable officials refused to comment on the
report that a Soviet-made or Soviet-style aircraft was
involved. All insisted that the issue was too sensitive to
discuss in any fashion.
While refusing to discuss the plane involved in last

week s accident. several officials in Washington que*,
tinned the wisdom of allowing a three-star general like
Bond to fly a test aircratt of any kind, despite his oh.
vious high qualifications as a pilot.
Bond had spent more than 5001) hours in high,
performance fiuhters. including eomhat experience i n
Vietnam, and routinely flew to keep up Ins
proficiency •
But the possible benefits of allowing a high-ranking
officer fly a hiuhl v valuable test aircraft were unlikclv to
have exceeded the risks, these officials said — particu
lar it the plane involved was a special Soviet aircraft
whose existence or nature was disclosed by the acci
dent.
The accident occurred in the southwest corner of the
Nevada Nuclear Test Site, about 100 miles northwest
of I .as Vegas, after the plane had taken off from Ncllis
Air Force Base near that city-
