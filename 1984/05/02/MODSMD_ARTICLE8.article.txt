Shanghai, China — President
Reagan's six-day trip to China was "a
significant step forward" in improving
Sino-U.S. relations. Peking said yester
day, but real "mutual trust" between the
two countries remains impossible until
the United States commits itself to sharp
reductions in its arms sales to Taiwan.
The most important outcome of the
Reagan visit was the "direct contact and
dialogue between leaders of the two
countries," the official New China News
Agency said in a lengthy commentary

reflecting the government's assessment.
Reagan made the same point in an in
terview aboard Air Force One after
leaving Shanghai yesterday morning for
Fairbanks, Alaska. His talks with
Chinese leaders had "established a per
sonal rapport" between them. Reagan
said, and this had brought "a level of
general understanding about interna
tional relations" and put bilateral ties on
"a new plateau."
Chinese leaders were nevertheless dis
appointed by Reagan's refusal to prom
ise to sell fewer weapons to Taiwan, ac

cording to the Peking commentary, and
became annoyed by Reagan s repeated
declaration that "we don't believe that it
would be right to cast aside long-time old
friends in order to make new friends.
Disputing the assertion of a Reagan
administration official that "Taiwan is no
longer that important," the commentary
said, "Chinese leaders made it clear time
and again that the major barrier to fur
ther growth of Sino-American relations
remained the Taiwan question."
The president reiterated the U.S. com
mitment to the three joint communiques

that laid the base for Sino-American re
lations. including the 19N2 agreement on
reducing and eventually ending arms
sales to Taiwan. However, he resisted
Chinese pressure for more substantial
cuts in the next two or three years, well
informed Chinese officials said.
After signing the 19N2 agreement.
Washington announced projected 1983
sales of $S()() million, up from the previ
ous year's $601 million. The projection
for the 1954 fiscal year was $7N() million
and for 1985 $760 million.
