# U.S. intends to stop Japanese car quotas

From The Washington Post
Washington — The Reagan
administration's chief trade offi
cer, angered by big bonuses paid
to U.S. auto executives, served
notice to the industry yesterday
that the United States intends to
let the current quotas on
Japanese cars expire next
March.
U.S. Trade Representative
William Brock said in an inter
view that the industry will dis

cover "that our reluctance (to
extend the quotas) is a mile
wide and a mile deep."
To continue the limitation on
imported Japanese cars, now in
its fourth year, cannot be jus
tified in view of "unbelievable
new management bonuses,"
Brock asserted.
Asked why the administration
does not send such a message
directly to the industry. Brock
smiled and replied, "1 thought I

just did."
General Motors Corp.
recently announced it had paid a
group of 5807 executives
$181.7 million in bonuses last
year — an amount that Brock
said averages out to more "on a
one-shot basis than the average
worker in one of those plants
makes in a year." Ford paid
6 035 executives bonuses total
ing $80.6 million. Those figures

are exclusive of salary and stock
options.
If the industry is healthy
enough to pay such compensa
tion to its executives, "then why
does it need protection?" Brock
asked. "Do the American
people really want to subsidize
as much as $5 million or more in
bonuses for one manager?"
Ford Chairman Philip

Caldwell received $7.3 million
hist year in salary, bonus, and
stock options.
"It's hard not to feel a little
hit 'had' at this point," Brock
said of the quota deal, which for
the first three years limited the
number of Japanese imported
cars to 1.6N million units an
nually, and to 1.85 million units
in the current year, plus a small
number of station wagons.
