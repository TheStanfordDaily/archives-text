# Mosher case may be reopened
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
University President Donald Kennedy told ex
pelled anthropology graduate student Stephen
Mosher in a letter sent Tuesday that he would
probably reconsider the expulsion if Mosher
supplied answers to specific questions about his ac
tivities in China.
Kennedy said that on the basis of the existing
evidence he supports last February's decision by
the Anthropology Department Ad Hoc Commit
tee to dismiss Mosher from the doctoral program
for illegal and unethical conduct.
Kennedy's questions to Mosher shed new light
on the Mosher case by mentioning six incidents in
C hina which apparently helped force his expulsion.
Both Mosher and the ad hoc committee have
refused to release the committee report. The com
mittee has said the report would endanger inno
cent people. Mosher said it contains libelous state
ments.
University officials decided to release the full
text of the letter yesterday after they learned Mos

her had given reporters highlights of the letter.
Kennedy said in the letter that he was moved to
reconsider the case partly because of information
received in a letter from a "Ms. Vaquer," a woman
who Mosher said has "cast serious doubt upon the
accuracy of my former spouse's (Maggie So) tes
timony." Mosher said Vaquer attended Stanford
and came forward independently in his defense.
So, who was married to Mosher at the time of his
research and who had relatives in the Xing-cha vil
lage where Mosher stayed, supplied much of the
evidence against him during the ad hoc committee
investigation. Mosher has said that she threatened
to destroy him professionally if he went ahead with
a planned divorce.
Many of Kennedy's questions asked Mosher to
refute evidence presented earlier by So.
"On the basis of the existing record, I would find
that the proper facts and considerations were
taken into account, and do support the decision.
But I do not want to ignore the import of the letter
from Ms. Vaquer," Kennedy said in the letter.
"Therefore, ... I wish to give you the opportunity

to supplement the record, even at this final phase
of proceedings."
Kennedy continued, "If your answers, together
with any other information I may receive, seem to
me to add significantly to the evidence that was
before the ad hoc committee, I shall consider by
what means it can best be taken into account. My
current inclination would be to refer the matter
back to the ad hoc committee for limited recon
sideration."
The University has come under widespread
criticism from academics and major newspapers
for its refusal to release the details of the decision
to expel Mosher.
Mosher said he was disappointed that Kennedy
reopened the case rather than issuing a decision.
Mosher has appealed his case up through the aca
demic hierarchy, leaving Kennedy's ruling as the
last hope. Mosher yesterday repeated his threat
that he would sue the University if he is not
reinstated.

Stephen Mosher may have his expulsion reconsidered.
Mosher said he would answer Ken
nedy's questions fully even though he
had already supplied the information.
"All of those things I have discussed
in great detail with the faculty. I cer
tainly don't understand what the pur
pose of this process is," he said.
Mosher also repeated his charge
that he was expelled because of pres
sure from Chinese officials angry
about a Taiwan magazine article he
wrote documenting forced abortions
in China.
"I was doomed when 1 reported on
the Chinese birth control. The
Chinese sent a confidential letter to
Stanford demanding that I be dis
missed," he said.
University officials repeated their
charge that Mosher was expelled be
cause of his unethical conduct in
China and his unwillingness to supply
the University with information.
Emeritus Histroy Prof. Gordon
Wright, one of three prominent
scholars who reviewed the investigat
ing committee's report last year, said
yesterday, "If he had answered our
questions with full explanations of
what he had done, instead of saying
it's all false, then I think he might have
come out fairly well.
"He presented some partial state
ments, but virtually no evidence to
support his statements. And while at
least some of the evidence presented
against him was partial and potentially
Hawed, it was material," Wright said.
Kennedy said in his letter, "you
have not in fact responded to those
statements (of others) except with a
blanket denial of all adverse state
ments."
Mosher denied this charge, saying,
"This is a post-hoc rationalization.
You do not ruin someone's career be
cause he was impolite. You have to
have substantive grounds.
Mosher objected to Kennedy's sug
gestion that the matter be returned to
the 19-member ad hoc committee.
"You cannot send the issue back to
them. This is the committee that ruled

against me It's ridiculous to even con
sider it."he said.
Mosher also said the University's
release of the name of the village
where he stayed was "unforgivable."
Mosher had previously only identified
Xing-cha as a village near the Pearl
River Delta.
"B\ giving details about the village
where I did my research they are
jeopardizing my research informants."
he said.
Mosher's recently published first
book, "Broken Earth.'' describes the
difficult life of peasants in the
Guangdong area where he did his re
search.
Kennedy's questions twice mention
Mosher's trip through the Guizhou
province where he was stopped and
detained because the area was off
limits to foreigners. Kennedy asked
about the type of vehicle he was
driv ing and where he got it. Kennedy
also asked whether Mosher
apologized to the Chinese security
forces after he was stopped.
In a Nov .21, 1981 letter to Anthro
pology Prof. Jane Collier, head of the
ad hoc committee, /.hao Fusan of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
said Mosher complied with authori
ties' request that he sign a formal
statement admitting his error and that
he suspend his trip.
But /hao said later that Mosher
"became offensive. Not only did he
repudiate the admission of his illegal
travel which he had (previously) ad
mitted. but he turned around and sent
a cable to the Chinese department
concerned demanding that they admit
to being at fault."
Mosher said yesterday that he was
given official permission to travel
through Guizhou.
"1 had a written travel permit from
the Chinese security forces that I had
permission to travel through there,"
Mosher said.'i had no idea it was off
limits to foreigners. Had 1 known. I
wouldn't have gone.
"I think the reason I wasn't told was
because it was a secret," he said.
When he was stopped, Mosher said
he was told he could not leave the
province unless he signed a statement
admitting his error. Mosher said he

wrote a statement saying he did not do
any thing wrong, but the officials prob
ably let him go anyway because they
did not understand English well.
In another one of nine questions.
Kennedy asked about damage done to
Mosher's van which he brought into
Xing-cha village in December 1979.
"Was the \an damaged on or about
April 5, 1980? Was the van taken to
Canton at or about that time, and if so
by whom?" Kennedy asked.
Concerning another incident, Ken
nedy asked whether Mosher bought a
truck for the Brigade, an agricultural
collective organization, as was re
ported to the committee by his former
wife.
"She supplied a copy of a contract
of sale which she said was for that
truck, and a film of what she said was
that truck crossing the Chinese bor
der," Kennedy said.
Mosher said, "the allegations about
the truck are totally false."
Wright said the truck incident
"wasn't central" to the expulsion deci
sion.
"It was one of six to 10 episodes on
which there was some evidence
against Mr. Mosher and on which he
didn't present counter evidence,"
Wright said.
In another question, Kennedy asked
Mosher about bags he left at a consul
ate after being stopped for irspection
at the border.
"How many bags, and of what
description, did you leave there?"
Kennedy asked.
Kennedy also asked Mosher about
photographic equipment he brought
into China and equipment he
puchased while he was there.
"What photographic equipment did
you purchase with grant money;
where, when, and at what prices?"
Kennedy asked.
Three of the nine questions asked
Mosher to supply specific dates about
events, including the dates his former
wife was with him in Xing-cha. the
dates her parents were in the village,
the dates his research assistant Jocelyn
Liu left Xing-cha and the date of his
marriage to his new Taiwanese wife,
Huiwa.

But /hao said later that Mosher
"became offensive. Not only did he
repudiate the admission of his illegal
travel which he had (previously) ad
mitted. but he turned around and sent
a cable to the Chinese department
concerned demanding that they admit
to being at fault."
Mosher said yesterday that he was
given official permission to travel
through Guizhou.
"1 had a written travel permit from
the Chinese security forces that I had
permission to travel through there,"
Mosher said.'i had no idea it was off
limits to foreigners. Had 1 known. I
wouldn't have gone.
"I think the reason I wasn't told was
because it was a secret," he said.
When he was stopped, Mosher said
he was told he could not leave the
province unless he signed a statement
admitting his error. Mosher said he

wrote a statement saying he did not do
any thing wrong, but the officials prob
ably let him go anyway because they
did not understand English well.
In another one of nine questions.
Kennedy asked about damage done to
Mosher's van which he brought into
Xing-cha village in December 1979.
"Was the \an damaged on or about
April 5, 1980? Was the van taken to
Canton at or about that time, and if so
by whom?" Kennedy asked.
Concerning another incident, Ken
nedy asked whether Mosher bought a
truck for the Brigade, an agricultural
collective organization, as was re
ported to the committee by his former
wife.
"She supplied a copy of a contract
of sale which she said was for that
truck, and a film of what she said was
that truck crossing the Chinese bor
der," Kennedy said.
Mosher said, "the allegations about
the truck are totally false."
Wright said the truck incident
"wasn't central" to the expulsion deci
sion.
"It was one of six to 10 episodes on
which there was some evidence
against Mr. Mosher and on which he
didn't present counter evidence,"
Wright said.
In another question, Kennedy asked
Mosher about bags he left at a consul
ate after being stopped for irspection
at the border.
"How many bags, and of what
description, did you leave there?"
Kennedy asked.
Kennedy also asked Mosher about
photographic equipment he brought
into China and equipment he
puchased while he was there.
"What photographic equipment did
you purchase with grant money;
where, when, and at what prices?"
Kennedy asked.
Three of the nine questions asked
Mosher to supply specific dates about
events, including the dates his former
wife was with him in Xing-cha. the
dates her parents were in the village,
the dates his research assistant Jocelyn
Liu left Xing-cha and the date of his
marriage to his new Taiwanese wife,
Huiwa.
University President Donald Kennedy told ex
pelled anthropology graduate student Stephen
Mosher in a letter sent Tuesday that he would
probably reconsider the expulsion if Mosher
supplied answers to specific questions about his ac
tivities in China.
Kennedy said that on the basis of the existing
evidence he supports last February's decision by
the Anthropology Department Ad Hoc Commit
tee to dismiss Mosher from the doctoral program
for illegal and unethical conduct.
Kennedy's questions to Mosher shed new light
on the Mosher case by mentioning six incidents in
C hina which apparently helped force his expulsion.
Both Mosher and the ad hoc committee have
refused to release the committee report. The com
mittee has said the report would endanger inno
cent people. Mosher said it contains libelous state
ments.
University officials decided to release the full
text of the letter yesterday after they learned Mos

her had given reporters highlights of the letter.
Kennedy said in the letter that he was moved to
reconsider the case partly because of information
received in a letter from a "Ms. Vaquer," a woman
who Mosher said has "cast serious doubt upon the
accuracy of my former spouse's (Maggie So) tes
timony." Mosher said Vaquer attended Stanford
and came forward independently in his defense.
So, who was married to Mosher at the time of his
research and who had relatives in the Xing-cha vil
lage where Mosher stayed, supplied much of the
evidence against him during the ad hoc committee
investigation. Mosher has said that she threatened
to destroy him professionally if he went ahead with
a planned divorce.
Many of Kennedy's questions asked Mosher to
refute evidence presented earlier by So.
"On the basis of the existing record, I would find
that the proper facts and considerations were
taken into account, and do support the decision.
But I do not want to ignore the import of the letter
from Ms. Vaquer," Kennedy said in the letter.
"Therefore, ... I wish to give you the opportunity

to supplement the record, even at this final phase
of proceedings."
Kennedy continued, "If your answers, together
with any other information I may receive, seem to
me to add significantly to the evidence that was
before the ad hoc committee, I shall consider by
what means it can best be taken into account. My
current inclination would be to refer the matter
back to the ad hoc committee for limited recon
sideration."
The University has come under widespread
criticism from academics and major newspapers
for its refusal to release the details of the decision
to expel Mosher.
Mosher said he was disappointed that Kennedy
reopened the case rather than issuing a decision.
Mosher has appealed his case up through the aca
demic hierarchy, leaving Kennedy's ruling as the
last hope. Mosher yesterday repeated his threat
that he would sue the University if he is not
reinstated.

Stephen Mosher may have his expulsion reconsidered.
Mosher said he would answer Ken
nedy's questions fully even though he
had already supplied the information.
"All of those things I have discussed
in great detail with the faculty. I cer
tainly don't understand what the pur
pose of this process is," he said.
Mosher also repeated his charge
that he was expelled because of pres
sure from Chinese officials angry
about a Taiwan magazine article he
wrote documenting forced abortions
in China.
"I was doomed when 1 reported on
the Chinese birth control. The
Chinese sent a confidential letter to
Stanford demanding that I be dis
missed," he said.
University officials repeated their
charge that Mosher was expelled be
cause of his unethical conduct in
China and his unwillingness to supply
the University with information.
Emeritus Histroy Prof. Gordon
Wright, one of three prominent
scholars who reviewed the investigat
ing committee's report last year, said
yesterday, "If he had answered our
questions with full explanations of
what he had done, instead of saying
it's all false, then I think he might have
come out fairly well.
"He presented some partial state
ments, but virtually no evidence to
support his statements. And while at
least some of the evidence presented
against him was partial and potentially
Hawed, it was material," Wright said.
Kennedy said in his letter, "you
have not in fact responded to those
statements (of others) except with a
blanket denial of all adverse state
ments."
Mosher denied this charge, saying,
"This is a post-hoc rationalization.
You do not ruin someone's career be
cause he was impolite. You have to
have substantive grounds.
Mosher objected to Kennedy's sug
gestion that the matter be returned to
the 19-member ad hoc committee.
"You cannot send the issue back to
them. This is the committee that ruled

against me It's ridiculous to even con
sider it."he said.
Mosher also said the University's
release of the name of the village
where he stayed was "unforgivable."
Mosher had previously only identified
Xing-cha as a village near the Pearl
River Delta.
"B\ giving details about the village
where I did my research they are
jeopardizing my research informants."
he said.
Mosher's recently published first
book, "Broken Earth.'' describes the
difficult life of peasants in the
Guangdong area where he did his re
search.
Kennedy's questions twice mention
Mosher's trip through the Guizhou
province where he was stopped and
detained because the area was off
limits to foreigners. Kennedy asked
about the type of vehicle he was
driv ing and where he got it. Kennedy
also asked whether Mosher
apologized to the Chinese security
forces after he was stopped.
In a Nov .21, 1981 letter to Anthro
pology Prof. Jane Collier, head of the
ad hoc committee, /.hao Fusan of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
said Mosher complied with authori
ties' request that he sign a formal
statement admitting his error and that
he suspend his trip.
But /hao said later that Mosher
"became offensive. Not only did he
