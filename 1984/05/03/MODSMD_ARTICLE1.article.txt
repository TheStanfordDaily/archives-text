# Mosher case may be reopened
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
University President Donald Kennedy told ex
pelled anthropology graduate student Stephen
Mosher in a letter sent Tuesday that he would
probably reconsider the expulsion if Mosher
supplied answers to specific questions about his ac
tivities in China.
Kennedy said that on the basis of the existing
evidence he supports last February's decision by
the Anthropology Department Ad Hoc Commit
tee to dismiss Mosher from the doctoral program
for illegal and unethical conduct.
Kennedy's questions to Mosher shed new light
on the Mosher case by mentioning six incidents in
C hina which apparently helped force his expulsion.
Both Mosher and the ad hoc committee have
refused to release the committee report. The com
mittee has said the report would endanger inno
cent people. Mosher said it contains libelous state
ments.
University officials decided to release the full
text of the letter yesterday after they learned Mos

her had given reporters highlights of the letter.
Kennedy said in the letter that he was moved to
reconsider the case partly because of information
received in a letter from a "Ms. Vaquer," a woman
who Mosher said has "cast serious doubt upon the
accuracy of my former spouse's (Maggie So) tes
timony." Mosher said Vaquer attended Stanford
and came forward independently in his defense.
So, who was married to Mosher at the time of his
research and who had relatives in the Xing-cha vil
lage where Mosher stayed, supplied much of the
evidence against him during the ad hoc committee
investigation. Mosher has said that she threatened
to destroy him professionally if he went ahead with
a planned divorce.
Many of Kennedy's questions asked Mosher to
refute evidence presented earlier by So.
"On the basis of the existing record, I would find
that the proper facts and considerations were
taken into account, and do support the decision.
But I do not want to ignore the import of the letter
from Ms. Vaquer," Kennedy said in the letter.
"Therefore, ... I wish to give you the opportunity

to supplement the record, even at this final phase
of proceedings."
Kennedy continued, "If your answers, together
with any other information I may receive, seem to
me to add significantly to the evidence that was
before the ad hoc committee, I shall consider by
what means it can best be taken into account. My
current inclination would be to refer the matter
back to the ad hoc committee for limited recon
sideration."
The University has come under widespread
criticism from academics and major newspapers
for its refusal to release the details of the decision
to expel Mosher.
Mosher said he was disappointed that Kennedy
reopened the case rather than issuing a decision.
Mosher has appealed his case up through the aca
demic hierarchy, leaving Kennedy's ruling as the
last hope. Mosher yesterday repeated his threat
that he would sue the University if he is not
reinstated.
