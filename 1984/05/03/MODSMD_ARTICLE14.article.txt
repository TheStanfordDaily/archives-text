As President Reagan returns to the White
House this week after his six-day trip to China,
the debate begins over the results of his meetings
with the Communist leaders. While the mission
appeared to be mostly a political plov aside from
some minor economic and cultural agreements
that were signed, we congratulate the President
for simply making the trip. We are relieved that
he has finally agreed to visit and talk to commu
nists, and we hope the China trip marks the first
of many negotiations with leaders from through
out the world.
Since the beginning of his political career,
Reagan has had little love for mainland China. He
was skeptical about Richard Nixon's historic visit
in 1972, and he blasted Jimmy Carter's establish
ment of diplomatic relations in 1979. He has
remained a staunch friend of Taiwan, and has of
ten offended the mainland with his refusal to
break any agreements with America's long-term
ally. Moreover, as the world's largest communist
country, China has been viewed by Reagan as
part of the "evil" system threatening the West.
Whether Reagan is still as leery of China is un
clear, but his trip can only improve relations be
tween the two countries. The visit showed respect
and appreciation for China, helped reinforce the
ties made by previous administrations and above
all else allowed for face-to-face meetings between

two of the world's most powerful leaders. Said
one of those leaders, Deng Xiaoping: "The most
important progress is that I met the President the
first time."
Of course, Reagan had his own reasons for
meeting Deng. The president used the talks to
describe his fear of Russia and to try to convince
the Chinese that our countries together can pro
vide a strong deterrence to Soviet aggression.
Reagan's trip would have been more effective
had he followed Nixon's 1972 example and
scheduled a meeting with the Soviet Union to fol
low his meeting with the Chinese. Rather than
only try to make a twosome with China, Nixon
was able to position the United States with both
communist powers by opening up communica
tion. Reagan's rhetoric makes a Russian trip
unlikely, but maybe the administration is finally
learning.
There are lots of countries that do not agree
with our philosophy of government, but it does
not help the United States or the world tor the
president to criticize all but our friends. Perhaps
our policies would be more sensible il Reagan
made an effort to learn about and visit countries
like Nicaragua, Lebanon and the Soviet Union.
The China trip could go down as no more than a
re-election campaign photo opportunity, but
hopefully it will also mark the start of the re
education of Ronald Reagan.
