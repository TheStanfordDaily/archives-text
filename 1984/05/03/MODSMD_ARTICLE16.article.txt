# Good health-it's a few vitamin C tablets away
## 
### 
Most of us arc all too familiar with the virus
that manifests itself as the common cold.
Many have made the feverish trip to Cowcll in
search of sympathy and relief only to be
turned away: The cold-sufferer's symptoms
are not severe enough for treatment — or
sympathy. The nurse's advice to the ailing
relays little comfort: "Rest and drink plenty of
fluids."
If one is lucky enough to sneak past the
diagnostic questionnaire and see a doctor, one
receives similar helpful advice: "Take a
couple of days off and relax." Appropriate
response to helpful advice from M.D.: "I've
never heard about that treatment before. Who
discovered it? Your grandmother or mine?"
Listening to a doctor tell you how you feel
when you've got a cold is also quite helpful:
"The thermometer says your temperature is
only 99. You can't feel that bad." I know how
I would like to answer that one.
Most people average three colds a year.
Though each person's symptoms differ a bit.
that amounts to between nine and 30 days
every vear of coughing and sneezing, scratchy

throat, runny nose and, of course, that in
capacitating feeling of general misery.
Trips to the doctor for relief are for the
most part fruitless. Paying a $30 fee gets one
little more than a tedious restatement of the
500-year-old "ride it out" treatment. Almost
as useless are the purchases of over-advertised
and overrated over-the-counter cold
"symptom suppressors." Most of us end up
struggling on with our daily activities, maybe
sleeping a bit more, drinking some orange
juice or taking some aspirin.
Conclusions from the above? Colds are
miserable. They snatch away too much of our
productive time and ruin our vacations. We'd
love to avoid them. The $64 Question is:
"How can we?"
Those who subscribe to the doctrine
propounded by most American doctors have
been conditioned to think it futile to attempt
to avoid any illness — especially a cold. The
tacit professional recommendation is to con
tract a disease, then proceed quickly to the
doctor's office for prompt treatment — fol
lowed. of course, by prompt payment.

Those who watch television or read
magazines and newspapers have been condi
tioned. too — this time by pharmaceutical
manufacturers. We've been taught to wonder
not if a symptom-suppressant chock-full of
chemicals is necessary, but which product is
best. It is taken for granted that we need some
sort of drug for a cold. Advertisers simply tell
us which one to buy.
Though most physicians and pharmaceuti
cal companies seem to think otherwise, a suc
cessful treatment for the common cold that
has been verified in numerous documented
controlled studies has existed since 1928. As a
preventative substance taken regularly, it has
reduced by 40 percent the incidence of the
common cold and has been proven effective in
arresting a cold's progress at the onset of
symptoms. This extraordinary substance is as
corbic acid — ordinary vitamin C.
The Food and Drug Administration recom
mends 45 milligrams of vitamin C per day to
remain healthy. Certainly this dosage is
enough to ward off scurvy, but large and daily

doses of vitamin C can do much more than
prevent one's teeth from falling out. Linus
Pauling, two-time Nobel Prize winner and au
thority on vitamin C, recommends for most
people one to two grams of vitamin C per day
to reduce the chances of catching a cold — by
40 percent. His recommendations are based
on hard experimental evidence gathered by
researchers since the 1930s and by Pauling
himself, as evidenced in his "Vitamin C, the
Common Cold and the Flu" (Berkeley, 19N1)
— a book which should be required reading.
Many myths surround the use of vitamin C.
Critics have charged that it causes kidney
stones, and that intake above 1 50 mg. per day
is simply excreted in the urine. They seem to
ignore experimental evidence to the contrary.
There has never been a case of a kidney stone
caused by ingestion of ascorbic acid.
Moreover, numerous studies show that reten
tion of ascorbic acid in the blood stream con
tinues to 30 mg. per liter of blood with high
doses — far.past the 15 mg. per liter achieved
with the ingestion of 150 mg. per day.

Critics who make these unsupported allega
tions most often are doctors who arc simply
ignorant of research.
The journals on which doctors depend are
reluctant to publish findings about vitamin C.
Publishers have come under pressure from
pharmaceutical advertisers unhappy with the
prospect of published research evidence of as
corbic acids effectiveness, [heir apprehen
sion is understandable: Having spent millions
of dollars on developing and marketing prod
ucts like Contac and Comtrex, they fear lor
their livelihood.
Each one of us is only a few tablets of ascor
bic acid away from avoiding 40 percent of all
colds, despite erroneous accusations by
physicians and drug manufacturers possessed
by ignorance and self-interest. The evidence
collected by Linus Pauling is plain ;ind clear
for those lawmen and professionals who wish
to seek it out.

"The thermometer says your temperature is
only 99. You can't feel that bad." I know how
I would like to answer that one.
Most people average three colds a year.
Though each person's symptoms differ a bit.
that amounts to between nine and 30 days
every vear of coughing and sneezing, scratchy

throat, runny nose and, of course, that in
capacitating feeling of general misery.
Trips to the doctor for relief are for the
most part fruitless. Paying a $30 fee gets one
little more than a tedious restatement of the
500-year-old "ride it out" treatment. Almost
as useless are the purchases of over-advertised
and overrated over-the-counter cold
"symptom suppressors." Most of us end up
struggling on with our daily activities, maybe
sleeping a bit more, drinking some orange
juice or taking some aspirin.
Conclusions from the above? Colds are
miserable. They snatch away too much of our
productive time and ruin our vacations. We'd
love to avoid them. The $64 Question is:
"How can we?"
Those who subscribe to the doctrine
propounded by most American doctors have
been conditioned to think it futile to attempt
to avoid any illness — especially a cold. The
tacit professional recommendation is to con
tract a disease, then proceed quickly to the
doctor's office for prompt treatment — fol
lowed. of course, by prompt payment.

Those who watch television or read
magazines and newspapers have been condi
tioned. too — this time by pharmaceutical
manufacturers. We've been taught to wonder
not if a symptom-suppressant chock-full of
chemicals is necessary, but which product is
best. It is taken for granted that we need some
sort of drug for a cold. Advertisers simply tell
us which one to buy.
Though most physicians and pharmaceuti
cal companies seem to think otherwise, a suc
cessful treatment for the common cold that
has been verified in numerous documented
controlled studies has existed since 1928. As a
preventative substance taken regularly, it has
reduced by 40 percent the incidence of the
common cold and has been proven effective in
arresting a cold's progress at the onset of
symptoms. This extraordinary substance is as
corbic acid — ordinary vitamin C.
The Food and Drug Administration recom
mends 45 milligrams of vitamin C per day to
remain healthy. Certainly this dosage is
enough to ward off scurvy, but large and daily

doses of vitamin C can do much more than
prevent one's teeth from falling out. Linus
Pauling, two-time Nobel Prize winner and au
thority on vitamin C, recommends for most
people one to two grams of vitamin C per day
to reduce the chances of catching a cold — by
40 percent. His recommendations are based
on hard experimental evidence gathered by
researchers since the 1930s and by Pauling
himself, as evidenced in his "Vitamin C, the
Common Cold and the Flu" (Berkeley, 19N1)
— a book which should be required reading.
Many myths surround the use of vitamin C.
Critics have charged that it causes kidney
stones, and that intake above 1 50 mg. per day
is simply excreted in the urine. They seem to
ignore experimental evidence to the contrary.
There has never been a case of a kidney stone
caused by ingestion of ascorbic acid.
Moreover, numerous studies show that reten
tion of ascorbic acid in the blood stream con
tinues to 30 mg. per liter of blood with high
doses — far.past the 15 mg. per liter achieved
with the ingestion of 150 mg. per day.

Critics who make these unsupported allega
tions most often are doctors who arc simply
ignorant of research.
The journals on which doctors depend are
reluctant to publish findings about vitamin C.
Publishers have come under pressure from
pharmaceutical advertisers unhappy with the
prospect of published research evidence of as
corbic acids effectiveness, [heir apprehen
sion is understandable: Having spent millions
of dollars on developing and marketing prod
ucts like Contac and Comtrex, they fear lor
their livelihood.
Each one of us is only a few tablets of ascor
bic acid away from avoiding 40 percent of all
colds, despite erroneous accusations by
physicians and drug manufacturers possessed
by ignorance and self-interest. The evidence
collected by Linus Pauling is plain ;ind clear
for those lawmen and professionals who wish
to seek it out.
