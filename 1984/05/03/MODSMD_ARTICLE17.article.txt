## Nicaraguan viewpoint invokes image of Commander Zero 
### 
Once again we have been treated to the wisdom, pater
nalism. self-righteousness and, regretfully for some, I imag
ine, the verisimilitude of a Robert Larkins viewpoint. This
time we were supposed to be convinced that the ClA
directed mining of Nicaraguan harbors is not only in the
best interests of the United States, but that it is also a

VIEWPOINT

"golden opportunity for redemption" now that the
"revolution has gone sour." The intrepid leader who will
take advantage of this opportunity is Eden Pastora, com
monly known as Commander Zero â€” an all-too-fitting
alias. Robert Larkins' viewpoint, "Mining Nicaraguan har
bors is in our best interests" (Daily. April 25). is saturated
with unsubstantiated and unsupportable statements he
would like us to ingest as indubitable facts.
From the outset, his lambasting of several Democratic
congressmen and senators unveils his propensity to treat
issues in a Democrat-Republican framework which is
precisely of what he accuses the Democrats. From there he

proceeds to regurgitate the administration's stale line con
cerning Central America. Although there is an element of
politicking in the Democrats' uproar over the mining issue.
1 dispute that it is because they "know they cant beat
Reagan on domestic issues." Reagan's domestic record is
far from impeccable and from receiving resounding unani
mous support. I do not want to be misconstrued to be un
reservedly supporting the Democrats because this issue
ought to transcend partisan politics.
The most disturbing aspects of Larkins' viewpoint are
the narrow interpretation of Nicaragua's and El Salvador's
situation and the inconsistent application of international law
and the lessons derived from Vietnam, or apparent lack
thereof. Sandini'sta Nicaragua is characterized in contrast
to that of Somoza who "had no ambitions to dominate his
neighbors." The implication is that now Nicaragua has im
perial ambitions, but war-torn Nicaragua is hardly in a po
sition to dominate its neighbors.
The image of one Commander Zero is conjured up as
one who with his fun-loving band of contras is the last
hope for rescuing the revolution in Nicaragua and com

pletely worthy of our military, financial and moral support.
It is instructive to he reminded that it is a violation of in
ternational law to train guerrillas in a state outside that
which they will return to fight and to stimulate guerrilla ac
tivity abroad. If it is illegal for Nicaragua to back rebels in
El Salvador, then surely it is equally illegal for the United
States to back rebels in Nicaragua. Yet. apparently for
Larkins and many others the principle of law at stake is not
to be applied evenly throughout Central America.
The condition that legitimizes this selective application
of international law is that in El Salvador indigenous
struggle is a myth. The Salvadoran guerrillas need a coun
terpart of Commander Zero and then they would have a
truly indigenous struggle. Their own history is not suffici
ent. The recognition of the ethereal quality of indigenous
struggle in El Salvador, but not in Nicaragua, is one of the
lessons we should have come away with from Vietnam.
Were there by some chance two wars in Vietnam from
which two discordant sets of lessons were drawn?
In response to the conclusion that "we arc soon going to
find that we don't have any friends left in this very hostile

world," I would agree. But this would not be due to our
lack of support for allies, but rather Ironi choosing the wiong
allies. The United States seems to be stuck in the 1950s
where might makes right, and the world was wrongly, al
though understandably, perceived exclusively in rigid
U.S.-Soviet terms with a monolithic world communist
movement being directed from the Kremlin. It is past time
that the United States updated or jetisoned such
anachronistic and unsophisticated proclivities that con
tinue to be the misleading analytic basis tor its policies.
Finally, I would like to inquire where the United States
gets off deciding for Nicaragua and El Salvador from a dis
tant and biased perspective what type of government they
ought to have? And then proceeding to implement policies
with that end in mind? There may be a tremendous
amount at stake in Nicaragua and El Salvador, but the
United States occupies a very paranoid, pernicious and
self-centered position by ultimately couching the issues in
terms of U.S. national security.
