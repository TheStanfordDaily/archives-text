## Meese worthy as attorney general 
### 
In the editorial "Too close for comfort" (Daily,
April 5), there were a few statements made on
which we would like to comment. We have
reprinted those parts with which we have particu
lar complaints for those unfamiliar with the details
of the editorial. Since the editorial revolved

VIEWPOINT

around the nomination of Edwin Meese for attor
ney general, our response concerns comments as
they pertain to Meese specifically.
"Upon appointment to any office... the rela
tionship between the president and the friend must
change. No longer are they simply buddies; the fun
damental nexus of their relationship is now em
ployer /employee. Both the president and the ap
pointee must now realize the president's primary re
sponsibility is no longer to the friendship, but to the
duties of the presidency and the administration o)
this nation."
That is rather absurd. President Reagan has
trusted Meese with issues crucial to this country's
existence. The writer of the editorial overlooked
the fact that Meese has been working for the presi
dent over the past 17 years. They have had a well
established employer employee relationship, along
with their friendship, lor quite a long time.
"... Reagan continues to defend . . . appointees
long past their effectiveness in his administration.
This trend must eventually cast shadows on the
president."
Who is to decide on someone's eftectiveness in
an administration? Certainly, neither we nor the
writer of this editorial are qualified to make such a
judgment without firsthand knowledge ot the com

plicatcd. inner workings of a presidential adminis
tration. It seems rather obvious that the writer
already had "shadows" casted on President
Reagan in his mind. If the writer does not like the
president, then he should write about him directly
and not try to attack him indirectly by smearing
Meese.
"The attorney general, as the highest law enforce
rnent official in the country, must he completely
above reproach if he or she is to carry out the re
sponsibilities of the office effectively and com
petently."

The president did not blindly
nominate Meese as just some
personal favor. Edwin Meese, as
nearly an ideological alter ego
of Reagan, is the perfect choice
to represent the president's
positions on legal matters in
government.

Besides using "effectively" once again, this
writer decided not to support his assertions with
facts or evidence. He has decided, however, practi
cally to convict Meese without even waiting tor
the results of the investigation. Innuendo and cir
cumstantial evidence are not means by which to

pass judgment on someone or determine whether
he is above reproach or not. Also, on the question
of reproach, the Democratic Party has been using
Meese in commercials against Reagan as it Meese
had been convicted for influence peddling. Such
libelous statements seem very reproachful. The
possibility that this whole controversy is just a
libelous smear campaign against the Reagan ad
ministration through Meese is not considered by
the writer of the editorial because he has an estab
lished bias against Reagan and his administration.
"Given this set of circumstances, it is incon
ceivable that Reagan does not realize Meese's in
ability to function effectively as attorney general."
Once again, who is this writer to judge what is
effective, and even more, what the president con
siders effective? The fact is that Reagan considers
Meese to be a highly effective and competent
public servant, despite those very dubious
"circumstances" surrounding the controversy.
"The president must straighten out his priorities
and put his service to the public above his service to
a friend. Meese's nomination should be
withdrawn."
The president did not blindly nominate Meese as
just some personal favor. Edwin Meese, as nearly
an ideological alter ego of Reagan, is the perfect
choice to represent the president's positions on le
gal matters in the government. So why should the
president withdraw the nomination when he
believes that Meese is the right man for the job and
that lie is just being attacked as an election-year
political ploy? President Reagan should not
withdraw the nomination.
