# Task force weighs future role for Greek system on campus
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The University Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities plans to prepare preliminary recommendations
tomorrow, to be released early next week, "encouraging
or discouraging fraternal organizations at Stanford," ac
cording to task force member Su Uhland.
The committee will offer its formal recommendation to
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons on June 1, task force
Chairman Oscar Serbein said.
Serbein, professor at the Graduate School of Business,
said yesterday that the committee was "not close to
making a decision" but intended to "consider the full
range of options" this month.
Those options have been narrowed to five, according to
the April 12 and April 19 minutes, which the task force
recently released.
Two of the alternatives propose a "lodge system" in
which the University would provide facilities rather than
housing for at least some fraternal organizations.
Two other alternatives are less appealing to backers of
the current Greek system here.
The five options are:
• maintain and extend the status quo;
• add the lodge system to the current one, in which some
but not all fraternities are housed:
•replace the current system with a lodge system that
would extend to new groups;
• stop housing fraternities and not designate any special
facilities for fraternal functions;

• prohibit fraternal organizations on campus, with or with
out University recognition.
A central issue the task force has considered in detail is
whether subjectively selective groups should control stu
dent access to University housing.
In the 10 meetings to date, the committee has listened to
presentations from many University officials and read
numerous documents and letters concerning the advan
tages and disadvantages of the Greek system at Stanford.
"Lots of fact-finding," Uhland said. "This is the best
group of this kind I've ever seen. Dean Lyons did a great
job putting the committee together."
According to the minutes, Lyons told the committee
members they need not limit their recommendations to
eliminating fraternity housing. He said, however, that ban
ning fraternities was a viable option.
The committee has expressed concern that fraternities
are housed whereas sororities are not, and that the current
status of fraternity access to University resources favors
white males.
"I think we're headed toward (recommending) a system
which will rectify the inequality," Uhland said. "We will
probably recommend either access to resources, which in
clude housing and many Stanford facilities, for all groups
or no access to resources for them."
Some committee members said they could not predict
what the task force will conclude tomorrow. "It's hard to
judge," said task force member Bruce Parker, professor of
Radiology and Pediatrics. "We didn't know until today
(Wednesday) that we would be making recommendations
this soon."
