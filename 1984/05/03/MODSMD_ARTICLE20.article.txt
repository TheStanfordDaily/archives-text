## Netters take Waves for a ride 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
Before the Stanford men's tennis team
took on No. 4-ranked Pepperdine yester
day, Head Coach Dick Gould said the team
would have to play at its best to win. It did,
and host Stanford cruised to a 6-3 win and
maintained a firm hold on its No. 3 ranking.
I he victory pushed the Cardinal's record to
18-5.
I he singles play, which has been the
team s main strength, was again outstand
ing. By winning five of the six singles
matches, the Cardinal clinched victory
before the doubles matches even began.
I his accomplishment was rather impres
sive, considering that several of the Waves'
players arc professionally ranked. Also, in a
recent match against UCLA, Pepperdine's
three wins on the singles courts carried the
team to a 5-4 victory.
But yesterday, it was the Cardinal that
dominated singles play. Stanford sopho
more Dan Goldie got on track early on the
No. 1 court and beat Jerome Jones easily, 6-
2, 6-3. The Cardinal's No. 5 man, Derrick
Rostagno, was also able to defeat his op

ponent in straight sets, 6-1, 7-5.
The rest of the matches went down to the
wire. Eric Rosenfeld split the first two sets
with Pepperdine's Dani Leal 6-3, 3-6. Leal,
who is a back court player, has tremendous
speed and was able to run down a plethora
of Rosenfeld's shots. Still, Rosenfeld was
able to put enough out of reach to take the
final set 7-5.
"Eric did a great job staying in the
game," Gould said. "Eric had to pressure
him but he couldn't force it. He had to stay
up at the net even though he might get
passed once in a while."
Stanford's team captain Mark McKeen's
match against nationally ranked Rill Baxter
was also very close. In the third set, neither
player could break the other's serve until
Baxter finally did in the 11th game to make
the score 5-6.
But even down two match points,
McKeen was able to battle back and get a
break of his own. By winning the tie
breaker, he recorded a 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 win and
locked up a victory for the Cardinal.
" I was really pleased with our singles per

formance today. To win in the singles
against those guys (Pepperdine) is really a
great accomplishment," Gould said.
In doubles, the Cardinal was not quite as
successful. The top pair for Stanford, Jim
Grabb and John Letts, were defeated by
Jones and Kelly Jones 6-2, 6-3. Rosenfeld
and Goldie played a very close match, but
came up short against Baxter and Nagel 6-2,
2-6, 6-3. Only the No. 3 team for Stanford
was able to score a win as McKeen and Ros
tagno teamed up to beat Leal and Carlos
Dilaura 6-4, 7-6.
"I was sort of disappointed that we didn't
win two of the three doubles matches,"
Gould said. "Today we were a little flat and
we can't afford to be less than 100 percent
ready if we're going to win. I think we need
to get a good solid effort against Cal and
then we'll be ready for nationals."
The Cardinal will play its last dual match
against Cal on Friday afternoon at the Var
sity Courts at 1:30 p.m., followed by a
mixed men's and women's match on Satur
day night in Maples Pavilion. The indoor
match is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m.


Captain Mark McKeen was one of two Cardinal players to
sweep his matches yesterday. After winning narrowly in

loss Geiduschek/Daily
singles, McKeen teamed with straight-sets winner Derrick
Rostagno to win their doubles match over Pepperdine.
