# Golfers finish crucial second
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
Stanford Golf Coach Tim
Schaaf and his six starting
players have seen this movie
before.
Last year at this time, the
Cardinal men's team was
fighting for one of the final
bids to the NCAA tourna
ment and went into the
Pacific-10 Championships
knowing it would have to put
on an impressive perfor
mance in order to secure a
berth.
It responded to the chal
lenge with four rounds of
well-played golf and a strong
third-place finish in the
tournament. Everyone con
nected with the Stanford
team felt it had earned an in
vitation to the NCAA tourn
ament.
However, the invitation
never came. Schaaf and his
players were understandably
angry and disappointed, and
the memory of the snub has,
according to Schaaf, pro
vided a "definite inspiration"
for his returning players.
But when May rolled
around this year, Stanford
again found itself heading
into the Pac-10 Champion
ships locked in a struggle for
an NCAA bid, needing a
strong showing to sufficiently
impress the NCAA selection
committee. And once again,
the Cardinal reacted by
playing some of its finest golf
of the season.
Aided by strong contribu
tions from all its players,
Stanford jumped ahead to
lead the tournament after
two rounds, and stood in
second place, three shots be
hind Arizona after three
rounds. When the final
results were posted yester
day, the Cardinal had held
on for a very respectable
second-place finish.
"Of course, we were dis
appointed not to win," said
Schaaf afterwards. He
added, nevertheless, that he
was "really pleased" with his
team's play, and was

guardedly optimistic about
the Cardinal's chances for an
NCAA berth. "I'm pretty
confident," he said. "We
beat the teams we had to
beat."
The winner of the Pac-10
Tournament, and of an auto
matic NCAA bid which ac
companies the champion
ship, was powerful USC. The

Trojans fired a stunning 10-
under-par round of 350 on
the final day to finish at
1421, 16 strokes ahead of
Stanford's total of 1437.
Host team Arizona, Stan
ford's toughest challenger for
an NCAA invitation, just
missed beating out the Car
dinal for second place.

Senior Doug Thompson led the Cardinal to a close
second-place finish with a two-under-par, ninth-place
individual performance.
