# Draft ends on curious note
## 
### 
New York (AP) — If the National Football
League dratt that ended just before 3 a.m. yester
day looked pretty much the same as ever, that's
because it was. But only on the surface.
I here were the usual bubbly pronouncements
from coaches and general managers about the
magnificent abilities of their draftees.
I here were the usual curiosities — sprinter Carl
Lewis dratted by Dallas with the third-from-last
pick; a former Toronto Blue Jays' baseball
farmhand named Jay Schroeder, chosen by Wash
ington on the third round as a quarterback; a
linebacker named Jimmie Carter taken by
Detroit, and a tackle named Byron Nelson chosen
by New Orleans; a cry of "Akeem Olajuwon"
from the gallery when it was the New York
Giants' turn to pick.
But in this year ot escalating war with the
United States Football League, there were some
just-below-the surface differences beyond the ob
vious — the USFl.'s signing of glamour players
like Mike Rozier, Steve Young and Reggie White
diluted the draft and forced the NFL to virtually
ignore quarterbacks and running backs and go
primarily for defense, particularly in the critical
first two rounds.
F-or one thing. NFL, teams expecting post-draft
USFL raids went to some lengths to make sure
they could sign the players they drafted.
Because of rumors that he was asking about $1
million a year or was committed to the USFL's
Tampa Bay Bandits, Florida linebacker Wilber
Marshall lasted until the 11th pick of the first
round, when he was taken by the Chicago Bears.
Marshall denounced the rumors as untrue and im
mediately began negotiating with the Bears.
There also were moves suggesting that NFL

teams have learned some things from the
flexibility of the USFL, which allows any team
that thinks it can sign a player to negotiate with
him regardless of who holds his rights.
The Dallas Cowboys, for example, used the
26th pick on the fourth round to pick Steve
DeOssie, a Boston College linebacker who was a
first-round pick of the USFl.'s New Jersey
Generals. Then the Cowboys announced they had
signed him, something they couldn't have done
had they not negotiated with him beforehand.
Then there was the trade in which the
Cleveland Browns gave the Chicago Bears their
last four picks in return for all three Bears' picks
in the supplemental draft next month, when NFL
teams will pick the members of the Class of '84
who have signed with the USFL.
One NFL source suggested that the trade
stemmed from the desire of Art Modell, the
Browns' aggressive owner, to get into a direct bid
ding war with the USFL. The Bears, the source
suggested, were not so inclined.
As for the draft itself, some winners appeared
to be the New York Giants and Jets, Cincinnati
Bengals, New England Patriots, the Bears and the
Cowboys. The Los Angeles Rams also appeared
to do well, despite being without a pick until the
fifth round.
The Rams went for immediate help, giving up a
first and a fifth choice for defensive back Gary
Green of Kansas City, a three-time All-Pro. Ear
lier, they had surrendered their second pick for
the rights to Ron Brown, the world-class sprinter
who declined to sign with the Browns last year
after being drafted in the second round.
