## British "Greek" best left over the ocean 
### MIKE HALE 
British playwright Steven Berkoff has
called himself the latest of the "angry young
men.'' Taking him at his own word, it's in
teresting to compare "Greek" — Berkoffs
recasting of the Oedipus myth in London's
East End, which recently had a six-day run
in San Francisco — with one of the angry
young men's classics, John Osborne's "The
Entertainer." Osborne used the decline of
the British music hall as a symbol of Brit
ain's own decline; Berkoff attacks the same
theme in a music-hall spirit, with music-hall
methods, and his play — which he wants to
be angry and satirical — is sentimental and
deadening as a result.
"Greek" actually looks like two or three
different plays violently .joined together,
and lacquered over with the aforemen
tioned music-hall-comedy gloss. It takes
place on a white stage bare except for a
dinette set, and the actors (dressed all in
black, white, gray and bright red) wear
white face. It follows the broad outlines of
the Oedipus plot — exile, patricide, incest,
plague, Sphinx, discovery, eyes out. So far
so good. But then the actors speak, and
what often comes out can only be described
as mock-Shakespearean, in effect if not in
intent. Berkoff has fought the good fight for

poetic drama, but he's not Yeats, or much
less Shakespeare. The dialogue is literate,
often witty; but when his characters rattle
along in loose pentameters spouting Os and
thousand didsts, it's sometimes hard not to
laugh. Then, in the face of these various
classicisms, the actors use a nervous, rapid
fire delivery and highly stylized, Broad
wayesque movements. It's as if a multi
media event were being carried on in only
one medium.
It's hard to say just what "Greek" is
about. Berkoff didn't know how to end it,
and the play's conclusion — a blind Eddie
(the Oedipus character) running back to a
Jocasta (known here only as Eddie's wife)
who may not be there — leaves us in doubt
as to whether we're getting a typical back
to-the-womb message or some more
apocalyptic statement about men and wo
men and so forth. Then there's a political
component to the play — a lot of ranting
about the terrible state of things in Britain,
most of which really seems to be an excuse
to lambaste the working class, the Irish and
women. Both dimensions — the tragic and
the social — are sabotaged by Berkoffs
habit of going for the easy laugh in too many
situations.
The people involved in "Greek" obvi

ously don't find it as dispiriting a project as I
did, because they carry on with great verve.
The San Francisco production (which was
presented at the Victoria Theatre) was the
same one that played for eight successful
months in Los Angeles, in its American
premiere, and one disastrous week in New
York. Berkoffs direction and Brian Bailey's
lighting design bring out the play's
strengths, its moments of humor and the
startling transitions Berkoff devises to make
up for his lack of plot.
There are some brilliant moments in the
staging — just when you're wondering how
Berkoff is going to get out of the ridiculous
Sphinx's speech scene, he changes the des
ert sands to the interior of a shop, and the
Sphinx to a customer therein, in an instant.
And the cast is exceptionally polished; they
achieve all of the play's surface effects, and
manage to skirt its absurdities. John H.
Francis is an athletic, assured Eddie; Neil
Elliot, as Eddie's father, overplays consis
tently but appropriately. The two women —
Jean Gilpin as Eddie's wife, Dinah Anne
Rogers as his mother — have much less to
do, and when they get a scene it's generally
of the female sex talk written from a male
point of view variety, and fairly embarrass
ing.
