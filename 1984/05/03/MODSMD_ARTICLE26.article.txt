# 'Swing Shift': a messed-up approach to promising material
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
There's a terrific movie in the
World War II home-front comedy
drama Swing Shift, but it's not up on
the screen. Goldie Hawn plays Kay, a
young housewife whose husband Jack
(Ed Harris) joins the navy after the at
tack on Pearl Harbor; feeling listless
and useless, she signs up for a job in a
war plant. The director, Jonathan
Demme, seems at his best when he
gives us a scene in which Kay and the
other new female employees — the
motliest troup of women since the
chorus girls in The Night They Raided
Minsky's — receive preliminary in
struction from an earnest,
premanently flushed man with Mr.
Spock ears who tells them that they
ought to settle easily into their jobs at
the plant because women are used to
repetitive tasks. A few minutes later
Charles Napier (who played the
cheerful, bigamous trucker in
Demme's Handle with Care) shows
up, masticating a whole pack of gum in
his massive square jaw, as an old fac
tory hand resentful of the women who
have invaded his realm, and we an
ticipate a series of face-offs between
him and Kay.
The subject matter — how full-time (
work changes these women, how they
meld into a team, how friendship
springs up among them and how it
resembles and differs from male
camaraderie, how they cope with the
jibes and jokes of the men who are
asked suddenly to see them as co
workers — has extraordinary poten
tial, especially considering the cast
(which also includes Kurt Russell and
Fred Ward) and Jonathan Denime's
record. (As well as Handle with Care
— a bustling, offbeat farce about CB
operators — he directed Melvin and
Howard, the best American comedy
of recent years, and the charming TV
short film Who Ant I This Time?, star
ring Christopher Walken as a
hilariously i 11-at-ease community
theater actor who turns into every
character he plays.)
But aside from a few sequences,
Swing Shift bypasses this terrific
theme and settles for a dumb, uncon

vincing story about a woman who
learns, in her husband's absence, that
she can fall in love with someone else
(Russell) and that the woman across
the street (Christine l.ahti). whom she
always considered sleazy and loose, is
really nice after all. It's a movie about
how unwise it is to judge someone by
her appearance, because she might
turn out to be your best friend.
The fairly widespread gossip about
the making of Swing Shift indicates
that Goldie Hawn ordered Demme to
cut scenes centered on Hazel (Lahti),
that she called Robert Towne in to
shoot part of it and his contributions
were cut, that Bo Goldman and Nancy
Dowd, the original screenwriters, took
their names off it.and that the
credited screenwriter, Rob Morton, is
a pseudonym (for Dowd).
Certainly, even if you hadn't heard
all of this behnd-the-scenes dirt, you'd
have no trouble perceiving that
something has been cut. The opening
scenes, until Kay and Hazel get work
on the swing shift (4 p.m. to midnight)
at the plant, zip by so quickly that you
think you're watching a slide show —
glowingly lit bv Demme's faithful
cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto —
and Hazel's relationship with Biscuits
(Fred Ward), the owner of the club
where she sings, makes no sense at all:
Poor Ward shows up once every half
hour to beg Hazel's forgiveness for his
infidelities or to ask her to marry him,
and we never understand how we're
supposed to respond to him. (We also
never find out what happened to
Hazel's singing career.) But the off
camera clash of egos doesn't account
for the peculiarly uninteresting focus
of the picture, and neither does the
participation of too many cooks; in
fact, one can only locate Bo
Goldman's fine hand (the hand that
penned Melvin and Howard and Shoot
the Moon) in two or three scenes —
notably one in which a teenage soldier
breaks sad news to one of the women
in the plant and grows embarrassed
when she weeps on his shoulder. The
central problem with the movie, as far
as I can make out, is Nancy Dowd.
Both of Dowd's major screenplays

prior to Swing Shift, the 1M76 hockey
picture Slap Slim and the much
praised 197N Coming Home, have
taken banal, schematic approaches to
promising material, and Swing Shift is
really just Coining Home set in an ear
lier war. L-ike Sally, the role Jane
Fonda played in Coming Home, Kay is
a conservative sit-at-home who dis
covers her strength — and a more ex
citing sex lite — when she joins the
work force, and like Sally, too, Kay
comes across more as an emblem of
the road to liberation than as a flesh
and-blood character. Clearly Dowd
fashions herself a feminist, but anyone
could have written the scene in which
Kay saves another woman (Lisa
Pelikan, another talented performer
whose part is not developed) from
being crushed by a falling object and
thus earns a promotion, and the rela
tionship between the two main female
characters, aside from the touches
Christine Lahti brings to it, is one of
those antique Hollywood bicker-and
reconcile numbers that surface every
few years — most recently in The
Turning Point and Rich and Famous.
(Anyone who believes Dowd's
feminist claims should take a look at
Slap Shot, in which Lindsay Crouse
cleans herself up and changes her
hairstyle so her man will notice her.)
Dowd's unnuanced writing doesn't
set off Demme's gift for layered
human comedy. No wonder he hated
working on this project; he seems
stranded through most of it. trying to
create the kind of movie Swing Shift
should have been out of bits and
snatches, like a kid trying to make a
giant cookie out of leftover scraps of
dough. To his credit, he maintains a
warm, friendly mood, and the heavily
populated plant scenes, designed by
Peter Jamison in subdued reds, whites
and blues (with the blue transformed
almost into khaki), are directed with
impressive facility; then, there are
some truly lyrical moments, like a shot
of a bus full of jamming jazz musicians
drifting through the nighttime
countryside. In brief, Demme
prevents Swing Shift from being a
painful experience, though it won't do

much for his reputation, because the
Virtues he displays here — tact,
restraint, the kind of control that
doesn't declare itself in ostentation —
are practically negative quanlities in a
movie so obviously wrongheaded and
messed-up.
In Coming Home, Jane Fonda
exposed the stringent limits of her role
by struggling like hell to turn Sally into
a human being. Goldie Hawn takes a
less courageous route — she recycles
Private Benjamin. Hawn is a delightful
comedienne, and she gave superb dra
matic performances in a pair of mid
-1970s films. The Sugar/and Express
and Shampoo, but her acting obtains a
worrisome cuteness here. Her face
tells us how proud Kay is of every step
she takes, as if she were a child learn
ing to read; she patronizes the charac
ter. She was right to be scared (if
indeed she was) that Christine Lahti
would take over the picture, because
in what remains of her role, Lahti

gives a much tougher, more emotion
ally vivid performance — though the
costumer, Joe Tompkins, could have
treated her more generously.
You can sense Lahti reaching for
more unusual effects — like the way
she smiles in anticipation of a crisis —
while Goldie Hawn settles. When Jack
returns on leave unexpectedly and
finds Kay partying with Hazel and
Lucky (Kurt Russell), who has
become Kay's lover, you wait for
Hawn to register the strangeness of
the encounter, but Ed Harris and Rus
sell do all the acting in this scene.
Ironically (and perhaps reveal
ingly), in Dowd's screenplays the men
make more of an impression than the
women: The showcase performances
in Slap Shot and Coming Home were
given by Paul Newman and Jon
Voight, and in Swing Shift you can't
keep your eyes off Russell and —
during his brief tenure in the plot —
Harris, who hits much more interest

ing low notes in the Bruce Dern role
than Dern himself did in Coming
Home. Based on the work he's done in
Used Cars, in the TV movie Elvis, in
Silkwood and in Swing Shift, Russell
never goes over the same ground; he
seems slighter and softer here than he
did in Silkwood. and his broad
shouldered strength in that film
(which practically held it together) has
given way to a different — more
tentative — sort of warmth. Unfortun
ately, Dowd writes him out of the
movie when Jack returns from the
war. but that's characteristic of her
style — she writes the whole movie out
of the movie.
Swing Shift is a mess, but you can
forgive Jonathan Demme for his part
of it (especially when you've seen his
Talking Heads concert film. Stop
Making Sense, which closed this year's
San Francisco Film Festival); Nancy
Dowd and Goldie Hawn don't squirm
off the hook so easily.

of the picture, and neither does the
participation of too many cooks; in
fact, one can only locate Bo
Goldman's fine hand (the hand that
penned Melvin and Howard and Shoot
the Moon) in two or three scenes —
notably one in which a teenage soldier
breaks sad news to one of the women
in the plant and grows embarrassed
when she weeps on his shoulder. The
central problem with the movie, as far
as I can make out, is Nancy Dowd.
Both of Dowd's major screenplays

prior to Swing Shift, the 1M76 hockey
picture Slap Slim and the much
praised 197N Coming Home, have
taken banal, schematic approaches to
promising material, and Swing Shift is
really just Coining Home set in an ear
lier war. L-ike Sally, the role Jane
Fonda played in Coming Home, Kay is
a conservative sit-at-home who dis
covers her strength — and a more ex
citing sex lite — when she joins the
work force, and like Sally, too, Kay
comes across more as an emblem of
the road to liberation than as a flesh
and-blood character. Clearly Dowd
fashions herself a feminist, but anyone
could have written the scene in which
Kay saves another woman (Lisa
Pelikan, another talented performer
whose part is not developed) from
being crushed by a falling object and
thus earns a promotion, and the rela
tionship between the two main female
characters, aside from the touches
Christine Lahti brings to it, is one of
those antique Hollywood bicker-and
reconcile numbers that surface every
few years — most recently in The
Turning Point and Rich and Famous.
(Anyone who believes Dowd's
feminist claims should take a look at
Slap Shot, in which Lindsay Crouse
cleans herself up and changes her
hairstyle so her man will notice her.)
Dowd's unnuanced writing doesn't
set off Demme's gift for layered
human comedy. No wonder he hated
working on this project; he seems
stranded through most of it. trying to
create the kind of movie Swing Shift
should have been out of bits and
snatches, like a kid trying to make a
giant cookie out of leftover scraps of
dough. To his credit, he maintains a
warm, friendly mood, and the heavily
populated plant scenes, designed by
Peter Jamison in subdued reds, whites
and blues (with the blue transformed
almost into khaki), are directed with
impressive facility; then, there are
some truly lyrical moments, like a shot
of a bus full of jamming jazz musicians
drifting through the nighttime
countryside. In brief, Demme
prevents Swing Shift from being a
painful experience, though it won't do

much for his reputation, because the
Virtues he displays here — tact,
restraint, the kind of control that
doesn't declare itself in ostentation —
are practically negative quanlities in a
movie so obviously wrongheaded and
messed-up.
In Coming Home, Jane Fonda
exposed the stringent limits of her role
by struggling like hell to turn Sally into
a human being. Goldie Hawn takes a
less courageous route — she recycles
Private Benjamin. Hawn is a delightful
comedienne, and she gave superb dra
matic performances in a pair of mid
-1970s films. The Sugar/and Express
and Shampoo, but her acting obtains a
worrisome cuteness here. Her face
tells us how proud Kay is of every step
she takes, as if she were a child learn
ing to read; she patronizes the charac
ter. She was right to be scared (if
indeed she was) that Christine Lahti
would take over the picture, because
in what remains of her role, Lahti

gives a much tougher, more emotion
ally vivid performance — though the
costumer, Joe Tompkins, could have
treated her more generously.
You can sense Lahti reaching for
more unusual effects — like the way
she smiles in anticipation of a crisis —
while Goldie Hawn settles. When Jack
returns on leave unexpectedly and
finds Kay partying with Hazel and
Lucky (Kurt Russell), who has
become Kay's lover, you wait for
Hawn to register the strangeness of
the encounter, but Ed Harris and Rus
sell do all the acting in this scene.
Ironically (and perhaps reveal
ingly), in Dowd's screenplays the men
make more of an impression than the
women: The showcase performances
in Slap Shot and Coming Home were
given by Paul Newman and Jon
Voight, and in Swing Shift you can't
keep your eyes off Russell and —
during his brief tenure in the plot —
Harris, who hits much more interest

ing low notes in the Bruce Dern role
than Dern himself did in Coming
Home. Based on the work he's done in
Used Cars, in the TV movie Elvis, in
Silkwood and in Swing Shift, Russell
never goes over the same ground; he
seems slighter and softer here than he
did in Silkwood. and his broad
shouldered strength in that film
(which practically held it together) has
given way to a different — more
tentative — sort of warmth. Unfortun
ately, Dowd writes him out of the
movie when Jack returns from the
war. but that's characteristic of her
style — she writes the whole movie out
of the movie.
Swing Shift is a mess, but you can
forgive Jonathan Demme for his part
of it (especially when you've seen his
Talking Heads concert film. Stop
Making Sense, which closed this year's
San Francisco Film Festival); Nancy
Dowd and Goldie Hawn don't squirm
off the hook so easily.


Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell star as Kay Walsh and Lucky Lockhart in "Swing Shift."
There's a terrific movie in the
World War II home-front comedy
drama Swing Shift, but it's not up on
the screen. Goldie Hawn plays Kay, a
young housewife whose husband Jack
(Ed Harris) joins the navy after the at
tack on Pearl Harbor; feeling listless
and useless, she signs up for a job in a
war plant. The director, Jonathan
Demme, seems at his best when he
gives us a scene in which Kay and the
other new female employees — the
motliest troup of women since the
chorus girls in The Night They Raided
Minsky's — receive preliminary in
struction from an earnest,
premanently flushed man with Mr.
Spock ears who tells them that they
ought to settle easily into their jobs at
the plant because women are used to
repetitive tasks. A few minutes later
Charles Napier (who played the
cheerful, bigamous trucker in
Demme's Handle with Care) shows
up, masticating a whole pack of gum in
his massive square jaw, as an old fac
tory hand resentful of the women who
have invaded his realm, and we an
ticipate a series of face-offs between
him and Kay.
The subject matter — how full-time (
work changes these women, how they
meld into a team, how friendship
springs up among them and how it
resembles and differs from male
camaraderie, how they cope with the
jibes and jokes of the men who are
asked suddenly to see them as co
workers — has extraordinary poten
tial, especially considering the cast
(which also includes Kurt Russell and
Fred Ward) and Jonathan Denime's
record. (As well as Handle with Care
— a bustling, offbeat farce about CB
operators — he directed Melvin and
Howard, the best American comedy
of recent years, and the charming TV
short film Who Ant I This Time?, star
ring Christopher Walken as a
hilariously i 11-at-ease community
theater actor who turns into every
character he plays.)
But aside from a few sequences,
Swing Shift bypasses this terrific
theme and settles for a dumb, uncon

vincing story about a woman who
learns, in her husband's absence, that
she can fall in love with someone else
(Russell) and that the woman across
the street (Christine l.ahti). whom she
always considered sleazy and loose, is
really nice after all. It's a movie about
how unwise it is to judge someone by
her appearance, because she might
turn out to be your best friend.
The fairly widespread gossip about
the making of Swing Shift indicates
that Goldie Hawn ordered Demme to
cut scenes centered on Hazel (Lahti),
that she called Robert Towne in to
shoot part of it and his contributions
were cut, that Bo Goldman and Nancy
Dowd, the original screenwriters, took
their names off it.and that the
credited screenwriter, Rob Morton, is
a pseudonym (for Dowd).
Certainly, even if you hadn't heard
all of this behnd-the-scenes dirt, you'd
have no trouble perceiving that
something has been cut. The opening
scenes, until Kay and Hazel get work
on the swing shift (4 p.m. to midnight)
at the plant, zip by so quickly that you
think you're watching a slide show —
glowingly lit bv Demme's faithful
cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto —
and Hazel's relationship with Biscuits
(Fred Ward), the owner of the club
where she sings, makes no sense at all:
Poor Ward shows up once every half
hour to beg Hazel's forgiveness for his
infidelities or to ask her to marry him,
and we never understand how we're
supposed to respond to him. (We also
never find out what happened to
Hazel's singing career.) But the off
camera clash of egos doesn't account
for the peculiarly uninteresting focus
of the picture, and neither does the
participation of too many cooks; in
fact, one can only locate Bo
Goldman's fine hand (the hand that
penned Melvin and Howard and Shoot

she smiles in anticipation of a crisis —
while Goldie Hawn settles. When Jack
returns on leave unexpectedly and
finds Kay partying with Hazel and
Lucky (Kurt Russell), who has
become Kay's lover, you wait for
Hawn to register the strangeness of
the encounter, but Ed Harris and Rus
sell do all the acting in this scene.
Ironically (and perhaps reveal
ingly), in Dowd's screenplays the men
make more of an impression than the
women: The showcase performances
in Slap Shot and Coming Home were
given by Paul Newman and Jon
Voight, and in Swing Shift you can't
keep your eyes off Russell and —
during his brief tenure in the plot —
Harris, who hits much more interest

ing low notes in the Bruce Dern role
than Dern himself did in Coming
Home. Based on the work he's done in
Used Cars, in the TV movie Elvis, in
Silkwood and in Swing Shift, Russell
never goes over the same ground; he
seems slighter and softer here than he
did in Silkwood. and his broad
shouldered strength in that film
(which practically held it together) has
given way to a different — more
tentative — sort of warmth. Unfortun
ately, Dowd writes him out of the
movie when Jack returns from the
war. but that's characteristic of her
style — she writes the whole movie out
of the movie.
Swing Shift is a mess, but you can
forgive Jonathan Demme for his part
of it (especially when you've seen his
Talking Heads concert film. Stop
Making Sense, which closed this year's
San Francisco Film Festival); Nancy
Dowd and Goldie Hawn don't squirm
off the hook so easily.
