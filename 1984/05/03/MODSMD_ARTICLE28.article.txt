Tempura. frying unattended in a
cooking pot atop an Escondido Vil
lage stove, ignited early yesterday eve
ning. causing extensive damage to the

No injuries were reported in the

cials estimated total damages to the
home of John Williams, a graduate

$45,000.
Kathy Abelson. who witnessed the
fire from her eighth story Hoskins
Tower apartment, said she first
noticed "what smelled rather unlike
barbeque smoke" at about 6:30 p.m..
then looked toward the Williams
residence on Thoburn Court, where a
man was climbing out a bedroom win
dow and onto a narrow lattice.
"He had a fire extinguishei in his
hand, but he seemed more interested
in getting out than anything else." she
said. "A neighbor on the ground took
the extinguisher from him and helped
. . . break his fall as he jumped about
eight feet to the ground."
Firefighters forced their way into
the apartment minutes later. "At one
point they did bring out what looked
like charred pots and pans," Abelson
said.
