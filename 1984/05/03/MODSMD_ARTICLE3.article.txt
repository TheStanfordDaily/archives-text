# Honor violations probed
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer Last in a two-part series 
It is late Friday afternoon and
you have saved the whole weekend
to crank out the take-home exam
your professor promised. As class
ends the essay question is handed
out with the stipulation that it be
handed in by class time Monday
morning and that you spend no
more than two hours preparing and
two hours writing. Is this a viola
tion of the honor code?
The answer is yes. And there are
many other violations that students
here are often not aware of, accor
ding 1o Arthur Keller, a member of
the Honor Code Commission
(HCC).
"The Honor Code Commission
is mainly supposed to be a repre
sentative of student preferences,"
HCC Chairman Mark Landcsmann
said. Several HCC concerns are
familiar to students, according to
Keller. These include:
• Timed take-home exams
• Closed-book take-home exams
• Unclear guidelines
• Overcrowded exam rooms
• Scarce or inadequate resources

• Relevance and appropriateness
of assignments and exams
• Respect by faculty members for
student ideas and work
• Quantity of materials on exams
• Re-use of exams and assignments
One of these issues, the problem
of inadequate resources, occurred
last quarter in Communication
Prof. Marion Lewenstein's
"History of Journalism" course.

According to one junior in the
class, "There was a problem with
getting enough textbooks for the
course, so only 20 people in a class
of f*o had books. There were three
copies on reserve in the library.
The mid-term was supposed to
cover 27 chapters of the book, so in
order to make it fair for those who

didn't have it.the professor gave us a
multiple-choice take-home test.
••I got mine done ahead of time and
a girl in the class came up to me and
said. I'd like to make you a lucrative
offer." She offered to pay me to let her
see my completed exam. I refused, hut
I didn't report the incident."
Lewenstein said that she found the
incident incredible. She was aware it
had occurred because there was men
tion of it on the anonymous class
evaluations at the end of the quarter.
"I was only expecting 20 to 25 stu
dents in the course and then 60 to 65
showed-up ... the rest of the students
had to make do with three books on
reserve . . . the mid-term was
supposed to be a check of the text
reading so 1 decided to give a fairly
easy mid-term that they could take
home because there were also three
papers required," she said.
Another issue being considered is
the prevalence of timed take-home
exams which is expressly forbidden by
the Honor Code. The back of a blue
book reads: "If take-home examina
tions are given, they should not be
closed-book examinations, nor should
there be a specified time limit less than
the full period between the distribu
tion of the examination and its due
date."
But students in Prof. Leo
Weinstein's French Literature 131
course last quarter were given a take
home midterm on Tuesday that was
due Thursday. According to a student
in the class, "He said you can only
spend one hour and 15 minutes on it
. . . he thought he was being nice to us.
He told us we could look at our notes
but not at the books. We talked to him
about it. . . . we showed it to him on
the back of the blue book but he didn't
see it as an infringement of the Honor
Code."
According to Weinstein, "It was a
simple matter. I was going to give the
exam in the classroom but it was too
crowded . . . this is a quite frequent
result of being given too small clas

rooms. ... I didn't put any limits on
the preparation and it was an open
book test.
"I just asked them to limit the time
rather than have them go to another
class." he said. "The teacher is faced
with a problem (because of over
crowded classrooms): getting another
room which leads to a lot of confusion
and inconvenience or giving an ex
amination that is a take-home."
The students involved decided not
to pursue the matter further "because
he would have known that it was us.
... It was a typical situation where the
honor students (those complying with
the code) are going to do less well."
Junior Robb Waterman also chose
not to report a violation he was aware
of. "I think it's none of my business it
that's what they want to do. but it is
annoying, especially if it interferes
with my taking the test." he said.
Junior Jainiie Krueger agreed. "I fig
ure so few people do it that it doesn't
really affect the curve."
"I wouldn't know who to report to
anyway." Waterman said. And accor
ding to Keller, student knowledge of
the judicial process is also being con
sidered by the commission.
Violations of the Honor Code are
sometimes handled privately by the
student and instructor. Penalty
grading, the lowering of a grade or
similar action, can be taken by an in
structor only with the student's full
knowledge and consent. Keller said.
Otherwise violations are brought to
the attention of Sally Cole, director of
research in the Dean of Student Af
fairs Office. If the person is charged,
his or her case is sent to the Dean of
Student Affairs Office to allow the
student to decide how to proceed.
At this point there are two options:
"If the student is pleading guilty we
can hear the case and weigh mitigating
circumstances. If they are not pleading
guilty the case is heard by the Student
Judicial Council," said Ron Hudson,
assistant dean of students. University
President Donald Kennedy receives
recomendations from either Hudson,
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
or from the council."The President
makes the final decision," Hudson
said.
