# Panel discusses weapons research

### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
Scientists from two Stanford re
search laboratories grappled with the
issue of using basic science for weap
ons technology in an open meeting of
the University's Committee on Re
search yesterday.
Scientists from Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SI.AC) and Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL) discussed the personal
dilemmas they face because of a De
partment of Energy research project
at SSRL which has applications for the
development of anti-satellite laser
weapons.
The sword of basic science has a
double edge, explained SSRL Direc
tor Arthur Bienenstock. and all re
search has the potential for specific
applications which researchers may
find unpleasant.
"Science has always had the double
edge on it." said Robert Mayer, a staff
technician at SSRL. "but I would
really like to see science and academic
institutions take responsibility for
what that sword is cutting."
Prof. Greg l.oew. a SI.AC re
searcher. said in his ideal world the
University should adopt guidelines
prohibiting research on "weapons of
mass destruction." just as it has
guidelines prohibiting classified re
search here. »
"But that would be an ideal world."

Loew warned. "But since we can't
have an ideal rule, it should be left up
to a group of individuals; it could be
the staff of SLAC, the director of
SL.AC ... it could be a group of wise
old men."
But Bienenstock said that when he
made the decision to accept the De
partment of Energy proposal for
SSRL, he acted in the capacity Loew
desribed.
"We judged the proposal as basic
science." Bienenstock said. "We
found it appropriate for research here
at SSRL., so we would have been right
back here at the same place" if a plan
like l.oew's were instituted.
The Committee on Research is cur
rently investigating the desirability of
reaffirming or modifying current Uni
versity policy which prohibits the Uni
versity from basing decisions about
the acceptability of research on
"speculations concerning the political
or moral impropriety of the uses which
may be made of (research) results."
The Faculty Senate of the Academic
Council has also asked the committee
to recommend whether additional
policies are needed to protect the
rights of individual researchers in col
laborative and interdependent proj
ects with other researchers. At yester
day's meeting the committee accepted
input from student and faculty mem
bers.
