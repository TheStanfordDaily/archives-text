Senate nixes spending freeze
Washington —The Senate yesterday decisively defeated a
proposed one-year freeze on federal spending, breaking a
budget logjam and clearing the way for expected approval in
the next tew days of a less drastic Republican plan supported
by President Reagan.
I he vote against the bipartisan budget freeze, which was
supposed to have cut federal deficits by $242 billion over
three years, was 65-33.
By contrast, the plan agreed to between Reagan and the
Senate Republican leadership is designed to reduce deficits
by $144 billion over the same period and leave nearly $200
billion in red ink each year.
The vote for the freeze proposal had been expected to be
closer, and heavy behind-the-scenes lobbying went on all day
by supporters of the Republican leadership proposal and
freeze backers, which included an assortment of business
groups. However, as it became clear that the freeze lacked
enough support to win, several senators backed away from
the politically risky plan.
The one-year, across-the-board freeze would have hit hard
at both defense spending increases supported by the
Republicans and social programs backed by the Democrats.
Under the proposal, defense spending would have been held
to the same level as this year, with no pay increases for either
the military or Pentagon civilian employees.
At the same time, it would have kept Social Security and
other federal benefits at current levels, capped Medicare pay
ments to doctors and hospitals and frozen all other federal
spending, including civilian government salaries.
Streleski moved to state prison
Vacaville — Theodore Streleski, serving a six-month term
for violating parole at the end of his sentence for killing a
Stanford professor, was transferred yesterday to the state
prison at Tehachapi.
Authorities said Streleski was removed from the California
Medical Facility prison at Vacaville and sent to the lower
security institution at Tehachapi because he has completed a
psychiatric evaluation and qualifies for lesser security under
the prison rating system.
Streleski was paroled March 8 after serving five years for
the second-degree murder of Professor Karel de Leeuw, who
was beaten to death with a hammer in his office in August
1978.
U.S. officials optimistic about
results of Salvadoran elections
San Salvador, El Salvador — American Embassy officials
say the democratic election of a president in El Salvador on
Sunday will be a "crowning touch" in efforts to clean up this
country's dismal record on human rights.
The Roman Catholic Church's human rights agency in San
Salvador, however, foresees no dramatic decline soon of the
killing of civilians by soldiers, police and right-wing death
squads. The head of the Catholic agency said in an interview
that civilian deaths in bombings and other military operations
occur at an alarming rate and that death squad killing con
tinues at the 1983 level.
Human rights abuses have presented the greatest obstacle
to U.S. public and congressional support for military aid to El
Salvador. Without the aid. Reagan administration officials
warn, Marxist-led guerrillas will gain the upper hand in one of
Central America's key battles for power.
Among U.S. Embassy officials who say they see light at the
end of the dark Salvadoran tunnel is Kenneth Bleakley, the
deputy chief of mission.
"The Salvadorans are now taking a systematic approach to
this," Bleakley said in an interview this week. "The basic
means for dealing with the problem are rapidly falling into
place. 1 believe having a president with a mandate for the first
time this century will be a crowning touch."
Congress strikes compromise
over new wilderness preserves
Washington — Congress broke a three-year impasse over
the future of the country's remaining wild lands yesterday,
striking a compromise between conservation and develop
ment interests that appears to clear the way for creation of 10
million acres of new wilderness areas in 25 states this year.
The proposed preserves, located in national forests, cover
an area twice the size of Massachusetts and would expand by
almost half the 24 million-acre federal wilderness system in
the lower 48 states.
Federal law protects these lands — deemed the nation's
most fragile and pristine — in their original, wild state,
safeguarding wildlife, watersheds and other ecological values.
The compromise also would release more than 10 million
other acres of national forests, kept in limbo since 1970 under
a federal wilderness-review program, for mineral exploration,
logging, motorized traffic and other development activities.
Forum to discuss Bahais' plight
Washington — In the wake of an emotional House subcom
mittee hearing, 12th District congressman Tom Lantos yes
terday proposed an international conference to focus world
attention on Iran's persecution of its Bahai religious minority.
Lantos. who heads the House Foreign Affairs Subcommit
tee on Human Rights, said that such a forum on the treatment
of Bahais in Iran would break the same sort of "conspiracy of
silence" that he said permitted Nazi Germany to kill 6 million
Jews during the Holocaust.
The Democrat aired his proposal after a stunned audience
heard Iranian emigre Said Eshragi, 35, tell of the hangings of
his parents and sister by the regime of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini when they refused to recant their belief.
Eshragi, who left Iran before the 1979 revolution there and
now lives in Texas, said his brother telephoned him from the
city of Shiraz last June 17 to inform him of the execution of
their father by the Iranian government.
As congressmen and members of the audience wept. Esh
ragi continued: "On June 19, I had another phone call, and
(the brother) said he wanted to tell me that our Mom had
joined Dad. Then he told me my sister had joined them."
Eshragi said his parents and sister were among a group of
80 Bahais placed on trial in Shiraz aftef the Khomeini regime
. outlawed the religion, which has about 300,000 adherents in
Iran. He said that they were offered liberty if they would
renounce their faith, but they refused. Iran considers Bahais
heretics and charges that many of them are agents for foreign
governments.

Senate nixes spending freeze
Washington —The Senate yesterday decisively defeated a
proposed one-year freeze on federal spending, breaking a
budget logjam and clearing the way for expected approval in
the next tew days of a less drastic Republican plan supported
by President Reagan.
I he vote against the bipartisan budget freeze, which was
supposed to have cut federal deficits by $242 billion over
three years, was 65-33.
By contrast, the plan agreed to between Reagan and the
Senate Republican leadership is designed to reduce deficits
by $144 billion over the same period and leave nearly $200
billion in red ink each year.
The vote for the freeze proposal had been expected to be
closer, and heavy behind-the-scenes lobbying went on all day
by supporters of the Republican leadership proposal and
freeze backers, which included an assortment of business
groups. However, as it became clear that the freeze lacked
enough support to win, several senators backed away from
the politically risky plan.
The one-year, across-the-board freeze would have hit hard
at both defense spending increases supported by the
Republicans and social programs backed by the Democrats.
Under the proposal, defense spending would have been held
to the same level as this year, with no pay increases for either
the military or Pentagon civilian employees.
At the same time, it would have kept Social Security and
other federal benefits at current levels, capped Medicare pay
ments to doctors and hospitals and frozen all other federal
spending, including civilian government salaries.
Streleski moved to state prison
Vacaville — Theodore Streleski, serving a six-month term
for violating parole at the end of his sentence for killing a
Stanford professor, was transferred yesterday to the state
prison at Tehachapi.
Authorities said Streleski was removed from the California
Medical Facility prison at Vacaville and sent to the lower
security institution at Tehachapi because he has completed a
psychiatric evaluation and qualifies for lesser security under
the prison rating system.
Streleski was paroled March 8 after serving five years for
the second-degree murder of Professor Karel de Leeuw, who
was beaten to death with a hammer in his office in August
1978.
U.S. officials optimistic about
results of Salvadoran elections
San Salvador, El Salvador — American Embassy officials
say the democratic election of a president in El Salvador on
Sunday will be a "crowning touch" in efforts to clean up this
country's dismal record on human rights.
The Roman Catholic Church's human rights agency in San
Salvador, however, foresees no dramatic decline soon of the
killing of civilians by soldiers, police and right-wing death
squads. The head of the Catholic agency said in an interview
that civilian deaths in bombings and other military operations
occur at an alarming rate and that death squad killing con
tinues at the 1983 level.
Human rights abuses have presented the greatest obstacle
to U.S. public and congressional support for military aid to El
Salvador. Without the aid. Reagan administration officials
warn, Marxist-led guerrillas will gain the upper hand in one of
Central America's key battles for power.
Among U.S. Embassy officials who say they see light at the
end of the dark Salvadoran tunnel is Kenneth Bleakley, the
deputy chief of mission.
"The Salvadorans are now taking a systematic approach to
this," Bleakley said in an interview this week. "The basic
means for dealing with the problem are rapidly falling into
place. 1 believe having a president with a mandate for the first
time this century will be a crowning touch."
Congress strikes compromise
over new wilderness preserves
Washington — Congress broke a three-year impasse over
the future of the country's remaining wild lands yesterday,
striking a compromise between conservation and develop
ment interests that appears to clear the way for creation of 10
million acres of new wilderness areas in 25 states this year.
The proposed preserves, located in national forests, cover
an area twice the size of Massachusetts and would expand by
almost half the 24 million-acre federal wilderness system in
the lower 48 states.
Federal law protects these lands — deemed the nation's
most fragile and pristine — in their original, wild state,
safeguarding wildlife, watersheds and other ecological values.
The compromise also would release more than 10 million
other acres of national forests, kept in limbo since 1970 under
a federal wilderness-review program, for mineral exploration,
logging, motorized traffic and other development activities.
Forum to discuss Bahais' plight
Washington — In the wake of an emotional House subcom
mittee hearing, 12th District congressman Tom Lantos yes
terday proposed an international conference to focus world
attention on Iran's persecution of its Bahai religious minority.
Lantos. who heads the House Foreign Affairs Subcommit
tee on Human Rights, said that such a forum on the treatment
of Bahais in Iran would break the same sort of "conspiracy of
silence" that he said permitted Nazi Germany to kill 6 million
Jews during the Holocaust.
The Democrat aired his proposal after a stunned audience
heard Iranian emigre Said Eshragi, 35, tell of the hangings of
his parents and sister by the regime of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini when they refused to recant their belief.
Eshragi, who left Iran before the 1979 revolution there and
now lives in Texas, said his brother telephoned him from the
city of Shiraz last June 17 to inform him of the execution of
their father by the Iranian government.
As congressmen and members of the audience wept. Esh
ragi continued: "On June 19, I had another phone call, and
(the brother) said he wanted to tell me that our Mom had
joined Dad. Then he told me my sister had joined them."
Eshragi said his parents and sister were among a group of
80 Bahais placed on trial in Shiraz aftef the Khomeini regime
. outlawed the religion, which has about 300,000 adherents in
Iran. He said that they were offered liberty if they would
renounce their faith, but they refused. Iran considers Bahais
heretics and charges that many of them are agents for foreign
governments.
