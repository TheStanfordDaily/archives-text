From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut, Lebanon — The Lebanese government.
alread\ in a state of crisis, faced another major di
lemma yesterdav with the capture of three Israeli
foreign service liaison officers who were arrested after
they wandered into Syrian-held territory.
Israel said it was holding Lebanon and Syria respon
sible for the safe return of the three civilians.
The arrest of the three, who are members of the staff
of an Israeli liaison office in Christian-held Lebanese
territory just north of here, overshadowed the fact that
three key appointees to Premier Rashid Karami's
Cabinet failed to show up for the Cabinet's first
meeting, increasing fears that the new government
might fall.
The Israeli liaison officers apparently lost their way
Tuesday on the main coast road.leading north from
Beirut. The three, attached to the Israeli Foreign Mini
stry office in the village of Dbaiye. drove through a
Christian militia checkpoint and one manned by the
Lebanese army just south of the town ot Batroun
before noticing that they were approaching a station
controlled by Syrian troops.
"They tried tp turn around, but drew tire from the
Syrian checkpoint," a military source said. "I guess the
car was wrecked and they escaped and got hack to the
Lebanese Army checkpoint.
The rest of the story is loss clear, although it appears
that the Lebanese soldiers turned the three over to the
Syrians, who arrested them. Beirut radio indicated that

the Syrians had forced the Lebanese to hand over the
Israelis.
Damascus radio confirmed yesterday that the Israelis
were in Syrian hands and referred u 'hem as a
"terrorist squad." the same phrase used by the Israelis
to describe Palestinian guerrillas. The official Syrian
news agency said: "At I p.m. May 1. our forces ar
rested a group of Israeli saboteurs made up ot three
sabotage elements who tried to infiltrate behind our
lines in northern Lebanon."
The incident created an immediate row in Israel,
where Defense Minister Moshe Arens said the capture
of the three civilians was a serious matter, especially il
they were taken initially by the Lebanese Army and
turned over to the Syrians. "The Lebanese government
must correct this mistake soon." he said.
The three men, identified by the Israeli Foreign Min
istry as Eran Florentin. Nahum Nesher and Shmuel
Roza. enjoyed quasi-diplomatic status in the Christian
area of Lebanon, where the Israelis opened the office
under the terms of the Lebanese-Israeli troop
withdrawal and security agreement signed nearly a year
ago. They have continued to man the office even
though Lebanon abrogated the pact in March.
Throughout the day yesterday, neither the Lebanese
army nor government issued any statement on the mat
ter. The Israelis appealed to the United States, France
and Lebanon for assistance in securing the release of
the three men.
Meanwhile, Karami's 10-member Cabinet, ap

pointed Mondav night, held its first meeting without
Shia Moslem leader Nabih Berri. Druse chieftain Walid
Jumhlatt or Abdullah Rassi. a prominent member of
the Greek Orthodox community.
Berri and Jumhlatt were in Damascus, reportedly
conferriim for the second day in a tow with Syiian \ ice
President Abdel Halim Khaddam. The Syrians, who
have openly praised the makeup ot the Cabinet, are ap
parently attempting to convince the two to join it.
despite the fact that Berri quickly announced late Mon
day that he would reject karami" s offer of the Cabinet's
justice and hydroelectric power portfolios.
Berri complained that neither job would allow him to
introduce am meaningful changes in the way Lebanon
was governed. Berri wanted karami to appoint a 26-
member Cabinet, with himself and other major fac
tional leaders sen mg as "ministers ot state, posts that
would allow them to"exert influence in all phases of the
government.
Jumhlatt has said nothing since the appointments but
he reportedly was hesitating about accepting his ap
pointment as minister of public works and ot tourism.
There was no official explanation of Rassi's absence
from the Cabinet meeting. Rassi. who was named inte
rior minister, had made 110 public objection either to
the makeup of the Cabinet or to his own appointment.
After the Cabinet meeting, which lasted 2 and a half
hours, karami said that his ministers would have an ac
tive say in all phases of government. 110 matter what
their title.
