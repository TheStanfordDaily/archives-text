From the Los Angeles Times
Fairbanks, Alaska â€” President
Reagan assured Pope John Paul II yes
terday that the United States would be a
"force for peace" and offered to send a
presidential mission to Rome to discuss
economic development and
humanitarian assistance with Vatican of
ficials.
Reagan, on his way home from a trip
to China, met for 20 minutes with the
pope, whose plane stopped here briefly
for refueling before continuing to South
Korea. After the closed session, during
which they discussed Reagan's China trip
and world issues, both departed, the
president heading for Washington.
Several thousand persons who turned
out in a cold, light rain cheered the two
leaders as they talked about their jour

neys.
Declaring that Alaska can be consid
ered a "crossroads of the world," the
pope noted that 65 languages are spoken
in the state and that "people of many
diverse backgrounds find a common
home with the Aleuts, Eskimos and Indi
ans."
"President Reagan," he said, "is re
turning from visiting the beloved people
of China, even as I am making my way to
a neighboring area in the Far East. The
city of Fairbanks reminds us also of an
other direction for it is called 'the heart
of the golden north.' "
The mission Reagan offered to send to
the Vatican would explain U.S. foreign
assistance and economic and
humanitarian programs to Vatican offi
cials.

In turn, the White House said, the
Vatican would brief the mission on its
development and humanitarian activities
throughout the world. The goal would be
to begin a dialogue that could lead to
U.S.-Vatican cooperation in the effort to
alleviate hunger and disease and to
promote peace worldwide.
Reagan, bare-headed and wearing a
tan raincoat, said he could think of a no
more fitting close to his journey than to
be in the presence of the pope, who has
"worked so diligently for recognition of
the rights and dignity of the individual
and for peace among nations."
With the pope heading for South
Korea and Reagan having just com
pleted extensive talks with Chinese offi
cials, the two leaders had a special inter

est in discussing the volatile and poten
tially explosive differences between*
Soviet-hacked North Korean and lI.S
backed South Korea.
Chinese leaders told Reagan that the
United States should work with both
Koreas to try to reduce tensions and aim
for eventual reunification of the country.
But Reagan, who has stressed that the
controversy can be settled only by the
two Koreas themselves, showed no inter
est in the United States playing a third
party role in any negotiations.
The pope has shown a strong interest
in the reunification of Korea. At the
Vatican on Sunday, he spoke of Koreans
as "one people." The message was read
in South Korean churches at Sunday
services.
