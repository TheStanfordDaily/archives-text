# Faculty Senate hears report
## Theme houses catalyze hot debate 
### BOB COHN Daily staff 
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) presented its interim report on issues of resi
dential education, featuring the recommendation
that freshmen he excluded from ethnic theme
houses, to the Faculty Senate yesterday and
sparked a lively debate among senators, committee
memhers, ASSU representatives and spokesper
sons from Stanford's ethnic communities.
Bruce Parker, professor of Radiology and
Pediatrics and chairman of the committee, ex
plained that, while ethnic theme houses provide a
valuable "social support system" to their mem
bers, the committee opted to make the "freshman
experience . . . more uniform."
According to Parker, the committee had to
choose between the educational benefits of tradi
tional all-freshman and four-class dorms and the
social benefits of theme houses.
"On one side there is the advantage of the edu
cational experience of freshman year; on the other,
the social support" of theme houses, he said. "In
weighing these, we came down on one side."
Parker emphasized the importance of all fresh
men partaking in a shared academic experience.

Because theme houses, as well as other residences,
can't always accommodate this "critical mass"' of
freshmen, they should not be considered a viable
option for academic reasons, he said.
"Serious academic disadvantages could arise if
freshmen were placed in four-class houses not
large enough to have a critical mass of freshmen
for satisfactory advising or house-based freshman
courses," according to the interim report.
The recommendation drew reaction — mostly
negative — from both members of the senate and
guests of yesterday's meeting, one of the most
highly attended of the year.
"1 don't see why this has to be an either/or situa
tion," said Patricia Jones, associate professor of bi
ological sciences. There must be "lots of possible
ways of bringing the residential education benefits
to the theme houses." Jones later added that per
haps the committee had "too much concern for the
'freshman experience.' "
Education Prof. Elizabeth Cohen said that
theme houses are more vital to freshmen than to
any other class. "I would say you've got your
policy backward," she said to Parker. "The emer
gency is the first year, and you've got it so you
don't allow them (freshmen) that sense of support

in the first year."
Donna Anderson, ASSU deputy senate chair,
said that "perhaps there's just too much stress on
the academic benefit of the idea! freshman
year. ... It could he overkill."
Parker explained that because C-US's charge
dictates that it "evaluate how residences are
utilized in meeting the educational experience "
the committee focused on the "educational aspects
of Residential Education programs."
Senior Ken Mertzel, a member of the commit
tee, said the recommendation was designed with
the interests of freshmen in mind. He said the com
mittee concentrated on "what is best for freshmen,
not necessarily what is best for theme houses."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, one of three
committee members who dissented from the
majority in the report, said. "We think it makes
great sense to assign not only members of ethnic
minorities to theme houses, but also Caucasians."
Rebholz said he "strongly dissents" from the com
mittee's recommendation concerning the residence
of freshmen in theme houses.
Several students at the meeting expressed con-

cern over the way ethnic theme houses
are presented to students. "I don't
think a paragraph in a book can help
to inform the freshman," said Ander
son.
Mert/el agreed: "Presently the
freshmen are given very little informa
tion about theme houses." Mertzel
said that because freshmen are given
the option to choose "no preference"
in regard to living in theme houses,
too many who don't have a real inter
est in the house get placed there. But,
he acknowledged, if only freshmen
who indicated a "positive preference"
were assigned to theme houses, they
would be devoid of that "critical
mass" which the committee deems im
portant to the freshman experience.
C-US's recommendation, released
last week, also calls for assigning onlv
those students to theme houses who
have a "demonstrated interest in and
explicit commitment to the academic
theme" and filling residential frater
nities through an unregulated draw.
Parker explained that since residen
tial fraternities utilize University
housing, they should, under the Uni
versity's notion of residential educa
tion. be open to all students.
According to the report,
"Residential fraternities and sororities
are, in effect, theme houses which are
social. They are given unique rights of
self-selection. . . . While part of the
residence system, they are outside the
Residential Education program. They
are. in fact, theme houses without an
educational component to the theme."
Parker said the committee will pass
on its recommendations concerning
fraternities and sororities to the Uni
versity's Task Force on Fraternities
and Sororities, which is currently pre

paring a proposal for Dean of Student
Affairs James I.yons.
Parker said the committee will
review the feedback received at ves
terday's Faculty Senate at its next
meeting. The final C-US recommen
dation. however, is not subject to ap
proval bv the Faculty Senate, but in
stead will go directly to Lyons' desk.
In other action, the Senate voted
unanimously to support a reform in
the Law School grading system. The
1 2-point plan includes planks "to limit
the number of pass no credit classes
available to law students" and "to
switch the mean of the grading system
from C+ to B."
According to a report prepared by
the Committee on Academic Apprais
als and Achievement, such a change in
the grade scale was necessary because
students and faculty believed law stu
dents here "were suffering com
petitively in placement because their
transcripts showed many B's and
Cs." The change will increase "the
normal mean grade from 2.N5 to 3.20
on a 4.3 scale." as well as eliminate
any erade below 2.1.
