# Faculty Senate hears report
## Theme houses catalyze hot debate 
### BOB COHN Daily staff 
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) presented its interim report on issues of resi
dential education, featuring the recommendation
that freshmen he excluded from ethnic theme
houses, to the Faculty Senate yesterday and
sparked a lively debate among senators, committee
memhers, ASSU representatives and spokesper
sons from Stanford's ethnic communities.
Bruce Parker, professor of Radiology and
Pediatrics and chairman of the committee, ex
plained that, while ethnic theme houses provide a
valuable "social support system" to their mem
bers, the committee opted to make the "freshman
experience . . . more uniform."
According to Parker, the committee had to
choose between the educational benefits of tradi
tional all-freshman and four-class dorms and the
social benefits of theme houses.
"On one side there is the advantage of the edu
cational experience of freshman year; on the other,
the social support" of theme houses, he said. "In
weighing these, we came down on one side."
Parker emphasized the importance of all fresh
men partaking in a shared academic experience.

Because theme houses, as well as other residences,
can't always accommodate this "critical mass"' of
freshmen, they should not be considered a viable
option for academic reasons, he said.
"Serious academic disadvantages could arise if
freshmen were placed in four-class houses not
large enough to have a critical mass of freshmen
for satisfactory advising or house-based freshman
courses," according to the interim report.
The recommendation drew reaction — mostly
negative — from both members of the senate and
guests of yesterday's meeting, one of the most
highly attended of the year.
"1 don't see why this has to be an either/or situa
tion," said Patricia Jones, associate professor of bi
ological sciences. There must be "lots of possible
ways of bringing the residential education benefits
to the theme houses." Jones later added that per
haps the committee had "too much concern for the
'freshman experience.' "
Education Prof. Elizabeth Cohen said that
theme houses are more vital to freshmen than to
any other class. "I would say you've got your
policy backward," she said to Parker. "The emer
gency is the first year, and you've got it so you
don't allow them (freshmen) that sense of support

in the first year."
Donna Anderson, ASSU deputy senate chair,
said that "perhaps there's just too much stress on
the academic benefit of the idea! freshman
year. ... It could he overkill."
Parker explained that because C-US's charge
dictates that it "evaluate how residences are
utilized in meeting the educational experience "
the committee focused on the "educational aspects
of Residential Education programs."
Senior Ken Mertzel, a member of the commit
tee, said the recommendation was designed with
the interests of freshmen in mind. He said the com
mittee concentrated on "what is best for freshmen,
not necessarily what is best for theme houses."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, one of three
committee members who dissented from the
majority in the report, said. "We think it makes
great sense to assign not only members of ethnic
minorities to theme houses, but also Caucasians."
Rebholz said he "strongly dissents" from the com
mittee's recommendation concerning the residence
of freshmen in theme houses.
Several students at the meeting expressed con-
