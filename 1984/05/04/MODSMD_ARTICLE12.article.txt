Actors spend their lives pretending to be

to Louis Anthony, icting goes well beyond the
realm ot theater.
" People are so phony," says Anthony, direc
tor of l heatre in Progress's upcoming produc
tion of "I lair." " V ou have to get beyond that."

To take his actors from illusion and into
reality, Anthony employs one of several dra
matic techniques that he calls a "theater
game."
In a recent play practice, he had each mem
ber of the cast tell him about himself — not
through the script's perception of the character
but as the incarnation of him.
"Every time you ever really get beyond the
mask, you find that there is something you like,
something you can deal with or something you
can relate to," Anthony explains. "If you can't
get the actor to make some kind of personal

commitment to the role, he will always play at
it and will never he it,"he added.
As an actor, what Anthony opposed most in
his directors was "one who told you where to
go, how your lines should be read — one who
gave you no freedom of artistic expression."
Indeed. Anthony's style of directing has
been influenced largely by his own experiences
as an actor.
"If I can learn my lines, go through a script
and find where I feel I fit in, then when I come
out onstage — it will be real, it will work."
The 25-year-old native of Hawaii began his
acting career with "A Raisin In The Sun"

when he was eight. Though his mother was a
singer find his father a drummer, "'they had
nothing to do with my artistic career. They just
brought a lot of art into the home."
His own initiative pushed him beyond school
plays and gospel choirs, as he became inter-

also as a mode of making social statements. At

realizing for the first time the social power of
the stage.
While in high school at the Punahou
Academy in Honolulu, he developed an inter
est in religious musicals and became actively
involved with the University of Hawaii's
theater department, appearing in both
"Godspell" and "Jesus Christ Superstar." Be
cause Punahou had its own music and dance
schools, his acting, directing and dancing were
constantly encouraged.
It was natural, then, that when he began col
lege he would continue in his artistic pursuits.
But because Menlo College, where he enrolled
after coming to California, did not have a
drama department or dance classes, Anthony
started the Menlo Play Makers, the school's
first theatrical group.
After graduating with a degree in business
administration, he eventually took a position
with a bank in Santa Clara where he still works
part-time.
"If I could get away from that requirement
of having to have the money to survive on a
basic level I would." Anthony says. "I'd get as
far away from it as I could."
In addition to his work at the bank, he works
for the City of Palo Alto Community Theater.

thony is responsible for producing concerts for
the Cultural Center on Sunday afternoons and
producing the Brown Bag concerts in the sum
mer. He also develops many of the music,
dance and theater classes for the Adult Per
forming Arts.
Anthony, however, does not stop at organiz
ing, producing and directing in other theater
and performing arts groups. Currently he is
working on beginning his own theatrieal com
pany with a "close-knit artistic group." who,
he says, "have become my theater family."
He p/ans to make his theater company "as
commercial as possible without losing its social
perspective."
Anthony wants, via his direction of "Hair,"
to also raise social issues, "to make people
think.
"Racism, women's rights, war, drugs and the
responsibility of a government to its people,"
Anthony said, "were once the realities of the
'60s and are still the realities of the '80s."
To help his actors find where they fit into the
scope of the musical, Anthony had each mem
ber of the cast bring in material relevant to the
19605.
From the Berkeley protests to the Kent
State riots to a reading from the "Electric
Kool-Aid Acid Test." anything which helps his
actors find the "cores of their characters" is
going to make the production real, he says.
