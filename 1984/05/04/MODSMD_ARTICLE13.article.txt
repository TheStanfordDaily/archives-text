## The 						Stanford Daily Fairness in grad housing 
### 
Recently a rift has been brewing on campus
that threatens to segregate graduate students
from undergraduates and divide the University
into two autonomous camps.
The spiraling rent increases at Escondido Vil
lage, the graduate housing project, have residents
there up in arms. Rent has increased as much as
85 percent during the past four years for some
units, placing a great strain on many married
graduate students who, along with their spouses,
can barely afford to pay rent and must subsist on a
minimum of monthly expenditures. Clearly,
something must be done.
We laud the University for taking a first step in
the right direction with the proposal of a
grandfather clause that would limit the rent in
crease for present Village residents to 10.85 per
cent next year. That number is fair because it is
equivalent to the projected increase on housing
campuswide, including quarters for undergradu
ates. While this move by the University certainly
does little to justify the steep rent increases of the
past, it does at least show recognition on the part
of the University to the plight of graduate stu

dents and their families.
We hope to see more.
We understand the gripes of residents but must
disagree with attacks made by some graduate stu
dents on the recently completed Governor's Cor
ner housing project. Many Escondido residents
are angered that they must pay for quarters in
which they may not live. "Why should we pay for
the housing of undergraduates?" they ask.
This line of reasoning closely parallels that of
another question, "Why should 1 pay welfare
taxes if I don't receive food stamps?" The
answers to these questions are simple. Graduate
students should help pay for undergraduate
housing to preserve the homogeneity of the Uni
versity, just as a citizen pays taxes for the benefit
of all the public, not just himself.
There is presently a University proposal for the
construction of new graduate housing beginning
as early as 1988. Undergraduates will help
finance that endeavor. In the end, it is a two-way
street, with graduate students and undergraduates
working together for the benefit of each other,
not merely themselves.
