VIEWPOINT

cal, the solution to the problem
"defraternize" a fraternity house
and finally, throughout the editorial, it
assumes a negative view of fraternities
and rush.
First, Stanford is a private university
which accepts applicants through a
discriminating process; the editorial
board complains of discrimination
while the members attend an institu
tion whose admissions favors high test
scores, good grades, excellent athletics
and a good personality.
The solution to "Greek discrimina
tion," which fraternities supposedly
inflict upon students, is to
"defraternize" the fraternity and
make the houses into Draw-controlled

"fraternity environment residences."
If we should go that far then why not
abolish fraternities all together? Put
ting fraternities in the Draw would
force a severence of ties with each fra
ternity's national chapter. In 10 years,
the new fraternities would so resemble
other residences like Storey or Kairos
that they should not deserve their fra
ternity name.
But, more importantly, what's so
wrong with fraternities? Nobody has
to rush fraternities, hence, nobody has
to be disheartened by a rejection. The
Rush period, according to the edito
rial, is a period where
"individuals . . . tell the fraternity
members how much they'd like to join
them." Rush is actually a two-way
street; students are evaluating the fra
ternity just as much (and even more
than in the first week of Rush) as frat
members are evaluating students. By
the end of the second week of Rush,
rushees must narrow their choices of
fraternities since fraternities purposely
schedule special events on the same
day. By the end of Rush, only those

who are seriously rushing a certain
fraternity are at the last events; I will
not deny that some of these don't get
bids, yet more do than don't. Ask any
rush chairman.
Discriminatory organizations
should indeed not exist where the only
option for one is to be evaluated:
Whether fraternities should be
"accepted" at Stanford is a question
that the Stanford administration has
not clearly answered. At Stanford,
male students have the choice of en
tering the Draw and/or Rush. The
pressure to join a fraternity at Stan
ford doesn't compare to the pressure
to find one's niche in a fraternity at a
large public university such as UCLA.
Compared to fraternities at these
larger universities, Stanford frater
nities are rather unique and positive in
their eagerness to socialize with non
members and to contribute their time
and money to charitable activities and
funds. Ergo, frats here are OK.
