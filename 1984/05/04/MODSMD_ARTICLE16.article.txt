## Activism needed to oust Reagan 
### 
Thus far. three and one-half years into his first term.
President Reagan has demonstrated an amazing ability to
slide away unharmed from the sticky messes that charac
terize what one author has called "Reagan's Reign of Er
ror." Whether the mess is ill-explained foreign invasion,
careless death of American soldiers abroad or destructive
interference into the Civil Rights Commission, Ronald
Reagan seems able to avoid harsh criticism for the type of
blunders that brought down his predecessors. The recent
exposure of the ClA's illegal mining of Nicaraguan ports is
yet another example of such a sticky mess and it should
serve as a starting point for students at Stanford to step
forward and say they will no longer tolerate Reagan's in
difference to international law and safety.

VIEWPOINT

The "secret" Nicaraguan mining incident should be out
rageous to the American public just as it is to the interna
tional community. Not only did Reagan and his CIA
operatives deceive the public about American activities in
Nicaragua, they also deceived high-ranking officials in the
U.S. Congress. One notable example is Senator Barry
Goldwater (R-Ariz.), one of Reagan's closest allies and
the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Com
mittee. Upon learning that Reagan had personally
approved the CIA mining operation, Goldwater angrily
asked CIA Director William Casey:
"How can we back (the President's) foreign policy when
we don't even know what the hell he is doing? Lebanon,
yes, we all knew that he sent troops over there. But mine the
harbors in Nicaragua? This is an act violating international
law, it is an act of war. For the life of me, I don't see how we
are going to explain it."
The Nicaraguans, needless to say, are also wondering
how Reagan will explain such illegality. They have taken

the matter to the World Court. an international organ
from which the United States sought justice when Iranian
students held our embassy stall hostage in 1979. When
Iran refused to obey the World Court's ruling to release
the hostage . Americans were furious. Now Reagan seeks
to ignore the World Court in the same way Iran did hy
asserting a lack of World Court jurisdiction over U.S.
disputes involving any of the countries of Central
America. In slaking this ground, the president articulates a
position so cynical and inconsistent with past U.S. policies
that it may permanently damage our credibility in Central
America.
The Nicaraguan incident, in and of itself, is a despicable
demonstration of political irresponsibility, but New York
Times columnist Anthony Lewis sees a more fundamental
Reagan flaw revealed in it:
"Some may be surprised that an administration calling it
self conservative cares so little for the lan But Ronald
Reagan is not a conservative - not in the sense of Barry
Goldwater. He is a radical who wants to enlarge the power
to wage secret wars regardless of law and tradition."
Will Reagan survive this major failure in policy-making
just as he has every other? Not il the public, particularly
the student public, steps forward to demand more com
petent leadership. The case for student activism is particu
larly compelling. Whether it be involvement in local, state
or national elections, students at Stanford ought to use
their influence as members of a highly respected commu
nity to help make a difference in the 19N4 elections. The
year 1984 is a landmark political year because it
represents a choice for Americans between renewal of
Reagan's conservative politics and a recommitment to a
more pragmatic world outlook and a fair ordering of
domestic priorities.
