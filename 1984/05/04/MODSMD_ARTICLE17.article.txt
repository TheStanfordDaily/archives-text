## Potential exists for instability in Mexico 
### 
Adolfo Garcia de la Sienra's reply (Daily, April
27) to my piece (Daily, April 16) was headlined
"Revolution unlikely in Mexico." I hope he is
right, but the headline might have been dated
1910, when the centennial of Mexico's indepen
dence was hailed with fulsome praise of the
stability brought by dictator Porfirio Diaz. Every-

thing seemed peaceful, when suddenly the hell of
the Mexican Revolution broke loose and Diaz was
forced into exile.
Garcia dismisses the United Socialist Party as in
significant, but so was Francisco Maderog until he
led the revolution and became president. Fidel
Castro was at first regarded as a joke and then re
ported dead until he came down from the Sierra
Mqesfra with his small band.
Garcia says the peasants know nothing about
communism. The point is that they and peasants in
Cuba and elsewhere are manipulated by
ideologues, most of them leftist.
As for Central America being Mexico's back
yard, the parallel with the U.S. attitude is very real.
There is no enormous amount of evidence about

this, including such matters as the independence of
Belize, and now Mexico's role in the Contadora
group.
To say that there is no religious conflict at all in
Mexico is an incredible refusal to face the facts and
to read the pertinent information. Admittedly it
has declined, but it is just below the surface. As for
the universities, it is dangerous to dismiss as insig
nificant "some noisy socialists and a few fascists."
The Cuban revolution was planned and organized
on university campuses, and the University of
Leon in Nicaragua has been designated as "the
cradle of the revolution." I have been studying
Latin America and its universities for almost half a
century; the Daily piece I wrote was a very
abridged version of a longer report which ap
peared in the last issue of the World Affairs
Report and which has more of my recent observa
tions on Mexican universities.
The question of a slice of northern Mexico
seceding or being taken by the Untied States is
complicated by the fact that secessionists usually
are "inspired" from a covetous neighboring
country. The matter was discussed at length at a
conference I attended last year at the University of
Mexico. The United States does not want any

more Mexican territory, and I think the danger
remote, but if Mexico blew up or fell apart, heaven
knows what would happen. A prosperous United
States might look more attractive to northern
Mexicans in view of the rise to power in California
and the Southwest of the Mexican-American com
munity.
1 have lived through many Latin American revo
lutions. and my revolutionary baptism was in
Spain, where I lived from 1933 to 1 was
evacuated during the Civil War, a bloody affair in
which a million died. It was comparable in its hor
ror to the Mexican Revolution. When it was evi
dent that the country faced a threat of revolution,
optimistic Spaniards would insist, "Aqui no pasa
nada," the Spanish equivalent of "It can't happen
here." Garcia reminds me of them.
Still, I hope he's right. Incidentally, I made no
firm predictions; my Daily piece bore the sober
title: "A Report from Mexico." The headlines
about revolution and secession were artwork pro
vided by The Daily.
