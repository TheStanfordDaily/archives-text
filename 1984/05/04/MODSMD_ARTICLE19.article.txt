Reagan's true believers

Well. Robert Larkins has revealed
his true colors in his viewpoint (Daily.
April 25) supporting the CIA mining
of Nicaraguan harbors. No wonder he
was so upset (Daily, April 11) about
ASSU funding of groups with diverse
views, groups he accuses of
"challenging the values of main
stream America."
Now it is clear that according to his
perspective, anybody who doesn't
believe Reagan's rhetoric, word for
word, must be outside "mainstream
values." Larkins is so good at reciting
the rhetoric, I bet he could even do it
with his eyes closed.

Contrary to the impression that
might have been given by a reader of
a cartoon (Daily, April 26), the

third DECsystem-20 lor the LOTS
Computer Facility was not a gift from
Digital Equipment Corporation or
anyone else. (Digital Equipment

ment and funds for Project SUN

What's a bavarium?
I wish to make a small correction to
Steve Vineberg's review of the movie
Iceman. He referred to the enclosure .
for keeping and studying animals and
vegetation as a "bavarium." I believe
he meant to say. "vivarium.'" But it's
an understandable error because the
similar "bavarium" is defined as an
enclosure for keeping and studying
sausage, kraut. German language
scholars and beer.
