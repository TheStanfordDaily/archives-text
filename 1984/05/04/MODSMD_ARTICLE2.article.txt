The U.S. Olympic soccer team will play at least twice in
Stanford Stadium this summer, according to match
pairings announced this week.
The U.S. team will face Costa Rica on July 29 in the first
of nine Olympic games to be played here and will then
meet Egypt on Aug. 2, the fifth day of competition.
Teams from East Germany, Morocco, Brazil and Saudi
Arabia are also scheduled to play at Stanford, and teams
from Czechoslovakia, Chile, France, Oatar and the Soviet
Union may also play here if they advance to one ot the two
quarterfinal matches to be held here. The winners ol those
two matches will meet in a semifinal game in the stadium
on Aug. S.
"People who see the matches here have a reasonable
chance to see all teams that will win the finals," said John
Boesch, the director of the Olympic matches to he held
here.
That the U.S. team will play here should increase inter
est in the matches among Bay Area sports tans. Boesch
said.
"People will say, 'I want to see the U.S. play in the
Olympics,' " Boesch said, "but not because they re
(necessarily) interested in soccer."
Boesch said that although exact counts are difficult to
obtain, he believes ticket sales are running at about 30
percent for Stanford's opening ceremonies, quarterfinals
and semifinals. But, Boesch said, ticket sales are not his
most important concern.
"The most important thing tor us as hosts is to provide
the most safe and enjoyable visit for our guests," Boesch
said in his Palo Alto office. "Whether there's 10,000 or
50,000. it doesn't matter to us. This is not like a normal
sports event; there's not a profit motive."
University President Donald Kennedy said yesterday

Stanford is gearing up security both for the games and the
players and coaches, who will live in Branner Hall.
"Marv Harrington, our director of campus security, has
been praying every night that Israel. Syria. Argentina and
Great Britain don't constitute the Olympic soccer pool."
Kennedy joked.
Boesch said he hopes security will be at a minimal but
"reasonable" level.
"We're not predicting with these particular visitors any
problems," Boesch said. "I might have been less con
cerned had a different group of teams been chosen to play
here. But I recognize that conditions between countries
can change overnight. 1 would be fooled drastically by any
set of circumstances between any lour teams.
"We're trying to make this whole event take place in an
environment which is the benefit ot a political environ
ment in the U. 5.," Boesch said. "We don't intend to make
Stanford an armed camp."
Boesch said planning is also underway for the opening
ceremonies here, which will be a scaled-down version of
the official opening ceremonies in Los Angeles, complete
with a procession, marching bands and a professionally de
signed color scheme.
Boesch said he had "no idea" if the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching band would be invited to play
at the opening ceremony.
"I don't know what the condition of the Stanford Band
is in July," Boesch said. "They made me very proud when
they participated in the dedication of the stadium (as an
official site of the Olympics) in October. You never know
what might happen when the Band takes the field, but they
did a beautiful job of the Olympic hymn."
Boesch said tickets for the opening ceremonies and
matches arc available at Bay Area Sears stores. First Inter
state Bank, the Stanford Athletic Department and will
soon be available at Tresidder Ticket Office.

John Boesch, director of the Olympic matches at Stanford, will try to keep a tight fist on security for the ath
letes and coaches who will play here. Boesch made that feeling very clear when he affirmed that the top
priority for him is the safety-margin and not the profit-margin.
