# Beating the procrastination beast
## 
### 
You have probably seen the procrastinator in
your dorm because he is pathetically easy to spot
— especially straight ahead in the bathroom mir
ror, where he is revealed by sleepily unworried
eyes and an unfinished problem set. In fact, your
dorm probably houses a group of procrastinators
— the unreformable chronic element as well as the
latent group which emerges during spring quarter.
Resident assistants, who are trained to smell out
procrastinators, are often victims of the same
disease. The buddy system has not solved the
problem because procrastinators tend to hang out
together (often late at night), and to hide their af
fliction behind a cool facade when in the company
of others.
Procrastination is not so much a vice as it is an
art form; it is a relatively benign social disease
when compared to alcoholism, druj: abuse, addic
tion to gambling or strange sexual deviance. Still, it
is probably the most widespread ailment around,
and it quietly and sweetly pulls people back into an
unconscious, rationalized state of unfulfilled prom
ise. In many ways, procrastination is indeed like a
vice, and discussing it is almost pointless because
understanding it and overcoming it are not neces
sarily related.
Because the tangible effects of this malady are
often unrecognizable or ignored, th<. discovery and
treatment are further complicated. Still, it is
worthwhile to consider looking around and sizing
up this quietly pervasive monster.
Identifying the procrastinator is really the
easiest part, although admitting that one is a
procrastinator is usually balanced by plausible, ra
tionalized and shallow arguments to the contrary.
The unmistakable giveaways include the obvious
signs: papers, programs and problejr sets being

finished hastily over breakfast, work being turned
in late and other academic scrambling.
Several evasions to identification can mislead
one into incorrectly labeling a procrastinator as u
serious, devoted student. Someone who goes to the
library regularly may spend the whole time sleep
ing, socializing or reading magazines. The friend in
the corner with a huge textbook may be concealing
a copy of People magazine. The person who insists
on a separate study room may not be a privacy

Procrastination is not so
much a vice as it is an art
form.

freak but actually someone who does most of his
sleeping in the daytime. The frantic individual who
is always circulating the second floor at Meyer is
not a dedicated reader of reserve and reference
material but merely a social maximizer keeping in
touch with the library crowd
Understanding the causes of the affliction are
really more difficult. 1 am not completely qualified
to analyze the subject, but I know that I have been
afflicted ever since 1 was able to write an in-class
essay and still get an "A" on a book which I had
honestly forgotten to read. Since that day 1 have
often turned to the method that I used on that oc
casion — to thoroughly read introductions, back
covers and author's notes. I his familiar tool, and
others like it, give the procrastinator the false
sense of security which leaves work to th> : «si min

ute and then undone This points to one possible
cause: the mistaken sense of calm and assurance
held by most procrastinators, that "I'll figure
something out." It is easy to develop this sense be
cause it is backed by years of "figuring something
out" even if that something isn't the best or most
honest thing.
Psychologists and other trained observers of
procrastination point to the flip side of this sense of
overconfidence and cool: inner self-doubt. It is
said that by procrastinating one produces a ready
excuse for anything short of perfection. Procras
tinating is failing to meet the challenge on its own
terms. A certain fear of failure would appear to
motivate many procrastinators.
There is another serious side to procrastination.
In themselves, laziness and tardiness may be
benign, dangerous only to the procrastinator.
When restricted to academics, procrastination only
harms the individual concerned. However, beyond
academics, procrastination can produce more lar
reaching and important consequences. 1 he danger
can extend to other?, when academic procrastina
tion becomes social and moral laziness
Taking care of other people, concerning oneself
with important issues, helping those in need and
even obtaining means of birth control should not
be left to thc last five minutes, and thus possibly
forgotten.
Helping the procrastinator is the most difficult
subject ot all Only the individual involved can ef
fectively escape th< shadow of procrastination, and
he/she must do it by liist admitting (like at .in Al
coholics Anonymous meeting): "My name is
and I am a procrastinator."
