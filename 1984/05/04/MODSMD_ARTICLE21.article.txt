# Not everything is small-scale in Marin County

### CATHY JANUS 
In as much time as it takes to
drive to downtown San Fran
cisco, you can instead go beyond
the City to Sausalito and Marin
County. Head north on Inter
state 2KO and then take 19th
Avenue across the Golden Gate
Bridge. There, on the head
lands, you can join other people
who park at the scenic overlook
to enjoy the view before them
or to walk across the Golden
Gate Bridge.
Once you're back on the
highway, take the first exit, Al
exander Avenue, and wind your
way down this picturesque road
to the waterfront. On the hill
sides cling Victorian mansions,
redwood cottages and weekend
retreats of wealthy San Francis
cans. Others live on the water it
self in whimsical houseboats
each with its own distinctive
design and character.
At the turn of the century,
Sausalito established a reputa
tion for wicked living with its
gambling clubs and bordellos.

They have since reformed, and
now the town attracts artists as
well as tourists. Walking along
Bridgeway, you can stop to
watch street-entertainment or
step into one of the restaurants
featuring local musicians.
Xack's-by-the-Bay and
Houlihan's Old Place feature
live entertainment. Both over
look the water, and at Xack's
you can even choose to sit on
the outside patio and watch the
boats sail by. The bands —
various groups perform — play
from 9 a.m. until 11:30 a.m.
Tuesday through Saturday and
on Sundays one group from
2:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. and another
from K p.m. to 12:30 a.m. The
music is top 40 and popular new
wave.
Located on the corner of
Bridgeway and Turney, /.ack's
is a recommended choice for
evening entertainment and tasty
hamburgers. Prices are ex

tremely reasonable: Dinners are
under $6 and include
hamburgers on French rolls with
various trimmings, salad, french
fries and corn-on-the-cob.
Slightly more expensive is the
Beef Brochette, a favorite of
customers as well as the
manager, who gave it "a kiss of
excellence."
Whether you order a beer and
burger and sit back to listen to
the music or get on the dance
floor, you'll be in for a good
time at /ack's Restaurant.
Houlihan's is at the south end
of Bridgeway, where the view is
especially magnificent. Before
dusk, sailboats, motorboats and
ferries glide by on the waters
surrounding Angel Island, Bel
vedere, Tiburon and Alcatraz.
And more impressive still is the
profile of the San Francisco
skyline. By day or night, this
vantage point is one of the best
you'll find.
Such a panoramic view awaits
you at Houlihan's. The Marin

All Stars play jazz on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday evenings.
But don't arrive too early if you
want to hear them. I was there
at 7:30 on a Friday evening, and
when I left at 9:30, they were
still setting up. Providing your
company is good, you won't
miss the entertainment. Service
is very amenable, even comic,
and the menu features many
tempting dishes.
There are a number of ap
petizers including deep-fried
mushrooms or zucchini, little
pizzas, potato skins and seafood
appetizers. Choice of entrees is
extensive and includes fresh
fish. Two house specialties are
the Seafood Cioppino ($1 1.95)
and the Stuffed Chicken Breast
($7.95). Complete your meal
with a specialty drink, a Belgian
waffle, crepes, cake or ice
cream.
Like Palo Alto. Sausalito's
night life is somewhat lacking, so
you'll want to wander through
the sh(j)s and visit the other at
tractions before eating dinner.
Besides the shops and the walk
along Bridgeway, check out the
Bay Model, a mini San Fran
cisco Bay.
Its architecture is spectacular.
Covering almost three acres,
there are graphics, a multi
media program, exhibits and re
corded explanations for the
public's benefit. The model it
self is used as a scientific tool to
analyze and study bay activities
and problems. Both salt and
fresh water are pumped into the
hydraulic model, and tides ebb
and flow.
To get to the model, drive
north on Bridgeway to Harbor
Drive and then follow the signs.
If you prefer to do something
more active, you can bicycle or
go to one of the beaches or
parks in the vicinity. Muir
Beach and Stinson Beach are

only minutes north. Here you
can picnic; overnight camping,
however, is not allowed.
A few miles further is Mount
Tamalpais State Park and Muir
Woods. Both are ideal for
hiking, though if you want to
camp overnight Mt. Tamalpais
is your only option. Here you'll
find more than 200 miles of
hiking trails which provide
panoramic views of the ocean
and bay — and both bridges in
the distance. The wildlands of
Mt. Tam are especially beautiful
in spring: The grass is green and
lush, wild flowers are plentiful

the creeks are running and the
days are longer.
At the summit, which you can
get to by bus if transportation is
a problem, there's a snack bar
and the Verna Bunshee Trail.
At Muir Woods you're not
permitted to picnic or camp, yet
people flock to this peaceful,
shady park. Here, you'll find
many rare species of plants and
a rich assortment of animal life,
as well as the giant sequoia red
woods.
Once you start exploring,
you'll find the above is only a
small sample of possible places

to go and things to do in Marin
County. For many visitors, not
to mention locals, getting to
Sausalito is half the fun. Whe
ther for pure enjoyment, a
desire to avoid traffic or because
they don't have access to an au
tomobile, a number of people
cross the bay by ferry. Nor is the
ferry your only option. Tn
Sausalito you can take a cruise
or stay overnight on a sailboat,
motorboat or houseboat. .. . But
that's the topic of next week's
travel article.

Sausalito Bay isn't restricted to boats. Restaurants and private residences are also on the
water. Besides walking along the waterfront on Bridgeway, you can wander up Princess
Street or Sausalito's own version of Lombard Street.
