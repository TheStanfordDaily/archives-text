## Sun Devils heat up for Card nine 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sports writer 
For the first time since the
pro-season rankings, *the
Stanford baseball team ap
peared among the nation's
top 20 teams this week,
jumping to No. 14 after cap
turing two ot three contests
tram the USC Trojans last
weekend. The satisfaction
may be short-lived, however,
because the Cardinal travels
to Arizona State today to
begin a three-game series
against the No. 1-ranked and
Pacific-10 Conference
Southern Di\ision-leading
Sun Devils.
It is bad enough that ASU
is good, but when the Sun
Devils entertain opponents
in Tempe. they become
downright invincible. The
combination could not have
come at a worse time for
Stanford. The Card risks not
only its new ranking against
ASU hut. more importantly,
its share of second place in
the "Six-Pac" with the No.
15 Trojans.
The division winner will
receive an NCAA tourna
ment bid and the runner-up
is virtually assured of the
same reward. At 20-4 in the
conference and 45-14 on the
year, the Sun Devils have
locked up a tie for the title
and need just one more vic
tory to clinch the champion
ship. The defending cham

pion Cardinal, 14-10 in the
conference and 32-21-1
overall, will finish its league
campaign with three games
against UC-Berkeley next
week. Meanwhile. USC hosts
both the red hot Cal Bears
this week and the conference
doormat UCLA Bruins next
week.
"We're going to have our
hands full," Stanford Head
Coach Mark Marquess says
of his club's road to the
NCAA Regionals. " I can't
imagine a better team than
(Arizona State). They
deserve to be No. 1.
The Pac-10 statistics sup
port Marquess. The Sun
Devils are hitting a collective
.326 and the team earned
run average is leading
the league in both categories.
"I don't think they have a
glaring weakness." the Stan
ford skipper continued. "If
you're looking for a weak
spot, 1 don't think they're a
great defensive team, but
they make up for it. They are
a much more balanced of
fense than USC. They've got
more power throughout the
lineup — five guys have hit
10 home runs. And they'll
run too."
"We're obviously going to
have to get very good pitch
ing performances," observed
Marquess. "The ball carries
well down there, so if you get
the ball up (in the strike

/one) they're going to hit the
ball out. They're very much
like USC in that respect."
If the Sun Devils hit — or
rather fail to hit — the Card's
pitchers the way the Trojans
did last week, then Stanford
is going to return to the Farm
a few notches higher in the
national polls. Asa matter of
fact, no one has hit well
against the Stanford pitching
corps of late.
' I think that's been the
key to our success, especially
in the second half of the
season," said Marquess. "We
haven't been scoring a lot of
runs and yet we're still 7-2"
since the league season's half
way mark.
One key player during
those last nine games has
been pitcher Jeff Ballard.
The junior southpaw has
twirled threo consecutive
complete game \ ictories over
that time, raising his record
to 7-4 and lowering his F.RA
to 4.36. Ballard is second
best in the league's strikeout
and complete-game cat
egories with 76 and 5,
respectively.
Ironically, the last team to
beat Ballard was ASU. who
raked him for five first
inning runs. He gets the
starting nod in tonight's
opening contest.
John Radtke was also
roughed up by the Sun
Devils in Palo Alto, lasting

just 3Vj innings. But with a
7-2 season record and a 2.N9
ERA. second best in the
"Six-Pac." the consistent
right hander figures to pitch
to form when he makes his
starting appearance tomor
row night.
Marquess will go with
sophomore Kevin kunkel
(3-6. 4.50 ERA) in Sunday
afternoon's finale and pray
for some offense. The Card's
pilot said that in this series he
expects Stanford to "get on a
roll offensively. It's a good
hitter's park and hope
fully we can take advantage
of it."
Mike Deßenon leads the
team in hitting with a .350.
good enough to jump to No.
N in the conference. Next in
line is Darryl Stephens, who
is hitting .337 and is also cur
rently riding a 16-game hit
ting streak. Rick Lundblade
(.335, 53 RBIs) and Pete
Stanicek (.333, 40 stolen
bases) round out the Cartas
leaders. The only lineup
change is the recent insertion
of freshman Mark Machtolf
at third base in effort to
boost run production.
The Cards will be facing
Mike Thorpe (2-2, 3.96
ERA) tonight and the Pac
10's career leader in wins,
Kendall Carter (8-1, 3.26
ERA) on Sunday. Tomor
row's ASU starter has not
been determined.

game set that starts in Tempe today. ASU has been vir
tually invincible at home this year, and the last time Stan
ford faced the Sun Devils it was rudely swept ip three
straight games at Sunken Diamond.

The Cardinal will have a lot to ponder this weekend — as
freshman pitcher Rick Dietz does here — like squandering
playoff chances if they can't beat the No.l-ranked
Arizona State Sun Devils a couple of times in the three-
