# Netmen bear down for Cal

### TOM CLIFFORD 
Today marks the last dual
match of the Stanford men's
tennis team, as the Cardinal will
play host to UC-Berkeley this
afternoon at the Varsity Courts.
The Cardinal needs a good
match against Cal to give it mo
mentum before going into the
tournament for the national
championship next week.
Although they are not highly
ranked, the Bears will challenge
the Cardinal.
The last time the two teams
met. March 30. Cal played very
well and gave Stanford a scare,
jumping out to a 3-0 lead. But
the Cardinal was able to shut
the Bears down the rest of the
way and win all six remaining
matches for a 6-3 victory.
Since that match Stanford has
been on a tear. By play ing very
close to No. 1- and No. 2-
ranked USC and UCI.A and by
routing Pepperdine Wednesday,
the Cardinal has firmly estab
lished itself as the No. 3 team in
the country. The main reason
for this is the team's singles
play. Of the 10 matches since
the Cal match, the team has won
seven of them during the singles
matches.
Head Coach Dick Gould has
been very pleased with the men
tal attitude of the team. One ex
ample occurred during the Pep
perdine match, when Stanford
sophomore John Letts found
himself with his back against the
wall in the third set against
Carlos Dilaura. Letts came back
and was able to get a 7-5 vic
tory. "John wasn't playing at his
best, but still he hung in there
and didn't let down. I was very
pleased we could still beat good
teams, even when we weren't at
our best," Gould said.
The doubles teams are the big

question for the Cardinal. Each
team has proven it can beat ex
cellent teams, but on the whole,
the quad has not been overly
successful. All three of Cal's
doubles teams are very tough,
and this should be a good test
for Stanford. If the Cardinal can
play well a win could be a big

boost.
Following today's matches,
Stanford and Cal will combine
their men's and women's teams
tomorrow in Maples Pavilior.
and play World Team Tennis
style. The match is scheduled to
begin at 6 p.m. and will cost $1
with a Stanford I.D.

Eric Rosenfeld stretches to make contact with this ball. He
and the rest of the Cardinal lineup hope to reach toward the
NCAA Tournament next week with a victory in this
weekend's match against UC-Berkeley.
