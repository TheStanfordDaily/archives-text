### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis team goes into
this weekend only one victory away from a perfect
season. The netters have captured their first 20
matches of the season, and only UCLA stands be
tween the Cardinal and win No. 21.
The Bruins are no pushovers, though. They
were ranked No. 4 in the nation in the April
NCAA poll, and nearly upset Stanford before fal

singles competition, defeating teammate and

2-6, 7-5. Fendick is Stanford's top singles player

Eldredge also recorded a pair of impressive vic

Kelly Henry, the No. 10 player in the nation, to
advance to the semi-finals, where she knocked off
San Diego State's Cynthia McGregor, ranked No.
21,6-3, 6-1.
Elise Burgin seems to have recovered from the
back injury that sidelined her for the first 10
weeks of the season, as she teamed with Linda
Gates to win the collegiate doubles competition.
The pair defeated Cindy Neeld and Lisa Berry ot
San Diego State in the finals by a 3-6, 6-2, 6-2
margin.
Kate Gompert continued her winning ways as
well, finishing first in the invitational singles
bracket, which featured high school and profes

Gompert disposed of UCLA's Lynn Lewis,
