# Women seek perfect finish
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis team goes into
this weekend only one victory away from a perfect
season. The netters have captured their first 20
matches of the season, and only UCLA stands be
tween the Cardinal and win No. 21.
The Bruins are no pushovers, though. They
were ranked No. 4 in the nation in the April
NCAA poll, and nearly upset Stanford before fal
ling, 5-4. down in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal appears to be primed, though.
Last weekend at the Ojai Collegiate Champion
ships, Stanford players captured individual titles
in three of the four divisions as well as the team
championship. The Cardinal finished with 16
points, to 10 for San Diego State and nine for
use.
Leigh Anne Eldredge turned in a surprise per
formance in that tournament. Eldredge, usually
the Cardinal's No. 4 player and only ranked No.
44 in the April NCAA poll, won the collegiate
singles competition, defeating teammate and

doubles partner Patty Fendick in the finals. 6-2,
2-6, 7-5. Fendick is Stanford's top singles player
and was ranked No. 3 in the NCAA.
Eldredge also recorded a pair of impressive vic
tories en route to the finals. She defeated USCs
Kelly Henry, the No. 10 player in the nation, to
advance to the semi-finals, where she knocked off
San Diego State's Cynthia McGregor, ranked No.
21,6-3, 6-1.
Elise Burgin seems to have recovered from the
back injury that sidelined her for the first 10
weeks of the season, as she teamed with Linda
Gates to win the collegiate doubles competition.
The pair defeated Cindy Neeld and Lisa Berry ot
San Diego State in the finals by a 3-6, 6-2, 6-2
margin.
Kate Gompert continued her winning ways as
well, finishing first in the invitational singles
bracket, which featured high school and profes
sional players as well as collegiate competitors.
Gompert disposed of UCLA's Lynn Lewis,
ranked No. 24 in the NCAA, in
the finals, 6-2, 6-2. Gompert,
herself ranked No. 17 in the
NCAA, also defeated Leah An
tonopolis, ranked No. 65 in the
World Tennis Association pro
fessional rankings, in winning
that title.
If the Cardinal can win that
convincingly Sunday, it appears
UCLA should not pose a major
obstacle to a perfect regular
season. Don't bank on that,
though. The Bruins are led by
Elizabeth Minter, a freshman
from Melbourne, Australia,
who has compiled a 29-8 record
in gaining a No. 7 ranking.
Second singles player Patricia
Hy, a freshman from Hong
Kong, is ranked No. 11, and No.
3 player Karen Dewis, from
London, Ontario, rounds out
the Bruins' foreign contingent.
Lewis will likely start at fourth
singles for UCLA.
Tomorrow night the netters
will take a break from their dual
match schedule when they join
forces with the men's team in a
mixed match against UC-
Berkeley.
That match will feature men's
and women's singles and
doubles, along with two mixed
doubles matches. Each match
will be only one set, and team
score will be determined by
games won.
The indoor matches have
proven popular, averaging
crowds of more than 5000
during the past 10 years.
The Stanford women have

defeated the Bears twice in out
door dual matches earlier this
year.
Stanford currently stands at
20-0 overall and has clinched
the WCAA title with a 13-0
conference record so far. Sun
day's match marks the end of
the regular season for the net
ters, who will then have a week

off until the NCAA Champion
ships begin May 12 in Los
Angleles.
The NCAAs will feature both
a team tournament with the top
16 teams in the country and in
dividual competition in both
singles and doubles.
The Cardinal was ranked No.
2 in the April poll, behind

Trinity, but Trinity has since lost
a match to UCLA, so the Card
will likely carry a No. 1 ranking
into the NCAAs.
Tomorrow night's mixed
match against Cal begins at 6
p.m. Pavilion, while Sunday af
ternoon's WCAA finale against
UCLA is slated for noon at the
Varsity Tennis Courts.
