### RICHARD LYNCH Daily staff 
Balance is the key to suc
cess — both in athletics and
academics — Stanford Track
Director Brooks Johnson
told a group of students last
night in a campus panel dis
cussion.
"Stanford has gone as far
to fulfill the Grecian ideal of
balance between mind and
body as any school 1 know.
The combination of superior
academics, superior athletics
is outstanding, no other place
compares," Johnson said.
In the Serra House discus
sion, Johnson repeatedly em
phasized the importance of
balance in a Stanford educa
tion and the role athletics
plays in enhancing the expe
rience of those who partici
pate.
Johnson said his biggest
problem in coaching track
was "trying to crank people
back to reality; the problem
is not motivation, it's getting
people to deal with real
world." He noted that he
wanted his athletes to
overcome the fear of failing
and simply "do the best job
they can."
Johnson's overall goal in
coaching is to "maximize

(the athletes') chances of
being successful." All of the
coaches who attended the
discussion echoed the belief
that varsity athletics, as well
as other extracurricular ac
tivities, play a vital role in ac
hieving that success.
"Being involved in an ex
tracurricular activity that is
'time consuming,' (provides)
pressure and all those other
good things is the best way to
assure that you will get a very
enriching and rewarding and
multi-faceted experience,
and the best way to get your
butt into graduate school,"
Johnson said.
Jim Walsh, assistant foot
ball coach for running backs
and special teams, also
stressed the potential for ath
letes to profit from the var
sity experience. He
"The ticket is using athletics;
don't let it use you."
Tom Beckett, assistant
director of athletics, il
lustrated Walsh's point by
explaining, "I know I prob
ably wouldn't have gotten
my education if I hadn't had
to maintain my eligibility (for
baseball), and now I cer
tainly appreciate that oppor
tunity."
Johnson typified the
coaches' belief that varsity

sports provide athletes the
opportunity to confront the
real world from the safety ot
"a sandbox," allowing them
to learn about the pressures,
demands and responsibilty of
the real world without the
risks.
Johnson did have some
criticism for those whom he
feels do not appreciate the
role of athletics in the Uni
versity, specifically the Ad
missions Office. He said he
believes the Admissions Of
fice is "discrimination gone
crazy." He said the the Ad
missions Office expects more
from the athletes it admits
than it does from the non
athletes.
He stated that 95 percent
of male athletes graduate in
four years, and only 73 per
cent of the entire student
body complete degrees in
four years. "We shouldn't
have to be better," Johnson
noted.
"The admissions policy,"
Johnson claimed, "should be
adjusted until the drop-out
rate is the same for athletes
and the general student
body, but it's not that way
here; you have a double
standard."
