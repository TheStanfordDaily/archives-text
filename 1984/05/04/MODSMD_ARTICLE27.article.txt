Looking at our last names, one
might doubt our credibility as connois
seurs of Japanese food. After all, the
most skeptical of you may ask how
non-Japanese people can even begin
to appreciate the subtleties of raw fish,
the delectability of seaweed, and the
down-home goodness of rice that, of all
things sticks together. So with the as
surance that both of our names hide a
partial Japanese heritage and experi
ence in the traditional delicacies, we
hope that even the most doubtful of
you will have more faith in this ap
praisal.
Upon entering Kiyoshi's, a very au
thentic Japanese restaurant in Menlo
Park, we were greeted by the tradi
tional welcome, assyaimase. Although
we didn't have reservations, a
kimono-clad waitress led us to our
seats immediately. From there we sur
veyed our surroundings, which con
sisted of two small dining rooms and a
tatami (straw floor mat) room for
diners who want to sit on the floor.
The atmosphere was simple, pleasant
and soothing, a relaxing respite from
the more hectic life of academia.
Japanese music added a nice touch, at
least until we began to hear the same
refrain for the 12th time.
No lazy eaters are encouraged at
this restaurant. Silverware was ex
cluded from the place setting (but this
shouldn't discourage you — we're sure
you'd get a fork if you asked for it).
After ordering, we hardly had a
chance for conversation — food
arrived constantly. For appetizers, we
chose tempura (prawns and vegetables
deep-fried in batter) and tekka maki
(raw tuna and rice wrapped in
seaweed . . . you know, sushi). Prices
of the appetizers ranged from $3 to
$6. The tempura was excellent,
remaining crisp throughout our din
ner. The tekka maki was equally tasty.
One word of caution: The wasabi

(horseradish root) meant to enhance
the flavor of the tekka maki has the
potential to completely obliterate
your sinuses.
The selection of drinks consisted of
sake (rice wine). Japanese and domes
tic beers, soft drinks and plum wine,
which even a teetotaler like Ken
would (and did) enjoy.
Following a small side dish,
sukimono (pickled cabbage) and some
savory misojiru (light broth with tofu
and green onions), the main courses
arrived. The salmon teriyaki,
charbroiled fish topped with teriyaki
sauce, was slightly fatty and under
cooked.
We recommend that you make an
other choice from the menu, which in
cludes chicken and steak teriyaki, ton
katsu (pork cutlets), fried oysters,
broiled eel and combination dinners of
tempura or sashimi with chicken or
steak teriyaki.
To stimulate the visual as well as
gustatory senses, Kiyoshi's also offers
dinners cooked at your own table.
Most of these are for two people and
include teppan yaki (steak, scallops,
prawns, and vegetables), shabu shabu
(meat and vegetables in a stew). The
prices of the dinners range from $8.50
to $16.95 which is fairly standard for
good Japanese food.
But getting back to our dinners. The
sashimi (raw fish) was quite good.
Those who are unacquainted with it,
however, may have trouble arriving at
the same conclusion. In that case a
safer choice is the chicken teriyaki,
which was delectable, although the
skin seemed a bit chewy.
For dessert we had a choice of man
darin oranges, orange sherbet and
green tea (yes, green tea) ice cream.
Try the ice cream if you're feeling ad
venturous. Otherwise, stick with the
sherbet or oranges.
In short, the cooks at Kiyoshi's
would give both our native Japanese
mothers a run for their yen.
