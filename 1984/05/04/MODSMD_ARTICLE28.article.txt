# Genteel atmosphere is its strong suit

Gatehouse Restaurant and Bar
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto

The Gatehouse has an elegant atmo
sphere, both inside and out, a terrific menu
with prices that seem reasonable consider
ing we live in one of the most expensive
areas in the country and a location that even
the bicycle-bound could handle. In fact, it
seemed like a great find, but unfortunately
our lunch there was not as good as we had
hoped. However, I have heard it is very
good for dinner and has an excellent
brunch, so I think I'll try it again and hope
for wiser menu selections.
The restaurant is not far down on Lytton

the color scheme) and watching the
business-looking types at the surrounding
tables.
The lunch menu has something for the
gourmet and the not-so-gourmet. Pate,
fresh salmon and tortellini share the menu
with the Gatehouse Burger and the tuna
melt. The prices range from $4.25 to $N. 5().
Prosciutto and melon ($4.85), stuffed
avocado with bay shrimp ($6.50) and the
steak sandwich ($8.50) are among the many
choices.
Our selection was the Calamari Steak
Dore and the Stagedoor Sandwich, which
was an open-faced turkey and guacamole
sandwich with mornay sauce.
The calamari came with soup or salad and
I thought the choice of chicken lemon mint

and rice it came with made a good combina
tion and the hutter with a trace of lemon on
the vegetables went well with the dish..
The side dish of coleslaw with the sand
wich had a good blend of flavors, hut be
cause the plate was hot. it was warm by the
time it was served and wasn't at its best. The
pickle suffered a similar fate.
As we ate we couldn't help noticing that
the seafood salads being served at the next
table were large and tempting.
Several of the items on the menu are
marked as being served salt-free. The
calamari, for example, was among the list.
It's nice to have this option without having
to make a fuss, and if you like salt there's al
ways the shaker.
The menu for dinner looks great with a

Avenue, which runs parallel to University
Avenue and has a rather genteel dining
room and a large patio for outside dining.
Since we ate lunch there on a sunny day, the
yellow and white umbrellas, the brick and
flowers on the patio fit our mood very well.
Even so, the dining room with its dark
wood, flowers and very rich look was still a
temptation.
It's the kind of place where dressing for
dinner seems appropriate.
We walked in through the bar, which
looked like a place to go for drinks when
you feel like listening to classical music and
perhaps having a light dinner. Since 2:15
p.m. classes were in our plans, we forewent
the pleasure.
The lunch was leisurely paced and we
enjoyed sitting in the sun drinking our water
(complete with lemon which complemented

soup was a good one. Large pieces of
chicken and herbs highlight the slightly
lemony light soup, and the total effect was
very good.
Our entrees, however, were a slight let
down. The turkey and guacamole sandwich
was one of the less attractive looking
entrees I've seen â€” with a dark green
guacamole and a light orange sauce that
looked like it had been sitting for a few
minutes before being served. Of course, if
something tastes good it is irrelevant how it
looks, but the mornay sauce was a bit heavy
and not very flavorful and the guacamole
not exceptional.
The calamari was different than I've ever
had it. It was a fairly large piece and was
tender and flaky. It seemed almost like a
white fish of some kind and was served in an
egg batter which was good. The zucchini

good selection of fish, chicken, steak and
salads. Dinner could start with an appetizer
of Fettucini Alfredo, move on to Steak au
Poivre Pavilion (with cognac, scallion,
mushrooms and peppercorns) and finish
with Gatehouse Sorbet. It sounds tempting
and the entree prices run from $8.95 to
$14.85 and include soup or salad and a
choice of rice or potato.
The Gatehouse's wine list features mostly
California wines at fairly high prices, though
the house wines from Mendocino Vineyards
are $5.75 a bottle. The desserts range from
fresh fruit to chocolate mousse torte.
Let's face it, the atmosphere counts a lot
in the restaurant world, and I think the
Gatehouse has a strong suit here. Just take a
little more care in ordering and I think
you'll enjoy your meal.
