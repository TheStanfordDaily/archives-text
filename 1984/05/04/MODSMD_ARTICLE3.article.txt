Peking. China.
Lewis opened the forum with a brief
introduction describing the history ol
U.S.-China relations in the past,
touching on the false sense of euph
oria that followed former President
Nixon's visit to China and also on the
recent tense relations over China-
Soviet Union and U.S.-Taiwan in
volvements.
"President Reagan's visit marks a
symbolic change in U.S.-China rela
tions. It is important that conservative
presidents, like Reagan and Nixon,
make the trek to China." he con
cluded.
Fingar began his analysis ot the trip
with a brief summary of the events
that took place. "During the six-day
xisit. there were six hours ot sub
stantive discussions, resulting in the
signing of several agreements, a tax
treaty, a cultural agreement and a
statement on peaceful nuclear power.
"The tax treaty, which was tinali/ed
during Secretary (of the 1 reasury
Donafd) Regan's visit." Fingar ex
plained. "will protect American lirms
from double taxation and is an abso
lute requirement for American busi
ness investments in China.
Hie cultural agreement is designed
to assure China of social and cultural

protection against American sociocul
tural invasion, an issue which has been
concerning Chinese officials, he said.
The statement on peaceful nuclear
power is. in ettect, a "we trust you
solution wherein China agrees not to
transfer any spent fuel without con
sulting the United States and the
United States agrees not to halt the
free flow of technological exchange.
Fingar explained.

In addition. Fingar outlined the in
ternational issues which Reagan and
the Chinese officials discussed, includ
ing Taiwan. Central America, the
Middle Fast and South Africa. Fingar
reported that the Chinese expressed
displeasure with American
"meddling" in Central America, with
American activities 111 the Middle Flast
and with American deployment of nu
clear warheads in Lurope. However,
the Chinese agreed with the I S. posi
tion on South America.
When describing the effects ot the
trip. Fingar said. " Reagan should see a
six to eight point rise in his popularity,
although the visit will probably be for
gotten by November."

The most important part of the trip,
though, is that "Reagan has identified
himself with a policy initiated four
presidents ago. He has been consistent
with previous U.S.-China com
muniques but inconsistent with his
previous campaign statements," said
Fingar.
"The personal exposure of the two
leaders to each other is crucial," he
said. "They realized that neither one

of them has horns or is completely
fa natical.
"The trip has validated and
legitimized both sides and their
respective views to each other, he
concluded.
Maogong. summarizing the trip s
significance from a Chinese perspec
tive. said. "China is willing to develop
relations with the United States as
long as the U.S. acts according to
mutual respect for sovereignty, mutual
non-aggression, equality and peaceful
coexistence. China's policy of opening
to the world is not expediency, but a
long term policy."
Maogong stated that the area open
to deteriorating U.S.-China relations

is the Taiwan issue. "1 think that over
the years, the U.S. government has
paid lip service to the fundamental
principles about China, its govern
ment and Taiwan," he said. "In
practice, the U.S. has acted as if there
were two Chinas and has encroached
upon China's sovereignty."
China views its problems with
Taiwan as an internal affair, which will
eventually result in the unification of
Taiwan with the mainland, said
Maogong. "We will allow two differ
ent systems within one China. The in
terests of the Taiwan people will not
be infringed upon. Once the Taiwan
problem is solved, U.S. relations will
improve."
About Reagan's visit, Maogong
said, "This visit will have a far
reaching influence to the development
of U.S.-China relations. These rela
tions are just sprouting and need very
careful handling. It requires open
communication and mutual respect
between the two countries."
In response to a request for a more
detailed explanation about the China-
Taiwan relationship. Maogong said.
"What we want is that there is only
one China. We are a homogeneous
nation — the people of both sides of
the strait — we are all brothers and
sisters. We have no reason to struggle,
to hate each other."
Lewis summed up his thoughts
about China's concerns during
Reagan's \isit: "The Chinese are
trying to make the general point that
you Americans have gone too far.
You've got to maintain a balanced
view of the So\iets and not swing
wildly militaristic."
Maogong supported this analysis,
concluding. "We. China, hope to ease
the tension between the two super
powers — the United States and the
So\iet Union. We are encouraging
talks between their leaders and arms
control,"

though, is that "Reagan has identified
himself with a policy initiated four
presidents ago. He has been consistent
with previous U.S.-China com
muniques but inconsistent with his
previous campaign statements," said
Fingar.
"The personal exposure of the two
leaders to each other is crucial," he
said. "They realized that neither one

of them has horns or is completely
fa natical.
"The trip has validated and
legitimized both sides and their
respective views to each other, he
concluded.
Maogong. summarizing the trip s
significance from a Chinese perspec
tive. said. "China is willing to develop
relations with the United States as
long as the U.S. acts according to
mutual respect for sovereignty, mutual
non-aggression, equality and peaceful
coexistence. China's policy of opening
to the world is not expediency, but a
long term policy."
Maogong stated that the area open
to deteriorating U.S.-China relations

is the Taiwan issue. "1 think that over
the years, the U.S. government has
paid lip service to the fundamental
principles about China, its govern
ment and Taiwan," he said. "In
practice, the U.S. has acted as if there
were two Chinas and has encroached
upon China's sovereignty."
China views its problems with
Taiwan as an internal affair, which will
eventually result in the unification of
Taiwan with the mainland, said
Maogong. "We will allow two differ
ent systems within one China. The in
terests of the Taiwan people will not
be infringed upon. Once the Taiwan
problem is solved, U.S. relations will
improve."
About Reagan's visit, Maogong
said, "This visit will have a far
reaching influence to the development
of U.S.-China relations. These rela
tions are just sprouting and need very
careful handling. It requires open
communication and mutual respect
between the two countries."
In response to a request for a more
detailed explanation about the China-
Taiwan relationship. Maogong said.
"What we want is that there is only
one China. We are a homogeneous
nation — the people of both sides of
the strait — we are all brothers and
sisters. We have no reason to struggle,
to hate each other."
Lewis summed up his thoughts
about China's concerns during
Reagan's \isit: "The Chinese are
trying to make the general point that
you Americans have gone too far.
You've got to maintain a balanced
view of the So\iets and not swing
wildly militaristic."
Maogong supported this analysis,
concluding. "We. China, hope to ease
the tension between the two super
powers — the United States and the
So\iet Union. We are encouraging
talks between their leaders and arms
control,"

'."The most important outcome ot
President Reagan's visit to China is
the direct contact and dialogue be
tween the two leaders." Guo
Maogong told 50 listeners at the Cen
ter for Fast Asian Studies colloquium
yesterday in the Lou Henry Hoover
Building.
The colloquium, entitled "Reagan s
China Visit: A Prelimimary Assess
ment." featured Political Science Prot.
John I ewis. Tom Fingar. director ot
the U.S.-China Relations Program at
Stanford and Maogong. who is from
the Institute of International Studies.
Peking. China.
Lewis opened the forum with a brief
introduction describing the history ol
U.S.-China relations in the past,
touching on the false sense of euph
oria that followed former President
Nixon's visit to China and also on the
recent tense relations over China-
Soviet Union and U.S.-Taiwan in
volvements.
"President Reagan's visit marks a
symbolic change in U.S.-China rela
tions. It is important that conservative
presidents, like Reagan and Nixon,
make the trek to China." he con
cluded.
Fingar began his analysis ot the trip
with a brief summary of the events
that took place. "During the six-day
xisit. there were six hours ot sub
stantive discussions, resulting in the
signing of several agreements, a tax
treaty, a cultural agreement and a
statement on peaceful nuclear power.
"The tax treaty, which was tinali/ed
during Secretary (of the 1 reasury
Donafd) Regan's visit." Fingar ex
plained. "will protect American lirms
from double taxation and is an abso
lute requirement for American busi
ness investments in China.
Hie cultural agreement is designed
to assure China of social and cultural

protection against American sociocul
tural invasion, an issue which has been
concerning Chinese officials, he said.
The statement on peaceful nuclear
power is. in ettect, a "we trust you
solution wherein China agrees not to
transfer any spent fuel without con
sulting the United States and the
United States agrees not to halt the
free flow of technological exchange.
Fingar explained.

In addition. Fingar outlined the in
ternational issues which Reagan and
the Chinese officials discussed, includ
ing Taiwan. Central America, the
Middle Fast and South Africa. Fingar
reported that the Chinese expressed
displeasure with American
"meddling" in Central America, with
American activities 111 the Middle Flast
and with American deployment of nu
clear warheads in Lurope. However,
the Chinese agreed with the I S. posi
tion on South America.
When describing the effects ot the
trip. Fingar said. " Reagan should see a
six to eight point rise in his popularity,
although the visit will probably be for
gotten by November."

The most important part of the trip,
though, is that "Reagan has identified
himself with a policy initiated four
presidents ago. He has been consistent
with previous U.S.-China com
muniques but inconsistent with his
