## Elvis Costello Live 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Waiting in line upstairs at Tresidder
on a Sunday morning two months ago,
I thought to myself, "This had better
be good."
I'd rolled myself out of bed early to
be one of the first callers on the
charge-by-phone ticket line. But all
the lines were busy, so I pulled on a
dirty pair of jeans and dashed for
Tresidder. An hour later, I was back in
bed, tickets in the desk, but not really

knowing what I'd got.
"Elvis Costello

in a solo con-

L cert," the

tickets said.

Hmm. Elvis on the
road without the At
tractions was a
strange thought.
That Elvis' most
recent album was

nine months old made it

stranger still.
With no album to plug, Elvis had
little reason to tour. But there it was
on the ticket. "Elvis Costello in a solo
concert."
( I didn't know what to expect then.
And Saturday night as we sat down
inside the Warfield Theatre, 1 still
didn't know what to expect.
I couldn't have expected what 1 got.
Sure, anybody could have an
ticipated a tine show, the kind Elvis
Costello always puts on. But not this
kind of show.

It was strange from the beginning.
T-Bone Burnett, a favorite of

musicians like Pete Townshend

and Elvis Costello and not much

of anybody else, walked on
stage as the opening act.

Faking a Jerry Lee Lewis
i piano jam and snapping his

fingers through an a
capella version of Roger
Miller's "King of the

Road," T-Bone prepared

the audience for a strange

night before moving on to his own ma
terial.
After bows to Elvis Presley, Spam
and Motel 6, T-Bone left the stage
and, moments later, Elvis appeared.
Dressed in a blue polyester suit and
a psychedelic rayon shirt, Elvis
strummed an acoustic guitar
tentatively before breaking into
"Accidents Will Happen."
Accompanied only by his acoustic
guitar, Elvis sang more clearly than in
his last tour, where he competed with
the Attractions, the T.K.O. Horns and
Afrodiziak, two female backup sing
ers.
And, more than ever before, Elvis
showed a a sense of humor. Looking
back at a dozen guitars waiting on
stage for his use, Elvis introduced his
"very special guest, Elvis Costello and
his guitar army. Actually, Blue Oyster

Cult will be on a little later."
And when fans in the balcony
started to snap their fingers to "Green
Shirt," Elvis admonished them with
four loud attacks on the strings of his
Telecaster.
Later, he deadpanned his way
through a cover of The Specials'
"Your Girlfriend is What 1 Like Best
About You."
As his second of four encores, Elvis
performed a country and western set
with T-Bone Burnett. The pair, calling
themselves the Cowers, strummed and
sang their way through a half dozen
country tunes, looking not unlike
Buck Owens and Roy Rogers on Hee
Haw.
Burnett then explained the current
controversy over the city's official
song and began singing the introduc
tion to "I Left My Heart in San Fran
cisco" before the duo broke into their

own proposal, the 1960s classic "San
Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Some
Flowers in your Hair)."
But when it came to Elvis' own
songs, he captured every bit of emo
tion the songs have to offer, all made
more pure by his solitary figure,
strumming a guitar or fingering his
grand or electric piano.
"Motel Matches," "Everyday I
Write the Book," "Alison," "Man
Called Uncle," and many others
played solo were somehow more grip
ping than the full-accompaniment ver
sions, but "Mystery Dance," "Mouth
Almighty" and other beat-conscious
tunes lost their punch.
Elvis introduced a number of new
songs, probably for his follow-up al
bum to last summer's "Punch the
Clock." With only simple accompani
ment, it's hard to tell what sort of mu-

sical direction Elvis will take now —
he's already done rock 'n' roll,
Motown, pseudo-classical, piano bar
and country-western albums — but
the content of the songs is more politi
cal than his more personal previous ef
forts.
Tied to "Shipbuilding," a tragic
story of a shipbuilder's son who is
killed in one of his father's ships, the
new political songs made for an emo
tional — albeit not surprising — peace
statement from Elvis, whose previous
sorrows have usually fallen in the out
of-love man range.
But Elvis wasn't out of love at the
Warfield Saturday The crowd
called him back for four encores and
begged for a fifth. As the house lights
came on the fans left happy, knowing
they'd seen yet another side of the
complicated Elvis Costello, but still not
sure what to expect next.
