# 'Quartermaine's Terms' uncertain
## 
### MARC FAJER 
"Quartermaine's Terms," ae
claimed one ot 1983's 10 best
plavs by all and sundry in New
York last season, opened last
Keek at the Marines Memorial
Theater in San Francisco in a
production that apparently w;>
hot the one that received tin- ac
colades of the Big Apple. V. iilc
some of the acting was on
net, too much of it was not and
much ot the humor and poig
nant insight into human lives fell
llat.

The play is about the lives of
six teachers and a principal at an
English school for foreigners in
Cambridge. Over the course of
a couple of years we watch the
small crises and little victories
that make up their days all
cloaked in a heavy blanket of
British bluffness and civility. If
the point is that these people are
not really connecting with each
other and are desperately reach
' ing out to be helped; that does

'me across, hut the presenta
tion of their problems was never
convincing enough or moving
enough to involve me very
much While a few emotional
outbursts really caught the at
tention. most of the crucial mo
nk its Hi the play did not work
(in part because no one in the
east c ulu burst into tears with
~n\ vciisimilitude, though they
ci rtainly .ill tried.) The dialogue
was rot particularly exciting
either, and there seemed an
endless amount of the mindless

formalities that are such a large
part of life, though perhaps do
not belong on stage — "And
how is Camellia and little
Tommy? How are the children?
How is Nigel? How was your
half-term?" repeated endlessly.
The characters were all
supposed to be fairly bright
people who were not quite good
enough to be some place more
fulfilling. G. Wood played
Rtidie Ljoomis, one of the two

principals, and gave the best
performance. Eddie is an old
fuss-budget concerned with
keeping order and keeping
things running with the appear
ance of tranquility. His constant
harping over time, his empty in
quiries into people's lives and
his near total immersion in the
existence of the school are v\ell
brought out, and Wood does a
superb job aging as well. James
Rav plavs St. John Ouarter
mainc, the faculty member who
has been at the school always. He
is Iriendlv. fort 1 tliil and nearly
useless in the classroom, but his
effusive wa 1 tter inol
fensiveness rest of
the teachers >pi up to him.
He has no otlu fe beside the
school, and here is continuing
(small) d ima about people
planning things with him and
then cancelling. Ray is very
believable in the part, but the

The characters were
all supposed to be
fairly bright people
who were not quite
good enough to be
someplace more ful
filling.

overwhelming cheerfulness ulti
mately becomes tiresome with
out ever touching us.
The rest of the performances
are somewhat uneven. Michael
McGuire is adequate as the
overbearing Henry; he is in his
element when expounding the
virtues of the school or talking
about dealing with students but
does not handle the emotional
scenes about his family well,
katherine Helmond (of "Soap"
fame) is occasionally fascinating
as Melanie, a strange spinster.
She starts out under the thumb
of her estranged mother, and
when the old woman dies, first
finds religion and them seems to
take to drink. There is intermit
tently an odd wildness in her,
and she does emotion better
than anyone else on stage. But
she ultimately is not able to
bring all the changes in the char
acter to life. Bill Buell is funny
as a young man just hired as the
play begins. He is dedicated to
teaching and apparently good at
it, but he is also accident prone

and nut quite as genteel as the
the rest of the faculty. so he has
a eonstant uphill battle to fit in.
Buell also however, tails apart
when he has to he emotional.
David Hunt Stafford and Holly
Villaire round out the cast as an
aspiring novelist and the wife of
a philanderer respectively.
For a play about the problems
of small lives to work, the acting
must be superb and the script
must either be very funny or
convey a sense of poetry of their
existence. The humor in this
play, which was apparently ob
vious in previous productions,
was not very noticeable in this
one. The language was uninspir
ing. the mundane repetition was
evident but it never achieved
anything more than boredom.
Finally, the acting was not up to
par. "Quartermaine's Terms"
will play at the Marines
Memorial through May 20.
There are a few moments that
are worth seeing, but on the
whole, it is not a terrific show.


G. Wood portrays the headmaster and James Ray the aging
instructor in "Quartermaine's Terms," now playing at the
Marines Memorial Theater through May 20.


James Ray, David Hunt Staffort and Holly Villaire star in Simon Gray's comedy-drama,
"Quartermaine's Terms."

the point is that these people are

(in part because no one in the

was rot particularly exciting

endless amount of the mindless

formalities that are such a large

not belong on stage — "And

Tommy? How are the children?
How is Nigel? How was your

The characters were all
supposed to be fairly bright
people who were not quite good
enough to be some place more
fulfilling. G. Wood played
Rtidie Ljoomis, one of the two

principals, and gave the best
performance. Eddie is an old
fuss-budget concerned with
keeping order and keeping
things running with the appear
ance of tranquility. His constant
harping over time, his empty in
quiries into people's lives and
his near total immersion in the
existence of the school are v\ell
brought out, and Wood does a
superb job aging as well. James

overwhelming cheerfulness ulti
mately becomes tiresome with
out ever touching us.
The rest of the performances
are somewhat uneven. Michael
McGuire is adequate as the
overbearing Henry; he is in his
element when expounding the
virtues of the school or talking
about dealing with students but
does not handle the emotional
scenes about his family well,
katherine Helmond (of "Soap"
fame) is occasionally fascinating
as Melanie, a strange spinster.
She starts out under the thumb
of her estranged mother, and
when the old woman dies, first
finds religion and them seems to
take to drink. There is intermit
tently an odd wildness in her,
and she does emotion better
than anyone else on stage. But
she ultimately is not able to
bring all the changes in the char
acter to life. Bill Buell is funny
as a young man just hired as the
play begins. He is dedicated to
teaching and apparently good at
it, but he is also accident prone

and nut quite as genteel as the
the rest of the faculty. so he has
a eonstant uphill battle to fit in.
Buell also however, tails apart
when he has to he emotional.
David Hunt Stafford and Holly
Villaire round out the cast as an
aspiring novelist and the wife of
a philanderer respectively.
For a play about the problems
of small lives to work, the acting
must be superb and the script
must either be very funny or
convey a sense of poetry of their
existence. The humor in this
play, which was apparently ob
vious in previous productions,
was not very noticeable in this
one. The language was uninspir
ing. the mundane repetition was
evident but it never achieved
anything more than boredom.
Finally, the acting was not up to
par. "Quartermaine's Terms"
will play at the Marines
Memorial through May 20.
There are a few moments that
are worth seeing, but on the
whole, it is not a terrific show.


G. Wood portrays the headmaster and James Ray the aging
instructor in "Quartermaine's Terms," now playing at the
Marines Memorial Theater through May 20.


James Ray, David Hunt Staffort and Holly Villaire star in Simon Gray's comedy-drama,
