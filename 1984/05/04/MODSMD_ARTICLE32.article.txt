# Keystone seeks college student crowd
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
One of my few gripes about Stanford
(and 1 don't have many) is the fact that
too many students are prone to treat
Stanford as an "all encompassing
country club."
By never leaving the Stanford country
club, these students are depriving them
selves of exploring the fascinating Bay
Area, which includes Stanford's own
backyard, Palo Alto. And musically,
Palo Alto has one of the finest rock clubs
in the Bay Area, which is the Keystone
Palo Alto. Located a couple blocks east
of El Camino Real at 260 California Av
enue, it has always shocked me that the
majority of Stanford students have no
idea that there exists a rock club in Palo
Alto, let alone one that is only a five
minute bike ride from campus.
Since it is in such a prime location, it
should be a frequented night spot for stu
dents. After all, there is nothing like a
shot of good music to relieve the pres
sures of academic life (especially when
the drinks at the Keystone aren't more
than those at the highly frequented
"Goose"). However, even with the addi
tion of top musical talent, the Keystone
has never really caught on with Stanford
students.
This problem is of critical concern to
Mark Lando, the young promotion head
at the Keystone Palo Alto. He, too, has

tried to make Stanford students more
aware of the Keystone's presence.
As a rock club for more than nine
years, the Keystone features some of the
finest musical performers in the nation in
all styles of music. Whether it's rock 'n'
roll, new wave, reggae, heavy metal or
blues, the Keystone has had it and will
continue to have it. Where else could you
see such diverse performers as Warren-
Xevon, George Thorogood, the Tubes,
The Band, Bonnie Hayes and The Wild
Combo, John Lee Hooker, The
Ramones and Clarence demons (where
Bruce Springsteen made a surprise guest
appearance the last time he played). Not
only that, but the Keystone itself, is an
intimate, comfortable and acoustically
excellent rock club with a dance floor,
bar and kitchen.
The problem though lies in the virtual
absence of college students. Lando was
quick to point out to me that he has found
it extremely hard to create any strong
type of musical interaction with Stan
ford, including K/.SU, our college radio
station, which, ironically enough,
prominently features the very same acts
who perform at the Keystone. Whether
it's promotional tie-ins with K/.SU or
co-sponsorships with the ASSU (through
which students could receive price dis
counts on the cover charge and drinks
with their Stanford l.D.s, the problem

has been that tar too few students know
about the Keystone.
Lando also was keen to point out that
he'd rather encourage the college-aged
crowd to frequent the Keystone because
he feels it would be far more artistically
rewarding (in addition to the obvious fin
ancial benefits) since it would keep the
younger new wave bands, who dominate
the listening habits of college students,
performing at the club. If not, the club
would have to rely on the heavy metal
tie-ins with major rock stations KOME
and KSJO, which is a losing proposition
in the long run.
Overall, the Keystone needs to "cover
all the bases" in its attempts to survive.
As lar as its business procedures are con
cerned, it functions on a "day-to-day
basis, as one band rolls in on a
nationwide tour . . . and rolls out just as
quickly as a new one rolls in." Therefore,
there arc few "constancies."
Naturally, the club needs to move with
the times to survive, and they are ex
panding into new areas. They are already
in the process of installing two large
video screens (one for the stage area and
one for over the bar) in order to compete
in the growing video market.
"One has to change with the times, yet
without alienating the 'old steadies,' "
Lando explained.
