Olympiad (1936-38)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Lcni Riefenstahl's filmed
document of the 1936 Olympics
has influenced all sports footage
since, probably, but none has
ever surpassed it. Rjefenstahl
was Hitler's personal choice to
direct this film, but though her
propaganda movie Triumph of
the Will, released four years ear
lier, still tills one with as much
revulsion as admiration,
Olympiad is untainted by politi
cal sentiment: Her aesthetic ap
preciation of the athletes
extends to the great black run
ner, Jesse Owens, and to the
Japanese pole vaulters. A film of
great sculptural beauty.
Plays Monday.

Breathless (I960)
Cubberley Auditorium
"It's normal: Squealers
squeal, burglars burgle, killers
kill and lovers love," says Michel
Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo),
the hero of Jean-Luc Godard's
vivifying film, one of the
landmarks of the French New
Wave. Like Truffaut in Shoot the
Piano Player, Godard recasts the
American gangster pictures so
beloved of post-war French
audiences in a new, startling
mold that is at once jokey, self
referential and unsettling. The
main characters, Michel and his
beautifully, morally blank girl
friend Patricia (Jean Seberg),
are in love with style. A great
film, with a hypnotic perfor
mance from Belmondo.
Plays Monday evening at K.
Meet John Doe (1941)
Kresge Auditorium
At first, this Frank Capra
movie, written by Robert Riskin,
seems like a blander dose than
usual of Capracorn, with Gary
Cooper giving a sticky perfor
mance as a hall player whom a
tough, desperate newspaper
woman (Barbara Stanwyck)
talks into faking suicide in a
symbolic protest against the con
ditions of "little men" — the
John Does — in Amferica. The
phony suicide is just a ploy to
sell papers so Stanwyck can keep
her job, but it gets out of hand
when a power-hungry magnate
(Edward Arnold, balancing his
soft voice against his huge frame
to imply tremendous strength)
tries to manipulate Cooper, who
has captured the imagination of
the nation, into promoting a new
political party. That's where
Capra springs his ace: Meet John
Doe is an intended anti-fascist

picture, and it's both fascinating
and intermittently powerful, in
the Capra manner (i.e., you are
swept up by it and feel slightly
queasy afterwards). When
Cooper reads the speech Stan
wyck has written for him, claim
ing of his fellow Americans that
"we could beat anyone at war or

tiddlywinks if we all pulled in the
same direction," you realize that
Capra and Riskin have brought
Hollywood from the vaguely
socialist problem dramas of the
Depression right into wartime.
It's a very strange movie, beauti
fully shot (within the confines of
the studio) by George Barnes.
The cast includes Walter Bren
nan, Spring Byington, James
Glcason, Gene Lockhart, Ster
ling Holloway, Regis Toomey
and Rod La Rocque.
Plays tonight at 9.
Tender Mercies (1983)
Tertian Auditorium
From the opening moments of
the picture, when Rosa Lee
(Tess Harper), a young widow
who runs a motel-gas station in
rural Texas, and her son Sonny
(Allan Hubbard) overhear a
drunken fit by one-time country
music star Mac Sledge (Robert
Duvall), we can see that the
filmmakers are striving for gritty
realism in a muted, allusive style.
But the spare, banal dialogue is
so strategically planted that
there seem to be arrows pointed
at every word — and the words
aren't worth listening for. Ex
cept for Betty Buckley (as Mac's
ex-wife, who looks like a

pinched-faced Susan Anspach
and sings in a reedy, zinging
vibrato) and Ellen Barkin (as
their discontented daughter), the
actqrs fix flat, impassive stares
on the camera that, though
clearly intended to speak
volumes, are pretty much
tabulae rasae on which any
reasonable emotional interpre
tation can be written. Script by
Horton Foote; direction by
Bruce Beresford. >
Plays tomorrow evening
L at 7. y & 1 1.

Slaughterhouse Five
Cubberley Auditorium
George Roy Hill tries for
haunting fantasy with an offbeat
tone in this film of the Kurt Von
negut novel (adapted by Von
negut himself), and though he
doesn't succeed, he does achieve
some moments of startling
beauty in sequences depicting
the bombing of Dresden in
World War 11. Michael Sacks
plays the hero, an earthman who
gets "unstuck in time" and
spends a fair amount of it
copulating in a cage with a
Hollywood starlet (Valerie
Perrine) on a distant planet, but
Ron Leibman, as his nemesis,
walks away with the picture.
Miroslav Ondricek is the superb
cinematographer.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9.
Richard Pryor Here and
Now (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
Not as consistently brilliant as
either Richard Pryor Live in
Concert or Richard Pryor Live
on the Sunset Strip, but still
hilarious. And at the end of it
Pryor (who also directed) does
an impression of a junkie that

belongs at the top of his reper
toire. When the character gets
high and begins to nod off, he's
so serene that you feel drawn
into this man's forbidden sphere;
you understand why dope has a
magnetic attraction for him, be
cause Pryor shares that attrac
tion with you. He could be the

best actor in America.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
The Philadelphia Story
(1940)
History Corner, Room 2
The quintessential Hollywood
studio entertainment. Philip
Barry wrote this sparkling high
comedy in 1939; Katharine
Hepburn, who had been
declared box office poison after
a series of movie flops, left for
Broadway to play the role of
Tracy Lord, the rich girl with an
intolerance for weakness, and
the film version, the following
year, marked her triumphant
return. Donald Ogden Stewart
adapted the play, George Cukor
directed it, and Hepburn's co
stars were Cary Grant and
Jimmy Stewart, whose portrayal
of the love-struck reporter
Macaulay Connor won him an
Oscar. These three give the
definitive performances of their
roles; Barry's lines are so
marked with their readings that
the play has never succeeded in
revival, and a musical film ver
sion, High Society, in 1956 (with
Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and
Frank Sinatra), was cut-rate and
crass. With Ruth Hussey,
Roland Young, John Halliday,
Mary Nash, Virginia Weidler,
John Howard and Henry

Daniell; shot (in glistening black
and white) by Joseph Rutten
berg, and designed by Cedric
Gibbons.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.
The Trouble with Harry
(1956)
Guild, Menlo Park
Alfred Hitchcock's long
buried black comedy about a
group of people who spend all

their time putting a troublesome
corpse underground and digging
him up again; the script, by John
Michael Hayes, comes from a
John Trevor Story novel. The
opening shots, of a little boy
(Jerry Mathers) discovering the
body against a lovely autumnal
landscape, are promising — the
kid with his toy gun and the
ridiculous corpse undercut the
idyllic mood the photographer,
Robert Burks, has created. But
the rest of the movie is like
Hitchcock's TV half hours —
precious, over-understated, and
flat. Shirley MacLaine made her
debut in this picture, and she's so
far from the typical '50s starlet,
with her pixie looks, her thin,
cracked voice, and her slightly
pickled, almost sardonic way
with a line, that you can see her
appeal right away; she doesn't
show much here besides her
idiosyncrasies, though, and she's
stuck with an unsayable first
line: "Thank Providence — the
last of Harry!" Playing opposite
her is John Forsythe, who is
oddly miscast as a painter; he's
very bad, and so is Edmund
Gwenn, who mugs and mugs.
Mildred Dunnock takes the act
ing honors — such as they are.

With Mildred Natwick as a
spinster and Royal Dano.
The Kid (1921)
Festival, Palo Alto
Chaplin at his most sentimen
tal. Luckily, the film has enough
humor and charm to save at least

the first two-thirds of it. Chaplin
plays The Tramp, who finds a
baby abandoned by its un
married mother (Edna Pur
viance); he raises the boy (Jackie
Coogan), while the mother, who
has become a star, haunts the
slums, giving favors to the street
children in memory of her loss.
The melodrama, borrowed in
part from Griffith's Intolerance,
is lumbering and fairly shame
less, but the slum scenes have a
surprising authenticity. (Some of
the atmospheric detail recalls
Stephen Crane's Maggie, A Girl
of the Streets.) The funniest se
quence involves the labor col
laboration of The Tramp and
The Kid: The Kid breaks win
dows so that The Tramp, a
glazier who carries panes of glass
on his back, can find employ
ment replacing them. (Cocteau
quoted this scene in his 1949
Orpheus.) The worst thing in the
film is The Tramp's dream, in
which a demon flits about tempt
ing winged citizens on a cleaned
up version of the slum street.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Idle Class and The
Circus,
Horse Feathers (1932)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The Marx Brothers produced

their purest, most unrestrained
comedies at Paramount in tiie
early days of the talkies. This
send-up of collegiate musicals
was their fourth picture and. ex
cept for Duck Soup, it is prob
ably their best. This is the one in
which Harpo brings a fish with a
sword stuck through it to the
door of a speakeasy in order to
gain admittance (the password is
"swordfish") and Groucho sings,
"Whatever it is, I'm against it."
He plays Prof. Quincy Adams
Wagstaff, president of Huxley
College; Chico and Harpo sign
up as students so they can play in
the big football game against
Darwin, and Zeppo plays
Wagstaff s son (!). With Thelma

Todd, David Landau, Robert
Greig, James Pierce and Nat
Pendleton; screenplay by Bert
Kalmar, Harry Ruby, S.J. Perel
man and Will B. Johnstone;
songs by Kalmar and Ruby; di
rected by Norman McLeod.
Plays Tuesday with A Day at
the Races.
Annie (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
To his shame, John Huston di
rected this inept musical comedy
circus in the Half a Sixpence-
Hello, Dolly! league. The ma
terial (Thomas Meehan's
Broadway show, based on the
Harold Gray comic strip) is im
itation Oliver!, but it's certainly
colorful enough to supply a
rousing movie musical: Set in the
New York of the Depression, it's
predicated on a contrast be
tween a sleazy, run-down or
phanage and the estate of
billionaire Oliver "Daddy" War
bucks. And, except for Aileen
Quinn, the redheaded belter
who plays the title role, the cast
could hardly be better chosen:
Carol Burnett, Albert Finney,
Ann Reinking, Geoffrey Holder,
Tim Curry, Bernardette Peters.
But the picture is ludicrously
overproduced, blandly staged
and edited, choreographically
misconceived, and except for
Burnett and Finney (who are
terrific) the actors don't have
anything to do.
Plays Sunday with A
Christmas Storv.
