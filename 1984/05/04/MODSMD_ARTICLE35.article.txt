# Attorney supports legalized marijuana
## 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
Marijuana expert Leo Paoli
warned Wednesday that the country
is moving "closer to a police soci
ety" with the proliferation and en
forcement of laws governing
private lives. According to the Na
tional Organization for Reform of
Marijuana Laws (NORML)
spokesman. "It is ridiculous to
make marijuana possession a
crime."
Paoli was one of several partici
pants in a panel discussion on the
legalization of marijuana spon
sored In The Bollard, a Governor's
Corner eating club.
Paoli called marijuana use "a
victimless crime" and questioned
the rationale behind the incarcera
tion of those caught using the drug.
"There is no debate over whe
ther users are injuring anyone else
directly — they're not — so why
should they be jailed?" Paoli said.
"In matters of personal health, we
as human beings have been
endowed with a certain amount of
common sense and should be
allowed to exercise it as we see fit,"
Paoli said.
i think it is a frightening society
when you punish people to save
them from themselves: I think you
approach '1984' then," Paoli said.
"Free choice is what living is all
about. 1 don't want to make choices
for anyone else, and 1 don't want
others to make choices for me."
To allow for free choice, Paoli
called for "no laws whatsoever as
regard consumer use and cultiva
tion of marijuana" and for legaliza
tion of the sale of the drug."
A second panelist, Ed Lang,

recognized the ineffectiveness of
the laws, but said he thought there
should be some controls on use of
the drug to limit its abuse.
Lang, an employee of the Bay
Area Hotline, said. "Legal sanc
tions have not shown themselves to
be effective, and 1 believe there is a
lot to be said for not making a big
deal of the drug by maintaining
strict sanctions on the use and
abuse of the drug. 1 '
Lang thinks that too much em
phasis is placed on the question of
legalizing the drug, and not enough
attention is paid to the problem of
educating those making the deci
sion to use marijuana. "The real
question as far as drugs are con
cerned is not legal, but rather the

element of human decision
making."
The third panelist was Medical
School Prof. Leo Hollister. He
took a position against legalization,
although he argued that the drug
should be made "less illegal."
Hollister is afraid that the
legalization of marijuana would
make it an established part of our
society and is worried that "once a
drug becomes established, it is vir
tually impossible to get rid of at any
time."
Hollister believes that there exist
ways to deal with the problem
other than legalization. "One way
in which the problem could be han
dled would be to allow people to
grow two marijuana plants legally,
in much the same way that individ

iuils are allowed to make their own
wine."
An approach of this sort "would
he a way out without creating an il
licit market." Hollister said.
"Everybody would have it so the
law enforcement agencies could do
better things with their time."
Hollister believes that the most
effective way to deal with the prob
lem of marijuana in the long run is
social persuasion. "Social pressure
is far more effective in our society
than any laws which are passed,
and ultimately it will be peer per
suasion that will regulate mari
juana use."
The panel discussion was atten
ded by more than 50 students, who
posed questions to the panelists in
an open discussion format.
