# Kennedy discusses recent Mosher letter
## 
### 
University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday his request for in
formation from Stephen Mosher
represents neither "a delay tactic" nor
a "dramatic change" in the Univer
sity's position on the anthropology
graduate student's expulsion.
"It asks for clarification of points of
the record on which we're not clear,"
Kennedy said of a letter he has sent to
Mosher. "If he can supply answers
reasonably promptly, I don't think it's
going to be a significant delay in the
proceedings. The letter mentioned the
possibility that we would go back to
the ad hoc committee for limited re
examination. but I don't think that's
particularly likely."
Kennedy refused to answer specific
questions about the list of questions he
sent to Mosher because, he said.
"We're looking for his answers, not
mine."
In an hour-long discussion in I he
Daily offices yesterday. Kennedy also
hinted strongly that Stanford's next
provost will come from inside the Uni
versity and defended the controversial
use of "permanent temporary"
workers.
Kennedy said the provost search
committee has made its recommenda
tion and he is now "very close" to a

decision on a replacement for current
Provost Albert Hastorf.
When asked if Hastorfs replace
ment would come from inside or
outside the University, Kennedy said,
"I would caution against the general
view that getting somebody with a big
name from the outside is the biggest
coup, as sort of a general principle.
There's a kind of philosophy that
someone chosen from among our own
ranks is less likely to be visible, im
pressive, successful, whatever. I think
that's probably a sense we should get
over."
Kennedy said the issue of tempo
rary workers is a "perennial bone of
contention between unions and insti
tutions, especially universities, where
some of the temporaries are also
called students, and where having a
freedom to use temporaries is part not
only of employment policy but of fin
ancial aid policy. That's one of the
reasons why we've always been tough
in negotiations on insisting on the
right to use temporaries."
However, Kennedy conceded, there
are valid complaints from United
Stanford Workers in particular areas
of the University which do not employ
