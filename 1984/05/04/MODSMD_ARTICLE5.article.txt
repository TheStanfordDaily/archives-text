U.S. accused of helping Duarte
San Salvador, El Salvador — As official campaigning ends
lor Sunday's presidential election, there are strong indications
that U.S. government funds and diplomatic pressure have
been used to assist the prospects of Christian Democratic can
didate Jose Napoleon Duarte.
A significant increase in the past month in official U.S. in
volvement in organizing the voting has led Duarte's right
wing opponents in the Nationalist Republican Alliance,
known by its Spanish abbreviation Arena, to charge that
Washington is trying to engineer a fraud. There is virtually no
evidence to support this accusation, but it appears likely to
play a major role in rightist efforts after the election to dis
credit the vote, if Duarte wins as expected.
Hie United States has officially proclaimed its neutrality in
Sunday's voting, but Duarte, considered a moderate, is
clearly Washington's favorite, and evidence shows he has
benefited from U.S. government involvement in the following
ways:
• He has received critical campaign support from the nation's
largest labor union, the Salvadoran Communal Union, which
receives the majority of its operating funds from the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
• Hie CIA covertly has supplied funds to a publicity agency,
the Venezuelan Institute for Popular Education, that has
done campaign work for Duarte free of charge, according to a
knowledgeable source who has proved to be reliable in the
past.
• Finally, the U.S. government since November has twice
denied visas to Arena candidate Roberto D'Aubuisson in ac
tions that Salvadoran politicians have described as a signifi
cant blow to D'Aubuisson's presidential hopes.
Arena already seems to be laying the groundwork to com
plain it it loses that it was the victim of U.S. interference, vote
fraud or both.
Import restraints help cause
automobile sales increases
Detroit — Import restraints on Japanese cars created
shortages of some best-selling foreign models in April and
helped the domestic manufacturers attain strong sales.
Automakers yesterday reported sales of 896,791 new
domestic and imported cars in April, up 22.7 percent from
last year. Sales of the six domestic producers increased 29.3
percent to 721,091 from April 1983.
Analysts viewed the sales as a clear sign that the domestic
industry's strong recovery should continue at least through
the rest ol this year. American Motors Corp. was the only
domestic automaker to post a sales decline for the month.
Sales of Japanese cars suffered because of depleted stocks
of popular models at the start of April, when the fourth year
of the government-sanctioned "voluntary" quotas began. The
supply should improve as more vehicles arrive this month.
The share of all sales taken by imports fell to 19.6 percent
in April, the lowest monthly share since October 1979. Im
ports took a record 32.5 percent of the U.S. car market in
August 1982 at the depths of Detroit's recession.
"The typical import dealer consists of a guy with an order
pad," said David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. Japanese importers are down to a 15-day supply
ot cars or 94,000 vehicles at present. For all practical
purposes that means sold out. Healy said.
The effect of import restraints could not be felt until the
recovery in new car sales began over a year ago.
"In the absence of the availability of Japanese cars people
have been substituting domestic subcompacts," said Alan
Cohen, an analyst with Data Resources Inc.
Jackson, Mondale discuss
ways of minimizing disputes
Washington — Presidential candidates Walter Mondale
and Jesse Jackson met Wednesday with former party chair
man Robert Strauss to discuss having him mediate disputes
among the Democratic presidential contenders to minimize
the chance of damaging fights at the party's nominating con
vention in July.
Sources said yesterday that the 20-minute meeting in
Grapevine, Texas, where Mondale, Jackson and Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart debated, could lead to establishing an unus
ual. high-level Democratic task force, headed by Strauss, to
try to reconcile quietly as many differences as possible among
the three candidates.
"We talked in general terms about the fact that it (the con
vention) was a tricky situation and it was made for mischief,"
Strauss said yesterday."It would not be good for the nation
or for the Democratic Party or for Jackson for him to be in
correctly perceived as or be a mischief-maker and he under
stood that better than anyone."
"My general thought is that after (the) Ohio (primary
Tuesday), if things go the way I anticipate, it's time to start
the healing process."
Many political observers believe that Hart's anticipated
loss to Mondale in the Ohio primary, scheduled the same day
as contests in North Carolina, Indiana and Maryland, will vir
tually eliminate him from the race for the nomination.
Strauss said he hoped future discussions would include
Hart and Charles Manatt, the Democratic national chairman.

day pilgrimage to South Korea and the South Pacific yester

sion in the presidential mansion, the Blue House, the pontiff
and the president expressed "hope for easing the tension on
the Korean peninsula through an early resumption of
dialogue between the south and north of Korea."
On Wednesday, the pontiff discussed the same subject in
brief talks with President Reagan in Fairbanks, Alaska,
during a stop in his 22-hour flight from Rome to Seoul,
Vatican sources said.
The Roman Catholic leader arrived in Seoul yesterday af
ternoon seemingly unbothered by jet lag and fatigue as he
plunged immediately into a schedule of meetings and religi
ous speeches amid tight security precautions that reportedly
have mobilized 100,000 Korean police.
Chun, leading a carefully selected official delegation that
included South Korea's Cardinal Stephen Kim. was on hand
to greet John Pau! on his arrival at Seoul's Kimpo Interna
tional Airport. The pontiff was accorded a 2 I-gun salute and
a military honor guard. Hundreds of young girls in brightly
colored traditional dress waving Korean and Vatican flags
were also on hand to greet him. The pope kneeled to kiss the
runway when he deplaned.
