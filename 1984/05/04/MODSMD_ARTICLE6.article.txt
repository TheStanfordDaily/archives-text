From the l.os Angeles Times
W ashington — The Reagan administration, pressured
by Congress and by the record-breaking federal budget
deficit, spelled out a plan yesterday to trim $13.9 bil
lion from the $305 billion military budget it sent to
Capitol Hill four months ago.
In unveiling the proposed cuts. Secretary of Defense
Caspai Weinberger, who had insisted the original
budget tor fiscal 1985 could not be reduced without im
pairing the nation's security, said they would cause
some damage'' to U.S. military readiness.
I he package outlined yesterday, which was worked
out by defense planners in six weeks of meetings and
debates, calls for the cuts to be made by reducing or
ders tor several conventional weapons, extending other
production contracts and canceling some programs.
However, the major strategic weapons programs
the MX missile. B-l bomber and Trident missile-firing
submarine — were all left untouched.
The cuts included 120 M-l tanks. 55 Bradley fighting
vehicles, 322 AH-64 attack helicopters, 93 Mark-48
torpedoes. 12,000 TOW anti-tank missiles, 12 Ser
geant York air defense guns and a number of other
tactical missile systems.
"Stretched out" to reduce their impact on the budget
were the F-16 and F-18 fighter production programs,
as well as production of the new C-5B transport plane
and and one Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered attack
submarine.

Both President Reagan and Weinberger emphasized
that the administration would stand bv the proposed
Pentagon cuts only il Congress goes along with the
other two parts of the overall budget reduction strategv
announced by the president March 15: a package of
cuts in domestic spending and action to provide more
federal revenue by closing tax loopholes.
In a letter yesterday to Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R- Term.) and several committee chair
men. Reagan declared. "I strongly believe . . . that any
further reductions would he counter to our national se
curity interests and could not be accepted."
lie continued, "l urther. these reductions are only
agreed to by me on the expressed condition that the
other two parts of the compromise package be
enacted."
At a Pentagon press conference and in testimony
before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Weinberger made it clear he. too. was unentluisiastic
about the reductions forced on the Department of
Defense by the congressional furor over the budget
deficit. The new package "may not satisfy those who
want to take us back even farther and those whose in
terest is other than national security," he predicted.
"We tried to use as our criteria lor reduction things
that would minimize added risk to our future national
security and at the same time continue as many of the
president's stated policies as we could," he said.

But he added. "There is no way in which we can
make these reductions that will not cause some prob
lems. cost more, take us longer and add to the risk."
Weinberger said the cuts mean it would take longer
tor the Department of Defense to achieve its readiness
goals, would make it necessary to deter maintenance
and repairs, would cause some support units to be un
dermanned and would produce some reduction in ef
fectiveness.
Under the new plan, the Pentagon's budget authority
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. I will be reduced
from $305 billion to $291.1 billion, but the actual
spending during the year will only be cut by $5.N bil
lion. from a projected $264.4 billion to $25N.6 billion.
But Weinberger said the requested budget authority
has actually been cut $30.5 billion for the military since
January 1983. when the administration projected its
19N5 budget at $321.6 billion. A total of $16.6 billion
was cut during the annual budget review last fall.
The defense package was unveiled a day after the
Senate rejected a proposal to freeze government
spending and as it began consideration of a $200 billion
deficit-reduction plan backed by Democrats. A vote
yesterday had been predicted on the Democratic plan,
sponsored by Sen. l.awton Chiles (D-Fla.) but it was
delayed because many senators already had left town
for the weekend. The Senate will not be in session
today.
