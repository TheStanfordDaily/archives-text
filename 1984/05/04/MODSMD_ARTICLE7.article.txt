# Senate rejects president's line-item veto
## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Washington — The Republican
controlled Senate yesterday rejected
legislation to give the president line-item
veto authority for spending bills, a major
expansion of executive power that Presi
dent Reagan had asked Congress to ap
prove in the form of a constitutional
amendment.
However, the key vote of 56 to 34
against the proposal came on the issue of
whether it was constitutional to take the
action in regular legislation. This blurred
the basic question of whether a president
should be given the power to knock out
individual items in an appropriations bill
without vetoing the entire measure.
An earlier procedural vote to table the
constitutional objection was razor-thin
close, 46 to 45, signaling that the pro
posal probably had more support than
was indicated by the final vote.
But neither vote suggested that the

line-item veto proposal could muster a
two-thirds vote necessary to pass as a
constitutional amendment, as Reagan re
quested in his State of the Union
message three months ago.
The votes came in connection with a
pending deficit-reduction measure that
previously had prompted little atten
dance by members. But senators
streamed to the floor for the veto debate,
which touched on the sensitive issue of
congressional turf as well as budgetary
control.
Even such Reagan loyalists as
Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) split with the president on the
line-item veto issue, although Baker as
well as others tried to make the vote turn
on the constitutional point.
" I think this is a bad idea," said Baker,
warning that a line-item veto would con
stitute not only a broad new grant of
power to the executive branch but also

an inducement to Congress to thwart the
law by compressing all its appropriations
into "one item, one line."
But the most impassioned argument
against the proposal came from Appro
priations Committee Chairman Mark
Hatfield (R-Ore.) who called it a "silly
idea"' that would allow the president
"virtually to dictate spending priorities."
"I think we ought to bury (the veto
proposal) and forget it was ever raised
and maybe ask forgiveness for every
having had such a thought," said Hat
field, with chilly disdain.
The proposal, offered by Sen. Mack
Mattingly (R-Ga.) would have allowed a
president to veto individual items in an
appropriations bill for the next two
years, after which the line-item veto au
thority would expire automatically.
It also would have allowed Congress to
override these vetoes by a simple
majority vote of both houses, rather than

the two-thirds vote now required to
override vetoes of appropriations hills
and other legislation.
Mattingly contended that the constitu
tional balance between executive and
legislative powers would not have been
disrupted because Congress could
override vetoes by the same simple
majority that is required for passage of
the legislation in the first place.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) supported the
proposal despite the constitutional ob
jections of Baker and others, saying the
two-year period would allow time to test
the idea in preparation for a constitu
tional amendment. Thurmond ac
knowledged that the proposal could not
now get the two-thirds vote necessary for
an amendment but added, "If it can save
billions of dollars, it's certainly worth
trying."
