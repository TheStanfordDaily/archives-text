# Memorial Church's new Baroque organ pipes up
## 
### ART STREIBER 
The sandstone of Memorial
Church reverberated with the tones
of Baroque organ music yesterday
afternoon as the just-completed
Fisk organ was played for its in
augural recital.
The new organ, named for the
late Charles Fisk, a Stanford stu
dent during the early 1950s and the
owner of the C.B. Fisk Organ
rebuilding company, is an eclectic
tour-manual Baroque-type instru
ment of 73 ranks and 4222 pipes.
In order to reproduce the sound
of Baroque music as authentically
as possible, the organ can change
its tuning from well-tempered to
mean-tone, all made possible by
having five extra pipes (two for
each black key) in each octave.
Opening remarks were made
yesterday by Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-Kelly and Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
Hamerton-Kelly praised the talents
of University Organist Prof. Her
bert Nanney, who played the organ
yesterday and instructed Fisk in or
gan study in the 19505.
Kennedy explained the process
by which the organ was completed.
In 1973 the will of the late Evelyn
Almack Turrentine revealed a gift

to he used for a new organ in
Memorial Church. For several
years, however, the project was
brought to a halt due to insufficient
funds to cover the great expense of
reinforcing the Church's choir loft
so it could hold the weight of the
organ.
Help came from later gifts from
the late George Morell, Jacques
Littlefield and Walter Hewlett.
In 1950, Fisk came to Stanford
to work on a Ph.D in nuclear
physics. Soon after arriving, he
visited Memorial Church and, after
a few weeks, changed his major to
music and started making up un
dergraduate courses in that subject.
He also enrolled in organ study
with Nanney. Although he under
stood the mechanics and tonal
features of an organ, he progressed
slowly as a performer.
Finally, he asked Nanney for
help rebuilding organs. Nanney ar
ranged for him to become an ap
prentice with Hohn Swinford, who
maintained the Memorial Church
organ and other organs in the area.
By the early 19605, Fisk owned
his own organ-rebuilding firm, a
firm which has since built organs
for Wellesley College and Harvard
University, as well as the new Stan
ford organ.

The new organ at Memorial Church was dedicated yesterday, with a huge crowd turning out for the
ceremonies. The audience (above) turned around in the pews to listen to and watch the organ being
Clayed. The University's organist, Prof. Herbert Nannev, warmed up before the ceremony (left) at the
elm of the new instrument. The organ was a gift from the late Charles Fisk, a Stanford graduate student
of nuclear physics and later of music.
