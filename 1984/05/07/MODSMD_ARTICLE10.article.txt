# Mailing list mania
## 
### 
I am the victim of a conspiracy. For some reason,
through no fault of my own. I have been chosen by the
powers-that-be to save the world. Lest you think 1 suffer
from delusions of grandeur, let me explain: Through some
devious plot. 1 have been singled out as the person who
must preserve the environment, stop the arms race, defend
civil rights and civil liberties, ban handguns, help discover
the cure for arthritis and heart disease and generally rid
mankind of the many pestilences and plagues (such as
Jesse Helms and acid rain) that have been visited upon it
for the past century.
How did I figure out that I was the chosen one? It took
me a long time to realize what was happening, due to the
insidious nature of the schemers in mailing list land. Years
ago. I received a request from an outfit that 1 help them
get rid of the ku Klux Klan; this sounded to me like a
worthy idea, so I agreed to help them in their fight (to the
tune of $25). Taking on the Ku Klux Klan was no problem
for me at that time, as I was a junior in high school and had
plenty of free time.
By and by, I was approached by another group, which
wanted to enlist me in its effort to save the whales. Again,
I found this a worthwhile cause, and. with the blessing of
my parents (and $20). 1 joined up. Saving whales was fun,
socially conscious and required only a pen and a check
book; I later learned, much to my delight, that my contri
bution also covered protection of baby seals on the
Canadian tundra and efforts to stop the dumping of nu
clear waste in the ocean.
Next. I got a letter from a man named Pete Shields, who
urged me to join his campaign to ban handguns. Now. I
have always been afraid of guns, especially big guns, but 1
figured we could start with little ones and work up. so I
sent in my name (and $20). Several days later. Benjamin
Hooks wrote me a nice letter asking me to help promote
racial equality in America; how could I turn him down? I
couldn't, so (for $15) I joined the NAACP.
Here 1 was, only a senior in high school, and already I
was ridding the streets of dangerous weapons, defeating
the Ku Klux Klan, ending civil rights violations, saving
whales and stopping the slaughter of baby seals. I still did
not realize that 1 was being singled out as part of a larger
plan, however.
My next cause became stopping the arms race. A large
task for a college freshman? The Nuclear Weapons Freeze
Campaign, the Peace PAC, Freeze Voters, The National
Peace Academy Campaign and The Committee for a Sane
Nuclear Policy didn't seem to think so, and 1 added the
prevention of nuclear war to my growing list of ac
complishments (as well as adding several more dollars to
the coffers of these worthy organizations). I slept easier at
night knowing that, thanks to me. the world was a safer
place for my friends and relations.

My name was obviously travelling around in the right
circles as a noted philanthroper and social activist, because
1 started getting personal appeals from famous people who
wanted me to devote my efforts (and money) to their
causes. Dr. Benjamin Spock asked me to help get the
United States out of Central America; I knew that he must
he writing me because mv mother had read his book and
raised me properly, so 1 joined his team. Martin Sheen ap
pealed to me for medical aid to El Salvador, and — though
I wondered if they needed medical aid because they filmed
Apocalypse Now there — I donated my name (and several
bucks) to his crusade.
It was about this time that I began to realize what was
up . . . these people were singling me out to cure all of so
ciety's ills. Not that I minded, of course — I'm all in favor
of a healthy society — but why me? Were they trying to
appeal to my guilt? My conscience? My general good na
ture? It must have been one of those, because it surely
wasn't because of my vast wealth or fame (though I had
once earned $7 for agreeing to be the president of the
chess club in junior high school).
Soon, the onslaught began in earnest. Some days, three
or four letters would arrive, all from noted politicos or
other activists, wanting me to join their various campaigns.
Cesar Chavez, Ted Kennedy, Luciano Pavarotti and Maria
Von Trapp have all become my pen pals, and I (for only
minor contributions) am working to ensure that the
United Farm Workers get a fair shake, to restore a Demo
cratic majority in the Senate, to save the San Francisco
Opera and to stamp out racial hatred in the United States.
They test me from time to time, just to make sure I'm
still on their side: I get missives from Jerry Falwell urging
me to become a Faith Partner and to save his Old Time
Gospel Hour, but he's a dead giveaway: "The liberals have
handed together to discredit me and destroy the Moral
Majority once and for all . . . Norman Lear, the American
Civil Liberties Union, militant homosexuals, American
atheists and others are working against me." President
Reagan has requested the honor of my support for the
GOP Victory Fund and I have even been accused by the
Republican National Committee of being a contributing
member (1 proudly stapled my membership card above the
urinal in my dorm bathroom), but my fans in mailing list
land know that I am true.
Is it hard being a world savior? Well. I'm taking 16 units
and maintaining a fairly active social life in spite of all my
commitments — just the other day. I got an anguished ap
peal from the American Association of Ethiopian Jews
and my seventh "urgent" strategy ballot from the Demo
cratic Congressional Campaign Committee — but I've
built up such a reputation with the mailing list folks that I
can't back out now.
