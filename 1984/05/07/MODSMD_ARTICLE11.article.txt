## The
						time is prime for Gary Hart 
### 
As a 20-year-old horn in the Midwest and raised
in California where the old people told me to he a
proud Ameriean and the young people told me to
he an ashamed American. I've been trying to fig
ure out if the American dream will he a fantasy
come true or an apocalyptic nightmare. The
newspapers seem to he asking a question that's on

VIEWPOINT

everyone's mind: Is this new Hart phenomenon a
Kennedy, McGovern or Carter?
The traditional fatalists living in the past answer
that he is all three at once: a sexy dark-haired
phony, a head-in-the-clouds leftist loser and a
grinning, incapable bookworm just like his Demo
cratic predecessors. An contraire and none of the
above.
Frit?. Mondale was a dedicated senator and an
excellent vice president, but it is painfully obvious
that he is neither charismatic nor dynamic enough
to beat Reagan this November. Initially, Mondale
was probably coerced into running for president
because in the eyes of Big Labor and the older
decaying wings of the Democratic Party he was the
biggest name and most loyal politician around.
But now. thank God. we have Gary Hart who
can beat Ronald Reagan at this critical juncture in
history and bring America from the 1950s into the
19N0s. Hart is in fact a synthesis of past presiden
tial candidates not in the fearsome way described
above but rather as follows: Hart has the Kennedy
charisma, diplomatic skill and political effective
ness; McGovern's idealism, love of peace and
desire for change; and Carter's piety, honesty and
ability to march from virtual anonymitv to the

White House in a matter of months.
Hart is here to fill the hole in American leader
ship which has gotten so deep and wide with the
current administration that our nation's walls are
starting to cave in. What this country needs so

badly is a strong, intelligent government with a ra
tional approach to defense and a greater concern
from patriotic ide.alism than party ideology.
What was once a choice between political ac
tivism and apathy is now a question of survival
through knowledge or death by ignorance. The
only pressing thing about the 1984 election is that
if Reagan is allowed to give us his version of the
t '

Watergate affair there will be no cover-up scandal.
And what's more,"lazy Democrats won't be able to
put stickers bragging "Don't Blame Me. I Voted
For Hart" on their bumpers because the latter will
have alreadv melted.
Consequently, all aware individuals must take
action and awaken their sleeping friends to the in
sanity in Nicaragua and El Salvador, the lies in tax
reform and arms control and most of all to the cur
rent Teddy Roosevelt/ John I oster Dulles robot
sitting in the White House who genuinely believes
the puiu id peace is to "speak loudly and swing a
big stick."
We must learn the lesson of this election before
it's all over. As 194N was the rebirth of Israel, so
1984 can be the reaffirmation ol democracy in
America. bv proving the triumph of freely ex
changing intelligent ideas over Hollywood
manipulation of the media.
As Gar\ Hart himself says, this is not "left
right." but a "post-future" election that will decide
the fate ol America. Our American Dream has
already suffered the Kennedy and King assassina
tions, the Vietnam tragedy, the Watergate lies, the
Iranian hostages and the Lebanon corpses. It can
soon be renewed if Hart is given the chance to
brings the arms madness under control and to rev i
talize our slow moving economy. The time has
come for us to "beat our plowshares into swords"
and take arms against the enemy, except this time
the enemy is not other people but our own fears,
archaic ideas and destructive technologies. Hart's
New England sweep and his Southern victories
were no accident. The New Age is here — the year
is 19K4 — Take Hart America!
