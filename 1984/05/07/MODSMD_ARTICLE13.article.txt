## Drunk driving a pressing matter 
### 
I am glad The Daily printed Scott
Stevenson's \iewpoint on the Rush
book, "Fraternities overemphasize
sex"' (May I). But the comments
about sex aren't all that the Rush
book should he criticized for.
The Delta Upsilon claim that "We
boast the highest ration of D.U.I.s
and I.U.D.s on campus" made me
sick, more because of the D.U.I.s
than the I.U.D.s.
Many people comfortably assume
that if they drive home from a party
drunk and have an accident, it's just
that: an "accident." I don't believe
bad luck killed my father when a
drunk teenage driver hit our car at 80
miles an hour. I blame it not only on
that irresponsible teenage boy. but on
all boys playing at being men by
driving recklessly.
Apparently, the Delta Upsilon
fraternity is one of the best places on
campus for boys to play at being men.
Such attitudes must change.
Ten years ago people were more
inclined to joke about rape; now most
people see it for what it is: a violent
crime. Likewise, drunk driving isn't
"fun," it's often an incredibly sense
less and horrible tragedy.

In my letter (Daily, April 10) I
deplored the fact that many French
professors were not invited to meet
the president of France during Ins
recent visit to Stanford. A letter by
Robert Freelan, vice president for
public affairs. (Daily, April I 1 )) in
formed us that the selection of guests
to a reception given in his honor was
made by lottery. It is obvious that
such procedures are used after appro
priate invitations are issued.
It the University had wished to
recognize specific and strong commit
ments to French studies, it would
have made certain that every profes
sor in the French Department was
invited. On so eminently French an
occasion, it was the least that could
be expected.

A few thoughts on the ongoing
debate over the role of fraternities at
Stanford.
A Daily editiorial (April 24) stated
that subjective selection (call it dis
crimination) has no place in the
"ideal world" of the University. It

seems tli.it Stanford first ought to
prohibit campus acccss to corporate
recruiters tor interviews.
II they're not using subjective
criteria tor employment, why do they
need interviews anyway? Besides, job
rejection is permanent — certainly
more significant that the temporary
trauma of sorority rejection. Stanford
should do its best to ensure everyone
an equal chance at those "plum"
jobs.
And what about Stanford's own
faculty? One hopes the grading
process isn't entirely arbitrary, and I
have yet to see widespread use of
truly objeetve grading criteria. Why
not take away their campus offices
(and their "ghetto" houses) until they
too can be "fair" to everyone?
Seriously, mv experience has been
that Stanford fraternities provide a
valuable living option for many men.
Very few fraternities abuse the
privileges granted them by the Uni
versity.
The long-term benefits to fraternity
members greatly outweigh the fleet
ing disappointment of the few who
are rejected. 1 have yet to hear of anv
intelligent options to replace the
benefits of fraternal living at Stan
ford.
