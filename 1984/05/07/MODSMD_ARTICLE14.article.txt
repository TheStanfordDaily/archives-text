## Frosh need theme house option 
### 
I am writing to express my disagreement with the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies (C'-US) interim report's
recommendation that freshmen not he assigned to Stan
ford's ethnic theme houses.
In particular. I disagree with the views of Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons and C-US committee member
Ken Mertzel (Daily. April 30). Lyons said that keeping

freshmen out of ethnic theme houses would "strengthen
the freshman program" and Mertzel said the change would
expose freshmen to a "lot of different experiences."
Cross-cultural living situations have great educational
value because they provide one of the few ways for ethnic
programming and cross-cultural exchanges to occur.
I do not see how it can be possible that keeping fresh
men out of theme houses would strengthen and diversify
their educational experience. Rather, adopting such a re
commendation would be a prescription for homogeneity in
our housing system. This homogeneity would conform to
the dominant values of the committee and to the tastes of
incoming freshmen that are sincerely unaware of the edu

me and several other freshmen from similar backgrounds

1 agree with C-US's recommendation for stronger aca
demic emphasis and for the possible relocation of the eth
nic theme houses. By eliminating freshmen from the
houses, however, the committee has forgotten one of the

most fundamental reasons behind theme houses: the
cross-cultural living experience they provide. The C-US's
recommendation is a disservice to all freshmen and to all
w ho work for cross-cultural harmony.
