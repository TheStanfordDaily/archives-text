# Encina Station: dining with a 90-year history
## 
### LISA PALMER 
Seniors may remember it as the one-time
campus pub, and real-old-timers may even
recall it as the cafeteria for Encina Hall. But
today — decorated with historical enlarge
ments of Leland Stanford's railroad career —
the Encina Station serves Stanford as a quiet
place to go for breakfast or lunch.
Although few may have noticed the Station
tucked under an arch of the Economics De
partment, life was once more lively at Encina
Commons and in the Station as well.
Management of the Encina dining hall,
which was transferred to Encina Commons to
accomodate increasing numbers of students in
1923, has gone through many changes in the
last 90 years. Originally a University operated
food service, the men of Encina Mall went
through numerous managers, repeatedly un
happy with the price and quality of their food.
One food manager was commended for lasting
longer than a month. But according to the Se
quoia magazine of May 1, 1896, "A man will
put up with a great many things, but poor
board he will not endure."
Encina students achieved a great victory as,
around the turn of the century, they were
allowed to elect a student committee to
manage their food service. The Stanford Quad
of 1904 called this a great triumph, proclaim
ing, "Republican government was instituted . . .
freemen voted for their rulers and their con
duct regulated the price which they should pay
for board."
"Of course the limitations are very close
when it is intended to reducc the table board to
the price of twelve dollars and fifty cents per
month . . . ," continued the Sequoia of January
1893.
After the eating quarters had been moved to
the new cluster of eight dining rooms sur
rounding a large kitchen in Encina Commons,
the old dining hall became a social center. The
first attempt of the men of Encina Hall to
sponsor a social event was a "flat fizzle," ac
cording to the 1904 Ouad.
"It was planned to entertain the Roble girls

(Roble was then the all-women dorm), but the
work of the Encina novices was not smooth.
They made some mysterious mistake, . . . the
Roble girls were offended and . . . went to
Mayfield that night — to a church entertain
ment."
Perhaps the mysterious mistake committed
by those "aspiring gentlemen could have
been avoided by following a recommendation
in the September 27, 1893, issue of Sequoia
magazine. "Some one remarked in Encina the
other day that a volume on table etiquette
should have been a companion to the Bibles so
generously and kindly placed in each room" of
Encina Hall.
The Encina Commons has gone through
many changes since then. After Encina Hall
was phased out as a dorm, the large eating cen
ter was no longer necessary. It has been the
home of the intramural wrist wrestling cham
pionships, sophomore and senior pub nights,
various charity dinners and the training table
of the football team.
There have been repeated attempts in the
past few years to turn the Station into a pub,
but due to a lack of good accoustics and its hid
den location, none of the attempts has been
successful.
Since 1980 the Station has been run by Ser
vomation, the same organization which
operates Tresidder's Crossroads. According to
Ted Hoef, advertising and marketing manager
for Tresidder, "we have decided to steadily im
prove the service that we offer as far as lunch
and breakfast."
To this end, the Encina Station now features
omelettes made-to-order, a fresh salad and
Mexican bar, char-broiled burgers and
homemade pastries.
It also boasts a dynamic Sicilian chef who
claims, "I wouldn't serve nothing I wouldn't
eat myself. I've been known to throw big
mixing bowls across the room 'cause it wasn't
done my way." Encina Commons has come a
long way.
