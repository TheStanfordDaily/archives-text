# VTS series to fulfill areas 6,7,8

### HEATHER WRIGHT Staff writer 
A three-quarter course entitled The
Nature of Technology, Mathematics
and Science to be offered next year is
being billed by administrators as "the
ultimate one-year technology, math
and science sequence for B.A.
(Bachelor of Arts) students" and will
fulfill all three science distribution re
quirements.
The program will entail three con
secutive quarters of three units each,
combining math, physics and technol
ogy theory with practical applications.
The series will deal with topics ranging
from the Big Bang theory and new
medical applications of technology
like CAT scanners, to number theory,
physics and energy sources.
The course was conceived by James
Adams, director of Values, Technol
ogy, Science and Society (VTSS),
more than two years ago and submit
ted at the beginning of this year in a
joint effort with Mathmatics Prof.
Robert Osserman and Physics Prof. Al
exander Fetter. The program was
recently awarded a three-year
$200,000 grant by the Sloan Founda
tion for the improved treatment of
technical subjects for liberal arts stu
dents.
Adams, who is also associate dean
of Engineering, said that there is a
definite need for an alternative to
many of the options now available to
fulfill the mathematical sciences, natu
ral sciences and technology and ap
plied sciences distribution require
ments.
"Many of the entry-level classes
have high math expectations and the
competition is fast," he said.
Adams said the new program, co
sponsored by VTSS, Physics and Engi
neering, is designed to "rigorously
challenge, but not overwhelm the
B.A. student.
"The program will enhance tin
liberal arts education. A lot of people
are very excited about it including the
(University) president, the provost
and the dean of Engineering," he said.
Because the program isn't tradi
tional, Adams said that "a lot of
people are watching. They're enthusi
astic but not quite sure how we'/l put it
all together."
Adams, Osserman and Fetter, the
program instructors, are now collect-
mg course materials hut will rel\ heav
ily on student feedback during the first

year. Adams said he anticipates that
30 to 40 students will enroll during
next sear's trial run.
' I'd like to see a good cross section
ot the student body participate. I'd es
pecially like to get a tew really hard
core anti-math people involved." he

said.
"Our main intent in beginning the
program is to t»i\ c non-majors a better
opportunity to understand the nature
of \alues. technology and science. But
we also think it will be a lot ot tun,
