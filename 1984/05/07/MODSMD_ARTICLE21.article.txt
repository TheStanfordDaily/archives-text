# Faculty commentary: Coit Blacker
## Looking for the motives behind Soviet behavior 
### 
Coit Blacker is associate direc
tor of the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Con
trol and lecturer in the Political
Science Department. He is a spe
cialist in Soviet foreign and mili
tary policy and in arms control
and international security issues.
In IVH2, as an International Af
fairs Fellow of the Council on
Foreign Relations, Blacker was
appointed special assistant for
national security issues in the of
fice of Sen. Gary Hart, for whom
he continues\to be a consultant.
Blacker adapted the following
from his writing entitled "The

Military Forces," in Robert F.
Byrnes, "After Brezhnev:
Sources of Soviet Conduct in the
1980s."
If it is a central concern of
those who study Soviet military
affairs that the Kremlin aspires
to the capability to "prevail" in
the event of a nuclear war, these
analysts are only slightly less
preoccupied with the way in
which Soviet leaders envision
the relationship between mili
tary power and the conduct of
foreign policy. In its most ab
breviated form, the question
most often posed relates to
future Soviet behavior: How
will the relative and absolute
growth of Soviet military power
affect the conduct of the
country's foreign policy in the
1980s and beyond? Is the
Kremlin likely to become more

assertive in pursuit of its foreign
policy objectives as a result of
the dramatic increase in Soviet
military capabilities and if so, to
what extent and in what areas of
the world?
As the debate over the signifi
cance of Soviet military power
has intensified, many Western
observers have attempted to
divine Soviet thinking by refer
ence to such factors as the role
of Russian history, the impor
tance of geography, the impact
of ideology, the character of So
viet culture and society and the
influence of domestic politics.

They have also examined in
stances in which Soviet leaders
have resorted to the use of force
in order to achieve their foreign
policy objectives. As might be
anticipated, this methodology
has given rise to a number of
competing interpretations.
Among American and other
noncommunist analysts there is
not, nor has there ever been,
anything approaching a com
mon interpretation of the con
nection in Soviet thinking be
tween military power and politi
cal purpose.
A useful way to underscore
the intensity of the Western
debate on this issue is to com
pare the major contentions of
the two most distinct and
opposed schools of thought,
recognizing in advance that few
observers would identify com

pletely with either position. At
one end of the spectrum are
those who argue that the prin
cipal goals of Soviet foreign
policy are to increase the num
ber of areas under direct Soviet
control, to extend the Kremlin's
political, military and economic
influence to all regions of the
world and to compel the retreat
of American power to the West
ern hemisphere, implying mili
tary force in pursuit of these ob
jectives, if necessary.
In seeking to extend the fron
tiers of the state and to elimi
nate all potential rivals for
hegemony, they see Soviet
leaders acting in a manner con
sistent with Russian historical
tradition. Just as Peter the
Great sought to "militarize"
Russian society in order to
realize his imperial aspirations,
so have his Communist heirs
continued that process. From
Stalin's absorption of the Baltic
republics in 1940 to Brezhnev's
invasion of Afghanistan 40
years later, this analysis holds,
the dominant thrust of Soviet
foreign policy has been expan
sion through military means.
These analysts ascribe the
Kremlin's "expansionist" ten
dencies to the fundamental in
ternal weaknesses of the Soviet
system, which compel the lead
ership to confirm its legitimacy
and to justify its existence by
demonstrating the regime's mil
itary prowess.
They argue that, in much the
same way as several of the czar's
advisers urged initiation of a
limited war with Japan in 1904
to distract the Russian people
from their misery, the current
leadership seeks to compensate
for the system's failure by creat
ing military capabilities greater
than those of its nearest rival
and by using those resources in
the interests of the
"international class struggle."
The second school also looks
to Russian history to explain the
regime's heavy reliance on coer
cion in the conduct of foreign
policy but contends that the de
pendence derives less from ag

gressive intent or the dynamics
of the political system than from
the leadership's pervasive sense
of vulnerability and insecurity.
They see the Russian and So
viet national experience as one
of war and attempted subjuga
tion. According to this interpre
tation, much of the Kremlin's
diplomacy after 1945, beginning
with Stalin's installation of com
munist regimes in Eastern
Europe, was designed to ensure
the country's security through
the creation of a system of
dominated states along its bor
ders.
The essential character of So
viet foreign policy, especially in
the first 20 years after the
Second World War, vyas thus
defensive: to safeguard the
"gains of socialism"— if neces
sary by recourse to force.
Analysts drawn to this view of
Soviet behavior also tend to
ascribe different motives to the
Kremlin's assumption of more
global political and military re
sponsibilities than those identi
fied with the "expansionist"
school. While not denying that
this phase of Soviet policy
represents a clear break with
past practice, they tend to ex
plain its emergence not by refer
ence to long-standing imperial
Soviet ambitions but to exten
sive changes in the international
political environment, such as
the explosion of nationalist and
anticolonialist sentiment in the
Third World, which have pre
sented Kremlin policy-makers
with an abundance of low-cost
and relatively low-risk opportu
nities to expand Soviet influence
at the expense of the West.
Moreover, they believe that the
Soviets avoid serious military
involvements in those areas
deemed "immature" in revolu
tionary terms, areas in which
political and economic condi
tions are not sufficiently ad
vanced to guarantee Soviet suc
cess.
Those who subscribe to this
interpretation often charac
terize Soviet policy in such
"third areas" as cautious, pru

dent and restrained. Likewise,
they consider Soviet objectives
relatively modest in scope: to
preserve the "gains of
socialism" in those countries
already embarked on the
Marxist-Leninist path of devel
opment; to assist such progres
sive forces as may exist; and, in
pursuing these goals, to avoid
direct military confrontation
with the United States.
As most Western analysts will
readily admit, neither the
"expansionist" nor the
"defensive" model provides an

adequate framework within
which to assess Soviet attitudes
toward the use of military power
in foreign policy. Both inter
pretations capture elements of
reality and identify important
aspects of Soviet behavior. Ulti
mately, however, their attempt
at universality and their failure
to recognize that both ten
dencies can and do exist simul
taneously in Soviet policy limit
their analytical utility.
Moreover, it is extremely
unlikely that those responsible
for the conduct of the Kremlin's

foreign policy view the connec
tion between force and
diplomacy in such simple and
unambiguous terms.
The willingness of Soviet
leaders to consider the use of
military power to achieve
desired political outcomes prob
ably turns less on preconceived
notions regarding expansion or
defense than on a complicated
set of ever-changing variables,
such as the salience of the issue
(political and economic), the
utility of a military response,
perceptions of risk (political and

military), and the possible im
plications of a decision not to
act. It seems reasonable to
assume that such pragmatic con
siderations rather than more
abstract concepts of historical
experience, national character
and ideology condition Soviet
attitudes, although these factors
provide a frame of reference or
a context within which Kremlin
leaders consider their options.
While it is not possible to de
termine the precise degree to
which Soviet leaders may rely
more heavily in future years

than in the past on military
power as an instrument of
foreign policy, one can make a
number of appropriately
tentative observations and
predictions based on an analysis
of the growth of Soviet power
and of recent Soviet behavior in
three quite different contexts:
actions taken in defense of the
"socialist commonwealth"; re
lations with the West; and
policies in the Third World.
In reference to the first di
mension — the Kremlin's rela
tion with proximate Communist
allies — Soviet leaders will con
tinue to rely on their enormous
and usable military power both
to prevent the erosion of Com
munist Party control and to
preserve within these countries
their special and privileged posi
tion as security guarantor. In the
second dimension — relations
with the West — Soviet atti
tudes and policies seem likely to
icidin much of their present
form and content. The Soviets
do not anticipate that the
prospective strategic nuclear
balance of power will afford
them the opportunity for dra
matic gains at the expense of
their principal adversary.
However, the leadership does
seem to expect a further, albeit
gradual and uneven, decline in
Western Europe's commitment
to the Atlantic Alliance and a
concomitant reduction in Amer
ican influence on the continent,
as a result of the Soviet military
buildup.
With respect to the third di
mension, Soviet policies in so
called third areas, the growth of
Soviet military power — specifi
cally the expansion of the
country's power projection ca
pabilities, is almost certain to
result in more assertive Soviet
behavior in many areas of the
less developed world, including
a greater willingness than in the
past to lend military assistance
to "revolutionary" and
"progressive" forces and to
protect, again through military
means, these newly won "gains
of socialism".

of Russian history, the impor
tance of geography, the impact
of ideology, the character of So
viet culture and society and the
influence of domestic politics.

They have also examined in
stances in which Soviet leaders
have resorted to the use of force
in order to achieve their foreign
policy objectives. As might be
anticipated, this methodology
has given rise to a number of
competing interpretations.
Among American and other
noncommunist analysts there is
not, nor has there ever been,
anything approaching a com
mon interpretation of the con
nection in Soviet thinking be
tween military power and politi
cal purpose.
A useful way to underscore
the intensity of the Western
debate on this issue is to com
pare the major contentions of
the two most distinct and
opposed schools of thought,
recognizing in advance that few
observers would identify com

pletely with either position. At
one end of the spectrum are
those who argue that the prin
cipal goals of Soviet foreign
policy are to increase the num
ber of areas under direct Soviet
control, to extend the Kremlin's
political, military and economic
influence to all regions of the
world and to compel the retreat
of American power to the West
ern hemisphere, implying mili
tary force in pursuit of these ob
jectives, if necessary.
In seeking to extend the fron
tiers of the state and to elimi
nate all potential rivals for
hegemony, they see Soviet
leaders acting in a manner con
sistent with Russian historical
tradition. Just as Peter the
Great sought to "militarize"
Russian society in order to
realize his imperial aspirations,
so have his Communist heirs
continued that process. From
Stalin's absorption of the Baltic
republics in 1940 to Brezhnev's
invasion of Afghanistan 40
years later, this analysis holds,
the dominant thrust of Soviet
foreign policy has been expan
sion through military means.
These analysts ascribe the
Kremlin's "expansionist" ten
dencies to the fundamental in
ternal weaknesses of the Soviet
system, which compel the lead
ership to confirm its legitimacy
and to justify its existence by
demonstrating the regime's mil
itary prowess.
They argue that, in much the
same way as several of the czar's
advisers urged initiation of a
limited war with Japan in 1904
to distract the Russian people
from their misery, the current
leadership seeks to compensate
for the system's failure by creat
ing military capabilities greater
than those of its nearest rival
and by using those resources in
the interests of the
"international class struggle."
The second school also looks
to Russian history to explain the
regime's heavy reliance on coer
cion in the conduct of foreign
policy but contends that the de
pendence derives less from ag

gressive intent or the dynamics
of the political system than from
the leadership's pervasive sense
of vulnerability and insecurity.
They see the Russian and So
viet national experience as one
of war and attempted subjuga
tion. According to this interpre
tation, much of the Kremlin's
diplomacy after 1945, beginning
with Stalin's installation of com
munist regimes in Eastern
Europe, was designed to ensure
the country's security through
the creation of a system of
dominated states along its bor
ders.
The essential character of So
viet foreign policy, especially in
the first 20 years after the
Second World War, vyas thus
defensive: to safeguard the
"gains of socialism"— if neces
sary by recourse to force.
Analysts drawn to this view of
Soviet behavior also tend to
ascribe different motives to the
Kremlin's assumption of more
global political and military re
sponsibilities than those identi
fied with the "expansionist"
school. While not denying that
this phase of Soviet policy
represents a clear break with
past practice, they tend to ex
plain its emergence not by refer
ence to long-standing imperial
Soviet ambitions but to exten
sive changes in the international
political environment, such as
the explosion of nationalist and
anticolonialist sentiment in the
Third World, which have pre
sented Kremlin policy-makers
with an abundance of low-cost
and relatively low-risk opportu
nities to expand Soviet influence
at the expense of the West.
Moreover, they believe that the
Soviets avoid serious military
involvements in those areas
deemed "immature" in revolu
tionary terms, areas in which
political and economic condi
tions are not sufficiently ad
vanced to guarantee Soviet suc
cess.
Those who subscribe to this
interpretation often charac
terize Soviet policy in such
"third areas" as cautious, pru

dent and restrained. Likewise,
they consider Soviet objectives
relatively modest in scope: to
preserve the "gains of
socialism" in those countries
already embarked on the
Marxist-Leninist path of devel
opment; to assist such progres
sive forces as may exist; and, in
pursuing these goals, to avoid
direct military confrontation
with the United States.
As most Western analysts will
readily admit, neither the
"expansionist" nor the
"defensive" model provides an

adequate framework within
which to assess Soviet attitudes
toward the use of military power
in foreign policy. Both inter
pretations capture elements of
reality and identify important
aspects of Soviet behavior. Ulti
mately, however, their attempt
at universality and their failure
to recognize that both ten
dencies can and do exist simul
taneously in Soviet policy limit
their analytical utility.
Moreover, it is extremely
unlikely that those responsible
for the conduct of the Kremlin's

foreign policy view the connec
tion between force and
diplomacy in such simple and
unambiguous terms.
The willingness of Soviet
leaders to consider the use of
military power to achieve
desired political outcomes prob
ably turns less on preconceived
notions regarding expansion or
defense than on a complicated
set of ever-changing variables,
such as the salience of the issue
(political and economic), the
utility of a military response,
perceptions of risk (political and

military), and the possible im
plications of a decision not to
act. It seems reasonable to
assume that such pragmatic con
siderations rather than more
abstract concepts of historical
experience, national character
and ideology condition Soviet
attitudes, although these factors
provide a frame of reference or
a context within which Kremlin
leaders consider their options.
While it is not possible to de
termine the precise degree to
which Soviet leaders may rely
more heavily in future years

than in the past on military
power as an instrument of
foreign policy, one can make a
number of appropriately
tentative observations and
predictions based on an analysis
of the growth of Soviet power
and of recent Soviet behavior in
three quite different contexts:
actions taken in defense of the
"socialist commonwealth"; re
lations with the West; and
policies in the Third World.
In reference to the first di
mension — the Kremlin's rela
tion with proximate Communist
allies — Soviet leaders will con
tinue to rely on their enormous
and usable military power both
to prevent the erosion of Com
munist Party control and to
preserve within these countries
their special and privileged posi
tion as security guarantor. In the
second dimension — relations
with the West — Soviet atti
tudes and policies seem likely to
icidin much of their present
form and content. The Soviets
do not anticipate that the
prospective strategic nuclear
balance of power will afford
them the opportunity for dra
matic gains at the expense of
their principal adversary.
However, the leadership does
seem to expect a further, albeit
gradual and uneven, decline in
Western Europe's commitment
to the Atlantic Alliance and a
concomitant reduction in Amer
ican influence on the continent,
as a result of the Soviet military
buildup.
With respect to the third di
mension, Soviet policies in so
called third areas, the growth of
Soviet military power — specifi
cally the expansion of the
country's power projection ca
pabilities, is almost certain to
result in more assertive Soviet
behavior in many areas of the
less developed world, including
a greater willingness than in the
past to lend military assistance
to "revolutionary" and
"progressive" forces and to
protect, again through military
means, these newly won "gains
of socialism".

If it is a central concern of
those who study Soviet military
affairs that the Kremlin aspires
to the capability to "prevail" in
the event of a nuclear war, these
analysts are only slightly less
preoccupied with the way in
which Soviet leaders envision
the relationship between mili
tary power and the conduct of
foreign policy. In its most ab
breviated form, the question
most often posed relates to
future Soviet behavior: How
will the relative and absolute
growth of Soviet military power
affect the conduct of the
country's foreign policy in the
1980s and beyond? Is the
Kremlin likely to become more

assertive in pursuit of its foreign
policy objectives as a result of
the dramatic increase in Soviet
military capabilities and if so, to
what extent and in what areas of
the world?
As the debate over the signifi

republics in 1940 to Brezhnev's
invasion of Afghanistan 40
years later, this analysis holds,
the dominant thrust of Soviet
foreign policy has been expan
sion through military means.
These analysts ascribe the
Kremlin's "expansionist" ten
dencies to the fundamental in
ternal weaknesses of the Soviet
system, which compel the lead
ership to confirm its legitimacy
and to justify its existence by
demonstrating the regime's mil
itary prowess.
They argue that, in much the
same way as several of the czar's
advisers urged initiation of a
limited war with Japan in 1904
to distract the Russian people
from their misery, the current
leadership seeks to compensate
for the system's failure by creat
ing military capabilities greater
than those of its nearest rival
and by using those resources in
the interests of the
"international class struggle."
The second school also looks
to Russian history to explain the
regime's heavy reliance on coer
cion in the conduct of foreign
policy but contends that the de
pendence derives less from ag

gressive intent or the dynamics
of the political system than from
the leadership's pervasive sense
of vulnerability and insecurity.
They see the Russian and So
viet national experience as one
of war and attempted subjuga
tion. According to this interpre
tation, much of the Kremlin's
diplomacy after 1945, beginning
with Stalin's installation of com
munist regimes in Eastern
Europe, was designed to ensure
the country's security through
the creation of a system of
dominated states along its bor
ders.
The essential character of So
viet foreign policy, especially in
the first 20 years after the
Second World War, vyas thus
defensive: to safeguard the
"gains of socialism"— if neces
sary by recourse to force.
Analysts drawn to this view of
Soviet behavior also tend to
ascribe different motives to the
Kremlin's assumption of more
global political and military re
sponsibilities than those identi
fied with the "expansionist"
school. While not denying that
this phase of Soviet policy
represents a clear break with
past practice, they tend to ex
plain its emergence not by refer
ence to long-standing imperial
Soviet ambitions but to exten
sive changes in the international
political environment, such as
the explosion of nationalist and
anticolonialist sentiment in the
Third World, which have pre
sented Kremlin policy-makers
with an abundance of low-cost
and relatively low-risk opportu
nities to expand Soviet influence
at the expense of the West.
Moreover, they believe that the
Soviets avoid serious military
involvements in those areas
deemed "immature" in revolu
tionary terms, areas in which
political and economic condi
tions are not sufficiently ad
vanced to guarantee Soviet suc
cess.
Those who subscribe to this
interpretation often charac
terize Soviet policy in such
"third areas" as cautious, pru

dent and restrained. Likewise,
they consider Soviet objectives
relatively modest in scope: to
preserve the "gains of
socialism" in those countries
already embarked on the
Marxist-Leninist path of devel
opment; to assist such progres
sive forces as may exist; and, in
pursuing these goals, to avoid
direct military confrontation
with the United States.
As most Western analysts will
readily admit, neither the
"expansionist" nor the
"defensive" model provides an

adequate framework within
which to assess Soviet attitudes
toward the use of military power
in foreign policy. Both inter
pretations capture elements of
reality and identify important
aspects of Soviet behavior. Ulti
mately, however, their attempt
at universality and their failure
to recognize that both ten
dencies can and do exist simul
taneously in Soviet policy limit
their analytical utility.
Moreover, it is extremely
unlikely that those responsible
for the conduct of the Kremlin's

foreign policy view the connec
tion between force and
diplomacy in such simple and
unambiguous terms.
The willingness of Soviet
leaders to consider the use of
military power to achieve
desired political outcomes prob
ably turns less on preconceived
notions regarding expansion or
defense than on a complicated
set of ever-changing variables,
such as the salience of the issue
(political and economic), the
utility of a military response,
perceptions of risk (political and

military), and the possible im
plications of a decision not to
act. It seems reasonable to
assume that such pragmatic con
siderations rather than more
abstract concepts of historical
experience, national character
and ideology condition Soviet
attitudes, although these factors
provide a frame of reference or
a context within which Kremlin
leaders consider their options.
While it is not possible to de
termine the precise degree to
which Soviet leaders may rely
more heavily in future years

than in the past on military
power as an instrument of
foreign policy, one can make a
number of appropriately
tentative observations and
predictions based on an analysis
of the growth of Soviet power
and of recent Soviet behavior in
three quite different contexts:
actions taken in defense of the
"socialist commonwealth"; re
lations with the West; and
policies in the Third World.
In reference to the first di
mension — the Kremlin's rela
tion with proximate Communist
allies — Soviet leaders will con
tinue to rely on their enormous
and usable military power both
to prevent the erosion of Com
munist Party control and to
preserve within these countries
their special and privileged posi
tion as security guarantor. In the
second dimension — relations
with the West — Soviet atti
tudes and policies seem likely to
icidin much of their present
form and content. The Soviets
do not anticipate that the
prospective strategic nuclear
balance of power will afford
them the opportunity for dra
matic gains at the expense of
their principal adversary.
However, the leadership does
seem to expect a further, albeit
gradual and uneven, decline in
Western Europe's commitment
to the Atlantic Alliance and a
concomitant reduction in Amer
ican influence on the continent,
as a result of the Soviet military
buildup.
With respect to the third di
mension, Soviet policies in so
called third areas, the growth of
Soviet military power — specifi
cally the expansion of the
country's power projection ca
pabilities, is almost certain to
result in more assertive Soviet
behavior in many areas of the
less developed world, including
a greater willingness than in the
past to lend military assistance
to "revolutionary" and
"progressive" forces and to
protect, again through military
means, these newly won "gains
of socialism".
