## Sun shines on the Card as it takes 2 of 3 from No.1 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sportswriter 
( all it surprising, call it improbahle —
\ini can even call it impossible, but the Stan
ford baseball team did it. rallying for three
ninth-inning runs yesterday to shock No. 1-
ranked Arizona State 13-11 and capture its
second consecutive win of the three-game
weekend series in Tempe.
I he two clutch victories in front of a par
tisan. and typical In hostile crow d boosted
the No. 14-rated Cardinal to 34-22-1 on the
season and into sole possession of second
place in the Pacific-10 Southern Division
with a 16-11 record. Stanford also inched
closer to an at-large berth in the NCAA
Regionals because I'C-Bcrkelev took two
out ot three games from USC. gixing the
Card a one-game lead over the third-place
Irojans with only three league contests
remaining. Stanford faces Cal, while USC
hosts last-place UCLA in each team's last
conference series.
"I've had some pretty good teams come
down here and not win two out of three,"
Stanford's jubilant Head Coach Mark
Marquess said yesterday. "This is the first
time (ASU has) been beaten here two out of
three all year." Marquess might have added
that between seven ASU errors and a play
reminiscent of the famous pine-tarred-bat
rhubarb, the manner in which the Sun
Devils, now 44-16 overall and 21-6 in the
"Six-Pac," were beaten was also unique.
The Card exploded for 15 hits on the day
and used a few of them to turn a 4-4 tie into
a 9-5 lead with a five-run fifth inning.

ASU's Barry Bonds led off the bottom half
of the fifth with a home run that apparently
cut the Card's advantage to 9-6. That's
when Stanford catcher L.yle Smith stepped
in.
"There's a new rule in the college rule
book where you have to have a mark IS
inches above the bat handle." said
Marquess in explanation of what ensued.
"l-\le noticed that (Bonds') bat didn't have
it.the umpire agreed and he had to call him
out. It's a silly rule, but it's a rule."
ASU Head Coach Jim Brock played the
game under protest, but probably should
have attended to his club's shoddy defense.
The Devils, who had 16 hits and six home
runs on the day. roared from behind to tie
the game at 10-10 entering the ninth inning.
ASU shortstop Romy Cucjen's second error
opened the door in the ninth for Walt Har
ris two-run single and the Card's three-run
rally that gave freshman reliever Rick Diet/
(2-0) the win.
As startling as two wins at Arizona State
may be. there was almost more. The Sun
Devils barely eked out an 8-7 triumph in the
series opener on Friday night. And even
that lone victory was largely the result of
Stanford miscues.
The Sun Devils burst to a 4-0 lead against
starter Jeff Ballard in the first two frames,
but by the time Ballard climbed the hill in
the seventh inning Stanford had forged in
front 6-5.
Uncharateristically. the Stanford defense
stumbled. With two on and two out, Bal
lard's pick-off attempt at second base

resulted in two ASI scores as the ( ardinal
committed two errors. ASI I added another
run to build an N-6 cushion.
Stanford's Mike Deßenon. a perfect
three for three on the night, cut the margin
to N-7 with a solo home run in the eighth in
ning. Doug Henry (10-2) recorded the win
while Ballard's record dropped to 7-5.
The second half of the Card's one-two
pitching punch delivered a knockout blow
the next night, as senior John Radtke scat
tered eight hits in a 6-4 complete game win.
In fact. Radtke stifled eight of the Sun Devil
hitters on just four hits en route to his fourth
complete game and his eighth win in 10
decisions this year.
The ninth, league-leading hitter Oddibe
McDowell, went four for four with three
monstrous solo home runs, a double and
four runs batted in.
Radtke's teammates, however, parlayed
three of their eight hits into four seventh
inning runs that reversed a 3-2 ASL) lead.
The key blow was a bases-loaded double by
Harris that knocked in two Cardinal runs.
Harris. Rick Lundblade and John Verducci
each collected two hits on the night to help
hang the loss on Jose Rodiles (5-5). but
Darryl Stephens' 17-game hitting string
came to an end as the senior was hitless in
four trips to the plate.
Stanford resumes its season with a non
league contest against Santa Clara at
Sunken Diamond tomorrow. Game time is
2:30 p.m.
