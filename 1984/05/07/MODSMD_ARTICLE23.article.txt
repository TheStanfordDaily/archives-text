# Varsity beats alumni playfully
## 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford alumni football
game Saturday had all the
makings of a great soap opera.
It had the rivalries: Elway vs.
Elway and Pave vs. Pave. There
were villains, like All-Pro
Green Bay wide receiver James
Lofton who played in the game
(current NFL players were not
supposed to play) and the tragic
heroes — nearly all those
middle-age players who came
out again to give football just
one more try. There were com
edians and drunks. There was
even an imposter.
Before continuing, it should
be noted for the record that the
Stanford varsity won the game
20-0. but that is not what the

game was all about. It was a fun
time for all. and a chance to
rekindle interest in the football
program. Approximately 5000
tans attended the gathering.
Among the famous alumni
who showed up at the game but
did not play were running back
Darrin Nelson, receiver Ken
Margerum and quarterbacks
John Elway and Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett served as a coach for
the alumni along with San Fran
cisco Head Coach Bill Walsh
and ex-Stanford coach Chuck
Taylor.
Four years ago, a rivalry
developed between father Jack
Elway (then of San Jose State)
and son John Elway, star quar
terback of Stanford. Yesterday,
although John was ineligible to

play, the two were on opposite
sides of the field once again,
only this time both Elvvays were
wearing red and white or white
and red as the case might be.
There was also a new rivalry
about to bloom — Paye vs.
Paye. Stanford quarterback
John Paye's father, John Paye
Sr., was a defensive back at
Stanford in 1960 and 1961. The
elder Paye not only stood across
the field from his son, but had a
chance to play against him.
"I can't show John anything,"
the elder Paye responded when
asked it he had any lessons to
show his son out on the field. "I
didn't even know that 1 was
going to play until three days
ago."

Although current NFL
players were not supposed to
play, Lofton snuck out on the
field for a couple of plays as a
decoy receiver. When Lofton
ran on the field, he got respect.
But Lofton decided to have
some fun with his decoy role
and threw a couple of vicious
blocks on unsuspecting defen
sive backs.
While Lofton played when he
shouldn't have, some alumni
who were supposed to play
probably wished that they had
not.

the fall.
gray hairs. For most of the
alumni, the only thing giving
them enough courage to enter
the game was the keg of beer on
the alumni sidelines. It also
served as a painkiller for their
brittle bones.
The alumni, however, were
not without a sense of humor.
"Getting the equipment issued
exhausted me," said Blaine
Nye, a tackle for Stanford be
tween 1965-67. Center C. B.
Simons was one of the oldest
players to see action. Simons
played between 1960-62. "I fell
down skiing a couple of weeks
ago and figured that that would
be my training to feel what a
good hit was like," Simons said.
"It's a great feeling being out
there. My daughter has never
seen me be this silly."
Probably the most charis
matic player for the alumni was
defensive end Pete Lazetich
who played on the Rose Bowl
teams of 1970 and 1971 and
coined the term
"Thunderchickens" for the
Stanford defensive line.
Lazetich showed up to the
game in blue hightop cleats
which looked almost as old as he
was. "They used to belong to
Johnny Unitas," Lazetich said.
"He gave them to me in 1973
when he was with the Chargers.
That's why they arie painted
blue. I had an ankle problem at
the time and asked whether I
could have them so he gave the
to me.
"Probably the toughest part
about this game," Lazetich con
tinued, "were the warmups. The
alumni were really hitting. But
this beer really eases the pain."

In the great soap opera tradi
tion, the alumni even had an im
poster. While linebacker Gary
Wimmer (1980-82) didn't show
up. his jersey did. The Wimmer
imposter looked big enough to
be a football player.
The alumni even had a hero
of sorts. Running back Jon Car
roll. a reserve running back and
defensive back who graduated
last year, provided some
fireworks for the alumni with
running bursts of seven and
eight yards in the first half.
Jn the second half, Carroll
provided some more excitement
when he decided to do a Marcus
Allen imitation. Running left,
Carroll didn't see any room so
he switched direction and ran
the other way. Unfortunately,
his 20 or 30 yards of running
was all in the lateral direction
and the play ended with no gain.
("I was just worried about not
getting hurt out there," Carroll
said later. "I haven't done a
thing as far as exercise goes
since last year."
The alumni team was led by
Don Bunce, who quarterbacked
Stanford in its last Rose Bowl
(1971). Bunce is now a Palo
Alto orthopedic surgeon who
often serves as the team doctor.
In Saturday's game, Bunce com
pleted 7-of-16 passes for 62
yards.
Bunce admitted, however,
that he did not do much practic
ing for the game. "I played ten
nis six weeks ago," Bunce said.
"I felt like I must be crazy going
out there."
For the Stanford varsity, run
ning back Kevin Scott carried
the ball 16 times for 170 yards
and two touchdowns. Quarter
back John Paye hit on 11-of-19
passes for 146 yards and one
touchdown while Fred Buckley
hit 7-of-8 passes for 116 yards.
