# Varsity beats alumni playfully
## 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford alumni football
game Saturday had all the
makings of a great soap opera.
It had the rivalries: Elway vs.
Elway and Pave vs. Pave. There
were villains, like All-Pro
Green Bay wide receiver James
Lofton who played in the game
(current NFL players were not
supposed to play) and the tragic
heroes — nearly all those
middle-age players who came
out again to give football just
one more try. There were com
edians and drunks. There was
even an imposter.
Before continuing, it should
be noted for the record that the
Stanford varsity won the game
20-0. but that is not what the

game was all about. It was a fun
time for all. and a chance to
rekindle interest in the football
program. Approximately 5000
tans attended the gathering.
Among the famous alumni
who showed up at the game but
did not play were running back
Darrin Nelson, receiver Ken
Margerum and quarterbacks
John Elway and Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett served as a coach for
the alumni along with San Fran
cisco Head Coach Bill Walsh
and ex-Stanford coach Chuck
Taylor.
Four years ago, a rivalry
developed between father Jack
Elway (then of San Jose State)
and son John Elway, star quar
terback of Stanford. Yesterday,
although John was ineligible to

play, the two were on opposite
sides of the field once again,
only this time both Elvvays were
wearing red and white or white
and red as the case might be.
There was also a new rivalry
about to bloom — Paye vs.
Paye. Stanford quarterback
John Paye's father, John Paye
Sr., was a defensive back at
Stanford in 1960 and 1961. The
elder Paye not only stood across
the field from his son, but had a
chance to play against him.
"I can't show John anything,"
the elder Paye responded when
asked it he had any lessons to
show his son out on the field. "I
didn't even know that 1 was
going to play until three days
ago."

Although current NFL
players were not supposed to
play, Lofton snuck out on the
field for a couple of plays as a
decoy receiver. When Lofton
ran on the field, he got respect.
But Lofton decided to have
some fun with his decoy role
and threw a couple of vicious
blocks on unsuspecting defen
sive backs.
While Lofton played when he
shouldn't have, some alumni
who were supposed to play
probably wished that they had
not.
