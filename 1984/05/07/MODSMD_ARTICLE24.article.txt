### TOM CLIFFORD 
In its last dual match of the season, the Stanford men's tennis
team went out in winning style Friday as the host Cardinal soundly
defeated the U.C.-Berkeley Bears by a score of 7-2.
The win pushes the Card's win-loss record to 19-5 overall and 7-3
in the Pacific-10 Conference. Besides gathering momentum before
the weekend s NC AA I ournament, the win over Cal gave Stanford
positive signs on other fronts as well.
As it had done in its last five victories, the Cardinal assured itself
of a win during the singles competition by claiming five of the six
matches. Stanford senior and team captain Mark McKeen lead the
Cardinal attack by knocking off Peter Wright 6-4, 6-1. McKeen's
serve and attack at the net allowed him to cruise to a relatively easy
victory.
Head Coach Dtck Gould said he thought the match was a great
way tor McKeen to end his Stanford career. "I don't know if he was
any more pumped up than usual, but Mark played one of his best
matches all year on Friday. He's going to be tough to replace; he has
the best singles record on the team and it's hard to be as consistent
as he is against all the good teams we go up against."'
Stanford's No. 5 and No. 6 players. Derrick Rostagno and John
Letts, also played outstanding tennis. Rostagno defeated Henry
Sommerville 6-3, 7-5, and Letts cruised by Edwaredo Estehan by a
score of 6-3, 6-2.
In the only singles match that the Bears won, Steve DeVries, a
freshman, knocked off Dan Goldie 6-4, 6-2. DeVries went into the
match with impressive wins over USC's and UCLA's top players
Rickey Leach and Jeff Klaparda. "It was not one of (Goldie's) bet
ter matches," Gould said.
But the good news wasn't limited to the singles play. The doubles
teams, which must win it the Cardinal is to be successful in Georgia,
came up with impressive wins on the No. 1 and No. 3 courts. Letts
and Jim Grabb teamed up to beat Sommerville and Mark Hechtina
very close match. After trading breaks in the first set, the Bears
were finally able to win by taking the tie-breaker 10-8. But that was
all the Cardinal would allow as Letts and Grabb came back and won
the next two sets 6-1, 7-5.
On the No. 3 court, McKeen and Rostagno handled Cal's Wright
and Edwardo Estehan easily by beating them in straight sets 6-4, 6-
0. McKeen and Rostagno took control of the match early and never
gave it up. Said Gould, "Mark and Derrick did and outstanding job.
Cal's No. 3 team won the NorCals and beat Grabb and Letts and
McKeen and Rostagno both in the process. But McKeen and Ros
tagno really turned it around this time. They're coming together
right now."
