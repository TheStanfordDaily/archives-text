### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
At times the pressure of playing a top-flight
collegiate sport can take the fun out of the
game. The constant struggle to win can obscure
the enjoyment the game is supposed to pro
vide. Saturday night's mixed-match tennis ex
hibition against UC-Berkeley gave the Stan
ford men's and women's tennis teams a chance
to have some fun before the battles for na
tional championships begin next week.
Part of the fun came in winning, as the Car
dinal won five of the six one-set matches en
route to a 34-18 victory. The match consisted
of a men's singles, women's singles, men's
doubles, women's doubles and two mixed
doubles matches. Team scoring was the total
number of games won.
The players seemed somewhat more relaxed
for the exhibition than usual. The first match of
the evening seemed to set the mood, as Eric
Rosenfeld and Patty Fendick defeated Chris
Schoop and Mary Margaret Torres, 6-2.
Rosenfeld reacted to being aced by Torres
early in the match with a grin, and Fendick said
later the pair wasn't worried about the final
outcome. "We just went out there and said,
'Let's just have fun and who cares who
wins?' "
They may not have cared who won, but the
Cardinal players ended up doing most of the
winning. In the second match, Kate Gompert
fell behind Linda Oeschle, 2-0, but Gompert
came back to win the next six games and win
the set, 6-2, giving Stanford a 12-4 lead.
The third match was a doubles contest be
tween Jim Grabb and John Letts and the
Bears' Peter Wright and Eduardo Estaban,
and the Cardinal duo recorded another 6-2 win
to make it 18-6.

In the women's doubles, Elise Burgin and
I inda Gates came out strong and simply over
whelmed Vicki Corrales and Julie Grummel,
6-1, to give Stanford an insurmountable 24-7
lead.
The men's singles match was the only one
the Card dropped on the evening, as Cal's
Steve DeVries defeated Derrick Rostagno, 6-
3. Rostagno played outstanding tennis in the
first six games to stay even with DeVries.
In the seventh game Rostagno came up with
the best shot of the evening. Caught up near
the net, Rostagno took off toward the baseline,
ran down the ball and hit a blind, backward
shot that DeVries couldn't handle. DeVries,
however, won the game and closed out the set
to make it 27-13.
The last match was also the final match at
Stanford for men's team captain Mark
McKeen. Prior to the match. Cardinal Men's
Coach Dick Gould introduced McKeen, who
received an ovation from the 2000 or so fans in
Maples Pavilion.
McKeen and his partner, Leigh Anne
Eldredge, then went out to win the best match
of the evening over Harold Hecht and Stacy
Savides. With the set tied 5-5 and the game
even at 3-3, Eldredge fired an ace past Savides
to give the Cardinal a 6-5 lead. The pair then
broke Savides serve for the 7-5 win.
Gould also felt the match was good for his
team. "It was a nice change of pace," he said.
"It's good to come in here, have some fun and
keep tennis in perspective."
Tennis may tend to get out of perspective
next week, as the men's team heads to Athens,
Ga., and the women to Los Angeles for their
respective NCAA championships, but for one
evening both teams had a chance to go out and
have fun.
