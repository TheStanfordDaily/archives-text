First year
"Only the good die young." he
wrote, and the first-year staffers' issue
is coming up soon. No connection
meant there, hut we do mean that all
first-year Daily Tards should prepare
to meet at the office Thursday, 4 p.m.
so the "Uptown Girl" can take an offi
cial first-year picture. The first-year
staffers' issue comes out Monday.
Diane Patterson says, "this is my life."
but she'll be there anyway.
Next year
Declarations arc due tonight at mid
night for all interested in running for

the "big shot." the editor of Vol. I N6.
The grill session â€” your chance to see
the candidates "just the way they are"
- is set for May 15. The election is
May 16.
This summer
"Summer Highland Falls." he said.
We don't know what that means, but
we do know that anyone interested in
summer editor positions should talk to
Adam soon. Summer positions are ap--
pointed by the spring editor. Also up
for grabs are the editorships of the
Summer Visitor's Guide and the Com
mencement issue. Beth Kleid will not
be here this summer. What?
