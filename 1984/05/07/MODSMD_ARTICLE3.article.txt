### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
A handful of Stanford students became heroes
early Saturday morning when they apprehended a
Mountain View man who allegedly stole money
and jewelry from a Roble Hall room.
Stanford Police arrested Matthew Gereer in
front of Roble Hall after a group of students at a
party chased him through Roble and outside at
about 1:30 a.m. Saturday.
Freshman Marvin Jackson, one of the students
who helped in the chase, said Gereer "stumbled
and fell" outside Roble, where he was surrounded
by students until police arrived.

Police took Jackson to the North County Jail in
Palo Alto, where he remained last night on bur
glary charges.
Jackson said the man's brother was also at Roble
Friday night, but said there was "no evidence" the
brother had participated in the crime.
Roble resident assistant George Bengston said
he was told there were "two guys hanging around
the party who looked suspicious" before the chase
began, and that "there may have been another"
person involved in the theft.
Bengston said police made a "thorough search"
and took fingerprints in the Roble C-wing first
floor room, but police refused to comment further
on the case.

Several room doors on the wing were left open
durirfg the party, Bengston said.
Bengston said students began the chase after
"someone told" a student that "one or two people
had gone into her room." Roble RAs refused to
release the identity of the room's occupant.
Bengston said the "merry chase" went through
Roble's "Zoo Room," television room and base
ment before students "ran (the thief) out of the
basement."
Roble RAs were unsure and police refused to
say exactly what had been stolen.
"From what I know," Jackson said, the thief
"stole just a few coins that meant a lot to the per
son but weren't worth much."
