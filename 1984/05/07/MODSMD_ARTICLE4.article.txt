# Professor starts debate by petitioning for quiet skies
## 
### HOWARD DAVIDSON 
The Pali) Alto Airport has become the focus of
growing attention and concern in recent months, ever
since a Stanford professor helped to publish a petition
under the heading of "Citizens for Quiet Skies."
The petition, which appeared as an advertisement in
the March 2 I issue ot The Palo Alto Weekly, claims
"the danger and noise generated by the airport are a
detriment to life in Palo Alto and Stanford" and goes
on to urge local citizens to send written protests to the

'Noise pollution is the last in the
series of environmental pollutions
we've become aware of. And the
question is / why should Palo Alto
and Stanford residents be sprayed
by the unnecessary noise of a few
private plane owners? '
- English Prof. John Felstiner

Palo Alto City Council which "has the power to cancel
the airport lease."
So far. more than 90 concurring responses have been
generated, according to English Prof. John Felstiner.
the petition's co-author, who said he sees the conflict in
terms of "an environmental issue" comparable to the
recent debate over cigarette smoking in public areas.
"Noise pollution is the last in the series of environ
mental pollutions we've become aware of." Felstiner
said. "And the question is. why should Palo Alto and
Stanford residents be sprayed by the unnecessary noise
of a few private plane owners? One person's right ex
tends only until it infringes on another's."

But local pilots feel they are the ones whose rights
are being jeapordized in this issue.
Carl Eisen. an instructor with the Palo Alto Flying
Club, said he is concerned about what he calls "a po
tential threat to my livelihood." Eisen stressed the fact
that "a very large number" of people depend upon the
airport in order to earn a living.
Other airport proponents have echoed Eisen's
feelings, claiming the single-runway bayside facility not
only creates jobs directly hut also increases access to,
and thus stimulates, many local corporations.
Even Felstiner conceded that "the airport is big busi
ness." But, he said, "as much as I appreciate American
tree enterprise, let them not expand their business at
my expense." Felstiner said he regularly spots small
airplanes flying as low as 500 feet, in direct violation of
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reguations
which require a minimum cruising altitude of 1000 feet
for general aviation over populated areas.
Felstiner said these acts of negligence are probably
the result of "a small percentage of the flyers." an
opinion which is shared by Greg Kendall, a veteran
pilot who lives in Palo Alto.
"There is no one in the world more aware of aircraft
noise than a pilot." Kendall said. "And if such repeated
flagrant violations are going on. the individuals respon
sible should be dealt with by the FAA."
But. according to Felstiner. that route has already
been tried unsuccessfully since the FAA "just doesn't
seem concerned right now." Felstiner attributes what
he sees as administrative indifference to "the nature of
bureaucracies" which, as a rule, "tend to support and
not regulate" the industry under their jurisdiction.
Felstiner said he plans to take the case to the Palo
Alto City Council and "talk to the mayor." He said he
is hopeful some kind of compromise can be reached al
though he is not certain exactly what it would entail nor
by when it could be negotiated
