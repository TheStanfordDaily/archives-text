East Beirut from the city's predominately Moslem

Large voter turnout in Panama
Panama C'itv —Panama's first presidential election by
direct popular vote in 16 years brought a heavy turnout yes
terday as many voters cast ballots early in the morning to beat
the midday tropical heat.
From Chiriqui province on the northern border with Costa
Rica to the Darien jungle bordering on Colombia on the
south, the voting was reported to have gone forward in an or
derly way at the 3200 polling places, most of which were at
schools.
This election marked the return to full democracy in this
Central American country of two million people after an ex
tended period of military rule dominated by the late Gen.
Omar Torrijos, commander of the National Guard.
Torrijos" heir is Nicolas Ardito Barletta, 45. the presiden
tial candidate of a center-left coalition. Ardito Barletta is an
economist with experience in government as Panama's
former minister of planning and an international reputation
as former regional vice president for Latin America of the
World Bank, from 1978 until early this year.
Ardito Barletta, a former close adviser to Torrijos, had the
tacit backing of the 10,000-man National Guard, now under
the command of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. But he had
never run for elective office before and his appeal to voters,
half of whom have never voted for president, was untested.
The opposition candidate, rated as Ardito Barletta's
strongest rival, is Arnulfo Arias, an 82-year-old political
maverick. Arias has been elected president three times before
since 1941, and each time he was deposed b\ the National
Guard. The last rime was in 1968 when Torrijos took power.
Mondale, Jackson consider
joint voting rights task force
Houston —Democratic presidential candidates Walter
Mondale and Jesse Jackson are considering setting up a task
force headed by former Democratic Chairman Robert Strauss
to resolve their differences over voting rights issues prior to
the party convention in July, Mondale said Friday. ,
"There was a feeling that something along this line was
needed," said the former .vice president. "1 don't think it is
mature or ripe enough to even describe when it would occur."
Although Mondale indicated that his chief rival. Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart, would be involved in the unity effort, the ini
tiative clearly was based on the assumption that Mondale will
win the nomination and as the party's candidate will need to
satisfy Jackson in order to reap the black vote. Blacks, who
make up 13 percent of the population, are expected to vote in
record numbers in November.
Mondale said the negotiations with Jackson had developed
out of a series of discussions between them based on "the im
portance of uniting at the convention so that we can defeat
Ronald Reagan."
While Jackson has always promised to support the
nominee, he has recently raised fears of a schism at the con
vention by saying that he could not support any candidate
who endorses discriminatory voting practices.
San Onofre plant leaks gas
San Clemente, California —The San Onofre nuclear power
plant leaked a small amount of radioactive gas for the second
time in a week Saturday, a federal nuclear regulatory official
said.
Plant personnel noticed a leak at 3:26 p.m. in the
hydrogen-oxygen gas monitor, which was being returned to
service at Unit 2 after "routine calibration," according to
Frank Bello. spokesman for the Southern California Edison
Co. Edison operates the triple-reactor facility about 65 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.
The problem was corrected about 6:45 p.m., but not before
plant personnel declared an "unusual event" at 6:40 p.m.,
said Jim Hanchett, spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
Unusual events are called when radioactive releases exceed
federal limits, said Hanchett, describing Saturday's leak as a
"very small release" from a waste-gas sampling system.
There was no effect on plant personnel or the public,
Hanchett said.
White House not hopeful
for pre-election arms talk
Washington —White House officials have all but given up
hope the Soviets will return to nuclear arms-control talks
before the November election.
"They don't seem to be capable of getting the message,"
said one senior Reagan administration official, who disclosed
that a U.S. envoy's recent trip to Moscow evoked no signal
that the new kremlin leadership is interested in setting dates
for renewed talks on strategic or intermediate-range weap
ons.
Separate Geneva talks on limiting intermediate-range
missiles in Europe and on reducing the superpowers' inter
continental arsenals broke off when the United States and its
NATO allies began their long-planned deployment of cruise
and Pershing 2 missiles in Western Europe last December.
Hut many officials trace the collapse to the Soviet downing
three months earlier of a South korean jetliner, which they
say so soured U.S.-Soviet relations that any chance for reach
ing an accord before the December deployment deadline
evaporated.

Large voter turnout in Panama
Panama C'itv —Panama's first presidential election by
direct popular vote in 16 years brought a heavy turnout yes
terday as many voters cast ballots early in the morning to beat
the midday tropical heat.

Rica to the Darien jungle bordering on Colombia on the
south, the voting was reported to have gone forward in an or
derly way at the 3200 polling places, most of which were at

tended period of military rule dominated by the late Gen.
Omar Torrijos, commander of the National Guard.
Torrijos" heir is Nicolas Ardito Barletta, 45. the presiden
tial candidate of a center-left coalition. Ardito Barletta is an
economist with experience in government as Panama's
former minister of planning and an international reputation
as former regional vice president for Latin America of the
World Bank, from 1978 until early this year.

tacit backing of the 10,000-man National Guard, now under
the command of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. But he had
never run for elective office before and his appeal to voters,
half of whom have never voted for president, was untested.

maverick. Arias has been elected president three times before
since 1941, and each time he was deposed b\ the National

Mondale, Jackson consider
joint voting rights task force
Houston —Democratic presidential candidates Walter
Mondale and Jesse Jackson are considering setting up a task
force headed by former Democratic Chairman Robert Strauss
to resolve their differences over voting rights issues prior to
the party convention in July, Mondale said Friday. ,
"There was a feeling that something along this line was
needed," said the former .vice president. "1 don't think it is
mature or ripe enough to even describe when it would occur."
Although Mondale indicated that his chief rival. Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart, would be involved in the unity effort, the ini
tiative clearly was based on the assumption that Mondale will
win the nomination and as the party's candidate will need to
satisfy Jackson in order to reap the black vote. Blacks, who
make up 13 percent of the population, are expected to vote in
record numbers in November.
Mondale said the negotiations with Jackson had developed
out of a series of discussions between them based on "the im
portance of uniting at the convention so that we can defeat
Ronald Reagan."
While Jackson has always promised to support the
nominee, he has recently raised fears of a schism at the con
vention by saying that he could not support any candidate
who endorses discriminatory voting practices.
San Onofre plant leaks gas
San Clemente, California —The San Onofre nuclear power
plant leaked a small amount of radioactive gas for the second
time in a week Saturday, a federal nuclear regulatory official
said.

hydrogen-oxygen gas monitor, which was being returned to
service at Unit 2 after "routine calibration," according to
Frank Bello. spokesman for the Southern California Edison
Co. Edison operates the triple-reactor facility about 65 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.

plant personnel declared an "unusual event" at 6:40 p.m.,
said Jim Hanchett, spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
Unusual events are called when radioactive releases exceed
federal limits, said Hanchett, describing Saturday's leak as a
"very small release" from a waste-gas sampling system.
There was no effect on plant personnel or the public,
Hanchett said.
White House not hopeful
for pre-election arms talk
Washington —White House officials have all but given up
hope the Soviets will return to nuclear arms-control talks
before the November election.
"They don't seem to be capable of getting the message,"

that a U.S. envoy's recent trip to Moscow evoked no signal
that the new kremlin leadership is interested in setting dates
for renewed talks on strategic or intermediate-range weap
ons.
