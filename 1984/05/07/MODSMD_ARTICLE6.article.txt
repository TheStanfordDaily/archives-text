free ol the bureaucratic loulups that
marred the first round of voting
Running for election were the top
vote-getters in the March balloting:
Former President Jose Napoleon
Duarte. a centrist Christian Democrat,
and Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former
army major accused of links to rightist
death squads. Salvadoran officials said
they will release no voting results until at
least later today.
Duarte, 58. has vowed to seek
negotiations with the leftist guerrillas
battling the government. D'Aubuisson.

tlefield if he is elected to the five-year
term.

fied. The aircraft carrying reporters was
hit and slightly damaged, but no one was

vers,'
At least six bombs exploded in San
Salvador, and rebel sabotage blacked out
half the country, including the capital for
a short time. Repair crews restored
power in most of the area later in the
day.
In a midday broadcast, the guerrillas'
clandestine Radio Venceremos claimed
there was no voting in 54 eastern towns,
but telephone checks showed voting was
normal in some of the tow ns named.

Carol de Andreu. spokeswoman tor
the Central Election Council, said there
was no voting in about 40 towns under
rebel control compared to 58 in March.

The balloting appeared free ot the bu
reaucratic bungling that kept about
200.000 out of 1.8 million eligible voters
from casting ballots in the first round on
March 25.
"It's too early to say for sure, but in
general things were much more orderly
than last time, although there have been
