From the Los Angeles Times
Seoul, South Korea — Unfazed by the incident of a
young korean man who lunged at his vehicle with a cap
pistol. Pope John Paul II began winding up a five-day
visit to South korea yesterday bv elevating 93 koreans
and 10 French missionaries to sainthood.
The pontiff, who calmly went about his appointed
schedule after the cap-gun episode, solemnly prayed
for Christians in Communist North Korea and in China
who have been cut off from the church by their govern
ments.
John Paul also met briefly with the leaders of other
sects in this historically multireligious country, praising
the "priceless heritage" of the Buddhists, Con
fucianists, animists and Protestants who heavily out
number the Roman Catholics of South korea.
In his last major public appearance before flying to
Papua. New Guinea, early today, the pope encaps
ulated the distressing preoccupations of modern youth.
Speaking to a gathering of about 6000 Catholic teen
agers at Jangchung Gymnasium in Seoul, lie said:
"There are many things in vour own lives that trou

ble you: Why must school be a place of such pitiless
competition? Why is there such a difference between
what you are told at home and what you hear at school?
Why do your seniors seem so unwilling to understand
and accept you, your ideas and your wishes? What are
you to think of all the dishonesty, contradictions and in
justices around you — all of which are presented to you
as being inevitable in the social context? Why must lite
be such an uphill struggle against built-in obstacles, es
pecially for those of you who are already working so
hard in your young years? What can you do about
peace in your own country and in today's world, so full
of violence and hatred?"
The answer, John Paul said, is to take up "weanons
. . . of a different kind." These, he said, "are truth,
justice, peace and faith, and they are invincible."
The only incident that marred an otherwise perfect
papal visit yesterday under sunny spring skies was the
perplexing episode of a 22-year-old night-school stu
dent who "fired" a cap gun in the direction ol the pope
as he was being driven to Myongdong Cathedral for a
prayer service.

Police identified the young man as Lee Joon Kyu and
said that he was "mentally disturbed."
The episode did not deter the papal motorcade. The
pontiff proceeded to the cathedral to pray and meet
briefly with 47 dissident political figures.
Police Superintendent Choi Jae Sam told reporters
later that Lee was "motivated by an urge to surprise the
pope, just for fun. . . ."
Lee is being held for psychiatric study.
Choi said, "The culprit said that he could not under
stand all this fuss over a well-intended act on his part to
greet a good friend by letting off a toy pistol blast."
Police were uncertain whether Lee actually fired the
harmless cap pistol but said that one security officer did
fire a live round from his automatic weapon into the
roadway in front of Lee to try to deter him before he
was tackled and taken into custody.
Choi said that Lee's father described the youth as
mentally unstable and said that he had been in seclu
sion in two Buddhist monasteries recently as a treat
ment for his condition.
