Reagan ends China trip
J resident Reagan coneluded his six
day China trip luesday "confident
that U.S.-China relations are good
and getting better."
I he trips main successes centered
on economic themes. Reagan and
Chinese Premier /.hao /.iyang signed
a tax agreement designed to encour
age private U.S. investment in China
and a nuclear cooperation agreement
that will enable U.S. manufacturers to
compete for building contracts on the
10 to 1 2 nuclear plants China plans to
build in the next decade. In addition,
to coincide with Reagan's visit, China
and Occidental Petroleum signed a
contract to develop jointly the world's
largest open-pit coal mine — a $640
million venture.
However, discussions on global is
sues were called "frankest," the term
used by diplomats for disagreements.
I he Chinese voiced objections to U.S.
missile deployments in Western
Europe and disapproved of U.S.
policy in Central America and the
Middle East. The Chinese were also
reluctant to join Reagan's anti-Soviet
stance. On successive days the
Chinese news media censored anti-
Soviet remarks made by Reagan. Fi
nally, both sides agreed that Reagan's
visit had not altered either country's
view on the Taiwan issue.
On his way to relax at Camp David
alter the trip, Reagan met with Pope
John Paul II in Alaska for 20 minutes.
The Pope was en route to South
Korea.

Budget work continues
Action on next year's federal
budget centered around the Senate
last week. Debate was slowed by
election-year qualms, but progress
was made on the defense budget and
decisions were reached on proposals
to freeze federal spending and to ex
pand the president's budgetary
powers.
In testimony before the Senate
Armed Services Committee on
Thursday, Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger proposed trim
ming $13.9 billion from the $305 bil
lion military budget proposed four
months ago. The cuts, in response to
Congressional pressure and record
breaking budget deficits, fell mainly
on conventional weapons and left the
major strategic weapons systems —
the MX missile, the B-l bomber and
the Trident missile- iring submarine —
untouched. Several members of the
committee predicted changes in the
composition of the budget cut, but
said that the total cut would remain
around the $13.9 billion level.
In other budget action, the Senate
rejected a proposed one-year freeze
on federal spending that would have
reduced federal deficits over the next
three years by $242 billion and
defeated a proposed constitutional
amendment to give the president line
item veto authority for spending bills.
U.S. accused of interference
The major news in Central America
was the upcoming presidential elec
tion in El Salvador. Salvadoran voters

went to the polls yesterday to decide
whether Christian Democrat Jose
Napoleon Duarte or Roberto
d'Aubuisson of the right-wing Arena
party will be the next president of El
Salvador. The U.S. claims that it is
taking no sides in the election, but the
moderate Duarte is clearly Washing
ton's preference. Arena has claimed
that the United States has interfered
in the elections by funding, through
the CIA and the U.S. Agency for In
ternational Development, organiza
tions supporting Duarte.
Violence in the region brought two
more countries into the news. Fighting
threatened to spill over into new areas
as Costa Rica, which allows
Nicaraguan rebels to use its border
areas, exchanged mortar fire with
Nicaraguan government forces. The
Reagan administration said it would
speed up military aid to Costa Rica. In
Colombia, left-wing guerillas
launched a series of attacks which left
three policemen dead.
Foreign ministers of the nine-nation
Contadora group began meetings in
Panama City last Monday to resume
their search for a peaceful solution to
the Central American controversies.
Progress was impeded by differences
over political and military issues, and a
joint statement declared that "The
progress we made in the meeting con
trasts with the alarming increase in
regional violence, military activity and
weaponry as well as with the increas
ing foreign military prescence in the
area."

Mondale takes control
Former Vice President Walter
Mondale's two-to-one edge in
delegate^and his victories last week in
Texas arid Tennessee began to shift at
tention from the primaries to Demo
cratic unity and possible campaign
tickets.
On Friday, Democratic party chair
man Charles Manatt announced the
formation of a task force to build party
unity. The Rev. Jesse Jackson added
to unity hopes by holding a series of

meetings with Manatt, hut Saturday
he promised supporters he might still
have a "joker" to play at the conven
tion. Colorado Senator Gary Hart
claimed that the task force was a trick
to help Mondale sew up the nomina
tion before the conclusion of the pri
maries.
In Texas, Mondale supporters
voiced their support for Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen (D-Tex.) as a running mate
for Mondale. Hart's name is still on
the list of prospective vice-presidents.

and prominent women in the Demo
cratic party have begun suggesting
female running mates. Jackson,
however, is being mentioned less and
less due to his association with Louis
Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader
who threatened to kill a black reporter
for writing unsympathetic stories
about Jackson.
The primaries resume tomorrow in
Ohio, Indiana, Maryland and North
Carolina.
