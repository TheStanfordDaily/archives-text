## The
						Stanford Daily From foothills to NYC 
### 
A lot of University faculty, staff and alumni
worked long and hard to engineer the recent
"Life in the 21st Century" conference in New
York, and the whole Stanford community shares
in their success.
Fueled by six of the University's seven schools,
the Stanford libraries, the Athletic Department
and the Hoover Institution, the four-day
"invasion of New York by Palo Alto" meant
more than the mere drumming up of money and
support from the 2000 alumni who attended.
For the 60 faculty and all the others ferried
across the continent, it was a chance to sell Stan
ford to a long-neglected East Coast. The Univer
sity pitch took many forms, from formal addresses
by Nobel Prize-winners to a run led by University
President Donald Kennedy through Central Park.

Kennedy left the Big Apple smiling, but don't
be tooled into thinking his trip was some sort of
vacation. Take a look at his busy schedule, and if
that's not enough, talk to some of the other parti
cipants â€” the Business School professor who had
35 meetings in three days, for example.
1 he conference, in short, was a chance for some
highly capable people to unite in a good cause
with mutual benefits. Such opportunities prob
ably won't happen unless someone devotes a
good deal of creative energy to making them hap
pen.
The New York venture offered a glimpse at the
power of disparate segments of the University
working in concert. Stanford would be well
served to devise other projects aimed at tapping
this potential.
