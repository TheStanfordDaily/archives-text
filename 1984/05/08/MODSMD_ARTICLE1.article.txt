### CLINT HIGHFILL Daily staff 
At the Motorola Co. annual
meeting yesterday, the University
hacked a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to end all
sales to the South African military
and police.
In addition, the President's
Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility recommended to a
Board of Trustee committee that
the University support similar
resolutions dealing with Mobil Oil
Corporation, Texaco Incorporated
and Xerox Corporation.
The Hoard of Trustees Special
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility will consider the additional
resolutions at this morning's
meeting.
The odds of the resolutions get
ting a majority vote are "very, very
slight," but the the University's in
tent is to influence thoughtful
members of the board of directors,
according to Kirk Hanson, chair
man of the President's Commission
and a CiSB lecturer.
"We're raising the ante for com
panies doing business in South
Africa," Hanson said. "If a com

pany does those things, then they
are contributing more to the devel
opment of Blacks, Asians and
Coloureds of South Africa than
they are harming by participating
in the economy."
Motorola "sold radio equipment
to the South African police and
military in late 1982 or early
1983," Hanson said. Motorola
made a similar sale prior to 1977,
when controls on sales to South
Africa were imposed by the Carter
administration.
The commission believes com
panies should not sell equipment
used directly in the enforcement of
apartheid. U.S. foreign policy
prohibited such sales from 1978
until 1982, when the Reagan ad
ministration lifted the controls.
Motorola also operates in South
Africa. Its record in adhering to the
Sullivan principles, a group of six
principles that American compan
ies operating in South Africa are
urged to follow, is "not outstand
ing," according to the committee.
The shareholder proposals urge
the companies to adopt Bishop
Desmund Tutu's conditions for
employers and to follow the Sul

livan principles on employ ment.
The Tutu conditions are a series
of recommendations for foreign
employers in South Africa to fol
low that were outlined in a speech
by Tutu, who is the general secre
tary of the South African Council
of Churches.
Tutu urged employers to present
family-type accommodations for
workers, to recogni/e black trade
unions, to announce to the South
African government their opposi
tion to laws which regulate the
movements of black workers in
South Africa and to adopt resolu
tions in favor of investment in

black education and training.
The Rev. Leon Sullivan of
Philadelphia, a member of the
General Motors board of directors,
founded- the Sullivan organization
in 1971. One hundred forty U.S.
companies have signed an agree
ment to comply with the principles.
The commission "has never sup
ported" the University selling its
shares in companies that do busi
ness with South Africa because it
believes that "adherence to the
Sullivan principles and Bishop
Tutu's principles will lead to the
eventual deterioration of the apart
heid system," Hanson said.
