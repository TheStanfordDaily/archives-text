## The 						Stanford Daily An academic theme 
### 
Amid all the campus debate currently going on
about theme houses, one thing is clear:
Theme houses as they are now must be changed.
We applaud the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) for its recommendations on ways
to improve the theme houses on campus and to
make them more consistent with the philosophy
of residential education at Stanford.
The range of theme houses on campus is
diverse — from the ethnic theme houses such as
Ujamaa, /apata and Okada to residences like La
Maison Francaise, Haus Mitteleuropa and Amer
ican .Studies. Problems exist in all, the main rea
son being the failure to clarify the goals of the
houses and to make sure these goals have not
become either ignored or unnecessary.
First, the University must insist that the
theme houses serve educational pursuits. That
means academics. That means stiff course re
quirements for those who want to live in the
house. C-US pointed out that social programs and
social support are not enough of a basis for the
existence of a theme house. While this seems like
an obvious reference to fraternities, one cannot
ignore that all theme houses — ethnic and sup
posedly academic — must follow this guideline.
In other words, ethnic priorities should no
longer be the primary requirement for being ac
cepted into "ethnic" theme houses. As the Uni
versity claims to insist, academics must be at the
foundation of all theme houses. Therefore, theme
houses such as Ujamaa, Zapata and Okada
should be filled only with sophomores, juniors or
seniors who wish to live there and have the inter
est to fulfill requirements in the academic area of
the respective culture with which each is con
nected.
In this way. just as Casa Italiana requires lan
guage classes for its residences, a house like
Ujamaa would require Afro-American Studies

classes. We recommend that requirements for all
theme houses be stiffened across the board. For
example, consider American Studies: Taking one
American Studies course per year and attending a
1 -unit in-house class each quarter is not demand
ing enough to show actual commitment to the
house — a necessity for theme houses to succeed.
Ethnic theme houses also provide support sys
tems for their minority members. While such pro
grams are valuable, the support system should be
secondary to the primary residential education
goal of academics in a theme house. Such support
is quite likely to continue, but no theme house
should be able to get away with using that func
tion as its sole basis of existence. Other organi
zations such as the Black Student Union and El
Centro Chicano can also serve this function.
Recognizing the changes the enforcement of
the academic goal may bring in the size of current
theme houses, we also support the flexibility
which C-US recommends be taken with theme
houses. If Zapata can't fill its Stern house, then it
should be moved to a smaller residence. If
Ujamaa needs more room, it could be moved to a
larger facility.
Practically speaking there is no way for these
moves to occur every year, but they do need to be
made now to adapt better to the current situation.
We should match the housing to the current interest,
not to the interest which may have existed 10
years ago.
As the committee report states, ** . . . some
existing theme houses may well disappear be
cause of insufficient numbers of interested stu
dents, but it is likely that new theme houses will
be developed as sufficiently large groups of stu
dents indicate such interest." This by no means
spells the end of theme houses at Stanford, but
will only serve to improve them.
