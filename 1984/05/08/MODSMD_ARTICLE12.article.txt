All one needs to do lately is to scan

the ongoing battle over the merit of
fraternal organizations at Stanford.

over entire groups and the whole
Greek system, while positive action by
a complete group takes a back seat.
Fraternal organizations have the po
tential to contribute a great deal to
both the individual fraternity member
as well as the entire Stanford commu
nity.
Stanford is the unique setting for a
magnitude of competition for personal
achievement in all facets of collegiate
life: athletics, scholarship, community
service, social life. Membership in a
fraternal organization offers the indi
vidual a sense of continual support in
the midst of change. This stability
enables one to gain the courage to
risk, fail and extend oneself in ways
not possible alone. Brilliant examples
Of leadership and visibility on campus
are provided by fraternity and sorority
members as a demonstration of the
power of such a stable force. For ex
ample. more than 40 percent of Cap and
Gown, the women's honor society at
Stanford which recognizes scholarship
and outstanding leadership, are mem
bers of sororities. Furthermore, lead
ership possibilities are also available
within the governing of the fraternal
organization itself. If Stanford
recognizes the value of other support

groups on campus as powerful agents
in the community, so it should ac

Fraternal organizations do support
the goals of the Stanford Residential
Education program. Although active
formal programming may be at a sub
optimal level in many fraternity
houses, the cohesive atmosphere is an
excellent catalyst for informal discus
sions about such topics as race and re
ligion. Delta Gamma sorority has had

subjects as women's self defense,
career planning and alcoholism, in ad
dition to cultural excursions to the
theater and symphony. As a resident
of a self-op for two years, 1 can attest
to the lack of formal residential pro
gramming in most of the row houses.
Finally, fraternal organizations have
purposes which go beyond that of so
cial networks: They are community
service, philanthropic organizations.
Sigma Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternities hold an annual senior citi
zen dinner and an Easter egg hunt.

Delta Gamma recently held a dance
a-thon to raise money ior sight conser
vation and was voted radio station
KYUU's group of the week. Each
fraternal organization has a responsi
bility to its national philanthropy. Al
though fraternal organizations at
Stanford have not utilized their full
potential as contributors to campus
life, part of the reason for this is the
antagonistic relations with the Stan
ford community. At other universities,
active Greek systems are vital compo
nents of campus life. Greeks at UC-
Santa Barbara voluntarily participate
in freshmen orientation, as well as or
ganize an all-California intersorority
volleyball tournament and interfrater
nity baseball tournament, whose
proceeds go to multiple sclerosis. If
allowed to reach full potential, frater
nal organizations can make a valuable
service contribution to the Stanford
community.
The future of the Greek fraternal
system at Stanford is currently under
critical review by the Task Force On
Fraternities and Sororities at Stanford.
I believe that a stronger governing,
more policy-oriented IFC-ISC body
will encourage the growth of a better
Greek system. Furthermore, 1 hope
the University as well as the entire
Stanford community recognizes the
positive potential of a focused,
cohesive fraternal organization in
promoting continuity, leadership and
community service within the student
body.
