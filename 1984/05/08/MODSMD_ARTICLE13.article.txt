## The 						not-so-free press in Nicaragua

•Revolution is a very attractive word, hut not all
change is good. All revolutions are made in the
name of freedom, but few have achieved that."
This is how Pedro Jaoquin Chamorro. editor of La
Prensa. Nicaragua's sole remaining independent
newspaper, began a lecture sponsored by the De
partment of Communication in late April on "The
Difficulty of Maintaining a Free Press in a Revolu
tionary Setting." In Chamorro's view. Nicaragua is

VIEWPOINT

heading down the road to Cuban-style
totalitarianism.
Chamorro, whose father was killed by Somoza's
national guard in 1975. is hardly a rightwinger, but
even though his family was instrumental in top
pling the Somoza dynasty, he has had the courage
to admit that the revolution has soured. The fun
damental principle of the revolution was freedom,
he explained, but even before the end of 1979. the
military junta of the Sandinistas began curtailing
the liberties of the Nicaraguan people. "The main
goal in a Marxist-Leninist revolution," he
declared, "is total control of society to ensure the
continued existence of a single party ."
Totalitarianism is something with which
Americans cannot come to grips. Living in a
country where the communications media are so
advanced that we often seek refuge from the infor
mation blitz, we seem unable to conceive of a soci
ety in which the government seeks total
information control, i.e., where the press, televi
sion. telephone, radio, mail, music, movies, art.
literature and education are subject to censorship.
"Freedom of the press is like love."' Chamorro ob

served, "you don't appreciate it until you've lost
it."
Censorship is not new in Nicaragua. Somo/a fre
quently closed La Prensa, he tortured Chamorro's
father and finally destroyed their offices in June,
1979. Still, Chamorro believes "the present
regime's censorship is much worsy because it's
ideological." Somoza's censorship was sporadic
and clumsy: the Sandinista's control is systematic
and meticulous. Every morning, Chamorro must
submit proofs of that evening's edition to "The
Directorate of Media and Communication" (19N4
is here, he joked) which reviews every headline,
article, photo and advertisement. The censors
dictate what must be cut, and the filler material
must he proofed as well. Somoza's people deleted
with a black pen: the Sandinista's prohibit
Chamorro from leaving empty spaces which would
testify to the fact of censorship.
What gets cut? A photo of an elephant on water
skis in Florida, a picture of faulty Cuban tires and
an advertisement for an optical store apologizing
for a temporary lack of frames. Why? Because
nothing good happens in the United States, noth
ing bad is produced in Cuba, and Nicaragua is a
socialist paradise of harmony and plentitude.
Other items unfit for print have included mention
of Brezhnev's bad health, a letter from Pope .lohn
Paul II to the bishops of Nicaragua and news of
economic dysfunctions in North Korea and the
Eastern Bloc. The censors once excised a com
munique from the minister of health regarding de
fective Bulgarian canned goods which posed a
health hazard, and when La Prensa carried a piece
about PLO guerrillas training in Moscow, the cen
sors shut down the presses for 48 hours.
Chamorro's only mode of protesting excessive

censorship is not to print, and since the imposition
of official censorship in 19N2 (de facto censorship
existed before), he has done so 25 times, knowing
that the silence of La Prensa makes a deafening
proclamation that something is amiss in a land
where, officially, the revolution has been an un
mitigated success. He is discouraged by those writ
ers who have sold out. sacrificing journalistic
integrity lor personal existence, but he fights on,
inspired by the paper's heritage.
Daily, Pedro Chamorro asks himself if it's all
worth it, creating a paper for the censors to
destroy. Still, he believes that as long as La Prensa
can offer a modicum of divergence from the uni
form mass of the state-controlled media, as long as
people are willing to pay the higher price to read a
suggestion of the truth and as long as he is able to
provide foreign embassies with examples of the
censorship, he will keep the presses rolling.
But he vows that the day the censors cross the
line from proscribing the news to prescribing it,
snuffing out the last voice of opposition in
Nicaragua, La Prensa will cease — and with it, the
spirit of freedom which led to the ousting of
Somo/a. "If the Sandinistas can't tolerate one
newspaper," he asks, "how will they ever tolerate
democracy?"
It's time America takes another look at
Nicaragua. The Sandinistas have perverted the
people's struggle for liberation into a communist
dictatorship, which, if consolidated, will result in
total suppression of all human freedom. They have
betrayed the revolution. Chamorro has had the
courage to acknowledge that fact. Don't we have
enough guts to consider the possibility?

country where the communications media are so
advanced that we often seek refuge from the infor
mation blitz, we seem unable to conceive of a soci
ety in which the government seeks total
information control, i.e., where the press, televi
sion. telephone, radio, mail, music, movies, art.
literature and education are subject to censorship.
"Freedom of the press is like love."' Chamorro ob

served, "you don't appreciate it until you've lost
it."
Censorship is not new in Nicaragua. Somo/a fre
quently closed La Prensa, he tortured Chamorro's
father and finally destroyed their offices in June,
1979. Still, Chamorro believes "the present
regime's censorship is much worsy because it's
ideological." Somoza's censorship was sporadic
and clumsy: the Sandinista's control is systematic
and meticulous. Every morning, Chamorro must
submit proofs of that evening's edition to "The
Directorate of Media and Communication" (19N4
is here, he joked) which reviews every headline,
article, photo and advertisement. The censors
dictate what must be cut, and the filler material
must he proofed as well. Somoza's people deleted
with a black pen: the Sandinista's prohibit
Chamorro from leaving empty spaces which would
testify to the fact of censorship.
What gets cut? A photo of an elephant on water
skis in Florida, a picture of faulty Cuban tires and
an advertisement for an optical store apologizing
for a temporary lack of frames. Why? Because
nothing good happens in the United States, noth
ing bad is produced in Cuba, and Nicaragua is a
socialist paradise of harmony and plentitude.
Other items unfit for print have included mention
of Brezhnev's bad health, a letter from Pope .lohn
Paul II to the bishops of Nicaragua and news of
economic dysfunctions in North Korea and the
Eastern Bloc. The censors once excised a com
munique from the minister of health regarding de
fective Bulgarian canned goods which posed a
health hazard, and when La Prensa carried a piece
about PLO guerrillas training in Moscow, the cen
sors shut down the presses for 48 hours.
Chamorro's only mode of protesting excessive

censorship is not to print, and since the imposition
of official censorship in 19N2 (de facto censorship
existed before), he has done so 25 times, knowing
that the silence of La Prensa makes a deafening
proclamation that something is amiss in a land
where, officially, the revolution has been an un
mitigated success. He is discouraged by those writ
ers who have sold out. sacrificing journalistic
integrity lor personal existence, but he fights on,
inspired by the paper's heritage.
Daily, Pedro Chamorro asks himself if it's all
worth it, creating a paper for the censors to
destroy. Still, he believes that as long as La Prensa
can offer a modicum of divergence from the uni
form mass of the state-controlled media, as long as
people are willing to pay the higher price to read a
suggestion of the truth and as long as he is able to
provide foreign embassies with examples of the
censorship, he will keep the presses rolling.
But he vows that the day the censors cross the
line from proscribing the news to prescribing it,
snuffing out the last voice of opposition in
Nicaragua, La Prensa will cease — and with it, the
spirit of freedom which led to the ousting of
Somo/a. "If the Sandinistas can't tolerate one
newspaper," he asks, "how will they ever tolerate
democracy?"
It's time America takes another look at
Nicaragua. The Sandinistas have perverted the
people's struggle for liberation into a communist
dictatorship, which, if consolidated, will result in
total suppression of all human freedom. They have
betrayed the revolution. Chamorro has had the
courage to acknowledge that fact. Don't we have
enough guts to consider the possibility?
