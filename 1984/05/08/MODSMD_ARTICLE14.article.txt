The Soviets have a wry joke about their two major na
tional newspapers, Pravda and Izvestia. "Nyet pravdy r iz
vestia i nyet izvestia r pravde," they opine. ("There's no
truth in News and no news in Truth.")
In diseussions with Soviet emigre acquaintances,
though, 1 usually heard far different opinions. They
vociferously protested that it is possible to learn .is much
from Pravda as from The New York Times, provided "you
know how to read it." On hearing this, my incredulity was
matched only by my horror of the extent to which the
regime had succeeded in brainwashing such people.
As it turns out. though, there is more than a grain of
truth to the Soviets' contentions. Provided one reads care
fully, pays close attention to nuances and knows how to in
terpret contradictions, it is possible to learn quite a lot
from the Soviet press. For the uninitiated, the road to
comprehension is strewn with laughter and astonishment
— yet it invites serious reflection.
In the process. I realized how these Soviets came up
with the Pravda-New York Times analogy. Space and
manpower limitations mean that editorial decisions must
be made in the course of publishing any paper. Even the
finest American papers sometimes skirt issues or slant
facts to project a particular viewpoint. Readers of the con
trolled press are more sensitive than are Westerners to dis
tortion in the name of creating "reality," but no newspa
per is entirely free of the practice.
While there's nothing like the Soviet press to make one
appreciate the San Francisco Chronicle, deciphering
Pravda leaves nary a dull moment. Since I'm working on a
research project that deals with Poland and the Solidarity
crisis, I've paid special attention to the Soviet Union's ef
forts to contain the brewing rebellion. Watch the crisis un
fold:
Pra\da, Aug. 1, 1980, page one
The meeting (between Leonid Brezhnev and Edward
Gierek) took place in an atmosphere of cordiality and com
plete mutual understanding.
Note: It is mutually understood that if Gierek doesn't do
something about the strikers in Gdansk, he'll be looking
for a new job.
Pravda, March 5, 1981, page one
The meeting's participants (including Brezhnev, Yuri
Andropov, Gromyko, Mikhail Suslov, Defense Minister
Dmitri Ustinov, Central Committee Chairman K.V.
Rusakov, Kama, Wojciech Jaruzelski. and two lesser
Polish lights) . . . makes even greater the need for
strengthening the unity and solidarity of the fraternal
socialist countries.
Note: Another of those monochromatic rainbow coali
tions. You can just see all those Head Reds glowering
down the felt-topped conference table at the pointedly
outnumbered Polish delegation.
Pravda, Dec. 5, 1981, page four
Socialist camp ministers of defense and Kulikov atten
ded; Ustinov chaired the meeting. The Committee of
Defense Ministers discussed the current activities of the
Joint Armed Forces and took the appropriate decisions. The
meeting was held in a business-like atmosphere, in a spirit
of friendship and mutual understanding.
Note: Head for the hills, kids.

One of the great adjurations of professional Pravda
readers, •"watch the obituaries." is especially helpful in
reading between the Party lines. Many people have heard
of Khrushchev's ignominious demise in 1971 a la Pravda:
Pensioner Niktta Sergeevich Khrushchev dies.
Every so often, the Soviet press will reveal some facet of
life in the West in the course of making some other politi
cal point. My favorite lines are those which concern the ex
ploited, oppressed workers ol America. They are barely
able to feed and clothe themselves, and political freedom
is a sham. Imagine the confusion of the Soviet worker,
then, when he reads the following lines.
In denouncing the "bandit attacks on Grenada," Pravda
reported that "the restlessness of Americans and their
predilection for a change of scenery is common knowl
edge. Every year millions of U.S. citizens make tourist and
other trips to almost every part of the globe." Whoops. To
prove the action was universally condemned, another arti
cle stated, "All across the country, from New York to San
Francisco, mass protest actions are breaking out these
days."
Sometimes, the intrepid reader can glean almost as
much from what the newspapers don't say as from what
they do include. Consider this pair of July 20, 1953, arti
cles from Pravda about the Atommash nuclear power
plant in Volgodonski: . . . The leadership of the Atom
mush Production Association has exercised unsatisfactory
control over the quality ofdesi^n-and-estimate documents
and construction work, and it has not ensured the accident
free operation of utility lines . . .
The second article in its entirety reads: The Presidium of
the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet has formed an all-Union
U.S.S.R. State Committee for Atomic Power Safety.
Somehow, one gets the feeling that the Presidium is not
just worried about utility lines. The first article also briefly
mentions — but does not deign to explain — certain
"serious errors and miscalculations." What happened at
the power plant to set officials quaking in their boots?
Speculation does serve to stretch the mind, which is use
ful considering that Pravda doesn't have a crossword puz
zle. But why is such a mental steeplechase necessary?
The obvious answer is that the Soviet press is an instru
ment ol the Soviet government; as such, it prints only what
the Party deems suitable. Access to undoctored informa
tion in the U.S.S.R. is drastically restricted. This would al
most be cause for gloating were it not for two unhappy
tacts which form a vicious circle: Lack of competition in
one-newspaper cities often yields a mediocre product, but
not enough citizens care enough either to demand a better
quality paper or to support a competitor.
Certainly the American press will never be like Pravda:
Our commitment to First Amendment freedoms is deep
and enduring. Regardless, Americans must cherish press
freedom fiercely; like a democratic government, it must be
constantly guarded. Not every American need take an ac
tive role in politics, but all should vote — and, in order to
cast an informed ballot, should at least take the time to
read a newspaper.

fully, pays close attention to nuances and knows how to in
terpret contradictions, it is possible to learn quite a lot
from the Soviet press. For the uninitiated, the road to
comprehension is strewn with laughter and astonishment
— yet it invites serious reflection.
In the process. I realized how these Soviets came up
with the Pravda-New York Times analogy. Space and
manpower limitations mean that editorial decisions must
be made in the course of publishing any paper. Even the
finest American papers sometimes skirt issues or slant
facts to project a particular viewpoint. Readers of the con
trolled press are more sensitive than are Westerners to dis
tortion in the name of creating "reality," but no newspa
per is entirely free of the practice.
While there's nothing like the Soviet press to make one
appreciate the San Francisco Chronicle, deciphering
Pravda leaves nary a dull moment. Since I'm working on a
research project that deals with Poland and the Solidarity
crisis, I've paid special attention to the Soviet Union's ef
forts to contain the brewing rebellion. Watch the crisis un
fold:
Pra\da, Aug. 1, 1980, page one
The meeting (between Leonid Brezhnev and Edward
Gierek) took place in an atmosphere of cordiality and com
plete mutual understanding.
Note: It is mutually understood that if Gierek doesn't do
something about the strikers in Gdansk, he'll be looking
for a new job.
Pravda, March 5, 1981, page one
The meeting's participants (including Brezhnev, Yuri
Andropov, Gromyko, Mikhail Suslov, Defense Minister
Dmitri Ustinov, Central Committee Chairman K.V.
Rusakov, Kama, Wojciech Jaruzelski. and two lesser
Polish lights) . . . makes even greater the need for
strengthening the unity and solidarity of the fraternal
socialist countries.
Note: Another of those monochromatic rainbow coali
tions. You can just see all those Head Reds glowering
down the felt-topped conference table at the pointedly
outnumbered Polish delegation.
Pravda, Dec. 5, 1981, page four
Socialist camp ministers of defense and Kulikov atten
ded; Ustinov chaired the meeting. The Committee of
Defense Ministers discussed the current activities of the
Joint Armed Forces and took the appropriate decisions. The
meeting was held in a business-like atmosphere, in a spirit
of friendship and mutual understanding.
Note: Head for the hills, kids.

One of the great adjurations of professional Pravda
readers, •"watch the obituaries." is especially helpful in
reading between the Party lines. Many people have heard
of Khrushchev's ignominious demise in 1971 a la Pravda:
Pensioner Niktta Sergeevich Khrushchev dies.
Every so often, the Soviet press will reveal some facet of
life in the West in the course of making some other politi
cal point. My favorite lines are those which concern the ex
ploited, oppressed workers ol America. They are barely
able to feed and clothe themselves, and political freedom
is a sham. Imagine the confusion of the Soviet worker,
then, when he reads the following lines.
In denouncing the "bandit attacks on Grenada," Pravda
reported that "the restlessness of Americans and their
predilection for a change of scenery is common knowl
edge. Every year millions of U.S. citizens make tourist and
other trips to almost every part of the globe." Whoops. To
prove the action was universally condemned, another arti
cle stated, "All across the country, from New York to San
Francisco, mass protest actions are breaking out these
days."
Sometimes, the intrepid reader can glean almost as
much from what the newspapers don't say as from what
they do include. Consider this pair of July 20, 1953, arti
cles from Pravda about the Atommash nuclear power
plant in Volgodonski: . . . The leadership of the Atom
mush Production Association has exercised unsatisfactory
control over the quality ofdesi^n-and-estimate documents
and construction work, and it has not ensured the accident
free operation of utility lines . . .
The second article in its entirety reads: The Presidium of
the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet has formed an all-Union
U.S.S.R. State Committee for Atomic Power Safety.
Somehow, one gets the feeling that the Presidium is not
just worried about utility lines. The first article also briefly
mentions — but does not deign to explain — certain
"serious errors and miscalculations." What happened at
the power plant to set officials quaking in their boots?
Speculation does serve to stretch the mind, which is use
ful considering that Pravda doesn't have a crossword puz
zle. But why is such a mental steeplechase necessary?
The obvious answer is that the Soviet press is an instru
ment ol the Soviet government; as such, it prints only what
the Party deems suitable. Access to undoctored informa
tion in the U.S.S.R. is drastically restricted. This would al
most be cause for gloating were it not for two unhappy
tacts which form a vicious circle: Lack of competition in
one-newspaper cities often yields a mediocre product, but
not enough citizens care enough either to demand a better
quality paper or to support a competitor.
Certainly the American press will never be like Pravda:
Our commitment to First Amendment freedoms is deep
and enduring. Regardless, Americans must cherish press
freedom fiercely; like a democratic government, it must be
constantly guarded. Not every American need take an ac
tive role in politics, but all should vote — and, in order to
cast an informed ballot, should at least take the time to
read a newspaper.

The Soviets have a wry joke about their two major na
tional newspapers, Pravda and Izvestia. "Nyet pravdy r iz
vestia i nyet izvestia r pravde," they opine. ("There's no
truth in News and no news in Truth.")
In diseussions with Soviet emigre acquaintances,
though, 1 usually heard far different opinions. They
vociferously protested that it is possible to learn .is much
from Pravda as from The New York Times, provided "you
know how to read it." On hearing this, my incredulity was
matched only by my horror of the extent to which the
regime had succeeded in brainwashing such people.
