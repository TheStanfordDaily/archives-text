They just come back for one more game. Saturday's Alumni Legends Football Game
drew dozens of former Stanford greats back to The Farm to take on Jack Elway's current
varsity squad.

line. (Top) Former Stanford and San Francisco 49er wide receiver Gene Washington

Card QB John Paye, talks with another former player, Tom Williams. (Bottom right)
Football players weren't the only alums present. Current and former Stanford Dollies
gathered on the field for a few reunion dances. (Bottom left) Amid the hoopla, the alums
even managed to squeeze in a little football. Alumnus Chuck Evans showed that he's
lost little of the fighting spirit over the years with a brutal tackle attempt on Quarterback
Fred Buckley. (Left) Despite the heroic efforts of Stanford's Rose Bowl quarterback Don
Bunce, the alums lost the game, 20-0.
