## Women undefeated after LA win 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
"It's a long season, but it we
can stay healths, I think we've
got the best team." Stanford
Women's Tennis Head Coach
I rank Brennun made this
remark Feb. 3 after the Cardinal
began its season with a 7-2 vic
tory over San Jose State.
Sunday, after over three
months of play, the netters
proved Brennan right and
finished that long season unde
feated by do\s nine No. 4-ranked
I CI A by an S-l score. That's
right folks. S-l. The Cardinal
dropped just one match to the
fourth-best team in the nation
and finished the regular season

with a 22-0 record.
"Impressive" hardly does this
justice.
For openers, consider who
the Cardinal beat this year: the
Bruins. No. 5-ranked San Diego
State and No. 7-ranked USC.
among others. And the netters
defeated those teams both at
home and on the road, not an
easy task. Consider that when
Stanford went down to Los An
geles. USC had lost only one of
its hist 95 matches at home.
Look at the individual results.
The netters as a team won 170
of the individual matches
this season, an NN percent rate
of winning.
Sunday's match should have

been difficult. The Bruins are
the only team to have defeated
Trinity, the team that replaced
Stanford in the No. 1 spot in the
rankings last month. Last time
the two teams met. the Cardinal
barely escaped with a 5-4 win.
This time there would be no
doubt. When Kate (iompert
blanked No. 13-ranked Patricia
Hy in the final set to gain a'b-3.
2-ft. 6-0 win at No. 3 singles, she
gave Stanford an insur
mountable 5-1 lead after the
singles matches.
The Cardinal opened up
quickly hy winning the first four
singles matches. Patty Fcndick
defeated No. 7-ranked
Elizabeth Minter at first singles.

(t-4. 6-3: I inda Gates beat
Karen Dewis at No. 2. 5-7. h-2.
6-4: I eigh Anne Eldredge
topped No. 24-ranked Lynn
lew is at No. 4. 6-3. 6-1: and at
No. 6 Llise Burgin got a start at
singles and recorded a 6-3. 6-3
win over Jessica Algazi.
At No. 5 Stephanie Saxides
had a chance to put the match
away hut dropped a tough
match to Jane Thomas. <">-7. 6-4.
6-3.
I he doubles matches proved
in be meaningless, but the Card
swept them anyway. Lendick
and Eldredge came back to
defeat Lewis and Minter. the
No. 6 doubles pair in the nation.
6-7. 6-3, fi-2. at No. 1. At No. 2
Burgin and Gates took a close
match from Dewis and Thomas
in straight sets, 7-6. 7-5. while
at No. 3 Gompert teamed with
Savides for a 6-1, 7-h win over
Hy and Algazi.
The netters ended the season
with five players having five or
less losses in singles. Gompert
leads that list with an IN-1
mark, followed In Eldredge
(22-2), Michelle Weiss (23-3),
Fendick (27-4) and Gates (26-
5). All five qualified for the in
dividual competition at the
NCAA Championships.
Additionally, all three
doubles teams — Fendick-
Eldredge, Weiss-Gompert and
Burgin-Gates — will compete in
the individual doubles competi
tion. Last year Burgin and
Gates finished second in the na
tion.
The team competition at the
NCAAs will begin Saturday and
run until next Tuesday, while
the individual tournament will
take place next Thursday
through next Sunday. The team
section will feature the top 16
teams in the nation, while 64
singles players and 32 doubles
teams qualified for the individ
ual tournament.
In all likelihood the Cardinal
— which won the WCAA cham
pionship with a 14-0 conference
record — will be the No. 2 seed
in Los Angeles as the nation's
only undefeated team. As Bren
nan said, however, after Trinity
replaced Stanford as the No. 1
team last month, "What I care
about is being No. 1 after the
NCAAs." The netters are
looking like that will likely
become a reality next week.

Trinity, the team that replaced
Stanford in the No. 1 spot in the
rankings last month. Last time
the two teams met. the Cardinal
barely escaped with a 5-4 win.
This time there would be no
doubt. When Kate (iompert
blanked No. 13-ranked Patricia
Hy in the final set to gain a'b-3.
2-ft. 6-0 win at No. 3 singles, she
gave Stanford an insur
mountable 5-1 lead after the
singles matches.
The Cardinal opened up
quickly hy winning the first four
singles matches. Patty Fcndick
defeated No. 7-ranked
Elizabeth Minter at first singles.

(t-4. 6-3: I inda Gates beat
Karen Dewis at No. 2. 5-7. h-2.
6-4: I eigh Anne Eldredge
topped No. 24-ranked Lynn
lew is at No. 4. 6-3. 6-1: and at
No. 6 Llise Burgin got a start at
singles and recorded a 6-3. 6-3
win over Jessica Algazi.
At No. 5 Stephanie Saxides
had a chance to put the match
away hut dropped a tough
match to Jane Thomas. <">-7. 6-4.
6-3.
I he doubles matches proved
in be meaningless, but the Card
swept them anyway. Lendick
and Eldredge came back to
defeat Lewis and Minter. the
No. 6 doubles pair in the nation.
6-7. 6-3, fi-2. at No. 1. At No. 2
Burgin and Gates took a close
match from Dewis and Thomas
in straight sets, 7-6. 7-5. while
at No. 3 Gompert teamed with
Savides for a 6-1, 7-h win over
Hy and Algazi.
The netters ended the season
with five players having five or
less losses in singles. Gompert
leads that list with an IN-1
mark, followed In Eldredge
(22-2), Michelle Weiss (23-3),
Fendick (27-4) and Gates (26-
5). All five qualified for the in
dividual competition at the
NCAA Championships.
Additionally, all three
doubles teams — Fendick-
Eldredge, Weiss-Gompert and
Burgin-Gates — will compete in
the individual doubles competi
tion. Last year Burgin and
Gates finished second in the na
tion.
The team competition at the
NCAAs will begin Saturday and
run until next Tuesday, while
the individual tournament will
take place next Thursday
through next Sunday. The team
section will feature the top 16
teams in the nation, while 64
singles players and 32 doubles
teams qualified for the individ
ual tournament.
In all likelihood the Cardinal
— which won the WCAA cham
pionship with a 14-0 conference
record — will be the No. 2 seed
in Los Angeles as the nation's
only undefeated team. As Bren
nan said, however, after Trinity
replaced Stanford as the No. 1
team last month, "What I care
about is being No. 1 after the
NCAAs." The netters are
looking like that will likely
become a reality next week.


)ae So/Daily
No. 13 was not unlucky for sophomore Kate Gompert on Sunday when she beat No. 13-
ranked UCLA player Patricia Hy 6-3, 2-6, 6-0 in the No. 3 singles position.
