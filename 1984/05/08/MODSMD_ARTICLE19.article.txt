Oakland (AP) — Oakland A's pitcher Mike
Norris will he arraigned today following his arrest
at a budget motel for investigation of drug posses
sion, an Alameda County prosecutor said yester
day.
Deputy District Attorney John Bell said,
however, that Norris will "at most" face a single
charge of possessing cocaine instead of the four
drug counts alleged by police.
"We'd just stick to the basic (count) and let the
minor ones slide," explained Bell, who said Norris
had just a tenth of a gram of cocaine with him
when he was arrested Sunday at the Sixpence
Motel.
Police booked Norris for allegedly possessing
cocaine, narcotics paraphernalia and marijuana,
and for alleged possession of cocaine for sale. The
29-year-old former ace was freed later in the day

on $9250 bail.
A's Manager Steve Boros expressed surprise
about the arrest as the team returned from Sun
day's 4-3 loss to the Minnesota Twins.
"I'm shocked, of course." said Boros. "It's a
problem throughout society, throughout sports.
You'd like to think that your players are not in
volved. I guess that's naive."
Norris, who went 22-9 and finished a close
second in Cy Young voting in I9NO. signed a $?>
million contract in 1981 that expires after next
season.
Norris won four and lost five last year. He
didn't pitch in the majors after Aug. 6 and un
derwent surgery to repair damaged muscles in his
right shoulder — formally diagnosed as*in
fraspinatus — three months later. Norris has a 57-
59 career record over seven seasons with the A's.
