# USW blasts University press release
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
Officials ot United Stanford Workers (USW)
have accused the University ot attempting to
"mislead and demoralize" bargaining-unit mem
bers by distributing what they call an inaccurate
and poorly identified news release.
The University last week released a statement
entitled "Technical, maintenance and service
workers at Stanford have lacked union representa
tion since February, NLRB says.'" Ihe release
referred to the NLRB's (National l.abor Relations
Board) final rulings on Stanford's unfair labor
practice charges against 1 ocals 7 I 5 and 6KO.
The NI.RB ruled April 30 that Local 715 ceased
in February to represent USW. USW officials say
the University press release, which was widely dis
tributed on campus, implied that the
ruling meant the Stanford workers are not
represented by a union.
Meanwhile, USW President Linda Crouse said
she was tiring of the Legal Office's stalling and
would take (SSO's call lor University recognition di
rectly to the Board of Trustees' meeting this mor

ning.
"We believe (University President) Donald
Kennedy is receiving distorted information about
the union which he then passes to the Board of
Trustees," she said. "This misinformation can
create a serious problem in labor relations at Stan
ford. We would like to avoid that problem.
Therefore we are directly releasing this informa
tion to the board."
Officials at USW say that the ruling does not
necessarily mean that Stanford workers are not
represented. They claim that the workers are
represented by Local 6KO. USW voted in an April
IS referendum election to be represented by 680.
The University's press release implies that the
election held by USW will be ruled invalid, USW
officials charge. The NLRB is still investigating
Local 680's charges against the University, the
results of which will determine the election's
validity.
Michael Eisenscher, consultant to USW.
claimed the release was designed to look like an
NLRB document, saying that the language, the
title and the lack of identification, other than a line

saying "for information contact: Bob Beyers," was
intended to make the notice look like an NLRB
press release.
Bob Beyers is the director of the University
News Service.
Eisenscher said there was "no way" for anyone
who did not know Beyers' affiliation with Stanford
to know the release was connected with the Uni
versity.
Mary Ann Tenuto, labor consultant to USW,
agreed. "It looks like an NLRB form press
release," she said. "It's really deceitful."
Local 6so has been attempting to gain recogni
tion as TTSW's sole legal representative since
beginning disaffiliation proceedings from Local
715 last December. USW had been represented by
Local 715 since 680 affiliated with the countywide
local in 1980.
Eisenscher called last week's distribution of
flyers a "conscious effort to both mislead and
demoralize" employees and other members of the
Stanford community by misrepresenting the effects
of last week's NI.RB ruling.
hisenscher said the distribution was
on a scale "never before seen." adding
that the union office had received live
or si\ calls from people in main differ
ent areas asking the meaning ol the
statement.
Stanford officials had mixed state
ments regarding the extent of the dis
ti ibution.
I niversity Stall Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler denied that the distribution
of the news release was any more
widespread than usual. She said the
notices had been released according to
the "standard distribution process" to
'major departments and vice
presidential offices."
Beyers said he knew "that SI.AC
(Stanford I inear Accelerator Center)
people were planning a wide distribu
tion." but that News and Publications
was not involved in any such effort.
Doug Dupen. director of personnel
at SI AC. said 200-300 notices had
been either distributed or posted on
bulletin boards at SI.AC. He said he
did not know about the distribution
procedure on the rest of campus.
Beyers, Dupen and Wheeler all
agreed the notice was circulated to in
form the Stanford community about
the NI.RB ruling and its effects on
Local 6NO.
Eisenscher called the notice a
"scurrilous piece of propaganda"'
whose contents were "misleading
from the title on down." He said the
aim of the flyers was to make
employees believe that the "whole
battle (recognition of Local 680) is
hopeless, that the University will al
ways prevail."
