## Bob Goldthwait is crazy, but he's a good conversation piece 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
Bob "The Bobcat" Gold
thwait is perplexed.
What I don't understand,"
he rasps, in a querulous,
gravelly voice, "is why people
come up to me after my shows
and ask if I want to go out with
them and get messed up. Look
at me; am I the kind of man

For my part, the Bobcat need not have
wondered. There was no way hew ould
have been given any invitation, cfasp/te the
fact that he's a funny, inventive comedian,
as he is, above all, stark raving mad.

you'd want in your home after a
few drinks'*" He makes a fran
tic, windmilling toss. "Crash!
Yowl!"
He turns to face some imagi
nary friend, a look of pure dis
appointment on his face. "What
do you mean, you don't have
any more pets? This party is
really going to suck, now."
For my part, the Bobcat need
not have wondered. There was
no way he would have been
given any invitation, despite the
fact that he's a funny, inventive
comedian, as he is, above all,
stark raving mad.
Do not take that for an over
statement. It is hard to under
stand just how frighteningly
mad Mr. Goldthwait is until
you have seen him. He entered
the stage seemingly amid an
apoplectic fit, sputtering and
raving for several minutes
before he said something that
could be understood as human
speech.
The best analogy tor his be
havior lies in a comparison to
some great Shakespearean actor
performing a mad scene. Sound

and fury aplenty
The first minutes of the show
were, as you can understand,
somewhat uncomfortable. I had
heard the Bobcat on Alex Ben
net's K(jAK morning radio
show, and although he did growl
alarmingly, he was able to cope
with reality sufficiently to crack
some funny jokes. Onstage at

the Bijou, however, it seemed as
if the strain was too much for
him.
The crowd that night was
familiar with him, however, and
that seemed to settle him down
— as much as was possible. The
theme for the night did remain
"madness," but after the early
part of the show we were
treated to an insider's view,
rather than being affronted by
the display of a spectacularly
warped court jester.
"I went to see a psychiatrist.
He told me that I have
homicidal tendencies. He asked
me, 'What makes you mad?' I
told him. High medical bills.'
He said. 'Oh.' 1 asked him how
much I owed him. He said, '43
cents.' ,
"So I stabbed him eight times
in the head."
Bobcat's humor isn't just
stereotypical crazy-guv jokes,
although he did remark about
the guys who come up to him in
San Francisco and say things
like "'I never put meat in my
hair. 1 ' 'Hey, you should come
down to Palo Alto with me; I

think they'll pay you, too.' "He
seems to have a real perspective
on insanity. He tells a story of a
job interview:
' I went to see this guy, and he
was looking at my resume, and
he says, 'I see that from 1980 to
19K1 you were in a mental insti
tution.' 'Oh, that,' " says the
Bobcat, smiling the innocent
mischievous smile possible only
to the savagely crazed. " I
thought you were going to men
tion that.' He looked at my
resume again, and he noticed
that I was back again a year
later. I said I had to go back,
"cause it was the reunion."
Was he really institutional
ized? I don't know. Is the crazi
ness an act? Yes, undoubtedly.
Some of the best parts of his act
were when he let down the mask
of howling insanity to satirize
his stage persona (by heckling
from offstage) or his fans. Still,
it's possible he's insane enough
to know he sometimes has to
pretend to be able to get by.

'He asked me, "What makes you mad?" I
told him, "High medical bills." He said
"Oh." I asked him how much I owed him.

After his show, my com
panion confessed she was
troubled by his act. It had made
her feel uncomfortable at times,
and she said she would have
enjoyed it better if he had
played it straighter all the way
through. I agreed with her,
pretty much, but I had to note
that there was method in his
madness.

The Bijou, in order to justify
$10 tickets ($7.50 with the ad in
The Daily), had brought in two
other comics, Susan Healy, who
put on a good show after a slow
start, including one absolutely
hilarious section, and Leland
Cotton Brown. Brown's act was
very funny, ranging from joke
telling to celebrity impersona
tions to musical parodies. He
was very funny (indeed, the
whole show the Bijou presented
was thoroughly professional and
well worth the price), and was in
fact the high point of the show
for inc, but I had to look at the
ad to find his name.
Goldthwait mii>ht not have
been as consistently funny, but
he is a heck of a lot more
memorable because of his style.
His closing words were: "I hope
I made you laugh, but if not I
hope at least you talk about me
during the car ride home."
I think he succeeded, and I
think the Bijou has something
very hot on its hands with live

comedy. The theatre is intimate,
the quality of the acts that first
night was consistently superior
and you could watch top-rate
comedy while paying the com
edians roughly the minimum
wage. The next show at the
Bijou is next Monday with
Dana Carvev headlining, and if
it's anything like this first show I
wholeheartedly recommend it.


Bob Goldthwait's performance was the first of many comedy nights the Bijou Theatre has
scheduled for this spring and summer.

Do not take that for an over
statement. It is hard to under
stand just how frighteningly
mad Mr. Goldthwait is until
you have seen him. He entered
the stage seemingly amid an
apoplectic fit, sputtering and
raving for several minutes
before he said something that
could be understood as human
speech.
The best analogy tor his be
havior lies in a comparison to
some great Shakespearean actor
performing a mad scene. Sound

and fury aplenty
The first minutes of the show
were, as you can understand,
somewhat uncomfortable. I had
heard the Bobcat on Alex Ben
net's K(jAK morning radio
show, and although he did growl
alarmingly, he was able to cope
with reality sufficiently to crack
some funny jokes. Onstage at

the Bijou, however, it seemed as
if the strain was too much for
him.
The crowd that night was
familiar with him, however, and
that seemed to settle him down
— as much as was possible. The
theme for the night did remain
"madness," but after the early
part of the show we were
treated to an insider's view,
rather than being affronted by
the display of a spectacularly
warped court jester.
"I went to see a psychiatrist.
He told me that I have
homicidal tendencies. He asked
me, 'What makes you mad?' I
told him. High medical bills.'
He said. 'Oh.' 1 asked him how
much I owed him. He said, '43
cents.' ,
"So I stabbed him eight times
in the head."
Bobcat's humor isn't just
stereotypical crazy-guv jokes,
although he did remark about
the guys who come up to him in
San Francisco and say things
like "'I never put meat in my
hair. 1 ' 'Hey, you should come
down to Palo Alto with me; I

think they'll pay you, too.' "He
seems to have a real perspective
on insanity. He tells a story of a
job interview:
' I went to see this guy, and he
was looking at my resume, and
he says, 'I see that from 1980 to
19K1 you were in a mental insti
tution.' 'Oh, that,' " says the
Bobcat, smiling the innocent
mischievous smile possible only
to the savagely crazed. " I
thought you were going to men
tion that.' He looked at my
resume again, and he noticed
that I was back again a year
later. I said I had to go back,
"cause it was the reunion."
Was he really institutional
ized? I don't know. Is the crazi
ness an act? Yes, undoubtedly.
Some of the best parts of his act
were when he let down the mask
of howling insanity to satirize
his stage persona (by heckling
from offstage) or his fans. Still,
it's possible he's insane enough
to know he sometimes has to
pretend to be able to get by.

After his show, my com
panion confessed she was
troubled by his act. It had made
her feel uncomfortable at times,
and she said she would have
enjoyed it better if he had
played it straighter all the way
through. I agreed with her,
pretty much, but I had to note
that there was method in his
madness.

The Bijou, in order to justify
$10 tickets ($7.50 with the ad in
The Daily), had brought in two
other comics, Susan Healy, who
put on a good show after a slow
start, including one absolutely
hilarious section, and Leland
Cotton Brown. Brown's act was
very funny, ranging from joke
telling to celebrity impersona
tions to musical parodies. He
was very funny (indeed, the
whole show the Bijou presented
was thoroughly professional and
well worth the price), and was in
fact the high point of the show
for inc, but I had to look at the
ad to find his name.
Goldthwait mii>ht not have
been as consistently funny, but
he is a heck of a lot more
memorable because of his style.
His closing words were: "I hope
I made you laugh, but if not I
hope at least you talk about me
during the car ride home."
I think he succeeded, and I
think the Bijou has something
very hot on its hands with live

comedy. The theatre is intimate,
the quality of the acts that first
night was consistently superior
and you could watch top-rate
comedy while paying the com
edians roughly the minimum
wage. The next show at the
Bijou is next Monday with
Dana Carvev headlining, and if
it's anything like this first show I
wholeheartedly recommend it.


Bob Goldthwait's performance was the first of many comedy nights the Bijou Theatre has
scheduled for this spring and summer.
