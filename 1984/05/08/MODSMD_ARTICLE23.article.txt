Mistah Highfill —he dead
That is my dream. That is my
nightmare. A first-year staffer, slither
ing across the edge of an Vacto knife
— and surviving.
"First year staffer, they told me
you've been using questionable meth
ods in a feeble attempt to put out
Monday's Dailv."
"Well, have I?"
"I don't know. I don't see any
method at all."
First-year staffers should meet at the
Inner Station, in the jungle adjacent to
The Daily offices, at 4 p.m. Thursday.
A photograph is scheduled, followed
by a discussion of strategy directed by
Kurtz's widow, a.k.a. Jill Gilbert.
Correction
Due to editing errors in yesterday's
Daily, Marv in Jackson, one of the stu
dents who assisted in Saturday's con
tainment of a suspected thief at Roble
Hall, was reported as having been
taken to jail on burglary charges. The
Daily meant to report that the suspect,
Matthew Gereer, was taken to the jail.
The Dailv regrets the error.
