# 150 albums missing from KZSU's library
## 
### 
More than 150 record albums are
missing from K/SIJ. the campus radio
station, and some ol the members of
the stall may be implicated in the
theft, managers of the station say.
Linda Christie. K/SU's program
director, said the missing albums are
primarily recordings that were
recently obtained by the station. She
said some disc jockeys' shows are
being hampered because of the lack ol
albums.
"I think whoever's doing it knows
what they're doing and they're doing a
good job of it." Christie said. "I'm
sure there are some people down
there who are there for their own
benefit — they don't care about the
station."
Christie also said many of the al
bums may have been taken with the
intent to return them.
"A lot of people come down and
think that K/Sl is a lending library,
which just isn't true." Christie said.
Christie said she has sent letters out
to resident assistants and administra
tors in the Communication and Drama

Departments to encourage them to
return any albums that they find that
could belong to K/SU.
The station loses "a tew" albums
every quarter, but she said the prob
lem has become more noticeable in
the last few months. The station
recently installed a self-locking door
for the record library and it has col
lected keys to the door from former
stall members at the station.
Christie said, however, that
"security is a problem." She said that
because the station operates 24 hours
a day it is impossible to monitor the al
bums all the time. K./SU has about
I 20 stall members, she said.
"The station is kind of paralyzed,"
Christie said. "It's terrible. It's affect
ing the morale of the DJs and it's
reallv bad when somebody requests a
song and you don't have it."
Diane Ingram. k/.SlJ's music direc
tor. said there are approximately NOOO
albums in k/.SU's record library,
which makes it the second-largest in
the Bav Area.
