Economics Prof. James Rosse will
he offered the University's number
two position of vice-president and
provost hy University President
Donald Kennedy during the Board of
Trustees meeting today, administra
tors and faculty said yesterday.
Rosse refused to comment, hut
sources who asked not to he identified
said he has tentatively accepted the of
fer and that the Board will likely con
firm his appointment.
Rosse, a member of the faculty for
almost 20 years, has held numerous
administrative positions here, includ
ing associate dean of Humanities and
Sciences from 1978 to 1 982, chairman
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies from 1975 to 1977, chairman
of his department from 1974 to 1975
and head of the Reagan Library Fac
ulty Advisory Committee last year. He
is currently director of the Center for
Economic Policy Research (CEPR).
Faculty members interviewed last
night applauded the decision, saying
that Rosse will bring exceptional ad
ministrative and academic qualities to
the job.
"Jim is an exceptionally talented
scholar, teacher and institution
builder, and he will be missed by the
Center for Economic Policy Research
and the Economics Department," said
Michael Boskin, economics professor
and chairman of the CEPR steering
committee.
"The University showed an enor
mous amount of good judgement in
choosing him for provost," Boskin
said.
Rosse, who has regularly taught un
dergraduate and graduate level
courses and won an award for out
standing teaching, is a leading expert
on media and telecommunications
economics.
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, a
member of the search committee, said,
"He's had a splendid record both as
chairman of the department and as as
sociate dean. He is admired for his
fairness and abilities to tackle hard
problems. He has a very fine sense of
academic values, and he also is a very
fine administrator."

Robin Hamill, search committee
staff assistant and director of housing
and transportation, said Rosse sees
the University as an institution with
"no peers" which does not need to try
to emulate other top universities.
Rosse's Reagan library committee
recommendation last year that the
proposed Reagan center for public af
fairs be integrated into the Univer
sity's governance strongly influenced
the outcome of the controversy.
Rosse, 52, will assume the post to
be vacated by Albert Hastorf at the
end of August. Hastorf plans to
resume his academic duties in the Bi
ology and Human Biology Depart
ments.
Hastorf said last year that his job
was "interesting and fun," but that he
was eager to get back to teaching and
research. He said he considers the re
organization of undergraduate educa
tion as his most significant achieve
ment as provost.
The appointment marks the end of a
seven-month nationwide search in
which more than 350 candidates were
considered. Hamill said.
The 15-member committee
narrowed the applicant pool to five
candidates during the last four weeks,
Hamill said. The five names included
three outsiders and two insiders, ac
cording to Arrow.
Hamill said the committee
preferred an insider because that per
son would have less difficulty grasping
the University's complexity and
uniqueness.
Previous provosts have included
Kennedy and former University Presi
dent Richard Lyman.
