The president of the Overseas Private Invest
ment Corporation (OPIC) told 100 listeners in
Tresidder Union last night that "we have to eon
\inee people that every time you have an invest
ment overseas, you ha\e a positive impact in the
United States."
Craig Nalen explained that overseas investments
are necessary to relieve the economic "crisis" that
exists in Third World countries.
"Deht loads are at crushing levels." Nalen said.
"Commodity prices drop lower and lower. Nature
itselt has taken an ugh turn. There is .111 unbridled,
uncontained birth late."
Unfortunately, the solution to these problems is
not clear-cut. Nalen said. "At some point in the
development ot any countr\. concessional aid is
necessary." he said. However, when aid is no
longer solving the problem. OPIC provides kn
ottier solution.
OPIC is a government agency founded I 5 years
ago which encourages and facilitates American
private investment in Hind World countries. It is .1

self-sustaining corporation which provides insur
ance and finance programs for large and small
American businesses interested in starting an over
seas investment, he s;iid.
"The single largest deterrent to overseas invest
ments is the political risk factor — is this govern
ment stable? So we have a political risk irmirancc
program." Nalen explained. "We also provide
loans and loan guarantees."
The loans, which range from $50,000 to $10
million, are aimed at smaller, entrepreneurial busi
nesses. while the loan guarantees insure larger cor
porations from $50 to $100 million.
In addition. OPIC funds feasibility studies, in
vestment missions and the "opportunity bank." a
sort of computer dating system that "matches de
veloping nations with interested American firms."
he said.
Ol'IC functions under the precepts set by Presi
dent Reagan that the infusion of capital into over
seas nations must come from the private sector, the
American businessman. Nalen said. "Opportunity
exists lor profit. The Third World nations repre
sent the world's fastest growing markets — several

times larger than western Europe, and if we don't
invest, someone else will."
"The concept of OPIC is a universal one. It
exists in Japan, England, France and Germany, to
name a few. Despite dramatic increases in U.S.
foreign investments, we are still lagging far behind
these competitors," he said.
Nalen explained that this competition exists
among the host countries also. "Developing na
tions are competing with one another for foreign
markets. The U.S. is considered the leader in tech
nology marketing and knowledge," Nalen said.
"The da> of the Yankee imperialist no longer
exists."
However, there still exists a core of opposition
to OPIC and its ideals, despite "our highly success
ful track record." Nalen said. "Our biggest foes are
organized labor."
"They have to realize that when an American
businessman makes an investment, he is doing
more than infuse capital into the host country's
economy. He is creating more jobs, more products.
