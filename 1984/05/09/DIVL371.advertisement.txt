Dear Graduating Seniors:
By now you probably have received the 1984 Senior
Survey. The questionnaire is an essential part of our
continuing efforts to improve the quality of
undergraduate education at Stanford.
Please complete your questionnaire and return it to us
as soon as possible. Without your help, it will be
impossible for us to learn from your experiences.
With best wishes,
Donald Kennedy
President
Herant Katchadourian
Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education
P.S. If for any reason you need another copy of the survey or the
pre-professional questionnaire, please come by the Undergraduate
Research Office, Bldg. 1, Room 2R or call 497-0837.
