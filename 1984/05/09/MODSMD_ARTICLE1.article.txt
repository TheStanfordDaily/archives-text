# Soviets say they'll boycott Olympic Games
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The Soviet Union announced yesterday that it will not
participate in the 19K4 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles,
citing the United States' failure to provide adequate secur
ity tor the athletes and to adhere to the Olympic charter.
But countries officially have until June 2 to confirm par
ticipation or non-participation in the summer games.
"In these conditions the National Olympic Committee
of the U.S.S.R. is compelled to declare that the participa
tion of Soviet sportsmen in the Games of the 23rd Olym
piad in Los Angeles is impossible," said a statement issued
by the Soviet National Olympic Committee, distributed by
official Soviet news agency Tass and reported by the Asso
ciated Press.
"1 really don't give a damn whether they come or not,"
Stanford Track Coach Brooks Johnson said in response to
the announcement.
Johnson, who will coach the women's Olympic track
team this summer, said he has no hard feelings about the
Soviet decision but objects strongly to the justification.
"The Russians . . . arc underwriters of terrorism 111 the
world but they claim we're providing inadequate security,"
he said.
Johnson explained why he believes the Soviets elected
to stay home. "The Russians weren't going to do as well as
they wanted: The East Germans were going to beat the
hell out of them."
Stanford Women's Swimming Coach George Haines, who
will also be coaching in the 1984 Olympics, offered a dif
ferent explanation for the Soviet decision.
"The Soviets are afraid of defections," he said.
"Supposedly, if they came to Los Angeles, 25 percent of
their athletes would defect. That number would probably
be lower, but you can bet that if they defect we won't be
giving them back."

Haines said steroid detection, a pratfall for a Soviet
backstroker in the 1978 World Championships, was an
other concern that might have dissuaded the Soviets from
participating.
Coit Blacker, associate director of the Stanford Center
for International Security and Arms Control, said the
boycott was "in reprisal for the 1980 American boycott (of
the Moscow Olympics) and a way to express dissatisfaction
with (President) Reagan.
"It just further politicizes the Olympic Games<" he said.
Blacker and Johnson said they would not guess whether
East Germany will follow the Soviets' lead or come to Los
Angeles, but Haines said he would be surprised if the East
Germans, invariably one of the strongest swimming teams,
participated.
Coaches and athletes here discussed the effects the
boycott w ill have on American Olympic competitors.
"If I were (American runner) Mary Decker, I'd be
rejoicing," Johnson said. "No American is going to send
the medal he wins to Moscow because the Russians
weren't there. They'll take the damn medal and run.
That's what I'd do."
Senior PattiSue Plumer. Olympic hopeful track runner
and a member of Johnson's Stanford squad, expressed a
different attitude.
"I'd much rather have the Soviets there," she said.
"You always want to run against the best competition."
Plumer, who holds two national collegiate distance
records, said the absence of Soviet 3000-meter world
record holder Svyetlana Ulmasova and other top competi
tors will make winning a medal at Los Angeles somewhat
less of an accomplishment in her mind. She also said she
would probably have to run a personal best to qualify for
one of the three American spots in the 3000-meter run
