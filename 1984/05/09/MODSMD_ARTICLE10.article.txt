# Hart triumphs in Ohio and Indiana primaries
## 
### 
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart,
scoring his first victory over
Walter Mondale in a big nor
thern industrial state with a
strong union tradition, won the
Ohio Democratic presidential
primary yesterday.
But, despite Hart's other vic
tory, in Indiana, Mondale won
the most delegates on the day
with his victories in Maryland
and North Carolina.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson was a
strong third in Maryland and
North Carolina, distant third in
the Midwest.
"The Democrats of this na
tion are not prepared to have
this contest and this debate end
at this time," said Hart.
"Welcome to the fourth quar
ter."
Ohio, with 154 delegates at
stake, was the key for Hart.
Hart, who has not won a pri
mary since Connecticut on
March 27, badly needed the big
state victory to help keep his
campaign chances alive.
Mondale said that win or lose
in the Midwest, "we've taken an
important, significant step down
the road to the nomination" by
adding to his lead in convention
delegates.
The four contests carried a
prize of 368 delegates to the
Democratic National Conven
tion. Mondale was adding to his

commanding lead over his
rivals. With partial returns from
all four states, he led for 194
delegates, Hart for 143 and
Jackson for 29.
The networks said Hart's
cause was aided in Ohio and In
diana hy independent voters
and anti-union sentiment. The
NBC News poll in Indiana said
almost half the respondents
believe labor unions have

become too powerful — and
Hart beat Mondale by 2-1
among them.
NBC's poll said Jackson was
winning more than 75 percent
of the black vote in all four
states but continued to pull in
very few white votes.
Mondale began the day with
1252.05 convention delegates,
compared with 738.75 for Hart
and 237.2 for Jackson. Those
totals omitted Texas, where
Mondale may have won 100 or
more delegates on Saturday. It
takes 1967 delegates to win the
nomination.
Returns from 54 percent of
Indiana precincts gave Hart
1 52,415 votes, or 40 percent, to
148,350 or 38 percent for
Mondale. Jackson had 60,477
for 16 percent. NBC said polling
place interviews with voters in
dicated Hart was winning In
diana.
In North Carolina, with 46

percent of the vote counted,
Mondale had 155,343 votes for
38 percent. Hart had 131,792
for 33 percent. Jackson had
50,144 for 20 percent. NBC and
CBS projected a Mondale vic
tory .
In Maryland, with 50 percent
of the vote counted, Mondale
had 82,083 votes for 47 per
cent; Hart 51.649 for 30 per
cent, and Jackson had 32,400
votes lor 19 percent.
All three television networks
said the Ohio election would be
very close, but Oliver Henkel,
Hart's campaign manager said
the tight race "has to be treated
by Mr. Mondale as fundamen
tally a loss for him because he
had so much going for him."
"We think we will do very
well," Hart told reporters as he
greeted morning voters in
Cleveland. He vowed to stay in
the race no matter what the
outcome.
Jackson takes peace credit
Wilmington, N.C. —
Democratic presidential con
tender Jesse Jackson said yes
terday that if he, Walter
Mondale and Gary Hart are
able to iron out their differences
at a peace-making session
before the Democratic nominat
ing convention in July, the
credit should not go to Demo
cratic National Chairman
Charles Manatt.
Jackson said that he, not
Manatt, "took the initiative" for
a post-primary meeting of the
three contenders. Jackson said
yesterday that Hart and
Mondule were now in agree
ment that such a meeting should

take place "just after" the Cali
fornia primary June 5.
However, neither Hart nor
Mondale have confirmed that
they plan to attend such a
meeting.

Jackson also claimed it was
he, not Manatt, who "met with
Mondale and Hart about our
staffs getting to meet. All the
leadership initiative that has
come, has come from me —
from me — not from Manatt,"
Jackson said.
Jackson was reacting to an
announcement Friday by

Manatt that he would form a
"party unity task force" aimed
at getting the presidential con
tenders to meet and attempt to
settle their differences before
the convention.

This was the second time in
two weeks that Jackson has
been critical of Manatt. Follow
ing an April 23 meeting with the
party chairman in Washington,
Jackson said he was "insulted"
when Manatt opened up a press
conference by saying Jackson
had "given a pledge" not to
stage a walkout at the San Fran-

Cisco convei ion. Jackson said
he had never threatened to take
such an action in the first place.
Jackson also suggested that
possible mediators between
Hart, Mondale and himself.

such as former Democratic
Chairman Robert Strauss or
one-time Democratic presiden
tial nominee George Mc-
Govern, were important but
not essential to the process.
If there are to be mediators,
Jackson said, he wants them to
reflect a political balance.
Strauss, he noted, is a Mondale

supporter.
"There is a lot of posturing
about finding roles to play" in
mediating a pre-convention
agreement, Jackson said, adding
that while "we need some help
.. , we who are in the middle
(Hart, Mondale and Jackson)
must assume responsibility to
have a coherent approach to the
Democratic point of view."
Hart wins Colorado
Denver — Gary Hart won a
handy victory Monday night in
caucuses in his home state,
claiming at least 41 of the 43
delegates.
With 405 of 2598 caucuses
reporting, or 16 percent. Hart
had 2217 votes for N5 percent.
Mondale had 234 votes for L )
percent, and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson had 63 votes for 2 per
cent.
Sherrie Wolff, executive
director of the state Democratic
Party, said she believed turnout
was boosted by Democrats who
wanted to help Hart after his
disappointing loss in the Texas
caucuses on Saturday.
"1 think it will show that Gary
has overwhelming support in
the state. But you have to note
that Democrats are an indepen
dent lot, and you will see votes
for Jesse Jackson and Walter
Mondale — and uncommitted
votes coming out of those
precincts," she said.
"All of our figures indicate
that the turnout is going to be
about double what we had four
years ago," she said.

for 33 percent. Jackson had
50,144 for 20 percent. NBC and
CBS projected a Mondale vic
tory .
In Maryland, with 50 percent
of the vote counted, Mondale
had 82,083 votes for 47 per
cent; Hart 51.649 for 30 per
cent, and Jackson had 32,400
votes lor 19 percent.
All three television networks
said the Ohio election would be
very close, but Oliver Henkel,
Hart's campaign manager said
the tight race "has to be treated
by Mr. Mondale as fundamen
tally a loss for him because he
had so much going for him."
"We think we will do very
well," Hart told reporters as he
greeted morning voters in
Cleveland. He vowed to stay in
the race no matter what the
outcome.
Jackson takes peace credit
Wilmington, N.C. —
Democratic presidential con
tender Jesse Jackson said yes
terday that if he, Walter
Mondale and Gary Hart are
able to iron out their differences
at a peace-making session
before the Democratic nominat
ing convention in July, the
credit should not go to Demo
cratic National Chairman
Charles Manatt.
Jackson said that he, not
Manatt, "took the initiative" for
a post-primary meeting of the
three contenders. Jackson said
yesterday that Hart and
Mondule were now in agree
ment that such a meeting should

take place "just after" the Cali
fornia primary June 5.
However, neither Hart nor
Mondale have confirmed that
they plan to attend such a
meeting.

Jackson also claimed it was
he, not Manatt, who "met with
Mondale and Hart about our
staffs getting to meet. All the
leadership initiative that has
come, has come from me —
from me — not from Manatt,"
Jackson said.
Jackson was reacting to an
announcement Friday by

Manatt that he would form a
"party unity task force" aimed
at getting the presidential con
tenders to meet and attempt to
settle their differences before
the convention.

This was the second time in
two weeks that Jackson has
been critical of Manatt. Follow
ing an April 23 meeting with the
party chairman in Washington,
Jackson said he was "insulted"
when Manatt opened up a press
conference by saying Jackson
had "given a pledge" not to
stage a walkout at the San Fran-

Cisco convei ion. Jackson said
he had never threatened to take
such an action in the first place.
Jackson also suggested that
possible mediators between
Hart, Mondale and himself.

such as former Democratic
Chairman Robert Strauss or
one-time Democratic presiden
tial nominee George Mc-
Govern, were important but
not essential to the process.
If there are to be mediators,
Jackson said, he wants them to
reflect a political balance.
Strauss, he noted, is a Mondale

supporter.
"There is a lot of posturing
about finding roles to play" in
mediating a pre-convention
agreement, Jackson said, adding
that while "we need some help
.. , we who are in the middle
(Hart, Mondale and Jackson)
must assume responsibility to
have a coherent approach to the
Democratic point of view."
Hart wins Colorado
Denver — Gary Hart won a
handy victory Monday night in
caucuses in his home state,
claiming at least 41 of the 43
delegates.
With 405 of 2598 caucuses
reporting, or 16 percent. Hart
had 2217 votes for N5 percent.
Mondale had 234 votes for L )
percent, and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson had 63 votes for 2 per
cent.
Sherrie Wolff, executive
director of the state Democratic
Party, said she believed turnout
was boosted by Democrats who
wanted to help Hart after his
disappointing loss in the Texas
caucuses on Saturday.
"1 think it will show that Gary
has overwhelming support in
the state. But you have to note
that Democrats are an indepen
dent lot, and you will see votes
for Jesse Jackson and Walter
Mondale — and uncommitted
votes coming out of those
precincts," she said.
"All of our figures indicate
that the turnout is going to be
about double what we had four
years ago," she said.

Gary Hart is still alive after yesterday's two primary wins
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart,
scoring his first victory over
Walter Mondale in a big nor
thern industrial state with a
strong union tradition, won the
Ohio Democratic presidential
primary yesterday.
But, despite Hart's other vic
tory, in Indiana, Mondale won
the most delegates on the day
with his victories in Maryland
and North Carolina.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson was a
strong third in Maryland and
North Carolina, distant third in
the Midwest.
"The Democrats of this na
tion are not prepared to have
this contest and this debate end
at this time," said Hart.
"Welcome to the fourth quar
ter."
Ohio, with 154 delegates at
stake, was the key for Hart.
Hart, who has not won a pri
mary since Connecticut on
March 27, badly needed the big
state victory to help keep his
campaign chances alive.
Mondale said that win or lose
in the Midwest, "we've taken an
important, significant step down
the road to the nomination" by
adding to his lead in convention
delegates.
The four contests carried a
prize of 368 delegates to the
Democratic National Conven
tion. Mondale was adding to his

commanding lead over his
rivals. With partial returns from
all four states, he led for 194
delegates, Hart for 143 and
Jackson for 29.
The networks said Hart's
cause was aided in Ohio and In
diana hy independent voters
and anti-union sentiment. The
NBC News poll in Indiana said
almost half the respondents
believe labor unions have

become too powerful — and
Hart beat Mondale by 2-1
among them.
NBC's poll said Jackson was
winning more than 75 percent
of the black vote in all four
states but continued to pull in
very few white votes.
Mondale began the day with
1252.05 convention delegates,
compared with 738.75 for Hart
and 237.2 for Jackson. Those
totals omitted Texas, where
Mondale may have won 100 or
more delegates on Saturday. It
takes 1967 delegates to win the
nomination.
Returns from 54 percent of
Indiana precincts gave Hart
1 52,415 votes, or 40 percent, to
148,350 or 38 percent for
Mondale. Jackson had 60,477
for 16 percent. NBC said polling
place interviews with voters in
dicated Hart was winning In
diana.
In North Carolina, with 46

percent of the vote counted,
Mondale had 155,343 votes for
38 percent. Hart had 131,792
for 33 percent. Jackson had
50,144 for 20 percent. NBC and
CBS projected a Mondale vic
tory .
