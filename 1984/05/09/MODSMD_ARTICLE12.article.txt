## The 						Stanford Daily Fill frats through Draw 
### 
What a mess. The I niversity has shown im
pressive confusion and indecision when acting on
the Greek system at Stanford. It shouldn't be sup
posing a system which is self-selective and thus
antithetical to University policy. It shouldn't pro
vide housing for 13 fraternities — and no
>ororities.
Hopefully this uncomfortable situation will be
resolved soon, as the wheels have already started
turning. Twelve days ago the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies released a lengthy report on
controversial issues of student housing. One of its
recommendations said that "residential frater
nities and sororities should be filled by an unreg
ulated draw." C-US criticized the Greek houses
mainly for their rights of self-selection which have
no place in a university environment. The Task
Force on Fraternities and Sororities is scheduled
to offer its preliminary recommendation — either
"encouraging" oi "discouraging" the Greek sys
tem — after today's meeting.
Equal opportunity is the issue here At Stan
ford University, discrimination lor social criteria
b is been institutionalized. Fraternities and
s ro'ities choose their membership for no bettei
i ason than how an applicant seems to get along
with the rest of the group. This should not be
allowed, and the C-US report concurs: "Self
sclection appears to us antithetical to the goals of
the Residential Education Program and seems to
exist for social, not academic purposes."

A common reaction to this argument is that the
I niversity itself practices self-selection through
the admissions process. But in fact, students are
admitted on the basis of academic qualifications,
not social ones.
But the University is not completely innocent
itself It shows openly sexist tendencies by allow
ing residential fraternities but ignoring the re
quests of sororities for housing. We realize that
housing is limited on campus and that it would be
difficult to house all fraternities and sororities
that want housing, but the University now itself is
perpetuating a sexist and inequitable situation.
The solution is not to ignore the problem by
maintaining the present system. Instead, the Uni
versity should take the obvious move, given the
lack of housing on campus and given fraternities'
predilection to self-selection: remove residential
fraternities.
By placing the houses currently occupied by
fraternities into the Draw, the University would
be creating equal housing opportunities for all
students, a situation that does not exist now. Fur
thermore. Greek self-selection would no longer
be condoned by the University. Everyone wins
because everyone is treated equally and fairly.
Hopefully the University Task Force on Frater
nities and Sororities will strongly consider the C
US recommendation and recommend the same to
James Lyons. Perhaps then, the University will
take the proper action and end Greek discrimina
tion.
