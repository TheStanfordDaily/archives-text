"Legalize pot?" my ex-friend exclaimed. "You gotta be
nutso. buddy! Legalize that stuff and you'll have 30 million
drug-crazed godless lunatics embarking on an anarchistic
binge of crime and sin!"
1 applauded him. It was quite the eloquent statement,
spoken with a zeal that betrayed his partially lobotomized
brain. I might have been the only one at the dinner table
who noticed the foam at his mouth — just as if he had
stuck some Alka-seltzer under his tongue. The man was ill
and needed help. But, frankly, 1 thought he didn't quite
know the difference between his elbow and his buttocks.
Just as I was going to tell him that I thought he was a
diseased, mentally deficient social leech, endangering all
that uncivilized man stood for, I was interrupted by a char
acter that must have escaped from the "Freak Brothers"
comic strip. He hadn't washed for three days and had a
joint in his mouth.
"Legalize pot?" said this throwback to the Greenwich
Village era of hearing the answer blow in the haze. "Why,
sure, that way 1 can smoke out as much as 1 want, get really
stoned all the time and not have to conform to society's
rules or do anything useful with my life!"
I was besieged by freaks and misfits. Where did truth
lie? 1 felt like kicking the dopehead, telling him to get a
haircut, a shave and a job. What a feckless pile of human
folk. The very idea of someone shirking social responsibili
ties wrenched my bowels. Just as 1 was going to spit bile on
him, something dawned on me.
I was at a dinner table. No self-respecting person spits
bile on another person at the dinner table.
So 1 decided to wait until he went to get another Coke.
That way, I'd have him. Hah. That would show that yippie
frcak-o.
Just as 1 saw him get up and began readying my assault,
another thing dawned *)n me. Who was I to decide this
poor slob's life? Who was I to pass judgment, on him or
the Jerry Falwell imitator? Perhaps it would be prudent to
let objective, practical considerations decide the issue of
legalizing marijuana.
I think a good case can be made for the legalization of
marijuana, under certain circumstances. If legalization
means government regulation and sale through govern
ment outlets, then legalization makes perfect sense, given
the stipulation that use is legal only in the home and that
driving or any other similar type of activity under the influ
ence would be illegal. In other words, legalization should
take the form of allowing private use and possession, but
not the sale. Here are some good reasons for legalization:
Number one: Our society is supposedly based on the
primacy of the individual, that the preservation of individ
ual freedoms is most important. A la John Stuart Mill, a
person's lreedom ends where another person's freedom
begins. So where does the government get off proscribing
what ostensibly is a victimless crime? Why should it be ille
gal for an individual to do what he wants — get high — as
long as he does not hurt anybody? In my book, it is not
within the scope of governmental powers to dictate a
morality, especially when that decree runs counter to gov
ernment's higher purpose of exalting the individual and
protecting him from unnecessary enslavement.
Number two: The "problem" of marijuana is just too
pervasive for it to be prevented. A national household sur
vey on drug abuse reported that in 1982, 27.3 percent of
those between the ages of 12 and 17 have smoked dope, as

well as 64.3 percent of those aged IS to 25 and 23.4 per
cent of those 26 and over. Federal drug enforcement
agencies annually seize only 15-20 percent of the total
supply of marijuana and hashish in. and entering, the
country. Amid such widespread use, the laws prohibiting
and punishing dope smofting are widely ignored and
therefore meaningless. For a law to be a good law, it
should be enforceable and it should make a tangible im
pact on people's behavior. A quick look at the statistics
above shows that marijuana laws satisfy neither criterion.
Bad, unobserved laws merely inculcate in the public an
indifference to the general body of law. which includes the
many good and necessary laws that regulate social infrac
tions and make society civilized. Such widespread viola
tion of law, when unpunished and widely perceived as
such, erodes confidence or belief in the legal system and
teaches people apathy about society. Simply put, if so
many people are doing it. not to others' detriment but per
haps their own. why not go with the flow, uphold the indi
vidual's right to make decisions as regards his or her own
life and legalize marijuana?
Number three: There are quite a few practical benefits
involved in legalizing marijuana. Government revenues
would increase sharply as marijuana sales would be taxed
by the federal, state and local governments. Officials are
ignoring a veritable gold mine by ignoring the tax potential
of what is Hawaii's and California's No. I cash crop.
At the same time, the government would steal away a
major source of revenue and power from organized crime.
The profits involved with black market activity are tre
mendous — so fantastic, in fact, that growers and smug
glers are beginning to regard a few years in jail as just part
of the occupation Who do you think resists legalization
the most? You guessed it all the growers, dealers, smug
glers and organized crime leaders. They love the fact that
marijuana is illegal. Not only does it allow them to fetch a
higher price, but also they don't have to pay any taxes on
their tremendous incomes.
Moreover, since the government would control the sale
of drugs, it could also control the quality, assuring that the
dope is not dusted with PCP, LSD, paraquat, etc. People
are going to smoke dope. We might as well make it safe for
them and allow them to know what they're buying.
A common argument against legalization holds that pot
smoking leads to crime. This may or may not be true, ac
cording to statistics, but if so, one should be careful to dis
criminate the real reason for crime from the apparent one.
Do people commit crimes in order to support their habit,
or do they commit'crimes because of the drug's influence?
My assumption throughout has been that the former, not
the latter, is true. If I'm right, then legalization will actu
ally lower crime rates rather than raise them.
I can hear the anti-legalization battle hymn already: "If
legalization occurs, then society will be full of worthless in
dividuals stoned all day, acting as social detritus forcing
the responsible people to support them and their vile
habits." Maybe this is true. But maybe, if society places
enough confidence in the individual and in his decisions,
the individual will respond responsibly and realistically.
Maybe it's time for pragmatism to enter into our decision
making; maybe it's time for society to face up to reality.

tion of law, when unpunished and widely perceived as
such, erodes confidence or belief in the legal system and
teaches people apathy about society. Simply put, if so
many people are doing it. not to others' detriment but per
haps their own. why not go with the flow, uphold the indi
vidual's right to make decisions as regards his or her own
life and legalize marijuana?
Number three: There are quite a few practical benefits
involved in legalizing marijuana. Government revenues
would increase sharply as marijuana sales would be taxed
by the federal, state and local governments. Officials are
ignoring a veritable gold mine by ignoring the tax potential
of what is Hawaii's and California's No. I cash crop.
At the same time, the government would steal away a
major source of revenue and power from organized crime.
The profits involved with black market activity are tre
mendous — so fantastic, in fact, that growers and smug
glers are beginning to regard a few years in jail as just part
of the occupation Who do you think resists legalization
the most? You guessed it all the growers, dealers, smug
glers and organized crime leaders. They love the fact that
marijuana is illegal. Not only does it allow them to fetch a
higher price, but also they don't have to pay any taxes on
their tremendous incomes.
Moreover, since the government would control the sale
of drugs, it could also control the quality, assuring that the
dope is not dusted with PCP, LSD, paraquat, etc. People
are going to smoke dope. We might as well make it safe for
them and allow them to know what they're buying.
A common argument against legalization holds that pot
smoking leads to crime. This may or may not be true, ac
cording to statistics, but if so, one should be careful to dis
criminate the real reason for crime from the apparent one.
Do people commit crimes in order to support their habit,
or do they commit'crimes because of the drug's influence?
My assumption throughout has been that the former, not
the latter, is true. If I'm right, then legalization will actu
ally lower crime rates rather than raise them.
I can hear the anti-legalization battle hymn already: "If
legalization occurs, then society will be full of worthless in
dividuals stoned all day, acting as social detritus forcing
the responsible people to support them and their vile
habits." Maybe this is true. But maybe, if society places
enough confidence in the individual and in his decisions,
the individual will respond responsibly and realistically.
Maybe it's time for pragmatism to enter into our decision
making; maybe it's time for society to face up to reality.

"Legalize pot?" my ex-friend exclaimed. "You gotta be
nutso. buddy! Legalize that stuff and you'll have 30 million
drug-crazed godless lunatics embarking on an anarchistic
binge of crime and sin!"
1 applauded him. It was quite the eloquent statement,
spoken with a zeal that betrayed his partially lobotomized
brain. I might have been the only one at the dinner table
who noticed the foam at his mouth — just as if he had
stuck some Alka-seltzer under his tongue. The man was ill
and needed help. But, frankly, 1 thought he didn't quite
know the difference between his elbow and his buttocks.
Just as I was going to tell him that I thought he was a
diseased, mentally deficient social leech, endangering all
that uncivilized man stood for, I was interrupted by a char
acter that must have escaped from the "Freak Brothers"
comic strip. He hadn't washed for three days and had a
joint in his mouth.
"Legalize pot?" said this throwback to the Greenwich
Village era of hearing the answer blow in the haze. "Why,
sure, that way 1 can smoke out as much as 1 want, get really
stoned all the time and not have to conform to society's
rules or do anything useful with my life!"
I was besieged by freaks and misfits. Where did truth
lie? 1 felt like kicking the dopehead, telling him to get a
haircut, a shave and a job. What a feckless pile of human
folk. The very idea of someone shirking social responsibili
ties wrenched my bowels. Just as 1 was going to spit bile on
him, something dawned on me.
I was at a dinner table. No self-respecting person spits
bile on another person at the dinner table.
So 1 decided to wait until he went to get another Coke.
That way, I'd have him. Hah. That would show that yippie
frcak-o.
Just as 1 saw him get up and began readying my assault,
another thing dawned *)n me. Who was I to decide this
poor slob's life? Who was I to pass judgment, on him or
the Jerry Falwell imitator? Perhaps it would be prudent to
let objective, practical considerations decide the issue of
legalizing marijuana.
I think a good case can be made for the legalization of
marijuana, under certain circumstances. If legalization
means government regulation and sale through govern
ment outlets, then legalization makes perfect sense, given
the stipulation that use is legal only in the home and that
driving or any other similar type of activity under the influ
ence would be illegal. In other words, legalization should
take the form of allowing private use and possession, but
not the sale. Here are some good reasons for legalization:
Number one: Our society is supposedly based on the
primacy of the individual, that the preservation of individ
ual freedoms is most important. A la John Stuart Mill, a
person's lreedom ends where another person's freedom
begins. So where does the government get off proscribing
what ostensibly is a victimless crime? Why should it be ille
gal for an individual to do what he wants — get high — as
long as he does not hurt anybody? In my book, it is not
within the scope of governmental powers to dictate a
morality, especially when that decree runs counter to gov
ernment's higher purpose of exalting the individual and
protecting him from unnecessary enslavement.
Number two: The "problem" of marijuana is just too
pervasive for it to be prevented. A national household sur
vey on drug abuse reported that in 1982, 27.3 percent of
those between the ages of 12 and 17 have smoked dope, as

well as 64.3 percent of those aged IS to 25 and 23.4 per
cent of those 26 and over. Federal drug enforcement
agencies annually seize only 15-20 percent of the total
supply of marijuana and hashish in. and entering, the
country. Amid such widespread use, the laws prohibiting
and punishing dope smofting are widely ignored and
therefore meaningless. For a law to be a good law, it
should be enforceable and it should make a tangible im
pact on people's behavior. A quick look at the statistics
above shows that marijuana laws satisfy neither criterion.
Bad, unobserved laws merely inculcate in the public an
indifference to the general body of law. which includes the
many good and necessary laws that regulate social infrac
tions and make society civilized. Such widespread viola
tion of law, when unpunished and widely perceived as
such, erodes confidence or belief in the legal system and
teaches people apathy about society. Simply put, if so
