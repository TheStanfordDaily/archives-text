The desire to have fewer appli

"compare" with market rates and the
backdoor financing of luxury dorms
never should have had any influence
or the rent setting policy to graduate

trying to kid with its "grandfather

Let rhe University tell us that
tliey ve cut the ent to the marrow;
that il they cut any deeper, jobs will
be lost and si r\ ices cancelled: that
they have done everything humanly
possible to trim every tenth of a
percent. Then, the genetics will taste
better and Gemco will see me with a

The great majority of us have
shown the willintMies* to tighten belts
tothi' limit, just hv being here We
are thankful lor the opportunity to
work at what is as we know, a great
institution. We knew housing would

Frats and such
As 'hp middh of spring quarter

Dnvv with ti e task 'it deciding
whei'< and with whom to In . But, it
may - omc as, ,• urprise that there are
other groups, besides students, who

are occupied with questions concern
ing student housing.
With so much activity surrounding
and concerning housing, one might
gather that Stanford's housing system
is in dire need of reformation and
revitalization! However, when ex
amining the current housing system
and the opportunities this system
affords, one will find a great deal of
diversity.
Therefore, why don't we start
looking at how our current housing
system affords arrangements as
diverse as the students themselves,
rather than scrutinizing our housing
svstem for not providing some ill
defined housing ideal sought by many
of the groups concerned with student
housing.

I am writing after reading that the
University Task Force on Fraternities
and Sororities will soon be making
recommendations to Dean Lyons
"encouraging or discouraging frater
nal organizations at Stanford'"(Daily,
May 3).
A»ter living in coed housing at
Stanford for three years. I believe
thpt allowing men and women to live
together is fine of the best things that
has happened to colleges in the last
decade. Coed living has contributed

immensely to nonsexual friendship
and understanding between men and
women. In an age when many
feminists have become so hostile and
competitive toward men, we all
the friendliness that comes from men
and women living together in a low
key residential atmosphere.
The fraternities are extremely
detrimental to young adults trying to
gain a sane understanding of the
opposite sex. I was shocked to read
quotes from this year's Rush book. It
is often said that a mob brings out the
worst in human beings. A fraternity,
as a whole, behaves as none of its
members would dare alone. It is not
only barbaric, it is cowardly. Frater
nity men can be interesting, kind,
charming and funny, but all together
they are awful.
One of the arguments against
banning fraternity housing is that no
longer would there be a place where
that spirit of manly comradeship
would survive. What is wrong with
comradeship between men and wo
men? Isn't that the whole point, that
men and women can be buddies too?
One of the University's jobs is to
provide an atmosphere where young
adults can grow and mature intellec
tually and socially. By allowing frater
nities on campus the University is
neglecting this duty.
