# New provost Rosse readies for position
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
Every morning just before 10 as
students cram the area next to the
Clock Tower on their way to class,
the burly 52-year-old economics
professor in blue suspenders
quietly negotiates his way to class,
dodging bikers and wheeling his
portable overhead projector be
hind him.
Once in the classroom. James
Rosse. the 20-year University vet
eran selected yesterday to take on
Stanford's No. 2 position of vice
president, and provost 111 Septem
ber. begins setting up his projector.
"I have become addicted to
using overhead transparencies in
lecture." Rosse says."It disciplines
me in teaching."
Rosse. a leading expert in media
economics, has also become ad
dicted to his commitment to Stan
ford and says he lias high expecta
tions for the University.
■ We're at a point in our history
where we should think about what
Stanford should do for education."

he said yesterday during an inter
view in his office. "The University
has grown at such a rate that it has
very well passed the point where
we need to model ourselves after
other universities. We're on our
way to being past them.
• "I don't think that we have to be
bashful about the fact that we have
our own identity and our own way
to make in the world." he said.
"When you look at the depart
ments collectively there's really no
other school that combines the
strengths we have in engineering
with the strengths in the social
sciences and the professional
schools." Rosse said.
"But that doesn't mean there
isn't room fot improvement." he

he hopes to evaluate carefully.
These include faculty salaries,
housing costs, faculty relationships

overseas program.
Lagging faculty salaries and
rising housing costs have hurt
the University's ability to draw
top-notch faculty, he said.
"We've had a difficult time in
recent years in recruiting the
best people from other institu
tions because we're a high cost
area," he said. "If we can't con
tinue to recruit the best faculty
every year we're in serious trou
ble."
The problem is particularly
bad in computer science and en
gineering where the University
must compete with high salaries
available in private industry.
"Salaries have lagged behind
the federal level of wage in
creases in other industries" he
said. "Many of the other people
in the Valley have higher
salaries."
Rosse said University pro
grams such as the overseas
centers, interdisplinary majors,
graduation requirements and
course curricula need to be re
evaluated frequently to make
sure there are no problems.
"Once in awhile you have to
step back and consider what the

changes do to the whole pro
gram," he said.
A newspaper editor's son,
Rosse was born in Sidney, Neb.,
and worked on several Midwes
tern newspapers before enroll
ing in the University of Min
nesota, where he earned a Ph.D.
His office reflects what col
leagues call his no-nonsense
style. The desk is neat, almost
bare, with an empty paper tray
in the corner.
Faculty members and admi
nistrators also say Rosse has an
exceptional ability to resolve
conflicts by listening to people's
opinions and helping them
reach an agreement.
Communications Prof. Elie
Abel, a member of the Reagan
library committee which Rosse
chaired, said, "It's really a testa
ment to his ability that we
managed to get a report out at
all.
"Working with him, I
couldn't help but be impressed
by his fair-mindedness and the
enormous lengths he went to to
make sure that every shade of
opinion was heard," Abel said.
"He's soft-spoken but he has
strong opinions that come from
being well-informed. He's
nobody's pushover or patsy," he
said.

Current Provost Albert Has
torf said that as associate chair
of the Economics Department
in the early 19705, Rosse helped
to rebuild the deparment when
morale was low.
Rosse, the father of three
children, said he was hesitant to
accept the job offered privately
two weeks ago because it would
take so much time from his per
sonal life.
"We have a comfortable
private life of our own, some of
which is going to go, and that's a
high price. That's something I
am still concerned about," he
said.
Rosse said he was also
hesitant to accept the post be
cause it will be such a dramatic
change from his academic
duties.
"It took me a while to adjust
to the idea of changing careers,
so I would just as soon not been
asked, but having been asked. I
have given it the effort of think
ing about taking a new career,
and I'm anxious to get on with it
now," he said.
"It's an important position
and I'm very honored to have a
chance to fill it. I hope five years
from now I can point to some
accomplishments."

am still concerned about," he
said.
Rosse said he was also
hesitant to accept the post be
cause it will be such a dramatic
change from his academic
duties.
"It took me a while to adjust
to the idea of changing careers,
so I would just as soon not been
asked, but having been asked. I
have given it the effort of think
ing about taking a new career,
and I'm anxious to get on with it
now," he said.
"It's an important position
and I'm very honored to have a
chance to fill it. I hope five years
from now I can point to some
accomplishments."
Every morning just before 10 as
students cram the area next to the
Clock Tower on their way to class,
the burly 52-year-old economics
professor in blue suspenders
quietly negotiates his way to class,
dodging bikers and wheeling his
portable overhead projector be
hind him.
Once in the classroom. James
Rosse. the 20-year University vet
eran selected yesterday to take on
Stanford's No. 2 position of vice
president, and provost 111 Septem
ber. begins setting up his projector.
"I have become addicted to
using overhead transparencies in
lecture." Rosse says."It disciplines
me in teaching."
Rosse. a leading expert in media
economics, has also become ad
dicted to his commitment to Stan
ford and says he lias high expecta
tions for the University.
■ We're at a point in our history
where we should think about what
Stanford should do for education."

he said yesterday during an inter
view in his office. "The University
has grown at such a rate that it has
very well passed the point where
we need to model ourselves after
other universities. We're on our
way to being past them.
• "I don't think that we have to be
bashful about the fact that we have
our own identity and our own way
to make in the world." he said.
"When you look at the depart
ments collectively there's really no
other school that combines the
strengths we have in engineering
with the strengths in the social
sciences and the professional
schools." Rosse said.
"But that doesn't mean there
isn't room fot improvement." he
said.
lie listed a number of concerns
he hopes to evaluate carefully.
These include faculty salaries,
housing costs, faculty relationships
with the outside community, un
dergradate course requirements,
interdisciplinary programs and the

overseas program.
Lagging faculty salaries and
rising housing costs have hurt
the University's ability to draw
top-notch faculty, he said.
"We've had a difficult time in
recent years in recruiting the
best people from other institu
tions because we're a high cost
area," he said. "If we can't con
tinue to recruit the best faculty
every year we're in serious trou
ble."
The problem is particularly
bad in computer science and en
gineering where the University
must compete with high salaries
available in private industry.
"Salaries have lagged behind
the federal level of wage in
creases in other industries" he
said. "Many of the other people
in the Valley have higher
salaries."
Rosse said University pro
grams such as the overseas
centers, interdisplinary majors,
graduation requirements and
course curricula need to be re
evaluated frequently to make
sure there are no problems.
"Once in awhile you have to
step back and consider what the

changes do to the whole pro
gram," he said.
A newspaper editor's son,
Rosse was born in Sidney, Neb.,
and worked on several Midwes
tern newspapers before enroll
ing in the University of Min
nesota, where he earned a Ph.D.
His office reflects what col
leagues call his no-nonsense
style. The desk is neat, almost
bare, with an empty paper tray
in the corner.
Faculty members and admi
nistrators also say Rosse has an
exceptional ability to resolve
conflicts by listening to people's
opinions and helping them
reach an agreement.
Communications Prof. Elie
Abel, a member of the Reagan
library committee which Rosse
chaired, said, "It's really a testa
ment to his ability that we
managed to get a report out at
all.
"Working with him, I
couldn't help but be impressed
by his fair-mindedness and the
enormous lengths he went to to
make sure that every shade of
opinion was heard," Abel said.
"He's soft-spoken but he has
strong opinions that come from
being well-informed. He's
nobody's pushover or patsy," he
said.

Current Provost Albert Has
torf said that as associate chair
of the Economics Department
in the early 19705, Rosse helped
to rebuild the deparment when
morale was low.
Rosse, the father of three
children, said he was hesitant to
accept the job offered privately
two weeks ago because it would
take so much time from his per
sonal life.
"We have a comfortable
private life of our own, some of
which is going to go, and that's a
high price. That's something I
am still concerned about," he
said.
Rosse said he was also
hesitant to accept the post be
cause it will be such a dramatic
change from his academic
duties.
"It took me a while to adjust
