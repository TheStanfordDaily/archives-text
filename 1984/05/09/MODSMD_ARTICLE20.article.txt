The '60s revisited
Three Montana State University students
were arrested while attending an Easter
peace rally at Malstrom Air Force Base in
Great Falls. The university's newspaper. The
Exponent, reported that the students believe
they are political prisoners.
"We are political prisoners. We were ar
rested for expressing our beliefs in a peace
ful manner." said one member of Students
for Peace. "In a very non-threatening way,
we crossed the line by a few yards and
started to sing."
A total of 300 protesters attended the fifth
annual rally, and this year 21 individuals
were arrested for criminal trespass on
federal property. Of the 21 arrested, 18
pleaded guilty or no contest to the charges.
Each person was sentenced to 30 days in jail,
with 25 days suspended, and a $100 fine.
Those arrested over the last five years had

received a $25 fine and no jail time.
One student said he went to Malstrom to
express his displeasure with the nuclear
weapons buildup and the Minuteman missile
silos on the base.
According to another student who was
also arrested, the white line the protesters
crossed is only enforced when there are
peace rallies in front of the base.
"Newspaper photographers and TV
cameramen freely crossed the line during the
protest without being arrested," he added.
The people who decided to cross held
hands, formed a ring and walked a few
yards. Almost immediately after the group
sat down, they were arrested. During the
five hours that the group was detained in a
storage hanger they sang songs and ac
quainted themselves with one another.
"The people who were involved with this
for the five hours we were detained were or
dinary citizens concerned about the future,"

stated one protester."They came from dif
ferent walks ol lite. Some were profes
sionals. some physicians, anil mothers, but
all of them were there to forward peace."

While we may be out by the lake or on the
dorm sundeck. students at the I'niversity of
Oregon have to find a way to tan while it
rains. The Oregon Daily Emerald recently
reported that artificial tanning is now safer
than ever, and that there are nearly a do/en
salons in the area with ultraviolet tanning
facilities.
According to Linda Davisson of The Sun
shine Station, clients begin their tanning
process by getting a "base tan." which takes

an average of seven 25-minute sessions
taken sequentially. Depending on skin type,
some people may need as few as two or three
sessions; others may need as many as 10 to
achieve their base tan.
The tanning experience itself is totally
relaxing and has its own therapeutic value. A
lot of students come in right after exams,
she added.
For those concerned about skin damage,
Davisson said the method is far less danger
ous than natural outdoor tanning because
the environment is controlled.

One niii\ wonder whs there is such a luss
about Stantord s alcohol policy after dis

due to a tloor keg party.
While Tim Sehleuter. an RA at McLaugh
lin Hall, was out. the residents of his floor
smuggled a keg ol beer into his room to
throw a part) on his behalf. According to the
Spartan Daily, when Sehleuter returned that
night, he said he decided to let the party con
tinue "since the guys on the floor have been
good all year."
By 1:20 a.m.. the resident director asked
Sehleuter to keep the noise down, but even
tually because of the noise the other RAs in
Mcl aughlin decided to end the party and
write Sehleuter and the entire floor up'
Sehleuter. acknowledging that this was "a
flagrant violation ol the alcohol policy." and
realizing that he would be asked to step
down from his position, decided to resign
from the job instead.
Jan Arminio, associate director of
Housing and Residence l ife, only stated
that Sehleuter did something which the de
partment was disappointed in.
Sehleuter is now liv ing off-campus.

While we may be out by the lake or on the
dorm sundeck. students at the I'niversity of
Oregon have to find a way to tan while it
rains. The Oregon Daily Emerald recently
reported that artificial tanning is now safer
than ever, and that there are nearly a do/en
salons in the area with ultraviolet tanning
facilities.
According to Linda Davisson of The Sun
shine Station, clients begin their tanning
process by getting a "base tan." which takes

an average of seven 25-minute sessions
taken sequentially. Depending on skin type,
some people may need as few as two or three
sessions; others may need as many as 10 to
achieve their base tan.
The tanning experience itself is totally
relaxing and has its own therapeutic value. A
lot of students come in right after exams,
she added.
For those concerned about skin damage,
Davisson said the method is far less danger
ous than natural outdoor tanning because
the environment is controlled.

The '60s revisited
Three Montana State University students
were arrested while attending an Easter
peace rally at Malstrom Air Force Base in
Great Falls. The university's newspaper. The
Exponent, reported that the students believe
they are political prisoners.
"We are political prisoners. We were ar
rested for expressing our beliefs in a peace
ful manner." said one member of Students
for Peace. "In a very non-threatening way,
we crossed the line by a few yards and
started to sing."
A total of 300 protesters attended the fifth
annual rally, and this year 21 individuals
were arrested for criminal trespass on
federal property. Of the 21 arrested, 18
pleaded guilty or no contest to the charges.
Each person was sentenced to 30 days in jail,
with 25 days suspended, and a $100 fine.
Those arrested over the last five years had

received a $25 fine and no jail time.
One student said he went to Malstrom to
express his displeasure with the nuclear
weapons buildup and the Minuteman missile
silos on the base.
According to another student who was
also arrested, the white line the protesters
crossed is only enforced when there are
peace rallies in front of the base.
"Newspaper photographers and TV
cameramen freely crossed the line during the
protest without being arrested," he added.
The people who decided to cross held
hands, formed a ring and walked a few
yards. Almost immediately after the group
sat down, they were arrested. During the
five hours that the group was detained in a
storage hanger they sang songs and ac
quainted themselves with one another.
"The people who were involved with this
for the five hours we were detained were or
dinary citizens concerned about the future,"

stated one protester."They came from dif
ferent walks ol lite. Some were profes
sionals. some physicians, anil mothers, but
all of them were there to forward peace."
