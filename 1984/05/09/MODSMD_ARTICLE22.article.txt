### ROB / ZWEIG Staff Sportswriter 
Somcbodv forgot to tell the Santa Clara
Broncos that the Nth-ranked Stantord baseball
team may he headed to its fourth consecutive ap
pearance in the NCAA Regionals in a leu weeks.
Yesterday at Sunken Diamond, the Broncos built
.1 'i-l lead over Stantord then withstood a late
comeback to win 7-6 and capture their ninth vic
tory 111 their last Id starts.
I he non-league defeat dropped the Cardinal to
34-23-1 011 the season. The loss did little to help
the C aid's cause: if DSC rallies to tie or pass Stan
tord in the race for second place in the Pacific-10
Southern Division, the NCAA hid will likely go
to the Trojans.
Santa Clara, meanwhile, raised its record to 2N
-2s and salvaged a season series split ot four games
vvith the Cardinal.
"I think we got whipped, that's all." remarked a
visibly perturbed Mark Marquess, the Stanford
head coach. "I didn't think it was a very good per
formance 111 any area. They just played better
than we did."
Santa Clara made the pitching mound look like
.1 mcrTv-go-round, tagging I I hits off six different
Cardinal pitchers. Least impressed with the high-
I'lying Card was catcher Mike MacFarlane. who
knocked in five of the Bronco runs on a three-for
livc performance from the plate, including a home
run and two double.
His two-run blast in the fourth off freshman Al
Osuna negated an opening-inning solo shot by the
Card's Darryl Stephens, his seventh of the cam
paign. MacFarlane then added a run-scoringtwo
bagger in a two-run sixth and collected his final

two RBIs in the seventh inning when he lotted a
shallow fly ball that dropped between three Stan
tord fielders tor a double.
Led by a pair ot hot bats, the Card made a game
of it. exploding for five runs in the home half of
the seventh to tie the contest at 6-6. Stanford
loaded the bases against Bronco reliever Led
Rossi and Cardinal catcher John Ramos, three for
four on the day. ripped Rossi's replacement.
Chuck Martin, for a two-run single into the left
field corner.
After a walk loaded the bases again. Walt Har
ris. Stanford's hottest hitter, stepped up with a
chance to live up to some recent fame. Against
Arizona State. Harris went seven for 13 with six
RBIs, of which two were game-winners, earning
him co-Pac 10 Player of the Week honors with
ASD's Oddihe McDowell. Harris promptly
responded by rapping a line single to right to score
two more runs.
But Santa Clara's Martin survived and even got
his sixth win against seven losses when Jeff
Melrose's eighth-inning sacrifice fly scored Mark
Cummings from third with the winning run. Diet/,
now 2-1. absorbed the defeat.
Stanford will next face DC-Berkeley in a three
game. season-ending battle between the "Six-
Pac's" two hottest clubs. The Card will be fighting
lor one of 1 I at-large bids awarded in the 36-tcam
NCAA tournament that culminates with the Col
lege World Series in Omaha, Neb.
