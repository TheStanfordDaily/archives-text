# Carol Cady throws and puts her way to summer Olympic Games
## 
### TRASk LEONARD 
Size is not everything. At
least that is what Carol Cady
would like to prove in this
summer's Olympic Games in
Los Angeles.
At only 5-foot-6 and 175
pounds, Cady is out
measured by several inches
and by almost 70 pounds by

many of her competitors in
the discus and the shot put.
Yet what she lacks in size she
makes up for in technique.
"Throwing the discus, es
pecially, requires a great deal
of practice in order to
achieve the necessary form,"
said Cady. "I'd go so far as to
say that the event is at least
NO percent technique and 20
percent strength.
"However, you have to
have a certain amount of
strength in order to utilize
the motion that you've

worked on for so many
hours." continued Cady.
Cady's hard work earned
her a tilth-place finish at the
recent major meet held at
Mt. San Antonio College in
Southern California. Her
toss of 204-fect-10 inches in
the discus was the second
best by an American at the
event, behind only Leslie
Deniz of Arizona State, who
reached a mark of 2 13.
Deniz is ranked No. I in
the nation going into the
Olympic trials, which will
start June lb in Los Angeles.
Deniz, who weighs in at 255
pounds, redshirted this year
in order to prepare for the
Games.
"She definitely has a size
advantage," said Cady. "But
that's not all there is in
throwing the discus."
Cady, who has been
throwing the discus and the
shot seriously since l()th
grade, received her best
preparation from John
Powell, whom she met at a
clinic in New Mexico before
she came here. Powell, who

at that time was not affiliated
with Stanford, convinced her
to come to Palo Alto.
"John was almost totally
responsible for my success,"
explained C'ady. "Not only
did he help me increase my
marks by about 30 feet, but
he provided psychological
support as well."
In order to refine other
parts of her performance,
C'ady works out several
hours a day in the weight
room and on the track. Slit
also does an extensive jump
ing program to improve her
throws.
The physical aspect of
track and field is not the only
area in which Cady wishes to
devote her energy. She
regards the mental side ol
putting the shot and throw
ing the discus to be just as
important.
"Mental preparation is ab
solutely essential," remarked
Cady. "I try to work on vis
ual imagery as an aid to my
confidence building. If you
don't have confidence, then
there's not a thing you can do

.with whatever technique of
strength that you have."
Although C'ady concen
trates on the discus, she also
will attempt to make the
team as a shot-putter. She
also throws the hammer, but
will not try out in that event.
"Carol has done an
amazingly good job in all
three areas, in particularly the
discus, and I expect her to
continue, said Johnson.
Vet track and field is not
the only thing in C'ady's life.
She also happens to be a me
chanical engineering major
win) is looking forward to a
career in biomedical engi
neering.
"When I have to stop my
training for good, I know
that I'll be able to explore
another field which I enjoy a
lot," said ( ady.
Regarding her chances at
I.os Angeles, she is very real
istic.
"I believe a person can
direct his or her own fate.
Stanford has given me the
tools, and it's up to me to
utilize them."
