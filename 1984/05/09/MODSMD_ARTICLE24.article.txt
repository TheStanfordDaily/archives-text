## 'The Bounty' is a tremendously stirring picture 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The pictorial splendor of the
credits sequence that begins The
Bounty — the ocean and the
Tahitian Islands glimpsed at
sunrise and at dusk — and Van
gelis' pumped-up music behind
them (scored in the style that's
his specialty: canned inspira
tional), prepare us for a stirring
sea epic. But New Zealand
filmmaker Roger Donaldson,
who directed the remarkable
domestic drama Smash Palace,
and screenwriter Robert Bolt,
who is most famous for writing
A Man for All Seasons, have
something quite different in
mind.
They've even started from an
unusual source — Richard
Hough's book "Captain Bligh
and Mr. Christian," an attempt
to reconstruct the true story of
the mutiny aboard the cargo
ship "Bounty" in the late 1 Sth
century, rather than the romantic
adventure novels by Nordhoff
and Hall that spawned both the
highly successful 1935 film with
Clark Gable and Charles
Laughton and the 1962 fiasco
with Marlon Brando and Trevor
I loward.
This Bounty commences in a

military courtroom, where Ad
miral Mood (Laurence Olivier),
Captain Cireetham (Edward
l ow) and other naval officers
try lieutenant Bligh (Anthony
Hopkins) on the charge of
losing his ship on a voyage in
tended to transport breadfruit
from Tahiti to the British colony
at Jamaica. And with
Donaldson and Bolt shifting
back and forth between the
courtroom and the flashbacks to
the "Bounty," introduced by
Bligh's testimony, it's hard to
get our hearings. In this version
of the material, Bligh and

Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson)
are good friends; Christian signs
up as master's mate aboard
Bligh's ship at the lieutenant's
request; but the brief expository
passages showing them together
before the "Bounty" sails are
pallid and uninformative — per
functory — and though the
filmmakers delineate the ship's
hierarchy and the individual
characters on every rung in the
first shipboard scenes, and
maintain narrative clarity
throughout, no tension develops
to bind the "Bounty's" troubles
at sea into one forward motion.
The men survive a fearsome
gale (in a skillfully directed and
photographed sequence that
Arthur Ibbetson seems to have
shot through cheesecloth), but
Bligh tells the court that they
spent a month battling bad wea
ther in an attempt to round
Cape Horn before he decided
on a less perilous route, and we
don't get a sense of the
cumulative effect of all that
physical hardship on the crew.
We learn of a sailor's death at
the hands of the ship's drunken,
incompetent physician (Mal
colm Terris), but since we
never see the doctor in action,

the incident makes no impres
sion on us. And when Bligh
replaces his first officer. Fryer
(Daniel Day-Lewis), with
Christian, after Fryer's
vociferous criticism of the com
mander during a storm, we
haven't had the opportunity to
observe enough of Fryer's be
havior to know if Bligh's accusa
tions of cowardice and inef
ficiency are justified, if Bligh is
lashing out against a subor
dinate officer who failed to back
him up, or if (as Hood and
Greetham suggest) it was simply
a case of favoritism — Bligh

elevating his best friend to a po
sition just below his own.
Bolt originally planned two
screenplays (with David Lean
directing) to chronicle the tale
of the "Bounty's" journey to
Tahiti, the mutiny under Chris
tian following the crew's forced
separation from the delights of
the island and the separate
fates of Bligh and Christian.
And Bolt's and Donaldson's
need to compress such an
incident-filled history into one
film (running slightly over two
hours) probably explains the
frustratingly episodic quality of
the first half, as well as those ir
ritating courtroom scenes,
which have no other apparent
purpose than to help keep the
dense narrative material
straight.
The other reason for our con
fusion in the first half of The
Bounty is Mel Gibson's portayal
of Fletcher Christian. Whereas
Anthony Hopkins gives a com
manding, complex performance
from the outset, Gibson is
surprisingly slight — he barely
seems to be in the picture at all,
and when Bligh tells the court of
Christian's courage, we don't
know what he's talking about.
But The Bounty, which in the
final analysis is a very good and
very subtle movie, hinges on
what Gibson, Bolt and
Donaldson do with Christian —
on how bewilderingly un
impressive he seems until the
ship reaches the island and how
his character reveals itself from
that point on.
Christian, more than any of
the other men, is bewitched by
the island; he falls in love with
Mauatua (Tevaie Vernette), the
daughter of King Tynah (Wi
Kuki Kaa), impregnates her,
receives her father's blessing on
their union, and becomes ever

more remote from his life as
first ship's officer — and from
Bligh. When he stops showing
up on board for dinner, Bligh
sends the bitterly resentful
Fryer to fetch him, and Fryer
finds him lying on his stomach in
a hut, holding Mauatua's hand
while a native tattoo artist
covers his back and buttocks
with totemic markings. As Gib
son plays this scene. Christian
seems drugged, feverish, barely
capable of raising his head to ac
knowledge Fryer's message; you
feel that his will has been
sapped — that he has become
more islander than Briton.
Using that scene as a dramatic
lever, the filmmakers build two
fascinating psychological
portraits, one of a man driven
by thwarted pride and ambition
to conduct himself in an unrea
sonable, inhumane fashion, and
one of an immature younger
man who rebels against an older
friend standing in loco parentis.

For the crux of the conflict be
tween these two is that Christian
is not the man Bligh thought
him, and the discrepancy be
tween Bligh's idealized image of
him — informed at least in part
by a homoerotic interest — and
Christian's real nature, causes
Bligh so much mental anguish
that he begins to behave cruelly
toward his friend and toward
the sailors who respect and
admire Christian, becoming a
hard taskmaster just at the point
when they require leniency and
understanding.
Consequently, Christian
retreats into a teenage pouti
ness, denying Bligh his
friendship, which of course ex
acerbates Bligh's feelings of in
adequacy and provokes even
more of a backlash from him.
Fearing the loss of his authority,
Bligh reintroduces his old plan
of rounding Cape Horn (which
would realize his ambition to
circumnavigate the globe), and
the men, turning openly hostile,
persuade Christian to spearhead
a mutiny. Ironically, then,
Bligh's disappointment in Chris
tian drives the younger man to
an act of courage he would
never have believed himself
master of — though it is the
filmmakers' (and Gibson's) spe
cial triumph that they show us
how Christian's audacity ter
rifies him, and how his revolt
against his surrogate father
divides him utterly, sending him
into turmoil. The men's worst
impulses surface when they find
themselves equipped with arms
and power, and Christian must
restrain them from manhandling
the commander whose
friendship he so lately prized. "I
am in hell, sir!" he screams as he
hears Bligh's rebukes. It's an ex
traordinary scene, overwrought

as it is — psychologically accu
rate, in fact, because it is so
overwrought.
If you have the patience to
ride out the first hour of the film
without losing hope, your trust
pays off, because the second
half wouldn't work without the
suggestions Donaldson and Bolt
plant in the first half. Besides,
problematic as they are, the
shipboard scenes possess their
own virtues — in the careful
detailing of the narrative, which
never fails to hold our interest,
in Donaldson's intelligent
craftsmanship,and especially in
Anthony Hopkins' acting and
the acting of Philip Martin
Brown in the much smaller role
of Adams, who pilots the ship.

(Later in the picture, when
Christian fears the crew will rise
up a second time gainst him, he
writes in the log that he trusts
only Adams, and we recognize
that Brown with simplicity and
understatement hut almost no
lines, has already convinced us
of Adams' root decency.)
The Bounty really is the scenes
following the ship's arrival at
Tahiti, though. In his last
picture, Smash Palace, Roger
Donaldson displayed a gift for
handling moments of emotional
crisis — moments that capture
men in particular almost past
the furthest point their en
durance will stretch — with ten
derness and variety; in The
Bounty he matches Mel Gib
son's finely played passion
during the mutiny with a Inter
scene in which the old king must
say farewell to his daughter,
who has chosen to sail with
Christian to unknown islands
(where he hopes to evade the
long arm of British naval law).
The Bounty probably doesn't
have a chance at the box office

because it's not the sweeping
historical epic audiences will ex
pect, and then, you have to stick
with it. And how will Mel Gib
son fans, who loved him as Mad
Max, respond to him as an un
heroic Fletcher Christian?
Audiences didn't flock to see
him in The Year of Living Dan
gerously (glamorous a** it was),
in which the character he played
demonstrated considerably les>
moral strength than Sigourney
Weaver's or Linda Hunt's,
though perhaps other consider
ations kept them away, too. (A
pity; it was a marvelous
picture.) Yet I've never seen a
better piece of acting from Gib
son than he gives in The Bounty,
and the movie is tremendously

stirring, as it turns out — only
not in ways one might have im
agined.
When Christian and his
mutineers set out in quest of a
safe haven. Donaldson moves
back and forth between the
perils of his voyage and those of
Bligh's on an open boat with
those of the crew who have
remained loyal to him: under
the new pressures of a journey
they all assume will kill them,
Bligh rediscovers both his com
mand and his humanity, while
Christian is left shattered by the
force of his own actions — his
decision to choose mutiny over
his filial love for Bligh. It's a
potent double irony. When
Christian and his followers
make shore at Piteuirn Island
and incincerate the "Bounty,"
Donaldson travels from one
face to the next as these outlaws
watch their last ties to their pre
vious lives vanish — and we can
read each one's thoughts. You
may be amazed at how long that
moments lingers in your mind.

picture, Smash Palace, Roger
Donaldson displayed a gift for

derness and variety; in The
Bounty he matches Mel Gib

during the mutiny with a Inter
scene in which the old king must
say farewell to his daughter,
who has chosen to sail with
Christian to unknown islands
(where he hopes to evade the
long arm of British naval law).
The Bounty probably doesn't
have a chance at the box office

because it's not the sweeping
historical epic audiences will ex

with it. And how will Mel Gib

Max, respond to him as an un
heroic Fletcher Christian?
Audiences didn't flock to see

in which the character he played
demonstrated considerably les>
moral strength than Sigourney

though perhaps other consider

pity; it was a marvelous
picture.) Yet I've never seen a

stirring, as it turns out — only

The pictorial splendor of the
credits sequence that begins The
Bounty — the ocean and the
Tahitian Islands glimpsed at
sunrise and at dusk — and Van
gelis' pumped-up music behind
them (scored in the style that's
his specialty: canned inspira
tional), prepare us for a stirring
sea epic. But New Zealand
filmmaker Roger Donaldson,
who directed the remarkable
domestic drama Smash Palace,
and screenwriter Robert Bolt,
who is most famous for writing
A Man for All Seasons, have
something quite different in
mind.
They've even started from an
unusual source — Richard
Hough's book "Captain Bligh
and Mr. Christian," an attempt
to reconstruct the true story of
the mutiny aboard the cargo
ship "Bounty" in the late 1 Sth
century, rather than the romantic
adventure novels by Nordhoff
and Hall that spawned both the
highly successful 1935 film with
Clark Gable and Charles
Laughton and the 1962 fiasco
with Marlon Brando and Trevor
I loward.
This Bounty commences in a

military courtroom, where Ad
miral Mood (Laurence Olivier),
Captain Cireetham (Edward
l ow) and other naval officers
try lieutenant Bligh (Anthony
Hopkins) on the charge of
losing his ship on a voyage in
tended to transport breadfruit
from Tahiti to the British colony
at Jamaica. And with
Donaldson and Bolt shifting
back and forth between the
courtroom and the flashbacks to
the "Bounty," introduced by
Bligh's testimony, it's hard to
get our hearings. In this version
of the material, Bligh and

Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson)
are good friends; Christian signs
up as master's mate aboard
Bligh's ship at the lieutenant's
request; but the brief expository
passages showing them together
before the "Bounty" sails are
pallid and uninformative — per
functory — and though the
filmmakers delineate the ship's
hierarchy and the individual
characters on every rung in the
first shipboard scenes, and
maintain narrative clarity
throughout, no tension develops
to bind the "Bounty's" troubles
at sea into one forward motion.
The men survive a fearsome
gale (in a skillfully directed and
photographed sequence that
Arthur Ibbetson seems to have
shot through cheesecloth), but
Bligh tells the court that they
spent a month battling bad wea
ther in an attempt to round
Cape Horn before he decided
on a less perilous route, and we
don't get a sense of the
cumulative effect of all that
physical hardship on the crew.
We learn of a sailor's death at
the hands of the ship's drunken,
incompetent physician (Mal
colm Terris), but since we
never see the doctor in action,

the incident makes no impres
sion on us. And when Bligh
replaces his first officer. Fryer
(Daniel Day-Lewis), with
Christian, after Fryer's
vociferous criticism of the com
mander during a storm, we
haven't had the opportunity to
observe enough of Fryer's be
havior to know if Bligh's accusa
tions of cowardice and inef
ficiency are justified, if Bligh is
lashing out against a subor
dinate officer who failed to back
him up, or if (as Hood and
Greetham suggest) it was simply
a case of favoritism — Bligh

elevating his best friend to a po
sition just below his own.
Bolt originally planned two
screenplays (with David Lean
directing) to chronicle the tale
of the "Bounty's" journey to
Tahiti, the mutiny under Chris
tian following the crew's forced
separation from the delights of
the island and the separate
fates of Bligh and Christian.
And Bolt's and Donaldson's
need to compress such an
incident-filled history into one
film (running slightly over two
hours) probably explains the
frustratingly episodic quality of
the first half, as well as those ir
ritating courtroom scenes,
which have no other apparent
purpose than to help keep the
dense narrative material
straight.
The other reason for our con
fusion in the first half of The
Bounty is Mel Gibson's portayal
of Fletcher Christian. Whereas
Anthony Hopkins gives a com
manding, complex performance
from the outset, Gibson is
surprisingly slight — he barely
seems to be in the picture at all,
and when Bligh tells the court of
Christian's courage, we don't
know what he's talking about.
But The Bounty, which in the
final analysis is a very good and
very subtle movie, hinges on
what Gibson, Bolt and
Donaldson do with Christian —
on how bewilderingly un
impressive he seems until the
ship reaches the island and how
his character reveals itself from
that point on.
Christian, more than any of
the other men, is bewitched by
the island; he falls in love with
Mauatua (Tevaie Vernette), the
daughter of King Tynah (Wi
Kuki Kaa), impregnates her,
receives her father's blessing on
their union, and becomes ever

more remote from his life as
first ship's officer — and from
Bligh. When he stops showing
up on board for dinner, Bligh
sends the bitterly resentful
Fryer to fetch him, and Fryer
finds him lying on his stomach in
a hut, holding Mauatua's hand
while a native tattoo artist
covers his back and buttocks
with totemic markings. As Gib
son plays this scene. Christian
seems drugged, feverish, barely
capable of raising his head to ac
knowledge Fryer's message; you
feel that his will has been
sapped — that he has become
more islander than Briton.
Using that scene as a dramatic
lever, the filmmakers build two
fascinating psychological
portraits, one of a man driven
by thwarted pride and ambition
to conduct himself in an unrea
sonable, inhumane fashion, and
one of an immature younger
man who rebels against an older
friend standing in loco parentis.

For the crux of the conflict be
tween these two is that Christian
is not the man Bligh thought
him, and the discrepancy be
tween Bligh's idealized image of
him — informed at least in part
by a homoerotic interest — and
Christian's real nature, causes
Bligh so much mental anguish
that he begins to behave cruelly
toward his friend and toward
the sailors who respect and
admire Christian, becoming a
hard taskmaster just at the point
when they require leniency and
understanding.
Consequently, Christian
retreats into a teenage pouti
ness, denying Bligh his
friendship, which of course ex
acerbates Bligh's feelings of in
adequacy and provokes even
more of a backlash from him.
Fearing the loss of his authority,
Bligh reintroduces his old plan
of rounding Cape Horn (which
would realize his ambition to
circumnavigate the globe), and
the men, turning openly hostile,
persuade Christian to spearhead
a mutiny. Ironically, then,
Bligh's disappointment in Chris
tian drives the younger man to
an act of courage he would
never have believed himself
master of — though it is the
filmmakers' (and Gibson's) spe
cial triumph that they show us
how Christian's audacity ter
rifies him, and how his revolt
against his surrogate father
divides him utterly, sending him
into turmoil. The men's worst
impulses surface when they find
themselves equipped with arms
and power, and Christian must
restrain them from manhandling
the commander whose
friendship he so lately prized. "I
am in hell, sir!" he screams as he
hears Bligh's rebukes. It's an ex
traordinary scene, overwrought

as it is — psychologically accu
rate, in fact, because it is so
overwrought.
If you have the patience to
ride out the first hour of the film
without losing hope, your trust
pays off, because the second
half wouldn't work without the
suggestions Donaldson and Bolt
plant in the first half. Besides,
problematic as they are, the
shipboard scenes possess their
own virtues — in the careful
detailing of the narrative, which
never fails to hold our interest,
in Donaldson's intelligent
craftsmanship,and especially in
Anthony Hopkins' acting and
the acting of Philip Martin
Brown in the much smaller role
of Adams, who pilots the ship.

(Later in the picture, when
Christian fears the crew will rise
up a second time gainst him, he
writes in the log that he trusts
only Adams, and we recognize
that Brown with simplicity and
understatement hut almost no
lines, has already convinced us
of Adams' root decency.)

sonable, inhumane fashion, and
one of an immature younger
man who rebels against an older
friend standing in loco parentis.

For the crux of the conflict be
tween these two is that Christian
is not the man Bligh thought
him, and the discrepancy be
tween Bligh's idealized image of
him — informed at least in part
by a homoerotic interest — and
Christian's real nature, causes
Bligh so much mental anguish
that he begins to behave cruelly
toward his friend and toward
the sailors who respect and
admire Christian, becoming a
hard taskmaster just at the point
when they require leniency and
understanding.
Consequently, Christian
retreats into a teenage pouti
ness, denying Bligh his
friendship, which of course ex
acerbates Bligh's feelings of in
adequacy and provokes even
more of a backlash from him.
Fearing the loss of his authority,
Bligh reintroduces his old plan
of rounding Cape Horn (which
would realize his ambition to
circumnavigate the globe), and
the men, turning openly hostile,
persuade Christian to spearhead
a mutiny. Ironically, then,
Bligh's disappointment in Chris
tian drives the younger man to
an act of courage he would
never have believed himself
master of — though it is the
filmmakers' (and Gibson's) spe
cial triumph that they show us
how Christian's audacity ter
rifies him, and how his revolt
against his surrogate father
divides him utterly, sending him
into turmoil. The men's worst
impulses surface when they find
themselves equipped with arms
and power, and Christian must
restrain them from manhandling
the commander whose
friendship he so lately prized. "I
am in hell, sir!" he screams as he
hears Bligh's rebukes. It's an ex
traordinary scene, overwrought

as it is — psychologically accu
rate, in fact, because it is so
overwrought.
If you have the patience to
ride out the first hour of the film
without losing hope, your trust
pays off, because the second
half wouldn't work without the
suggestions Donaldson and Bolt
plant in the first half. Besides,
problematic as they are, the
shipboard scenes possess their
own virtues — in the careful
detailing of the narrative, which
never fails to hold our interest,
in Donaldson's intelligent
craftsmanship,and especially in
Anthony Hopkins' acting and
the acting of Philip Martin
Brown in the much smaller role
of Adams, who pilots the ship.

(Later in the picture, when
Christian fears the crew will rise
up a second time gainst him, he
writes in the log that he trusts
only Adams, and we recognize
that Brown with simplicity and
understatement hut almost no
lines, has already convinced us
of Adams' root decency.)
The Bounty really is the scenes
following the ship's arrival at
Tahiti, though. In his last
picture, Smash Palace, Roger
Donaldson displayed a gift for
handling moments of emotional
crisis — moments that capture
men in particular almost past
the furthest point their en
durance will stretch — with ten
derness and variety; in The
Bounty he matches Mel Gib
son's finely played passion
during the mutiny with a Inter
scene in which the old king must
say farewell to his daughter,
who has chosen to sail with
Christian to unknown islands
(where he hopes to evade the
long arm of British naval law).
The Bounty probably doesn't
have a chance at the box office

because it's not the sweeping
historical epic audiences will ex
pect, and then, you have to stick
with it. And how will Mel Gib
son fans, who loved him as Mad
Max, respond to him as an un
heroic Fletcher Christian?
Audiences didn't flock to see
him in The Year of Living Dan
gerously (glamorous a** it was),
in which the character he played
demonstrated considerably les>
moral strength than Sigourney
Weaver's or Linda Hunt's,
though perhaps other consider
ations kept them away, too. (A
pity; it was a marvelous
picture.) Yet I've never seen a
better piece of acting from Gib
son than he gives in The Bounty,
and the movie is tremendously

stirring, as it turns out — only
not in ways one might have im
agined.
When Christian and his
mutineers set out in quest of a
safe haven. Donaldson moves
back and forth between the
perils of his voyage and those of
Bligh's on an open boat with
those of the crew who have
remained loyal to him: under
the new pressures of a journey
they all assume will kill them,
Bligh rediscovers both his com
mand and his humanity, while
Christian is left shattered by the
force of his own actions — his
decision to choose mutiny over
his filial love for Bligh. It's a
potent double irony. When
Christian and his followers
make shore at Piteuirn Island
and incincerate the "Bounty,"
Donaldson travels from one
face to the next as these outlaws
watch their last ties to their pre
vious lives vanish — and we can
read each one's thoughts. You
may be amazed at how long that
moments lingers in your mind.

The pictorial splendor of the
credits sequence that begins The
Bounty — the ocean and the
Tahitian Islands glimpsed at
sunrise and at dusk — and Van
gelis' pumped-up music behind
them (scored in the style that's
his specialty: canned inspira
tional), prepare us for a stirring
sea epic. But New Zealand
filmmaker Roger Donaldson,
who directed the remarkable
domestic drama Smash Palace,
and screenwriter Robert Bolt,
who is most famous for writing
A Man for All Seasons, have
something quite different in
mind.
They've even started from an
unusual source — Richard
Hough's book "Captain Bligh
and Mr. Christian," an attempt
to reconstruct the true story of
the mutiny aboard the cargo
ship "Bounty" in the late 1 Sth
century, rather than the romantic
adventure novels by Nordhoff
and Hall that spawned both the
highly successful 1935 film with
Clark Gable and Charles
Laughton and the 1962 fiasco
with Marlon Brando and Trevor
I loward.
This Bounty commences in a

military courtroom, where Ad
miral Mood (Laurence Olivier),
Captain Cireetham (Edward
l ow) and other naval officers
try lieutenant Bligh (Anthony
Hopkins) on the charge of
losing his ship on a voyage in
tended to transport breadfruit
from Tahiti to the British colony
at Jamaica. And with
Donaldson and Bolt shifting
back and forth between the
courtroom and the flashbacks to
the "Bounty," introduced by
Bligh's testimony, it's hard to
get our hearings. In this version
of the material, Bligh and

Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson)
are good friends; Christian signs
up as master's mate aboard
Bligh's ship at the lieutenant's
request; but the brief expository
passages showing them together
before the "Bounty" sails are
pallid and uninformative — per
functory — and though the
filmmakers delineate the ship's
hierarchy and the individual
characters on every rung in the
first shipboard scenes, and
maintain narrative clarity
throughout, no tension develops
to bind the "Bounty's" troubles
at sea into one forward motion.
The men survive a fearsome
gale (in a skillfully directed and
photographed sequence that
Arthur Ibbetson seems to have
shot through cheesecloth), but
Bligh tells the court that they
spent a month battling bad wea
ther in an attempt to round
Cape Horn before he decided
on a less perilous route, and we
don't get a sense of the
cumulative effect of all that
physical hardship on the crew.
We learn of a sailor's death at
the hands of the ship's drunken,
incompetent physician (Mal
colm Terris), but since we
never see the doctor in action,

the incident makes no impres
sion on us. And when Bligh
replaces his first officer. Fryer
(Daniel Day-Lewis), with
Christian, after Fryer's
vociferous criticism of the com
mander during a storm, we
haven't had the opportunity to
observe enough of Fryer's be
havior to know if Bligh's accusa
tions of cowardice and inef
ficiency are justified, if Bligh is
lashing out against a subor
dinate officer who failed to back
him up, or if (as Hood and
Greetham suggest) it was simply
a case of favoritism — Bligh

elevating his best friend to a po
sition just below his own.
Bolt originally planned two
screenplays (with David Lean
directing) to chronicle the tale
of the "Bounty's" journey to
Tahiti, the mutiny under Chris
tian following the crew's forced
separation from the delights of
the island and the separate
fates of Bligh and Christian.
And Bolt's and Donaldson's
need to compress such an
incident-filled history into one
film (running slightly over two
hours) probably explains the
frustratingly episodic quality of
the first half, as well as those ir
ritating courtroom scenes,
which have no other apparent
purpose than to help keep the
dense narrative material
straight.
The other reason for our con
fusion in the first half of The
Bounty is Mel Gibson's portayal
of Fletcher Christian. Whereas
Anthony Hopkins gives a com
manding, complex performance
from the outset, Gibson is
surprisingly slight — he barely
seems to be in the picture at all,
and when Bligh tells the court of
Christian's courage, we don't
know what he's talking about.
But The Bounty, which in the
final analysis is a very good and
very subtle movie, hinges on
what Gibson, Bolt and
Donaldson do with Christian —
on how bewilderingly un
impressive he seems until the
ship reaches the island and how
his character reveals itself from
that point on.
Christian, more than any of
the other men, is bewitched by
the island; he falls in love with
Mauatua (Tevaie Vernette), the
daughter of King Tynah (Wi
Kuki Kaa), impregnates her,
receives her father's blessing on
their union, and becomes ever

more remote from his life as
first ship's officer — and from
Bligh. When he stops showing
up on board for dinner, Bligh
sends the bitterly resentful
Fryer to fetch him, and Fryer
finds him lying on his stomach in
a hut, holding Mauatua's hand
while a native tattoo artist
covers his back and buttocks
with totemic markings. As Gib
son plays this scene. Christian
seems drugged, feverish, barely
capable of raising his head to ac
knowledge Fryer's message; you
feel that his will has been
sapped — that he has become
more islander than Briton.
Using that scene as a dramatic
lever, the filmmakers build two
fascinating psychological
portraits, one of a man driven
by thwarted pride and ambition
to conduct himself in an unrea
sonable, inhumane fashion, and
one of an immature younger
man who rebels against an older
friend standing in loco parentis.

For the crux of the conflict be
tween these two is that Christian
is not the man Bligh thought
him, and the discrepancy be
tween Bligh's idealized image of
him — informed at least in part
by a homoerotic interest — and
Christian's real nature, causes
Bligh so much mental anguish
that he begins to behave cruelly
toward his friend and toward
the sailors who respect and
admire Christian, becoming a
hard taskmaster just at the point
when they require leniency and
understanding.
Consequently, Christian
retreats into a teenage pouti
ness, denying Bligh his
friendship, which of course ex
acerbates Bligh's feelings of in
adequacy and provokes even
more of a backlash from him.
