# Arms expert Dyson calls for disarmament

" Having nuclear arms in some sense
commits you to using them," theoreti
cal physicist Freeman Dyson warned
an overflow Terman Auditorium
crowd last night.
Dyson, a former consultant to the
Defense Department and The Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
and currently at Princeton's Institute
foi Advanced Studies, said his
• fundamental concept in regard to nu
clear arms is just don't use them." But
the problem with this ideal approach is
that it is not really consistent with
having nuclear weapons at all.
I'm not sure if you can create a dis
tinction in reality between no use and
no possession," Dyson said. "II you
keep your weapons and don't use
them, what does that mean and where
do you put them?"
Dyson said he prefers to take a
long-range view of things and find ob
jectives that make sense.
"Nothing we are doing now makes
sense," he said. "Unfortunately, the
no use' concept isn't feasible because
it doesn't stand up to what 1 call the
test (if robustness. If a concept is going
to regulate the weapons, it must be as
strong as the weapons themselves."
Unilateral disarmament is "the best
way out to resist the danger of political
domination by the Soviet Union,"
Dyson said. The United States is "not
really fighting against invasion unless
we are worried about the Mexicans.
What we are trying to do is to defend
our friends, our credibility and all
those nebulous things."
Dyson sees two alternatives for dis
armament — to proceed unilaterally
or to wait for a bilateral agreement.

"Unilateral disarmament in some
sense leaves the Soviet Union om
nipotent. but I don't believe it's an ab
surd option or one that would neces
sarily be disasterous" Dyson stated.
Bilateral disarmament would
"require the abandonment in the
belief in the balance of terror and the
principle of first use." Dyson said. Ac
cording to Dyson, il the United States
follows ;i "live and let live" policy,
three things must be established: The
country must be willing to get rid of
nuclear weapons, to negotiate about
things other than nuclear weapons and
to begin to use technology to help
make nuclear weapons obsolete.
Were this country to adopt the "live
and let live" policy, the action would
open up more common ground in
negotiations with the Soviets, Dyson
said.
"The Soviets have a somewhat bet
ter view of the role of nuclear weap
ons. They know that they could live
very well without nuclear arms, and in
that way the Soviets are somewhat
closer to the 'live and let live' concept
than is the United States," Dyson said.
"The Soviets understand that the
weapons can destroy, but aren't very
good at conquering," Dyson said.
" This view extends from the days of
Stalin, who said, 'Nuclear weapons are
something with which you frighten
somebody with weak nerves.' "
Bilateral disarmament would end the
dependence upon threats for security
for all nations of the world, he said.
Dyson spoke at the Fourth Annual
Arms Control Guest Lecture, co
sponsored by the Stanford Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Forum and the
Department of Values, Technology,
Science and Society.
