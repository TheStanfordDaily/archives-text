# Immediate end to payroll deductions
## University cuts off USW dues 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
The University, saying the Stanford
bargaining unit is still without a union
despite last month's election, has
stopped collecting dues from United
Stanford Workers (USW) unit
employees.
In an open letter to the Stanford
community circulated yesterday, U». •
versitv President Donald Kennedy
said Local 715 stopped representing
workers before the Local 6XO disaf
filiation vote.
"Since no disaffiliation election
preceded Local 715*s abandonment of
the bargaining unit, it appears that
service, maintenance and technical
employees have not had a union rep

resentative since approximately Feb.
4." Kennedy said in the letter.
His remarks came in the wake of an
April 30 National Labor Relations
Board ruling that Local 715
"effectively disclaimed interest" in
representing the bargaining unit in
early February.
USW officials label Kennedy's ac
, tions "illegal" and designed to
break the union. "We want a good re
lationship with Stanford, hut Ken
nedy's actions all add up to union bus
ting," said USW President Linda
Crouse.
Jim Eggleston. counsel to USW.
said that Kennedy's claims are untrue.
Eggleston said USWs April IS elec
tion was valid and the University's

only goal is "destroying union repre
sentation at Stanford."
Kennedy's letter said Local 680, if it
wanted University recognition, should
"use the procedures created by federal
law ... in a secret ballot election con
ducted by the NLRB. Such an NLRB
election will give both the University
and the union an opportunity to pro
vide employees with all the informa
tion necessary to make un informed
decision."
Eggleston said the April 18 election
was completely within NLRB
guidelines, and Stanford wants an
NL RB election so it too can partici
pate in the campaign. A disaffiliation
election is an internal union matter
from which the employer is barred

from participating while an NLRB or
ganizing election has campaigning
open to both the employer and union
organizers.
Eggleston added that the validity of
the April 18 election, which resulted
in a 630-125 vote in favor ol Local
680, would be decided when the
NLRB reaches a ruling on Local 680's
unfair labor pntetwe charges against
the University.
The union has charged Stanford
with refusing to recognize Local 680
as the legal representative of the USW
bargaining unit even after the April IN
election. Eggleston believes that a fa
vorable ruling by the regional NLRB
officc will confirm the validity of Local
680.
"II the board issues a complaint
(finds valid grounds in USW's
charges) then the regional office will
have made a prima facia finding that
the disaffiliation process was valid and
the disaffiliation has been perfected,"
he said

Priscilla Wheeler, University staff
counsel, said the regional office's
ruling would not be the end of the
matter. She said the University would
take the matter to higher NLRB levels
in order to process the regional of
fice's complaint in a hearing.
Eggleston said the University is
"hiding behind" legal technicalities
and accused Stanford of "stretching
out the legal process by delaying and
using obstructing tactics." He added
that "none of Stanford's tactics at this
point show any concern for their

employees."
Wheeler said the lack of official
union representation does not mean
Stanford workers would lose any
rights or benefits derived from their
collective agreement. According to
Wheeler, employee reclassifications,
step increases and individual griev
ances would continue to be processed
by the University.
Wheeler added that union dues that
have been taken out of employee
paychecks will be returned to the indi
vidual employees.
