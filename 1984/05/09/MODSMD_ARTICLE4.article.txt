# Profs get their day with Hoover panel

### BAIE NEIZER Senior staff writer 
Taking one last step in a fight to investigate ties
between the University and the Hoover Institu
tion, two professors met yesterday with a Board of
Trustees committee and asked for responses to two
demands.
Issuing a statement before the Trustee Commit
tee on the Hoover Institution. Political Science
Prof. John Manley asked that an outside commit
tee be formed to investigate Stanford-Hoover ties
and that University President Donald Kennedy
defend publicly the University's relationship with
Hoover.
Though the statement was issued on behalf of
Manley and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, Man
ley said a petition tilled with 102 faculty signatures
demands a response from the committee.

"When large numbers of responsible faculty and
students ask for a chance to be heard publicly
before those in positions of power on an issue of
vital importance to the University, how can you
justify saying 'no'?" Manley asked in his state
ment.
He defined the problem as "political activities
by the Hoover Institution" and said the danger of
such activities to the University needs to be ex
amined.
In a later interview, Manley pointed to com
ments by President Reagan saying that Hoover
had provided him with more research than any
other source. Manley also said more than 40
people associated with Hoover have worked with
the Reagan administration at various times.
"More importantly is its existence as the most
widely acknowledged and leading conservative

think-tank," he said.
In the statement, Manley also criticized a com
ment by Kennedy which stated Kennedy's opposi
tion to an open forum on the Hoover issue.
"If those in positions of power decide not even
to discuss issues publicly, they may get their way.
There will be no debate," the statement said.
"What about open discussion and democratic
participation?" Manley said in the interview.
"Are they to be denied just because Don says he
won't talk to you?"
In a separate six-page report, Rebhol/ pointed
to the governance and appointment procedures at
Hoover as subordinate issues because they are
"designed for Hoover as an institution to conduct
its political activities on behalf of causes outlined
by Herbert Hoover."
These causes support I loover's poli
tical mission which "opposes com
munism and any alternatives to free
enterprise." Rebhol/ said.
Kennedy said last night that the
committee is not now planning any
formal response to Manley and Reb
hol/ s statement.
"They asked to present their views,
and so we allowed them to come and
present them." Kennedy said. "I'm
sure the committee was glad to hear
their views, and we'll probably be dis
cussing them further, but we're not
planning any tormal response.
But according to Manley, no
response will effectively mean a
negative response to his demands.
"If there's no response, then that's
still a response," Manley said. "It will
unfortunately be the worst possible
response for people in a university to
make."
Manley said the statement before
the committee attempted a
breakthrough and that lack of a
response from the committee would
signify a return to the "lamentable sit
uation we've had in the past."
If the Board fails to respond or
responds negatively to Manley and
Rebholz's demands, Manley said the
only action left would be to call the
Stanford community's attention to
that response.
Rebholz said he left the committee
meeting feeling "powerless."
"1 think this five-person committee
has decided that it is the appropriate
committee to consider this subject,
and I don't think it is appropriate," he
said.
