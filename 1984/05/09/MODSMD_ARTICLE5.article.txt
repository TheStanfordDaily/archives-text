### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
The I init I rankings in two spring
quarter ASSU Senate races were
decided by the flip of senate chair .lug
Jagadish's coin at a senate meeting last
night.
Ip the race lor the graduate engi
neering senate seat. Pardner Wynn,
senator Don Gardner and senator
Dirk Van Conipernolle were all tied
for fourth place with three votes
apiece. The senate, however, ratified
senator Erik Thompson's proposal to
break the deadlock with a coin flip
In the final results. Gardner was
awarded the top alternate spot ahead
of Wynn. Van Conipernolle told the
Senate that he was willing to drop to
sixth place, because he planned to go
overseas next year.
Senator Mark Soble had objected to
the use of a coin flip to arrive at the
decision. It was not the best way to
decide between two candidates "who
both want very much to be in the sen
ate."' Soble said.
An undergraduate senate ranking
was decided in the same fashion, i his
time the coin flip gave Carey White
the lOth-place ranking in the election
over senator Jon Adelstein.
Die senate then certified the entire
spring quarter election results, which
included the validation of the Clean
Sl.tie as the winner of the April ;t '

runoff election for senior class presi
dent.
Senator Mike Lieberman sparked
debate with his proposal that the
ASSU not certify the fee assessment
which was approved for The Daily in
the recent elections.
"Recently The Daily endorsed Sen.
Gary Hart's Democratic nomination,
Lieberman said in his address to the
senate. "Although I might agree with
the endorsement, this is against the
University policy to be partisan.
"Obviously this is a partisan act.
and I don't think that the ASSU
should defer students' funds to this
group." Lieberman said.
Soble. in disagreeing with Eieber
man, said The Daily was a "volunteer
student organization."
"I don't think that there is any type
of rule from the point of view ot our
(the senate's) dispersion of money
which prevents us from giving it to the
ASSU." Soble said. "Rather, there
may be a University rule which goes
against that.
After a lengthy discussion, senate
members voted to-certify all ol the lee
assessments.
University President Donald Ken
nedy spoke at the meeting and
discussed campus issues such as Uni
veisitv labor relations and residential
housinu.
