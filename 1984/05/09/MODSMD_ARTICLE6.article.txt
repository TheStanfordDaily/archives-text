### DAVID RISSER Staff writer 
The 1984 presidential candidates
should "challenge concepts used to
justify nuclear arms buildups and
not the quantitative measures and
technological aspects of the
buildup," former senator and
presidential candidate Eugene
McCarthy said here yesterday.
McCarthy, who sought the Dem
ocratic presidential nomination in
I 968 and '72 and ran as an inde
pendent in '76. told about 100
people at the Law School yesterday
that the attitude toward nuclear
war is the most prominent of
several issues inadequately dis
cussed in this year's election.
Former Vice President Walter
Mondale and Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart are arguing over specific
weapons systems and what
percentage of the gross national
product should be spent on
defense, issues that, according to
McCarthy, are "all \er\ secondary
and distracting."
The candidates are also inade
quately addressing the "extent to
which decisions in every part of

American life are made through
the corporate structure.
McCarthy said.
Singling out the corporate influ
ence in military and policy deci
sions, he said. "The militarx
industrial complex is a manifesta
tion of the corporate spirit and
weapons systems have become a
projection of corporate profit
motives."
"Multinational corporations
make their own foreign policv and
are currently able to escape normal
controls." McCarthy said citing
the Nestle Corporation as .in exam
ple.
He stressed the need to curb the

wastefulness of the U.S. consump
tion system, primarily in the auto
mobile indll st r\. "Wars and
automobiles produce the same
waste â€” they waste time. mone>.
materials and human life."
McCarthy said.
He said the Chrysler loan, if
made at all. should have been con
tingent on producing certain types
ol cars. He did not discuss waste in
the public sector, saying. "The
waste in the Defense Department
is probably the best thing in it." .
Hie former senator also spoke of
the overwhelming power of the
federal bureaucracy. The I ederal
Communications Commission, in
its control of television and radio,
has an "enormous potential to af
fect education, news, entertain
ment and our culture in general."
McCarthy said. McCarthy sugges

ted banning advertising from news
programs and all political and reli
gions ad\ ertiscments.
In an interview with The Daily.
McCarthy addressed his 19N0 en
dorsement ol Ronald Reagan's
presidential bid. "I \ iew it as a par
tial endorsement and more as a
non-endorsement ol Carter than
anything else." Ire said. The en
dorsement decision was based on
the feeling that "Carter was gener
ally incompetent." McCarthy said.
Assessing Reagan's performance
over the past three years.
McCarthy s;ud economic improve
ments should have been made
without cutbacks in social pro
grams. but that the blame for the
cutbacks is shared with Congress.
"No irreparable harm has been
done to social programs or foreign
policy (under the Reagan adminis
tration) but possibly nothing posi
tive has been done." McCarthy
said.
Reagan's foreign policy and that
of many recent presidents has been

dominated by ideological concerns
and a resorting to military means to
solve problems. McCarthy said.
Such a policy leads to ideas ot "a
justified nuclear buildup, winnable
nuclear war and justifiable con
frontation with communism." and
is "more dangerous today than
during Vietnam.' McCarthy said.
He said Reagan's policy in
Central America is "like the gun
boat politics ot the 19205." He
referred to I I Salvador as "not an
other Vietnam, but not automati
cally justified."
McCarthy also discussed the
1984 Democratic nomination.
"Mondale is wrong or indifferent
on most important considerations.
I am most hopeful about Gary
Haat," he s;iid. He praised Jesse
Jackson for being "clear on the
points he has brought up regarding
party rules" and for "making an
issue of the extension of corporate
power."
