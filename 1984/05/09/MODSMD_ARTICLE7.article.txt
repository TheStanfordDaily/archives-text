House leader backs Reagan
Washington — House Majority Leader Jim W right, break
ing with other Democratic congressional leaders, said yester
day its time Congress gave President Reagan the money he
wants for El Salvador.
it doesn't make any sense to have a friend who is bleeding
and refuse to give him a tourniquet," the Texas Democrat
told reporters after a bipartisan leadership meeting at the
White House.
Wright met with the president before the House took up a
SID.S billion foreign aid bill, which is providing the back
ground for several days of debate on three divergent plans for
supplying aid to the Central American nation.
I he president is stepping up pressure to win congressional
approval for new military funding for El Salvador. Today he
is scheduled to make a nationally televised speech about his
view that victory over leftist guerrillas in El Salvador is vital
to U.S. interests.
Yesterday, Reagan warned of "grim consequences" if the
United States failed to meet what he said were the Soviet
and Cuban-backed challenges in Central America.
It's not only their security; it's our security," Reagan told
a gathering at the State Department of the Council of the
Americas, a private group with business interests in Latin
America.
Reagan told congressional leaders it was important to elim
inate the causes of subversion in Central America, according
ie Speakes. He also urged Congress to give El Salvador the
support it needs, arguing it would be wrong to give them "just
enough to allow them to bleed to death," Speakes said.
Bush advocates trade
between U.S. and japan
Tokyo — Vice President George Bush said on his arrival
here yesterday that President Reagan was pleased with the
progress made on U.S.-Japan economic issues, but added: "I
have to emphasize that more needs to be done, now and in
the future."
Bush is scheduled to be in Japan for three days as head of
an inter-agency task force following up on issues left ovei
from the president's visit to Japan last November.
No sooner had he arrive than he was handed a surprise.
Susumu Nikaido. vice president of the ruling Liberal Demo
cratic Party, reportedly told Bush that Japan should continue
its restraints on exports of passenger cars to the United States
beyond the cutoff date of March 31, 1985.
It was the first time an influential Japanese leader had
argued in favor of continuing the restraints, which have lim
ited exports to 1.85 million units a year.
Nikaido, w ho will leave today for the United States, where
he is scheduled to meet President Reagan, said it was only his
personal opinion that the restraints should continue. He said
he feared that a sudden spurt of exports would cause trouble
in the United States.
Bush was reported to have said that the position on
restraints taken by William Brock, Reagan's trade represen
tative, has provoked "many opposing opinions." Brock said
not long ago that the restraints on auto exports should be
allowed to expire.
Pope talks to tribes about rites
Port \lorrsby, Papua New Guinea — Pope John Paul II
journeyed to the mile-high town of Mount Hagen yesterday,
said Mass to Stone Age tribespeople and urged an end to an
cient customs such as polygamy in the highlands, where seven
pigs buys a bride.
The pope planned to fly onto the tiny western Pacific island
nation of the Solomon Islands today. During an eight-hour
stop on Guadalcanal, he is to say Mass and visit a hospital and
prison before flying back to Port Moresby.
He planned to fly tomorrow to Bangkok, the last stop on
his 1 1-day Pacific journey.
Tribespeople journeyed for days, some for weeks, to hear
the pope say Mass in Pidgin English at Mount Hagen. The
crowd of 180.000 Melanesians, many wearing feathers and
grass skirts, chanted, "Mi laikum yu Pop!" (I love you. Pope!)
in Pidgin.
DeLorean contests government
Los Angeles — John DeLorean's lawyers charged yesterday
that the government may have tried to undercut the
automaker's defense against cocaine-trafficking charges by
obtaining the telephone toll records of a private investigator
hired by the defense.
Attorney Donald Re also advised U.S. District Judge
Robert Takasugi that the FBI is upset with his fellow defense
counsel, Howard Weitzman. Re suggested that Weitzman
might be a target for reprisal by the government.
Re's expressions of concern came without jurors present
after Weitzman had completed nearly eight full days of cross
examination of FBI Agent Benedict Tisa, the prosecution's
first witness in the 33-day-old DeLorean trial.
After hearing from the defense and the prosecution,
Takasugi instructed the government to produce telephone
records subpoenaed by the Drug Enforcment Administration.
The judge dismissed the verbal flurry over Weitzman and the
FBI as statements made "in the heat of battle."
Torch relay begins in showers
New York — The Olympic torch relay began yesterday in a
spring shower and under the cloud of a Soviet boycott of the
1984 Summer Games at Los Angeles.
Only a short time after the torch began its cross-country
journey, the Soviet Union announced it would not attend the
Games becuase of the United States' "cavalier attitude"
toward the Olympic Charter.
By late afternoon, the flame, which arrived from Greece
Monday, had left New York City on its way through Connec
ticut toward Boston, where it was due to arrive tomorrow.
One torch bearer was particularly affected by the news of
the Soviet pullout.
Mark Breeland, an Olympic boxer from New York, started
his relay kilometer to the salutes of a sizable crowd and a high
school band, but he did not hide his disappointment.
"No. I don't like it. " Breeland said, "but I got to keep on
going. I'm still going for the gold."
Others, exhilarated by their participation in moving the
torch to Los Angeles, were h:ss bothered.
"Who cares. Who cares," said Joanne Ruggiro of New
York.
The torch relay, which will cover some 8700 miles to the
Los Angeles Coliseum, began at the United Nations Plaza
after a brief ceremony attended by the mayors of New York
and Los Angeles.
