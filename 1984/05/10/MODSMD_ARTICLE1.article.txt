## Too Far, Too Fast, Too Soon

On the face of it. everything
seems fine. In fact, at Stanford
people look better, appear
healthier, and seem to have
boundless energy.
Stanford students are con
summate achievers. Yet, in
some areas they can overac
hieve in the most unfortunate
ways. By going too far, too
fast, too soon, the top of the
ladder is not reached. Instead,
students get exhausted before
making it to the top, get
tangled in the rungs, or fall off
the ladder altogether.
In this issue of The Student
Body, we are featuring articles
on " How Far Is Too Far?" For
example, it is our experience
that Stanford students do not
just begin exercising, but push
themselves to run four miles
the first week. The result can
be injury, pain, and a bruised

ego rather than better fitness.
Sometimes it seems that trying
to get in shape or perform well
all at once is a way to make
sure we do not succeed.
• Many Stanford students, in
trying to manage their
weight, find themselves in a
state of chronic hunger, too
weak to exercise or study. Or
after a harsh period of
dieting, they feel so deprived
that they hinge on enormous
amounts of food.
• Other students may take
potentially hazardous
anabolic steroids to improve
their athletic performance
but do not attend to simple
nutritional considerations
which can enhance the very
performance they are inter
ested in.
• And how many students
have been known to seek a
summer's long tan in a
weekend?

How far is too far? Too far
means ignoring the internal
barometer indicating pain
which should not he"run
through." Too far is also
the relentless hunger,
lightheadedness and ir
ritability of too little food in
the service of the perfect body.
Too far is hinging on alcohol
or food, with the resultant ter
rible feelings about oneself.
Fitness, looking good, get
ting in shape and good health
are intimately tied together.
Ultimately, sacrificing one
sacrifices all of them.
Fast results are seductive.
But when it come to fitness
and well-being, going too far.
too fast, too soon does not get
us where we want to be. We
urge you to rely less on im
mediate results than on the in
ternal barometer which is a
gauge of "how far is just
right."
