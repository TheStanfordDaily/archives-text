# Fitness: Seek the Middle Road
## 
### Lindy Birkel Fitness Project Manager Health Promotion Program 
On nearly every magazine
cover this spring, you will see
headlines on shaping up and
physical fitness. From a health
standpoint, this is a very favor
able craze. The health benefits of
exercise are numerous and very
desirable.

But can this passtime be taken
too far? As with most things, yes.
There are hazards with the ex
treme.
Consider yourself at some
point along an exercise con
tinuum according to your level of
activity. At both ends of this con
tinuum, you are likely to be in a
poorer state of health than if you
are in the middle. That is, too
little or too much exercise can be
bad for your health.
Not exercising can bring about

a greater risk of heart disease,
poor muscle tone and endurance,
hone and joint disorders, over
weight, and a generally diminised
sense of well-being or lack of
vitality. The minimum amount of
exercise necessary to provide a
substantial boost in fitness and,
therefore, health is the following
prescription: Twenty minutes of
aerobic exercise (e.g. walking,

jogging, cycling, swimming,
aerobic dance, etc.) every other
day.
Amounts of activity less than
this, such as a weekly intramural
game, do not bring a person to
the threshold of good health.
That is, to consider yourself in
shape, you must (at a minimum)
complete the above exercise
prescription on a regular basis.
The upper limit of the healthy
range cannot be defined with a
prescription. Different individ

uals seem to have different levels
of exercise at which one of the
following unhealthy symptoms
occurs: excessive weight loss, in
jury, amenorrhea or a breakdown
in relationships. Excessive weight
loss and amenorrhea result trom
exceedingly high levels of activity
for many people that, once
passed, injuries resulting from
overuse begin to occur. For best
health, it is clear that a gradually
developed, moderate exercise
program produces the maximum
in health benefits without the risk
of unhealthy symptoms.
The following is a more
detailed description of each ail
ment.
Excessive weight loss
A certain amount of fat is nec
essary for healthy body function.
In fact, studies have shown that
those with "a little padding" are
actually in better health than
those very thin or those very fat.
The standard for thinness in our
society is without regard for
health. When considering a re
ducing program, keep in mind
that a recent Cowell survey
showed that most Stanford stu
dents do not need to lose weight
and, in fact, would sacrifice a bit
of good health in doing so.
A moderate exercise program
is desirable to improve the gen
eral body tone and prov ide other
health benefits, and, on such a
program, pounds will gradually

come off.
An intense exercise program
focused at dropping large
amounts of weight is not only un
healthy, but likely to be un
successful. It has been shown that
the faster weight is taken off, the
faster it is put back on. So, if
weight loss is a goal for you, it
makes sense to do so with a
moderate exercise program that
you can maintain for a long per
iod of time. A moderate program
will not lead to excessive drops in
weight, and any weight lost will
stay oil il the activity level is
maintained. In this way. you can
reap the benefits of exercise while
reducing the chance of poor
health from too much weight loss.
Injury
Stress fractures, shin splints
and many knee and other joint in
juries are associated with overuse
of the muscles, bones and joints
involved in physical activity. Put
ting your body into a more active
state naturally increases the risk
that you will incur an injury. Here

are some things you can do to les
sen that risk:
Develop your exercise program
gradually. Yes, you probably
could run a mile or two or dance
20 minutes on your first day out,
hut there is no reason to do so.
You are likely to become sore
and you run a greater risk of in
curring injury when your muscles
are in poor tone. The tact is that it
is the duration of activity, not the
intensity, that is important for
health. This means that you will
get more out of walking and jog
ging two miles in 35 minutes than
you would get jogging two miles
in 20 minutes. The same is true of
aerobic dance, cycling, swimming
or any other activity you may
choose. And, if such a program
were followed regularly, your
strength and endurance would
build to the two-miles-in-20-
minutes level without increasing
risk of injury and with the gain of
all the health benefits.
Exercise in moderation. Even
with a careful, gradual develop
ment in physical condition, many
people reach a threshold where
overuse injuries occur. It is very
important to be aware of your
body signals and stop at the first

sign of pain or extreme fatigue.
The workout sacrificied will not
affect your state of health and fit
ness nearly as much as a debilitat
ing injury.
Always warm up and cool
down. Warm-up includes proper
stretching of all muscles to he

used, with a gradual increase in
the intensity of exercise at a
workout level. This means that in
a bicycling program , for example,
legs and arms should be stretched
followed by slow cycling on flat
ground with gradual increases in
pace until the workout level of cy
clinu is achieved.

The cool down should he just
the opposite. Stopping suddenly
can cause a suddent drop in the
return of blood from the working
muscles to the heart. This can
lead to the heart's pumping on an
empty chamber which precedes
dizziness and possible collapse.
After you have slowed down
gradually, it is important to
stretch once again for increased
flexibility and prevention of sore
ness.
Amenorrhea
There is an association be
tween high levels of exercise and
the cessation of menstruation.
Generally, only highly trained
athletes doing extremely intense
workouts consistently miss their
menstrual periods. However,
many women may stop
menstruating due to a strict diet
or exercise program where large
amounts of weight are lost. This is
due to the stress imposed on the
body in such a severe regimen.
While many women find it
desirable to lose their period, it
should be considered that there is
an association between amenor
rhea and an increased suscep
tibility to stress fractures. This is
thought to be due to the increased

risk of osteoporosis imposed by
changes in the hormones in the
abscence of menstruation. Os
teoporosis is a serious disease
whose symptoms can be des
cribed as soft or mushy bones, of
ten leading to a "hunchback"
syndrome in old age.
So again a moderate exercise
program will not induce the
shock to the system that precedes
amenorrhea, but will produce in
stead health benefits.
With these facts in mind, try to
pinpoint a goal for yourself on the
exercise continuum. Remember
that for the best health, a spot
right on the middle is optimal. In
reaching for that goal, it is impor
tant to start slow and stay
moderate to get the most out of
you exercise sessions.
Proper implementation of a
regular exercise program will
bring a reduced risk of heart
disease, maintained moderate
weight loss, strength, endurance,
prevention of bone and joint dis
orders. and. perhaps most impor
tant of all. an increased sense of
well-being, better sleep, less
stress, more energy, greater effi
ciency and improved vitality and
outlook on life.

overuse begin to occur. For best
health, it is clear that a gradually
developed, moderate exercise
program produces the maximum
in health benefits without the risk
of unhealthy symptoms.
The following is a more
detailed description of each ail
ment.
Excessive weight loss
A certain amount of fat is nec
essary for healthy body function.
In fact, studies have shown that
those with "a little padding" are
actually in better health than
those very thin or those very fat.
The standard for thinness in our
society is without regard for
health. When considering a re
ducing program, keep in mind
that a recent Cowell survey
showed that most Stanford stu
dents do not need to lose weight
and, in fact, would sacrifice a bit
of good health in doing so.
A moderate exercise program
is desirable to improve the gen
eral body tone and prov ide other
health benefits, and, on such a
program, pounds will gradually

come off.
An intense exercise program
focused at dropping large
amounts of weight is not only un
healthy, but likely to be un
successful. It has been shown that
the faster weight is taken off, the
faster it is put back on. So, if
weight loss is a goal for you, it
makes sense to do so with a
moderate exercise program that
you can maintain for a long per
iod of time. A moderate program
will not lead to excessive drops in
weight, and any weight lost will
stay oil il the activity level is
maintained. In this way. you can
reap the benefits of exercise while
reducing the chance of poor
health from too much weight loss.
Injury
Stress fractures, shin splints
and many knee and other joint in
juries are associated with overuse
of the muscles, bones and joints
involved in physical activity. Put
ting your body into a more active
state naturally increases the risk
that you will incur an injury. Here

are some things you can do to les
sen that risk:
Develop your exercise program
gradually. Yes, you probably
could run a mile or two or dance
20 minutes on your first day out,
hut there is no reason to do so.
You are likely to become sore
and you run a greater risk of in
curring injury when your muscles
are in poor tone. The tact is that it
is the duration of activity, not the
intensity, that is important for
health. This means that you will
get more out of walking and jog
ging two miles in 35 minutes than
you would get jogging two miles
in 20 minutes. The same is true of
aerobic dance, cycling, swimming
or any other activity you may
choose. And, if such a program
were followed regularly, your
strength and endurance would
build to the two-miles-in-20-
minutes level without increasing
risk of injury and with the gain of
all the health benefits.
Exercise in moderation. Even
with a careful, gradual develop
ment in physical condition, many
people reach a threshold where
overuse injuries occur. It is very
important to be aware of your
body signals and stop at the first

sign of pain or extreme fatigue.
The workout sacrificied will not
affect your state of health and fit
ness nearly as much as a debilitat
ing injury.
Always warm up and cool
down. Warm-up includes proper
stretching of all muscles to he

used, with a gradual increase in
the intensity of exercise at a
workout level. This means that in
a bicycling program , for example,
legs and arms should be stretched
followed by slow cycling on flat
ground with gradual increases in
pace until the workout level of cy
clinu is achieved.

The cool down should he just
the opposite. Stopping suddenly
can cause a suddent drop in the
return of blood from the working
muscles to the heart. This can
lead to the heart's pumping on an
empty chamber which precedes
dizziness and possible collapse.
After you have slowed down
gradually, it is important to
stretch once again for increased
flexibility and prevention of sore
ness.
Amenorrhea
There is an association be
tween high levels of exercise and
the cessation of menstruation.
Generally, only highly trained
athletes doing extremely intense
workouts consistently miss their
menstrual periods. However,
many women may stop
menstruating due to a strict diet
or exercise program where large
amounts of weight are lost. This is
due to the stress imposed on the
body in such a severe regimen.
While many women find it
desirable to lose their period, it
should be considered that there is
an association between amenor
rhea and an increased suscep
tibility to stress fractures. This is
thought to be due to the increased

risk of osteoporosis imposed by
changes in the hormones in the
abscence of menstruation. Os
teoporosis is a serious disease
whose symptoms can be des
cribed as soft or mushy bones, of
ten leading to a "hunchback"
syndrome in old age.
So again a moderate exercise
program will not induce the
shock to the system that precedes
amenorrhea, but will produce in
stead health benefits.
With these facts in mind, try to
pinpoint a goal for yourself on the
exercise continuum. Remember
that for the best health, a spot
right on the middle is optimal. In
reaching for that goal, it is impor
tant to start slow and stay
moderate to get the most out of
you exercise sessions.
Proper implementation of a
regular exercise program will
bring a reduced risk of heart
disease, maintained moderate
weight loss, strength, endurance,
prevention of bone and joint dis
orders. and. perhaps most impor
tant of all. an increased sense of
well-being, better sleep, less
stress, more energy, greater effi
ciency and improved vitality and
outlook on life.

On nearly every magazine
cover this spring, you will see
headlines on shaping up and
physical fitness. From a health
standpoint, this is a very favor
able craze. The health benefits of
exercise are numerous and very
desirable.

But can this passtime be taken
too far? As with most things, yes.
There are hazards with the ex
treme.
Consider yourself at some
point along an exercise con
tinuum according to your level of
activity. At both ends of this con
tinuum, you are likely to be in a
poorer state of health than if you
are in the middle. That is, too
little or too much exercise can be
bad for your health.
Not exercising can bring about

a greater risk of heart disease,
poor muscle tone and endurance,
hone and joint disorders, over
weight, and a generally diminised
sense of well-being or lack of
vitality. The minimum amount of
exercise necessary to provide a
substantial boost in fitness and,
therefore, health is the following
prescription: Twenty minutes of
aerobic exercise (e.g. walking,

jogging, cycling, swimming,
aerobic dance, etc.) every other
day.
Amounts of activity less than
this, such as a weekly intramural
game, do not bring a person to
the threshold of good health.
That is, to consider yourself in
shape, you must (at a minimum)
complete the above exercise
prescription on a regular basis.
The upper limit of the healthy
range cannot be defined with a
prescription. Different individ

uals seem to have different levels
of exercise at which one of the
following unhealthy symptoms
occurs: excessive weight loss, in
jury, amenorrhea or a breakdown
in relationships. Excessive weight
loss and amenorrhea result trom
exceedingly high levels of activity
for many people that, once
passed, injuries resulting from
overuse begin to occur. For best
health, it is clear that a gradually
developed, moderate exercise
program produces the maximum
in health benefits without the risk
of unhealthy symptoms.
