# The 						Slavery Of Thinness

How docs it happen?
At ages 1 t and 12, 28 per
cent of all girls are concerned
about how their bodies ap
pear. By ages 17 and IS, more
than 60 percent are preoc
cupied with thei physical ap
pearance.
It could be chalked up to the
body conciousness that
develops during adolescence,
but it also appears to be a
response to our society's pres
sure on women to acheive an
appearance that is long, lithe
and lean.
It you ask any 10 women
whether they are concerned
about being overwjeght or
whether any of thorn have
dieted, more than 80 percent
will reply in the affirmative. A
random sampling of Stanford
students reveals that about
one out of four Stanford wo
men resort to periodic fasting
in an attempt to achieve thin
ness.
It appears that virtually
nothing so fixes women in the
unseemly role of decorative
objects as the obsessive pur
suit of thinness. We are not
talking about women who suf
fer from anorexia nervosa, but
the women we all know —
roommates, friends, lovers,
wives, sisters and mothers. For
Western society, plumpness is
associated with slothiulness,
greed, weakness and other
nameless maladaptive traits.
The more affluent strive even
more for the lean and hungry
look.
Most recently, as the health
and fitness craze has swept the
country, we have increasingly
begun to see the equation of
fitness with thinness. Whereas
with men the goal has been to
obsessively build up muscle
bulk, for women fitness has
become an increased commit
ment to the pursuit of a few
more pounds of weight loss —
from a desire to look good, of
ten for others, to a desire to
fee! fit, where fit is defined as
thin.

Somehow, losing weigh!
becomes a way to deal with
feeling badly about oneself for
so many reasons. Changing
body shape toward one's
ideal may allow one to ignore
the need for internal changes
that may be necessary for true
contentment.
It is only necessary to eat
one meal in a residence hall to
appreciate the significance of
the movement toward fitness:
The overreliance on low-fat
yogurt, the women who disap
pear at the end of most meals
to purge themselves so as not
to gain an ounce, the binge
eating to make up for days of
starvation. Eating salads and
yogurt is no longer motivated
hy health hut by a desire for
thinness.
But all this should not be
construed as a diatribe
against fitness. Rather, it is a
plea for women to recognize
that a healthy lifestyle should
not turn one into a slave.
Choosing healthy foods does
not necessarily mean semi
starvation. and a healthy body
does not necessarily mean a
thin one.
It is important for every wo
man to examine her motiva
tions toward fitness and to ask
these questions:
• What does it mean to me to
be fit and healthy?
• Do 1 just want to be thin? If
so, why? What is really
wrong with my weight?
• Am I doing this to please
others?
• Do I believe my whole life
will change if 1 lose weight?
• What is my ideal of how I
should look? Is it realistic for
me?
To all of those who respond
angrily to the portrayal of wo
men in advertisements and the
media, it is important to begin
to examine not just the roles,
but also the physical appear
ance of those who portray Ms.
Average Consumer. Let us ac
cept the fact that women come
in all shapes and sizes § — all ol
which can be healthy and
beautiful. It is time to forego
the thin equals fit stereotype.
