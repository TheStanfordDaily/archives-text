# Overcoming Exercise Barriers
## 
### Lindy Birkel Fitness Project Manager Health Promotion Program 
While some of us have to worry
about going overboard with exer
eise, some of us never /ace that
problem simply because we never
hex in to exercise. The excuses tor
not exercising are many, but they
can be overcome.
Not Enough l ime To Exercise?
What you'll soon find out is
that exercise gi\es you more time
to do things. I low can this be?
What most exercisers find is
that regular exercise brings things
together tor them rather than
adding another burden to their
schedule. You can realize this
when you experience many of the
bonuses ot regular exercise.
Think about how nice it would be
to sleep better at night, have
more energy tor your busy
schedule, feel more energetic ;ind
efficient in what you do and expe
rience greater self confidence.
For two weeks try this. Set up
an exercise schedule that incor
porates exercise at least every
other day. Stick to it for two
weeks no matter how many other
things demand your attention.
You'll soon believe that there is
not enough time not to exercise!
Self-Conscious About Exercise?
You have lots of company.
Most people feel self-conscious
about exercise because they
either don't know how to do an
activity or don't like the way they
look.
For "don't know how." con
sider that your skill in an activity
is not as important as getting out
there and moving. You may want
to take ;i jogging, aerobic dance,
swimming, or tennis class. Or you
might want to simply put on some
music and hop around or take a
long brisk walk. The important
thing is to enjoy what you do.

Look around campus and notice
that a lot of students are out there
exercising without perfect form,
yet they arc enjoying it just the
same.
For "don't like how I look,"
the solution is finding a way to ex-

ercise which eventually improves
how you look. You may not want
to don a bathing suit at first, but
might not mind putting on a
sweatshirt for jogging or aerobic
dance.
Two weeks of exercising at
least every other day should be a
minimum for a trial period. Make
a commitment for only two
weeks. Make the situation com
fortable for you by exercising in
private, doing it with friends, or
off-campus. Chances are you'll

realize that exercise will increase
your sense of well-being and self
confidence.
Don't Like To Exercise?
If you hate to perspire, wear
shorts, or feel your heart and
lungs pounding, there are two

ways for you to get beyond this
barrier: Give exercise a fair
chance. Experiment.
I wo weeks of aerobic exercise
every other day is the minimum
for a trial period. After a couple
weeks you will begin to feel the
benefits exercisers talk about and
the factors about exercise you
don t like won't seem important
anymore. Give it that two week
trial period!
During this time, experiment
with what might make exercising

as fun as possible tor you. Some
ideas include getting together
with a friend, joining an aerobic
dance class one day and doing a
fast walk in a nice setting the
next, putting on music at home
and hopping around, using a
small radio to liven up a jog, etc.
The important thing is finding ac
tivities you enjoy and keeping
them up regularly.
Chances are that better sleep at
night, a sense of accomplishment,
increased energy and efficiency
for studying and improved muscle
tone will help you decide to stick
with it. You may even like it!
Don't Feel Motivated
To Exercise?
Can't seem to get moving when
it comes to exercise? The impor
tant steps to overcoming this bar
rier are preparing, experimenting,
and making a small commitment.
First, preparation. Make ex
ericising easier to do by planning
a time of day to exercise, prepar
ing equipment, adjusting your
schedule, etc.
Second, experimentation. Try
different types of exercise, differ
ent times of day or different situa
tions (alone, with a friend, in a
class) to make exercise enjoyable.
Find what suits you.
Third, a small commitment.
Make a contract with yourself to
exercise every other day for two
weeks. After exercising regularly
for two weeks you can judge whe
ther you are willing to make an
other commitment to exercise
regularly for a month. You can
decide whether or not to keep it
up. You may be surprised when
you find that exercise often gives
you a sense of motivation and
efficiency in other areas of your
life, raises your self-confidence
and well-being and contributes to
better sleep. It will become hard
to miss an exercise session.

Don't Feel Motivated
To Exercise?
Can't seem to get moving when
it comes to exercise? The impor
tant steps to overcoming this bar
rier are preparing, experimenting,
and making a small commitment.
First, preparation. Make ex
ericising easier to do by planning
a time of day to exercise, prepar
ing equipment, adjusting your
schedule, etc.
Second, experimentation. Try
different types of exercise, differ
ent times of day or different situa
tions (alone, with a friend, in a
class) to make exercise enjoyable.
Find what suits you.
Third, a small commitment.
Make a contract with yourself to
exercise every other day for two
weeks. After exercising regularly
for two weeks you can judge whe
ther you are willing to make an
other commitment to exercise
regularly for a month. You can
decide whether or not to keep it
up. You may be surprised when
you find that exercise often gives
you a sense of motivation and
efficiency in other areas of your
life, raises your self-confidence
and well-being and contributes to
better sleep. It will become hard
to miss an exercise session.
