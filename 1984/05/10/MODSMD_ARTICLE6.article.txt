# Health Tips for Surviving Summer Travel
## 
### 
For many of us, summer means
travel. And whether it's to the
beaches of Mazatlan or the
museums of Paris, summer travel
is right around the corner. You
can make your trip more enjoy
able and safer by observing a few
important rules about sun, jet lag,
time changes, diarrhea and im
munizations.
Sunburn:
Prevention is the best medicine
Dermatologists continually
remind us that sun is bad for the
skin, but a sunny day on the
beach is hard to resist. Exposure
to the sun accelerates the aging
process and increases chances of
skin cancer. Advertisements,
however, continually extoll the
virtues of a suntan, and as a na
tion we spend much of our youth
aiming for the perfect tan, with
out regard for the eventual conse
quences of solar radiation.
But there are things you can do
to tan safely.
Limit your heavy-duty tanning
to 15 minutes the first day out,
and increase your tan time by five
minutes each day until you have a
good base tan. If you are moving
around outdoors, longer time pe
riods are safe.
Sun screen agents allow
gradual tanning but prevent bur
ning. Partial blocking of the sun's
rays is afforded by Block-Out and
Paba-Film, while Pabanol and
Pre-Sun block out virtually all
rays. Suntan lotions which are not
sunscreen agents block relatively
little solar radiation.
Clothing is a good way to beat
the sun: cool, loose fitting beach
robes, long-sleeve shirts and
wide-brimmed hats.
Don't be fooled by the safety of
umbrellas, wet t-shirts, cloudy
days or water. Ultraviolet rays
reflect off the ground, limiting the
protection provided by an
umbrella, and penetrate clouds,
wet t-shirts and water.
Jet Lag:
It's the water — and a lot more
The loss of water an individual
experiences on long airplane

flights contributes to jet lag. You
can lose over a quart of body
water on as little as a three-and
a-half hour flight. This is due to
the dry air and the rapid circula
tion of air for ventilation on the
airplane.
It is important to drink a lot of
water or fruit juices before,
during and after any flight. Caf
feine and alcohol, the standbys of
airline travel, are dehydrating
beverages and should be avoided.
Time Change:
Resetting the biological clock
Time change is also a contribu
ting factor for the weariness
sometimes associated with travel.

If the time change is only a few
hours and you plan to stay only a
few days, you can keep your
eating and sleeping habits the
same as at home to diminish the
effect of travel when you return.
But if you are staying longer in a
new time zone, you should try to
reset your biological clock to the
time of your destination. A few
days before you travel, gradually
begin to modify your eating and
sleeping patterns so you will be
on the pattern of the new time
zone when you arrive.
Traveler's Diarrhea:
How to beat Montezuma
Most cases of traveler's diar
rhea are probably caused by

"enteropathogenic E coli." The
most important aspect of preven
tion is to remember that the diar
rhea occcurs mostly from "fecal
oral" transmission; contaminated
water, or inadequate cleaning of
hands or food. In the Peace
Corps, volunteers are told to
"boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget
it." Fresh salads and ice (unless
made from bottled water) should
be passed over. Cooked food
should be eaten while still hot,
before bacteria can get re
established. Bottled drinks are
ok.
If. despite taking precautions,
you still get diarrhea, Pepto-

Bismol is an inexpensive over
the-counter preparation that is
effective for treatment. Please re
member if diarrhea becomes se
vere or is associated with bleeding
or high fever, it should be treated
medically. Occasionally a doctor
will prescribe certain antibiotics
for prevention, but not all or
ganisms which cause diarrhea
respond to antibiotics.
Immunizations:
Shooting for safety
If your itinerary includes
countries in Latin America,
Asia, the Middle East, the South
Pacific or Africa, you will prob
ably find yourself in countries
where standards of sanitation
vary considerably. In tourist
areas, your risk of exposure to
food or water of questionable
quality may be small, but if you
plan to be more adventurous in
the food you eat, have close con
tact with the native population, or
generally go off the beaten track,
you may be at a risk of acquiring
infectious diseases such as viral
hepatits, typhoid fever, tuber
culosis and polio. Malaria is a
serous problem and even in
tourist areas in developing
countries you could be bitten by
a malarious mosquito.
For travel in most developed
countries, the risk to the health of
the traveler is no greater than that
incurred while traveling in the
United States. The coutries of
Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and the continent of Europe are
in this category. For their
countries, you only need to check
whether you have had a Tetanus
booster within the past 10 years.
The Immunization nurse at
Cowell has information on vacci
nations which may be recom
mended, as well as those which
are required, for your particular
trip.
Some immunizations are given
in a series a month apart, and
some need to be spaced apart be
cause of possible interactions, so
be sure to call or come in as soon
as you know your general in
tinerary.

will prescribe certain antibiotics
for prevention, but not all or
ganisms which cause diarrhea
respond to antibiotics.
Immunizations:
Shooting for safety
If your itinerary includes
countries in Latin America,
Asia, the Middle East, the South
Pacific or Africa, you will prob
ably find yourself in countries
where standards of sanitation
vary considerably. In tourist
areas, your risk of exposure to
food or water of questionable
quality may be small, but if you
plan to be more adventurous in
the food you eat, have close con
tact with the native population, or
generally go off the beaten track,
you may be at a risk of acquiring
infectious diseases such as viral
hepatits, typhoid fever, tuber
culosis and polio. Malaria is a
serous problem and even in
tourist areas in developing
countries you could be bitten by
a malarious mosquito.
For travel in most developed
countries, the risk to the health of
the traveler is no greater than that
incurred while traveling in the
United States. The coutries of
Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and the continent of Europe are
in this category. For their
countries, you only need to check
whether you have had a Tetanus
booster within the past 10 years.
The Immunization nurse at
Cowell has information on vacci
nations which may be recom
mended, as well as those which
are required, for your particular
trip.
Some immunizations are given
in a series a month apart, and
some need to be spaced apart be

be sure to call or come in as soon
as you know your general in
tinerary.

For many of us, summer means
travel. And whether it's to the
beaches of Mazatlan or the
museums of Paris, summer travel
is right around the corner. You
can make your trip more enjoy
able and safer by observing a few
important rules about sun, jet lag,
time changes, diarrhea and im
munizations.
Sunburn:
Prevention is the best medicine
Dermatologists continually
remind us that sun is bad for the
skin, but a sunny day on the
beach is hard to resist. Exposure
to the sun accelerates the aging
process and increases chances of
skin cancer. Advertisements,
however, continually extoll the
virtues of a suntan, and as a na
tion we spend much of our youth
aiming for the perfect tan, with
out regard for the eventual conse
quences of solar radiation.
But there are things you can do
to tan safely.
Limit your heavy-duty tanning
to 15 minutes the first day out,
and increase your tan time by five
minutes each day until you have a
good base tan. If you are moving
around outdoors, longer time pe
riods are safe.
Sun screen agents allow
gradual tanning but prevent bur
ning. Partial blocking of the sun's
rays is afforded by Block-Out and
Paba-Film, while Pabanol and
Pre-Sun block out virtually all
rays. Suntan lotions which are not
sunscreen agents block relatively
little solar radiation.
Clothing is a good way to beat
the sun: cool, loose fitting beach
robes, long-sleeve shirts and
wide-brimmed hats.
Don't be fooled by the safety of
umbrellas, wet t-shirts, cloudy
days or water. Ultraviolet rays
reflect off the ground, limiting the
protection provided by an
umbrella, and penetrate clouds,
wet t-shirts and water.
Jet Lag:
It's the water — and a lot more
The loss of water an individual
experiences on long airplane

flights contributes to jet lag. You
can lose over a quart of body
water on as little as a three-and
a-half hour flight. This is due to
the dry air and the rapid circula
tion of air for ventilation on the
airplane.
It is important to drink a lot of
water or fruit juices before,
during and after any flight. Caf
feine and alcohol, the standbys of
airline travel, are dehydrating
beverages and should be avoided.
Time Change:
Resetting the biological clock
Time change is also a contribu
ting factor for the weariness
sometimes associated with travel.

If the time change is only a few
hours and you plan to stay only a
few days, you can keep your
eating and sleeping habits the
same as at home to diminish the
effect of travel when you return.
But if you are staying longer in a
new time zone, you should try to
reset your biological clock to the
time of your destination. A few
days before you travel, gradually
begin to modify your eating and
sleeping patterns so you will be
on the pattern of the new time
zone when you arrive.
Traveler's Diarrhea:
How to beat Montezuma
Most cases of traveler's diar
rhea are probably caused by

"enteropathogenic E coli." The
most important aspect of preven
tion is to remember that the diar
rhea occcurs mostly from "fecal
oral" transmission; contaminated
water, or inadequate cleaning of
hands or food. In the Peace
Corps, volunteers are told to
"boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget
it." Fresh salads and ice (unless
made from bottled water) should
be passed over. Cooked food
should be eaten while still hot,
before bacteria can get re
established. Bottled drinks are
ok.
If. despite taking precautions,
you still get diarrhea, Pepto-

Bismol is an inexpensive over
the-counter preparation that is
effective for treatment. Please re
member if diarrhea becomes se
vere or is associated with bleeding
or high fever, it should be treated
medically. Occasionally a doctor
will prescribe certain antibiotics
for prevention, but not all or
ganisms which cause diarrhea
respond to antibiotics.
