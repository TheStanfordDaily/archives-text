his plans have not changed. Until
the June 2 deadline "tor teams to
declare their intention of par

everyone can change their mind,'
he said.
"We're continuing to plan as
though all who qualified will he
participating," Boesch added.
In the event that all the qualify
ing nations do not attend, the
Federacion Internationale de Foot
hall Association (FIFA) is respon

"We are just the host. The tourna
ment is conducted under FIFA's

peted.
