# Mondale campaign predicts nomination
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Washington â€” Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart said Wednesday that his upset vic
tories in Ohio and Indiana guarantee
that the Democratic presidential nomin
ation will not be decided until the July
convention, but Walter Mondale's cam
paign manager predicted that the former
vice president will have it locked up next
month.
Mondale took the day off in Washing
ton, while Hart prepared for a westerji
campaign swing. The Rev. Jesse Jackson
spoke to newspaper editors in Washing
ton and exhorted them to cover his cam
paign fairly.
And Ed Rollins, chairman of Ronald
Reagan's re-election campaign, said the

president a/ready had garnered enough
delegates to guarantee him the Republi
can nomination.
At a news conference, James Johnson,
Mondale's campaign director, said that
even if Hart continues winning prima
ries. his candidate will increase his dele
gate count so steadily that he will have a
majority of delegates before the conven
tion.
On the day before the final round of
primaries on June 5, Johnson said
Mondale will have between 1750 and
1800 delegates.
Alter the primaries in California and
New Jersey, Johnson said, "We are . . .
.prepared to predict that when we have

all the the results in from June 5, we will
have more than the 1967 delegates that
are necessary for the nomination."
Hart's campaign manager, Oliver
Henkel, disputed Johnson's estimates,
saying his computerized projection show
that by the end of the primary season
Mondale would have 1650 delegates to
1450 for Hart.
After Tuesday's primaries, Mondale
had 1450.05 delegates to 873.75 for
Hart and 279.2 for Jackson. The totals
do not include Saturday's Texas
caucuses, in which Mondale is expected
to get at least 100 of the 169 delegates
that were at stake.
Hart reiterated that a key element to
his strategy of closing the delegate gap

with Mandate is to persuade uneoiff
mittcd and unpledged delegates to switch
to him during the period between the
final primary and the start of the
nominating convention July 16.
In comparison with the early rush ot
primaries, Henkel said, both the cam
paign and Mart had more time to push
his candidacy of new ideas and a new
generation of politics.
As both camps assessed the meaning
of Hart's victories in Ohio and Indiana,
and Mondale counted his mounting dele
gate total, including wins in Maryland
and North Carolina, the Rev. Jesse Jack
son faulted news organizations for tailing
to publish stories about minorities.
