## The 						Stanford Daily Play Games, not politics

As the Olympics draw nearer, it is becoming in
creasingly clear that an event that started as a
celebration of the spirit of international athletic
competition is becoming nothing more than a
base competition between propagandists.
The world's greatest athletes come together
every four years to challenge themselves and their
rivals head-on in hopes of being recognized as
"the best there is." This is the essence of the
Olympic Games.
Increasingly, however, this spirit of competition
on the athletic field has been circumvented by
competition in the political arena. Tuesday's deci
sion by the Soviet Union to lead its allies in a
boycott of the 19H4 Games in Los Angeles is surely
a response to the Carter administration's decision
to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan b\
boycotting the 1980 Games in Moscow.
The Olympics are an opportunity for the best
athletes in the world to compete against each other.
Nothing more, nothing less. Or at least they
shouldn't be.
The Soviets' decision to boycott the Games is
part of another, larger politicization of the Olym
pics, which should be changed. In recent years the
United States has been unable to send "the best"
it has. The reason — many of this country's best
athletes are professionals.
Our best basketball players, for instance, play
in the National Basketball Association where
they often receive large salaries. They are not eli
gible to compete in the Olympics because only
athletes who are considered amateurs — those
not receiving financial rewards from their event
or sport — may participate in the Games.

The Soviet Union and Hast bloc countries do
not face this problem. Their best athletes remain
amateurs, despite being paid huge salaries by the
state. The Soviets and the I astern Europeans use
their athletes as propaganda tools, trumpeting the
superiority of their state systems, and making sure
that the athletes are not diverted from their main
task — becoming good athletes. Sports are these
athletes' jobs, just as basketball is the job of an
NBA player.
In the United States, however, there are a ple
thora of truly amateur athletes who get little or no
financial support to compete in their sports. But
there is also an increasing number ot amateurs
who follow the Soviet model: They arc
"amateur" in the sense that they get paid high
salaries under the table. Every football tan knows
that Renaldo Nehemiah was paid more than
$100,000 a year as a hurdler before he became a
wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers, and
every track fan knows that Mary Decker and Al
berto Salazar are living quite comlortably.
But what about Magic Johnson and Kareem
Abdul Jabaar? How about Brian Oldfield, who
threw 75 feet in the shot put, tar and away the
best ever, when he was part of the now-defunct
professional track circuit? Oldfield. Jabaar and
Johnson are all banned from the Olympics be
cause they're professionals.
The depoliticization of the Olympics, then, in
volves a few steps. All countries must agree not to
use the Games as a political event. And the
Olympic committee must begin to reconsider its
hypocritical and anachronistic policy which
doesn't allow for "professionals" to compete.
