# Smile: It makes a difference
## 
### 
A short plea instead of a long
message:
Have you ever thought of the
misery that everyday rudeness causes?
Have you ever really thought about
the sour feeling you receive when
someone slights you without cause?
Well, if you haven't, believe me:
Rudeness causes pain. Just for a min
ute. let's forget the Reaganomic
nightmares, the political misuse of the
Olympic Games and the ever-present
threat of nuclear annihilation. I want
to discuss discourtesy and its sense
lessness.
All of us have come into contact
with individuals who care nothing
about and show no concern for any
thing or anyone except themselves.
Always, there is the tactless recep
tionist or the obnoxious person sitting
next to you in class who has the power
to send the cheeriest of people into

rotten moods.
Why do secretaries or cashiers bark
the answers to you when you ask a
question? Thcv probably snarl be
cause someone else snapped a ques
tion at them, first. Rudeness breeds
rudeness because, too often, we do not
take time to think before we speak or
act. Too many of us usually forget to
say the kind words that would soothe,
yet too many remember the thought
less words which sting.
But just who are these inconsiderate
people? Who are the really rude"!
Some of them are:
• The people who eternally find it nec
essary to walk directly in front of the
performer at concerts;
• Those who take their problems out
on the people in public service jobs;
• Drivers and bikers who insist upon
darting in front of you, causing
wrecks;

• People who ride their bikes and aim
at the little squirrels crossing their
path;
• And of course the obvious: those
who blunder about without ever
thinking about saying "please,"
"thanks" or "excuse me."
1 am only advocating what others
have stressed for centuries: Think
before you act and be as kind as possi
ble to the people and animals around
you. Think about how great it feels
when someone is courteous to you.
Think about how little effort goes into
being kind. It costs nothing to be nice
or to smile, yet a smile or a friendly
word can mean so much to the people
around you.
So go on: Smile. Be kind. And en
joy the weekend — please.
