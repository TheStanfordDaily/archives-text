## Hoover question deserves input of faculty, students 
### 
There seems to me to be two issues
that separate us.
We believe that there is a good deal
of evidence that raises serious ques
tion about certain activities of the
Hoover Institution, and there seem to

VIEWPOINT

be a lair number of people on this
campus who think so too.
Just over 100 faculty have signed a
petition calling for the appointment of
an independent visiting committee to
inquire into relations between Stan
ford and Hoover to "ensure and
protect the University's reputation for
political neutrality and indepen
dence."
So one question is: Will you give us
a visiting committee on Hoover or will
you continue to try to handle it in
house?
T he second and related question is:
Will you allow these questions about
Hoover to be discussed in an open,
public forum by having University
President Donald Kennedy or some
other high official meet us in public
discourse?
Here I must say that I find it almost
unbelievable that in a university vou

would deny a request to discuss such
important issues publicly.
Open discussion is what a university
is supposed to be all about.
When large numbers of responsible
faculty and students ask for a chance
to he heard publicly before those in
positions of power on an issue of vital
importance to the University, how can
you justify saying "no"?
In response, you say the issue is one
of "governance," not "politics."
We say — and we present a great
deal of evidence from Hoover's own
materials - that the issue is one of po
litical activities by the Hoover Institu
tion. and of the danger of such activi
ties to the University.
With the issue now so clearly
defined, why not meet to discuss it in
an open public forum?
Finally, I want to comment on Ken
nedy's May 3 statement to the editors
of The Stanford Daily.
President Kennedy is quoted as
saying that he would not encourage an
open torum because some problems
are not best served by debate "in front
of large audiences" (Daily, May 4).
The question this raises is which is
sues can be discussed in front of large
audiences in a university, and which
cannot?

And. crucially, who decides?
II those in positions of power decide
not even to discuss issues publich.
they may get their way. There will tie
no debate.
But it that happens, what kind of
university are we. and what are the
costs to our commitment to open dis
course and democratic participation?
As you consider our request for a
visiting committee and a more open
process of decision-making, I ask you
respectfully — and on behall of those
who have i signed the petition and ex
pressed their concerns — to open the
problem ot Hoover to public view so
that those who want to speak, tin both
sides of the issue, may do so freely,
publicly and responsibly.
II you do this. 10 years from now,
we may all look back on the great
debate over Hoover with pride. II you
fail to do this, many of us will look
back and feel shame. The choice is
yours. We anxiously wait and hope
that you make the correct one.

presented this statement to the Trustee
Committee on the Hoover Institition on
Tuesday.)
