## Frats do foster 'frat' attitudes 
### 
Those people who defend frat subjectivity by facetiously
proposing that University admissions, job offers and class
grading should be random missed the point of the original
Daily editorial: subjectivity by fraternities in the choice of
their new members isn't necessary for the fraternities and
that it is harm!ul to the fraternities and their members.
That this subjectivity isn't necessary can be seen in the
case of other houses — houses that run their own kitchens,
elect their own officers and do a whole lot more in terms of
residential education than the frats. They even throw par-

just as much as the Irats do, yet they do fine without
choosing their own members. They miss out on some of
the people they d like to have in their house, but the
people they do get lead the house in new. unexpected di
rections.
This subjectivity is harmful to the University as a whole.
It is degradmg to those turned down, yes; it is also harmful
to other houses it the (rats succeed in recruiting the most

trived, furthermore. to have Greeks housed in some of the
nicest houses on campus while other people live in dorms.

risks a harmful Greek/non-Greek split among students, es
pecially if Greek groups grow.
The subjective selection system does not lead to a good
mix of people in frats. I rats choose new members they
think they'll get along with best, usually those most like
themselves. By doing so frat members miss out on some ol
the diversity found in other houses, where dilterent people
expose each other to new ideas. F rats are more com
fortable for the members, but at the expense ol missing out
on opportunities for learning. Similarly. Stanford without
papers or exams would also be more comfortable but less
rewarding.
On occasion the mix in ;i frat becomes destructive, when
a frat reaches a critical mass of boys with tendencies to be
havioral problems who attract and choose similar boys and
reinforce each other's behavior. (I'm thinking ot the Zetes
and of a fraternity that is still housed on campus that ad
vertises for new members by boasting that its members
drive drunk.)
Finally, having its new members chosen selectively by
old members affects the social dynamics of the trat. both
within the fraternity and in its view toward .others outside
the fraternity. There is a bad side to fraternal comraderie
— in the fraternity I was in, it was based partly on disdain
for and derision of those outside, the "we're better' prin
ciple. as well as being substantially based on sexism.
