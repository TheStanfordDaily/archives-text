# Decision dampens swimmers' spirits

### JASON COLE Daily staff 
With wire reports
Stanford athletes and coaches were not surprised
yesterday by East Germany's decision to join the Soviet
Union and Bulgaria in pulling their athletes out of the
l.os Angeles Olympics, giv ing the United States an un
disputed but gloomy dominance in the diminished
Games.
The head of the International Olympic Committee
still planned to go to Moscow to try to persuade the
Soviets to send its teams to the I ( ->K4 Games, and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson went to the Soviet Embassy in
Washington to appeal to the ambassador.
But American officials said they now expect most of
the Warsaw Pact nations to turn their backs on the the
July 2N-Aug. 12 Olympics in l.os Angeles.
I he East German defection, which came despite the
arrival in East Germany of a delegation selected by the
l.os Angeles Olympics Organizing Committee, would
deprive the Games of some of the world's finest female
swimmers, track and field competitors, and rowers.

But the pullout came as no surprise to Stanford
coaches and Olympic hopefuls. As Stanford and Olym
pic Women's Swimming Coach George Haines said
simply. "I expected it."
Expectations or not, the announcement came as a
great disappointment to many athletes, especially Stan
ford swimmer Marybeth Linzmeier. "It's really just ter
rible. The East German women are really our biggest
competition," she said.
"It just really puts a damper on the whole Olympics.
I mean, anyone who wins a medal at these Games will
always be reminded that some of the toughest competi
tion wasn't there," Linzmeier said.
Haines disagreed with Linzmeier on that point,
saying, "Nobody's put an asterisk by the l 980 medal
winners because we weren't there. Some of the vic
tories were really hollow, but none of them were
'tainted.' Four years from now nobody's going to care
or remember who was there."
But the absence of the East German women may
hurt U.S. swimming because of
the letdown from lack of com
petition. "The East German
(women) were favored to win
most of the gold medals. They
would have come out here and
really kicked our tails," said
Skip kenney. Stanford men's
swimming coach and potential
Olympic coach.
"It would have shown how far
ahead of us they are and prob
ably would have spurred on our
program. It would have made
women's swimming better in
this countryKenney said.
Haines indicated that he
thought the effort of making the
U.S. Olympic team would be
enough to make the women
work hard. "Just making the
U.S. team is so tough that I
don't think anybody going to
let down ... It's tougher to
make the team than it is to make
the finals of the Olympics."
Linzmeier concurred. "Just

making the Olympic team is mv
main goal right now. It will be
all the easier to get a medal, but
you've got to get there lirst."
Speculation as to why the
communist countries are
boycotting continued. "The
Hast Germans aren't going he
cause the Soviets told them not
to. I think it's revenge. The
Soviets have known all along
that they weren't going to
come."
Haines also noted the Ameri
can boycott of the Olym
pics. "It you want to find a rea
son why they're not coming, iiist
ask Jimmy Carter." he said.
But Linzmeier said the
Soviets may be trying to gain a
bargaining chip with the United
States by trying to "bring us to
our knees" in hopes of getting
more response to their
demands. The Soviets have until
June 2 to make their final deci
sion on whether they're compet
ing or not.
Kenney and freshman Olym
pic hopeful Jeff Kostoff said the
Hast Germans mav be afraid of

what the increased drug testing
at this year's Games might
reveal.
"I don't want it to sound like
sour grapes, but I'm not sure
whethei or not they're just
avoiding a possible scandal.
Kenney said.
Kostofl was much more
blunt: "It's obvious that the
Hast German women are on
steroids. It's another reason that
it's not to their advantage to
come."
Revenge, bargaining and
steroids aside. Stanford coaches
and athletes agreed that the
Games would still he popular
thisvear Hie main worry seems
to he what the effects til this
boycott might have on the
Oh mpics in the future.
Haines predietred that this
boycott could lead to the "end
of the modern Olympics." He
explained that "the Games have
become so politicized that I
don't think there's any thing that
can he done. When half of the
most competitive teams in the
world don't show up. it doesn't

mean much."
The Soviets, the East Ger
mans and the Bulgarians, in that
order, were the top three medal
winners in the I C >N() Summer
Games in Moscow, boycotted
In the United States and many
other nations in response to the

Olympic swimming Coach George Haines believes that the
communist boycott of the Los Angeles Games may end the
event altogether.
With wire reports
Stanford athletes and coaches were not surprised
yesterday by East Germany's decision to join the Soviet
Union and Bulgaria in pulling their athletes out of the
l.os Angeles Olympics, giv ing the United States an un
disputed but gloomy dominance in the diminished
Games.
The head of the International Olympic Committee
still planned to go to Moscow to try to persuade the
Soviets to send its teams to the I ( ->K4 Games, and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson went to the Soviet Embassy in
Washington to appeal to the ambassador.
But American officials said they now expect most of
the Warsaw Pact nations to turn their backs on the the
July 2N-Aug. 12 Olympics in l.os Angeles.
I he East German defection, which came despite the
arrival in East Germany of a delegation selected by the
l.os Angeles Olympics Organizing Committee, would
deprive the Games of some of the world's finest female
swimmers, track and field competitors, and rowers.

But the pullout came as no surprise to Stanford
coaches and Olympic hopefuls. As Stanford and Olym
pic Women's Swimming Coach George Haines said
simply. "I expected it."
Expectations or not, the announcement came as a
great disappointment to many athletes, especially Stan
ford swimmer Marybeth Linzmeier. "It's really just ter
rible. The East German women are really our biggest
competition," she said.
"It just really puts a damper on the whole Olympics.
I mean, anyone who wins a medal at these Games will
always be reminded that some of the toughest competi
tion wasn't there," Linzmeier said.
Haines disagreed with Linzmeier on that point,
saying, "Nobody's put an asterisk by the l 980 medal
winners because we weren't there. Some of the vic
tories were really hollow, but none of them were
'tainted.' Four years from now nobody's going to care
or remember who was there."
But the absence of the East German women may
hurt U.S. swimming because of
the letdown from lack of com
petition. "The East German
(women) were favored to win
most of the gold medals. They
would have come out here and
really kicked our tails," said
Skip kenney. Stanford men's
swimming coach and potential
Olympic coach.
"It would have shown how far
ahead of us they are and prob
ably would have spurred on our
program. It would have made
women's swimming better in
this countryKenney said.
Haines indicated that he
thought the effort of making the
U.S. Olympic team would be
enough to make the women
work hard. "Just making the
U.S. team is so tough that I
don't think anybody going to
let down ... It's tougher to
make the team than it is to make
the finals of the Olympics."
Linzmeier concurred. "Just

making the Olympic team is mv
main goal right now. It will be
all the easier to get a medal, but
you've got to get there lirst."
Speculation as to why the
communist countries are
boycotting continued. "The
Hast Germans aren't going he
cause the Soviets told them not
to. I think it's revenge. The
Soviets have known all along
that they weren't going to
come."
Haines also noted the Ameri
can boycott of the Olym
pics. "It you want to find a rea
son why they're not coming, iiist
ask Jimmy Carter." he said.
But Linzmeier said the
Soviets may be trying to gain a
bargaining chip with the United
States by trying to "bring us to
our knees" in hopes of getting
more response to their
demands. The Soviets have until
June 2 to make their final deci
sion on whether they're compet
ing or not.
Kenney and freshman Olym
pic hopeful Jeff Kostoff said the
Hast Germans mav be afraid of

what the increased drug testing
at this year's Games might
reveal.
"I don't want it to sound like
sour grapes, but I'm not sure
whethei or not they're just
avoiding a possible scandal.
Kenney said.
Kostofl was much more
blunt: "It's obvious that the
Hast German women are on
steroids. It's another reason that
it's not to their advantage to
come."
Revenge, bargaining and
steroids aside. Stanford coaches
and athletes agreed that the
Games would still he popular
