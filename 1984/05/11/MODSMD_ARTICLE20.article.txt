## University wrongly attempting to break union 
### 
I have been employed as a com
puter operator for the past four years.
I have never felt unions had generally
outlived their usefulness. Stanford's
recent actions (instigated. I suspect,
by Priscilla Wheeler) have certainly
changed my views.
I have been supporting myself since
I was 16 and have never seen an
employer continually demonstrate
such disdain, arrogance and an
tagonism toward employees. Under
Wheeler's guidance, Stanford seems
determined to create a work staff
bound together by hate rather than a
union.
Elections are demanded, then the
results are ignored. National Labor
Relations Board decisions are sought,
and before they are even rendered
Stanford declares it intends to appeal
the decision. Union dues are taken
from us for four months before we
are even informed that the dues are
being banked in a Stanford account
and not being forwarded to the union.
Stanford says it can't forward
money to a union that doesn't repre
sent us. yet it is the only party that
has refused to recognize the union.
Now the University says it's going to
return the money to us as being the
only fair thing to do. A number of
people will naturally spend the
returned money, thus depriving the
union of money needed to support its
operations. This accomplishes Stan-

ford's true purpose while it appears
only to be doing what is right.
If doing what was right was ever a
concern of Stanford this problem
would not exist in the first place.
The union is made up of Stanford
"service" employees. Has it ever
occurred to the administration that
this service is eroded by its actions?
Doing that little bit extra to make
things easier for the users of these
services is forgotten when the em- •
plover is doing everything possible to
make things harder for its employees.
Working at Stanford has many attrac
tions. but being treated with rcspect
by the employer is definitely not on
the list.
I predict our union dues will be
returned without the interest gained
while sitting in a Stanford account,
thus forcing each individual employee
to take Stanford to a small claims
court.

I write to state my strong disagree
ment to University President Donald
Kennedy's stance against the Stanford
bargaining unit's change in status. His
recent memo seemed patronizing in
tone, inaccurate in representation of
fact and negative in effect on morale
In my understanding, tlv: h;in<re in

status was not only approved by the
Service Employees International
Union headquarters, but handled
according to its own bylaws.
Whereas the National Labor Rela
tions Board (NLRB) did not run the
election, the equally law-abiding and
sanctioned American Arbitration
Association did assure legality, equity
and fairness.
Kennedy's representation of the
matter brings me to my second point.
By the condescending tone of his
memo, he set himself up as the law
abiding party trying to operate fairly
and equitably against a group that
seeks to evade due process.
That Kennedy finds the bargaining
unit difficult or disagreeable to work
with is unfortunate. The point of the
matter is that a legally binding con
tract is in force, and it has the ap
proval of the NLRB. Not to honor
the agreement can only have a detri
mental effect on the morale of all the
workers at Stanford.
This statement brings me to my
final point. I do not understand how
Kennedy , as academic head of one of
the nation's truly great universities,
can aspire to instill respect for our
societal institutions when he shows no
faith in them in practice. To suggest
that NI.RB rulings do not applv in
this particular cvse. because of this
instance xception, is the kind
of •' 'n d! the

sense of elitism on the part of Stan
ford students. 1 find this attitude
inconsistent with out democratic
heritage as a nation of laws.

The Daily's relentless assault on
individual human rights grows more
intolerable. In advocating the elimi
nation of fraternities, the editor
ial (Daily, May 9) seeks to repress our
basic freedoms of choice and associa
tion. Why not also eliminate the
opportunity of drawing together,
which clearly exhibits "self
selection."
And to suggest the University is
not guilty of "self-selection" or dis
crimination on the basis of social
qualifications is an outright lie. Given
the enormous surplus of applicants
who more than qualify academically,
it is precisely their other individual
qualities, both social and human,
which make the crucial difference in
their admission.
I would suggest The Daily recog
nize the strength of Stanford's liberal
education is developing individual
responsibility, and not promoting
institutional bigot-;,.

matter is that a legally binding con
tract is in force, and it has the ap
proval of the NLRB. Not to honor
the agreement can only have a detri
mental effect on the morale of all the
workers at Stanford.
This statement brings me to my
final point. I do not understand how
Kennedy , as academic head of one of
the nation's truly great universities,
can aspire to instill respect for our
societal institutions when he shows no
faith in them in practice. To suggest
that NI.RB rulings do not applv in
this particular cvse. because of this
instance xception, is the kind
of •' 'n d! the

sense of elitism on the part of Stan
ford students. 1 find this attitude
inconsistent with out democratic
heritage as a nation of laws.

The Daily's relentless assault on
individual human rights grows more
intolerable. In advocating the elimi
nation of fraternities, the editor
ial (Daily, May 9) seeks to repress our
basic freedoms of choice and associa
tion. Why not also eliminate the
opportunity of drawing together,
which clearly exhibits "self
selection."
And to suggest the University is
not guilty of "self-selection" or dis
crimination on the basis of social
qualifications is an outright lie. Given
the enormous surplus of applicants
who more than qualify academically,
it is precisely their other individual
qualities, both social and human,
which make the crucial difference in
their admission.
I would suggest The Daily recog
nize the strength of Stanford's liberal
education is developing individual
responsibility, and not promoting
institutional bigot-;,.
