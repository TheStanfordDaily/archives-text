# A 						ferry ride, an Angel Island and a good restaurant
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
As the early morning sun
sparkles on the hay in San Fran
cisco, the ferries begin opera
tion. Leaving seven days a week
from the Ferry Building at the
foot of Market Street, and in ad
dition, on weekends from Pier
43'/2 a» Fisherman's Wharf, the
terries provide daily commuter
service from San Francisco to
Sausalito, Tiburon, Larkspur
and Angel Island.
Throughout the day, they
cross hack and lorth. Once on
board, the fresh sea breeze will
assail your senses. The screech
of hovering seagulls replaces the
noise of the city as you begin
your journey. The picturesque
crossings take from 30 to 50
minutes, depending on ur
destination. Hopefulh II
take the ferry on a clear, n
day. It the tog should i>'il in,
your view will be nited. hut
seats inside as well as out insure
that you won't freeze if the wind
is strong.
On a clear day, you'll have a
close-up view of Alcatraz,
seagulls, fishermen, freighters,
pleasure boats and an oc
casional sea lion, i! you're lucky.
Snacks as well as drinks (both
alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are
sold on board.
What to do once you arrive
depends, of course, on where
you're going. II you want to
spend the day hiking in nature.
Angel Island may he the perfect
destination. The island is closed
to motorized vehicles and what
may surprise you more ... it has
no inhabitants, beyond an oc
casional park ranger and
numerous deer. Bring a picnic
lunch along, since you won't
find restaurants there either.
I or a truly unique experience,
cruise on the terry to Sausalito
and stay overnight on a
houseboat or pleasure boat.
Your accommodations will be
nothing short of luxurious. One
houseboat, featured in Archi
tecture magazine, includes a
sauna, hot tub and sundeck.
Whether you choose to stay on a
yacht or houseboat, you'll
usually be left in complete
privacy. Hosts will make you
comfortable, explain the in

tricacies of staying on a boat —
you must know how to pump
the toilet — and show you
where they left breakfast. Then
they'll disappear.
To arrange for bed and
breakfast on the water, write or
call Bed and Breakfast Interna
tional at 151 Ardmore Road,
Kensington, 1 M707. The phone
number is (415) An
other company is the American
Family Inn. P.O. Box 349, San
Francisco. 94101 at (415) 931-
3083.
If you prefer to keep your feet

on dry land, both companies
also offer accommodations in
beautiful houses — or even
mansions — on the hillside.
You'll find few comparable
views, and your hosts, now pres
ent, will be friendly and in
formative. They will help you
discover and enjoy the area.
The American Family Inn also
charters sail boats if you want to
be adventurous and leave the
dock behind you and test your
seaworthiness.
Next on the agenda is finding
a place to eat. At the foot of

Harbor Drive, near the Bay
Model, is the Sausalito Food
Co. The restaurant serves
breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The exterior resembles a yacht
club, but once past the bar, the
atmosphere changes and you're
in a garden room with large
standing and hanging plants.
Breakfasts and lunches are
casual; for dinner tablecloths
and the trimmings are added.
Besides daily specials, the menu
includes house specialties:
steamed clams, linguini and
clams, hamburgers and various

salads and sandwiches. Prices
are reasonable, starting at $4
and not above $N.
Though restaurants are
definitely not lacking in
Sausalito, ones with extraordi
nary desserts seem to be.
Sausalito Food Co is not among
them. Their mud pie is des
cribed as famous, and no
wonder. It's a delight to the eye
as well as one's tastebuds. For
reservations or information, call
(415) 332-0535.
Their mud pie (and prices
too, unfortunately) are outdone
by Ondine's. Open to the public
only for dinners, Ondine's
French-American restaurant is
unsurpassed. While its cuisine is
classic French, the approach to
customers is American: Every
one is warm and friendly. From
the moment you step in the door
and see the spectacular
panoramic view of the bay and
San Francisco, you'll feel as if
you're in another world.
Located on the waterfront at
558 Bridgewuy, Ondine's is the
place to go if you . want to
impress your date or if someone
wants to take you somewhere
special. Both your time and
your money will be well spent at
this superb restaurant. At
Ondine's nothing is spared to
make your experience a fine and
memorable one.
What distinguishes this res
taurant from so many others is
that each guest is treated like a
celebrity. Never will the chef be
warned that he is cooking for a
special dignitary. Rather, each
customer can expect superb ser
vice and an excellent meal.
That's how the restaurant has
maintained its reputation for
more than a quarter century.
The waiter will help you make
your selection from the menu.
"Do you feel like fish?" If your
answer is yes, there's fresh sal
mon in champagne sauce or
prawns provencale, to name two
of your choices. Or maybe you'd
prefer quail? Duck? Roasted
lamb or a choice cut of steak?
If you are about to scratch
Ondine's off your list of poten
tial restaurants to visit because
everything so far written implies

you'll spend a fortune — don't.
Keep reading, because Ondine's
menu includes a special selec
tion of dinners which are all
inclusive and cost approxi
mately $ IS.
These dinners are nothing
short of a good deal. They in
clude bread and butter, soup,
salad, an entree and a vegetable,
and coffee and desert. This din
ner special is offered until X
p.m.
If you don't order one of the
specials, you'll find an extensive
list of appetizers, salads and

deserts to accompany your
entree. For dessert, you may
want to order Baked Alaska,
which they tlambe at your table.
If you rate a meal on
presentation as well as taste,
Ondine's is hard to surpass. All
food comes out on silver serving
dishes and is then deftly trans
ferred onto each individual's
plate.
When your order is first
taken, you'll be asked if you
want the house's special des
sert —Gran Marnier Souffle.

You must order it in the begin
ning so it can he prepared and
ready when you are. At $12 for
two it seems slightly expensive.
But when you see it you know
you have to have one. Just as
waiters show you fine wine
before opening the bottle, the
souffle is brought out and dis
played for inspection. After the
well-deserved "oohs" and
"ahhs," your waiter will deftly
slice it down the middle, divide
it between the plates and pour
the Gran Marnier sauce (or
chocolate sauce or strawberries.

if you choose) over the fluffy,
delicate souffle.
By now your mouth is water
ing and people at the table next
to you have decided to order the
souffle too. Once you've
finished yours, you'll look at
theirs with envy and dream of
the day when you'll come to
Ondine's and say, "I'll skip din
ner. Just make me three
souffles." To make reservations,
call (415) 332-0791.


Cathy )anus/Daily
Cruise in style from one side of the Bay to the other — by boat. Whether you take a ferry
from the Ferry Building or Pier 43V2 in San Francisco, or charter a yacht or sailboat, you can
leave traffic and noise behind in exchange for the fresh sea breeze and a different style of
travel. If you prefer to keep your feet on dry land, dine at Ondine's Restaurant. Since it's
built right on the water, you'll find as magnificent a view as any on the bay, and you won't
have to worry about getting seasick.
