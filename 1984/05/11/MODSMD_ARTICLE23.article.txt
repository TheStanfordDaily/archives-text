## Women try to net NCAA title 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
If anyone has any doubts as to how
good the Stanford women's tennis team
is. they will be answered in the next four
days. The netters, who Sunday defeated
UCLA, S-l. finished the regular season
as the nation's only undefeated team at
22-0 and begin play tomorrow at the
NCAA Team Championships in Los An
geles.
The NCAAs feature the top 16 teams
in the nation, including Trinity, which
received the top seed over Stanford
despite having lost to UCLA earlier this
season. The teams will play a single elim
ination tournament with the same nine
match dual format — six singles and
three doubles matches — used during the
regular season.
Cardinal Head Coach Frank Brennan
saw a benefit to not being ranked No. 1.
"We won't have to play USC until the
finals, if we both get there," he noted. "I
think USC is the third-strongest team in
the draw." The Trojans are seeded fifth
and are in the same half of the bracket as
Trinity.
Brennan saw the main drawback to the
No. 2 ranking as having to play UCLA in
the second round, assuming the seventh
seeded Bruins get by Northwestern to
morrow.
Stanford will play Clemson. an
unseeded team, in tomorrow's first
round. The Tigers, the Atlantic Coast
Conference champions, bring a i9-15
record into the tournament, the most

losses in the field and should pose no
problem for the Cardinal, though they
will obviously be primed for an upset.
Looking ahead, it appears that the
Cardinal and UCLA will meet Sunday in
the quarterfinals. Though the Cardinal
soundly defeated the Bruins when they
visited the Farm on Sunday, things were
a hit tighter in L.A. last time, as the Card
scratched out a 5-4 win.
II the netters make it to the semifinals,
they will in all likelihood face either
Southwest Conference champion Texas
or fellow WCAA foe San Diego State.
The No. 3-ranked Longhorns are 2N-6
this year, while the sixth-ranked A/tecs
are 24-7. but two of those losses are to
Stanford, by 6-3 and 7-2 margins.
Trinity is the class of the other halt ol
the draw. The team from Texas features
two of the top live players in the nation
— top-ranked Gretchen Rush and No. 5
Louise Allen. Last month Trinity edged
out Stanford by two points in the NCAA
poll to move into the No. I spot and
remain there despite the blemish UCLA
handed them on an otherwise spotless
2S-1 record.
"I'd probably rather face USC in the
finals." Brennan said, "but it would he
poetic justice to play Trinity — the two
best teams in the country battling it out
for the championship."
Stanford will go with the same players
it has all year in the top four positions —
Patty Fendick at No. I. Linda Gates at
No. 2. Kate Gompert at No. 3 and Leigh
Anne Eldredge at No. 4.

Injuries have left the two positions
undetermined as of I.M night. Michelle
Weiss is still suffering H" m ;l pulled hip
tlexor and Elise Burgin i s not yet 1(H)
percent. Stephanie Savides will most
likely play one of the singles matches,
with either Burgin or Weiss in the other.
Alyce Werdel is also making the trip
down, though will most likely not play.
Brennan said he will "tart Fendiek and
Hldrcdge at first doubles, though he is
unsure whether Weiss and Gompert or
Gates and Burgin will play No. 2 and the
other team No. 3. Brennan said that
should either Burgin or Weiss be able to
play only one match, he would put her at
doubles to maintain the teamwork that
the doubles pairs have developed
through the season.
The Cardinal is trving to regain the
championship that it captured in 19N2.
Last year USC took the crown.
Tomorrow's match is scheduled for 2
p.m. at the UCLA varsit\ courts. Assum
ing the Cardinal keeps winning, it would
play its last three matches at the Los An
geles Tennis Center, where the 1954
Olympic tennis matches will be played.
Sunday's quarterfinal slated for noon,
while Monday's semifinal and I uesday's
final will start at 4 p.m.
Following the team competition, the
netters will have Wednesday off before
the individual championships begin
Thursday. Five Stanford players — Fen
dick, Gates, Gompert. Eldredge and
Weiss — have qualified in singles, and all
three doubles teams will compete as well.

Freshman Stephanie Savides will be waiting in the wings if either Elise Burgin or Mic
