# Men's hopes rest on doubles
## 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
The rest of the season pales in comparison to
the importance of tomorrow's match for the Stan
ford men's tennis team, as it begins the NCAA
Championship Tournament in Athens, Ga.
By defeating UC-Berkeley last Friday after
noon 7-2, the team wrapped up the dual match
season and goes into the tournament with a 19-5
overall record and a 7-3 record in the Pacific-10
Conference.
By playing extremely well toward the end of
the season, the Cardinal earned a No. 3 seeding.
Although the team's dual match standing is im
portant in determining the seedings for the tourn
ament, the results of the Cardinal's previous
matches will have no other effect on the tourna
ment.
Tomorrow the team will go against Clemson
University, which is currently ranked No. 8 na
tionally. The two teams met earlier this season in
February. The Cardinal came out on top with a 5-
4 victory. Head Coach Dick Gould indicated that
Stanford has improved greatly since that time. By
the same token however, Clemson has probably
improved as well.
If Stanford can get by Clemson, and SMU can
get by Wichita State, the Cardinal and the Mus
tangs will meet in the quarterfinals. Last year
these two teams met in the finals, which Stanford
won easily.

The only other team in Stanford's bracket
which might prevent the Cardinal from repeating
its national championship is USC. If both teams
win. they will clash in the semifinals which will be
played later next week.
The Trojans and the Cardinal have played twice
this season and both matches were very close and
very exciting. Unfortunately, Stanford came out
on the losing end of both matches. "When you
play matches like that against the No. I team,
your playing good tennis" Gould said. "(Both of
the matches) came down to a few points either
way. We're going to be looking to beat them at
nationals."

Gould is very optimistic about the team's
chances. "1 like the way the team is playing right
now. We struggled a little bit at the start, but now
we've got the confidence. Against Cal, some of
the guys weren't playing their best. But still they
found w,ays tO|Win.nThcy were really competitive
against,CaJ mnMhat's important from a team per
spective."
The big question for Stanford will be whether
the doubles teams can win at least two of the three
doubles matches each time the team plays. Al
though the doubles teams have played well
throughout the season, they have not been very
consistent.


Doubles play is the big question mark for the Cardinal as it
heads to Athens, Ga., for the NCAA Championship. Senior
Mark McKeen and freshman Derrick Rostagno have been one

lae So/Daily
of the most consistent Stanford teams, but consistency may
not be enough.
