# Post-season berth on the line in 'Big' series
## 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sportswriter 
When the Stanford Cardinal
and the UC-Berkeley Bears
collide on the football field the
meeting is called the "Big
Game". In water polo competi
tion the term used is the "Big
Splash." The Stanford-
Cal baseball battle that
renews this afternoon has no
such name.
But for the Cardinal, cur
rently No. 11-ranked and stalk
ing its fourth straight appear
ance in the NCAA Regionals,
the three-game series can be
called only one thing — the big
gest of the season.
The series may be the best of
the year too, as it brings to
gether the two hottest clubs in
the Pacific-10 Conference
Southern Division. The Bears
have awakened from an early
season hibernation to go 10-4
since the first week of April,
running their conference mark
to 11-16 and their season slate
•to 36-28-1 in the process.
But Stanford is the hottest
team in the conference. And
while Cal will finish its season
with this series, the Card can
virtually clinch a post-season
berth by matching USC's per
formance against UCLA this

weekend. Stanford is currently
in second place at 16-1 1 and 34-
23-1 overall, one game ahead of
use.
The first step toward the Col
lege World Series will include
36 teams, 25 of which will be
conference champions which
recieve automatic invitations. A
six-man selection committee
will fill the remaining 1 1 at
large bids from a pool of in
dependents and conference
runner-ups.
"This is the first year it's been
possible to have more than two
teams from a conference," ex
plained Stanford Head Coach
Mark Marquess, who is one of
the committee members. "I just
don't know what's going to hap
pen. If they take three teams
from a league, I would hope that
they take three from our
league."
Marquess is sure about one
thing. "We control our own des
tiny and I'd much rather be in
our position than in USC's," he
said earlier this week.
To make the most of the sit
uation, the Cardinal must cuff
the Bears' aggressive running
attack. Cal boasts four of the
top five base stealers in the con
ference including league-leader

Lance Blankenship (52 steals),
Rich Harger(4s), Frank Mattox
(36) and Mike /.ahn (29). Only
Stanford second baseman Pete
Stanicek, who has a club-record
41 thefts, prevents a Cal
monopoly of the top five.
Once again, the Card expects
its pitching staff to negate the
opponent's strengths. "They
can't steal if they don't get on
first," quipped Marquess.
"We'll hold them as close as
possible (at first) — we're not
going to make it easy for them."
Southpaw Jeff Ballard (7-5,
4.78 earned run average) will
climb the hill in today's opener
in Berkeley and, according to
Cal's Head Coach Bob Milano,
that presents a particular prob
lem for the Bears.
"Ballard is probably one of
the top four pitchers in the
league and he's trouble because
of our club's predominantly left
handed hitters. He's also got a
good move and he could keep us
close on the bases."
In fact, Cal has six hatters that
swing from the left side of the
plate, so Marquess expects to
use lefties Doug Gwaltney and
Al Osuna if he needs pitching
aid from the bullpen. But left
handed or not, the Bears hit
well, second-best in the confer

ence with a .307 team average.
Left fielder Tim Jester leads the
club with a .367 average, /ahn
(.347, 50 RBIs). Mattox (.346)
and Blankenship ( 297, 10 HRs
and 43 RBIs) also have quick
bats to go with their quick teet.
Milano, however, credits his
pitching for the Bears turn
around. "We started to develop
some confidence on the mound
and more consistency in pitch
ing," he said. "The last four and
a half weeks we have played un
believable. It's just tc.D bad we
got off to a 1-12 start.
But in a way, Milano's
pitchers may be starting all over
again because final exams have
prevented Cal from working out
the first three days of this veek.
Only Bren Conner (7-5 3.16
ERA) is a definite sMr f er. He
will oppose Ballard today, while
Bryan Price (8-3, 4./0 ERA)
and Will Schock (3-4, 4.1'
ERA) are the other probable
starters.
Stanford will try to capitalize
on Cal's misfortunes after rip
ping No. 1-ranked Arizona
State for 26 runs last weekend.
In Tempe, the Card received a
big boost from some little
known sources, such as out
fielder Walt Harris. The sopho
more had the game-winning

RBI in both Stanford victories
and went 7-for-13 with six RBIs
in the series while boosting his
season average to .321. His ex
ploits earned him "Six-Pac" co-
Player of the Week honors.
A pair of freshman keyed
Sunday's 13-11 win. Third
Baseman Mark Machtolf was 3-
for-4 with two RBIs and Toi
Cook collected two hits in five
trips as well as knocking in a
run. Still. Mike Deßenon
(.338), Rick Lundblade (.328,

57 RBIs), Darryl Stephens
(.325) and Stanicek (.319)
anchor the Stanford offense.
Anchoring the Card hurlcrs
for the last time in Sunken Dia
mond will be senior John
Radtke. Radtke will be shooting
for a spot on the all-league team
when he faces Cal tomorrow af
ternoon. Among P.i c-1 0
pitchers, he ranks fourth in win
ning percentage at 8-2, third in
complete games with four and
second-best with a 3.00 ERA.

Either Kevin Kunkel (3-6) or
Rob Wassenaar (1-1) should
start on Sunday.
Senior starters Stephens and
Lyle Smith, substitutes Cireg
Lorenzetti and Chris Britt as
well as pitchers Steve Cottrell,
Doug Gwaltney and Gregg
Lomnicky will also be making
their final home appearances in
tomorrow's 1 p.m. game. I'ho
two cross-Bay ri\ iils square ott
in Evans Diamond today at 3
p.m. and Sunday at I p.m.



The Cardinal cleaned up on Cal earlier this season when it
swept the Bears. If Stanford can recreate that feat it will

assure itself a post-season berth to the College World Serie
no matter what USC does against UCLA this weekend.

Ol is one of the hottest teams in the Pac-10 going into the weekend series and even senior
John Radtke may have to be a little underhanded to stop the Bears.
