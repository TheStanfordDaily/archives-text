## J.M. Coetzee's new novel is humane rather than political 
### Waiting for the Barbarians" By J.M. Coetzee Viking, $13.95, 184 pp BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
J.M. Coetzee's highly praised lust
novel, "Waiting for the Barbarians,"
allegorized the inevitably besieged po
sition of the author's native South
Africa, isolated and weakening at a
continent's extremity. Narrated by the
governor ot a nameless empire's
colonial outpost, it expressed the be
wilderment of individuals caught up in
political events that mean little to
them, concerned as they are with their
own lives and the history of their rela
tions to the land they live in.
"l ife and Times of Michael K,"
Coetzee's latest novel, is frankly set in
South Africa, but in an unspecified
future, when the military and political
situation has deteriorated to the verge
of chaos. But the issues of government
that "Waiting for the Barbarians,"
with its/civil servant narrator,
naturally brought to the fore are less
prominent in "Michael K." Though
attentive to the intrusions of political
authority on individuals, it spends
more time trying to explain or evoke
just what is disrupted and endangered.
The very difficulty of accounting for
and justifying these values, of explain
ing oneself and one's decisions,
becomes an independent theme itself.
Michael K is a harelipped, slightly
retarded gardener in the parks depart
ment of Cape Town. Mis racial classifi
cation (in South Africa these things
are a matter of bureaucracy almost as
much as of ancestry) is never stated
explicitly, but his identity card reads
CM — 40 — NFA, and I take the first
two letters as Coloured Male. Michael
loses his job at the beginning of the
novel, just as his mother's health
breaks down. They decide to trek back
into the countryside to the farm where
she wi's raised, but on the difficult trip
she dies. Michael continues on to a
farm that seems to be the one she des
cribed, buries her ashes there, and
then tries to scratch out a living on the
abandoned homestead, hiding from
government troops and guerrillas.
Farming, or gardening, is the theme
of many reflective passages in the
book, and the life in harmony with the
land that it represents is contrasted
with the political conflicts that seem so
senseless to Michael and most of the

other characters. At the abandoned
farm where he buries his mother's
cmains, Michael discovers a few
pumpkin seeds, and he attempts to
cultivate them during this first period
on the farm, and then again after re
turning there from a relocation camp.
He is again picked up, this time as a
guerrilla sympathizer, and sent on to
Cape Town, but he steadfastly refuses
to part with a last envelope of the
seeds. Even at the end of the story his
conviction is that seeds and the water
for them are the most important things
to preserve.
This privileging of gardening puts
the issues that all the lighting is about
on a subordinate level, finding a com
mon point of humanity in the need,
since they are the most fundamental

basis of survival, for "friendly rela
tions" with the earth. Michael insists
stubbornly on the idea that "there
must be men to stay behind and keep
gardening (dive, or at least the idea of
gardening; because once that cord was
broken, the earth would grow hard and
forget her children. " But Coetzee casts
the adequacy of this view into doubt
throughout the novel, letting Michael,
as well as others, question the honesty
of this justification for his actions.
Such justification takes the form ol
storytelling and finding a meaning tor
one's tale. Throughout the novel, Mi
chael finds himself obliged to give
some account of his history to new
people he encounters, and he is con
tinually preoccupied with finding a
story that he would find satisfactory,

and secondarily concerned with ex
plaining himself to others. Michael
seems bothered principally because he
fears his own life is not even interest
ing enough to hold anyone's attention
through the telling, but the search for
meaning and reason also busies him,
though less frequently and less ex
plicitly.
The impossibility of communicating
such information not only between
people, but also to oneself was
manifest in "Waiting for the Bar
barians," in scenes of interrogation, in
the governor's attempts to understand
the barbarian woman he takes under
his care, and in the narrator's reflec
tions on history. It was relatively
simple to bring up the issue in that
novel, since the governor himself was

the narrator, and his business brought
occasions for consideration of such
problems. "Life and Times of Michael
K," however, is narrated in the third
person, and the subtlety of Michael's
reflections on these topics sometimes
seems implausible, given the supposi
tion that he is "simple" enough to
have been sent to a special school as a
child.
Coetzee gets around some of this
trouble by breaking the novel into
three parts, the middle one narrated in
the first person by a pharmacist who
has been made medical officer in the
"re-education" camp to which Mi
chael is finally sent. Convinced that
Michael is innocent of any connection
with the rebels, the officer attempts to
persuade him to explain what he was

doing hiding out in the war zone. He is
even willing for Michael to make up
something plausible, and when his pa
tient refuses to cooperate he tries to
persuade the camp commander to fake
a report, just so that Michael can be
released.
Eventually Michael escapes on his
own, though in such miserable health
that he can hardly survive. In a long
imaginative conclusion, the officer ad
dresses the escaped Michael, bringing
into even greater prominence a set of
references to Coleridge's "The Rime
of the Ancient Mariner" that are also
at work elsewhere in the book. In
Coleridge's poem, it is the fate of the
Mariner to wander the globe, telling
the bizarre story of his lonely
voyage to people he meets. But the
significance of this story and the poem
in which it appears is a perennial criti
cal problem, and a similar uncertainty
is introduced to "Life and Times of
Michael K."
"Your stay in the camp was merely
an allegory, if you know that word. It
was an allegory - speaking at the high
est level - of how scandalously, how
outrageously a meaning can take up
residence in a system without becoming
a term in it," cries the officer to the im
agined Michael. But even though this
interpretation itself is tentative and
about the problem of understanding
itself, the officer ends his speech to
Michael by asking if his interpretation
is correct. The doubtful issue is whe
ther Michael himself understands.
This uncertainty about one's own
explanation of one's action, this ques
tioning of the meaning one assigns to
one's own life, was also apparent in
"Waiting for the Barbarians," and I
think it worked more successfully
there, in that it was better articulated
and intellectualized. The feeling of
anxiety and yearning that underlies
such doubt, hovever, is more effec
tively communicated in the new novel.
Coetzee's readers may have given
more weight to political issues in
"Waiting for the Barbarians" than the
complexity of that book merited.
"Life and Times of Michael K" should
establish the subtlety of Coetzee's in
sights on more subjects, and encour
age him to be read in wider terms, not
just as a South African author.

conviction is that seeds and the water
for them are the most important things
to preserve.
This privileging of gardening puts
the issues that all the lighting is about
on a subordinate level, finding a com
mon point of humanity in the need,
since they are the most fundamental

basis of survival, for "friendly rela
tions" with the earth. Michael insists
stubbornly on the idea that "there
must be men to stay behind and keep
gardening (dive, or at least the idea of
gardening; because once that cord was
broken, the earth would grow hard and
forget her children. " But Coetzee casts
the adequacy of this view into doubt
throughout the novel, letting Michael,
as well as others, question the honesty
of this justification for his actions.
Such justification takes the form ol
storytelling and finding a meaning tor
one's tale. Throughout the novel, Mi
chael finds himself obliged to give
some account of his history to new
people he encounters, and he is con
tinually preoccupied with finding a
story that he would find satisfactory,

and secondarily concerned with ex
plaining himself to others. Michael
seems bothered principally because he
fears his own life is not even interest
ing enough to hold anyone's attention
through the telling, but the search for
meaning and reason also busies him,
though less frequently and less ex
plicitly.
The impossibility of communicating
such information not only between
people, but also to oneself was
manifest in "Waiting for the Bar
barians," in scenes of interrogation, in
the governor's attempts to understand
the barbarian woman he takes under
his care, and in the narrator's reflec
tions on history. It was relatively
simple to bring up the issue in that
novel, since the governor himself was

the narrator, and his business brought
occasions for consideration of such
problems. "Life and Times of Michael
K," however, is narrated in the third
person, and the subtlety of Michael's
reflections on these topics sometimes
seems implausible, given the supposi
tion that he is "simple" enough to
have been sent to a special school as a
child.
Coetzee gets around some of this
trouble by breaking the novel into
three parts, the middle one narrated in
the first person by a pharmacist who
has been made medical officer in the
"re-education" camp to which Mi
chael is finally sent. Convinced that
Michael is innocent of any connection
with the rebels, the officer attempts to
persuade him to explain what he was

doing hiding out in the war zone. He is
even willing for Michael to make up
something plausible, and when his pa
tient refuses to cooperate he tries to
persuade the camp commander to fake
a report, just so that Michael can be
released.
Eventually Michael escapes on his
own, though in such miserable health
that he can hardly survive. In a long
imaginative conclusion, the officer ad
dresses the escaped Michael, bringing
into even greater prominence a set of
references to Coleridge's "The Rime
of the Ancient Mariner" that are also
at work elsewhere in the book. In
Coleridge's poem, it is the fate of the
Mariner to wander the globe, telling
the bizarre story of his lonely
voyage to people he meets. But the
significance of this story and the poem
in which it appears is a perennial criti
cal problem, and a similar uncertainty
is introduced to "Life and Times of
Michael K."
"Your stay in the camp was merely
an allegory, if you know that word. It
was an allegory - speaking at the high
est level - of how scandalously, how
outrageously a meaning can take up
residence in a system without becoming
a term in it," cries the officer to the im
agined Michael. But even though this
interpretation itself is tentative and
about the problem of understanding
itself, the officer ends his speech to
Michael by asking if his interpretation
is correct. The doubtful issue is whe
ther Michael himself understands.
This uncertainty about one's own
explanation of one's action, this ques
tioning of the meaning one assigns to
one's own life, was also apparent in
"Waiting for the Barbarians," and I
think it worked more successfully
there, in that it was better articulated
and intellectualized. The feeling of
anxiety and yearning that underlies
such doubt, hovever, is more effec
tively communicated in the new novel.
Coetzee's readers may have given
more weight to political issues in
"Waiting for the Barbarians" than the
complexity of that book merited.
"Life and Times of Michael K" should
establish the subtlety of Coetzee's in
sights on more subjects, and encour
age him to be read in wider terms, not
just as a South African author.


J.M. Coetzee's highly praised lust
novel, "Waiting for the Barbarians,"
allegorized the inevitably besieged po
sition of the author's native South
Africa, isolated and weakening at a
continent's extremity. Narrated by the
governor ot a nameless empire's
colonial outpost, it expressed the be
wilderment of individuals caught up in
political events that mean little to
them, concerned as they are with their
own lives and the history of their rela
tions to the land they live in.
"l ife and Times of Michael K,"
Coetzee's latest novel, is frankly set in
South Africa, but in an unspecified
future, when the military and political
situation has deteriorated to the verge
of chaos. But the issues of government
that "Waiting for the Barbarians,"
with its/civil servant narrator,
naturally brought to the fore are less
prominent in "Michael K." Though
attentive to the intrusions of political
authority on individuals, it spends
more time trying to explain or evoke
just what is disrupted and endangered.
The very difficulty of accounting for
and justifying these values, of explain
ing oneself and one's decisions,
becomes an independent theme itself.
Michael K is a harelipped, slightly
retarded gardener in the parks depart
ment of Cape Town. Mis racial classifi
cation (in South Africa these things
are a matter of bureaucracy almost as
much as of ancestry) is never stated
explicitly, but his identity card reads
CM — 40 — NFA, and I take the first
two letters as Coloured Male. Michael
loses his job at the beginning of the
novel, just as his mother's health
breaks down. They decide to trek back
into the countryside to the farm where
she wi's raised, but on the difficult trip
she dies. Michael continues on to a
farm that seems to be the one she des
cribed, buries her ashes there, and
then tries to scratch out a living on the
abandoned homestead, hiding from
government troops and guerrillas.
Farming, or gardening, is the theme
of many reflective passages in the
book, and the life in harmony with the
land that it represents is contrasted
with the political conflicts that seem so
senseless to Michael and most of the

other characters. At the abandoned
farm where he buries his mother's
cmains, Michael discovers a few
pumpkin seeds, and he attempts to
cultivate them during this first period
on the farm, and then again after re
turning there from a relocation camp.
He is again picked up, this time as a
guerrilla sympathizer, and sent on to
Cape Town, but he steadfastly refuses
to part with a last envelope of the
seeds. Even at the end of the story his
conviction is that seeds and the water
for them are the most important things
to preserve.
