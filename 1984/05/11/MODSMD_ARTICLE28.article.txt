### Dark Horse: A biography of Wendell Willkie" By Steve Neal Doubleday, $17.95, 369 pp DOUGLAS JEHL 
Ill 1940, with the Republican
party dominated, hy anti-New
Deal isolationists. Wendell
Willkic seemed an improbable
candidate tor the party's
presidential nomination.

Willkie. after all, had only been
u Republican for six months,
and on most matters of policy
was at odds with party leaders
like Robert Taft, Tom Dewey
and Arthur Vandenburg, all of
whom were launching their own
bids for the presidency.
But Willkie, the Indiana boy
who became a Wall Street
lawyer and then a utility com
pany president, the rumpled

businessman who had never
held public office, not only won
the nomination but went on to
come closer than anyone ever
had to defeating Franklin
Delano Roosevelt for the
presidency.
In a new biography, Steve
Neal, a political writer for the
Chicago Tribune, has chronicled
Willkie's life and his meteoric
rise within the Republican party

and in American regard. Neal
tells his story clearly, wasting
few words, but his style is jour
nalistic in the worst sense; with
stark sentence strung upon stark
sentence, it lacks the wit and
elegance necessary to bring the
tale to life.
Dissatisfying though it is,
"Dark Horse" is nonetheless an
able narrative, filled with telling
anecdotes, informed by an un

derstanding of the politics of the
times. Willkie, who reached na
tional prominence so quickly
but died just tour years later,
has been relegated to the back
of most political memories as
one of the four Republicans
trounced by FDR; this book
reminds us what an extraordi
nary man Willkie was, providing
a valuable contribution to the
all-too-sparse literature about

the man who very nearly
became our wartime president.
It is for being the "principled
candidate," "the man who
would rather be right than presi
dent," that Willkie is most often
remembered, and Neal shows us
that these labels were for the
most part deserved. "In a time
for heroes," Neal argues,
"Willkie was the man of the
hour . .. . (H)e became the con

science of American politics."
Willkie was the man who went
against the two central tenets of
pre-war Republicanism: con
tempt for the New Deal and iso
lationism. Recognizing that
some good had come out of gov
ernment intervention in the eco
nomy. he called for a reconcilia
tion between the New Deal and
industry. And while other
Republicans, comfortable be
hind America's two-ocean
moat, were attacking Roosevelt
for plans for peacetime con
scription and military aid to
Britain. Willkie was warning
that "the only thing this fellow
Hitler understands is strength."
Earl\ in the election year it
looked as if Willkie, with his
Democratic-sou tiding ideals,
stood no chance at the nomina
tion, and if it had been up to the
piqued party bosses, he never
would have gotten it. But
Willkie stirred something in
rank-and-file Republicans and
he had help from two dissimilar
sources: Henry Luce and Adolf
Hitler. Luce, th'* interventionist
publisher of Time, Life and
Fortune, enjoyed political
power almost unimaginable in
this television age — most
Americans got their news and
opinions from magazines,
usually Luce's magazines — and
by the summer of 1939. he had
decided that Willkie was his
man.
It was what Willkie had to say
about Hitler and the Nazi threat

that, more than anything else,
inspired support from Luce and
the tens of thousands of
Americans who formed Willkie
clubs across the country. And as
that threat became more appar
ent when the "phoney war"
ended and Hitler's Blitzkreig
rolled through Allied defenses,
pro-Willkie sentiment grew and
spread even to the most tradi
tional Republican quarters.
But. Neal tells us. l uce and
Hitler together couldn't guaran
tee Willkie's nomination, and
his supporters resorted to some
crafty convention-time tactics.
Tens of thousands of telegrams
— many of them later proved to
be fraudulent — were sent to
delegates and other candidates
urging them to get behind
Willkie. When Herbert Hoover
stepped to the podium amid a
tremendous display of enthusi
asm to make a speech that he
hoped might earn him his third
presidential nomination, he
spoke into a defective
microphone. Another Willkie
man masterminded the most ef
fective plan: He made sure that
nine of 10 gallery tickets went to
Willkie supporters, so that when
Willkie's name was put into
nomination, the galleries ex
ploded in a chorus of "We Want
Willkie! We Want Willkie! We

Want Willkie!" 1 lie Willkic
packed galleries kept up the
chant lor much of the rest ol the
convention as slov\l\.
miraculoush, delegates broke
away first from favorite sons
and then from favorites.
When matched against an in
cumbent president with whom
he very often agreed. Willkie.
Neal writes, strayed a hit trom
Ins internationalist principles. In
the fall, slipping in public es
teem. "he buckled to ex
pediency." "Instead ol the prin
cipled maverick, he was acting
like a normal politician." Flirt
ing with isolationism as the Bat
tle of Britain raged, he alleged
that Roosevelt had mauc secret
agreements that would commit
the nation to war and warned
that if Roosevelt were re-elected
America would be at war within
four months.
Willkie. of course, lost the
election — though he did
receive 22.3 million votes, the
largest popular turnout in his
party's history — but he did not
lose the support and friendship
of his opponent. "I'm happy
I've won," FDR told his son on
election night, "but I'm sorry
Wendell lost."
Willkie's 1944 bid tfi
recapture the party's nomina
tion was thwarted as the party

chose L)ewe>. they out hi u I
governor of New York. I he
defeat was ;i disappointment to
Willkie. hut he tell sure he
would ha\e another chanee. and
considered forming a third
party, But Willkie. who lor
years had been careless about
his health, became gra\el\ ill in
August, and after suffering a
number of heart attacks, died in
October at the age of 52.
"Shortly before his death."
Neal writes. "Willkie told a
friend. If I could write m\ own
epitaph and il I had to choose
between saying, "here lies an
unimportant president." or.
"Here lies one who contributed
to saving freedom at a moment
of great peril." I would prefer
the latter.' " It would have been
apt. Had the Republicans
nominated an isolationist, the

campaign of 1940 might
have been a forum on whether
America had any business in
an\ foreign wars, and the nation
would have been even less
prepared than it was when the
attack on Pearl Harbor came.
Willkie's determination to
speak his mind without worry
ing i'bout political consequences
was rare even then: Roosevelt,
for one. rarely made a decision
without consulting the polls.
Today it would be particularly
refreshing: reading Neat's book
in the midst of the campaign
makes one yearn for that sort of
candor, for a real outsider who
would voice new ideas, ideas m
which he truly believed, without
first sitting down with his poll
ster to plot public opinion.

but died just tour years later,
has been relegated to the back
of most political memories as
one of the four Republicans
trounced by FDR; this book
reminds us what an extraordi
nary man Willkie was, providing
a valuable contribution to the
all-too-sparse literature about

the man who very nearly
became our wartime president.
It is for being the "principled
candidate," "the man who
would rather be right than presi
dent," that Willkie is most often
remembered, and Neal shows us
that these labels were for the
most part deserved. "In a time
for heroes," Neal argues,
"Willkie was the man of the
hour . .. . (H)e became the con

science of American politics."
Willkie was the man who went
against the two central tenets of
pre-war Republicanism: con
tempt for the New Deal and iso
lationism. Recognizing that
some good had come out of gov
ernment intervention in the eco
nomy. he called for a reconcilia
tion between the New Deal and
industry. And while other
Republicans, comfortable be
hind America's two-ocean
moat, were attacking Roosevelt
for plans for peacetime con
scription and military aid to
Britain. Willkie was warning
that "the only thing this fellow
Hitler understands is strength."
Earl\ in the election year it
looked as if Willkie, with his
Democratic-sou tiding ideals,
stood no chance at the nomina
tion, and if it had been up to the
piqued party bosses, he never
would have gotten it. But
Willkie stirred something in
rank-and-file Republicans and
he had help from two dissimilar
sources: Henry Luce and Adolf
Hitler. Luce, th'* interventionist
publisher of Time, Life and
Fortune, enjoyed political
power almost unimaginable in
this television age — most
Americans got their news and
opinions from magazines,
usually Luce's magazines — and
by the summer of 1939. he had
decided that Willkie was his
man.
It was what Willkie had to say
about Hitler and the Nazi threat

that, more than anything else,
inspired support from Luce and
the tens of thousands of
Americans who formed Willkie
clubs across the country. And as
that threat became more appar
ent when the "phoney war"
ended and Hitler's Blitzkreig
rolled through Allied defenses,
pro-Willkie sentiment grew and
spread even to the most tradi
tional Republican quarters.
But. Neal tells us. l uce and
Hitler together couldn't guaran
tee Willkie's nomination, and
his supporters resorted to some
crafty convention-time tactics.
Tens of thousands of telegrams
— many of them later proved to
be fraudulent — were sent to
delegates and other candidates
urging them to get behind
Willkie. When Herbert Hoover
stepped to the podium amid a
tremendous display of enthusi
asm to make a speech that he
hoped might earn him his third
presidential nomination, he
spoke into a defective
microphone. Another Willkie
man masterminded the most ef
fective plan: He made sure that
nine of 10 gallery tickets went to
Willkie supporters, so that when
Willkie's name was put into
nomination, the galleries ex
ploded in a chorus of "We Want
Willkie! We Want Willkie! We

Want Willkie!" 1 lie Willkic
packed galleries kept up the
chant lor much of the rest ol the
convention as slov\l\.
miraculoush, delegates broke
away first from favorite sons
and then from favorites.
When matched against an in
cumbent president with whom
he very often agreed. Willkie.
Neal writes, strayed a hit trom
Ins internationalist principles. In
the fall, slipping in public es
teem. "he buckled to ex
pediency." "Instead ol the prin
cipled maverick, he was acting
like a normal politician." Flirt
ing with isolationism as the Bat
tle of Britain raged, he alleged
that Roosevelt had mauc secret
agreements that would commit
the nation to war and warned
that if Roosevelt were re-elected
America would be at war within
four months.
Willkie. of course, lost the
election — though he did
receive 22.3 million votes, the
largest popular turnout in his
party's history — but he did not
lose the support and friendship
of his opponent. "I'm happy
I've won," FDR told his son on
election night, "but I'm sorry
Wendell lost."
Willkie's 1944 bid tfi
recapture the party's nomina
tion was thwarted as the party

chose L)ewe>. they out hi u I
governor of New York. I he
defeat was ;i disappointment to
Willkie. hut he tell sure he
would ha\e another chanee. and
considered forming a third
party, But Willkie. who lor
years had been careless about
his health, became gra\el\ ill in
August, and after suffering a
number of heart attacks, died in
October at the age of 52.
"Shortly before his death."
Neal writes. "Willkie told a
friend. If I could write m\ own
epitaph and il I had to choose
between saying, "here lies an
unimportant president." or.
"Here lies one who contributed
to saving freedom at a moment
of great peril." I would prefer
the latter.' " It would have been
apt. Had the Republicans
nominated an isolationist, the

campaign of 1940 might
have been a forum on whether
America had any business in
an\ foreign wars, and the nation
would have been even less
prepared than it was when the
attack on Pearl Harbor came.
Willkie's determination to
speak his mind without worry
ing i'bout political consequences
was rare even then: Roosevelt,
for one. rarely made a decision
without consulting the polls.
Today it would be particularly
refreshing: reading Neat's book
in the midst of the campaign
makes one yearn for that sort of
candor, for a real outsider who
would voice new ideas, ideas m
which he truly believed, without
first sitting down with his poll
ster to plot public opinion.

Ill 1940, with the Republican
party dominated, hy anti-New
Deal isolationists. Wendell
Willkic seemed an improbable
candidate tor the party's
presidential nomination.

Willkie. after all, had only been
u Republican for six months,
and on most matters of policy
was at odds with party leaders
like Robert Taft, Tom Dewey
and Arthur Vandenburg, all of
whom were launching their own
bids for the presidency.
But Willkie, the Indiana boy
who became a Wall Street
lawyer and then a utility com
pany president, the rumpled

businessman who had never
held public office, not only won
the nomination but went on to
come closer than anyone ever
had to defeating Franklin
Delano Roosevelt for the
presidency.
In a new biography, Steve
Neal, a political writer for the
Chicago Tribune, has chronicled
Willkie's life and his meteoric
rise within the Republican party

and in American regard. Neal
tells his story clearly, wasting
few words, but his style is jour
nalistic in the worst sense; with
stark sentence strung upon stark
sentence, it lacks the wit and
elegance necessary to bring the
tale to life.
Dissatisfying though it is,
"Dark Horse" is nonetheless an
able narrative, filled with telling
anecdotes, informed by an un

derstanding of the politics of the
times. Willkie, who reached na
