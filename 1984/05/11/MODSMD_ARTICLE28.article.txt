### Dark Horse: A biography of Wendell Willkie" By Steve Neal Doubleday, $17.95, 369 pp DOUGLAS JEHL 
Ill 1940, with the Republican
party dominated, hy anti-New
Deal isolationists. Wendell
Willkic seemed an improbable
candidate tor the party's
presidential nomination.

Willkie. after all, had only been
u Republican for six months,
and on most matters of policy
was at odds with party leaders
like Robert Taft, Tom Dewey
and Arthur Vandenburg, all of
whom were launching their own
bids for the presidency.
But Willkie, the Indiana boy
who became a Wall Street
lawyer and then a utility com
pany president, the rumpled

businessman who had never
held public office, not only won
the nomination but went on to
come closer than anyone ever
had to defeating Franklin
Delano Roosevelt for the
presidency.
In a new biography, Steve
Neal, a political writer for the
Chicago Tribune, has chronicled
Willkie's life and his meteoric
rise within the Republican party

and in American regard. Neal
tells his story clearly, wasting
few words, but his style is jour
nalistic in the worst sense; with
stark sentence strung upon stark
sentence, it lacks the wit and
elegance necessary to bring the
tale to life.
Dissatisfying though it is,
"Dark Horse" is nonetheless an
able narrative, filled with telling
anecdotes, informed by an un

derstanding of the politics of the
times. Willkie, who reached na
tional prominence so quickly
but died just tour years later,
has been relegated to the back
of most political memories as
one of the four Republicans
trounced by FDR; this book
reminds us what an extraordi
nary man Willkie was, providing
a valuable contribution to the
all-too-sparse literature about

the man who very nearly
became our wartime president.
It is for being the "principled
candidate," "the man who
would rather be right than presi
dent," that Willkie is most often
remembered, and Neal shows us
that these labels were for the
most part deserved. "In a time
for heroes," Neal argues,
"Willkie was the man of the
hour . .. . (H)e became the con

science of American politics."
Willkie was the man who went
against the two central tenets of
pre-war Republicanism: con
tempt for the New Deal and iso
lationism. Recognizing that
some good had come out of gov
ernment intervention in the eco
nomy. he called for a reconcilia
tion between the New Deal and
