When United Stanford Workers
(USW) decided to break away from its
larger affiliate union last December,
its members probably did not envision
the legal nightmare they were enter

labor law technicalities that is creating
much ill feeling between the Univer
sity and the union.
University officials are claiming
USW did not conduct a legal disaffilia
tion procedure before the larger
union. Local 715. pulled out from
representing the Stanford workers.
They say the consequence is that the
bargaining unit now has no union rep
resentation at all.
USW officials claim their disaffilia
tion process was indeed valid and the
University is illegally trying to
demoralize — with the intention ol
eventually breaking — the union.
The complexities of labor law as
well as the combative tone ol the par
ticipants have made the*entire matter
quite confusing. The present situation
can better be understood if seen in
context of USW's I I vear history.
Hie technical, maintenance and ser
vice workers at Stanford received their
union charter in 1973 as USW . Local
bSO. Service Workers International
Union (SEIU). At that time, the bar
gaining unit had about 1550 members.

All bargaining unit members
receive the same contract union mem
bers do. One can be a member of the
bargaining unit and still not belong to
the union.
From the outset, the union was
plagued with internal divisions — the
bargaining unit included employees
ranging from food-service workers
and groundskecpers to electricians
and technicians. These cleavages have
made difficult the bargaining unit's at
tempts to maintain a united front in its
dealings with management.
In 1 9,50. USW. Local 6NO —by this
time down to 1400 members due to
the University's contracting out and
use of temporary workers — affiliated
with Local 715. the 9000-member
county wide unit. The move was
made, according to USW officials, for
administrative purposes. Another rea
son may have been to bolster USW's
slowly diminishing strength by joining
with a larger membership.
In fall of 1982. Local 715 led USW
on a five-week strike — the longest in
its II year history. The walkout
ended, to the bitter disappointment of
many bargaining unit members, with
USW accepting terms almost identical
to those offered before the strike
began.
The perceived failure of the strike
intensified the friction between USW
and the 715 staff. USWs style of rank
and-file leadership contrasted sharply
wiili the prolcssionalist unionism em
bodied in 715. The outcome of the
strike onl\ made matters worse.
