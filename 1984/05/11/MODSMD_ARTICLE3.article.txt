(USW) decided to break away from its

News analysis

labor law technicalities that is creating
much ill feeling between the Univer
sity and the union.
University officials are claiming
USW did not conduct a legal disaffilia
tion procedure before the larger
union. Local 715. pulled out from
representing the Stanford workers.
They say the consequence is that the
bargaining unit now has no union rep
resentation at all.
USW officials claim their disaffilia
tion process was indeed valid and the
University is illegally trying to
demoralize — with the intention ol
eventually breaking — the union.
The complexities of labor law as
well as the combative tone ol the par
ticipants have made the*entire matter
quite confusing. The present situation
can better be understood if seen in
context of USW's I I vear history.
Hie technical, maintenance and ser
vice workers at Stanford received their
union charter in 1973 as USW . Local
bSO. Service Workers International
Union (SEIU). At that time, the bar
gaining unit had about 1550 members.

All bargaining unit members
receive the same contract union mem
bers do. One can be a member of the
bargaining unit and still not belong to
the union.
From the outset, the union was
plagued with internal divisions — the
bargaining unit included employees
ranging from food-service workers
and groundskecpers to electricians
and technicians. These cleavages have
made difficult the bargaining unit's at
tempts to maintain a united front in its
dealings with management.
In 1 9,50. USW. Local 6NO —by this
time down to 1400 members due to
the University's contracting out and
use of temporary workers — affiliated
with Local 715. the 9000-member
county wide unit. The move was
made, according to USW officials, for
administrative purposes. Another rea
son may have been to bolster USW's
slowly diminishing strength by joining
with a larger membership.
In fall of 1982. Local 715 led USW
on a five-week strike — the longest in
its II year history. The walkout
ended, to the bitter disappointment of
many bargaining unit members, with
USW accepting terms almost identical
to those offered before the strike
began.
The perceived failure of the strike
intensified the friction between USW
and the 715 staff. USWs style of rank
and-file leadership contrasted sharply
wiili the prolcssionalist unionism em
bodied in 715. The outcome of the
strike onl\ made matters worse.
IMB3 proved to he the beginning of
the end for USW's marriage with
Local 715. In December the present
leadership, including USW President
I .inda ( rouse, vvon the bargaining unit
election. Their platform included a
promise to begin disaffiliation
proceedings and regain greatci
autonomy for the Stanford bargaining
unit.
Ihe new leadership garnered ovci
500 signatures on a petition to hold .i
disaffiliation election. Before the peti
tion was formally presented, howevei
the International recharted the Stan
ford bargaining unit as Local 680 and
separated the two unions. In earh
February Michael Baratz, executive
secretary of Local 715. notified the
University that 715 would cease
representing the Stanford workers and
Local 680 would take its place.
The University refused to accept
tins change before a disaffiliation elec
tion was conducted. On March 15, it
filed unfair labor practice charges with
the National Labor Relations Board
(NI.RB) against both locals. It
charged 715 with not living up to
contractual obligations by not
representing the Stanford workers
while charging 680 with demanding
University recognition without first
holding a disaffiliation election.

At that time union leaders ex
pressed concern that the I niversity
would try to force an NI.RB election
m an effort to weaken or even elimi
nate the union.
An NI.RB election takes place
when there is no pre-existing union. In
such an election, both emplovei and
union organizers are allowed to cam
paign. A disaffiliation election is an in
ternal union matter in which the em
ployer can take no part.
On April IS. USW held a referen
dum election asking the bargaining
unit whether it wanted to be
represented by USW. I oca I bNO. The
election was conducted by the Ameri
can Arbitration Association — an
outside group that specializes in union
elections. It resulted in (->32 votes cast
m favor of Local 6NO and 125 votes
against.
I he University refused to recognize
the election as legitimate, claiming the
ballot should have presented a choice
between 715 and 6NO.
In response, USW filed its own un
fair labor practice charge against the
University, accusing Stanford of not
recognizing Local 680 even after an
affirmative disaffiliation vote.
On April 30. the NI.RB regional of
fice dismissed the University's charges
against the two locals. It said there was
nothing illegal about 680's asking for
recognition before a vote, but added
that the University was correct in not
giving recognition before such an elec
tion was held. The decision also said

there were no grounds tor the I imer
mt\ s charge against l.oeal VIS. as the
union had simplv "abandoned" the
bargaining unit and was thus under no
obligation to provide representation.
The L'niversit) interpreted the In
claiming that Stanford workers no
longer ha\e anv union representation
whatsoever. Since 715 pulled out
before a disaffiliation was complete.
USW had no union from which to dis
affiliate.
In a Mav 7 letter to the Stanford
communit). Universit) President
Donald kenned) explained the Uni
\ersit)'s viewpoint, adding that il
L ! SW wanted Universit) recognition,
it would have to petition for an Nl. KB
election.
On Ma) S the Universit) an
nounced that it would stop collecting
and turning over union dues from em
plovee pavchecks and would trv to
return alreadv collected dues to indi
v iduaffcmploxccs.
Union officials claim the Universit)
is playing technical games and is in
reality attempting to destroy union
representation at Stanford. The) claim
the NI.RB ruling on USW's charge
against the Universit) will determine
l.oeal 680's validity and Stanford is in
no position to be deciding what is and
is not a legal disaffiliation.
II the NI.RB regional office finds
significant grounds in the union's
charges, it will file a complaint to the
NI.RB administrative office, which

can hold a hearing on the matter.
Though the issuing of a complaint of
ten signals the end of the Nl.Rß's in
volvement. the Universit) has indi
cated it w ill take a regional ruling to its
hearing stage. Both the Universit) and
the union will be able to present their
cases at that time.
I his hearing could take as long as
si\ months to process given the pres
ent backlog of cases.
If the regional office dismisses the
charges as groundless, then the USW
will have no legal representative. If
thik were to occur, the union could pe
tition the N1 RB to hold an organizinu
election. I liis process would onlv take
3(1 dav s to complete.
Il the regional office liiuls sufficient
grounds to uphold USW's charues,
Universit) officials sa\ the) would
maintain their present stance toward the
union. That is. 6NO officials would not
be recognized and dues would not be
collected.
I luis I SW tinds itself in an ironic
position. II its charges against the Uni
versit) have merit. USW could find it
sell caught in a months-long legal bat
tle before Local ftNO can be
recognized, while if its charges are dis
missed. I SW could be represented bv
6NO within a month.
Whatever the turnout of the NI.RB
charge, the Stanford community can
be reasonably certain that USW and
the University will continue their
struggle into the foreseeable future.

News analysis

labor law technicalities that is creating
much ill feeling between the Univer

University officials are claiming
USW did not conduct a legal disaffilia
tion procedure before the larger
union. Local 715. pulled out from
representing the Stanford workers.
They say the consequence is that the
bargaining unit now has no union rep
resentation at all.
USW officials claim their disaffilia
tion process was indeed valid and the
University is illegally trying to
demoralize — with the intention ol
eventually breaking — the union.
The complexities of labor law as
well as the combative tone ol the par
ticipants have made the*entire matter
quite confusing. The present situation
can better be understood if seen in
context of USW's I I vear history.
Hie technical, maintenance and ser
vice workers at Stanford received their
union charter in 1973 as USW . Local
bSO. Service Workers International
Union (SEIU). At that time, the bar
gaining unit had about 1550 members.

All bargaining unit members
receive the same contract union mem
bers do. One can be a member of the
bargaining unit and still not belong to
the union.
From the outset, the union was
plagued with internal divisions — the
bargaining unit included employees
ranging from food-service workers
and groundskecpers to electricians
and technicians. These cleavages have
made difficult the bargaining unit's at
tempts to maintain a united front in its
dealings with management.
In 1 9,50. USW. Local 6NO —by this
time down to 1400 members due to
the University's contracting out and
use of temporary workers — affiliated
with Local 715. the 9000-member
county wide unit. The move was
made, according to USW officials, for
administrative purposes. Another rea
son may have been to bolster USW's
slowly diminishing strength by joining
with a larger membership.
In fall of 1982. Local 715 led USW
on a five-week strike — the longest in
its II year history. The walkout
ended, to the bitter disappointment of
many bargaining unit members, with
USW accepting terms almost identical
to those offered before the strike
began.
The perceived failure of the strike
intensified the friction between USW
and the 715 staff. USWs style of rank
and-file leadership contrasted sharply
wiili the prolcssionalist unionism em
bodied in 715. The outcome of the
strike onl\ made matters worse.
IMB3 proved to he the beginning of
the end for USW's marriage with
Local 715. In December the present
leadership, including USW President
I .inda ( rouse, vvon the bargaining unit
election. Their platform included a
promise to begin disaffiliation
proceedings and regain greatci
autonomy for the Stanford bargaining
unit.
Ihe new leadership garnered ovci
500 signatures on a petition to hold .i
disaffiliation election. Before the peti
tion was formally presented, howevei
the International recharted the Stan
ford bargaining unit as Local 680 and
separated the two unions. In earh
February Michael Baratz, executive
secretary of Local 715. notified the
University that 715 would cease
representing the Stanford workers and
Local 680 would take its place.
The University refused to accept
tins change before a disaffiliation elec
tion was conducted. On March 15, it
filed unfair labor practice charges with
the National Labor Relations Board
(NI.RB) against both locals. It
charged 715 with not living up to
contractual obligations by not
representing the Stanford workers
while charging 680 with demanding
University recognition without first
holding a disaffiliation election.

At that time union leaders ex
pressed concern that the I niversity
would try to force an NI.RB election
m an effort to weaken or even elimi
nate the union.
An NI.RB election takes place
when there is no pre-existing union. In
such an election, both emplovei and
union organizers are allowed to cam
paign. A disaffiliation election is an in
ternal union matter in which the em
ployer can take no part.
On April IS. USW held a referen
dum election asking the bargaining
unit whether it wanted to be
represented by USW. I oca I bNO. The
election was conducted by the Ameri
can Arbitration Association — an
outside group that specializes in union
elections. It resulted in (->32 votes cast
m favor of Local 6NO and 125 votes
against.
I he University refused to recognize
the election as legitimate, claiming the
ballot should have presented a choice
between 715 and 6NO.
In response, USW filed its own un
fair labor practice charge against the
University, accusing Stanford of not
recognizing Local 680 even after an
affirmative disaffiliation vote.
On April 30. the NI.RB regional of
fice dismissed the University's charges
against the two locals. It said there was
nothing illegal about 680's asking for
recognition before a vote, but added
that the University was correct in not
giving recognition before such an elec
tion was held. The decision also said

there were no grounds tor the I imer
mt\ s charge against l.oeal VIS. as the
union had simplv "abandoned" the
bargaining unit and was thus under no
obligation to provide representation.
The L'niversit) interpreted the In
claiming that Stanford workers no

before a disaffiliation was complete.
USW had no union from which to dis
