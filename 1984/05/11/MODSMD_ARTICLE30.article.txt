## Elvis concert wasn't 'wonderful' for the faithful 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
Sometimes people get funny ideas.
Elvis Costello got it into his head to
perform a solo tour, without his excel
lent backing band, and single
handedly brave the crowds that a few
years ago he had chased out of the
theatres after his shows by blaring
white noise through the public address
system.
Said crowds fell into the curious be
havior of snapping up the tickets for
this tour as if they were ducats for the
Second Coming, and then received
Costello with a mixture of idoltry and
indulgence that would have embar
rassed the angel Gabriel.
This reviewer, in the face of the
deliriously happy crowds and the
glowing reviews of the concert
(notably The Daily, May 4), chooses
to lay his credibility upon the line and
attempt to explain why he hated
nearly every second of the show and
left the theater feeling cheated,
betrayed, and, most of all, severely
disappointed by Costello" s
"wonderful" show.
One could try to blame it all on high
expectations — being in such an inti
mate setting with him one would ex
pect to get to "know" him, and that
prospect, especially because he him
selt had spent such great time and ef
fort building up his aura of mystery,
seemed tremendously promising.
That wasn't the problem; actually,
Elvis did provide insight into his char
acter and his songs — once. One of his
songs, "Man Called Uncle," has al
ways been difficult to fathom. The
lines of the song, lor the most part,
hold up of themselves, but the overall
theme of the song escaped me.
Before beginning the song, the
second in his set, he announced that
this was a song set in a singles bar,
with a man alone, "staring into his
drink, thinking of his wife, of his kids
. . . and of the Man Called Uncle.' "
That may not seem like a lot, but it
makes a world of difference in the un
derstanding of the song.
But there wasn't any more of that in
the show. Instead we were exposed to
moments of attempted self-parody
that slid into a mockery, to an infec
tion of hilarity from the audience that
sapped the serious songs of their im
pact, and, above all, a rather heartless
show that showcased Costello's consi
derable talent while completely
obscuring his spirit and inspiration.
Granting that his maturity has
allowed him to distance himself from
his former stances, knowledge of his
previous ridiculous behavior has
allowed him to inject some humor into
his stage act. That is a stage in the de

velopment of an artist. Because of the
quirky mood of the audience, Elvis
took a huge leap on to the path of he
coming a clown.
There was something wrong — al
though it would he fairer to say
different — about the audience at the
show. Perhaps because it was a solo
recital, there was an older crowd than
usual, and one that didn't seem like
they were there to attend a rock con
cert, least of all an Elvis Costello
show.
It is possible that the acts started the
silliness first. T-Bone Burnett,
opening, proved himself to be little

more than a buffoon, starting by pan
tomiming piano playing along with a
tape recording, a bit of schtick that
was old when Steve Martin was ex
ploiting it years ago. Then he proceeds
to do a novelty Roger Miller cover,
and then launch into a series of
droning originals, interspaced with
politically proper, trendy witticisms.
The crowd loved him. I had heard
he was chased from the stage in New
York — he seemed honestly surprised
by his reception here — and I am yet
unable to say what they saw in his act.
The crowd was otherwise eccentric.
As Elvis began each song, as soon as
the tune was recognizable the audi
ence would break into simpering
cooing and a brief smatter of applause.
Such behavior may be appropriate at
the Simon and Garfunkel reunion, but
is out of place with rock's latest Angry
Young Man.
Furthermore, they reacted out of
scale to anything Elvis said or did. He

came to the microphone to introduce a
song, and the gang of sycophants met
his words with a roar of laughter.
Els is, pu/zled, asked "What's so
funny about 'Here's a song?' " Noth
ing, obviously, but the audience was
willing to believe that there was.
Worse, the audience was more in
terested in reacting to what Elvis did
than in listening to what he sang. Any
trademark gesture or nervous twitch
brought on a gale of laughter, some
thing that Elvis came to play upon.
Worst of all, there was committed the
unpardonable sin of the cult of Cos
tello: A large part of the audience

laughed during "Alison."
The crowd was more interested in
its affairs and its interaction with the
show than the act that was on stage.
This seems to lay a large portion of
blame upon the audience, but. frankly,
given the performance Elvis delivered
that night, I really couldn't blame the
crowd for losing interest.
Half the problem was just the diffi
culty in carrying off a one-man show.
Elvis is not a virtuoso guitarist, and
many of his songs sounded instrumen-
alike due to his technique of ac
companying himself mainly by simply
fretting the triad of the chord and
thrumming the bass notes.
The major complaint, the real
source of my discontent, lies in the fact
that I did not get to see Elvis Costello
that night. Instead of the last Angry
Young Man, we saw band leader Ross
McManus' son, having his night in the
spotlights with his arrangements ot
certain pop new-wave tunes.

HI vis consistently sang unwieldy
hybrid versions of his songs, throttled
by the inadequacy of solo perfor
mance and subverted and diminished
by the good-times atmosphere that
robbed the songs of their emotional
depth. As a younger man, he had said
that "songs can be so powerful —
people have forgotten that," but that
night he turned his back on the power
and worked on the shine of the polish,
the merest superficiality of the emo
tions he had once tapped.
I hat's not to say that the show had
no high points. On piano, Elvis
delivered moving versions of "Just a
Memory" and "High Fidelity," and,
despite the indifference of the crowd,
he carried out an extended finale on
"Alison."
Arguably the highest point came
after Elvis had played some highly for
gettable material on an electric piano,
mugging furiously as he did so. When
the laughter and the cheers reached
him he seemed to make a decision,
and he pounded his fist on the piano as
he left to perform a powerful version
of "Riot Act," the one example of the
passion of live performance lifting a
song above its normal level that the
show had to provide.
When Elvis brought out Burnett for
an encore, and they introduced them
selves as Hank and Harry, the Coward
Brothers, the evening hit rock bottom.
Some feeble country tunes and some
equally feeble guitar figures brought
the usual inexplicable explosion of en
thusiasm from the crowd. At this point
I felt I was sure that I wasn't watching
Elvis Costello but rather some tawdry
sociological phenomenon.
There was so very little of the power
and the depth that I had associated
with Elvis in that show. On the drive
to the concert my friend told me that
the night before he had seen old
footage of him, from the days of his
first album, and he noted he looked
angry and like he had a lot to prove to
someone. That night's show sprang
from something else entirely.
Elvis had once said he understood
only two emotions, guilt and the desire
for vengeance. Now he sings songs of
sorrow and self-pity — but under sor
row lies guilt and beneath self-pity is
the anger of having been wronged that
leads to vengeance. Perhaps not much
has changed, or perhaps everything
has.
When I first began listening to Elvis
Costello I was going through hard
times, my teenage years, and his songs
touched me with an eloquence and
purity unlike anything I had ever
heard or seen. Now, hard times having
become almost chronic, I came to his

show expecting the catharsis of days
past and am treated to buffoonery and
Elvis affectionately chiding his audi
ence like some elderly schoolmarm.
Elvis has matured. Those past days
he was angry and an almost elemental
force, but I doubt that he was very
happy. Now he may very well be as
happy as his stage persona that night
suggested, and I have no right to
begrudge him that happiness. But . . .
Joe Jackson has grown up, and
writes fragile songs of mellowed un
certainty. Paul Weller has abandoned
youthful righteousness for a sort of
premature pragmatic optimism. Al
most all the other bright lights of the
movement to "revolutionize" music
have sold out or, similarily, given up a
fight they know to be unwinnable.
Elvis was almost the only one left.
Was.
Now he's an entertainer, a happy
man with his first hit single under his

belt. He still bubbles over with ideas
and cleverness — a few of the new
songs seemed very good and will,
benefit from studio treatment — but
the fire in him seems to have gone out.
It's a terrible thing to be the last one
of your "crowd" to leave adolescence
and abandon the moral force of the
righteous young, but I'm just not yet
able to move on. Perhaps that's how
I'm behind the times, and maybe
that's why I hated a show many others
seemed to love.
Yet. the incandescent power and
purity of those emotions still attract
me. and Graham Parker remains a fel
low raging voice. He and I shall con
tinue our crusades for as long as we
can. for as long as we need to. and I
will keep my well-worn copies of My
Aim is True and This Year's Model
close at hand, and I shall keep my tar
nished image of the young Elvis Cos
tello foremost in mv mind.

drink, thinking of his wife, of his kids
. . . and of the Man Called Uncle.' "
That may not seem like a lot, but it
makes a world of difference in the un
derstanding of the song.
But there wasn't any more of that in
the show. Instead we were exposed to
moments of attempted self-parody
that slid into a mockery, to an infec
tion of hilarity from the audience that
sapped the serious songs of their im
pact, and, above all, a rather heartless
show that showcased Costello's consi
derable talent while completely
obscuring his spirit and inspiration.
Granting that his maturity has
allowed him to distance himself from
his former stances, knowledge of his
previous ridiculous behavior has
allowed him to inject some humor into
his stage act. That is a stage in the de

velopment of an artist. Because of the
quirky mood of the audience, Elvis
took a huge leap on to the path of he
coming a clown.
There was something wrong — al
though it would he fairer to say
different — about the audience at the
show. Perhaps because it was a solo
recital, there was an older crowd than
usual, and one that didn't seem like
they were there to attend a rock con
cert, least of all an Elvis Costello
show.
It is possible that the acts started the
silliness first. T-Bone Burnett,
opening, proved himself to be little

more than a buffoon, starting by pan
tomiming piano playing along with a
tape recording, a bit of schtick that
was old when Steve Martin was ex
ploiting it years ago. Then he proceeds
to do a novelty Roger Miller cover,
and then launch into a series of
droning originals, interspaced with
politically proper, trendy witticisms.
The crowd loved him. I had heard
he was chased from the stage in New
York — he seemed honestly surprised
by his reception here — and I am yet
unable to say what they saw in his act.
The crowd was otherwise eccentric.
As Elvis began each song, as soon as
the tune was recognizable the audi
ence would break into simpering
cooing and a brief smatter of applause.
Such behavior may be appropriate at
the Simon and Garfunkel reunion, but
is out of place with rock's latest Angry
Young Man.
Furthermore, they reacted out of
scale to anything Elvis said or did. He

came to the microphone to introduce a
song, and the gang of sycophants met
his words with a roar of laughter.
Els is, pu/zled, asked "What's so
funny about 'Here's a song?' " Noth
ing, obviously, but the audience was
willing to believe that there was.
Worse, the audience was more in
terested in reacting to what Elvis did
than in listening to what he sang. Any
trademark gesture or nervous twitch
brought on a gale of laughter, some
thing that Elvis came to play upon.
Worst of all, there was committed the
unpardonable sin of the cult of Cos
tello: A large part of the audience

laughed during "Alison."
The crowd was more interested in
its affairs and its interaction with the
show than the act that was on stage.
This seems to lay a large portion of
blame upon the audience, but. frankly,
given the performance Elvis delivered
that night, I really couldn't blame the
crowd for losing interest.
Half the problem was just the diffi
culty in carrying off a one-man show.
Elvis is not a virtuoso guitarist, and
many of his songs sounded instrumen-
alike due to his technique of ac
companying himself mainly by simply
fretting the triad of the chord and
thrumming the bass notes.
The major complaint, the real
source of my discontent, lies in the fact
that I did not get to see Elvis Costello
that night. Instead of the last Angry
Young Man, we saw band leader Ross
McManus' son, having his night in the
spotlights with his arrangements ot
certain pop new-wave tunes.

HI vis consistently sang unwieldy
hybrid versions of his songs, throttled
by the inadequacy of solo perfor
mance and subverted and diminished
by the good-times atmosphere that
robbed the songs of their emotional
depth. As a younger man, he had said
that "songs can be so powerful —
people have forgotten that," but that
night he turned his back on the power
and worked on the shine of the polish,
the merest superficiality of the emo
tions he had once tapped.
I hat's not to say that the show had
no high points. On piano, Elvis
delivered moving versions of "Just a
Memory" and "High Fidelity," and,
despite the indifference of the crowd,
he carried out an extended finale on
"Alison."
Arguably the highest point came
after Elvis had played some highly for
gettable material on an electric piano,
mugging furiously as he did so. When
the laughter and the cheers reached
him he seemed to make a decision,
and he pounded his fist on the piano as
he left to perform a powerful version
of "Riot Act," the one example of the
passion of live performance lifting a
song above its normal level that the
show had to provide.
When Elvis brought out Burnett for
an encore, and they introduced them
selves as Hank and Harry, the Coward
Brothers, the evening hit rock bottom.
Some feeble country tunes and some
equally feeble guitar figures brought
the usual inexplicable explosion of en
thusiasm from the crowd. At this point
I felt I was sure that I wasn't watching
Elvis Costello but rather some tawdry
sociological phenomenon.
There was so very little of the power
and the depth that I had associated
with Elvis in that show. On the drive
to the concert my friend told me that
the night before he had seen old
footage of him, from the days of his
first album, and he noted he looked
angry and like he had a lot to prove to
someone. That night's show sprang
from something else entirely.
Elvis had once said he understood
only two emotions, guilt and the desire
for vengeance. Now he sings songs of
sorrow and self-pity — but under sor
row lies guilt and beneath self-pity is
the anger of having been wronged that
leads to vengeance. Perhaps not much
has changed, or perhaps everything
has.
When I first began listening to Elvis
Costello I was going through hard
times, my teenage years, and his songs
touched me with an eloquence and
purity unlike anything I had ever
heard or seen. Now, hard times having
become almost chronic, I came to his

show expecting the catharsis of days
past and am treated to buffoonery and
Elvis affectionately chiding his audi
ence like some elderly schoolmarm.
Elvis has matured. Those past days
he was angry and an almost elemental
force, but I doubt that he was very
happy. Now he may very well be as
happy as his stage persona that night
suggested, and I have no right to
begrudge him that happiness. But . . .
Joe Jackson has grown up, and
writes fragile songs of mellowed un
certainty. Paul Weller has abandoned
youthful righteousness for a sort of
premature pragmatic optimism. Al
most all the other bright lights of the
movement to "revolutionize" music
have sold out or, similarily, given up a
fight they know to be unwinnable.
Elvis was almost the only one left.
Was.
Now he's an entertainer, a happy
man with his first hit single under his

belt. He still bubbles over with ideas
and cleverness — a few of the new
songs seemed very good and will,
benefit from studio treatment — but
the fire in him seems to have gone out.
It's a terrible thing to be the last one
of your "crowd" to leave adolescence
and abandon the moral force of the
righteous young, but I'm just not yet
able to move on. Perhaps that's how
I'm behind the times, and maybe
that's why I hated a show many others
seemed to love.
Yet. the incandescent power and
purity of those emotions still attract
me. and Graham Parker remains a fel
low raging voice. He and I shall con
tinue our crusades for as long as we
can. for as long as we need to. and I
will keep my well-worn copies of My
Aim is True and This Year's Model
close at hand, and I shall keep my tar
nished image of the young Elvis Cos
tello foremost in mv mind.


Sometimes people get funny ideas.
Elvis Costello got it into his head to
perform a solo tour, without his excel
lent backing band, and single
handedly brave the crowds that a few
years ago he had chased out of the
theatres after his shows by blaring
white noise through the public address
system.
Said crowds fell into the curious be
havior of snapping up the tickets for
this tour as if they were ducats for the
Second Coming, and then received
Costello with a mixture of idoltry and
indulgence that would have embar
rassed the angel Gabriel.
This reviewer, in the face of the
deliriously happy crowds and the
glowing reviews of the concert
(notably The Daily, May 4), chooses
to lay his credibility upon the line and
attempt to explain why he hated
nearly every second of the show and
left the theater feeling cheated,
betrayed, and, most of all, severely
disappointed by Costello" s
"wonderful" show.
One could try to blame it all on high
expectations — being in such an inti
mate setting with him one would ex
pect to get to "know" him, and that
prospect, especially because he him
selt had spent such great time and ef
fort building up his aura of mystery,
seemed tremendously promising.
That wasn't the problem; actually,
Elvis did provide insight into his char
acter and his songs — once. One of his
songs, "Man Called Uncle," has al
ways been difficult to fathom. The
lines of the song, lor the most part,
hold up of themselves, but the overall
theme of the song escaped me.
Before beginning the song, the
second in his set, he announced that
this was a song set in a singles bar,
with a man alone, "staring into his
drink, thinking of his wife, of his kids
. . . and of the Man Called Uncle.' "

The crowd loved him. I had heard
he was chased from the stage in New
York — he seemed honestly surprised
by his reception here — and I am yet
unable to say what they saw in his act.
The crowd was otherwise eccentric.
As Elvis began each song, as soon as
the tune was recognizable the audi
ence would break into simpering
cooing and a brief smatter of applause.
Such behavior may be appropriate at
the Simon and Garfunkel reunion, but
is out of place with rock's latest Angry
Young Man.
Furthermore, they reacted out of
scale to anything Elvis said or did. He

came to the microphone to introduce a
song, and the gang of sycophants met
his words with a roar of laughter.
Els is, pu/zled, asked "What's so
funny about 'Here's a song?' " Noth
ing, obviously, but the audience was
willing to believe that there was.
Worse, the audience was more in
terested in reacting to what Elvis did
than in listening to what he sang. Any
trademark gesture or nervous twitch
brought on a gale of laughter, some
thing that Elvis came to play upon.
Worst of all, there was committed the
unpardonable sin of the cult of Cos
tello: A large part of the audience

laughed during "Alison."
The crowd was more interested in
its affairs and its interaction with the
show than the act that was on stage.
This seems to lay a large portion of
blame upon the audience, but. frankly,
given the performance Elvis delivered
that night, I really couldn't blame the
crowd for losing interest.
Half the problem was just the diffi
culty in carrying off a one-man show.
Elvis is not a virtuoso guitarist, and
many of his songs sounded instrumen-
alike due to his technique of ac
companying himself mainly by simply
fretting the triad of the chord and
thrumming the bass notes.
The major complaint, the real
source of my discontent, lies in the fact
that I did not get to see Elvis Costello
that night. Instead of the last Angry
Young Man, we saw band leader Ross
McManus' son, having his night in the
spotlights with his arrangements ot
certain pop new-wave tunes.

HI vis consistently sang unwieldy
hybrid versions of his songs, throttled
by the inadequacy of solo perfor
mance and subverted and diminished
by the good-times atmosphere that
robbed the songs of their emotional
depth. As a younger man, he had said
that "songs can be so powerful —
people have forgotten that," but that
night he turned his back on the power
and worked on the shine of the polish,
the merest superficiality of the emo
tions he had once tapped.
I hat's not to say that the show had
no high points. On piano, Elvis
delivered moving versions of "Just a
Memory" and "High Fidelity," and,
despite the indifference of the crowd,
he carried out an extended finale on
"Alison."
Arguably the highest point came
after Elvis had played some highly for
gettable material on an electric piano,
mugging furiously as he did so. When
the laughter and the cheers reached
him he seemed to make a decision,
and he pounded his fist on the piano as
he left to perform a powerful version
of "Riot Act," the one example of the
passion of live performance lifting a
song above its normal level that the
show had to provide.
When Elvis brought out Burnett for
an encore, and they introduced them
selves as Hank and Harry, the Coward
Brothers, the evening hit rock bottom.
Some feeble country tunes and some
equally feeble guitar figures brought
the usual inexplicable explosion of en
thusiasm from the crowd. At this point
I felt I was sure that I wasn't watching
Elvis Costello but rather some tawdry
sociological phenomenon.
There was so very little of the power
and the depth that I had associated
with Elvis in that show. On the drive
to the concert my friend told me that
the night before he had seen old
footage of him, from the days of his
first album, and he noted he looked
angry and like he had a lot to prove to
someone. That night's show sprang
from something else entirely.
Elvis had once said he understood
only two emotions, guilt and the desire
for vengeance. Now he sings songs of
sorrow and self-pity — but under sor
row lies guilt and beneath self-pity is
the anger of having been wronged that
leads to vengeance. Perhaps not much
has changed, or perhaps everything
has.
When I first began listening to Elvis
Costello I was going through hard
times, my teenage years, and his songs
touched me with an eloquence and
purity unlike anything I had ever
heard or seen. Now, hard times having
become almost chronic, I came to his

show expecting the catharsis of days
past and am treated to buffoonery and
Elvis affectionately chiding his audi
ence like some elderly schoolmarm.
Elvis has matured. Those past days
he was angry and an almost elemental
force, but I doubt that he was very
happy. Now he may very well be as
happy as his stage persona that night
suggested, and I have no right to
begrudge him that happiness. But . . .
Joe Jackson has grown up, and
writes fragile songs of mellowed un
certainty. Paul Weller has abandoned
youthful righteousness for a sort of
premature pragmatic optimism. Al
most all the other bright lights of the
movement to "revolutionize" music
have sold out or, similarily, given up a
fight they know to be unwinnable.
Elvis was almost the only one left.
Was.
Now he's an entertainer, a happy
man with his first hit single under his

belt. He still bubbles over with ideas
and cleverness — a few of the new
songs seemed very good and will,
benefit from studio treatment — but
the fire in him seems to have gone out.
It's a terrible thing to be the last one
of your "crowd" to leave adolescence
and abandon the moral force of the
righteous young, but I'm just not yet
able to move on. Perhaps that's how
I'm behind the times, and maybe
that's why I hated a show many others
seemed to love.
Yet. the incandescent power and
purity of those emotions still attract
me. and Graham Parker remains a fel
low raging voice. He and I shall con
tinue our crusades for as long as we
can. for as long as we need to. and I
will keep my well-worn copies of My
Aim is True and This Year's Model
close at hand, and I shall keep my tar
nished image of the young Elvis Cos
tello foremost in mv mind.
