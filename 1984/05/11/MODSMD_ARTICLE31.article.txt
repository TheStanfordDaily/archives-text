# 'Crimes of the Heart' a warm, funny show

### MARC FAJER 
The Stanford Theater began
wluit (hey refer as "A new tradi
tion in quality entertainment"
Wednesday night with a warm
and enjoyable production of
Beth Henley's Pulitzer Prize
winning comedy, "Crimes of the
Heart." Though the show has
some limits, overall it was pleas
ant and funny, and seems a good
omen ol success for the attempt
to bring touring companies of
major plays within walking dis
tance ol the campus.
The play is about three sisters
from a family in a small South
ern town with more than a few
skeletons in its closets. The
youngest sister. Babe (Alexa
kenin). has just shot her hus
band. The middle sister, Meg
(Wesley Pfenning), who had
gone to Hollywood and failed to
become a singer, comes running
home in response to a telegram
from the oldest sister, Lenny
(Annalee Jeffries), a plain, shy
woman who has stayed at home
to care lor her sick grandfather.
The three must cope with the
shooting, their grandfather's
stroke, their merbearing status
conscious cousin Chick (Debbie
I cigh Jones), one of Meg's old
flames (Clary Roberts), and ulti
mately. with each other. The

crises of the play form a dark
background, and it is certainly
not clear that these people will
ever turn our very well, but that
only makes the small triumphs
that much more sweet, and the
laughter that much more poig
nant.
The production itself has
some problems. The first act
was flat and a little slow, though
the show picked up considerably
later on. The acting sty les of the
performers don't quite mesh

correctly. Pfenning's portrayal
of Meg seems very actressy
through the first two acts. This
may have been a deliberate
character choice, but it doesn't
work well with the homey,
slightly exaggerated styles of the
other two sisters. Roberts as her
ex-boyfriend has some of the
same over-polished quality
about him, and they are better
together than with any one else
on stage. In the third act. some
how. though, the artificial gloss
seems gone from Meg and the

three sisters seem more right to
gether.
Annalee Jeffries gives a very
appealing performance as
Lenny. She has mastered a se
ries of almost manic gestures
that she uses when emotionally
wrought (which is most of the
time) which go right to the edge
of being overdone without ever
quite getting there. Her
awkward galloping about the
stage cleverly evokes her
clumsiness at expressing herself
and is very effective. There are a
number of small things she does
— trying to put a birthday
candle on a cookie, cleaning up
after her sister, finally blowing
up at her cousin — that could
have been stereotypical and silly
and were touching instead. A
phone call toward the end of the
show with a male admirer was
especially deserving of note for
using odd mannerisms to good
advantage.
Alexa Renin has a terrific
childlike quality about her, and
you spend much of the play
wanting to hug her. Though she
is occasionally a bit cutesy, there
is such a genuine warmth in
everything she does that she can
be forgiven some excesses. Her
scenes with her lawyer (Gregory
Grove) who has a crush on her
are very funny and sweet.

though again sometimes a bit
overdone. Grove is quite good
as the young attorney with a
personal vendetta against
Babe's wounded husband.
When 1 saw "Crimes" on broad
way, the actor playing the
lawyer had made the part so
awkward and weird as to be ab
surd: here his odd movements
are much more believeable, and
instead of being just strange, the
character becomes cute (of
course two years of law school
may have changed my percep
tions of how weird a lawyer can
be and still be believable).
Debbie Leigh Jones as Chick is
the weakest link in the show.
She is all mannerisms and no
substance, though she attracts
enough dislike to be a useful foil
for the more appealing charac
ters anyhow.
Director Dale Rose has done
a generally good job of bringing
out the warmth and humor of
the play, though, as noted, the
first act could have been picked
up a bit. "Crimes of the Heart"
plays at the Stanford Theater on
University Avenue in Palo Alto
Tuesday through Sunday until
June 3rd (with reduced
matinees on the weekends).
Overall, this is an enjoyable
production despite its flaws, and
vou can't beat the commute.
