# Scorpions fall flat at the Cow Palace concert
## 
### DEAN AVARY 
It vou'\c been walking down your
dorm hallwav humming " Rock You I ike
a Hurricane" recently, don't be
surprised. It's just what the Scorpions
have been trying to accomplish for more
than 10 years.
With tyvo shows at the Cow Palace last
Sunday and Monday, a hit album (Love
hi hirst Sting) and a liit sting, the) are un
doubtedly at the top of the rather short
list of non-Anglo American heavy-metal
groups who have made it big tin the
I 'nited States.
One has to admire their persistence. It
was only after nine albums that their hit
"No One like You" got them any signif
icant airplay in the United States. The)
followed the release of Blackout with a
grueling eight-month U.S. tour in l l )N2-
|S >3. finishing with a performance in last
year's US Festival — later seen in seg
ments .ill oyer the country on the pay-TV
nctyvork Showtime.
With their considerable success
recently, it yyas with anticipation that I
went to the concert last Monday

Bon Jm i. a new band from New York,
opened up the evening with its unique
brand of generic pop-rock. It bands like
this are the future of rock "n" roll in the
United States, then I'm officially de
pressed. Groups these days think they
can steal e\er\ prop from e\er\ rock
band: boots, ripped shirts, trick) lighting,
scarves on microphones, spandex. the
obligator) spread legs and that's it. Well,
that's not it.
Bands like Bon Jo\ i are signed on how
the\ look, and how the) perform in small
clubs. The trouble is that when the)'re
plopped in front of 12.000 people, the)
just don't pan out. It takes a larger-than
life talent to till big halls — names like
Jagger. Bowie and Roth come to mind —
designer haircuts and one hit song
(■•Runawa)") jlist aren't enough. It Bon
Jo\i relied on ever) rock cliche in the
book, the Scorpions came too close for
comfort in doing the same thing.
Though their awesome high-tech stage
set looked like it came from an MT\
video, the Scorpions fell flat on their
faces in man) other areas The first and
most ob\ ious was an aw lui s<uind mix tor

the lirst half of the show. What was
refreshing is that they didn't feel
obligated to shatter any eardrums — at
least until the last four songs.
A second annoying aspect was singer
Klaus Meine's pumping of the audience.
Perhaps it shouldn't be held against him.
tor he is of foreign tongue, and "San
Francisco" are rather easy words to
pronounce, but saying them incessantly
during and in betyveen songs begins to
drive one crazy. Though one must
admire his powerful voice, the fact that
he is balding, short and not much of a
showman didn't help matters much
either.
The showmanship of the rest of the
band y\as questionable as well. e.g.
guitarist Rudolph Schenker resorted to
bopping up and doyy n like a boob most of
the time.
I he highlight was Mathias Jabs, the
burning lead guitarist, who. decked out
in Ins yellow and black striped outfit,
stole the shoyy . Jabs has become famous
for his incredible four-bar solo on the
IWS2 hit No One I ike You." and his

playing Monday night was powerful and
clean, injecting life into otherwise murky
musicianship.
Herman Rarebell's drum solo was one
you'd heard a thousand times before, but
the crowd screamed nonetheless. Per
haps perceptive critique is too much to
expect from a bunch of half-wasted
teenagers, but there really is a difference
between jokers like Rarebell and an art
ist like John Bonham.
Things picked up a bit after the drum
solo, with the band playing tighter and
better than before, helped also b\ their
hits "Dynamite" and"The /oo." which
had the longest ending I've heard in m\
life. I really wanted to like the Scorpions,
but they relied on too many long
established formulas to excite. You can
scream "San Francisco" and spread your
legs so many times, until the burning
question at a concert becomes: "Who is
your lighting designer?" The Scorpions
can write some good songs, and have a
master m Mathias Jobs, but will they
ever be more than just another heavy -
metal band .
