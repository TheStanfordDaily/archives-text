# Gang unpleasant, sweaty experience
## 
### MICHAEL RYAN 
Not that we're Gang of Four groupies or anything, but let's
tace it, we did have the absolute best spots in the house —
right up front.
Anyway, my companion and I only got these places be
cause of Felix and his Kats. So, just who are these K;its
anyway? Well, they were the warmup band and they didn't
evoke much audience response. Being the rebels that we are,
however, both of us just had to react. We did so by being two
of the very, very few who got out and danced. Not that these
cats simply yowled, but hey, the crowd was boring. Let's just
say that we had a good time dancing to the Kats' music, al
though nothing memorable sticks in our minds. Except that
when the time came, we both moved in for the killer standing
spots.
But back to the nitty gritty or Jon (a.k.a., the lead singer)
almost hits me on the head with a microphone and he sweats
on my companion. Well, frankly the beginning of the show
lagged. The Gang seemed as though this last concert was
merely a job. Even the better known hit, "I Love a Man in a
Uniform, elicited very little response. Mainlv, the group just
breezed through such songs as: "We Live as We Dream
Along." "Silver Lining" and "Paralyzed." At this point, we
were both tired, unhappy and feeling dejected. After all we
were being sweat upon by everyone around us and the girl
with the strange red hair was breathing smoke like a dragon
(and also kicking me in the knees).
Just when we thought our review was down the tubes, we
both had a sudden physical realization. Namely, the crowd
was beginning to move. The repercussions had tapped the
band's energy; they realized that we wanted to dance. So to
the tribal rhythm ot "Is It Love?" the crowd swayed, pogoed
and made what could have been mistaken as sexual advances
upon the front row (e.g., us!) Then they followed with
"Damaged Goods." which led to even more sweating— to
our disgust.
The first encore, of which there were three (such a deal!).
John, Sarah and Andy the drummer was very festive: hey, this
was their last show. So. during the next two encores, the Gang
improvised on "Please See Me Evening and Weekends,"
"Ulcer' and "Essence Rare." Andy, the man with angst.
even did some very fine acoustic work with a bottle ot
Heineken beer (for you a\ id fans). Despite the Freudian sym
bolism. the specific piece was extremely dramatic and had
overtures of the spirited artiste.
However, now the front of the pack really became wild. In
other words, besides being splashed with beer, we were now
being mauled as the crowd decided to climb over our heads to
bid their farewells to the Gang. You may now think that we
were unhappy because of this activity: just the opposite, we
were surprised to see the humor in this group who was calling
it quits after an extensive tour (complete with cynicism. witty
lyrics and inspired stage movements). Jon was swirling wildly .
Andy was panting anxiously all over and Sarah was even
smiling. Finally, the Gang announced its last song thanking
every one tor their support.
We'd like to conclude by saying that we immediately raced
backstage and partied with the Gang — hut we didn't. In
stead. we drove back home to The Farm, bruised, tired and
drenched with others sweat, hack (sigh) to the homework
which anxiously awaited our return.
Ah well, our dreams of being rock stars will just have to
wait until the next Concert. We'll alert The Daily with details:
after all. where else can you go after being at the verv front of
the stage?
