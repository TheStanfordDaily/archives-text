# Billy Joel stands accused
## 
### MIKE HALE 
I said to her. as apologetically as I
could, "Well, I have these friends who
like Billy Joel and they bought tickets.
Not that you'd like Billy Joel, of
course, but . . ."
'Billy Joel? Yes! When?"
Last Saturday, as it happened. Bad
mouthing Billy Joel is a tricky business
— you can't dismiss someone who
sells out the Oakland Coliseum
Arena, or. when he's closer to home,
can sell out six straight nights at
Madison Square Garden. And there's
more to it than his drawing power. If
you're a middle-class, white Stanford
student, your friends will probably
join you in sneering at Van Halen; but
when you make fun of Billy Joel,
chances are they'll break their copy of
Glass Houses over your head. Nor
mally sane people get a little bug-eyed
at the thought of him. Last Saturday 1
sat amid 14.000 of the faithful, and.
while they screamed their heads off,
pondered it all. Yes, he writes catchy
tunes. Yes, he's made himself into a
good pop singer. Yes, he puts on (can
afford to put on) a great stage show.
But really. Hilly Joel'? Why is this ter
minal lightweight such a big deal? And
why do people of taste in every other
respect get misty-eyed at the sound of
(depending on how old they arc) "Just
the Way You Are" or "My Life" or
"Still Rock 'n' Roll to Me"?
Billy Joel has been recording for 1 1
years, and his superstar status is espe
cially hard to figure for those of us
whose memory stretches back to
1973's Piano Man. Joel's original per
sona (the one played on in the title of
the just-completed tour, "From a

piano man to an innocent man" ) was
that ol the long-haired, sensitive,
whining poet, very much in the style of
Harrv Chapin, who had had his tirst
hit the year before. The title song
made the charts, but there was no hint
of the self-assured pop stylist who
would have to sing with stage-charging
teenagers draped around his neck 1 I
years later. Joel stayed in the sub-
Dylan poet mode for two more,
progressively less successful, albums,
then hit it big with The Stranger and its
five hit singles in 1977. The rest is, as
they say, history, except that Joel is
still making it: Here we are in 1984,
and Joel has a million-selling album,
two top-10 singles and a sold-out, 20-
city concert tour to his credit.
In retrospect, the popularity of The
Stranger isn't surprising. To start with,
Joel completely retooled his image
and his sound: He brought in a new
producer, began to exploit his melodic
gift, and adopted the deeper, rougher
singing voice he's used ever since. The
Stranger was also perfectly timed and
placed, connecting as it did the two
dominant pop styles of the late 19705.
On the one hand, it possessed the
smoothness and the hooks of disco,
which had just about peaked in 1977.
The latter half of the '70s were also
the apotheosis of mainstream Ameri
can white rock (Bruce Springsteen's
Born to Run and Darkness on the
Edge of Town, Bob Seger's Night
Moves. Jackson Browne's Running on
Empty and Tom Petty's Damn the
Torpedoes all came out during this
period), and from it Joel took his
"angry young man" pose and song
writing style. Joel fulfilled a need: He

was whiter than disco and less n«is\
(i.e.. threatening) than Springsteen
The success of The Stranger isn't hard
to understand: what is hard to grasp
Joel's staving power. The big disci'
groups — Earth. Wind and Fire, the
Bee Gees — were gone within a yeai
or two; Springsteen and Segei and
Browne and Petty are still around, but
all had their commercial peaks in the
late '70s. Joel has had a hit album
nearly every year since, including the
current top-five Innocent Man.
Critics trying to explain away Joel's
success — and most do try — accuse
him of never being more than, or less
than, fashionable. This belabors the
obvious; the only constants in Joel's
music are his infernally catchv
melodies and his ingratiating voice,
and each album has presented these in
whatever mode seemed best calcu
lated at the time to be popular. When
the country was depressed in 1982.
Joel put out an album of social
problem anthems (The Nylon Curtain:
this was the same year Springsteen
canic out with Nebraska): now that
we're happy again and in the midst of
a '50s- and "60s-music nostalgia craze,
he's done a complete about-face and
released an album full of close imita
tions of early pop styles: a doo-wop
song, a Frankie Valli song, a Phil
Spector song. But pop has just as
much to do with style as it does with
music, and you can't really blame Joel
for always managing to be up-to-date;
and since no one else has managed it
as well as he, you can't really dismiss
him on that basis, either. If it were
possible to stay on top for seven years
in pop music by always coming in just
behind the latest fashions, other
people would have done it. Billy Joel
may be a chameleon, but his hold on
his audience is due to whatever he's
hiding under the changing skin.

The other truism about Billy
Joel is that he has nothing in
particular to say — that
there's nothing under the
skin (or behind the wrap
around shades, added for the

Innocent Man tour). But the
sight of 14,000 neat, well
!), behaved young white

c -
folks all making the trip
into south Oakland
last Saturday made
me think that Billy
Joel does have some-

thing to say, something this
particular group wanted to
hear; that he's been saying it
all along, or at least since The
Stranger, and that it accounts
for the millions of albums
he's sold over the last seven
years.
The great artists of the last

25 years ol American popular music
have based their appeal on making
voung people feel like they belong —
that the group of people who listen to
.i particular kind of music is a group
worth belonging to. In rock music, the
group was always meant to be a small
one. and rock's individual stars —
Irom Presley to Hendrix to Dylan to
Springsteen — have defined belonging
m terms of not belonging, of being
against whatever served as the
"establishment" at the time. When a
majority ol young people want the
excitement of feeling like they're in
the minority, an Elvis Presley or a
Bruce Springsteen can become famous
and sell a lot of records: but there's a
difficult balance to maintain, and
Presley fell off of one side — he sold
out — while Springsteen is always slip
ping off the other — he's a little too
dark, a little too threatening, and his
last album didn't sell. Presley found
paradise on the other side: he became
an even bigger star when he was
adopted by the establishment. Billy
Joel hasn't sold out — he sincerely
believes he's a rocker — but he has
found the perfect solution for the
1980s, l ie manages to act like a rebel,
sell a lot of albums, and still be taken
seriously by everyone but us purists,
by appealing to the largest group of
young people there is these days:
those who don't want to take sides,
those who know they're going to end
up in the establishment, but would
rather not think about it for the time
being.
For proof, look at the only Billy Joel
songs that arc really about anything,
the ones on The Nylon Curtain. "But
they never taught us what was
real/Iron and coal, chromium
steel/And we're living here in Allen
town." Joel managed to write a song
about unemployment that didn't even
address what caused it, or what could
be done about it; it just said, "Here it
is, and isn't this a pretty song?" And 1
can't improve on Dave Marsh's indict
ment of "Goodbye Saigon"; it is
incredible that someone could live
through the '60s and not have an
opinion about the Vietnam War, espe
cially someone with the gall to write a
song about it.
Billy Joel is the poet of American
post-adolescence; in many of his
songs, he perfectly replicates the
amoral, unconnected high spirits of
(roughly speaking) our generation.
And those high spirits were on abun
dant display in Oakland last weekend.
As 1 said, Joel puts on a good show.
With the help of a crack band, he does
as good a job as anybody of replicating
his recorded sound; and he spends big
on lights and sound effects. And Joel
himself works hard all night, running

from one end of the stage to another,
playing to every section ol the arena.
Joel covered most of his career, from
"Piano Man" to "The Longest Time."
his latest single: and while there were
some surprising omissions — "The
Stranger." "She's Always A Woman."
"Anthony's Song" — every song he
did do was a hit. which is impressive
over the span of a two-hour show .
The show ran like clockwork: it was
a high-tech marvel, and nothing sym
bolized it better than the personal
computer sitting in the huge control
booth halfway down the floor — an
other sign that Billy Joel is in tune
with our generation in ways that other
singers just can't be. At a certain po nt
in the proceedings, just before Joel
broke into the " Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
ohs" of "Uptown Girl." the guards
who had been sitting in front of the
stage left and reappeared onstage. As
if this were a cue — which, of course,
it was — hundreds of kids rushed the
stage, turning the first 10 or 15 rows
on the floor into a mob scene. Soon
enough, they started crawling up on
stage, one or two at a time, and grab
bing for Joel, only to be carried off by

the seen rit\ thugs in a highls
choreographed minuet that went on
throughout the last third of the con
cert. It one of them reached Joel, she
(probably SO percent were female)
usually didn t quite know what to do:
the ritual had taken her this far. but it
let her dow 11 when she actually got her
hands on the singer: so. since vouim
people nowadays are too polite to
really grab someone while he's sing
ing. the young women at the concert
mostly contented themselves with kis
sing Joel on the cheek, or jumping up
and down with their arms around his
waist. Joel hardly missed a note.
The downside of Billy Joel's hold 011
his audience is that while he gets it
excited, he doesn't really make it feel
anything: and Billy Joel is successful
because that's precisely what people
have been wanting for a while now: to
get excited without anything being at
stake. It all goes back to taking sides:
Joel is right when he calls himself an
"innocent man." but only in a narrow,
negative sense — he's innocent only
because he's careful not to be guilty of
anything, such as inspiring someone
with a true emotion.



With or without
shades, he's no
innocent man
