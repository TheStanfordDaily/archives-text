Moscow on the Hudson
(1984)
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Or You Can't Go Home
Again. Robin Williams gives a
brilliant performance as a saxo
phonist with a Moscow circus
playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to
defect. On one level Paul
Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos)
deals with the movement from
repression to freedom, what
freedom implies and what its
constraints and contraditions
are; on another level it's a com
edy about the seductive appeal
of American decadence for Rus
sians (like Ninotchka was); cen
trally, though, it's about what
happens to a man who makes the
choice to cut himself off from
home and family forever. When
Mazursky's in high gear, few
directors can touch him: The
whole cast (Cleavant Derricks,
Maria Conchita Alonso, Tiger
Haynes, Savely Kramarov, Elya
Baskin, Alexander Beniaminov)
is marvelous, and sometimes
Mazursky engages so many emo
tional tracks simultaneously that
you can't analyze exactly which
element is affecting you most
profoundly.
• East of Eden (1955)
Kresge Auditorium
As Cal, John Steinbeck's
latter-day Cain, James Dean
gives perhaps the most neurotic
self-destructive-young-man per
formance of all time; everything
he does is too much, yet he's
brilliant, and you can't get him
out of your head. Another great
Actors Studio presence plays op
posite him — Julie Harris. The
playwright Paul Osborn adapted
the Steinbeck novel (or a slice of
it), and Elia Kazan — who else?
— directed. Raymond Massey,
Jo Van Fleet and Richard
Davalos play the Adam, Eve and
Abel counterparts; with Burl
Ives and Albert Dekker.
Plays tonight at 9.
El Norte (1984)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Two young Guatemalans,
brother and sister, whose village
has been wiped out by the army,
use their godmother's pitiful
savings to travel into Mexico and
— illegally — into California,
the land of promise the
Guatemalans call "el norte"
("the north"). The story is an
authentic tragedy, and one
admires Gregory Nava, the
director, and his wife. Anna
Thomas, the screenwriter (they
co-produced the picture), for
their persistence in working on a
project of such questionable
commercial potential. But devo
„ tion and integrity and right**
mindedncss don't necessarily
produce good movies, and £7
Norte is an enervating one,
featuring those noble peasant
■icons who have been with us
since the intellectuals of the left
invented them in the 19305,
/aide Silvia Guitierrez and
David Vallalpando play the im-
I migrants.

Animal House (1978)
Memorial Auditorium
It has a few very funny gags,
but it does go on. Given the set
ting — a small college in 1962 —
John Landis' movie barely
scratches the surface potential
for parody, though the best
scene, at a neighboring women's
school called Emily Dickinson
College, where all the
have long brown hair and names
like Fern Leibowitz and Shelley
Dubinsky, is worthy of Woody
Allen. Aside from that, the best
reason to see the movie is John
Belushi. (Donald Sutherland has
an amusing cameo as a stoned
professor.) Harold Ramis,
Douglas Kenney and Chris Mil
ler wrote the script, and Elmer
Bernstein, trying painfully hard
to be playful, came up with the
score. With Thomas Hulce, Tim
Matheson, John Vernon, Verna
Bloom and Peter Riegert.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
The Last Supper (1978)
Cubberley Auditorium
Tomas Gutierrez Alea, the
Cuban filmmaker, made this
brilliant parable on the themes
of hypocrisy and betrayal. The
protagonist is a count (Nelson
Villagra, in a witty, subtle per
formance), owner of a sugar
plantation in the late 18th cen
tury. During Easter Week, he
stages a Last Supper, casting
himself as Christ and inviting 12
slaves chosen at random, whose
feet he washes _ and whose
stomachs he fills. When one of
them, a failed runaway recover
ing from the torture he received
on his return, spits in the count's
face, the count strikes a pose of
offended righteousness and,
likening the slave to Judas Is
cariot, recites solemnly, "I
washed you, but there is one
among you who is not yet
clean." Alea collaborated with
Maria Eugenia Hoya and Tomas
Gonzalez on the script, and
Mario Garcia Joya's photogra
phy suggests, alternately, Italian
Renaissance frescoes and the
paintings of Rembrandt.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Wages of Fear (1953)
Cubberley Auditorium
In Henri-Georges Clouzot's
famous suspense thriller — four
men stuck in a crummy South
**Wf»efltshn town because of lack
of funds agree to an American
oil company's offer of $2000
apiece to drive trucks full of
nitroglycerin over crude country
roads (in order to combat an oil
fire). The treatment of the care
less Americans is transparent,
but the rest of the movie is
breathtaking: wound tight, laid
out with exactitude, and almost

unbearably tense. The film sug
gests Camus energized by a first
rate action director, and the
opening scenes in the sleepy
town are like the early scenes in
Huston's Treasure of the Sierra
Madre. The drivers are played
by Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli,
Peter Van F.yck and the young
Yves Montand, who has the
presence of a new Jean Gabin.
(Clouzot includes a tribute to
Gabin's greatest role, Pepe Le
Moko■ ) Stunningly shot by Ar
mand Thirard, and co-starring
Vera Clouzot (in an ill
conceived role).
Plays Monday evening at 8.
Song of the l hin Man (1947)
Festival. Palo Alto
Edward Buzzell directed the
last of the Thin Man series,
which had begun 13 years ear
lier. By this time Nick and Nora
Charles' son Nicky is 10 or so
(and played by Dean Stockwell),
and they still have Asta. Myrna
Loy looks a little worn, and
William Powell doesn't appear
to be in the pink of health — he's
put on some weight, and when
you look closely, his face is al
most glaceed. The movie does
have its virtues: It's well shot,
the climactic episode is neatly di
rected, and the swing music (it's
set in a nightclub milieu) gives it
some badly needed energy,
Also, it has the usual motley
cast. Philip Reed is murdered,
and the list of suspects includes
Gloria Grahame as a singer*
Don Taylor as an alcoholic
musician who goes off the deep
end for her love (there's actually
a scene in a mental institution),
Leon Ames, Jayne Meadows,
Ralph Morgan. Keenan Wyrtn
(spouting jazz lingo) and Patricia
Morison, who looks like a sexy
Agnes Moorehead. (This film
was made just a year before she
starred on Broadway in Kiss Me,
Kate.)
Plays through Wednesday
with The Thin Man Goes Home.

an Academy Award, which
means that his big scenes are
| slowed down and seem a little
overrehearsed and dried out.
Besides, this movie makes him
as noble as a Frank C'apra hero,
and that doesn't give him much
to play. Mamet has provided
some nice roles, however, for
James Mason, Jack Warden and
Julie Bovasso.
Plays Tuesday with Silkwood.
Romancing the Stone (1984)
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
A very entertaining adventure
spoof about a successful writer
of romantic novels who finds
herself swept up in a more elab
orate, more implausible plot
than any of her own devising.
Diane Thomas wrote some ter

rific dialogue; Robert /emeckis,
the director, employs his camera
as a jokester narrator, setting up
and unfolding the story and
punctuating it with visual punch
lines. The picture is a beauty:
Dean Cundey, the photog
rapher, has shot the jungle
scenes (filmed on location in
Mexico) with a nearly hyperbolic
vividness and clarity, and
Zemeckis gives the adventure
sequences the deluxe treatment.
With the gifted comedienne
Kathleen Turner, Michael
Douglas (who tries but doesn't
quite fill the Harrison Ford-style
hero role), and Danny DeVito as
a hilariously foreshortened
comic villain.

Splash (1984)
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
This sparkling comedy-fantasy
about a romance between a nice
young New Yorker (Tom
Hanks) and a mermaid (Daryl
Hannah) who complicates —
messes up and enriches — his
life bears some resemblance to
the 1943 musical One Touch of
Venus. The writers (Lowell
Ganz, Babaloo Mandel and
Bruce Jay Friedman, adapting a
story by producer Brian Grazer)
and the director (Ron Howard)
have given the film a completely
formed narrative shape, from its
sepia-tinted black and white
prologue to its Brigadoon end-,
ing. ft has its sentimental side,
but Howard provides an unusual
tone: sweetly dazed. And watch
ing it, you become infected by it
— you feel as if someone had
knocked you lightly on the head

or spun you around a little too
fast. With Eugene I.evy as an
obsessed scientist and the irre
pressible John Candy as lorn
Hanks' brother; Candy is so un
reasonably hilarious that you
start laughing whenever he
shows up in anticipation of what
lie's going to do.
Rear Window (1954)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's celebrated
thriller, out of distribution for
years, is so expertly tooled and
so absorbing that you come out
of the theater grinning — despite
the talky script (John Michael
Hayes, out of a Cornell Wool
rich story) and almost unrelieved
bad acting in the supporting
roles. (Thelma Ritter is the
shining exception.) James
Stewart, an unlikely casting
choice, plays an adventurous
photojournalist who, laid up for
six weeks with a broken leg.
resorts to the endlessly interest
ing activity of watching his
neighbors through a pair of high
powered binoculars. All the vig
nettes are cliches, so Hitchcock
introduces them in a big
Broadway-musical-style opening
on the movie's single set, and
throughout the film he employs
them as interludes, numbers.
With Grace Kelly and Raymond
Burr.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with The Man Who Knew
Too Much (1934).
The Man Who knew 100
Much (1934)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock filmed this
story twice: in 1934 with Leslie
Banks and Edna Best, and again
in 1956 with Jimmy Stewart and
Doris Day. The American ver
sion is longer and livelier; this
earlier British picture is a bit
stiff, with some rigged pictorial
effects. But the ballroom murder
and the Albert Hall sequence
are cleverly shot, and Banks has
a peculiar charm — robust (he
looks a little like Robert Morley)
yet reserved. Peter l.orre and
Pierre Fresnay show up.
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with IRear Window.
Aguirre, the Wrath of God
(1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wertxr Herzog's austere epic
about fhe fate of a Spanish ex
pedition in Peru is very tough
going, because he has absolutely
no sensft of pacing — before you
first glattce at your watch, you
don't kno\* whether you've been
watching foi 20 minutes or 90.
And he pays gcuelling attention
to gruesome details (a few of
which are actually funny, in a
Teutonic sort of way). He's an
amazing image-maker, though,
and the film — unlike
Fitzcarraldo, which came five
years later — is worth the en
durance test. As Aguirre, Klaus
Kinski is malevolent in a surreal
way, like Cherkassov in Ivan the
Terrible.
Plays Wednesday with The
Mystery vf Kaspar Hauser.
