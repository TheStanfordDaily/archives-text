# Former engineer criticizes industry

### NANCY RAFF 
Members of the Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy have received illegal
political contributions from major oil
companies. Peter Faulkner, a former
nuclear engineer said in a talk at
Storey House Wednesday night.
Faulkner, who was fired from the
nuclear industry because of his tes
timony to the Senate Committee on
Government Organizations in 1974
about the lack of professionalism and
safety precautions in nuclear reactors,
claimed that the oil companies wished
to structure the industry such that
their uranium supplies would be used
in nuclear reactors.
After World War 11. Faulkner said,
major oil companies tried to
monopolize the future uranium mar
ket, not anticipating the possible use
of plutonium in the industry.
"Since most members of the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy, includ
ing (Sen.) Howard Baker (R-Tenn.),
received illegal contributions from the
major oil companies, a large part of
the legislation concerning the nuclear
industry could be challenged as being
retroactively unconstitutional because
it was formulated under undue influ
ence," Faulkner said.
"The public needs to skeptically and
rigorously question new technology
and challenge representative govern
ment," Faulkner said.
Faulkner's testimony on the indus
try before the Senate committee was
backed by evidence obtained by
breaking into a safe at the Potomac
Electric Power Company. His tes
timony attempted to change "an un
fortunate condition in America where
new technology is not criticized or
questioned." he said.
The post-World War 11 race be
tween General Electric and Westing
house for the nuclear reactor market
resulted in the design and construction
of reactors that were not adequately
tested or examined, staffed with
second-rate engineers who were not

able to participate in the more
glamorous NASA program or the
Vietnam War weapon design, accor
ding to Faulkner.
The nuclear power industrv should
have been nationalized In the govern
ment. using smaller, standardized re
actors with rigorous controls.
Faulkner said, but the structure ol the
industry prevented such a move.

Questions new technology
Faulkner's interests have expanded
to the entire question of nuclear weap
ons, he said. "Nuclear weapons are
not the real problem," Faulkner said,
"but rather control and the larger
question of militarism itself." He fears
the spread of germ and genetic
warfare, attesting that these weapons
better suit the Soviet war aims of
leaving one continent intact after a
weapon exchange.
He doubts that there will be a nu
clear war within the next 20 years, hut
thinks it "likely after 2010 after all the
people who have actually experienced
the use of nuclear weapons have
died," he said. Faulkner sees future
generations as "being curious about a
world war after reading so much about
them" and also holding a mentality of
war as equivalent to playing a video
game.
