# C-US hears debate on theme houses
## 
### DAVID RISSER Staff writer 
Members of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (C-US), which
recently released a report that in
cluded a proposal to exclude freshmen
from ethnic theme houses, defended
the committee's decisions in a meeting
with about 50 theme house residents
and other students yesterday at
Ujamaa.
According to Carolyn Lougee, asso
ciate dean of Humanities and Sciences
and a member of the committee, "The
basic premise of the (C-US) report
was not the idea that all freshmen
should live together.
"The drive showed a desire on the
C-US's part to have strong theme
houses. The basic premise of the
report was to implement theme houses
in which all members of the house are
committed to the theme," Lougee
said.
A "theme house made strong by the
significant interest of its participants"
was also stressed by University
Registrar Sally Mahoney, another
member of the C-US.
Those who voiced concerns to t+ie
committee members at yesterday's
meeting declared the proposed exclu
sion of freshmen incompatible with
the development of theme interest.
"Lack of interest from some people
is a problem in any residence. Solving
the interest problem by excluding
people who are interested in the
theme is a travesty," said senior Philip
Benson, a former resident of Ujamaa.
Other students expressed concern
over a lack of understanding and com
munication between the committee
and those whom its recommendations
will affect.
"We had a lot of opinions and ideas,
yet were not involved from the very
first," said senior Woody Ichiyasu, an
intern for Asian-American affairs in
the Office of Student Activities.
Ujamaa Resident Fellow Ron Hud
son said he felt that his and other RFs'
concerns were not adequately consid
ered in the committee's report.
"The report reflects little of the
concerns of RFs in the theme houses.
Communication channels were open,
but when the report came out I was
embarrassed. It was not a reflection of
our sentiments in our meeting with the
C-US," Hudson said.

demic component of the theme
houses.
According to the C-US report.
"Serious Academic disadvantages
could arise it freshmen were placed in
four-class houses not large enough to
have a critical mass of freshmen for
satisfactory advising or house-based
freshman courses."
Questioned about what number of
freshman students constitutes a
"critical mass," C-US chairman Prof.
Bruce Parker did not give a numerical
answer. "It is hard to (determine) the
definite number of freshmen desired."
he said.
"There has to be a range, a suffi
ciently large variety of academic inter
ests represented," Mahoney said.
"Twenty freshmen or so is too small."
Committee members stressed the
difficulty of providing a meaningful
academic experience and advising sys
tem for a small number of freshmen in
one residence.
According to Parker, "The issue is
not that academic opportunities do
not exist in the theme houses, in fact
they may exist to a larger extent. It is
an issue of freshman orientation. I
hope we stressed the importance of
theme activity in the overall life of the
campus."
Many of those present at the discus
sion argued that barring freshmen
from theme houses will weaken an
elusive "freshman experience" that
they feel concerns the committee un
duly.
"Most curricular concerns are in the
freshman year. We didn't fully realize
the importance of the (combination of
curricular concerns with housing ar
rangements)," Lougee said.
"We are not trying to say 'yes' or
"no' to the current theme system. The
sense of disagreement is on one issue
— the placement of freshmen. Our re
commendation was an outcome of a
desire to strengthen the existing pro
gram," Lougee said.
A desire of theme house residents
to have an independent food service
could only be answered with a row
house, committee members said. This
possibility, and the resulting decrease
in the number of freshmen in the
theme house, was a factor in recom
mending that freshmen not be as
signed to them.
Ichiyasu noted that the desire for
strong ethnic theme houses with fresh
men as an integral component "must
be understood in the context of the
lack of non-Western studies here."
Ichiyasu favors ethnic priority in
gaining access to ethnic theme
housing, while Lougee favors a
"commitment to the theme rather
than ethnic priority." she said.
Parker said an open meeting of the
C-US will soon he announced in which
all those interested in the ethnic theme
house issue may present their views to
