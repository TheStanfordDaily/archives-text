# Eatery recreates railroad
## 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
One hundred fifteen years after the
first golden spike was driven into the
soil on May 10, 1869, another one was
driven into a dinner table at the
Golden Spike Restaurant in Palo Alto
by owner Steve Schwartz.
The event commemorates the com
pletion of a fully operational, scale
model replica of the original transcon
tinental railroad, complete with scaled
historical points along the track's path
to mark the original locations through
which the train passed.
Schwartz, a Stanford graduate, said
the miniature "gives a sense of tribute
to Leland Stanford and his friends,
and also to all the Chinese and Irish
workers who gave their lives for the
original."
The train, which is the largest
known working model of its kind in
the world, features'such details as tun
nels, trestles, sound effects and mini
ature buildings and people along its
140 feet of track.
"You can't conceive of it until you
see it," said Schwartz. "As much as
possible, it's historically correct â€”
from the Sacramento station through
the Sierras to Promontory, Utah. It
was built completely from old photos
and historians' assistance."
The exhibit was created by a team
of model railroad engineers from San
Francisco, headed by Lee and Lauren
Irwin, said Schwartz. The project,
which was begun in January, has taken
more than 2400 hours of work and its
value is estimated at o\er $50,000.
Schwartz feels very strongly about
his new acquisition. "It's almost price
less." Schwartz said. "It's one of a
kind. We consider it a museum piece."
In describing its effect on the res
taurant. Schwartz said. "We've
created one of the most unique atmo
spheres in the Bay Area. We've added
an atmosphere that people won't get
any where else. We had an opportunity
to do something in a big way. and it
has reall\ worked out."
