Netherlands will not accept
full share of cruise missiles
Washington — A top Dutch official said yesterday that the
Netherlands will not accept its full share of 48 nuclear cruise
missiles, and he said the United States must be more under
standing of the need for compromise if any missiles are to be
deployed.
The comments of Jan van Houwelingen, second-ranking
official in the Dutch defense ministry, represent the clearest
statement yet of the Dutch position, and they will disappoint
the Reagan administration. U.S. officials fear that il the
Dutch fail to deploy their share of missiles. NATO's contro
versial plan to deploy 572 medium-range nuclear missiles in
five European countries will unravel.
"It is impossible to say that the only possibility is saying yes
to 4K cruise missiles," van Houwelingen, in Washington to
promote European arms sales, said in an interview in his hotel
room yesterday. "Then there is no result."
One administration official noted yesterday that van
Houwelingen, the state secretary for defense, is only one offi
cial in a divided coalition government. But a diplomatic
source, who said the Dutch government is "floundering" in its
search for a solution, said the Dutch parliament almost cer
tainly will not accept the 48 missiles without some compro
mise formula.
South Africa demands pact
Washington — President Ouett K.J. Masire of Botswana
said yesterday that South Africa is trying to force his tiny,
landlocked country to sign a "nonaggression pact" that could
harm its relations with fellow black African nations and sub
ject Botswana to reprisals from guerrilla groups fighting
South Africa.
Masire, here on a visit that included a meeting with Presi
dent Reagan, told editors and reporters that South Africa was
exerting heavy pressure for the pact despite Botswana's 18-
year record of not allowing insurgents opposing Pretoria's
white-minority rule to operate from its territory.
"We have never, ever allowed the freedom movements to
operate from our soil," Masire said in what appeared to be an
indirect plea for the United States to intercede with South
Africa to relieve the pressure.
"We are trying to use diplomatic sources available to us, in
cluding approaching other countries on this problem," he
said, adding that, in his talks here with U.S. officials, "we said
if we could use their offices (on this), we would be grateful."
State Department officials refused to discuss the matter
yesterday except to say that U.S. policy in southern Africa
aims at helping "the nations of the region live in peace with
their neighbors" and that Botswana "has a good record in
that regard."
Killer executed in Florida
Washington — James Adams, convicted of the 1973 mur
der of a wealthy rancher, was executed in Florida yesterday
morning after the U.S. Supreme Court, on a 5-4 vote,
lifted a stay of execution ordered by an appeals court hours
earlier.
The high court's decision, in a case involving allegations of
racially biased death-penalty laws, prompted one of the most
strongly worded dissents to date in an execution case by
Justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan. opponents
of capital punishment.
Marshall and Brennan said the court was in such a hurry to
see Adams executed that it refused to grant them another 24
hours to write "a more elaborate dissent." They called the
court's conduct "degrading to our role as judges."
The high court stayed an execution last December at the
request of an inmate raising issues of racial discrimination
identical to those raised by Adams.
Justice Byron White was the justice who voted differently
in the two cases — voting to delay the December execution
but to allow Adams to die yesterday. Neither White nor the
court majority offered an explanation for the difference in
handling the two cases.
Duarte leads in El Salvador
San Salvador — First official returns yesterday from the
presidential runoff elections show moderate Jose Napoleon
Duarte with a strong lead over ultra-rightist rival Roberto
d'Aubuisson.
The official returns released by the Central Election Coun
cil gave Duarte 59.8 percent and d'Aubuisson 40.2 percent in
returns from four of the nation's 14 provinces — including
San Salvador, where about 30 percent of the nation's eligible
voters live. It is a traditional Duarte stronghold.
D'Aubuisson withdrew his far-right Republican Nationalist
Alliance party from participation in the official count, charg
ing the U.S. State Department and the CIA of fraud, and said
he would win if illegal ballots were thrown out.
He claimed at a news conference Wednesday that his
party's tally shows he won 52 percent of the valid votes in
Sunday's runoff election to 48 percent for moderate Duarte, a
Christian Democrat.
Duarte claimed victory Monday, saying his party's figures
showed he won about 55 percent of the vote.
The United States has pushed hard for elections here but
denies it tried to influence the outcome.
HP releases mini-computer
Palo Alio — Hewlett-Packard Co., making another move
away from its traditional base of scientific and engineering
equipment, yesterday unveiled a notebook-size portable
computer it hopes will dominate a projected multi-billion dol
lar market for portables.
The battery-powered macbine, called simply "The Porta
ble." is aimed at the business executive and appears to be
among the most sophisticated in what is becoming a crowded
field of similar models.
The Portable weighs nine pounds and features a full-size
keyboard, flip-up screen with 16 lines of 80 characters each,
built-in software programs and a built-in modem to exchange
information through a telephone. It is priced at $2 995.
The Portable's 272,000 bytes of random access memory
are more than twice that supplied by most desktop personal
computers, the company said.
Complementing the Portable is a new, battery-powered 3-
inch disc drive, which can be used for additional memory or to
load optional software in the absence of a desktop computer.
Hewlett-Packard said it estimated sales of portable com
puters will increase from over 100,000 units in 1983 to more
than 5.5 million units worth billions of dollars in 1988.
