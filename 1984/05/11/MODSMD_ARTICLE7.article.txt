Washington — In a narrow victors tor President
Reagan, the House on yesterday passed a $ll).N hillion
foreign aid hill authorizing $255.9 million in military
aid and $913.4 million in economic aid tor Central
America in fiscal year 1985.
The bill was approved by a vote of 21 1-206. one cl;i>
after Reagan pleaded with Congress for its passage m a
speech to the nation on Central America.
For El Salvador alone, it would provide $132.5 mil
lion in military assistance and $290 million in economic
aid in fiscal 1955. as well as $49 million and $120 mil
lion. respectively, this year.
A Republican-sponsored amendment to the bill pro
vided an additional $129.3 million in military aid and
$363.7 million in economic aid to the region during fis
cal 1984.
The provision of funds for El Salvador in fiscal I l '*-'
was a reversal for the House, which has adamantly
refused Reagan administration requests for additional
military support for the war-divided nation.
During debate, Rep. William Broomfield (R-Mieh.)
— who sponsored the amendment whose adoption
presaged the bill's passage — read a letter from Reagan
that urged unrestricted support for Central America. In
the letter, Reagan warned that granting insufficient
help would only "prolong the bloody stalemate."
A surprise speaker for the Broomfield proposal was
House Majority Leader Jim Wright (D-Texas) who

won a standing ovation as he pleaded for help for El
Salvador's embryonic democracy. "Let's not let it be
stillborn." said Wright, an official observer of last Sun
day s presidential runoff election in El Salvador.
After the adoption of the Broomfield amendment by
a vote of 212-208. Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.)
employed a parliamentary maneuver to call for a
second, separate vote on the provision. This time, pas
sage was by an even narrower margin. 2 11-208.
Broomfield. during debate on his amendment,
warned his colleagues that "we are facing a communist
revolution in our own backyard." Quoting from
Reagan's speech Wednesday night, he said that the aid
bill as brought to the floor by the Democratic-led
House Foreign Affairs Committee would have pro
vided only enough aid to let El Salvador "slowly bleed
to death."
Broomfield, the Foreign Affairs Committee's
ranking Republican, attacked the restrictions the bill
placed on Salvadoran military and economic aid.
saying. " 1 he president must have flexibility in conduct
ing foreign policy."
Under the committee bill, presidential certification
would have been required on El Salvador's
"demonstrated progress" in negotiating with its politi
cal opponents, control over death squads, freeing of po
litical prisoners and land reform.
I he committee measure also ended the use of
presidential authority to supply emergency aid to El

Salvador without congressional approval — a proce
dure used by the White House to keep about $N() m j|.
lion in military aid flowing before Sunday's runoff elec
tion.
In contrast, the Broomfield amendment contained a
looser requirement that the president need only certify
that HI Salvador "has made progress" in achieving
these goals, and opponents of the proposal charged it
would remove pressure tor reform.
•We have said for four or live years that death
squads are of extreme importance to us. and we now
remove all restrictions.*' said Rep. George Miller (D-
Calif.) "We are taking away the tools for reform that
(newly elected Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon)
Duarte had in his hands."
In earlier debate. Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.) ap
pealed for backing 011 a more restrictive amendment
that he proposed that would have withheld varying
amounts of Salvadoran aid until it could be certified
that reforms had actually taken place — not just that
progress was being made. The amendment was
defeated 011 a vote. 2N7-12N.
The Republican-controlled Senate in March attached
$61.S million in military aid for F:l Salvador and $21
million to support CIA-funded covert operations in
Nicaragua to a House bill providing emergency drought
relief for Africa. The House bill adopted yesterday did
not include any funds for covert operations.
