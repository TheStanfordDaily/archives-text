The Hague, Netherlands (AP)
— The World Court yesterday
called on the United States to
stop military aggression aimed
at Nicaragua, including mining
its waters. The Sandinista gov

"moral victory."
The U.S. State Department

The 15-member panel ruled
unanimously that the United
States "should immediately
cease and refrain from any ac
tion restricting, blocking or en
dangering access to or from
Nicaraguan ports, and, in partic
ular, the laying of mines."
A second part of the decision,
which a U.S. judge opposed,
said that "the right to
sovereignty and to political in
dependence possessed by the
Republic of Nicaragua" should

be fully respected and not
jeopardized b\ military or
paramilitary activities.
The court, the judicial arm of
the United Nations, has no en
forcement powers and depends
on voluntary adherence to its
decisions.

terim measure sought by

deliberates Nicaragua's com
plaint that the United States
violated international law by
supporting anti-Sandinista
rebels and supervising the min
ing of Nicaraguan harbors.
The ruling, read by court

of Nigeria, called on both the
United States and Nicaragua to
avoid actions that could ag
gravate or extend their dispute.
U.S. representative Davis
Robinson declined comment.
