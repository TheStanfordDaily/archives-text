### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Democratic campaigning for the
California primary hit full force in
San Jose yesterday as the three
leading Democratic presidential
candidates, Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart, former Vice President Walter
Mondale and the Rev. Jessie Jack
son, attempted to win the votes of
California Hispanics.
Delegates from the Mexican
American Political Association
(MAPA) convened at the San Jose
Hyatt Hotel yesterday for an all
day national endorsing convention
during which each of the three can
didates presented a one-hour
speech. Hart was the keynote
speaker at the delegates' luncheon.
Mondale took the podium first
amid loud chants from Jackson
supporters, shouting, "Mondale
no, Jackson si!"
Mondale addressed the issues
dealing with Hispanics by announc
ing his support of bilingual educa
tion and promising presidential ap
pointments to Hispanics.
"By supporting bilingual educa
tion, student assistance and Title
1, I'm going to make sure that your
children are the best educated in
.(.the history.qf ourcountry,," he^aic),.
Mondale cited World War 11. the
Korean War arid Vietnam as' past
periods of Hispanic "over
representation." 1
"Why is it then that Hispanics
are underrepresented in the gov
ernment?" he asked. "I'm going to
be the president that brings
Hispanics into the White House,
onto the cabinet, into the judiciary
and into the Pentagon."
In response to a delegate's ques
tion on how Mondale would deal
with the increase in poor women
and children, Mondale outlined
five proposals, ignoring a heckler
swho yelled, "Put them in the Pent
r\~. *
agon!"
- Mondale said women might be
helped through an increase in
available jobs, strong enforcement
sOf civil rights laws and a policy
equal pay for comparable
effort.
Mondale also stressed the role of

government programs in discrimi
nation against women.
"Day care, school lunches and
medicaid are programs which
helped working women, and they
have all been eliminated or cut," he
said. "And even after women
retire, they are now discriminated
against through pensions, insur
ance and social security."
"Finally, we need to ratify the
Equal Rights Amendment," he
said. "That will at last provide a
chance to enforce your rights in the
courts of law."
While Mondale's MAPA appeal
concentrated on issues of un
employment and welfare, Jackson's
speech dealt primarily with
minority issues and Central
America.
"The Black and Hispanic devel
opment is parallel," Jackson said.
"One group enslaved against its
will ... the other annexed against
its will."
Jackson garnered by far the most
favorable reaction from the audi
ence. appealing to MAPA as part
of his Rainbow Coalition. Jackson
went on to say that programs cut by
the Reagan administration "have
been victims of a systematic effort
to reward the rich and,,punish, the
poor."
"In this campaign, fhdre are
three candidates, but there are two
directions," he said. "First, there's
the Hart-Mondale direction which
offers increased defense spending,
resultant inflation and escalating
unemployent."
Jackson said that Hart and
Mondale would lead the Demo
cratic Party in the same direction as
the Reagan-led Republican Party,
except at a slower pace.
"The option I'm offering calls for
a 20 percent decrease in military
spending, a truly progressive
income tax and a recommitment to
bilingual education," he said.
"The fact is most people in the
world are yellow and brown and
black and poor and don't speak
English," he said. "Our national
security is tied up to our ability to
speak other than the English lan
