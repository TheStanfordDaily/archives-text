Hart still in race — barely
Despite Colorado Sen. Gary Hart's demo
cratic presidential primary victories in Ohio
and Indiana last week, the number of
delegates left to be selected make it
impossible for him to win enough pledged
delegates to equal former Vice President Wal
ter Mondale's current delegate count.
With 1967 delegates needed for nomina
tion, Mondale had 1518 last week and Hart
XB6, according to United Press International.
Only 829 delegates remain to be selected in
the seven primaries and one caucus left.
However, Hart still has a shot at the nomin
ation, and attention is shifting to his efforts to
sway Mondale delegates who, under party
rules written after the 1980 convention, are
allowed to switch allegiances before the first
ballot.
Hart's new strategy relies on a series of
momentum-building primary wins and dele
gate maneuvers to swing convention delegates
away from Mondale.
Hart is currently pursuing officially uncom
mitted delegates and preparing a credentials
challenge to 550 Mondale delegates elected
with the aid of union contributions.
In addition, he says Democrats need an
electable candidate and, adding his vote to
that of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, argues that in
most primaries 60 percent of the Democrats
who voted have said they do not want
Mondale as their nominee.
But the odds of any Mondale delegates
switching is "almost zero" claims James
Johnson, the Mondale campaign chairman.
Mondale polls show the number of people
who think he would make the stronger Demo
cratic candidate is 10 to 15 percent higher
than the number that actually vote for him,
and Johnson points to this as evidence that
Mondale is electable and has the potential to
broaden his base.
Calls for Democratic unity, so often heard
after Mondale's victory in the big Texas pri
mary a few weeks ago, have been forgotten
lor the moment. Mondale blamed his losses
last week on his neglect to carry the attack to
Hart, and opened up his campaigning this

weekend accusing Hart of "unsteadiness,"
"flip-flops" and "lack of experience." Hart
had earlier dismissed the unity attempts as
premature claims to victory by Mondale.
Sixty-seven delegates are at stake in
Thursday's primaries in Nebraska and
' Oregon.
Elections and aid in Central America
Elections in El Salvador and Panama, a
presidential address and actions by the U.S.
House of Representatives and the World
Court were the dominant issues last week re
garding Central America.
Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte
was declared the offical winner of last Sun
day's presidential election in El Salvador.
Duarte has promised to halt the right-wing
death squads, pursue land reform and seek a
dialogue with rebels; he was clearly Washing
ton's favorite in the race.
Had Duarte not won, "we wouldn't even be
debating these amendments" for aid to El Sal
vador, "we'd be reassessing the whole thing,"
said House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.)
Duarte's opponent, Roberto d'Aubuisson,
of the right-wing Arena party, called the
results "a farce" and decried U.S. influence in
the elections. Evidence suggests that the CIA
spent $2.1 million to indirectly help defeat
d'Aubuisson.
Panama held its first elections in 16 years
last Sunday. By the end of the week, however,
no results had been announced in the contest
between the officially backed candidate,
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, and the aggressively
populist candidate, Arnulfo Arias Madrid.
Last week, one person was killed and 40
others injured after gunfire broke out as sup
porters of the candidates converged on the
legislative palace where the votes were being
counted. The cause of both the delayed results
and the violence was the cumbersome and
sometimes irregular vote-counting system
that, as it has in the past, kept Panamanians in
suspense.
Much of the campaigning centered around
Barletta's ties to the military. Barletta, vice

president of the World B.tnk for the last 7
years, claimed that despite the support of the
National Guard, he is not a pawn of the mili
tary as Madrid, a three-time president of
Panama, charged.
The election marked the return to full
democracy in the country of two million
people after an extended period of military
rule dominated by the late Gen. Omar Tor
rijos, commander of the National Guard.
In Washington, in a nationally televised
speech Thursday, President Reagan warned
that "the communists will succeed" in El Sal
vador unless Congress votes more aid, and
Congress did just that.

House majority leader Jim Wright (D-
Texas) swung his support over to a
Republican-supported military aid package
and took 56 other Democrats with him to help
the measure win by four votes.
The package provided $129.4 million in
military aid for Central America this year, but
did not allocate the money, leaving open the
issue of whether to continue funding the
Nicaraguan insurgents currently backed by
the U.S.
The International Court of Justice ruled on
the once-covert war last week and the U.S.
State Department said it would accept the
ruling.

In its ruling, the court said that the U.S.
"should refrain from any action restricting,
blocking or endangering access to or from
Nicaraguan ports, and, in particular, the
laying of mines." The court went on to order
the U.S. to respect the sovereignty of the
Republic of Nicaragua.
Despite the World Court developments,
war in Washington between the Administra
tion and Congress promised to drag on.
Reagan is reluctant to drop the covert war,
and in his speech, he called the rebels
"freedom fighters" and said they were engag
ing in "democratic actions" that the U.S.
"must support." On this issue, Wright and
other Democrats are standing firm. "There's
no way aid to the contras will get through,"
one of O'Neill's lieutenants said.
Olympics trip on Soviet hurdle
Citing the United States' failure to provide
adequate security for athletes and to conform
to the Olympic charter, the Soviet Union and
six other communist countries last week an
nounced their intention to boycott the Sum
mer Olympics.
There were reports that Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the president of the International
Olympic Committee, and other officials
planned to travel to Moscow to convince the
Soviets to compete before the final deadline
for paying fees on June 2. Now the addition of
Bulgaria, E. Germany, Czechoslovakia, Viet
nam, Laos and Mongolia to the list of boycot
ting countries, and the intensity of attacks on
President Reagan make that prospect
unlikely.
In sharp commentaries, the Soviet news
agency Tass has made it clear that key motives
"in the boycott were embarassing Reagan in an
election year and displaying frustration with
the administration's unremitting anti
communist posture and policies.

between the officially backed candidate,
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, and the aggressively
populist candidate, Arnulfo Arias Madrid.
Last week, one person was killed and 40
others injured after gunfire broke out as sup
porters of the candidates converged on the
legislative palace where the votes were being
counted. The cause of both the delayed results
and the violence was the cumbersome and
sometimes irregular vote-counting system
that, as it has in the past, kept Panamanians in
suspense.
Much of the campaigning centered around
Barletta's ties to the military. Barletta, vice

president of the World B.tnk for the last 7
years, claimed that despite the support of the
National Guard, he is not a pawn of the mili
tary as Madrid, a three-time president of
Panama, charged.
The election marked the return to full
democracy in the country of two million
people after an extended period of military
rule dominated by the late Gen. Omar Tor
rijos, commander of the National Guard.
In Washington, in a nationally televised
speech Thursday, President Reagan warned
that "the communists will succeed" in El Sal
vador unless Congress votes more aid, and
Congress did just that.

House majority leader Jim Wright (D-
Texas) swung his support over to a
Republican-supported military aid package
and took 56 other Democrats with him to help
the measure win by four votes.
The package provided $129.4 million in
military aid for Central America this year, but
did not allocate the money, leaving open the
issue of whether to continue funding the
Nicaraguan insurgents currently backed by
the U.S.
The International Court of Justice ruled on
the once-covert war last week and the U.S.
State Department said it would accept the
ruling.

In its ruling, the court said that the U.S.
"should refrain from any action restricting,
blocking or endangering access to or from
Nicaraguan ports, and, in particular, the
laying of mines." The court went on to order
the U.S. to respect the sovereignty of the
Republic of Nicaragua.
Despite the World Court developments,
war in Washington between the Administra
tion and Congress promised to drag on.
Reagan is reluctant to drop the covert war,
and in his speech, he called the rebels
"freedom fighters" and said they were engag
ing in "democratic actions" that the U.S.
"must support." On this issue, Wright and
other Democrats are standing firm. "There's
no way aid to the contras will get through,"
one of O'Neill's lieutenants said.
Olympics trip on Soviet hurdle
Citing the United States' failure to provide
adequate security for athletes and to conform
to the Olympic charter, the Soviet Union and
six other communist countries last week an
nounced their intention to boycott the Sum
mer Olympics.
There were reports that Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the president of the International
Olympic Committee, and other officials
planned to travel to Moscow to convince the
Soviets to compete before the final deadline
for paying fees on June 2. Now the addition of
Bulgaria, E. Germany, Czechoslovakia, Viet
nam, Laos and Mongolia to the list of boycot
ting countries, and the intensity of attacks on
President Reagan make that prospect
unlikely.
In sharp commentaries, the Soviet news
agency Tass has made it clear that key motives
"in the boycott were embarassing Reagan in an
election year and displaying frustration with
the administration's unremitting anti
communist posture and policies.

Hart still in race — barely
Despite Colorado Sen. Gary Hart's demo
cratic presidential primary victories in Ohio
and Indiana last week, the number of
delegates left to be selected make it
impossible for him to win enough pledged
delegates to equal former Vice President Wal
ter Mondale's current delegate count.
With 1967 delegates needed for nomina
tion, Mondale had 1518 last week and Hart
XB6, according to United Press International.
Only 829 delegates remain to be selected in
the seven primaries and one caucus left.
However, Hart still has a shot at the nomin
ation, and attention is shifting to his efforts to
sway Mondale delegates who, under party
rules written after the 1980 convention, are
allowed to switch allegiances before the first
ballot.
Hart's new strategy relies on a series of
momentum-building primary wins and dele
gate maneuvers to swing convention delegates
away from Mondale.
Hart is currently pursuing officially uncom
mitted delegates and preparing a credentials
challenge to 550 Mondale delegates elected
with the aid of union contributions.
In addition, he says Democrats need an
electable candidate and, adding his vote to
that of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, argues that in
most primaries 60 percent of the Democrats
who voted have said they do not want
Mondale as their nominee.
But the odds of any Mondale delegates
switching is "almost zero" claims James
Johnson, the Mondale campaign chairman.
Mondale polls show the number of people
who think he would make the stronger Demo
cratic candidate is 10 to 15 percent higher
than the number that actually vote for him,
and Johnson points to this as evidence that
Mondale is electable and has the potential to
broaden his base.
Calls for Democratic unity, so often heard
after Mondale's victory in the big Texas pri
mary a few weeks ago, have been forgotten
lor the moment. Mondale blamed his losses
last week on his neglect to carry the attack to
Hart, and opened up his campaigning this

weekend accusing Hart of "unsteadiness,"
"flip-flops" and "lack of experience." Hart
had earlier dismissed the unity attempts as
premature claims to victory by Mondale.
Sixty-seven delegates are at stake in
Thursday's primaries in Nebraska and
' Oregon.
Elections and aid in Central America
Elections in El Salvador and Panama, a
presidential address and actions by the U.S.
House of Representatives and the World
Court were the dominant issues last week re
garding Central America.
Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte
was declared the offical winner of last Sun
day's presidential election in El Salvador.
Duarte has promised to halt the right-wing
death squads, pursue land reform and seek a
dialogue with rebels; he was clearly Washing
ton's favorite in the race.
Had Duarte not won, "we wouldn't even be
debating these amendments" for aid to El Sal
vador, "we'd be reassessing the whole thing,"
said House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.)
Duarte's opponent, Roberto d'Aubuisson,
of the right-wing Arena party, called the
results "a farce" and decried U.S. influence in
the elections. Evidence suggests that the CIA
spent $2.1 million to indirectly help defeat
d'Aubuisson.
Panama held its first elections in 16 years
last Sunday. By the end of the week, however,
no results had been announced in the contest
between the officially backed candidate,
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, and the aggressively
populist candidate, Arnulfo Arias Madrid.
