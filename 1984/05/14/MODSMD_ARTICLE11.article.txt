## The
						Stanford Daily GLAS with class 
### 
The Gay and Lesbain Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) successfully managed to demonstrate
two points to the University community during its
tenth annual Gay and Lesbian Awareness Week,
May 7-12.
112 irst, GLAS proved that the subject of
homosexuality, a sensitive issue in today's society,
can be handled in a dignified, scholarly and un
pretentious manner. The organization presented
a lengthy agenda of informatory lectures and
workshops, ranging from a "Marketing to Gays
and Lesbians" workshop to a "Lesbian Shorts
Film Series."
These events were carried out discreetly; noth
ing was done to draw unnecessary or excessive at
tention to the week's happenings. All students
and members of the Stanford community could
attend any of the events at their own discretion.
No one was coerced into attending a single facet
of the week.
Unlike the person who made his views on
homosexuality clear with the brutal attack on
George Segal's "Gay Liberation" statue, GLAS
brought its own views on the subject to the

public's attention in a much more humane fas
hion. The organization also allowed people to
think and decide for themselves whether the situ
ations homosexuals face in society are just.
With "Gay Blue Jeans Day," GLAS was at last
able to prove to the Stanford community some
thing that it has long warned us about â€” homop
hobia and its widespread infection among the stu
dent body. While the idea of wearing blue jeans
to show support for the gay community might at
tirst seem trite as a large number of people wear
blue jeans anyway, it was interesting to observe
that a great many students who normally wear
jeans opted to don different attire that day.
The conscious action of some students to
change their dress for fear of being labled a
"supporter" of the homosexual community shows
how uptight many are when directly confronted
with the issue of homosexuality.
While it is obviously left to the individual to de
termine whether he or she accepts the gay com
munity, GLAS made a strong, positive statement
last week that we should examine homosexuality
more closely before passing judgment.
