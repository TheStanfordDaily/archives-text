## Daily witch hunt continues 
### 
What a mess. The Daily's witch
hunt on fraternities seems to be get
ting more desperate every day.
Before writing the editorial "Fill frats
through Draw " (May 9), the Daily
staff should have read John Peter
son's viewpoint "Getting lucky in the
life Draw," (May 9). Peterson cor
rectly pointed out the dehumanizing
consequences of having life based on
a simplistic Draw.
The Daily's editorial seems
primarily based on the belief that
people should not be judged subjec
tively on their social traits and that
the power of self-selection fraternities
have does not promote the goals of
Residential Education.
■ Life is not a Draw and Stanford is
not, and will never be, the "Utopia"
The Daily wishes it were.
Contrary to The Daily's apparent
belief, people are humans with
feelings, traits and differences, not
simply numbers in a draw. The vari
ety of housing on campus should
encourage, not deny, these differ
ences among us. We now have theme
houses, co-ops, self-ops, dorms and
fraternities all offering a range of
choices to a vast pool of individual
personalities.
Does The Daily believe Stanford
students are simply academic
machines? I do not believe for a
second The Daily's claim that
"students are admitted on the basis of
academic qualifications not social
ones." Stanford students are admitted
on many things, not the least of which
is the personality and motivation that
is put forward in one's application.
Fraternities provide a social base
for members and non-members alike.
Pub nights, campus parties and events
put on by fraternities give many
students a place to relax and enjoy
themselves after a day of classes or
studying. Unlike most universities
with a Greek system, Stanford's is
largely an open one. Almost all fra
ternity functions encourage people
from all over campus to attend.
As for not promoting Residential
Education's goals, I believe frater
nities are unfairly singled out for
supposedly having too much fun and

not enough work. But remember that
most people draw into : sidences not
because of their future accommoda
tions, but for the people and the
social group with which they wish to live.

As The Daily made clear in its May
9 editorial regarding Greek housing,
"Fill frats through Draw," the current
system is inequitable: Frats have
houses, sororities don't. Although an
argument can be made that sororities
aren't interested in housing and that
the status quo is fine, the general
feeling is that a change is necessary.
This feeling is largely motivated,
however, by the visibly negative
aspects of housed fraternities
(discriminatory sell-selection, lack of,
"diversity," and raucous group be
havior), not by the more practical
issue of who gets housed and who
doesn't. Let's not confuse the two
issues.
Many of these criticisms of frater
nities are at least partially valid and
worthy of discussion, but most have
been levelled by outsiders who have
never had an opportunity to see the
other side of the coin: The less
visible, positive aspects of fraternity
living. Fraternities don't just drink
and get in trouble. The day-to-day
experience of fraternity living, the
friendships, the comraderie, the
diversity of attitudes and outlooks
among members — these are the
intangibles that never get mentioned.
These are the things that can make
joining a fraternity worthwhile.
Can they be had in a draw-filled
fraternity? Possibly. My own feeling
is that self-selection, despite its
negative aspects, indirectly intensifies
the overall experience — but, in
either case, let's not be too quick to
eliminate what might just be a good
thing merely to solve the University's
housing dilemma.

Medical myths
and vitamin C

In his most recent column (Daily,
May 3), Jason Matherly states that
"many myths surround the use of
vitamin C" for the common cold, and
his poorly researched, one-sided
presentation propagates many of
them. In addition, he has offered
readers several creative myths of his
own.
Matherly is apparently unaware of
the large number of carefully con
trolled studies of vitamin C and colds;
one recent reviewer concluded an
analysis of these studies by stating
that "no consistent effects" could be
found. Tellingly, in several studies
even complications such as ear infec
tions and bronchitis were indistin
guishable in vitanYm and plaeebi>*
1 groups. A recent large-scale stutfy * *
even used identical twins and statist!-*
cal methods sufficient to pick up even
small, subtle effects but revealed ''no
heterogeneity in the ineffectiveness of
vitamin C." As to Matherly's flat
denial of kidney complications,
George Schreier of Georgetown
University has indeed reported in
creased incidence of calcium oxalate
deposits (particularly in patients with
kidney conditions, a relatively com
mon problem of the older popula
tion).
Matherly also makes a number of
vindictive statements describing our
biomedical community as "possessed
by ignorance" regarding vitamin C.
The fact that over 600 research arti
cles on vitamin C were published in
1982-83 alone suggests that Matherly
might be off base. The research
ranged from colds to cancer, from
hepatitis to Parkinson's disease. If
research on vitamin C were ever to
produce consistent evidence of posi
tive effects on viral illness, there will
be tremendous effort to exploit this
biochemical handle on crucial, heavily
researched problems ranging from the
immune system to viral replication.

living. Fraternities don't just drink
and get in trouble. The day-to-day
experience of fraternity living, the
friendships, the comraderie, the
diversity of attitudes and outlooks
among members — these are the
intangibles that never get mentioned.
These are the things that can make
joining a fraternity worthwhile.
Can they be had in a draw-filled
fraternity? Possibly. My own feeling
is that self-selection, despite its
negative aspects, indirectly intensifies
the overall experience — but, in
either case, let's not be too quick to
eliminate what might just be a good
thing merely to solve the University's
housing dilemma.

Medical myths
and vitamin C

In his most recent column (Daily,
May 3), Jason Matherly states that
"many myths surround the use of
vitamin C" for the common cold, and
his poorly researched, one-sided
presentation propagates many of
them. In addition, he has offered
readers several creative myths of his
own.
Matherly is apparently unaware of
the large number of carefully con
trolled studies of vitamin C and colds;
one recent reviewer concluded an
analysis of these studies by stating
that "no consistent effects" could be
found. Tellingly, in several studies
even complications such as ear infec
tions and bronchitis were indistin
guishable in vitanYm and plaeebi>*
1 groups. A recent large-scale stutfy * *
even used identical twins and statist!-*
cal methods sufficient to pick up even
small, subtle effects but revealed ''no
heterogeneity in the ineffectiveness of
vitamin C." As to Matherly's flat
denial of kidney complications,
George Schreier of Georgetown
University has indeed reported in
creased incidence of calcium oxalate
deposits (particularly in patients with
kidney conditions, a relatively com
mon problem of the older popula
tion).
Matherly also makes a number of
vindictive statements describing our
biomedical community as "possessed
by ignorance" regarding vitamin C.
The fact that over 600 research arti
cles on vitamin C were published in
1982-83 alone suggests that Matherly
might be off base. The research
ranged from colds to cancer, from
hepatitis to Parkinson's disease. If
research on vitamin C were ever to
produce consistent evidence of posi
tive effects on viral illness, there will
be tremendous effort to exploit this
biochemical handle on crucial, heavily
researched problems ranging from the
immune system to viral replication.

What a mess. The Daily's witch
hunt on fraternities seems to be get
ting more desperate every day.
Before writing the editorial "Fill frats
through Draw " (May 9), the Daily
staff should have read John Peter
son's viewpoint "Getting lucky in the
life Draw," (May 9). Peterson cor
rectly pointed out the dehumanizing
consequences of having life based on
a simplistic Draw.
The Daily's editorial seems
primarily based on the belief that
people should not be judged subjec
tively on their social traits and that
the power of self-selection fraternities
have does not promote the goals of
Residential Education.
■ Life is not a Draw and Stanford is
not, and will never be, the "Utopia"
The Daily wishes it were.
Contrary to The Daily's apparent
belief, people are humans with
feelings, traits and differences, not
simply numbers in a draw. The vari
ety of housing on campus should
encourage, not deny, these differ
ences among us. We now have theme
houses, co-ops, self-ops, dorms and
fraternities all offering a range of
choices to a vast pool of individual
personalities.
Does The Daily believe Stanford
students are simply academic
machines? I do not believe for a
second The Daily's claim that
"students are admitted on the basis of
academic qualifications not social
ones." Stanford students are admitted
on many things, not the least of which
is the personality and motivation that
is put forward in one's application.
Fraternities provide a social base
for members and non-members alike.
Pub nights, campus parties and events
put on by fraternities give many
students a place to relax and enjoy
themselves after a day of classes or
studying. Unlike most universities
with a Greek system, Stanford's is
largely an open one. Almost all fra
ternity functions encourage people
from all over campus to attend.
As for not promoting Residential
Education's goals, I believe frater
nities are unfairly singled out for
supposedly having too much fun and

not enough work. But remember that
most people draw into : sidences not
because of their future accommoda
tions, but for the people and the
social group with which they wish to live.

More frat chat
As The Daily made clear in its May
9 editorial regarding Greek housing,
"Fill frats through Draw," the current
system is inequitable: Frats have
houses, sororities don't. Although an
argument can be made that sororities
aren't interested in housing and that
the status quo is fine, the general
feeling is that a change is necessary.
This feeling is largely motivated,
however, by the visibly negative
aspects of housed fraternities
(discriminatory sell-selection, lack of,
"diversity," and raucous group be
havior), not by the more practical
issue of who gets housed and who
doesn't. Let's not confuse the two
issues.
Many of these criticisms of frater
nities are at least partially valid and
worthy of discussion, but most have
been levelled by outsiders who have
never had an opportunity to see the
other side of the coin: The less
visible, positive aspects of fraternity
living. Fraternities don't just drink
and get in trouble. The day-to-day
experience of fraternity living, the
friendships, the comraderie, the
diversity of attitudes and outlooks
among members — these are the
intangibles that never get mentioned.
These are the things that can make
joining a fraternity worthwhile.
Can they be had in a draw-filled
fraternity? Possibly. My own feeling
is that self-selection, despite its
negative aspects, indirectly intensifies
the overall experience — but, in
either case, let's not be too quick to
eliminate what might just be a good
thing merely to solve the University's
housing dilemma.
