## How about some empathy? 
### 
The other day my friend Henry (who happens to be a
manager of ASSU Recycling) and I went to the Post Of
fice. Henry had received a slip saying there was a package
waiting for him. so he went inside. He entered just before
they closed the doors.
I found my hox empty and went around front to wait in
line with Henry. As I locked my bike we were gesturing to
each other; the man guarding the door could easily tell we
were together. I, not knowing the Post Office was closed.

VIEWPOINT

walked to the door and tried to open it. Since it was
locked, it just rattled. Oops, sorry. Henry and I just looked
at each other. 1 gestured to the guard saying, "I'm with
him, I don't intend to lengthen anyone's work day." The
man just gave me a dirty look. I said "no biggie," and
walked away.
Another postal patron, this one with urgent business,
tried to get in. He pleaded; the guard just gave him a very
dirty look. The customer cussed, complained, said how im
portant to him and minimal to the postal workers his busi
ness was; but to no avail.
All day Stanford students come to the Post Office,
harried and hurried between classes, jobs and homework.
"Oh no, not this line again!" "Twenty cents to get a letter
there a week from now?!" They store up anger, frustra
tions of the day or (in pseudo-scientic cliche terms) "bad
energy" during the time they wait in line and then throw it
at the postal workers.
Ouch.
The postal workers absorb that all day, all week, all
month, all career. At some point, they begin to bounce it
back at us. Who can blame them? Ama/ingly enough,
some have remained pleasant and tun to talk to despite the
customers' hassles.

sible for us to be here. The partiers leave a horrendous
mess for the maid Monday morning and then complain
when she wakes them with her vacuuming (that was me
one year). The spoiled children gripe about food service
(sometimes within earshot of the cooks), leaving uneaten
food on their plates and messes on the tables while they
complain of high prices and poor serv ice.
We at the Recycling Center are vulnerable to Stanford's
"bad energy" because we are students handling Stanford's
garbage. On a bad day, a recycler can take fire from all
sides. There is the parental disapproval that many of us
hear: "Why are you wasting your life and education
hauling garbage?"
Then there's the disapproval of other University staff,
who sometimes think of us as spoiled, lazy students who
need a dose of reality and a good spanking, the mental and
emotional drain of our studies, loves, problems and the
GARBAGE that all too many people unload on us in our
recycling barrels. We don't see faces, we see garbage. And
garbage is dirty. It can be miserable standing on the sorting
platform, picking through rotting food, panty hose, used
condoms, dirty diapers, copy machine ink and thousands
of tiny styrofoam balls that stick to everything, or even just
recyclables mixed so thoroughly that we take forfever to
sort the newspaper from the colored paper from the white
ledger from the computer paper. Negative thoughts,
doubts and anger arc commonplace.
There are good days, probably more than there are bad
ones. We like tossing stacks of valuable, clean paper into
the big bins and sorting the wild-rivers of aluminum cans
pouring out of our can-sorting box. Driving around in the
truck is fun; we get to work outside and go all sorts of

places on campus. I think all ol us Ice I somewhat proud,
too. that we're doing something concrete to improve the
world, and getting paid besides.
I guess I'm writing this tor two reasons. One is to explain
and apologize for the (often undeserved) ohnoxiousuess
that we recyclers have been known to dish out. in the form
of dorm speeches, a lew loud words in a dorm or office
("Oh no, not this trashy barrel again!") or a nasty note
pinned on a wall next to a recycling barrel. Often people
who want to "save the world" or some part of it go
through a certain period of irrational anger at the stupidity
of "the system" they are caught in. (The anger is irrational
only because it has been stored up ov£r a long period and
is vented in large quantities for small reasons.)
Following this stage, the "good" idealist becomes a
strong humanist. The growing reeyeler sees that everyone
else is a person too: Even those who have "bought into the
system," thos£ who are satisfied with the status quo com
plete with its faults and shortcomings, and those who
mistreat others because people have become mere objects
to process. Yes. even "they" are human.
Accompanying this revelation is a kind of pragmatism.
Not only is it painful to forever bash one's head against the

system, but it is difficult to remain ignorant of its positive
points. One begins to realize that "we" aren't the only
ones trying to "change" it (or. conversely, that there are
a lot more of "us" than is obvious at first glance), and that
the system is usually huilt to be changeable.
People all over are trying to improve things gently, from
the inside, while others are just trying to get by. We're all
in this (whatever this is) together. This is not to say one
should become so complacent about the system that one
stops fighting it in his or her own way. Rather, perhaps it is
wise to relax and observe (objectively, it possible) before
getting too caught up in the struggle to remember what
we're trying to do.
There is another more subtle reason for writing this. I
want something else for recycling: More thoughtful partic
ipation from you. How about those banana peels? Cer
tainly between our efforts and yours, we can wake up the
people who don't know a green barrel from a hole in the
ground, those who don't know the difference between
garbage and valuable material, and who don't realize that
we are human beings picking through these barrels so the
world may keep turning a little longer. Would those
people please make the barrels a little less gross and little,
more full so we can have nicer days and more money?
Meanwhile, we'll work on being more friendly and per
haps more conscientious about picking up your barrels
before they overflow. After all, you're people too.
