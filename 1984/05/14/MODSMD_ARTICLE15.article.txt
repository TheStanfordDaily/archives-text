# Dr. Seuss to save the world
## 
### 
Good news for the world. The specter of nuclear
destruction is about to disappear. The end of the
arms race is in sight. Who gets the credit?
Negotiating diplomats? No. Peace-minded scien
tists? No. The intelligentsia from some foreign
state? No.
We can thank Dr. Seuss, and if he doesn't win a
Nobel prize for peace it'll be the biggest intellec
tual rip-off since Gandhi beat E.T. for best picture.
It's like this: We were innocent and un
prejudiced when we were kids, right? Well, most
; of us were. Don't begrudge me that one. If we
i were just as selfish, tainted and pessimistic when
we were six as we are now we would probably
deserve to blow up. But 1 don't think we were,
i So what happened?
What happened was we stopped reading Dr.
Seuss and started reading history books and all
sorts of other fiction. Big mistake. But Dr. Seuss
has forgiven us and written The Butter Rattle Book,
which concerns the arms race between a nation
that eats its toast butter-side down and one that
eats its toast butter-side up.
I think Reagan and Cherncnko are too far gone
to be saved, and most of us "liberal" college kids
are too intrigued with our poli-sci classes to pay
any attention to Seuss. But whoever' s gonna win
the presidential election in 2044 is around six years
old today, and if he's reading Seuss's latest work,
I'll feel a lot better.
( Naive you say? Yeah, but strict logic and
1 rationalism are what got us into this "less in the
first place, so a little juvenile optimism is the only
way out.
There's another arms race book in the stores by
a guy named Freeman Dyson. It doesn't have any

pictures though. The jacket says that, as a
renowned physicist, Dyson is qualified to offer a
fresh, hopeful, yet still realistic view of nuclear
weaponry. Thank you Mr. Dyson, but 1 think I'll
stick with Dr. Seuss.
Remember Winnie-the-Pooh? He may be a bear

of very little brain, and he probably couldn't figure
out how to solve the missile crisis, but then again,
he would never have okayed the MX missile.
There's a paperback floating around now called
The Tao of Pooh which explains the philosophy of
everyone's favorite bear, and should be required'
reading for all would-be scholars. See, who can
read a scholarly report by a renowned physicist?
Another renowned physicist, and that's about all.
It's nice to hear the experts are hopeful, but there's
a lot of us out here who would like to know exactly
what's going on and will never find out as long as
scholars keep writing books for themselves. Dr.
Seuss has probably done more for the public, espe
cially the young public, consciousness than a
hundred philosophers could have.
So, should the Western Culture program drop
Aristotle, Berkeley. Hume and Hegel in favor of
the collected works of Dr. Seuss? It might not hurt.
How many people actually finish Aristotle? At
least you don't need Cliff Notes for The Cat In The
Hat. But these books arc more than just readable.
They say something, and usually it's more helpful
than anything the "experts" have to offer.
Okay. Okay, 1 know it's easy to run around
preaching innocence and simplicity. But it's a lot
easier to hide behind a degree, pretenting to know
more about stuff than anyone else. I bet Dr. Seuss
spent more time creating The Butter Battle Book
than, say, Kant, spent writing some of his dis
courses. If knowledge is going to help anyone, it's
got to be disseminated. That doesn't mean treating
everyone like gradeschoolers, explaining every
thing through Pooh and his friends. But it's a start.
