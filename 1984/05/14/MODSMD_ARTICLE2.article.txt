# Residents charged wrong rate
## Row overcharged 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
The occupants of 16 special priority
houses and fraternities have been
overbilled a total of approximately
$19,800 for housing this year, owing
to a mistake made by the Row Office
last June.
The oversight, which amounts to an
extra $26 paid for housing this year by
each of the nearly 763 occupants of
the houses concerned, was first
noticed last Tuesday by Alex Duarte,
a resident assistant at ZAP house.
Duarte said the residences were
charged according to "PTR- billing"
instead of "group-billing," as they
should have been. PTR-billing is
usually reserved for dormitories and
other houses that are on a University
food plan, Duarte said.
"PTR means that the University
handles the accounting, and each stu
dent is billed individually for both tui
tion and a food plan," Duarte said.
"Houses like ZAP only pay for tuition
and then students pay the house for
food, and the house sends a check to
the University."
The mistake originated in the Row
Office last spring when Jim Cadena,
assistant director of the Row, sent a
memo addressed to all row financial
managers. The memo, dated May 31,
1983, tentatively informed the
managers that their 1983-84 rent rates
wo.ujd be $620 for the fall quarter,
$567 for the'"winter and $552 for the
spring.
These rent rates, which were the
PTR rates, ranged from $8 to $10
more per quarter than the group rates,
and, when totaled over all three quar
ters, amounted to the $26 per year
overbilling that was assessed to each
student living in one of the houses.
"It was a very minor thing," Cadena
said. "I simply gave the accounting of
fice the wrong figure, the PTR figure.
The (University) controllers will
rebate the houses for overcharging.
"It is very curious that this thing is
in The Daily," the assistant director of
the Row for the past two-and-one-half
years said. "It is a very sort of minor
occurrence, and it's happened before
where houses were overcharged. It
was simply a minor error."
Duarte said he did not become in
terested in the Row's student room
and board rates until the beginning of
this quarter, when three vacancies

arose in ZAP house.
"We are a group-built house with
54 spots, and we are responsible for
54 rents whether or not they are full,"
Duarte said. "But only some people
knew we were a group, and the others
didn't."
Duarte said the University still
planned to charge ZAP house for the
three unoccupied spaces, at $552
apiece for this quarter.
In an attempt to avoid this extra
payment, Duarte said he went to see
Cadena earlier this quarter but was
shown the May 31, 1983 memo which
said, "The group bill is a fixed
amount, regardless of whether or not
the house is full."
Last Tuesday, Duarte said he
realized ZAP house had been charged
the PTR rates rather than the group
billing, and he called Duarte the next
day.
"I don't think he (Cadena) did it in
bad faith. It was just an inadvertent
mistake," Duarte said. "I just think
it's amazing that this thing went six
months without anyone catching it. It
is a $19,000 error and if no one caught
it, this (rebate for the houses) never
would have happened.
The other 15 houses affected in
clude the fraternity residences of Al
pha Delta Phi, Alpha Sigma, Beta
Theta Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta
Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon, Sigma Al
pha Epsilon, Kappa Alpha, Kappa
Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Psi and
Theta Delta Chi; and the special
priority houses, ATO, Terra and
vVhitman.
"I just want to make sure that all
the residents know they have a rebate
coming," Duarte said.
Though the University plans to give
the houses a rebate, "the fight is not
over" for ZAP house, Duarte said. He
said the house still must pay for the
three vacancies this quarter, which will
cost more than the rebate.
"Ideally, I would like to not get a
rebate and just not pay anything. 1 feel
that would be fair considering the in
convenience we've had with this,"
Duarte said. "But even if we don't get
that, I feel good, at least, that some
one discovered this mistake now and
not over the summer."
Cadena said, with regard to
Duarte's proposal for ZAP, "I don't
know about that. We haven't decided
yet."

Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Psi and

"I just want to make sure that all
the residents know they have a rebate
coming," Duarte said.
Though the University plans to give
the houses a rebate, "the fight is not
over" for ZAP house, Duarte said. He
said the house still must pay for the
three vacancies this quarter, which will
cost more than the rebate.
"Ideally, I would like to not get a
rebate and just not pay anything. 1 feel
that would be fair considering the in
convenience we've had with this,"
Duarte said. "But even if we don't get
that, I feel good, at least, that some
one discovered this mistake now and
not over the summer."
Cadena said, with regard to
Duarte's proposal for ZAP, "I don't
know about that. We haven't decided
yet."
