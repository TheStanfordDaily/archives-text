## Grad student will attempt to conquer Everest 
### LAURA CORSER 
Obstacles come in all shapes and
sizes. Sometimes an obstacle can be
tear, other times it is a physical limita
tion. But for graduate student Scott
Lankford, conquering his goal means
climbing a much more tangible — and
intimidating — obstacle.
From Feb. 15 to May 15, 1985,
Lankford, along with 14 other mem
bers of a specially-selected climbing
team, will ascend Mount Everest, the
highest mountain in the world.
The 1985 American Mount Everest
West Ridge Expedition (AMEWR)
will attempt to reach the 29,028 foot
high summit by the West Route Direct
— one of the most difficult paths up
the mountain. Prior to this attempt,
the only successful team of moun
taineers to reach the top in this way
was a Yugoslavian group in 1978. The
last American expedition to try the
climb was in 1983, and they were
forced to turn back at 28,000 feet be
cause of severe winds and weather
conditions. The success of AMEWR's
expedition would, therefore, serve as
both a national and personal ac
complishment.
Mount Everest, located on the bor
der between Nepal and China in the
Himalaya mountain range, is more
than five miles high and its treac
herous slopes have claimed many
lives. In 1928 a party reached the alti
tude of 28,000 feet, but it was not un

til 1953 that Sir Edmund Hillery and
Sherpa Tenzing Norgay became
Everest':: first conquerors.
Since then Everest has been
climbed via several routes, the most
traveled of which is the South Col.
The difficulty in routes other than the
West Direct route lies in the approach
to the mountain. In order to reach
it, climbers must cross the Khmbu ice
fall, a large glacier that is subject to
frequent collapses.
The West Direct route — which the
AMERW will be taking — alleviates
this danger, but its difficulty lies at
higher altitudes where the path is
much steeper and is thickly covered by
ice and snow.
It is probable that at least a quarter
of the climbing party will become ill
from altitude sickness or dysentery. In
addition to the 15 climbers there will
be 300 porters that will carry the
$30,000 worth of necessary equip
ment 170 miles to the base camp at
17,900 feet. From there six Sherpas,
who are high altitude tribespeople that
serve as specialized climbing porters,
wjll continue to accompany the 15 to
the next camps. The team will remain
in contact with the base camp
throughout the expedition by walkie
talkies.
Although Lankford feels that climb
ing Everest is an "invitation and op
portunity that any mountaineer would
jump at," he says the expedition will

be equally valuable to his studies. Cur
rently. Lankford is working toward a
Ph.D. in Modern Thought and
Literature.
Lankford*s graduate work is con
centrated in philososophy and in par
ticular with the aesthetics and philoso
phy of mountains on modern
literature and poetery.
Lankford noted that of the two
Americans to climb the West Ridge in
1963, one was a doctor of philosophy.
Living in Colorado provided ail the
members of the Lankford family with
a chance to climb. Lankford's father
has already visited Nepal as the leader
of several expeditions, and Lankford
has previously climbed in Wyoming's
Wind River Range and the Colorado
Rockies. Although a climber for only
10 years, he has already served as a
climbing instructor and wilderness
guide in Africa, Alaska, California,
Colorado, Mexico, Montana and
Wyoming.
When he entered Stanford graduate
school two-and-one-half-years ago,
however, Lankford realized that the
amount of time available for climbing
would be greatly reduced, so he
devoted the majority of his time to his
studies. For the fall and winter quar
ters of 1983, Lankford taught a fresh
man English class, and was a teaching
assistant in two other English classes.
The invitation to join the expedition
was a surprise as well as a great honor.

In order to train tor and make the
actual climb Scott has stopped out un
til 1985. Until February he will be
practicing in Colorado, running and
lifting weights. Finally, in September,
he will be practicing with the team at
Mount Ranier.
This summer he will also be teach
ing a course in mountaineering at
Stanford's Sierra Camp. During this
period Lankford is hoping to master
the Nepalese language and culture. He
hopes that this knowledge, in conjunc
tion with knowledge of the mountain
and attempts made at its ascent, may
help him with his dissertation.
Assuming that all goes as planned,
five camps will be established between
the base camp and the summit. The
actual ascent of the summit from the
point of the base camp should take a
month. If the climb is not completed
by May 15. 1985, the expedition will
be forced to retreat because the
onslaught of monsoon season brings
continuous snow storms that would be
deadly.
Almost as astounding as the actual
climb is the amount of time, money
and energy put into the project.
Before climbing Mount Everest a
group must first gain endorsement
from the American Alpine Club in or
der to apply for a permit from the
Nepalese government.

Living in Colorado provided ail the
members of the Lankford family with
a chance to climb. Lankford's father
has already visited Nepal as the leader
of several expeditions, and Lankford
has previously climbed in Wyoming's
Wind River Range and the Colorado
Rockies. Although a climber for only
10 years, he has already served as a
climbing instructor and wilderness
guide in Africa, Alaska, California,
Colorado, Mexico, Montana and
Wyoming.
When he entered Stanford graduate
school two-and-one-half-years ago,
however, Lankford realized that the
amount of time available for climbing
would be greatly reduced, so he
devoted the majority of his time to his
studies. For the fall and winter quar
ters of 1983, Lankford taught a fresh
man English class, and was a teaching
assistant in two other English classes.
The invitation to join the expedition
was a surprise as well as a great honor.

In order to train tor and make the
actual climb Scott has stopped out un
til 1985. Until February he will be
practicing in Colorado, running and
lifting weights. Finally, in September,
he will be practicing with the team at
Mount Ranier.
This summer he will also be teach
ing a course in mountaineering at
Stanford's Sierra Camp. During this
period Lankford is hoping to master
the Nepalese language and culture. He
hopes that this knowledge, in conjunc
tion with knowledge of the mountain
and attempts made at its ascent, may
help him with his dissertation.
Assuming that all goes as planned,
five camps will be established between
the base camp and the summit. The
actual ascent of the summit from the
point of the base camp should take a
month. If the climb is not completed
by May 15. 1985, the expedition will
be forced to retreat because the
onslaught of monsoon season brings
continuous snow storms that would be
deadly.
Almost as astounding as the actual
climb is the amount of time, money
and energy put into the project.
Before climbing Mount Everest a
group must first gain endorsement
from the American Alpine Club in or

Nepalese government.

Obstacles come in all shapes and
sizes. Sometimes an obstacle can be
tear, other times it is a physical limita
tion. But for graduate student Scott
Lankford, conquering his goal means
climbing a much more tangible — and
intimidating — obstacle.
From Feb. 15 to May 15, 1985,
Lankford, along with 14 other mem
bers of a specially-selected climbing
team, will ascend Mount Everest, the
highest mountain in the world.
The 1985 American Mount Everest
West Ridge Expedition (AMEWR)
will attempt to reach the 29,028 foot
high summit by the West Route Direct
— one of the most difficult paths up
the mountain. Prior to this attempt,
the only successful team of moun
taineers to reach the top in this way
was a Yugoslavian group in 1978. The
last American expedition to try the
climb was in 1983, and they were
forced to turn back at 28,000 feet be
cause of severe winds and weather
conditions. The success of AMEWR's
expedition would, therefore, serve as
both a national and personal ac
complishment.
Mount Everest, located on the bor
der between Nepal and China in the
Himalaya mountain range, is more
than five miles high and its treac
herous slopes have claimed many
lives. In 1928 a party reached the alti
tude of 28,000 feet, but it was not un

til 1953 that Sir Edmund Hillery and
Sherpa Tenzing Norgay became
Everest':: first conquerors.
Since then Everest has been
climbed via several routes, the most
traveled of which is the South Col.
The difficulty in routes other than the
West Direct route lies in the approach
to the mountain. In order to reach
it, climbers must cross the Khmbu ice
fall, a large glacier that is subject to
frequent collapses.
The West Direct route — which the
AMERW will be taking — alleviates
this danger, but its difficulty lies at
higher altitudes where the path is
much steeper and is thickly covered by
ice and snow.
It is probable that at least a quarter
of the climbing party will become ill
from altitude sickness or dysentery. In
addition to the 15 climbers there will
be 300 porters that will carry the
$30,000 worth of necessary equip
ment 170 miles to the base camp at
17,900 feet. From there six Sherpas,
who are high altitude tribespeople that
serve as specialized climbing porters,
wjll continue to accompany the 15 to
the next camps. The team will remain
in contact with the base camp
throughout the expedition by walkie
talkies.
Although Lankford feels that climb
ing Everest is an "invitation and op
portunity that any mountaineer would
jump at," he says the expedition will

be equally valuable to his studies. Cur
rently. Lankford is working toward a
Ph.D. in Modern Thought and
Literature.
Lankford*s graduate work is con
centrated in philososophy and in par
ticular with the aesthetics and philoso
phy of mountains on modern
literature and poetery.
