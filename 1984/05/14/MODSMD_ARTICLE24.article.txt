## Professor Esslin chastises attitudes which result in "sissies"

? """But I tried hard, Professor,

so I deserve a better grade!" It
is a plea that I get to hear all too
often. And I am puzzled by it.
After all, we do live in an
achievement-oriented society, a
society that depends on free and
hard competition, where only
the most solid accomplishments

count. How could the notion
have arisen that trying hard,
even if the result is complete
failure, is in itself already an
achievement that deserves to be
honored?
The persistence of this notion
must, in the long run, when the

students concerned have to con
front the harsh realities of daily
life in this society. lead to truly
disastrous results.
The feeling of being a failure
lies behind most of the al
coholism. the drug-taking, the
neurosis and psychoses and ulti
mately the suicides of our soci
ety. The sooner young people
learn how to confront their own
mistakes and inadequacies, the
sooner they should be able to
correct them, the sooner will
they acquire a realistic sense of
their true abilities and. as a con
sequence. the complex skills
that have to be mastered to
make the best use of an individ
ual's talents — his or her poten
tial. It is. I think, regrettable
that the prevailing climate, both
in the home and at school, is one
of misunderstood notions of the
vulnerability of the youthful
psyche: "By giving me a bad
grade you are destroying my
self-image, you are inflicting ir
reparable damage to my ego!" is

running around in the world; indeed,
people who have too many different
talents often end up with being superifical
all round.

another kind of argument that
occasionally crops up in these
situations.
This is not only a grotesque
inversion of psychological in
sights, it is also the best way to
produce a nation of sissies —
self-pitying individuals who are

hypochondriacs ot their own
psyche, endlessly contemplating
their own neuroses and con
stantly feeling sorry for them
selves. Such an attitude is the
\ery opposite of true self
knowledge.
"Know thyself!" was the in
scription above the entrance to
the oracle at Delphi. It is. to this
day.the key to the deepest wis
dom and to true mental health.
True self-knowledge includes a
realistic awareness of one's own
shortcomings. Such personal
shortcomings may be of two
kinds: those that are correctible
and those that, reluctantly, we
must recognise as lying outside
our capacities. A bad grade may
be an indication that with a little
more concentration and appli
cation. with the expenditure of a
little more effort, the deficiency
can be eliminated. Or it may
point to an irremediable defect
— an absence of musicality, or
mathematical talent. In that
case the sooner the person con
cerned comes to terms with such

a shortcoming, the better it is.
There is no disgrace in having
one kind of talent rather than
another. There are precious few
universal geniuses running

upon which talent they would

of the Absurd."
? """But I tried hard, Professor,

so I deserve a better grade!" It
is a plea that I get to hear all too
often. And I am puzzled by it.
After all, we do live in an
achievement-oriented society, a
society that depends on free and
hard competition, where only
the most solid accomplishments

count. How could the notion
have arisen that trying hard,
even if the result is complete
failure, is in itself already an
achievement that deserves to be
honored?
The persistence of this notion
must, in the long run, when the

students concerned have to con
front the harsh realities of daily
life in this society. lead to truly
disastrous results.
The feeling of being a failure
lies behind most of the al
coholism. the drug-taking, the
neurosis and psychoses and ulti
mately the suicides of our soci
ety. The sooner young people
learn how to confront their own
mistakes and inadequacies, the
sooner they should be able to
correct them, the sooner will
they acquire a realistic sense of
their true abilities and. as a con
sequence. the complex skills
that have to be mastered to
make the best use of an individ
ual's talents — his or her poten
tial. It is. I think, regrettable
