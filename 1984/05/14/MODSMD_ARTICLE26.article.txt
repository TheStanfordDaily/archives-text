# Bears maul Cardinal hopes for sweep and possibly playoffs
## 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sportswriter 
UC-Berkeley's Greg McClain
blasted two home runs and
Lance Blankenship added an
other yesterday to lead the Cali
fornia Bears to a 12-7 victory
over the eleventh-ranked Stan
lord baseball team that
prevented a Stanford series
sweep and left the Cardinal's
post-season fate unclear.
The Card finished Pacific-10
C onference Southern Division
play in a tie lor second place as
USC swept last place UCLA to
make up a one game difterence
that had separated the two
clubs. Thus, both Stanford and
USC finished the "Six-Pac"
season behind Arizona State
with identical IS-1 2 records.
Stanford ended its 19K4 regular
season campaign with a 36-24-1
overall record while Cal finished

12-IS in the conference and 37-
30-1 overall.
Stanford now awaits the deci
sion of a six-man selection com
mittee that awards 11 at-large
bids to the NCAA Regionals.
The tournament begins May 24
and while the committee
deliberates this week the Car
dinal will stay sharp by hosting
the San Francisco Giants in an
exhibition game at Sunken Dia
mond this Thursday.
Although Stanford dropped
four of its six meetings with
USC. the Card's Head Coach
Mark Marquess believes that his
club's 11-4 second-half league
mark, best in the conference,
and the national ranking that
has resulted should carry the
Cardinal to the Regionals.
"Realistically, I think that
we're one of the top 36 teams in
the country," said Marquess,

who is a member of the commit
tee. "1 can make a good argu
ment to take us over (U)SC be
cause the committee isn't tied
into taking the second place
team."
Stanford could have
prevented all of this confusion
by completing a series sweep in
yesterday's season finale at
Berkeley. Instead, Cal bounced
back from defeats in the first
two games to record its only tri
umph in six meetings with Stan
ford behind a complete game
win by Bryan Price (9-3).
Stanford drew first blood with
a three-run second, highlighted
by Mark Davis' two-run ground
rule double. Cal answered with
four runs off loser Kevin Kunkel
(3-7) in their half of the second
and built a 12-4 advantage as
McClain and Blankenship
tagged round-trippers off three

different Cardinal relievers.
Marquess was realistic about
the series outcome. " If you'd
have said that we'll take two out
of three from Cal before the se
ries, I'd have taken it."
Stanford moved closer to
navigating its unlikely course to
the playoffs with a 3-2 win on
Saturday before a large Sunken
Diamond crowd. The contest
marked the final home appear
ance for eight Stanford seniors,
including pitcher John Radtke
who stifled the Bears on just
five hits through eight innings.
Cal nicked Radtke for a fifth in
ning run for a 1-0 lead that
lasted until the eighth.
In the Cardinal eighth, a walk
and a single chased Cal hurler
Will Schock. Mike Deßenon
followed by greeting reliever
and loser Buddy Watts (3-4)
with a game tying single to left

field. Walt Harris gave the Card
a 2-1 lead when he looped an
RBI single down the right field
line after failing on two sacrifice
bunt attempts. But in the ninth
Blankenship, 8-for-12 in the se
ries, tagged Radtke's 3-1 pitch
over the left field fence to tie the
game.
Stanford finally won the dog
fight with a run in the bottom of
the ninth. Darryl Stephens was
hit by a pitch, sacrificed to
second and moved to third on
an infield hit by Harris. John
Verducci then scored Stephens
with a sacrifice fly.
The Cardinal opened the se
ries with an 8-4 extra inning vic
tory at California on Friday.
Each team tallied once in the
first two frames and Stanford
added another in the third to
take a 3-2 lead. The Bears,
however, responded with two

scores in their third and
nurtured a 4-3 cushion until the
seventh inning. After Rick
Lundblade's double, Deßenon
slapped an RBI single to right
field to tie the game at 4-4.
Reliever Rick Dietz bailed
out Jeff Ballard in the eighth
and chalked up a victory when
the Card scored four times in
the tenth — on a double, an in
tentional walk, two infield hits
and a bloop single. Dietz ran his
record to 4-1 with wins on both
Friday and Saturday. Bren Con
ner (7-6) absorbed the first
game loss.
Jack Clark and the San Fran
cisco Giants will forego a day of
rest to tackle the Cardinal this
Thursday at 1 p.m. in an exhibi
tion game to benefit the Stan
ford baseball program. Tickets
for the game are $4 for adults
and $2 for students and

children. For ticket information,

UC-Berkeley's Greg McClain
blasted two home runs and
Lance Blankenship added an
other yesterday to lead the Cali
fornia Bears to a 12-7 victory
over the eleventh-ranked Stan
lord baseball team that
prevented a Stanford series
sweep and left the Cardinal's
post-season fate unclear.
The Card finished Pacific-10
C onference Southern Division
play in a tie lor second place as
USC swept last place UCLA to
make up a one game difterence
that had separated the two
clubs. Thus, both Stanford and
USC finished the "Six-Pac"
season behind Arizona State
with identical IS-1 2 records.
Stanford ended its 19K4 regular
season campaign with a 36-24-1
overall record while Cal finished

12-IS in the conference and 37-
30-1 overall.
Stanford now awaits the deci
sion of a six-man selection com
mittee that awards 11 at-large
bids to the NCAA Regionals.
The tournament begins May 24
and while the committee
deliberates this week the Car
dinal will stay sharp by hosting
the San Francisco Giants in an
exhibition game at Sunken Dia
mond this Thursday.
Although Stanford dropped
four of its six meetings with
USC. the Card's Head Coach
Mark Marquess believes that his
club's 11-4 second-half league
mark, best in the conference,
and the national ranking that
has resulted should carry the
Cardinal to the Regionals.
"Realistically, I think that
we're one of the top 36 teams in
the country," said Marquess,

who is a member of the commit
tee. "1 can make a good argu
ment to take us over (U)SC be
cause the committee isn't tied
into taking the second place
team."
Stanford could have
prevented all of this confusion
by completing a series sweep in
yesterday's season finale at
Berkeley. Instead, Cal bounced
back from defeats in the first
two games to record its only tri
umph in six meetings with Stan
ford behind a complete game
win by Bryan Price (9-3).
Stanford drew first blood with
a three-run second, highlighted
by Mark Davis' two-run ground
rule double. Cal answered with
four runs off loser Kevin Kunkel
(3-7) in their half of the second
and built a 12-4 advantage as
McClain and Blankenship
tagged round-trippers off three

different Cardinal relievers.
Marquess was realistic about
the series outcome. " If you'd
have said that we'll take two out
of three from Cal before the se
ries, I'd have taken it."
Stanford moved closer to
navigating its unlikely course to
the playoffs with a 3-2 win on
Saturday before a large Sunken
Diamond crowd. The contest
marked the final home appear
ance for eight Stanford seniors,
including pitcher John Radtke
who stifled the Bears on just
five hits through eight innings.
Cal nicked Radtke for a fifth in
ning run for a 1-0 lead that
lasted until the eighth.
In the Cardinal eighth, a walk
and a single chased Cal hurler
Will Schock. Mike Deßenon
followed by greeting reliever
and loser Buddy Watts (3-4)
with a game tying single to left

field. Walt Harris gave the Card
a 2-1 lead when he looped an
RBI single down the right field
line after failing on two sacrifice
bunt attempts. But in the ninth
Blankenship, 8-for-12 in the se
ries, tagged Radtke's 3-1 pitch
over the left field fence to tie the
game.
Stanford finally won the dog
fight with a run in the bottom of
the ninth. Darryl Stephens was
hit by a pitch, sacrificed to
second and moved to third on
an infield hit by Harris. John
Verducci then scored Stephens
with a sacrifice fly.
The Cardinal opened the se
ries with an 8-4 extra inning vic
tory at California on Friday.
Each team tallied once in the
first two frames and Stanford
added another in the third to
take a 3-2 lead. The Bears,
however, responded with two

scores in their third and
nurtured a 4-3 cushion until the
seventh inning. After Rick
Lundblade's double, Deßenon
slapped an RBI single to right
field to tie the game at 4-4.
Reliever Rick Dietz bailed
out Jeff Ballard in the eighth
and chalked up a victory when
the Card scored four times in
the tenth — on a double, an in
tentional walk, two infield hits
and a bloop single. Dietz ran his
record to 4-1 with wins on both
Friday and Saturday. Bren Con
ner (7-6) absorbed the first
game loss.
Jack Clark and the San Fran
cisco Giants will forego a day of
rest to tackle the Cardinal this
Thursday at 1 p.m. in an exhibi
tion game to benefit the Stan
ford baseball program. Tickets
for the game are $4 for adults
and $2 for students and

children. For ticket information,
