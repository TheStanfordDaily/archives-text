matches were even played.
• | was all set to drive down to Disneyland
tomorrow and see if they had any new
rides," Stanford Head Coach 112 rank Bren
nan joked after the scare. "I kind of ex
pected some letdown, though. When you
beat someone twice, it's hard to do it the
third time. We were ready, but sub
consciuosly it's difficult to come out real
strong."

Elise Burgin was one Cardinal who didn't
tind that to be the case. Burgin was hot right
out of the gate, and she quicky defeated
Jane Thomas 6-2, 7-5, at fifth singles.

set win. After dropping arouple of early
games, she put away Karen Dewis, 6-4, 6-0.

set. 6-4. but she came back strong and to

back strong in recording a 2-6, 6-4. 6-4
decision.
At No. 4, Leigh Anne Eldredge wrapped
up the match for Stanford with a 4-6, 6-3. 6-
2 win over Lynne Lewis, as Stanford

singles, where Savides defeated Lori Miller,
6-1,7-6. .. i ,

defeated Melissa Seigler, 6-2, 6-3, at No. 2;
Gompert blanked Lisa Bobby, 6-0, 6-0. at
No. 3; Eldredge took Jody Trucks, 6-1, 6-4,
