# Netmen squeeze past Mustangs
## 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
Athens, Ga., is usually a quiet
town. But since Saturday, it's
been alive with the excitement
of the NCAA tennis champion
ships. The No. 3 ranked Stan
ford men's tennis team has
generated most of that excite
ment. The Cardinal won two
very close matches; first against
Clemson University and then
against Southern Methodist
University by identical scores of
5-4. Today it will meet the Uni
versity of Georgia in the semi
finals.
Head Coach Dick Gould
knew that the tournament
would be difficult, but the first
two rounds were a lot closer
than he expected. "They were
both cliff hangers," he said.
"I've probably lost 50 pounds
and gained a few more gray
hairs." Clemson entered the
match ranked No. 9 in the
country.
Because of a space limitation,
the teams could only play three
matches at a time, beginning
with No. I. No. 3 and No. 5
singles. Unfortunately. Stanford
fell behind 0-3 and needed to
win five of the remaining six
matches to stay alive in the
tournament.
The Card did come back. At
No. 4 singles. Mark McKeen
defeated Andy Krantz in
straight sets r>-3. 6-2. No. 2
singles plaver. Eric Rosenfeld.
came back to defeat Rick
Rudeen 3-6. 7-5. 6-3. John
Letts also needed three sets but
still knocked off Brandon Wal
ters 3-6. 7-5. 6-3.
Stanford's doubles teams.

which have struggled this
season, then rose to meet the
challenge. Rosenfeld and Dan
Goldie combined to defeat Wal
ters and Miguel Nido in straight
sets 6-4, 6-1. McKeen and Der
rick Rostagno wrapped up the
victory for the Cardinal with a
6-4, 6-0 win over Clemson's
Rudeen and Matt Frooman..
After ensuring the win, the Car
dinal defaulted at No. 1 doubles
in order to rest for yesterday's
match against SMU.
Although they played all six
singles matches at the same
time, Stanford fell behind 0-2,
as the first completed matches
went to SMU. "I thought 'oh,
no here we go again,' " Gould

said. "But we came back again
and the guys who lost on Satur
day won today(Sunday) and we
went into the doubles with an
other 3-3 tie."
This time the match wasn't
decided until the last set. Ed and
John Ross won for the Mustangs
by knocking off Rosenfeld and
Goldie 2-6, 6-2, 6-1. But
McKeen and Rostagno tied the
score again at 4-4 as they beat
Mark Styslinger and Peter
Xahurak 3-6, 6-3, 7-5. The
match came down to the No. 1
doubles pairings of Stanford's
Jim Grabb and John Letts and
SMU's Den Bishop and Kim
Forsythe. Stanford took the first
set. 7-6 but lost the second 6-7.

The third set appeared to be
headed to a tie-breaker as well,
as the teams continued to hold
service. But in the seventh
game, the Cardinal finally got a
service break and for the first
time in the match, Stanford was
ahead of SMU. The Cardinal
pair held on to win the final set,
6-4. With the win. the Cardinal
advanced into the semifinals.
Stanford's opponent today
will be the University of Geor
gia. l he Bulldogs were also in
volved in a close match as they
defeated No. 1-ranked and No.
2-seeded USC 5-4. UCLA and
Pepperdine will meet in the the
other semi-final match.
