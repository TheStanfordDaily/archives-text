# Soviets cloud 'boycott' issue
## 
### 
Moscow <AP) — In 1980, the Olympics
boycott smacked of spite and the Cold War —
because it was the idea of the United States
and the Games were being held in Moscow.
In 19N4. by contrast, the Soviets have taken
a principled, non-political and peaceloving
step by pulling out of the Games to be held in
the perilous, hostile and warlike United States.
That, at least, is the view presented to most
Soviet citizens by their state-run media.
Both four years ago and now. the media
have mounted a growing campaign to present
the official point of view.
As in 1980. when Soviet leaders rarely
referred to the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow
Olympics, the propaganda blast has so far sub
stituted for public comment from President
Konstantin Chernenko or other top political
figures.
The scapegoat of both campaigns, of course.

has remained the same: the United States.
In 1 980. Soviet citizens were rarely told that
the U.S.-led boycott of the Olympic Games
had any connection with the massive march of
Soviet troops into Afghanistan in December
1979.
Instead, the American boycott was
portrayed as the work of "Cold War
troubadours" who, through "blackmail and
arm-twisting that was "in the spirit of the
worst era ol McCarthyism" pressured reluctant
athletes into refusing to go to the Moscow
Games.
President Jimmy Carter's boycott was also
portrayed as a malicious move to wreck the
Olympics Moscow had wanted for so long. Al
though the Soviets were undoubtedly hurt by
the 1980 boycott, the media now fiercely deny
that the Soviet boycott ot Los Angeles could
be motivated by anything so low as spite.
