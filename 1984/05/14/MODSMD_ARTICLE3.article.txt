## 
### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
The emphasis was on high tech at Satur
day's Idens In Action" conference sponsored
by. the Stanford Center For Entrepreneurship.
Featured speakers were local congressman
E<J /.schau, known as "a high-tech politician:"
Tom Peters, author of "In Search Of Excel
lence." a recent bestseller analyzing what
makes certain companies successful; and
William McGowan, chairman of MCI Com
munications. a company that competes with
American Telephone & Telegraph in the
long-distance call market.
Each of the three discussed Silicon Valley,
and its concentration in computer technology,
as an example of entrepreneurship at both its
best and worst, noting the large amounts of

money and the major mistakes one can so
easily make.
The vast majority of speakers at the confer
ence workshops also discussed technological
themes, from industry publications to starting
a new high-tech corporation.
/.schau spoke on the government's role in
entrepreneurship. The local congressman,
who chairs a task force in the House ot Repre
sentatives on industrial competition and high
technology, said he believes the government,
"rather than targeting on specific technologies
for industries (should) target on the
process of innovation."
/schau said the Japanese realize that the in
dustry of high technology is moving too
rapidly for the large corporations to keep up.
and they are studying the methods of Ameri

can entrepreneurs, particularly those in the
Silicon Valley, for ideas on how to improve
their own industries.
The four prerequisites Zschau cited for gov
ernment to be effective in fostering
entrepreneurship are a commitment to basic
research, incentives for risk taking, an effec
tive educational system and ample market op
portunities.
Peters discussed individual examples of out
standing entrepreneurship, such as Frank
Purdue, who went against conventional wis
dom and made a fortune from marketing
chickens.
Peters described four types of
entrepreneurship that lie had found: the start
up that turned into a giant, like Apple Com
puter; the giant that revitalized internally.

typified by IBM and PepsiCo; the non-Silicon
Valley company like that of Harry Oppen
heimer; and the federal government itself.
He spoke about more unusual and less
technically oriented entrepreneurs, such as
Purdue, Oppenheimer and A. Ray Smith,
whose minor league baseball team, the Louis
ville Redbirds, outdrew 30 percent of the
major league teams last year.
The companies that are exceptions to the
rule are the ones that are courteous to their
customers, Peters said. Service is often ne
glected by the larger companies or start-ups
that eventually find their customers leaving
them because of poor attention. For instance.
Smith attributes his success in sports to clean
stadium washrooms.
William McGowan said the "successful

promoter' will succeed, and the "successful
businessman" will fail. The involvement of
chief executive officers is essential, he said,
because the introduction of the new technol
ogy into a company in the most successful in
stances is most successfully done by the Chief
Executive Offices, mainly as a profit tool.
Ihe traits that speakers mentioned
repeatedly as characteristic of successful
entrepreneurs were creativity, vision, positive
thinking, enthusiasm, passion and determina
tion. Peters, who laced his speech with quota
tions from some of the nation's most success
ful entrepreneurs, cited a line of Peter
Drucker. "Whenever anything is being ac
complished, it is being done. I have learned,
by a monomaniac with a mission."
