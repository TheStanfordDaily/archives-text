## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Seniors PattiSue Plumer and Carol
;ady each won two events to lead
tanford to its second straight West
rn Collegiate Athletic Association
rack and Field Championship this
weekend at Stanford Stadium.
Plumer, the 5000-meter national
ollegiate record holder, doubled Sat
rday in the 1500 and 5000, winning
tie 1500 with a time of 4 minutes,
0.4 seconds, just fast enough to edge
ut teammates Alison Wiley and Cory
chubert, who completed the Stanford
weep in the event.
Plumer won the 5000 in 15:48.6,
early 20 seconds off her record but
asily good enough for the victory,
ophomore Wiley, who won the 3000
n Friday, finished second in the
000.
Cady, the leading collegiate discus
hrower this year, surpassed tough
ompetition from San Diego State
mh a toss of 202-7. She also won the
hot put with a spectacular throw of
6-10%.
t Other Stanford winners were senior
arcia Martin, who won the 800 in
05.93, and freshman Pam Board,
Lho won the 400-meter hurdles in
9.74, setting a new University
Ecord.
Stanford finished with 170 points,
bllowed by Arizona State with 135,
krizona with 103V2, San Diego State
lith 71'/2, USC with 64, Long Beach
tate with 22 and UCLA with 19.
[ "I was happy with the results,"
flumer said. "My goal was not neces
jarily winning every race, but having
s finish 1-2-3 or as well as possible in
py races."
Plumer, who took second behind
Viley in the 3000 on Friday, said she

did not put 100 percent effort into any
of her three races. "Had there been a
different-colored jersey next to me in
the 1500, 1 would have gone harder."
she said.
The Stanford women are looking
ahead to the NCAA Championships
in two weeks and especially to the
U.S. Olympic Trials in mid-June.
Plumer, who will run the 3000 in the
trials, assuming the 5000-meter run is
not added to the women's events,
hopes to break her personal best of
8:53, which she ran indoors, by at
least eight seconds.

"I'm getting more and more opti
mistic about my chances." Plumer
said. "I have the endurance. I need to
get faster. I'll be mainly training, not
racing, until the trials. What I'll be
doing is working on my last two laps
(of the distance race)."
Freshman standout Schubert has
also qualified for the Olympic Trials at
3000 meters and hopes to fare well
there despite injuries from the past
year and a recent bout with respira
tory flu.
Schubert, who finished third in both
the'lsoo and 3000, said she ran the

M)()() Saturdav afternoon solel> tor a
workout. But she came in fourth with
ii personal best of 16:17 that easik
met the NCAA qualitying standard.
"The pain is worth it." she con
cluded.
Martin's winning 800-meter time
was less than one second short of the
2:05 necessary to qualify for the
Olympic Trials in that event.
"I was running to qualify, so I was
kind of disappointed." she said. Mar
tin. Stanford's 200 and 400-meter
record holder, said she is not used to
running the longer race but hopes to
meet the Olympic qualifying time later
this season, possibly at the upcoming
NCAA Championships.
Martin established a lead about
midway through the 800 on Saturday
and held on to win against a tight pack
of frontrunners. "I was really happy
(to win the race)." she said.
Martin said she might have shaved a
second off her time had she broken
into her final sprint with 300 rather
than 200 meters left in the race.
400-meter hurdles champion
Board, whose time was three-tenths of
a second off the NCAA qualifying
standard, said she also could have cut
down her time if she had not made
some mistakes in her cadence. Board
also finished third in the 100-meter
hurdles but said that because she has
more strength than speed and "not
great technique," the 400 is her better
hurdle race.
Plumer, whose 5000-meter victory
marked her final collegiate race at
Stanford, said she was sad because "it
represents another change in my life.
' But it was a positive ending. I feel
really good about it," she said. "My
(track career) here has been enhanc
ing as far as personal growth."


y
Freshman Cory Schubert had little competition other than her
teammates as she raced to a pair of third-place finishes and one fourth
at the WCAA Championships this weekend.
