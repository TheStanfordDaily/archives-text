### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
Female students in' University
dormitories Arroyo. Soto. Trancos
and Burbunk have recently re
ported a slew of incidents in which
unknown males harrass them in
women's bathrooms of those
dorms.
According to an Arroyo resident
assistant, the Wilbur dorm has ex
perienced several cases of harrass
ment in the past year. The most
recent complaint involved a man
watching a woman as she was
taking a shower.
About a week before that inci
dent. a vandal put "graphic por
nography" on the walls of a wo
men's bathroom there.
Earlier in the year, one of the
female residents was asked by a
stranger if she had a pair of pants
he could wear. When she said no.
he left, but he later returned, took
a pair of blue jeans out of her
closet, and put them on before
fleeing.
A Trancos RA reported that a
man had come into the women's
bathroom and had run his hand
down the back of a woman taking a
shower.
One Soto resident who noticed a
man watching her as she was taking
a shower was able to give police a
good description of the suspect, a
dorm RA said.
In Burbank. a man repeatedly
entered the women's bathroom but
tied when a resident who was about
to take a shower screamed.

All women's bathrooms in the
dorms where voyeurs have been
spotted have had locks installed or
re-keyed tor the residents' protec
tion.
Wilbur and Stern RAs have
received a liver with the descrip
tion of one of the men alleged to
have committed at least one of
these acts.
Descriptions of the men vary
widely from incident to incident,
but the liver describes a man about
5-foot-y. with sandy brown hair
and a beard, dressed as a student.
Other reports describe a beardless
man or "a dark-skinned man."
A Trancos resident said she con
sidered the new locks bothersome
but necessary.
One informed police source said
that reports of voyeurism and ex
hibitionism are common in spring,
as soon as the weather becomes
warm. Although the voyeurs do not
generally exhibit any violent be
havior. they have been known to
rummage through dorm rooms
which have been left unlocked, the
source said.
The source said the men who
commit these acts, if caught, will be
charged with trespassing, or in ex
treme cases, indecent exposure. In
some cases, violators have a history
of sexual offenses, the source said.
The police said they are cur
rently working with descriptions of
two men. Victims' failure to report
incidents promptly or at all has
made it more difficult to catch the
assailants, the source said.
