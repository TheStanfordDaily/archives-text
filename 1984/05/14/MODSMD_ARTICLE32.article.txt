Can I get a witness?

In accordance with an annual Daily
tradition, today's issue was written
and laid out solely by first-year staf
fers. Veteran staff members and Troy
Eid attempted to foil the efforts of
Chief Richard Lynch and Company,
but to no avail.
Beginning a new tradition, we have
chosen to give out some first-year staf
fers awards today.
