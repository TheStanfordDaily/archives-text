### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
Friday marked the culmination of the tenth annual Gay
and Lesbian Awareness (GALA) Week at Stanford, with
University President Donald Kennedy on hand to offer
some personal comments and to cut a ceremonial ribbon.
University Library Specialist Andy I.isac opened the an
niversary reception, calling it a celebration of "not only
our origins but our future."
"Ten years ago." he said, "a couple of students in this
crowd started what was to become Gay Awareness Week.
That took creativity, vigor and a lot of courage to convince
people that a band of crazy students . . . had something
positive and valuable to say about diversity at Stanford."
Senior Jeff Williams. GALA press spokesperson, added
comments on the achievements of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS) over the past ten years.
"In '73 we saw a non-discrimination policy in the Law
School, and in '76 we saw books and publications dealing
with homosexuality in the open shelves of the libraries."
Williams said.
He said surveys indicate that incoming freshmen have

little understanding of gay men and women, "though up
perclassmen have a much better understanding and
tolerance tor lifestyles different from their own. I'd like to
think that organizations like GLAS are responsible for this
increasing awareness." he said.
"We're celebrating these and other achievements today,
but we must realize that the war is not over even when
some battles are won." Williams said. "Ultimately we
need an atmosphere in which we can reintegrate ourselves
with the community as a whole with one difference — that
we're completly out of the closet."
Kennedy was the final speaker at the reception.
"I'm very glad to be here." he said, thanking GLAS for
the invitation. "I came for two very good reasons. The les*
important one is that I'm president of this whole univer
sity and not just some parts of it. The second is that I have
friends here."
"There's a third reason too." Kennedy added. •I'm
grateful tor what a lot of the people in this room have done
for this University. In a general way. you've provided all
kinds of services and intellectual enlightenment to this
place.
