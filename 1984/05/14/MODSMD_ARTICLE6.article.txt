19 die in Lebanese shelling
Beirut, Lebanon — At least 19 persons were counted
dead yesterday and scores more were injured after a night of
heavy fighting along the Green Line between. East and West
Beirut, in the capital s southern suburbs and in the mountains
to the cast.
Lebanese media described the battles as the heaviest since
May 5 and 6, when 24 persons were killed and 134 wounded.
As in last week s lighting, participants in the violence that
broke out Saturday used weapons ranging from rifles to 155-
mm field cannon.
Casualty counts from yesterday included 70 injured, though
authorities indicated the list could grow.
I he renewed outbreak of fighting dashed hopes here that
the near-final formation of a government of national unity
and the establishment of a buffer zone between rival Chris
tian and Moslem militias in the capital would hinder fresh
warfare in the city.
Exchanges of tire began Saturday in the early evening, just
shortly after a demonstration in West Beirut by a children's
theater group and Beirut residents demanding an end to the
country's 10-year-old civil war.
1 he march originally had been scheduled to take place May
b, but organizers postponed it after fighting rocked the city the
day before.
Explosions of heavy grenades could be heard in much of
Beirut until well past midnight Sunday, and machine-gun fire
continued until after dawn.
Political observers said the latest eruption of violence ap
parently resulted from the failure of Christian and Moslem
leaders in Premier Rashid Karami's Cabinet to agree in talks
last week on what future role the army should play in
Lebanon.
Scientist says Soviet Union
will match U.S. space defense
Washington — President Reagan's decision to launch
a $28 billion "Star Wars" space defense program is extremely
dangerous and poses "a problem of life and death" for the
American and Soviet people, says a leading Soviet scientist.
Recalling the "terrible period" between 1945 and 1949
when the United States had a nuclear monopoly, and the
losses suffered during the Nazis' surprise attack in June 1941,
academician E.F. Velikkov said the Soviets are determined to
match the United States if it goes ahead with the project.
"How do we solve this problem, which is very difficult?" he
asked late last week in an interview. "With more and more
money, with more and more scientists, more and more work."
But Velikkov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, quickly added: "We do not wish to increase ten
sions." He said the two governments should come to an
agreement before incurring enormous expense and risk.
Authorized by Reagan last year, the long-term research
program would explore the use of futuristic technology to
destroy Soviet nuclear missiles before they reach their targets.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said last month that
the Soviets have been working on such a system since 1967
and that it is vital the United States undertake the effort. "If
they should get it first, it would be a very, very dangerous
world," he said.
But many in the American scientific community consider
the prospects of a space-based defense system dim as well as
in conflict with thp 1972 U.S.-Soviet treaty severely limiting
missile defenses on both sides. <• ■ r •
Church-led talks to release
Solidarity leaders collapse
Warsaw, Poland —Church-led negotiations aimed at win
ning freedom for 11 top Solidarity independent trade union
officials still in Polish jails collapsed over the weekend when
the prisoners rejected a government offer of conditional
release, a source close to the talks said yesterday.
In a long meeting Saturday with a group of senior lay ad
visors to the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church, the 11
turned down an offer worked out earlier in talks between
Polish bishops and top government officials, the source said.
"One can envisage that there could be more negotiations,
but I personally doubt it,"the source added.
The rejection appears to put Poland's authorities in a diffi
cult situation at a moment when they would clearly like to
resolve the problem of political prisoners as a way to ease so
cial tensions at home and to improve relations with Western
governments.
The United States has made it clear that the fate of tne 11 is
crucial in determining when and if it will lift economic sanc
tions imposed against Poland after authorities proclaimed
martial law in December 1981, to bring an end to the reform
movement led by the Solidarity union.
House expected to block MX
Washington — House Speaker Thomas "Tip' O Neill (D-
Mass.) said Saturday the House will probably vote this week
to block authorization of money for production of the MX
missile.
"I want to announce here today that I believe we have the
votes in the House of Representatives to stop the production
of the MX," O'Neill said. "1 am confident that we will put the
br'kes on this accelerating nuclear arms race by the end of
th week."
i a commencement address at Salem State College in
M sachusetts, O'Neill said, "We simply cannot afford to
n i into a new generation of first-strike nuclear weapons
without achieving an agreement to limit their deployment.
A copy of the speech was released in Washington.
When it takes up a $208 billion defense authorization bill,
the House is expected to vote on an amendment that would
delete $2.5 billion earmarked for the MX, a land-based inter
continental missile that President Reagan says is a vital part
of his military strategy.
O'Neill noted that similar motions on the MX fell short last
year by margins of only 13 and nine votes.
Tanker bombed in Persian Gulf
Kuwait — The Kuwaiti-owned oil tanker Um Kusba was
hit in Persian Gulf waters early yesterday by a missile fired
from an unidentified jet fighter, the Kuwaiti news agency
KUNA reported.
Over the past two weeks Iraqi warplanes have hit two
Saudi-owned tankers, the Safinat Al-Arab and the Al-
Ahood, after the Swedish-operated ships loaded oil at Iran's
Kharg Island oil terminal.
2.1 tons of marijuana seized
San Clemente, Calif. — A horse trailer purportedly full of
alfalfa turned out to contain an entirely different sort of grass
— 2.1 tons of marijuana valued at $3.3 million, authont.es
The 4?00 pounds of pot were found Thursday at a border
checkpoint three miles south of San Clemente and 60 miles
north of San Diego on Interstate 5, agents said Saturday

And even before that, I don't believe we ever seized a load
that big," said H.R. Mitchell, assistant agent in charge.
