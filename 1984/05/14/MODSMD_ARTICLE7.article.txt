## U.S. says Cuba planning an offensive 
### 
from the l.os Angeles Times
Washington — President Reagan's national securitv
adviser charged yesterday that Cuba was planning a
massive offensive by leftist guerrillas in El Salvador
before the U.S. presidential election this falj. and urged
increased military aid to help the Salvadoran army con
front any such attack.
"The indications are that the Cuban decision is to
seek to roughly double the level of effort of the rebels
in El Salvador." National Securitv Adviser Robert
McFarlane told reporters on NBC News' "Meet the
Press."
Administration officials had previously forecast a
guerrilla offensive this fall, but McFarlane's comments
were the first public warning of an alleged Cuban
directed buildup in rebel strength. He appeared intent
on reinforcing the central argument of President
Reagan's speech on Central America last Wednesday
— that leftist insurgencies there are directed by Cuba
and the Soviet Union.
"We believe honestly that the only way the Sal
vadoran government is going to be able to deal with
that (a guerrilla offensive) is to prepare the army in
terms of training and equipment and so forth, to be able
to preempt it,"he said.
McFarlane did not explain what he meant by a
"doubling" of the Salvadoran guerrillas' effort, but
when a reporter asked whether he foresaw a massive
leftist push like the l 968 Tet offensive in South Viet

nam. lie responded. "I think so. ves."
He indicated that his forecast was based on secret in
telligence reports, and said the administration had
shared its evidence with Congress.
Another U.S. official, who asked not to be identified,
said most administration experts on Central America
expected a guerrilla offensive, but not all were con
vinced of the reports that Cuba has decided to support
a massive buildup.
"We know there will be an offensive this fall because
there has been an offensive everv tall." he said. Oppor
tunities for militarv operations in Central America are
improved in the fall, after the end of the rainv season.
The State Department estimates that guerrilla
strength has already doubled in the last two years, from
approximately 4500 in I 9X2 to about 10.000 this year.
Salvadoran leftist sources have suggested that the
guerrillas may launch a major offensive before the No
vember election because they believe President Reagan
will send U.S. aircraft or troops into battle against them
if he is re-elected.
McFarlane said the United States might find itself
facing the issue of putting troops into combat in Central
America "if we don't do enough right now to enable
the Salvadorans (and) Hondurans to do it themselves."
"The United States has not, is not now, (and) I don't
anticipate will plan in the future for the involvement of
U.S. troops in combat in Central America. Our ex
pectation is the Salvadorans can do the job if they're

given enough in the way of resources." he said.
Hut asked what the administration would do it the
Salvadorans appeared headed tor defeat. McFarlane
said: "The United States — at all times, and today —
will defend its interests. That condition simply doesn't
exist today, and I'm confident we can prevent its occur
rence."
He said the administration had attempted to display
flexibility in talks with Nicaragua's leftist leaders, and
denied that the United States was seeking to overthrow,
their regime.
"We have no particular interest in the outcome of the
complexion of that government, as long as it provides
for pluralism." he said.
But he also strongly defended the administration's,
light to engage in covert paramilitary action against
other governments, such as the Central Intelligence
Agency's program of mining Nicaragua's harbors. -
"In the late part of the 2()th century we arc going to'
face in many countries — not only Central America —■
a determined effort bv the Soviet Union to subvert
friendly governments." McFarlane said. "Now when,
they do that, using great violence, do the American'
people really want their president ... to have no other
options than to go to war or to do nothing? I don't think
so."
McFarlane said he believed CIA Director William
Casey, who was widely criticized in Congress for the
mining, was "doing a fine job."
