From The Washington Post
Washington — Treasury Sec
retary Donald Regan yesterday
muted his recent criticism of the
Federal Reserve Board's role in
rising interest rates, but he
maintained that the Fed is partly
responsible for the increase.
Regan, who twice last week
publicly blamed the Fed for the
increase in the prime interest
rate from 12 to 12.5 percent,
told reporters yesterday that not
only was the central bank at
fault for the rise, but that
Congress also was responsible

because of its inaction on Presi
dent Reagan's deficit-reduction
plan.
Regan refused yesterday to
directly criticize the Fed or
Council of Economics Advisers
Chairman Martin Feldstein,
who responded over the
weekend to Regan's criticism of
the Fed by saying that the trea
sury secretary was calling for a
policy that would "lead to an in
crease in inflation next year."
Regan maintained yesterday
that he does not see inflation as
a problem within the next three

to six months.
Regan also reiterated his con
cern of last week that if the
central bank continues its mon
etary policies, it could lead to a
recession. He stressed Sunday
that high interest rates could
hurt the economic expansion,
not in the medium term, but in
the long run. "Most economists
seem to agree, this recovery can
last through this year," Regan
said.
Regan said yesterday that the
interest rate rise could be attrib
ted to "a combination of mon-

etary and fiscal policies." He
noted that Congress has had
plenty of time to act on the pres
ident's proposal for a "down
payment" on the federal budget
deficit.
Regan, contrary to Feldstein
and other leading economists,
maintained yesterday that there
is enough credit available to
preclude an increase in interest
rates. He said that credit
demand is "not overwhelming"
and that the rate of savings has
risen, so those factors could not
have caused the interest rate in

crease.
Feldstein and other
economists have said the
demand lor credit by businesses,
consumers and the government
is the cause of rising rates, not
conditions imposed by the
Federal Reserve.
When asked to comment on
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker's statement this
weekend that the Fed cannot
control interest rates "the way
people seem to think we can,"
Regan replied, "Nobody wants
to be blamed for anything."
