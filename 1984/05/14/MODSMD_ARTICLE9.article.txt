Ffom The Washington Post
San Francisco — Jesse Jackson said
Saturday night that neither of his Demo
cratic rivals could defeat President
Reagan next fall without Jackson's help
and that for the first time he would
"keep all options open" on the possibil
ity of a vice-presidential nomination.
Jackson, who has begun an intensive
week of campaigning for the California
primary, said in answer to a question in
an interview that he had not considered
or discussed seeking the No. 2 spot on
ihe Democratic ticket until now.
PreVh/usly Jackson has reacted
negatively to any suggestion of accepting
second place on the ticket, an aide said.
"Of course, in representing the
'rainbow' (coalition) 1 must keep all op
tions open so as to make room within the
party for my constituency," Jackson said.
Asked whether he thought Walter
Mondale or Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.)
would risk choosing a black running
mate, Jackson replied:

"I don't know ... , (but) part of my (
mission this year is to remove any c
remaining doubt about the ability of the l
locked-out to serve at any level. 1
"I've tried to conduct mysetf in such a 1
way at these (presidential) debates to es
tablish that I have the stamina and the
grasp of the issues — the sense of the
breadth of America — that would qualify
me to represent the interests of many
people," he added.
Jackson discussed the role he hopes to
pt;>\ lUn mt; and atU-l Ou IX mo
to San Francisco Saturday evening.
He said that in private conversations
with Mondale and Hart he has pushed
for one or more summit meetings of the
three candidates before the convention
to iron out differences over party rules
and the platform.
The candidates and their staffs have
maintained informal contact in recent
months in an effort to minimize in
traparty rancor. Both Jackson and Hart

contend that Mondale, the front-runner,
cannot win enough committed delegates
to lock up the presidential nomination
before the July convention, although
Mondale disagrees.
During the interview, Jackson insisted
that neither Mondale nor Hart could
defeat Reagan "on the strength of his
personality or his personal appeal," and
that the Democrats could win this fall
only "if the team is together."
"We're the three survivors out of eight
•(Democratic presidential candidates),
we «.yp
"Sfituencies, ' Jackson said.
He was referring to his overwhelming
support among blacks and other
minorities. Hart's appeal to young whites
and Mondale's widespread support
among organized labor.
Jackson said he would push for strong
platform planks supporting efforts to
help the poor, the unemployed and the
small farmers.
He said he would also hold fast to his

demands for an end to party runoff pri
maries and party rules that deny
delegates to minority candidates who fail
to reach a certain threshold of popular
votes in primary elections.
Jackson claims that the threshold rules
have cheated him out of delegates.
Jackson expressed strong dissatisfac
tion with the leadership of Democratic
National Chairman Charles Manatt, but
said he would not seek his ouster betore
the convention.

reporters mat Jackson had given as

"We never considered walking out of
the convention," Jackson said. "To proj

speculation about our motives. ... I've
tried all my life to get into the conven
tion. I could not represent my constitu
ents in the streets. To say that is uncalled
