TASK FORCE TO STUDY
FRATERNITIES and
SORORITIES at STANFORD
The Task Force will hold a public forum to discuss the following two
issues:
a. There is a strong sentiment that subjective selectivity and housing are
incompatible and the Task Force is considering alternatives to the current
situation.
b. The Task Force is still questioning the place of the subjective selective groups
at Stanford, including Universiy recognition of such groups, and the allocation of
resources to such groups.
The Task Force seeks the views of the Stanford community on these subjects.
The public form will be held at 3:30 p.m., May 15,
in 281 Tresidder Union.
