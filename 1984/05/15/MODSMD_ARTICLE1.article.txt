# Temp worker fired
## Cites Daily article 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
Jessie Solorio, a temporary worker
in the Labor Shop, said he was fired by
the University in retaliation for
speaking to The Daily about Stan
ford's use of temporary labor.
Solorio was the only worker who
permitted the use of his name in The
Daily's April 10 article. He claims his
May 4 dismissal was a direct result of
his published comments.
The April 10 article described Uni
versity use of long-term temporary
workers and the United Stanford
Workers' (USW) opposition to the
policies.
University officials deny The Daily
article had anything to do with
Solorio's firing. Herb Fong, manager
of Operations and Maintenance, said
Solorio was fired for "threatening"
and "verbally abusing" a supervisor.
Solorio denied he "threatened"
Larry Atwater, supervisor of
Grounds, saying he and Atwater had
an old friendship. He said his
"threats" were purely in jest and not
out of the ordinary.
Linda Crouse, president of USW,
said rough language and "threats"
made in jest were common among to
Labor Shop workers and supervisors.
"They would have to fire, the entire
Labor Shop," she said.
Atwater claims Solorio's threats
were not in jest and he took them
seriously.
Crouse said a bargaining unit em
ployee faced with the same charge
would have received a "slap on the
wrist" but since Solorio had spoken to
the press and was a temporary, the
University made an example of him.
Fong said any employee who
•■threatens" a supervisor would be
subject to the same penalty.
The Grounds Shop filled five per
manent positions in April. Solorio ap
plied for a position but was not cho

sen. Solorio, along with two other
"temporaries," had between six
months and a year of experience at
Stanford. All three of them were from
the Labor Shop and none was given a
permanent position.
Solorio was given two weeks pay
upon his dismissal. Temporary
laborers, according to the 1982 USW
collective agreement, are not required
any notice of dismissal or severance
pay in lieu of notice.
