## The 						Stanford Daily Sakharov to Stanford

It's hard to tell who's killing Andrei Sakharox.

dent banished to the closed citx of Gorky in 19S0.
'kit there's a chance Stanford could help rescue
him. if Stanford acts now.
In the most direct sense. Sakharox is killing
himself. The Nobel laureate launched an "open
ended" hunger strike nearly txvo weeks ago in
retaliation for the arrest of his wife, Yelena Bon
ner. who was charged xvith treason.
Bonner has suffered three heart attacks and the
loss nt one eye. She needs medical care in the
West, and her husband is prepared to die unless
she gets that care.
But for Sakharov, who successfully launched a
hunger strike two years ago to secure the im
migration of his daughter to the United States,
the killer could be the Soviet system. It could be
the irony of being persecuted as a "criminal" bx a
government incriminating itself.
With Bonner's confinement and the severing of
the last link between Gorky and the outside
world, we don't really know whether Sakharox is
alive or dead. But we can help find out — indeed,
we can help Sakharov and Bonner and the spirit
of freedom worldwide — if we follow the lead of
Stanford's Sidney Drell and Paul Flory.
