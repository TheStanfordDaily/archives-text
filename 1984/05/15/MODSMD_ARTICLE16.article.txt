## Editorials 'rich in rhetoric' 
### 
As a campus newspaper. The Daily
has the right and responsibility to ex
press editorial opinions. It is not.
however. The Daily's responsibility to
lead a crusade against fraternities.
Two weeks ago (April 24) The
Daily ran an editorial "Greek discrim
ination." In the editorial it was advo
cated that fraternities be placed in the

VIEWPOINT

campus draw. Apparently unsatisfied,
however. The Daily decided to ham
mer the point home with a second edi
torial "Fill frats through Draw,"
(Daily, May 9). This editorial added
nothing to The Daily's original edito
rial. It was unnecessary and served no
other purpose than to support a niis
ieading and inaccurate \ine ot thought..
The editorials run have been rich in
rhetoric, Mi? •ffmftrtf-'in*fnrf*. They
have also been misleading. The Daily
would like its readers to believe that
placing fraternities in the Draw would
improve them. There is simply no in
formation to support this opinion.
What is closer to the truth is such a
move would essentially eliminate
fraternities from campus. They would
become nothing more than four-class
dormitories.

The Daily argues that the l niver
sit\ should not provide housing tor a
"system that is self-selective " I his.
tot), is a step toward eliminating
fraternities. I nlike many other uni
versity and college campuses that en
compass residential living areas. Stan
ford's campus is isolated from the
community. Not only is residential
housing geographically unsuitable, it is
economically unfeasible in the expen
sive Palo Alto area.
This past rush, more than 200 per
sons expressed an interest in Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. Similar figures were
recorded at other fraternities. This
type of information is an indication
that many Stanford students are
seeking an alternative to current living
arrangements. The elimination of
fraternities would only weaken the di
versity o\ campus \uiusmu, •avAi\aV>\e
nnd further limit the options of the
students.
The Daily also states that frater
nities are nothing more than social
theme houses. This is a gross
generalization and discriminatory
statement. Fraternities do have parties
and they do have social functions, but
so does every other residence on
campus. Why the double standard?
In reality, fraternities and their

members are nwvwv ' ex et> u - ca ot
the campus and commun:t\ drama,
athletics, journalism, campus politics,
blood dri\e>. Bic Brothers, the Special
Oh mpics and more I hese projects
are often brought about onl\ because
of a eohesix eness \\ hich exists between
good friends with similar ideals — a
cohesiveness not always found in four
class residences.
This cohesivencss is the foundation
for fraternity living and can only be
brought about by members living with
individuals who have common goals
and common interests. Without this
cohesivencss. a fraternity loses its per
sonality and its strongest quality. It
becomes a hollow shell with many
rooms and not much more. This is not
the kind of residential housing Stan
ford needs.
■ Fraternities have existed on college
and university campuses for hundreds
of years. They can be found at many of
the most prestigious campuses in the
nation. Yet. individuals at Stanford
feel that fraternities don't belong here.
This is not only an elitist attitude, but
at a university that likes to believe it is
rich in diversity and liberal in its think
ing. it is hypocritical.
