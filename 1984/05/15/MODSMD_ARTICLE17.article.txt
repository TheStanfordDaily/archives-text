## What makes an expert an expert 
### 
In your report on Prof. Freeman
Dyson's lecture on nuclear arms
(Daily, May 9). the headline read
"Arms expert Dyson calls for dis
aunament." However, Dyson is not
an arms expert.
He is a good and gentle man who
happens to be a first-rate nuclear
physicist and who has recently written
a very interesting book on war in the
20th century based on his own life.
That does not make him an arms
expert.
Arms experts are people who

spend their lives studying interna
tional relations, world history, strat
egy and the causes of wars. The
British historian Michael Howard
who visited Stanford a couple of
weeks ago could properly he called an
arms expert. All the nuclear physicists
and other natural scientists who speak
out on the problems of international
war and peace cannot be so called —
unless, of course, they are supermen
who are able to study all the relevant
topics in addition to those of their
main profession.

One of the most serious problems
of the contemporary debate on nu
clear arms and on war and peace is
the extent to which people qualified
in their own fields are able to gain
credibility in the public mind as
"arms experts" simply because they
are scientists. Scientists, however, as
history shows us, are often
notoriously bad at political analysis
and judgment.
