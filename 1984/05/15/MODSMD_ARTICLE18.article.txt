# Problems of the Olympic Games
## 
### 
No. the Soviets didn't announce they were going
to boycott the Olympics. They aren't
"boycotting." they're just "not going to partici
pate." And they didn't "announce" it — they just
"said so in their newspaper." These distinctions
are important.
The Soviets gave the excuse that they were
worried about the safety of their athletes — this
despite special nun-skid tracks and free "I Love
1..A." kneepads.
"I've always said that communists were sissies."
said President Reagan, just back from China.
"They're not coming to the Olympics since they're
afraid of the power of free enterprise. The Soviets
have not accepted our assurances that they will be
welcomed with goodwill and respect because they
are a pathetic bunch of paranoid slugs."
When asked to elaborate on the president's
comments about the Soviets. Press Secretary Larry
Speakes stuck his thumbs in his ears, waggled his
hands and said. "Nyah. nyah. nyah.
James Carter, of Plains. Ga.. told a
reporter. "I think it's a mistake tor the Soviets to
drag politics into the sacred institution ot the
Olympics. Once they set a precedent, everyone is
going to want to boycott."
Carter is a former governor ot Georgia.
Of course, it isn't just safety that makes the
Soviets hesitant to come here. Because they are
socialists, the people there have nothing to eat but
sawdust, yet they have to wait in long lines to buy
caviar tor the KC3B agent that lives in each home.
Athletes will be eager to exchange this life for
America's many freedoms — including the
freedom to earn big bucks endorsing breakfast

The Communist Party tried to counter this
threat by offering athletes big bucks to do
propaganda spots. Something like this: "After a
hard day of training for the people's Olympic
team, there's just one thing I want to do: cut down
on absenteeism and increase productivity."

Or: "Hi. I'm a world-class pole vaulter and dis
cus thrower. You know why? Cause I believe in
Lenin brand communism."
This program, however, could not compete with
the tempting offers made by such groups as the
"Ban the Soviets Committee," which promised
press coverage, lawyers, accommodations, a com

plete set of lawn furniture and an "I defected at the
'84 Olympics" T-shirt to any Soviet who would
come over. I was even thinking of emigrating and
then defecting back.
The Soviet move raises some tricky questions for
American policy. And now that the East Germans
refuse to come as well, do we get stuck with all the
gold medals? This might cause an inflationary
surge that could strangle the infant recovery.
One step the U.S. could take is to field a sur
rogate Soviet team — perhaps composed of Robin
Williams, who was an excellent Russian in Moscow
on the Hudson. Or we could use Soviet emigrees —
Mikhail Baryshnikov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn
leap to mind.
On the other hand, since these are the first
Olympics sponsored by private business and de
signed to make a profit, perhaps the Soviet boycott
isn't such a bad thing. Who wants to watch a
steroid-addicted Red snatch medals from
wholesome American kids? That's not going to
help your ratings.
In fact, perhaps we should spread the Soviet idea
around. We could organize "Ban the Germans"
and "Ban the Chinese" and "Ban the Brazilian"
campaigns. Then they'd all boycott, and we could
have the games all to ourselves, with maybe
Canada and a couple of little countries that would
be easy to beat.
And we should make football — real football,
where they tackle each other — an Olympic sport.
And get rid of that silly rule against professionals.
After all, if you can't make some money off of
sports, what's the use of having Olympics?
