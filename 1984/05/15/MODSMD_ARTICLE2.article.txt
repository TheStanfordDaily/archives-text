# Newsweek denies Kaplan's libel claims
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Daily staff 
Newsweek magazine's attorneys
have asked that Law School Prof.
John Kaplan's libel suit against the
magazine be dismissed because,
among other reasons, the magazine
claims that it never directly called
Kaplan's popular course, "Criminal
Law and the Criminal Justice Sys
tem." a "mick."
In a brief filed with the U.S. District
Court in San Jose in preparation for a
May 25 hearing to dismiss,
Newsweek's attorneys claim that an
article entitled "A Giggle of Guts,"
which was published in the October
1983 issue of Newsweek On Campus,
does not "state that Professor
Kaplan's course 'was properly termed
a "mick," which is shorthand for a
"mickey mouse" course' as he
(Kaplan) alleges."
Kaplan orginally filed a $1 million
libel suit against Newsweek, charging
that the magazine printed false infor
mation with reckless disregard of the
truth and with intent to injure and dis
grace him.
The dispute over whether the maga
zine directly called Kaplan's course a
"m k" centers on the issue of whe
ther the article should be taken as a
whole.
Newsweek on Campus' article had a
general introduction in which it
quoted Tracy Svmons of Trinity Uni
versity as defining a "mick" course as
one where you can "study about an
hour for a test and get a 9N. The in
troduction also said that the following
article described an "all-American
team of I I gut courses."
The rest of the article consisted ot
I I summaries of courses given at dif
terent campuses. Kaplan's course was
one ol the 1 I courses.

Kaplan mailed a brief Friday to the
U.S. District Court in which he claims
that the article must be taken as a
whole.
"A reading of the entire article
shows that the one paragraph parsed
by defendant is not the only part of the
article relating to the plaintiff's
course." Kaplan writes in his brief.
But the suit also involves Newsweek
On Campus' summary of Kaplan's
course, in which the magazine states
that it "is recognized as the easiest five
credits a Stanford student can earn."
"It's not unusual to find students lis
tening to the lectures on portable
radios while sunning themselves on
the grassy slope above DeGuerre
Pool," the article said. The article also
said the course's only requirements
are a take-home midterm and a
multiple-choice final.
Newsweek's lawyers also claimed in
the brief that "the real problem here is
that Professor Kaplan is unable to
view 'A Giggle of Guts' as the
humorous article it is."
Kaplan quoted Plutarch in his brief
in answering this charge: " "Though
the boys throw rocks at the frogs in
sport, yet the frogs do not die in sport,
but in earnest.'
"What may be humorous to the
editors of Newsweek is not necessarily
humorous to those who bear the brunt
of such humor â€” particularly to those
who have devoted their adult lives to
teaching." Kaplan wrote. "The differ
ence between humor and ridicule is
often a difference of perspective and
in this respect the libel laws clearly
give preference to the plaintiff who
has been ridiculed rather than to the
humorous defendant."
Newsweek's brief also claims that
the article is like a "rex iexx of a theater
