VIEWPOINT

>erucc workers have made it clear they want United Stan
ford Workers. Local 680 to represent them. Originally,
management said it would not recognize Local 680 until it
had a \alid election. On a rainy day. 777 workers walked
to polls and voted to transfer their contract rights from
"15 to 680 and to have United Stanford Workers, Local
ftM) represent them and enforce and administer their con
tract. This was one of the largest votes in the union's his
tory. This election was conducted by an outside agency
using standards far stricter than required by law. Kennedy
did not like the result and now will not acknowledge them.
The second issue is who makes the law — Kennedy or
the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)? In 1973,
the bargaining unit had 1547 members. A total of 660
members voted for United Stanford Workers, Local 680
and the NLRB said Stanford was legally required to recog
nize the union. Now. in a significantly smaller bargaining

unit. voted for United Stanford Workers. Local 6NO
and suddenly that's not good enough tor Kennedy. The
tact is that the NI.RB will soon decide whether Stanford is
required by law to recognize United Stanford Workers.
II Kennedy were seriously concerned about the
"legality" of the situation, he would wait for the Nl.Rß's
decision. Instead, he has declared war on our union In
withholding dues, refusing to recognize union stewards
and taken other drastic actions. We believe these actions
are illegal and make Kennedy's intent clear.
Kennedy does not like United Stanford Workers. Local
bSO and is trying to "bust" it Kennedy has publicly stated
that United Stanford Workers is not a "responsible"
union. What he means is that United Stanford Workers is
not a company union. It vigorously enforces the contract
rights of its members and speaks up publicly against
abuses. Recently. Kennedy publicly admitted that Local
6NO is more militant and enforces the contract more
strictly. That says it all.
Kennedy is going to make union members fight every
inch of the way for recognition of our union.
If we have to, we will.
We think, however, that these episodes are unnecessary,
harmful to all members of the community and damaging to
the University's reputation.

Local 6H0.)
