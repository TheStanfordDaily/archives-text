## A 						tiresome, fruitless debate 
### 
After watching the situation idly as
an undergraduate for two years and.
having my typewriter out anyway to
complete a paper, I finally feel the
need to respond to Professors John
Manley and Ronald Rebholz's con
stant recall for an "open, public

VIEWPOINT

forum" and other matters regarding
the Hoover Institution.
As my memory of U.S. history
recalls, Hamilton and Jefferson
debated what would he contained in
the U.S. Constitution behind closed
doors. Although the results of their
deliberations were available immedi
ately. the notes of the debate and what
each person said were not published
until nearly 50 years after the Con
stitutional Convention. This was to
protect the makers of the Constitution
and allow conflicting and sometimes
vehement debate to occur.
More recently, 1 just read about the
ASSU closing the doors to its last
meeting because senators were

"baring their souls." 1 am not saying
that closed debate is the best method
in every situation, but it serves a pur
pose in certain situations and I believe
this is one of those situations.
If Manley and Rebholz truly want to
discuss the Hoover Institution with its
members rather than continue the
asinine ideological debate they are
carrying on with only one view — their
own — in The Daily, then a closed
meeting would seem to satisfy their in
satiable outcries that have occurred
over the past two years.
Additionally, I feel that Manley and
Rebholz are continuing their "debate"
simply on the basis of partisan politics,
despite the verbal disguises they are
using. As an undergraduate, I am
pleased that members of the Stanford
community are participating in the
public sector. University President
Donald Kennedy was director of the
Food and Drug Administration under
President Carter, if my memory serves
me correctly. 1 have also seen flyers
around campus announcing a faculty
member running as a Democrat for

Congress. Their associations with par
tisan politics have not injured this
University and I don't think the ac
tions of such intelligent Hoover Fel
lows as Martin Anderson (who related
his first-hand experiences in helping
formulate the all-volunteer armed
forces to my Political Science 007 class
last spring) have either. II all ol us are
as smart as everyone keeps telling us
we are, then I cannot think of any bet
ter public servants, regardless of our
personal views.
Finally, if the trustees are convinced
that no major problem exists after
their thorough investigation, I think
that I can agree. I hope Manley and
Rebholz get their questions answered
— but I don't think the entire Univer
sity needs to rehash something that
has been put to rest; other problems
must be worked out. As for one, Reb
holz, 1 was a student in Great Works
of Western Culture — the program of
which you are the director.
