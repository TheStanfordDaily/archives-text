## L.A. schools only obstacle to netters' NCAA sweep Women face USC 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Los Angeles — Bring on the
Trojans! The Stanford women's
tennis team advanced to today's
NCAA championship match
with a 7-2 victory over San
Diego State yesterday at the Los
Angeles Tennis Center.
Stanford's victory over the
sixth-seeded Aztecs came as no
surprise to anyone. That the
netters will face USC did. The
Trojans defeated No. 1-seeded
Trinity, 5-4, in the biggest upset
of the tournament to advance to
today's match at the LATC.
Trinity's Louise Allen, the
No. 5-ranked player in the na
tion. tore ligaments in her knee
after winning her first set over
Kelly Henry, and was forced to
default. Allen came out for the
doubles heavily taped, but the
knee gave out again in warm
ups and she was forced to retire.
USC won that doubles match to
clinch the victory. Allen will
likely need to undergo surgery.
Stanford Head Coach Frank
Brennan shared the sentiments
of most fans at the new Olympic
facility here, saying. "I'm quite
disappointed. 1 would have
liked to have played Trinity,
would have liked to have played
the team seeded number one.
Then again I'm not sure that Al
len would have beaten Henry in
both of those matches even if
she had been healthy — SC may
have won it without Allen being
hurt."
The Cardinal had it a little
easier — about the only diffi
culty the netters faced was
having to go to the doubles
matches to secure the victory
when San Diego State won both
first and second singles.
The Card's four singles vic
tories were all in straight sets.
Leigh Anne Eldredge started it
off with an easy 6-2. 6-2 victory
over Anne Moeller at number
four. Michelle Weiss then
roared back from a 3-0 deficit in
the second set to defeat Carol
Neeld. 6-2, 6-3, at No. 6, and
Elise Buryin disposed ot Dana
Bleicher, <">-4. 6-2, at No. 5.
Kate Gompert had a slightly
tighter match at No. 3. Gompert
handily won her first set over
Linda Howell, 6-3. but Howell
came back to tie the second at
5-5. Gompert proceeded to take
the next two games, though, to
close out the 6-3, 7-5 win.
Linda Gates had her troubles
at No. 2. where she fell to Cath

crine Berry, 6-1, 6-4. Gates
won the first game of the match
but from there on was blanked
in the first set. She trailed 5-2 in
the second match, and was
facing match point when Berry
called a shot out. Gates success
fully appealed the call to the
umpire and proceeded to win
the next two games, but Berry
then handed Gates her second
straight loss.
With the Cardinal leading 4-
1. Patty Fendick had a chance to
clinch the match for Stanford in
the singles. Fendick took her
first set from Cynthia
McGregor. 6-4, but McGregor
won the second 6-2. In the
third, Fendick opened up a 5-2
lead, and held two match points
at 3-2, but McGregor held them
both off. McGregor pulled
ahead to take a 6-5 lead, but
Fendick broke her serve to tie it
at 6-6 and force a tie-breaker.
McGregor came out strong
and opened up at 4-0 lead, but
Fendick rebounded to cut it to
5-4. McGregor, however, won
the next two points to take the
tie-breaker 7-4 and the match
4-6, 6-2, 7-6.
Going into the doubles, all
the netters needed was one vic
tory. They got three. All three
pairs won their first sets handily,
but all three had close second
sets.
Brennan had no complaints
about the two singles losses. "1
think it worked out perfectly."
he said. "Wc haven't played any
pressure doubles this week, now
I think we won every way we
can."
Though the No. 1-seed is out
of the tournament. USC is no
pushover. Though USC is
seeded No. 5, Brennan said ear
lier that he thinks "they're the
third best team in the country."
The Trojans certainly proved
him right yesterday. 1 hough the
Cardinal beat them 7-2 when
the teams met April 14 at Stan
ford. the first meeting between
the two teams was much closer.
In the April 7 matchup the
Card needed a doubles victory
from Gompert and Weiss to
clinch a 5-4 win.
Brennan said today's match
won't be easy. "It was 5-4 down
here." he said, "and they're get
ting better and better." With a
national championship on the
line, the incentive will certainly
be there.

The Cardinal has been passing its opponents like they were
standing still on its way to the NCAA final today in Los An
geles.

The Stanford men have had to stretch for every victory, squeaking by the opposition with 5-4
scores in each match. They'll have to push even harder to win in today's final against UCLA.
