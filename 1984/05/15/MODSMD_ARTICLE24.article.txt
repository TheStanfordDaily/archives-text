# Men get by Dogs; Bruins next

### TOM CLIFFORD 
The members of the Stanford men's tennis team
went to the NCAA Championship Tournament in
Athens, Ga., to prove that their No. 3 ranking was
wrong, and they are in the process of doing just
that.
By knocking off No. 10-ranked Georgia in the
semifinals yesterday 5-4, the Cardinal advances
into the finals and insures itself of at least a
second-place finish. The UCLA Bruins, who
defeated No. 4-ranked Pepperdine in the other
semifinal match, will be the Cardinal opponent to
morrow for the team title.
Neither of these teams are new to the NCAA
finals. Since 1977, when the team-tournament
concept began, every title has been won by either
Stanford or UCLA. Recently, Stanford has had
tremendous success by winning five titles,
compared to two for UCLA. The Bruins,
however, have the highest number of team titles
overall with 14. Stanford has seven to its credit.
Georgia fought its way to the semifinal by
defeating Arkansas and then, in a surprise upset,
the Bulldogs knocked off the No. 1 team in the
country, USC, 5-4.
The Cardinal also had to fight its way into the
finals. Stanford beat Wichita State, Southern
Methodist University and Georgia all by 5-4 mar
gins.
"We've really had to work hard in this tourna
ment," Head Coach Dick Gould said yesterday
after the match. "We had a tough draw, and as a
result, we've had to earn every match. Sometimes
you get an easier first round, but this time we had
a dog fight in every match. We've been gutting
them all out"
As has been typical of the Cardinal's play in the
tournament, Stanford dropped the first two
matches and fell behind 0-2. But Stanford's John
Letts defeated Jeff Wallace 6-3, 6-4, and Jim
Grabb tied the score at 2-2 by beating Allen Mil
ler in three sets, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. After Derrick Ros
tagno lost to Philip Johnson, 6-4, 0-6. 6-3, Stan

ford's team captain Mark McKeen battled George
Bezechy in a very tight match. After splitting tie
breaker sets, McKeen got a break to stand up as
he won the final set, 6-3.
While the doubles play was a big question
before the Cardinal entered the tounament, the
squad has certainly satisfied the skeptics. In each
round, the Cardinal found itself with a 3-3 tie
after the singles play, and needed to win two of
the three doubles matches to advance. McKeen
and Rostagno led things off with a quick victory
against Johnson and Bezechy 6-3, 6-3.
Then Grabb and Letts took on the role of giant
killers as they proceeded to defeat Miller and
Mike Pernfosh 6-4, 6-4. The Georgia pair was
ranked No. 3 in the country and had just defeated
the No. 1 team in the nation from USC the day
before. Grabb and Letts' win wrapped up the
team victory and gave the Cardinal a 5-3 advan
tage. Stanford defaulted at No. 2 doubles in order
to rest Dan Goldie and Eric Rosenfeld for tomor
row's final.
"Tomorrow's the ultimate for us," Gould said.
"It's all coming down to this one match." The
Bruins will be a difficult team to beat, and the
Cardinal knows it. The two teams have played
three times this season already, with the Bruins
winning two of them. In the match Stanford won,
UCLA was playing without its No. 1 and No. 2
players.
"Because of that fact, you really can't count our
win against the Bruins," Gould warned. "Our
doubles teams are going to have to come through
again. We've beaten their top two teams during
the season and come very close to beating their
No. 3 team, but they've beaten us too.
"At this point, UCLA would have to be the
clear and solid favorite. But I think if all our
singles can come together, we're going to be very
tough. 1 still don't think we've hit our peak yet, so
it should be an outstanding match. Regardless of
what happens, I'm very proud of what this team
has done and how they've represented Stanford."
