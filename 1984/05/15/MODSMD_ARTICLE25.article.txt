# Late season drive gets Golfers NCAA berth
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
It's official: 112 or the first time since 197N, the Stan
lord men's golf team has been selected to play in the
NCAA Championships.
The NCAA selection committee yesterday issued six
bids to the Far West region, inviting USC, UCLA,
Arizona State, San Jose State. Stanford and Fresno
State to compete with the rest of the nation's best on
the Bear Creek Course in Houston from May 23-26.
Though the invitation had been expected since the
Cardinal's second-place finish in the Pacific-10 Cham
pionships last week, the team was understandably ebul
lient yesterday, celebrating on the Stanford course into
the night.
The invitation made it a clean sweep for the Stanford
golf program, as the Cardinal women learned last week
that they will be traveling to Innisbrook, I la. for the
NCAA Women's Championships at the same time.

The women, however, are ranked among the top 10
teams in the nation and were confident enough at the
beginning of the year to list the NCAA tournament as
part of their regular schedule — the men have had a
much harder road to travel.
There was a time earlier this year, Coach Tim Schaaf
admitted, when the NCAA bid was not so probable.
After having played steadily through the fall and win
ter. his Cardinal men fell on hard times in April and
early May, finishing poorly in three consecutive tourna
ments.
Schaaf took some of the blame for this slump. "I
think we were a little over-golfed at that point," he
said. ' If I had to do it again, I wouldn't schedule so
many spring tournaments."
Coming into the Western Intercollegiate three weeks
ago, Stanford was in a dead heat with Fresno State,
Arizona and University of the Pacific for the final two

NCAA berths. But with the pressure on, the Cardinal
fired a spectacular three-over-par 363 on the final day
of the tournament to vault from 1 2th place to fifth and
defeat all three of its major competitors.
"That was the turning point," Schaaf said. "That
final round cleared our heads, and more importantly, it
made our guys believe in their abilities again."
Indeed, Stanford went on to finish respectably in the
Sun Devil Invitational and to surge to a second-place
finish in the Pac-10 Tournament, effectively erasing
any doubt of its selection.
Stanford's first goal in the NCAA tournament is to
make the cut on the third day, when the field is
trimmed from around 30 teams to 15. Beyond that,
Schaaf was as confident as his noisily celebrating
players when asked to assess the Cardinal's chances of
finishing well in Houston. "We're going to be heard
from,"he said.
