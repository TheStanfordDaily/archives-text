## Riveting drama makes ACT's' The Dolly' a must-see 
### MARC FAJER 
The American Conser
vatory Theater in San Fran
cisco opened its final produc
tion of the season last week
with a powerful and gripping
new play, "The Dolly," hv
Robert Locke. The show is
about a family torn apart by
revelations of incest, and
it manages to rise above the
usual movie-of-the-week
quality of issue-oriented
drama with believable char
acters, realistic dialogue and
riveting acting. It has been a
very long time since I have
attended a performance at
which the audience was so
attuned to every word, every
movement and every pause.
"The Dolly" is easily the best
show I've seen this year.
First and foremost, praise
must be given to Barbara

Dirickson for a heart
rending performance that is
captivating from beginning
to end. She portrays a wo
man whose own memories of
a horrifying sexual relation
ship with her father are
rekindled by the discovery of
her father-in-law's advances
on her daughter. There were
many real and tender mo
ments brought forth by her
characterization that are es
pecially memorable. A
refusal to accept compli
ments from an old friend: a
display of lack of self-image
that was just right. Sitting
playing cards by herself at
the table as her insensitive
husband and his father horse
around on stage. Near total
absorption in brushing her
daughter's hair while prepar
ing for bed, almost oblivious

to the child's attempts to tell
the "secret" she had with her
grandfather. Sitting on the
bed singing "Silent Night" to
the child just before the sit
uation dawns on her. And
many others. The character
Dirickson created is
memorable for her strength
and vulnerability; it is rare
that both fight and anguish
are portrayed together so
realistically.
Bruce Williams as her hus
band is almost as good. He
very convincingly plays a
man who is unable to cope
with what is going on around
him. He does not want to
believe that his father is ca
pable of the things his
daughter is saying. He
doesn't know what to do
about his wife's revelations
about her past. The scene in

which he makes her recount
in detail the horror of her ex
perience is frightening: the
brutal taseination ot getting
the absolute worst ot the
truth is \ i\ icilv real here. Wil
liams lits ot emotion — both
temper and crying — are also
superbl\ done. Alter vvateli
mg the cast dI
'Ouartermaine's Terms" tail
at crying so main times last
month, viewing this cast
seems a special privilege.
Hilary Ginberg Walker is
quite good as the young girl.
I here are very tew children
who can remain believable
tor any length ot time on
stage, and she does very well.
Kay Reinhardt gives a very
strong performance as the
grandfather whose acts in
itiate the crisis. He too has
created a rich character, and
the play is the more disturb
ing because he is such a
tunny, likable person who
clearly cares about his
granddaughter.
DeAnn Mears plays the
grandmother. Inez, who has
kicked the old man out.
Aside trom some trouble
with her accent, she also
gives a tine performance. In
her first appearance on stage

she (.locs a \ orv funny series
of hits about her work as a
hairdresser. When Diriekson
then suggests she take back
her husband, she gives a
marvelous speech on the lil'e
she has led on his account,
and her resolve to remain
alone. In the final act. her
defense ol her husband,
despite her earlier oaths, is
true to life and powerful.
John Mcrt/ler rounds out
the cast as the old friend of
the mother's, a doctor, whom
she turns to for help in the
crisis. He starts out a little
weak (which is especially
noticeable in this c;ist) but
gets stronger as the play goes
on. and rises to the general
level of excellence by the
tinal act. He lias some verv
nice sensitive scenes with
Diriekson. and his
problematic relationship
with Williams is well
portrayed by both of them.
Robert Locke has written
a superb play. It is compel

ling. meaningful drama with
out ever being preachy or
trite. The characters are
novel, interesting and very
real. He manages to mention
that there is an incest prob
lem in one of every four
American families without
that becoming the major
point of the play. In the end.
it is the effect 011 the charac
ters and not the issue itself
that holds the audience.
Equal credit should go to
director I aw re nee Hecht.
The pacing of the play was
terrific, as were the silences.
Pausing for long periods of
time 011 stage is hard to do
well, vet there were a num
ber of times in this produc
tion where the audience s;it
riveted through a long
silence, the staging of fight
scenes that looked real was
also \ erv impressive.
In all. as I'm sure is evi
dent from my raving. 1 think
"The Dolly" is a must see. It
plavs at the Geary Theater 111
San Francisco through June 2
and is worth going well out
of your way for. Since I've
started reviewing, ACT has
not had another production
that got an opening night
ovation (much less deserved
one). The audience stood for
this play, and rightly so.

Hilary Ginberg Walker is
quite good as the young girl.
I here are very tew children
who can remain believable
tor any length ot time on
stage, and she does very well.
Kay Reinhardt gives a very
strong performance as the
grandfather whose acts in
itiate the crisis. He too has
created a rich character, and
the play is the more disturb
ing because he is such a
tunny, likable person who
clearly cares about his
granddaughter.
DeAnn Mears plays the
grandmother. Inez, who has
kicked the old man out.
Aside trom some trouble
with her accent, she also
gives a tine performance. In
her first appearance on stage

she (.locs a \ orv funny series

hairdresser. When Diriekson
then suggests she take back
her husband, she gives a
marvelous speech on the lil'e
she has led on his account,
and her resolve to remain
alone. In the final act. her
defense ol her husband,
despite her earlier oaths, is
true to life and powerful.
John Mcrt/ler rounds out
the cast as the old friend of
the mother's, a doctor, whom
she turns to for help in the
crisis. He starts out a little
weak (which is especially
noticeable in this c;ist) but
gets stronger as the play goes
on. and rises to the general
level of excellence by the
tinal act. He lias some verv
nice sensitive scenes with
Diriekson. and his
problematic relationship
with Williams is well
portrayed by both of them.
Robert Locke has written
a superb play. It is compel

ling. meaningful drama with
out ever being preachy or
trite. The characters are
novel, interesting and very
real. He manages to mention
that there is an incest prob
lem in one of every four
American families without
that becoming the major
point of the play. In the end.
it is the effect 011 the charac

that holds the audience.
Equal credit should go to
director I aw re nee Hecht.
The pacing of the play was
terrific, as were the silences.
Pausing for long periods of
time 011 stage is hard to do
well, vet there were a num

riveted through a long
silence, the staging of fight
scenes that looked real was
also \ erv impressive.
In all. as I'm sure is evi
dent from my raving. 1 think
"The Dolly" is a must see. It
plavs at the Geary Theater 111
San Francisco through June 2
and is worth going well out
of your way for. Since I've
started reviewing, ACT has
not had another production
that got an opening night
ovation (much less deserved
one). The audience stood for
this play, and rightly so.

The American Conser
vatory Theater in San Fran
cisco opened its final produc
tion of the season last week
with a powerful and gripping
new play, "The Dolly," hv
Robert Locke. The show is
about a family torn apart by
revelations of incest, and
it manages to rise above the
usual movie-of-the-week
quality of issue-oriented
drama with believable char
acters, realistic dialogue and
riveting acting. It has been a
very long time since I have
attended a performance at
which the audience was so
attuned to every word, every
movement and every pause.
"The Dolly" is easily the best
show I've seen this year.
First and foremost, praise
must be given to Barbara

Dirickson for a heart
rending performance that is
captivating from beginning
to end. She portrays a wo
man whose own memories of
a horrifying sexual relation
ship with her father are
rekindled by the discovery of
her father-in-law's advances
on her daughter. There were
many real and tender mo
ments brought forth by her
characterization that are es
pecially memorable. A
refusal to accept compli
ments from an old friend: a
display of lack of self-image
that was just right. Sitting
playing cards by herself at
the table as her insensitive
husband and his father horse
around on stage. Near total
absorption in brushing her
daughter's hair while prepar
ing for bed, almost oblivious

to the child's attempts to tell
the "secret" she had with her
grandfather. Sitting on the
bed singing "Silent Night" to
the child just before the sit
uation dawns on her. And
many others. The character
Dirickson created is
memorable for her strength
and vulnerability; it is rare
that both fight and anguish
are portrayed together so
realistically.
Bruce Williams as her hus
band is almost as good. He
very convincingly plays a
man who is unable to cope
with what is going on around
him. He does not want to
believe that his father is ca
pable of the things his
daughter is saying. He
doesn't know what to do
about his wife's revelations
about her past. The scene in

which he makes her recount
in detail the horror of her ex
perience is frightening: the
brutal taseination ot getting
the absolute worst ot the
truth is \ i\ icilv real here. Wil
liams lits ot emotion — both
temper and crying — are also
superbl\ done. Alter vvateli
