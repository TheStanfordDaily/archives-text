# 'Sold Out' presents issues, but doesn't sell out

### JENNIFER ROSEN 
Videos, live performers,
colored lights and music
merged in a virtual assault to the
senses at Palo Alto's Bijou
Theatre this weekend.
SOLD OUT. a multi-media
event produced by Stanford
senior Robert Greenberg, at
tempted to depict the nature of
advertising and its role in Amer
ican consumer culture.
Using a variety of theatrical

deviccs, including live and re
corded videos, slides, real and
animated film, computerized
sounds, actors and dancers,
SOLD OUT successfully
ridiculed fragmented aspects of
"Americana" hut failed to co
here as an artistic whole.
The show included several
sketches — among them an
amusing scene in a Denny's cof
fee shop, a Michael Jackson fash
ion show set to the tune of
'•Thriller," a mock Talking
Heads performance and a fake
ongoing news broadcast.
Among the show's high points
was its eclectic, polished collec
tion of videos, ranging from
children's reactions to popular
advertisements to an event
Greenberg staged in White
Plaza allowing students to build
their own cardboard nuclear
warheads.
The show also included
videotaped interviews of Stan
lord students discussing their
views of American advertising
and tapes of actual advertise
ments for cameras, nasal spray
and laundry detergent.
Stanford senior Dave Pagel's
innovative set engulfed the
entire theater, integrating the

audience as an active, rather
than passive, sector of the per
formance.
Pagel's set included 15,000
teet of fabric, a chain link fence,
reproductions of popular ad
vertisements, the top of a school
bus and a transparent dangling
man constructed of wire and
plastic.
Although all of these individ
ual components stood on their
own merits, the show lacked a
necessary unity.

At times the audience was
bombarded by an uncomfort
able mass of disconnected
images. And the nuclear issue,
albeit important, seemed some
how out of synch with SOLD
OUTs overall theme of adver
tising.
The first half of the show was
better than the second, which
lapsed into a repetitive and
somewhat preachy statement of
the show's purpose.
However, according to
Greenberg, SOLD OUT is a
show where the medium is the
message. He wanted to create

an "advertising nightmare," and
he did. By overselling SOLD
OUT, Greenberg manipulated
the very aspects of advertising
he so despises to convey his
message.
"SOLD OUT is an attack on
the senses in the same way that
advertising is a pre-planned at
tempt to get to the most im
pulsive, the most vulnerable
core of the human spirit,"
Greenberg wrote in a press
release that he handed out to

Thursday night shows were can
celled due to a shortage of
power.
The show was not a booming
financial success. "Greenberg
bit off a whole lot more than he
could chew," said Bob Stern,
co-owner of the Bijou Theatre.
"They were in over their heads,
and they knew it. It was too am
bitious of a project."
According to Stern, the
theater suffered some minor
damage and lost a substantial
amount of money.
"It would have been better if
it had happened on campus. We
welcome student groups, but we
will understandably be a little
more cautious the next time stu
dents approach us," he said.
According to Greenberg, the
production is a benefit for the
California Council For the
Blind, and all profits will be
donated to charity.
He said he did not produce
the show for money-making

purposes and that he felt ii
succeeded artistically.
Produced by Stanford senior
Hob Levy, and co-produced b\
the Stanford Instructional Tele
vision Network and the Center
for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics, the esti
mated market value of the show
is $30,000, Greenberg said.
Greenberg offered his pro
duction as a challenge to exist
ing forms of drama on campus.
He said the Drama Department.
Ram's Head and other indepen
dent shows here, such as dorm
productions, are limited in their
creative scope.
"I wanted to create a produc
tion that realizes the weaknesses
of these productions and capi
talizes on the strength of the
community. I wanted my show
to be something that's very dif
ferent from what 90 percent of
the audience has ever seen," he
said.
And it was.





the media. "Advertisers are
men who prey upon the subcon
scious minds of other men.
SOLD OUT will hopefully he a
performance piece where artists
take similar liberties."

And indeed they did — not
only in the performance but in a
vigorous ad campaign preced
ing the show.
In what Greenberg describes
as "a lot of hype," publicity for
the show included the distribu
tion ot SOLD OUT posters,
matchbooks and handouts. He
also covered the Ouad with
SOLD OUT slogans in chalk
late one night.
Although 10 shows were
originally scheduled, two
