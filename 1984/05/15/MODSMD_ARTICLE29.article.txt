The grass is always
A lot of people called The Daily
offices yesterday and pointed out that
the paper wasn't white. Here's what
happened:
In this year's episode of an annual
ritual, first-year "green" staffers put
veterans and Iroy Eid to shame by
putting out one of the best issues of
the week.
Acting chief Richard Lynch, making
overtures of cleverness, tried to foil
the old crowd by ordering a 10-page
paper from the printer instead of the
pre-designated 12-page model. Whe
ther he elected to do this out of
prudence or simply to conserve

calorics proved irrelevant in the final
analysis. Adam and crew had already
confirmed the 12-page model, and
Richard's "pretender to the throne"
status was appropriately jeopardized
via green paper.
Editors, frying
Candidates lor Volume IS6 will
field questions at today's staff lynch,
starting at noon. The Daily office.
And please vote tomorrow. The polls
close at 10 p.m.
The heat gets hotter
Potential editors for Volume INSA,
The Daily's summer edition, must
contact Adam immediately to secure
positions.
