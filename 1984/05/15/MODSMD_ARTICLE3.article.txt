# Village rent hike protested
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Daily staff 
At least 200 residents of Escondido Village gathered
yesterday afternoon in White Plaza to protest the Uni
versity's decision to raise rents by 10.85 percent next
year in the graduate student housing project.
Approximately 60 students, along with their spouses
and children, marched from the Village to White Plaza,
chanting, "Don't force us out, no rent hike." Many in
the throng bore homemade signs protesting the rent in
creases, which members of the Escondido Rent Fair
ness Coalition say are unnecessary.
The residents object to the $1.6 million surplus from
the Village that goes back to the University, and is par
tially used to fund Governor's Corner housing for un
dergraduates.
Pam Lagarde, one of four Village residents who
made a brief speech at the rally, expressed dissatisfac
tion with the University for not providing child care for
residents with children. "What are we going to do with
our children?" she asked the crowd.
She further protested that the University knows "we
can't go anywhere else" with the high cost of living off
campus in Palo Alto.
Tom Lutz, an Escondido resident, made the closing
remarks at the rally, promising that residents will

launch a "full-fledged rent strike in the fall" if the Uni
versity refuses to acknowledge and take action on resi
dents' complaints.
Immediately following the rally, protesters marched
to the office of Karlene Dickey, associate dean for the
Graduate Division, chanting "No Kennedy, we won't
go"
John McManus, a member of the rent fairness coali
tion, said he considered the rally a success. He esti
mated that 200-300 people were present at the
demonstration, a number that would likely have been
higher had not some people been working or taking
care of their children.
McManus said residents are still planning to withhold
rent for the month of June, in hopes that a rent strike in
the fall can be avoided.
Residents say they prefer an alternative to the Uni
versity's "grandfather" rent structure. Under the
grandfather system, all present residents would pay a
10.85 percent rent increase next year regardless of the
size of the apartment. Escondido residents propose in
stead that new rent increases be "based on the average
on the Consumer Price Index and the average of the
University stipends." Residents are also requesting that
leases "for the duration of study" have a "stated rent
increase ceiling."
