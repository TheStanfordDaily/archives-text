# Response to dues cutoff
## Union levels criminal charge 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
United Stanford Workers (USW)
charged Stanford with criminal mis
conduct Friday in response to the Uni
versity's May 8 decision to cease
deducting union dues from employee
paychecks.
Union officials say Stanford's
refusal to collect and turn over dues
constitutes an illegal attempt to
destroy the bargaining unit by cutting
off its source of funds.
"We have notified Stanford that its
conduct amounts to a criminal breach
of state law," said USW Counsel Jim
Eggleston. "Their conduct is so
flagrant and abusive (that) we are left
with no choice. We have sent several
letters to (University President)
Donald Kennedy asking that issues be
resolved through the orderly negotia
tion and arbitration procedures. Stan
ford has chosen not to respond."
Priscilla Wheeler, University staff
counsel, said Local 715 has
abandoned the Stanford workers and
the University's contractual obligation
to USW is now void because "Local
715 was the party to the contract."
Wheeler reiterated the University's
position that the bargaining unit cur
rently has no union representation.
Eggleston filed a complaint with the
State Labor Commission office in San
Jose charging Stanford with violating
section 227 of the California Labor
Code.
Section 227 states it is unlawful for
an employer to withhold funds from
employees' health and welfare benefit
programs and carries a maximum
punishment for of five years imprison
ment and a $1000 fine.
Wheeler denied USW's charge,
saying the University continues to
contribute funds to employee pension,

medical and vacation benefit funds.
Eggleston said union funds qualify
as a "plan for the benefit of the
employees. A union falls in that cate
gory."
Wheeler disagreed that a union
could be considered an employee
benefit, calling Eggleston's claim "a
very interesting interpretation" of the
Labor Code.
Eggleston said the union charge is
firmly grounded and was in fact rec
ommended by an official in the Labor
Commission. "We have been advised
by the labor commissioner's office that
the union constitutes a plan for the
employees," he said.
According to Eggleston. the com
plaint could be brought before a
hearing in as soon as five or six weeks.
At that time, both the University and
the union will have an opportunity to
present their cases. If, as a result of the
hearing, the commission finds sub
stance in USW's complaint, it will ask
the district attorney's office to prose
cute Stanford.
USW President l.inda Crouse called
the University's cutoff of union dues a
declaration of "war on its employees."
She said Stanford "now hopes that it
can starve the union out of existence
by depriving it of the dues money
which it has collected."
"Stanford is illegally holding
workers' monies and will be held
liable for this misconduct. Even Stan
ford is not above the law," she said.
Eggleston said be believes the union
will survive in the interim in any of a
variety of ways, including a legal in
junction against the University and
direct collection of dues from union
members.
"Stanford's attempt to cripple the
union by cutting oft' its dues won't
work." he sa'ui.
