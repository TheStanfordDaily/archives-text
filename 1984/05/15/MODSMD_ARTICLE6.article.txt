Round One results of the student housing Draw
a ill be announced at 10 a.m. today in the Housing
Center and will he posted shortly thereafter in in
dividual residences throughout campus, according
to Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of Student Af
fairs and director of the Housing Center.
A total of 4272 students entered the Draw this
year. 23N4 men and IN«S<S women. Whitney said
there were fewer Draw participants than the 4340
last year because graduating seniors were not
allowed to draw.
"It was a smooth process, an excellent Draw."
ho said. "With the new housing, we were able to
have a larger assignable group after Round One
than ever before."
After Round One. N2h men and 3~s women
were not assigned, compared with the 1, 3b men
and 4M.S women not assigned in 19N2. before the

new Governor's Corner residences were available.
The cutoff for women was 1942 in the un
guaranteed pool, meaning that all female students
in the Draw with a guaranteed year plus all women
with an unguaranteed year who drew better than
that cutoff received a Round One housing assign
ment.
But the men's assignable pool did not include
any students with an unguaranteed year. The
cutoff for men was 4N50 in the guaranteed group.
h() guaranteed males who drew worse than that
number did not receive Round One housing as
signments.
Although the women's cutoff line does not
change significantly after the second round of the
Draw, hundreds of spaces invariably open up for
men. largely because of fraternity pledges who do
not accept their assignments. Whitney said. Thus, a
number of unguaranteed males will be entered into
the assignable pool in Round Two.

As expected. Storey House, 558 Mayfield, Yost
and Murray Houses. Lambda Nu, the Sterling
Quad houses and the Suites were among the most
popular residences.
Storey House had the lowest cutoff numbers,
273 for men and 234 for women, those numbers
including only students with at least an S2 priority.
Cutoffs for 558 Mayfield were 440 for men and
554 lor women; and for Yost House. 449 for men
and 635 for women. "There were no dramatic
shifts in popularity, but Manzanita became more
popular," Whitney said.
Students wishing either to drop out of the Draw
or to accept their Round One assignment must fill
out and return their Draw Card Two by 4 p.m.
Friday to their residence office or the Housing
Center. It Draw participants wish to remain in the
Draw for Round Two. the\ need not return their
card at all.
Round Two results will be an
nounced around May 25. Whitney
said. Students who have not been as
signed to a residence by the end of
Round Two, and students still dis
satisfied with their assignments at that
time, may place their names on the
waiting list for housing. If they do so
before June 8, their original Draw
number will determine the order in

which they arc considered for place
ment as vacancies occur.
Whitney said students could obtain
priorities until June S at houses on
their Draw Card lists.
Certain priority houses still have
unfilled spaces — 62 spaces in total —
which can be filled in Round Two by
students with the proper priorities,
Whitney said.
Residences with spaces remaining
for men include Synergy, Terra,
Columbae, La Maison Francaise, La
Casa Italiana and Theta Chi; and for
women, Synergy, Terra, Haus Mit
tleuropa and Phi Sig.
