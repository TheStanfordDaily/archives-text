national Olympic Committee. Soviet Sports Minister Marat
Gramov said yesterday.

but this would not mean a change in the decision. The Soviet
decision to boycott the Games was an "internal matter" of

States was \iolating the Olympic Charter and that Soviet ath
letes' security would have been in danger at the Los Angeles
Games.

even though the Soviet charges of U.S. violations ot the
Olympic Charter. Gramov said, had been found valid by the
IOC.
Gramov, who is also president of the Soviet National
Olvmpic Committee, said that the Sovjet decision, taken on
May N. was not a boycott move.
"We can't urge anyone else to cancel." he said.

Cabinet says fighting must end
Beirut, Lebanon — Lebanese Christian and Moslem
Cabinet ministers have agreed that the shelling of both sides
of Beirut must stop, a Cabinet committee announced yester
day, but the agreement came too late to save the life of a 12-
year-old boy killed by a shell in the playground of his school.
The agreement, which expresses the ministers' hopes but
which may actually do nothing to stop the fighting, is included
in a set of policy guidelines for the new government of
Premier Rashid Karami.
The boy was killed and the other students were wounded
when the shell hit the school playground in Christian East
Beirut. It was the worst incident of the day as Beirut experi
enced another day of random shelling and fighting along the
Green Line, the divider between East Beirut and the mostly
Moslem western sector.
As soon as news of the shelling of the Sayidat al Bishara
School spread, all educational institutions on both sides of the
city were closed for fear that they would become targets. Par
ents rushed to the schools to pick up their children.
Court upholds Moon verdict
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday refused to
review the tax-fraud conviction of the Rev. Sun Myung
Moon, the Unification Church leader who faces 18 months'
imprisonment beginning June 18 and a $25,000 fine.
The court, without dissent, rejected Moon's appeal despite
an extraordinary, high-powered campaign to convince the
justices that it raised fundamental questions of religious
freedom.
Dozens of civil-liberties, civil-rights and religious organiza
tions, as well as numerous newspaper editorialists, had urged
the court to review the conviction.
Dr. Mose Durst, president of the Unification Church in the
United States, said that vesterday was a "day of shame" for
America — the first time a worldwide religious figure has
faced prison in the United States.
"We believe he (Moon) is the central figure through whom
God will work in this age." Durst said in a telephone inter
view.
"For a nation to abuse this man, God forbid what's going to
happen to this country. As I read the Bible, any time a people
abuses its priests or religious leaders, there is a tragedy that
follows," Durst said.
Stocks fall in slow trading
New. York — Stock prices slid yesterday in the slowest
trading in two months amid investor concern that interest
rates are headed higher.
Analysts said an "abysmal" performance in the bond mar
ket. where yields arc at their highest levels in two years, left
stocks at a competitive disadvantage. A pair of government
economic reports did little to ease investor fears about which
way rates are moving.
Among the losers were automotive, telephone and energy
stocks. There were a few gainers among the blue-chips and
the drug stocks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 10.05
points on Friday despite a late rally, lost another 6.07 points
to close at 1151.07.
