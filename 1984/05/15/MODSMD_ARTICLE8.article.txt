### 
Washington (AP) — President Reagan stronglv
denied yesterday that the United States had done any
thing to drive the Soviet I nion away from the Olym
pics and complained that the United States, not Mos
cow. is always accused ot "doing something that misiht
cause the threat ot war."
•What have we done to the Soviets that can compare
with any ot the things that they are presently doing, ex
cept tell them that we're not going to let them get so
powerful that they can impose nuclear blackmail on
us?" Reagan asked rhetorically.
At a hastily arranged news conference in the White
House press room, the president criticized the Soviet
Union for pulling out ot the Olympics, tor walking out
of U.S.-Soviet arms control talks, for having an expan
sionist policy, for invading Afghanistan, tor building up
its strategic forces and for shooting down a Korean air
liner carrying 269 people last tall.
And he made it clear he would not try to entice the
Soviets to overturn their decision to boycott the Olym
pic games in I.os Angeles this summer, saying it was not
a problem for government.
Asked whether U.S.-Soviet relations were at a Cold
War stage, and whether Reagan's anti-Soviet rhetoric

had contributed to the situation, he replied:
"Sometimes I wonder why we don't ask those questions
of them."
I he president denounced the Soviet boycott of the
Olympics, saying the reason given — not enough as
surance ot safety for Soviet athletes — was "absolutely
false and we \e been able to prove it."
But he said he would not personally intervene in an
effort to get the Soviets to change their minds. "I don't
think there s any action that I could take that would be
prudent, he said. "Naturally. 1 would do anything if 1
thought it could have a result, and I have encouraged
citizens groups and our people to do this. It is not a
government relations problem."
Maintaining the United States was flexible when it
came to arms control. Reagan complained that despite
U.S. initiatives, the Soviets walked out of the
intermediate-range nuclear force talks and have not yet
agreed to resume strategic arms reduction talks.
We regret this Soviet action and we remain
prepared to resume negotiations immediately, without
preconditions, the president said as he pressed
Congress to approve funding for the MX missile.
"We must not cast doubt on U.S. and allied resolve

nor reward the Soviets tor their current belligerent be
ha\ ior toward arms control.
A motion is expected in the House within the next
few da\s to delete $2.5 billion tor the land-based inter
continental missile from a measure authoii/ing $_0N
billion of militar> spending in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. I.
• Without. . . the MX. the incentive for the Soviets to
return to the negotiating table is greatly reduced."
Reagan said. "The So\iets hope that once again our
modernization efforts will be curtailed. To falter now
would only encourage the Soviet Union to ignore our
arms control ettorts."
Reagan offered no theories for the Soviet boycott of
the Olympics. Asked if he thought the Soviets were
trying to embarrass him in this election year, the presi
dent replied: "1 don't know. You'd have to ask them
about that." He said if that was the Soviet plan, it might
backfire.
But Reagan flatly rejected the Soviets' charges of
Olympic security shortcomings. "No one in the history
of the Olympics has ever done as much as we're doing
to ensure that." lie said.
