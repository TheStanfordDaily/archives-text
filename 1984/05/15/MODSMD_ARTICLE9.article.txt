# Judge orders new probe of debate case

From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — A federal judge yester
day ordered Attorney General William
French Smith to seek appointment ot an
independent counsel to investigate whe
ther high Reagan administration officials
committed crimes in obtaining former
President Carter's debate briefing papers
and other documents during the 1980
presidential campaign.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene resurrected the debate
papers controversy three months after
the Department of Justice closed its in
quiry into the case. It could result in
deeper investigations into the 1980 cam
paign activities of several administration
officials, including White House coun
selor Edwin Meese, White House C hiet
of Staff James Baker and CIA Director
William Casey.
Meese. Baker and Casey figure heavily
in the case because their sworn state
ments about their knowledge of the pil
fered Carter materials conflict with each
other or with documentary evidence ob
tained by the FBI and congressional in
vestigators.
An independent counsel likely would
investigate whether perjury, among
other offenses, was committed. Greene's
order requires Smith within seven days

to ask a panel of appellate judges to
select such a counsel.
At the Department of Justice, a
spokesman said the order would be ap
pealed. There was no immediate com
ment from the White House on the
ruling, issued in a public-interest lawsuit
filed by John Banzhaf, a George Wash
ington University law professor.
When the Department of Justice
closed its inquiry in February, it an
nounced that an eight-month FBI inves
tigation had found "no credible
evidence" that any federal crime had
been committed in the receipt of the
Carter debate documents by Reagan
campaign officials.
In its brief report, the department
downplayed inconsistencies and conflicts
in the statements of administration offi
cials interviewed by the FBI, saying,
"Any seeming inconsistencies could be
explained by differences in recollection
or interpretation.'"
However, congressional investigators
this month are scheduled to issue what is
believed to be a much more critical
report in the case. They are expected to
allege that Meese, Casey and other
Reagan campaign officials regularly
received the fruits of extensive campaign
espionage against Carter — contrary to

their sworn statements.
The additional scrutiny of a second in
dependent counsel's investigation could
spell particular trouble for Meese, whose
nomination as attorney general is on
hold in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Washington attorney Jacob Stein was
appointed last month as independent
counsel to undertake a broad inquiry
into Meese's affairs, including his finan
cial dealings and his transfer and promo
tion in the Army Reserve.
In the debate papers case, Meese. in a
written statement to House investigators
last July, said that "to the best of my
recollection. I have no knowledge of, and
had no participation in, any transactions
involving material produced for Presi
dent Carter or any mechanisms for ob
taining such material." He said further
that he had "no personal knowledge of
the use of any such material by anyone
involved in the campaign."
But a House Post Office and Civil Ser
vice subcommittee gave the Senate
Judiciary Committee a 1980 memo
found in Meese's files from campaign
aide Max Hugel that included a copy of a
confidential Carter campaign document.
Referring to the Carter document,
which outlined part of Carter's strategy
at the Democratic National Convention,

Hugel's memo to Mccsc said: "Bill
Casey (then Reagan's campaign
manager) asked me to have you review
this memo which fell into my hands and
to come lip with some of our own strat
egy on this particular subject that might
counteract this (Carter) effort."
House subcommittee members said
Meese, when confronted with the Hugel
memo, backed away from his previous
general denial and said he probably had
seen it. Casey has repeatedly denied
having had any pilfered Carter material,
saying he wvald not have touched it
"with a 10-foot pole."
Casey's denial not only differs from
documentary evidence compiled by the
subcommittee but also contradicts the
statement of Baker, who was in charge ol
preparing Reagan for his October IWO
debate with Carter. Baker has said he
briefly saw some Carter debate papers
provided by Casey.
In his 36-page opinion, Greene said
Smith's failure to seek an independent
counsel after an FBI inquiry violated the
1978 Ethics in Government Act, which
established guarantees for unbiased in
vestigations into the activities of top
presidential appointees.
