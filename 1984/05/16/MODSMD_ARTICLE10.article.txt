## 
### 
( olorado Sen. Gary Hart overwhelmed
Walter Mondale to win Democratic primaries
in Nebraska and Oregon last night, gaining
western momentum to fuel a late, long-shot
surge lor the party s presidential nomination.
Mondale said he was optimistic that he would
not he overtaken.
Hart's campaign manager said the double
barreled victories provided the senator an
"overwhelmingly successful day . . . exactly
the kind of thing we were looking for"
heading into the final primary showdowns in
C alifornia and four other states on June 5.
I he Rev. Jesse Jackson was a distant third
in the two states with small black populations.

"Now we've won all but one state (primary)
west of the Mississippi," Hart told supporters
in Denver. "And alter June 5 I think I II be
able to say we've still won all but one state
west of the Mississippi."
Mondale, in Beverly Hills, noted that
despite Hart's twin victories, "I have.a very,
very strong lead in the delegate count." In
fact, Hart needs to go a long way to overtake
Mondale in the all-important competition for
delegates to the July 16 Democratic National
Convention.
Mondale ended the d. y with 1601.05
delegates to 976.75 for H. rt and 296.2 for
Jackson. It takes 1967 towii tl e nomination.
I he former vice p eside it predicted that
"by the time of the convention, I think we'll
have enough delegates to si cure my nomina
tion." Just last week, one ol his top aides
predicted Mondale would <lir;h nomination
based on the results of he J in« 5 elections.
Yesterday, 67 delegates w;n at stake. Hart
led lor a total 42 — 27 from Oregon and 15
from Nebraska. Mondale led for 24 — 16
from Oregon and N from Nebraska. Jackson

had I Nebraska delegate.
Hart's reaction to all this was practically a
carbon copy of his remarks following last
week's victories in Indiana and Ohio — "The
voters of these two st.ites have said they're not
ready for this race t< be over." he told a rally
of supporters in Denver.
With ballots counted from 83 percent of
Nebraska's precincts. Hart was winning 58
percent of the vote, compared with 27 for
Mondale. Jackson had 10 percent.
In Oregon, with results from 25 percent of
the state's 2452 precints. Hart led Mondale,
57 percent to 31 percent. Jackson had S per
cent.
Hart's campaign manager, Oliver Henkel,
said the results "recreated momentum and the
sense of vitality in the campaign."
He said it was a "tremendously broad rejec
tion of his (Mondale's) candidacy by these two
states," adding, despite Mondale's big lead in
delegates, "the viability of his candidacy has
to be seriously questioned."
Demo platform under construction
Los Angeles — The Democratic Party,
which often bills itself as the party of diversity,
came face-to-face Monday with its own condi
tion as women, minorities, gays, entertainers
and a whole eager lineup of others competed
for a voice in the party's 19N4 platform.
The daylong hearing of the party's Platform
Committee, devoted to the social issues of op
portunity and fairness, was the fourth of six
meetings the Democrats are conducting
around the country to hear from grass-roots
activists on the issues that move them, large
and small.
Party leaders then will finish a draft of the
platform next month to be sent on to the
Democratic National Convention in San Fran
cisco.
At the Biltmore Hotel, the committee
heard from black actors wanting Democrats to
stamp out stereotyping and white domination
of television. It listened to Latinos' fears
about pending federal immigration legislation.

Gays sought not only discrimination protec
tion but federal assistance in combating the
killer disease AIDS.
California Attorney General John Van de
Kamp suggested Democrats might want to try
a "new" tack on civil rights, a hard-line attack
on crime. Pro-choice advocates decried the
"terrorism" of those who raid abortion clinics,
but a Latino committee member complained
that the party discriminates aginst Roman
Catholics because of their anti-abortion views.
Squeezing in with 135 other witnesses were
plumbers and pipefitters who wanted to block
utility companies from installing home appli
ances. A spokesman for a group calling itself
Ecological Environments asked for a plank
urging a U.S.-Soviet summit meeting at
Hiroshima to underscore the horror of nuclear

war. And another group from Los Angeles did
not want the problem of controling uranium
tailings at mines to go unnoticed in the
presidential election.
For it all. Democratic Party Chairman
Charles Manatt and Committee Chair Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro(D-N.Y.) promised a plat
form that would avoid the kind of detail that
engorged the party's 19K0 platform to an un
wieldy 34,000 words.
Of politics and war
Jesse Jackson charged yesterday that his
two rivals for the Democratic presidential
nomination have shown themselves "to be
willing to risk World War 111 to win votes."
while Walter Mondale claimed that Gary Hart
and President Reagan would lead the United

States into a war.
Reading from a statement, Jackson said
thiit former Vice President Walter Mondale
and Colorado Sen. Gary Hart did so by calling
for the U.S. Embassy to Israel to move from
Tel Avi\ to Jerusalem.
Contending that Arab nations have warned
that moving the embassy to Jerusalem would
lead to war, Jackson said that Hart and
Mondale debated each other before the New
York primary about who was first to recom
mend the move.
"Risking conventional war can only esc
alate into nuclear war," he said. "They're
moving in that direction. Therefore, calmer
heads must prevail."
"1 predict that if Ronald Reagan is re
elected. lie will present the American people
with a December surprise," Mondale said.
"His policies will continue to fail: and at some
point after the election, American boys could
well be fighting and dying in Central
America."
Speaking to the Northern California World
Affairs Council in San Francisco, Mondale
also compared Hart, his chief rival for the
nomination, to Reagan.
Charging that Hart is "unsteady and incon
sistent," Mondale said. "Today we have a
president who shoots from the hip in foreign
policy. We don't need yet another one in
|yK4."
Jackson was questioned at a press confer
ence — where his supporters hooted at the
questions and cheered his answers — about
whether he really meant the charge. Jackson
did not back down.
Jackson made the comment as he picked up
the endorsement of a San Francisco Bay Area
Jewish group claiming 100 members.
Mondale addressed the council, a group
founded in 1947 to promote foreign policy
debate, on the last full day of a five-day cam
paign swing through California.
