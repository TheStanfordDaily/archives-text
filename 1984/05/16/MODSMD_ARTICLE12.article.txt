## The 						Stanford Daily Stop labor intimidation 
### 
Of all the workers in the Labor and Grounds
Shops, only a dozen or so were willing to speak to
us for an article last month about Stanford's use
of temporary workers. Of these, only Jessie
Solorio was willing to go on the record as criticiz
ing the University's questionable policies regard
ing the use of temporary labor.
On May 4, the University fired Jessie Solorio.
His dismissal surprised no one, least of all
Solorio. When Grounds filled five temporary pos
itions last month, Solorio. who has worked at
Stanford for close to a year without any union
protection or benefits, was denied a spot.
After the five spots were filled, there were still
three Stanford employees, including Solorio. that
had worked as temporaries for periods ranging
from many months to a year. The Labor Shop has
indicated that two more permanent positions will
be created.
Thus the end result will be that all
"permanent" temporaries will have regular posi
tions at Stanford. Except Solorio, who will have no

job at all.
Thus the University has demonstrated its rule
with the iron list. It has proven it can manage its
affairs in a heavy-handed manner and can remove
those employees that dare speak out against it.
Solorio says lie has never be tore been
reprimanded for misconduct. Yet Herb l ong,
manager of Operations and Maintenance, said he
was dismissed for "verbally abusing a super
visor.
Solorio s only crime was his willingness to speak.
Mis comments to The Daily probably played a
part in his co-workers obtaining their permanent
positions.
The University's punishment ot Solorio for
simply exercising his rights as an employee and a
human being is, to put it mildly, inexcusable.
Fong and other University officials should realize
the repressive nature ot this act. I he University
should allow freedom ot expression among its
employees — and hire Solorio back as a perman
ent employee.
