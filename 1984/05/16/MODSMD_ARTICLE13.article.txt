VIEWPOINT

Ujamaa and Casa /.apata now offer a
number of academic courses in addi
tion to a wide range of general educa
tional activities and theme-related
programs. Examples of courses of
fered this year include: "Cultural
Democracy in the Classroom;"
"Capitalism/Socialism: The Differ
ence Class Makes;" "African Science,
Technology and Religion;" "About
Chicanos;" "Small Group Communi
cation;" "Crossing Boundaries: Vi
sions of Public Service;" "Ancient
African History: The Truth
Revealed;" and "Africans in Transi
tion: The Effects of Invasions."
Numerous programs that feature
faculty members and that encourage

discussion of vital theme-related poli
tical and social issues are also offered.
Examples include Prof. Eugene
Feldnian (founder of the DuSable
Museum of African American His
tory) speaking on "Figures in Black
History;" Professors St. Claire Drake
and Teteh Koffi discussing "Africa
and Black America: The Importance
of a Continued Dialogue;" Prof. Ar
turo Islas on the topic "About
Chicanos: Through Words and Lyrics:
Recent Chicano Writings;" Drama
Prof. Helen Schrader leading a
workshop of interracial dating; and
the black women role models series
featuring such speakers as Political
Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
Theatre, art shows, music and other
events that explore ethnic culture are
also offered every quarter. Highlights
include "Facets of Black Music: The
Stanford Gospel Choir;" Juanita Wil
liams for a dinner discussion on
"Black Performing Arts;" a salsa

workshop by a Ballet Folklorico in
structor: a film on black jazz musician
Paul Robeson.
These programs are directed not
only to the students who belong to the
ethnic group which is the focus of the
house, but to all interested students.
The ethnic theme houses are charac
terized by a high level of program
ming. in terms of both the range and
quality of their offerings. The ethnic
theme houses confront head on the
difficult challenge of exploring cul
tural differences, a key Residential
Education goal. Through the pro
grams which explore cultural identity
and examine theme-related issues, the
three houses provide opportunities for
residents and other members of the
Stanford community to better under
stand themselves and others.
