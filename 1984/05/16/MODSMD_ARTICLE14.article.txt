## Fraternities being maligned 
### 
Most people are probably sick and tired of hearing the
pros and cons of fraternities, but considering the urgency
of our present situation and the lack of sufficient argument
in favor of residentially housed fraternities, I feel it my
duty to add my own insight and propose some measures
which could improve the present system.
As a student I have found the fraternity experience »o be
a significant factor in the learning process. An incom-

VIEWPOINT

parable laboratory in human relationships, fraternity
membership covers the whole spectrum of man learning
how to live with his fellow man. It is here that one learns to
appreciate the background, philosophy and lifestyle of
those quite different from his own, to develop consensus
for group decisions and group actions, to accept responsi
bility and exercise leadership, perhaps for the first time.
There is no need to dwell on the obvious characteristics
of fraternity membership, such as providing a social base
(which, sadly, so few Stanford students experience), ser
ving as a home away from home, giv ing one a sense of
belonging and nurturing lasting friendships. At a deeper
level fraternity membership opens up a unique (YES!
Unique!) opportunity for personal growth, face-to-face
exposure to lasting ideals and an awakening awareness of
what it really means to care for the other guy. Any under
graduate who wishes a fraternity experience should be
able to have it.
I fail to see how a university which prides itself on being
the leader in academics can be so far behind other schools
in this area of student life.

I recommend and strongly urge that Stanford not only
continue fraternities but that the trustees make a real and
positive commitment to their greater effectiveness.
1 propose the establishment of a fraternity office, ap
pointment of a qualified professional to direct the office
(the Row Office presently doesn't have the staff to devote
enough time) and serve the dual function of regular con
sultation with the undergraduate officers of each fraternity
and overseeing the management of each. Among the
director's responsibilities would be serving as adviser to
the Inter-Fraternity Council. Since so many students live in
fraternities, the expense of such an office would be well
warranted.
Another possibility is the appointment of a faculty ad
viser to each fraternity. In addition to advising the frater
nities. these advisers could meet periodically to coordinate
their efforts and should serve in a liaison capacity between
the faculty and the fraternity members. An active and on
going monitoring program by a standing committee of the
Board of Trustees also deserves consideration.
I really think that only minimal reforms need to be made
to make our system compatible with the University.
Fraternities mean too much to too many of us to stand by
and watch the assault of frighteningly narrow-minded
viewpoints which have been so eagerly published by biased
media. We are aware and concerned and only a very small
minority has shown any of that -off attitude which
The Daily willingly referred to out of context last week.
