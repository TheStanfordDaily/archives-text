## A 						boarder's view of frat life 
### 
It seems that in all the emotional furor over the frater
nity system of Stanford University lately, there has been a
tad hit of circumstantial opinions and "noise" based on
shoddy, unsubstantiated biases. Many of The Daily's pre
vious letters and editorials on this subject matter, one may
have noted (or not really cared), have been written either
by students who have never lived in a fraternity, or by still
unhumbled freshmen who apparently have little else to do

VIEWPOINT

than try to send loud waves of opinion across the campus
for the sake of loudness. The latter think that in their first
few months at Stanford they have gained enough perspec
tive and insight to what college life means that they can
nonchalantly imperil what is an important way of life for a
large body of students.
Perhaps I am being a bit harsh. Maybe these omnisicient
freshmen are, as they undoubtedly must believe, the mes
siahs for the 'NOs. But before the task force sent in its
recommendations to the University, a more informed, un
biased opinion should have been studied. This, unfortun
ately, cannot come from frat members, from whom emo
tions about their Stanford livelihood run high. I offer my
opinion, therefore, as a boarder at the Kappa Sigma fra
ternity on campus.
I never rushed any fraternity because I never considered
myself to be a fraternity "type," nor could I get myself too
worked up about the "brotherhood" inherent in frater
nities. I boarded because 1 was unguaranteed. Next year I

will he guaranteed, and thus have little personal motive in
writing this letter other than sorting out the truth trom all
the adolescent nonsense written as ol late.
Although I. too. had a preconceived notion of what
fraternities were all about when I lirst started living at
Kappa Sigma. m\ opinions quickly changed. I hese guvs. I
am sorry to disappoint you. are not the "sex Mends the
University adamantly insists they must be. nor do they in
tend to do anybody harm. Sure, they like to drink, but
their handling of alcohol is far more mature than in many
of the dorm parties I have been in during my first two
years at Stanford. In addition, they like to go out, dance,
socialize, initiate community activities and yes, even have
fun. Fraternities add an extra-curriculai dimension that
embellishes our conception of college life, and they serve
to make college life more enjoyable.
Some like this notion of "brotherhood." I am told, and
so there should be a choice, at least, to join or not to join.
As far as formal meetings are concerned, ol course, I have
no idea what goes on. All I know is that outside of the
meetings. I have made good friends, participated in more
community activities and have had more fun this year than
ever before. And I don't even drink.
My recommendation is that the University not only con
tinue to recognize the fraternities on campus, but also rec
ognize that frat members are people, too — who are not
looking out for a way to undermine the University, but
who are out to enjoy a way of life not offered in dorms.
