# HARDY CALLCOTT
## Zschau's record an embarrassment 
### 
While the attention of the area
media has been focused on the
presidential election, one of the most
interesting local races in the country is
unfolding right around us. In 1982.

VIEWPOINT

/.schau bought the 12th District U.S.
congressional seat, which includes the
Stanford campus, by spending more
than 13 times as much money on his
campaign as his Democratic op
ponent. /.schau is going to get a run
for his money, though, in 1984 against
Stanford Prof. Martin Carnoy.
/.schau ran as an independent
liberal Republican in 1982, distancing
himself from President Reagan,
/schau at home continues to try to
cultivate a liberal image acceptable to
Northern California voters. But his
record in Washington belies his words.
Probably we shouldn't be surprised
that /schau has voted conservative on
economic issues, although it is difficult
to understand his hard-line opposition
to programs like education and child
nutrition But /.schau has also by far
the worst environmental record of any
area congressman. He has voted the

straight Reagan line in favor of the
massive Pentagon arms buildup. And
/.schau has proven a completely loy;il
administration backer on Central
America.
Not only does this voting record
reflect a senseless lack of priorities, it
also directly contradicts what /.schau's
own speeches say he believes. In fact,
/.schau has an overall voting record
more pro-Reagan than even most of
the other Republicans in the House of
Representative's.
But Ed /.schau would still probably
have a dull, safe re-election campaign
in 1984 if he had not drawn an un
usually tough opponent. Martin Car
noy has an engineering degree from
Caltech, an economics degree from
Chicago and teaches education at
Stanford. These are obviously three of
the areas of expertise most needed in
government for the IMSOs. Carnoy as
a professor has also specialized in in
ternational development, with a long
standing interest in Latin America.
Carnoy is most knowledgable on many
of /.schau's most vulnerable issues.
Because of the symbolic significance
of this Silicon Valley district, the
Carnoy-/.schau battle will have an im
pact beyond just this area. Carnoy's

engineering and /schau's business
backgrounds balance out each other in
the meeca of high-tech. Carnoy has
chosen to make the key issue ol this
campaign that of war and peace. This
may be a dangerous strategy, consid
ering the concentration of defense in
dustries here.
But Carnoy wants to wean Silicon
Valley from its military dependence,
and give it a broader, more stable eco
nomic base. Carnoy believes that area
voters are frightened by an uncon
trollable arms race and disgusted by a
simplistic ideological and militaristic
approach to Central America and the
Third World.
In 19N4. /.schau seems to want it
both ways, lie wants to ride Reagan's
coattails. but he also wants to be per
ceived as an independent open
minded moderate. If anyone can
pierce the "two I d /schaus" paradox,
it is Martin Carnoy. Anil if the voters
of the 12th District are educated
about how Eid /schau has actually
voted in Congress, Martin Carnoy will
be moving to Washington. D.C., after
the November election.
