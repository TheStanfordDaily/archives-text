# Writing to keep the editor happy

"You're lying!" snarled the old man. "I don't
know what sort of sick, twisted reason you might
have, but I swear you won't get away with it!"
"B-but. your Holiness â€”" stammered the
waiter, amazed.
"Hey. relax, pontiff!" I interrupted. "The man
made an addition error, that's all there is to it.
Anyway, it's on me, John Paul."
Later, my companion was contrite. "Thanks for
setting me straight back there," he said. I said,
rightly, that it was nothing; it was just a matter of
keeping one's head.
"That's true, but it seems to come so easily to
you. I marvel at your self-possession. It's a shame
more people don't listen to you, as you give very
good advice. Your columns in The Daily could aid
so many people in desperate need ol help.
"1 read the one that had Mick Jagger in it," He
continued, proudly. "It seemed like it was going to
have some sort of important point in it."
My mood abruptly darkened, and we cut short
our meeting. Obviously, my friend had fallen into
the habit of not reading beyond the "grabber" in
tro paragraphs of my columns.
1 feel partly to blame for this. While intended for
the inspiration and reformation ol my readers, my
columns do in fact do a disservice in that they are
sometimes far too lengthy for the abbrieviated at
tention spans of my audience. This, sadly, is neces
sary. Even if I was able to restrict myself to solving
only one of mankind's perennial problems per
column, it would still take me 40 inches of type to
do it.
Even those astute enough to plow through all
the copy are often given slight reward. There exists
a certain wretch, called an editor, whose function.

obviously, is to edit out any material of sense or
potency within the articles under his care. My
pieces, connected as they arc by a fragile ligature
of internal logic and development, seems uniquely
vulnerable to this kind of journalistic evisceration.
An overlong politics/baseball piece shall puzzle
future scholars endlessly, bereft as they are of any
sort of Rosetta Stone to unlock the mystery.
What is to be done? Readers, once caught by a
snappy intro, are soon lost, while those who stick it
out have meager recompense for their pains, as no
worthwhile bit of writing has yet managed to
escape the editor's offices with its sense intact. I
am caught between an audience mostly interested
Qnly in the start of my pieces and a equally resolute
force obsessed solely in where it ends.
Do not measure your heroes by their defiance of
fate and circumstance; for if you do so, you may be
forced not to include me. Forthwith. I bow to the
pressure, and shall limit my columns to three
paragraphs at most. Obviously, spraying out one's
ideas by such a scattershot method, being forced to
drop a concept after the merest development, will
bring an early end to my creative abilities. I only
regret I have such a petty sacrifice to make upon
your altars.
Their Right to 112 ive Minutes of Fume
Many years ago, a bitter, twisted man ironically
suggested that the overcrowding in Ireland could
be eased by raising the surplus children to be sold
to the upper classes as gourmet meat. His
misanthropic sceme was. of course, unworkable, as
no one could really bring themselves to eat human
flesh, such a thing being too abhorrent to our
minds and presenting too many problems within
our own families.

Still, the problem persists, and even here in
America there are babies who starve to death or
die because of other wants. I low can we redeem
their useless lives? Where is there an industry with
a surplus ot resources necessary to support these
babes, one that also has a need for the sort of radi
cal newness they can bring.
I he answer is in Hollywood, in Televisionland.
Profits that normally go to cocaine can be used on
the children, diverting dollar flow from Colombia
to Gerber's. Furthermore, the children can,
judging by our tastes in television shows, make a
great contribution to the "Industry" itself. Put
these adorable babies on the air, two or three a
show, and have a skilled, well-trained man there to
torture them to death, live and in color. The ratings
will go through the roof!
Pretty interesting rending, eh?
\ ou see, I ve made a point, given my audience
something to think about and kept the attention of
those who arc only good lor three or so paragraphs
(il they managed to get through the tedious history
in the beginning. I should have worked Ozzy Os
bourne in there, somewhere. Furthermore, its
nearly invulnerable to editing, and articles in little
blocks like that can easily be juggled to fill a layout
in pleasing form.
Seems a (lawless expedient, caused by a pressing
exigency. I believe I shall stick to this format and
use it to make my make upon the public mind.
Alter all, it works for Paul Harvey and Andy
Rooney, giants both.
