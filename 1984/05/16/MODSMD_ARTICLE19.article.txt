## Einstein protege Hermanns works for world peace 
### BOB BARCKLAY Daily staff 
His room was cluttered with
the books and papers of a man
ot letters. There was a picture of
Albert Einstein hanging on the
wall. Prof. Emeritus William
Hermanns searched around his
Kingscote Garden apartment
for a poem he wanted to read.
l ike many of his poems, it
dealt with the possibility and
horrors of war, something this
World War I survivor knows a
lot about. Nonetheless, as in
Hermanns himself, there is a
feeling of optimism that per
meates much of his work.
Hermanns has been writing
poetry most of his life, but this is
only one of his many vocations.
Oi the others, perhaps his most
important now is his attempt to
fulfill a promise once made to
F.instein.
Hermanns met with Einstein
four times, the first in Berlin in
1930, and has written a book
containing the conversations of
those meetings entitled
"Einstein and the Poet: In
Search of the Cosmic Man."
In those conversations the
men often talked about how to
achieve worldwide peace. Both
Einstein and Hermanns felt the
world's young people would
play a critical part in the peace
process. Hermanns promised
Einstein that he would try to
reach these young people. "And
Albert Einstein told little
Willy," as Hermanns often
refers to himself, "that he
should unite the youth of the
world for peace."
Hermanns has been trying to
do this since his first conversa
tion with the famous physicist.

He explained that the purpose
of his writings is to foster the
"moral conscience" of his
readers.
The collective conscience of
the world's youth is very impor
tant to Hermanns. He fears that
without someone to "shape
their conscience" and teach
them to he "a brother to their
neighbor." a third world war is
inevitable.
He explained that "when
people are younger they are

'Albert Einstein
prophesied that I
would see the third
world war unless
something was done
soon/
- William Hermanns

molded by the thoughts of
others rather than their own ex
periences or evaluations." Her
manns said that this results in
the continuation of prejudices
and biases from one generation
to the next.
His hope is to break this
seemingly inexorable cycle — if
not through his poetry, then
through a corporation he has
just formed called the Einstein-
I lermanns Foundation.
With the help of his adopted
son Ken Norton, who has
devoted his life to helping Her
manns to achieve his dream of
worldwide peace, the two hope

to start what they call a World
Youth Parliament. Its purpose
explained Norton, "is to expose
young people to other cultures
as a way of understanding the
world."
People involved in the Foun
dation would participate in an
exchange program in another
country and then become a
member of the Youth Parlia
ment.
Norton and Hermanns hoped
that it would in some way be
tied to or recognized by the
United Nations.
At the moment, the Youth
Parliament is hardly more than
an idea. But with the creation of
the Einstein-Hermanns Foun
dation and its seven-member
board of directors, these' two
men hope to see the realization
of their goals soon.
Hermanns cites the battle of
Verdun in World War 1 as the
source of the unlimited energy
that he devotes to his work. He
says that in that battle he made
a promise that if he lived he
would devote his life to achiev
ing peace.
At age N9 he has not forgot
ten that promise. Unlike many
who would have given up hope
after so many years, Hermanns
is still devoting much of his
energies to the fulfillment of the
vow he made on the battlefield
of Verdun.
Nevertheless, the possibility
of war looms largely in Her
manns' mind."Albert Einstein
prophesied that I would live to
see the third world war unless
something was done soon," said
Hermanns. Then he added
gravely,,"l am almost 90 years
old."
