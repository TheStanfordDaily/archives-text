# 500 convene for fraternity task force forum
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
More than 500 students cheered pro-fraternity speakers
who addressed the Task Force to Study Fraternities and
Sororities at a public forum yesterday afternoon in Tresid
der Union.
"To eliminate fraternity housing is to eliminate a
housing option within the University and is to promote
uniformity and not diversity within the system. This goal of
Residential Education is in itself an argument for the con
tinued existence of fraternities," Sigma Alpha Epsilon
member Mike Gentlesk said.
About 30 students and alumni defended the right of
fraternal organizations at Stanford to exist and to be
housed, many justifying the subjective selection process,
most citing specific advantages of the Greek system and all
receiving terrific applause from the polite but lively crowd.
Only a half dozen speakers condemned the University's
fraternal system.
Among those who advocated maintaining the status quo
were a Stanford Kappa Sigma alumnus who currently
serves as a national representative for his fraternity, a
Stanford Sigma Chi alumnus who is currently the Univer
sity's associate director of Undergraduate Admissions and
numerous fraternity and sorority members.
Task force advertisements for yesterday's forum in
cluded a two-sentence statement designed as a point of
departure for the meeting. "There is strong sentiment that
subjective selectivity and University housing are incom
patible and the task force is considering alternatives to the
Vv.rrent situation,'" the statement read.
"The task force is still questioning the place of subjec
tive groups at Stanford, including University recognition
of such groups and the allocation of resources to such
groups."
Members of the committee made it clear yesterday that
they had reached no final decisions but had simply agreed
on a direction to follow. The task force has met several

times in the past four months, both alone and with nearly
all the fraternal groups, in an effort to make as educated a
recommendation as possible, according to Business School
Prof. Oscar Serbein, chairman of the task force.
Yesterday's forum centered on the issue of fraternal or
ganizations' subjective selection and whether it harms in
dividuals or the University's random housing Draw sys
tem. Sigma Alpha Epsilon member Jeff Stuart expressed
the majority view.
"We, the members of SAE, feel that the practice of self
selection is important to the Greek system in that it
facilitates the development of a group of people character
ized by involvement and commitment that deals with goals
of each fraternity, and. in so doing, works towards the
goals of Residential Education," he said.
Stuart said his fraternity's chief selection criteria for is
suing bids — sincere interest in the members of the house,
diversity and a desire to get involved — are positive
qualities that are not unfairly discriminatory.
"I'd like to emphasize that a person is admitted to SAE
on the basis of positive points," he said. "One person's
negative impression cannot exclude someone from
anyone."
Sigma Chi alumnus Keith Light (Class of '78), associate
director of Undergraduate Admissions here, said the task
force should not make a recommendation without more
careful deliberation. He presented the committee with a
list of questions he felt were necessary to examine. "Do a
significant number of students feel fraternities rob them of
housing options?" he asked. "Is the Draw system really
fair simply because it's random? Should lucky students en
joy two, three or four years of luxury compared to others?
"What are the real effects of selectivity? Who is affected
or hurt, to what degree, and how?" he continued.
Kappa Sigma member Patrick Schultheis discussed
some benefits of housed fraternities. "The cohesive and
continuous atmosphere, for me, creates an environment
that helps foster community-building and leadership skills,

social relations and general respect and care for others."
Susie Scheiber, a member of the Alpha Phi sorority, said
students here should have the right to live in fraternal
houses.
"Presenting students with options is what makes a uni
versity a great university, a diverse university and a

respected university," she said.
"It's our school. It's for us," Andrew Cohen declared,
calling for the students' right to self-determination in
maintaining or altering the current Greek system. Cohen.

itanrord alumnus Dale Pfau speaks out at yesterday's task force open forum at Tresidder.
a member of Phi Delta Theta. offered
as precedent the student vote 40 years
ago that abolished sororities at the
University.
Phi Delt Mack Tilling lashed out at
task force procedures and rules he
deemed unfair, specifically a plea from
Serbein to limit all forum speeches to
the issues of housing and self
selection.
"I don't see that it's fair lor us to
have to play with our hands tied be
hind our backs." he said.
Delta Upsilon President Luke Cole
had words of admonition for the task
force. "At this point it might be easy
to decide to remove all fraternities
from campus and be done with the,
quote, problem. But this would create

more problems than it would solve.
Among those who spoke against
fraternities were Gerard Koskovich.
member ol the (iay and Lesbian Al
liance at Stanford, and Kappa Alpha
Theta rush chairperson Julie Hansen.
"The fact remains that sorority rush
is getting more and more competi
tive." Hansen said. "I think this com
petitiveness only intensifies the overall
bad feelings. . . . These feelings are
real and they can't be ignored."
One harsh critic, hli/abeth
Schwartz, cited an obscene strip-tease
at a fraternity bachelor party as an ex
ample of an undesirable incident that
would not have occurred in a Draw
tilled house.
