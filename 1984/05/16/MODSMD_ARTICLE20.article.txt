Tears welled up when Terms of Endearment'* Deborah
Winger said goodbye to her children and adrenaline raced
as The Shilling's Jack Nicholson chased his son with an
axe. Ideally, not only is emotion tied to drama but so is all
of psychology. Pyschology Prof. Philip /.imbardo and
Patricia Ryan of the Drama Department have col
laborated on a new class they are currently teaching called
Psychology, and Drama: Identity and Role" to find the
"intersection where the two areas of knowledge meet."
The instructors enjoy a relationship in which they each
benefit from the insight the other has to offer while passing
on their expertise to the 34 students in the class. To dis
cover more about "the nature of the role itself' in both
theoretical and theatrical ways, they do improvisations, at
tend lectures and work on projects during the three-hour
class even Monday.
Despite the conspicuous absence of notebooks, desks

and anxiety, the students find the class especially challeng
ing to their creativity as they examine drama through psycho
logical interpretation and psychology through dramatic in
terpretation. "It's definitely a class you would take spring
quarter. You walk in the class and don't know exactly what
to expect," said junior Martha Aquilar.
What students first encounter is a furniture-bare studio
which immediately sets the tone. Instead of regular
lectures, the class is devoted primarily to student participa
tion and involvement.
"As a psychology major," junior Carolyn Weisz said, "I
really appreciate the different approach to the subject that
drama offers." She and a few classmates have just com
pleted a study of "Emotion and Time" in which they ex
plored how time orientation, whether past, present or
future, affects behavior. Through improvisations, the
group found preoccupation with the future linked with

anxiety and obsession with the past â€” often linked with
depression.
Other groups of students analyzed the dramas of
everyday lite, tor instance the dynamics of a sorority rush
party or the difficulties of a conversation with an older
brother. One group demonstrated the practical applica
tions of the course by doing a study on psychodrama. a
therapy used to help patients work out problems.
A premise to the undertaking of the class was that
playing a role is a part of real life, not just something you
see in the movies or in a play. Ryan adds, "Even your body
language is in line with what's happening in your mind."
For the drama students in the class, achieving this body
language is important in creating a "more truthful in
dicator of the transaction," Ryan said. Eye contact, slow
breathing and smooth movement, for example, help the
actor to create an assertive character with "high status."
/imbardo points out in his lectures that when different

roles arc assumed by a person, he can he made to act in
certain corresponding manners. "Acts ol savagery are
often committed under a guise." he said. "Bv putting on a
uniform you may become the uniform. He cites the K.ti
klux Klan and the Nazis as examples of people who cross
the boundary between drama and psychology by assuming
roles and becoming anonymous appendages to their uni
forms.
Since role playing transcends the realm of the stage, per
haps psychology and drama are more similar than one may
think. In one class, the students explored the consequences
of putting on masks. "With a mask on, your character
changes, and besides, when you are anonymous, you can
do anything," Aguilar explained.
Whether playing roles or examining them, students
seem to enjoy Psychology 170/ Drama 124. Says Weisz. "It
helps explain why people act the way they do."
