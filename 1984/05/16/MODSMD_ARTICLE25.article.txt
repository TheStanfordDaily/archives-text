l.os \ngeles — Leading 6-5 in
the second-set tie breaker.
I.eigh Anne Eldredge served
National Championship point.
USC's Cheryl Jones returned
the serve, and Eldredge then hit
a backhand shot as Jones
charged the net. Jones got her
racket ■>. the shot, but hit it low
into the net to give Stanford the
1 MS4 NC AA Team Champion
ship yesterday at the Los An
geles Tennis Center.

Eldredge's win gave Stanford
an insurmountable 5-0 lead and
the Cardinal its third national
championship since its
second in the last three years.
Patty Pendick followed
Eldredge by defeating Kelly
Henry to make the final score 6-
0. The doubles matches were
cancelled.
The shutout surprised just
about everyone. Stanford par
tisans included. "Who does it 6-
0?" Linda (iates. herself a win
ner over Cecila Fernandez.

asked rhetorically as the netters
celebrated following the «nv
"Nil one's supposed to win it 6-
0!"
At first it appeared that Stan
ford's No. 4. 5 and 6 would be
the key lor the Cardinal, as they
were Monday in the 7-2 semi
final win over San Diego State.
The trio — Eldredge. Elise Bur
gin and Michelle Weiss — did
not drop a set the entire tourn
ment in compiling an aggregate
12-0 record.
The fact that they were
relegated to the back courts
here at the LATC — where
seating has not yet been in
stalled— did not affect the play
of the three in the least.
Weiss registered the Card's
first win of the afternoon by
quickly putting away Carol
Heynen. 6-1. 6-1. The match at
No. 6 took only 58 minutes
Burgin showed that she cer
tainly was back in form after the
back injury that kept her out tor
most of the year. Burgin. last
year's individual runner-up at
NCAAs. played the tournament
at No. 5 for the Card, and yes
terday closed out Susan Pendo.
6-1. 6-4.
Gates had been having her
problems at No. 2 the past two
days, losing both ol those
matches, but she came out with
a vengeance yesterday. Gates
dropped the first two games to
Fernandez, but rebounded to
win the set. 6-4. In the second
set she was simply unstoppable,
playing aggressively and putting
away the 6-4. 6-2 victory to give
Stanford a 3-0 lead.
At No. 3, Kate Gompert con
tinued her winning ways by dis
posing of Heliane Steden. 6-3,
6-1. Gompert did not lose a
match this year in dual match
competition. Yesterday she
played her usual patient
baseline game, but Steden also
sat back on the baseline and the
two seemed content to just hit
hall back to the each other.
Gompert hit it back a lot more
often, though.
With Gompert's win making
it 4-0, Eldredge was given the
opportunity to clinch the title
for the Cardinal. She had won
the first set easily, 6-2, but in

the second found herself tied at
5-5. 3-3. Jones look that point
with a winner to Eldredge's
right to lead 6-- but Eldredge.
served out the nest game to
force the deciding tiebreaker.
Midway through the breaker,
the Stanford team members
watching Eldicdgc's match
learned of Gompert s xictory on
the front courts. With the score
tied 5-5. Eldredge took the nest
point to bring on the deciding
National Championship point.
When Jones put her forehand
shot into the center of the net.
the netters broke into an im
promptu celebration.
Eldredge said that the impor
tance of the point did not occur
to her. "1 didn't want to think
about it." she said.
The Cardinal players and fol
lowers than headed over to the
main courts to see if Pendick
could nail down a clean sweep.
The Card's No. 1 player had lost
the first set. 6-3. but came back
to take the second by the same
score.
In the third. Pendick gave
new meaning to the word
"intensity." She simply played
some of her best tennis of the
year and won the set going
away, 6-0.
The netters then began to
celebrate for real. Hugs, kisses,
smiles and laughter were all
over the court as the Stanford
fans descended onto the play ing
area to join the festivities.
Stanford Head Coach Frank
Brennan explained the Card's
incredible performance — "We
just got everything together
today," he said.
The Cardinal finished the
season with a perfect 26-0
record. Brennan said that an un
defeated season was not a con
sideration when the year began.
"You don't even tend to think
about it,"he said. "I think we
had an extremely powerful
lineup, and we're lucky we
stayed healthy."
USC Head Coach Dave
Borelli summed up the after
noon as he passed Fendick as
she headed for the television in
terview area. "Congratulations,
Patty," he said. "The better
team won . . . goddamit."
