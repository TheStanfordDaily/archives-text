Los Angeles — For a team on the road for
over a week, the members of the Stanford wo
men's tennis team are fortunate to have all the
comforts of home. The netters are staying at
the Beverly Hills home of Stanford alumnus
Peter Bing through Saturday.
Head Coach Frank Brennan finds the situa
tion ideal. "If we were at a hotel, we'd have a
little more trouble getting together and meals
are always a hassle. You'll get two girls who
want Mexican, a couple who want pizza and
someone who wants a place with a salad bar.
Then you've got to find a place that s open
when the match is over.
"This way, we're all together and meals are
no problem. The Bings have been very good to
us. The refrigerator is stocked and the girls can
eat whenever they want."
Brennan's wife, Terry, has supervised the
cooking, but the whole team has pitched in to
help. The meals have range from sandwiches to
Terrv's homemade tortellini. Haagen-Dazs ice
cream is a favorite at dessert.
The dinner-time options are limited a bit,
though. After Monday's semifinal win over
San Diego State. Patty Pendick turned to Terry
and said. "I've got the serious Mexican

munchies!" Terry quickly inquired as to whe
ther f-'endiek had any experience cooking
Mexican food. Fendick hadn't, the idea was
immediately bagged.
The players are living two to a room, with a
bathroom for each room. Homework is a con
cern that they all must deal with, but evening
entertainment tends toward a game ol Frivial
Pursuit. Don't think the players don't take this
seriousl — 112 endick and Stephanie Savides
have been known to lie about answers when
the other team opened up a wide lead.
The players can also use the swimming pool
and — as if they don't see enough of it during
the day — a tennis court as well.
Brennan has been far from a tyrant in
making rules for the team. Ihc refrigerator is
stocked with beer, and wine is served with
dinner. When Brennan was asked about a cur
few. lie replied. "I figure about 3 a.m. I think
13 hours before the match is about right."
The team has gotten along well with the
Bings. Bing and his wife have been to all ol the
team's matches, and after yesterday's win were
embraced by the whole team. Ihc Card also
took a •"family picture" after the trophies were
handed out. since many of the players' parents
and friends were at the final match.
