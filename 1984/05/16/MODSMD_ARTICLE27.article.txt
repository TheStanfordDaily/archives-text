# Bruins ruin chance for sweep
## 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
The Stanford men's tennis team went into
the NCAA Finals in Athens, Ga., yesterday
with a five-game win streak in the champi
onship match. Unfortunately, the UCLA
Bruins put an end to that streak, as they
battled the Cardinal for a 5-4 victory.
Since 1972, the NCAA crown has gone to
a Pacific-10 Conference school, and since
the team-style concept began in 1977, Stan
ford and UCLA have been the only win
ners. The Card ended the team season with
an impressive 22-6 win-loss record.
Stanford began the tournament on Satur
day afternoon, and played five consecutive
matches against outstanding schools. "They
really did an outstanding job," Head Coach
Dick Gould said of his team.
From the very start, the Cardinal found
itsell involved in a very close match. Stan
ford won the three previous matches by the
identical score of 5-4. "Each match was
close. We were almost eliminated on the
first day; we had another dog fight against
Clcmson the next day; and in the semis,
Georgia was very tough," Gould said.
Yesterday Stanford, led by its No. I
singles, player, Dan Goldie, split the six

singles matches 3-3. Goldie knocked off the
Pac-10 singles champion, Michael Kures, in
a seemingly easy victory, 6-2, 6-3. On the
No. 3 court, Jim Grabb defeated Jim Pugh
6-4, 6-2.
Also for Stanford, Derrick Rostagno,
playing at No. 5, beat Chuck Willenborg in
straight sets, 6-4, 7-5.
Although the doubles teams did not al
ways play up to potential during the regular
season, the doubles squad became the
strength of the team during the tournament.
After Jeff Klaparda and Craig Venter
beat Goldie and Eric Rosenfeld 6-4, 6-3,
Stanford's No. 3 team of Rostagno and
Mark McKeen cruised past Fugh and David
Livingston 6-3, 6-1.
Thus, the championship came down to
the No. I doubles match between Grabb
and John Letts for Stanford and Kures and
Mark Basham for UCLA. The Bruin pair
jumped out to an early lead and captured
the first set 6-1. But Grabb and Letts fought
back and turned the next set around, win
ning 6-3.
Again, in the third set, UCLA obtained
an early lead as they broke Stanford's ser
vice to take a 2-0 advantage. The Card

returned with a break of their own and the
score was tied up again at 2-2. I hen in the
seventh game with the score still knotted,
Stanford broke service for a 4-3 advantage.
But the Bruins were not about to sur
render. They broke Stanford back quickly
and followed it by holding their own serve.
This made the set score 4-5 UCLA with
Stanford serving.
Cirabb and Letts put up resistance of their
own and tied the game score at 3-3. E3ut
Stanford's fortune ran out as Basham
returned the serve for a winner and gave the
championship to the Bruins.
"We had a great chance," Gould said,
"but we didn't blow it. UCLA just did an
outstanding job. You have to give them
credit. Still I thought our doubles teams
were tremendous. That was the first time we
beat their No. 3 doubles and we came really
close to winning at No. 1.
"I've gone to the finals (since 1977) five
times, but this was the toughest tournament.
The guys played four consecutive close
matches, and they held up well."
Although the team title is decided, the in
dividual championship has yet to be deter
mined.
