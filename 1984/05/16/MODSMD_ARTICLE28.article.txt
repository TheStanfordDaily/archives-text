The Stanford ultimate frisbee team didn't
know what to expect in Boston, but it returned
alter the weekend with the first-ever National
Collegiate Championship.
The team glided through the tournament
with surprising ease and confidence as it
dominated the predominantly Eastern field of
teams. "There's a certain attitude that Eastern
schools tend to be better . . . more of the
schools play and there are a lot more players
back there. But once we got going, we knew we
would win," explained junior Peter Hecht.
Using an innovative offense based on
"quarterbacks," "middles" and "deeps," the
Cardinal swept past Penn State, Ohio Univer
sity, Syracuse and Tufts by scores of 18-11, 18-

13, 18-4 and 18-11, respectively.
In the semifinals, the Cardinal faced Massa
chusetts in what was supposed to be the tough
est game of the tournament. But Stanford
easily disposed of them, 18-13, to get into the
finals against Glassboro State (N.J.).
The final was played to 21 instead of 18, a
factor which made the match go an incredible
three and a half hours. Most games last around
half that long. The Cardinal opened up a 10-5
lead, but Glassboro rallied back on some
mistakes and its tough zone defense to close to
11-9 at half and then tied the game several
times.
But the Cardinal never gave up the lead and
eventually ended the lengthy ordeal with a 21-
18 victory.
