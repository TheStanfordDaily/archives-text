# Cyclists take second in tourney

Three grueling championship
events culminated the Stanford
cycling team's collegiate season
in San Luis Obispo over the
weekend.
Stanford's 26 graduate and
undergraduate riders, coached
by Tim Nicholson and co
captained by Jenny Riesling and
Sean Devin, finished a strong
second of 12 teams, outscored
only by a much larger UC-Santa
Barbara squad. Together the
two rival teams dominated the
fields and point totals through
out the season.
A 10-mile time trial initiated
the tense competition Saturday
morning. This so-called race of

"truth" requires an individual,
concentrated and timed effort.
Riders are started at one
minute intervals and push them
se Ives without the help of dratts
or team tactics.
Two Stanford Experts, Brad
Chen and Russell Mead, had es
pecially strong trials, placing
second and fourth respectively.
The women's team contributed
almost as many points, winning
third, fourth and 12th place.
Novice A rider Steve Keehn s
time earned second-place
points.
That afternoon racers lined
up once again, this time for an
extremely hilly, 30.1 mile Road

Race. Savage 90-degree heat
and a total elevation gain of
2000 feet contributed to an un
usually high rate of attrition by
all schools.
First-year rider and Novice B.
Bob Myers won his Road Race
division. Eric Topp and Art
Walker finished the two gruel
ing laps required of the Expert
riders with powerful sprints
which netted them third and
fourth places respectively.
Katrin Tobin sprinted for the
women's second place. Her
teammate, Cini Brown, fol
lowed closely in fourth.
The final event of the
weekend and the season was

Sunday's Criterium. The
Criterium is a sprinter's race;
packs usually stay clustered
around characteristically sharp
corners and points are won in
large field and preem sprints.
The Stanford women's team
strong overall season perfor
mance culminated in this last
event. The three first-year
riders successfully combined
strength and teamwork to domi
nate the preem laps and place
first, second and fourth in the
field sprint. In the last six races
the small women's team has
aggressively matched the points
scored by the larger, more expe
rienced Santa Barbara team.
