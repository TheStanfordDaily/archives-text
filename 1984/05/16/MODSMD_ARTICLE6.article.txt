current political force."
■\mong the topics to be dealt with in
thj course, Raskin said, are "to what
degree unions are a plus or a minus in
terms of their impact on the con

sumer" and the impact of unions on
competition in American industry.
In addition, the course will cover
the labor movement's advocacy of New
