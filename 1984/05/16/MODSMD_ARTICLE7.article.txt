Religious meetings bill dumped
Washington —The House rejected a move yesterday to al
low student religious meetings during non-class hours in
public high schools, after critics of the bill claimed that it
would open the way tor cults and devil worship in classrooms.
I he 270-151 vote in favor of the bill fell I 1 votes short of
the two-thirds majority required for passage of the measure,
which followed Senate rejection last March 20 ot a proposed
constitutional amendment that would have permitted organ
ized. spoken prayer in public schools.
Supporting the bill were 123 Democrats and 147
Republicans. Opposed were 134 Democrats and 17
Republicans, with one member voting "present" and 1 I
abstaining.
President Reagan had (ought tor the school prayer amend
ment. which the Senate defeated 56-44, as a major election
year issue. He then embraced the concept of student use of
public school classrooms for voluntary religious meetings if
the school made classrooms available for other student extra
curricular activities.
Ihe defeated bill stated that any public secondary school
receiving federal aid, which generally allows student-initiated
groups to meet during non-class hours, could not discriminate
against voluntary religious groups.
School employees would have had to be present as
monitors, but not as participants, in such meetings, and no
student could have been forced to attend.
Marcos' foes score victory
Manila, Philippines — In a major setback for the govern
ment ot President Ferdinand Marcos, opposition candidates
tor the National Assembly won most of Manila's seats and
made strong showings in other areas, according to incomplete
returns yesterday.
Unofficial government figures and partial returns compiled
by an independent watchdog group differed on the number of
opposition candidates ahead in the race for IN3 seats. But
both tallies showed Marcos' opponents capturing a far greater
number of seats than the government anticipated.
Both tallies from Monday's voting showed the opposition
winning a majority in greater Manila, ruled by Marcos' wife
Imelda as governor and center of many government prestige
projects. Initial reports indicated five government Cabinet
ministers would lose their seats.
It was the first time the Marcos regime has failed to capture
a majority in the capital in his IS years as president. Marcos
was not a candidate.
The strong opposition showing was considered a reflection
ol dissatisfaction with Marcos' authoritarian rule, concern
with economic difficulties and reaction to the Aug. 21 assas
sination of Benigno Aquino — Marcos' chief political rival.
Nationwide, the government television reported 100 seats
were "firmly" in government hands. The National Citizens
Movement for Free Elections, set up by business and church
groups, had Marcos' party ahead in only 79 races while oppo
nents led in 91 with about 50 percent of the votes counted.
Terrorists release Americans
Colombo, Sri Lanka — Stanley and Mary Allen, an Ameri
can couple kidnapped by Tamil secessionists, were released
unharmed in northern Sri Lanka yesterday after five days in
captivity.
The pair was handed over blindfolded at the Roman Cath
olic bishop's residence in Jaffna, the northern capital where
they were abducted by the self-styled People's Liberation
Army which seeks a separate state in northern Sri Lanka.
National Security Minister Lalith Athulathmudali told
reporters the release came without any conditions or conces
sions by the government of President Junius Jeyewardene.
The kidnappers had earlier demanded $2 million in gold
and the release of 20 prisoners, threatening to kill the Ameri
can couple unless their demands were met.
Athulathmudali said the Aliens had been brought inside
the compound of the bishop's residence by two unidentified
young men, while another group waited outside.
Labor leader pleads the sth
35 times during questioning
Washington — Edward Hanley, president of the Hotel and
Restaurant Employees Union, exercised his Fifth Amend
ment rights 35 times yesterday in testimony before a Senate
subcommittee investigating alleged corruption in the union.
Appearing under subpoena before the permanent subcom
mittee on investigations. Hanley refused to say even that he is
president of the union or that he is on the Executive Council
of the AFL-CIO. He told his questioners nothing except his
home address in Illinois.
For nearly three years, the subcommittee has been inves
tigating charges that Hanley padded the union payroll with
friends, relatives and organized crime figures, made $6 mil
lion in questionable loans and received kickbacks using union
funds, and that Hanley got his job because of ties to alleged
Chicago organized crime figures such as Anthony "Big Tuna"
Accardo.
"This is outrageous," Sen. Warren Rudman, (R-N.H.),
said of Hanley's clam-like performance.
He and subcommittee Chairman William Roth Jr., (R-
Del.), who called Hanley's action "an abuse of an important
constitutional right." vowed indignantly that they will not let
the matter drop, charging that Hanley's "blanket refusal" to
answer questions has no legal basis. The Fifth Amendment to
the Constitution says no one in a criminal case can be com
pelled to testify against himself.
Mexican leader visits Reagan
Washington — Presidents Reagan and Miguel de la Madrid
of Mexico differed openly over Central American policy yes
terday as Reagan blamed totalitarian outsiders for pouring
gasoline on a neighborhood lire and his Mexican guest urged
rejection of "interventionist solutions of any kind."
During a formal welcoming ceremony for the Mexican
president on the South Lawn of the White House, Reagan ac
knowledged the United States and Mexico disagree about
how to deal with the turmoil to their south. But he said they
differ "not on goals or principles (but) on the means by which
to achieve our goals."
De la Madrid, whose nation is part of the Contadora group
trying to write a regional peace treaty for Central America,
warned that "the risk ol a generalized war, the scope and
duration of which no one can foresee, is growing."
"Every country on the continent must do its utmost to
restore peace and avoid war by respecting and upholding the
sovereignty of its people to decide their own destiny and by
rejecting interventionist solutions of any kind." the Mexican
president said, speaking through a translator.
