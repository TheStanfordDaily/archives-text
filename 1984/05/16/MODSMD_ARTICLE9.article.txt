# Libya treating raid as start of serious opposition
## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Tripoli. Libya — Col. Moam
mar Khadafy's government offi
cially has described the com
mando raid here last week by
Libyan exile infiltrators as a
flash in the pan. But in fact
authorities are treating it as the
beginning of the first sustained
opposition in the Libyan
leader's nearly 15 years in
power.
Roadblocks and house
searches aimed at catching
remaining infiltrators are con
tinuing. a week after the com
mando raid on a barracks used
by Khadafy and his forces.
Foreign diplomats have been
told that "because of security
reasons" thev must receive

permission before traveling to
border areas and the south.
A statement by Jusice Mini
ster Mufta Kaebi confirmed
widely held suspicions that the
10 attackers killed or captured
by Libyan forces at an apart
ment building here were not
acting alone.
All told. Kaebi said, at least
20 men were involved and two
were still at large. But for the
tirst time he also confirmed that
a string of previous officially un
explained incidents were acts of
sabotage carried out by the
same group.
These included fires at two
supermarkets — targeted be
cause of Khadafy's unpopular
nationalization of retail stores

— and at the main auditorium at
Fatah University, in retaliation
(or the government's hanging ol
two students there.
By implication at least, the
statement did little to dis
courage other persistent reports
that saboteurs, tot), were re
sponsible for huge explosions at
the army's vast arms and am
munition dump 35 miles south
west of Benghazi the night ol
March 24.
Libya has charged, without
providing evidence, that the in
filtrators, described as Islamic
fundamentalists belonging to
the Moslem Brothers, were
recruited by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency and trained
in the Sudan by Britain and the

United States. Kaebi said they
sought to "prove that Libya was
unstable, iii preparation for a
major aggression."
The saboteurs, according to
Libya, had instructions to assas
sinate key officials, sympathetic
diplomats and foreigners, espe
cially in the crucial oil industry
as well as radio and television
stations, airports and docks.
In the past the government
lias been able to dissipate the ef
fect of occasional acts of
sabotage and coup attempts by
dismissing them as rumors
floated by ineffectual exiles
plotting for the return of the im
potent and largely unpopular
monarchy.
