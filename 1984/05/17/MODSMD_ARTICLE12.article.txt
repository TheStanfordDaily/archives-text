## The 						Stanford Daily End the priority system 
### 
q ( We always worried about the fairness of return
"Tg residence priority in Stanford's student
housing draw. But Director of Housing Rodger
Whitney went a long way toward putting our
minds to rest a couple of weeks ago when he told
The Daily, "Many people seem to think that re
turning resident priorities at certain houses make
impossible for them to get in. Only 25 to 30
percent of residents (of houses that have this
priority) are returning from a previous year. That
means ... 70 to 75 percent of (those) houses will
be open to new residents."
If only that were always true.
Take the suites, for example. In the round one
results announced this week, all males assigned to
the four-person suites had SI priorites. To get an
SI, a four-person group must have had at least
three returning residents. At the very most, then,
only 25 percent of the four-man suites were
available to men who hadn't lived there before.
Just as we have said before that all students

should have equal opportunities to live in frater
nities, all students should have the same chance to
draw into a desirable residence, something that
clearly isn't happening now.
Residential Education's pat argument for re
turning residence priority is that new residents
benefit from the continuity provided by returning
residents. For the suites, this argument is particu
larly ridiculous. The suites are advertised as an
option for students not interested in intensive
group activities, so returning residents are of little
value there. And in undesirable dorms, returning
residence priority encourages continuity in only
one way: People who don't like living in a bad
place one year won't like living there next year,
either.
The idea of returning residence priority at a
university with such highs and lows in housing
options is a bad one and should be dropped soon.
Until it is, when it comes to Stanford housing the
rich will keep getting richer and the poor will
keep getting poorer.
