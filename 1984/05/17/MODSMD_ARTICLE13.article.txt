## Propagating more myths of vitamin C 
### 
HTTe misinformed remarks of col
u nnist Jason Matherly (Daily, May
3 concerning the use of vitamin C to
p event colds demand a response.
The great majority of published
studies, and indeed almost all prop
erly conducted studies of vitamin C
a id the common cold, fail to support
th e contention that the vitamin either
rt duces cold frequency or reduces the
severity of illness. In fact, in two
u|vtajices investigators whose work
hjis initially appeared to support the
P ailing hypothesis have published
ItiUuAv-up studies in which no benefit
of vitamin C could be demonstrated.
The conspiratorial notion that
medical journals refrain from publish
ing, material on vitamin C because of
pharmaceutical adver
tisers is simnJv not true.
J V
lfie primary peer-reviewed medical
journals in which controlled studies
woilld be likely to appear do not carry
advertising for cold remedies. Having
beeh a reviewer for the major clinical
journals, I take offense at the sugges
tion that publication policy would be
influenced in the manner that Mathe
rly jisserts. Furthermore, his state
ment is demonstrably false. The fact
thai controlled, randomized, properly
conducted clinical trials find no bene
fit t j the use of vitamin C is not the
fault of the journals, but a reflection
of t ie merits of the vitamin C case.
The statement that there has never
been a case of kidney stone resulting
from vitamin C is not true, although
this complication is admittedly rare.
Fublished experience with large
populations shows that a far more
like ly side effect of large doses of
viu min C is diarrhea, and 1 have
personally encountered several indi
vid aals whose chronic diahrrea ceased
wh :n supplemental vitamin C was
disi ontinued.
Nonetheless, I wish to emphasize
thajt the case against large doses of
\it< min C is not to be found in the
relatively trivial issue of toxicity, but
in the overwhelming preponderance

of scientifically acceptable data which
shows no benefit to their consump
tion.
1 wish to point out to Matherly and
other interested students that nutri
tion is a scientific discipline which
began neither with Pauling nor with
Adelle Davis. The same criteria of
scientific rigor should be applied to
the literature of human nutrition as
are demanded for any other area of
science. There are several courses
offered at Stanford in human nutri
tion, both on campus and at the
medical school. 1 invite Matherly to
avail himself of them.

Task force fails
to show interest
In the article, "Task force criticizes
frats," (Daily, May 10) Vance
McMahan claims, "Perhaps now
fraternities will realize what's on the
line and will come to the meeting
next week."
Well, perhaps the readers of The
Daily haven't heard that the "task
force" that visited my fraternity
cancelled one meeting with us, re
scheduled and then was one half hour
late.
Furthermore, five members of the
task force were to attend: The
"group" that eventually arrived here
consisted of one student. We are
disappointed with the University for
making so little attempt to hear our
concerns. Not a single administrator
scheduled to attend did so; well over
half of our house was in attendance.
We resent such a "task force"
making decisions about our future so
arbitrarily. Now, Mr. McMahan,
please tell me that we don't care.
