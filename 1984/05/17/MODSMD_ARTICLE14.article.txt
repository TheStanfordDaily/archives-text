# Abortion: the right to murder
## 
### 
Nearly one third of all humans conceived in this
country die before birth. These 1.5 million people
do not die because of accidents or genetic defects
or problems in their mothers' reproductive sys
tems. They are killed at the rate of more than 4000
every day by doctors at the order of mothers. They
are victims of abortions.
Criminal laws in the United States against abor
tion were invalidated in 1973 when the Supreme
Court voted that the laws violated a woman's Con
stitutional "right of privacy." The court ruled to al
low only abortions up to six months, judging that
the state's "important and legitimate interest in
potential life" took precedent over the mother's
individual rights after the second trimester of preg
nancy.
The two basic topics on which the court passed
judgment in 1973 are the basis of the abortion
controversy today: 1) the human or non-human
nature of the fetus, and 2) the rights of the mother.
To those who question a fetus' humanness and
who quarrel with my use of the words "human"
and "people" in reference to unborns above, I
would pose only one question: Where and how
does one draw the line between an expendable
fetus and a human life that is protectodgander our
Constitution?
The Supreme Court decided in Roe v. Wade in
1973 that life begins legally at childbirth: From
that point alone an infant is entitled to the Consti
tution's protection. Doctors cannot agree on when
protectable human life begins. It is astonishing
how very little consensus there is in the medical
community about when to attach to a fetus the
label "Now human — Do not kill." Some say an
infant is killable only under 10 weeks. Others say
only under 15. Still others place the magic time at
18, 20 or 24 weeks.
If one subscribes to the Supreme Court's judg
ment, one would condone the murder of an infant
one minute before birth but condemn it one min
ute afterward. What change in development in the
human organism occurs within those two minutes
that transforms an expendable human life into a
protectable one? Americans who would condone a
ninth-month abortion seem confined to the bench
of the Supreme Court: not even the most radical
pro-abortionists condone (publicly, at least) late
third trimester abortions.
What magical difference, then, between a third
trimester infant and one in its first or second
trimester makes one killable and the other not
killable? Certainly one is more developed and less
dependent than the other, but is one less human
than the other? Most would not consider a one
year-old infant less human than a five-year-old
child.
If one decides that differences in development
and dependence are somehow great enough to al
low abortions early in pregnancy, I would ask.

again, where does one draw the line between those
lives that are disposable and those that are
protected? If one chooses 10 weeks, why is the
9'/2-week-old killable when the 10 1 /:-week-old is
not? If one chooses 24 weeks, what makes the
24'/2-week-old's life sacred and the 23'/i-week
old's expendable?
Players of such a numbers game deceive them
selves. They feebly rationalize in attempts to avoid
guilt and evade responsibility for murder. Any or
ganism carrying the characteristic genetic code of
homo sapiens is human: just as human as you or I.

Changes after conception are simply changes in
development and dependence — maturations no
different from those a person undergoes from in
fancy to childhood to adolescence to adulthood.
Whether a human being is killed inside the mo
ther's womb or following a brutal robbery and
assault, the act of killing is no different: It is still
murder. Whether a human is killed at the hands of
a madman or a serene M.D., by means of a rusted
butcher's knife or a pair of stainless forceps, in a
cluttered alley or in a sterile operating room, the
act is equally brutal, equally murderous, equally
despicable.
Many seeking to justify abortion point to a wo
man's freedom of choice in both deciding what
happens to her body and deciding whether or not
to become a mother. Certainly each American has
control over his or her own body, and all women
may decide whether or not to become mothers.
But, as civil liberties activist Juli Loesch wrote so
eloquently: "Once a woman has conceived she can

no longer choose whether or not to become a mo
ther. Biologically she already is a mother. Her oil
spring. a separate and genetically unique
individual, is already in existence .... The wo
man's rights are then limited, as every right is lim
ited. by the existence of another human being who
also has rights."
A pregnant woman does face a choice in decid
ing whether or not to abort her child. She would
face the same choice if she were to hold a pistoPto
her 15-year-old son's head. Murder by scalpel as
well as murder by handgun should be illegal.
Some counter "But you can't legislate
morality." What, may I ask. does one do when one
passes laws against murder and rape, or when one
passes a Constitutional amendment outlawing
slavery? Others protest, "Don't force your morals
on me." Would we accept such a plea from a mo
ther who had murdered her 10-year-old daughter?
Did our ancestors accept such objections from
slaveholders?
Should abortions ever be performed? One might
ask the question this way: What is a "good reason"
for killing a human being? With few exceptions,
mothers' decisions for having abortions could be
reduced to this simple oath: "I place the value of
my right to engage in consequence-free sexual in
tercourse and of my right to avoid inconvenience
above the value of human life." Outlaws who shot
annoying, snoring roommates in their sleep per
ceived the value of human life similarly.
•'1 place the value of my right to avoid inconven
ience above the value of a human life." Is there
any comparison between the embarrassment ot a
teenager's loss of innocence or the inconvenience
of loss of work and the murder ot a human being.' I
hope for men and women who are able to justify
such a sacrifice that no one decides someday that
their existence is inconvenient. Adolf Hitler made
that sort of decision 40 years ago.
Should a woman whose life is in danger from
pregnancy be allowed to have an abortion? If she
chooses to do so. most certainly. Every human has
the right to self-defense and self-preservation. But
no human has the right to murder at will.
Americans a century from now will probably
look back at abortion and their ancestors'
supposed belief in the sanctity of human life much
as we look back with shame at the hypocrisy of
slavery and the lip service our countrymen paid to
the words "all men are created equal."
This column comes from the pen of neither a
Catholic struggling to comply with the decrees of
bishops nor a Moral Majority member on a
crusade with Jerry Falwell. It comes from the heart
of a human being who is sickened by the con
demned annual slaughter of more than 1.5 million
of his fellow human beings in America.

Players of such a numbers game deceive them
selves. They feebly rationalize in attempts to avoid
guilt and evade responsibility for murder. Any or
ganism carrying the characteristic genetic code of
homo sapiens is human: just as human as you or I.

Changes after conception are simply changes in
development and dependence — maturations no
different from those a person undergoes from in
fancy to childhood to adolescence to adulthood.
Whether a human being is killed inside the mo
ther's womb or following a brutal robbery and
assault, the act of killing is no different: It is still
murder. Whether a human is killed at the hands of
a madman or a serene M.D., by means of a rusted
butcher's knife or a pair of stainless forceps, in a
cluttered alley or in a sterile operating room, the
act is equally brutal, equally murderous, equally
despicable.
Many seeking to justify abortion point to a wo
man's freedom of choice in both deciding what
happens to her body and deciding whether or not
to become a mother. Certainly each American has
control over his or her own body, and all women
may decide whether or not to become mothers.
But, as civil liberties activist Juli Loesch wrote so
eloquently: "Once a woman has conceived she can

no longer choose whether or not to become a mo
ther. Biologically she already is a mother. Her oil
spring. a separate and genetically unique
individual, is already in existence .... The wo
man's rights are then limited, as every right is lim
ited. by the existence of another human being who
also has rights."
A pregnant woman does face a choice in decid
ing whether or not to abort her child. She would
face the same choice if she were to hold a pistoPto
her 15-year-old son's head. Murder by scalpel as
well as murder by handgun should be illegal.
Some counter "But you can't legislate
morality." What, may I ask. does one do when one
passes laws against murder and rape, or when one
passes a Constitutional amendment outlawing
slavery? Others protest, "Don't force your morals
on me." Would we accept such a plea from a mo
ther who had murdered her 10-year-old daughter?
Did our ancestors accept such objections from
slaveholders?
Should abortions ever be performed? One might
ask the question this way: What is a "good reason"
for killing a human being? With few exceptions,
mothers' decisions for having abortions could be
reduced to this simple oath: "I place the value of
my right to engage in consequence-free sexual in
tercourse and of my right to avoid inconvenience
above the value of human life." Outlaws who shot
annoying, snoring roommates in their sleep per
ceived the value of human life similarly.
•'1 place the value of my right to avoid inconven
ience above the value of a human life." Is there
any comparison between the embarrassment ot a
teenager's loss of innocence or the inconvenience
of loss of work and the murder ot a human being.' I
hope for men and women who are able to justify
such a sacrifice that no one decides someday that
their existence is inconvenient. Adolf Hitler made
that sort of decision 40 years ago.
Should a woman whose life is in danger from
pregnancy be allowed to have an abortion? If she
chooses to do so. most certainly. Every human has
the right to self-defense and self-preservation. But
no human has the right to murder at will.
Americans a century from now will probably
look back at abortion and their ancestors'
supposed belief in the sanctity of human life much
as we look back with shame at the hypocrisy of
slavery and the lip service our countrymen paid to
the words "all men are created equal."
This column comes from the pen of neither a
Catholic struggling to comply with the decrees of
bishops nor a Moral Majority member on a
crusade with Jerry Falwell. It comes from the heart
of a human being who is sickened by the con
demned annual slaughter of more than 1.5 million
of his fellow human beings in America.

Nearly one third of all humans conceived in this
country die before birth. These 1.5 million people
do not die because of accidents or genetic defects
or problems in their mothers' reproductive sys
tems. They are killed at the rate of more than 4000
every day by doctors at the order of mothers. They
are victims of abortions.
Criminal laws in the United States against abor
tion were invalidated in 1973 when the Supreme
Court voted that the laws violated a woman's Con
stitutional "right of privacy." The court ruled to al
low only abortions up to six months, judging that
the state's "important and legitimate interest in
potential life" took precedent over the mother's
individual rights after the second trimester of preg
nancy.
The two basic topics on which the court passed
judgment in 1973 are the basis of the abortion
controversy today: 1) the human or non-human
nature of the fetus, and 2) the rights of the mother.
To those who question a fetus' humanness and
who quarrel with my use of the words "human"
and "people" in reference to unborns above, I
would pose only one question: Where and how
does one draw the line between an expendable
fetus and a human life that is protectodgander our
Constitution?
The Supreme Court decided in Roe v. Wade in
1973 that life begins legally at childbirth: From
that point alone an infant is entitled to the Consti
tution's protection. Doctors cannot agree on when
protectable human life begins. It is astonishing
how very little consensus there is in the medical
community about when to attach to a fetus the
label "Now human — Do not kill." Some say an
infant is killable only under 10 weeks. Others say
only under 15. Still others place the magic time at
18, 20 or 24 weeks.
If one subscribes to the Supreme Court's judg
ment, one would condone the murder of an infant
one minute before birth but condemn it one min
ute afterward. What change in development in the
human organism occurs within those two minutes
that transforms an expendable human life into a
protectable one? Americans who would condone a
ninth-month abortion seem confined to the bench
of the Supreme Court: not even the most radical
pro-abortionists condone (publicly, at least) late
third trimester abortions.
What magical difference, then, between a third
trimester infant and one in its first or second
trimester makes one killable and the other not
killable? Certainly one is more developed and less
dependent than the other, but is one less human
than the other? Most would not consider a one
year-old infant less human than a five-year-old
child.
If one decides that differences in development
and dependence are somehow great enough to al
low abortions early in pregnancy, I would ask.

again, where does one draw the line between those
lives that are disposable and those that are
protected? If one chooses 10 weeks, why is the
9'/2-week-old killable when the 10 1 /:-week-old is
not? If one chooses 24 weeks, what makes the
24'/2-week-old's life sacred and the 23'/i-week
old's expendable?
