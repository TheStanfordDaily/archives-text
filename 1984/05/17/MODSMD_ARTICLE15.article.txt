## pun control regulations a necessity 
### 
In David Platters viewpoint "A new call for
rime control," (Daily, May 10), the author writes
hat the Second Amendment's guarantee of a right
o~*ticar arms is one of America's "least
inderstood" liberties. Unfortunately, this true ob
crvation too often serves as an excuse to inveigh
gainst gun control — of whatever kind — as un
onstitutional.
A focus on the actual words of the amendment
eminds us why the Supreme Court, as recently as
he Morton Grove case allowing a Chicago suburb

VIEWPOINT

Is gun control law, has consistently rejected such
s anachronistic interpretation. The framers wrote
uring a period when "(a) well-regulated Militia"
' /as "necessary to the security of a free state," and
i hus included these words before the reference to
he right to bear arms in the Second Amendment,
n this era of huge defense spending and standing
irmies, most constitutional scholars agree that the
latere of the collective right defined by the framers
s substantially different from the individual rights
pbbied for by powerful interest groups such as the
National Rifle Association (NRA).
Moreover, any constitutional right that exists is
10 more absolute than other fundamental rights
.uftl as freedom of speech. The public interest in
dicing violence must be weighed against the so
:i;flinterest in allowing handguns such as Saturday
flight Specials to proliferate. For after all. most
idvocates of "gun control" are not absolutist; they
imit calls for reform to reasonable regulation that
tops short of the parade of horrors envisioned by
hd'NRA. Platter rightly recognizes the paranoia
<VrTtent in the extremely widespread possession of

handguns among the American public but does not
discuss the paranoia in thinking that regulation will
inevitably lead to confiscation of all rifles and then,
in the words of the NRA, "totalitarian tyranny."
The most powerful argument against handgun
regulation is that handgun possession deters
"would-be burglars, rapists and other criminals,"
as Platter notes. Yet studies prove that those who
resist crimes with handguns are 10 times more
likely to die than those without handguns. And just
as powerful are the concrete statistics of lives saved
in countries that have gun control, like Britain.
The number of people killed by handguns in just
one of our major cities is a huge multiple of all
those killed by handguns in Britain and other "gun
control" countries combined. The obvious reason
that deaths continue in cities like New York and
Boston is that one state's gun contol measures can
not wholly eliminate handgun deaths when sur
rounding states have no gun control regulation at
all. New York's law has been very successful, as
only a small percentage of handgun deaths were
attributable to guns purchased in that state. The
moral is that national legislation is required.
The most important point is that reasonable
regulation can decrease the need for deterrence
and simultaneously decrease the need for absorb
ing the social costs of violent crime, accidental
deaths and crimes of passion. Platter may not
believe that it is "the government's role to protect
an individual from himself or his loved ones," but
our legal system incorporates that belief. Consider,
for example, the illegality of child abuse, homicide,
drunk driving and suicide. Suicides with handguns
are infinitely more successful than attempts with
other methods, and the suicide-recants who later
regret their action would also disagree with Plat

ter's assessment. The prevalence of crimes of pas
sion and purely accidental deaths is even more
tragic because it is so unnecessary. In short,
"good" people are also responsible for handgun
deaths.
Specific "gun control" regulation that falls short
of a complete ban on firearms could make huge
strides both in saving lives and in reducing the viol
ent mentality that psychologically underlies our se
vere crime problem. For example, federal legisla
tion should: 1) ban Saturday Night Specials
(defined as handguns with barrels less than three
inches) 2) provide for registration of all handguns
with police 3) institute strict licensing to allow
tracing of guns used in crimes, as well as backup
identity-checks on potential purchasers 4) es
tablish a mandatory cooling-off period delaying
receipt of a handgun anywhere from 4K hours to
one month, to allow retlection prior to suicides or
crimes of passion and 5) require gun safety
courses prior to purchase, as Platter suggests. Any
combination of these or other imaginative methods
would carefully address the severe problems
caused by handgun violence.
I believe that rhetoric about "crime control, not
gun control" being "the answer" sets up an artifi
cial distinction which reflects an inscnsitivity to the
relationship between handguns and crime.
Similarly, mere invocation of the Second Amend
ment does not advance discourse. Old methods of
cracking down on handgun offenders have not only
been ineffective, but have led to crowded prisons
that no one seems to know what to do about. It
would be a crime for society to continue to allow
powerful special interests to obstruct reasonable
steps toward solving the problem.
