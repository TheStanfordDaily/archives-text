the eve of today's exhibition game with
an Francisco Giants, the Stanford
iBLSCbaII team received an official invitation to
'HSNCAA Regionals, capping a late-season
toward the top of the Pacific-10 Confer-
Southern Division.
jSSJßntord hosted the Giants two vears ago
tfmFthe two clubs will square off for only the
second time today in a benefit game for the
Stanford baseball program. The contest
hjegins at 1 p.m. in Sunken Diamond, and if
you enjoy fireworks, arrive at noon when San
Hrancisco is scheduled to take batting
practice.
| The Giants appearance, however, takes a
back seat to yesterday's announcement of
Stanford's invitation to the 36-team national
championship tournament. "We have been
selected," Head Coach Mark Marquess
declared. "Both USC and (we) are going and
we're really excited."
Marquess" statement ended speculation as
to whether the NCAA selection would this
yfear, the first in which the NCAA has allowed
the selection of more than two teams from the
same conference, choose three teams from the
Pjac-10 Southern Division.
The 15th-ranked Cardinal and No. 13 USC
cfeated the confusion by finishing in a second
place tie behind No. 1-ranked Arizona State
in the "Six-Pac" final standings. Stanford
trailed the USC Trojans by four games mid
way through the conference season, but
rOared through the season's second half with
the best record in the conference to tie the
Trojans with an 18-12 mark. The Cardinal
finished with a 36-24-1 overall slate while
USC ended its season with a 44-21 record.
jThe six-man selection committee also an
nounced at-large invitations to six other
sqhools: Texas A&M, New Orleans, Univer
sity of Nevada-Las Vegas, Mississippi State,
Oklahoma and South Carolina.
Only three at-large berths remain open and
17 of the 25 automatic conference bids have
been determined. The conference champions
already slated to participate are as follows:
ASU, Texas, North Carolina, Appalachian
State, Lamar, Fresno State, Grambling,
Rider, Harvard, Seton Hall, Oklahoma State,

East Carolina. Temple. Central Michigan.
South Alabama. Florida State and Fullerton
State.
Stanford still does not know the site at
which it will play. However, five of the eight
regional hosts. ASU. Fresno State. Oklahoma
State. Florida State and Texas, were selected
earlier this week. The Regionals will begin on
May 24 and 25 and the winners of each
regional advance to the College World Series
beginning June 1 in Omaha. Neb.
The remaining bids and sites are contingent
on the results of various conference tourna
ments being played this week. The selections,
as well as Stanford's destination, will be an
nounced on Monday.
Today's exhibition game will feature league
leaders from both the "Six-Pac" and the Na
tional League. The Giants, fresh off a dra
matic 4-3 victory over the New York Mcts,
feature the explosive bat of rightfielder Jack
Clark. Clark is notorious for slow starts, but in
1984 his .346 average and seven home runs
place him among the league's top five in both
categories.
Catcher Bob Brenly is the league's third
leading hitter, batting .357 before yesterday's
game. Centerfielder Chili Davis checks in at
.308 and future Hall-of-Famer Al Oliver has
been on a tear of late, raising his average
above the .280 mark.
The game will also be a family reunion, of
sorts. Ex-big leaguer Don Buford, now the
first base coach for the Giants, will be keeping
close tabs on his namesake, Don Buford, Jr.
The latter is a freshman infielder with the
Card.
The Giants, 14-22 against major league
competition, will be facing a Cardinal lineup
that boasts two new All-Pac-10 selections.
The conference's premier glove at shortstop,
John Verducci was named to the team along
with pitching ace John Radtke.
Verducci finished the year with a .954 field
ing percentage and chipped in with a .282
average at the plate. He and senior
centerfielder Darryl Stephens, an honorable
mention all-league pick this year, dazzled
spectators around the league with their spark
ling defense.
Another pretty fair defensive player.

second baseman Pete Stanicek, was also cho
sen to the honorable mention list. Stanicek led
Stanford in hits, runs and walks while setting a
new club record with 41 stolen bases.
Radtke's consistent) earned him post
season honors. The senior right hander was
consistently among the "Six-Pac" pitching
leaders in wins, earned run average and com
plete games. Radtke finished the year N-2

with a 2.N5 earned run average and lour com
plete games. He also walked only 24 hatters m
101 innings.
In other offensive categories, Mike
Deßenon topped the Card hitters with a .340
average. Rick Lundblade's 59 runs batted in
was the club's best and placed him in the
league's top five in that category. I.undblade
also finished the season tied with Stephens for

the team home-run leadership with seven
round-trippers.
Marquess expects to use all his horses
against the (iiants in the Card's last prep
he to re the NCAA tournament. Radtke is
today's prohahle starter and a number of dif
ferent hurlers will try their luck at stopping
Clark and company. Tickets are $4 tor adults
and $2 lor students and children.

the eve of today's exhibition game with
an Francisco Giants, the Stanford
iBLSCbaII team received an official invitation to
'HSNCAA Regionals, capping a late-season
toward the top of the Pacific-10 Confer-
Southern Division.
jSSJßntord hosted the Giants two vears ago
tfmFthe two clubs will square off for only the
second time today in a benefit game for the
Stanford baseball program. The contest
hjegins at 1 p.m. in Sunken Diamond, and if

to whether the NCAA selection would this
yfear, the first in which the NCAA has allowed
the selection of more than two teams from the
same conference, choose three teams from the
Pjac-10 Southern Division.

cfeated the confusion by finishing in a second
place tie behind No. 1-ranked Arizona State
in the "Six-Pac" final standings. Stanford
trailed the USC Trojans by four games mid
way through the conference season, but
rOared through the season's second half with
the best record in the conference to tie the
Trojans with an 18-12 mark. The Cardinal
finished with a 36-24-1 overall slate while
USC ended its season with a 44-21 record.
jThe six-man selection committee also an
nounced at-large invitations to six other
sqhools: Texas A&M, New Orleans, Univer
sity of Nevada-Las Vegas, Mississippi State,
Oklahoma and South Carolina.
Only three at-large berths remain open and
17 of the 25 automatic conference bids have
been determined. The conference champions
already slated to participate are as follows:
ASU, Texas, North Carolina, Appalachian
