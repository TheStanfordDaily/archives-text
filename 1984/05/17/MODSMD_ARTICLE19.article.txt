# Giants squeak past Mets

### 
San Francisco (AP) — The
S£jn Francisco Giants savored a
4-;3 win over the New York
Mets yesterday because of the
manner in which it was
achieved.
The Mets, who overcame 5-0
deficit to edge the Giants in 11
innings Tuesday night, entered
tlte bottom of the ninth with a 3-
l;lead behind Keith Hernan
dez's two runs-batted-in and
George Foster's solo homer.
-Right-hander Walt Terrell
retired the first two batters
before pinch-hitter Gene Ric
hards triggered a three-run rally
with a double down the left field
line. Chili Davis singled to cut
the Mets' lead to 3-2.
After A 1 Oliver sent Davis to
third with a single, Doug Sisk

replaced Terrell, 3-3. Jack
Clark's single produced a tie
and sent pinch-runner Joe Pitt
man to third. Jeff Leonard was
then safe on third baseman
Hubie Brooks' fielding error,
and Pittman scored the winning
run.
"It was a fairly easy play,"
Brooks said after the Mets lost
their first one-run decision of
the season. "The ball just didn't
come up, it went off my glove."
Giants' Manager Frank Rob
inson, however, didn't attach
any special significance to the
club's ninth comeback victory.
"One win doesn't help us," he
said. "We've got to put some
thing together. But it is nice to
beat the Mets after what they
did to us Tuesday."

The Mets had jumped in front
with two runs in the first. Wally
Backman opened with a lead
off double and Jose Oquendo
followed with a sacrifice. Back
man scored on Hernandez's
grounder to short and Foster
followed with his sixth homer of
the season.
The Giants nicked Terrell for
a run in the third when Davis
singled to right, went to second
on Oliver's ground out and
scored on Gark's single to cen
ter.
The Mets added a third run in
the eighth inning when
Oquendo walked with one out,
stole second and scored on Her
nandez's single.
Reliever Mark Davis, 1 -5, got
the victory for San Francisco.
