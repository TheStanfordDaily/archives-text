# Academy calls for Sakharov's release
## 
### 
Two Stanford scientists, saying
hunger strikes by Soviet physicist
Andrei Sakharov and his wife could
end in death within days, have joined
34 members of the National Academy
of Sciences in urging Soviet authorities
to allow the couple to seek medical
care in the country of their choice.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford l inear Accelerator Center
(SI.AC), and Paul I-lory, emeritus

professor of Chemistry, sent a
telegram Monday to Soviet leader
konstantin Chernenko as a "simple
humanitarian act."
"We are all scientists who have
been working to realize the unity ot
science around the world." according
to Flory. a Nobel laureate. "Surely
this is in the interest of all concerned.
We must keep trying. The worst thing
we can do is forget."
Meanwhile. University President
Donald Kennedy is "working on a let
ter" on the Sakhalin case in conjunc
tion with Drell and others, spokesman
Boh llnmrdla disclosed yesterday.
Hamrdla declined further comment,
and Drell. who is on sabbatical at Co
lumbia University in New York, was

unavailable for comment yesterday.
But as Western scientists intensified
efforts to resolve the Sakharov case in
the past week, it was revealed Monday
that Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner,
has launched her own hunger strike.
That fast is now in its fifth day, and
it is widely believed that Bonner, who
has suffered three heart attacks and
the loss of one eye, could die within
days. Previously, she had been
allowed to travel to Moscow and Italy
for treatment.
Three years ago, the couple went on
a hunger strike to persuade the Soviet
government to let Sakharov's
daughter, Yelizaveta Alekseyeva, join
her husband in the United States.
Drell and Flory met with officials at
the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco
then to help secure her immigration,
Sakharov and Bonner had to be hospi
talized after 17 days.
Bay Area government leaders have
also taken steps to resolve the Sak
harov case. Aides to Republican Rep.
Ed /.schau say he is "very concerned,"
and Democratic Rep. Tom Lantos, in
a statement Monday, said the
"civilized world is outraged" by the
"big lie" Soviet officials are telling
about the couple's health. Officials at
the Academy of Sciences Hospital in
Moscow say they are "unaware" ot
the hunger strike.
On Monday the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee joined the House
Foreign Relations Committee in ur
ging President Reagan to "call upon
the Soviet Union to meet the demands
of Dr. Sakharov's hunger strike."
The Sakharov case was reopened
last month, when dissident sources
disclosed that Bonner had been ar
rested for "defaming the Soviet sys
tem" and confined to the city of
Gorky, where her husband was exiled
four vears ago. Sakharov launched his
hunger strike two weeks ago. and
relatives in this country say it will end
onlv w hen Bonner is allowed abroad.
