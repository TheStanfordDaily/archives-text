### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Having won the NCAA Team Championship
luesday with a 6-0 victory over USC, six mem
bers of the Stanford women's tennis team begin
individual play in Los Angeles this morning in
search of another national championship.
Patty Fendick, the Cardinal's No. 1 player
during the season, heads the list of Stanford
entrants. Fendick is seeded third in the singles
competition behind Kathleen Cummings of Texas
and Gretchen Rush of Trinity.
She begins her quest for the national title with a
10 a.m. match against Cheryl Jones of USC, the
Trojans' No. 4 player. Tuesday, Jones dropped a
6-2, 7-6 decision to Leigh Anne Eldredge that
clinched the team championship for Stanford.
In doubles Fendick and Eldredge are seeded
No. 1 going into the 32-team competition. They
face Jane Forman and Jody Trucks of Clemson in
this afternoon's 4 p.m. match. The teams met Sat
urday in the first round of the team competition,
and Fendick and Eldredge registered a 6-3, 4-6,
6-4 decision in a meaningless match that closed
out the 9-0 victory for the Card.
Stanford's No. 2 player, Linda Gates, is seeded
right behind Fendick in singles at No. 4. Her first
round opponent is Marlin Noriega of Miami in an
N a.m. start.
Gates and her partner, Elise Burgin, were not
seeded in the doubles competiton despite having
been runners-up last year. As a result, the pair
will face Kelly Henry and Susan Pendo of USC —
the second-seeded duo — in this afternoon's
opening round.
Eldredge was seeded No. 9 in the individual
draw, and she will play Kim Clingan of Florida in
a 10 a.m. first-round match.
Kate Gompert was not seeded, despite having
played ahead of Eldredge all year at No. 3 and not
having lost a match during the Cardinal's dual
match season. As a result, she will face Beverly
Bowes of Texas, the No. 7 seed, in a first-round
match slated for S a.m.
Michelle Weiss is the fifth Stanford singles
player. She also was not seeded, and she will face
Tracy Hoffman of Indiana in an K a.m. opening
round match.

Gompert and Weiss are also unseeded in
doubles play. They will face Pam Jung and Akemi
Nishiya of Pepperdine in a 4 p.m. first-round con
test.
The second-round singles matches will also be
played this afternoon. Weiss is the only Stanford
player looking at a seeded second-round op
ponent — she will face the winner of the match
between No. 10-seeded Elizabeth Evans of Har
vard and USC's Heliane Steden should she get by
Hoffman.
The singles draw has worked to the advantage
of the Stanford players. Fendick, Gates, Eldredge
and Gompert are all in different brackets, which
means it is possible that all four will advance to
the semifinals Saturday. The only meeting of
Stanford players before then would come in the
third round, where Weiss would have to play
Gates.
In the doubles competition Fendick and
Eldredge are in the same bracket as Gompert and
Weiss, which means they could meet in the quar
terfinals. Burgin and Gates are in the other half,
though, so there could be an all-Stanford tinal
there as well.
In other news out of Los Angeles, Fendick was
named the Rookie of the Year in college tennis
by the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Associa
tion. Fendick posted a 30-5 record this season,
17-3 in dual matches, in becoming the Cardinal's
No. 1 player.
Gates was also honored by the ITCA, being
named winner of the Arthur Ashe Award for
sportsmanship, competitive excellence and ath
letic ability. Gates was 2N-7 this year, 18-5 in dual
matches.
The individual competition continues through
Sunday. In the 64-women singles bracket, the
third round and quarterfinals will be played to
morrow. with the semifinals slated tor Saturday
and the finals on Sunday. The 32-team doubles
competition will follow nearly the same schedule,
with the final also scheduled for Sunday at the Los
Angeles Tennis Center on the UCLA campus.
