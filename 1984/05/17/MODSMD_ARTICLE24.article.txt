## Spring Migration dramatic, innovative 
### KRISTEN BOYLES 
Yes Virginia, there is dance at Stanford
and judging from the Dance Division's per
lormance last week it is alive and thriving.
The final performance of Spring Migration
'84 was given on Saturday night to a packed
crowd in Rohlc Gym. If you missed it. kick
yourself hard and mark it on your calendar
for next year.
One ot the last ones to arrive. 1 found a
seat with mixed expectations. I had heard
that Spring Migration was good, hut I also
knew that the dance department at Stanford
was solid . . . not exceptional. To he blunt, I
was expecting an OK show. Fortunately. I
was wrong.
The show opened with ~Con-si-dera
tion. (from the Latin "to move with the
stars ) an airy, flowing piece. The twinkling
stars in the background at the beginning and
the posed dancers in shadowy half-light
opened the evening on a beautiful and
slightly magical note. "Ambiance,"
choreographed and performed by Kevin
Grant also sparkled. The powerful vet
graceful movements were surpassed only bv
the smile on Kevin's face. His joy in the
dance grabbed the audience and almost
pulled them to the stage.
Stacey Greenberg. choreographer and
one ot the dancers in "Ancient Whispers."
clet'"'t(«lv is to be congratulated. With

Veronique l ee. she put on the most unique
and captivating dance in the show. The
subtle but persistent music was a perfect
background for the dramatic and searching
moves of the two dancers. Dressed in bright
pink and blue with their dark hair pulled
back, they seemed to be two reflections of
the same person — intricately mimicking
and following each other. Immediately fol
lowing this superb number came
" R ice rear." choreographed and danced by
Lisa Stanley. Her clear still images were
tense with energy, and her hands moved
with incredible eloquence. The final posi
tion — balanced quiet and strong, staring
into the light — made me reach for my
camera (which of course. I hadn't brought.)
And just in case you were getting tired of
unitards. "Dance Now. Pay Later," opened
the second half ot the performance with
sparkle and excitement. The contrast be
tween the commotion and glitter of the car
nival and the noise and dirt of the war was
striking and well represented. Kitty
Donahue and Andrew Norris danced a
touching duet; Bruce Samuels as Harlequin
was well chosen as the focal point of the
entire dance — not only leading the other
dancers, but himself leaping (and I mean
leaping!) and twirling dramatically. The use
of slides was an interesting touch; they

added another visual dimension to the
entire piece.
Louisa Brodrecht also deserves a round
of applause as the wizard in I lie Tree of
Lite." And "For Friends" choreographed
by Jancy Limpert. with music by Vivaldi,
was an excellent ensemble piece tilled with
joy and lite. It was a good wax to end.
Someone told me once thai a good critic
always says at least one bad thing about a
performance. My one critical comment
really shouldn't be counted as a "bad
thing." In many of the pieces, the side
lighting was an excellent effect — the dan
cers able to flit in and out of the light and
shadow-filled stage seeming mistv and e
phemeral. However, you know what they say
about too much of a good thing. After a
while I wanted a change: I wanted to really
see the dancers' faces and bodies clearly.
There should have been more variance,
that's all.
Walking back to my dorm, I felt humbled.
I hadn't expected the level of technical ex
cellence I saw, the new and enchanting
choreography by both faculty and students,
or the quality of expression that went into
each piece. The dances had a powerful emo
tional impact — it's the joy of the dancers I
remember most. Stanford students aren't
just intellectuals, they can dance!
