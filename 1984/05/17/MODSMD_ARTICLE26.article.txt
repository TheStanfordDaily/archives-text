# Greg Kihn plays hard, hook-filled power-pop at Keystone
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
l ot me sol the scenario:
The Greg Kilin Band was
scheduled to put on a tree con
cert at Frost Amphitheatre on
campus. He was just on the
verge of his success with the
Roc Kill 11 Roll I.P (with the hit
single "The Break-up Song
(They Don't Write I m)") and
was noted tor performing in a
sort of Springsteen I'atti style
with a touch ot the Dave Clark
live thrown in (ves. I meant
that!). He had already been
around since the carls 1970s as
a Berkeley favorite and had
worked hard to develop a fine
hand and performing act. Over
all. he was a good-natured street
rocker who had an ever so slight
tendency to utilize some simple
pop-laden hooks and harmonies
in his songs. But hell, the
Beatles used to do that. So. 110
problem.
19N4 — After putting out
some rather disappointing al
bums. the Greg kihn Band
scored with the giant quasi
discofied hit. "Jeopardy." Sud
denly, the band found itself to
be very popular among
teenyboppers around the
country. Its music, although
hard-edged at times, was so
hook-filled that it was inevitable
that the pre-pubescents would
eventually catch 011 to it.
However, to push his new al
bum. Kihntagious, the band saw
fit to avoid a large arena and in
stead, decided to give a surprise
concert at the Keystone Palo
Alto (a club where the hand
started out in on its way up).
Inside the club was a crowd of
all ages (thank God), but up in
front on the dance floor were
huge numbers of teenyboppers
anxiously waiting for Greg Kihn
or puberty to appear, whichever
came first.
Never being an admirer of
any teenybopper hand
(exempting the Beatles and
Creedcncc, that is), I was not
too psyched on seeing a band
that now played for "kids." To
make matters worse, as the
band hit the stage, an uproar of
shrieks exploded out and the
band acknowledged these cries
by performing two songs that
even Barry Manilow would con
sider sappy. I instantly prepared
myself for a very disappointing
show.

I turned to express ni> dissat
isfaction to ;m oldet group of
eouples who were standing on
the dance Moor near me, As I
turned to them. I found them to
he in the midst ol intaking some
eocaine lines. I inched closer
with the devilish intent ot in
dulging myself sn as to get my
mind oil the teem hopper crap,
when suddenly. the lead
guitarist. dreg Douglas,
plunged into the third song.
"Tear That City Down." with a
searing guitar intro that totally
hroke the monotony. l-rom that
point on until the end til the
concert, the Cireg Kihn Band
played good time rock n' roll
with a passion and power that
made me glad to know that I had
come. I soon tound nnsell hop
ping and dancing with those
\er> teeny hoppers that I had
earlier dismissed. I hank
tnlly. it was they who had the
"taste" in the situation and it
the Greg Kihn Band is the type
of hand that these teem hoppers
saw lit to scream about then I
think I'll have to concede that
I've joined their ranks.
Well, all of the ahove is a
(hopefully) artistic viewpoint of
what happened last Saturday
night at the Keystone Palo Alto.
The Greg Kihn Band's 90-
minute-plus show was excel
lent (sans those first two songs
which just happened to he aw
ful), and one that re-affirmed
the belief in the power of good
music. Clean, hard playing via
the Stones: hook-filled, rollick
ing tunes via the Kinks: har
monies and 12-string guitars via
the Byrds; and stage dramatics
and mannerisms via
Springsteen, this hand has done
its homework properly. And
sure, they are a hit lightweight
but they easily make up for it
• live. Power-pop with a real
power.
The most important factor
playing in the band's favor is
its sense of roots. Its
never forgotten that all great
bands were once originally
"cover-bands," and thus, the
Greg Kihn Band, although it
features mostly original num
bers, still graciously sprinkles
its shows with numerous
cover tunes. On this occasion,
the band featured a collection of
remakes which ranged from the
Who's "The Kids Are Alright"

and the Yardbirds' "lor Your
Love" to Jackie Wilson's soul
classic "(Your l.o\e Keeps Lit
ting Me) Higher and Higher."
However, the two most
noteworthy (and most surpris
ing) remakes that night were the
Archie's "Sugar Sugar" and
Bob Maries's "Get 1 p Stand
Up." Just these two tunes depict
the extremely diverse influences
011 the band. However, both
songs were sung with a true
heartfelt passion and intensit
even with "Sugar Sugar' being
'60s buhblegum schlock (they,
however, had the wisdom to
play Wilson Pickett's driving
rendition of the song which is a
highly erotic version that gets
into the real meaning of such
simple lines as "You are my
candv girl And you know I'm
wanting you"). And no one
could ever claim "Get I'p Stand
Up" as teeny hopper music. In
fact, it is highly commendable
on Greg Kihn's part that he
does such an uncommercial,
politically minded song in the
presence of the teenagers who
buy the majority of his albums.
It not only shows that he cares
to do what he likes without
commercial considerations, but
it also shows him to he unafraid
to expand the somewhat naive
musical tastes of his young lis
teners as well.
As for his own original ma
terial. Kihn performed the finest
selections from his numerous al
bums (he has close to 10 now)
with emphasis 011 Roi Kilinßoll
and his latest I.P. The best mo
ments occurred when the hand
kicked in 011 its most catchy
and hypnotic songs.
The fact that they displayed
such high musicianship in all of
the above songs is again credit
to a fine band. That the
teeny hoppers have picked up on
this is credit to their sense of the
fun qualities of old time rock '11'
roll, a quality which us "older"
listeners occasionally forget in
our pursuits of "serious" music.
Remember there would never
have been a Lennon. Dylan or
Davies without "Dizzy Miss
Lizzie" and "Louie. Louie."
Just ask any teeny hopper (or
tambourine man for that mat
ter) and they'll tell you. As their
encore professed, these "kids
are alright" and so is the Greg
Kihn Band.


The Greg Kihn Band — Larry Lynch, Gary Phillips, Greg
Kihn, Greg Douglass, Steve Wright - made a surprise come-

back at the Keystone, proving that it hadn't lost its appeal to
all ages.
