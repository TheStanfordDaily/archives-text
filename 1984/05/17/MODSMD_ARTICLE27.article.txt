# West Bay's 'Falstaff' well-balanced, with great title role
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
Sung in English, West Bay Opera's production
o! Verdi s I alstatl affirms the company's good
sense of proportion between drama and music.
We understand more of the action (though musi
cally, English is awkward) in this farcical story
built around the Shakespearean character of
Fa I staff — an enormous, drunken and rather
bombastic knight. We also laugh harder when the
characters sputter profanities at each other.
Verdi s opera begins at the Garter Inn where
Sir John Falstaff and his disreputable cohorts,
Bardolph and Pistol, are arguing with the peevish
Dr. Cajus, who claims they robbed him. Later,
Falstaff sends love letters to Alice Ford and Meg
Page — two attractive and rich wives — courting
them for monetary and other favors.
The women receive the identical letters; they,
the Fords' daughter Nanetta and their friend
Mistress Quickly plot revenge on Falstaff. Mean
while, Bardolph and Pistol warn Ford of Falstaff s
intentions toward his wife. Separately, the women
send Quickly to invite Falstaff to rendezvous with
Alice; the men plan to introduce Ford under an
assumed name, as a man smitten by Alice but
unable to curry her favor.
Quickly delivers her message to a flattered
Falstaff. Ford, as "Brook," offers Falstaff a
handsome reward to conquer Alice. Falstaff
smugly tells him it is all arranged. Alone, the
jealous husband denounces the faithlessness of
women, lie rushes off in rage to interrupt
Falstaff s attempt at seducing Alice. The women
hide Falstaff in a huge laundry basket while Ford
searches the house. They hear a kiss behind the

screen, but discover that Nanetta is smooching
with her secret beloved, Fenton. ford, intending
her to marry Dr. Cajus, strides out in anger.
The women quickly dump the laundry basket
into the river, and when Ford returns he is just in
time to watch Falstaff s humiliation, and thereby
reconcile with his wife.
Hot wine restores Falstaffs confidence, and
Quickly again persuades him to meet Alice at
midnight in Windsor forest, wearing the horns of
the mythic Black Huntsman. The entire company
— dressed as fairies, elves and sprites — descend
upon a terrified Falstaff, thrashing him until he
recognizes Bardolph, his double-crossing buddy.
(The set for this scene showed a gnarled oak tree
against a dark blue night . . . with pinpoint lights
twinkling. Marvelous — the audience caught its
breath and applauded.)
The greatest flaw of the West Bay production
was the crowding in the forest scene, before
Verdi's fugue ends with Falstaffs ■"All the world's
a jest." The full ensemble simply stood there,
dressed in shimmering and colorful costumes. It
seems that some choreography could relieve this
static stage picture.
The acting and the voices, however, were well
balanced. The most stunning performer was Wal
ter Matthes in the title role. Matthes is a subtle
Falstaff, always keeping a sense of dignity about
him, even when he "wears the horns" in the end.
His voice, too, is most striking, with a boom and a
bellow as full as his belly.
As a whole, the opera is fine, and even more so
because all its members revel in character acting.
And it shows.


Walter Matthes plays Falstaff, flanked by the two alternating
Alice Fords, Barbara Reiter on the left, and Mary Canham on
the right, in West Bay Opera's production of Verdi's

"Falstaff," continuing today through Saturday at the Palo
Alto Cultural Center on Middlefield, off Embarcadero.
