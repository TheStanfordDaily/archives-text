### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
Sam Poole would have graduated
with the hi \s2. Thut is. it' he had
not died 1 1 : years ago when his hod\
rejected the transplanted heart lie
received at the Stanford Hospital.
Now. Poole's fraternity brothers at
Beta I lieta I'i have decided to sei up a
scholarship fund in tribute to their
friend.
" I his scholarship is for Sam and for
those who were touched by him." ac
cording to a statement issued In Dave
Thomson. Bill Barnard and Ted Rich
ards. Beta alumni who were close to
Poole. "But most o! all it is to encour
age and reward a financially needs
student possessing qualities which for
those arouikl him or her accentuate
the v allies of life."
In their statement. Thomson. Bar
nard and Richards describe Poole as
"a person who so touched the lives of
Ins Iriends that they now attempt to
raise money to endow a scholarship in
his name at Stanford University."
Poole entered Stanford after
graduating from Kent Preparatory

School in New Hngland. where he was
"diagnosed as suffering from .1 disease
which causes the fatal deterioration of
the muscles of the heart." Thomson
said.
During his stay at Stanford. Poole
received a heart transplant at the
Stanford Hospital. "So stronu was
Sam's will to live that he survived to
receive his new heart despite the fact
that the old one was so diseased that it
disintegrated in the hands o! the sur
geon." Richards said.
"It was Sam's honesty. Ins sensitiv
ity and his sense ol urgency that
touched those ol us who knew him.
Sam Poole had 110 time for facades.
llc broke dovv 11. vv itli honesty. the bar
riers that are often set up in personal
relationships." Richards said.
"Instead. Sam used the time that
had been loaned to him getting to
know people, bringing them out ol
their shells and helping them to reali/e
that they were worthwhile human
beings." Richards said.
Poole's mother. Victoria Poole, has
written a book about his life entitled
"Thursday s Child.'-' and Hallmark

produced a major motion picture,
titled the same, which is based on the
book.
Winter quarter, Barnard, chapter
adviser for the Betas, approached the
members of the Beta house to talk
about Poole and the scholarship and
to get the house involved in fund
raising. s;iul l lliott Sherr. resident as
sistant at the Beta house.
A minimum amount of $50.000 is
icquired to endow a University schol
arship, Sherr said. As the kickoff
event to their fund-raising efforts, the
Betas are sponsoring a showing of
Stripes, which was Poole's favorite
movie, at C'ubhcrley Auditorium Tues
day, Sherr said.
In addition, the Betas are
tentatively planning a special sales
campaign for "Thursday's Child,"
with profits to go to the scholarship
fund, and a possible nooner to raise
donations for the fund, Sherr said.
Starting in 1986, the Sam Poole
Memorial Scholarship will be awarded
annually to "a person who embodies
the same spirit, zest and determination
that characterized Sam," Sherr said.
