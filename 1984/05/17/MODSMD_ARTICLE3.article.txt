## Approves Sakharov resolution 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
Expressing concern for the* health of
Soviet dissidents Andrei Sakharox and
his wife Yelena Bonner, who are cur
rently on hunger strikes, the ASSU
Senate-elect voted unanimously last
night to send telegrams to Soviet offi
cials.
I he senate-elect resolved to send
messages to the Soviet Consulate in
San Francisco and to Soxiet leader
Konstantin Chernenko urging the So
viet Union to facilitate "medical care
essential to the well-being of. . . these
outstanding Soviet humanitar
ians
In a closed session, the senate-elect
also selected Barry "8.G." Porter
oxer Mark Sohle as its deputy chair. In a
prepared statement. Porter said he
will concentrate on efficiency and seek
"a comfortable working relationship
with my colleagues."
Porter also stressed the importance
of maintaining smooth working
relationships between different
branches of the ASSU.
Porter's election was followed by
the discussion of the Sakharox resolu
tion, which was approved in an un
precedented action by a senate-elect.
Sakharox . inventor of the Soviet hy
drogen bomb, is internationally
respected for his academic achieve

peace. He was exiled to the Soviet city
of Gorky four years ago for dissident

hunger strikes to protest Bonner's
recent arrest for treason. "I! action
isn't taken immediately, both Sak
harov and Bonner will die. There's no
time to lose," he said.
The resolution also states that the
senate-elect would welcome the So

director of the Stanford I inear Ac
celerator Center and co-director ol
the Center for International Security
and Arms Control, has already ex
tended such invitations to the dissi

Before passing the resolution, the
newly elected senators debated issues
such as the limited authority of the
senate-elect and the right ot senators
to make statements for the student
body.
"I feel very strongly that this body
has no authority at all," said veteran
senator Jim McCirath. "We're not the
senate and we don't speak for the stu
dent body .... We don't really have
any authority at all." The senate-elect
does not replace the current senate of
ficially until May
But other members countered that
the senate-elect did not need authontv
to send the telegrams.
"This resolution is a statement; u">
not the law." said senator-elect Mark
