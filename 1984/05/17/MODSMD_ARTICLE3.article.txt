# ASSU Senate-elect breaks precedent
## Approves Sakharov resolution 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
Expressing concern for the* health of
Soviet dissidents Andrei Sakharox and
his wife Yelena Bonner, who are cur
rently on hunger strikes, the ASSU
Senate-elect voted unanimously last
night to send telegrams to Soviet offi
cials.
I he senate-elect resolved to send
messages to the Soviet Consulate in
San Francisco and to Soxiet leader
Konstantin Chernenko urging the So
viet Union to facilitate "medical care
essential to the well-being of. . . these
outstanding Soviet humanitar
ians
In a closed session, the senate-elect
also selected Barry "8.G." Porter
oxer Mark Sohle as its deputy chair. In a
prepared statement. Porter said he
will concentrate on efficiency and seek
"a comfortable working relationship
with my colleagues."
Porter also stressed the importance
of maintaining smooth working
relationships between different
branches of the ASSU.
Porter's election was followed by
the discussion of the Sakharox resolu
tion, which was approved in an un
precedented action by a senate-elect.
Sakharox . inventor of the Soviet hy
drogen bomb, is internationally
respected for his academic achieve
ments and efforts in promoting world
peace. He was exiled to the Soviet city
of Gorky four years ago for dissident
activities.
Sophomore Troy Eid, who pro
posed during an open forum at the

start ot the meeting that the senate
elect send the telegrams, said the lives
ot Sakharov and Bonner are in danger
because they have both launched
hunger strikes to protest Bonner's
recent arrest for treason. "I! action
isn't taken immediately, both Sak
harov and Bonner will die. There's no
time to lose," he said.
The resolution also states that the
senate-elect would welcome the So
viet couple to become faculty mem
bers at Stanford. Sidney Drell, deputy
director of the Stanford I inear Ac
celerator Center and co-director ol
the Center for International Security
and Arms Control, has already ex
tended such invitations to the dissi
dents.
Before passing the resolution, the
newly elected senators debated issues
such as the limited authority of the
senate-elect and the right ot senators
to make statements for the student
body.
"I feel very strongly that this body
has no authority at all," said veteran
senator Jim McCirath. "We're not the
senate and we don't speak for the stu
dent body .... We don't really have
any authority at all." The senate-elect
does not replace the current senate of
ficially until May
But other members countered that
the senate-elect did not need authontv
to send the telegrams.
"This resolution is a statement; u">
not the law." said senator-elect Mark
Landesmann. He added that the ur
gent nature of the resolution
prevented action by the current sen
ate, which doesn't reconvene until
next week. "We're the best represen
tatives at this point." he said.
Several members questioned the
authority of senators to make state
ments on purporting to represent the
views of the student body, but
Council-of-Presidents member Su

Uhland, a graduate senator-elect, said
the senate plays a role as the "official
mouthpiece" of the student body.
The senators-elect differed in their
views of the nature of the resolution.
Veteran senator Soble asserted that
the measure was not a political state
ment. "This is an academic offer and a
question that he (Hid) considers to be
nonpartisan."
Council-of-Presidents member
elect Alice Wells called the resolution
a "symbolic gesture."
But Landesmann pointed out after

the meeting that the measure may
have more than a symbolic signifi
cance because ol the negative
publicity that the Soviet Union would
receive in the event that the dissidents
die.
"It's not crazy," he added.
"Stanford has strong ties with Sak
harov and is highly respected interna
tionally as a university. The fact that
the senate (-elect) makes a statement
is probably going to have an impact on
how Soviet decision-makers make
their decision."
