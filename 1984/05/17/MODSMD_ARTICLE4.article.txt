# Democratic candidates may speak here
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer 
As the polls closed Tuesday in Oregon and
Nebraska, Democratic presidential candidates
turned their attention to California in anticipa
tion of the June 5 primary here.
College campuses will figure prominently as
campaigning sites for the upcoming primary,
and Stanford will he no exception. According to
Eric Diesel of the Mondale campaign, Mondale
will be in the Bay Area prior to June 5 and "a
lot of people high up in the campaign want him
to come here."
And according to Kevin Sweeney, California
press secretary for the Hart campaign, there is a
definite possibility that Hart may come to Stan
ford to speak. "We want Hart to speak at Stan
ford," but whether or not that wish will come
true will depend on several things including
"what happens in New Jersey (which has a pri
mary the same day)."
"We know what issues we want to stress,"
but Hart's schedule is "absolutely tentative,"
Sweeney added. Campus sources suggest a May
30 or May 31 visit is possible.
The chance of the Rev. Jesse Jackson coming
to campus are slim, according to Keith Ar
chuleta, a member of Stanford for a Rainbow
Coalition. "He'll probably come to East Palo
Alto on June 1," Archuleta said. "We have a
plan so that if he comes to campus we'll hold
the event in Frost."
Although campuses have been important,
Jackson has focused more on the community,
Archuleta said.
Rick Roby of the Hart campaign noted
Hart's particular appeal among students. "Hart
stirs a lot of support among students. . . . when
he spoke here last year he was overwhelmingly
received," he said.
However, scheduling conflicts may detract
from potential Hart support this year, Roby
said. "1 think more students will want to get in
volved. but because the primary is right at the
end of classes it may make it hard for students
to net involved."

All the groups have been active on campus as
well as in the 12th Congressional District of
which Stanford is a part. According to Robv,
"We probably have 25 students who have
worked to contact voters and get out the vote
for Hart .... There are about 35 to 40 more
who serve as dorm contacts to pass out
literature and who were doing voter registra
tion."
"We'll he setting up a table in White Plaza to
recruit people and hand out information."
which is an ongoing event, he added.
The Jackson group concentrated its begin
ning efforts on education and voter registration,
according to Archuleta. "Now we're working
on getting out the vote in the 12th precinct."
Three students here are also serving as Jackson
delegates and have been active in speaking at

different events around campus.
The group has a membership list of about 60
people who have helped with everything from
canvassing to distributing literature on campus.
"We have a core group of about 20 people, 10
people who are dorm representatives and who
helped register voters, and another 10 who are
the planning committee members." he said.
The Mondale campaign has a "strong organi
zation for the entire 12th District" and about
15 people who are active on campus, according
to Diesel.
"The main thing we'll be doing on campus is
distributing literature," he said. "Essentially
Mondale has won almost everywhere.. . . Hart
has won a couple of states but they are insigniti-

cant in terms of delegates." he added.
"The main thing out of the ordinary
that will be happening is ;i debate on
K/.SU," Diesel said. Representatives
for each of the candidates will debate
on May 31 and the event will be
broadcast on June I and June 4. the
day before the primary.
The likelihood of the candidates
themselves debating on campus seems
slim, according to Archuleta.
