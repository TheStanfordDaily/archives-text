## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Bill Baird. known to some as the
"lather of the abortion movement."
spoke against the "right to life" move
ment last evening, ealling it an attempt
by men to assert control over women.
Speaking on "The Politics of God.
Government and Sex: Why Abortion
and Birth Control Must Remain Le
gal." Baird told about 75 students
gathered in Branner's main lounge
that leaders and financial backers of
the anti-abortion movement are
primarily men.
"It President Reagan, the Re\. Jerry
I alwell. the Pope and the bishops ot
the Catholic Church all stopped their
efforts, the anti-abortion movement
would fall Hat on its face." Baird said.
"It we can keep you women
barefoot and pregnant, we'll keep you
out of the labor market and control
you." he said. "Believe me. there are a
lot of men who still want to do that."
Baird said birth control research

is primarily practiced by men. and
criticized the lack of progress in birth
control lor men.
Jailed eight times in fi\e states.
Baird was at one time sentenced to
three months in jail for handing a girl
a package of spermicide.
"If I could just tell you the amount
of hatred coming from this anti
abortion side in the name of God." he
said. According to Baird. a man en
tered one of his abortion clinics, threw
gasoline on patients and then threw a
torch inside, lighting the clinic on tire.
He also said he was forced to sepa
rate from his wile and daughter be
cause of death threats.
Baird spoke on current methods ol
birth control, the morality of the anti
abortion movement, arid his own ex
periences in lighting lor the legaliza
tion of birth control and abortion.
"Is it mv right to tell you not to have
intercourse? It you believe in a system
of individual lights, individual respon
sibilities and individual freedoms, you

must have that choice," he said.
Baird said that in most countries
around the world fertilized eggs arc
not recognized as people.
"We give you a birth certificate, not
a conception certificate," he said.
"You can't ask the IKS for a tax
deduction because of a fetus. It a Ictus
is a person, and you need a passport,
how will you take a picture?"
Baird told students about anti
abortion hills now before Congress.
The power behind these bills is. accor
ding to Baird, the fault of Reagan.
"You have a president who has built
a strong coalition of reactionaries like
Jerry 112 alwell, saying God is on oui
side.* " he said. "Along with the Cath
olic Church, they have some very pow
erful propaganda tools."
Baird addressed critics in the audi
ence. saying the poor would be the
ones to suffer from anti-abortion ef
forts.
