Warplanes fire on Saudi tanker
Manama, Bahrain — Warplanes fired on a Saudi oil tanker
yesterday, the latest of five tanker attacks since April 25 that
have threatened Persian Ciult oil traffic and sent shipping in
surance premiums soaring.
rhree Saudi tankers and two Kuwaiti ships have been
crippled by missile fire in the gulf. The first two Saudi ships
were hit by warplanes from Iraq — which has been waging a
war with Iran tor three years. Kuwait blames Iran for the at
tacks on its ships.
1 he planes that hit the 212,000-ton Saudi-registered
Yanbu Pride in Saudi territorial waters yesterday have not
been identified, but State Department officials in Washington
said it had "pretty good evidence" Iranian aircraft were re
sponsible.
In response to the latest attack, in gulf waters off the east
ern Saudi coast, the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council
quickly scheduled a foreign ministers' meeting for today in
Riyadh to consider combined action to protect gulf naviga
tion.
The member nations are Saudi Arabia. Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates. Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
Even before yesterday's attack, Iran repeated its warning
that it will paralyze all oil traffic in the Persian Gulf if contin
ued attacks by Iraq deny access to its Kharg Island terminal.
I he United States has repeatedly stated its commitment to
keeping open the Strait of Hormuz in the gulf, through which
(lows nearly 20 percent of the oil for the non-communist
world.
Israelis raid Palestinian camp
Beirut. Ix'banon — Israeli troops swept through a Palestinian
refugee camp on the edge ot the port city of Sidon yesterday,
seizing weapons and blowing up a number of homes, reports
reaching the Lebanese capital said.
Residents of the camp told reporters that about 150 people
had been arrested by the Israelis and at least 20 others were
injured.
The sweep through the Ain Helweh camp came a day after
Beirut newspapers reported an anti-Israel demonstration
there and marked the first time in months that Israeli troops
had carried out a major operation aimed at one of the Pales
tinian ghettos that once was a center of guerrilla activity.
About 26,000 Palestinians are registered as residents of the
camp by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which looks
after the interests of the Palestinians in Lebanon. Sidon is
about 25 miles south of here and lies at the northern edge of
the Israeli occupation zone.
Reports on what actually happened varied, but most
sources agreed that Israeli forces with tanks and other
armored vehicles surrounded the camp late Tuesday and
began the sweep shortly after midnight.
Israeli military sources reached in Tel Aviv by the Associ
ated Press, speaking on condition that they would not be
identified, acknowledged that Israeli troops had entered the
camp to carry out "searches and actions meant to prevent ter
rorist actions."
German work strike spreads
Hamburg, West Germany — A strike by West German
metalworkers for a 35-hour work week appeared to be on the
verge of escalating dramatically yesterday with some 32,000
workers at a huge Mercede,s-Benz plant poised to join in.
An estimated 13,000 workers in the key automobile and
engineering industries began the strike Monday. The Stutt
gart branch of the strikers' union IG Metall announced yes
terday it planned for workers at the major Mercedes plant in
Sindelfingen. near Stuttgart, to join the stoppage beginning at
midnight yesterday.
It was not clear, however, whether this would happen, as
the national leadership of 1G Metall ended a meeting later
yesterday without approving the move. The Frankfurt-based
national leadership, in theory at least, must approve all strike
action.
Earlier yesterday, however, about 12,000 of the Sindelfin
gen workforce downed their tools after local officials told
them: "We're taking the initiative. Go back into the plant,
pack your overalls and go home."
Daimler Benz had already warned that the Sindelfingen
plant would have to shut down in the next couple of days for
lack of parts, while the Stuttgart sports car maker Porsche
said it had supplies that would last only to tommorrow.
Deficit reduction plan clears
major congressional hurdle
Washington — The "down payment" deficit-reduction plan
favored bv President Reagan cleared a major hurdle last night
as the Republican-controlled Senate broke an impasse over
domestic spending and agreed to add $2 billion next year for
education, health research and environmental protection.
The 62-37 vote, largely along party lines, appeared to clear
tbd way for passage of the entire package by the end of the
.tveek, nearly a month after the Senate began debate on it.
Although Democratic critics complained that the compro
mise was a "flimflam" to buy off wavering Republicans and to
camouflage an increase in deficits, they agreed that its pas
sage would assure Senate approval of the Reagan-backed
plan.
West European leaders are expected to pressure President
Reagan at next month's economic summit for a major reduc
tion in the U.S. budget deficit because they fear the deficit
could wreck Europe's fragile economic recovery and trigger a
worldwide financial crisis.
According to Western diplomats, the brewing controversy
is likely to transform the June 7 summit from a campaign
year media event into a sharp criticism of Reagan's economic
policies.
Housing construction soars
Washington — Housing construction, rebounding from its
sharpest monthly downturn in history, soared by 19.3 percent
in April, but analysts cautioned yesterday that rising interest
rates will soon dampen activity.
The Commerce Department said construction starts for
new homes and apartments surged to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.96 million units last month, marking the
strongest improvement since a 26 percent rise in January
19K3.
Last month's increase followed a record 27.3 percent
decline in housing starts in March, which was blamed mostly
on unusually severe weather which hampered builders.
Bad weather, in fact, has been blamed for much of the
March slowdown in economic activity. Government surveys
indicate that the economy took off again in April, causing
many analysts to raise their estimates of the pace of economic
growth in the April-June quarter.
In a separate report yesterday, the government said fac
tories. mines and utilities operated at 81.9 percent of capacity
in April, or 12.3 percentage points above the low point of the
I 9KI-N2 recession.
Stocks post moderate gains
New York — The stock market held on to post a modest
gain yesterday in moderate trading, as the second of two rally
efforts faded in the session's final hour.
The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which had
slipped 16.33 points over the past three sessions, edged up
2.30 points to 1153.16.

Last month's increase followed a record 27.3 percent
decline in housing starts in March, which was blamed mostly
on unusually severe weather which hampered builders.
Bad weather, in fact, has been blamed for much of the
March slowdown in economic activity. Government surveys
indicate that the economy took off again in April, causing
many analysts to raise their estimates of the pace of economic
growth in the April-June quarter.
In a separate report yesterday, the government said fac
tories. mines and utilities operated at 81.9 percent of capacity
in April, or 12.3 percentage points above the low point of the

Warplanes fire on Saudi tanker
Manama, Bahrain — Warplanes fired on a Saudi oil tanker
yesterday, the latest of five tanker attacks since April 25 that
have threatened Persian Ciult oil traffic and sent shipping in
surance premiums soaring.
rhree Saudi tankers and two Kuwaiti ships have been
crippled by missile fire in the gulf. The first two Saudi ships
were hit by warplanes from Iraq — which has been waging a
war with Iran tor three years. Kuwait blames Iran for the at
tacks on its ships.
1 he planes that hit the 212,000-ton Saudi-registered
Yanbu Pride in Saudi territorial waters yesterday have not
been identified, but State Department officials in Washington
said it had "pretty good evidence" Iranian aircraft were re
sponsible.
In response to the latest attack, in gulf waters off the east
ern Saudi coast, the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council
quickly scheduled a foreign ministers' meeting for today in
Riyadh to consider combined action to protect gulf naviga
tion.
The member nations are Saudi Arabia. Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates. Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
Even before yesterday's attack, Iran repeated its warning
that it will paralyze all oil traffic in the Persian Gulf if contin
ued attacks by Iraq deny access to its Kharg Island terminal.
I he United States has repeatedly stated its commitment to
keeping open the Strait of Hormuz in the gulf, through which
(lows nearly 20 percent of the oil for the non-communist
world.
Israelis raid Palestinian camp
Beirut. Ix'banon — Israeli troops swept through a Palestinian
refugee camp on the edge ot the port city of Sidon yesterday,
seizing weapons and blowing up a number of homes, reports
reaching the Lebanese capital said.
Residents of the camp told reporters that about 150 people
had been arrested by the Israelis and at least 20 others were
injured.
The sweep through the Ain Helweh camp came a day after
Beirut newspapers reported an anti-Israel demonstration
there and marked the first time in months that Israeli troops
had carried out a major operation aimed at one of the Pales
tinian ghettos that once was a center of guerrilla activity.
About 26,000 Palestinians are registered as residents of the
camp by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which looks
after the interests of the Palestinians in Lebanon. Sidon is
about 25 miles south of here and lies at the northern edge of
the Israeli occupation zone.
Reports on what actually happened varied, but most
sources agreed that Israeli forces with tanks and other
armored vehicles surrounded the camp late Tuesday and
began the sweep shortly after midnight.
Israeli military sources reached in Tel Aviv by the Associ
ated Press, speaking on condition that they would not be
identified, acknowledged that Israeli troops had entered the
camp to carry out "searches and actions meant to prevent ter
rorist actions."
German work strike spreads
Hamburg, West Germany — A strike by West German
metalworkers for a 35-hour work week appeared to be on the
verge of escalating dramatically yesterday with some 32,000
workers at a huge Mercede,s-Benz plant poised to join in.
An estimated 13,000 workers in the key automobile and
engineering industries began the strike Monday. The Stutt
gart branch of the strikers' union IG Metall announced yes
terday it planned for workers at the major Mercedes plant in
Sindelfingen. near Stuttgart, to join the stoppage beginning at
midnight yesterday.
It was not clear, however, whether this would happen, as
the national leadership of 1G Metall ended a meeting later
yesterday without approving the move. The Frankfurt-based
national leadership, in theory at least, must approve all strike
action.
Earlier yesterday, however, about 12,000 of the Sindelfin
gen workforce downed their tools after local officials told
them: "We're taking the initiative. Go back into the plant,
pack your overalls and go home."
Daimler Benz had already warned that the Sindelfingen
plant would have to shut down in the next couple of days for
lack of parts, while the Stuttgart sports car maker Porsche
said it had supplies that would last only to tommorrow.
Deficit reduction plan clears
major congressional hurdle
Washington — The "down payment" deficit-reduction plan
favored bv President Reagan cleared a major hurdle last night
as the Republican-controlled Senate broke an impasse over
domestic spending and agreed to add $2 billion next year for
education, health research and environmental protection.
The 62-37 vote, largely along party lines, appeared to clear
tbd way for passage of the entire package by the end of the
.tveek, nearly a month after the Senate began debate on it.
Although Democratic critics complained that the compro
mise was a "flimflam" to buy off wavering Republicans and to
camouflage an increase in deficits, they agreed that its pas
sage would assure Senate approval of the Reagan-backed
plan.
West European leaders are expected to pressure President
Reagan at next month's economic summit for a major reduc
tion in the U.S. budget deficit because they fear the deficit
could wreck Europe's fragile economic recovery and trigger a
worldwide financial crisis.
According to Western diplomats, the brewing controversy
is likely to transform the June 7 summit from a campaign
year media event into a sharp criticism of Reagan's economic
policies.
Housing construction soars
Washington — Housing construction, rebounding from its
sharpest monthly downturn in history, soared by 19.3 percent
in April, but analysts cautioned yesterday that rising interest
rates will soon dampen activity.
The Commerce Department said construction starts for
new homes and apartments surged to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.96 million units last month, marking the
strongest improvement since a 26 percent rise in January
19K3.
