Washington (AP) — The House approved
List night a compromise which would allow production
of only 15 of the 40 M\ missiles which President
Reagan wanted in IIJNSl l JN5 — and then only il the Soviet
Union fails to return to arms talks hv next April.
The compromise, engineered hv Rep. Les Aspin (I)-
Wis.). was first adopted hv voice vote after Republican
leaders conceded the president risked losing all funds
for the MX if they pressed for more.
Moments after that unrecorded vote. Democratic
leaders failed hv just six votes. 21N-212. on a move to
scrap the entire MX program. Then the compromise
was affirmed. 229-199.
Some 146 Republicans joined 72 Democrats in
blocking elimination ot the MX. while 194 Democrats
and IS Republicans supported it. Last year, a similar
effort failed by nine votes.
Reagan's Democratic rivals, former Vice President
Walter Mondale and Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, had
pressed members of the House earlier in the day to
delete all MX funds for the next fiscal year.
But Aspin succeeded in pre-empting the critical first
vote for his own proposal, and carried the day. Though
the White House had initially pressed Republicans to
resist any cuts in the MX. the centerpiece of Reagan's
strategic buildup, they climbed aboard after Minority
Leader Robert Michel (R-lll.) bluntly told the presi
dent that the deal offered by Aspin, a liberal Democrat
w ho has helped bail out the MX in previous years, was
the best he could get.

"We are pleased to hear that the House has voted to
provide funding for the continued development and
production of the Peacckeepei missile." Kim Hoggard.

Aspin said. "That's no sure-fire situation."
Aspin said his amendment, co-sponsored by Rep.
Joel Pritchard (R-Wash.). may eventually mean that no
MX missiles will be deployed, depending on the
Soviets. It does nothing to delay production and sched
uled 1956 deployment ot the first 21 missiles author
ized last year.
Reagan wants eventual deployment ol 100 ot the
missiles, in existing Minutcman silos m Wyoming and
Nebraska, unless he wins strategic concessions from
Moscow.
Earlier. Michel emerged from a meeting with the
president to say. "Well, we'll live with it (the Aspin
amendment) for the time being. We would obviously
hope to do somewhat better" when the issue goes to a
House-Senate conference later in the year.
Asked if Reagan had endorsed the Aspin compro

Speaker Thomas " lip" O'Neill ol Massachusetts,
xvhoonce was confident that the House would reject all
M\ t'umis. conceded he lost some votes "because of
conversations with the president" oxer the previous 24
hours.
O'Neill, on lucsdax. declared he had 220 votes —
two more than necessary — to kill the production tunds

Reagan continued to press his case v\ ith meetings and
telephone conversations with congressman virtually to
the last minute. Mondale and Hart, meanwhile, teamed
up with a letter to evcr> memher of the House,
pronouncing the strategic nuclear weapon dangerous
and vulnerable" and asking that all lunds lor it he
eliminated.
The showdown vote in the House loomed as just one
of several congressional decisions this xear on the new
missile, which Reagan portraxs as an essential bargain
ing chip to lure the Soviet Union back to arms control
talks. Critics sax that argument has been discredited be
cause the M\ program didn't keep the Soviets from
walking axvax from the bargaining table last year.
The issue was debated at length on the House floor.
"The Russians will be thrilled it we give up the MX."
said Rep. Henry llxde (R-lll). ". . . But I sure won't.
O'Neill said that "with everything we have out
there" in strategic weapons. "I don't think there is a
"window of x ulnerabilitx.' And I don't think the presi
dent is acting in such a manner to bring us to the table."
