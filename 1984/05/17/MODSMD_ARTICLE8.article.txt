# Judge places ban on genetic experiments
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” A
federal judge yesterday ordered
a temporary prohibition on
planned outdoor experiments in
California with genetically al
tered organisms intended to
delay the formation of frost on
potato plants.
The judge's order also
suspends two other field experi
ments scheduled this summer
with corn, tomato and tobacco
plants which were approved by
the National Institutes of
Health.
U.S. District Judge John
Sirica, in issuing the preliminary

injunction, said he was not
questioning "the wisdom or
qualifications ol the eminent
scientists who have labored to
insure that this new technology
is used in a responsible manner.
"The issues that this court
must confront are narrow, legal
questions," Sirica said in a 38-
page opinion. "Accordingly,
while speculation on the possi
ble benefits and hazards pre
sented by the emerging technol
ogy of genetic engineering may
intrigue the parties to this litiga
tion. the court has no desire, au
thority or competence to spec

ulate."
lie said he was issuing the in
junction so that the court can
learn, on its merits, il the Na
tional Institutes of Health took
the necessary steps to ensure
safety.
Opponents of genetic engi
neering as well as environmen
talists were concerned about the
safety of microbe experiments
planned to begin about May 25.
Researchers at UC-Berkeley,
who say the experiments pose
no environmental threat, want
to spray a new bacteria on a

potato patch at the Tulelake
Agriculture lest Station to see
it the microbe will prevent or
delay frost formation.
The experiments, which were
delayed from last fall because of
the threat of court action, would
represent the first time geneti
cally engineered organisms were
released in the open environ
ment.
In arguments before Sirica,
attorneys for the Nil I and the
researchers said the work is
safe. Lawyers for the Founda
tion of Economic Trends, a

public interest science group,
said it poses ;i potential threat to
nature and presents the remote
possibility ol altering climates it
the Irost-delay bacteria gets
loose.
Jermy Rilkin. a writer and
longtime foe ol genetic engi
neering who instigated the suit,
said he was "pleasantly
pleased" with the decision. "He
granted all we asked." said Ril
kin.
"I hope the decision w ill open
up a national debate 011 how to
proceed with the bio-tech age."
he said.
