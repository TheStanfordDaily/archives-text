## Faculty considers Third World campuses 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
I he Faculty Senate discussed the
possibility ot increasing opportunities
tor overseas study in Third World
countries and expanding the role ot
Stanford taculty on overseas campuses
at yesterday's meeting.
Sociology Prof. Alex Inkeles, a
Hoover Institution Senior Research
Fellow and chairman of an ad hoc
committee on overseas studies pro
grams, outlined the group's 84-page
report The report recommended that
" tlie location of centers he made less
Euro-centric" and that high priority
he given to the consideration of
opening centers ot study in Asia.
Africa and Latin America.
Pointing out that the University has
two overseas programs in German
speaking countries and two in France,
Inkeles suggested that the University
look into consolidating the programs.
••We did not suggest it would he
necessary to close a European campus
in order to open a campus elsewhere,"
Inkeles said, "hut we wanted to focus
on redundancy and the associated
problems of cost."
Bruce Parker, professor of radiol
ogy and pediatrics, agreed that
••consideration should he given to new
campuses in Atrica, Asia and Latin
America." hut added that "demand
must he clearly demonstrated.

Anthropology Prof. James Ciihhs
said the increasing numbers of black
and ( hicano students at Stanford may
have resulted in a "larger clientele"
than previously existed for programs
in the Third World.
While the creation of new centers
may not be necessary, Ciihhs said,
"Whatever resources we can place
should be expanded to create a bal
ance of opportunities in all three Third
World areas."
Parker, chairman of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies
voiced concern over the recommen
dations by the ad hoc committee on
overseas studies that more Stanford
faculty members be sent to teach over
seas.
Comparing Stanford professors with
faculty recruited overseas, the ad hoc
committee reported that because posi
tions on Stanford's faculty are ex
tremely competitive, there is likely to
be "a higher level of scholarly attain
ment, on average, in the University
faculty." -
The report also said Stanford pro
fessors "are obviously more likely to

Mancall said the costs ol sending a
professor overseas include travel ex

housing costs and food subsidies in
countries where the cost ol living
exceeds that ol the I'nitcd States.
Associate English Prof. John
Bender said. "II we feel we can't af

think of shrinking the program, not
expanding it."
Hut l.avv School Prof. John Mer

importance to having Stanford faculty
overseas." He added that one ol the
program's goals is to expose students

Merryman also \oiced concern ih.it
students overseas can become isolated

in the villa which Stanford leases
there.
The ad hoc committee also recom
mended that students be required to
pass a language competency test
before qualifying for the overseas pro
gram rather than completing a set
number of units.
Mancall concurred with the com

language competency on the part ol
many Stanford students is "woefully
inadequate." lie said he linds that
"there has been a slippage in the lan
