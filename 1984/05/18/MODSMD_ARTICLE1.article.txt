said the increasing numbers of black
and ( hicano students at Stanford may
have resulted in a "larger clientele"
than previously existed for programs
in the Third World.

tremely competitive, there is likely to
be "a higher level of scholarly attain
ment, on average, in the University
faculty." -

fessors "are obviously more likely to
offer instruction abroad which can he
integrated with the programs of de
