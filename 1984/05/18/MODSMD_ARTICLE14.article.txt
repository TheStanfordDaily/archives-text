# A 						matter of self-confidence

It is Prot. Martin Esslin's view that Stanford students are
unable to realistically assess themselves, and that this
shortcoming in sell-awareness results in the development
ot sissies — hypochondriacs ol the psyche who are
trapped In self-pity. His view is certainly overgenerali/ed.
and the relationship between his observations is ha/y. Still,
hsslin does highlight the importance of realistic self
contidence and courage. Ihe development ol these
qualities, combined with the e\ olution of autonomous per
sonality. is critical in students' growth both in college and
beyond.
It all ot history can be viewed in the context of courage.

Talented, intelligent, strong
students possess the im
mense capacity to either
direct their own lives, and
those of others, or to rely on
those capabilities to coast
along easy, safe paths.

with event* being decided by the valor and nerve ot their
participants, then Stanford can similarly he viewed as an
arena where controlled boldness and self-reliance are the
principal engines of students' personal success. Current
campus controversies can be \ iewed in this context; results
are determined by the opposing forces of secure
rationalization and reasoned daring.
Talented, intelligent, strong students possess the im
mense capacity to either direct their own lives, and those
ot others, or to rely on those capabilities to coast along
easy, safe paths. It is possible for any talented individual to
restrict himself to secure social, academic and professional
paths which will be satisfying and comfortable, or instead
to accept the challenge of taking risks and developing an
autonomous personality. Thus, campus issues are viewed

more clearly it analyzed in terms ot these two groups of
people, rather than as issues involving one generalized
mass.
l or instance, the controversial issue ot fraternitv
housing is otten discussed in general, extreme terms. In
stead. it should be considered that the survival of fraterni
ties is essential to creative, courageous individuals who
challenge the limits of the fraternities" status quo by usinu
the group's power to benefit personally or better the com
munity. Conversely, fraternities" continued existence is
detrimental to individuals in the former group who refuse
to stand out and go beyond the groups' imposed bound
aries. This person is used, unchallenged and stunted by
living in a closed, restrictive environment which is sadly
self-imposed. Fraternity housing is not a clear-cut issue,
because the power of the fraternity concept can be
manifested both positively and negative!) depending on
the individual. It is clear, however, that the worthwhile ex
perience is accorded to those who are bold enough to
break through and pursue new, perhaps controversial per
sonal goals. The member who wallows in indecision and
temerity is often consumed by the group, rolling along
comfortably, but pointlessly.
The same logic can be applied to the comple issue of
theme houses (be they cultural or political). These
residences produce two types of individuals, and it is
courage which distinguishes them. Impressive leaders and
insulated followers emerge as a result. In the case of
politicized co-ops, many "open-minded" people are
closed-minded to those who don't precisely match their
definition of politically correct open-mindedness. Those
who overcome this problem, and bypass immediate accep
tance and popularity to seek broad, all-encompassing solu
tions produce real results as a result of their initiative.
Those who don't take this challenge corner themselves
into static, useless positions. In the case of cultural theme
houses, it is similarly bold, confident individuals who tri
umph and produce real results for themselves and others.
Esslin's observations are accurate in the sense that
each student here can realistically control whether he
becomes a satisfied or a self-pitying individual.
