## Greek system offers important friendships 
### 
As vice president of Pi Beta Phi
sorority, I would like to point out that
the antagonism and hypocrisy of the
anti-Greek hatred shared by The
Daily and the University is both unfair
and unhealthy.
The Greek system at Stanford
works in many ways to brine the

VIEWPOINT

diverse group of students that make
up our student body together without
discriminating. Stanford, for all its
wonderful academics, is far from a
perfect school; on the contrary. I see
the campus as disjointed, uncohesive
and consisting of little pockets of
humanity spread apart across the vast
acreage the Stanfords were generous
enough to give us. This disjointedness,
combined with the fact that after
freshman year, when we were treated
like kings and led around by wonder
ful RFs. RAs. AAs and advisers and in
general made to feel cared about,
seems to indicate to me that the Uni
versity often forgets about us except
when it comes time to pay our bills,
declare our majors and graduate.
After the very dehumanizing expe
rience of the Draw, we are thrust out
into the cold world of upperclassman
housing, where people who have
already made their friends freshman
year abound and who are often most
concerned with how much they will
make the first year out of college.
The Greek system offers a remedy
to this by creating real, lasting
friendships that are based on emo
tional ties, ties which will last entire

lifetimes and not just until your next
door neighbor goes overseas next
quarter.
1 would also like to point out that
"parties" are not all we do together;
we have very valuable solemn times
and even sometimes-menial weekly
meetings which offer time to interact
with the other members on a more
serious level.
1 would also like to take this oppor
tunity to reply to a statement made
during the open forum of the task
force on fraternities and sororities by
Julie Hansen, who made a comment to
the effect that the three largest
sororities were the best and that the
smallest one did horribly during rush
this year. Hansen seemed to think this
was a view taken by all three of the
sororities in question, and 1 would like
to say that this is completely wrong.
The members of Pi Beta Phi do not
see that any one or group of sororities
is "better" than another or that
anyone did "better" during rush. We
do not believe that quality can be
measured in numbers, and we believe
that sororities are equally wonderful
and we are more interested in the ad
vancement of the entire sorority sys
tem and growth of each chapter than
any of this petty comparison seems to
indicate. It is unfortunate that such
unnecessary quarreling among our
selves must go on when the real issue
is the existence of the sorority system
at Stanford, which I think must not be
done away with by the Univeristy.
