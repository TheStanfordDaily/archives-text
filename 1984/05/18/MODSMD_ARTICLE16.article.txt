## Editorial missed point of GALA week 
### 
Wc feel that the editorial "GLAS with class,"
(Daily, May 14) regarding Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week (GALA Week), though well
intentioned. missed the point. The Stanford Daily
has a responsibility to be informed about the issues
it chooses to address. In the editorial, not only did
The Daily tail to grasp the objective of GALA
Week, but the force of the editorial was in express
ing gratitude at not having to face the issue of
homosexuality rather than taking an editorial
stand on the issue itself.
The objective of GALA Week, as its name
would indicate, is awareness. In this context,

VIEWPOINT

awareness means to us that people should make
some effort to understand the position of
homosexuals in our society. In effect, The Daily
editorial tells us that GLAS did not accomplish its
goal of increasing awareness. The Daily praises
GLAS for carrying out the week's events
"discreetly" and for not drawing "unnecessary or
excessive attention" to them. The premise of this
seems to be that the gay and lesbian movement is
somehow "OK" as long as it is not visible and does
not challenge the values of our heterosexuality
dominated society. This implicitly condemns
public demonstrations, speakouts and other activi
ties intended to promote awareness. The praise of
GLAS' discretion actually undermines the purpose
of GALA Week and the gay movement. The im
plications of the article are contrary to its stated
objective, that of praising GLAS for making a

"strong and positive statement."
"GLAS proved that the subject of
homosexuality, a sensitive issue in today's society,
can be handled in a dignified, scholarly and un
pretentious manner." This statement does nut nec
essarily imply that the subject of homosexuality is
usually handled in a non-"dignified," etc. manner.
It does, however, express surprise that the issue
was handled in a positive way. By endowing GLAS
with a burden of proof, the statement implies the
need for such proof. Other organizations which
carry out events are praised for the quality of activ
ities or number of people attending â€” Stanford
students in other organizations are generally
assumed to conduct themselves in a positive way.
Here, the positive behavior seems to be called the
exception rather than the rule.
The next paragraph emphasizes the "discretion"
ol GLAS in not "drawing unnecessary or excessive
attention to the week's happenings," and adds that
"no one was coerced in attending a single facet of
the week." This sort of "negative praise" effec
tively accomplishes its reverse by implying that
coercion could have been a problem. It is true that
no one was coerced into attending the week's
events. It is also true that no one was publicly
flogged in White Plaza last week. Both are equally
relevant.
"GLAS also allowed people to think and decide
tor themselves whether the situations homosexuals
face in society are just." We do not see GALA
Week's intentions as being to raise questions about
the justice of society's treatment of homosexuals,
but rather to educate people about specific situa-

tions and attitudes relating to homosexuals. The
Daily is introdueing moral judgment into the issue
without taking a moral stance, which is a tricky po
sition. We believe that homosexuals, because they
are a minority, are oppressed by society. The Daily
maintains that this is an open question, where
GLAS does not.
"... it is obviously left to the individual to deter
mine whether he or she accepts the gay commu
nity .. " Accepting the gay community is not the
same as adopting the gay lifestyle, which seems to
be the real choice presented to the individual. The
gay community, like the black community and
other minority groups, is a significant part of our
society. The alternative to accepting the gay com
munity is ignoring ii, which The Daily statement
seems to promote as a viable alternative.
We appreciate Ihe Daily's attempt to portray
GAI.A Week in a positive light. In particular, the
references to "Gay Blue Jeans Day" offered in
sight and informed commentary on student
responses and attitudes toward homosexuality. In
challenging the assumptions which permeate the
article, and which we see as a reflection of the
heterosexist and homophobic ideology which op
presses homosexuals, our purpose is not to con
demn I he Daily. Rather, we would like to go one
step further in encouraging people to examine
these issues more fully, as well as the assumptions
behind them.
