## Don't have to be 'expert' to speak 
### 
David Gress starts his letter (Daily,
May 15) by making a point that Prof.
Freeman Dyson is not an "arms
expert." This point is probably well
taken and I think that Dyson does not
think of himself as an "arms expert."
However, that does not mean that
Dyson's "arms expertise" doesn't go
beyond that of some of the "arms
experts." Dyson is fairly well-in
formed on national security and
nuclear arms issues and consults, at
times, the Arms Control and Dis
armament Agency.
But Gress goes on to argue that
natural scientists should not speak on
problems of international war and
peace because they lack the expertise.
The notion that scientists have to be
supermen in order to confront all
these issues implies that the "arms
experts" themselves have to be super
men in order to study all the relevant
topics (world history, international
relations, etc.). Furthermore, the
author of the letter focuses on the
problem of how scientists easily gain
credibility in the public mind as
"arms experts" although they are not.
I would like to contrast this problem,
which Gress considers one of the
"most serious" in contemporary
nuclear arms debate, with one of the
"arms experts" excluding others from
the debate because the others lack
credibility and knowledge. By doing
this they are in fact limiting their own
views. But the whole issue has to be
taken from a broader perspective.
The issue of nuclear arms is so
important, I think, to everyone in the
world today that leaving it in the
realm of the "arms experts" is simply
not the right solution. The whole
world, and not just the "arms expert"
is left to the consequences of the
policies of these "arms experts."
Given the "creat achievements of
the "arms i \nrrt in this field,

maybe the "arms expert" supermen
can accept a modest contribution to
the debate from an ordinary human
non-expert like Dyson.

Homophobia
Perhaps GLAS does have class
(Daily editorial. May 14) but The
Daily editors seem a bit aggressive
with the term "homophobia." The
implied characterization of jeanless
students on "Gay Blue Jeans Day" as
homophobic may be correct for some,
but did it occur to the editors that one
does not have to be homophobic to
disagree with homosexual lifestyles?
Since the American Heritage Dic
tionary defines "phobia" as "a persis
tent, abnormal or illogical fear of a
specific thing or situation," I find that
The Daily was irresponsible in its
failure to distinguish between that
"widespread infection" —
"homophobia " — and a more
reasonable opinion of homosexual
lifestyle.
I know many Stanford students
who have no undue fear of
homosexuals, yet who also find that
lifestyle to be incompatible with their
own moral and social values.
The Daily states: "The conscious
action of some students to change
their dress for fear of being labeled a
'supporter' of the homosexual com
munity shows how uptight many are
when directly confronted with the
issue of homosexuality." This is
pretty presumptuous. But then again.
I've seen Daily opinion founded on
much less highly empirical forms of
social analysis. (As if most students
even thought twice, or even once,
about what they were going to wear
that day.)
Yes, persecution of homosexuals is
wrong. / 'id "hom< phobia" do exist

in our society. But it is very wrong to
include in the class "homophobe"
those students who possess an honest
and thoughtful belief that they in no
way can even tacitly support a life
style that is at odds with their own
moral standards.

"Blank off "
In response to The Daily's front
page article on the task force and
Stanford fraternities (May 10), we
would like to express our disappoint
ment over the unwarranted inclusion
of profanity in an interview with one
of the fraternity presidents. Never
before have we seen the words "fuck
off' printed on the front page of The
Daily — or on any page of the paper,
tor that matter. This is very disturbing
because it reflects The Daily's bias
against fraternities.
Good journalism rests on consis
tency and responsible, even-handed
reporting. The decision to print these
words ot profanity, from an entire
interview, is clearly unusual and
displays an ugly streak of sen
sationalism. This is especially discon
certing considering the current con
troversy surrounding the very exis
tence of fraternities at Stanford.
Any editor should recognize that
printing such an expression only
serves to confirm a negative
stereotype of fraternities and frater
nity members. Such generalizations
are often created by a minority — it is
the job of responsible journalists to
avoid and prevent their perpetuation.
The effects of The Daily's careless
ness are not only to damage the
reputation of the fraternity members,
but also to damage the credibility of
the newspaper as a respected medium
of communication. In the future, The
Daily should maintain its otherwise

solid reputation by confining its
biases to the editorial page.

Editor's note: It has been and will
continue to be The Daily's policy to
print terms such us "fuck-off when
accurate and fair. We have done so
before, especially in direct quotes,
because to paraphrase or to use hyp
hens would be to underestimate the
maturity of our audience.
Union-busting
Donald Kennedy's letter of May 8,
anil its effects, leave no question in
regards to the University's position
on recognizing United Stanford
Workers (USW) Local 680.
In its best effort to hide federal
laws and regulations, the real motive
comes across clearly and adds up to
union busting.
I he University's strategy involves
the usual divide-and-conquer tactic,
i.e., returning of union dues, which
naturally affects the union shop
clause, on the one hand, and com
pensates pro-unions members with,
what appears to be, retroactive dues
on the other.
I he real problem Stanford has with
USW Local 680 is that it cannot now,
nor has it ever been able to, control
the unit under its present leadership.
Stanford's determined effort to
eliminate USW, if successful, will
have a negative effect on all members
of the community. We need to re
membei that it was through USW
el torts that we received our birthday
holiday and the dental plan.
USW needs our support and it's
about time we stopped riding on its
efforts and joined the struggle for
workers rights.
