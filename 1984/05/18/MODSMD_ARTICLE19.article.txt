# Don't let that 50-minute car ride keep you from The City
## 
### LISA PALMER 
Stanford is approximately an
inch trom San 1-rancisco on a
map <>t California, hut, judging
from the scarcity of students
who takc advantage of this vi
brant city it might as well he in
another world.
In tact, San Francisco is an
other kind o! world. However, it
may he reached in only 50
minutes by car. or if studying
and relaxing en route is
preferred, an hour by bus or
train. (Caltrain leaves IN times a
day from the Palo Alto station;
catch Samtrans on Fl ( amino
across from Stanford).
To the Stanfordite who has
not left campus since Christmas,
the first view of The City may be
a shock. Not everyone wears
OP sand oxfords!
Start with a walk down Mar
' et Street. Notice the variety of

people: a beggar holding an im
aginary conversation with his
landlord, a man in army fatigues
patched with strips of masking
tape, an improv ised jazz quartet
and a bag lady fishing her dinner
out of a trash can.
I urn up Powell Street toward
Union Square and stop to listen
to the flute and guitar duo jam
ming on the corner. A couple of
blocks up the hill and you are at
Union Square, grand stage for a
breakdance group as well as rest
ing place for diverse people and
numerous pigeons. This is the
heart of some of the best shop
ping in The City.
After relaxing on the grass for
a few minutes, take time to ex
plore some art galleries. Walk
up Geary a block to the Wolf
Shulz gallery at 3N3 Geary. On
display are lithographs and dry
point etchings by Picasso, paint
ings by Chagall and Matisse, as
well as a beautiful collection of
lithographs from the Mexican
artist /.uniga.
Take a right on Mason and
you will find yourself at the One
Act (heater. Perhaps you will
be in time for a lunchtime show

chitecture in this area, interpos
ing antiquated row houses be
tween ultra-modern structures
such as the Hyatt Hotel on Post
Street.
The key to exploring San
Francisco is to keep your eyes
and ears open; you never know
what treasures you may find.
Back down to Market Street,
perhaps it is time for a mar
garita. The currently swinging
Cadillac Bar on Mission just off
Fourth is the place to go. Great

nachos, a lively atmosphere and
the guitar players will salute you
with "feliz cumpleanos" il it
happens to be your birthday,
fhen go off to the Museum of

Modern Art at Van Ness and
McAllister to examine a large
collection of art from the recent
past as well as that of living
artists. Currently the huge
abstracts of New York artist
Robert Motherwell are on dis
play as well as breathtaking
photographs from Ansel
Adams. A large collection of the
works of Stieglitz, Helmar
Lerski and Harry Callahan are
on display as well. (Having seen
the exhibit, who could forget
"Eleanor and Barbara"?)
Back down Market to Church

tor an experience in Chinese
food. Orchid's, a peaceful res
taurant lavished with tall stalks
ot peach and mauve flowers is
just the place.
If a light seafood meal is your
afternoon preference in the City
by the Hay, make a detour to
Blanche s. located on a pier by
itself near the train station. This
tiny restaurant museum, featur
ing local artists and bathtub art
has a sign on the door: "This is a
quiet little place for those
seeking serenity. Love,
Blanche." That says it all.
One final stop on your way
back to the highway must be
that unique structure jutting out
among the warehouses on
Gough street — St. Mary's Ca
thedral. Affectionately
nicknamed "St. Mary Maytag,"
the view and gracefulness of its
arching architecture is unforget
table from the interior.
No matter what interests you
have. T he City has something to
offer. Keep your eyes and ears
open, and who knows what fas
cinating things you may dis
cover.
