llie tin nes tluit Dave Hi >t torn likes to re mem her
about his 17 years as a swimmer are not the records,
times and awards that he has won. but the memories
that linger with him.
Bottom said that he can recall his very first swim
meet, which took place when lie was 4 seats old.
• I swam one race, the 25 tree, and the next race I
had to do was the 25 hack." Bottom said from
Southern California, where he is competing in the
Dupont Speedo lournament in Mission Viejo. "My
mom and m\ brothers were there to w rap me up in a
towel and gi\e me a sort ol game hug and pat on the
back. But m\ mom said I had to hum. because my
next race was coming up soon.
"When I heard the gun for the next heat, which
wasn't the 25 back. I thought it was my race, and I
dove right back in the pool and started swimming
the wrong was. I was heading straight lor the other
swimmers, who were coming trom the other direc
tion," he said.
It was not exactly a glorious way for Bottom to
begin his swimming career, but now. 17 years later,
the Stanford junior is racing away from the competi
tion. not towards it. He is considered one ot
America's best swimmers, with more than a decent
shot at making the U.S. Olympic Team as a back
stroker.
Bottom holds the school records in the 100-meter
butterfl\ and the 100-backstroke, as well as the
second best times in the 1 00-trcestyle. 200-back and
200-individual medley. He is a member of the 400-
medley and 400-treestyle relay teams that set the
best times in the history ot Stanford swimming. In
19.53. he was voted the Pacific-10 Co-Swimmer of
the Year. He was also a three-year All-American at
tiny San Ramon High School in Danville, Calit.
the list of his accolades does not stop there. At
last summer's Pan-American Games. Bottom took
home a silver medal in the 100-backstroke. And at
the U.S. Swimming Championships in April. 19N2.
Bottom became the first person ever to swim the
100-baek in under 49 seconds, as he set an Ameri
can record with a time ol 48.94.
However. Bottom, a co-captain on this years's
Cardinal swim team, said he does not like to think
about his past achievements.
"I don't really dwell on the past too much. If you
start resting on your laurels, you don't go forward.
Bottom said.
Another ol Bottom's athletic policies deals with
predictions, especially when they concern himself.
He does not like to gi\e them.
"I always set my goals pretty high, but 1 don t
make it a habit to share them before a meet." Bot
tom said.
While Bottom w ill not speculate about his chances
of coming home with an Olympic medal, he will not

hesitate to say that training for the Games is one ol
his top priorities.
Like many other Olympic hopefuls who are going
to college. Bottom, an economics major, has
decided to put the books aside tor a quarter to train
for the U.S. Olympic Trials in Indianapolis which
begin June 25.
He is a strong contender to make one ol the two
spots on the Olympic team in the 100-backstroke,
but he also plans to swim in the 200-backstroke and
the 100-butterfly at the trials.
Bottom is now under the tutelage ot Stanford
swimming Head Coach Skip Kenney and Mike
Troy, who is the coach of Bottom's swim club, the
Walnut Creek Aqua Bears. Regarding his workout

schedule. Bottom said. " I his is the most extended
period I've ever trained. I'm in the best shape ot my
life"
The 2 I-year-old swimmer said he is now going
through daily tour-hour workouts in the pool and
weight training every other day. However. Bottom
said Ins training will not he the only resource he will

•• > tin really can't cram 111 the training in one
Near."' he said. "It's primarily the 17 years that I've
been swimming that will help me now.
••liver since I was a little kid. I've been thinking
about the Olympics. At age seven you could have
asked me about it. I've always had big dreams and
high expectations." the Olympic hopeful said.
Bottom's whole swimming career has exemplified
his commitment to setting glials one In one and then
achiev ing them.
In l l >N2. lor example, when he sot the American
record, which has since been broken, in the 100-
backstroke. Bottom said that going into the race. "I
just had a time goal that I knew I could do all year.'"
||i> "goal" happened to be about one-tenth of a
second better than Ins eventual record-breaking
time.
Bottom comes from a family that has already had
its share ot success in the swimming pool. His lather
was on the swim team at the Naval Academy and his
two brothers. Joe. 29. and Mike. 2S. were both
Olympic swimmers from USC .
In 1976. Joe won a silver medal in the 100-
butterflv at the Montreal Olympiad, while Mike
qualified for the U.S. Team in 19M). the year
America boycotted the (lames in Moscow.
Bottom said that his brothers "have just helped
me with their good example, and their Olympic
success does not put any extra pressure on him to do
well this summer.
The Card swimmer also said the recent Soviet-led
boycott, which has giv en this summer's (lames a tar
nished aspect, is "a shame.
"It would be nice to have everybody here, but I
can't let that affect me too much." Bottom said. "I
have to concentrate on Indianapolis and just trying
to make the team.
Though swimming has taken up a great deal of his
time here at Stanford. Bottom said that he has never
regretted having had to balance the lite of a student
with that of an athlete.
"There is so much going on at Stanford," he said.
"There are other activities that you could do. but I
love swimming with those guys (on the team).
There's nothing I'd rather be doing."
Except, maybe, fulfill a childhood dream by win
ning an Olympic medal this summer in Los Angeles.
The odds are fairly good that Dave Bottom will do
just that, provided he does not do something unus
ual like jump the gun and swim in the wrong direc
tion.
