Alter resting up from an im
pressive showing in the NCAA
team competition, five members
of the Stanford men's tennis
team entered the individual
tournament yesterday in At
hens, Ga.
But the Cardinal players'
showing in the individual com
petition was not quite so im
pressive.
The top four Cardinal singles
players — Dan Goldie, Eric
Rosenfeld, Jim Grabb and Mark
McKeen — all competed today
after receiving invitations- to
partipate in the individuals. Of
the tour, Dan Goldie is the only
Card singles player who remains
in this year's NCAA event.
Goldie, the seventh seed in the
tournament, meets Peter Mallet
of Oklahoma State University
today.
Stanford's No. I doubles
team — sophomores Grabb and
John Letts — were invited to
play in the individual doubles

competition. It has not yet been
announced which duo the
unseeded pair will meet in the
first round.
The Cardinal has faced a
grueling schedule in recent days.
Beginning last Saturday, the
team was involved in four very
close matches for the team title,
played on four consecutive days.
Head Coach Dick Gould indi
cated that although the team is
relatively healthy, the players
can become fatigued.
In the team competition,
every match went down to the
wire. Stanford won the first
three all by the score of 5-4, but
lost in the finals to the Bruins by
that same score. Players
enjoyed a day of R & R Wed
nesday before they began the
individuals yesterday.
In the first round of the indi
viduals competition, Goldie
easily beat John Karisar from
Northwestern 6-2, 6-2, and
Rosenfeld was able to get the
service breaks he needed as he

beat Tom Fontana from Texas
6-4, 6-4. Stanford's No. 3
singles player, Grabb, found
himself invloved in another
close match. This time,
however, opponent Dan Cas
sidy was able to emerge as the
victor by the narrow margin of
7-6, 5-7, 6-4.
In the fourth singles match.
Stanford's team captain Mark
McKeen went up against the top
seed in the tournament, Paul
Annacone from lennessee.
McKeen won the first set in the
tiebreaker. But Annacone came
right back and won the next set
6-3. The score was tied going
into the ninth game of the third
set, with McKeen serving. He
let the game slip away and An
nacone went on to take the set
and the match with a 6-4 win.
Annacone continued to win,
cruising past Steve Anaston
from UC-Irvine.
McKeen's match wasn't the
only one which was hard
fought. In the second round.

Rosenfeld went into a match
against Fernando Perez from
Louisiana State University.
Perez took the first set from him
6-4, hut Rosenfeld came back

on a rampage and won the
second easily 6-1. The third
needed to go 12 games,
but Perez finally pulled the
match out 7-5.

So Goldie is the lone Cardinal
in the singles competition, and if
he can remain in the tourna
ment he has a chance of playing
in the finals on Sunday after

noon. Meanwhile. Card fans can
also hope that Letts and Grahh
don't experience the sophomore
slump in their hid for the
doubles crown.
