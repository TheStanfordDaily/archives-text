# Sluggers fall to Giants, rest up for NCAA tourney
## 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sportswriter 
Yesterday's game between the San I ran
cisco Ciiants and the NCAA-bound Stan
lord baseball team was billed as an exhibi
tion game, and the Giants 5-3 victory over
the Cardinal lived up to its billing.
The Giants exhibited their graciousness
by forsaking a one-day vacation from the
National League play to appear on the
Farm. Yet, at times. Manager Frank Robin
son's club also displayed the sort of play that
has produced a 14-22 start and a firm grasp
iin last place in the National League's West
ern Division. Although San Francisco col
lected 10 hits, they also committed four er
rors and were picked off first base four
times.
And Stanford? Well, the 15th-ranked
Cardinal exhibited . . . well, a lot of players.
"It's a fun game and it's really nice of (the
Giants owner) Mr. Lurie and the Giants to
come down," the Card's Head Coach Mark
Marquess said in summarizing the spirit of
the competition. "And, it's a real thrill for
our guys to play against the guys they've
been watching for years."
Marquess used 2ft of his ballplayers, in
cluding a different pitcher in each inning.
Robinson, meanwhile, gave his substitutes
some play ing time by removing most of his
big guns in the middle of the third inning.
The stars in such a game are usually
unlikely ones and each squad had a haII

player who left the field with something
special. The Cardinal could point to senior
relief pitcher Gregg Lomnicky. who was the
onl\ Stanford hurler to set San Francisco
down in order, doing so in the eighth inning.
••1 had to like that." Lomnicky declared.
"This will he the only time of my life that I'll
have faced anyone professional. They're
somebody you idolize and (today) I got to
pitch against them. Now. I can always say
that I pitched against major leaguers and
got them out one-two-three. I'll quit right
here, while I'm ahead."
For the Giants, the game's most exciting
moment occurred in the third inning when
second baseman Duane Kuiper's fly ball oil
Rob Wassenaar fell just beyond the leaping
grasp of right fielder Walt Harris lor a two
run home run that tied the contest 3-3. A
number of Giants tell to the ground in dis
belief because the round-tripper was only
the second in Kuiper's major league career,
the only other came way hack on Aug. 29,
1977.
The Giants began the scoring when left
fielder Jeff Leonard led off the second in
ning by popping a Jeff Ballard pitch over the
fence in left-center field. When Leonard fi
nally did complete a leisurely stroll around
the bases, San Francisco had an early 1-0
lead.
Stanford retaliated in the third against

(iiant starter John Hurkctt. a minor leaguer.
Dam I Stephens ripped a sin l ! over the In st
base bag and into the right field corner for a
triple that scored Mark Davis with the tying
run. Three singles followed, and the Card
had a 3-1 advantage.
One of those singles was of! the bat ot
shortstop John Yerducci. Yerducci was
named to the Pacific-10 Conference all
league team this week and the award ap
peared to liven his bat. A ,2n2 hitter during
the regular season. Verducci ripped three
singles in four trips to the plate and robbed
Steve Nicosia of a base hit in the fourth with
a diving stab of a hot line drive.
"They threw me a lot oi fastballs and
fastballs are easy to hit." Yerducci said.
"The game was a lot of fun and to step on
the same field with those guvs was an honor.
It was generous ot them to pome."
Alter Kuiper's homer, the Giants won the
game with solo scores,,in the sixth and
seventh innings.
Stanford must now wait for Monday and
word from the NCAA on the Card's
Regional location and opponents. "Our
guys could use the time off." said Marquess,
whose Cardinal will play in the NCAA
tournament lor the fourth straight year. "It
I was to guess (on a site) it would be
Arizona State."
