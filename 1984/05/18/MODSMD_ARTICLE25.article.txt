## Bella Vista good, but don't let your expectations soar 
### JENNIFER FREY 
Bella Vista Restaurant
13451 Skyline Blvd.
Woodside
851-1229
I've heard it said that Bella Vista is the restau
rant in the area. I would say that if you're looking
for an interesting mix of elegant dining and rustic
decor. The Bella Vista on Skyline Blvd. in the hills
above Redwood City is a lovely choice.
While our first reaction was quite mixed, I
would in all fairness attribute this to our precon
ceived expectations. As we had only heard ac
colades of how elegant the dining experience
promised to be, we were a bit unprepared for the
mix in decor and atmoshpere of woodsy architec
ture, neon signs shaped as cocktail glasses, rustic
interiors and a barside juke box. With these ex
pectations in mind and a half-hour wait for our N
p.m. dinner reservation one can see how slightly
negative first impressions were formulated.
Once seated, however, it was easy to begin ap
preciating the unique characteristics of which the
Bella Vista boasts. They do have a panoramic
view of the Southern Bay Area, which proves
stunning even on a foggy night, as well as a fine
continental menu and an extensive wine list.
We perused the menu while nibbling on bread,
which did not distinguish itself in any particular
way, and considering the various choices to make
between the evening's specials and the usual daily
cuisine. From the list of hot and cold appetizers
we opted for Escargots Bouguigonnes ($4.95), Fresh
Asparagus ($5.95, a special) and green salad. As
dinner choices we decided on Tournedos a la Ros
sini ($18.95) and Stuffed Veal Florentine
($16.95). While these choices were on the upper
end of the cost spectrum, entrees ranged in price
from roughly $10 to a $30 (Duck a I'o.ange for
two).
At this time we glanced at the dessert menu to
see it there was anything we might have wanted or
needed to order ahead of time. Sure enough there
was ;i $9 souffle which required a 45-tninute
forewarning, but we decided against it.
Next came the fun of looking through the im
pressive wine list, which provided regional maps
of the various locations where the wines were
produced. Here we chose a simple Mouton Cadet
($11) which accompanied our dinner choices well.
Actually this order followed a previous mix-up
with our wine order in which we were brought an
expensive bottle by mistake and which was even
tually taken away. The embarrassment this caused
dampened the rest of our meal.
Wine prices ranged anywhere from $6.50 for a

carafe of the house wine to the most expensive of
imported bottles.
Getting on with the actual meal, the escargot
arrived and impressed us both in its richness and
absolutely delicious garlic and butter sauce. I was
particularly smitten and would venture to say that
these were some of the best escargot I've ever
had.
As the sun had completely set by now, the lights
on the horizon began to twinkle and the view
became all that more spectacular and the atmo
sphere was that much more enhanced.
The green salad was nice but I was mostly taken

by my fresh asparagus which was served chilled
under shrimp and mushrooms doused with a very
traditional trench vinaigrette. If this special is
available on your visit I would recommend it
highly
I should mention that while the service atten
tion given to being seated and having our order
taken was leisurely at best, the progression of
wine, appetizers and entrees is at a much quicker
and more efficient pace. However, we thought the
attitude was quite cool and friends have cited
similar experiences.
A nice touch between appetizer and entree was
the palate-freshening serving of orange sorbet,
which preceded dinner. The dinner entrees were
both excellent, each accompanied by delicately
prepared carrots, zucchini and potatoes. The tour
nedos was extremely good, a Superb filet of beef
cooked to perfection.
On the other hand, my Veal Florentine, which
was stuffed with spinach and cheese, was a bit dull
tasting.
In the end we skipped dessert and coffee as we
were both quite satisfied, though the offerings
were tempting. Desserts constituted a traditional
French selection of creme caramel, chocolate
mousse, souffles and seasonal fruit (fresh straw
berries and raspberries).
Overall the dinner experience was enjoyable,
although my initial impressions were hard to
escape. As long as your prepared for the mix in at
mosphere, decor, service and a possible wait, the
Bella Vista is a recommended spot for a special
dinner out.
