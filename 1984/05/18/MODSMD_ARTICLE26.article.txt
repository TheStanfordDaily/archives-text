# Not a mistake at Maddalena's

Maddalena's

The scenario: An incredibly fussy
grandmother, father or flame wants to go
to dinner. They know the best and they
expect you to have this same knowledge.
In cases where the least mistake would
be of the utmost embarrassment, you
would be safe suggesting Maddalena's, a
restaurant where elegance and propriety
seem key.

Maddalena's has tuxedoed waiters, a
distinguished looking owner, Mr. Mad
dalena, who oversees the production and
even a roving classical guitar player. A
hit boring you may he saying. It could he,
hut only if you find elegance horing.
When other restaurants may offer cer
tain fun combinations or a funky atmo
sphere, Maddalena's doesn't deal with
that. It is continental, with white linen, a
huge chandelier, dark wood and bevelled
mirrors.
A friend of mine said that Mad
dalena's is too fancy for Palo Alto, but
on the night we ate there it was not too
stuffy; one room with dark wood and
spotlights on french can-can posters
gives a particularly warm and appealing
feeling. Waiters also do some of the
cooking in the main dining room,
primarily the more dramatic productions
like flaming desserts. Furthermore, you
can always watch the prom-goers at the
next table and see if the evening appears
to be going well, or try to find the
rumored private room, which can be
reserved for an intimate party of two.

The menu is expansive and expensive
with French and Italian specialties. Our
self-assured waiter suggested his
favorites — Saute Prawns Bordelaise
($14.95), veal with a special mushroom
sauce, and Tournedos Henri IV. After
that he left us poring over the wine list
and the menu. We had to send him away
a few times for more search time.
After much deliberation we chose a
California wine that was $7 for a half
bottle. A few minutes later the waiter
came back with a substitute since they
were out of our choice. He said his selec
tion was better anyway.
We didn't argue with the waiter much.
He seemed like he knew what he was
talking about.
Everything on the menu is a la carte,
which is ultimately more expensive but

also more fun. Instead of the usual salad
you can start the meal with Escargots
Bourguigonnes ($5.95), cherrystone
clams ($6.25) or a number of other
choices.
The french onion au gratin soup
($3.50) was delicious. Its wine flavor was
complemented by the usual french bread
and cheese melted on it. After attempt
ing this dish at home, I've taken to order
ing it only in restaurants; this was one of
the best versions I've had.
We also had hearts of artichokes saute
dore, which turned out to be artichoke
hearts in a light batter with a nice touch
of lemon flavor. The batter tastes mostly
of egg.
Our next dishes were the prawns and
Filet Saute Bearnaise ($16.95), which is
a filet mignon steak with bearnaise
sauce. These choices meant we couldn't
try an awful lot of other things that
sounded good, such as rack of lamb (S3K
for two), Coq au Vin ($11.50) or Lin
guine Caciucco ($13.50) which is pasta
with shrimp, crab and baby clams.
One of the best things about the

shrimp had to be the way it was pre
sented. About 12 large prawns were ar
ranged in a circle on the outside of the
plate, with an inner circle of green beans
and pureed carrots. The chef obviously
pays attention to detail. Anyone who has
looked at pictures of food in Gourmet
magazine or Bun Appetit knows that ar
rangement of food can be an art; it
makes you feel kind of bad to take that
first bite.
The shrimp were large and delicious
with a very light sauce. Though I've al
ways associated pureed carrots primarily
with baby food, they were surprisingly
good. The green beans were slightly
crunchy and thus passed my taste test.
The steak was tender but the flavor
was not exceptional and perhaps the veal
would be a better choice for beef eaters.
The bearnaise sauce had that distinct and
necessary tarragon flavor and is served in
a dish on the side.
Midway through the meal a person in
punk-looking clothes zipped through the
dining room. He looked quite out of
place but I expected him to emerge from
the kitchen in a tuxedo to take orders.
Instead he came out in more elegant
attire and began playing guitar. He
played classical music and went around
to individual tables to strum requests.
The woman at the next table asked for
something Hawaiian which the guitarist
didn't know; he played something
Spanish instead. And when he said that

his band had made a video that day, we
had the distinct impression that it wasn't
a video of classical guitar playing. We
should have asked.
Our bill came to about $50 for two.
You could look at it as a drain of about a
week's part-time salary or you could
look at it as an investment in your social
graces. Perhaps it will prepare you for a
future trip to Europe or impress your
fussy friends.

Maddalena's
544 Kmerson Street
Palo Alto
326-6082
The scenario: An incredibly fussy
grandmother, father or flame wants to go
to dinner. They know the best and they
expect you to have this same knowledge.
In cases where the least mistake would
be of the utmost embarrassment, you
would be safe suggesting Maddalena's, a
restaurant where elegance and propriety
seem key.

Maddalena's has tuxedoed waiters, a
distinguished looking owner, Mr. Mad
dalena, who oversees the production and
even a roving classical guitar player. A
hit boring you may he saying. It could he,
hut only if you find elegance horing.
When other restaurants may offer cer
tain fun combinations or a funky atmo
sphere, Maddalena's doesn't deal with
that. It is continental, with white linen, a
huge chandelier, dark wood and bevelled
mirrors.
A friend of mine said that Mad
dalena's is too fancy for Palo Alto, but
on the night we ate there it was not too
stuffy; one room with dark wood and
spotlights on french can-can posters
gives a particularly warm and appealing
feeling. Waiters also do some of the
cooking in the main dining room,
primarily the more dramatic productions
like flaming desserts. Furthermore, you
can always watch the prom-goers at the
next table and see if the evening appears
to be going well, or try to find the
rumored private room, which can be
reserved for an intimate party of two.

The menu is expansive and expensive
with French and Italian specialties. Our
self-assured waiter suggested his
favorites — Saute Prawns Bordelaise
($14.95), veal with a special mushroom
sauce, and Tournedos Henri IV. After
that he left us poring over the wine list
and the menu. We had to send him away
a few times for more search time.
After much deliberation we chose a
California wine that was $7 for a half
bottle. A few minutes later the waiter
came back with a substitute since they
were out of our choice. He said his selec
tion was better anyway.
We didn't argue with the waiter much.
He seemed like he knew what he was
talking about.
Everything on the menu is a la carte,
which is ultimately more expensive but

also more fun. Instead of the usual salad
you can start the meal with Escargots
Bourguigonnes ($5.95), cherrystone
clams ($6.25) or a number of other
choices.
The french onion au gratin soup
($3.50) was delicious. Its wine flavor was
complemented by the usual french bread
and cheese melted on it. After attempt
ing this dish at home, I've taken to order
ing it only in restaurants; this was one of
the best versions I've had.
We also had hearts of artichokes saute
dore, which turned out to be artichoke
hearts in a light batter with a nice touch
of lemon flavor. The batter tastes mostly
of egg.
Our next dishes were the prawns and
Filet Saute Bearnaise ($16.95), which is
a filet mignon steak with bearnaise
sauce. These choices meant we couldn't
try an awful lot of other things that
sounded good, such as rack of lamb (S3K
for two), Coq au Vin ($11.50) or Lin
guine Caciucco ($13.50) which is pasta
with shrimp, crab and baby clams.
One of the best things about the

shrimp had to be the way it was pre
sented. About 12 large prawns were ar
ranged in a circle on the outside of the
plate, with an inner circle of green beans
and pureed carrots. The chef obviously
pays attention to detail. Anyone who has
looked at pictures of food in Gourmet
magazine or Bun Appetit knows that ar
rangement of food can be an art; it
makes you feel kind of bad to take that
first bite.
The shrimp were large and delicious
with a very light sauce. Though I've al
ways associated pureed carrots primarily
with baby food, they were surprisingly
good. The green beans were slightly
crunchy and thus passed my taste test.
The steak was tender but the flavor
was not exceptional and perhaps the veal
would be a better choice for beef eaters.
The bearnaise sauce had that distinct and
necessary tarragon flavor and is served in
a dish on the side.
Midway through the meal a person in
punk-looking clothes zipped through the
dining room. He looked quite out of
place but I expected him to emerge from
the kitchen in a tuxedo to take orders.
Instead he came out in more elegant
attire and began playing guitar. He
played classical music and went around
to individual tables to strum requests.
The woman at the next table asked for
something Hawaiian which the guitarist
didn't know; he played something
Spanish instead. And when he said that
