la it.x pus: n, /. A social
blunder. 2. A mistake made by a
neophyte restaurant reviewer at a
French restaurant.
I slii uiil start oft this review. I
suppose, by saying that I've
spent plenty of time in restau
rants. As ,i bushoy. In fact, most
ot this time has been spent being
yelled at by boisterous waiters
whose conversations with me
usually consist of quick orders
such as: "Wipe seven, then two
BBs and two aquas on nine."
(Clear table seven, then bring
two bread and butter trays and
two glasses of water to table
nine.)
And these restaurants have
usually been Italian restaurants.
You know, spaghetti, pizza, fet
tucini. As American as a Chev
rolet.
Being an impoverished col
lege student. I jumped at the
chance to try something new.
I rench food: the land of Rodin.
Diderot. Sartre, de Gaulle, all
brought to your table in a
sumptuous compendium ot
delectable novelties. An experi
ment. an experience.
It turns out that the novelty
was a little bit more than I ex
pected. but we'll get to that
ater.

I should interject before I go
much further that Pear Wil
liams. the French restaurant
which was kind enough to assist
me in my culinary experiment, is
a wonderful place to dine. The
food is beautifully prepared and
the atmosphere is calm and
comfortable.
The issue here is embarrass
ment. And lots of it.
fancy restaurants scare me. I
usually dine at the kind of res
taurants that I worked for:
plenty ot food, bargain
basement prices, family-style,
casual atmosphere. I'm always
afraid when 1 eat at a fancy res
taurant that I'm doing the
wrong thing. Waiters can spot
an inexperienced diner a mile
away, and, unfortunately. I'm
painfully aware of that.
This is not to say that Pear
Williams is overly fancy. The
dining area is relatively small,
and the restaurant has a pleas
ant homey atmosphere. Fanci
ness is in the paranoia of the be
holder.
The hostess led us to our
seats, where this reviewer made
mistake No. 1. The hostess held
out a chair and I happily
plopped into it, blind to eti
quette. My companion laughed
pleasantly at my mistake while
the other guests in the restau
rant all seemed to be snickering
into their dinner napkins. I hid
behind my menu.
The menu was a pleasant

surprise. It is filled with entrees
with names that will horrify the
unilingual: "Mousseline de Co
quilles St. Jacques aux Beurre
Rouge" and "Carre d' Agneau
aux Herbes des Provences" are
two prime examples, l uckily.
Pear Williams has pity on
reviewers like this one: Facli
entree has a short explanatory
phrase printed in Fnglish.
The menu informed me that
my entree would be preceded by
soup and a salad. Reassured. I
scoured the list of 12 main
courses.
I was immediately attracted
to "Ris de Veau Moutardicr"
($14.50). The translation in
formed me that this dish is
composed of "braised veal
sweetbreads bathed in a light
mustard sauce in the style ot
nouvelle cuisine."
Visions of piles of thinly
sliced pieces of veal, accompa
nied by equally-attractive piles
of carrot cake, fruit cake and
sourdough bread coursed
through my mind. What arc
sweetbreads if not these
delicacies, thought I. And to top
it all off — mustard sauce! This
French food isn't half bad.
Well, 1 was, needless to say. a
very deluded man. Sweetbreads,
my hostess was to inform me on
the way out of the restaurant,
are the thyroid glands of a baby
cow. But for now . 1 was content
with my imagination.
I, of course, ordered the veal

sweetbreads, much to the
surprise ot m\ companion, who.
when I had told hei that I was
going to order the veal,
assumed that meant the other
veal dish, which is much more

innocuous.
"You're going to order the
sweetbreads?" she asked in
credulously as the waiter hov
ered over us.
"Sure," 1 said confidently.
"Okay," she said. I was not to
he rescued.
The waiter then asked us
about hors d'oeuvrcs and wine,
which took our attention away
from the main course. My com
panion suggested we try the es
cargot with bleu cheese sauce
($4.50) and, being in an adven
turous mood, I quickly ac
quiesced.

I hen the waiter asked mv
pre I ere nee for wine. and. confi
dent that the restaurant
w ouldn t serve California
Coolers or Sangria, which are
m\ favorite wines. 1 yielded the

flooi to my companion, who
confidently ordered a bottle of
Chateau St. Jean chardonnay
($18).
I lie wine came first, and it
was great. A few glasses were
sipped and a lot of my tenseness
dissipated.
Then came the escargot.
Trying escargot is for many the
Great Adventure. I always think
about the common garden vari
ety snail, with its antennae up,
trying to make its way through
life without getting stepped on
by oafs like you and me. Do the
chefs go out and gather up some

from hehinu the restaurant. I
wonder? My tears were laid to
rest at Pear Williams. It turns
out that escargot look very
similar to clanis. The texture is
similar, and the taste is pretty
much covered up by the accom
panying sauee.
Which hi ilitis us to the subject
of sauces. The French seem to
have a fascination with odd
combinations ot spices and
flavors, and all the sauces I
tasted that night were amazingly
delightful assaults on the taste
buds.
The soup was next. It was a
kind ot lukewarm garlic soup
that was uneventful, but the
salad was another story. The
"salad" consisted of lettuce
leases very lightly sprinkled
with an unknown dressing and
walnut shavings. The walnut
shavings were an interesting and
simple innovation, which
complemented the lettuce v cry
nicely.
Then there was quite a wait
for the main course. Which
brings us to another point: It
you're planning on going to a
French restaurant put aside at
least three hours. We waited 45
minutes between the salad and
the entree, which was a new ex
perience for a busboy who is
used to being sweated at in Ital
ian when the customer has to
wait more than five minutes be
tween the salad and main
course.
The main course arrived. My
God. I thought, what are these
two white sausages doing on my
plate? The waiter calmly in
formed me that that was,
indeed, the sweetbread.
I looked down at my plate
again. The two white sausages
looked like hemispheres of the
brain of some kind of animal.
They were swimming in a yellow
sauce. Maybe the sweetbread
part is stuffed inside of the
hemisphere. I thought. I cut one

open. No no. More white brainy
matter.
Calmly reminding mysell that
I had already eaten snails
tonight without noticeable
health disorders. I took .1 bite ot
the sweetbread. I lie texture was
very much like liver, except con
siderably less firm 111 consis
tence The taste was mostly cov
ered up by the mustard saucc.
which was very good.
Mv ruminations on the
wonders ot sweetbread were in
terrupted by my companion,
who asked me in a very com
panionable manner: "How's the
baby cow brain?"
"What?" I said.
"Are you enjoying your baby
cow brain?"
It doesn't really matter that
mv companion was being inex
act. I quickly discerned that
there was a reason my
sweetbread looked like it did. I
couldn't bring myself to eat any
more of it.and when the busboy
cleared the plates he gave me a
knowing look.
"A little too rich, huh." lie
said.
All of this is certainly not
meant to detract from the tasti
ness of the food at Pear Wil
liams. I or baby cows' thyroid
glands, the sweetbread was very
good. I'm sure. And my com
panion. who had a special dish
which was composed ot a beet
Wellington in a puffed pastry
with bearnaise sauce (SIS. I >s)
praised the tood all the way
home.
There's something to be said
for culinary adventure, but
there's very little to be said for
ignorant culinary adventure. It
you're looking tor a really nice
restaurant with reasonable
prices, try Pear Williams. But
please, ask the waiter to tell you
about the dishes. You won t
regret it.

with my imagination.
I, of course, ordered the veal

sweetbreads, much to the
surprise ot m\ companion, who.
when I had told hei that I was
going to order the veal,
assumed that meant the other
veal dish, which is much more

innocuous.
"You're going to order the
sweetbreads?" she asked in
credulously as the waiter hov
ered over us.
"Sure," 1 said confidently.
"Okay," she said. I was not to
he rescued.
The waiter then asked us
about hors d'oeuvrcs and wine,
which took our attention away
from the main course. My com
panion suggested we try the es
cargot with bleu cheese sauce
($4.50) and, being in an adven
turous mood, I quickly ac
quiesced.

I hen the waiter asked mv
pre I ere nee for wine. and. confi
dent that the restaurant
w ouldn t serve California
Coolers or Sangria, which are
m\ favorite wines. 1 yielded the

flooi to my companion, who
confidently ordered a bottle of
Chateau St. Jean chardonnay
($18).
I lie wine came first, and it
was great. A few glasses were
sipped and a lot of my tenseness
dissipated.
Then came the escargot.
Trying escargot is for many the
Great Adventure. I always think
about the common garden vari
ety snail, with its antennae up,
trying to make its way through
life without getting stepped on
by oafs like you and me. Do the
chefs go out and gather up some

from hehinu the restaurant. I
wonder? My tears were laid to
rest at Pear Williams. It turns
out that escargot look very
similar to clanis. The texture is
similar, and the taste is pretty
much covered up by the accom
panying sauee.
Which hi ilitis us to the subject
of sauces. The French seem to
have a fascination with odd
combinations ot spices and
flavors, and all the sauces I
tasted that night were amazingly
delightful assaults on the taste
buds.
The soup was next. It was a
kind ot lukewarm garlic soup
that was uneventful, but the
salad was another story. The
"salad" consisted of lettuce
leases very lightly sprinkled
with an unknown dressing and
walnut shavings. The walnut
shavings were an interesting and
simple innovation, which
complemented the lettuce v cry
nicely.
Then there was quite a wait
for the main course. Which
brings us to another point: It
you're planning on going to a
French restaurant put aside at
least three hours. We waited 45
minutes between the salad and
the entree, which was a new ex
perience for a busboy who is
used to being sweated at in Ital
ian when the customer has to
wait more than five minutes be
tween the salad and main
course.
The main course arrived. My
God. I thought, what are these
two white sausages doing on my
plate? The waiter calmly in
formed me that that was,
indeed, the sweetbread.
I looked down at my plate
again. The two white sausages
looked like hemispheres of the
brain of some kind of animal.
They were swimming in a yellow
sauce. Maybe the sweetbread
part is stuffed inside of the
hemisphere. I thought. I cut one

open. No no. More white brainy
matter.
Calmly reminding mysell that
I had already eaten snails
tonight without noticeable
health disorders. I took .1 bite ot
the sweetbread. I lie texture was
very much like liver, except con
siderably less firm 111 consis
tence The taste was mostly cov
ered up by the mustard saucc.
which was very good.
Mv ruminations on the
wonders ot sweetbread were in
terrupted by my companion,
who asked me in a very com
panionable manner: "How's the
baby cow brain?"
"What?" I said.
"Are you enjoying your baby
cow brain?"
It doesn't really matter that
mv companion was being inex
act. I quickly discerned that
there was a reason my
sweetbread looked like it did. I
couldn't bring myself to eat any
more of it.and when the busboy
cleared the plates he gave me a
knowing look.
"A little too rich, huh." lie
said.
All of this is certainly not
meant to detract from the tasti
ness of the food at Pear Wil
liams. I or baby cows' thyroid
glands, the sweetbread was very
good. I'm sure. And my com
panion. who had a special dish
which was composed ot a beet
Wellington in a puffed pastry
with bearnaise sauce (SIS. I >s)
praised the tood all the way
home.
There's something to be said
for culinary adventure, but
there's very little to be said for
ignorant culinary adventure. It
you're looking tor a really nice
restaurant with reasonable
prices, try Pear Williams. But
please, ask the waiter to tell you
about the dishes. You won t
regret it.

la it.x pus: n, /. A social
blunder. 2. A mistake made by a
neophyte restaurant reviewer at a
French restaurant.
I slii uiil start oft this review. I
suppose, by saying that I've
spent plenty of time in restau
rants. As ,i bushoy. In fact, most
ot this time has been spent being
yelled at by boisterous waiters
whose conversations with me
usually consist of quick orders
such as: "Wipe seven, then two
BBs and two aquas on nine."
(Clear table seven, then bring
two bread and butter trays and
two glasses of water to table
nine.)
And these restaurants have
usually been Italian restaurants.
You know, spaghetti, pizza, fet
tucini. As American as a Chev
rolet.
Being an impoverished col
lege student. I jumped at the
chance to try something new.
I rench food: the land of Rodin.
Diderot. Sartre, de Gaulle, all
brought to your table in a
sumptuous compendium ot
delectable novelties. An experi
ment. an experience.
It turns out that the novelty
was a little bit more than I ex
pected. but we'll get to that
ater.

I should interject before I go
much further that Pear Wil
liams. the French restaurant
which was kind enough to assist
me in my culinary experiment, is
a wonderful place to dine. The
food is beautifully prepared and
the atmosphere is calm and
comfortable.
The issue here is embarrass
ment. And lots of it.
fancy restaurants scare me. I
usually dine at the kind of res
taurants that I worked for:
plenty ot food, bargain
basement prices, family-style,
casual atmosphere. I'm always
afraid when 1 eat at a fancy res
taurant that I'm doing the
wrong thing. Waiters can spot
an inexperienced diner a mile
away, and, unfortunately. I'm
painfully aware of that.
This is not to say that Pear
Williams is overly fancy. The
dining area is relatively small,
and the restaurant has a pleas
ant homey atmosphere. Fanci
ness is in the paranoia of the be
holder.
The hostess led us to our
seats, where this reviewer made
mistake No. 1. The hostess held
out a chair and I happily
plopped into it, blind to eti
quette. My companion laughed
pleasantly at my mistake while
the other guests in the restau
rant all seemed to be snickering
into their dinner napkins. I hid
behind my menu.
The menu was a pleasant

surprise. It is filled with entrees
with names that will horrify the
unilingual: "Mousseline de Co
quilles St. Jacques aux Beurre
Rouge" and "Carre d' Agneau
aux Herbes des Provences" are
two prime examples, l uckily.
Pear Williams has pity on
reviewers like this one: Facli
entree has a short explanatory
phrase printed in Fnglish.
The menu informed me that
my entree would be preceded by
soup and a salad. Reassured. I
scoured the list of 12 main
courses.
I was immediately attracted
to "Ris de Veau Moutardicr"
($14.50). The translation in
formed me that this dish is
composed of "braised veal
sweetbreads bathed in a light
mustard sauce in the style ot
nouvelle cuisine."
Visions of piles of thinly
sliced pieces of veal, accompa
nied by equally-attractive piles
of carrot cake, fruit cake and
sourdough bread coursed
through my mind. What arc
sweetbreads if not these
delicacies, thought I. And to top
it all off — mustard sauce! This
French food isn't half bad.
Well, 1 was, needless to say. a
very deluded man. Sweetbreads,
my hostess was to inform me on
the way out of the restaurant,
are the thyroid glands of a baby
cow. But for now . 1 was content

act. I quickly discerned that
there was a reason my
sweetbread looked like it did. I
couldn't bring myself to eat any
more of it.and when the busboy
cleared the plates he gave me a
knowing look.
"A little too rich, huh." lie
said.
All of this is certainly not
meant to detract from the tasti
ness of the food at Pear Wil
liams. I or baby cows' thyroid
glands, the sweetbread was very
good. I'm sure. And my com
panion. who had a special dish
which was composed ot a beet
Wellington in a puffed pastry
with bearnaise sauce (SIS. I >s)
praised the tood all the way
home.
There's something to be said
for culinary adventure, but
there's very little to be said for
ignorant culinary adventure. It
you're looking tor a really nice
restaurant with reasonable
prices, try Pear Williams. But
please, ask the waiter to tell you
about the dishes. You won t
regret it.
