## A 						mesmerizing 'Hair' makes for special spring night at Frost 
### NANCY HENRY 
WARNING: To all potential
producers of musicals at Stan
ford. A new standard of energy,
professionalism and overall ex
cellence has been set against
which all future performances
must be judged. The responsible
party is "Theatre in Progress,"
and its first success is "Hair."
The company must immedi
ately be commended for even
attempting "Hair" in Frost Am
phitheater, one of the most un
derused facilities on campus —
and not without reason. The dif
ficulties of producing such a
technically demanding show in
an outdoor theater are appar
ent, yet so are the benefits of
doing so successfully.
It is unfortunate that so much
of tbis weekend's four perfor
mances will depend on whether
the sound crew can work out the
numerous bugs that plagued

Tuesday's dress rehearsal:
screeching or humming
microphones, alternately fading
and blaring voices. Most prob
lems seemed easily correctable
and there is no reason to suspect
that all is not running
smoothly now. As for the
weather, we can only cross our
fingers and imagine how nice it
will be if nature cooperates.
Phis is a show and experience
that should not be missed.
To start with the basics, the
backbone of this production is
undoubtedly the band. Perched
above the stage action, conduc
tor Lita Liback and her
musicians establish a momen
tum with the now famous song
"Aquarius" and do not let up
until the last note of "Let the
Sun Shine In" in the final scene.
Steady rhythm and expert
timing characterize the accom
paniment which neither over

powers the singers nor allows
itself to be overpowered.
"Hair" is essentially a rapid se
ries of loosely connected musi
cal numbers, and it would fall to
pieces without a strong, depend
able hand to guide it. The
talented musicians in this case
provide that hand and do not
once permit "Hair" to go astray.
The vocals and the choreog
raphy share one important char
acteristic — both evenly
distribute the numerous respon
sibilities. That is, any one num
ber does not assume or depend
on the talents of any one actor
or actress. This is exciting and
refreshing to see at Stanford.
Everyone in this cast can sing.
Everyone can dance, and they
all do. Choreographer Amy
McDonald creates a "free,"
even chaotic atmosphere, ap
propriate to the theme and style
of the play as a whole. But she

maintains perfect symmetry on
stage and demands discipline
and control of her dancers. Tal
ent is abundant, yet not
Haunted. The dancing, like the
music, is both harmonious and
bursting with energy. As for the
singing, though some of the
soloists ran into trouble on slow
numbers such as "Oh Great
God of Power" and "Good
Morning, Starshine," when the
chorus took over, minor flaws
were soon forgotten. Clear and
powerful vocals assured the ef
fect of the undeniably brilliant
score.
Lighting is also a potential
problem in the open air of
Frost, but one the crew has
avoided and managed to turn
into a major, creative force in
the show. It is mesmerizing, al
most hypnotic when combined
with the song "Hare Krishna."

In "Walking in Space" it pro
vides an appropriately psych
edelic atmosphere for the
all-important "trip" scene. In
the finale ot "Eyes Look Your
Last," it is absolutely electrify
ing. Credit goes to master
electrician Mark Adolph and his
crew.
Credit for the innovative in

terpretation of a play that could
prove hopelessly dated despite
the quality of the music, goes to
director Lewis Anthony, whose
skill has been recruited from the
Palo Alto community by
"Theatre in Progress." in the
belief that interaction with the
community is necessary but of
ten lacking in Stanford produc

tions. Lewis has managed to
give contemporary artistic and
social relevance to the quest for
freedom, love and happiness
which the youth of the IMAUs
sought in protest of the Vietnam
War. Anthony has experi
mented with some Brechtian
techniques such as splitting
single roles in two. The spokes
man for radicalism. Berger, for
example, is played with equal
skill by both Andrew Buckley
and Bob Valdez. This and
similar innovations allow the
characters to speak universal
themes and prevent us from
identifying or sympathizing with
them as individuals. The univer
sality of the call for peace is em
phasized by the parallels
Anthony draws between the
Vietnam War and political
crises since, such as the Iranian
hostage situation and current
problems in El Salvador. For
tunately this aspect is not
overdone and some of the con
nections are subtle yet powerful.
Neither the music nor the
themes are out of place today
and a production such as "Hair"
deserves reinterpretations like
the one Anthony provides.
The gates at Frost will open at
6 p.m. before N p.m. perfor
mances today, tomorrow
and Sunday. It will be difficult
to resist the temptation of
taking a picnic dinner to enjoy
before the sun sets and a warm
blanket, heavy coat and/or good
friend for after it does. Weather
permitting, "Hair" will offer an
unforgettable evening of enter
tainment beneath the stars and
an ideal setting for a very special
spring night.


'Hair/ at Frost tonight
through Sunday, promises
an evening of energy and
talent, provided the wea
ther holds. Bring picnic,
blanket and friends.

sality of the call for peace is em
phasized by the parallels
Anthony draws between the
Vietnam War and political
crises since, such as the Iranian
hostage situation and current
problems in El Salvador. For
tunately this aspect is not
overdone and some of the con
nections are subtle yet powerful.
Neither the music nor the
themes are out of place today
and a production such as "Hair"
deserves reinterpretations like
the one Anthony provides.
The gates at Frost will open at
6 p.m. before N p.m. perfor
mances today, tomorrow
and Sunday. It will be difficult
to resist the temptation of
taking a picnic dinner to enjoy
before the sun sets and a warm
blanket, heavy coat and/or good
friend for after it does. Weather
permitting, "Hair" will offer an
unforgettable evening of enter
tainment beneath the stars and
an ideal setting for a very special
spring night.


'Hair/ at Frost tonight
through Sunday, promises
an evening of energy and
talent, provided the wea
ther holds. Bring picnic,
blanket and friends.

WARNING: To all potential
producers of musicals at Stan
ford. A new standard of energy,
professionalism and overall ex
cellence has been set against
which all future performances
must be judged. The responsible
party is "Theatre in Progress,"
and its first success is "Hair."
The company must immedi
ately be commended for even
attempting "Hair" in Frost Am
phitheater, one of the most un
derused facilities on campus —
and not without reason. The dif
ficulties of producing such a
technically demanding show in
an outdoor theater are appar
ent, yet so are the benefits of
doing so successfully.
It is unfortunate that so much
of tbis weekend's four perfor
mances will depend on whether
the sound crew can work out the
numerous bugs that plagued

Tuesday's dress rehearsal:
screeching or humming
microphones, alternately fading
and blaring voices. Most prob
lems seemed easily correctable
and there is no reason to suspect
that all is not running
smoothly now. As for the
weather, we can only cross our
fingers and imagine how nice it
will be if nature cooperates.
Phis is a show and experience
that should not be missed.
To start with the basics, the
backbone of this production is
undoubtedly the band. Perched
above the stage action, conduc
tor Lita Liback and her
musicians establish a momen
tum with the now famous song
"Aquarius" and do not let up
until the last note of "Let the
Sun Shine In" in the final scene.
Steady rhythm and expert
timing characterize the accom
paniment which neither over

powers the singers nor allows
itself to be overpowered.
"Hair" is essentially a rapid se
ries of loosely connected musi
cal numbers, and it would fall to
pieces without a strong, depend
able hand to guide it. The
talented musicians in this case
provide that hand and do not
once permit "Hair" to go astray.
The vocals and the choreog
raphy share one important char
acteristic — both evenly
distribute the numerous respon
sibilities. That is, any one num
ber does not assume or depend
on the talents of any one actor
or actress. This is exciting and
refreshing to see at Stanford.
Everyone in this cast can sing.
Everyone can dance, and they
all do. Choreographer Amy
McDonald creates a "free,"
even chaotic atmosphere, ap
propriate to the theme and style
of the play as a whole. But she

maintains perfect symmetry on
stage and demands discipline
and control of her dancers. Tal
ent is abundant, yet not
Haunted. The dancing, like the
music, is both harmonious and
bursting with energy. As for the
singing, though some of the
soloists ran into trouble on slow
numbers such as "Oh Great
God of Power" and "Good
Morning, Starshine," when the
chorus took over, minor flaws
were soon forgotten. Clear and
powerful vocals assured the ef
fect of the undeniably brilliant
score.
Lighting is also a potential
problem in the open air of
Frost, but one the crew has
avoided and managed to turn
into a major, creative force in
the show. It is mesmerizing, al
most hypnotic when combined
with the song "Hare Krishna."

In "Walking in Space" it pro
vides an appropriately psych
edelic atmosphere for the
all-important "trip" scene. In
the finale ot "Eyes Look Your
Last," it is absolutely electrify
ing. Credit goes to master
electrician Mark Adolph and his
crew.
Credit for the innovative in

terpretation of a play that could
prove hopelessly dated despite
the quality of the music, goes to
director Lewis Anthony, whose
skill has been recruited from the
Palo Alto community by
"Theatre in Progress." in the
belief that interaction with the
community is necessary but of
ten lacking in Stanford produc

tions. Lewis has managed to
give contemporary artistic and
social relevance to the quest for
freedom, love and happiness
which the youth of the IMAUs
sought in protest of the Vietnam
War. Anthony has experi
mented with some Brechtian
techniques such as splitting
single roles in two. The spokes
man for radicalism. Berger, for
example, is played with equal
skill by both Andrew Buckley
and Bob Valdez. This and
similar innovations allow the
characters to speak universal
themes and prevent us from
identifying or sympathizing with
them as individuals. The univer
sality of the call for peace is em
phasized by the parallels
Anthony draws between the
Vietnam War and political
crises since, such as the Iranian
hostage situation and current
problems in El Salvador. For
tunately this aspect is not
overdone and some of the con
nections are subtle yet powerful.
