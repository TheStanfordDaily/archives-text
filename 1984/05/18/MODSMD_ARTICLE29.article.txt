# Actors in 'Hamlet' production shine
## 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"So much for suspense." said the
gentleman sitting behind me. after the
opening moments of Charles Lyons'
"Hamlet." now running at little
Theatre. True enough, the Star Wurs
-style summary projected before am ac
tion occurred made it hard to keep the
audience uncertain about the play's
outcome. But this remarkable produc
tion of Shakespeare's most celebrated
tragedy went on to show how exciting a
play can be. even when it begins by put
ting the last scene first. During
"Hamlet s'" run this weekend and ncM
(May 16-19 and 23-26). Stanford
audiences have the opportunity to see an
astonishing young actor in the title role,
supported by a strong company in a
duction that makes up in power what it
lacks in coherence.
Lyons seems to have directed on two
principles: cultivate your actors'
strengths, regardless ol whether they fit
into a correct interpretation of the
and make "Hamlet" new. even if the
new version isn't dramatic. fortunately,
the talent of Lyons' actors has answered
the first principle splendidly, rescuing
him from the second's errors.
The play tends to break up into scenes
linked only by plot and script, which
show inadequate attention to developing,
character and to presenting a character
that is genuinely faithful to the words of
the play. Vet these scenes are powerful
and moving in themselves, and maintain
their energy enough so that the audi
ence's attention is retained through to
the finish. While Lyons' interpretation is
literary rather than dramatic, the human
material he had to work with couldn't be
stifled by his fiddling with the play.
Apart from cutting, which is necessary
and acceptable in a play as long as
"Hamlet." Lyons' interpretation is,
laudably, well-centered and focused on a
single conceit. The theater lights go
down, and on a sheet of plexiglass
suspended centerstage a short summary
of the action leading up to play is
projected, while narration is piped in.
But then this text continues to resume
the action of the play that we have yet to
see. It was at this point that my neighbor
said, "So much for suspense." But there
was more to come. The sheet of
plexiglass is drawn up, and the actors as
semble for the last scene, the duel be
tween Hamlet and Laertes.
The actors carry out an abbreviated
version of the fencing bout and its bloody
outcome, through to the point at which

I ortinbras enters anil calls tor an expla
nation ol the events leading up to the
gruesome scene. Horatio's lines have
him ask that the bodies be displayed
"high on a stage" so that he can stand
over them and justify his friend Hamlet's
actions. I'he plexiglass screen is lowered
again, and we now see the title
"Horatio's Story about the Tragedy of
Hamlet. Prince of Denmark." In the
"new" play, the Horatio of the final
scene takes over the role of Hamlet, and
the Hamlet of the "pre-play" acts as
Horatio.
Clever. Ingenious. But is it an inter
pretation that shows us anything new
about the characters or the action? Is it
even a reading that will be apparent
during the performance? No. Lyons has
the germ ol an idea that could be
developed into an independent work
similar to Tom Stoppard's " Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are Dead," but the
only thing to remind us. a* we sec the
performance, that the play is being given
it new twist is the that Hamlet (who
is 'reallv" Horatio) wears in all the
scenes except ins soliloquies
It's fortunate that Lyous' sophisticated
reading doesn't assert itsel! too much in
the performance, because it could have
hobbled Andre K. Braugher. the Horatio
who plays Hamlet. B\ coincidence, the
only other prcf\ I've seen Braughci in was
"Cyclops." in which he was also masked
throughout the evening In both perfor
mances. the mask was no hindrance In all
to tins very physical actor..Braugher has
tremendous energy. tc*mpejed by the
comfort he obviously feels on stage. His
movements, big and small, arc expressive
and direct, and his voice, tool proie&%j
supple power that invites the audience to
be taken up in the passions he acts out
The vigor and passions of Braugher s
acting carry this production of
"Hamlet," but they are often at ofUJs
with the character as Shakespeare wrote
him. Hamlet is a melancholic, obsesseu
with grief for his father and his need for
revenge. Though melancholy, as Shake
speare's contemporaries conceived it,
can be expressed many ways, it conflicts
with the consistent violence and anger
that burst from Braugher's Hamlet.
Given the success with which this pro
duction works its effect on the audience,
however, this is a quibble. I will note that
I felt some dissatisfaction with the big
ness of Braugher's acting, but merely on
the grounds of taste, and not for reasons
of coherence. The soliloquies, except for
the "sullied flesh" speech, tended to start

out with expressive moderation, and
then stray toward the verge of ranting
(superb ranting, though, when they did
get that tar). What was surprising about
Braugher was that he plaved very well
with other actors, and did not upstage
even the weaker members ol the east.
I lie significant roles besides Hamlet
were generally well-filled. Steve Fuller,
w ho played Hamlet in the opening scene,
took on the role of Horatio, but did not
wear a mask. Fuller seems born to pla\
this role, and I regretted the radical cut
ting ot the gravedigger scene, which con
tributed to a puzzling de-emphasis o! the
character who was presumably telling a
story in which lie took part.
Ophelia, played by the versatile
Andrea Shea, came across convincingly
and showed a subtlety I would have liked
|to see more widespread. She lias atr ad
mirable finesse ot expression, but should
beware ol upstaging the other actors
when she is not speaking. This occurred
in the scene ot Polonius' parting advice
to Laertes. S. David Brazer's Polonius
was tunny and sympathetic, but perhaps
too much a tool and not enough an old
man. Paolo Morante. as Laertes, may
have cause tor anger and tension, but
ought to loosen up on stage.
As tor the last two major characters.
Gertrude and Claudius, I found Lisa
Grabemann's acting interesting and
promising, but I was puzzled by the
misapplied vehemence of Graham Win
ton. Grabemann showed conviction and
a good sense of emphasis, especially in
her scene alone with Braugher. In the
'Court scenes I found her work less satis
fying. as was the case with Winton and all
the courtiers. Winton is powerful in a
way thai highlights the superiority of
Braugher,#it least in this play, for Win
ton tended |o rely on abrupt changes of
tone and passion to introduce variety,
without delivering persuasive expression
at the same time. His soliloquies were
handled in a more approriate vein for a
politic king with something to hide.
I should warn readers that this is a long
production, but "Hamlet" is always long.
I would also them not to despair
at the pacing proffiijiis of the first act — I
find the remark "slowgoing at El Snore"
in my notes — for things pick up a great
deal once Braugher gets going. Despite
the interpretive weaknesses of Lyons'
production, I heartily recommend this
"Hamlet" as a tremendous showcase for
several excellent actors.
