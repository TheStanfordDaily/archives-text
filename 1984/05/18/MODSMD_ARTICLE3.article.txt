"Lying in a ditch in LI Salvador or Nicaragua
with bullets Hying around you ... is a hell of a lot
different than sitting in my offices at the Los An
geles Times in a nice, cool air-conditioned envi
ronment," Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial writer
Frank Del Olmo said here last night.
Del Omo and other panelists called the media a
"human institution" at a Tennan Audiionum_cou
ferenee on the media, foreign policy and Latin
America, which attracted about 200 people. The
other panelists included Mauri Moore, a field
producer for NBC News: Dan Hallin, a U.C.-San
Diego political science professor; and Mike Skol. a
U.S. State Department official.
Panel members shared a general consensus that
the media is doing the best it can under the difficult
constraints of foreign news coverage. Skol. cur
rently deputy director of Policy Planning for the
Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, said the press
has a substantial influence on U.S. policy deci
sions.
"It's stupid to form a policy on Nicaragua with
out taking into account the (U.S.) media reaction
to it. Policies do not take place in a vacuum, he
said. .
But the result is often that government policies
respond first to a potentially adverse media rection
rather than an actual event, even one ot dramatic
importance, according to Skol. He cited a recent

Andean drought that was not addressed ade
quately by either our government or the media un
til it was too late to take effective action.
Hallin said that a journalist's "world view" plays

an important part in how lie or she covers a story

Mike Skol, from the U.S. State Department, and Mauri Moore, from NBC news, discuss news
coverage in Latin America last night in Terman Auditorium.
gerously is an accurate portrayal of the
frustrations of a foreign news assign
ment.
Hall in and Moore agreed that we
are currently in a watershed period for
international news coverage.
"This period is a very pivotal one."
Hallin said. "The Cold War consensus
has lost its hold . . . and public con
sciousness is likely to he formed
during this period."
He urged U.S. citizens — journalists

and others — not to succumb to a
"fortress America" isolationism or a
bipolar view ol the world that posits
evcrvthing in terms ol democracy
\ersus totalitarianism. He objected to
the notion held by some citizens that
the United States is an "island ol
civilization."
And Moore pointed out that lew
correspondents are stationed in
Central and South America as
compared to Europe. The news execu
tives in New York, who control much
of the industry, "like to take their
vacations in Europe. No one vacations
in I Honduras." she said.
