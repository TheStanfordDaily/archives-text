"Lying in a ditch in LI Salvador or Nicaragua
with bullets Hying around you ... is a hell of a lot
different than sitting in my offices at the Los An
geles Times in a nice, cool air-conditioned envi
ronment," Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial writer
Frank Del Olmo said here last night.
Del Omo and other panelists called the media a
"human institution" at a Tennan Audiionum_cou
ferenee on the media, foreign policy and Latin
America, which attracted about 200 people. The
other panelists included Mauri Moore, a field
producer for NBC News: Dan Hallin, a U.C.-San
Diego political science professor; and Mike Skol. a
U.S. State Department official.
Panel members shared a general consensus that
the media is doing the best it can under the difficult
constraints of foreign news coverage. Skol. cur
rently deputy director of Policy Planning for the
Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, said the press
has a substantial influence on U.S. policy deci
sions.
"It's stupid to form a policy on Nicaragua with
out taking into account the (U.S.) media reaction
to it. Policies do not take place in a vacuum, he
said. .
But the result is often that government policies
respond first to a potentially adverse media rection
rather than an actual event, even one ot dramatic
importance, according to Skol. He cited a recent

Andean drought that was not addressed ade
quately by either our government or the media un
til it was too late to take effective action.
Hallin said that a journalist's "world view" plays

an important part in how lie or she covers a story
He sanl the recent movie /7iÂ«* Year of Living Hun
