I lie I oshiko Aki\ oshi lew
riihiikin Big Band will he
making an exclusive Ba\ Area
appearanee at the Stanford
I heal re in downtown Palo Alto
Monday night. Formed 111 l.os
Angeles 111 1973. this engage
ment marks the hand's debut
performance in the Mas Area.
Since receiving national atten
tion in 1 4 >75 at the Monterev
Ja// I cstival. this luishand wile
led hig hand has heen
nominated tor tour Grammy
awards and has topped the
Downheat magazine readers'
poll live times in the hig hand
category.
In addition to these hig hand
honors. Akiyoshi was voted hest
composer and hest arranger in
hoth the readers' poll and the
Downheat international ja//
critics poll. Last year Akiyoshi
and husband Tabakin moved to
New York to form a new band.
This East Coast hand has already
gained popularity as a match for
the West Coast band and is con
sidered to be better in some
respects. According to Tabakin.
it is considerably tighter than
the old band.
Putting a band together in the
East after liv ing in the West for
10 years was no easy task,
however. "Most of the players I
had known were off doing other
things," explains Tabakin. "We
had to see who the guys were in
town." The fact that Akiyoshi
and Tabakin have so success
fully brought the "guys in town"
together to form such an out
standing group attests to their
capabilities as leaders in the jazz
world.
Akiyoshi was born in
Manchuria in 1929 and moved
to Japan with her parents after
World War 11. She took her first
dance band gig, despite her par
ents' efforts to discourage her,
at the age of 17 and soon
worked her way to becoming
the highest-paid studio musician
in Japan. She came to the
United States in 1956 and
began playing in her own trio as
well as spending a year in
Charles Mingus' band in 1962.
Her compositions are a synthe

sis ot Japanese music and West
ern jazz, til which she is gener
ally acknowledged as the finest
jazz arranger and composer in
the world.
Born in Philadelphia.
Tabackin. is internationally
recognized as one ot the finest
tenor saxophone players in the
world and is principal soloist for
the hand on tenor and flute.
Tabackin was 112 irst influenced by
the playing of Al Colin, and the
influences of Sonny Rollins and
Ben Webster can be heard in his
playing. Tabackin describes it as
an unconscious effort:
"Sometimes I'll be playing and
Sonny just creeps in."
Tabaekin's work 011 flute,
however, is completely his own
and shows its true colors partic
ularly in Akiyoshi's composi
tions.
Akiyoshi's compositions are
as personal as Tabaekin's flute
playing. The band's music is not
only outstanding but also com
pletely original. While most big
bands, such as the great Count
Basie band or the Woodie Her
man band, play some original
compositions along with differ
ent arrangements of various
composers' music, the
Akiyoshi/Tabackin band plays
only Akiyoshi's music. These

arrangements are intricate and
unusual — Toshiko combines
changes in tempo and mood ef
fectively and never osten
tatiously. She achieves exotic ef
fects with unusual voieings: for
example, two flutes, two
clarinets and a hass clarinet
combine in a tight ensemble.
"We don't like to give the audi
ence all ice cream, explains
Tabackin. "The music is a fu
sion. in the true sense ot the
word, of Toshiko s Japanese in
fluences and the jazz medium."
Few other bands could handle
the challenge which Akiyoshi's
diverse arrangements present.
Indeed, almost every player
doubles on at least two instru
ments. while the age range in
the band spans from 1 7 to 60.
Monday night's performance
will bring some ol the excite
ment of New York jaz/ to the
Bay Area and should prove
dynamic for the jazz enthusiast
and casual music lover alike.
The Stanford Theatre will swing
to a different tune as "jazz goes
to college."
The Stanford Theatre is offer
ing discounted seating to Stan
ford students with ID. Students
are eligible lor a $4 savings on
best-available seating the day of
the concert.

only outstanding but also com
pletely original. While most big
bands, such as the great Count
Basie band or the Woodie Her
man band, play some original
compositions along with differ
ent arrangements of various
composers' music, the
Akiyoshi/Tabackin band plays
only Akiyoshi's music. These

arrangements are intricate and
unusual — Toshiko combines
changes in tempo and mood ef
fectively and never osten
tatiously. She achieves exotic ef
fects with unusual voieings: for
example, two flutes, two
clarinets and a hass clarinet
combine in a tight ensemble.
"We don't like to give the audi
ence all ice cream, explains
Tabackin. "The music is a fu
sion. in the true sense ot the
word, of Toshiko s Japanese in
fluences and the jazz medium."
Few other bands could handle
the challenge which Akiyoshi's
diverse arrangements present.
Indeed, almost every player
doubles on at least two instru
ments. while the age range in
the band spans from 1 7 to 60.
Monday night's performance
will bring some ol the excite
ment of New York jaz/ to the
Bay Area and should prove
dynamic for the jazz enthusiast
and casual music lover alike.
The Stanford Theatre will swing
to a different tune as "jazz goes
to college."
The Stanford Theatre is offer
ing discounted seating to Stan
