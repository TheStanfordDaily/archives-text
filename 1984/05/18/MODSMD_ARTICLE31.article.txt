The Leopard (1963)
Bijou. Palo Alto
In its full-length version (not
shown in this country until
19X3), Luchino Visconti's
chronicle of the last days of the
Sicilian aristocracy in the mid
19th century runs 3 hours and 25
minutes, and perhaps no one
else in the history of movies has
made so sensuous an epic — or,
until Coppola and The Godfat
her, one so literate and complex.
(Visconti wrote his own script,
adapting the famous novel by
Giuseppe de Lampedusa.) Vis
conti enables us to taste the
pleasures of the nobility before a
united, bourgeois Italy alters
them forever. In one scene,
Alain Delon, as the dashing ad
venturer nephew of the aging
nobleman Don Fabrizio (Burt
Lancaster), returns from
Garibaldi's revolution with some
other young soldiers; the revolu
tionaries are so overwhelmed by
the seductive old world gracious
ness of Fabrizio's home that they
lose their bearings. The title
comes from one of Fabrizio's
lines about the aristocracy: "We
were the leopards, the lions, and
those who replace us will be
jackals, hyenas; and all of us —
leopards, lions, jackals, sheep —
will think we're the salt of the
earth." Burt Lancaster is mag
nificent as the clear-eyed realist
Fabrizio, especially in the last
hour, when the movie cul
minates in a ball — the wedding
of Delon and the bourgeoise
played by Claudia Cardinale
(fiery and vital, she leaves no
doubt in our minds that the
bourgeoisie will survive), which
represents the end of Fabrizio's
world. This superb final hour
recalls the films of Max Ophuls,
but Visconti is as romantic as
Ophuls was baroque.
Photographed by Giuseppe
Rotunno, with a lush, operatic
score by Nino Rota.
Plays Tuesday.
Citizen Kane (1941)
Kresge Auditorium
Orson Welles was only in his
mid-2()s when he came to Holly
wood to make this film, but he
had already established himself
as an enfant terrible on Broad
way and on radii). The bristling,
vibrant feeling of the picture is
due in part to the youthfulness of
most of the people who col
laborated on it (only the
screenwriter, Herman J.
Mankiewicz. had been working
in movies for long) and in part to
the subject: publisher William
Randolph Hearst, who was still
very much alive. An extraordi
nary movie. With a Mercury
Theater cast: Welles as Kane,
Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Com
ingore. Ruth Warrick, Agnes
Moo re head, Eivcrett Sloane.
Photographed by Gregg Toland.
Plays tonight at 9.
Sudden Impact (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
Clint Eastwood, as director
and star, provides the Dirty
Harry package with a new bow.

The murderess (Sondra Locke)
Harry Callahan — one-man
vigilante crew, dedicated hater
of criminals ("scum," in Harry's
jargon), modern cowboy of su
perhuman skill and strength — is
trying to track down is exacting a
gruesome revenge on the punks
who raped her and her sister
years ago. So this time around
it's the victims who are the scum,
and in a sense the Locke charac
ter is Harry's double. This movie
takes Dirty Harrydom to such an
extreme that you wonder if you
aren't watching a parody, but

one glance at Clint Eastwood's
face convinces you that the
parody is unconscious. Sudden
Impact, which is more inept than
offensive, contains the most
laughable collection of support
ing performances since the
heyday of Republic Pictures.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9; 30.
Two Daughters (1961)
Terman Auditorium
One of the great film experi
ences. Satyajit Ray filmed three
short stories by Rabindranath
Tagore, India's great national
tresure, but the second one
(which is of a supernatural na
ture) has only rarely been seen
seen in this country; this print,
like most, contains only

"Postmaster" and "Samapti." In
"Postmaster," Anil Chatterjee
plays a young man, stationed as
postmaster in a remote village
against his will, who develops a
touching, intimate friendship
with his servant, a 10-year-old
orphan girl (C'handana Baner
jee). When he gets the transfer
he has been asking for, he
doesn't realize the betrayal she
feels until, meeting him on the
road, she holds her face away
from his querying eyes and walks
past him without saying a word.
(It is one of the most
heartbreaking moments in world
cinema.) In "Samapti," Ray's fa
vorite actor, Soumitra Chatter
jee, plays a bridegroom and
Aparna Das Gupta the rebel
lious tomboy he marries; the
story — like one section in Ray's
earlier The World of Apu (which
also starred Chatterjee) —
centers on the delicate tensions
of the early days of marriage.
Plays Saturday evening at
7:30.
Bringing Up Baby (1938)
History Corner, Room 2
Katharine Hepburn (as a daffy
heiress), Cary Grant (as a
paleontologist) and twin
leopards, one of which responds
to a chorus of "I Can't Give You
Anything but Love, Baby," star
in this Howard Hawks classic —
everyone's favorite screwball
comedy. Some sequences, like
the one in which Hepburn
swings on a jail cell door and
tells the company, "They call me

Swinging Door Susie," are so
hilarious that you chuckle over
them in private for years, though
it isn't easy to explain why to
someone who hasn't seen the
movie. Dudley Nichols and
Hagar Wilde wrote the script,
which is performed by a tip-top
cast including May Robson,
Charles Ruggles. Walter Catlett.
Fritz Feld, Jonathan Hale and
Barry Fitzgerald.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.
Band of Outsiders (1964)
Bijou, Palo Alto
"My story ends here like a
dime novel," says the narrator of
Jean-Luc Godard's film, "at a
superb moment, when every
thing's going right." This ex
traordinary, lyrical movie is a
rhapsody on cheap gangster
melodramas: The trio of
protagonists (Claude Brasseur,
Sami Frey and Anna Karina)
fantasize committing a robbery
in the style of cheap detective
fiction and then, astonishingly,
carry it out. The confusion of
style and action is characteristic
ally Godardian, but it has never
been so richly worked out — not
even in his landmark film,
Breathless. Godard wrote his
own script, based on Dolores
Hitchens' Fool's Gold, and he
speaks the narration, which is
both humorously self-conscious
and genuinely poetic. (When his
heroes enter the subway, we are
told. "They descended to the
center of the earth.")
Photographed by Raoul
Coutard, with music by Michel
Legrand.
Plays Wednesday with A Nous
la Liberie.
A Nous la Liberie (1931)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Rene Clair's great social
satirical comedy — gentle and
lyrical, but with sharp, stunning
Art Deco sets (by Lazare Meer
son). Raymond Cordy and Henri
Marchand play prison buddies
who are reunited years later
when life has placed them on op
posite sides of the class fence:
Cordy now runs a photograph

factory and Marchand works on
the assembly line, like Chaplin in
Modern Times. (It is widely
known that Clair's film spawned
Chaplin's, but seeing it won't
make you like Modern Times
any less.) A Nous la Liberie ap
proaches perfection, and
Georges Auric's score is so
sweetly infectious that you find
yourself humming it months
later, with no apparent provoca
tion. Shot (beautifully) by
Georges Perinal.
Plays Wednesday with Hand
of Outsiders.
Cutter's Way (19H1)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Originally titled Cutter and
Bone, Jeffrey Alan Fiskin's
script (out of a Richard
Thornburg novel) revolves
around an embittered Vietnam
vet (Alex Cutter, overplayed by
John Heard) and his best friend
(Rich Bone, played by Jeff
Bridges), whom he involves in a
crazy scheme to locate a mur
derer. Though the movie has a
very dense, hard-to-remember
plot (for most of the movie we
don't know if Cutter's accusa
tions are just paranoid fantasy),
the director, Ivan Passer, tries
for a surreal style and a jarring,
out-of-sync feeling in some se
quences (the opening credits are
amazing); the movie is saturated
with melancholia. Unfortun
ately, the characters never
lighten up, and you realize
you've landed on a dead-end
street within the first five
minutes. With Lisa Eichhorn,
employing a tiny tremolo as Cut
ter's wife, Stephen Elliott, Ann
Dusenberry and Nina Van Pal
landt in a cameo; beautifully
shot by Jordan Cronenweth.
Plays Monday with Streamers.
His Girl Friday (1940)
Festival, Palo Alto
Charles Lederer wrote this
adaptation of the great Hecht-
Mac Arthur comedy about
newspapermen, which had
already been filmed once, trium
phantly, in 1931, with Adolphe
Menjou and Pat O'Brien. (Billy
Wilder ground out a third ver
sion in 1974 with Walter Mat
thau and Jack Lemmon.) For
this one, ace reporter Hildy
Johnson underwent a sex change
and became Rosalind Russell, so
that the relationship between
Hildy and the boss, tyrannical
Walter Burns (Cary Grant),
could have a romantic angle, ft
sounds like a terrible idea, but it
works: Russell and Grant have
never been better, and Howard
Hawks' direction moves the ac
tion along at such breakneck
speed that the audience is out of
breath at the end of the picture.

(This is a very early example of
the use of overlapping dialogue.)
Co-starring Ralph Bellamy,
Ciene Lockhart, Porter Hall,
Ernest Truex. Cliff ("Ukelele
Ike") Edwards. Roscoe Karns,
John Qualen, Helen Mack and
others.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Talk of the Town.
Streamers (19H3)
New Varsity. Palo Alto
Like David Rabe's other two
Vietnam plays, this one — which
actually takes place in a stateside
barracks — concerns itself with
the inadequacy of role models
for American men. both in and
out of the army. The young men
in this movie seem tentative,
semi-formed, not only as sol
diers but as human beings, and
the non-commissioned officers
in their outfits are battle-scarred
melancholies on a perpetual
binge. Their violent, obscene
war stories titillate the novice
soldiers but offer them no direc
tion — or worse, the wrong kind
of direction. It's an amazing stew
of a play, struggling to say some
thing about the way racial ten
sions get started, and about
homophobia, too, but it doesn't
work as a play and it doesn't
work as a movie, either, despite
the talented young actors in the
cast (David Alan Grier, Mitchell
Lichtenstein, Matthew Modine,
Michael Wright), and despite the
efforts of the director, Robert
Altman. In fact, it's very tough
to sit through — but it doesn't
make you despair; it's an honest
failure.
Plays Monday with Culler's
Way.
All That Jazz (1979) •
Bijou, Palo Alto
Perhaps the most dazzling dis
play of ego ever attempted by a
motion picture director. Roy
Scheider gives a solid, energetic
performance as Joe Gideon
(read Bob Fosse), a musical
comedy wizard who is running
himself down by simultaneously
rehearsing a Broadway show
(read Chicago), editing a big
budgeted movie (read Lenny)
and keeping up warm relation
ships with his mistress (Ann
Reinking), his ex-wife and
leading lady (Leland Palmer),
and his daughter (Erzsebet
Foldi), while indulging in oc
casional flings with aspiring star
lets. Although he philanders, he
can't seem to help himself:
Everywhere he goes, women
fling themselves at him. Besides,
he's so talented. Bob Fosse di
rected and choreographed this
musical drama about himself,
and his gifts are everywhere in
evidence — it's beautifully
made, and two of the numbers
(the opening and the erotic
piece) are classics — but the
entire project may give you
pause. Giuseppe Rotunno did
the superior cinematography.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
dav with Star 80.
