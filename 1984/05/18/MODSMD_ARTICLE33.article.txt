S But you shouldn't break a Date,
C even if he does wear a "Members
r Only" jacket, and before long he
) hatched another plan. Sources say

Date's latest power play was en
gineered in the deepest bowels of
The Daily — the opinions office,
where angr\ leftists conspire to
throw rugs, fraternities and other
emblems ot American decadence
off campus.
In the past. Date has been
accused of dictatorial practices in
the ops department, where all writ
ers must conform to the 57-
character. double-spaced, typed
standard.
"That sucks!" Date claims. "Only
a reactionary mind could invent
sueh a complaint. And I got rid of

the USW letterhead months ago."
Political analysts have suggested
that labor's support in the cam
paign may have pushed Date over
the top. Said California Sen. Alan
Cranston. Date's unofficial cam
paign manager, who made a
surprise appearance at The Daily
last evening to toast the victory: "If
only one of us was fated for suc
cess, I'm glad it was you." Presi
dent Reagan was unavailable for
comment.
Date, probably best known for
his earthshaking front-page stories,
revealed in an exclusive interview

with 1 he Daily that his original in
tention in running tor editor was to
gain eontrol of the sports depart
ment. "I really love baseball, and
they won't let me cover it all." he
complained. "Winning the editor
ship seemed to me the politically
expedient way to change all that.
But then I realized that there are
other advantages to being editor:
No one will expect me to get up
before 1 I a.m."
Congratulations, Shirish. We'll
improve your taste before you
leave the editor's chair. After all.
vou too were Born to Run.
