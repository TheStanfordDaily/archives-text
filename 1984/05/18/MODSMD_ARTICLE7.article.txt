Commission knocks Reagan's
policy on Central America
Washington — A I S.-Latin American study group warned
yesterday that Central America is "sliding toward wider war"
and charged that the Reagan administration's policies are
contributing to the danger.
The Inter-American Dialogue, a group of 50 prominent
figures from North and South America, condemned'U.S.
covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels, called for negotiations with
I I Salvador's leftist guerrillas and charged that the adminis
tration has given the Contadora peace talks support that
amounts only to "lip service."
"The dangers of regional war and expanded outside in
volvement are rising." the report said. We fear that a wider
conflagration could break out it the escalation of violence is
not soon reversed."
The panel includes former Secretaries of State Cyrus Vance
and Edmund Muskie. former Defense Secretaries Robert
McNamara and Elliot Richardson. Panamanian President
elect Nicolas Ardito Barletta. former presidents ol Ecuador
and Costa Rica and 10 former Latin American Cabinet minis
ters It was led by Sol Linowitz, one of the U.S. negotiators of
the Panama Canal treaties, and Galo Plaza Lasso, a former
president of Ecuador.
Linowitz said the report "is not intended to be confronta
tional." But he made it clear that the panel was deeply dis
turbed by the basic direction of the administration's policies
in the area.
Court orders desegregation
San Francisco A federal appeals court y esterday ordered
steps to integrate the San Jose Unified School District, saying
district trustees have "consistently maintained or intensified
segregation" since 1962.
The district's board "deliberately ignored state guidelines
in making decisions and consistently refused to implement
suggestions for desegregation." the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said in an 8-3 decision.
The court ruled in favor of parents of Spanish-surnamed
students who filed suit in J 971.
District officials and its attorney. Michael di Leonardo,
refused to comment on the decision until they had reviewed
it. Di Leonardo said any decision to appeal further would be
up to board members. The attorney for the plaintiffs was out
of his office yesterday.
Senate approves budget plan
Washington — Stirring from nearly four weeks of slumber,
the Senate on yesterday approved a three-year. $144 billion
down payment plan endorsed by President Reagan for trim
ming federal budget deficits.
On a critical 65-32 vote, the Senate cleared the way for
passage of the election-year proposal that provides equal
doses of higher taxes, domestic spending cuts and a curb on
planned increases in military spending.
There were 53 Republicans joining with 12 Democrats in
support while 32 Democrats voted against it.
A final vote of 74-23 simply affirmed the earlier tally.
Sen. Law ton Chiles (D-Fla.) the top Democrat on the Sen
ate Budget Committee, reflecting the feelings of several
Democrats, said he reluctantly switched from "no" on the
earlier test vote to "yes" on the final tally because this mea
sure was the "last hope for having any spending reduction"
this year.
The package that Reagan worked out with senior Senate
Republican leaders in March and announced in a White
House Rose Garden ceremony calls for about $4<S billion in
tax increases.
Militia raids refugee camp
Beirut, Lebanon — A Palestinian woman was shot and
killed yesterday by a member of an Israeli-supported militia
as violence continued for a second day in a Palestinian
refugee camp on the outskirts of the port city of Sidon.
The woman was killed during a demonstration in the Ein el
Hilwa camp against Israeli troops and a militia they control
named the Home Guard. The day before, Israeli troops and
militiamen dynamited and destroyed a number of houses
during a search for weapons in the same camp, about 25 miles
south of here in the Israeli-occupied section of Lebanon.
An informed source here said that six persons were injured
in Wednesday's operation, including one hit by a bullet. It
was reported Wednesday by camp residents that about 20
people were hurt.
A U.N. spokesman, as well as other usually reliable
sources, said that the Israelis were not involved in yesterday's
fatal shooting. They said that the Home Guard, a militia
trained and supplied by the Israelis, was responsible. The
militia's job is to maintain order within the camp, where
about 26,000 Palestinian refugees are registered by the U.N.

House votes down nerve gas
Washington — The House turned aside a last-minute plea
from President Reagan yesterday and refused for the third
straight year to allow the Pentagon to buy chemicals and
other material needed to resume U.S. production of nerve
gas.
The 247-179 vote trimmed the $95 billion nerve gas plan
from the $207.2 billion defense authorization bill for fiscal
1985.
Reagan, trying to end a 15-year moratorium on such pur
chases. argued that the weapons were needed to replace an
inadequate stockpile and to prod the Soviet Union into a
chemical weapons agreement with the United States.
Reagan wants to replace the current chemical weapons
supply, which consists of munitions that contain lethal gas,
with an arsenal made up of two relatively harmless chemicals
that would become deadly only when they are combined.
Internees file suit too late
Washington — Saying it was filed 30 or 40 years too late, a
federal judge here yesterday dismissed a multibillion-dollar
damage suit brought against the government by Japanese
Americans interned during World War II in relocation camps
in the United States.
U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer said the law
suit is barred by a six-year statute of limitations on suits
against the government. Oberdorfer said "it may be that
timelv claims" would have been successful. The government's
rationale for interning 120.000 citizens and residents
"because of their race" now appears "questionable." he said.
But. he concluded. "Much time has passed, memories have
dimmed and many of the actors have died."
Investors nervous as Dow falls
New York — The stock market retreated broadly and
sharply yesterday amid investor nervousness about the poten
tial fallout from the financial problems facing a major bank in
Chicago.
Technology, financial and airline issues led the losers, while
a few oil stocks rose.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which edged up
2.30 on Wednesday to break a string of three losing sessions,
plunged 10.89 points to 1 142.27. It was the lowest close since
April 11. when it hit I 130.97.

Commission knocks Reagan's
policy on Central America
Washington — A I S.-Latin American study group warned
yesterday that Central America is "sliding toward wider war"
and charged that the Reagan administration's policies are
contributing to the danger.
The Inter-American Dialogue, a group of 50 prominent
figures from North and South America, condemned'U.S.
covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels, called for negotiations with
I I Salvador's leftist guerrillas and charged that the adminis
tration has given the Contadora peace talks support that
amounts only to "lip service."
"The dangers of regional war and expanded outside in
volvement are rising." the report said. We fear that a wider
conflagration could break out it the escalation of violence is
not soon reversed."
The panel includes former Secretaries of State Cyrus Vance
and Edmund Muskie. former Defense Secretaries Robert
McNamara and Elliot Richardson. Panamanian President
elect Nicolas Ardito Barletta. former presidents ol Ecuador
and Costa Rica and 10 former Latin American Cabinet minis
ters It was led by Sol Linowitz, one of the U.S. negotiators of
the Panama Canal treaties, and Galo Plaza Lasso, a former
president of Ecuador.
Linowitz said the report "is not intended to be confronta
tional." But he made it clear that the panel was deeply dis
turbed by the basic direction of the administration's policies
in the area.
Court orders desegregation
San Francisco A federal appeals court y esterday ordered
steps to integrate the San Jose Unified School District, saying
district trustees have "consistently maintained or intensified
segregation" since 1962.
The district's board "deliberately ignored state guidelines
in making decisions and consistently refused to implement
suggestions for desegregation." the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said in an 8-3 decision.
The court ruled in favor of parents of Spanish-surnamed
students who filed suit in J 971.
District officials and its attorney. Michael di Leonardo,
refused to comment on the decision until they had reviewed
it. Di Leonardo said any decision to appeal further would be
up to board members. The attorney for the plaintiffs was out
of his office yesterday.
Senate approves budget plan
Washington — Stirring from nearly four weeks of slumber,
the Senate on yesterday approved a three-year. $144 billion
down payment plan endorsed by President Reagan for trim
ming federal budget deficits.
On a critical 65-32 vote, the Senate cleared the way for
passage of the election-year proposal that provides equal
doses of higher taxes, domestic spending cuts and a curb on
planned increases in military spending.
There were 53 Republicans joining with 12 Democrats in
support while 32 Democrats voted against it.
A final vote of 74-23 simply affirmed the earlier tally.
Sen. Law ton Chiles (D-Fla.) the top Democrat on the Sen
ate Budget Committee, reflecting the feelings of several
Democrats, said he reluctantly switched from "no" on the
earlier test vote to "yes" on the final tally because this mea
sure was the "last hope for having any spending reduction"
this year.
The package that Reagan worked out with senior Senate
Republican leaders in March and announced in a White
House Rose Garden ceremony calls for about $4<S billion in
tax increases.
Militia raids refugee camp
Beirut, Lebanon — A Palestinian woman was shot and
killed yesterday by a member of an Israeli-supported militia
as violence continued for a second day in a Palestinian
refugee camp on the outskirts of the port city of Sidon.
The woman was killed during a demonstration in the Ein el
Hilwa camp against Israeli troops and a militia they control
named the Home Guard. The day before, Israeli troops and
militiamen dynamited and destroyed a number of houses
during a search for weapons in the same camp, about 25 miles
south of here in the Israeli-occupied section of Lebanon.
An informed source here said that six persons were injured
in Wednesday's operation, including one hit by a bullet. It
was reported Wednesday by camp residents that about 20
people were hurt.
A U.N. spokesman, as well as other usually reliable
sources, said that the Israelis were not involved in yesterday's
fatal shooting. They said that the Home Guard, a militia
trained and supplied by the Israelis, was responsible. The
militia's job is to maintain order within the camp, where
about 26,000 Palestinian refugees are registered by the U.N.

House votes down nerve gas
Washington — The House turned aside a last-minute plea
from President Reagan yesterday and refused for the third
straight year to allow the Pentagon to buy chemicals and
other material needed to resume U.S. production of nerve
gas.
The 247-179 vote trimmed the $95 billion nerve gas plan
from the $207.2 billion defense authorization bill for fiscal
1985.
Reagan, trying to end a 15-year moratorium on such pur
chases. argued that the weapons were needed to replace an
inadequate stockpile and to prod the Soviet Union into a
chemical weapons agreement with the United States.
Reagan wants to replace the current chemical weapons
supply, which consists of munitions that contain lethal gas,
with an arsenal made up of two relatively harmless chemicals
that would become deadly only when they are combined.
Internees file suit too late
Washington — Saying it was filed 30 or 40 years too late, a
federal judge here yesterday dismissed a multibillion-dollar
damage suit brought against the government by Japanese
Americans interned during World War II in relocation camps
in the United States.
U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer said the law
suit is barred by a six-year statute of limitations on suits
against the government. Oberdorfer said "it may be that
timelv claims" would have been successful. The government's
rationale for interning 120.000 citizens and residents
"because of their race" now appears "questionable." he said.
But. he concluded. "Much time has passed, memories have
dimmed and many of the actors have died."
