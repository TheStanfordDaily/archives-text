Washington â€” Congressional negotia
tions on U.S. aid to El Salvador's army
and Nicaraguan rebels collapsed yester
day while it was revealed that the
Reagan administration proposed using
the CIA to secretly ship 14 helicopters to
El Salvador.
The administration's helicopter ma
neuver was blocked earlier this month
when House leaders protested that the
move was an attempt to circumvent nor
mal appropriation procedures, adminis
tration and congressional officials said
vesterdav.

Meanwhile, the collapse of the
negotiations sends both the issues of Sal
vadoran military aid and continued CIA
covert backing of Nicaraguan rebels back
to the full House for votes.
The impasse was reached when Senate
members ot the conference committee
voted 5-3 to stand by the Republican
controlled Senate's decision to appropri
ate $21 million to continue CIA support
for rebels fighting to overthrow
Nicaragua's leftist government and
House negotiators ref used to budge from
their opposition to the aid.

In addition, the House and Senate
negotiators failed to reach agreement on
a Senate-approved plan to send $b2 mil
lion in new military aid this year to the
Salvadoran army. The two issues thus
will go before the Democratic-controlled
House, which in the past has voted to cut
off covert Nicaraguan funding, while ap
proving more money for El Salvador.
William Schneider, under secretary of
state for security assistance, predicted
that the Democratic-controlled House
would approve both appropriations.
"It will be tight, but I think we can do

it." lie saicl. However. House Demo
cratic leaders have vowed that the
Nicaraguan money will not he approved.
The administration's plan to use the
CIA to tunnel 14 helicopters to the Sal
vadoran army would have sharply in
creased the number of helicopters in the
Salvadoran military-
The plan, unveiled before the House
Intelligence Committee earlier this
month, was stopped when the panel's
Democratic leadership objected, said of
ficials who spoke on condition they not
he identified.
