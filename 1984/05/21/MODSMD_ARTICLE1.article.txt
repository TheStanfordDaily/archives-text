# Sakharov health, location unknown

I oday is Andrei Sakharov's 63rd
birthday, and it may seem sate to
assume there's no cause for celebra
tion.
But its tough to make assumptions
about the fate of the Nobel Prize
winning physicist and his wife, Yelena
Bonner. Assumptions don't always
jive with the news coming out of the
Soviet Union.
On the surface, that news looked
pretty bleak yesterday.
Ihe Soviet newspaper l/vestia
blamed Bonner for her husband's
dissident activities, calling her a
"petty, embittered and greedy person
who is ready to sell and betray every
thing and everybody for the sake of
her own profit."
And Sakharov, in turn, is a foolish
tool ol an evil woman determined to
leave the country even if it has to be
"over the dead body of her husband,"
Izvestia said.
lint Sidney Drcll, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter and a close friend of the dissidents,
thinks the Soviet's stepped-up press
war could be a good sign.
I he tact that the Soviets are being
angry and defensive shows that they
care what the world thinks," Drell said
in a telephone interview yesterday.
Meanwhile, the leader of France's
Communist Party reported that Sak
harov is under "regular observation"
in a Soviet clinic near his Gorky home.
Georges Marchais, the party secre
tary general, said in a radio interview
yesterday that he had received a letter
from Soviet authorities saying that
Sakharov was in "satisfactory" condi
tion at the Sematlo Hospital-Clinic.
The letter also described Bonner's
health as "satisfactory."
Marchais' comments appear to he
the first significant disclosure of the
whereabouts of Sakharov since he dis
appeared from his home May 7. six
days after he began a hunger strike in
an effort to induce Soviet authorities
to allow Bonner to go to the West lor
medical care.
But the remarks are still uncon
firmed. Drell, the co-director of Stan
lord's Center for International Secur
ity and Arms Control, says he doesn't
know where Sakharov is or whether
Soviet authorities are force-feeding

him. as some observers have spec
ulated. "During the last hunger strike
(in I9N1) he was hospitalized, but not
force-fed." Drell said. "That hunger
strike lasted 17 days. This one is en
tering its 20th."
The "$64 question" today is whe
ther the Soviets will seek to resolve
the Sakhalin case quickly or let it drift
out of the public consciousness. Drell
said.
But above all. "I don't think (Soviet
officials) will let Sakhann die. I think
they realize his survival is in our
mutual interest." Drell said. "I consider
it extraordinary how Sakhalin was
adopted as a citi/en of the world. This
extensive outpouring (in the West) is
creating a political force that is being

noticed In the Soviets."
That outpouring is expected to in
tensity today. Drell ill speak at a
birthday concert lor Sakharo\ this
evening in Carnegie Hall, featuring
the Soviet Hmigrant Orchestra and
Dmitri Shostakovich, grandson of the
late So\ ict composer.
In San I rancisco. Paul I lory,
emeritus professor of chemistry and a
Nobel laureate, will address a vigil at
noon in Union Square on behalf of the
Berkeley-based Scientists for Sak
halin. Orlo\ and Scharansky. an in
ternational group of about SOOO
members, lie will be joined by San
I rancisco Supervisor Carol Ruth Sil
ver. who will read a proclamation
from Mayor Dianne Feinstein.
