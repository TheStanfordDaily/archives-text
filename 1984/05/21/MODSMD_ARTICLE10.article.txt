Persian Gulf situation intensifies
Ihe Persian Gulf assured itsell the title of
the world's newest international hotspot last
week.
Saudi fighters scrambled to intercept
aircratts attacking one of the country's tankers
in the Gulf Wednesday, and on Thursday,
foreign ministers of the Gull Cooperation
C ouncil called lor the United Nations Security
( ouncil to consider developments in the "oil
tankers war." Meanwhile, the U.S. offered to
provide air cover for Arab countries in the
region.
I hree Saudi tankers and two Kuwaiti ships
have been hit by missile lire in the gull in the
past 26 days. Ihe first two Saudi ships were
attacked by planes from Iraq â€” which has
been waging a war with Iran for three years.
On Saturday, Iraqi planes sunk a Panamian
ship.
Iran, however, is held responsible for Wed
nesday s attack on the Saudi ship and for the
sorties against the two Kuwaiti ships.
Iraq is trying to reduce Iran's oil revenues
by raiding tankers en route to or from Kharg
Island, the main Iranian oil terminal. Iran is
now retaliating by attacking the ships of
countries sympathetic to Iraq.
The United States has a carrier battle group
headed by the Kittv Hawk in the Arabian Sea

and a destroyer and four frigates in the Gulf,
hut its offers of further support were shunned
by nervous Arah officials. Vice President
George Hush arrived in Oman Saturday to
reiterate the offer, but Arab officials fear
reprisals by Iranian- and Syrian-backed ex
tremists and conflicts between the super
powers in the Gulf.
Twenty percent of the West's oil supplies
pass through the <hilt.
MX, Soviet missiles dominate debate
President Reagan called for the MX to en
courage the Soviets to negotiate arms control
last week, and the I louse backed the president
with a 229-199 vote.
Meanwhile, the East Bloc deployed more
tactical nuclear missiles in Fast Germany.
Early in the week. House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) announced that "we
have the votes to stop the production of the
MX." Hut Reagan, after some politicking,
managed to salvage a compromise on the con
troversial missile.
A compromise bill by Rep. Les Aspin (D-
Wis.) to put pressure for arms control negotia
tions on both the Kremlin and the White
House, was accepted by the House at Wed
nesday's vote.
To demonstrate discontent with the admin-

istration's approach to aims contiw Aspin's
compromise provid d for the prodi .'ion of
only 15 missiles: the administration requested
40 and the House Armed Services Committee
recommended 3(1. To press the Soviets, a
provision of the bill suspends missile produc
tion until next April. II the Soviets renew the
strategic weapons talks they walked out of last
December, the allocated funds will remain un
spent.
The Soviet Defense Ministry announced
last Monday that "an additional number of
Soviet enhanced-range theater missile com
plexes are being stationed in the terrritory of
East Germany in response to the
deployment of American missiles in Western
European countries."
Speculation by Western diplomats was that
the missiles were SS-225, with a 600-mile
range, and SS-21s and SS-23s with shorter
ranges. American intelligence sources first re
ported sightings of the SS-22 in East Germany
in January.
Violence, solutions in Lebanon
Violence in Lebanon picked up again last
week. Disagreement between Christian and
Moslem leaders in Premier Rashid Karami's
Cabinet on what future role the armv should

play in Lebanon led to fighting around Beirut,
and violence a Palestinian refuge camp left
many casualties.
Fighting in the Beirut area with weapons
ranging from rifles to 155-mm field cannons
left Ipeople dead and over 70 wounded. Ar
tillery attacks on residential neighborhoods
Friday night killed five people and wounded
44.
By week's end. though, a policy agenda in
tended to end the nine-year civil war was
composed by Lebanon's coalition government
with the intent of presenting it to Parliament,
and the violence temporarily halted.
Sources in President Amin Gemayel's ad
ministration said the statement outlined a
process for political and military reforms
aimed at sharing power equally between Mos
lems and Christians. The Maronite Christians
have dominated the nation's political and mil
itary institutions.
On Wednesday, Israeli troops dynamited
and destroyed a number of houses in a search
for weapons, and Thursday, in the same camp,
a demonstration against Israeli troops and the
Home Guard, an Israei-controlled militia,
provoked shooting by the Home Guard which
left one person dead and about 30 wounded.
