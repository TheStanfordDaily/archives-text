## REBECCA KATZ Abortion: an individual's own choice for the sanctity of life 
### 
» \nti-ahortionists such as columnist Jason Matherly
S? (I 'ailv M.i\ I"") perceive the issue ol abortion with moral
r ui, .ilism <iml tail to realize that its importance tar exceeds
••helping a woman to avoid some "inconvenience" or
~ protecting a teenager from having to expose her "loss ol
S innocence."

VIEWPOINT

have children, because this isn t always the case, and no
hirth control method is 100 percent effective, there are
hundreds ol thousands of accidental pregnancies everv
yeai No one would assert that destroying a fetus is
desirahh , hut it is trequentlv a better alternative than
bringing an unwanted child into the world.
Prohibiting abortion would not prevent it from occur
ring but would discriminate against the poor. The rich
wo.ild continue to get sate abortions in countries such as
Mexico, while poor women who were desperate enough

would resort to the brutal. back-alley methods used belore
abortion was legalized. They would pertorm sell-indueed
abortions using wire coat hangers 01 In injecting saline or
soap solutions into their uterus, either ol which can be very
dangerous or even fatal.
111 addition, without the option ol abortion tar more un
wanted children would be born who wouldn't be ade
quately cared for and might e\en be emotionally and phys
ically abused.
I mallv. a woman is far more 11 kcl\ to die in childbirth
than during an abortion. I orcing .1 woman to risk her life
In gi\ing birth against her wishes therefore means placing
the rights of an unborn 112 etus abo\ e those of a liv ing human
being.
Abortion is not a viable option for everyone, but it is a
choice which should be left to the individual. If is not mur
der. as described In Matherly. Instead, it demonstrates a
profound respect for the sanctity of life and a desire to
make if the best that it can he.
