## The 						grade system fallacy

Hum;in beings are complex, varied
ami constantly changing entities. Prof.
Martin Esslin's commentary (Daily,
May 14) projects human beings,
mailing and something he calls
"reality onto a single dimension. Ess
lin contrasts the he-man (of either

One must also keep in mind the

is\ '' r a professor to look down on a
udent tor not putting the required
11 ort into his class and judge that stu
cnt on that basis. The desire for a
ctter grade may be more of an
waivness ol the necessity of good
rades than ol a personality disorder.
1 or the most part, students know
lien tliev have done a good job and
lien they haven't. If a professor gives
higher grade than his comments
• <>11 Id indicate is deserved, no one's
go will be massaged. Esslin has
out used flic need for flattery with the
iced for the indulgence of one's wcak
icsses, two very different things,
men the imperfections and impor
ance ot the grading system, people
.ant then weaknesses indulged not
v cause ol the needs of the psyche,
in because ot the desire to get into
iad school or to get a job.
Esslin's commentary explicitly puts
ii ward the proposition that trying has

no value. Intuitively, this just seems
wrong. Attempted murder, as well as
murder, is blameworthy. And the at
tempt to save another's life is
praiseworthy even if it is unsuccessful.
How could Esslin have fallen into such
a fallacy? The answer can be found in
his strong emphasis on grades as a
measure of value. I agree that profes
sors should not grade students on how
hard students fry. Grades are
supposed to measure an understand
ing of the course material or the com
pletion of an area of study. This occurs
because of the lack of other standards
that a professor has. and because of
the desire to rank students against the
same, albeit imperfect, standard. But
there is nothing sacrosanct in this
method.
When I was in fourth grade, my
report cards had two columns of
grades, one for attempt and one for
achievement. Certainly, 1 didn't like

The truth of the matter
is that getting good
grades at a university is
indicative of a person's
ability to get good
grades and little else.

the idea; in those days I didn't have to
work lor good grades. But to say that
trying is not important among fourth
graders is to say that they are finished
beings, complete in their talents and
failings. And the same is true of col
lege students, or of people of any age.
Rather than emphasizing limitation,
one should encourage new endeavors.
And one's limitations at one time need
not be for life. Human nature, as John
Stuart Mill wrote, is "a tree, which re
quires to grow and develop itself on all
sides, according to the tendency of the
inward forces which make it a living
thing." Only by trying new endeavors
can individuals grow.
One falls into Esslin's view when
one believes that all human values can
be measured by a system of grades.
This belief leads to an undue emphasis
on the importance of grades, rather
than on learning. Actually, the system
of grading, by providing deceptively
authoritative periodic evaluations.

makes one unduly dependent, and
prevents the formation of an autono
mous personality.
Perhaps Esslin wouldn't assert that
all human values are captured by
grades. But his essay indicates that the
most important values are. As Esslin
states, just wait until the person who
doesn't make good grades gets out
into the real world and becomes a
whimpering failure. What exactly is
this "real" world he is talking about?
(And why should one appeal to it in
order to set one's values? One should
judge for one's self.) Certainly he
can't be talking about financial suc
cess. One's connections and luck are
at least as important as one's ability to
get good grades in regard to that goal.
I sincerely doubt that grades are even
an indication of one's future profes
sional competence. This is an empiri
cal question, and Esslin provides no
support for his assertion. The only
comments on this subject 1 have seen
were Benjamin Spock's in a recent At
lantic Monthly article:
A study measured the relationship be
tween grades achieved in medical
school and the level of competency of
general practitioners a dozen years
after graduation, found, amazingly, >k>
relations!/i/> m>hate\er between grmies
and competency, those who were
practicing superior medicine came
equally from the top, middle and bot
tom of their medical-school classes.
And those practicing poor medicine
also came equally from the top, middle
and bottom.
The truth of the matter is that get
ting good grades at a university is in
dicative of a person's ability to get
good grades at a university and little
else. Only where one's knowledge of
another is extremely superficial, as in
a job interview, does one judge an
other by his or her grades.
Of course people do make judg
ments of others' value, of their worth
as human beings. As with all value
judgments, the individual is the final
judge. And intelligence plays a part in
these judgments. But usually these
judgments are based on others' uncar
ing attitudes, insensitivity or pom
posity. The correlation between these
attributes and success in the "real"
world is of no interest to me. And
whether one tries hard to act in this
manner, or these attitudes come
naturally — it just doesn't seem to
matter.

trying is not important among fourth
graders is to say that they are finished
beings, complete in their talents and
failings. And the same is true of col
lege students, or of people of any age.
Rather than emphasizing limitation,
one should encourage new endeavors.
And one's limitations at one time need
not be for life. Human nature, as John
Stuart Mill wrote, is "a tree, which re
quires to grow and develop itself on all
sides, according to the tendency of the
inward forces which make it a living
thing." Only by trying new endeavors
can individuals grow.
One falls into Esslin's view when
one believes that all human values can
be measured by a system of grades.
This belief leads to an undue emphasis
on the importance of grades, rather
than on learning. Actually, the system
of grading, by providing deceptively
authoritative periodic evaluations.

makes one unduly dependent, and
prevents the formation of an autono
mous personality.
Perhaps Esslin wouldn't assert that
all human values are captured by
grades. But his essay indicates that the
most important values are. As Esslin
states, just wait until the person who
doesn't make good grades gets out
into the real world and becomes a
whimpering failure. What exactly is
this "real" world he is talking about?
(And why should one appeal to it in
order to set one's values? One should
judge for one's self.) Certainly he
can't be talking about financial suc
cess. One's connections and luck are
at least as important as one's ability to
get good grades in regard to that goal.
I sincerely doubt that grades are even
an indication of one's future profes
sional competence. This is an empiri
cal question, and Esslin provides no
support for his assertion. The only
comments on this subject 1 have seen
were Benjamin Spock's in a recent At
lantic Monthly article:
A study measured the relationship be
tween grades achieved in medical
school and the level of competency of
general practitioners a dozen years
after graduation, found, amazingly, >k>
relations!/i/> m>hate\er between grmies
and competency, those who were
practicing superior medicine came
equally from the top, middle and bot
tom of their medical-school classes.
And those practicing poor medicine
also came equally from the top, middle
and bottom.
The truth of the matter is that get
ting good grades at a university is in
dicative of a person's ability to get
good grades at a university and little
else. Only where one's knowledge of
another is extremely superficial, as in
a job interview, does one judge an
other by his or her grades.
Of course people do make judg
ments of others' value, of their worth
as human beings. As with all value
judgments, the individual is the final
judge. And intelligence plays a part in
these judgments. But usually these
judgments are based on others' uncar
ing attitudes, insensitivity or pom
posity. The correlation between these
attributes and success in the "real"
world is of no interest to me. And
whether one tries hard to act in this
manner, or these attitudes come
naturally — it just doesn't seem to
matter.

Esslin's commentary explicitly puts

murder, is blameworthy. And the at

praiseworthy even if it is unsuccessful.
How could Esslin have fallen into such
a fallacy? The answer can be found in
his strong emphasis on grades as a
measure of value. I agree that profes
sors should not grade students on how
hard students fry. Grades are
supposed to measure an understand
ing of the course material or the com
pletion of an area of study. This occurs
because of the lack of other standards
that a professor has. and because of
the desire to rank students against the
same, albeit imperfect, standard. But
