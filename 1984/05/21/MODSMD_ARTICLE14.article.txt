## Union dues to be returned to workers 
### 
I he Daily's May 15 article "Union
lev els criminal charge," about union
dues, leaves the reader with the er
roneous impression that the Univer
sity is retaining for its own use money
belonging to Stanford employees. The
dues money deducted on May 7 will
be returned to the individual workers
in the paychecks to be issued May 22
anil each workei has been notified of
this fact
On May Stanford did not trans
mit money deducted from former
IMS unit workers paychecks to
Local "15. s.l .1 I . The money was
not sent to I ocal 715 because of an
\l Rb lecision received on May 3
which found that I ocal 715 had
disclaimed any interest in represent
ing those Stanford workers.
The 715 disclaimer effectively
voids the dues deduction provisions
ot the contract which required Stan
foul to send dues check oft monies to
I ocal 715. I ocal 6XO was not a party
to that contract and has no valid legal
claim to the money collected under
the Stanford-local 715 contract.
I he NI.RB ruling came too late for
Stanford to rcprogram the computer
10 stop the union dues deductions and
still issue paychecks on time.
Stanford believes that under the
ciicumstantvs the dues nv.Mi •
deducted belongs to the in 1 v idual

worker and is returning the money to
each worker on that basis.

I have never written a letter to The
Daily before: although I have
disagreed with some of the opinions
in years past. However, 1 am deeply
saddened with editorials such as those
written recently which have sup
ported the elimination ot fraternities
on the Stanford campus.
Supposedly. Stanford represents a
university that offers many choices to
many students, and fraternities should
be one of them.
It fraternities are institutionalizing
discrimination, then the ability for
freshmen to choose who they want to
draw with each spring is also a choice
that involves discrimination, and the
ability ot the Stanford Office of Ad
missions to consider high school
seniors for admission to Stanford on
qualifications outside of the academic
arena is also institutionalizing dis
crimination.
In m\ opinion, self-selection is one

of the main ingredients of a country
that thrives on freedom of choice.
I leel that The Daily has made a
serious mistake in establishing such a
one-way attitude toward fraternities,
and should instead look at the posi
tive aspects of housing that creates
such well-known, life-long friendships
and dedication to Stanford.

A reduction
ad absurdum
I sympathize with columnist Jason
Matherly in his discomfort with abor
tion ("Abortion: the right to mur
der," Daily, May 17); I suspect that
most sensitive people do.
Indeed. Matherly clearly presents a
reduction ad absurdum when lie
points out that fetal development is a
continuum, and that choosing a divid
ing line between "non-human" and
"human" posits a magical trans
formation which no one believes
actually exists.
On the other hand. I find it equallv
ridiculous to argue that a newly
united sperm and egg deserve consti
tutional protection. What "magic"
transpires in the instant when ,t
furiously swimming sperm i >|liiV

with the waiting egg? Should we not
protect the rights of the sperm and
the egg in the instant just prior to
conception? And why protect only
the lucky sperm which first reaches
the egg? Why not protect all sperm.
Should we not protect the uncon
ceived? Clearly the time is ripe for a
national campaign against masturba
tion!
More seriously though, does Math
crly truly intend that any woman
whose contraception fails he sen
tenced to nine months at labor?
Carrying an undesired leak of semen
to term strikes me as no light sen
tence.
Surely the woman's rights are a
significant concern. Unless, that is,
one believes she "deserves" it for her
shocking willingness to have recrea
tional sex.
