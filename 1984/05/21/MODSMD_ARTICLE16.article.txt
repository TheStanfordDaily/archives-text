# What is Kennedy up to?
## 
### 
As we live through the spring of Stanford Univer
sity is growing insidiously more authoritarian under the
regime ol University President Donald Kennedy. Stanford
is becoming dangerously tied to the military-industrial
complex and to the political right wing at the expense ot
our academic freedom and integrity . . . and there is noth
ing we can do about it.
It is increasingly clear that Kennedy operates on an
agenda of his own choosing, and does not take the con
cerns of students, faculty and staff seriously: this has
manifested itself in his refusal to discuss or debate per
tinent issues, to acknowledge serious opposition to his
decisions and to pay anything more than lip service to sub
stantial sectors of the Stanford community who are con
cerned about the direction of the University.
Kennedy's insulation from the very real complaints of
Stanford staff, students and faculty is leading the Univer
sity away from the ideal of an institution dedicated to the
free discourse of ideas toward an Orwellian Ministry-of-
Truth-type atmosphere where decisions are passed down
from on high to the subservient masses, at the expense of
creativity, conscience and independence of thought.
Symptoms of this trend are seen in the University's
response to three major controversies this past year:
SSRL —Last spring, Kennedy supported the decision
that nuclear weapons research could take place at Stan
lord's Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL). This
decision was made on the grounds that research could only
be judged by its scientific merit and not on its possible ap
plications — that morality had no role in the decision
making process. Kennedy said that the University policy
was based on the "principles of openness .... The social
benefit flowing from free and unimpeded efforts to gain
i knowledge will outweigh the cost exacted by the oc
casional pieces of dangerous knowledge we obtain as a
result of free inquiry." This righteous statement was a
wonderful rationalization ol University policy toward nu
clear weapons research, but it is blatantly hypocritical: The
whole debate over SSRL was stilled by the very president
who defended the "principles of openness." Over 2500
members of the Stanford community signed a petition op
posing this research, and faculty and staff at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator protested being made "accomplices"
•to nuclear weapons research; what was Kennedy's
response? He relused to hold an open forum on the issue,
dismissed the protesters' call for morality and stonewalled
until the controversy blew over.
f-ree inquiry seems to be fine in principle, but not in
practice. 1 have to agree with Chuck Meyer, who wrote last
spring that it is impossible tor me to keep from making
the connection between Kennedy s willingness to comply
with the Defense Department's plan to do nuclear re
search here and the train conductor's and the office
worker s compliance to their superiors who were
knowingly helping the Nazis."
The Hoover Institution — Kennedy has done his best to
make the Hoover Institution-Reagan Library controversy
a non-issue. Last year over 1500 students signed a petition
asking tor an open inquiry into Hoover; Kennedy's
response was to set up a Board ot Trustees Committee on
Hoover Institution, comprised of four members, two of
whom also serve on the Hoover Board of Overseers. He
set up a faculty committee on the Reagan Library, which
met behind closed doors and did not even solicit student
input. I his year, over 100 faculty members signed a letter
asking Kennedy to establish an independent committee to
review the ties between Hoover and Stanford. As of this

writing, their request is unheeded. Kennedy has also
refused to hold an open forum on the subject because
"some problems are not best served by debates in front of
large audiences." Who decides which problems arc or arc
not best served by popular discussion or open debate? Ii is
obviously not the students or the faculty — their best at
tempts have been met with stony silence and presidential
inaction.
I nited Stanford Workers — Kennedy's pedantic pet
tifoggery has further damaged the already hostile
University-worker relations. Clearly ignoring the will of
the majority of Stanford's unionized workers, the Univer
sity administration is engaging in dilatory tactics that can
only hurt the morale of Stanford employees and thus hurt
the University itself. The University has tried a variety ol

tactics to break the union, including taking it before the
National Labor Relations Board — which ruled in favor of
the union — and. most recently, refusing to deduct union
dues from employee paychecks. Kennedy and other admi

that if he can keep an issue on the back burner by not en
gaging in debate or discourse, it will die. Faculty must fear
reprisals — tenure denial or inadequate salary increases —
and are not listened to by Kennedy even when they do
speak, as recent events have proven. Staff who speak out
get fired — witness Jessie Solorio, who "
lost his job just days after criticizing the University's posi
tion in the labor dispute. Welcome to the land of
"openness" and "free inquiry."
President Kennedy has strengthened his autocratic hold
on our University with the appointment of James Rosse as
provost. Rosse was given his trial-by-fire this past fall as
head of the faculty committee on the Reagan Library, and
spoke the party line well enough to be promoted to No.
2 man on the totem pole. This does not augur well
for those of us who would like to see the man at the top
challenged once in a while.
President Kennedy, what is wrong with a little open
debate on the issues? You may not have orchestrated the
University response to each of these controversies, but you
certainly have been in a position to take a more conscion
ahle, democratic stand. Let's hear from all sides involved,
and let us back into the decision-making process — who
knows, maybe we'll even agree with you.
