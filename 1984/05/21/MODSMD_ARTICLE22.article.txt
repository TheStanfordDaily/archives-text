### DAVE DUTCHER 
One of Stanford's longest and largest social
events took place this weekend when an estimated
6000 people visited or participated in the 13th
Annual Stanford Powwow at the intramural soc
cer field behind Maples Pavilion. The event,
which included Native American traditional and
contest dancing, arts and crafts, food and singing,
lasted from Friday to last night.
"Only about 10 students run the whole pow
wow," said senior Tony Kahn, coordinator of the
Stanford Powwow Committee (SPC)."It's kind of
surprising that everything was running so
smoothly."
Kahn, a Navajo Indian, said there were "drums
from all over," adding that those who provided
the steady beat to which approximately 125 dan
cers moved came from Seattle, Wash., White
River, S.D. and Reno, Nev. There also were five
Bay Area drums, including the Four Winds Drum
from San Jose as the host drum.
The powwow began Friday at 7 p.m. as all par
ticipants entered the dance area, which was under
a large canopy-like structure for the three-day
festival. A similar "grand entry" was also per
formed Saturday and yesterday afternoons.
Participants also took part in inter-tribal, war.
owl. buffalo and round dancing. Featured were
gourd dancing, a tiny tots contest and music by
Winter Hawk, an Indian group which played at
last spring's US Festival.
Contestants vied for a total of $2900 in prize
money in men's and women's traditional and
fancy dance competitions as well as in the junior
and young boys and girls divisions.
"The reason the powwow attracts so many
people is the prize money for the dancers," said
one local businessman. "The $3000 really brings
them in." The businessman, who said he has seen
"about 25 powwows," said the Stanford powwow
was the largest he had attended and "definitely
the largest in Northern California".
Although dancing was the the main attraction
— featuring participants in colorful native

costumes and civilian clothes — observers also
found a veritable marketplace.
The dancing area was enclosed by lour walls of
food and arts and craft booths, where vendors
sold jewelry, artwork, clothing and snacks. The
cuisine ranged from "American" staples such as
hot dogs and snowcones to Native American
favorites like frybread and Indian tacos.
"Half of the powwow seems to be the commer
cial aspect," said John Rick, an assistant professor
of anthropology. "That's interesting."
Veteran powwowers. however, consider selling
goods part of the event.
"It's more and more of a big deal to sell things,"
said Gus Kahclamat, a Yakama Indian who
was part of the seven-member drum and singing
group from Seattle. "The craftsmen at these
events usually have stuff you can use," said
Kahclamat, who sells equipment to dancers.
While the food, goods and dancing entertained
and piqued the interest of the old and young of
many backgrounds, the powwow's purpose was
not forgotten.
"It was a chance especially for non-Indians to
learn about our culture," said Leslie Barichcllo, a
21-year-old senior at the University, of Okla
homa. We can share our lifestyles.
"There was lots of participation from the audi
ence," continued Barichcllo, who was recently
crowned Miss Indian Oklahoma. "It's important
that everyone gets involved and has a good time."
Kahn, meanwhile, stressed the powwow's im
portance for Stanford and Bay Area Native
Americans.
"The powwow brings Stanford Indian students
and the Bay Area (Native American) community
together," said Kahn. "The Bay Area has one of
the highest urban Indian populations in the
United States and through the powwow we get to
know each other."
"1 think it (the powwow) is wonderful," Kick
said. "It represents the type of diversity Stanford
needs rather than the standard arts and crafts
stuff."
