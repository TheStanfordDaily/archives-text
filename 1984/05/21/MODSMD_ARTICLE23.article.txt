# Faculty commentary: Elie Abel
## The 						press criticizes, yet ignores public criticism 
### 
Elie Abel, chairman of the
Communication Department at
Stanford, was a working jour
nalist for a quarter-century
before he turned to teaching.
Abel started his career in
newspapers and later turned to
broadcast journalism. For 10
years after WW II he wax a na
tional and Jo reign correspondent
of The New York Times, based
in Detroit, Washington, Eastern
Europe and South Asia. Abel
shared the Pulitzer Prize in 1957
for coverage of Eastern Europe,
including the Hungarian revolu
tion.
Abel has published books and
served as a member of the U.S.
delegation to the 21st General
Conference of United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cul
tural Organization <UNESCO)
in I9HO. Before that, he served
as the American member of the
Macßride Commission at
UNESCO, which carried out a
two-year study of international
communication problems. He
also served as vice chairman of
the National News Council, a
press watchdog, which has
recently disbanded.
The postman delivered a let
ter the other day from a
gentleman in Pennsylvania
enclosing a $25 check made out
to the National News Council.
He had never heard of the

Council, the gentleman wrote,
until he read in the Philadelphia
Inquirer that it was going out of
business. It seemed a pity, he
added, that an organization de
signed to save the press from its
own follies should close down
before its job was done. So he
wrote out a check. I sent it back
with a grateful note, explaining
that one reason the Council had
died was that so many news or
ganizations had-systematically
ignored the Council's existence
and fairly consistently failed to
report its findings. Small
wonder, then, that he had
known nothing of the Council's
work until it was beyond saving.
When the Council shut its
doors last month, a few papers
carried thoughtful obituaries. In
the Wall Street Journal, for ex
ample, Hodding Carter
wrote: "To most readers of this
newspaper it undoubtedly
comes as a surprise that there
was something called a National
News Council. The conspiracy
of silence that greeted its birth
and smothered its life was not
universal, but included most
news organizations."
Robert Maynard, editor and
publisher of the Oakland
Tribune, put his finger on the
underlying question: "Why does
the press, which criticizes
everybody else, feel so above

reproach that it will not hear of
an organization whose purpose
is to examine the press?"
Some have called it ar
rogance; others call it self
destructive stupidity. Maynard
reminded his fellow editors that
the press was in more serious
trouble than it cared to ac
knowledge, in trouble with its
readers (as measured by Gallup
and other polls) and in trouble
with the courts (witness the
enormous jury judgments
against news organizations in
several recent libel and
in vasi on-of-privacy cases.)
"There is a large public percep
tion that we in the press regard
our power as unlimited, our
freedom as unchallengeable and
our accountability as virtually
nil," Maynard wrote.
In the spirit of full disclosure,
let me now acknowledge that
Nodding Carter was a member
of the Twentieth Century Fund
task force that in recom
mended the creation of the Na
tional News Council; Bob
Maynard was a member of the
Council for several years; and I
was its vice chairman. Perhaps
we were, all three of us, too
close to the Council to see its
demise as warranted by its ac
knowledged lack of effective
ness.
The news council idea came

late to this country. The first
body of this sort, known as a
"Press Fair Practice" board, was
established in Sweden in 1916.
The British Press Council began
operation in 1953. Our National
News Council came into being
20 years later. The theory be
hind it was simply this: That the
press, like any other human in
stitution, is capable of error;
that erroneous or false reports
can do great damage to people,
institutions or movements; and
that opening a channel through
which complaints of inaccurate
or unfair reporting could be
received and investigated would
increase public respect for the
media. Not all the captains of
the media saw it that way. They
knew that the Council, being
wholly unofficial and
independent, had no power to
punish or compel. Public expo
sure was its only sanction. Even
that hypothetical power was of
little weight, we discovered,
when major newspapers,
magazines and broadcast net
works preferred to smother the
council's findings in silence.
Consider, for example, the
role of The New York Times,
the most respected of American
newspapers. From the day the
News Council idea was floated
almost a dozen years ago, the
top management of The Times

vowed that it would have noth
ing to do with the Council, per
iod. It was as if The Times
hierarchy took pride in its
refusal to cooperate or to ac
knowledge the Council had any
legitimate function. It wavered
only once that I can recall, when
the Council handed down a

judgment critical of Rupert
Murdoch, the Australian press
tycoon who had recently
invaded New York. The Times
decided this was news fit to
print, perhaps because its dis
taste for Murdoch-style jour
nalism exceeded its distaste for
the News Council.
More characteristic was The
Times decision to black out the
news that on Dec. 1. 1983, the

News Council had upheld a
complaint against The Times it
self. In the Council's judgment,
the paper had "committed fac
tual errors and presented infor
mation selectively and inap
propriately, producing a dis
torted perspective" in a story
about the use of Dioxin by

Arkansas rice growers. Not a
word of that finding did The
Times see fit to share with its
readers. Not many days later.
The Times did find it
newsworthy that the British
Press Council should have
reprimanded a London newspa
per for a report on Prince
Andrew's playful relationship
with a young woman named
Kathleen Stark. That story, we

assume, passed the Times' time
honored test, "All the NewAV
That's Fit to Print."
It would he unfair to blame
The Times alone for the death
of the News Council. It was in
good company. True, the Coun
cil had the support of
newspapers in places like Allen
town. Penn., Anniston. Ala;
Bellevue. Wash.: Bennington
and Brattleboro, Vt. It even
received financial contributions £
from the Chicago Sun-TimeC?"
the Denver Post and the Dallas
Morning News.
Not so however, in Los An'iv.',.
geles, San Francisco or New*
York, nor in Philadelphiar-*
Detroit or Atlanta. Of the four.,
biggest publishing groups -
Gannett, Times-Mirror.
Newhouse and Knight-Ridder
— only Gannett was a supporter
of the Council through the Gan -
nett Foundation. Of the three
broadcast networks, CBS alone
cooperated and made a modest
annual contribution. ABC and
NBC refused. In aggregate. onl>
26 percent of the Council's very;
tight budget came from the
media. The lion's share, some
56 percent, came from sucb
foundations as the Twentieth
Century Fund and the John and
Mary R. Markle Foundation.
The rest was in contributions
from individuals and non-media
corporations.
It is, all things considered, a
dismal tale. The central miscal
culation of the Council's
founders may have been their
implicit faith that sooner or later
the publishers and broadcasters
of America would recognize
their own stake in an indepen
dent avenue of accountability
for the public and would put up
the money to keep it alive. I
keep telling myself it will hap
pen one day, that the media in
their own self-interest will have
to reinvent something like the
National News Council. One
wonders how many years that
will take.
