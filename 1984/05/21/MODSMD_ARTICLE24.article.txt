### JOHN LIS Staff sportwriter 
"We played aw esotnels!"
I inda Gates wasn't about to
be modest following the 6-3. 6-
4 victors she and Hlise Burgin
registered oser UCI A s
Lli/abeth Minter and l.snn
Less is on the w as to claiming
the 1 I JS4 NCAA Doubles
Championship yesterdas at the
I.os Angeles Tennis Center.
Gates mas not have been
modest, but she \s;is certainly
accurate. I he pair lost onls one
set en route to the title and
eliminated tour seeded teams in
the process.
l ast year Burgin and Gates
finished second in the doubles
competition to Trinity's
Gretchen Rush and Louise Al
len. This year things didn't look
good tor the Cardinal duo. Bur
gin suffered a serious back in
jury prior to the season, and
when the season opened. Burgin
was home in Baltimore lying in
traction.
She wasn't about to be
counted out. though. She
returned to action April 17
auainst Cal State Long Beach

and teamed with Gates for a 6-
L 6-0 win. I lie pair only got to
play in four dual matches before
the tournament, winning them
all.
I lie tandem realized that it
would be a difficult task to come
back, but Gates said. "When we
played that first match this year,
we looked at each other and
decided. "Let's do it.' "
I hey did it. After dropping
the second set of their opening
match. Gates and Burgin won
the next nine straight sets. That
opening match was against No.
2 seeds Kelly Henry and Susan
I'cndo ol I SC. and the
unseeded Cardinal duo won it.
6-2. 4-6. 7-5.
"We were really tight in that
lirst-round match." Burgin said
last night. "I think that's when
we really decided we wanted to
w in this tournament."
That decision showed. The
pair rolled into their second
round match against UCI.A's
Karen Dewis and Jane Thomas
and walked away with a 7-5. 6-3
decision Friday afternoon. They
then faced Martin Noriega and
Lisa Greuorv of Miami (I la.)

and knocked oil the No. 5
seeds, (i-l. <i--. in tlitf quiirter
linal match Satnrdiiy.
The semifinals were also Sat
urday. and the pair mined into
yesterday's final match with a 6-
2. 6-4 defeat ol third-seeded
CMithia MacGregor and Linda
I low ell of San Diego State.
Then came yesterdays linal.
"There's something special
about winning the last match ol
the season." Stanford Head
Coach I rank Brennan said last
night. I Ic didn't leel Burgin s in
jury had taken much away from
the pair. "I think they re better
than last year." he said. "II Llise
isn't playing at 100 percent,
she's at least at l ) 0. and Linda
has really improved o\cr last
year."
Burgin agreed with Brcnnan s
assessment. "This was probably
our best tournament ever." she
said.
"It was great for Hlise and me
to win it." (iates said,
•'especially in FJise's senior
year."
Burgin felt it was a great way
