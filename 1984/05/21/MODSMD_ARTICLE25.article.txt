Gates came back to tie it at 3-3. Spain then broke
Gates' serve to take a 5-3 lead in the first set, but
Gates came back to tie it at 5-5. Spain then held
service to take a 6-5 lead and then broke Gates
again to win the set.
Gates led all the way in the second set, but in
the third, Spain broke her service at love, as well
as in the third and fifth games to close out the
match.

played really good, exciting tennis."
