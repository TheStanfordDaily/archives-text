# Events & Services chooses director
## 
### MARC PEYSER Daily staff 
Alter a national scarch which at
tracted more than 200 applicants, the
University named Lois Wagner as the
new director of Events and Services.
When she begins work Aug. 6,
Wagner will assume responsibility for
coordinating commencement, or
ganizing a master calendar of all Uni
versity events and arranging for the
appearance of performing arts groups.
However. Wagner said she believes
her most important job will be to in
crease the student awareness of the
lively arts at Stanford.
"I would like to broaden people's
horizons of cultural and lively arts,"
she said. In her original job applica
tion. she stressed her view of the three
roles of a university — teaching, re
search and public service — and ex
pressed a desire to link the arts to all
three areas.
"The lively arts should be involved
in each and every one of them." Wag
ner said. "We need to be sensitive to
the unique style of university life."
In addition to improving the overall
campus awareness. Wagner expressed
the need to bring other lively art disci
plines up to par with the "heavily
music-oriented program" currently in
existence.
"We do more dance and theater in
Davis." she said. "I hope my experi
ence there will help me to do some ex
panding here."
Wagner is currently the manager of
arts and leisure at University of Cali

fornia at Davis. She graduated from
the University of Wisconsin-Parkside
in 1973 with a double major in busi
ness and applied music-vocal.
While Wagner will be involved in
some public relations work, she will
also be responsible for luring classical
performing art groups and profes
sional touring companies to campus
and expanding the program, which
already includes 35-40 events an
nually.
"What is produced here is excel
lent," she said, "but it doesn't stretch
one's imagination.
"There are very few people who can
appreciate what's happening in the
classical arts." Wagner said. "I need to
find funds to increase the lively arts
program, to take on more innovative
programming."
Part of the problem with increasing
the University programming schedule,
Wagner said, lies in the poor accous
tics at the Little Theater in Memorial
Auditorium. Because sound easily
travels from the theatre to the big
auditorium, it has been impossible in
the past to book simultaneous pro
grams in each place. Soundproofing
the facility, therefore, would be a
"major accomplishment" toward ex
panding the arts program.
While she expects her multi-faceted
job to be the "challenge I've been
looking for," Wagner feels
"confident" and "excited" about it.
"I tec I I have a lot to offer and now
I have the opportunity to show that I
can make things i»o further."
