# Faculty divided on overseas plan
## Disagrees over Third World sites 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
With a very small number of Stan
ford students planning to study in
Third World countries next year, pro
fessors here are divided on the proper
response to a committee on overseas
studies proposal to increase opportu
nities for studies in the Third World.
Next year, one student will study in
Cairo, Egypt, two in Lome, Togo and
one in Lima, Peru, according to a
spokesperson at the Overseas Studies
Office. No students will study in
Nairobi, Kenya, where a program is
now available.
History Prof. Mark Mancall, direc
tor of overseas studies, said the ques
tion of demand was tied to the ques
tion of Third World education here.
"The question isn't opening up
more interest for Third World
campuses, it's whether what we do
here at home is sufficient in educating
students on the Third World," he said.
Mancall said he felt many students
here are "sidetracked into European
studies," and questioned whether the
requirements for education on Third
World countries was "sufficient for
the 21st century."
Mancall said that there is a "strong
need for a major program in the Third
World, and centers may actually
create demand."
Sociology Prof. Alex Inkeles, chair
man of an ad hoc committee on over
seas studies, said that student interest
might increase it more Stanford-run
centers were established in the Third
World.
The study-abroad programs in
Lome, Cairo and Nairobi are Univer
sity of California programs, while the
Lima program is administered by a
group of universities. The Haifa
campus, as well as numerous programs
in Europe, is Stanford owned and
operated.

"The Stanford approach to overseas
studies is quite different from what
most universities do," Inkeles said.
" That's one of the reasons we have a
higher percentage of students going
abroad than almost any other univer
sity."
According to Inkeles, the commit
tee conducted a survey of students
who had been to overseas campuses
and of a "comparable number" of un
dergraduates who have not studied
abroad.
Inkeles said the committee had
received a "general impression that a
lot of people, including people who
have already studied abroad, are in
terested in studying in Third World
countries."
Faculty Senate member Bruce
Parker, professor of radiology and
pediatrics, agreed that students would
show more interest in a Stanford-run
campus.
"It's difficult to tell student interest
trom the other programs, because stu
dents are generally more attuned to
those programs run by their own uni
versity," he said.
Parker cautioned, however, that "a
Stanford campus is very expensive to
develop and we'd have to be certain
there was actually a demand lor such a
program."
Inkeles said the relative expense of
developing a Stanford campus "can be
variable, depending on the type of
program you want to run."
"Maintaining an enclave, as they do
in Florence, is quite expensive and the
cost of having a Stanford faculty mem
ber monitor the program, as in (Haifa)
Israel, can also cause the cost to rise,"
Inkeles said.
"There's is at least enough interest
and academic value to see what the
cost would be."
