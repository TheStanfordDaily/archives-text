# University considers new computer major
## 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
The Department of Electrical En
gineering is currently considering a
proposal to create an undergraduate
major in computer systems engineer
ing which would focus on the design ot
computer software.
At present, there are no undergrad
uate majors ottered in computer sci
ence and graduate degrees are offered
only through the Computer Science
Department in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
I he proposal is currently "in the
talking stages." according to Bob
White, chairman ot the Electrical En

gineering Department. "Right now,
the University must figure out how
best to organize the major so it will
fulfill all the necessary requirements.
The Academic Information Commit
tee is working out these details at the
present time," White said.
The major might be open to stu
dents as early as the fall quarter of
19N5. according to Gene Franklin,
professor of electrical engineering. "I
don't see how we could get it imple
mented before a year from this fall.
Courses and Degrees for next year has
already been (type)set. and the only
thing we could do would be to send an
informal memo to freshman advisers

so interested students could plan their
curriculum in anticipation of the
major," FrankHn said.
The major would be aimed at
people who wish to be professional
computer engineers, according to
Brian Reid. assistant professor of en
gineering and a leader in this move to
add to the curriculum. "I would expect
approximately 100 students
to go through the program each year."
Reid said.
The new major would not require a
lot of restructuring ot the courses ot
tered within the School of Engineer
ing. Franklin said that because many
electrical engineering faculty members

have joint appointments with the
Computer Science Department, most
could continue to teach the same
courses.
Electrical Engineering Department
members expect the new degree to re
quire more courses than any other en
gineering degree.
The proposal lists three degree
plans, each of which concentrates on a
specific area of software engineering.
The first option is a computer
software engineering degree. Since
this is a software-specialization
degree, it would not require the usual

Students interested in programming will be able to major in software engineering if a new proposal is accepted by the University.
