Rioting continues in India
New Delhi. India — Sporadic violence continued in Bom
bay yesterday as the death toll in clashes between Hindus and
Moslems in western India climbed to 74 with more than 200
injured.
Officials said police tired on mobs in India's largest city,
where numerous shanty town huts were set afire and Hindus
and Moslems hurled rocks and debris at one another.
The situation was reported quiet in Bhiwandi. about 37
miles away, where 52 persons were reported to have died
since the violence started Thursday .
Prime Minister Indira Ghandi, already harassed by ex
tremist violence in Punjab, sent Home Minister Prakash
Chandra Sethi to the troubled areas. Sethi said later that the
situation appeared to be returning to normal.
The army has taken control of Bhiwandi, a textile town,
where more than 20 persons were killed after they took shel
ter in a farmhouse Saturday.
Newsmen who visited the farmhouse reported finding
charred bodies and empty kerosene cans. The victims, whose
identity was not known, apparently were stabbed, doused in
kerosene and then set on fire.
More than 6000 people have been left homeless in the
town after mobs burned down their huts. The rioting also
spread to the towns of Thane and Kalyan on Saturday, but the
situation was reported quiet there last evening.
Israelis bomb pro-Iranian
guerrilla bases in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli planes bombed a pro-Iranian
guerrilla base yesterday in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, hitting
targets only two miles from the Syrian border.
There was at least one report that Israel's jets had also
struck a Syrian anti-aircraft missile site in the eastern
Lebanese valley, but the military command in Tel Aviv said
only that its planes hit buildings and tents used on a training
base for guerrillas loval to the Iranian Islamic fundamentalist
regime. *
Both Christian and Moslem radio stations in Beirut said
one person was killed and another wounded in the bombings,
the first since April 7. In that attack, the Israelis struck targets
along the Beirut-Damascus highway after Palestinian guerril
las sprayed a crowded Jerusalem street with machine-gun fire
April 2, wounding 4K people.
Early yesterday afternoon, according to Beirut's Central
News Agency, three Israeli planes bombed targets in the
villages of Deir Ghazzal and Raita, hitting a Syrian SAM
missile site, before returning an hour and a half later to strike
the camp at Janta. All three villages are in a line very close to
the Syrian border. A Christian radio station said an ammuni
tion dump was destroyed in the raid.
Saudi air force may enter war
Washington —The next major development in the sharply
escalating war in the Persian Gulf could be the entry of the
Saudi Arabian air force into battle against Iranian warplanes,
bringing the first military clash of two petroleum giants and
heightened danger to the global oil supply, according to ad
ministration and diplomatic sources.
A Saudi decision to unleash its sophisticated U.S.-supplied
.in ft>/<.■<_• <<> ic.spuni.l to lnminji air attacks is reported to be an
active option in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Both U.S. and
Mideast sources said this development seemed more likely in
the near future than the widely discussed idea that the U.S.
military forces might intervene at the request of Arab nations.
A few years ago. Saudi Arabia was a poorly armed country
and Iran was a potent regional military power using the latest
U.S. weaponry under the reign of the shah. Today, due to an
expensive and extensive Saudi program and the deterioration
of the Iranian military under the shah's successors, the Saudi
air force of about 1 50 modern U.S. aircraft is about twice the
size of the functional Iranian force of around 70 U.S.
warplanes, according to administration estimates.
Whatever the next step, the clashes of the past week
already have brought the 3'/2-year Iran-Iraq war to a new
stage that Washington policy-makers had anticipated with
foreboding since last summer, when Iraq vowed to bring the
war to a head by striking Iran's oil trade in the Persian Gulf.
Last week, for the first time. Iran struck back with more than
words, sending its jet fighters to attack the oil shipping of
Iraq's neighbors and supporters, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Continents drifting together
Washington — The continents' slow drift around the globe
— a subject of speculation for more than a century — has
been measured for the first time, NASA scientists believe.
Among their findings:
• The Atlantic Ocean is widening six-tenths of an inch a year.
• Northern and Southern California, located on different con
tinental plates, are squeezing together at the rate of 2.6 inches
a year.
• Hawaii and South America are pressing together by 2
inches a year, and Hawaii and North America are closing at
about the same rate.
• Australia and North America are drifting apart by about
four-tenths of an inch a year.
The measurements, though preliminary, are the first
"hard" data to support continental drift, according to Ursula
Marvin of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
"We have really started to see at first-hand the movement
of the continents," said David Smith of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. The agency's Crustal
Dynamics Project, which used lasers and radio telescopes in
more than a dozen countries, measured continental move
ments for five years.
Continental drift is a key element in the geological theory
of plate tectonics that has been sweeping the scientific com
munity for more than a decade.
Officials discuss future Games
Washington — U.S. and Soviet Olympic officials have
agreed in principle to cooperate in ensuring future survival of
the Games, the executive director of the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee said yesterday.
F. Don Miller told a news conference that U.S. officials
now are preparing a "paper of mutual understanding" to sup
port an agreement he said was reached Friday in meetings in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
Miller also said that although he saw no chance of the So
viet Union ending its boycott of the 1984 Summer Games, he
believes the Soviets won't stage a Soviet bloc games to com
pete with the Olympics.
He added, however, that he expects the Soviets to work to
influence other nations to join a boycott that has drawn nine
other nations. Miller estimated as many as 25 or 30 would
boycott by the time the Los Angeles competition begins July
28.
"We believe there will not be any Red Olympic games per
se." he said. "It would be a direct repudiation of the Olympic
charter."
He said, however, that while the Soviets may not hold a
"substitute" Olympics, they might "conduct, in two or three
sports. competitions at isolated sites."

Miller also said that although he saw no chance of the So

believes the Soviets won't stage a Soviet bloc games to com

He added, however, that he expects the Soviets to work to

other nations. Miller estimated as many as 25 or 30 would
boycott by the time the Los Angeles competition begins July

He said, however, that while the Soviets may not hold a

Rioting continues in India
New Delhi. India — Sporadic violence continued in Bom
bay yesterday as the death toll in clashes between Hindus and
Moslems in western India climbed to 74 with more than 200
injured.
Officials said police tired on mobs in India's largest city,
where numerous shanty town huts were set afire and Hindus
and Moslems hurled rocks and debris at one another.
The situation was reported quiet in Bhiwandi. about 37
miles away, where 52 persons were reported to have died
since the violence started Thursday .
Prime Minister Indira Ghandi, already harassed by ex
tremist violence in Punjab, sent Home Minister Prakash
Chandra Sethi to the troubled areas. Sethi said later that the
situation appeared to be returning to normal.
The army has taken control of Bhiwandi, a textile town,
where more than 20 persons were killed after they took shel
ter in a farmhouse Saturday.
Newsmen who visited the farmhouse reported finding
charred bodies and empty kerosene cans. The victims, whose
identity was not known, apparently were stabbed, doused in
kerosene and then set on fire.
More than 6000 people have been left homeless in the
town after mobs burned down their huts. The rioting also
spread to the towns of Thane and Kalyan on Saturday, but the
situation was reported quiet there last evening.
Israelis bomb pro-Iranian
guerrilla bases in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli planes bombed a pro-Iranian
guerrilla base yesterday in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, hitting
targets only two miles from the Syrian border.
There was at least one report that Israel's jets had also
struck a Syrian anti-aircraft missile site in the eastern
Lebanese valley, but the military command in Tel Aviv said
only that its planes hit buildings and tents used on a training
base for guerrillas loval to the Iranian Islamic fundamentalist
regime. *
Both Christian and Moslem radio stations in Beirut said
one person was killed and another wounded in the bombings,
the first since April 7. In that attack, the Israelis struck targets
along the Beirut-Damascus highway after Palestinian guerril
las sprayed a crowded Jerusalem street with machine-gun fire
April 2, wounding 4K people.
Early yesterday afternoon, according to Beirut's Central
News Agency, three Israeli planes bombed targets in the
villages of Deir Ghazzal and Raita, hitting a Syrian SAM
missile site, before returning an hour and a half later to strike
the camp at Janta. All three villages are in a line very close to
the Syrian border. A Christian radio station said an ammuni
tion dump was destroyed in the raid.
Saudi air force may enter war
Washington —The next major development in the sharply
escalating war in the Persian Gulf could be the entry of the
Saudi Arabian air force into battle against Iranian warplanes,
bringing the first military clash of two petroleum giants and
heightened danger to the global oil supply, according to ad
ministration and diplomatic sources.
A Saudi decision to unleash its sophisticated U.S.-supplied
.in ft>/<.■<_• <<> ic.spuni.l to lnminji air attacks is reported to be an
active option in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Both U.S. and
Mideast sources said this development seemed more likely in
the near future than the widely discussed idea that the U.S.
military forces might intervene at the request of Arab nations.
A few years ago. Saudi Arabia was a poorly armed country
and Iran was a potent regional military power using the latest
U.S. weaponry under the reign of the shah. Today, due to an
expensive and extensive Saudi program and the deterioration
of the Iranian military under the shah's successors, the Saudi
air force of about 1 50 modern U.S. aircraft is about twice the
size of the functional Iranian force of around 70 U.S.
warplanes, according to administration estimates.
Whatever the next step, the clashes of the past week
already have brought the 3'/2-year Iran-Iraq war to a new
stage that Washington policy-makers had anticipated with
foreboding since last summer, when Iraq vowed to bring the
war to a head by striking Iran's oil trade in the Persian Gulf.
Last week, for the first time. Iran struck back with more than
words, sending its jet fighters to attack the oil shipping of
Iraq's neighbors and supporters, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Continents drifting together
Washington — The continents' slow drift around the globe
— a subject of speculation for more than a century — has
been measured for the first time, NASA scientists believe.
Among their findings:
• The Atlantic Ocean is widening six-tenths of an inch a year.
• Northern and Southern California, located on different con
tinental plates, are squeezing together at the rate of 2.6 inches
a year.
• Hawaii and South America are pressing together by 2
inches a year, and Hawaii and North America are closing at
about the same rate.
• Australia and North America are drifting apart by about
four-tenths of an inch a year.
The measurements, though preliminary, are the first
"hard" data to support continental drift, according to Ursula
Marvin of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
"We have really started to see at first-hand the movement
of the continents," said David Smith of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. The agency's Crustal
Dynamics Project, which used lasers and radio telescopes in
more than a dozen countries, measured continental move
ments for five years.
Continental drift is a key element in the geological theory
of plate tectonics that has been sweeping the scientific com
munity for more than a decade.
Officials discuss future Games
Washington — U.S. and Soviet Olympic officials have
agreed in principle to cooperate in ensuring future survival of
the Games, the executive director of the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee said yesterday.
F. Don Miller told a news conference that U.S. officials
now are preparing a "paper of mutual understanding" to sup
port an agreement he said was reached Friday in meetings in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
