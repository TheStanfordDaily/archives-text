### 
From The Washington Post
Moscow â€” Marshal Dmitri Ustinov,
the Soviet defense minister, announced
yesterday that the Soviet Union has in
creased the number of submarines carry
ing nuclear missiles off the coasts ot the
United States, and that the weapons
could strike U.S. targets in eight to 10
minutes.
His comments, confirming that Mos
cow has carried out the new deployment
the late party leader Yuri Andropov had
warned of last November, appeared to
rule out any possibility of the resumption
of Geneva arms talks on medium-range
and strategic missiles.

Moscow broke off those talks last year
following the arrival of new American
medium-range nuclear missiles in West
ern Europe.
The additional deployment of an un
specified number of sea-based Soviet
missiles around the United States was
preceded bv Soviet deployments of tacti
cal nuclear rockets in East Germany and
Czechoslovakia. The Soviet counter
measures have restored the military bal
ance tilted by the NATO deployment of
Pershing II and cruise missiles in West
ern Europe. Ustinov said.
(Spokesmen for both the Pentagon and
State Department in Washington said

there was "nothing new" in Ustinov s
remarks. The Pentagon spokesman said
the 10-minute estimate of the time it
would take the submarine-based missiles
to reach the United States was probably
high. He said the Pentagon estimates
that it would only take 5 to 7 minutes.)
Ustinov. 75. speaking in an interview
with the official news agency lass,
warned that a nuclear attack from West
ern Europe on the Soviet Union and its
allies would produce an "immediate and
inevitable" Soviet retaliatory strike, not
only on the source of the attack, but also
on the United States.
He made it explicit that additional

U.S. deployments of Pershing II and
cruise missiles in Western Europe would
be followed* by similar Soviet deploy
ments. including new deployments of SS
-20. triple-head, medium-range missiles
on So\ iet soil.
Ustinov's comments coincided with
the arrival here yesterday of West Ger
man foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher who had intended to urge the
Kremlin leaders to return to the Geneva
talks.
Ustinov said the appearance of new
U.S. missiles 111 Europe "intended for
delivering the first strike" has increased
"the possibility of a nuclear conflict."
