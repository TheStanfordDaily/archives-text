OFF-CAMPUS STUDENTS
If you live off-campus now and will be moving out of
your place in June or September, we need your
help. The Rental Housing Office wants to pass your
apartment, house, or room on to another Stanford
student. Please stop by our office in Old Union, Rm.
315, to give us a listing (no charge). Call 497-3906
for more information.
AND HURRY, OUR SPRING CLEARINGHOUSE
STARTS MAY 29!
