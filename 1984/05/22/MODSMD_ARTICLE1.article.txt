# Students vie for show spot
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The huh of student activity on
campus yesterday was in a Tresid
der lecture hall, where Wheel of
Fortune game show representa
tives held tryouts lor four spots on
a Stanford team that will compete
in a special college match of the
adult hangman game.
About 30 contestants rolled
smoothly into today's final round
of competition, leaving in their
tracks many others who the judges
felt lacked either ability or vivacity.
The four-school 19K4 Wheel of
Fortune College Week, which will
be taped and aired in September or
early October, will feature Stan
ford, Boston University, one
Southern and one Midwestern
school. The show's producers want
to obtain "the best geographical
representation possible," according
to llarv Selsby, the show's contes
tant coordinator. But Stanford,
representing West Coast univer
sities, was not chosen solely be
cause of its location.
"Without tooting the school's
horn, Stanford is one of the top col
leges in the country," Selsby says.
Selsby works with Associate
Producer Robin Kenner and Pro
duction Assistant Peggy Lavell to
simulate the game during student
tryouts.
"We have to make sure that
people know how to play and that

they show energy." Kenner ex
plains.
"Naaaan-cy," she calls, as the
game begins.
"Nancy's turn," Selsby screams
with a large smile.
"Go Nancy!" 20 students cheer,
applauding loudly to impress the
three judges.
"I'll spin," Nancy says, amid
deafening cheers.
Lavell spins the wheel, bringing
it to a halt when it reads $2000.
"$2000" everyone yells, ap
plauding again even louder than
before, some throwing fists upward

in celebration.
"I'd like T,' " Nancy requests,
as the contestants firmly applaud
her choice, most hoping it is a poor
one.
"Bing!" Kenner sounds the bell,
signifying that the letter chosen
does, in fact, occur somewhere in
the puzzle on the blackboard.
Great applause once more, as
Selsby fills in the first blank with
the letter, and lucky Nancy
prepares for the second turn she
has earned.
"I'll spin again," she declares
happily, eager to solve the puzzle

by herself.
But Lavell decides this time to
apply the brake to the wheel when
it reads "Bankrupt," ending
Nancy's turn abruptly.
Selsby leads a chorus of
"Awwwws," but Nancy smiles
along with everybody else as the in
exorable wheel of fate rolls on to
the next contestant. The applaud
ing has already begun again.
Three groups of about 65 stu
dents each underwent the vigorous
recruitment process yesterday.


St nf rd st d nts compete for the four spots available on the Wheel of Fortune's college week in a
mock game with the show's representatives Peggy Lavelle and Flarv Selsby.
About two-thirds ot the students in
each group were eliminated based
on their score on the written
hangman-type test administered

prior to the game simulations.
Roughly hall ot the remaining con
testants received call-backs alter
yesterday's games.
But today's simulations, de
signed to eliminate almost
every body , will be longer and more
intense, "more similar to the real
show." according to Selsby.
