# ID majors: putting the pieces together

By ALEX TARG
Stanford students come in many colors, shapes
and sizes; their academic interests are similarly
diverse. To accommodate those students whose
goals do not fall within the confines of a tradi
tional major track, Stanford offers an unusual
program in which students design their own
majors.
A group of 22 seniors will graduate this spring
through the Individually Designed (ID) majors
program. With degrees ranging from "Biophysics
and Biochemistry" to "Organizational Manage
ment and Communication Systems' to "Film His
tory," their reasons for designing their own
majors are as diverse as the programs of study
they elect.
One motivation for creating an ID program is
to combine portions of two complementary aca
demic departments and to master the relevant
areas of the fields without completing two sepa
rate majors.
Kalon Goodrich, a senior in "industrial com
puting technology," is combining industrial en
gineering and computer science coursework to
generate a program especially pertinent to the in
dustrial applications he intends to pursue.
"I did not want to blindly go into a major which
only roughly approximated my interests and could
not really match them. I wanted to define my own
academic goals and make the program precisely
fit," he said.
Yet despite the rigidity of some of the more
narrow majors like Goodrich's, the ID program is
actually designed to be flexible, according the
Kathryn Thoelecke, academic program coordina
tor for ID majors. Thoelecke adds, however, that
the ID program is designed for students who have
a very strong interest in a particular subject and
who can present a focused, interdisciplinary pro
gram of study which is not closely paralleled by
any conventional majors.
For Michael Smith, a senior in "science, tech
nology and society," it was precisely the program s
flexibility which attracted him. "Since my major
was approved, I never needed to take a course I
didn't really, really want to take," he said. "With
an ID major, you are able to take the courses you
care about without needing to satisfy a depart
ment's rigid requirements. It changes the way you
look at going to school."
In order to qualify as an ID major candidate,
students need to write a proposal explaining why
they want to design their own major, select 60
units of upper division courses and find three fac
ulty advisors to support their petition. The ID
major committee then considers the proposal and
either accepts it or makes suggestions for im
provements and asks the student to resubmit it.
"Anyone who persists with an idea for an ID
major is eventually approved," Thoelecke said.
The program, founded in 1968, initially was
started as an experiment administered by the dean
of Humanities and Sciences. Since then, it has ex
panded to encompass as many as 30 students and
is regulated through the Academic Information
Center.

"It is definitely not an easy way to graduate.
You cannot slide between departments simply to
save work since the committee requires that you
have a good reason to back up your proposal.
Smith said. "The sacrifice is real, and «t takes ex
tra work, but if you think your ma jor through and
you have direction, you can make sure that what
you pursue will contribute to what you will later
use."
"In the job market, my interviewers were al
ways curious about what my major entailed and
why I went to all the trouble of creating it.'
Goodrich said. "My impression is that they recog
nize initiative and direction and appreciate seeing
someone who can name what they want and then
ao out and get it."

Smith said many people perceive him as a more
serious student because he has an ID major.
' Professors remember you as being different
from the rest of the class and it helps you stand
out. It's a bonus to not just have signed up for any
major. The ID major shows you are interested in
what you are studying and the professors respect
that," he said.
Howard Cash, a senior in "psychoacoustics,"
ranks the ID major program as his chief reason
for transferring to Stanford. "When I got here. 1
ran around taking care of the paperwork, doing
everything I could to get it passed. It worked.'
Cash said.
"Future plans may include working in the mo
tion picture industry on special effects." Cash
said.
"There is no reason not to do an ID major it
you don't fit into an established department," said
Smith. "Employers look at your transcripts, not
just your nominal degree. Additionally, if you are
going to professional school, you have much to
gain by studying outside of »■ narrow major-track"
in college* and earningiyour MD. JD or MBA
'badge' once in graduate school when the name of
your degree really carries most of the weight."
