## The
						Stanford Daily A
						turning point? 
### 
We have not always seen eye to eye with Rep.
I'd /schau on foreign policy. In a meeting with
the members of The Daily editorial board last Oc
tober. the Sunnyvale Republican defended
Reagan administration policies in Lebanon and
El Salvador.
He also expressed adamant opposition to
covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels fighting the San
dinista government, only to vote two weeks later
in the face of stiff pressure from the Reagan
administration — against a cutoff of the aid.
/schau's rhetoric, which has set him apart from
other California Republicans, and his image as a
guru of the high-tech world, have given him a
reputation as a political "maverick." In the field
of foreign policy, however, /schau's rhetoric has
not always been supported by his actions.
Last week marked what we'd like to see as a
turning point in /schau's foreign policy career,
/.schau voted against a bill to allow production of
I 5 MX missiles, instead of the 40 proposed by the
Reagan administration. He also voted against the

resumption of production of nerve g;is. which was
defeated by the House. 247-1 7.
In a phone interview with The Daily last week,
/.schau said the vote on the MX represented a
change of heart. Last year, he said, he voted for
the MX, even though he opposed production of
the missile, because he wanted to see it used as a
"bargaining chip" to convince the Soviets of the
necessity of arms control agreements.
"On reflection," /.schau said, "I believe we
should never do something that we wouldn't be
deling anyway just to get the Soviets to come to
the bargaining table."
Education Prof. Martin Carnoy, /.schau's likely
opponent in November, has charged that /.schau
portrays himself as a maverick because his district
is more liberal than he is. Some of /schau's ac
tions certainly support this assertion.
In this case, however, we'd like to praise
/schau for two votes which show that he can be
flexible and vote intelligently — and not necessar
ily according to party lines.
