outlawed; and. most importantly, if a
woman's body was not her own. then
Jason Matherly might have a point in
his recent tirade ("Abortion: the right
to murder." May 17) against abortion
and a woman's right to choose for her
self. However, all the "ifs" above are
not true, and therefore Matherly has
no point.
In previous columns. Matherly has
attacked welfare and advocated
having less money spent on welfare;
what Matherly does not seem to un
derstand. or is just plain ignorant
about, is that most unwed mothers
who choose to keep their which
mam w ho go through the l ull term do)
need welfare, food stamps and other
government supports to stay alive. But
in the end it turns out that the child
grows up in poverty, and the mother,
due to a stoppage of education and job
skills, many times cannot become a
productive member of society. Fur
thermore, many children of
unwed/teenage mothers become
unwed/teenage mothers themselves.
While Matherly asserts that con
venience is a main reason for women
choosing to have an abortion, he fails
to realize that death is more than a
little inconvenience. The risk of death
for young mothers is five times greater
in full-term pregnancy than in a first
trimester abortion, when over 90 per
cent of all abortions are done.
A woman's decision to have an
abortion is not, as Matherly states, the
result of an oath of "I place the value
of my right to engage in consequence
free sexual intercourse and of my right
to avoid inconvenience above the
value of human rights." Not all mo
thers decide to become mothers —
many teens (and adults) are ignorant
about sexual education, reproductive
education and contraceptive technol
ogy. These topics are not taught

openly, if at all, in many schools. It
turns out that the greater amount of
education in these subjects, the fewer
number of pregnancies, and therefore
abortions, occur. Ironically, many of
the persons who do not support abor
tion also do not support sexual and
contraceptive education. Further
more. no method of contraception is
100 percent effective — mothers
could have tried to prevent concep
tion, but it could still occur.
Abortions will occur whether they
are legal or not. and outlawing abor
tions will result in unsafe abortions.
This is illustrated by the fact that
during 1973. the first year that abor
tions were legal nationwide, there was
a 40 percent drop in abortion-related
deaths. If abortions were to become
illegal, some women (read poor and/or
desperate women) would have to
revert to "back alleys." with no medi-

An embryo/fetus is connected to the
mother, is part of the mother, via the
placenta — the embryo survives
through oxygen and nourishment ex
change with the woman's blood. The
embryo/fetus is not, as Matherly
quotes Julie Loesch "a separate and
genetically unique individual," but in
stead is part of the mother.
Matherly says that the Supreme
Court would condone the killing of an
infant one minute before birth but not
one minute after. Yet, the court, as
Matherly also states, ruled to allow
abortions up to the sixth month, the
end of the second trimester, when the
fetus becomes viable (possibly) with
an extreme amount of medical help.

Third trimester abortions are rarely, if
ever, done; if there are, it is only to
save the mother's life. Third trimester
abortions, or the killing of an infant
one minute before birth, are not
condoned by the Supreme Court.
The differences between a third
trimester fetus and a first or second
trimester fetus are not, as Matherly
asserts, the same as the differences be
tween an infant, a child, an adolescent
and an adult. The main difference be
tween the third trimester fetus and a
first or second trimester embryo/fetus
is its ability to survive without the mo
ther. A third trimester fetus is
developed enough to survive outside
the mother with lots of help. And, the
development of a fetus from an
embryo during the legal period for
abortions is very different than the de
velopment from infancy to adoles
cence: an infant or adolescent is not

dependent on its mother — if the mo
ther dies, the infant/child/adolescent
does not.
Any organism carrying the charac
teristic genetic code of homo sapiens,
Matherly writes, is human; therefore
does he advocate prosecution for mur
der for any ovulating females who do
not conceive or sperm-ejaculating
males who do not help conception to
occur? If one were to follow Matli
erlv's reasoning, one would have to
prosecute — both sperm and ovum
carry the characteristic genetic code of
homo sapiens.
An abortion is not something one
gaily skips into the doctor's office for,
as Matherly seems to think, and just as
gaily skips out. It is a difficult decision
to make, but one that women should
have the freedom to choose to make.
