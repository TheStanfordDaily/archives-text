# Outside looking in

Like most tirst-time visitors to Washington, D.C., I was
duly impressed by the gleaming beauty of the nation's cap
ital and the stately grandeur of its historical monuments. I
was impressed by the Capitol Rotunda, where a perky tour
guide demonstrated how John Adams had used the build
ing's acoustics to maximum eavesdropping effect.
In the underground tram to the Senate Office Building.
I gawked at alighting senators as if I were a hick visitor to
Hollywood (I never did get to see the Main Movie Star,
more's the pity.)
I left Washington inspired by a renewed sense of pride
and patriotism, but it was a little group of Iranians, not the
beautiful buildings or stirring landmarks, which made the
profound effect. They were ensconsed in front of the
White House, selling T-shirts of the Ayatollah Khomeini
and toting placards which read, "Down with U.S. Im
perialism."
Their apparent aim was to humiliate the United States,
but their protest had the reverse effect: It paid eloquent
tribute both to the First Amendment right to assemble and
"petition for redress of grievances," and to the vitality of
the system which values it.
On the other hand, how well does the system really
work? As Memorial Day approaches, we have an opportu
nity to take stock of our national situation at the same time
we pay tribute to the 1.5 million young men for whom
America and its ideals meant enough to give their lives.
A good way to see how we measure up is to see how we
are perceived from the outside. I can imagine engaging
one of the young Iranians in conversation.
The mere fact that he is demonstrating in Washington
rather than Teheran should say something, shouldn't it?
Not much, he responds.
"This army you're so proud of — who fought in the Civil
War to preserve the Union if his parents could afford to
pay some poor lad to fight in his place?
"Why during World War 1 were blacks consigned to the
most menial jobs when they had proven themselves as
courageous and resourceful as any soldier?
"Why did you jeer the soldiers who came back from
Vietnam maimed in what they presumed to be the service
of their country? Isn't the U.S. Army today a largely mer
cenary outfit? Isn't it bedeviled by illiteracy: isn't your top
brass dazzled by expensive 'wonder weapons' to the point
of forgetting to order spare parts?"
I nod mutely.
"So you arc the One True Defender of democracy and
personal liberty in the world. Weren't the White House
plumbers accused of wiretapping their own countrymen?
"Excuse me. but who founded SAVAK? Who props up
Marcos and Pinochet and Duvalier? True, you have no
Serbsky Institute (a KGB mental hospital for political
deviants), but you too support torturers."
"Well, we don't seek world domination."
"You didn't need to conquer Africa and Asia when you
had the American Indians to exploit! Now you have take
over for the European colonists. Maybe you do not aim for
lull political control, though you certainly do kick up a fuss
when a small country asserts its sovereignity. Any place
that doesn't give your multinationals free reign imperils

you'vital interests.' isn't that so?"
I sing like an oil-key frog, hut at this point I eannot
resist venting my frustration hy treating my eompanion to
the first leu lines of singer Randy Newman's "Politieal
Science:"
No one likes us, I don't know why.
We may not be perfect, but heaven knows ivc try.
And all around us, even our old friends put us down.
Let 's drop the big one and see what happens.
That solution is of course too drastic. Instead. I remind
my listener that America provides food aid to half the
world gratis, that we underwrite the budgets of several aid
agencies, that we are always among the first nations to of
fer disaster relief and that the Peace Corps ;tnd other help
comes with no strings attached.
The Iranian is momentarily mollified, and turns to talk
with someone else. Meanwhile. I continue to construct my
balance sheet. Mis allegations were true, and he didn't
even come close to listing all the black marks on our his
tory. America is seriously flawed, and its power and pres
tige have consequently steadily eroded since World War
11. Why?
Curiously, our greatest strengths are also our most
serious vulnerabilities; traits we take pride in have often
boomeranged on us. But despite all of our warts, America
is basically a land of:
Opportunity. The tradition of upward mobility has
bested most economic slumps. Result? Good nevvs spreads
rapidly; halt ot the Western Hemisphere warns m un<A 'M:
cannot accommodate them all.
Democracy. Lively and vigorous debates are conducted
in the "marketplace of ideas." Broad segments of the pop
ulation have input into the decision-making process.
Result? The machinery of government slows to a crawl
(not so under a dictatorship) and needed reforms are
watered down into ineffectiveness.
Open. Americans frequently complain about being
snowed under by an information blitz, but to do without
would be far worse. (I commend this to the attention of
textbook publishers cowed by "creationist" pressure
groups.) Americans have easy access to news ot the most
recondite technological innovations. Result: So do the
Russians.
Respect for the individual. Nowhere is personal liberty
greater than in the United States, as even the most virulent
America-baiter would have to admit. Result: Alienation,
loneliness, searching lor a strong leader — or toughness,
self-reliance and a healthy skepticism of authority.
There is more generally well-intentioned leadership, a
high degree of accountability to the electorate, incredible
optimism and durability. We are a nation of paradoxes —
foreigners burn down American consulates and then be
siege them with pleas for visas. We are falling apart and
yet we have never held such promise.
Sometimes, I am ashamed. More often, I am proud. Al
ways — this Memorial Day and every other day — 1 will
consider mysell fortunate to be able to say, / am an Ameri
can.

Like most tirst-time visitors to Washington, D.C., I was
duly impressed by the gleaming beauty of the nation's cap
ital and the stately grandeur of its historical monuments. I
was impressed by the Capitol Rotunda, where a perky tour
guide demonstrated how John Adams had used the build
ing's acoustics to maximum eavesdropping effect.
In the underground tram to the Senate Office Building.
I gawked at alighting senators as if I were a hick visitor to
Hollywood (I never did get to see the Main Movie Star,
more's the pity.)
I left Washington inspired by a renewed sense of pride
and patriotism, but it was a little group of Iranians, not the
beautiful buildings or stirring landmarks, which made the
profound effect. They were ensconsed in front of the
White House, selling T-shirts of the Ayatollah Khomeini
and toting placards which read, "Down with U.S. Im
perialism."
Their apparent aim was to humiliate the United States,
but their protest had the reverse effect: It paid eloquent
tribute both to the First Amendment right to assemble and
"petition for redress of grievances," and to the vitality of
the system which values it.
On the other hand, how well does the system really
work? As Memorial Day approaches, we have an opportu
nity to take stock of our national situation at the same time
we pay tribute to the 1.5 million young men for whom
America and its ideals meant enough to give their lives.
A good way to see how we measure up is to see how we
are perceived from the outside. I can imagine engaging
one of the young Iranians in conversation.
The mere fact that he is demonstrating in Washington
rather than Teheran should say something, shouldn't it?
Not much, he responds.
"This army you're so proud of — who fought in the Civil
War to preserve the Union if his parents could afford to
pay some poor lad to fight in his place?
