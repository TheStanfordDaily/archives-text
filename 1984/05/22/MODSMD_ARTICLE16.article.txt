## Larger doesn't mean better 
### 
In response to Megan DeLamar's
viewpoint (Daily. May 18), I would
like to clear up her misunderstanding
of my statement to the Task Force to
Study Fraternities and Sororities at
Stanford. DeLamar thought I meant
to imply "that the three largest
sororities were the best.'' 1 hope that
I would never be so arrogant as to
make such a value judgment.
Throughout Rush we repeatedly
emphasized the equal value of each
sorority. My comments at the open
forum merely related the docu
mented rushee tendency to accept
invitations from certain groups more
than others. It is in this sense that I
applied the word "preference."
Furthermore. 1 agree that "quality"
cannot "be measured in numbers."
However, DeLamar's desire for the
"growth of each chapter" cannot be
realized if a chapter does not get
pledges.
It is disappointing to me that
DeLamar did not address the task
force last Tuesday. She seems to
have strong feelings about the
sorority system which I can appreci
ate and about which the task force
should know. I'm only sorry that she
felt 1 made a "petty comparison" in
relating information which I felt had
to be expressed.
