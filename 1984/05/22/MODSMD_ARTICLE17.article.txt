## Merits of open Draw

After listening to the May 15 Open
Forum on Fraternities and Sororities
at Stanford, I would like to point out a
few ways in which the Stanford com

The present system, which permits
students to allocate a large chunk of
Stanford's housing spaces subjec
tively. bars access to this part of the
University's housing resources.
Assigning these spaces through the
Draw would remedy this inequity. Ad
ditionally. the Draw would promote a
better understanding between stu
dents by mixing diverse views. The ad
dition of women to these houses could
help to counterbalance some of the
sexist attitudes which have been ob
served in most all-male houses. If
more members in the Greek system
lived with non-Greeks throughout the
University's residences, this would
help to break down stereotypes about
Greeks as well as non-Greeks. I have
observed this phenomenon in
Columbae Mouse during the past two
years. Inside our house, sorority wo
men live together with non-sorority
women, which has led the people here
to discover their commonalities.
One should remember that opening
these houses would not destroy the
benefits which fraternal organizations
currently provide, such as social

events and community service proj
ects. Examples of this possibility in
clude: Alpha Sigma house, a coed fra
ternity filled through the Draw that
provides a lively social atmosphere to
its members and the Stanford commu
nity and the many unhoused Greek
organizations that have raised money
lor charities and have participated in
many worthwhile community projects.

system, the University will provide
open access for all ot the undergradu
ate population without destroying the
positive aspects which are currently
found in fraternities and sororities.
