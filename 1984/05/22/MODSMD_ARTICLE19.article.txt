## ASU will be Card's first stop on road to Omaha 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sports writer 
As expected, the Stanford
baseball team was notified by
the NCAA yesterday that its
drive tor the 19N4 national
championship will begin in the
Western Regionals at Arizona
State University in Tempe,
Ariz. But for the No. 15-rankcd
Cardinal to make a return trip
to the College World Series, it
must conquer two teams which
outplayed it in the regular
season.
The Card will be participating
in its fourth consecutive NCAA
Regionals competition, the last
two of which were stepping
stones to fifth-place finishes at
the championship tourney in
Omaha, Neb. This year Stan
lord will be joined in the West II
Regional by three other clubs
longing to see the big-city lights
of Omaha: host and Pacific-10
Southern Division champion
Arizona State, Western Athletic
Conference winner University
of Hawaii and Pac-1() Northern
Division tournament champ
Washington State.
"Looking at it, 1 think we've
got a good shot at (winning the
regional)," said John Radtke,
Stanford's all-conference
pitcher who is expected to pitch
the Card's first game. "We've
beaten two of the teams and the
third is from the Northern Divi

sion which is traditionally not as
good as the south." Stanford,
which finished the year at 36-
24-1 in a second-place tie with
USC in the "Six-Pac," will open
a regional doubleheader on
Friday afternoon when it faces
the No. 8-ranked Hawaii Rain
bow Warriors (4K-19-1).
The tie in each team's record
is no coincidence — the
two clubs battled to a standoff in
the final game of a four-game
series at Hawaii. The Rainbows
copped two of the other three
contests played in February.
At that time, the Cardinal was
little more than a .500 team
struggling to find a solid starting
rotation and in the depths of an
early season hitting slump.
Radtke chalked up the only
Cardinal win on its short tour of
the Pacific and he dismisses the
results of the trip.
"We weren't going that well
at the time and yet we still held
close. They definitely were
beatable," he said yesterday.
No. 1-ranked Arizona State
(.SO-IS) will face Washington
State in the nightcap. The latter
defeated Oregon State, 7-2,
yesterday in the final game of
the "Nor-Pac" playoff that
determines its representative in
the NCAA tournament.
Each of the eight regionals
held around the nation are
double elimination tournaments

with the winners advancing to
thf College World Series, an
other double elimination tour
ney. ASU is the favorite to
become one of the eight
finalists.
En route to its No. I ranking,
the Sun De\ ils took four of their
six conference meetings with
Stanford, sweeping three games
from the Card in Sunken Dia
mond before stumbling twice at
home. Those two wins,
however, give Stanford the dis
tinction of being the only club
this year to cop a series from
ASU in front of its huge and
hostile crowds.
The NCAA also chose the
four combatants for the other
Western Regional that begins
Thursday at Fresno State and a
quick glance reveals that the
Cardinal may be better off in
the Devils' ballyard. Fresno
State, ranked among the na
tion's top 10 teams during the
last month, will host USC, Cal-
State Fullerton and San Diego
State — all top 20 teams.
"I've got to say that the
Fresno regional is a lot tougher
than ours," agreed Radtke. "I
think Fresno and Fullerton arc
two of the toughest teams on the
(West) Coast.
"But," Radtke added, "when
you get this far, no matter what
regional you are in, it'll be
tough."


The Cardinal will try to run down ASU, Washington State
and Hawaii an the NCAA Regionals this weekend at Tempe,

College World Series in Omaha.
