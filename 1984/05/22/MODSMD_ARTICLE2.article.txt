The letter also warns against "the
immediate threat of loss of union rep
resentation by the Stanford employees
in the TMS (technical, maintenance,
service) unit — representation which
they have organized, struggled, and
voted for through more than a decade
and most recently on April 18."
According to Giraud, the letter was
assembled and the signatures gathered
in less than a week. He said the

process tor getting signatures was
"informal" with "no deadlines" given
People were asked to either write di
rectly to University President Donald
Kennedy or contact one of the three
authors.
"Considering the small number of
people we approached and the
amount of time taken, we were very
pleased and surprised with the result,"
Giraud said. "This was not an attempt
to form a broad-based drive to get a
lot of names. It was just an attempt to
put together a statement that a num
ber of faculty would sign."
Woodward concurred. "It (the
statement) wasn't intended to show
any kind of percentage," he said. "It
was simply to show that there is sup
port from faculty and staff members."
Both Giraud and Woodward said
they believed the University intends
to destroy USW. "My conviction is
that for several years now (the Uni
versity) has been hostile to collective
bargaining on campus," Giraud said.
"I really think that this is an effort to
destroy the union," he added.
Woodward said he felt "the union
was being brutalized by a power
structure that apparently believed it
could succeed" in destroying union
representation at Stanford.
Woodward said the University
"would like to draw this thing out as
long as possible" in order to destroy
the union by depriving it of dues.
The University stopped deducting
union dues from employee paychecks
on May K, claiming there was no bar
gaining unit representation at Stan
ford as a result ot Local 715 s
withdrawal from Stanford in
February.
Woodward said he thinks the end
result of the University's action
will be to "enhance solidarity" ani
form a "stronger union."

Linda Crouse announced that the
union is holding a solidarity rally
Thursday at noon and has asked Ken
nedy to speak on behalf of the Univer
sity regarding the status of l ocal 6N()
In a letter to Kennedy. Crouse des
cribed the matter as one of
"democracy and justice."
"We feel neither you nor USW
i hou!d fear open debate, but instead
should welcome it." she said in the let
ter.
According to Boh Hamrdla. assis

out of tow n until Thursday night and
