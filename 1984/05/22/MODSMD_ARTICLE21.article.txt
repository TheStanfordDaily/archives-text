## 'The Natural' myth fits awkwardly in movie form 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
In Ins 1952 book "The Natural."
Bernard Malamud employed an im
maculate. dry-ice style to scout the
mythic terrain ot baseball. In his pop
Camelot, the hick marvel, Roy Hobbs.
sw ings a bat called Wonderboy that he
carved himself from the wood of a
lightning-split oak — it's his personal
magic weapon, his Excalibur —
revivifies a team called the New York
knights for a brief moment of tri
umph. and. succumbing to the sorcery
nl a latter-day Morgan l.e Fey,
crashes. Malamud based Hobbs on
Hddie Waitkus, 29-year-old first
basemen for the Philadelphia Phillies,
who was shot in the chest by a female
lan in 1949, recovered completely,
and made Comeback Player of the
Year in 1950.
Heightening the material, Malamud
recast Waitkus as an 18-year-old
wunderkind who strikes out the
country's greatest ball player,
"Whammer" Wambold, at an im
promptu carnival match, before the
demonic Harriet Bird guns him down;
by the time he reaches the major
leagues (as a hitter) in the last days of
the Depression, he's already 34 and
therefore by normal standards should
be past his prime. Malamud's hyper
bole has astonishing clarity and eco
nomy — it's sleek, like Roy's bat. And

it contains echoes of earlier American
writers, writers from the age of "The
Whammer" and Roy Hobbs, who
took other manifestations of the

American Dream as their subject — F.
Scott Fitzgerald and Nathanael West.
(One passage in the novel, describing
a joy ride Roy takes with his nemesis.
Memo Paris, pays homage to
Fitzgerald, evoking Daisy's fateful
drive in "The Great Gatsby.")
It is hardly surprising that this
charming artifact of American pop
mythology should attract filmmaker
Barry Levinson. whose extraordinary
debut picture. Diner, dealt with the
way in which popular culture shapes
our lives.
And for the first 45 minutes of The
Natural, Levinson, working from a
script by Roger Towne (the younger
brother of the prodigious screenwriter
Robert Towne), seems to be in full
control. From the opening shot of Roy
(Robert Redford) waiting for the train
he hopes will transport him to the
brink of a baseball career, photog
rapher Caleb Deschanel (The Black
Stallion. The Right Stuff) bathes the
prologue — the 1920s section — in
classic golden reverie lighting that
even nearly succeeds in making Red
ford look young enough for the part;
he acts it convincingly, too. getting the
physical awkwardness of a towering,
ill-at-ease jock forced to feel his social
way in the company of urban sophist
icates for the first time. And though
Barbara Hershey has a blurred,
crotchety countenance as Harriet Bird
— she's a perverse choice for a femme
fatale — Joe Don Baker, as "The
Whammer," provides the emotional
center for the sequence. He looks a
little like Hoyt Axton and a lot like
Babe Ruth (who clearly inspired the
character), and he milks the crowd
with rapscallion assurance — he's a
scoundrel charmer. His stunned reac
tion to Roy's magically elusive pitches
is exquisite clowning; he tumbles from
his throne in a manner that somehow
manages to suggest Fatty Arbuckle or
Oliver Hardy as the defeated giant in a
fairy tale.
When the movie enters its second
phase — 1939 — and Deschanel and
the production designer. Mel Bourne
(who usually works on Woody Allen's
pictures), sharpen the focus and
brighten their palette, Redford
doesn't have to rely on lighting tricks;
he's not dangerously far from Roy's
age (Redford is a very young 46) and
he looks fantastic — ripened — as he
saunters into the Knights' dugout. The
Knights' manager, Pop Fisher
(Wilford Brimley), is so incensed at

the scout who hired such a superan
nuated rookie that he refuses to p|a\
Roy at first, or even to let him bat at
practice, and the team keeps losing,
dismally, Fevinson's gift for under
stated. off-the-wall comedy shines in
this Hop montage, where he intercuts
the droning sermons ot a dwarfish
quack mesmerist (Peter Poth) who
rocks back and forth on his pins while

exhorting the dispirited players in a
helium freak voice, with the chronic
bumbling of the team at bat and in the
field. And when Pop finally gives Roy
his chance to hit a few in batting
practice, Levinson retains his lightly
ironic tone, mining considerable
humor out of the hollow sound of one
ball after another bouncing off the

empty stands, rhcsc scenes may lack
the improvisatory excitement of
Diner, but they have a seemingly ef
fortless buoyancy that makes us grin.
But The Natural is a booby-trapped
book for a filmmaker, because the
conscious construction of myth, the
comfortable realm of modern writers,
never works in movies — perhaps be
cause movies are already the stuff of
legend, and have an automatic mvth
ologizing pop effect on ordinary
stories. Him is the ideal medium for
exploring the tension between pop
myth and reality (and that's what
Diner did. and Pennies porn Heaven.
too), but when film directors make a
deliberate effort to create myth, the
results are usually so overscaled that
the material becomes trivialized {High
Noon. Shane), and when they try to
adapt novels that accomplish this, like
The Great Gatsby or The Last Tycoon.
they generally come up with stodgy,
expensive movies, in which
"production values" substitute for
human interaction.
The Natural isn't a fiasco, like
Gats by or The Last Tycoon were, be
cause Barry Levinson is a very canny
director, and lie fills out the movie
with unexpected corner-of-the-frame
observations that authenticate the
baseball scenes. But he runs into real
trouble as soon as the intrigue begins
the machinations of Memo Paris
(Kim Basinger) at the behest of the
Knights' crooked owner. The Judge
(Robert Prosky) and his pal, bookie
Gus Sands (Darren McGavin, un
credited) — and he never gets back on
track. Roy's initial interview with The
Judge takes place in a darkened office
— I he Judge always keeps his shades
drawn — and it's impossibly careful
and literary. (Prosky, a very skillful
actor, is done in by his lines in this
movie.) It's also corny, in a way I
couldn't identify until the scene was
almost over: Prosky is playing the
American fascist millionaire to Red
ford's Frank Capra populist hero —
like Edward Arnold in Meet John Doe
or Lionel Barrymore in It's a Wonder
ful Life. (Surely movies can survive
without resurrecting that old ar
chetype.)
From that point, the film goes flat,
although visually a great deal of it con
tinues to amaze you — especially the
finale, which diverges from the novel.
Without a cinematic equivalent for the
wildest details of Malamud's comic
fantasy, most of which the filmmakers

ha\e cut or altered, and without the
welcome irony of the first three
quarters ot an hour, the mo\ie waxes
sentimental, and sometimes l.exin
son sand Deschanel's artistry freezes
the action — a romantic riverside in
terlude between Roy and Memo,
beautifully shot in silhouette. ser\es as
a discomfiting reminder of both the
I'i tzgerald pictures, and one montage

sweetheart. Iris (Glenn Close), is like

stills. After a while, the plot begins to
iccycle Damn Yankees. with The
Judge as the devil figure. Mr. Ap-

plegate, and Memo Paris as Lola, the
devil s siren. And you get impatient
with Roy, who takes an uncon
scionably long time to figure out that
11 is has had and raised his son.
(Malamud's Roy is very thick indeed,
but Redlord has such an intelligent
face that you can't imagine his being
so slow on the uptake.) Glenn Close
has nothing to play, and Roger Towne
leaves her many of the worst lines, so
her sc. .ies with Roy stall the movie.
And as her rival, Kim Basinger gives a
disastrous performance that seems in
nded to turn Memo into a clenched
voiced neurotic; her idea of acting is to
exercise all of her facial muscles in se
quence.

Year in 1950.
Heightening the material, Malamud

"Whammer" Wambold, at an im
promptu carnival match, before the
demonic Harriet Bird guns him down;

writers, writers from the age of "The
Whammer" and Roy Hobbs, who

It is hardly surprising that this

mythology should attract filmmaker
Barry Levinson. whose extraordinary
debut picture. Diner, dealt with the
way in which popular culture shapes
our lives.
And for the first 45 minutes of The
Natural, Levinson, working from a
script by Roger Towne (the younger
brother of the prodigious screenwriter
Robert Towne), seems to be in full
control. From the opening shot of Roy
(Robert Redford) waiting for the train
he hopes will transport him to the
brink of a baseball career, photog
rapher Caleb Deschanel (The Black
Stallion. The Right Stuff) bathes the
prologue — the 1920s section — in
classic golden reverie lighting that
even nearly succeeds in making Red
ford look young enough for the part;
he acts it convincingly, too. getting the
physical awkwardness of a towering,
ill-at-ease jock forced to feel his social
way in the company of urban sophist
icates for the first time. And though
Barbara Hershey has a blurred,
crotchety countenance as Harriet Bird
— she's a perverse choice for a femme
fatale — Joe Don Baker, as "The
Whammer," provides the emotional
center for the sequence. He looks a
little like Hoyt Axton and a lot like
Babe Ruth (who clearly inspired the
character), and he milks the crowd
with rapscallion assurance — he's a
scoundrel charmer. His stunned reac
tion to Roy's magically elusive pitches
is exquisite clowning; he tumbles from
his throne in a manner that somehow
manages to suggest Fatty Arbuckle or
Oliver Hardy as the defeated giant in a
fairy tale.
When the movie enters its second
phase — 1939 — and Deschanel and
the production designer. Mel Bourne
(who usually works on Woody Allen's
pictures), sharpen the focus and
brighten their palette, Redford
doesn't have to rely on lighting tricks;
he's not dangerously far from Roy's
age (Redford is a very young 46) and
he looks fantastic — ripened — as he
saunters into the Knights' dugout. The
Knights' manager, Pop Fisher
(Wilford Brimley), is so incensed at

the scout who hired such a superan
nuated rookie that he refuses to p|a\
Roy at first, or even to let him bat at
practice, and the team keeps losing,
dismally, Fevinson's gift for under
stated. off-the-wall comedy shines in
this Hop montage, where he intercuts
the droning sermons ot a dwarfish
quack mesmerist (Peter Poth) who
rocks back and forth on his pins while

exhorting the dispirited players in a
helium freak voice, with the chronic
bumbling of the team at bat and in the
field. And when Pop finally gives Roy
his chance to hit a few in batting
practice, Levinson retains his lightly
ironic tone, mining considerable
humor out of the hollow sound of one
ball after another bouncing off the

empty stands, rhcsc scenes may lack
the improvisatory excitement of
Diner, but they have a seemingly ef
fortless buoyancy that makes us grin.
But The Natural is a booby-trapped
book for a filmmaker, because the

comfortable realm of modern writers,
never works in movies — perhaps be

stories. Him is the ideal medium for

adapt novels that accomplish this, like
The Great Gatsby or The Last Tycoon.

expensive movies, in which
"production values" substitute for
human interaction.
The Natural isn't a fiasco, like
Gats by or The Last Tycoon were, be
cause Barry Levinson is a very canny
director, and lie fills out the movie
with unexpected corner-of-the-frame
observations that authenticate the
baseball scenes. But he runs into real
trouble as soon as the intrigue begins
the machinations of Memo Paris
(Kim Basinger) at the behest of the
Knights' crooked owner. The Judge
(Robert Prosky) and his pal, bookie
Gus Sands (Darren McGavin, un
credited) — and he never gets back on
track. Roy's initial interview with The
Judge takes place in a darkened office
— I he Judge always keeps his shades
drawn — and it's impossibly careful
and literary. (Prosky, a very skillful
actor, is done in by his lines in this
movie.) It's also corny, in a way I
couldn't identify until the scene was
almost over: Prosky is playing the
American fascist millionaire to Red
ford's Frank Capra populist hero —
like Edward Arnold in Meet John Doe
or Lionel Barrymore in It's a Wonder
ful Life. (Surely movies can survive
without resurrecting that old ar
chetype.)

basemen for the Philadelphia Phillies,
who was shot in the chest by a female
lan in 1949, recovered completely,
and made Comeback Player of the
Year in 1950.
Heightening the material, Malamud
recast Waitkus as an 18-year-old
wunderkind who strikes out the
country's greatest ball player,
"Whammer" Wambold, at an im
promptu carnival match, before the
demonic Harriet Bird guns him down;
by the time he reaches the major
leagues (as a hitter) in the last days of
the Depression, he's already 34 and
therefore by normal standards should
be past his prime. Malamud's hyper
bole has astonishing clarity and eco
nomy — it's sleek, like Roy's bat. And

it contains echoes of earlier American
writers, writers from the age of "The
Whammer" and Roy Hobbs, who
took other manifestations of the

American Dream as their subject — F.
Scott Fitzgerald and Nathanael West.
(One passage in the novel, describing
a joy ride Roy takes with his nemesis.
Memo Paris, pays homage to
Fitzgerald, evoking Daisy's fateful
drive in "The Great Gatsby.")
It is hardly surprising that this
charming artifact of American pop
mythology should attract filmmaker
Barry Levinson. whose extraordinary
debut picture. Diner, dealt with the
way in which popular culture shapes
our lives.
And for the first 45 minutes of The
Natural, Levinson, working from a
script by Roger Towne (the younger
brother of the prodigious screenwriter
Robert Towne), seems to be in full
control. From the opening shot of Roy
(Robert Redford) waiting for the train
he hopes will transport him to the
brink of a baseball career, photog
rapher Caleb Deschanel (The Black
Stallion. The Right Stuff) bathes the
prologue — the 1920s section — in
classic golden reverie lighting that
even nearly succeeds in making Red
ford look young enough for the part;
he acts it convincingly, too. getting the
physical awkwardness of a towering,
ill-at-ease jock forced to feel his social
way in the company of urban sophist
icates for the first time. And though
Barbara Hershey has a blurred,
crotchety countenance as Harriet Bird
— she's a perverse choice for a femme
fatale — Joe Don Baker, as "The
Whammer," provides the emotional
center for the sequence. He looks a
little like Hoyt Axton and a lot like
Babe Ruth (who clearly inspired the
character), and he milks the crowd
with rapscallion assurance — he's a
scoundrel charmer. His stunned reac
tion to Roy's magically elusive pitches
is exquisite clowning; he tumbles from
his throne in a manner that somehow
manages to suggest Fatty Arbuckle or
Oliver Hardy as the defeated giant in a
fairy tale.
When the movie enters its second
phase — 1939 — and Deschanel and
the production designer. Mel Bourne
(who usually works on Woody Allen's
pictures), sharpen the focus and
brighten their palette, Redford
doesn't have to rely on lighting tricks;
he's not dangerously far from Roy's
age (Redford is a very young 46) and
he looks fantastic — ripened — as he
saunters into the Knights' dugout. The
Knights' manager, Pop Fisher
(Wilford Brimley), is so incensed at

the scout who hired such a superan
nuated rookie that he refuses to p|a\
Roy at first, or even to let him bat at
practice, and the team keeps losing,
dismally, Fevinson's gift for under
stated. off-the-wall comedy shines in
this Hop montage, where he intercuts
the droning sermons ot a dwarfish
quack mesmerist (Peter Poth) who
rocks back and forth on his pins while

exhorting the dispirited players in a
helium freak voice, with the chronic
bumbling of the team at bat and in the
field. And when Pop finally gives Roy
his chance to hit a few in batting
practice, Levinson retains his lightly
ironic tone, mining considerable
humor out of the hollow sound of one
ball after another bouncing off the

empty stands, rhcsc scenes may lack
the improvisatory excitement of
Diner, but they have a seemingly ef
fortless buoyancy that makes us grin.
But The Natural is a booby-trapped
book for a filmmaker, because the
conscious construction of myth, the
comfortable realm of modern writers,
never works in movies — perhaps be
cause movies are already the stuff of
legend, and have an automatic mvth
ologizing pop effect on ordinary
stories. Him is the ideal medium for
exploring the tension between pop
myth and reality (and that's what
Diner did. and Pennies porn Heaven.
too), but when film directors make a
deliberate effort to create myth, the
results are usually so overscaled that
the material becomes trivialized {High
Noon. Shane), and when they try to
adapt novels that accomplish this, like
The Great Gatsby or The Last Tycoon.
they generally come up with stodgy,
expensive movies, in which
"production values" substitute for
human interaction.
The Natural isn't a fiasco, like
Gats by or The Last Tycoon were, be
cause Barry Levinson is a very canny
director, and lie fills out the movie
with unexpected corner-of-the-frame
observations that authenticate the
baseball scenes. But he runs into real
trouble as soon as the intrigue begins
the machinations of Memo Paris
(Kim Basinger) at the behest of the
Knights' crooked owner. The Judge
(Robert Prosky) and his pal, bookie
Gus Sands (Darren McGavin, un
credited) — and he never gets back on
track. Roy's initial interview with The
Judge takes place in a darkened office
— I he Judge always keeps his shades
drawn — and it's impossibly careful
and literary. (Prosky, a very skillful
actor, is done in by his lines in this
movie.) It's also corny, in a way I
couldn't identify until the scene was
almost over: Prosky is playing the
American fascist millionaire to Red
ford's Frank Capra populist hero —
like Edward Arnold in Meet John Doe
or Lionel Barrymore in It's a Wonder
ful Life. (Surely movies can survive
without resurrecting that old ar
chetype.)
From that point, the film goes flat,
although visually a great deal of it con
tinues to amaze you — especially the
finale, which diverges from the novel.
Without a cinematic equivalent for the
wildest details of Malamud's comic
fantasy, most of which the filmmakers

ha\e cut or altered, and without the
welcome irony of the first three
quarters ot an hour, the mo\ie waxes
sentimental, and sometimes l.exin

a discomfiting reminder of both the

sweetheart. Iris (Glenn Close), is like

plegate, and Memo Paris as Lola, the
devil s siren. And you get impatient
with Roy, who takes an uncon
scionably long time to figure out that
11 is has had and raised his son.
(Malamud's Roy is very thick indeed,
but Redlord has such an intelligent
face that you can't imagine his being
so slow on the uptake.) Glenn Close
has nothing to play, and Roger Towne
leaves her many of the worst lines, so
her sc. .ies with Roy stall the movie.
And as her rival, Kim Basinger gives a
disastrous performance that seems in
nded to turn Memo into a clenched
voiced neurotic; her idea of acting is to
exercise all of her facial muscles in se
quence.
