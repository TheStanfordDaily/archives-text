# San Jose's 'The Tempest': lavish visually, but one-dimensional
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
After substantial publicity for
the Merrill Lynch-sponsored
production of "The Tempest,"
the joint efforts of the San Jose
Repertory and the San Jose
Symphony Orchestra failed to
deliver the "grand perfor
mance." True, it is a grand idea
and a marvelous plan — to
everyone's credit — to generate
corporate support for the arts.
And as one of the largest
theatrical events in Northern
California, this ambitious un
dertaking encourages the
strengthening of regional
theater.
Indeed, "The Tempest" was
grand in many ways. The lavish
island setting and stunning
costumes would have strikingly
enhanced the entire production,
had the acting been up to par.
The stage was a pastel paradise
of alternating blues, greens and
aquas, where Ariel and other
spirits flitted about in similar
shades. In contrast to that soft
ness and airiness, Prospero, Fer
dinand and the others — the
mortals — wore colorful garb of
deep purple, reds and stark

white.
"The Tempest," having
begun swiftly, slowed drastically
with Prospero's entrance and
monologue, where the dramatic
pauses felt like forgotten lines.
Even with the few bright mo
ments of character acting, the
San Jose Rep's showing was dis
appointing, given that it is a
strong company with a group of
talented individuals who truly
enjoy their craft and usually
present coherent performances.
As lord of the island,
Prospero must subtly convey his
power, his authority mixed with
a desire for vengeance, his
humor and his fatherly instincts
— a charisma as overwhelming
as his magic. Sydney Walker did
not fulfill the depth which the
role requires; his Prospero was
ponderous and heavy-handed,
generally too harsh.
A few members gave convinc
ing portrayals, for instance.
Drew Eshelman as Gonzalo, the
honest old councilor who put
sustenance and books in the
boat with Prospero and baby
Miranda when both were

banished from Milan. Eshelman
played the elderly Gonzalo with
understated dignity.
Charles Martinet, who com
petently played Charles Surface
in the Rep's "The School for
Scandal," continued his fine
comic touch as Trinculo the
jester. He, Howard Swain
(Stephano the drunken butler)
and Caliban made a lively trio
which overdid the drunkenness
but effectively drew many
laughs.
The bits of credible acting,
against a generally lackadaisical
cast, were not enough to iif- the
production out of its ,>ne
dimensional sluggishness. And
then there is the question of in
terpretation, notably in the
celebratory scene for Ferdinand
and Miranda, where Shake
speare has written a series of
speeches for the earth spirits —
in a sense, a heightened fertility
rite.
In this production of "The
Tempest," this scene finds
garish earth-mother shapes —
painted flats — descending from
the sky onstage. As if this isn't

enough "innovation, another
one with sun-like face and arms
is brought in from the side, but
also suspended from the stage
ceiling. And it sings, while airy
spirits dance around.
This scene was a glaring error
in taste, and I was not sure whe
ther to laugh at a piece of large
prop waving its "arms" and trill
inn in soprano. It definitely was

not a "majestic vision, as
Prospero exlaims.
The incidental music by Jean
Sibelius, conducted by George
Cleve, however, was wonderful
and subtle. The San Jose Sym
phony Orchestra, with a longer
history, has always proved itself
to be a competent and precise
ensemble. Seated behind a filmy
translucent screen for "The

lempest, the orchestra
matched the movements and set
the mood while being actually
onstage, without distracting any
of the action.
The translucent backdrop
served the production well, and
projected light on it — in the
shape of palm trees and coral
reefs — lent a magical aura and
allowed a change of scene with

out physically moving props.
On the whole, "The
Tempest" was perhaps too am
bitious a project, though with
the finest of motives, backed by
tremendous support from the
community and Merrill Lynch.
Such resources will certainly
cultivate interest and many
more productions, and 1 look
forward to the next one.

the mood while being actually
onstage, without distracting any
of the action.
The translucent backdrop
served the production well, and
projected light on it — in the
shape of palm trees and coral
reefs — lent a magical aura and
allowed a change of scene with

out physically moving props.
On the whole, "The
Tempest" was perhaps too am
bitious a project, though with
the finest of motives, backed by
tremendous support from the
community and Merrill Lynch.
Such resources will certainly
cultivate interest and many
more productions, and 1 look
forward to the next one.
