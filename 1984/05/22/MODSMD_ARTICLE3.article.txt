# Committee intensifies search for Stanford's new admissions dean
## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
The committee searching for a new dean of
admissions has begun a campaign to attract
qualified iippliciinfs tor the job which Fred
Hargadon will vacate in June.
The committee sent letters requesting ap
plications and suggestions for the post to all
members of the University's Academic Coun
cil and teaching staff several weeks ago and
telephone calls are being made to qualified
people across the country.
Hargadon, who has served as dean of ad
missions for 15 years, will leave in June to
become vice president of the College Board.
Members of the committee appointed to
find Hargadon"s successor include Sally
Mahoney, registrar and associate provost,
University President Donald Kennedy and

Provost Albert Hastorf. They will be aided
later by an interviewing committee composed
of faculty members and one student.
â€¢ We're just in the process of having posted
a job description and have started getting in
quiries from people interested in the posi
tion," Mahoney said yesterday. "Given the
nature of admissions we felt it best to wait to
get through April before trying to get people
who are interested in the job," she said.
According to Mahoney, Kennedy recently
told the admissions and financial aids staffs
that the search committee is not trying to put a
specific date on the selection of a new dean of
admissions, but that it will try to move
through the process as quickly as possible.
"Hopefully, we will begin conducting inter
views sometime early in June," Hastorf said.
Though no deadline has been set for the final

choice, Hastorf said, "I'd love to do it by the
first of July. That's my hope."
Even if not chosen until early fall, the new
admissions officer should not have much trou
ble with next year's admissions, Hastorf said.
And Mahoney said "the office of admis
sions routine is well understood within the of
fice and the staff are in place to handle it until
the new dean is chosen."
The letter the search committee has sent to
the faculty explains the importance of the
dean of admissions position and encourages
qualified faculty members to consider the job.
"We ask you to consider the position for your
self or to suggest to us colleagues you think
might do an effective job," it stated.
People from both inside and outside the
University will be considered, Mahoney said.
She said there are several considerations to

keep in mind when deciding whether to look
outside the University.
Mahoney pointed to the fact that Hargadon
came to Stanford from Swarthmore College,
where he was dean of admissions. "But on the
other hand a knowledge of the purpose and
nature of this place and the style of the place
would make it easier for an individual to come
in and make a mark. That's why we sent the
letter to faculty in the University who might
wish to make a career change," she said.
A description of the job made available on
May 7 said candidates for the job "should ex
hibit capacities for energy and grace under
pressure adequate to the demands of
schedule, travel obligatons and the need to
balance competing goals."
Mahoney added that the ability to say no is
me qualification needed for the admissions

job. "The person has to be able to say no a lot
and still be able to sleep at night," she said.
Hargadon has become somewhat of an in
stitution on campus and Mahoney said there is
some difficultly in replacing that. His
"Admits" license plate was recently van
dalized to read "Rejects," t-shirts bear his
likeness ami he regularly appears in Gaieties.
When asked what she thought about the
recent vandalism to Hargadon s license plates,
Mahoney said. "I think it's wonderful. Jim
Lyons and I have kidded Hargadon for years
that if he really wanted to get plates that said
what he mostly does they would say 'rejects.'
He mostly says no.
"We're not setting out with the respon-
sibility of replacing Fred," Mahoney
said. "Fred's unique. We need both to
recognize that and celebrate that as we
set about on the search.
"Fred Hargadon has become a per
sonage on the campus over the course
ol 15 years. I think in the earlier years
the people who knew his work appre
ciated it and the number of people

who are aware of what he does has
grown over the years." she said.
Another committee headed by En
glish Prof. Nancy Packer earlier
looked into possible changes in the
structure of the admissions office. Ac
cording to Packer, the committee con
sidered the possibility of combining
the admissions and financial aids
offices.
"But we didn't think at this time
there was any reason for overhauling
the structure of the office," Packer
said.
