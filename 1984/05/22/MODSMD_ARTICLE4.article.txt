San Francisco — About 200 people,
many of them Jewish emigrants from
the Soviet Union, rallied in Union
Square yesterday in tribute to the 63rd
birthday of Soviet physicist Andrei
Sakha row
Andrei Sakharov Freedom Day.
proclaimed yesterday by Mayor
Dianne Feinstein, offered an occasion
for leading Bay Area human rights ac
tivists to call en masse on the Soviet
Union for the release of the Nobel
Prize-winning dissident and his wife.
Yelena Bonner. The health and
whe'-'abouts of the couple remain un
knot n.
Mikhail l.emkin. a young Leningrad
emigrant of only four months, atten
ded the rally.
"Sakharov wants peace." lie said in
broken 1 iclish. "If all countries do
not kno\ .bout him. he will die within
days. W\ • ust help."
anloi s Paul Flory. emeritus pro
fessor of ehemistrv. also spoke at the
rally.
"This is a mo* 2. occasion for the
many of us who have been involved
with human rig its." Flory said. "Our
outraue at this ii cessant abuse . . .

compels us to act."
Flory. an executive committee
member of Scientists for Sakharov.
Orlov and Scharansky (SOS), a
Berkeley-based international group
with about SOOO members worldwide,
called Sakharov's persecution "a most
heinous crime against him, and against
us as well."
On a low table next to Flory, rally
organizers had placed a painted metal
"birthday cake" wrapped in chains
and decked with 19 kindles — one for
each day of the hunuer strike. That
cake, donated by a • niet emigrant
artist living in the Bay Area, will be
displayed in the office of City Super
visor Carol Ruth Silver until Sak
harov's fast ends.
Silver asked the Soviet Union to
make "a very simple gesture — allow
the Sakharovs to escape this brut;
treatment." She then read Feinsteii
proclamation, which commends
outstanding member of the interna
tional community and his wife for
their fearless efforts on behalf of all
peoples."
Selma Light. founder of the Ba\
Area Council for Soviet Jews — Sak
halin has long assailed Soviet anti-
Semitism. and Bonner is Jewish —
reflected on her meeting with the
couple in 1975. when she delivered
the news that the dissident had been
awarded the Nobel Peace Pri/e.
"He is the the most impressive man
Ive ever met. she said. "We must
never forget this wonderful man who
has risked everything for the sake of
human rights."
Vladimir Bukovskv. the dissident
author exchanged by the Soviets for
the president ot Chilean Communist
Party in 1976, concurred.
"We came to know Sakharov when
he spoke 011 all sorts of social justice.
We are so used to hearing him defend
other people that we forget lie's not a
symbol of human rights — he's a
human being. Now it's time to defend
him," he said.
Bukovsky, who describes his experi
ence as a dissident in his book, "To
Build a Castle," said. "In prison. I
could immediately tell when the West
was protesting for my release. I could
see the fear in the eyes of the guards.
They knew."
As the rally ended about an hour
later, Bukovsky continued, "Here,
and in Europe, there is a big campaign
for Sakharov . He knows that, and that
is the greatest comfort for him."
Stanford is very much a part of that
"big campaign." according to rally
moderator Morris Pripstein, a senior
physicist at Lawrence Livermore Na
tional Laboratory and SOS chairman.
"Don't doubt for a minute that the
(Soviet) Consulate in San Francisco
doesn't care. They look to Stanford
and Berkeley for the leaders of the
future. They read your papers, and
they're concerned. What you do
weighs heavily on their thinking."
