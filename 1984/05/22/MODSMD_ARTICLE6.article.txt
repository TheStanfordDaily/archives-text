U.S. scoffs at Soviet subs
Washington — Reagan administration officials yesterday
scoffed at Soviet claims of improved nuclear submarine capa
bility off II.S coasts, saying the increase in such deployment
involves only two submarines of a type that may have been in
U.S. waters previously.
Responding to an assertion Sunday by Soviet Defense Min
istet Marshal Dmitri Ustinov about increased submarine ca
pability. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said: "This
is a familiar litany of Soviet assertions and threats. There is
essentially no change in the strategic situation."
Other administration officials, speaking on condition that
they not be identified, said the additional deployment in
creased the Soviet submarine fleet off U.S. coasts from five to
seven and was not significant. One official called Ustinov's
statement in a Tass news agency interview "more political
than military."
Administration officials acknowledged that the U.S.
response also is political. One official said the administration
is "walking a tightrope" in its response because of conflicting
policy and political objectives.
Politically, the administration is trying to quiet public fears
about Reagan policies based on what appears to be a steady
deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations reflected in harsh ex
changes of rhetoric and such incidents as the Soviet
withdrawal from the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
Soviets won't resume talks
Moscow — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko yes
terday spurned a West German appeal to resume nuclear
arms negotiations with the United States, insisting that all
Pershing II and cruise missiles must first be removed from
Western Europe.
In his sixth meeting in the past 12 months with his West
German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Gromyko
repeatedly attacked the United States, accusing its leadership
of pursuing a course of confrontation while trying to disrupt
military parity between East and West.
During three hours of talks in the Kremlin, Gromyko told
Genscher that Washington must bear the blame for the dan
gerous state of East-West relations.
The vehemence of Gromyko's criticism took West German
officials by surprise. They said Genscher felt compelled to in
sert a phrase later into his luncheon address rejecting "these
unjust and undeserved reproaches to our American friends."
The tough line adopted by Gromyko, coupled with Mos
cow's announcement Sunday that it had increased the number
of submarine-based missiles located close to American
shores, heightened concerns among West German officials
that prospects remain bleak for an improvement in super
power relations before the end of the year.
U.S. delegates agree to control
computer exports to East
During closed meetings in Paris two weeks ago. a U.S.
delegation reached a working-level agreement within the
Western alliance's Coordinating Committee on Multilateral
Export Controls on a procedure to control the movement of
small computers to the East.
The formula still must win unanimous approval from the
allied governments, and its details are classified. But it
reportedly sets limits on the quality of technology that can be
sold without an export license, limiting only the quantity of
less-sophisticated computers that can be sold in bulk to the
Soviets or their allies.
The quality cap is thought to be substantially higher than
the Apple 11, which rates a 2 on a scale of computer speed
that reaches a maximum of 1000.
Secretary of State George Shultz on May 5 tried to lay to
rest the fears of allies that the administration is bent on
sacrificing U.S. relations with its trading partners to keep
sensitive American technology from winding up in Soviet
hands.
"The essence of our approach is to reduce the problem
from an issue of principle to a practice of problem-solving,"
Shultz said. "This is because . . . there is a higher principle at
stake: The political unity of the democratic nations."
German metalworkers strike
Hamburg, West Germany — The West German metal
workers' union extended its strike to the state of Hesse yes
terday with 33,000 union members joining in the battle for a
35-hour workweek with no reduction in pay.
A total of 57.000 metalworkers are now on strike at key
plants, with employers planning retaliatory lockouts starting
today.
About 65,000 workers will be locked out in the southwes
tern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. Elsewhere in West Ger
many most of the major automakers have ordered temporary
shutdowns or shorter shifts due to a shortage of parts.
The labor dispute leaves as many 250,000 people short of
money just before the start of the summer vacation season.
The strikers are paid benefits by their union. But the union
has not said yet whether it will pay members who are locked
out or put on shortened shifts.
Other employees outside the North Baden-Wuerttemberg
Labor District who are temporarily laid off also face a period
without income. Workers inside the labor district, who are
not metalworkers but are affected by the effects of the strike,
will receive welfare payments.
Ruling may reopen race issue
Los Angeles — A Supreme Court ruling that the NAACP
may sue state school officials in the Los Angeles integration
case may bring about a "statewide school district," the state
system's top lawyer said yesterday.
And Bill Honig, the state superintendent of public instruc
tion. said he hopes the decision won't "reopen this wound'' of
racial dispute after the courts have already ruled in the Los
Angeles case.
"I'd hate to go through this turmoil again," Honig said in
Los Angeles, where he was attending a curriculum confer
ence.
In Sacramento. Roger Wolfertz. acting counsel for the state
Department of Education, warned that the case could eventu
ally lead to far greater state control over local districts.
"What that in effect is going to do is lead to a statewide
school district." Wolfertz said. "The Circuit Court has told us
we are in effect responsible for segregation actions of school
districts."
"If they (the courts) require the state to take over, that's
pressure for more state control," Honig said.

U.S. scoffs at Soviet subs
Washington — Reagan administration officials yesterday
scoffed at Soviet claims of improved nuclear submarine capa
bility off II.S coasts, saying the increase in such deployment
involves only two submarines of a type that may have been in
U.S. waters previously.
Responding to an assertion Sunday by Soviet Defense Min
istet Marshal Dmitri Ustinov about increased submarine ca
pability. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said: "This
is a familiar litany of Soviet assertions and threats. There is
essentially no change in the strategic situation."
Other administration officials, speaking on condition that
they not be identified, said the additional deployment in
creased the Soviet submarine fleet off U.S. coasts from five to
seven and was not significant. One official called Ustinov's
statement in a Tass news agency interview "more political
than military."
Administration officials acknowledged that the U.S.
response also is political. One official said the administration
is "walking a tightrope" in its response because of conflicting
policy and political objectives.
Politically, the administration is trying to quiet public fears
about Reagan policies based on what appears to be a steady
deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations reflected in harsh ex
changes of rhetoric and such incidents as the Soviet
withdrawal from the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
Soviets won't resume talks
Moscow — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko yes
terday spurned a West German appeal to resume nuclear
arms negotiations with the United States, insisting that all
Pershing II and cruise missiles must first be removed from
Western Europe.
In his sixth meeting in the past 12 months with his West
German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Gromyko
repeatedly attacked the United States, accusing its leadership
of pursuing a course of confrontation while trying to disrupt
military parity between East and West.
During three hours of talks in the Kremlin, Gromyko told
Genscher that Washington must bear the blame for the dan
gerous state of East-West relations.
The vehemence of Gromyko's criticism took West German
officials by surprise. They said Genscher felt compelled to in
sert a phrase later into his luncheon address rejecting "these
unjust and undeserved reproaches to our American friends."
The tough line adopted by Gromyko, coupled with Mos
cow's announcement Sunday that it had increased the number
of submarine-based missiles located close to American
shores, heightened concerns among West German officials
that prospects remain bleak for an improvement in super
power relations before the end of the year.
U.S. delegates agree to control
computer exports to East
During closed meetings in Paris two weeks ago. a U.S.
delegation reached a working-level agreement within the
Western alliance's Coordinating Committee on Multilateral
Export Controls on a procedure to control the movement of
small computers to the East.
The formula still must win unanimous approval from the
allied governments, and its details are classified. But it
reportedly sets limits on the quality of technology that can be
sold without an export license, limiting only the quantity of
less-sophisticated computers that can be sold in bulk to the
Soviets or their allies.
The quality cap is thought to be substantially higher than
the Apple 11, which rates a 2 on a scale of computer speed
that reaches a maximum of 1000.
Secretary of State George Shultz on May 5 tried to lay to
rest the fears of allies that the administration is bent on
sacrificing U.S. relations with its trading partners to keep
sensitive American technology from winding up in Soviet
hands.
"The essence of our approach is to reduce the problem
from an issue of principle to a practice of problem-solving,"
Shultz said. "This is because . . . there is a higher principle at
stake: The political unity of the democratic nations."
German metalworkers strike
Hamburg, West Germany — The West German metal
workers' union extended its strike to the state of Hesse yes
terday with 33,000 union members joining in the battle for a
35-hour workweek with no reduction in pay.
A total of 57.000 metalworkers are now on strike at key
plants, with employers planning retaliatory lockouts starting
today.
About 65,000 workers will be locked out in the southwes
tern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. Elsewhere in West Ger
many most of the major automakers have ordered temporary
shutdowns or shorter shifts due to a shortage of parts.
The labor dispute leaves as many 250,000 people short of
money just before the start of the summer vacation season.
The strikers are paid benefits by their union. But the union
has not said yet whether it will pay members who are locked
out or put on shortened shifts.
Other employees outside the North Baden-Wuerttemberg
Labor District who are temporarily laid off also face a period
without income. Workers inside the labor district, who are
not metalworkers but are affected by the effects of the strike,
will receive welfare payments.
Ruling may reopen race issue
Los Angeles — A Supreme Court ruling that the NAACP
may sue state school officials in the Los Angeles integration
case may bring about a "statewide school district," the state
system's top lawyer said yesterday.
And Bill Honig, the state superintendent of public instruc
tion. said he hopes the decision won't "reopen this wound'' of
racial dispute after the courts have already ruled in the Los
Angeles case.
"I'd hate to go through this turmoil again," Honig said in
Los Angeles, where he was attending a curriculum confer
ence.
In Sacramento. Roger Wolfertz. acting counsel for the state
Department of Education, warned that the case could eventu
ally lead to far greater state control over local districts.
"What that in effect is going to do is lead to a statewide
school district." Wolfertz said. "The Circuit Court has told us
we are in effect responsible for segregation actions of school
districts."
"If they (the courts) require the state to take over, that's
pressure for more state control," Honig said.
