Washington — The Reagan adminis
tration is prepared to intervene militarily
in the Iran-Iraq war to prevent an
Iranian victors that would install a radi
cal Shia government in Iraq, according to
high military and State Department
sources.
These sources said that the policy,
decided upon late last year, might re
quire a commitment ol U.S. air support
on the side of the Iraqi government, hut
that it was unlikely ground combat units
would he sent to assist Iraq.
President Reagan has sent a letter to
King Fahd ot Saudi Arabia seeking
access to Saudi airfields for American
aircraft in the event a decision is made to
protect Persian Gulf shipping trom at
tacks by Iran, a U.S. official said yester
day.
The letter was being delivered by
Richard Murphy, assistant secretary ot
state for Mideast affairs, said the official,
who insisted on anonymity. Murphy
went to Riyadh on Sunday and is ex

pected to return to Washington today.

on Saudi and other oil tankers in the gull.
Washington lias suggested to the gull na
tions, especially Saudi Arabia, that it
would be willing to consider providing
American air cover it they would permit
U.S. aircraft to use their airfields.
The Arab nations didn't agree to
American use ol the airfields when the
subject came up at lower levels, but
Reagan's letter to the Saudi king raises
the issue to the highest level.
The I S. official who revealed that the
letter was sent said that making gulf air
fields available to American aircraft
would he on a contingency basis and that
a decision on whether to defend gulf
shipping is unlikely for the time being.
One military official said new policy
toward Iraq amounted to a decision by
the administration that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein "should not be allowed
to fall A senior State Department offi
cial disagreed with this formulation on
the grounds that it implied support for a

particular leader. But he said the col
lapse ot Iraq and the installation ot a new
regime would be highly disturbing lor the
region and tor U.S. interests.
"We do not want to see the govern
ment in Baghdad destabilized. We want
to see a stable and internally secure Iraq.
We see it as the first line ol defense
against Iranian expansionism, whether
Shia expansionism or Iranian im
perialism." this official said.
Disclosure of the policy may shed a
new light on the events of the past week
in the Persian Gulf, and the U.S.
response. After both Iran and Iraq at
tacked tankers in the Persian Gulf, the
United States offered to provide Air
Force protection to keep trade flowing in
and out ol the Gulf. The military situa
tion has not deteriorated to the point
that any Gulf state has sought such aid.

ficials described the attacks on shipping
as largely symbolic and the U.S. offer as
largely a psychological move to calm
fears of ship-owners, oil-producing

countries and the world oil market.
Until recently, the United States main
tained generally neutral posture in the
lone war. But a secret National Security
Decision Directive ol early last Novem
ber has led to a series ol actions and con
sultations that ha\e benefitted Iraq, ac
cording to the high officials.
••We want to keep Iraq in the iickl and
get the war ended." the State Depart
ment official said. The administration
lias approved substantial agricultural
credits and improved political relations
with Baghdad, which have improved
Iraq's overall oredit situation, he said.
Military officials said these principles
would guide U.S. involvement:
• The United States will not act unless
invited by countries in the area.
• The countries must be willing to pro
vide facilities for U.S. forces.
• It at all possible. U.S. action will be in
concert with that of other countries in
the region and of Western allies.
• Finally, any U.S. aid will be of a defen
sive character.
