# Amnesty International accuses El Salvador
## 
### 
London (AP) — Amnesty In
ternational accused the govern
ment of El Salvador yesterday
of ordering the deaths of many
of the estimated 40.000 people
murdered there in the past five
years.
Meanwhile. El Salvador's
president-elect, Jose Napoleon
Duarte. who said he is commit
ted to eliminating his country's
death squads, declared in a
meeting with President Reagan
yesterday that it would be im
moral to ask U.S. troops to tight
in El Salvador's civil war.
Amnesty International said
there had been "blatant failure"
by authorities in the Central

American country to investigate
the killings. It is the "authorities
themselves who lie behind the
wholesale extrajudicial execu
tions," charged the London
based human rights group,
which won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1977.
In a 48-page report. Amnesty
said the authorities' intimida
tion of lawyers, medical ex
aminers and witnesses,
manipulation of evidence and
refusal to cooperate with inter
national agencies seeking to
identify the killers, also pointed
to government involvement.
Without police investigations,
the government s claim that the

killings were carried out by
right-w ing extremists or the left
wing opposition couldn't be
verified, it said.
Amnesty said its report was
based on information from gov
ernment sources, newspaper
stories and testimony by sur
vivors of death squad attacks
collected in July last year.
Amnesty quoted a National
Police defector as saying secret
killing missions were under
taken by specially trained police
units who often disguised them
selves as students or opponents
of the government.
A survivor of an attempted
execution told Amnesty re

searchers he was arrested by
men in plain clothes, inter
rogated under torture at secur
ity forces headquarters, lined tip
with others and shot in the head
at close range. He was the only
one to survive.
The report said decapitated
and disfigured corpses were
routinely dumped in heavily
patrolled areas near police or
military establishments to in
timidate the population.
In numerous instances of
"disappearances" of foreigners,
relatives and lawyers received
no cooperation from authori
ties, the report said.
Duarte, speaking before the

Washington World Affairs
Council, said he would "never
ask for any presence of foreign
troops in our country. It would
he immoral to ask for the li\es
of young Americans."
Duarte said he wanted new
U.S. military aid. hut he
rejected all ot the human rights
conditions demanded hy
Democrats in Congress.
"We agree with the objectives
and intentions of those who
would condition aid," he said.
"(But) to impose unilateral
conditions on the people in the
name of democracy is to take
away part of the freedom for
which they are fighting."
