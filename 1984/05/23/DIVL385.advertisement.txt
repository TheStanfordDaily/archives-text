Can you fill this
space?
Sometimes at The
Daily we get strange
spaces like this one.
Sometimes the editorial
department and the ad
vertising department
don't always com muni
cnte rijtht. That's why we
get strange spaces like
this one. That's why we
need you.
You can fill this
space.
Not many people know
how to fill a 13-inch long
space this narrow. What
would you do if you had
13 inches? Most people
wouldn't be able to come
lip with anything to do
the job. But we know you
can. We've seen you
before.
How do you fill this
space?
We know you've been
here before. You came by
to pick up a story or
photo assignment a long
time ago. Or maybe you
just came in to drop off a
Once Aroung the Ouad
announcement or a letter
to the editor. But you
didn't stay long, did you?
Now we want you to
come back. Drop by The
Daily and pick up a story
or photo assignment.
We'll show you how to
use the computer. We'll
show you how to write
leads. We'll show you
how to develop film.
We'll show you how to
fill this space.
Fill this space.
We're not asking you.
you understand.
Sometimes in life you just
don't have a choice.
We're telling you we
need you. Remember all
that stuff about a friend
in need being a friend
indeed? Well. bud. it's
true. And we're in need.
Be a friend indeed.
Please?
This space.
This space isn't brought
to you as a public service
of this station and the Ad
Council. It's brought to
you by us. We want you.
Bad. So come on in. And
fill this space.
