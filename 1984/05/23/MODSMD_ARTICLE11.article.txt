# In California primaries, the unusual is usually usual
## 
### 
No California election is quite nor
mal in the eyes of the rest of the na
tion, but this year's Democratic
presidential primary June 5 may be
more perplexing than most.
The political cliche is that California
is above all a media state.

I he logistics of campaigning in Cali
fornia are staggering compared with
any other state except possibly New
York. I here are 24.7 million Califor
nians scattered over 15K,693 square
miles.
I hey live in an area that stretches
900 miles between Crescent City on
the north and San Diego in the south.

And because of California's unique
political history, dating to progressive
election reforms early in this century,
there is no party political organization
comparable with the wards and
precincts of Chicago or New York
City or Philadelphia.

The cumulative effect of such
reforms, designed to take political
power away from business corpora
tions led by the Southern Pacific Rail
road, was to leave the state with little
political clout in any one sector, in
cluding the parties. For instance, all
city and county elections still are non
partisan.

One rule of thumb in California is
that the candidate with the most
money to spend on television advertis
ing and the most endorsements Irom
the biggest Hollywood stars is consid
ered the favorite.
Based on that standard. Sen. Gary
Hart (D-Colo.) has been designated
by some experts as the early front
runner over former Vice President
Walter Mondale and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson. The polls have seesawed be
tween Hart and Mondale.
But Rep. Vic Fazio (D-
Sacramento), a leading Mondale sup
porter in Northern California, is one
of a number of California political ex
perts who is not certain what sort of
scenario will unfold in the Golden
State this year.
"You look at money for TV and
neither candidate has it," Fazio said in
an interview in his Washington office
this week. "Hart can't raise it and
Mondale is up against the spending
limit."
Jackson has had very little television

advertising in any primary state to
date and is not likely to have much in
California.
"It's going to be a strange election,"

said Fazio. "In my district. Hart and
Mondale are very close, based on the
polls I have seen. Mondale is ahead in

Sacramento and Solano Counties and
behind in Yolo (County). Hart pulls
from agriculture on the right and the
liberal students on the left. Mondale is
getting the blue-collar, middle-class
voter."
There is another wild card that
makes this election different from any
other California primary. There is no
direct voting for the candidates on the
long, complex ballot. Rather, Califor
nians for the first time will cast votes
only for individual delegates listed as
supporting one of six Democratic can
didates: Ohio Sen. John Glenn, Hart.
Jackson. Mondale, Lyndon Laßouche
and former South Dakota Sen.
George McGovern.
Glenn and McGovern have dropped
out of the presidential contest but
have not removed their names from
the ballot.
Voters in some areas will be con
fronted by ballots with as many as 60
names of candidates to be delegates to
the Democratic National Convention
in San Francisco in July, said Karen

Daniel, an elections official in the Cal
ifornia secretary of state's office.
In many districts, the voter will have
to turn to a second, third or fourth baU
lot page to find all the delegate
candidates since hundreds o1
thousands of ballots will be printed in
Spanish as well as English. The name?
of prospective delegates are clustered
by candidate, and the candidate s
name appears in parentheses beneath
each delegate's name.
The complexities of the ballot and
the three-hour time difference from
the East Coast means it will likely be
the next day before much of the nation
has a clear idea who won.
One thing that is clear, however, is
that California has an important pri
mary for the first time in 12 years.
With the proliferation of more prima
ries and earlier primaries in the 1960s
and 19705, the presidential nomina
tions usually have been determined
well before the Golden State has
voted.
