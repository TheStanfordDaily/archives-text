## The 						Stanford Daily Allow frosh athletics

Consider the following hypothetical example:
John, an intelligent high school senior and three
sport athlete, wants to attend a prestigious West
( oast university. The school's athletic depart
ment actively recruits the catch, knowing he is a
guaranteed goldmine in the ticket-selling depart
ment. John arrives the following September,
eager to hone his spirals and free throws
against the best the college world has to offer.
An absurd situation, to be sure, but just play
along.
According to a new proposal by two University
of California chancellors, John may have to wait
quite a while before he gets his chance.
"1 think the idea of letting freshmen participate
in football and probably basketball is a very bad
idea," said Ira Heyman, chancellor of UC-
Berkeley. His UCLA counterpart agreed: "My
experience is that the transition to my school is a
difficult enough task, even for the student who
comes well-prepared, without the pressure of ath
letics."
Their suggestion falls on the heels of a slew of
rules changes by the NCAA that will supposedly
make it tougher for college freshmen to partici
pate in sports. For example, beginning in 1986,
the NCAA will require freshmen to have tallied
at least a C average in high school and to have
earned a combined score of at least 700 on the
SAT tests in order to be eligible for college ath
letic competition.
Proponents assert that such changes will ensure

freshmen a smooth transition and better grades.
On the contrary, the chancellors' plan will only
wrinkle transitions. Any freshman athlete who is
qualified to play at the NCAA varsity level spent
many an hour training and competing during high
school and before. If the system prohibits John
from continuing this practice — in effect denying
him a much-rehearsed release — John's ability to
focus on academics will likely be diminished. 1 he
trauma of not playing would be greater than the
trauma of playing.
But proponents say that competition will not be
terminated, just curtailed. Freshmen teams will
play a shorter schedule with fewer games. The in
tensity will be toned down.
This too may backfire. Many hotshot athletes
may opt to bypass college altogether, and head
straight to professional sports (names like John
McEnroe come to mind — the ruling could con
ceivably extend to tennis and all other sports). In
this sense the NCAA would be discouraging edu
cation.
College freshmen — IS- and 19-year-olds —
are mature enough to manage their own time.
Some of the NCAA's suggestions to de
emphasize athletics for academics are right on
target, and, in fact, may be too tame; but to deny
athletes their right to participate not only sets a
dangerous precedent, but it tails to solve the prob
lem. Universities need to increase their commit
ment to education, not decrease student activities.
Athletics and academics are compatible.
