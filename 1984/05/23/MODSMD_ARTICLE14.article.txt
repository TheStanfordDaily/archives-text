## Defining 'human' 
### 
Jason Matherly's condemnation of
abortion as the equivalent of murder
(Daily, May 17) is problematic and
cannot be left unanswered. The root
of the problem, as Matherly correctly
identities it, lies in the controversy
over the human or non-human nature
of the unborn child.
He errs, however, when he casually
states that the fetus is human from
the moment of conception, since "any
organism carrying the genetic code of
homo sapiens is human, just as you or
I."
From this premise, he concludes
that the destruction of a fetus is an
act. o\ unmitigated murder. To Math
erh a single, unicelluar. microscopic
/vgote is lull\ human and enjoys all
the rights of a human being. Further
more. he implies that every single cell
in our body is human, since it con
tains the human genetic code. If this
is true, we are all made up of millions
of other human beings. Whenever I
destroy some of my own cells, by
drinking alcohol, for example, I sud
denly become a despicable mass
murderer.
C learly Matherly's view of what
constitutes a human being is inade
quate. To be human. 1 would suggest,
requires certain essential characteris
tics such as consciousness, intelligence
and something of a human bodily
form. Admittedly, it is hard to deter
mine at what point all these are pres
ent in a fetus — I make no claim to
do so here.
However, we can be certain of at
least one thing: There does exist a
period in pregnancy during which the
letus possesses none of these features.
A minute cluster of a few hundred
cells, for instance, is obviously not
conscious, intelligent or human in
form — it is not a human being. Its
abortion simply does not amount to
murder.
If the fetus has any value in the

earliest stages of pregnancy, it lies
only in being a potential human
being. Many would argue that this
potential outweighs the mother's right
to her body (I would argue the
reverse). Nevertheless, the destruc
tion of even a potential human being
is not murder — one can't murder a
person who does not yet exist.
