## Statement supporting Local 680 
### 
We, undersigned members of the Stanford com
munity, urge the University to recognize USW
Local 680 of the Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) as the bargaining agent for the 1300
workers in the Technical, Maintenance and Service
Unit. The transfer of responsibilities has been re-

VIEWPOINT

quested and approved by local elected Stanford
union officers, by the Executive Board of Local
715, by the International (SEIU) and by the Stan
ford workers themselves.
The University administration's refusal to recog
nize the validity of the April 18 vote of union
members has brought an ungracious halt to the
collective bargaining process at Stanford. Stanford
employees who had struggled for years to make
this process a reality here will, if the administration
persists in its present course, be deprived of union
representation and support for the first time since
1973.
It seems clear that all parties concerned have en
dorsed the change, with a remarkably strong vote

of support for 680 from the unit workers. Only the
Stanford administration lias withheld cooperation.
In a letter addressed to the community on May 7,
University President Donald Kennedy asserts that
'■alter 11 years of experience with Local 680 and
Local 715 ... the University does not regard
either group as a responsible union representa
tive."
It may he remembered that on the occasion of
an attempt by clerical workers to participate in the
collective bargaining process, Kennedy also sent
out to the entire community a message declaring
his personal distaste for unionization at Stanford.
("I want my own position in this election to be
clear from the outset," he wrote on Jan. 27, 1981.
"1 believe it would be a mistake to unionize.")
But at the core of the very idea of collective bar
gaining is the principle that if is the workers them
selves and not the employers or their delegated
manager who decide whether they should seek
representation and who can represent them most
responsibly and most effectively. That is the
employees decision and theirs alone.
We therefore find the administration's posi

tion and Kennedy s statement doubly disturbing.
There is first the immediate threat of loss of union
representation by the Stanford employees in the
IMS unit — representation which they have or
ganized. struggled and voted for through more
than a decade and most recently on April IS.
In addition, there is added more than a hint that
the future of collective bargaining at Stanford is in
jeopardy. Is the inevitable strife, the bitterness, the
sense ot betrayal that may well ensue worth the ad
ministration's apparent resolution to deny the
workers representation by any union that the ad
ministration does not stamp with its won seal of
approval?
We do not believe so. We urge that the bargain
ing unit workers' vote be respected and that the
University recognize USW Local 680 as their
legitimate agent without further <loUw

ian. Denis Phillips is a professor of education. Dow
