## Handguns needed for citizen protection 
### 
In recent weeks two articles have
appeared on the opinions page of The
Daily against handguns which contain
errors, misrepresent the facts and
propagate the myths surrounding
handguns. The authors of both articles

VIEWPOINT

state that the Supreme Court upheld
the Morton Grove handgun ban. In
fact, the Supreme Court simply
decided not to hear the case which will
be heard before the Illinois Supreme
Court. As students of law or political
science, these writers should realize
the difference between not hearing a
case and giving a ruling.
When Chip Pitts states that groups

such as the NRA want an
"anachronistic" interpretation of the
Second Amendment, however, he
may be quite accurate. A very detailed
study of the history of the formation of
the Second Amendment was con
cluded recently. Its findings are inter
esting. Common law clearly gives indi
viduals the right to protect themselves
from death or serious bodily injury at
the hands of another by whatever
means are necessary.
It follows that the individual has a
right to own the tools necessary to
defend one's life. The writers of the
Second Amendment were aware of
this and a study of their notes and let
ters showed that this is exactly what
they had intended. That is, the indi

vidual was to be guaranteed the right
to own arms to be used in a lawful
manner. As to the term "militia," it
was not until the Supreme Court ruled
that this was the National Guard did
the word have any such meaning. The
origins and use of the word for
hundreds of years were researched
and it became clear that at the time
the writing of the Second Amend
ment, "militia" referred to all able
bodied men — as individuals — not as
part of a National Guard.
Other fallacies exist in Pitts' article.
He cites the lower incidence of hand
gun deaths in other countries but does
not mention that even in Britain these
numbers are increasing and the police
there are pressing to carry guns.

A handgun is a very useful tool that
allows anyone who knows how to use
it to he equal to and be able to defend
himself against a violent attacker. The
right to possess such a tool to be used
if necessary also carries responsibili
ties just as driving a car does. Anyone
who purchases a firearm must learn to
handle it safely.
I for one am willing to take the re
sponsibilities necessary to secure the
safety of myself and loves ones from
such people as much as possible and
encourage others to do the same.
