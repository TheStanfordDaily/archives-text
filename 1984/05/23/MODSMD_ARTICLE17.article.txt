"Hawaii — isn't that the 51st state?!"
I could not believe it. This cab driver bad
crossed into dangerous territory with that remark.
I'd grown accustomed to taking lots of crap about
being from Hawaii, like "Is this your first time in
the states?" "What is the language you speak over
there?" "How long did it take you to ride your pig
to school every day?" or my personal favorite:
"Have they controlled those marauding cannibal
tribes that roam the beaches in search of American
flesh?"
But Hawaii — the 51st state? No, it was too
much. It insulted my intelligence, my education,
my very core. I felt like taking a shower.
1 just couldn't take it anymore. It was the straw
that broke the camel's back. Sure, this was Wash
ington. D.C., and I should've been happy that the
cretin had even heard of Hawaii, but it was time to
strike back. It was time to levy a withering punish
ment on that depraved cabbie.
1 briefly contemplated paying the fare with
Indian-head nickels, but rejected the idea out of
hand. I didn't have 100 Indian-head nickels on me
I would have to get him to stop at a bank, and I
figured that walking back to the cab with a large
sack might arouse his suspicion. That would be no
good. I had to strike fast, cleanly, with precision
and surprise.
I took the garrote out of my backpack. This
would be perfect. A little excessive, but perfect.
But just then, lie said something that saved his
wretched life: "So. uh. you folks don't need a pass
port any more to get over here, huh?!"
This guy was serious. This guy was honestly
stupid. "Reagan has things under control over
; here'.' Yes, \es and we ev. n have free elections, I

thought to myself. But this was not funny anymore.
This cabbie is ignorant, just out and out ig
norant. ... A stunning, living commentary on the
plight of America's educational system. I thought
to myself from the Ivory Tower; to the myself that
is a soon-to-be Stanford graduate, on the road to
big money and professional careers, all primed for
loose cars and fast women. You know, the jet-set,
fulfilling life, just like you see on "Dynasty." But
the myself that didn't quite swallow the b.s. of that
inane role-playing game couldn't help but realize
that although the cabbie was plumb ignorant, he
had more smarts and a better grip on reality than
I'll ever have.
1 almost envied him. This guy had a clear-cut.
simple goal: to be free. With that goal in the back
of his head, he always lived in the present: enjoy
ing each moment for what it was, refusing to be
enslaved by delusions of grandeur or by the spectre
of phantom problems.
Ah yes, to be free. This guy knew how to edu
cate himself while still being free. He talked to
people, to sods like me and learned from them. He
no longer sought subordination at the hands of in
stitutions and textbooks. Rather, he had hit on
perhaps the greatest way to learn — from people
and their experiences.
With this knowledge came the absence of fear.
This guv had seen and experienced it all, and he
was still around to tell you about it. There was no
reason for him to fear. So he simply lived his life
without a lot of psychological baggage.
How is that this guy was "educated" and yet did
not know that there were 50 states in the union?
It's because lie had a good grip on life and what it
meant for him.
He turned down K Street — I was almost home.

my cab ride was almost over.
How does Stanford fit in to all this I thought?
What kind of education does Stanford offer? Well,
I figured out that it's all up to the individual. There
are many who have received an excellent educa
tion from books and professors but remain clueless
about life. There are those who have had an excel
lent education about life, but got nothing out of the
books. There are also those who have done both,
and neither. But whatever these people have got
ten out of Stanford has been a direct result of per
sonal effort, and is a function of personal goals to
make lots of money, save the world, etc.
As the cabbie turned onto Constitution Avenue,
it hit me.
Stanford will not challenge you. Stanford will
not force you. Stanfoid will not expose you to the
real worlds, to alternative environments and varied
situations. Oh. it will, but only up to a point. From
then on. you're on your own. Stanford is not in
dicative of any reality other than its own. It is a
very atypical place, nestled comfortably at the foot
of rolling hills and deliciously separate from the
trials and tribulations that life holds for the vast
majority of peoples. As I got out of the cab. I
thought that Stanford should open up an new over
seas campus: Stanford-in-Reality.
My cab nde ended. It was kind of sad, because I
realized that I'd probably soon forget all that I had
thought about and would quietly, with barely a
protest, settle back into that comfortable place at
the foot of rolling hills. But the cabbie, no. I
wouldn't forget him. I paid him, and walked up the
steps to m\ flat.

dicative of any reality other than its own. It is a
very atypical place, nestled comfortably at the foot
of rolling hills and deliciously separate from the
trials and tribulations that life holds for the vast
majority of peoples. As I got out of the cab. I
thought that Stanford should open up an new over
seas campus: Stanford-in-Reality.
My cab nde ended. It was kind of sad, because I
realized that I'd probably soon forget all that I had
thought about and would quietly, with barely a
protest, settle back into that comfortable place at
the foot of rolling hills. But the cabbie, no. I
wouldn't forget him. I paid him, and walked up the
steps to m\ flat.

"Hawaii — isn't that the 51st state?!"
I could not believe it. This cab driver bad
crossed into dangerous territory with that remark.
I'd grown accustomed to taking lots of crap about
being from Hawaii, like "Is this your first time in
the states?" "What is the language you speak over
there?" "How long did it take you to ride your pig
to school every day?" or my personal favorite:
"Have they controlled those marauding cannibal
tribes that roam the beaches in search of American
flesh?"
But Hawaii — the 51st state? No, it was too
much. It insulted my intelligence, my education,
my very core. I felt like taking a shower.
1 just couldn't take it anymore. It was the straw
that broke the camel's back. Sure, this was Wash
ington. D.C., and I should've been happy that the
cretin had even heard of Hawaii, but it was time to
strike back. It was time to levy a withering punish
ment on that depraved cabbie.
1 briefly contemplated paying the fare with
Indian-head nickels, but rejected the idea out of
hand. I didn't have 100 Indian-head nickels on me
I would have to get him to stop at a bank, and I
figured that walking back to the cab with a large
sack might arouse his suspicion. That would be no
good. I had to strike fast, cleanly, with precision
and surprise.
I took the garrote out of my backpack. This
would be perfect. A little excessive, but perfect.
But just then, lie said something that saved his
wretched life: "So. uh. you folks don't need a pass
port any more to get over here, huh?!"
This guy was serious. This guy was honestly
stupid. "Reagan has things under control over
; here'.' Yes, \es and we ev. n have free elections, I

thought to myself. But this was not funny anymore.
This cabbie is ignorant, just out and out ig
norant. ... A stunning, living commentary on the
plight of America's educational system. I thought
to myself from the Ivory Tower; to the myself that
is a soon-to-be Stanford graduate, on the road to
big money and professional careers, all primed for
loose cars and fast women. You know, the jet-set,
fulfilling life, just like you see on "Dynasty." But
the myself that didn't quite swallow the b.s. of that
inane role-playing game couldn't help but realize
that although the cabbie was plumb ignorant, he
had more smarts and a better grip on reality than
I'll ever have.
1 almost envied him. This guy had a clear-cut.
simple goal: to be free. With that goal in the back
of his head, he always lived in the present: enjoy
ing each moment for what it was, refusing to be
enslaved by delusions of grandeur or by the spectre
of phantom problems.
Ah yes, to be free. This guy knew how to edu
cate himself while still being free. He talked to
people, to sods like me and learned from them. He
no longer sought subordination at the hands of in
stitutions and textbooks. Rather, he had hit on
perhaps the greatest way to learn — from people
and their experiences.
With this knowledge came the absence of fear.
This guv had seen and experienced it all, and he
was still around to tell you about it. There was no
reason for him to fear. So he simply lived his life
without a lot of psychological baggage.
How is that this guy was "educated" and yet did
not know that there were 50 states in the union?
It's because lie had a good grip on life and what it
meant for him.
He turned down K Street — I was almost home.

my cab ride was almost over.
How does Stanford fit in to all this I thought?
What kind of education does Stanford offer? Well,
I figured out that it's all up to the individual. There
are many who have received an excellent educa
tion from books and professors but remain clueless
about life. There are those who have had an excel
lent education about life, but got nothing out of the
books. There are also those who have done both,
and neither. But whatever these people have got
ten out of Stanford has been a direct result of per
sonal effort, and is a function of personal goals to
make lots of money, save the world, etc.
As the cabbie turned onto Constitution Avenue,
it hit me.
Stanford will not challenge you. Stanford will
not force you. Stanfoid will not expose you to the
real worlds, to alternative environments and varied
situations. Oh. it will, but only up to a point. From
then on. you're on your own. Stanford is not in
dicative of any reality other than its own. It is a
very atypical place, nestled comfortably at the foot
of rolling hills and deliciously separate from the
trials and tribulations that life holds for the vast
majority of peoples. As I got out of the cab. I
thought that Stanford should open up an new over
seas campus: Stanford-in-Reality.
My cab nde ended. It was kind of sad, because I
realized that I'd probably soon forget all that I had
thought about and would quietly, with barely a
protest, settle back into that comfortable place at
the foot of rolling hills. But the cabbie, no. I
wouldn't forget him. I paid him, and walked up the
