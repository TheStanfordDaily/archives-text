## Tuning in to the social noise phenomenon 
### CLAY CALVERT Daily staff 
Each day at Stanford, stu
dents are exposed to intense
levels of noise, he it as part of
a screaming and stomping
crowd at a basketball game
with the Band cranking out
'All Right Now'' or alone on
the sundeck tuned in to a por
table stereo with headphones.
Right now, if you're reading
this in your dorm room with
the stereo blaring out your fa
vorite song, you could be
doing irreversible damage to
your ears.
This week The Daily ex
amines the hazards of noise
exposure to the hearing of
college students. Today's arti
cle, the first in a three-part se
ries, lends an ear to the rela
tionship between excessive
social noise and hearing.

Hearing loss has long been
thought of as a product of
aging and a problem prin
cipally of the elderly. But re
search today is showing that
most hearing problems
develop gradually over many
years. College students of
today, who, statistics show,
live longer than their coun
terparts of the 1940s and
's()s, will be more likely to
experience hearing problems
in their lifetime. What is es
pecially important, some of
the hearing problems that
appear in later years might
be avoided with a little
preventive care — unneces
sary noise exposure in the
teens and early 2()s can often
lead to hearing problems in
the future.
Today's student is exposed

to more sources of noise
personal stereos, high
volumes of cars and motor
cycles, discos — than those
of past generations, said
Holly Hosford Dunn, assis
tant professor and director of
audiology at the Stanford
Medical Center.
According to a report from
The Central Institute of the

Deaf (CIO), an institution
affiliated with Washington
University in St. Louis,
college-age students are
naturally inclined "to he
around sound and the
recognition of this by com

mercial interests are combin
ing for what might he called

the 'social noise
phenomenon^'
William Clark, a research
psychologist at C'lD, said

lead to hearing problems.

that one of the primary
reasons people are drawn to
sound is that "noise is
equated with power. For
many there is a direct rela
tion between the noise a
device makes and the power
it emits." Clark noted that
motorcycles that generate
the most noise, like many
sports cars, tend to be the
biggest sellers.
Another reason students
may be attracted to loud
sounds, according to Clark, is
that noise creates an aura of

excitement. "Noise stim
ulates the stress system,
causing a release of adrenelin
which increases the heart
rate and excites a person."
The CID report cites the
attractiveness of the
bar/restaurant atmosphere
among college students, such
as the ever-popular Chili's or
The Dutch Goose, as an ex
ample of the social noise
phenomenon where "the fo
cal point is often a large
screen TV featuring athletic
events or video music.
Elevated sound brings on
excitement and noise from

the watching, cheering, dan
cing, eating and drinking
crowd."
Clark echoed the senti
ments of Dunn that college
students are exposed to more
noise today than ever before,
something he attributes prin
cipally to the fact that there
are more people in the world
today than there were 20
years ago. "Due to the larger
population, there are more
cars, radios and other devices
capable of emitting high
levels of noise," Clark said.

The CID report added that
"Today's student is caught
right in the middle of this
(social noise) phenomenon.
Quiet is socially awkward, so
radios go everywhere. After
periods of relative silence in
the classrooms or libraries,
students may be impatient to
return to the relief of a 'high'
on noise."

amine the hazards of noise
exposure to the ear and ex
plore the long-range effects of
damage to the inner ear as a
result of excessive noise
during the college years.)
