# Separate lottery for unguaranteed
## Draw changes proposed 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
A University committee has recommended a new Draw
system for next year in which unguaranteed students will
draw from a chest of higher numbers than guaranteed stu
dents, lowering unguaranteed students' chances tor ob
taining highly coveted University housing.
A student advisory committee ratified this change and
several other amendments to current Draw policies and
recommended them to Residential Education, according
to Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of student affairs and
director of the Housing Center.
Whitney, who serves as an ex-officio member ot the
Committee on Services to Students — Residences (C OSS-
R), said the recommendations of the eight-person group
invariably determine Residential Education policy.
"Everything that has happened with the Draw and all
changes in Res Ed policy have gone through this commit
tee at some point," he said. "In nearly all cases, their re
commendation becomes policy."
The decision to prohibit unguaranteed students trom
drawing lower numbers than guaranteed students will
"spread the supply of good housing around and give pref
erence to guaranteed students," according to I im Hester
berg, a graduate student in statistics and spokesman for
the committee.
"Guaranteed students have not done as well as un
guaranteed students in round two (ol the Draw), Hes
terberg said, offering as evidence a detailed statistical rep
resentation of round two assignments from the 1983
Draw.
Hesterberg and Whitney said the change will make the
Draw more fair and will favor students who feel poor

Draw numbers have repeatedly banished them to un
desirable residences.
"On the con side, students must have the same
guaranteed-year status to draw together (next year).
Whitney added.
Other changes scheduled for next year will reduce the
number of S l (top) priorities in theme houses, replace cur
rent meal cards throughout campus with magnetic cards
and restrict groups entering the Draw to a maximum of
eight students.
•"SI priorities may be given only to returning residents
in a guaranteed year," the committee's minutes read.
"Theme houses which now give SI to students who have
taken a certain number of units in subjects related to the
theme should now give these students S2 priorities. Cer
tain other self-ops will also give S2 priorities to students
they now give SI priorities."
Magnetic meal cards, similar to those issued at Sterling
Quad, will be introduced to allow flexibility in meal plans,
Hesterberg said.
"One possibility is a plan offering a set number of meals
a week, which may be chosen from any ot the meals
served," the minutes read.
Limiting the number of students who may draw together
will prevent a small house from being dominated by too
large a group. Whitney said.
Two other areas in which the committee has recom
mended changes are walk-in assignments and exempt
spaces in self-ops.
The new walk-in policy will "make the system less ran
dom." Whitney said. Assignments next fall will be made
