# Separate lottery for unguaranteed
## Draw changes proposed 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
A University committee has recommended a new Draw
system for next year in which unguaranteed students will
draw from a chest of higher numbers than guaranteed stu
dents, lowering unguaranteed students' chances tor ob
taining highly coveted University housing.
A student advisory committee ratified this change and
several other amendments to current Draw policies and
recommended them to Residential Education, according
to Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of student affairs and
director of the Housing Center.
Whitney, who serves as an ex-officio member ot the
Committee on Services to Students — Residences (C OSS-
R), said the recommendations of the eight-person group
invariably determine Residential Education policy.
"Everything that has happened with the Draw and all
changes in Res Ed policy have gone through this commit
tee at some point," he said. "In nearly all cases, their re
commendation becomes policy."
The decision to prohibit unguaranteed students trom
drawing lower numbers than guaranteed students will
"spread the supply of good housing around and give pref
erence to guaranteed students," according to I im Hester
berg, a graduate student in statistics and spokesman for
the committee.
"Guaranteed students have not done as well as un
guaranteed students in round two (ol the Draw), Hes
terberg said, offering as evidence a detailed statistical rep
resentation of round two assignments from the 1983
Draw.
Hesterberg and Whitney said the change will make the
Draw more fair and will favor students who feel poor

Draw numbers have repeatedly banished them to un
desirable residences.
"On the con side, students must have the same
guaranteed-year status to draw together (next year).
Whitney added.
Other changes scheduled for next year will reduce the
number of S l (top) priorities in theme houses, replace cur
rent meal cards throughout campus with magnetic cards
and restrict groups entering the Draw to a maximum of
eight students.
•"SI priorities may be given only to returning residents
in a guaranteed year," the committee's minutes read.
"Theme houses which now give SI to students who have
taken a certain number of units in subjects related to the
theme should now give these students S2 priorities. Cer
tain other self-ops will also give S2 priorities to students
they now give SI priorities."
Magnetic meal cards, similar to those issued at Sterling
Quad, will be introduced to allow flexibility in meal plans,
Hesterberg said.
"One possibility is a plan offering a set number of meals
a week, which may be chosen from any ot the meals
served," the minutes read.
Limiting the number of students who may draw together
will prevent a small house from being dominated by too
large a group. Whitney said.
Two other areas in which the committee has recom
mended changes are walk-in assignments and exempt
spaces in self-ops.
The new walk-in policy will "make the system less ran
dom." Whitney said. Assignments next fall will be made
lirst by order on the waiting list, then
by a separate Draw for those not on
the list. "This way, students will have a
pretty good idea whether they're
going to get into Storey off the waiting
list or not," he said.
The committee advised adopting a
more stringent policy to discourage
self-ops from petitioning for more
than five exempt spaces for house offi
cers and theme associates.
Whitney said he was upset with a
Daily editorial recommending the
abolition of returning resident
priority. Only about 30 percent of
those who drew into relevant
residences this year had SI priorities,
and that number will go down after
round two. he said.
"COSS-R did an extensive, ex
haustive study of returning resident
priority last year and (concluded) the
priority is useful," Whitney said.
"Continuity in the residences is
desirable."

Both Hesterberg and Whitney ex
pressed a desire to maintain SI
priorioties in the suites as well as in
other residences because they felt con
tinuity is important in the isolated
suite environment.
However, Whitney said he is con
cerned with the suites' returning resi
dent priority because all four-person
suites for men were filled in round
one this year by students with the
priority. "Overall, in the suites, there
seems to be no problem (with the
priority)," Whitney said. "In the four
person men's suites, there seems to be
a problem."
But he added that only 33 percent
of all the suites were filled in round
one this year by students with the
priority.
No change in the suite policy is ex
pected for next year. But the commit
tee plans to examine whether Resi
dential Education should continue to
allow four-person suite members to
obtain a returning resident priority for
a six-person suite and vice-versa,
Whitney said.
"We keep tinkering with the system
to make it as fair as possible and to
maintain our own coals," he said.

tinuity is important in the isolated
suite environment.
However, Whitney said he is con
cerned with the suites' returning resi
dent priority because all four-person
suites for men were filled in round
one this year by students with the
priority. "Overall, in the suites, there
seems to be no problem (with the
priority)," Whitney said. "In the four
person men's suites, there seems to be
a problem."
But he added that only 33 percent
of all the suites were filled in round
one this year by students with the
priority.
No change in the suite policy is ex
pected for next year. But the commit
tee plans to examine whether Resi
dential Education should continue to
allow four-person suite members to
obtain a returning resident priority for
a six-person suite and vice-versa,
Whitney said.
"We keep tinkering with the system
to make it as fair as possible and to
maintain our own coals," he said.
