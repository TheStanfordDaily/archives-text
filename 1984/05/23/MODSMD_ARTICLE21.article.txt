Cosby cracks up Corvallis
People are still hav ing children and. accor
ding to comedian Bill Cosby, still don't have
a reason why. "'There is not one sane answer
that would come from these people," he told
students at Oregon State University.
Cosby performed for Moms' Weekend in
Gill Coliseum for a crowd of nearly 10.000.
The Daily Barometer reported that Cosby
was clad in orange OSU sweats and had
cigar in hand. Although he said that he
doesn't play universities much anymore,
Cosby didn't let the crowd down.
He spoke about his own children who are
in college, and complained that students
have too many vacations and they bring
home their dirty laundry.
"You're supposed to be intelligent
people." he told students. "You can't count,
and you can't save money to go to the
laudromat.
"That's why there are so many breaks. The
university has to send them home or it would
end up smelling."
Cosby also spoke about the cost of attend
ing college — the cost for parents, that is. He
told the audience about the first time he saw
the bill for his daughter's freshman year in
college.
"I looked at the bill and I told her Will
you be the only student?" "
According to Cosby, he spent $82,000 to
get his daughter a liberal arts degree which
"qualifies her to come back home."
To discourage his seven-year-old
daughter from attending college, Cosby said
he put Army posters in her room and started
singing "Be all that you can be ..."
Cosby also spoke about what it was like to
be a parent, and the difference between a
mother's and father's relationship with their
children.
"The reason why your mother won't let us
handle the children is because you want
them to Uve. Then they go around telling
them what we'll do to them."

Fight the freshman 10
Pizza overdose, fad diets consisting of
salad and ice cream and the freshmen 10 are
ail familiar threats to nutrition for Princeton
students, according to The Daily Prin
cetonian.
To deal with questions and problems con
cerning nutrition, a group of students have
organized a peer nutrition counseling pro
gram. Karen Gordon, director of the pro
gram. said that the advisers try to provide
accurate nutritional information and peer
support, and help students develop healthy
eating patterns.

dieting and nutrition tor athletes.
Nutritional problems often begin when
students leave home and take control over
their own diets. "When students first come
to Princeton, they are overwhelmed by the
variety and availabilit\ of food provided b\
DPS (food service)." Gordon said. '•You
may not like the food, but it's there."
Certain specific groups particularly con
cern the ad\isers. Athletes may want to alter
their diets to gain or lose weight or to im
prove their performance. But the group
which may be most in need of nutrition
counseling, according to Gordon, are wo
men "who are on a different diet every
week, or who think they're bulimic or
anorexic."
Gordon added that Princeton students
aren't too different from other college stu
dents with an emphasis on junk food. "But
there is no reason why people can't eat right.
There is plenty of good food available."

The results of a survey which studied the
ratio of women to men who are accepted to
college was recently presented in The Smith
College Sophian.
Elizabeth Savoca and Susan Carter, assis
tant professors of economics, conducted a
three-month study using 22,000 graduating
high school seniors across the country.
Up until 1970, there were no dramatic
changes in enrollment patterns in college.
Then as the draft came into effect and wo
men played a greater role in occupational
fields, variation in enrollment occurred.
There was a 15.5 percent increase in col
lege enrollment by women between 1972
and 1978, as opposed to a 2.5 percent in
crease by men.
The study also showed that women tended
to go to state universities, as opposed to
private, and to two-year colleges as opposed
to four-year. This suggests that women were
more sensitive to the cost of an education.
Rightly so, because studies also indicate that
men were more likely to receive financial
aid.

In the survey. 70 percent of male fresh
men could draw on their own income to help
finance their schooling.
Drinking for the game of it
The results of the Loyola Mary mount Al
cohol Awareness Survey were recently pub
lished in the Loyolan. More than 330 stu
dents were surveyed to obtain information
about the drinking patterns of I.MU stu
dents.
It was found that S3 percent of the stu
dents drink: of the 17 percent who do not.
the majority were women. Beer was voted
the most popular drink, although it is consid
ered primarily a "man's drink."
Both males and females cited drinking
games or contests as the most impelling fac
tor in their drinking. Second is a host who
constantly offers to refill drinks. Third is the
drinking patterns of friends.
The majority of students (93 percent)
report that they drink to relax and have fun.
76 percent said they drink for taste. Almost
half of the students drink to get high or
drunk, and that is approximately equal for
men and women.
When asked what situations had students
experienced because of drinking. 50 percent
said they have driven when they knew they
had too much to drink. 74 percent of
drinkers have had hangovers, and 60 percent
have gotten nauseated or vomited. Not

Dead week(end)
An editorial in the University of Pennsyl
vania's Weekly Collegian recently criticized

the University's decision to schedule two
reading days between final exam period and
the end of classes.
According to the editorial, "in its infinite
wisdom, the University's generosity happens
to occur on a weekend — namely Saturday
May 5 and Sunday May 6."
Given the extended nature ot semesters,
these extra catch-up days were originally a
welcome relief from the hurried routine of
the rcad-as-you-are-on-the-way-to-finals
process. However, hy scheduling the study
days tin the weekend, the university forfeits
its apparent goodwill and defeats the pur
pose of the idea, the editorial said.
As the editorial states, "The purpose, one
surmises, was to give the students two extra
days to study — days that they don't already
have. Whether the students would have used
the weekend in question to study anyway is
extraneous,"

Bowzer burritos
The Oilily Northwestern reported that it's
literally been a dog's life for the owner of I.a
Choza, a small Mexican restaurant in
Chicago.
Owner Sylvester Olavarria said someone
has been spreading an unfounded rumor that
La Choza uses dog meat as filler in its
Mexican dishes. The restaurant has been
losing customers because of this.
A report in the Chicago Sun-Times said
that Olavarria attributed the rumor to some
of his competitors or to Ins clientele, specifi
cally Northwestern students.
But Olavarria said his statements were
taken out of context. "I would be stupid of
me to accuse the students," he said. "The
last thing in my heart is to hurt the people
who support me."
The owner believes the rumor may have
started as a pun. One of the entrees featured
on La Choza's menu is called a "Chihuahua
Burrito."
Olvarria said he was thinking of the geo
graphic area, a small state in Northern
Mexico, not the pooch, when he named the
burrito. He also stressed that investigations
into the matter had produced no negative
findings.


Although the advisers are not allowed to
prescribe a diet or do any kind of therapeutic
counseling, they are trained to provide infor
mation on calories, coo"king, salt, sugar.


Movin' on up


surprisingly, 49 percent said they have done
something after drinking that they later
regretted.
The majority of non-drinkers do not drink
because they dislike the taste. Also, they do
not drink because of moral reasons because
they dislike the physical effects of alcohol.
