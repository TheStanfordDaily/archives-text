The sight of bikers milling
about the Stanford campus is
common here — a place where
bicycles are almost as numerous
as backpacks. Yet the helmeted
group clad in sleek black shorts
who gather at the Post Office on
weekday afternoons are not
\our average cyclists, and their
finely tuned two-wheelers carry
them far beyond a classroom in
the Quad.
They are the Stanford Cycling
Club, a club team which com
petes against IK other schools
throughout California.
The squad recently ended its
collegiate season by taking
second place at its season cham
pionship. where it was out
scored only by a much larger
UC-Santa Barbara squad. The
two teams had dominated the
field throughout the season,
which began during spring
break.
Stanford's cycling team has
26 members on its roster, six of
whom are women, and "just
about all of them compete regu
larly." according to coach Tim
Nicholson, a Stanford alumnus.
At least half of the team is
comprised of graduate students.

a trait which distinguishes it
from most collegiate sports
clubs.

stop running.
"Most used to be runners or
rowed crew, or they're skiiers
who cycle. A lot ol people are
runners who get injured. lobin
said. Because she is a skiier.
Tobin felt cycling "was a natural
thing to pick up."
The current interest in triath
lons — which includes cy cling as
one of its three legs — is also
bringing more people to the
sport, according to team mem
ber Eric Topp. "Once they get
on a good bike the bug bites
them a little bit." he said.
The team trains throughout
most of the school year, with

dailv rides ol 25 to nines u
places such as Old I a Honda
Road, and occasional 50- to
mile rides to the beach.
The Stanford area is excellent
for cycling because the team can
ride \ear-round, according to
Tobin. In addition, the team,
which often trains up along
Skyline Drive, is good on lulls.

New riders are encouraged to
join the team on training rides.

Although riders are split into
four groups tor competition
women, expert men. novice A
men and novice B men — the
entire team trains and travels to
races together. In addition,
good performances by riders in
all categories contribute to team
point totals.
Team members say they en
jo\ the team aspect ol cycling,
an unlikely team sport tor most
weekend riders. "This is really
my first chance to do a team
sport," said Topp. who values
the camaraderie the Stanford
team provides.
According to Kiesling. the
team is "a very cohesive group
of people. I here are a lot ot
friendships. They're people who
don't let cycling dominate their
lives, so they're interesting
people to get to know. 1 here s a
very strong sense ot team
spirit."
Teamwork is also important
to Tobin. "I've always wanted
to be a member of a team." she
said. "There's something about
the group dynamics of riding
with a team and maneuvering in
a pack that's exciting."
Team tactics and strategy are
an important part of racing.
"There's more teamwork than
you might realize," Topp said,
"l ots of strong riders can really
work to maximize the team
points."
One of the most difficult
aspects of strategy is that it
develops as a race progresses
and depends to a large extent
upon how strong each rider feels
during that particular race. No
situation is the same, and differ
ent cyclists have different
strengths, Kiesling said.
"The tactical variables are
enormous. You can't ever make
rules for how you're going to

ride a race," she said.
As a result, Tobin said, "an
interesting thing about cycling is
that you don't always have the
best people winning. On a good
team you shouldn't necessarily
have the same people winning
all the time," she said.
The use of team tactics makes
the interaction between the in
dividual and the team psy
chologically difficult for the
rider, and is one of the challeng
ing aspects of cycling, Kiesling
said.
"There are times when you
don't know if you're riding for
yourself or to support
teammates," she said. "You
have to know when you can
make sacrifices and when to ask
others to make sacrifices."
Kiesling also finds a psycho
logical challenge in the long
duration of cycling races relative
to many sporting events.
"One of the hard things about
cycling is being able to concen
trate for a long period of time,"
Kiesling said. "In cycling, you
can't do it on adrenaline."
The sport demands both men
tal, and physical ■endurance. "It

certainly is a very tough sport,"
Nicholson said. "It's just as de
manding as any sport you can
think of as for as endurance and
strength," he said.
But cycling is also "a really
fun sport." according to Topp.
"In fact, I think it's so fun that I
decided to stick around for an
extra year of graduate school so
I could race," he said.
Nicholson stressed the social
aspect of cycling as well. "I
would say we have a really
strong social group," he said.
"There are both men and wo
men involved, and we generally
have a good time."
Although the team has
finished its collegiate season,
many riders are continuing to
train.
"Most of the riders are
gearing up for their district or
state championships," Tobin
said. "Some will be going back
to their home states in hopes of
qualifying for nationals."
These races are sponsored by
the United States Cycling Fed
eration, the same organization
that chooses the Olympic cy
cling team.
