## Morales makes waves as freshman Olympic hopeful 
### TRASK LEONARD 
He does lap after lap of butterfly, his arms
making big circles and splashing back into the
water, his feet kicking methodically.
Even with the Olympic swimming trials a
month away, Pablo Morales is still concentrat
ing as well now as in the past, working his
body and his stroke in machine-like efficiency.
"It really hasn't dawned on me yet that the
Olympic trials are in a month." said Morales.
•Right now, I am just working on my stroke in
preparation for any future event. But, of
course, the Olympics have been in the back of
my mind for years."
Eor 12 years, to be more precise. That's
when the Stanford freshman began swimming
competitively. In his first year at Stanford,
Morales has achieved the the second-best
time by an American in the 100-meter butter
fly. clocking 53.7 seconds in the event. Also,
he placed third in the individual medley at the
national championships. And vet. his training
still must go on.
"I'm working about five hours a day now,
with at least four of those hours spent in the
water," explained Morales. "But as it gets
closer to the time for the trials, I'll be con
centrating less on the physical aspect of the
workout and more on the actual stroke.
Besides, it is always better to rest the body a
little before a major event."

The Olympic trials for swimming will be
held June 25-30 in Indianapolis. And from
what Morales has heard about the competi
tion to fill the two allotted spots in each event,
it will be a pressure-filled week.
"I've heard from lots of people that the
competition to make the U.S. team is just as
severe, if not more severe, than that of the ac
tual Games." said Morales. "Especially with
the boycott by the Eastern countries, it will
certainly be intense."
Morales has a great deal more to say about
the boycott of the Los Angeles Games.
"It's really too bad that politics has to enter
into the realm of athletics. Before the boycotts
of the last two Games, the Olympics was the
only place left for nations to come together
without the distractions of political turmoil.
"Unfortunately, with the events of the last
four years, I don't know if the Games have a
chance at surviving and maintaining the same
respect that it has had and should deserve,"
said Morales.
"The Soviets could have made an important
statement by actually coming to the Games.
They could have put aside all the political
overtones to the Olympics, and showed their
athletic talents at the same time," he contin
ued.
"Unfortunately, they didn't. What will hap
pen in the future I really don't know, but I

have to torget about that and concentrate on
my swimming first and foremost."
Aside from Florida's Mac Cribble, Morales'
main competition in the butterfly was to be
Soviet Vladimir Salnikov. But with the
boycott, the pair will not be able to square off.
I m really disappointed about missing the
opportunity to face off against two excellent
swimmers, he said. "But right now I can't
really dwell on that fact; 1 have to make the
American team first."
In preparation tor the trials and the Olym
pics, Morales has stopped out of school for the
spring quarter, putting the books aside tempo
rarily lor the opportunity to train for the
Olympics. He has moved to Concord, where
he now trains with his Amateur Athletic
Union team under the guidance of Mitch Ivy,
his long-time coach.
"1 m living in an apartment with a friend of
mine trying to get my thoughts together for
what I have to do," he said.
As an undeclared freshman. Morales has no
clear career goals at the present time. Coming
into Stanford, he wanted to be an aerospace
engineer, but alter taking a few classes, he
remains undecided.
"I really don't know what I want to do with
my lite right now, he said. "Like every other
treshman, I ve taken little else but freshman
English and Western Culture, so I haven't ex

plored ton mam fields. But it feels great to be
at a place with the combination of athletics
and academics like Stanford. There are still
plenty ol options for me."
Looking past the 19N4 Summer Olympics.
Morales is still considering participating in the
Games in Seoul. South Korea.
"I II be 23 in |ySN. and not too old for
Olympic competition. In (act. a current
record-holder. Da\e Lundc|uist. is 23 years
old. And I swim with a 2N-year-old in
workouts, he explained.
Morales looks beyond the obvious benefits
of championship swimming, namely win
ning races and setting records. I le also realizes
tin* all-around importance that s\\inimin» lias

played in his life.
"I've gotten more in return from swimming
than what I should, based on physical input.
I'\e been fortunate enough to travel to other
countries and see other people that I would
not ha\e been exposed to had I not been a
competitix e swimmer."
Morales realizes that Olympic competition
is ;t completely new experience for him. but he
plans to approach it the same way he would
approach any other race.
"What goes on around me I try not to think
about. I train for each race one step at a time,
and when another event approaches. I try to
look at it in the same wa\."
