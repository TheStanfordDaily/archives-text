# Cardinal golfers prepare for NCAA tournaments
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
It has been a very successful season so far for
both the Stanford men's and women's golf teams,
and, with a little luck, the squads will continue
their winning ways when they take the course for
this week's NCAA Tournament.
For the first time since 1978, Stanford will be
one of the 30-plus teams which will try to swing
their way to the NCAA crown when the NCAA
Men's Golf Championship begins today in Hous
ton. However, Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf has no
illusions about the difficulty of the task which lies
ahead of his five players.
"It's always tough when you go up against some
of these major college golf programs," said
Schaaf, listing top-ranked BYU, host team Hous
ton and defending champion Oklahoma State as
the teams to beat in the tournament.
As a result of their heavy competition, Schaaf
and his team are realistic about their goals, setting
their sights on making the cut to 15 teams on
Friday before looking ahead to Saturday's final

round.
The women's team, on the other hand, stands a
very good chance of seriously challenging for the
title. Led by freshmen Kathy McCarthy and Julie
Carmichael, the Cardinal has shot well enough to
be ranked in the top five nationwide at the end of
the season.
The Stanford women will be facing some tough
competition, however, primarily in the form of
NCAA powers Miami, Tulsa and Florida. In light
of this challenge, Coach Tim Baldwin concedes
that it will take a "spectacular performance and a
little bit of luck" for his Cardinal to win this
weekend in lnnisbrook, Fla.
On the individual side, McCarthy is the only
player on either team who could realistically take
home the NCAA title. With four tournament
championships and the WCAA Most Valuable
Player award under her belt already, McCarthy
certainly has the talent, but she will be giving
away a couple years of experience to her major
competitors.
