As Prof. John Kaplan continues his libel action
against Newsweek Magazine, four others associ
ated with classes mentioned in Newsweek On
Campus' "A Giggle of Guts" article said yesterday
they too didn't agree that their courses were
"micks" or "guts."
Two of the professors said they have seriously
considered legal action against Newsweek Maga
zine. a step Kaplan began because of the article.
Kaplan, a professor in the Law School and
teacher of the popular underÂ« raduw to course
"Criminal l.aw anil the Criminal Justice System,
is suing Newsweek Magazine for libel because he
says the magazine printed false information about
his course in the "A Giggle of Guts" article.
Newsweek Magazine will argue in a May 25
hearing that the case should be dismissed.
The article in the October issue of Newsweek
On Campus listed 1 1 classes which it called "an
all-American team of 1 1 gut courses." The courses
were taught at universities across the country.
"I'm appalled at the thoughtlessness and care
lessness of this article," said Prof. James Hooks,
who teaches "Theater Appreciation 1" at the Uni
versity of Florida. "There's not a damn thing funny
about it (the article)."
Newsweek's lawyers claimed in a brief filed with
the district court in San Jose that Kaplan's case
should be dismissed because, among other reasons.

"the real problem here is that Professor Kaplan is
unable to view'A Giggle of Guts' as the humorous
article it is."
But Hooks said that "the damage done by arti
cles like these to professors and their programs is
incalculable."
He said the reputation of his department has
been hurt by the article and that it will be more dif
ficult for the department to get funds from the uni
versity.
Newsweek said Hooks' course is a "gentle way
to earn three hours of credit in the humanities."
The class is meant, the magazine says, to
" develop an appreciation of theatre through a
study of theatre history and literature.' Transla
tion: students view movies of plays such as
'Oklahoma' and 'Oedipus Rex' and write two
papers on them per semester."
Hooks said the purpose of the course is to
"sensitize people to our theatrical heritage. . ..
Had anyone taken the time to investigate it they
would have found that the median grade in the
course is a C+. If that's a gut course, then I'm a
Japanese aviator.
"I may have some litigation in mind myself,"
Hooks said.
Gus Friedrich, chair of the Communications De
partment at the University of Oklahoma, said the
description of "Communications 2010: Apprehen
sion Reduction" was a "slipshod attempt to inves
tigate what's happening."

"Many of the students say that they have a
greater amount of work for this course than tor any
other course they've taken," Friedrich said.
Newsweek On Campus said of the course.
"Class discussions focus on communications con
cepts and always end with relaxation exercises.
The article also quoted a woman who was "doing a
week's homework in the five minutes before
class."
Friedrich said the course, which is a five-week
class taught by various instructors, is meant to
"help stutfjylts feel more comfortable with com
munication.
"I don't think it's humorous to slander individ
uals and hold them up to ridicule," Friedrich said.
"If I had the time and money I'd sue them
(Newsweek) too."
Don Johnson, who teaches "Arts and Sciences
221: Human Sexuality" at the University of
Colorado, said the article "certainly wasn't
received as humorous here."
Johnson said he resigned from teaching the
course after the article prompted the university to
begin grading the course on a bell curve. Johnson
said when he taught the course "about three
quarters of the class received A's, B's or C's.
"I just refused to grade the course on a curve,"
Johnson said. "It was not an extremely difficult
course, but it was certainly academically valid."
His resignation caused "an uproar"
among students there, Johnson said.
He said he is one of the most popular
teachers on campus and was
nominated teacher of the year last
year.
Howard Nelson, who teaches
"Geography 156: Metropolitan Los
Angeles" at UCLA, said he "didn't
take it as a humorous article."
Efforts to contact the six other pro
fessors proved unsuccessful.
