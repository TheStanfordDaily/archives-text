## 
### TOM CLIFFORD 
When everything was said and done,
the Stanford men's tennis team fell just a
few points short of turning a good season
into a great one.
At the NCAA championship tourna
ment in Athens. Ga., last week, the team
played in four extremely close matches,
only to have the UCLA Bruins win in the
final match and prevent the Card from
keeping its championship crown. Stan
ford finished the year in second place
collegiately with a 22-6 record.
"I wouldn't say we were awesome, but
we were pretty good." Head Coach Dick
Gould said of the second-place finish.
"In the team tournament, we had four
really tough days of tennis, and we had
our chances. 1 think we played very, very
tough, but we could have won.
"One good thing is that on one day our
No. 1, 3 and 5 singles players would

win, and on the next day the other three
guys in our line-up would come back and
win for us." Gould continued.
Gould noted that his players exhibited
a true team effort at the tournament.
"No one person was always down or
messing up. Everyone contributed. It's
really tough emotionally after four days
of playing 3-3 in the singles, and 1 think
the guys did a really outstanding job."
Although none of the Stanford players
came home with an individual champion
ship title, several players did receive
recognition for their efforts. Dan Goldie,
who played at the No. 1 spot for the Car
dinal, finished the season with an impres
sive 17-7 singles record and received
Ail-American honors. Goldie also
qualified for the 21-and-under Junior
Davis Cup team.
Eric Rosenfeld ended his season with a

16-10 record while playing at the No. 2
spot for the Cardinal. Rosenfeld will play
in the Gailen team tournament in
Europe this summer, where he will be
joined by other collegiate stars such as
Kelly Jones from Pepperdine, Lawson
Duncan from Clemson and Ricky Leach
from IJSC.
Jim Grabb, Mark McKeen and Der
rick Rostagno will be traveling to Flush
ing Meadows, N.Y. in hopes of qualify
ing for the Olympic trials.
The doubles teams, which were a big
concern for the Cardinal during much of
the season, came on very strong at the
end. carry ing the team to the team finals.
"Our No. 3 doubles team (of McKeen
and Rostagno) was really good this
year," Gould said. "And our No. 1 team
(of Grabb and John Letts) really
surprised some people."
