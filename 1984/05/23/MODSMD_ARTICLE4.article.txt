### CLINT HIGHFILL Daily staff 
An address hy a representative of
the United Stanford Workers (USW)
and an armed attack by several
masked students highlighted the last
meeting of the 14th ASSU Senate last
night.
The senate also ratified the budgets
submitted by groups receiving contin
gency funding and confirmed appoint
ments to University and Board of
Trustee committees at the meeting,
held in the Graduate School ol Busi
ness.
David Stevens, a representative ol
USW. spoke to senators during the
open forum portion of the agenda.
Stevens sought support for a rally
the union will hold Thursday and in
formed the senators of the union s

stance in its dispute with the Univer
sity. He accused the University of
"union busting."
After the meeting, two senators dis
closed plans to introduce a resolution
supporting the union at next week's
meeting of the new senate.
In other business, the senate's
Nominations Commission reported its
recommendations on appointments to
trustee and University committees.
The senate approved all the ap
pointments except for those to the
Committee of Fifteen.
The Committee of Fifteen received
only three applications for six student
positions. The Nominations Commis
sion took the liberty of recommending
three other students — who had been
unsuccessful in obtaining positions on
other committees — to fill the

vacancies.
Senator David Porter, however,
pointed out that the ASSU wants
"people who are motivated and who
have looked into the committee and
know what the committee does.'' The
senate concurred and voted to reject
the commission's three extraneous
appointments and solicit student ap
plications for the spots next tall.
The senate also accepted the
detailed budgets submitted by groups
receiving contingency funding next
year — a move required by the sen
ate's contingency funding procedures.
In April, the senate passed a motion
to provide funding for the ASSU
Lobby Office, the Great Directors
Film Series, the Stanford Progressive
