# Funding problems block laminated ID
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
The ASSU Student Affairs Com
mittee is currently conducting a com
prehensive survey on students desires
for magnetic photo identification
cards.
The committee ultimately hopes to
have "a card that is machine-readable
by computers all across campus in
places such as the Bookstore and the
library." according to Mark Heis
chauer. the committee's chair. Ihe
system is expected to cost several mil
lion dollars.
However. University President
Donald Kennedy has said that the
machine-readable cards are not even
a possibility until winter quarter ot the
1985-86 school year, according to
Fleischauer.
The system has been held up by the
lack of appropriate computer technol
ogy and the lack of money needed to
expand the data base, 112 leischauer
said.

The committee is hoping that the
University will adopt laminated photo
identification cards in the interim per
iod before the magnetic system can be
installed.

In fact. Fleischauer said that the
photo ID cards might even be
available as early as this tall.
"Kennedy has told me that he is
anxious to see the (committee's)

report," Fleischauer said, "and that it
seems likely that the University might
act on it if there is enough student in
terest."
Fleischauer said the idea for a photo
ID card has been discussed in the
ASSU Senate since 197 N.
"People have talked about it a lot."
Fleischauer said, "but no one has ever
gotten around to doing something
about it."
Thus tar. the committee members
have received nearly 3000 completed
surveys, and 60 to 75 percent of the
respondents have expressed a desire
for change, according to Fleischauer.
Fleischauer said the committee will
stop circulating the surveys at the end
of this week. The committee hopes to
issue a formal report by the beginning
of June.
The senator said he is optimistic
about the questionnaire's results.
"No one is violently against (the
cards)." he said. "The cost is the only
seemine concern."
