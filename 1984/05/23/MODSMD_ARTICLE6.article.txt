# Palo Alto to announce cable decision soon
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
The University will he one step
closer to cable television service
when a report issued by cable con
sultants is released to the Palo Alto
City Council next week.
The report will evaluate four
companies now bidding to provide
cable service to Stanford, Palo
Alto. Menlo Park, Atherton and
East Palo Alto. Palo Alto was se
lected to choose which company
should provide services for all the
communities.
After the report is issued, a num
ber of public hearings are sched
uled to allow members of the com
munity to voice their views to city
council members, according to Lisa
Van Dusen, project manager for
Cable Communications Coop
erative, one of the bidding com
panies.
Sources at city council
headquarters said there was no way
of telling when a decision by the
council might be expected.
Once the decision on a cable
company is reached, the University
has a number of interests in its
available services, according to
Mary Lou Allen, director of the
University's Instructional Televi
sion Network.
Allen said one objective will be
to provide University residences
with cable television services.
Allen said the minimum in
residence serv ice would be "a com

mon room with service to a televi
sion there." but that details on in
dividual service to students had not
yet been considered.
"None of those details have been
worked out yet," Allen said. " We'll
probably refrain from discussing
them until we reach the contract
stage with the company that will
provide the service."
The University would also like to
provide programming "both on an
intellectual and cultural level," Al
len said.
Allen expressed hope that the
cable company would provide a re
search base for the Stanford com
munity.
"Innovation in telecommunica
tion technology is definitely possi
ble, and so there should be oppor
tunity for research," she said.
The four companies bidding for
service to Stanford and other local
areas are Cable Communications
Cooperative. City Cable Partners.
Marsh Media Cable TV and Pacific
Bell.
According to an article in The
San Jose Mercury News. Pacific
Bell has presented a 517.5 million
proposal consisting ol a 100-
channel network.
The same article said that Cable
Communications Cooperative's
proposed $22 million system con
sists of 70 channels, while Marsh
Media Cable TV has proposed a
SlO million network of 58 chan
nels.
