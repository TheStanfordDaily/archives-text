Chernenko takes tough stand
Moscow — Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko said
yesterday the Soviet Union is prepared for "the buildup in
military confrontation" with the West. He told West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher that Moscow "will
steadily take adequate countermeasures" against future
deployment of U .S. nuclear weapons in Western Europe.
1 lie Soviet leader described Genscher's plea for resump
tion of Sov ict-American arms talks as something that "cannot
be regarded as serious" as long as U.S. Pershing 2 and cruise
missiles are deployed in Western Europe.
After his talks with Chernenko and Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko, Genscher was asked by reporters whether
he saw any possibility that Moscow could move away from
that position during this year.
"I have seen no indication of that." Genscher replied.
A senior West German diplomat said later that Moscow's
tough stance indicated a renewed military and political pres
sure on Western European nations on the question of
missiles.
Genscher's two-day official visit here was said to have been
the least productive of the six meetings he has had with
Gromyko and other Soviet officials during the past 12
months.
Britain expels Soviet spy
Moscow —Britain announced yesterday it had expelled a
Soviet diplomat who reportedly was the top KGB official in
London, and the Soviet Union, in apparent retaliation, or
dered the British Embassy's chief of security here to leave the
country.
Neither side gave reasons for the expulsions, but they ap
peared to be related to the murky espionage war between
East and West and the mysterious death here last June of a
British banker, Dennis Skinner.
The British Foreign Office said yesterday that Arkady
Guk, a first secretary at the Soviet Embassy in London, was
ordered out of the country last week. Press accounts in Lon
don had described Guk as the station chief of the KGB, the
Soviet secret service, and he had been named as a contact in
the recent trial of Michael Bettaney. a British security sen ice
officer convicted of trying to pass classified information to So
viet diplomats in Britain.
Soviet authorities yesterday ordered John Burnett, a first
secretary of the British Embassy and its top security official,
to leave the country by Sunday. An embassy spokesman said
Burnett's expulsion was in apparent retaliation for that ot
Guk and the British Foreign Office called it "totally unjus
tified."
Consumer prices rise again
Washington —Consumer prices, spurred by higher home
utility and heating bills, rose 0.5 percent in April to more than
double the rate of the previous month, the government re
ported yesterday.
The White House said the report showed "inflation under
control," but some private economists saw worrisome signs
that pressures of demand are beginning to push prices higher.
The April increase compared with a modest 0.2 percent
rise in March and a 0.4 percent increase in February. The
Labor Department said food prices held steady during April
but that housing costs rose 0.6 percent, largely because of
higher prices for residential telephone and electrical service
and tor heating.

Administration opposes
civil rights legislation
Washington — The Reagan administration announced yester
day that it opposes the major civil rights legislation intro
duced this congressional session, legislation that would
broaden federal power to penalize institutions that dis
criminate on the basis of race, sex, age or handicap.
Despite administration objections, the legislation was ap
proved unanimously yesterday by a House Judiciary subcom
mittee and is expected to be approved overwhelmingly today
by the full House Judiciary Committee and the Education and
Labor Committee. It has 63 co-sponsors in the Senate.
The legislation would counteract a Feb. 28 Supreme Court
ruling involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania. In that
ruling, the court held that Title IX. the law forbidding federal
aid to institutions that practice sex discrimination, should be
applied only to the specific program receiv ing federal aid. not
to the entire institution.
The bill, known as the Civil Rights Act of 1984, would al- |
low the cutting off of federal financial assistance to an entire
institution for discrimination on the basis of sex, race, age or
handicap in any of its programs.
William Bradford Reynolds, the assistant attorney general
for civil rights, told two House panels yesterday that the bill
would provoke "an unnecessary tension" between the "two
important principles of equal opportunity and limited federal
involvement in state and local affairs."
San Jose loses $60 million
San Jose — " Irregularities" in San Jose's investments
cost the city $60 million and three officials have been placed
on leave pending an audit. Mayor Tom McEnery said yester
day.
"This is a very, very serious problem for the city of San
Jose," said McEnery .
In a written statement, the city said officials had
"uncovered certain irregularities in the way that interest
income was being reported. Upon 112 urther examination, unus
ual trading patterns were noted in the city's general
portfolio."
No redevelopment or retirement funds were involved,
McEnery said, but he added that many road, park and other
projects will be delayed at least a year because of the losses.
Gypsies busted in fruit ritual
Dallas — I wo gypsies were arrested yesterday after police
said they promised to remove a woman's "ancient family
curse" by rubbing a grapefruit over her body and taking
$2000 from her to be torn up and buried in a graveyard at
midnight.
Police said the bizarre ritual was to end with the victim
believing the demon had been cast out and the gypsies taping
the torn money back together and keeping it.
The scheme ended yesterday with the arrest of two young
women for investigation of felony theft. Police said the arrests
were the first cases made in Dallas on a con game commonly
known among gypsies as "bujo." meaning "big swindle."

New York — Stocks suffered their fourth straight pummel
ing in active trading yesterday but not before halving their
worst losses of the session.
Oil. steel, telephone, mining, drug and financial stocks
paced the retreat, and 183 issues tumbled to new 52-week
lows on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rebounded from a
15-point deficit at niidsession but still finished with a 8.69-

1 113.49 on April 6. 1983.

Chernenko takes tough stand
Moscow — Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko said
yesterday the Soviet Union is prepared for "the buildup in
military confrontation" with the West. He told West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher that Moscow "will
steadily take adequate countermeasures" against future
deployment of U .S. nuclear weapons in Western Europe.
1 lie Soviet leader described Genscher's plea for resump
tion of Sov ict-American arms talks as something that "cannot
be regarded as serious" as long as U.S. Pershing 2 and cruise
missiles are deployed in Western Europe.
After his talks with Chernenko and Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko, Genscher was asked by reporters whether
he saw any possibility that Moscow could move away from
that position during this year.
"I have seen no indication of that." Genscher replied.
A senior West German diplomat said later that Moscow's
tough stance indicated a renewed military and political pres
sure on Western European nations on the question of
missiles.
Genscher's two-day official visit here was said to have been
the least productive of the six meetings he has had with
Gromyko and other Soviet officials during the past 12
months.
Britain expels Soviet spy
Moscow —Britain announced yesterday it had expelled a
Soviet diplomat who reportedly was the top KGB official in
London, and the Soviet Union, in apparent retaliation, or
dered the British Embassy's chief of security here to leave the
country.
Neither side gave reasons for the expulsions, but they ap
peared to be related to the murky espionage war between
East and West and the mysterious death here last June of a
British banker, Dennis Skinner.
The British Foreign Office said yesterday that Arkady
Guk, a first secretary at the Soviet Embassy in London, was
ordered out of the country last week. Press accounts in Lon
don had described Guk as the station chief of the KGB, the
Soviet secret service, and he had been named as a contact in
the recent trial of Michael Bettaney. a British security sen ice
officer convicted of trying to pass classified information to So
viet diplomats in Britain.
Soviet authorities yesterday ordered John Burnett, a first
secretary of the British Embassy and its top security official,
to leave the country by Sunday. An embassy spokesman said
Burnett's expulsion was in apparent retaliation for that ot
Guk and the British Foreign Office called it "totally unjus
tified."
Consumer prices rise again
Washington —Consumer prices, spurred by higher home
utility and heating bills, rose 0.5 percent in April to more than
double the rate of the previous month, the government re
ported yesterday.
The White House said the report showed "inflation under
control," but some private economists saw worrisome signs
that pressures of demand are beginning to push prices higher.
The April increase compared with a modest 0.2 percent
rise in March and a 0.4 percent increase in February. The
Labor Department said food prices held steady during April
but that housing costs rose 0.6 percent, largely because of
higher prices for residential telephone and electrical service
and tor heating.

Administration opposes
civil rights legislation
Washington — The Reagan administration announced yester
day that it opposes the major civil rights legislation intro
duced this congressional session, legislation that would
broaden federal power to penalize institutions that dis
criminate on the basis of race, sex, age or handicap.
Despite administration objections, the legislation was ap
proved unanimously yesterday by a House Judiciary subcom
mittee and is expected to be approved overwhelmingly today
by the full House Judiciary Committee and the Education and
Labor Committee. It has 63 co-sponsors in the Senate.
The legislation would counteract a Feb. 28 Supreme Court
ruling involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania. In that
ruling, the court held that Title IX. the law forbidding federal
aid to institutions that practice sex discrimination, should be
applied only to the specific program receiv ing federal aid. not
to the entire institution.
The bill, known as the Civil Rights Act of 1984, would al- |
low the cutting off of federal financial assistance to an entire
institution for discrimination on the basis of sex, race, age or
handicap in any of its programs.
William Bradford Reynolds, the assistant attorney general
for civil rights, told two House panels yesterday that the bill
would provoke "an unnecessary tension" between the "two
important principles of equal opportunity and limited federal
involvement in state and local affairs."
San Jose loses $60 million
San Jose — " Irregularities" in San Jose's investments
cost the city $60 million and three officials have been placed
on leave pending an audit. Mayor Tom McEnery said yester
day.
"This is a very, very serious problem for the city of San
Jose," said McEnery .
In a written statement, the city said officials had
"uncovered certain irregularities in the way that interest
income was being reported. Upon 112 urther examination, unus
ual trading patterns were noted in the city's general
portfolio."
No redevelopment or retirement funds were involved,
McEnery said, but he added that many road, park and other
projects will be delayed at least a year because of the losses.
Gypsies busted in fruit ritual
Dallas — I wo gypsies were arrested yesterday after police
said they promised to remove a woman's "ancient family
curse" by rubbing a grapefruit over her body and taking
$2000 from her to be torn up and buried in a graveyard at
midnight.
Police said the bizarre ritual was to end with the victim
believing the demon had been cast out and the gypsies taping
the torn money back together and keeping it.
The scheme ended yesterday with the arrest of two young
women for investigation of felony theft. Police said the arrests
were the first cases made in Dallas on a con game commonly
known among gypsies as "bujo." meaning "big swindle."
