can't foresee that happening.
"We have not volunteered to intervene and we hau
not been asked," Reagan said. "'So far it seems the gul
states want to take care of that themselves."

would not simply stand bv and see the Gull ot Hornuw
closed as a result of the war between Iran and Iraq

allow that channel to be closed."

Congress to appropriate more economic and militurv
aid to U.S. allies in the region.

concession, to show we'd be offering some reward for
their intransigence." he said.

because Soviet-American progress is being made
quietly in other areas.
