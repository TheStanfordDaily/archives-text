# House accuses Casey

### 
Washington (AP) â€” House investigators have con
cluded that CIA Director William Casey arranged
to get Carter administration documents for Presi
dent Reagan's 1980 campaign, sources familiar
with the House probe said last night.
The sources said that besides naming Casey,
who was Reagan's campaign manager, a 2400-
page report scheduled to be released today states
that the House investigation was unable to iden
tify who in the Carter camp supplied the docu
ments.
The report further says that the year-old probe
by the Post Office and Civil Service human re
sources subcommittee found credible evidence
that a crime had been committed in the transfer of
the Carter papers, sources said.
A Justice Department probe concluded in
February there was no credible evidence of a
federal crime, but Rep. Donald Albosta, (D-
Mich.) head of the subcomittee conducting the
probe, said yesterday night that "our report will
refer to several areas where we feel a crime was
committed." He refused to elaborate.
Last year. White House Chief of Staff James
Baker, another former campaign official, told
House probers that Casey gave him Carter docu
ments, including a briefing book used to prepare
President Carter lor a pivotal campaign debate.

Casey repeatedly has said he cannot recall
seeing any Carter papers during the campaign.
But sources said the subcommittee's report
cites "independent testimony" supporting Baker's
statement.
Meanwhile, two law professors said yesterday
they will try new maneuvers to compel the ap
pointment of a special prosecutor to investigate
how the Reagan campaign got the Carter White
House briefing papers.
John Banzhaf and Peter Meyers outlined their
strategy at a news conference.
In a related development. Albosta released a
letter in which the subcommittee urged Attorney
General William French Smith to appoint a spe
cial prosecutor to investigate "possible crimes
committed" in connection with the Carter papers.
The Democratic-controlled panel said the
counsel, permitted under the 1978 Ethics in Gov
ernment Act, should "pay particular attention to
the questionable and flatly contradictory state
ments made to the subcommittee during the
course of its investigation."
The letter, signed by Albosta, said the recom
mendation was "made completely independent"
of the May 14 order of U.S. District Judge Harold
Greene directing Smith to seek appointment of an
independent counsel.
