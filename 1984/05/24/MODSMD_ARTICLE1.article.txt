# Theme house backers say freshmen necessary
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
In an open forum last night, proponents of University
theme houses stressed the importance of keeping
freshmen in those residences.
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
hosted the Terman Auditorium meeting to gauge student
opinion on its recently released report concerning theme
houses. The month-old report suggests that theme houses
may not provide academic and social opportunities for
freshmen that are up to par with those in other residences,
thus depriving those students of the "freshman experi
ence."
The focal point that emerged from the student commen
taries, however, was, in the words of senior Arturo Vargas,
that "Stanford theme houses are essential for freshmen."
The crowd, composed mainly of about 50 current and
former theme house residents and resident assistants,
seemed to agree that theme houses provide an important
support system for minorities during the freshman year.
Duiing the course of the discussion, no one spoke out
against theme houses in general or against the presence of
freshmen in the houses.
"1 question the value of the homogeneous freshman ex
perience," sophomore Donna Anderson said. She praised
the opportunity for freshmen to spend their first year in a

concentration of people from similar cultural hack
grounds.
According the the C-US report, "Serious academic dis
advantages could arise if freshmen were placed in tour
class houses not large enough to have a critical mass of
freshmen for satisfactory advising or house-hased fresh
man courses."
In response to a challenge from the crowd. English Prot.
Ronald Rebholz, a member of the panel, attempted to
clearly define the freshman experience obtained trom a
critical mass of freshmen.
According to Rebholz, shared experiences contribute to
the freshman experience. These include formal academics
such as the Western Culture Program; shared advising
programs, including advising associates; and intangible ex
periences such as discovering the backgrounds of fellow
residents.
The real issue that divides the C-US, Rebholz said, is
whether the theme houses can facilitate these experiences
as well as other houses with larger numbers of freshmen
can.

tem amounts to enticing advisers with
fancy wine-and-cheese sessions, con

should not be forsaken for infrequent

According to some, however, the
vitality that freshmen lend to theme
houses is just as important as the sup
port that theme houses give to first
year students.
Leslie Talbot, a former resident of
I jaama. said people have increasingly
less time for social and extracurricular
activity as they progress academically.
"The life of a theme house would not
be there if there were not freshmen."
she said.
Students at the session also stressed
that theme houses provide invaluable
educational experiences.
Freshman George Cuevas told the
committee that his residence in Casa
/apata this year has given him "a lot
more insight into my own culture."
Cuevas said that learning how to make
tortillas and guacamole, attending the
house lecture series and interacting
with both Hispanics and non-
Hispanies, while perhaps sounding
trivial to outsiders, have enhanced his
sense of background.
Cuevas also commented that Casa
/apata forms an integrated group of
freshmen and upperclassmen. He said
that to exclude theme houses to fresh
men may communicate to prospective
students that "Stanford University is
not supporting the minority commu
nity."
