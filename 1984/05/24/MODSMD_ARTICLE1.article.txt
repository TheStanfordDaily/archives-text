# Theme house backers say freshmen necessary

### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
In an open forum last night, proponents of University
theme houses stressed the importance of keeping
freshmen in those residences.
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
hosted the Terman Auditorium meeting to gauge student
opinion on its recently released report concerning theme
houses. The month-old report suggests that theme houses
may not provide academic and social opportunities for
freshmen that are up to par with those in other residences,
thus depriving those students of the "freshman experi

The focal point that emerged from the student commen

that "Stanford theme houses are essential for freshmen."
The crowd, composed mainly of about 50 current and
former theme house residents and resident assistants,

freshmen in the houses.

the opportunity for freshmen to spend their first year in a

concentration of people from similar cultural hack
grounds.
According the the C-US report, "Serious academic dis
advantages could arise if freshmen were placed in tour
class houses not large enough to have a critical mass of
freshmen for satisfactory advising or house-hased fresh
man courses."

Ronald Rebholz, a member of the panel, attempted to
clearly define the freshman experience obtained trom a
critical mass of freshmen.
According to Rebholz, shared experiences contribute to
the freshman experience. These include formal academics
such as the Western Culture Program; shared advising
programs, including advising associates; and intangible ex
periences such as discovering the backgrounds of fellow
residents.
The real issue that divides the C-US, Rebholz said, is
whether the theme houses can facilitate these experiences
as well as other houses with larger numbers of freshmen
can.
