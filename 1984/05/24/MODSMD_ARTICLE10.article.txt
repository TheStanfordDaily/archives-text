# Ear damage common among college students

This is the second in a series of three articles
dealing with the hazards of noise exposure to
the hearing of college students.

College students have the best hearing they
are going to have in their lifetime. Many,
however, have already sustained some damage
to the ear from noise exposure. All are now
susceptible to the dangers of hearing impair
ments that will be with them for the rest of
their lives, according to William Clark, a re
search psychologist at The Central Institute for
the Deaf, an institution affiliated with Wash
ington University in St. Louis.
Of the 16,000 non-regenerating sensory
cells in the ear that humans are born with, ap
proximately 95 percent of these have remained
undamaged for the average person when he
enters college at age 17 or 18, Clark said.
While excessive noise exposure accelerates this
loss, students may not realize they are damag
ing their ears.
"Cell loss precedes hearing loss and the po
tential for causing permanent damage to the
ear from noise exposure may not cause any im
mediate measurable hearing loss," Clark said,
adding that a perceptible loss is likely to show
up in later life.
He said that hearing loss is usually
"insidious, increasing very gradually without
ringing in the ears and without pain, following
prolonged and repeated exposure to noise that
may, like music, even be pleasant."
Clark said that the ringing one often hears
after a concert is called "tinnitus," a symptom
of too much noise exposure. What results is a
temporary hearing loss, usually regained
within 24 hours, and the probability of some
permanent damage to the ear that will not ap
pear until later in life as a hearing loss.
Clark briefly summarized the structure of
the ear and the parts that are likely to be
damaged. The cells susceptible to damage are
in the snail shell-shaped inner ear. known as
the cochlea. A basilar membrane, floating in

lymphatic fluid, supports the sensitive organ of
the corti with its rows of flexible hair cells.
These microscopic cells are stimulated when
the membane vibrates in response to sound.
Sounds of different frequencies produce differ
ent patterns of vibration so that other hair cells
are stimulated in response to higher or lower
frequencies. Auditory neurons connect to
these various sensory cells and report their
response higher up in the central nervous sys
tem. When the cells and their nerve connec
tions are stimulated too hard or for too long a
time, they can lose their sensitivity perma
nently.
According to Clark, damage to the inner ear
depends on "the frequency, the intensity
(loudness) and the duration of exposure." The
first damage from continued exposure to noise
of moderate intensity is confined to the basilar
membrane which is sensitive to the higher fre
quencies such as those needed to hear hi-fi
music and understand speech. With continued
exposure to loud noise, such as jet plane
engines, the damage spreads "both to higher
and lower frequency areas of the cochlea so
that all sounds are harder to hear."
Although he said that there is "considerable
variation" in individual susceptibility to noise
damage, depending upon the noise level of the
area in which one works and lives, Clark added
that "no one is immune to damage from long
term exposure to loud sound, whether the
noise is in the form of unwanted noise or
music."
A common misconception, according to
Clark, is that people believe that their ears
"get tougher" with prolonged exposure.
Damage to the ear still occurs after one no
longer feels a change in his hearing from expo
sure to loud noise. Clark added that
"susceptibility to continued exposure persists
even after some hearing loss is evident."
(Tomorrow's article will focus on the noise
levels of places and devices that Stanford stu
dents frequently encounter and methods of
protection against excessive noise exposure.)
