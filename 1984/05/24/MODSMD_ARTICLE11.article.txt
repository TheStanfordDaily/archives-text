## The 						Stanford Daily Keep the right to choose 
### 
Speaking on campus last week, pro-choice ac
tivist Hill Baird brought the subject of abortion to
the eye of the Stanford community, renewing in
terest at Stanford on an issue that affects many
women in this country.
I he philosophical question whether a fetus is a
human being, or .it what stage a fetus becomes
one. has long been debated. This is a question for
which there app. ars to be no definitive answer,
liaeh person has his or her own opinion that is not
likely to be swayed by medical findings pointing
in either direction.
We, however, must agree with the Supreme
C ourt's 1973 ruling that life begins at childbirth.
In this light, we support the right of each woman
in this country to choose for herself whether or
not an abortion is appropriate for her situation. A
woman should have the right to abort a fetus
until the time at which it is no longer safe for her
to do so. a time now presently defined by the
court as the start of the third trimester.
Abortions took place in the United States long
before the Supreme Court made its landmark
decision. These "back alley" abortions entailed
methods — such as the often heard ol coat hanger

abortion — that wore extemely unsafe for the wo
man and frequently resulted in her death.
The wealthy, however, did not have to worry
about such problems. They could fly to Mexico to
have an operation performed in a medically safe
environment and come back to this country as if
nothing had taken place.
Women will continue to seek and get abortions
even if the court's ruling is someday overturned.
If this should happen, they will be forced once
again to resort to "back alley" methods, risking
their own lives in the process. Women and
young girls who are the victims of incest and rape
would be forced into the unenviable position of
deciding between whether they should keep an
unwanted baby or risk a closet abortion.
Even if the mother chooses to forego aborting
the fetus, it is quite possible that the child will
grow up in a household with a mother who cares
little for her unwanted son or daughter.
This situation is both undesirable and unneces
sary. We believe that each woman under the Con
stitution should be provided with the freedom of
choice to receive an abortion.
