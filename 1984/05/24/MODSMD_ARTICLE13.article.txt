## Chamorro speech distorted Nicaraguan question 
### 
I am amazed that no one has yet replied to
Robert I arkins* ;:hti-communist diatribe
against Nicaragua (Daily, May N). There
otherwise seems to be a high level of con
sciousness here on the struggle in Latin
viiicrica. Perhaps others found the article too
biased to be worth notice, but it was the most

VIEWPOINT

rabid ol those rehashing the distorted views of
Pedro Chamorro. editor ot La Prensa, and this
needs to be answered.
I a Prensa is not the only newspaper in
Nicaragua and Chamorro is not a leader of the
revolution there. The dictatorship of Somoza
had been so ruthless before his overthrow that
mam Nicaraguan capitalists and landowners
iinall\ supported his ouster and even did so
openly through the newspaper that continues
to act as the voice for these social classes: La
Prensa. But the revolution has split this class
and removed it from political power.
Seme nave become openly 'counter
revolutionary, like the notorious traitor Eden
Pastora. who heads the army of terrorists sup
ported by the CIA.
Others, like Chamorro. criticize from the

sidelines and even try to tlirt with imperialism
in the "ideological battle." But at least inside
Nicaragua, they are losing that battle. Phis is
what bothers Chamorro: the lost influence of
his newspaper, not any imagined
"totalitarian" threat against its existence. La
Prensa was hit first by a defection from its own
ranks. The co-owner and a majority of the
staff left, disgusted with Chamorro's editorial
policy, to found HI Diario Nuevo. Bui now an
upstart paper has gained more readers than
the other two combined: the official paper of
the Sandinistas, Barricada.
Far from acting in a totalitarian manner, the
Sandinistas are concerned that La Prensa be
allowed to continue expressing its unfounded
criticism of the revolution. They are even glad
that the right-wing social sectors that
Chamorro represents continue to expose
themselves within their country's political
debate. Notice that Chamorro returned to
Nicaragua without fear that he would be killed
as his father was under the truly dictatorial
Somoza regime. He knows that the Sandinis
tas intend to allow freedom for those who do
not actively take up arms or brazenly support
the counter-revolution. Former members of
Pastora's traitorous bands are even granted
amnestv under these conditions.

The disservice of Chamorro's speech here
( April 25) is that it was designed to whip up
anti-communist sentiment at a time when the
main problem is reversing our government's
course toward another Vietnam. This is not
simply a question of freedom of the press. The
Sandinista government is in fact doing a better
job of upholding it in the face of the counter
revolutionary movement than has been the
case in most other social revolutions under at
tack. The principle of freedom of the press in
fact demands that we hear the other side of
the story.
This is precisely what i.arkins' compatriot
m the White House is denying us. Representa
tives (it the Nicaraguan government were once
able to come to this country and speak in their
own defense. This has not been the case since
Tomas Borge. Nicaragua's minister of the in
terior. had his visa revoked just before a
planned speaking tour hist November.
Did anyone hear or read Borge's speech?
It addressed the pcoWem of human rights
arid exposed the media image of the
"dictatorial" Sandinistas as a lie intended to
gain support for an escalation of the un
declared war in Central America. But this
speech only appeared in the small left-wing

press in this country. The big business press
dominates and distorts our thinking no matter
how much freedom we may enjoy (or imagine
we enjoy) in comparison to other countries.
But why the censorship''
Nicaragua has been at war with U.S.-
financed counter-revolutionaries since the
overthrow of Somo/.a. Any country lighting
for its freedom suspects carping critics of
being treacherous and insincere. Even the
United States has curtailed individual
freedoms in wartime.
Don't misunderstand me: Similar actions bv
the U.S. government are dead wrong. Censor
ship is more open to abuse than editorial con
trol. Any real complaints Chamorro has
should be brought to court. But I suspect lie
only has anecdotes, suitable for speeches in
foreign countries that would, at worst, be
judged as minor errors of the censor before
the jury of his own people.
This is what Sergio de Castro, international
editor of Barricada. has to s;iy about the cen
sorship: "As revolutionary journalists we
would prefer that there not be these restric
tions regarding information because this
would permit, in many cases, much broader
discussion of many problems through the mass

media. But you have to understand that
Nicaragua is a very vulnerable country. We
have tew riches, our economy is weak, and it is
very easy through the means of communica
tion to provoke situations that will worsen the
economic problems we have." De Castro and
Borge are some ot the real revolutionaries in
Nicaragua. I.et the Department ol Communi
cation invite one ot them to speak here and
get past "our" own government before pon
tificating on freedom of the press.
For better or worse, an escalation of the war
might well make Chaniorro's position as an
abettor of imperialism in the revolutionary
country untenable. I hope the Sandinistas will
be able to support as much freedom as possi
ble under even worse conditions. But
Nicaragua will fight to protect its freedom no
matter what illusions exist on that score in the
American media. I.et Chamorro and the anti
communists ponder these facts while they still
have time. Some of us learned from Vietnam.
We are against this war and for real freedom
of the press in both countries. That can ha a
more complex issue than the superlicial
promoters of such freedom would have us
believe.

The disservice of Chamorro's speech here
( April 25) is that it was designed to whip up
anti-communist sentiment at a time when the
main problem is reversing our government's
course toward another Vietnam. This is not
simply a question of freedom of the press. The
Sandinista government is in fact doing a better
job of upholding it in the face of the counter
revolutionary movement than has been the
case in most other social revolutions under at
tack. The principle of freedom of the press in
fact demands that we hear the other side of
the story.
This is precisely what i.arkins' compatriot
m the White House is denying us. Representa
tives (it the Nicaraguan government were once
able to come to this country and speak in their
own defense. This has not been the case since
Tomas Borge. Nicaragua's minister of the in
terior. had his visa revoked just before a
planned speaking tour hist November.
Did anyone hear or read Borge's speech?
It addressed the pcoWem of human rights
arid exposed the media image of the
"dictatorial" Sandinistas as a lie intended to
gain support for an escalation of the un
declared war in Central America. But this
speech only appeared in the small left-wing

press in this country. The big business press
dominates and distorts our thinking no matter
how much freedom we may enjoy (or imagine
we enjoy) in comparison to other countries.
But why the censorship''
Nicaragua has been at war with U.S.-
financed counter-revolutionaries since the
overthrow of Somo/.a. Any country lighting
for its freedom suspects carping critics of
being treacherous and insincere. Even the
United States has curtailed individual
freedoms in wartime.
Don't misunderstand me: Similar actions bv
the U.S. government are dead wrong. Censor
ship is more open to abuse than editorial con
trol. Any real complaints Chamorro has
should be brought to court. But I suspect lie
only has anecdotes, suitable for speeches in
foreign countries that would, at worst, be
judged as minor errors of the censor before
the jury of his own people.
This is what Sergio de Castro, international
editor of Barricada. has to s;iy about the cen
sorship: "As revolutionary journalists we
would prefer that there not be these restric
tions regarding information because this
would permit, in many cases, much broader
discussion of many problems through the mass

media. But you have to understand that
Nicaragua is a very vulnerable country. We
have tew riches, our economy is weak, and it is
very easy through the means of communica
tion to provoke situations that will worsen the
economic problems we have." De Castro and
Borge are some ot the real revolutionaries in
Nicaragua. I.et the Department ol Communi
cation invite one ot them to speak here and
get past "our" own government before pon
tificating on freedom of the press.
For better or worse, an escalation of the war
might well make Chaniorro's position as an
abettor of imperialism in the revolutionary
country untenable. I hope the Sandinistas will
be able to support as much freedom as possi
ble under even worse conditions. But
Nicaragua will fight to protect its freedom no
matter what illusions exist on that score in the
American media. I.et Chamorro and the anti
communists ponder these facts while they still
have time. Some of us learned from Vietnam.
We are against this war and for real freedom
of the press in both countries. That can ha a
more complex issue than the superlicial
promoters of such freedom would have us
believe.

I am amazed that no one has yet replied to
Robert I arkins* ;:hti-communist diatribe
against Nicaragua (Daily, May N). There
otherwise seems to be a high level of con
sciousness here on the struggle in Latin
viiicrica. Perhaps others found the article too
biased to be worth notice, but it was the most

VIEWPOINT

rabid ol those rehashing the distorted views of
Pedro Chamorro. editor ot La Prensa, and this
needs to be answered.
I a Prensa is not the only newspaper in
Nicaragua and Chamorro is not a leader of the
revolution there. The dictatorship of Somoza
had been so ruthless before his overthrow that
mam Nicaraguan capitalists and landowners
iinall\ supported his ouster and even did so
openly through the newspaper that continues
to act as the voice for these social classes: La
Prensa. But the revolution has split this class
and removed it from political power.
Seme nave become openly 'counter
revolutionary, like the notorious traitor Eden
Pastora. who heads the army of terrorists sup
ported by the CIA.
Others, like Chamorro. criticize from the

sidelines and even try to tlirt with imperialism
in the "ideological battle." But at least inside
Nicaragua, they are losing that battle. Phis is
what bothers Chamorro: the lost influence of
his newspaper, not any imagined
"totalitarian" threat against its existence. La
Prensa was hit first by a defection from its own
ranks. The co-owner and a majority of the
staff left, disgusted with Chamorro's editorial
policy, to found HI Diario Nuevo. Bui now an
upstart paper has gained more readers than
the other two combined: the official paper of
the Sandinistas, Barricada.
Far from acting in a totalitarian manner, the
Sandinistas are concerned that La Prensa be
allowed to continue expressing its unfounded
criticism of the revolution. They are even glad
that the right-wing social sectors that
Chamorro represents continue to expose
themselves within their country's political
debate. Notice that Chamorro returned to
Nicaragua without fear that he would be killed
as his father was under the truly dictatorial
Somoza regime. He knows that the Sandinis
tas intend to allow freedom for those who do
not actively take up arms or brazenly support
the counter-revolution. Former members of
Pastora's traitorous bands are even granted
amnestv under these conditions.

The disservice of Chamorro's speech here

anti-communist sentiment at a time when the
