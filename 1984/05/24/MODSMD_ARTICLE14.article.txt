## Abortion not reducible to murder 
### 
"Where and how does one draw the line be
tween an expendable fetus and a human life that is
protected under our Constitution?' asked Jason
Matheil\ in his May 17 column. It is a question I
must echo. It's a difficult issue, one with which
doctors and activists on both sides of the abortion

VIEWPOINT

issue have been grappling for a long time — and
there arc no clear answers in sight. But 1 must
plead with such harsh, judgmental critics as Math
erly to consider a few more issues.
Here's one we've all heard before: the question
of o\er-population. In a world as crowded as ours
is becoming, how can we sanction the continuance
of unwanted pregnancies? In an era such as this,
when we each must consider whether we want to
iiring children into the world at all. it seems absurd
to require unwanted children to be born.

Getting back to Matherly's column, however. I
find there is one area jn which I agree with him:
"consequence-free sexual intercourse" and"the
right to avoid inconvenience" ought to be dis
couraged. But Matherly fails to realize that not all
unwanted pregnancies are the result of reckless
ness. There is no 100 percent-foolproof method of
birth control. Therefore women, even women on
the pill, can become pregnant. But should a wo
man be forced to continue a pregnancy she never
wanted and tried to avoid?
How can I or Matherly or anyone for that matter
know the emotional, psychological and, yes. even
physical agony of any unwanted pregnancy? How
can we understand or pass judgment upon the kind
of despair that leads desperate women to attempt
self-abortions with coat hangers, soap or salt injec
tions and other ignominious devices?
This may seem like sensationalist scare tactics,
horror stories belonging to an earlier, more ig

norant era. Yet as last Wednesday's speech by Bill
Baird made very clear, such incidents still do oc
cur. And. as Baird also pointed out, abortions will
inevitably continue, regardless of laws that may be
passed auainst them — the question is merely
where and how. Given that the knowledge of abor
tion exists, and that abortions will be sought by
desperate women, isn't it somewhat more
humanitarian to allow women safe, legalized abor
tions? Isn't a pregnant woman's life also valuable?
So please, let's quit the cries of murder and the
analogies comparing pro-abortion crusaders with
I iitler. People in favor of abortion are also respect
ful of life and of the rights of human beings, partic
ularly the right of a woman or couple to make their
own decision about one of the most important
steps anyone can take — the decision to become a
parent.
