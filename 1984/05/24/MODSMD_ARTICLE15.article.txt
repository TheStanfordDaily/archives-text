## End political vandalism 
### 
I am puzzled as to why one of my
neighbors objects so strongly to Mar
tin Carnoy as the Democratic candi
date for Congress in the 12th District.
Three times in the last week the
modest sign supporting his campaign
that I placed on my property has been
torn down in the dark of night, the
last time totally destroyed.
It is true Carnoy's degrees in elec
trical engineering from Cal Tech and
economics from Chicago, his experi
ence in Latin American affairs and as
an education professor at Stanford
and his work with the Brookings
Institution in Washington make him
strongly qualified to represent this
district. His positions supporting a
bilateral, verifiable nuclear weapons

freeze, his opposition to covert aid lo
the contrus in Nicaragua and to the
Reagan administration's attempts to
roll back progress in environmental
protection, women's and minority's
rights and personal privacy make him
an attractive alternative to Republi
can Ed /sehau. who many of us feel
has deviated from expressed positions
by voting to support the Reagan
administration.
I think it unfortunate that someone
is not willing to tolerate an opposing
point of view and let political issues
be settled at the polls rather than by
the destruction of posters.
