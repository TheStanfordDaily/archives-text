# Stanford not yet paradise-on-earth

Despite frequent assertions of its superiority to
I Jarvard, I've come to realize, at the end of my first
year here, that Stanford University is not yet a
paradisc-on-earth. From the lavatories to the labo
ratories. the pipes are clogged with problems. Let's
discuss a few of them.
• Lake Lagunita. As an undergrad, I was in San
Diego, where they take their beaches seriously.
Hut we don't have to be content with a slimy pond
and a beach littered with shards of broken glass.
Bring in a few tons of fine white sand for the look
and feel of a,real beach, then install a wave ma
chine for a final touch of realism. After all the bro
ken glass has been covered over, anyone caught
leaving bottles on the beach will be forced to drink
a sixpack of warm generic beer while standing
barefoot on a bed of hot nails. Also, some
restrooms at the boathouse would be a pleasant
and useful addition.
• Meyer Library. Remember all the fuss several
months back about Meyer Library? Hordes of in
considerate students ostensibly made ihe place un
fit for serious studying. The hours were
insufficient, especially on weekends. Even the
furniture was said to be unsuitable tor academic
pursuits. Having suffered through libraries where
the background noise never dipped below the dull
roar level. I had to check this one out. though I
wondered whether, as a grad student, it wasn't
beneath my dignity to enter. To ni) surprise, I
found it quite a pleasant place to study, open and
relaxed. No dense pack of utterly silent
humanoids. no thick and oppressive atmosphere of
competition present in so mam eami is libraries
In fact, we should enhar < N1 • 'HH'kV. ;:tm

bience, not destroy it. Start by installing a jacuzzi
in the ground floor lobby. This is a sorely lacking
campus amenity in any case, and it will provide
welcome relief from the shoulder strain incurred
while hunched over books .it exam time. Maybe a
bar could be added as well. I xtend the hours even
further — studying beyond midnight is not un
known here and more student jobs will be created.

too. In short, make the library what it should be. a
central feature in every student's existence.
• Manzanita Park. Also dubbed "the little tin
ovens" or, more gruesomcly. "Auschwitz West,"
this is Stanford's legendary "temporary" housing,
and it's here to stay for a while longer. Inside, it's
not so bad, honest. But since it looks like no new
graduate housing is forthcoming. I have a modest
suggestion — put some real insulation in the
trailers and eliminate those huge utilit\ bills and
the cold mornings so leletcrioti to acaftemu per
formance. Then maybe we can til . ; h

energy conservation in the residences. Till then, I
will remain a bit cynical. Another tine suggestion
(not originally mine) is a repaint job for these ar
chitectural marvels, in a variety of eye-catching
colors.
• I he Maclottery. Some of us got lucky, and are
now using a Macintosh for such socially useful
purposes as typing newspaper columns. As for
those of you who will he waiting six more months,
how is your cash flow these days? A trailermate
and I have estimated that whoever is sitting on
your payments will earn around $75,000 in inter
est during this time. That works out to about $75
that each person loses in interest: essentially, they
all pay the "handling charge" twice. Whose
scheme was this, and will this continue to be stan
dard operating procedure lor Microdisc?
So now that I ve held forth on a fairly random
assortment of complaints, you probably expect
some heartwarming conclusion. "Gosh, Stanford
ain't so bad after all. It sure is nice to be here."
Nothing ol the sort. Instead, let's see how a typical
I.astern liberal arts college stacks up, just for kicks.
Harvard may not have a beach, but it does have
a permanent body ot water flowing through
campus. Harvard's undergrad library has such
squeaky floors that no one would ever dream of
complaining about noisy students. Harvard doesn't
have a trailer park, so by delr ition it has no trailer
insulation problems. And last. Harvard has no
Microdisc program, so all you .<ltodo is go buy
the computer right away at r, -rket prices. You
draw your own conclusions.
