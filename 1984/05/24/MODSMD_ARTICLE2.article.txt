# City OKs Hospital expansion
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
A $1 10 million planned moderniza
tion project for the Stanford Univer
sity Hospital gained support this week
when the Palo Alto City Council
voted to give the Hospital needed land
use and environmental clearances.
The proposed project still needs ap
proval of a use permit by the city
zoning administrator before work on
any of the modernization can begin.
At its meeting Monday evening, the
city council also recommended the ap
proval of a use permit.
Elvia Garwood, project manager
for the Hospital, said approval of the
use permit should be "fairly routine,"
because of the city council's recom
mendation.

Besides approval of a city use
permit, Garwood said parts of the
planned proposal are still under state
review and awaiting a building permit.
The state building permit is expected
later this summer.
About $1 million worth of moder
nization has been approved by the
state and will begin in mid-June with
the remodeling of the current car
diovascular angiography area, accor
ding to Garwood.
The proposed hospital moderniza
tion consists of three parts: new con
struction, completion of existing space
constructed in 1976 and remodeling of
space built in 1959.
Garwood said the new construction
will cover 350,000 square feet.
"We'll be building 20 new opera

tion rooms and abandoning the 16
that are now technically obsolete," she
said. "Those will be turned over to
some other use."
Garwood said that new construction
is also planned for critically ill
patients.
"We won't be increasing the num
ber of licensed beds, but there will be
mostly critically ill in 200 beds now in
tended for the new construction." she
said.
According to Garwood, the new
construction as well as the completion
of existing space should be completed
in the spring of 1 987.
A hearing to discuss the use permit
before the city zoning administrator is
scheduled for 3 p.m. tomorrow.
