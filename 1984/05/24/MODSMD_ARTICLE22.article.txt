# Golfers off to a bad swing in NCAAs
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
The Stanford men's and women's golf
teams could be excused for feeling as if they
had just been thrown into a pool and told to
swim a few laps with the Russian national

team.
Both squads turned in fairly respectable
scores in the opening round of the 1984
NCAA Golf Championships yesterday, but
upon entering the clubhouse, they learned

that their scores had not been respectable
enough. At the end of the da\. the Cardinal
men were mired in 26th place, while the
highly touted women found themselves in
10th.
The Stanford women, ranked fourth in
the nation, are definitely capable of playing
much better than they did yesterday, and
Coach Tim Baldwin knows it.
"We were fortunate that no one played
really well out there," said Baldwin. "I
think we can still make up those strokes it
Kathy McCarthy gets back into her game
over the next few days and a couple of our
other players improve a little."
The freshman McCarthy — who shot a 70
on the same course in an East-West All-Star
tournament Tuesday — struggled to an un
characteristic 79 yesterday, double
bogeying the 17th hole and bogeying the
18th.
The Cardinal was bolstered by the sizzling
greens play of another freshman, Julie
McCarthy, who registered only 23 putts en
route to a 75 and a tie for eighth place at 75.
Junior Kathy Nino fought oft water trouble
to finish at 79. while second-team All-
WCAA selection sophomore Kathy Kostas
slumped to an 83 and junior Diane Nixon
finished at 88.
Stanford's first-day score of 316 leaves it
12 strokes behind surprising Furman. which
jumped to the lead with a 16-over-par 304.
Miami lurks close behind at 305, while
Stanford rival Arizona State is among a
group at 307.
The Cardinal men also suffered from
poor play by their key swingers, but they did
get some help from an unexpected place.
Sophomore Don Walsworth, who was
very nearly not even taken on the trip to
Houston, came to the 18th tee yesterday at
1 -under-par before triple-bogeying the final
hole to finish at 74.
Walsworth, whom Coach Tim Schaaf
describes as "the team cheerleader," wound
up tied with junior Scott Erickson on the
day, but far behind leader Jim Henman of
North Carolina. Henman fired an amazing
6-under-par 66 and was closely followed by
a group of players at 68.
Stanford's three seniors did not fare well
in the face of this competition. Doug
Thompson fired a 75, Lanny Sawchuck
finished at 77, and No. 1 golfer Tim Robin
son struggled to a 79.
Tournament leaders are Brigham Young
285. Texas at 286, and I.SU at 287. Stan
ford's 12-over-par 300 leaves the team far
out of the early running.

Kalhy Kostas is one of several Stanford golfers who must work her strokes to near
perfection if the No. 4-ranked Cardinal is to rebound from a "good" first day at
the NC AA Championships that left it in only 10th place.
