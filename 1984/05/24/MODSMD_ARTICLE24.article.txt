### LARRY GREEN 
Women's crew
The women's crew team took a good step
toward the upcoming National Collegiate
Championships last weekend when the varsity
team placed second and the novice team
placed fourth in the Pacific Coast Champion
ships.
The varsity placed behind the defending na
tional champion and No. 1-ranked University
of Washington, but ahead of other rowing
powerhouses such as Oregon State University,
UCLA. UC-Berkeley and UC-Davis. On the
strength of its performance the squad will take
part in the nationals in Seattle beginning June
2.
The novice team, seeded second in the
championships placed fourth by virtue of
breakage â€” one of the seats in the boat broke
during the race, leaving the crew with only
seven functional oars. Team captain Jennifer
Glockner commented that the novice finish of
fourth under such conditions was "pretty
amazing." Fortunately, the novice team will
also make the trip to the nationals.
Glockner said the nationals will pit "the
cream of the East against the cream of the
West." But the team is confident about its
chances as Glockner said, "It's not going to be
easy. I'd say we're excited, it's going to take
practically flawless racing but that's not out of
our capability."
Women's Lacrosse
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
finished its season last weekend at the Western
Regional Women's Lacrosse Tournament,

held at UC-Davis. The tourney attraeted eluh
and college teams from the Bay Area, Orange
County, Oregon, Washington state and
Canada.
The Cardinal I posted a 5-0 record and
crushed the University of Western Washington
in the opener. Then it toppled the University
of Oregon and the British Columbian team,
composed of several members of the
Canadian National Lacrosse team. The follow
ing day.the Card posted victories over the Or
ange County lacrosse club and the second team
from British Columbia. According to team
member Stacey Goodwin, "We (Stanford)
probably had the best record at the tourna
ment, but a champion was never crowned."
The tournament, under round-robin format,
was more or less a showcase of women's
lacrosse in the West.
The Stanford II team started its play in the
tournament by beating the Canadian second
team. Then the Orange County club edged the
Cardinal in a tough match and Oregon dealt
the Cardinal II squad its second defeat. The
next day the team rebounded and rolled over
Western Washington and then upset the strong
British Columbia first team.
At tournament's end. two All-Star teams
were chosen from among the players on the
eight American teams present. Stanford placed
six players on the first team and one on the
second. The Card players copping these honors
were: Tirra Austin. Wendy Austin, Li/
Bomann, Julie Erman, Michele Janin, Julie
kuark and Nora Oates.
