## Blier's latest film disappointing 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
freaked-out Bunuel), have in
furiated some feminists who see
Blier's identification with his
male characters — his admission
that he doesn't understand wo-

men either — as evidence of a
misogynist temperament. But
what man would he arrogant
enough to profess that he does
know the way a woman feels? —

Bertrand Blier ends his new
film, My Best Friend's Girl, with
a touching moment. Vivian
(Isabelle Huppert), a young wo
man who has nearly destroyed
the friendship between two
men, Mickey (Coluche) and
Pascal (Thierry l.hermitte), by
sleeping with both of them,
returns after an aborted effort
to leave the Swiss ski resort
where the entire movie has
taken place; presumably her
new lover, a disreputable
looking fellow, has robbed and
abandoned her. (Blier doesn't
spell out the details for us.) As
she climbs the steps to Pascal's
chic cabin — he runs the ski
shop and can afford to live in
style — she overhears Mickey
asking his pal how he thinks
they would act if she ever reap
peared. Pascal sighs, "We'd
take her into our arms and fight
over her all over again;" Vivian
pauses on the steps, out of sight
of the men, and the film fades
out on her indecision about
what to do next.
This melancholy image of ex
clusion made me wish I'd liked
the rest of the movie, especially
since it called to mind the end of
Blier's Get Out Your Handker
chiefs, one of the few — three or
four — great French movies
since the collapse of the New
Wave at the end of the '60s. Get
Out Your Handkerchiefs, which
starred Gerard Depardieu and
the late Patrick Dewaere, was a
comedy about the inability of
men to comprehend women and
the foolish lengths they are will
ing to go in their efforts. At the
end, Blier shows us how the wo
man both men love (Carole
I.aure) has shut them out of her
life, and it's both funny — they
are really such hopeless buf
foons — and touching, because
they are so manically well
meaning, and they'll never un
derstand how things fell out as
they did. Get Out Your Hand
kerchiefs and Blier's earlier
comedies, the Henry Miller-like
Going Places and the messed
up, phenomenally imaginative
Femmes Fa tales (the work of a

though I suppose that a com
placent, respectlul movie like
An Unmarried Woman (which
most men I know hated) ends
up making just that claim.
If I sound as if I'm avoiding a
discussion of My Best Friend's
Girl, it's because I love Blier but
found this latest picture
enervated. In order to score, his
comedies of male bewilderment
and paranoia require both stag
gering audacity and delicacy of
wit, and when his invention
wavers, as it does here, the
scenes a deux and scenes a trois
— he uses a conventional moral
comedy structure similar to Eric
Rohmer's — seem limp and in
terminable.
And he needs extraordinary
actors to play his heroes. Blier
probably tried to turn Coluche
and Lhermitte, a broad, obvious
Mutt and Jeff team, into Depar
dieu and Dewaere and then
realized he couldn't; the movie
certainly feels dispirited, and
that might explain it. For the
first third or so, however,
Isabelle Huppert proves herself
a sunnier comedienne than one
might have expected — her in
souciant tosses of the head and
her dancing eyes distract us
from the redundant actions of
that pair of blockheads. The
irony, of course, is that the
movie — all of Blier's movies —
depend on our identification
with the male characters, but by
the end of the first hour we can
barely tolerate Mickey and Pas
cal, and start praying for a plot
gimmick to move the action
along. (Pascal's house is far
more intriguing than he is; it's
full of surprising nooks and cor
ners.) None ever arrives, and
Vivian, too, begins to wear on
us, so that the picture feels
finished a good half hour before
it actually ends.
Perhaps the last image is so
affecting partly because Vivian
is the only one of the trio we
even begin to develop an inter
est in. In any case, it doesn't
redeem the movie — it mostly
confuses the viewer, who for a
few moments is tricked into
thinking he's seen a great film.
