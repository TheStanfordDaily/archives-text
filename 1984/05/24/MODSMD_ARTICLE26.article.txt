# R.E.M. album is solid
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
R.E.M. hit the new wavish
music scene over the summer
with the single "Radio Free
Europe," a catchy, twangy
rocker with an infectious hut
unintelligible drone chorus.
With the album Murmur,
R.E.M. scored a small-time
new wave hit and a good deal
of critical acclaim; Rolling
Stone's critics poll named
R.E.M. the best new band
and Murmur the best new al
bum of 1983.

Now R.E.M. is trying
again, and the Athens, Ga.,
band is succeeding.
Reckoning is a solid second
release, full of wall-of-sound
new wave with a country and
western feel.
And while there's no stand
out country rocker like
"Radio Free Europe" here.
Reckoning is already grab
bing a fair share of airplay on
both college and "Rock of

the 'KOs" stations.
What makes the album so
exciting is its mystery. From
the album cover — some
thing resembling spilled ink
and white-on-black doodles
— to the song list — scrawled
in unreadable ink smears and
in no particular order — to
the songs themselves —
mostly unintelligible droning
lyrics — R.E.M. remains an
enigma.
In a recent television inter
view, R.E.M. band members

said they think "the impor
tant phrases come out" in the
mix, but even when you can
hear the lyrics, they're as
confusing as when you can't.
They're full of way-too
subtle metaphors and a gen
eral murkiness that goes well
with the music.
So "Seven Chinese brot
hers, wallowing in the
ocean" must be a metaphor
for something. But for what?

You've got me.
On "Don't Go Back to
Rockville," we hear the
refrain over and over and get
the message that Rockville
ain't the place to be today,
hut the harmonized drone on
the rest of the song keeps us
from finding out why.
But it isn't the lyrics alone
that keep R.E.M. such a
mystery. Just when you think
you can stick R.E.M. nicely
in the new category of
country-western new wave,
the band breaks into a 30-
second guitar-funk piece be
tween songs. Why's it there,
and why's it only 30 seconds?
Again, we don't know, but
you get the feeling R.E.M.
somehow does.
On the rest of Reckoning,
R.E.M. relies heavily on
clear electric and ringing
acoustic guitars, straight
ahead drums, a climbing
country bass line, and an oc
casional piano fill, all of
which keeps R.E.M. sound
ing more Nashville than new
wave.
But the music lacks the
pretension of other pseudo
country new wave bands like
Aztec Camera, and there's
none of the country-western
miming Elvis Costello used
on Almost Blue, his
Nashville-recorded Ameri
can country send-up.
On the album's three bal
lads, "Pretty Persuasion,"
"Time after Time
(Annelise)" and "Camera,"
R.E.M. sounds a bit like a
slowed-down version of The
Byrds or Tom Petty, but
there's less happiness in
these songs — even though
we can't be sure exactly what
there actually is in them.
Reckoning, then, is a fine
mood-setting album — you
can tell how you're supposed
to feel by the music if not the
lyrics — and an enigma. The
mystery of R.E.M. keeps you
coming back for another lis-
