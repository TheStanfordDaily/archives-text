# The 						Temptations and Four Tops: more than nostalgia
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
What is the meaning of the
word "nostalgia?" M) Webster's
Dictionary defines it as "a long
ing for something far away and
long ago." Now whether or not
this a good quality to exhibit,
most people have always been
affectionately over-nostalgic
when comes to musical tastes.
Just look at the success of the
film, The Bin ( hill, which owes
much to its nostalgic musical
soundtrack. In fact, the "oldies"
acts are thriving. Whether it's
1050s artists like Chuck Berry,
early '60s performers like Ciary
"U.S.'" Bonds, British Invasion
bands likes the Animals, or'6os
soulsters like Sam and Dave, it
just seems as it the public can
not satisfy its need to get
enough of its musical past.
Unfortunately, the public dis
regards many o! the finer new
bands in favor of washed-up
dinosaurs since they feel these
bands won't challenge them.
The public only wants to hear
the old hits and relive a period
of time that can never really he
captured again. T he public likes
this security and complacency.
To them, a band like the Clash
or IJ-2 is extremely threatening
(disregarding any opinions on
them in purely musical terms)
since these bands attempt to
destroy any ideas of nostalgia or
security. They see music as a
means to change, not as a means
to settle back which occurs in
evitably with the "oldies" acts.
Which brings us to the
Temptations and the I our Tops.
Both bands recently "battled" it
out on Motown's 25th TV spe
cial and the results were so
overwhelmingly positive that
both bands have been on the
road together ever since.
Surprisingly, they have been sel
ling out wherever they've
played, again reaffirming this
nostalgic trait of the public.

However, I can understand why
older people (30s and 40s)
would flock to see such a show.
They grew up with this music,
made out to this music and
cruised around to this music.
Whether it was the Four Tops'
determination to "reach out and
be there" or the Temptations'
love-cry to "their girl," this was
the once great sound of Young
America (as Motown Records
deemed itself). And that's the
very reason why a 21-year-old

music lover couldn't resist
seeing a part of musical history,
whether or not it was nostalgic.
(After all. it's hard to be nostal
gic with two bands that were
around before you were able to
walk.)
So I journeyed up to the
Circle Star with a close friend of
mine (who requested he remain
nameless although he recently
contemplated suicide upon
hearing that Chrisse Hynde of
the Pretenders had married).

and we were not at all disap
pointed with seeing this musical
slice of history. In fact, whatever
these two great Motown vocal
hands possessed in the 60s is
still present with them in the
'NOs. They may not produce any
more hit records hut when it
comes to performing on stage,
they still have a true vitality and
charisma that shines through the
usual nostalgic smugness.
Backed up by a tight 20-piece
orchestra band, the Tempts and

Tops jammed and battled to
gether along with each group
doing an individual 45-minute
set. It was all together two hours
of Motown's finest. Imagine the
impact of seeing the following
songs all being performed at one
show: "Baby I Need Your
Loving," "Ain't Too Proud To
Beg," "Mv Girl," "Reach Out,
I'll Be There," "Papa Was Roll
ing Stone," "Standing In The
Shadows Of Love," "Cloud
Nine," "Walk Away Renee," "I

Can't Get Next lo You,"
"Bernadette," "(I Know) I'm
Losing You," "I Can't Help
Myself," and "Just My Imagina
tion" â€” and then imagine them
all being performed as ii the ar
tists' lives depended on it. What
you get is powerfully uplifting
music that drains its audience
physically and emotionally.
On purely musical terms,
both groups still have their vocal
talents and abilities very much
intact. The Four Tops' lead
singer, Levi Stubbs. is still one
of the world's greatest raspy
shouters. He even displayed
greater abilities on a ballad en
titled "I Believe In You and
Me," where he dramatically
soared from a low rough-hewn
plea to a beautifully poignant
falsetto. It was one of the finest
single performances I've ever
seen by a singer. The Tops were
even more successful than the
Tempts in incorporating newer
material into their act. so in that
night's "battle," I must say that
the Tops edged out the Tempts.
When the Tops powerhoused
through their medley it was like
being assaulted by an endless
array of hits. One classic after
another they came, with the
next song topping the last.
Above all. though, they didn't
just go through the motions of
singing a medley as most oldies
acts do. The Tops, instead,
really dove into the songs of
their medley as if each one was a
do-or-die situation. They sang
them as if this was still the only
way out of the ghetto for them.
As for the Tempts, they too
were as vital and dynamic espe
cially since they are awesome
dancers. Seeing all five of their
members doing fancy footwork
in unison and synchronized
turns and spins is better than
any break dancer I've ever seen.
They too put on a timeless vocal
display in performing their old

hits, but they faltered ever so
slightly when it came to their
newer material. Only on the
hard funk of the Rick James
written and produced "Standing
On The Top" were the Tempts
able to add some of their old
magic to a newer song.
It was as I've said a great, fun
show. The audience was left ec
static and the performers were
equally enthused. But is a trip
through the past as honest and
vital as seeing a band that is
making new meaningful music
and attempting to push the lim
ited horizons of its audience?
The immediacy of the moment
and its accompanying excite

ment is missing with an oldies
act, so is it really worthwhile? Is
this still valid as art? I don't
know and I'd hate to see the day
when I'd have to make the

choice between the two. If the
Tempts and Four Tops were
playing on the same day as the
Clash, 1 just don't know who I'd
see. Do you?
