# Reagan policy may hurt scientists
## Prof criticizes satellite sales

President Reagan's determination
to "commercialize" outer space by
selling some National Aeronautics and
Space Administration satellites to
private industry "can't help hut hurt
academics and researchers," accor
ding to a University professor serving
on a NASA task torce.
"Reagan wants to bring some bucks
in," Ronald Lyon, professor of ap
plied earth science and a member ot
NASA's Task Force on the Scientific
Uses of the Space Station, said in an
interview last night. "What lie did lirst
of all was to say. 'If weather satellites
are so good for so many people, some
body ought to pay for them." Now lie s
saying the same thing about the
Landsat system, the satellites used lor
agriculture and mineral exploration.
"This means that I can only get the
data I need if I'm willing to pay
enough for it. And I can tell you right
now we simply don't have that kind ol
money."
But Lyon, the head ol the Remote
Sensing Laboratory at Stantord. said
commercialization could benefit some
Stanford students.
"The companies bidding on the
I andsat system will be using all the
Stanford students we can produce, lie
said. "That's not a lot. mind you
we're talking about lour or live stu
dents per year. But I'm pleased about
the fact that the employment opportu
nity is high."
Congress rejected a proposal by the
president last year to turn the weather
satellite and the weather forecasting
s\stem over to private industry, but to
date appears to have lew objections to

selling Landsat. As of March 19. seven
companies had submitted Landsat
bids to the government. Lyon said.
Selling the Landsat would
"definitely raise the price" of scientific
research. Lyon said. "If that happens,
there will be no subsidies, or very low
subsidies.
"Under commercialism . . . I'm
going to have to pay for data at some
rate fixed by someone else." Lyon
said. When NASA controls the proj
ects. it looks "at the whole world, not
just at companies with a lot of

money."
In response, scientists would be
compelled to turn to Japan and
France, which are in the process of
putting up a noncommercial Landsat
system. Lyon said. These countries arc
as much as 12 years behind in some
areas of satellite technology.
"People should be able to get the
answers they need from a good
satellite system." Lyon said. "Up until
now there's been a real 'Open Skies

philosophy in the tradition of (former
President Dwight) Eisenhower."
The premise underscoring the
original Open Skies plan "was that
within certain limits, every country
should be able to look at everybody
else's country," Lyon said. Commer
cialization would allow "only the
people with enough bucks" to develop
satellite programs.
For example. Lyon said the United
States has encouraged several

countries to build their own satellite
tracking stations to share in the data
collected by U.S. satellites.
"Each country invests $10 million
per station as an entry fee, plus about
SI to $2 million per year, Lvon said.
"In terms of some countries, that's a
colossal amount of money. What's
going to happen if the United States
suddenly says 'no' to these people?"
But. Lyon said, NASA's present
control of the Landsat is not without

problems.
" I he fact is that NASA and the
other agencies involved (with
l andsat) can't distribute information
last enough." Lyon said. "We've been
dealing with a six- to eight-month
delay in some cases.
"II we have commercialization, I
can get the data more rapidly â€” if I
pay enough for it. But scientists and
academics don't have the funds to buy
data. They tend to go for the cheapest
route," he said.
