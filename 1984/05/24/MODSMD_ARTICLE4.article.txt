### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Hoover Tower will be opening in
time for Commencement after un
dergoing close to a year of renova
tion.
Restorations will he finished hy
the end of this week, and the
Tower will be opening shortly
thereafter, according to Don Price,
manager of construction for the
University. Once again visitors will
be able to take an elevator ride to
the viewing deck on top.
Renovations included two main
projects — the remodeling of
offices on the 10th floor and the in
stalling of new heating and ventila
tion systems throughout the build
ing, Price said.
The Tower was closed by the
University in February, 1983, be
cause it posed a serious fire hazard,
according to Price.
"We are installing life safety sys
tems, including an electrical warn
ing system for fire. This was a
serious problem because of the in
creasing paper content of various
collections within the Tower,"
Price said.
Fie estimated the combined cost
for both projects at approximately
$1 million.
Tourism on campus has been
hurt by the Tower's closing, said
Rene Cortinaz, manager of the
Guide and Visitors Service.
"We have had a loss in the num
ber of visitors that the Guide and
Visitors Service has received, and a
loss in financial income. We still of
fer our regular walking tours and
those have been as strong as ever,"
she said.
However, the Tower's closing
has not significantly affected the
number of visitors here, Cortinaz
said.
"We're looking forward to the
opening of the tower — visitors
really enjoy that view from the
top." she said.
The Tower's observation deck
was closed last year in order that a
sprinkler system and smoke alarms
could be installed. A 19N2 Santa
Clara County law had set new
provisions tor the fireproofing of
tall buildings.
Officials closed the Tower
months before the actual renova
tion began for "legal reasons."
