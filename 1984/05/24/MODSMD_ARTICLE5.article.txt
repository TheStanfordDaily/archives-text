# Stanford earns $2 million in tech royalties
## 
### DAVID RISSER Staff writer 
Stanford received more than S2 million last year
in royalties from the licensing of 73 technology dis
coveries made as a result of faculty and student re
search.
The Ottice of Technology Licensing (OIL), in
its annual report, identified the DNA cloning
licensing program as the largest single source of
income. Hie 6N licensees in the DNA program pay
$10,000 each per year in advance royalties.
I he OTL was formed in I9M to patent
University-related discoveries and to market them
to companies. Since its conception. University
royalties from new technology licensing have in
creased tremendously.
Stanford income from this source rose from
$392,000 in fi NCa | year 197N-7 1 ) to a peak of $2.5
million in 19NI-N2.
Significant earned rovaltv income from the 1973

DNA cloning discovery is not expected until fiscal
year 1987-NN. according to the report.
"This presumes, of course, that our technology
continues as the DNA cloning technique of choice
and possible patent challenges are surmountable,"
the annual report notes.
The University is actively seeking DNA product
patents from the U.S. Patent Office. The first sales
of a DNA cloning product, human insulin, were
made by the Eli Lilly Co. last year.
"The larger financial payoff from (more recent)
discoveries will occur at least five to 10 years in the
future, if past experience is any guide." OTL
Director Niels Reimers said. "Indeed, although we
have 73 technologies licensed, the majority of
income comes from technologies first disclosed to
the OTL in 1974 or earlier."
In its first full year of operation this year, the
Software Distribution Center created by the OTL
completed 192 licensing agreements.

Pre-1974 discoveries that continue to bring in
money include a cell sorter and a sound synthesizer
developed here, according to Sally Nines, adminis
trative assistant at OTL.
"A survey of leading research universities
revealed all had large percentage increases in in
dustry research support and in te hnology dis
closures from faculty and students," Reimers said.
The sharp increase in university-industry inter
action is reflected nationally in the growth of the
Society of University Patent Administrators. The
society increased from 51 members in 1975, its
founding year, to more than 300 members cur
rently.
The overall rate of technology disclosures at
Stanford increased from two to three per week in
past years to 3.7 per week last year.
These disclosures represent only the discoveries
reported to the OTL. "We have no
way ot knowing what else is out
there." Hinessaid.
It a discovery results from
government-sponsored research the
researcher must use the OTL pro
gram. according to Mines. It a dis
covery is made outside of government
research, the researcher is not re
quired. hut st,ll has the option, to use
the OTL program.
According to Mines, the OTL "has
no feel for whether or not patents are
being made by researchers (not utiliz
ing the OTL program)."
"The OI L's main selling point is
our contacts on the outside. Faculty
members often can't spend time mar
keting inventions." Hinessaid.
Net royalty income from technology
licensed under the OTL program,
after a deduction of 15 percent plus
out-of-pocket expenses for the OTL.
is usually distributed in equal thirds to
inventors, their departments and their
schools.
