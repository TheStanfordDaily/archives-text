Lebanese agree on peace plan
Beirut, Lebanon — The Lebanese Cabinet yesterday
agreed on another plan aimed at ending the fighting in Beirut,
and Premier Rashid Karami said he hoped it would take ef
fect "very soon."
Karami also lashed out at what he called the inhuman be
havior ot Israeli forces who occupy the southern third of
Lebanon.
The premier announced the formulation of a cease-fire
plan after the weekly Cabinet meeting in the resort town of
Bikfaya. He gave no details of how the government plans to
stop the fighting between Christian and Moslem militiamen,
which had resulted in two deaths only the night before.
The Cabinet, which is made up of Lebanon's leading war
lords and factional leaders, has been trying to stabilize Beirut
for the last three weeks and there is no assurance, or much
optimism, that the latest proposal will work. There have been
numerous cease-fires, a buffer zone — filled with policemen
and army recruits — between the two sides, as well as two
previous national reconciliation conferences in Switzerland.
Nothing has worked.
Daughter fears Sakharov dead
\ atican City — After receiving words of support from Pope
John Paul II here yesterday, the stepdaughter of physicist
Andrei Sakharov expressed fear that the Soviet dissident,
who began a hunger strike in Gorky on May 2, may have
died.
"There is a total absence of information about what is their
condition and where they are," said Tatiana Yankelevich,
who is in Rome to publicize the plight of Sakharov and his
ailing wife, Yelena Bonner. Yankelevich is Bonner's
daughter.
She said that there had been no response to her persistent
attempts to get Soviet authorities to arrange a telephone call
to her parents for reassurance concerning their well-being.
"Instead, the authorities have been feeding out information
that the Sakharovs are in the best possible condition with
medical help, and that they are in their own apartment in
Gorky, which is not true," she said.
