### 
from The Washington Post
Manama, Bahrain — \t the apparent
request of Saudi Arabia. Syria yesterday
plunged into a mediation mission in the
Persian Gulf shipping war and dis
patched two top officials to Tehran.
Less than 24 hours after receiving an
important Saudi emissary with a message
from King la lid. Syrian President Hafez
Assad entrusted N ice President Abdul
llalim Khaddam and 112 oreign Minister
Farouk Charaa with a letter to President
All Khamenei of Iran.
Meanwhile, for the fifth straight day
no attacks on international shipping were
reported in the Persian Gulf, where the
war between Iraq and Iran had spilled
over earlier this month with both
countries attacking oil tankers and cargo
vessels of noninvolved countries.
Hie contents of the Saudi message to

Syria or the Syrian letter to Iran were not
disclosed lint the publicity given the
Syrian delegation's departure In the
olten-secietixe official Damascus press
clearly indicated the high prioritv Assad
accorded the mission and his pivotal im
portance hi Middle East politics.
Such a mission underlines Assad's
thesis that Syria's isolated support for
Iran kept crucial communications chan
nels open with Tehran for all the Arabs.
Analysts suggested that Syria, united
with Iran in mutual hatred of Iraqi Presi
dent Saddam Hussein, could do little
more than urge caution on Tehran on be
half of Saudi Arabia and its five conser
vative Arab oil-state allies in the Gull
Cooperation Council.
Analysts say they think these Arab
states would be delighted if. in the words
of the Syrian government newspaper

Tishrin. the mission succeeded in
■"minimizing" the shipping wars

Saudi encouragement of the mission

cern not |iist ovci Iranian air attacks on
Saudi and Kuwaiti tankers last week. but
indirectly with the stepped-up Iraqi an
raids that prompted them.
Meanwhile. Saddam Hussein, whose
war effort has received .111 estimated
billion in support from the conservative
Arab states, continued his tough talk
aimed at Iran. At a military ceremony,
the Iraqi leader reiterated Ins warning
that "we w ill not retreat 112 roni our plan to
