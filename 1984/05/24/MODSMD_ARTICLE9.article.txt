## Punk rock group creates art Whipping Boy removes fat lady 
### VIRGINIA GUISER 
They play punk rock. They all have ties to
Stanford.
It may seem an unlikely combination, but
Whipping Boy is not a typical punk band.
Comprised of three current and one
former Stanford student, they play music
which allows them to be creative, to be ar
tists, according to senior Eugene Robinson,
the group's vocalist.
"Before punk rock came on the scene, a
kind of over-blown intellectualism was sit
ting on top of music and art like a fat lady,"
Robinson said. "Punk rock, with its anar
chistically creative spirit scared the fat wo
man away."
Robinson said that most punk music is
not anti-intellectual but anti-affected intel
lectualism, which stifles creativity.
"We're a thinking punk's band," said
guitarist Steve Ballinger.
Ballinger, a high school teacher, husband
and father, personifies the seeming incon
gruity of this punk band with conventional
and intellectual backgrounds.
Sam Smoot, a junior biology major from
Billings, Mont., plays bass, while drummer
Dave Owens, originally from West Ger
many and also a junior, is double-majoring
in electrical engineering and computer sci
ence. Robinson, the group's lead vocalist, is

a senior majoring in broadcast journalism
from Brooklyn, N.Y.
Formed in 19N1, the group originally
played hardcore punk rock.
Its first album. The Sound of No Hands
Clapping, was a special-interest iccord
with a limited, punk audience Robinson
said. But the soon-to-bc-rclcased second al
bum marks a transition to a more melodic,
thoughtful sound.
"The band stil! has the energy and psyc
hodramatic effects of punk," Robinson said.
Muru, Mum, the new album which was
recorded in San Francisco and produced by
the Dead Kennedy's Klaus Flouride, is, in
large part, a departure from the band's ear
lier work.
"It's much more cohesive," Ballinger
said. "We made it very carefully so all the
songs tie together. It's almost like a story.
We paid a lot more attention to detail this
time."
"It's like the sound of music from 196 X at
the Fillmore put into a blender with blues,
reggae and punk to for a kind of psychedelic
misn-mash," Robinson said.
With this newer sound, Ballinger hopes
that the second album will reach a larger au
dience.
"We're hoping that people that we
wanted to reach with the first record and
didn't will hear the second record and see

what we're up to," he said.
Smoot said Whipping Boy s listening au
dienee is older, more mature than average
punk fans and will probably understand the
change in the band's sound.
Having put all ot its energy and money
into the new album, the group has not
played live since last fall. In previous years.
Whipping Hoy toured the United States and
Canada, as well as performed throughout
the Bay Area.
Although the group has played Stanford
about seven or eight times, it doesn't con
sider itself a "party band."
"The amount of time and energy that we
put into our songs in terms of content and
concept is pretty much lost in a party atmo
sphere." Ballinger said.
"We supply art, not party, said Robin
son.
Still, the group maintains a local follow
ing.
"There are people at Stanford who like our
trip." Smoot said. "They like what we stand
for."
Having cut out live performances, the
future of the group hinges on the success of
the new album, scheduled to be released
next month. Until then. Whipping Boy
remains a unique group with a uniquely in
tellectual bend.
