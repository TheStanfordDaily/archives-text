# Aid or arms?
## Benefit party's proceeds questioned 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
The controversy over U.S. aid to
Central America has even spread to
the campus party scene as tonight's
Synergy house benefit for Nicaragua
has come under lire Irom campus critics.
Party planners say the money will
go lor food, clothing and education in
the war-torn country, but conservative
critics say the funds will be used to
purchase weapons for the Sandinista
government.
In response to queries as to the in
tended use ol lunds raised by tonight's
Aid for Nicaragua party, Synergy resi
dent Marc Gimbrere said, "The
money is going to the grass-roots level
lor food, clothing, education and pos
sibly defense."
The party began as a benefit to raise
money for citizens of East Palo Alto.
Gimbrere said. "However, several
members of the house are involved in
SCAAN (Stanford Central American
Action Network), and we decided that
this (Nicaragua) has the most ur
gency."
In addition to soliciting donations
from residences. Synergy is charging a
$2 admission fee and is offering T
shirts for sale. The shirts, presented by
the U.S. Out Of Central America
(IJSOOCA) network, feature a map
of current contra and Sandinista posi
tions in Nicaragua.
"The proceeds are being sent
through IJSOOCA to the Sandinista
Defense Committee, which has a
strong grass-roots base," Gimbrere
said.
Yet Steve Dauber, president of the
Stanford Republican League, is con
cerned that "the money they are
raising will be used to buy arms for the
Sandinistan army."
Synergy resident Jim Costain does
not deny this possibility. "Some of the
money is known to be used for weap
ons, but it is also used for health, food
and literacy. It should l»e u-nccl lor
whatever the people want it to be used
for."

The history of this controversial
Sandinista Defense Committee began
in the early days of the revolution, ac
cording to Robert Wesson, senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution. "It is a
civil group which helps to coordinate
the Sandinista politics with the popu
lation and to organize the people."
The committee is actually a network
of small, neighborhood committees,
from whence comes the grass-roots
aspect, Wesson said. "They hold
neighborhood meetings to which
people are invited, or rather advised,
to come. They are a law enforcement
agency."
Wesson described committee activi
ties as handling food ration cards,
fighting crime, suppressing counter
revolutionary activities and helping
the Sandinista militia. "Sending the
Sandinista Defense Committee any
monetary aid is equivalent to sending
it to the Nicaraguan government," he
concluded.
Col. Lawrence Tracy, from the Of
fice of Public Diplomacy in the State
Department expressed a slightly dif
ferent opinion of this organization. "It
is a network of informants obviously
sympathetic to the Sandinista govern
ment. It is very similar to certain or
ganizations in Cuba.
Gimbrere defended his position,
saying, "First, you have to understand
their (Wesson and Tracy) perspective.
They are staunch conservatives.
Second, I think that what the U.S.
government is doing is wrong. They
shouldn't be supporting the contrast
He stressed that this is not necessar
ily Synergy's position. "There is a
good chance that Synergy would not
have reached this consensus,"
Gimbrere said, "if they had thought
some ot the money would go to buying
weapons."
Gimbrere summed up Synergy's in
volvement in the issue, "We think and
we feel and we worry about every
thing, just like everyone else does. We
do what we feel is riuht."
