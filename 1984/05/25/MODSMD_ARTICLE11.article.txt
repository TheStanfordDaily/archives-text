20-hour trial, a jury convicted five former na
tional guardsmen yesterday of killing four
American church women whose deaths in 19,50
became a rallying point for opposition to U.S.
aid to El Salvador.
The murders became symbolic of the
country's widespread human rights abuses and
the U.S. Congress lias withheld its decision on
$19 million in military aid for the government
until after the trial.
The five-member jury seated in straight
backed wooden chairs heard 20 hours of tes
timony and argument broken only by brief
recesses. They deliberated for an hour before
returning a verdict of guilty on all counts
shortly before dawn.
The convicted men had been returned to
their jail cells and were not in the courtroom
when the verdict was read.
Relatives of the dead women called the con
viction a good first step toward learning who
ordered the killing and who tried to cover it up.

Michael Posner. director of the l awyers Com
mittee for International Human Rights, said he
has been assured there will be an investigation
ol whether higher authorities were involved
A U.S. Embassy statement said "the suc
cessful prosecution ol these murderers shows
the Salvadoran criminal justice system can be
made to work."

man John Hughes said. " I he I nitcd States is
fully committed to assisting the government ol
El Salvador in the strengthening of the Sal

guardsmen "are going to be punished lor the
crime that high military chiefs ordered."
