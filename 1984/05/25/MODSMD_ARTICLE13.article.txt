## Campus noise can do damage 
### CLAY CALVERT Daily staff 
I his Ls the lust in a series of three arti
l ies dealing with the hazards of noise ex
posure to the hearing of college stude/us.

Every day. Stanford students are
exposed to wide varieties of noise levels,
ranging from the quiet of Meyer Library
to the noise of a fraternity party. Most of
the noise students encounter does little
or no damage to the ear, yet excessive
and prolonged exposure to common
devices and events can prove harmful in
later life.
According to William Clark, a re
search psychologist at The Central In
stitute for the Deaf, an institution affili
ated with Washington University in St.
Louis, the safe sound level one can be
exposed to over a period of time is 90
decibels (dB). The Bel is a unit of sound
intensity, expressing a ratio of the differ
ence between two sounds. Clark said that
pain occurs at a level of 120 decibels.
The range of decibel levels of some
common devices found around campus
are as follows: motorcycle, SO-1 10 dBA;
video arcade, NO-KK dBA: lawn mower,
NO-95 dBA: personal stereo (Walkman
type), 94-115 dBA; home stereo, 90-
105 dBA: an automobile at 50 mph. 60-
92 dBA and a passing bus, 70-NN dBA.
Clark said that the average decible
level at a rock concert is 105 dBA yet
can reach a high of 117 dBA. He said
that occasional exposure to such noise is

not dangerous, although minimal
damage will take place. "There is always
going to he some damage to the ear,"
Clark said.
The effect of noise concerns those at
Stanford, too. Holly Hosford Dunn, as
sistant professor and director of audiol
ogy at the Stanford Medical Center, said
that a program has been established to
measure the effects of the noise emitted
from the new "Life Flight" helicopter
service on the nurses who man the chop
per. She said that one ride in the helicop
ter would not cause damage to the ear,
but prolonged exposure could have a
possible effect on one's hearing.
Clark and Dunn both cited the port
able stereo with headphones as one of the
chief culprits responsible lor damage to
the ear today among college students.
On the volume scale of one to 10 on a
cheaper model of such a device, Clark
said that a level of four has been mea
sured to put out more than 100 decibels.
John Wallin, a freshman in Branner
Hall, said that a pamplet from the
Electronic Industries Association Con
sumer Electronics Group was enclosed
with the "Sports Walkman" he pur
chased over spring vacation. He noted
that the pamplet was rather vague.
"The manual reads 'Do not play your
headset at a high volume,' which left me
to wonder just what constitutes a high
volume. Does it mean that it's safe to
turn the volume up 'til it hurts or arc you
supposed to turn it to a level equal to

that of our room's stereo? It also had the
slogan on the back, 'Re-
member .. . use your head
when you use your headset.' It's a cute
phrase, but it doesn't tell me too much
except to use my own judgment," Wallin
said.
Clark recommended that with a
Walkman-type device, the listener
should take a break after listening con
tinuously for two to 2'/a hours.
A room stereo with an effective
speaker and a 60-watt amplifier can
produce a sound of 105 to 110 decibels,
Clark said, adding that damage to the ear
increases as one moves closer to the
speaker.
At a typcial frat or dorm party with
live band — usually taking place in a
room with poor acoustics — the noise
level is almost always higher than 100
decibels. Clark said that a good rule to
remember is that if you "have to move
within a few feet of somebody to talk,
then the noise level is probably hazard
ous."
Despite the seemingly gloomy outlook
for our ears, Clark said that there is no
need for a student to throw away his
stereo or trash his tapes. He said that
there are three simple things to watch for
to prevent damage to the ear and still en
joy music, go to concerts and be exposed
to other loud devices: Monitor the level
of the noise, duration of the period of ex
posure to noise and scheduling of expo
sure to high noise levels.
