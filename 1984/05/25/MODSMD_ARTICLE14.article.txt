# Tourists invade Farm

### LISA PALMER 
They come from Asia, Africa, Atherton and
Arkansas. Conspicuously carrying cameras and
purses rather than the obligatory student hack
pack, visitors to campus include alums, parents,
potential Stanford students and. of course,
tourists.
According to Rene Cortina/, manager of the
Stanford Visitor's Service, approximately 50,000
tourists flock to campus every year. The busiest
months are during the summer and in the month
of August alone, 7000 visitors come to campus,
she says.
Many prospective students \isit campus, com
ing from as nearby as Woodside, and as far away
as Korea. Kiwhan Inn, who traveled 16 hours to
\isit Stanford, admitted a common pre
acceptance worry. "I like Stanford but wonder if
they like me."
Inn's impression of Stanford was favorable. "I
like the atmosphere. Everybody looks \erv smart
and especially are very kind," he said.
The closure of Hoover Tower, however, has
had some effect on the number of visitors this
year. "Usually 85 to 90 percent of the visitors go
to the observation tower," Cortinaz explains. But

because of the closure, "probably only half the
usual number of visitors have come this year."
In addition to climbing Hoover Tower, many
groups visit Stanford because of a special interest.
Hosea Belcher, program coordinator of the Guide
and Visitor Service, cites a group from Cal Poly
who "ignored the rest of campus and just wanted
to see the architecture of Terman."
Memorial Church is another big attraction for
tourists. On a side trip from a business meeting in
San Francisco, one gentleman from Paris, while
impressed by the Rodin sculptures, was "looking
for that nice church."
A visitor from Switzerland was equally im
pressed. "It's fabulous. The church is absolutely
fabulous." But she had made another discovery
too. "We got some lovely books. We love that
bookstore," she said, sporting a couple of bound
classics.
The people who work at the Bookstore like the

tourists as well. Kosie Sims, a Bookstore em
ployee, said that "visitors are always a pleasure.
You know it's a tour because you see all the
smiling faces."
In addition, visitors have a large impact on
sales. According to Laura Dowling, buyer for the
Bookstore, tourists are responsible for "probably
50 percent of sales during the summer and 25 per
cent during the rest of the year."
Japanese visitors are especially fond of Stanford
souvenirs and rings. Sims says that she has been
told that "you can't go down a street in Japan and
not see a Stanford T-shirt."
Ben Esposito, manager of The Store in Tresid
der. says that visitors have a large impact on sales
there as well. He explained that, "while items
such as M &. M's are hard-core all the time,
during the summer you have to change the potato
chips" to suit different tastes. "Summers," he
says, "are pretty kicking around here," and es
timates that business is about 85 percent of nor
mal during the summer months.
One couple snapping pictures of the architec
ture of the Inner Quad was much impressed by
Stanford. Hailing from Oxford. England, they
said that "you can't compare the two (Oxford and

Stanford). They are both beautiful but have dif
ferent types of beauty."
Another tourist, from Westphalen, West Ger
many. home of Muenster University, made a dan
gerous comparison. "Stanford is giuit." but
"Berkeley is besser."
Giving their three-month-old "prospective''
Stanford student his first taste of frozen yogurt,
two Berkeley graduates claimed, "Well, if you
want some action, you've got to go to Berkeley.
But this is a great place to relax, and the sunshine
is nice."
Bob Newton, an alumnus from the Class of '67
wouldn't stoop to such comparisons. He pointed
out some changes that Stanford has had in the
years since he graduated and said. "Stanford will
always be Stanford. There's none like it. I've been
to Harvard, where you just kind of get there. At
Stanford, you come up Palm Drive and it's a
happening."
