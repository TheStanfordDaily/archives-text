Sure, we understand William Casey's line 011
the Nicaraguan harbor minings. No one asked
him specifically about the mining, so why tell.
That's not really a lie under the technical defini
tion now is it? But we have a little tougher time
on the issue of the Carter campaign briefing
papers.
Somehow we just don't buv Casey's lack of
recollection concerning his receiving ot unauth
orized information from President Carter's 19N0
campaign. And neither does the House Subcom
mittee on Human Resources, which, after an I 1-
month investigation, released a 2400-page report
Wednesday stating that "the better evidence indi
cates that Carter debate briefing materials en
tered the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign through
its director, William Casey. . . ."
The subcommittee had earlier received tes
timony from James Baker, Reagan's chief of staff,
saying that lie had received Carter materials from
Casey. The subcommittee report now included
corroboration of that testimony by another wit
ness.

Meanwhile. Casey has staunchly maintained
that he does not remember ever seeing any ma
terials. The incredible contradiction between his
testimony and that ol Baker and others is
frightening.
We find it disturbing that the earlier Depart
ment ot Justice investigation — whose results
were available to the subcommittee — could only
find that "any seeming inconsistencies could be
explained by differences 111 recollection or inter
pretation."
Lying is a serious offense in an investigation, and
not even a CIA director is excused from the con
sequences.
Casey has yet to comment on the report — his
spokesman says he has yet to read it. We want to
hear his comments. We think maybe his memory
will clear up a bit now. We want to see an inde
pendent prosecutor called in and a judicial inves
tigation begun, as called for by the subcommittee.
Obviously further investigation is necessary.
Obviously Casey has become a liability to an ad
ministration not devoid of liabilities.
