## Abandon policies not befitting a university 
### 
My congratulations to the Stanford admin
istration on its decision to urge both Standard
Oil ot California and Motorola to pressure the
South African regime to recognize and ac
comodate the legitimate needs of its black
subjects. Even an action as small as this allows
those of us who care deeply about humanity

VIEWPOINT

and its currently troubled condition to main
tain some small hope that the power centers of
the Western world are not vet severed from
the needs of everyday people, or from the
principles we hear touted so often: liberty,
justice and freedom.
As one who left Harvard University six
years ago over precisely this issue (the unwill
ingness of Harvard financial managers to
either divest or use the university's equity po
sition in companies operating within South
Africa as a lever for progressive change), I am
delighted to find that my hard-earned tuition
dollars are not, at least in this regard, being
abused. Although 1 personally favor the more
radical policy of divestiture, 1 am nonetheless
pleased to see a major institution actually use
its equity position in a manner many institu
tions have only promised to.
Without detracting from this positive action
I would like to point out. as examples, several
other areas in which this university has not yet

had the strength to apply principles it
presumably is committed to on an intellectual
level.
Consider first the anti-democratic meaning
of the University's refusal to recognize the
democratic process at work within the United
Stanford Workers. No material cost to the
University seems to be at stake. A legal tech
nicality is being used for political advantage
while democratic principles are put aside "for
the moment."
Consider the rental situation for Escondido
Village residents. With the one hand the Uni
versity writes about academic excellence,
while with the other it raises rents summarily,
threatening the ability of some students to
stay here, while signaling others that perhaps
they should not come here.
An everyday commitment by administra
tors to the human and intellectual tradition
they are presumably employed, in part, to
protect, would never have allowed the deci
sion process to have taken the path which it
did. Would it have been so difficult to be
sensitive to the tact that at ahy truly demo
cratic university a fair number of gifted stu
dents will be financially poor?
As a last example consider the University
policy on the acceptability of research that
prohibits basing decisions upon "speculations
concerning the political or moral impropriety

of the uses which may be made of (research)
results."
How can any institution committed to
treedom and the responsibility it entails have
as a policy a position which essentially
castrates responsible discussion? How could
any responsible person choose between ac
tions without at least considering their possi
ble consequences? I should like to think that
none of the parties involved in this dispute is
committed to the message this policy conveys:
"We don't care about how our work impacts
on other members of our society or the
world." Certainly that is one of the most
hypocritical messages a Western university
could broadcast.
Clearly we should not support apartheid,
but should instead press for an end to this in
humane slave-like condition. We should not
discourage worker democracy, but encourage
it and its responsible expression. We should
not penalize further those w ho are already less
fortunate financially or disregard the conse
quences of our actions. Anyone who is really
educated recognizes the truth of these state
ments as starting points, and further
recognizes that the cited issues are complex
and not easily resolved. Nonetheless, these
difficulties will never be hurdled by running at
them backwards.
The quality of education is not only a nar
row matter of classroom instruction or re

search prominence, but also a function of the
gestalt in which these activities take place. A
Stanford education is a failure by this crite
rion. Despite Stanford's intellectual creden
tials and expansive architecture, one here does
not learn to consider and respect, as a matter
of habit, the rights or fundamental needs of
human beings. Certainly administrative policy
and action in the cited instances do not form
an exemplary context. Overall the context
here teaches lessons which further our prob
lems in the human dimension.
In the never-ending public debate which
characterizes democratic societies we must be
reminded of the power of ideas like liberation
and justice, and of the role which ideas play in
history. We must be reminded that there is
more to human affairs than dollars and
krugerands. We have a right to expect centers
of higher learning to fill this role; and to ex
emplify in their administrative conduct the
best which the Western tradition has to offer.
In my opinion Harvard has forsaken this
role, whose fulfillment contributed substan
tially in the 18th and 19th centuries to the
reputation that institution still enjoys. Ad
ministratively Harvard has lost touch, I fear
permanently, with considerations other than
narrow-minded calculations about the impact
a decision might have on its prestige or its
precious endowment.
Stanford is still a young school, only

recently risen to prominence, and not yet
entrenched in tradition. I would not have
prepared this viewpoint it I did not think it
might both prompt and help the members of
this university to redefine the way it operates.
There are aspects ot the Stanford experience,
such as the Honor Code, the cooperative atti
tude of many faculty members, and this recent
action with regard to South Africa, which sug
gest that a Stanford education may someday
help young people re-define worldly success
in concert with the needs of an awakening
humanity.
I he real question — which underlies these
other issues — is whether those with power in
Stanford at fairs will be satisfied with decisions
made solely on the basis of fiscal expediency,
and the well-deserved reputation as "the Har
vard of the West" which will follow. We can
only admonish and urge that something more
suited to the needs of the 2()th and 21st cen
turies will develop here: an administrative
style which copes well with the human dimen
sion. In so doing Stanford will forge for itself a
reputation on its own basis which will bring
accolades irom my grandchildren and gre;it-
grandchildren — who will undoubtedly never
be born unless someone in power faces up to
the real issues, soon.

nicality is being used for political advantage
while democratic principles are put aside "for
the moment."
Consider the rental situation for Escondido
Village residents. With the one hand the Uni
versity writes about academic excellence,
while with the other it raises rents summarily,
threatening the ability of some students to
stay here, while signaling others that perhaps
they should not come here.
An everyday commitment by administra
tors to the human and intellectual tradition
they are presumably employed, in part, to
protect, would never have allowed the deci
sion process to have taken the path which it
did. Would it have been so difficult to be
sensitive to the tact that at ahy truly demo
cratic university a fair number of gifted stu
dents will be financially poor?
As a last example consider the University
policy on the acceptability of research that
prohibits basing decisions upon "speculations
concerning the political or moral impropriety

of the uses which may be made of (research)
results."
How can any institution committed to
treedom and the responsibility it entails have
as a policy a position which essentially
castrates responsible discussion? How could
any responsible person choose between ac
tions without at least considering their possi
ble consequences? I should like to think that
none of the parties involved in this dispute is
committed to the message this policy conveys:
"We don't care about how our work impacts
on other members of our society or the
world." Certainly that is one of the most
hypocritical messages a Western university
could broadcast.
Clearly we should not support apartheid,
but should instead press for an end to this in
humane slave-like condition. We should not
discourage worker democracy, but encourage
it and its responsible expression. We should
not penalize further those w ho are already less
fortunate financially or disregard the conse
quences of our actions. Anyone who is really
educated recognizes the truth of these state
ments as starting points, and further
recognizes that the cited issues are complex
and not easily resolved. Nonetheless, these
difficulties will never be hurdled by running at
them backwards.
The quality of education is not only a nar
row matter of classroom instruction or re

search prominence, but also a function of the
gestalt in which these activities take place. A
Stanford education is a failure by this crite
rion. Despite Stanford's intellectual creden
tials and expansive architecture, one here does
not learn to consider and respect, as a matter
of habit, the rights or fundamental needs of
human beings. Certainly administrative policy
and action in the cited instances do not form
an exemplary context. Overall the context
here teaches lessons which further our prob
lems in the human dimension.
In the never-ending public debate which
characterizes democratic societies we must be
reminded of the power of ideas like liberation
and justice, and of the role which ideas play in
history. We must be reminded that there is
more to human affairs than dollars and
krugerands. We have a right to expect centers
of higher learning to fill this role; and to ex
emplify in their administrative conduct the
best which the Western tradition has to offer.
In my opinion Harvard has forsaken this
role, whose fulfillment contributed substan
tially in the 18th and 19th centuries to the
reputation that institution still enjoys. Ad
ministratively Harvard has lost touch, I fear
permanently, with considerations other than
narrow-minded calculations about the impact
a decision might have on its prestige or its
precious endowment.
Stanford is still a young school, only

recently risen to prominence, and not yet
entrenched in tradition. I would not have
prepared this viewpoint it I did not think it
might both prompt and help the members of
this university to redefine the way it operates.
There are aspects ot the Stanford experience,
such as the Honor Code, the cooperative atti
tude of many faculty members, and this recent
action with regard to South Africa, which sug
gest that a Stanford education may someday
help young people re-define worldly success
in concert with the needs of an awakening
humanity.
I he real question — which underlies these
other issues — is whether those with power in
Stanford at fairs will be satisfied with decisions
made solely on the basis of fiscal expediency,
and the well-deserved reputation as "the Har
vard of the West" which will follow. We can
only admonish and urge that something more
suited to the needs of the 2()th and 21st cen
turies will develop here: an administrative
style which copes well with the human dimen
sion. In so doing Stanford will forge for itself a
reputation on its own basis which will bring
accolades irom my grandchildren and gre;it-
grandchildren — who will undoubtedly never
be born unless someone in power faces up to
the real issues, soon.

My congratulations to the Stanford admin
istration on its decision to urge both Standard
Oil ot California and Motorola to pressure the
South African regime to recognize and ac
comodate the legitimate needs of its black
subjects. Even an action as small as this allows
those of us who care deeply about humanity

VIEWPOINT

and its currently troubled condition to main
tain some small hope that the power centers of
the Western world are not vet severed from
the needs of everyday people, or from the
principles we hear touted so often: liberty,
justice and freedom.
As one who left Harvard University six
years ago over precisely this issue (the unwill
ingness of Harvard financial managers to
either divest or use the university's equity po
sition in companies operating within South
Africa as a lever for progressive change), I am
delighted to find that my hard-earned tuition
dollars are not, at least in this regard, being
abused. Although 1 personally favor the more
radical policy of divestiture, 1 am nonetheless
pleased to see a major institution actually use
its equity position in a manner many institu
tions have only promised to.
Without detracting from this positive action
I would like to point out. as examples, several
other areas in which this university has not yet

had the strength to apply principles it
presumably is committed to on an intellectual
level.
Consider first the anti-democratic meaning
of the University's refusal to recognize the
democratic process at work within the United
Stanford Workers. No material cost to the
University seems to be at stake. A legal tech
nicality is being used for political advantage
while democratic principles are put aside "for
the moment."

Village residents. With the one hand the Uni
versity writes about academic excellence,
while with the other it raises rents summarily,
