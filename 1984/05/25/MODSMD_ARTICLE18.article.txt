## Life of child at least as important as fetus 
### 
Jason Matherly's column "Abortion: The right
to kill" (Daily, May 17) showed how ready some
people arc to take away the rights of the individ
ual. Women have different reasons why they
choose abortion, but murder is not one of them.
Women should be able to determine how to run

VIEWPOINT

their lives, and what is best tor them. Abortions
should be legal and available to all women.
Matherly failed to mention that not all women
who have abortions have them as a result of what
he might call sexual promiscuity or feel that they
value their right of "consequence-free sexual in
tercourse" over human life. Some women have
abortions because they were raped. Some women
(and girls) have abortions because they were
sexually abused by a relative or close friend. Some
women have abortions because they are not ready

for motherhood either mentally or financially.
Does Matherly condemn every one of these wo
men as heinous murderers?
What about forcing women to hear unwanted
children? If people are so concerned with the life
of the child before it is born, why do they fail to
consider the life of the child after it is born? What
are the chances of an unwanted child becoming an
abused child? Does Matherly condemn the child to
a poor home environment because its mother was
forced to bear it? Everyone has the right to live,
but they don't have the right not to be abused.
The lives of women would be in more danger if
abortion was illegal. Women are not going to stop
having abortions, they will just stop having safe, le
gal abortions. More women will die at the hands of
untrained people who offer women a choice. In
these cases, not only would the unborn child's life
be threatened, but the mother would run the risk
of infection, a punctured uterus and death. Does

Matherly condemn women to death for wanting an
abortion?
Women who have abortions are not unfeeling,
murderous monsters. They sometimes regret
having abortions, but it may be the best thing for
them at the time, either because of financial or
personal reasons. Sexual maturity does not mean
that a person is ready to be a parent, so why force a
13-year-old to carry a child when she is still a child
herself?
Abortions are not only for sexually promiscuous
women, as Matherly sees them, but for any woman
or any couple who is not in a position to care for or
support a child. The issue is not the personhood of
the fetus. The issue is not free choice. The issue is
not where life begins, or where to draw the
line. The issue is what is best for the individual.
True, some pregnancies could have been
prevented. Others could not have been helped.
