## Stanford should stop union-busting

There is a lot of support at Stanford for union
ization — elsewhere. What is happening here,
however, is more like a page out of the book of J.P.
Stevens, commonly recognized as the archetypal
offender against workers' right to organize.
With its indecent eagerness to take advantage of
a legal technicality in order to deny the continued
existence of a union that has been integrated into
the body politic of the institution for I I years and
to destroy it as the bargaining agent that workers
have freely chosen for themselves, the University
has engaged in blatant union-busting.
Union-busting is not an activity becoming to a
university. There are certain implicit values an in
stitution of higher learning stands tor — or is gen
erally expected to stand for. These values are
somehow incompatible with the ugly reality ol a cor
poration such as this that pays $ 1 00.000 a year —
not counting bonuses for dirty work well-done
to several ol its legal staff to help it defeat the or
ganization that includes in its ranks the Univer
sity's least privileged and poorest.
The crime the union stands accused of — and
faces capital punishment by the University lor — is

one of nomenclature and affiliation. Instead of

The working community at Stanford has nothing

their unionized subordinates had achieved.
In 1952, when the office staff organizing drive

so well as to obscure and leave untouched, through
the adjustment of individual cases, the underlying
causes of much discontent. What the administra
