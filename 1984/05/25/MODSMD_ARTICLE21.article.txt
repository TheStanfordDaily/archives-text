# Natural childbirth a family affair at The Birth Place
## 
### KATHLEEN STINCHCOMBE 
Dawn was still two hours
away when Pamela Ekins and
her husband Bernhard Haisch
took the key from its hiding
place and let themselves into the
small, two-bedroom house at
1220 University Drive in Menlo
Park called The Birth Place.
While Haisch telephoned the
doctor, Ekins, a Stanford affili
ated scholar, made herself at
home in what might have been
just a cheery, gold-tinted

The Birth Place talk about making
childbirth natural, they mean nothing
more than allowing a mother to choose
natural labor.

bedroom in suburbia. It was tur
nished with a rocking chair and
an old-fashioned walnut cradle,
and an aqua-flowered comforter
covered the double bed. Well
tended philodendrons cascaded
gracefully over the wrought iron
wall hangers above a dresser
which concealed medical
supplies needed during labor
and delivery .
At dawn, Ekins put a favorite
Bach Sonata on the stereo in the
corner of the room and opened
the double French doors that
led to a small, pleasant garden.
There she and Haisch walked
while she was in labor.
It wasn't long before their
two-year-old daughter Kat
herine, along with her grand
mother, her father and three
birth attendants, witnessed the
birth.
"It was an almost spiritual
feeling â€” a loving, gentle, beau
tiful experience," Ekins said.
"My mother was reliving her
own birth experiences. She had
tears streaming down her face.
They knocked mothers out just
before the birth in those days. I
think she had a sense of having
been cheated."
Courtney Beckwith, a regis
tered nurse at Stanford Univer
sity Hospital, said that she and
her husband chose to have their

baby at The Birth Place because
it offered them "the freedom to
have a natural birth with the ac
companying rituals."
like these couples, many
others are opting to have their
babies the "natural" way. They
are choosing to avoid the regi
mented atmosphere of the typi
cal hospital obstetrical service
with its forbidding stirrups,
anesthesia, shavings and separa
tion of the baby from its mother
soon after birth.

l o us too, it was a question
of control," said Haisch. "I
don't like to surrender control
of a situation to somebody
else."
"We had our first baby in the
hospital," said Ekins, "where
you have to take the physician
who is on call when you come
in."
Haisch said that there was
also a sense of emergency about
the birth of their first child. At
one point during labor they
were told that the baby's heart
had stopped. Elkins was rushed

baby.'

off to the delivery room while
Haisch had to gown up and find
her. As it turned out, the fetal
monitor was malfunctioning.
It was this sense ot panic that
they wished avoid with Taylor's
birth.
"Nothing was left up to an ar

bitrary set ol protocols which
are imposed, not because they
are beneficial medically, but be
cause they minimize the risk of a
lawsuit," said Haisch.
When people involved in such
centers as The Birth Place talk
about making childbirth natural,
they mean nothing more than
allowing a mother to choose
natural labor.
They are talking about dis
pensing with any interference in
the birth process except for
what they feel is needed for
safety amd comfort. They do
not, for example, perform a
routine episiotomy, whereby the
vagina is cut to make more
room for the baby. They don't
depend on an arsenal of equip
ment running from leg straps to
fetal monitoring machinery.
They allow family participation.
They offer classes in nutrition,
natural childbirth and infant
massage. There are also classes
in fetal massage and mother-to
mother support groups.
Labor and delivery, while a
physiological process, presents
potential hazards to both the
mother and fetus before and
after birth as well. On the other
hand, for a woman with a his
tory of normal deliveries who is
motivated and receives good
prenatal care, the probability
that something may go wrong is
less than 10 percent. The set of

criteria for The Birth Place's
pre-screening protocol is strin
gent enough to sort out the risk
population from the approxi
mately 90 percent who can be
expected to give birth without
complication.
To be accepted as a client at

such alternative birth centers, a
women must have no evidence
of hypertension, epilepsy, active
syphilis, tuberculosis, Rh prob
lems, diabetes, heart or kidney
disease. Any previous multiple
birth, pre-eclampsia, abnormal
vaginal bleeding, unusual
presentation of fetus or
Caesarean section would rule
out the client's participation in a
home birth as well. After
meeting this stringent criteria
the mother is required to have a
standard of health above the
normal medical definition. Even
so, complicatons do frequently
occur.
Dana Rosenberg, chief resi
dent of Pediatrics at Stanford
Hospital, said that perhaps the
home birth movement is geared
more toward the parents and
their values and personality
than to the child. "They're im
posing their values and person
ality on a human being who
doesn't have a choice, just for
their selfish, self-centered per
sonal experience," he said.
Rosenberg, whose wife just
had a baby, said. "We chose a
hospital birth because I like the
idea of having the newborn nur
sery right down tht? hall and a
pediatrician available at a mo
ment's notice.
"Birth is a time of great
transition of two bodies,"
Rosenberg continued. "The ris
kiest time of life for the mother
is during childbirth and the first
hour of life is the riskiest time
for a baby. You don't have the

right as an individual not to
have the best possible care
available for your baby. I see
enough non-normal babies
where a mistake in timing cost a
baby his health and even his life.
I may have a warped view be
cause of the disasters that 1 see
come through here. I see the
worst of the worst. 1 think low
risk is not no risk."
Rosenberg gave an example
of a child who was born with a
nuchal cord, when the umbilical
cord is wrapped around the
baby's neck. "Within three
minutes of life we had the um
bilical cord off and within six
minutes of life we had fluids
going into him. At seven
minutes of life he was starting to
look much better. If he had
been out of the hospital that
would have been 15 more
minutes of severe shock and he
might have been in very bad
shape.
"There are other things that
can go wrong with a normal
labor," Rosenberg said. "The
mother could abrupt (placenta
separating from the mother
prematurely) and if you're 15
minutes from the hospital that
could be extremely dangerous."
Haisch admonishes would-be
parents to take responsibility for
themselves and find out as much
as possible about why
procedures have come to be
done the way they are. Then
decide, he says, what kind of
control you are going to sur
render.
