# Forget San Francisco, San Jose's where it's at
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
Heading south on Highway
101 en route to the San Jose
Hea Market, we wondered if
we d ever be able to find the
place since we had only the
laintest outline of directions.
But we were optimistic; the San
Jose Flea Market is the largest
in the world so we figured we'd
see it sooner or later. And we
did.
Well, truthfully, you can't see
the market itself from the

freeway. What you do notice is a
line of cars exiting at the 13th
Street turnoff. The flea market
is in the middle of a rather des
olate part of San Jose; a huge
dirt parking lot has been added
to the substantial paved parking
area to accommodate the many
people who flock there.
Even when the weather is hot

and humid the market is so
crowded that walking can be
difficult. Instead you just get
pushed by the crowds. What is it
that attracts people to the flea
market? A variety of new and
useiJ products, all at supposedly
reduced prices. You can buy
fresh fruits and vegetables,
plants, stereos, telephones, pil
lows and large cushions, Mi
chael Jackson T-shirts, buttons,
wallets and other paraphernalia.

as well as real down-to-earth
junk.
So if you're looking for some
thing to do, or want to make
some purchases for your room
or yourself, try the flea market.
Admission is free and it's fun.
The flea market isn't the only
attraction in the South Bay des
cribed as the largest in the

world. At Marriott's Great
America you can experience the
show Heboid Hawaii, an I MAX
film shown on a screen 70 feet
by 96 feet. As you might imag
ine, this screen is one of the
world's largest indoor motion
picture screens. The size of the
screen, as well as the sound sys
tem, will absorb you into the ac
tion. Six channels surround
\iewers in the auditorium so
that sound originates from the
area of action on the screen,
reinforcing the feeling of being
within the picture. As if that
isn't enough, there are 14
speakers and 12 horns.
Filmmakers mounted
cameras on surfboards,
airplanes and beneath the sea to
take viewers through crashing
waves, into dense rain forests
and deep canyons and to pictur
esque coral reefs. The $2.2 mil
lion Behold Hawaii is perhaps
the most culturally authentic is
land depiction on film.
Two other new shows, a pop
musical revue and the I.ooney
Tunes character comedy have
also been added this season.
Evolution 11 is a multi-media
show utilizing special effects and
24-track sound to look at music
from the 19605, '70s and early
'80s.
Marriott's Great America is
much more than shows. There
are a variety of wild as well as
tame rides in the park. The
latest addition is The Edge, a
free fall ride for the most brave;
you drop 60 feet in 2.5 seconds.
The Demon, a forbidding black
roller coaster, includes two
loops which flip the riders

78 feet off the ground, a
double helix and more ad
ventures to elicit screams and
laughter. And finally, if you
want to get wet, go on the Log
ger's Run.
Besides this wide variety of
rides, there are snack bars and
restaurants, magnificent gar
dens, shops, county fair rides
and games and special events.
To take advantage of Marriott's

Great America, you'll want to
arrive early because between
noon and 5 p.m. the more
popular rides have waits as long
as 45 minutes to over an hour.
At $12.95 for admission, you
don't want to spend your day in
too many long lines. To get to
Marriott's go south on Highway
101 and take the Marriott
Parkway exit.
Having walked around in the

heat and crowds, you're prob
ably ready for a cool refreshing
drink and maybe something to
eat. Just a short drive away is
Chili's at 20060 Stevens Creek
in Cupertino, just three blocks
from Route 85. Once there, you
can order a chocolate
milkshake, or if you're really
thirsty order a soft drink. Refills
are free. If you feel like some
thing alcoholic, try their frozen
margaritas. Served in a chilled
mug. Chili's margaritas are
prepared in an ice cream ma
chine, and they are excellent.
Basically, Chili's is a deal.
They serve good hamburgers
and chili as well as Mexican
food and salads. Their fries —

fresh and hand cut daily — cost
$1 for a large basket and most
hamburgers cost under $3.50.
Two people can fill themselves
up and pay $10. Yet it's more
than the affordable prices that
attract large crowds to this res
taurant. Chili's is probably the
only restaurant outside of Palo
Alto where I've seen as many as
six other Stanford students.
Great food at a reasonable cost
. . . let's face it. That's a better
deal than Food Service by a long
shot and next October when
Chili's opens in Menlo Park, it
will be an even more attractive
dining experience.

thing alcoholic, try their frozen
margaritas. Served in a chilled
mug. Chili's margaritas are
prepared in an ice cream ma
chine, and they are excellent.
Basically, Chili's is a deal.
They serve good hamburgers
and chili as well as Mexican
food and salads. Their fries —

fresh and hand cut daily — cost
$1 for a large basket and most
hamburgers cost under $3.50.
Two people can fill themselves
up and pay $10. Yet it's more
than the affordable prices that
attract large crowds to this res
taurant. Chili's is probably the
only restaurant outside of Palo
Alto where I've seen as many as
six other Stanford students.
Great food at a reasonable cost
. . . let's face it. That's a better
deal than Food Service by a long
shot and next October when
Chili's opens in Menlo Park, it
will be an even more attractive
dining experience.



The Demon: A forbidding black rollercoaster


The Carousel: Two tiers of fun
Heading south on Highway
101 en route to the San Jose
Hea Market, we wondered if
we d ever be able to find the
place since we had only the
laintest outline of directions.
But we were optimistic; the San
Jose Flea Market is the largest
in the world so we figured we'd
see it sooner or later. And we
did.
Well, truthfully, you can't see
the market itself from the

freeway. What you do notice is a
line of cars exiting at the 13th
Street turnoff. The flea market
is in the middle of a rather des
olate part of San Jose; a huge
dirt parking lot has been added
to the substantial paved parking
area to accommodate the many
people who flock there.
Even when the weather is hot

and humid the market is so
crowded that walking can be
difficult. Instead you just get
pushed by the crowds. What is it
that attracts people to the flea
market? A variety of new and
useiJ products, all at supposedly
reduced prices. You can buy
fresh fruits and vegetables,
plants, stereos, telephones, pil
lows and large cushions, Mi
chael Jackson T-shirts, buttons,
wallets and other paraphernalia.

as well as real down-to-earth
junk.
So if you're looking for some
thing to do, or want to make
some purchases for your room
or yourself, try the flea market.
Admission is free and it's fun.
The flea market isn't the only
attraction in the South Bay des
cribed as the largest in the

world. At Marriott's Great
America you can experience the
show Heboid Hawaii, an I MAX
film shown on a screen 70 feet
by 96 feet. As you might imag
ine, this screen is one of the
world's largest indoor motion
picture screens. The size of the
screen, as well as the sound sys
tem, will absorb you into the ac
tion. Six channels surround
\iewers in the auditorium so
that sound originates from the
area of action on the screen,
reinforcing the feeling of being
within the picture. As if that
isn't enough, there are 14
speakers and 12 horns.
Filmmakers mounted
cameras on surfboards,
airplanes and beneath the sea to
take viewers through crashing
waves, into dense rain forests
and deep canyons and to pictur
esque coral reefs. The $2.2 mil
lion Behold Hawaii is perhaps
the most culturally authentic is
land depiction on film.
Two other new shows, a pop
musical revue and the I.ooney
Tunes character comedy have
also been added this season.
Evolution 11 is a multi-media
show utilizing special effects and
24-track sound to look at music
from the 19605, '70s and early
'80s.
Marriott's Great America is
much more than shows. There
are a variety of wild as well as
tame rides in the park. The
latest addition is The Edge, a
free fall ride for the most brave;
you drop 60 feet in 2.5 seconds.
The Demon, a forbidding black
roller coaster, includes two
loops which flip the riders

78 feet off the ground, a
double helix and more ad
ventures to elicit screams and
laughter. And finally, if you
want to get wet, go on the Log
ger's Run.
Besides this wide variety of
rides, there are snack bars and
restaurants, magnificent gar
dens, shops, county fair rides
and games and special events.
To take advantage of Marriott's

Great America, you'll want to
arrive early because between
noon and 5 p.m. the more
popular rides have waits as long
as 45 minutes to over an hour.
At $12.95 for admission, you
don't want to spend your day in
too many long lines. To get to
Marriott's go south on Highway
101 and take the Marriott
Parkway exit.
Having walked around in the

heat and crowds, you're prob
ably ready for a cool refreshing
drink and maybe something to
eat. Just a short drive away is
Chili's at 20060 Stevens Creek
in Cupertino, just three blocks
from Route 85. Once there, you
can order a chocolate
milkshake, or if you're really
thirsty order a soft drink. Refills
are free. If you feel like some
thing alcoholic, try their frozen
margaritas. Served in a chilled
mug. Chili's margaritas are
prepared in an ice cream ma
chine, and they are excellent.
