## ASU is team to beat, but Card can't look over Rainbows 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sports writer 
The last thing the University
of Hawaii baseball team saw of
Stanford was the Cardinal's col
lective tails when Stanford raced
to the airport after the 10th in
ning of a 13-13 tie was com
pleted. leaving the hosts
dumbfounded as they took the
field in the 11th.
Well, Stanford made it back
to the mainland safely and today
at 3 p.m. these two teams will
pick up where they left off in the
first game of the 1984 NCAA

West II Regionals at Arizona
State University.
Hawaii, however, may not
recognize the current Stanford
club that finished its season with
a 36-24-1 record . When the
Card left the paradise of the
Pacific in February its record
was a mediocre 11-10-1.
But a late-season rush in
which Stanford's 11-4 second
half record was the best in the
Pacific-10 Conference Southern
Division sealed the Cardinal's
fourth consecutive NCAA ap
pearance and rocketed Stanford
to its present No. 15 national
ranking.
In fact. Stanford will be gun
ning for its third straight ap
pearance in the College World
Series in Omaha. Neb. To do so
the Card will not only have to
squeak by the No. 8-ranked
Hawaii Rainbow Warriors, but
also the nation's top ranked
team. Arizona State. Rounding
out the West II Regional, one of
eight double-elimination tour
neys being played around the

nation this weekend, is the Pac
-10 Northern Division winner
Washington State.
The latter two clubs meet in
the nightcap of today's double
header. The winner of each
regional advances to the College
World Series which will deter
mine the NCAA baseball cham
pion. (The chart, below, il
lustrates the manner in which
the West II Regional will
proceed.)
"1 think the (regional) we're
in is pretty darn tough," Stan
ford Head Coach Mark

Marquess theorized earlier this
week. "With the No. 1 team in
the country playing at home in
front of 8000 rabid fans, that's
not too shabby."
Indeed. Arizona State is a
heavy favorite to move on to
Omaha. The Sun Devils breezed
to the "Six-Pac" crown while
compiling a 50-18 mark. 36-10
at home in Packard Stadium.
The offensive catalyst for the
Devils is "Six-Pac" co-Player of
the year Oddibe McDowell,
who hit a league best .405 with
22 home runs and 69 runs
batted in. In all, McDowell led
the league in five offensive
categories.
Unfortunately, the parade of
stars does not stop with
McDowell. Designated hitter
Todd Brown (.369, 15 home
runs. 69 RBIs) and outfielder
Barry Bonds (.349, 1 1 HRs, 48
RBIs) joined McDowell on the
league's all-star squad.
And pitching? First there is
all-Pac-10 selection Dave
Graybill. who chalked up eight

victories without tasting defeat.
He also carries a 3.05 earned
run average and 11 saves into
the playoffs. Doug Henry (10-2,
3.31 ERA) and Kendall Carter
(10-1. 3.53 ERA) will also see
action on the mound for ASU.
"They're not No. 1 for noth
ing," Marquess aptly noted.
But if recent performance is
an indication, it is Marquess'
team who can top ASU. "We
took two out three from them in

their place (three weeks ago) so
we know we can heat them,"
Marquess responded. "If I
didn't think we could beat them
we wouldn't go down there."
Yet Marquess says "we'll take
one at a time" and the first one
is Hawaii. The Stanford skipper
compares the Rainbows with
the Cardinal, saying "1 think
you can look for a scrappy team.
They normally don't hit with a
lot of power."

Hawaii took the Western
Athletic Conference champion
ship with a 48-19-1 season slate,
good enough to outdistance
runner-up San Diego State.
Two of those wins, as well as a
loss and a tie, came in the
aforementioned series with
Stanford.
"We weren't playing any
where near as well as we are
now," countered Marquess.
"And,"he added, "I'd much

rather play them away from
(Hawaii)."
Outfielder Charles Jackson,
who led the club with a .399
average and 73 RBIs, brightens
the Rainbow offense. He is
joined in the outfield by Mario
Monico (.394). Infielder Peter
Ho (.382) rounds out the bat
ting leaders.
Stanford's all-conference
pitcher John Radtke will prob
ably receive the call to stop

Hawaii this afternoon. The
Rainbows were wiped out the
first time they faced Radtke.
losing 6-2. But Hawaii was not
alone in that category as the
senior right hander earned an N
-2 record with a league leading
2.55 ERA. Radtke also hurled
four complete games.
Hawaii could counter with
any of three pitchers. Mike
Campbell (10-5. 2.36 ERA),
southpaw Joel l.ono (10-1. 2
ERA) or Greg Burlingame (5-
I. 3.61 ERA)
The pitching depth exhibited
by the Rainbows and AS I.
could be a significant advantage
in a tournament that could force
a team to play five games in lour
days. The Card has lefty Jeff
Ballard (7-5. 4.79 ERA) in ad
dition to Radtke. and while Bal
lard's five complete games and
N2 strikeouts were second best
in the"Six-Pac," he is the last of
Stanford's consistent hilltup
pers.
"Normally what happens is
the team that wins it. wins it in
three straight." said Marquess,
who will rely on Kevin kunkel
and Rob Wassenaar after the
first two games.
In terms of run production,
the Cardinal would like to
repeat the results of its last visit
to Tempe when it racked up 2h
runs in three games. The key
cog in that series was
rightfielder Walt Harris, who
went 7-for-13 with two game
winning RBIs. Over the last
nine games, Harris has ripped
opposing pitchers to the tune ol
.447, raising his average to .327
in the process.
Oh yes, there is always a dark
horse in these tournaments. In
this case it is Washington State.
The Cougars are the latest
"Nor-Pac" entrant that will
receive very little respect from
everyone. "Nor-Pac" teams
have a history ot getting blown
out in the NCAA tournament.
WSU does have Northern
Division Player of the Year
John Skurla. He hit .353 with
nine home runs and drove in 4<S
runs this year. Dwayne Lalor hit
.354 and pitcher Mike Costello
was 9-1 with a 1.47 ERA, but
the Cougars still won't get much
respect.



If the Cardinal doesn't want to get left standing around, Jeff
Ballard (left) and John Radtke are going to have to provide
the 1-2 punch from the mound. Radtke will probably open

Rod Searcey/Daily
today and Ballard will go tomorrow, but after them there are
some question marks on the Cardinal pitching staff.

was a mediocre 11-10-1.
But a late-season rush in
which Stanford's 11-4 second
half record was the best in the
Pacific-10 Conference Southern
Division sealed the Cardinal's
fourth consecutive NCAA ap
pearance and rocketed Stanford
to its present No. 15 national
ranking.
In fact. Stanford will be gun
ning for its third straight ap
pearance in the College World
Series in Omaha. Neb. To do so
the Card will not only have to
squeak by the No. 8-ranked
Hawaii Rainbow Warriors, but
also the nation's top ranked
team. Arizona State. Rounding
out the West II Regional, one of
eight double-elimination tour
neys being played around the

nation this weekend, is the Pac
-10 Northern Division winner
Washington State.
The latter two clubs meet in
the nightcap of today's double
header. The winner of each
regional advances to the College
World Series which will deter
mine the NCAA baseball cham
pion. (The chart, below, il
lustrates the manner in which
the West II Regional will
proceed.)
"1 think the (regional) we're
in is pretty darn tough," Stan
ford Head Coach Mark

Marquess theorized earlier this
week. "With the No. 1 team in
the country playing at home in
front of 8000 rabid fans, that's
not too shabby."
Indeed. Arizona State is a
heavy favorite to move on to
Omaha. The Sun Devils breezed
to the "Six-Pac" crown while
compiling a 50-18 mark. 36-10
at home in Packard Stadium.
The offensive catalyst for the
Devils is "Six-Pac" co-Player of
the year Oddibe McDowell,
who hit a league best .405 with
22 home runs and 69 runs
batted in. In all, McDowell led
the league in five offensive
categories.
Unfortunately, the parade of
stars does not stop with
McDowell. Designated hitter
Todd Brown (.369, 15 home
runs. 69 RBIs) and outfielder
Barry Bonds (.349, 1 1 HRs, 48
RBIs) joined McDowell on the
league's all-star squad.
And pitching? First there is
all-Pac-10 selection Dave
Graybill. who chalked up eight

victories without tasting defeat.
He also carries a 3.05 earned
run average and 11 saves into
the playoffs. Doug Henry (10-2,
3.31 ERA) and Kendall Carter
(10-1. 3.53 ERA) will also see
action on the mound for ASU.
"They're not No. 1 for noth
ing," Marquess aptly noted.
But if recent performance is
an indication, it is Marquess'
team who can top ASU. "We
took two out three from them in

their place (three weeks ago) so
we know we can heat them,"
Marquess responded. "If I
didn't think we could beat them
we wouldn't go down there."
Yet Marquess says "we'll take
one at a time" and the first one
is Hawaii. The Stanford skipper
compares the Rainbows with
the Cardinal, saying "1 think
you can look for a scrappy team.
They normally don't hit with a
lot of power."

Hawaii took the Western
Athletic Conference champion
ship with a 48-19-1 season slate,
good enough to outdistance
runner-up San Diego State.
Two of those wins, as well as a
loss and a tie, came in the
aforementioned series with
Stanford.
"We weren't playing any
where near as well as we are
now," countered Marquess.
"And,"he added, "I'd much

rather play them away from
(Hawaii)."
Outfielder Charles Jackson,
who led the club with a .399
average and 73 RBIs, brightens
the Rainbow offense. He is
joined in the outfield by Mario
Monico (.394). Infielder Peter
Ho (.382) rounds out the bat
ting leaders.
Stanford's all-conference
pitcher John Radtke will prob
ably receive the call to stop

Hawaii this afternoon. The
Rainbows were wiped out the
first time they faced Radtke.
losing 6-2. But Hawaii was not
alone in that category as the
senior right hander earned an N
-2 record with a league leading
2.55 ERA. Radtke also hurled
four complete games.
Hawaii could counter with
any of three pitchers. Mike
Campbell (10-5. 2.36 ERA),
southpaw Joel l.ono (10-1. 2
ERA) or Greg Burlingame (5-
I. 3.61 ERA)
The pitching depth exhibited
by the Rainbows and AS I.
could be a significant advantage
in a tournament that could force
a team to play five games in lour
days. The Card has lefty Jeff
Ballard (7-5. 4.79 ERA) in ad
dition to Radtke. and while Bal
lard's five complete games and
N2 strikeouts were second best
in the"Six-Pac," he is the last of
Stanford's consistent hilltup
pers.
"Normally what happens is
the team that wins it. wins it in
three straight." said Marquess,
who will rely on Kevin kunkel
and Rob Wassenaar after the
first two games.
In terms of run production,
the Cardinal would like to
repeat the results of its last visit
to Tempe when it racked up 2h
runs in three games. The key
cog in that series was
rightfielder Walt Harris, who
went 7-for-13 with two game
winning RBIs. Over the last
nine games, Harris has ripped
opposing pitchers to the tune ol
.447, raising his average to .327
in the process.
Oh yes, there is always a dark
horse in these tournaments. In
this case it is Washington State.
The Cougars are the latest
"Nor-Pac" entrant that will
receive very little respect from
everyone. "Nor-Pac" teams
have a history ot getting blown
out in the NCAA tournament.
WSU does have Northern
Division Player of the Year
John Skurla. He hit .353 with
nine home runs and drove in 4<S
runs this year. Dwayne Lalor hit
.354 and pitcher Mike Costello
was 9-1 with a 1.47 ERA, but
the Cougars still won't get much
respect.



If the Cardinal doesn't want to get left standing around, Jeff
Ballard (left) and John Radtke are going to have to provide
the 1-2 punch from the mound. Radtke will probably open

Rod Searcey/Daily
today and Ballard will go tomorrow, but after them there are
some question marks on the Cardinal pitching staff.
The last thing the University
of Hawaii baseball team saw of
Stanford was the Cardinal's col
lective tails when Stanford raced
to the airport after the 10th in
ning of a 13-13 tie was com
pleted. leaving the hosts
dumbfounded as they took the
field in the 11th.
Well, Stanford made it back
to the mainland safely and today
at 3 p.m. these two teams will
pick up where they left off in the
first game of the 1984 NCAA

West II Regionals at Arizona
State University.
Hawaii, however, may not
recognize the current Stanford
club that finished its season with
a 36-24-1 record . When the
Card left the paradise of the
Pacific in February its record
was a mediocre 11-10-1.
