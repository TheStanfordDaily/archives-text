# Card golfers shoot well but can't move up much
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
I he Stanford men s goll team, despite playing
perhaps the best golf it has played all year,
remains deep in the lower reaches of the NCAA
lournament standings alter yesterday's second
round.
The Cardinal moved up from 26th place to 25th
by virtue ot a fine team round ot 292. Combined
with Wednesday's score of 300, this leaves the
team at 592, 23 strokes behind defending cham
pion Oklahoma State.
It also leaves Stanford with a poor chance of
making the cut after today's 18 holes. The field
will be sliced to 1 5 teams out of the 32 currently in
competition, and the Cardinal men will have to
play even farther above their heads than they did
today il they are to stay in the running.
Junior Scott Erickson, having apparently solved
the putting problems he has struggled with for the
latter part of the season, scorched Houston with a
69 yesterday — easily the best round he has had
all spring. He now has a two-day total of 143,
leaving him in 27th place overall, 10 strokes be
hind leader John Inman of North Carolina.

Sophomore Don Walsworth continued his tor
rid tournament hitting, tiring a one-under-pur 71,
which puts him at 145 overall. The Cardinal
seniors again failed to come through, however.
Lanny Sawchuck shot a 73 for 150, Doug
Thompson swung to a 75 to match Sawchuck,
while team leader Tim Robinson brought up the
rear for a second day, shooting a 77 for 156.
Before leaving for the NCAA Tournament,
Erickson indicated that his game was beginning to
come around. "Any week I feel that Tim
(Robinson) or I can shoot well enough to win a
tournament," stated Erickson.
Robinson and Erickson have been the players
on whom Coach Tim Schaaf has counted all year to
lead the team, both men having been the No. I
golfer at various times in the season. Robinson
has carried a particularly large part of the load this
spring — he led Stanford in scoring in four out of
its last six tournaments — and so his poor play in
Houston is all the more baffling.
Yesterday's NCAA women's results were not
available.

The Cardinal shot an even better round yesterday than the day before, but still couldn't dig
its way out of its opening-day trap, finishing the day in 25th place.
