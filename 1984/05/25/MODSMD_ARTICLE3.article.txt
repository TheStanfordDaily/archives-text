# USW members blast University
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
Carrying signs reading "Warning: Stanford
management is a hazard to organized labor,"
"We're here to stay" and "Send Kennedy and
Wheeler to Poland," approximately 250 people
turned out yesterday to support United Stanford
Workers (USW) at a solidarity rally in White
Plaza.
Afterward, most marched to the Encina Hall of
fice of William Massy, University vice president of
Business and Finance.
USW President Linda Crouse called Stanford
the "J.P. Stevens of higher education" at the
noontime rally, and accused University President
Donald Kennedy of hypocritically supporting the
union in Poland while at the same time doing his
best to destroy union representation at Stanford.
Crouse asked for community support in fighting
the University. "You've read about J.P. Stevens,
you've seen union movies like Norma fyae, you've
seen Solidarity on TV every night4~WeU my
message to you ... is solidarity is here, right in
your own backyard."
The hour-long rally was a response to the Uni
versity's May 8 cutoff of dues collection from em
ployee paychecks. The University claims there has
been no union at Stanford since Local 715
withdrew representation in early February.
Raymond Giraud, professor of French and Ital
ian, called collective bargaining here "an absolute
necessity" because of Stanford's size and structure.
"Whether we like it or not, universities like
Stanford are very big business, structured on the
model of their counterparts in the corporate
world," he said.
Tim Twomey, vice-president of Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) — USWs
international affiliate — said the issue was union
control and called Kennedy a "czar" and a
"dictator."
"The union belongs to the workers," he said.
Twomey denounced Stanford's treatment of
Local 680, saying that "workers have a right to or
ganize, to bargain collectively through their own

chosen representatives."
"You went through an election, you elected new
officers, you decided to disaffiliate with Local 715,
you formed Local 6KO, you have done it constitu
tionally, you have done it by law, and bv God the
University ought to recognize your right," he said.
Richard Holober, executive secretary of the San
Mateo Central Labor Council, said there are
50,000 AFL-CIO members in San Mateo County
supporting USW. "It's your fight but it's also our
fight," he said. "We'll be sticking with you, so hang
in there."
Also speaking at the rally were Keith Archuleta,
program coordinator at Tresidder Union and resi
dent fellow at Mirrielees, and Francisca James-
Hernandez, a representative of El Centro Chicano.
After the speakers had finished in White Plaza.
Crouse led about 170 supporters in a march on
Massy's office in Encina Hall. Once there, the ban
ner- and sign-bearing protesters began a chant of
"We want Massy."
Massy did not appear.
Before the rally dispersed, Crouse claimed USW
is still the legal representative of the Stanford bar
gaining unit. "We have a union, we have a con
tract." she said.
"We put this union here with a democratic vote.
It's staying with a democratic vote. There's not a
damn thing Kennedy can do about it," she added.
In a telephone interview yesterday afternoon.
Massy said he was aware of the rally and march but
that the University position would not change.
"Our position is clear. We seriously doubt the ex
ercise they went through (the April 18 referendum
election) was a legitimate disaffiliation election."
he said. "I understand they don't agree, and I
respect their disagreement."
Mary Ann Tenuto, labor consultant for USW.
said the union was collecting dues directly from its
members in response to Stanford's refusal to
deduct dues from employee paychecks. Tenuto
said bargaining unit members were coming to the
union office to pay dues, that they were turning
dues money over to shop stewards and they were

paying at tables set up especially for dues collec
tion.
Tenuto claimed turnout to pay dues was high
and the union would have no problem functioning
until the University once again started collecting
and forwarding dues.
"We feel we'll be doing really well if three
fourths of the people (about 900-1000 bargaining
unit members) pay." she said.
Tenuto accused the University of attempting to
weaken union morale. But she said the attempt
was having the opposite effect. "I really think that
the University is going to end up pulling us to
gether," she said.

"We want Massy."
Massy did not appear.
Before the rally dispersed, Crouse claimed USW
is still the legal representative of the Stanford bar
gaining unit. "We have a union, we have a con
tract." she said.
"We put this union here with a democratic vote.
It's staying with a democratic vote. There's not a
damn thing Kennedy can do about it," she added.
In a telephone interview yesterday afternoon.
Massy said he was aware of the rally and march but
that the University position would not change.
"Our position is clear. We seriously doubt the ex
ercise they went through (the April 18 referendum
election) was a legitimate disaffiliation election."
he said. "I understand they don't agree, and I
respect their disagreement."
Mary Ann Tenuto, labor consultant for USW.
said the union was collecting dues directly from its
members in response to Stanford's refusal to
deduct dues from employee paychecks. Tenuto
said bargaining unit members were coming to the
union office to pay dues, that they were turning
dues money over to shop stewards and they were

paying at tables set up especially for dues collec
tion.
Tenuto claimed turnout to pay dues was high
and the union would have no problem functioning
until the University once again started collecting
and forwarding dues.
"We feel we'll be doing really well if three
fourths of the people (about 900-1000 bargaining
unit members) pay." she said.
Tenuto accused the University of attempting to
weaken union morale. But she said the attempt
was having the opposite effect. "I really think that
the University is going to end up pulling us to
gether," she said.
