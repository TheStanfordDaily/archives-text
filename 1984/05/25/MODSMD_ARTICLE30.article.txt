## 'Heretics of Dune' re-establishes series' quality 
### Heretics of Dune" By Frank Herbert Putnam, $16.95, 480 pp JOSEPH LEW 
With the appearance ot "Hereticsof
Dune." Frank Herbert has re
emerged as a potent force in the realm
ol science fiction. "Heretics," the fifth
in the "Dune" series, carries this cos
mic story into the previously uni
magined future.
When "Dune" was published 20
years ago. it received almost every im
aginable science fiction honor and
spawned countless imitations. It's in
fluence can still be traced upon the
writing of such prominent writers as
LeGuin and Spielberg. It conceived
of, and successfully created, a univ erse
that was oddlv familiar to history
buffs, weaving K gether and yet subtly
transforming strands of European and
Arabian history and Jewish mysticism.
Each installment can be read by it
self — lack ot familiarity with the ser
ies shouldn't discourage anyone from
reading "Heretics." Indeed, charac
ters sometimes too pointedly remind
each other of significant events that
had been described in earlier works.
But the series deserves to be read —
and judged — as a whole.
"Dune," the first and most im
aginatively exuberant of the series
(the movie will be playing in local
theaters this summer), perhaps un
fairly overshadows the other novels. It
did, after all, create the fascinating
structure of this universe — a thing
which could only be done, effectively,
once. The action begins in the distant
future, at the apparent height of a
galactic empire which has already
endured 100,000 years. This empire
has weathered major crises like the
Butlerian Jihad ( a "holy war" which
led to the banning of artificial intelli
gence and to the development of Men
tats, or human thinking machines),
and a technology which has made
"atomics" impractical, re-introducing
advanced methods of hand-to-hand
conflict.
Politically, the empire resembles
some strange cross between feudal
Europe and seventh-century Arabia.
Fiefs — the landed estates of major
families — consist of entire planets,
subject to barter with, or capture by,
rival families. The Atreides (who trace
their ancestry to the mythological
Greek family of the same name) and
the Harkonnens (who embody every
thing evil and decadent) are the most
powerful and explosively hostile
families — with the exception ot the
Imperial family itself.
The Lady Jessica Atreides, wife of
the reigning Duke and unac
knowledged daughter of the Baron

Harkonnen. links these two families
not only with each other, but also with
the Bene Gesserit, a powerful
witchlike sisterhood which manip
ulates almost everything in this galaxy
— including religion — in order to fur
ther its breeding program. The Sister
hood hope to produce the Kwisatz
Haderach. a sort of secular Messiah.
Jessica is "ordered" to have
l.eto Atieides* daughter (the Bene
Gesserit training gives members al
most total control over all bodily func
tions), who will in turn be bred with
the Imperial family to produce the
Kwisatz Haderach.
Jessica's disobedience — her willful
conception of a male child in the hope

of producing the Messiah a generation
early — sparks a series of bloody
skirmishes which lead to the
Atreides' exile on the desert planet
Arrakis (Dune). Leto is killed there,
hut Jessica and her son escape from
the weather-sheltered capital city,
joining the Arab-like Fremen of the
desert. Here, Paul learns to ride the
giant sandworms (who produce
melange — spice — an addictive sub
stance which endows select humans
with prescience, and which allows a
few of the Bene Gesserit to become
Reverend Mothers in touch with the
memories of all their female ances
tors), and organizes an underground
resistance movement.

"Dune Messiah" describes Paul's
(now called Muad-Dib) deification by
his Fremen followers and his partial
victory over the Harkonnens. The
Fremen overrun the Empire in a new
"jihad." Paul Muad-Dib, in spice
inspired ecstacy, sees a mysterious
Golden Path for mankind, but rejects
it, for the personal consequences are
too horrifying. He is assassinated,
leaving behind a wife and twin
children, a boy and a girl.
"Children of Dune" is perhaps the
least aptly titled and executed segment
of the series, concentrating, as it does,
upon the boy child Leto. Leto sees and
accepts the Golden Path — which in
volves his strange symbiosis with, and

eventual metamorphosis into, a
sandworm. I Ik- Harkonncns are li
nall\ deleatcd. and Leto li s political
power is cemented bv the marriage ol
his sister with the emperor's son.
l or more than a decade. Herbert
did not publish am thing more relating
to the Dune saga. In a sense, it was
complete. He had prestigious prece
dents I or keeping it a trilogv —
lolkicns "I.ord of The Rings" and
Asimov's "Foundation" series (which
has only recently been continued in
"Foundation's Edge.") Then "God
Emperor ot Dune" appeared, and the
rules, in more ways than one. were
changed.
Almost 5000 years have passed.
Dune/Arrakis has been transformed
into a garden, with only a tiny desert
preserved for "historic" reasons, l.eto
II is still alive, monstrously. His bodv
is huge and segmented: his arms and
hands are useless, flipper-like ap
pendages : his still-human face peers
tinily out from a transparent cowl of
wormskin.
Humanity groans under the tyranny
ot Leto's enforced peace. The Bene
Gesserit are secretly allied with two
quasi-independent parodies of them
selves: The technologically advanced
Ix, and rhe Tleilaxu, who are capable
ot reproducing an individual from the
cells of his corpse — a grisly form of
cloning. No one knows that Leto has
foreseen this. Part of his Golden Path
involves the souring of the universal
human longing for a Golden Age. for
tranquilitv-forever sunset. Part in
volves his own "death by water," the
transformation of his worm body intt
myriads of sand trout which will trap
Arrakis' water, re-forming the great
deserts and. eventually, more worms.
Part involves breeding unpredicta
bility back into humanity — producing
people "invisible" to prescience. In
the power vacuum which follow's
Leto's death, Siona (the beautiful
"product" of his breeding program)
and Duncan Idaho (the clone of a ser
vant of the original Leto), lead millions
in The Scattering, a sudden expansion
of mankind into previously unex
plored galaxies.
When "Heretics of Dune" opens,
thousands of years have again passed.
Worms — each containing a "pearl"
of the God Emperor's consciousness
locked in an eternal dream — again
rule the deserts. The Tleilaxu are
ready to culminate a millenia-long plot
to "convert" humanity in their own
ant-like society. The People of The
Scattering suddenly begin to return,
bringing their own parody of the Bene
Gesserit. They are ruled by
"Honoured Maters" (obviously a

form of "Reverend Mother"), who
have established a sexual tyranny.
Into this already bubbling stew
enters the child Sheeana. whose very
name is a descendent of Siona — as a
character points out in case the reader
hadn't noticed. Sheeana
"accidentally" revives the ancient
Fremen art of worm riding, and is able
to commuinicate with the "pearls of
consciousness" inside the worms. She
quickly becomes the center of a new
Fremen cult, which even the Bene
Gesserit do not fully understand.
Standing between all these forces
and cosmic disaster are — you guessed
it — the Bene Gesserit. led by the
mysterious Reverend Mother Tara/a.
The reader, entering the minds of
other characters, gradually unravels
the meaning and goals of all these
forces, but Tara/a remains opaque.
She rev eals portions of her plan to her
"tools." but these pieces cannot be
made to cohere in any logical pattern.
"Heretics" is a kind of cosmic
detective story, which kept this reader,
at least, guessing until the final climac
tic pages.
Herbert's mind is akin to that which
created Star Wars, but less adept at
sustaining imaginative flights. The
characters of "Dune" are as decisively
drawn as Luke Skywalker and Darth
Vader, while Herbert's subtle
probings of free will and predestina
tion, as well as father-daughter and
mother-son relationships, go far
beyond anything that Lucas and Speil
berg have yet attempted. Lady Jessica
and the Bene Gesserit rival the Jedi.
and passages like the Litany against
Fear ("I will let my fear wash over
me") are reembroiderings of the
fabric of his universe. But he allowed
"Messiah" and "Children" to
degenerate into pulp.
By millenium-hopping. Herbert
changes all that. In "Heretics" the
God Emperor has been
"transformed" into what lie deserves
to be: Myth. Herbert resoundingly
returns to a purely human universe —
for, despite all their quirkiness, the
Honoured Maters and the Tleilaxu
embody recognizably human ten
dencies: hedonism and the herd
instinct.
Herbert's message, in both "God
Emperor" and "Heretics," is simple:
Golden Ages never, and should not,
exist. Predictability leads not merely
to boredom, but to imaginative and
physical death. And if you find the
final pages of "Heretics" less satisfy
ing than the conclusion o! Return of
the Jedi, perhaps it is because this se<? a
tion of the saga is not yet complete.


Frank Herbert's "Dune" series, begun back in the early days of contemporary science fiction, retains its
freshness today.
