Henry Adams, whose spirit
presides over Alfred Kazin's
loving appraisal ot America's
literary coming-of-agc, des
cribed his struggle to find
meaning in the chaotic 19th
century as an attempt "to fix for
a moment a necessary sequence
of human movement." Here lies
the principle behind Kazin's
method in this study of Ameri
can literature in its "crucial cen
tury," IK3O-1930. While his
title comes from Whitman, the
"process" in Kazin's
"Procession" owes its explana
tion to Adams.
Adams may seem like an in
truder in this field of American
literary luminaries that begins,
of necessity, with Ralph Waldo
Emerson, whose "Nature,"
published in 1X36, marked the
beginning of serious American
literature. The study continues
through a rather predictable
company of Thoreau, Haw
thorne, Poe, Whitman, Melville,
Dickinson, Twain, James,
Howclls, Dreiser and Crane. It
ends with Pound, Eliot,
Faulkner, Hemingway, Dos
Passos and Fitzgerald — all
weary chroniclers of post-World
War I disillusion. Nevertheless,
because Adams' life spanned
the century (he lived from IS3S
until 19IS), and because he was
an attentive and well-placed ob
server of America's meteoric

rise to power, he and his book,
"The Education ot Henry
Adams." give Kazin's study its
shape.
Adams wrote the
"Education" in his old age. and
called it "a study in twentieth
century multiplicity." Consider
ing himself a child of the 1 Sth
century ill-equipped to lace the
2()th, Adams the historian tells
ot his anguished attempts to dis
cover order in history, to ex
plain the tremendous forces that
arose and fragmented the world
in his lifetime. His "dynamic
theory of history" makes history
a process which includes those
mysterious forces represented in
the "dynamo" — a huge
generator that Adams saw at the
great Chicago Exposition of
1N93. Kazin, also from the per
spective of the end of his career,
has written a dynamic theory of
American literary history, one
which also focuses its learned
attention on the tremendous up
heaval ol 19th-century in
dustrialism, and attempts to
locate the moment when Amer
ican letters became "modern."
Kazin's manifest organizing
principle is the well-worked
theme of the American artist as
"isolato," the lone creative
mind trusting itself above all
else — as Emerson commanded
and making literature despite
his lack of contact with culture.
But isolation in this case doesn't
imply self-pity; "self-reliance"
leads in these writers to a
boundless egotism that affects
even mild Emerson himself. The
dynamos in this theory of his
tory are the forceful per
sonalities of the writers as they
struggled to make themselves
heard in a country preoccupied
with growth and power, not art.
Through the writers he selects,
and the biographical facts he
chooses to present, the progress
of American literature becomes
a "necessary sequence" of
selves whose unhappy isolation
breeds the overblown egos that
make possible their art. Like
Thoreau's chanticleer, the

American writer lustily crows
his early morning existence to a
sleeping nation.
Alfred Kazin, who will he 69
years old this year, began
writing book reviews for Ameri
can periodicals when he was 19
years old. In 1942, he published
his justly famous study of
American literature in the
modern period, "On Native
Grounds," which has become a
classic among historical ac
counts of the rise of literary art.
Kazin has lived his life as a man

of letters in the broad and
popular sense, and his new book
reflects the freedom of mind
that has made his literary
studies and personal narratives
so accessible and enjoyable. In
it.he returns to his first book's
field and revises some opinions
and focuses even more closely
and from a longer perspective,
on how the optimism ot the
early 19th century became the
disillusion of the early 20th.
The book has an appropriate
air of reassessment about it, of a

critic taking up one by one and
examining the preoccupations
of his half-century long career
and fitting them into a meaning
ful sequence. I.ike Adams,
Ka/in goes directly to the most
important figures of the period
to discover how they fed each
other's ambition, how they as
similated social change, in
search of the necessity in the
evolution. The aging critic often
looks at these writers, some of
whom he has known personally
and all of whom he has lived

with in one way or another for a
long time, as they themselves
aged and came to terms with
age.
But this sense of summing up
(and of seeing the characters in
the procession as they sum
themselves arid each other up)
yields more fond attention than
a sense of loss. Kazin writes,
despite his age. like a man to
whom these very familiar hooks
and authors still speak wonders.
He is a product of an era and
school of criticism that focused
attention on books and authors
and not on themselves, and
kazin makes us see and feel the
cataclysm of history in the age
when American literature
sought and found its voice. "On
Native Grounds," a product ol
Kazin's late 2()s, had suggested
that American literature to that
point was in some sense a fail
ure; hut here, going over much
the same territory, he finds a
heroism and current relevance
in its struggle. He refuses to let
us see this literary age as remote
and often establishes the con
nection between our conscious
ness and theirs, history then and
history now.
Kazin's method is largely bio
graphical. although his long ac
quaintance with the lives of
these authors makes the study
somewhat impressionistic as lie
assumes a basic familiarity in his
readers — of his own previous
books if nothing else. The per
sonal portraits we get here,
depressing though they
sometimes are, are only part of
the pleasure. Like Adams'
"Education." "An American
Procession" is organized around
major historical events — the
Civil War, the economic panic
of 1893-94, the Chicago Ex
position and finally, the great
spiritual crisis of the modern
writers. World War I. Cities like
New York and Chicago are
vivid characters in the narrative,
viewed from the perspective of
several authors as urban life
grew and changed in the indus
trial age.

Kazin makes no attempt to be
inclusive in his treatment of
American writers. He is un
apologetic about his masculine
and Northeastern biases, and his
fondness for the major figure.
He does, however, broaden his
discussion of these much
discussed authors by coming at
them through their lesser
known works.
The thing that's most wonder
ful about this book, and the
thing that makes it interesting
and useful even if you don't
have the background that Kazin
assumes, is the touch of the
master critic. If there aren't
earthshaking revelations and in
sights here, there is a rare com
passion for the plight of the
"divine literatus" and the way
he was forced to work in
America. The mixed blessing of
isolation and a belief in "the in
finitude of the private mind"
has yielded a canon of authors
whose struggles with profes
sional and personal identity
produced a literature turned ob
sessively inward.
Kazin's sympathetic though
stern retelling of Scott
Fitzgerald's innocent and
doomed love for insane /elda is
a lit ending to a book by an au
thor whose scholarship is so ob
viously motivated by love as
well. Fitzgerald makes no ap
pearance in "An American
Procession" until this very wry
and touching essay which forms
the final section of the final
chapter, and this reader had
begun to wonder where Kazin
would put "The Great Gatsby"
and "Tender Is the Night." He
put them, of course, as the sum
mary statement to "a century of
American solipsism." The fa
mous quotation from "Gatsby"
about the earliest American set
tler standing awed in the pres
ence of "something
commensurate to his capacity
for wonder" ends the book, as
though the capacity for wonder
were somehow responsible for
this remarkable literarv history.

critic taking up one by one and
examining the preoccupations
of his half-century long career
and fitting them into a meaning
ful sequence. I.ike Adams,
Ka/in goes directly to the most
important figures of the period
to discover how they fed each
other's ambition, how they as
similated social change, in
search of the necessity in the
evolution. The aging critic often
looks at these writers, some of
whom he has known personally
and all of whom he has lived

with in one way or another for a
long time, as they themselves
aged and came to terms with
age.
But this sense of summing up
(and of seeing the characters in
the procession as they sum
themselves arid each other up)
yields more fond attention than
a sense of loss. Kazin writes,
despite his age. like a man to
whom these very familiar hooks
and authors still speak wonders.
He is a product of an era and
school of criticism that focused
attention on books and authors
and not on themselves, and
kazin makes us see and feel the
cataclysm of history in the age
when American literature
sought and found its voice. "On
Native Grounds," a product ol
Kazin's late 2()s, had suggested
that American literature to that
point was in some sense a fail
ure; hut here, going over much
the same territory, he finds a
heroism and current relevance
in its struggle. He refuses to let
us see this literary age as remote
and often establishes the con
nection between our conscious
ness and theirs, history then and
history now.
Kazin's method is largely bio
graphical. although his long ac
quaintance with the lives of
these authors makes the study
somewhat impressionistic as lie
assumes a basic familiarity in his
readers — of his own previous
books if nothing else. The per
sonal portraits we get here,
depressing though they
sometimes are, are only part of
the pleasure. Like Adams'
"Education." "An American
Procession" is organized around
major historical events — the
Civil War, the economic panic
of 1893-94, the Chicago Ex
position and finally, the great
spiritual crisis of the modern
writers. World War I. Cities like
New York and Chicago are
vivid characters in the narrative,
viewed from the perspective of
several authors as urban life
grew and changed in the indus
trial age.

Kazin makes no attempt to be
inclusive in his treatment of
American writers. He is un
apologetic about his masculine
and Northeastern biases, and his
fondness for the major figure.
He does, however, broaden his
discussion of these much
discussed authors by coming at
them through their lesser
known works.
The thing that's most wonder
ful about this book, and the
thing that makes it interesting
and useful even if you don't
have the background that Kazin
assumes, is the touch of the
master critic. If there aren't
earthshaking revelations and in
sights here, there is a rare com
passion for the plight of the
"divine literatus" and the way
he was forced to work in
America. The mixed blessing of
isolation and a belief in "the in
finitude of the private mind"
has yielded a canon of authors
whose struggles with profes
sional and personal identity
produced a literature turned ob
sessively inward.
Kazin's sympathetic though
stern retelling of Scott
Fitzgerald's innocent and
doomed love for insane /elda is
a lit ending to a book by an au
thor whose scholarship is so ob
viously motivated by love as
well. Fitzgerald makes no ap
pearance in "An American
Procession" until this very wry
and touching essay which forms
the final section of the final
chapter, and this reader had
begun to wonder where Kazin
would put "The Great Gatsby"
and "Tender Is the Night." He
put them, of course, as the sum
mary statement to "a century of
American solipsism." The fa
mous quotation from "Gatsby"
about the earliest American set
tler standing awed in the pres
ence of "something
commensurate to his capacity
for wonder" ends the book, as
though the capacity for wonder
were somehow responsible for
this remarkable literarv history.

Henry Adams, whose spirit
presides over Alfred Kazin's
loving appraisal ot America's
literary coming-of-agc, des
cribed his struggle to find
meaning in the chaotic 19th
century as an attempt "to fix for
a moment a necessary sequence
of human movement." Here lies
the principle behind Kazin's
method in this study of Ameri
can literature in its "crucial cen
tury," IK3O-1930. While his
title comes from Whitman, the
"process" in Kazin's
"Procession" owes its explana
tion to Adams.
Adams may seem like an in
truder in this field of American
literary luminaries that begins,
of necessity, with Ralph Waldo
Emerson, whose "Nature,"
published in 1X36, marked the
beginning of serious American
literature. The study continues
through a rather predictable
company of Thoreau, Haw
thorne, Poe, Whitman, Melville,
Dickinson, Twain, James,
Howclls, Dreiser and Crane. It
ends with Pound, Eliot,
Faulkner, Hemingway, Dos
Passos and Fitzgerald — all
weary chroniclers of post-World
War I disillusion. Nevertheless,
because Adams' life spanned
the century (he lived from IS3S
until 19IS), and because he was
an attentive and well-placed ob
server of America's meteoric

rise to power, he and his book,
"The Education ot Henry
Adams." give Kazin's study its
shape.
Adams wrote the
"Education" in his old age. and
called it "a study in twentieth
century multiplicity." Consider
ing himself a child of the 1 Sth
century ill-equipped to lace the
2()th, Adams the historian tells
ot his anguished attempts to dis
cover order in history, to ex
plain the tremendous forces that
arose and fragmented the world
in his lifetime. His "dynamic
theory of history" makes history
a process which includes those
mysterious forces represented in
the "dynamo" — a huge
generator that Adams saw at the
great Chicago Exposition of
1N93. Kazin, also from the per
spective of the end of his career,
has written a dynamic theory of
American literary history, one
which also focuses its learned
attention on the tremendous up
heaval ol 19th-century in
dustrialism, and attempts to
locate the moment when Amer
ican letters became "modern."
Kazin's manifest organizing
principle is the well-worked
theme of the American artist as
"isolato," the lone creative
mind trusting itself above all
else — as Emerson commanded
and making literature despite
his lack of contact with culture.
But isolation in this case doesn't
imply self-pity; "self-reliance"
leads in these writers to a
boundless egotism that affects
even mild Emerson himself. The
dynamos in this theory of his
tory are the forceful per
sonalities of the writers as they
struggled to make themselves
heard in a country preoccupied
with growth and power, not art.
Through the writers he selects,
and the biographical facts he
chooses to present, the progress
of American literature becomes
a "necessary sequence" of
selves whose unhappy isolation
breeds the overblown egos that
make possible their art. Like
Thoreau's chanticleer, the

American writer lustily crows
his early morning existence to a
sleeping nation.
Alfred Kazin, who will he 69
years old this year, began
writing book reviews for Ameri
can periodicals when he was 19
years old. In 1942, he published
his justly famous study of
American literature in the
modern period, "On Native
Grounds," which has become a
classic among historical ac
counts of the rise of literary art.
Kazin has lived his life as a man

of letters in the broad and
popular sense, and his new book
reflects the freedom of mind
that has made his literary
studies and personal narratives
so accessible and enjoyable. In
it.he returns to his first book's
field and revises some opinions
and focuses even more closely
and from a longer perspective,
on how the optimism ot the
early 19th century became the
disillusion of the early 20th.
The book has an appropriate
air of reassessment about it, of a

critic taking up one by one and
examining the preoccupations
of his half-century long career
and fitting them into a meaning
ful sequence. I.ike Adams,
