# Tuchman's 'March of Folly' advances at the double
## Her rapid, succinct analysis may leave some readers behind 
### The March of Folly" By Barbara Tuchman Knopf, $17.95. 447 pp BRUCE QUINN 
In an essay written a lew
\ears ago. Barbara Tuchman
chided a fellow historian tor
coddlinn his audience with
repetition, "as it the reader
were some sort of nitwit who
could not he trusted to retain
what he is told from one chapter
to the next." In her latest hook.
"The March of Folly," Tuch
man has practiced as she
preached. At times the reader
nearly (eels like the windswept
Alice racing behind the Red
Queen through a Wonderland
of nonsense scenarios whose
familiar characters forever
deliver their memorable
epigrams of perverse logic. But
the scenarios here are real, ran
ging from the bloody overthrow
of the Aztec empire to the col
lapse of the Renaissance
papacy, from England's loss of
the American colonies to the
American debacle in Vietnam.
And the familiar epigrams are
real, too, delivered by George
III and Lyndon Johnson, and
the real-world folly they repre
sent led their characters and
people to disaster.
"Although folly has been a

chronic and pervasive problem"
in governments, asserts Tuch
man. tew historians or political
philosophers have ever attacked
its universality head-on. She la
ments a world where the arts
and sciences are steady in their
magnificent advance under the
bright light ol reason, while the
political arena through the cen
turies is like a dim pool table on
which nations knock into one
another like mindless billiard
balls. Therefore, through a se
ries of case studies in avoidable
political catastrophes, she has
developed a lengthy and single
minded analysis ol the recurrent
collapse of reason in govern
ment, from the palaces like \ er
sailles to the smokey back
rooms.
(It should be said that luch
man may be too hard on politics
bv branding it the field most
lacking in human progress. Ex
perts in areas other than history
have often singled out their own
field of human endeavor as sin
gularly encumbered by blind
ness to reason. Kant, for
example, opened his
•'Prolegomena" by stating that
philosophy, alone among the
human sciences, seemed
doomed to forever trod about in
circles, never advancing a single

step; and perhaps the most
grave assessment of man's resis
tance to reason was given by the
physicist Max Planck, who in his
autobiography concluded that a
new concept "does not triumph
by convincing its opponents and

making them see the light, but
rather because its opponents
eventually die.")
The first part of "March of
Folly" presents Tuchman's con
cept of exactly what political
folly is — she distinguishes it

from mere incompetence, calcu
lated risk gone a\vr\ or the
whim ot a single individual: she
requires that a group ol com
petent and eontemporarv dissi
dents decried the foolish
strategy as hopeless. To illus
trate these themes, she presents
a nuniher of historical \igncttcs.
like the medieval loss of Iberia
to the Moors, and the second
Huguenot repression, which
drove mans of France's most
talented citi/cns into Holland.
Many of these examples, a lew
pages long, are as entertaining
and convincing as the accounts
she goes on to develop at
greater length: the Reforma
tion. the American Revolution
and Vietnam. On the other
hand, some of her early, hriel
examples made me uncomfort
able with the subtleties of her
definition of "folly." Thus. Cor
tex. who attacked the thriving
A/tec empire with a few
hundred men and 13 muskets,
was "reckless" but not
"foolhardy." while Montc/uma
had, in Tuchman's taxonomy ol
lolly, "woodenheadedness. in
the special category of religious
mania." For me. the distinction
between a Cortez and a Custer
hangs mostly on luck.
The point is important be
cause Tuchman's goal is to
pursue not primarily the se
quences of events, but the
reasons and motives that deter
mined their course. Her argu
ment is most damaged, rather
than most damaging, when she
makes clear the guileless incom
petence and ignorance of some
of her actors, like some of the
halfwit Renaissance popes, and
an English chancellor of the ex
chequer, "to whom a sum of five
figures was an impenetrable se
cret." On the other hand, one of
the most convincing bases for
folly emerges as underestima
tion of an opponent based on
cultural ignorance, sometimes
reflecting arrogance to the point
of racism. In this category fall
Gen. Wolfe's report to the
British Crown, after a tour of

the colonies, that he had seen
"the worst soldiers in the uni
verse." and Japan's devastat
mgly inaccurate perception ol
the probably American
response to I'earl Harbor (that
the I nited States would be
morally shattered.) In contrast,
as Tuchman makes clear, the
"Pearl Harbor" strategy has
consistently backfired, before
and since: Irom the Nazi
Blitzkrieg ol I ondon. to the
Allied bombings o! (ici many. to
the various "demoralization"

bombings of North Vietnam in
the 19605. All served to signifi
cantly strengthen and renew the
victim's resolve: the inability to
learn this lesson is folly.
Perhaps the most self
destructive trait that runs
through Tuehman's follies oc
curs whenever leaders invoke
the concept of prestige. She
outlines a number of plans,
some developed in the colonies,
most summarily rejected,
through which England could
have maintained a productive,
evolving relationship with her
American colonies. In each
case, the state of taxation with
out representation was viewed
as more prestigious in Parlia
ment. (On the continent, this
sort of uppity viewpoint has
been viewed as particularly En
glish. In his recent book "The
Europeans." Luigi Barzini notes
that English socialists "were the
only ones in Europe who
ignored Karl Marx, whose
doctrine was based on a study of
their own society and the think
ing of their own economists.")
Since a nation views its pres

tigc as a temporal commoditv.
extending backward and toi
w ;ud several decades, it is par
ticnlai'K valuable that Tuehman
begins the historx ol her main
examples several decades
before the climactic events like
I utiter's I hcscs or the Declara
tion ol Independence. I his
same approach, though, makes
it clear that her most powerful
ease lor true lollv is against the
.American involvement in \ iet
nam. Page alter page, passing
vear alter vear. she scathing in

her ;ittack 011 the political and
milium leaders who had count
less opportunities to see that the;
war. under the only conditions it
could he waged, was fruitless.
Bound only In the intangible
weh of "prestige. they were
forced to choose ever larger
delusions ol progress: In last
winter's PBS documentary
"Vietnam." the episode "Peace
Is At Hand" hore the damning
subtitle *" I 967-1 1 )73." Al
though in her epilog Tuehman
mentions parallels in Central
America, there are indeed some
concrete signs of progress since
Vietnam — provided, paradoxi
cally. through the freedom ol
19.N4 rhetoric, when retreat
from Lebanon could be an
nounced as a dramatic reaf
firmation of our commitment to
the government in Beirut.
All in all. Tuehman handles
the scope of her project with
surprising grace. She has pro
vided a memorable opportunity
for us to learn a few lessons
from history.
