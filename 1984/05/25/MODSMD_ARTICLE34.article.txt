Singin' in the Rain (1952)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Most people's choice for the
best musical film ever made. The
script, by Betty Comdcn and
Adolph Green, is in the tradition
of the great Kaufman and Hart
comedy Once in u Lifetime-. Both
are set in Hollywood in the
panicky, haphazard days of the
early talkies. (Producer Joseph
Schenck once said, "The trouble
with the whole industry is that it
talked before it thought.") Gene
Kelly — who co-directed and co
choreographed, with Stanley
Donen — plays a romantic star
of silent pictures who must make
the transition to sound films
along with his partner, Jean
Hagen, who has the most appall
ing voice Hollywood has ever
known. (Hagen gives a classic
comic performance.) Donald
O'Connor, whose acrobatic
•Make 'Em Laugh" number is
the high point of the picture,
plays his best friend, and Debbie
Reynolds is the girl he loves. As
in all of the memorable M-G-M
musicals of this period, one
knockout number follows an
other — Kelly's "Singin' in the
Rain," his duet with Reynolds of
"You Were Meant for Me,"
"Moses" by Kelly and
O'Connor, etc. The songs, by
Arthur Freed (head of the musi
cals unit at M-G-M) and Nacio
Herb Brown, date from the first
decade of film musicals.
Plays Monday with That's En
tertainment.'.
The Empire Strikes Back
(1980)
Memorial Auditorium
Sheer joy. This sequel to Star
Wars is probably the fastest
paced adventure film ever made,
and quite possibly the richest,
visually. The director, Irvin
Kershner, the photographer,
Peter Suschitsky, and a huge
crew of designers and special ef
fects people work up one treat
after another; a llama-like crea
ture that bounces along the ice. a
flight through an asteroid field, a
chilling battle between Luke
Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and
the evil Darth Vader (David
Prowse. but still bearing the
voice of James Earl Jones).
Keshner draws on Dali, Gustave
Dore. Frit/ Lang, Cocteau and
even Shakespeare for his im
agery. The screenplay by Leigh
Bracket! and Lawrence Kasdan
is not as witty as Star Wars, but it
is surprisingly affecting: It has
nivthic power. With Harrison
Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee
Williams as Lando C'alrissian
and Frank Ot as the voice of
Yoda, Luke's Jedi teacher.

Iconoclast though he was, the
great writer-director Preston
Sturges was not immune to sen
timentality: It mars much of this
movie, which many critics never

thcless consider his most impor
tant (probably because Joel
McCrea plays a movie director
in it, with some Sturgesian char
acteristics). Sullivan's Travels
isn't an easy film to forget,
however — it's one of a kind,
and some of it is genuinely
moving. John J.. Sullivan, the
filmmaker-hero, decides to
dump his career as a supplier of
crowd pleasers in favor of
making socially conscious
dramas. In order to research his
subject — the life of the hobo —
Sullivan sets out to impersonate
one. McCrea's co-star is
Veronica Lake; this is the
picture that made her a star, and
you'll understand why. The
Sturges repertory cast includes
William Demurest, Eric Blore.
Robert Warwick, Franklin
Pangborn, Porter Hall, Robert
Greig, Torben Meyer and Jimmy
Conlin.
Plays through Wednesday

The Philadelphia Story
(1940)
Kresge Auditorium
The quintessential Hollywood
studio entertainment. Philip
Barry wrote this sparkling high
comedy in 1939; Katharine
Hepburn, who had been
declared box office poison after
a series of movie flops, left for
Broadway to play the role of
Tracy Lord, the rich girl with an
intolerance for weakness, and
the film version, the following
year, marked her triumphant
return. Donald Ogden Stewart
adapted the play, George Cukor
directed it, and Hepburn's co
stars were Cary Grant and Jim
my Stewart, whose portrayal of
the love-struck reporter
Macaulay Connor won him an
Oscar. These three give the
definitive performances of their
roles; Barry's lines are so
marked with their readings that
the play has never succeeded in
revival, and a musical film ver
sion. High Society, in 1 1 >56 (with
Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and
Frank Sinatra), was cut-rate and
crass. With Ruth Hussey,
Roland Young, John Halliday,
Mary Nash. Virginia Weidler,
John Howard and Henry
Darnell; shot (in glistening black
and white) by Joseph Rutten
berg, and designed by Cedric
Gibbons.
Plays tonight at 9.

Padre Padrone (1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
There is reason to believe that
this film, written and directed by
Vittorio and Paolo Taviani. has
the most imaginative soundtrack
ever devised: They even attempt
a passage in which a voice-over
articulates a cow's point of view
while the young hero is milking
her. The Taviani brothers took
the movement from oppression
to freedom as their subject, and
language as their central metap
hor: The shepherd's son is
removed from school and tet
hered to his father's flock, but he
rebels — first through music and

The Awful Truth (1937)
History Corner, Room 2
This comedy about divorce is
one of the funniest films of the
Depression years, though it isn't
often revived. Cary Grant and
Irene Dunne, whose shrillness
has been toned down by the
director, Leo McCarey, play the
quarrelling couple, and Ralph
Bellamy (who first appears sing
ing "Home on the Range" to
himself) and Cecil Cunningham
play the second fiddles. Dunne's
costumes are terrific, especially
the hat she wears in court.(It
resembles a crushed vase.) Vina
Delmar's screenplay, based on
an Arthur Richman play, has a
beautiful, symmetrical structure.

then through education (and al
ways through words). This is a
brutal, impassioned film — a
masterpiece. Omero Antonutti
plays the tyrannical father; the
script was culled from the auto
biography by Gavino Ledda.
Plays Tuesday with The Night
of the Shooting Stars.
Tootsie (1982)
New Varsity Palo Alto
The first comedy ever made
about sex roles with ideas that
you don't feel embarrassed
about discussing afterwards.
Dustin Hoffman plays Michael
Dorsey. a gifted actor and
teacher of acting who shows up
at an audition dressed and made
up as a woman and lands a part
in a daytime soap. The movie
starts out in the tradition of
Some Like It Hot, but it grows
and grows: As Michael gets him
self deeper and deeper into this
sexual and professional decep
tion. he has to exercise all his ac
tor's wiles to keep up with the

game, while he is discovering
layers of sensitivity in himself he
never knew existed. Sydney Pol
lack has done a marvelous job of
shaping a first-rate script by Lar
ry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal
(and uncredited others), and he
affirms his reputation as a fine
actor's director: Hoffman. Jes
sica Lange, Bill Murray, Teri
Garr. Charles Duming, George
Gaynor and Pollack himself all
turn in excellent performances.
This is a comedy of real sen
sibility.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Educating Ritu.
The Nighf of the Shooting
Stars (J983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Poetic and eruptive. Vittorio
and Paolo Taviani's film is the
most extraordinary movie
anyone has made about war in
more than 20 years, and when
you try to think of other war
films with a comparably special

and complete vision, only a
handful come to mind — Birth of
a Nation. Grand Illusion,
Forbidden Games. Fires on the
Plain. The Taviani brothers tell
the story of the flight of some of
the townspeople of San Marti no
(in Tuscany) from the Fascists in
the final days before the Italian
liberation in August of 1944.
The narrator, Cecilia, was six
years old when it happened, and
is recalling her impressions, and
so the movie is scaled to a child's
view of a world in crisis: majes
tic, with sudden, quirky shifts of
tone and startling reversals that
are often funny and horrifying at
the same time. You can't pin
down the style of this picture,
because it changes constantly —
from burlesque to tragedy, to la
ment. to erotic fantasy, to heroic
romance — and it's all so fresh
that the Tavianis seem to be fin
ding their techniques as they go
along.
Plays Tuesday with Padre
Padrone.

Hair (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The hippies in Milos Forman's
film (adapted by Michael Weller
from the Rado-Ragni-
McDermot musical), who in
habit a 1960s fantasy version of
Central Park, are at once ob
noxious — brash and self
serving — and irresistible: Treat
Williams as Berger, the leader;
Annie Golden as snub-nosed
Jeanie, a sort of pot-generation
Helen Kane: Dorsey Wright as
Hud, a fierce, regal black man
whose features soften when he
sings; and Don Dacus as silly,
androgynous Woof. The movie
takes a cheap, dated anti
establishment attitude, and yet
when Berger lifts his foot above
the dinner table at the fancy
debutante ball the kids crash,
and bursts into his "I Got Life"
number — the picture's high
point — one can't help enjoying
the chaos. There's plenty to
quarrel with in this movie — like
the acid trip sequence, and the
platitudes about the generations
and Vietnam; in many ways it's
not really likable, but it's im
aginative and powerful. One
doesn't forget the double image
of an Asian girl singing "Mv
Body Is Walking in Space.'' or
the shot of the young soldiers
filing into the tomblike recesses
of a plane bound for the war.
The Twyla Tharp choreography
is sharp and startling; Lyzee
Klingman's editing cuts against
it, but when you see the effect of
the dance sequences, you have
to conclude that Klingman and
Forman knew exactlv what they

were doing. With John Savage.
Beverly D'Angelo, Meiba
Moore. Nell Carter. Nicholas
Ray, Ronnie Dyson and others.
Miroslav Ondricek supervised
the fine photography.

Under Fire (1983)
Bijou. Palo Alto
In Nicaragua in 1979, where
the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full apprecia
tion of its implications. Among
the many virtues of this shame
fully ignored movie are the fine
performances of Nolte, Joanna
Cassidy and Gene Hack man in
the central roles. (All play
reporters.) With Jean-Louis
Trintignant. Ed Harris and Rene
Enrique? as Somoza. Jerry
Goldsmith wrote the haunting
musical score (and Pat Methcny
plays on it).
Plays Thursday and next

Hepburn, who had been
declared box office poison after
a series of movie flops, left for
Broadway to play the role of
Tracy Lord, the rich girl with an
intolerance for weakness, and
the film version, the following
year, marked her triumphant
return. Donald Ogden Stewart
adapted the play, George Cukor
directed it, and Hepburn's co
stars were Cary Grant and Jim
my Stewart, whose portrayal of
the love-struck reporter
Macaulay Connor won him an
Oscar. These three give the
definitive performances of their
roles; Barry's lines are so
marked with their readings that
the play has never succeeded in
revival, and a musical film ver
sion. High Society, in 1 1 >56 (with
Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and
Frank Sinatra), was cut-rate and
crass. With Ruth Hussey,
Roland Young, John Halliday,
Mary Nash. Virginia Weidler,
John Howard and Henry

a passage in which a voice-over

This comedy about divorce is
one of the funniest films of the
Depression years, though it isn't
often revived. Cary Grant and
Irene Dunne, whose shrillness
has been toned down by the
director, Leo McCarey, play the
quarrelling couple, and Ralph

The first comedy ever made
about sex roles with ideas that
you don't feel embarrassed

Dustin Hoffman plays Michael
Dorsey. a gifted actor and
teacher of acting who shows up
at an audition dressed and made
up as a woman and lands a part
in a daytime soap. The movie
starts out in the tradition of
Some Like It Hot, but it grows

self deeper and deeper into this
sexual and professional decep

tor's wiles to keep up with the

game, while he is discovering
layers of sensitivity in himself he
never knew existed. Sydney Pol

affirms his reputation as a fine

The Nighf of the Shooting

Bijou, Palo Alto
Poetic and eruptive. Vittorio
and Paolo Taviani's film is the
most extraordinary movie
anyone has made about war in
more than 20 years, and when
you try to think of other war
films with a comparably special

and complete vision, only a
handful come to mind — Birth of
a Nation. Grand Illusion,
Forbidden Games. Fires on the
Plain. The Taviani brothers tell
the story of the flight of some of
the townspeople of San Marti no
(in Tuscany) from the Fascists in
the final days before the Italian
liberation in August of 1944.
The narrator, Cecilia, was six
years old when it happened, and
is recalling her impressions, and
so the movie is scaled to a child's
view of a world in crisis: majes
tic, with sudden, quirky shifts of
tone and startling reversals that
are often funny and horrifying at
the same time. You can't pin
down the style of this picture,
because it changes constantly —
from burlesque to tragedy, to la
ment. to erotic fantasy, to heroic
romance — and it's all so fresh
that the Tavianis seem to be fin
ding their techniques as they go
along.
Plays Tuesday with Padre

Hair (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The hippies in Milos Forman's
film (adapted by Michael Weller
from the Rado-Ragni-
McDermot musical), who in
habit a 1960s fantasy version of
Central Park, are at once ob
noxious — brash and self
serving — and irresistible: Treat
Williams as Berger, the leader;
Annie Golden as snub-nosed
Jeanie, a sort of pot-generation
Helen Kane: Dorsey Wright as
Hud, a fierce, regal black man
whose features soften when he
sings; and Don Dacus as silly,
androgynous Woof. The movie
takes a cheap, dated anti
establishment attitude, and yet
when Berger lifts his foot above
the dinner table at the fancy
debutante ball the kids crash,
and bursts into his "I Got Life"
number — the picture's high
point — one can't help enjoying
the chaos. There's plenty to
quarrel with in this movie — like
the acid trip sequence, and the
platitudes about the generations
and Vietnam; in many ways it's
not really likable, but it's im
aginative and powerful. One
doesn't forget the double image
of an Asian girl singing "Mv
Body Is Walking in Space.'' or
the shot of the young soldiers
filing into the tomblike recesses
of a plane bound for the war.
The Twyla Tharp choreography
is sharp and startling; Lyzee
Klingman's editing cuts against
it, but when you see the effect of
the dance sequences, you have
to conclude that Klingman and
Forman knew exactlv what they

Under Fire (1983)
Bijou. Palo Alto
In Nicaragua in 1979, where
the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full apprecia
tion of its implications. Among
the many virtues of this shame
fully ignored movie are the fine
performances of Nolte, Joanna
Cassidy and Gene Hack man in
the central roles. (All play

musical score (and Pat Methcny

Bijou, Palo Alto
Most people's choice for the
best musical film ever made. The

comedy Once in u Lifetime-. Both
are set in Hollywood in the
panicky, haphazard days of the
early talkies. (Producer Joseph
Schenck once said, "The trouble
with the whole industry is that it
talked before it thought.") Gene
Kelly — who co-directed and co
choreographed, with Stanley
Donen — plays a romantic star
of silent pictures who must make
the transition to sound films
along with his partner, Jean
Hagen, who has the most appall
ing voice Hollywood has ever
known. (Hagen gives a classic
comic performance.) Donald
O'Connor, whose acrobatic
•Make 'Em Laugh" number is
the high point of the picture,
plays his best friend, and Debbie
Reynolds is the girl he loves. As
in all of the memorable M-G-M
musicals of this period, one
knockout number follows an
other — Kelly's "Singin' in the
Rain," his duet with Reynolds of
"You Were Meant for Me,"
"Moses" by Kelly and
O'Connor, etc. The songs, by
Arthur Freed (head of the musi

Herb Brown, date from the first
decade of film musicals.

Sheer joy. This sequel to Star

Peter Suschitsky, and a huge

flight through an asteroid field, a
chilling battle between Luke

the evil Darth Vader (David

voice of James Earl Jones).
Keshner draws on Dali, Gustave

is not as witty as Star Wars, but it
is surprisingly affecting: It has

Sturges was not immune to sen
timentality: It mars much of this
movie, which many critics never

isn't an easy film to forget,
however — it's one of a kind,

you try to think of other war
films with a comparably special

and complete vision, only a
handful come to mind — Birth of
a Nation. Grand Illusion,
Forbidden Games. Fires on the
Plain. The Taviani brothers tell
the story of the flight of some of
the townspeople of San Marti no
(in Tuscany) from the Fascists in
the final days before the Italian
liberation in August of 1944.
The narrator, Cecilia, was six
years old when it happened, and
is recalling her impressions, and
so the movie is scaled to a child's
view of a world in crisis: majes
tic, with sudden, quirky shifts of
tone and startling reversals that
are often funny and horrifying at
the same time. You can't pin
down the style of this picture,
because it changes constantly —
from burlesque to tragedy, to la
ment. to erotic fantasy, to heroic
romance — and it's all so fresh
that the Tavianis seem to be fin
ding their techniques as they go
along.
Plays Tuesday with Padre
Padrone.

Hair (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The hippies in Milos Forman's
film (adapted by Michael Weller
from the Rado-Ragni-
McDermot musical), who in
habit a 1960s fantasy version of
Central Park, are at once ob
noxious — brash and self
serving — and irresistible: Treat
Williams as Berger, the leader;
Annie Golden as snub-nosed
Jeanie, a sort of pot-generation
Helen Kane: Dorsey Wright as
Hud, a fierce, regal black man
whose features soften when he
sings; and Don Dacus as silly,
androgynous Woof. The movie
takes a cheap, dated anti
establishment attitude, and yet
when Berger lifts his foot above
the dinner table at the fancy
debutante ball the kids crash,
and bursts into his "I Got Life"
number — the picture's high
point — one can't help enjoying
the chaos. There's plenty to
quarrel with in this movie — like
the acid trip sequence, and the
platitudes about the generations
and Vietnam; in many ways it's
not really likable, but it's im
aginative and powerful. One
doesn't forget the double image
of an Asian girl singing "Mv
Body Is Walking in Space.'' or
the shot of the young soldiers
filing into the tomblike recesses
of a plane bound for the war.
The Twyla Tharp choreography

to conclude that Klingman and

Under Fire (1983)
Bijou. Palo Alto
In Nicaragua in 1979, where
the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full apprecia
tion of its implications. Among
the many virtues of this shame
fully ignored movie are the fine
performances of Nolte, Joanna
Cassidy and Gene Hack man in
the central roles. (All play

Trintignant. Ed Harris and Rene
Enrique? as Somoza. Jerry
Goldsmith wrote the haunting
musical score (and Pat Methcny
plays on it).

Singin' in the Rain (1952)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Most people's choice for the
best musical film ever made. The
script, by Betty Comdcn and
Adolph Green, is in the tradition
of the great Kaufman and Hart
comedy Once in u Lifetime-. Both
are set in Hollywood in the
panicky, haphazard days of the
early talkies. (Producer Joseph
Schenck once said, "The trouble
with the whole industry is that it
talked before it thought.") Gene
Kelly — who co-directed and co
choreographed, with Stanley
Donen — plays a romantic star
of silent pictures who must make
the transition to sound films
along with his partner, Jean
Hagen, who has the most appall
ing voice Hollywood has ever
known. (Hagen gives a classic
comic performance.) Donald
O'Connor, whose acrobatic
•Make 'Em Laugh" number is
the high point of the picture,
plays his best friend, and Debbie
Reynolds is the girl he loves. As
in all of the memorable M-G-M
musicals of this period, one
knockout number follows an
other — Kelly's "Singin' in the
Rain," his duet with Reynolds of
"You Were Meant for Me,"
"Moses" by Kelly and
O'Connor, etc. The songs, by
Arthur Freed (head of the musi
cals unit at M-G-M) and Nacio
Herb Brown, date from the first
decade of film musicals.

The Empire Strikes Back
(1980)
Memorial Auditorium
Sheer joy. This sequel to Star
Wars is probably the fastest
paced adventure film ever made,
and quite possibly the richest,
visually. The director, Irvin
Kershner, the photographer,
Peter Suschitsky, and a huge
crew of designers and special ef
fects people work up one treat
after another; a llama-like crea
ture that bounces along the ice. a
flight through an asteroid field, a
chilling battle between Luke
Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and
the evil Darth Vader (David
Prowse. but still bearing the
voice of James Earl Jones).
Keshner draws on Dali, Gustave
Dore. Frit/ Lang, Cocteau and
even Shakespeare for his im
agery. The screenplay by Leigh
Bracket! and Lawrence Kasdan
is not as witty as Star Wars, but it
is surprisingly affecting: It has
nivthic power. With Harrison
Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee

and Frank Ot as the voice of
Yoda, Luke's Jedi teacher.

Iconoclast though he was, the
great writer-director Preston
Sturges was not immune to sen
timentality: It mars much of this
movie, which many critics never

thcless consider his most impor
tant (probably because Joel
McCrea plays a movie director
in it, with some Sturgesian char
acteristics). Sullivan's Travels
isn't an easy film to forget,
however — it's one of a kind,
and some of it is genuinely
moving. John J.. Sullivan, the
filmmaker-hero, decides to
dump his career as a supplier of
crowd pleasers in favor of
making socially conscious
dramas. In order to research his
subject — the life of the hobo —
Sullivan sets out to impersonate
one. McCrea's co-star is
Veronica Lake; this is the
picture that made her a star, and
you'll understand why. The

The Philadelphia Story
(1940)
Kresge Auditorium
The quintessential Hollywood
studio entertainment. Philip
Barry wrote this sparkling high
comedy in 1939; Katharine
Hepburn, who had been
declared box office poison after
a series of movie flops, left for
Broadway to play the role of
Tracy Lord, the rich girl with an
intolerance for weakness, and
the film version, the following
year, marked her triumphant
return. Donald Ogden Stewart
adapted the play, George Cukor
directed it, and Hepburn's co
stars were Cary Grant and Jim
my Stewart, whose portrayal of
the love-struck reporter
Macaulay Connor won him an
Oscar. These three give the
definitive performances of their
roles; Barry's lines are so
marked with their readings that
the play has never succeeded in
revival, and a musical film ver
sion. High Society, in 1 1 >56 (with
Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and
Frank Sinatra), was cut-rate and
crass. With Ruth Hussey,

Dustin Hoffman plays Michael

the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full apprecia
tion of its implications. Among
the many virtues of this shame
fully ignored movie are the fine
performances of Nolte, Joanna
Cassidy and Gene Hack man in
the central roles. (All play
reporters.) With Jean-Louis
Trintignant. Ed Harris and Rene
Enrique? as Somoza. Jerry
Goldsmith wrote the haunting
musical score (and Pat Methcny
plays on it).
Plays Thursday and next
Friday with The Year oj Living
Dangerously.
