### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
The presidents of Sigma Chi Omega and Theta Delta
Chi fraternities said yesterday that the Row Office is
taking action in response to "an altercation" which
erupted at a crowded Sigma Chi party last week.
The fraternity presidents gave no details, hut several
people who claim they witnessed the incident said it con
sisted of a brief verbal and physical bout between two or
three members of Theta Delts and several members of
Sigma Chi at approximately 12:30 a.m. last Friday. Those
involved reportedly stopped fighting when police arrived,
and no arrests were made.
Sigma Chi President Mike Llerandi said he was at the
party but has been advised by Jim Cadena. assistant direc

tor of the Row. not to give details of the incident. "The
Row Office is taking care of it." Llerandi said.
Cadena did not return The Daily's phone calls regarding
the matter.
Theta Delt President Jim Rutter. who described the in
cident as "a few tempers flaring," said Cadena told him
the Row Office was sending letters to two members of the
fraternity to inform them of the action to be taken.
Rutter emphasized that individual members, and not the
fraternity as a whole, were involved in the incident.
"Although one or two of our members were involved in
what is now being referred to as an altercation," he said,
"it was not a house activity, nor was the blame being tli-
reeled toward the house by the Row
Office."
A Theta Delt member who said he
was involved in the fight said members
nt his fraternity were drawn into the
conflict after they saw two of their
friends with "a couple of guys (from
Sigma Chi) on them.
'■■It was their (the Sigma Chi mem
bers') house and they were all over
us." he said, adding that "the Sigma
Chis were just trying to have a calm
party and it was understandable that
they might have overreacted.
He said that many Sigma Chi mem
bers participated in the incident by
trviniz to contain those involved in the
fight.
