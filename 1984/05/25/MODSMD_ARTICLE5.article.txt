## 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
Ivan Escobar Melende/. a founding
member of the Salvadoran Human
Rights Commission, told a crowd in
Kresge Auditorium last night that
U.S. military aid to El Salvador has
resulted in the bloodshed and human
rights violations that have plagued the
Central American counuy.
"Since abmn i l >2o. the United
States has been protecting the Sal
vadoran people. And what do we have
as a result of this protection from the
United States?" Meleiukv said.
"About 75 percent ol the popula
tion is suffering irom malnutrition;
150 out of 1000 children die before
they are live years old; children have
to begin to work since they are eight
years old. They cannot go to school,
and this is why 60 percent ot the popu
lation is illiterate. An.i we have a life
expectancy of 49 year*, he said.
Pointing out that since 1979 more
than 50.000 people have died in El
Salvador. Melende/ â€¢:: :, .l the aid El
Salvador is presently receiving from
the United States is not what can

really help the people of the country.
"We don't want military aid. What
we need is economic aid," Melende/
said. "What we need is beans. What
we need is rice. What we need is
something to eat."
The Salvadoran speaker said he had
hoped President-elect Jose Napolean
Duarte would help to restore order to
the state by organizing the armed
forces and abolishing the Tightest
death squads.
However, Melende/ said he has
recently learned o! information that
indicates this will not be Duarte's ob
jective.
"Just the day before yesterday, I
learned he (Duarte) had agreed to ap
point (ien. \ ides Casanova and his
group. I want you to see that the situa
tion in Salvador is not going to change.
Gen. \ ides Casanova was the head ol
the National Guard when four U.S
missionaries were killed, and he was
covering up the investigation," Melen
de/. said.
Melende/ said that since 19N2. the
