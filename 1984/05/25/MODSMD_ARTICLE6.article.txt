Nicaraguan rebels praised by President Reagan as freedom
fighters and denounced b\ Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill

Bv a vote of 267 to I 54. the lawmakers adopted a compro
mise spending plan that calls for $h2 million in Salvadoran se
curity assistance, but earmarks $32 million of the total to pay

The House then went on to approve, 241-177, a measure
refusing to provide any additional lunds in the current fiscal
year for the guerrillas fighting the leftist Sandinsta govern
ment of Nicaragua.
"Let us end this war that brings lis no peace." Rep. Lee
Hamilton of Indiana, a senior Democratic member of the
House Intelligence Committee, implored, arguing that the
Nicaraguan conflict is continually escalating and "is no longer
what it was intended to be."
House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-III.), on the
other hand, told his colleagues that it they denied support to

giving aid with one hand and taking it away with the other."
"It is morally wrong," Michel said. "What kind of moral
Israelis attack guerrilla base
I el Aviv, Israel — Israel air force planes attacked a guer
rilla base in Syrian-controlled eastern I ebanon yesterday, the
military command announced.
The command said the base was at Bar Elias, six miles west
of the Syrian border in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and eight
miles north of the Israeli army's front line in Lebanon.
It said the base attacked served as a regional headquarters
lor "terrorist organizations." usually a reference to Palestin
ian guerrillas.
The announcement said the planes scored "accurate hits"
on their targets and returned safely to their base.
It was the second attack on guerrilla positions in eastern
Lebanon in five days, and the 1 Ith air raid in Lebanon this
year.
On Sunday. Israeli planes attacked a pro-Iranian Lebanese
Shiite militia position in the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian
border.
175 deaths in India riots
New Delhi, India — One of the most drawn-out sectarian
riots in the country's history continued raging in western In
dia for the eighth day yesterday, raising the death toll to 175
and leaving more than 500 people injured, official sources
said.
A beleaguered police force continued to battle Hindu and
Moslem mobs in Bombay and neighboring areas as authori
ties reported a worsening of the situation in several places
where calm had seemd to have been restored
Police fired on a mob that attacked a police station near
Trombay. Eight persons were killed in the firing, police
sources said.
Unidentified assailants hurled an acid bomb at a pas
senger train near Than, about IS miles from Bombay, Wed
nesday night injuring 17, the United News of India news
agency said.
More army reinforcements were being sent to Bombay to
help police prevent the clashes from spreading to other areas.
Panel cuts MX funds in half,
eliminates nerve gas portion
Washington — The Senate Armed Services Committee
yesterday recommended that President Reagan's request for
40 MX missiles be cut nearly in half and that all money for
buying nerve gas components be eliminated from next year's
federal budget.
But the panel, completing its work on the fiscal 1985
defense bill, went beyond Reagan's requests in funding for
several key weapons programs, restoring money for one at
tack submarine and 120 M-l Abrams tanks that had been cut
in the administration's deficit-reducing budget revisions sub
mitted earlier this month.
The House, nearing completion of its version of the defense
authorization bill, bogged down for more than two hours in
partisan wrangling over an amendment banning the use of
U.S. troops in combat in Central America except under speci
fied conditions.
Eventually, the House turned down by a vote of 28M-99 an
effort by conservative Republicans to limit the amendment's
application if Reagan determined that the region faced a
communist threat. Work on the defense bill was scheduled to
resume in the House on Wednesday, after the Memorial Day
holiday.
The Senate committee's version of the bill differs from that
of the lull House primarily in its greater support for the MX,
the centerpiece in Reagan's plan to boost the nation's nuclear
missile arsenal. The committee recommended funding for 21
of the long-range weapons, while the House last week ap
proved only 15.
Prosecutor's prerogative OK'd
San Francisco — A prosecutor in a murder case can seek to
remove jurors who have reservations about the death penalty,
the state Supreme Court ruled yesterday in upholding a
double murder conviction.
In a case from Santa Monica, the court also upheld a state
law requiring a judge to impose a life-vvithout-parole sen
tence when the jury deadlocks on the penalty in a capital
murder trial.
The case involved John Zimmerman, convicted of raping a
1 2-year-old girl and then murdering her and her 18-year-old
brother by repeatedly hammering and stabbing them during a
burglary in April 1978.
During jury selection, the judge, at the prosecutor's re
quest, excluded all prospective jurors who said they would
vote against the death penalty in every case.
Then, according to Zimmerman's appeal, the prosecution
used its peremptory challenges — those allowed each side
without having to state a reason — to dismiss prospective
jurors who said they had reservations about the death
penalty.
The automatic exclusion of jurors opposed to the death
penalty in aliases had been upheld by the court in an earlier
case, and the justices yesterday also upheld the use of
peremptory challenges to dismiss jurors with reservations
about capital punishment.

"It is morally wrong," Michel said. "What kind of moral

rilla base in Syrian-controlled eastern I ebanon yesterday, the

of the Syrian border in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and eight
miles north of the Israeli army's front line in Lebanon.
It said the base attacked served as a regional headquarters
lor "terrorist organizations." usually a reference to Palestin
ian guerrillas.
The announcement said the planes scored "accurate hits"
on their targets and returned safely to their base.
It was the second attack on guerrilla positions in eastern
Lebanon in five days, and the 1 Ith air raid in Lebanon this
year.
On Sunday. Israeli planes attacked a pro-Iranian Lebanese
Shiite militia position in the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian
border.
175 deaths in India riots
New Delhi, India — One of the most drawn-out sectarian
riots in the country's history continued raging in western In
dia for the eighth day yesterday, raising the death toll to 175
and leaving more than 500 people injured, official sources

Moslem mobs in Bombay and neighboring areas as authori
ties reported a worsening of the situation in several places
where calm had seemd to have been restored

Panel cuts MX funds in half,
eliminates nerve gas portion
Washington — The Senate Armed Services Committee
yesterday recommended that President Reagan's request for
40 MX missiles be cut nearly in half and that all money for
buying nerve gas components be eliminated from next year's
federal budget.
But the panel, completing its work on the fiscal 1985
defense bill, went beyond Reagan's requests in funding for
several key weapons programs, restoring money for one at
tack submarine and 120 M-l Abrams tanks that had been cut
in the administration's deficit-reducing budget revisions sub
mitted earlier this month.
The House, nearing completion of its version of the defense
authorization bill, bogged down for more than two hours in
partisan wrangling over an amendment banning the use of
U.S. troops in combat in Central America except under speci
fied conditions.
Eventually, the House turned down by a vote of 28M-99 an
effort by conservative Republicans to limit the amendment's
application if Reagan determined that the region faced a
communist threat. Work on the defense bill was scheduled to
resume in the House on Wednesday, after the Memorial Day
holiday.
The Senate committee's version of the bill differs from that
of the lull House primarily in its greater support for the MX,
the centerpiece in Reagan's plan to boost the nation's nuclear
missile arsenal. The committee recommended funding for 21
of the long-range weapons, while the House last week ap
proved only 15.
Prosecutor's prerogative OK'd
San Francisco — A prosecutor in a murder case can seek to
remove jurors who have reservations about the death penalty,
the state Supreme Court ruled yesterday in upholding a
double murder conviction.
In a case from Santa Monica, the court also upheld a state
law requiring a judge to impose a life-vvithout-parole sen
tence when the jury deadlocks on the penalty in a capital
murder trial.
The case involved John Zimmerman, convicted of raping a
1 2-year-old girl and then murdering her and her 18-year-old
brother by repeatedly hammering and stabbing them during a
burglary in April 1978.
During jury selection, the judge, at the prosecutor's re
quest, excluded all prospective jurors who said they would
vote against the death penalty in every case.
Then, according to Zimmerman's appeal, the prosecution
used its peremptory challenges — those allowed each side
without having to state a reason — to dismiss prospective
jurors who said they had reservations about the death
penalty.
The automatic exclusion of jurors opposed to the death
penalty in aliases had been upheld by the court in an earlier
case, and the justices yesterday also upheld the use of
peremptory challenges to dismiss jurors with reservations
about capital punishment.
