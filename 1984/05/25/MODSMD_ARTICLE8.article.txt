Washington (AP) â€” As the
air war over the Persian Gulf in
tensified yesterday, the Reagan
administration urgently debated
alternate approaches on helping
Saudi Arabia bolster its
defenses against possible
Iranian air attacks.
White House and State De
partment spokesmen said a
decision to send Stinger anti
aircraft missiles to the Saudis
was still pending, but other offi
cials said the administration ap
peared to be committed to the
sale.
The officials, who spoke on
condition they not be identified,
said consultations with Congress
were moving ahead as quickly as
possible and that an announce
ment likely would be made
before week's end.
At issue was whether to give
the Congress 30 days notice of

the sale or for President Reagan
to use his emergency powers to
send the missiles immediately.
Presidential spokesman Larry
Speakes said, "We really have
no preference, pending our dis
cussions of the matter fully with
the Congress." Ihe administra
tion intends to "actively and
fully discuss this matter with the
leadership on the Hill before we
proceed in anv fashion with the
sale." he said.
"There is an urgency to the
situation there and that is prob
ably why this one item is in the
forefront at the moment."

State Department spokesman
John Hughes said the request
was under active consideration.
He noted that the Saudis had
asked for the missiles earlier this
year and had not withdrawn
their request.
