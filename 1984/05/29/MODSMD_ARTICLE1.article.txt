# Heat strikes
## People head for ice cream parlors 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
Peninsulans stormed ice cream
shops and swimming pools yesterday
to seek relief from a record-breaking
Memorial Day weekend heat wave.
"We've been packed, man," Bill
Lockwood, the manager of Haagen-
Dazs at the Stanford Barn, said yester
day afternoon. "We made more
money (Sunday) night than we could
believe."
At 4 p.m. yesterday, with Peninsula
temperatures reaching 92 degrees,
Lockwood said his arms were sore
from scooping, and he still hadn't had
time to eat lunch. But he was happy in
his confectionary crusade.
"I think it's great," Lockwood said.
"The more people the more glory.
That's why we're here: scooping ice
cream, cooling people off."
Haagen-Dazs wasn't alone as the
temperature neared the century mark
yesterday afternoon.
Christie Heisterberg, a scooper at
Bud's Ice Cream in Menlo Park, said
she'd served "shakes, lots of shakes"
all day long, but the end of the day and
a dip in a swimming pool were in sight.
At Baskin Robbins in Palo Alto,
business was down a little yesterday
because the temperature in the store
was up.
"We've been on and off busy," Bas
kin Robbins counterperson Jennifer
McElyea said. "But our store's so hot,
people aren't willing to come in
jtoday."
No such problem existed yesterday
at Lake Lagunita, according to Head
Lifeguard Scott Whitelaw.

Drastic measures were needed to cool down from the weekend's high temperatures. Ice cream shops were
popular retreats, but nine Soto residents beat the heat their own way in the middle of Wilbur field.
