## The 						Stanford Daily Identification crisis 
### 
The recent debate over whether the University
should adopt a magnetic photo identification card
system for the student body appears to have an
obvious solution. That solution has already been
recommended by the ASSU Student Affairs
Committee — students should be issued
laminated photo ID cards without a magnetic
strip until the institution of a magnetized system
becomes financially feasible.
There are several problems with the present
cards.
The fact that they are not laminated leads to
such rapid deterioration that they often resemble
a wad of illegible paper at the end of a quarter. A
laminated card would easily withstand a quarter's
worth of wear and tear and, in fact, could be used
for an entire year with a stamp attached similar to
the ones now on Food Service cards to identify
the quarter in which the student is registered.
Even better, this one card could streamline the
system by combining the Food Service and regu
lar ID cards.
The present IDs also lack a photograph of the

student, making them a poor form of identifica
tion — on and off campus. This can be a major in
convenience when one is asked to show two
pieces of identification when cashing a check
anywhere outside of the Palo Alto vicinity. As it
is, the driver's licenses of some states, including
New York, have no photo, making check cashing
nearly impossible. In this instance, the need for a
photo ID is even more imperative.
As soon as it becomes possible for the Univer
sity to afford a system to read magnetized cards
— a date that University President Donald Ken
nedy sees at the earliest as the winter quarter of
1985-86 — Stanford could adopt a magnetized
system. This move to change the student ID sys
tem is obviously one wanted by a majority of the
student body as one survey indicated that up to 75
percent of all students favored a switch from the
present system.
Since students have expressed interest in a
change, we feel that the University should con
tinue to work for a new, laminated photo inden
tification card system.
