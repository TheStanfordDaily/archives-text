# Party with a purpose
## 
### 
Stanford has a way of stifling our awareness.
We attend classes during the day. At nights we
study. By the time the weekend arrives, we feel
we owe ourselves a couple of days off.
So we party.
But at week's end. there is still something mis
sing, and that something is social and political
awareness. While parties serve to get us out of
academic ruts, they fail to get our minds past El
Camino Real.
Which is why Synergy's party last Friday was
such a good idea. All proceeds from the event
went to U.S. Out of Central America (USOOCA)
who will forward the money to Nicaragua. Fi
nally, a real theme party.
The party, then, simultaneously served several
purposes. First, it accomplished the traditional
function of providing its participants a good time.
Second, it raised funds for a cause many students
found worthwhile. Third, and possibly most im
portant, it brought to campus a controversial poli
tical issue.

Nicaragua is an important point of contention
in American politics, and our covert war against it
will undoubtedly be a much debated issue in the
upcoming presidential election. Yet few Stanford
students have enough exposure to the debate to
make an informed decision on the matter.
The Synergy party, while it did not claim to
present both sides of the question, at least served
to bring the matter into a position of relatively
high visibility.
Whether one agrees or disagrees with
America's official policy toward Nicaragua, in
creased discussion of the issue can bring only
good.
We laud Synergy's effort and hope other
campus groups and residences use this device to
help increase student awareness. No matter what
questions may have been raised concerning where
the Synergy funds were heading, no residence
should shy away from planning such relevant ac
tivities.
