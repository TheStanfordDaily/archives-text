## Closing airport a mistake 
### 
In response to Prof. John Felstiner's petition to close the
Palo Alto airport, we as pilots of the Stanford and Palo
Alto communities feel the following comments should he
made:
Not all planes flying through the Stanford/Palo Alto
area are flying to or from the Palo Alto airport. The
aircraft traffic density in the Bay Area is one of the highest
in the nation. There arc 10 other airports within 20 miles

VIEWPOINT

of Palo Alto from which planes may be flying. Closing the
Palo Alto airport will not reduce this traffic.
The existence of the Palo Alto airport with its FAA
controlled airspace (a five-mile-radius Airport Traffic
Area â€” "ATA") actually reduces possible noise and
safety problems in two ways. First, the Palo Alto airport is
sufficiently close to Moffet Naval Air Station, that the air
traffic patterns at Moffet have been modified to avoid the
Palo Alto area for obvious collision-avoidance safety
reasons. Closing the Palo Alto airport would eliminate its
ATA and the need for nonstandard traffic patterns at
Moffet. In this case, Palo Alto residents may find the small
aircraft overhead replaced by Navy P-3 Orion submarine
patrol aircraft. Ask any Mountain View resident living un
der one of the current traffic routes from Moffet; they
know that the noise from a small aircraft is dwarfed by that
of an Orion at 2000 or even 3000 feet. Second, eliminating
the Palo Alto airport and its ATA would eliminate the
control authority the FAA currently exercises, reducing
any possible enforcement of altitude requirements.
We question Felstiner's assertion that he "regularly
spots small airplanes flying as low as 500 feet." We regu
larly fly over the Stanford area at 1500 to 2000 feet and

rarely spot any planes flying lower. Visual estimates of
airplane altitudes by untrained ground observers are
notoriously inaccurate. Unless Felstiner has a calibrated
measuring device, lie is merely guessing and is probably
spotting planes flying at 1000 to 1300 feet, withing FA A
regulations. The FA A has issued requests for pilots to fly
higher than the required 1000 feet ( 1500 to 2000 feet if
possible) above populated areas for noise abatement
purposes. Most pilots we know are conscientiously follow
ing this advice. A very small minority of pilots may be
violating the altitude regulations, but the solution is to en
force the regulations, not to close the airport.
In addition to the noise and safety issues, there is the
airport's positive role in the community. Felstiner seems
eager to dismiss the large economic impact of having an
airport nearby for use by business and private citizens
alike. The Palo Alto airport is indeed "big business," but it
would not be so were the airport unnecessary. It serves not
just a "few private plane owners," but a large number of
businesses, private plane owners, private pilots who can
not afford their own planes and people whose only con
nection with aviation is to use the charter services pro
vided there. Ignoring the needs of such a large group by
closing Palo Alto airport for noise abatement and safety
makes as little sense as closing the Palo Alto portion of In
terstate 101 for noise abatement and safety.
In summary, we feel that if there is an aircraft noise and
safety problem, closing the Palo Alto airport will not solve
the problem, but may in fact increase the problem and
would significantly harm the local economy and commu
nity interests.

many of whom are Stan ford graduate students, are all
pilots.)
