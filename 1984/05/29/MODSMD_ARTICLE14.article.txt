# A 						Midwesterner in search of a California tan
## 
### 
I'm going to get a tan.
There, I've said it in print. Now 1
have to do it.
I've wanted a tan as long as I can re
member. Malibu Ken was my hero as
a child. But 1 grew up in Illinois, and
people there don't get tan. There's no
good reason why they don't, but just
as the Cubs never win the pennant,
people w ho lie out lor days in the Illi
nois sun still look like bleached beach
slugs.
I spent my youth in a melancholy
torpor, knowing that I would end my
days the color of paste. I used to eat a
lot of paste. I speculated that might
have had something to do with it.
But then, as 1 neared the end of my
anemic high school years, I realized
where my salvation lay: I would go to
Stanford.
I hadn't heard much about Stanford
— we don't get much news from the
outside in Illinois. What little I knew
about the school came from the en
trance application, and frankly, Dean
Fred made me a little nervous.
But I knew one thing: Stanford was

in California.
California. Beaches. Palm trees.
Surfers. Malibu Ken.
1 can't say that my friends gave me a
tearful farewell, because they all went
to colleges that started at a sensible
date. But 1 know what was on their
minds: "Can't wait to see this tan of
his."
I arrived at Stanford thinking it
would be something like Fantasy Is
land, except with John Kenneth
Galbraith instead of Ricardo Montal
ban.
Needless to say, I was crushingly
disappointed. The palm trees on Palm
Drive were embarrassingly stumpy,
and did not prevent it from being too
cold to tan in November. The libraries
were all indoors. Classes were sched
uled during P.T.H. (Prime Tanning
Hours). Soaking in knowledge and
soaking in ultraviolet rays did not
seem to mix.
I returned to the Midwest in dis
grace. I looked like I had been kept in
a box all quarter. In fact, I had been —
I had some trouble adjusting to col

lege life. Instead of being a focus of
envy, 1 became a figure of scorn, as
former friends reminded me that Pres
ident Reagan had come from Califor
nia.
I was determined not to suffer such
taunts again. I tried tanning winter
quarter, but succeeded only in acquir

ing a greenish tinge, which Cowell
diagnosed as mold.
I followed the advice of a prominent
news magazine, and tried to sun at the
pool while listening to my classes on
the radio. Only when I was severely
moonburnt did 1 realize that the
classes were being broadcast at night.

That the magazine was being sued for
$1 million made me feel a little better,
but did not make up for the mental an
guish I had experienced.
I've accomplished a lot here at Stan
ford. I've convinced everyone that I
am a junior when actually 1 am only a
sophomore. I have achieved the high
est honor possible for a Stanford stu
dent by becoming a Daily columnist. I
avoided being selected to appear on
"The Wheel of Fortune" during Col
lege Week. Still, none of this has any
meaning for me, because I haven t yet
reached the goal that has driven my
entire post-pubescent life: To become
a bronzed god.
This has been my story, but there
are many more like me. You can find
them in front of dorms, in the Oval, or
in the linear accelerator at SLAC if
they're really desperate. I'll be out
there too, as soon as I get this column
typed: another latter-day pagan, in
toxicated by Coppertone.
(Jim Nuureckas is a junior majoring in
political science. This is his final
column.)
