## Fighting for freedom of the press 
### 
Elie Abel's handwringing (Daily,
May 21) over the demise of some
thing called the National News Coun
cil is disturbing. He is worried about
the press' accountability in the ab
sence of an organization that had
arrogated to itself the task of passing
judgment on the work of America's
unfettered press.
To whom, may I ask Abel, was the
National News Council accountable?
Members of the press are accountable
to the First Amendment, their
readers and their counterparts in the
media. Abel ignores the fact that the
press monitors itself.
And. as Abel notes, the press is
accountable in the courts of law. He
seems to applaud the large jury
awards in recent libel suits. He failed
to point out that most of those awards
are, happily, overturned on appeal.
An array of corporate fat cats and
the likes of General Westmoreland
lead the call for greater media ac
countability in America today. To
those of us who are more concerned
about the freedom of the press than
its accountability, it is depressing that
Abel, a guru of the press, should
decide to join their ranks.

Returning dues
1 would like to thank Priscilla
Wheeler for her sincere concern that
the union dues be sent back to the
individual rather than to what might
possibly be the wrong union (Daily,
May 21). It certainly takes a load off
my mind and. I hope, convinces my
friend that Stanford cares about its
employees.
My friend says Stanford is return
ing the dues in an effort to weaken or
even kill the union, not out of a sense
of justice. He points out that union
dues, prior to May 7. were being sent
to Local 7 15 who forwarded the
monies to Local 680. No matter
which union received the dues, the
money ended up with Local 680
which is where the union members
wanted the money sent. By returning
the dues to individuals Stanford is
able to deny our chosen Local 680 of
the funds needed for operation.
My skeptic friend also points out
that the membership voted 632 to
125 on April 18 in favor of Local
680, but that Stanford won't recog
nize the election. In fact, he says that
if Stanford honestly wanted to get
along with the employees all it would
have to do is take the current con
tract, substitute 680 wherever 715

appears, and then sign it with all
other contractual agreements un
changed.
1 had to agree with him there; it did
seem to make sense and would result
in the continuation of what our cur
rent contract allows. Only the number
of the local would change. It is my
friend's belief that Stanford will try to
nickel and dime the union to death. 1
sure hope that isn't true because if
Local 680 dies then I'm afraid the
membership would tire of Stanford's
penny-ante approach and decide to
start all over again.
After seeing how we are thought of
by Stanford, union members are
talking about joining the Teamsters
Union. I don't have any objection to
being in such a strong union, but I
hope they first drop the clause that
requires union members to spend
time each month looking for Jimmv
Hoffa.
I also wish Priscilla Wheeler and
Stanford's administration would
spend less time doing things for us. If
the return of the union dues is an
indication of their concern, a little
more concern could kill our union,
for our own good, of course.

Show compassion
Lately a number of articles dealing
with abortion have appeared in The
Daily. Arguments about abortion
always seem to get bogged down in
the controversy over the point at
which a fetus can be considered a
separate, living individual. Since this
issue, based upon subjective notions
of what constitutes "life," perpetually
defies consensus, perhaps it would be
more accurate and useful to say
simply that abortion represents the
termination of the development of a
human being.
For, without making any value
judgments whatsoever, this is
precisely what occurs in an abortion.
And (making a value judgment) that
seems to me an action of utmost
consequence, regardless of whether
the fetus is actually "living" at the
time of abortion.
1 make this assertion realizing that
the issues surrounding abortion are
much more complex. Indeed, such a
profoundly troubling problem as a
woman's right to an abortion, should
be approached with compassion and
understanding rather than the vehe
ment condemnation and animosity
that's been displayed in recent articles
