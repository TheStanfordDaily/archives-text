## Housing and the Draw Stanford's system may be good, but it's not the best 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
The Draw is over and done with.
Either you drew like a madman and
are planning which suite to hang your
Bowie poster in, or you didn't draw so
hot, and can't seem to get the lyrics to
"Do You Know the Way to San Jose"
out of your head.
No matter how you drew, you may
revel in the fact that you could have
and probably would have done much
worse in the housing draw system at
one other school, UC-Berkeley.
In comparison to other colleges and
universities, Berkeley has an uncom
monly large number of housing prob
lems. Stanford students are
guaranteed three years of on-campus
housing. At Berkeley, however, stu
dents are guaranteed nothing.
About 20 percent of the incoming
freshmen arc forced to find housing
off of the main campus.
"We don't have nearly as many
places as we have people who want
them," said a Berkeley housing office
assistant. "About 8000 to 12,000 stu
dents apply for housing, but we only
have about 4500 places to fill."
These scarce spots are assigned in a
random, computerized draw in which
each individual student is assigned a
lottery number. A of students
may express the desire to room to
gether, but their chances of being
roomies are much lower than they are
at Stanford.
There are 18 dormitory-like halls,
39 fraternities, 15 sororities and a stu
dent co-op system.
The search for housing "is a very
traumatic experience for a Ireshman
who must find a place to live," said the
housing assistant.
Current students and incoming
freshman agree with this assessment ol
the housing situation. Junior Rachel
Cohen, who currently lives in a
sorority house on campus, recalled her
experience as an entering freshman.
"When I saw how bad my number
was, I was panic-stricken,"' said
Cohen, "I went to the housing office a
couple of times, but they didn't really
help."
She finally found a place, along with
25 other women, in the basement ot a
house on campus. "It was a huge room
filled with bunked beds, but it was OK

for one quarter," said Cohen.
Lack of assistance on the part of the
university is cited by many students as
one of the roadblocks to finding
housing. "They'll talk to you but they
won't work to find you something —
you have to find it yourself," one in
coming freshman complained.
This makes it very difficult for the
student who doesn't live close enough
to Berkeley to look for housing.
Cohen, a lucky Bay Area resident
said, "It must be terrible for people
who live far away."
Much farther away, at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, the

housing situation is very different.
As well as being guaranteed housing
for four years, freshman may choose
their housing once they arrive.
There, all freshmen are put in tem
porary rooms upon arrival. "This way
they have a 'residence orientation
week' which gives them a chance to
look around and get a feel for all the
available housing options before de
ciding where they ultimately want to
live," said Kathy Haskell, staff assis
tant for residence programs.
"During the first week they can go
through fraternity rush, which gives
them yet another option. Pledges may

then move into the houses right
away," said Haskell.
At the end of orientation week, stu
dents fill out a form with their living
preferences. "If too many people want
the same house, then there is a ran
dom lottery within the house in
demand. For the students that don't
get their choices, they are put in
limbo for two days, then at the end of
the week, everyone is housed in their
permanent assignments," explained
Haskell.
Generally, people stay in the same
dorm all four years, and simply switch
rooms each year.

Haskell said "it's a very flexible sys
tem. Everyone has said it's beneficial
to choose housing rather than to
receive arbitrary assignments. Since
each house has its own character due
to the people and the location and so
forth, people end up much happier
with such a system."
At the University of Texas at Aus
tin, housing is managed on a random
computer drawing. "There is no man
datory housing requirement for fresh
men, but about 51 percent of the
available on-campus space is reserved
for them," said Steve Haslund, assis
tant director of Resident Serv ices.

"We're only able to house about l l
to 12 percent of the student popula
tion. There is a total of 48,000 stu
dents in the university, with only
6400 single spaces. Hundreds are left
wanting to get in," said Haslund.
"The landlords in the area charge
pretty exorbitant prices, too. Al
though there is a boom in condomin
miuni building going on, which would
allow for buying options and would in
turn provide a tax break, many stu
dents are still forced into outlying ap
partments," he explained.
"We had a task force make a study
of how we could improve the univer
sity, and the main point they came up
with was to improve the campus
housing situation," said Haslund.
Princeton, on the other hand, paints
a pretty rosy picture of its student
living conditions.
"Everyone who wants housing gets
it," said Debbie Arnolds, from the
housing office. "It's required that all
freshmen and sophomores live on
campus, and after that, students may
do as they please."
Freshmen are all assigned according
to priorities indicated by mail betore
arrival. For the following years, stu
dents turn in request forms which are
computer assigned.
Harvard manages to please most of
the people most of the time as well.
Again, it is a computer-handled lot
tery which somehow allows lor 82 per
cent of the students receiving their
first choice, 91 percent receiving one
of their top three choices and only 9
percent are randomly assigned.
"The entire housing process from
start to finish takes three weeks ex
actly," said Lisa Colvin, staff assistant
in the housing office. "It is a tradition
that the letter informing the students
of where they will be housed is
delivered at exactly 8:30 a.m. on the
Thursday before spring break."
People set up vigils the night before
in wait of this traditional letter
delivery.
Students, once housed, usually
remain in that house for their remain
ing four years — all of which are. in
fact, guaranteed — with inter-house
transfer each year.

Princeton, on the other hand, paints
a pretty rosy picture of its student
living conditions.
"Everyone who wants housing gets
it," said Debbie Arnolds, from the
housing office. "It's required that all
freshmen and sophomores live on
campus, and after that, students may
do as they please."
Freshmen are all assigned according
to priorities indicated by mail betore
arrival. For the following years, stu
dents turn in request forms which are
computer assigned.
Harvard manages to please most of
the people most of the time as well.
Again, it is a computer-handled lot
tery which somehow allows lor 82 per
cent of the students receiving their
first choice, 91 percent receiving one
of their top three choices and only 9
percent are randomly assigned.
"The entire housing process from
start to finish takes three weeks ex
actly," said Lisa Colvin, staff assistant
in the housing office. "It is a tradition
that the letter informing the students
of where they will be housed is
delivered at exactly 8:30 a.m. on the
Thursday before spring break."
People set up vigils the night before
in wait of this traditional letter
delivery.
Students, once housed, usually
remain in that house for their remain
ing four years — all of which are. in
fact, guaranteed — with inter-house
transfer each year.

The Draw is over and done with.
Either you drew like a madman and
are planning which suite to hang your
Bowie poster in, or you didn't draw so
hot, and can't seem to get the lyrics to
"Do You Know the Way to San Jose"
out of your head.
No matter how you drew, you may
revel in the fact that you could have
and probably would have done much
worse in the housing draw system at
one other school, UC-Berkeley.
In comparison to other colleges and
universities, Berkeley has an uncom
monly large number of housing prob
lems. Stanford students are
guaranteed three years of on-campus
housing. At Berkeley, however, stu
dents are guaranteed nothing.
About 20 percent of the incoming
freshmen arc forced to find housing
off of the main campus.
"We don't have nearly as many
places as we have people who want
them," said a Berkeley housing office
assistant. "About 8000 to 12,000 stu
dents apply for housing, but we only
have about 4500 places to fill."
These scarce spots are assigned in a
random, computerized draw in which
each individual student is assigned a
lottery number. A of students
may express the desire to room to
gether, but their chances of being
roomies are much lower than they are
at Stanford.
There are 18 dormitory-like halls,
39 fraternities, 15 sororities and a stu
dent co-op system.
The search for housing "is a very
traumatic experience for a Ireshman
who must find a place to live," said the
housing assistant.
Current students and incoming
freshman agree with this assessment ol
the housing situation. Junior Rachel
Cohen, who currently lives in a
sorority house on campus, recalled her
experience as an entering freshman.
"When I saw how bad my number
was, I was panic-stricken,"' said
Cohen, "I went to the housing office a
couple of times, but they didn't really
help."
She finally found a place, along with
25 other women, in the basement ot a
house on campus. "It was a huge room
filled with bunked beds, but it was OK

for one quarter," said Cohen.
Lack of assistance on the part of the
university is cited by many students as
one of the roadblocks to finding
housing. "They'll talk to you but they
won't work to find you something —
you have to find it yourself," one in
coming freshman complained.
This makes it very difficult for the
student who doesn't live close enough
to Berkeley to look for housing.
Cohen, a lucky Bay Area resident
said, "It must be terrible for people
who live far away."
Much farther away, at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, the

housing situation is very different.
As well as being guaranteed housing
for four years, freshman may choose
their housing once they arrive.
There, all freshmen are put in tem
porary rooms upon arrival. "This way
they have a 'residence orientation
week' which gives them a chance to
look around and get a feel for all the
available housing options before de
ciding where they ultimately want to
live," said Kathy Haskell, staff assis
tant for residence programs.
"During the first week they can go
through fraternity rush, which gives
them yet another option. Pledges may

then move into the houses right
away," said Haskell.
At the end of orientation week, stu
dents fill out a form with their living
preferences. "If too many people want
the same house, then there is a ran
dom lottery within the house in
demand. For the students that don't
get their choices, they are put in
limbo for two days, then at the end of
the week, everyone is housed in their
permanent assignments," explained
Haskell.
Generally, people stay in the same
dorm all four years, and simply switch
rooms each year.

Haskell said "it's a very flexible sys
tem. Everyone has said it's beneficial
to choose housing rather than to
receive arbitrary assignments. Since
each house has its own character due
to the people and the location and so
forth, people end up much happier
with such a system."
At the University of Texas at Aus
tin, housing is managed on a random
computer drawing. "There is no man
datory housing requirement for fresh
men, but about 51 percent of the
available on-campus space is reserved
for them," said Steve Haslund, assis
tant director of Resident Serv ices.

"We're only able to house about l l
to 12 percent of the student popula
tion. There is a total of 48,000 stu
dents in the university, with only
6400 single spaces. Hundreds are left
wanting to get in," said Haslund.
"The landlords in the area charge
pretty exorbitant prices, too. Al
though there is a boom in condomin
miuni building going on, which would
allow for buying options and would in
turn provide a tax break, many stu
dents are still forced into outlying ap
partments," he explained.
"We had a task force make a study
of how we could improve the univer
sity, and the main point they came up
with was to improve the campus
housing situation," said Haslund.
