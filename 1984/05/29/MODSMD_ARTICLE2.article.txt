# USW picket in question
## Mondale cancels 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Democratic presidential hopeful
Walter Mondale cancelled his plans to
speak here today in order to spend an
extra day campaigning in New Jersey,
officials at his state headquarters an
nounced yesterday afternoon.
But University President Donald
Kennedy and some students con
nected with the planned Mondale
speech are now wondering if threats
by the United Stanford Workers
(USW) to picket Mondale's speech
may have played a role in the former
vice president's decision not to appear
on campus. The union had sent a
telegram Friday to Mondale asking
that he speak out against the Univer
sity's relations with labor and
threatened to picket if he did not.
In a statement released to the Uni
versity News Service, Kennedy said
such threats "put any candidate in an
impossibly awkward position."
"National candidates don't have
any adequate means of assessing local
issues," Kennedy said in his state
ment. "This leaves them the option of
crossing a picket line or not coming."
Ali Webb, the state's press
spokesperson for Mondale, said
Mondale's decision was not based on
the USW picket.
"Those concerns had been raised,"
she said. "The decision had been
made to go ahead."
Webb said Mondale decided to
spend an extra day campaigning for
the New Jersey primary, which will be
held the same day as the California
primary.
"In a national campaign, it is next to
impossible to divide up the time be
tween New Jersey and California,"
she said. "You can imagine the logisti
cal nightmare of trying to campaign on
both coasts."
Webb said Mondale will now stay in
California until June 5 rather than

June 4, and the day of Mondale's
planned speech "has been traded" for
June 5.
Eric Diesel, head of Stanford Stu
dents for Mondale, also said USW
threats had nothing to do with
Mondale's decision.
Diesel said USW members were
threatening to picket the event "in or
der to gain media attention" and not
to protest Mondale himself.
According to Diesel, USW mem
bers contacted him Friday morning
and said they would picket Mondale's
speech unless he got Mondale to
publicly support the USW.
"They basically said they would
picket even though they supported
him unless he said something against
Kennedy," Diesel said. "I told them I
didn't have any access to Mondale's
speeches and suggested they talk to
state headquarters."
Mary Ann Tenuto, labor consultant
to the USW, said the USW sent a
telegram to Mondale on Friday asking
Mondale to issue a statement in sup
port of USW.
"If he refused to issue a statement,
then we said it was our intention to
throw up a picket line," Tenuto said.
Tenuto said USW expected a state
ment because "Mondale has always
been a strong supporter of working
people," but that officials connected
with Mondale then told USW that
Mondale would not issue such a state
ment.
"But our intention was to protest
what Stanford was doing and get it
into the press," Tenuto said. "It
wasn't to protest Mondale himself."
"We know there are always tons of
media whenever a national candidate
is around, and if Mondale had issued a
statement then the picket wouldn't
have been necessary," she said.
Tenuto said the telegram sent by
