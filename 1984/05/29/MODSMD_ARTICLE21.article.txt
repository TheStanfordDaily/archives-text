## Card nine beats heat, but not Sun Devils in NCAAs 
### ROB ZWEIG Staff sports writer 
Tempt', Ariz. — Top-ranked
Arizona State ended the 1984
NCAA West II Regional Sun
day night just the way the home
town tans had wanted it to
all weekend — with a 5-4 vic
tory over Pacific-10 Southern
Division rival Stanford that
propelled the Sun Devils to the
College World Series for the
third time in four years.
The triumph boosted Arizona
State to 53-18 on the season,
hut it was not easy. Nor were
the 8-4 and 15-11 wins over
Washington State and Hawaii
on Friday and Saturday nights
respectively that carried the Sun
Devils to the deciding game.
Stanford, No. 15 in the na
tional rankings and the tourna
ment's third seed, finished
second in the tourney despite
playing its first three contests at
temperatures above 105
degrees and despite a 10-7, 10-
inning loss to the No. 2 seed, the
eighth-rated University of
Hawaii, in the opening game.
The Cardinal bounced back
with a 3-1 win over WSU on
Saturday afternoon and
drubbed Hawaii 11-7 Sunday to
set up a showdown with ASU
just a few hours later.
The 5798 fans that packed
Packard Stadium quickly dis
covered why ASU Head Coach
Jim Brock had warned his Sun
Devil worshipers to be wary of
the Palo Alto invaders.
ASU starter Kendall Carter
found out too. It took Carter
just three pitches to load the
bases in the top of the first in
ning. Pete Stanicek bunted for a
base hit on the first pitch. The

next pitch hit Walt Harris anil
the third was slapped to right
field by Darryl Stephens for his
sixth consecutive hit of the day
after a 5-for-5 performance
against Hawaii.
Rick Lundblade plated
Stanicek with a sacrifice fly for
his ninth run batted in of the
tournament and, two outs later,
Toi Cook's infield single scored
Harris from third to give Stan
ford a 2-0 lead. It did not last
long.
ASU's All-America Oddibe
McDowell led off the bottom of
the first with a double off Stan
ford starter Kevin Kunkel. Fol
lowing a walk, Barry Bonds
loaded the bases with an infield
hit.
Kunkel induced cleanup hit
ter Todd Brown, later named
the outstanding player in the
tournament, to hit a grounder to
shortstop John Verducci that
was a tailor-made double play
until the ball popped from Ver
ducci's grasp as he pulled it from
his glove. McDowell scored on
the error to make the score 2-1
and the Sun Devils tied the
game when Luis Medina's
double-play grounder forced in
a run.
Kunkel proved to be razor
sharp, mowing down the 13
straight ASU hitters before a
fifth-inning walk. Meanwhile,
his teammates chased Carter
and grabbed a 4-2 lead off
reliever Chris Beasley with a
walk, an RBI single by Verducci
and a double to the wall by
Machtolf that brought Verducci
home. •
But Beasley, who was also
sharpshooting guard on the
ASU basketball squad, held the

Card at bay the rest of the way
and earned his second win
against one loss when the Sun
Devils rallied for three scores in
the sixth.
"He came in and dominated
the game," said the unusually
cordial Brock. "It happened in

all three tournament games that
we had a reliever come in and
do the job."
Marquess had a different view
of things. 'T think Kunkel
walking Bonds (to lead off the
sixth) was the turning point.
Then they got a couple of hits

and the three runs that won the
game." ASU whittled the Stan
ford lead to 4-3 against Kunkel
(3-8), the loser, when Marquess
paged reliever Rick Dietz with
runners at the corners and one
out.
"Kunkel was beginning to get

the ball up (in the strike zone)
and I felt we'd get a ground ball
with Dietz," Marquess ex
plained. "He did, but it was a
base hit." The hit was Don
Wakamatsu's bouncer beyond
the reach of a leaping Dietz that
tied the game at 4-4. Dietz then
committed a throwing error in
trying to keep Wakamatsu close
at first base to allow Medina to
score the winning run. With the
loss Stanford finishes its season
with a 38-26-1 record.
Stanford could take some
consolation in placing three
players on the all-tournament
team: Lundblade, Stephens and
Jeff Ballard.
Lundblade blasted a home
run in each of the first two
games, his eighth and ninth of
the season, while going 7-for-13
with nine RBIs in the four
games. His homer in the first
game against Hawaii helped to
build an early 7-4 Cardinal ad
vantage. However, the Rain
bows, led by Kahai Shishido's
five hits and five RBIs, fought
back against Stanford ace John
Radtke.
Hawaii tallied three times in
the eighth and then won the
contest in the 10th against the
loser in relief. Rick Dietz (4-2).
Rainbow reliever Chuck Kane
stifled the Card for more than
four frames to record his fifth
victory in six decisions.
Faced with the task of win
ning four straight games in three
days, Stanford went to work be
hind southpaw Jeff Ballard.
Only a controversial muffed
third strike that put a WSU run
ner on first prevented a Ballard
shutout. The next Cougar hitter

laced an RBI double, one of
only four hits permitted in Bal
lard's complete game victory, to
put WSU on top 1-0 after two
innings.
Stanford struck once in the
fourth and Lundblade's two-run
round-tripper in the fifth iced
the win for Ballard (H-s)..To
gether with their 8-4 defeat by
ASU, the Cougers were
eliminated and finished the year
at 41-19.
Sunday afternoon's rematch
with Hawaii was Darryl Step
hens' day as the senior
centerfielder turned in the best
game of the tournament — and
the best game of his career — to
lead the Card to an 11-7 victory.
His perfect performance at the
plate helped to boost his tourna
ment totals to 9-for-14 with a
double and two triples to go
with his five RBls.
On the day, Stephens and
Lundblade went 8-for-10
against three Rainbow hurlers
with six RBIs and six runs
scored.
"(Stephens) had a great
tournament," Marquess said
Sunday night. "He had his
best season this year and coming
off a (knee) injury, that was
quite an accomplishment. He
does so many things, I don't
think we'll be able to replace
him."
The offensive explosion over
shadowed the strong pitching
performance of freshman Rob
Wassenaar, who made only his
third start of the season and
upped his record to 2-1. Was
senaar spaced 10 hits over BV3
innings before getting relief help
from Gregg Lomnicky. Hawaii
ended its campaign at 49-21-1.

inning loss to the No. 2 seed, the
eighth-rated University of
Hawaii, in the opening game.
The Cardinal bounced back
with a 3-1 win over WSU on
Saturday afternoon and
drubbed Hawaii 11-7 Sunday to
set up a showdown with ASU
just a few hours later.
The 5798 fans that packed
Packard Stadium quickly dis
covered why ASU Head Coach
Jim Brock had warned his Sun
Devil worshipers to be wary of
the Palo Alto invaders.
ASU starter Kendall Carter
found out too. It took Carter
just three pitches to load the
bases in the top of the first in
ning. Pete Stanicek bunted for a
base hit on the first pitch. The

next pitch hit Walt Harris anil
the third was slapped to right
field by Darryl Stephens for his
sixth consecutive hit of the day
after a 5-for-5 performance
against Hawaii.
Rick Lundblade plated
Stanicek with a sacrifice fly for
his ninth run batted in of the
tournament and, two outs later,
Toi Cook's infield single scored
Harris from third to give Stan
ford a 2-0 lead. It did not last
long.
ASU's All-America Oddibe
McDowell led off the bottom of
the first with a double off Stan
ford starter Kevin Kunkel. Fol
lowing a walk, Barry Bonds
loaded the bases with an infield
hit.
Kunkel induced cleanup hit
ter Todd Brown, later named
the outstanding player in the
tournament, to hit a grounder to
shortstop John Verducci that
was a tailor-made double play
until the ball popped from Ver
ducci's grasp as he pulled it from
his glove. McDowell scored on
the error to make the score 2-1
and the Sun Devils tied the
game when Luis Medina's
double-play grounder forced in
a run.
Kunkel proved to be razor
sharp, mowing down the 13
straight ASU hitters before a
fifth-inning walk. Meanwhile,
his teammates chased Carter
and grabbed a 4-2 lead off
reliever Chris Beasley with a
walk, an RBI single by Verducci
and a double to the wall by
Machtolf that brought Verducci
home. •
But Beasley, who was also
sharpshooting guard on the
ASU basketball squad, held the

Card at bay the rest of the way
and earned his second win
against one loss when the Sun
Devils rallied for three scores in
the sixth.
"He came in and dominated
the game," said the unusually
cordial Brock. "It happened in

all three tournament games that
we had a reliever come in and
do the job."
Marquess had a different view
of things. 'T think Kunkel
walking Bonds (to lead off the
sixth) was the turning point.
Then they got a couple of hits

and the three runs that won the
game." ASU whittled the Stan
ford lead to 4-3 against Kunkel
(3-8), the loser, when Marquess
paged reliever Rick Dietz with
runners at the corners and one
out.
"Kunkel was beginning to get

the ball up (in the strike zone)
and I felt we'd get a ground ball
with Dietz," Marquess ex
plained. "He did, but it was a
base hit." The hit was Don
Wakamatsu's bouncer beyond
the reach of a leaping Dietz that
tied the game at 4-4. Dietz then
committed a throwing error in
trying to keep Wakamatsu close
at first base to allow Medina to
score the winning run. With the
loss Stanford finishes its season
with a 38-26-1 record.
Stanford could take some
consolation in placing three
players on the all-tournament
team: Lundblade, Stephens and
Jeff Ballard.
Lundblade blasted a home
run in each of the first two
games, his eighth and ninth of
the season, while going 7-for-13
with nine RBIs in the four
games. His homer in the first
game against Hawaii helped to
build an early 7-4 Cardinal ad
vantage. However, the Rain
bows, led by Kahai Shishido's
five hits and five RBIs, fought
back against Stanford ace John
Radtke.
Hawaii tallied three times in
the eighth and then won the
contest in the 10th against the
loser in relief. Rick Dietz (4-2).
Rainbow reliever Chuck Kane
stifled the Card for more than
four frames to record his fifth
victory in six decisions.
Faced with the task of win
ning four straight games in three
days, Stanford went to work be
hind southpaw Jeff Ballard.
Only a controversial muffed
third strike that put a WSU run
ner on first prevented a Ballard
shutout. The next Cougar hitter

laced an RBI double, one of
only four hits permitted in Bal
lard's complete game victory, to
put WSU on top 1-0 after two
innings.
Stanford struck once in the
fourth and Lundblade's two-run
round-tripper in the fifth iced
the win for Ballard (H-s)..To
gether with their 8-4 defeat by
ASU, the Cougers were
eliminated and finished the year
at 41-19.
Sunday afternoon's rematch
with Hawaii was Darryl Step
hens' day as the senior
centerfielder turned in the best
game of the tournament — and
the best game of his career — to
lead the Card to an 11-7 victory.
His perfect performance at the
plate helped to boost his tourna
ment totals to 9-for-14 with a
double and two triples to go
with his five RBls.
On the day, Stephens and
Lundblade went 8-for-10
against three Rainbow hurlers
with six RBIs and six runs
scored.
"(Stephens) had a great
tournament," Marquess said
Sunday night. "He had his
best season this year and coming
off a (knee) injury, that was
quite an accomplishment. He
does so many things, I don't
think we'll be able to replace
him."
The offensive explosion over
shadowed the strong pitching
performance of freshman Rob
Wassenaar, who made only his
third start of the season and
upped his record to 2-1. Was
senaar spaced 10 hits over BV3
innings before getting relief help
from Gregg Lomnicky. Hawaii
ended its campaign at 49-21-1.

Senior Daryl Stephens looks up to see if there is life after Stanford baseball. Stephens ended
his career as a Card player at the NCAA tourney over the weekend, and he ended it with
honors. The senior was named to the All-Tournament team for his performance in Tempe,
Ariz., along with Card teammates Rick Lundblade and jeff Ballard.
Tempt', Ariz. — Top-ranked
Arizona State ended the 1984
NCAA West II Regional Sun
day night just the way the home
town tans had wanted it to
all weekend — with a 5-4 vic
tory over Pacific-10 Southern
Division rival Stanford that
propelled the Sun Devils to the
College World Series for the
third time in four years.
The triumph boosted Arizona
State to 53-18 on the season,

Washington State and Hawaii
on Friday and Saturday nights

Devils to the deciding game.
