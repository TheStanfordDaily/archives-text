# Disappointing weekend for golfers
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
Neither the Stanford women's golf
team nor the men's squad did as well as it
had hoped in the weekend's NCAA
Championships, but both teams were
able to come back to the Farm with their
heads held high.
The women's team, ranked fourth in
the nation at the beginning of the week,
struggled with the unfamiliar Innisbrook
course in Tarpon Springs, Fla., all tourn
ament long, and finished Saturday's final
round in ninth place overall. Though
Coach Tim lialdwui liuU hoped lor bet
ter, he was by no means displeased with
his team's efforts.
"I don't feel real great about our
finish, but I don't feel too bad about it,
either," said Baldwin. "1 had hoped we
would finish in the top five, but under the
circumstances, ninth was pretty good."
One of the "circumstances" which
hurt the Stanford team in Innisbrook was
the course itself, "the toughest one we've
played all year," according to Baldwin.
The thick Bermuda grass used at In
nisbrook, although familiar to all the
Southeastern squads, was completely
foreign to the Westerners, and it cost the
Cardinal strokes on numerous occasions.
Another factor in the tournament was

the stamina-sapping Florida humidity.
The two Stanford swingers who were es
pecially affected hy the 90-degree heat
were sophomore Kathy Kostas and
senior Kathy Nino.
"Every day," said Baldwin, "Kostas
and Nino shot very well on the front
nine, and every day they just melted over
the last nine holes." The scoreboard
reflected their problems — All-WCAA
second-team selection Kostas shot a 31-
over-par 323 over four days, while Nino
finished with a dismal 4-2-over-par 334.
The success story of the tournament
for Stanford was undoubtably freshman
star Kathy McCarthy, now a near-certain
All-America selection. McCarthy roared
back from an opening-round 79 to finish
the tournament in a tie for fifth at 300,
only three strokes out of first place.
Two days after the tournament had
ended, McCarthy was still on cloud nine.
"Making the All-America team was one
of my big goals this year," said
McCarthy, "and now I honestly think I
deserve it. I'm so excited about the way I
played. I really can't wait to get home
and start working on my game some
more."
Sophomore Julie Carmichael, who

Baldwin said "probably out-putted
everyone in the tournament," finished
with a respectable 311, while junior
Diane Nixon wound up at 334.
The eventual NCAA team champion
was Miami, which finished at 1214,
seven strokes ahead of Arizona State.
On the individual side, Cindy Schreyer of
host team Georgia took home tourna
ment honors after surviving a three-way
playoff.
The men's team, unfortunately, was
not quite as successful as the Stanford
women. The Cardinal men played "fairly
mediocre" for the first three days, accor
ding to junior Scott Erickson, and they
paid for it by missing the cut for Satur
day's final round.
Erickson, however, was tied for 27th
after Friday, and so he was chosen to
play in Saturday's round as an individual.
He finished the tournament with a three
over-par 291, leaving him in a tie for
37th place overall.
"It wasn't that we were overmatched
by most of the teams," said Erickson af
terwards. "We really didn't have to play
all that much better to make the cut.
With the exception of a few teams at the
top, we were on a level with everyone
there."

Those "teams at the top" were indeed
playing on a level of their own. Host
team Houston won the tournament with
a team score of seven-under-par 1145,
followed closely by defending champion
Oklahoma State at 1146 and Oklahoma
at 1149.
The individuals at the top were equally
out of the range of Stanford's golfers —
North Carolina's John Inman won the
tournament with an incredible 17-under
par 271. No Stanford player besides
Erickson shot a sub-par round in Hous
ton.
One unexpected disappointment for
the Cardinal was red-shirt senior Tim
Robinson, usually Coach Tim Schaafs
most dependable player. He shot rounds
of 79-77-77, giving him the worst three
day total on the team.
"I just didn't play well," said Robin
son. "My mental game was fine — I'd
been in the NCAA Tournament before
— but my execution just wasn't very
good."
"Making the NCAA Tournament —
that was our accomplishment this year,"
said Erickson. "Next year, our goals are
going to be higher."
