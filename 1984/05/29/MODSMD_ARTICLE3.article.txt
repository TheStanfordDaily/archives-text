# Scientists to stage international march supporting Sakharov
## 
### 
Scientists worldwide are expected to take to
the streets tomorrow in support of Soviet
physicist Andrei Sakharov, who is now in the
27th day of a hunger strike he began in order
to force Soviet officials to allow his wife to
leave the country for medical care.
As part of International March of Scientists
Day, scientists in the United States, Western
Europe and parts of Asia are expected to
march on Soviet embassies and consulates to
morrow at noon local time to deliver identical
letters calling for the release of Sakharov
his wife, Yelena Bonner, to the West for
medical care.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center and a close
friend of the dissidents, helped write the letter

on behalf of the newly-proclaimed Interna
tional Coalition of Scientists for Sakharov
(ICSS), a Berkeley-based umbrella organiza
tion that includes a range of scientific groups
involved with human rights.
"1 don't know of anything like this ever
happening before. For scientists to coordinate
worldwide on such an issue is something
new," Drell, who is on sabbatical at Columbia
University in New York, said in a telephone
interview yesterday.
Morris Pripstein, a senior physicist at the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and head of
both ICSS and Scientists for Sakharov, Orlov
and Scharansky (SOS), concurred, saying sci
entists are expected to demonstrate in the
United States, Canada, Britain, France, Swit

zerland, Italy, West Germany, Japan and
Australia, and possibly in Mexico, Spain,
Bolivia and Brazil.
ICSS, an ad hoc group established this
weekend to organize tomorrow's march, in
cludes scientists from SOS as well as the Com
mittee of Concerned Scientists and the
Geneva-based Yuri Orlov Committee.
Another senior physicist at Lawrence
Berkeley, Michael Chanowitz, helped create
ICSS and serves on the SOS executive com
mittee. He said that prior to Sakharov's
hunger strike, the National Academy of
Sciences had proposed talks to talks between
the superpowers aimed at re-establishing joint
scientific research and exchanges â€” projects
suspended bv the Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan in 1979.

14 We want (Soviet officials) to know that the
possibility of restoring exchanges. . . (now)
depends on how the Soviets treat Sakharov,"
Chanowitz said.
On Thursday, the academies of science of
the United States, Britain, France and Sweden
sent a telegram to Anatoly Aleksandrov, head
of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, saying
"our final decision regarding engaging the
Soviets in discussions in Moscow in June will
be very much influenced by the positive
resolution of the Sakharovs' situation."
Philip Siegelmand, professor of political sci
ence at San Francisco State and SOS execu
tive committee secretary, said tomorrow's
march will bring that message to the steps of
Soviet consulates and embassies around the
world.

"We want the Soviet leadership to know
that the continued abuse of Sakharov could
ruin the prospects for scientific exchange for
years to come," Siegelman said.
Siegelman said he believes continued public
protest over Sakharov's condition is the only
way the Soviet physicist and his wife will be
freed.
"Given the heightening of the sense of con
sequence (for Soviet leaders), it's really hard
to believe that the Soviet Union . . . isn't very
unsure as to what to do" about Sakharov,
Siegelman said. "So we're obliged to keep
raising the ante."
In San Francisco, Stanford's Paul Flory,
emeritus professor of chemistry and a Nobel
laureate, is expected to join other scientists in
the march to the Soviet Consulate.
Tomorrow's protest comes at a time
when the condition of Sakharov and
Bonner remains mired in uncertaintv.
\ ladimir Bukovsky , a former Soviet
dissident living in Palo Alto, spec
ulates that Sakharov and Bonner are
being force-fed in a hospital.
A week ago. Georges Marchais, the
leader of France's Communist Party,
reported that the couple is under
"regular observation" in a Soviet
clinic near Gorky.
"The worst thing for the Soviet
Union would be lor Sakharov to die,"
Bukovsky said. But the precarious
state of Sakharov's health means that
the Nobel Peace Prize winner could
die despite force-feeding.
"He could have a heart attack at
any time." Bukovsky said.
Bukovsky, who describes his experi
ences in a Soviet prison camp in his
book. "To Build a Castle," said his
"biggest worry" is that Sakharov
didn't prepare adequately for his
hunger strike.
"I have been on hunger strikes

man\ times . . . the longest for 36
da\s," Bukovsky said. "It takes a lot
ot planning, and you need to the strike
going lor at least a month to have an
effect on Soviet authorities.
"It looks like (Sakharov) had a
sense of urgency when he began this
strike. And that's what scares me,"
Bukovsky said.
Bukovsky. who was exchanged by
the Soviets for the president of the
Chilean Communist Party in 1976.
said. "At this moment, I think that
only publicity can help" resolve the
Sakharov case.
"All this publicity will be recorded
by the Central Committee." he said.
But Bukovsky said the timing of
Sakharov's hunger strike couldn't
have been worse, given the Olympic
Boycott and aborted arms control
talks.
Sakharov, the father of the Soviet
hydrogen bomb who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1975. began his hunger
strike on May 2.
Bonner, who was arrested recently
for "defaming the Soviet system," is
also on a hunger strike. Bonner also
suffers from heart and eye ailments for
which she previously has been allowed
to travel to Moscow and Italy to ob
tain treatment.
