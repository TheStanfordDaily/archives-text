# Round Two housing results in
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The new Governor's Corner residences continue to
make their mark on the undergraduate housing Draw, as a
record number of students reached the assignable pool
after the second round.
Round Two results, which will be announced this mor
ning. show an assignable pool cutoff of 2479 in the un
guaranteed pool for women and 1307 in the unguaranteed
pool for men. Last year those numbers were 1377 for wo
men and 1026 for men.
Roughly 250 students dropped out of the Draw after
Round One. including about 200 males who opted to live
in fraternities, according to Rodger Whitney, assistant
dean of Student Affairs and director of the Housing Cen
ter.
"I think we had a stable number of students dropping
out . . . and more students accepted their Round One as
signments." Whitney said.
Still unfilled are 28 spaces in three residences requiring
special priorities. French House has three vacancies for
men. Synergy has six tor men, and Terra has 1 1 for men
and eight for women.
Students who plan to join the waiting list may obtain
necessary priorities until June 8.
Whitney said the new waiting-list policy should give stu
dents a better estimate of their chances for getting into
various residences. Under the new system, original Draw
numbers will determine the order of assignment for all stu
dents who place their names on the waiting list by June 8.

Undergraduates who join the list after that day will be
considered by their date of entry.
Students who wish t. accept their Round Two assign
ment must fill out and return their Draw Card Three by
June 8.
In the graduate housing Draw, more than 1400 of the
1688 new and continuing students in the Draw received
assignments.
And when the next round of graduate assignments is
completed, which should be around July 9, nearly every
student in the Draw will be housed, Whitney said.
"This year's (graduate Draw) was by far the best lottery
we've had in terms of people getting their first choices,"
Whitney said. "Escondido Village filled entirely with
people who listed it as their first choice."
Because the graduate Draw gives new students priority
over continuing students, 54 percent of the spaces were as
signed to new students although they constituted only 46
percent of the applicant pool.
In total, 98 percent of new students and 74 percent of
continuing students were assigned housing. Ninety-two
percent of those assigned received their first choice.
All new graduate students who said they would live
anywhere on campus were assigned housing. Whitney said,
but he added that new students did not fill any residences
by themselves.
" I here is a good mix ot new and continuing students in
the co-ops, Whitney said. "We were worried that there
would only be new students there, but that just isn't the
case."
