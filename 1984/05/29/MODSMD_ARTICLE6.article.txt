# Center to aid relations with manufacturers
## 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
Spurred by a $2 million grant from IBM last
summer, the University has created an organiza
tion to help facilitate interaction between Stanford
and industrial manufacturers.
The Stanford Institute for Manufacturing and
Automation (SIMA) will be funded primarily by
industrial manufacturers, and it will serve as an
umbrella organization for several research and
educational organizations on campus.
Prof. Robert Cannon, head of the Aeronautics
and Astronautics Department, will serve as chair
man of the steering committee of SIMA. "We had
been talking about developing this kind of activity

for about three years," he said. "We were
precipitated into action by IBM."
"SIMA evolved because it became clear that a
broad spectrum of companies that do manufactur
ing have been expressing an interest to u:; to teach
manufacturing here and that research be carried
out in manufacturing," Cannon said.
"SIMA was created in order to interact effec
tively with these sponsors," Cannon said.
Though SIMA presently involves only engineer
ing departments and the Department of Computer
Science. Cannon said. "There is no reason it only
be restricted that way in the future. There is no in
tent to restrict it that way."

The four-member centers which are presently in
SI MA are the Center for Teaching and Research
in Integrated Manufacturing Systems (CTRIMS),
the Center for Design Research, the Center for
Materials Formability and the Center for Automa
tion and Manufacturing Science (CAMS).
Prof. Elliot Levinthal of Stanford's Medical
Center was named as SIMA director. Levinthal,
who is now in Sweeden and could not be reached
for comment, served for three years as service
director of the Defense Sciences Office with the
Defense Advanced Projects Agency.
The seven-member steering committee for
SIM A. which has been established,
will be comprised of Cannon. l.e\ in
thai. Prof. Thomas Binford of the
Computer Science Department and
co-director of CAMS: Prof Charles
Kruger. chairman ot the Mechanical
Engineering Department: t'rot. War
ren Hausman. chairman ol the De
partment of Industrial Engineering:
Associate Prof. Larry Leifer ot the
Mechanical Engineering Department:
and Prof. Von Eshleman. associate
dean of Engineering for research.
Cannon said the steering committee
was comprised of the directors of the
representative centers.
Steering committee member Bin
ford said the committee wanted to
avoid bureaucracy.
"We (the steering commitee) for
mulated the operating rules and the
general bylaws of SIMA," Binford
said. "We will act on matters of gen
eral policy. Basically, we hope things
will run smoothly, and we won't have
to do too much."
In addition to the steering commit
tee. an Industrial Advisory Committee

composed ot high-level executives in
the sponsoring companies will be
formed.
The function ot the Industrial Advi
sory Committee will he two-told. Bin
lord said. It will help in fund raising
and provide "guidance for research
programs." he said.
The grant offered by IBM is a four
year grant which was provided lor the
master's program in CI RIMS. Can
non said.
rhough IBM is the only manufac
turer which had already given nionev
lo SIMA. Cannon said both l-'ord and
General Motors have made pledges.
Me said the eventual number ot spon
soring companies could reach between
2(1 and 25.
"What the companies get is the
benefit from the educational aspect,
that is students specializing in this
area, and they will have early access to
research results coming out of the
various centers." Cannon said.
Steering committee member Kruger
said the function of the sponsoring
companies would he strictly
"advisory."
SIMA will not he housed in a new
building. Binford said, as it is com
prised of centers which are already lo
cated on campus.
