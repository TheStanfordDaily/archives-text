### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
Spurred by a $2 million grant from IBM last
summer, the University has created an organiza
tion to help facilitate interaction between Stanford
and industrial manufacturers.
The Stanford Institute for Manufacturing and
Automation (SIMA) will be funded primarily by
industrial manufacturers, and it will serve as an
umbrella organization for several research and
educational organizations on campus.
Prof. Robert Cannon, head of the Aeronautics
and Astronautics Department, will serve as chair
man of the steering committee of SIMA. "We had
been talking about developing this kind of activity

for about three years," he said. "We were
precipitated into action by IBM."
"SIMA evolved because it became clear that a
broad spectrum of companies that do manufactur
ing have been expressing an interest to u:; to teach
manufacturing here and that research be carried
out in manufacturing," Cannon said.
"SIMA was created in order to interact effec
tively with these sponsors," Cannon said.
Though SIMA presently involves only engineer
ing departments and the Department of Computer
Science. Cannon said. "There is no reason it only
be restricted that way in the future. There is no in
tent to restrict it that way."

The four-member centers which are presently in
SI MA are the Center for Teaching and Research
in Integrated Manufacturing Systems (CTRIMS),
the Center for Design Research, the Center for
Materials Formability and the Center for Automa
tion and Manufacturing Science (CAMS).
Prof. Elliot Levinthal of Stanford's Medical
Center was named as SIMA director. Levinthal,
who is now in Sweeden and could not be reached
for comment, served for three years as service
director of the Defense Sciences Office with the
Defense Advanced Projects Agency.
