Saudis take delivery of missiles
Washington — An emergency U.S. supply of Stinger anti
aircraft missiles has arrived in Saudi Arabia as the Reagan ad
ministration prepares to make public statements today un
veiling its military and diplomatic policies on the escalating
Iran-Iraq war.
I he 400 shoulder-tired Stinger missiles and 200 launchers
tor them were flown to»Saudi Arabia over the weekend, ac
cording to knowledgeable sources.
While the shipment had been expected since the middle of
last week, the numbers of missiles and launchers were
doubled at the last minute after U.S. evaluation of defense re
quirements tor installations in eastern Saudi Arabia, officials
said. The administration sources denied a report that the
Saudis made an 1 lth-hour plea for the increase.
I he same statements are expected to announce that the
United States is providing U.S. Air Force KC-10 aerial
tankers for in-flight refueling of Saudi Arabia's F-15 jet
lighters, thus extending their range and ability to stay on air
borne patrol for long periods.
U.S. crews will man the tankers on special assignment, with
the Saudis paying the bills as the;, have done with the U.S.
Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) planes and
KC-135 refueling planes on assignment there since the Iran-
Iraq war began in September 19N0.
The diplomatic dimension of U.S. policy is expected to be
discussed in a speech to the U.N. Security Council, which
resumes debate today on a drive by Saudi Arabia and other
Arab gulf nations to condemn Iran for attacks on neutral
ships.
Unknown soldier buried
Washington — Under somber skies, with his country's
highest honors and the prayers of many faiths, an unidentified
serviceman of the Vietnam War was committed to eternal rest
yesterday. And so, he took his place with the dead of three
other wars in this century who are "known but to God."
President Reagan led the nation's tribute for the Unknown
Serviceman of Vietnam, bestowing the nation's highest mili
tary decoration, the Medal of Honor.
As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he saluted the
coffin as the funeral ended. As president of the United States,
he was considered the next of kin for a fallen warrior of whom
no next of kin is known and he received the flag that covered
the coffin.
"The unknown soldier who has returned to us today and
whom we lay to rest is symbolic of all our missing sons," said
Reagan. The eulogy was delivered in the white marble amphi
theater of Arlington National Cemetery behind the Tomb of
the Unknowns. U.S. flags fluttered between the colonnades
and 4000 people stood as the National Anthem began the fu
neral service.
"Today we pause, to embrace him and all who served us so
well in a war whose end offered no parades, no flags, and so
little thanks," the president said.
Thousands rally for strike
Bonn. West Germany — Tens of Thousands of West Ger
man trade unionists took part in a rally here yesterday to
press demands for a 35-hour work week and unemployment
compensation for non-striking workers idled by a walkout in
the critical metalworking industry that entered its third week
with no sign of a breakthrough.
Union leaders claimed the rally at a city center park drew
250,000 protesters, despite the damp, chilly weather. Inde
pendent estimates placed the figure at closer to 150,000,
lower by 50,000 than trade union leaders had forecast.
The demand for unemployment benefits grew out of a deci
sion by the federal labor office that denies such compensation
to workers who have been locked out by employers or other
wise unable to work as a result of the strike. That decision has
eroded support for the strike, which has always had question
able backing among the union's rank and file.
Despite that and other indications, including public opinion
polls pointing to less than full support for the strikers' effort
for a five-hour cut in the workweek with no reduction in pay,
statements by union leaders yesterday showed no hint of
compromise.
Chairman Ernst Breit of the West German Federation of
Trade Unions threatened a national solidarity strike by the
body's 17-member unions if employers do not lift their lock
outs.
Candidates even in California
Los Angeles —With California's primary only eight days
away. Democratic presidential hopefuls Walter Mondale and
Gary Hart are running neck and neck, but still behind Ronald
Reagan, according to a new poll published yesterday in the
Los Angeles Times.
The poll shows that of Democrats likely to cast ballots June
5, 29 percent favor Hart and 28 percent support Mondale,
with 11 percent leaning toward the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
In addition, 22 percent remained undecided and the other
10 percent chose either to vote for other candidates or didn't
specify how they would vote in the Democratic presidential
race.
Hart, a senator from Colorado, had been hoping to have a
considerable lead in the polls before the election to sway the
sizable undecided vote in his battle with former Vice Presi
dent Mondale.
The poll did support Hart's contention he would be
stronger than Mondale against President Reagan — although
both Hart and Mondale would lose to Reagan.
If the general election were held today, the poll showed
Reagan would get 50 percent of the California vote compared
with Hart's 45 percent. But Reagan would beat Mondale 53
percqnt to 40 percent.
Smog may form acid
Fullerton — A "rather nasty" air pollutant capable of
creating hydrochloric acid in people's lungs may pose a health
risk to people living in smoggy. coastal areas like the Los An
geles Basin, a researcher says.
"We're not sure there is a danger," said Barbira Finlayson-
Pitts. a chemistry professor at the University of California's
Fullerton campus. "... But we do know there is the potential
for a problem."
With grants from the National Science Foundation.
Finlavson-Pitts is studying the chemical reaction that occurs
when salty coastal air mixes with pollution from cars and in
dustrial plants.
Her initial research has shown that under some conditions,
salt air and a common air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide, unite to
form a toxic, corrosive gas called nitrosyl chloride.
"Nitrosyl chloride, when it hits your lungs, reacts and forms
hydrochloric acid," Finlayson-Pitts said. "So certainly breath
ing a lot of that gas is something you don't want to do."
The researcher is trying to determine if dangerous amounts
of nitrosyl chloride form in urban coastal areas, how it reacts
in the air with other substances, how it disappears from the air
and whether it does so in a benign way or goes on to form
other pollutants.
The smog-plagued Los Angeles Basin could be especially
vulnerable, Finlayson-Pitts said.
