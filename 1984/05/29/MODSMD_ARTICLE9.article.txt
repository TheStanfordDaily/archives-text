U.S. assesses (iulf stance
Violence in the Persian Gulf continued last
week with attacks on nine ships and the in
creasingly dangerous situation prompted a
review ol U.S. interests and potential
responses.
Iraq claimed to have hit six ships near Iran
after Iran attacked two Saudi and Kuwaiti
tankers. The Iranian raids appeared to be in
response to an Iraqi attack on two tankers
near Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal.
The damaging of 27 ships in the gulf since
April has fostered concern over the safety of
oil supplies, but U.S. concerns in the gulf arc
more political than economic.
The U.S. imports only 3 percent of its oil
from the Persian Gulf and that supply has
been unaffected. At the moment, no shipping
routes are actually in danger of closing, and.
except for minor cutbacks in Iranian exports,
the oil flow has continued unabated and with
no dramatic price increases.
The major American concern is preserving
political stability in the gulf region. The
United States wants to curb the spread of
Iran's version of Islamic fundamentalism and
to prevent the governments of the radical gulf
states from being destabilized.
Toward that end, the United States will
probably not become directly involved
militarily. Officials insist that they are not
looking to send American forces into the gulf
out of fear for the repercussions such an ac

tion could have in an election year. The
likelihood of American troops becoming in
volved in a shooting war in the region in the
near future is "I think very slight and I can't
foresee that happening," said President
Reagan in a press conference Tuesday.
Death squads dominate Salvadoran news
Death squads were in the forefront of news
on El Salvador last week. In Washington last
Sunday, President-elect Jose Napoleon
Duarte said he would name an independent
presidential commission to investigate death
squad killings and past cases of political vio
lence. In London last Monday, Amnesty In
ternational linked the government to the
deaths of many of the 40,000 people mur
dered there in the last five years. And, in El
Salvador on Thursday, a jury convicted five
former national guardsmen of killing four
American churchwomen in 1980.
After Duarte said that he has "the guts" to
end death-squad violence, the House voted
Thursday to approve $62 million in emer
gency military aid to the country.
Duarte said the commission will report di
rectly to him and will probe the murders of
two U.S. labor advisers in 1981 and of Arch
bishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero in 1980 as well
as the origins and funding of the death squads.
"If the government has the will to investi
gate, a will to prosecute (political criminals),
then the country will go back to the structure

of discipline," Duarte said.
In a 48-page report issued last week, Am
nesty International presented the results of its
investigations of El Salvador's death squads.
It is the "authorities themselves who lie be
hind the wholesale extrajudicial executions,"
charged the London-based human rights
group, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1977.
Government involvement was implied by
the "blatant failure" of the authorites to in
vestigate the killings said the group. Amnesty
also said that the authorities' intimidation of
lawyers, medical examiners and witnesses,
manipulation of evidence and refusal to
cooperate with international agencies seeking
to identify the killers, pointed to government
involvement.
A verdict was finally reached in a case of
the murders of four American nuns in 1980 â€”
a case that became symbolic of EI Salvador's
human rights abuses. After a 20-hour trial,
3'/ 2 years of pressure from Washington, and
the presentation of evidence meticulously
gathered and pieced together by the FBI, a
jury convicted five former national
guardsmen.
Relatives of the dead women called the
conviction a good first step toward learning
who ordered the killing and who tried to cover
it up.
A U.S. Embassy statement said "the suc
cessful prosecution of these murderers shows

the Salvadoran criminal justice system can he
made to work."
Investigation finds no smoke
"We have a warm barrel, but the smoke
remains to be found," concluded the chairman
of a 10-month congressional investigation into
charges of political espionage during the 19S0
presidential debate.
The House subcommittee, chaired by Rep.
Donald Albosta (D-Mich.), reached no
"definitive conclusions," but pointed out that
conflicting testimony by two Reagan aides
does not favor CIA Director William Casey's
account.
White House Chief of Staff James Baker,
Reagan's debate manager in the 19K0 cam
paign, swore that he recalled Carter campaign
documents arriving from Casey's office. Casey
denies ever having had anything to do with the
papers, but the report said that other evidence
collaborates with Baker's account better than
with Casey's.
Casey called the report "clearly a partisan
document in a political year."
But, whoever, if anyone, is eventually in
dicted, the fact remains that certain papers
from the Carter campaign ended up in the
hands of Reagan strategists as they prepared
the 1980 Carter-Reagan debate.
As of last week, Reagan had not personally
involved himself in the controversy.

received debate papers from President
Carter's 1980 campaign.
