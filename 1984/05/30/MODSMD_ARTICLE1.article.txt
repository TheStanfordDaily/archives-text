Bicycle jousters
Freshman Mike Thottungal
(white shirt) and Twain RA
Andy Cargile (white socks and
headband) engage in a modern
version of medieval jousting
yesterday afternoon on Wilbur
Field. Cargile won the contest,
7-2, and plans another round of
competition either Friday or
Saturday. Their six-foot lances
are made of padded plastic
tubing, enabling both knights to
live to joust another day.
Cargile is a member of the Soci
ety for Creative Anachronism,
which staged several battles on
foot in full medieval armor ear
lier in the year. Warm spring
weather has made it uncom
fortable to wear full medieval
costumes in recent weeks, but
the bicycle battles involve
modified costumes more
suitable for spring competition.
