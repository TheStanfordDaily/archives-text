# Soviet official refuses comment on Sakharov case
## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Moscow â€” Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko yes
terday bluntly rejected an at
tempt by visiting Australian
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden to
discuss the case of Andrei Sak
harov and his wife.
Hayden told reporters that
Gromyko refused a request for
information on Sakharov's
health and would not discuss the
dissident nuclear physicist's fast
on grounds that it was an inter

nal Soviet affair.
The Soviet authorities,
Hayden quoted Gromyko as
saying, "will not be told how to
deal with the Sakharovs by
other countries." Saying that
"the conversation on this sub
ject ends here." Gromyko then
terminated the dialogue.
Hayden said he raised the
issue during the last of four
meetings with Gromyko, ex
pressing concern about their
fate and asking about their pres

ent condition. He said Gromyko
became visibly irritated for the
first time during their meetings.
The 63-year-old Sakharov
began a hunger strike on May 2
to press demands for medical
treatment in the West for his
wife Yelena Bonner. He was
taken from his apartment in
Gorky, to which he was
banished more than four years
ago, and presumably hospi
talized on May 7.
Friends of the Sakharovs in

Moscow said they believe Bon
ner later began a hunger strike,
too, although this could not be
confirmed. Some dissident
sources said yesterday they
believed that Bonner may also
have been hospitalized, as
travelers coming from Gorky
reported they did not see lights
in the Sakharov apartment
there.
Members of the Sakharov
family in Moscow, who met with

reporters, said they had no in
formation about Sakharov's
condition.
Diplomatic analysts here at
tached significance to the fact
that Gromyko, while telling
Haydcn that the Soviet govern
ment "will not discuss this with
anybody," made a specific ref
erence to "the Sakharovs." This
was taken as an indication that
they both were alive and that
their situation was not grave.
