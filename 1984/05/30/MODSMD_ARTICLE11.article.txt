# Hart and Jackson campaigns unite against Mondale
## 
### 
Washington - The campaigns of Sen Gary
Hart (D-Colo.) and Jesse Jackson are joining
forces against Walter Mondale in at least a
dozen states, accusing the former vice presi
dent of "playing hardball" in his drive for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
Campaign officials for Hart and Jackson in
sist that the alliance is not part of a national
strategy to stop Mondale. But they acknowl
edge that an attempt last weekend to assert
control oyer the Georgia delegation to the
Democratic National C onvention is only one
of a dozen instances in which their forces are

arrayed against Mondale's in state party
proceedings.
In Georgia, Hart and Jackson delegates
united against Mondale forces in an attempt
to control the naming of the chairman of the
state s delegation to the convention. The at
tempt tailed when Mondale supporters
stormed out in protest before a vote could be
taken.
But Hart and Jackson forces, working in
concert, have been successful in several other
states, according to Oliver Henkel, Hart's
campaign manager, and Arnold Pinkney,
Jackson's campaign manager. They have in
creased the delegate strengths of their candi'
dates as well as the candidates' representation
on important convention committees, both
men said.
"We have made a lot of deals at the conven
tion level to strengthen their delegate stand
ings and ours," Henkel said.
A Hart-Jackson alliance, in addition to
posing another hurdle for Mondale, could
presage a bitter credentials fight that would
leave the Democratic Party in disarray for the
general election.
Hart and Jackson together have outpolled
Mondale in delegate strength in 22 states,
which could make a convention fight espe
cially divisive. A tabulation by United Press
International shows Hart and Jackson leading
Mondale in those states by 628 to 398
delegates, while Mondale leads Hart and
Jackson in 21 states by 1014 delegates to 508.
Hart and Jackson have hinted that they may
challenge the seating of some Mondale
delegates on grounds that money was illegally
used by delegate selection committees to elect
them.
Calling the Georgia incident "the kind of
thing that's going on on a daily basis," Henkel
said that the Hart and Jackson camps also
have worked together in lowa, Missouri and
Wisconsin. They "are attempting to do it" in
Indiana, Mississippi, Virginia, Kansas, Ten
nessee, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Alaska, he

said.
Most of the cooperative ventures involve
caucus states that have "threshhold" rules re
quiring that a candidate get a certain mini
mum vote — 20 percent of the total, for ex
ample — before he can qualify for any
delegates. "There are myriad ways you can
bargain," Henkel said. "One way is to help
the other candidate get enough votes to meet
the threshhold. You can work for a position
on the rules committee or another committee.
Or you could even get a pledge for delegates
to vote a certain way on a second ballot."
Although he denied Hart and Jackson are
waging a concerted campaign to prevent
Mondale from getting the nomination, Henkel
conceded that the "net effect" of the alliance
"is to stop Mondale
Pinkney, Jackson's campaign manager, said
he is looking to Hart for support "on some of
the challenges we're making on credentials"
— and that Hart probably expects support
from Jackson on any challenges he makes.

Labor decries Mondale connection
Washington — As the Democratic
presidential candidates go into their last
tango, even some labor leaders are complain
ing that Mondale has jeopardized his political
footing by dancing too close to them.
On the eve of the Ohio primary May 8, a
top national AFL-CIO official musing about
Mondale's repeated refusal to distance him
self from organized labor said, "I personally
think he screwed up, the way he handled it.
Now it's too late. Now he's stuck with it."
Then he shrugged.
"That's Fritz."
After Hart defeated Mondale narrowly in

Ohio and Indiana, the top political official of a
major union said Hart's attempts to paint
Mondale as a captive of "special interests"
such as labor was beginning to hit home.
"For the first time, my gut is tightening up
on this issue," he said.
Looking toward a tough general election
fight against President Reagan, he suggested
one way for Mondale to dramatize his inde
pendence of labor: not to confer with labor
leaders on the choice of his running mate.
"I don't think we ought to be asked," he
said.
With Jackson drawing most of the black
voters, labor's prominence in the Democratic
coalition backing Mondale has been thrown
into stark relief.
Mondale's ties to organized labor often are
cited as one of his greatest weaknesses in exit
polls of voters, editorials and the comments of
prominent Democrats.
Former Democratic Party chairman Robert
Strauss, a Mondale backer, says Mondale has

gotten a "hum rap" with the special-interest
issue, partly because the candidate has mis
handled it, partly because the press has blown
it out of proportion.
"And Fritz is left with egg on his face," he
said.
Mondale in fact differs from labor on
several issues, including immigration policy,
the MX missile and the B-l bomber. But he
has refused to dramatize the fact, going out of
his way instead to emphasize his sensitivity to
the concerns of "working men and women."
"We're mature and sophisticated enough to
know it could have been done differently and
better," AFL-CIO spokesman Murray Seeger

said of Mondale's handling of the special
interest issue. Some aides said they believe
API.-CIO President Lane Kirkland shares
this view, although he has not criticized
Mondale publicly.
Others echoed Rachelle Horowitz, political
director of the American Federation of
Teachers, who believes it is silly to expect
Mondale to "slap labor around."
"I've been surprised at how tough Mondale
has been in some ways," she said. "Instead of
pontificating about what Mondale's campaign
strategy should be, labor people should con
centrate on getting our people out to vote."
Labor leaders also acknowledge that part of
the problem is, as one put it, "we have a lousy
image."
The.controversy is sharpened by the AFL-
ClO's unprecedented pre-primary endorse
ment of a candidate and its intensified partici
pation in the nominating process.
Mondale supporters expected his union ties
to become an issue, but they expected it to be

raised by Republicans in the general election
and not by Democrats.
Hart probes Mondale money
Somerville, N.J. — Hart Monday raised the
possibility of a Justice Department investiga
tion and a fight at the Democratic National
Convention over Mondale's use of "tainted
money" in his campaign and said such moves
could cost the Democrats the election.
Hart said money used by Mondale delegate
committees may result in the selection of
"illegal delegates" in the final round of prima
ries June 5 as well as in earlier contests.

Hart has repeatedly criticized Mondale on
the issue,.but had never before publicly raised
the possibility of a convention floor fight or a
Justice Department investigation.
"Think of what might happen after a con
vention in which Mr. Mondale achieved the
nomination and a Justice Department investi
gation was launched," Hart said at a news
conference here. "That could be the whole fall
election.
"I don't think we want to field a candidate
in the fall with a question like that hanging
over his head," he said.
Mondale, also campaigning in New Jersey,
was asked about Hart's charge as well as
reports indicating that delegate committees
are still operating in his name, despite his re
quest that they be closed down.
"I don't know of a single one that's active,"
he said. "There are five states in conflict on
June 5. Not a single one of them has a single
committee in them." He said newspaper
reports had identified "one remaining
moribund committee which is neither receiv
ing nor expending funds.
"I think this is a piece of a larger pattern
that's been demonstrated recently by Gary
Hart," Mondale added. "He is substantially
behind — nearly 700 delegates behind now.
. . . I think he's trying to develop some scheme
for getting delegates that have been elected to
represent Walter Mondale at that convention,
and I don't think it's going to work."
Candidates focus on California
With the exception of a one-day trip by
Hart back to New Jersey next week, all three
contenders for the Democratic nomination for
president plan to spend at least a part of every
day through June 5 in California.
Mondale also plans a final visit to New Jer
sey, which also holds a primary June 5 to elect
107 delegates. But the former vice president is
scheduled to spend better than MO percent of
the remaining campaign time in California,
which will elect 306 delegates next Tuesday.
New Mexico, where Jackson was campaign
ing Tuesday; West Virginia and South Dakota
also have primaries June 5. but between them,
they elect only 73 delegates.
Representing President Reagan, who is un
opposed on the Republican ballot. Vice Presi
dent George Bush also scheduled California
appearances next Monday and Tuesday.
The highlight of the next week of campaign
ing in California will be a debate Sunday at
the KNBC studios in Burbank, bringing the
three major contenders face-to-face for the
last time in the four-month primary season.

from Jackson on any challenges he makes.

Labor decries Mondale connection
Washington — As the Democratic
presidential candidates go into their last
tango, even some labor leaders are complain
ing that Mondale has jeopardized his political
footing by dancing too close to them.
On the eve of the Ohio primary May 8, a
top national AFL-CIO official musing about
Mondale's repeated refusal to distance him
self from organized labor said, "I personally
think he screwed up, the way he handled it.
Now it's too late. Now he's stuck with it."
Then he shrugged.
"That's Fritz."
After Hart defeated Mondale narrowly in

Ohio and Indiana, the top political official of a
major union said Hart's attempts to paint
Mondale as a captive of "special interests"
such as labor was beginning to hit home.
"For the first time, my gut is tightening up
on this issue," he said.
Looking toward a tough general election
fight against President Reagan, he suggested
one way for Mondale to dramatize his inde
pendence of labor: not to confer with labor
leaders on the choice of his running mate.
"I don't think we ought to be asked," he
said.
With Jackson drawing most of the black
voters, labor's prominence in the Democratic
coalition backing Mondale has been thrown
into stark relief.
Mondale's ties to organized labor often are
cited as one of his greatest weaknesses in exit
polls of voters, editorials and the comments of
prominent Democrats.
Former Democratic Party chairman Robert
Strauss, a Mondale backer, says Mondale has

gotten a "hum rap" with the special-interest
issue, partly because the candidate has mis
handled it, partly because the press has blown
it out of proportion.
"And Fritz is left with egg on his face," he
said.
Mondale in fact differs from labor on
several issues, including immigration policy,
the MX missile and the B-l bomber. But he
has refused to dramatize the fact, going out of
his way instead to emphasize his sensitivity to
the concerns of "working men and women."
"We're mature and sophisticated enough to
know it could have been done differently and
better," AFL-CIO spokesman Murray Seeger

said of Mondale's handling of the special
interest issue. Some aides said they believe
API.-CIO President Lane Kirkland shares
this view, although he has not criticized
Mondale publicly.
Others echoed Rachelle Horowitz, political
director of the American Federation of
Teachers, who believes it is silly to expect
Mondale to "slap labor around."
"I've been surprised at how tough Mondale
has been in some ways," she said. "Instead of
pontificating about what Mondale's campaign
strategy should be, labor people should con
centrate on getting our people out to vote."
Labor leaders also acknowledge that part of
the problem is, as one put it, "we have a lousy
image."
The.controversy is sharpened by the AFL-
ClO's unprecedented pre-primary endorse
ment of a candidate and its intensified partici
pation in the nominating process.
Mondale supporters expected his union ties
to become an issue, but they expected it to be

raised by Republicans in the general election
and not by Democrats.
Hart probes Mondale money
Somerville, N.J. — Hart Monday raised the
possibility of a Justice Department investiga
tion and a fight at the Democratic National
Convention over Mondale's use of "tainted
money" in his campaign and said such moves
could cost the Democrats the election.
Hart said money used by Mondale delegate
committees may result in the selection of
"illegal delegates" in the final round of prima
ries June 5 as well as in earlier contests.

Hart has repeatedly criticized Mondale on
the issue,.but had never before publicly raised
the possibility of a convention floor fight or a
Justice Department investigation.
"Think of what might happen after a con
vention in which Mr. Mondale achieved the
nomination and a Justice Department investi
gation was launched," Hart said at a news
conference here. "That could be the whole fall
election.
"I don't think we want to field a candidate
in the fall with a question like that hanging
over his head," he said.
Mondale, also campaigning in New Jersey,
was asked about Hart's charge as well as
reports indicating that delegate committees
are still operating in his name, despite his re
quest that they be closed down.
"I don't know of a single one that's active,"
he said. "There are five states in conflict on
June 5. Not a single one of them has a single
committee in them." He said newspaper
reports had identified "one remaining
moribund committee which is neither receiv
ing nor expending funds.
"I think this is a piece of a larger pattern
that's been demonstrated recently by Gary
Hart," Mondale added. "He is substantially
behind — nearly 700 delegates behind now.
. . . I think he's trying to develop some scheme
for getting delegates that have been elected to
represent Walter Mondale at that convention,
and I don't think it's going to work."
Candidates focus on California
With the exception of a one-day trip by
Hart back to New Jersey next week, all three
contenders for the Democratic nomination for
president plan to spend at least a part of every
day through June 5 in California.
Mondale also plans a final visit to New Jer
sey, which also holds a primary June 5 to elect
107 delegates. But the former vice president is
scheduled to spend better than MO percent of
the remaining campaign time in California,
which will elect 306 delegates next Tuesday.
New Mexico, where Jackson was campaign
ing Tuesday; West Virginia and South Dakota
also have primaries June 5. but between them,
they elect only 73 delegates.
Representing President Reagan, who is un
opposed on the Republican ballot. Vice Presi
dent George Bush also scheduled California
appearances next Monday and Tuesday.
The highlight of the next week of campaign
ing in California will be a debate Sunday at
the KNBC studios in Burbank, bringing the
three major contenders face-to-face for the
last time in the four-month primary season.

Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart's campaign committees have combined to oppose the efforts of the Mondale campaign.

Washington - The campaigns of Sen Gary
Hart (D-Colo.) and Jesse Jackson are joining
forces against Walter Mondale in at least a
dozen states, accusing the former vice presi
dent of "playing hardball" in his drive for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
Campaign officials for Hart and Jackson in
sist that the alliance is not part of a national
strategy to stop Mondale. But they acknowl
edge that an attempt last weekend to assert
control oyer the Georgia delegation to the
Democratic National C onvention is only one
of a dozen instances in which their forces are

arrayed against Mondale's in state party
proceedings.
In Georgia, Hart and Jackson delegates
united against Mondale forces in an attempt
to control the naming of the chairman of the
state s delegation to the convention. The at
tempt tailed when Mondale supporters
stormed out in protest before a vote could be
taken.
But Hart and Jackson forces, working in
concert, have been successful in several other
states, according to Oliver Henkel, Hart's
campaign manager, and Arnold Pinkney,
Jackson's campaign manager. They have in
creased the delegate strengths of their candi'
dates as well as the candidates' representation
on important convention committees, both
men said.
"We have made a lot of deals at the conven
tion level to strengthen their delegate stand
ings and ours," Henkel said.
A Hart-Jackson alliance, in addition to
posing another hurdle for Mondale, could
presage a bitter credentials fight that would
leave the Democratic Party in disarray for the
general election.
Hart and Jackson together have outpolled
Mondale in delegate strength in 22 states,
which could make a convention fight espe
cially divisive. A tabulation by United Press
International shows Hart and Jackson leading
Mondale in those states by 628 to 398
delegates, while Mondale leads Hart and
Jackson in 21 states by 1014 delegates to 508.
Hart and Jackson have hinted that they may
challenge the seating of some Mondale
delegates on grounds that money was illegally
used by delegate selection committees to elect
them.
Calling the Georgia incident "the kind of
thing that's going on on a daily basis," Henkel
said that the Hart and Jackson camps also
have worked together in lowa, Missouri and
Wisconsin. They "are attempting to do it" in
Indiana, Mississippi, Virginia, Kansas, Ten
nessee, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Alaska, he

said.
Most of the cooperative ventures involve
caucus states that have "threshhold" rules re
quiring that a candidate get a certain mini
mum vote — 20 percent of the total, for ex
ample — before he can qualify for any
delegates. "There are myriad ways you can
bargain," Henkel said. "One way is to help
the other candidate get enough votes to meet
the threshhold. You can work for a position
on the rules committee or another committee.
Or you could even get a pledge for delegates
to vote a certain way on a second ballot."
Although he denied Hart and Jackson are
waging a concerted campaign to prevent
Mondale from getting the nomination, Henkel
conceded that the "net effect" of the alliance
"is to stop Mondale
Pinkney, Jackson's campaign manager, said
he is looking to Hart for support "on some of
the challenges we're making on credentials"
— and that Hart probably expects support
from Jackson on any challenges he makes.

tion and a fight at the Democratic National
Convention over Mondale's use of "tainted
money" in his campaign and said such moves
could cost the Democrats the election.
Hart said money used by Mondale delegate
committees may result in the selection of
"illegal delegates" in the final round of prima
ries June 5 as well as in earlier contests.

Hart has repeatedly criticized Mondale on
the issue,.but had never before publicly raised
the possibility of a convention floor fight or a
Justice Department investigation.
"Think of what might happen after a con
vention in which Mr. Mondale achieved the
nomination and a Justice Department investi
gation was launched," Hart said at a news
conference here. "That could be the whole fall
election.
"I don't think we want to field a candidate
in the fall with a question like that hanging
over his head," he said.
Mondale, also campaigning in New Jersey,
was asked about Hart's charge as well as
reports indicating that delegate committees
are still operating in his name, despite his re
quest that they be closed down.
"I don't know of a single one that's active,"
he said. "There are five states in conflict on
June 5. Not a single one of them has a single
committee in them." He said newspaper
reports had identified "one remaining
moribund committee which is neither receiv
ing nor expending funds.
"I think this is a piece of a larger pattern
that's been demonstrated recently by Gary
Hart," Mondale added. "He is substantially
behind — nearly 700 delegates behind now.
. . . I think he's trying to develop some scheme
for getting delegates that have been elected to
represent Walter Mondale at that convention,
and I don't think it's going to work."
Candidates focus on California
With the exception of a one-day trip by
Hart back to New Jersey next week, all three
contenders for the Democratic nomination for
president plan to spend at least a part of every
day through June 5 in California.
Mondale also plans a final visit to New Jer
sey, which also holds a primary June 5 to elect
107 delegates. But the former vice president is
scheduled to spend better than MO percent of
the remaining campaign time in California,
which will elect 306 delegates next Tuesday.
New Mexico, where Jackson was campaign
ing Tuesday; West Virginia and South Dakota
also have primaries June 5. but between them,
they elect only 73 delegates.
Representing President Reagan, who is un
opposed on the Republican ballot. Vice Presi
dent George Bush also scheduled California
appearances next Monday and Tuesday.
The highlight of the next week of campaign
ing in California will be a debate Sunday at
the KNBC studios in Burbank, bringing the
three major contenders face-to-face for the
last time in the four-month primary season.
