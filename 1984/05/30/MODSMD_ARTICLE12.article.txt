The Reagan administration's record on civil
rights protection has been less than laudable. The
administration had to be coerced into approving
the extension of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it
happily defended the racist policies of Bob Jones
University and it opposes the Equal Rights
Amendment.
The administration's latest target: legislation
that would broaden federal power to penalize in
stitutions that discriminate on the basis of race,
sex, age or handicap. The bill, widely known as
the Civil Rights Act of 1984, was introduced in
response to a recent Supreme Court decision in
volving Grove City College in Pennsylvania. The
court ruled that Title IX, the law forbidding
federal aid to institutions that practice sex dis
crimination, should be applied only to the specific
program receiving federal aid, not to the entire
institution.
The response of Congress to the bill shows, we
think, how out of touch the administration is with
the sentiments toward civil rights in the United
States. The bill was unanimously approved in
House committees and has 63 co-sponsors in the

Senate.
Title IX was intended to encourage institutions,
through monetary pressure, to end discriminatory
practices. The result was an unprecedented infu
sion of equal opportunities for women. The Su
preme Court decision means that, tor example, it
a school's athletic department discriminates
against women, the athletic department, not the
entire institution, will no longer receive federal
funds.
The administration has claimed that its opposi
tion to the Equal Rights Amendment and abor
tion rights does not mean it is opposed to equal
rights for women. The administration s opposi
tion to the civil rights hill's direct and simple
method of cutting off federal funds to institutions
that discriminate makes us wonder about these
claims.
Discrimination is anathema to a democratic
and fair society. The Republican Party, the party
of Lincoln anil Teddy Roosevelt, seemed to be
aware of this. The party ot Reagan is apparently
willing to blithely ignore its heritage.
