The academic senate at San Jose State ap
proved a few weeks ago a resolution urging the
Department of Defense and the university's two
Reserve Officers' Training Corps units to open
their ranks to gay men and lesbians at San Jose
State.
It's about time.
A long-standing Department of Defense policy
prohibits homosexuals from serving in the armed
forces, so San Jose State's Army and Air Force
ROTC do not allow homosexuals to participate in
many aspects of the programs.
Homosexuals may participate fully in academic
ROTC classes, according to Lt. Col. Richard Bar
ton, the commander of the Air Force ROTC pro
gram at San Jose State, but they may not partici
pate in summer training or many other aspects of
the"officer commissioning" programs, which
means they are ineligible for ROTC stipends and
scholarships.

This anti-gay policy violates the California
State University non-discrimination policy of
1978, according to the resolution passed by San
Jose State's academic senate.
It's time for the Defense Department to drop
this antiquated and irrelevant practice. Why is
there any reason to believe a homosexual would
make a less capable soldier or officer than a het
erosexual?
There isn't any reason. And just think ot what
the uproar would be today if the Department of
Defense maintained a similar policy regarding
blacks or Jews or Roman Catholics or Hispanics
or Asians.
Most of us wouldn't stand for it. And we don't
stand for this policy either.
With America's armed forces training in the
computer age, it's time for the Defense Depart
ment to bring its personnel policies out of the Vic
torian Age.
