## Proposed Draw changes unfair to current student population 
### 
The proposed changes to the Draw
made by the Committee on Sen ices to
Student-Residences (COSS-R)
(Daily, May 23) may actually increase
the fairness of the Draw in the long
run. However, if these changes are in-

VIEWPOINT

itiated immediately in next year's
Draw, they will lead to a situation of
even greater inequity to a large popu
lation of students by denying them any
chance they might have had to gain a
favorable housing assignment.
According to Rodger Whitney and
Tim Hesterberg, who serve on COSS-
R, they feel that "the change will
make the Draw more fair and will fa

vor students who feel poor Draw num
bers have banished them to un
desirable residences. Apparently,
they have failed to take into account
the population ot students who have
used up all of their guaranteed years
drawing into those very same
"undesirable residences. 1 am willing
to bet Hesterberg that a detailed
statistical representation would show
this number to be significant. Such
students will suffer all of the negative
consequences of these changes and
will benefit from none of the positive
ones. Essentially, they will be left with
no chance of ever attaining entry into
a "desirable residence."
At least as the Draw stands today,
everyone has an equal chance of

drawing a good number. The un
guaranteed student realizes that he is
unlikely to get assigned, hut at least
has a chance ot getting into ;i nice
residence. With these changes, he will
have no chance.
It Residential Education decides to
implement the proposed changes, I
teel that it would he much more equi
table to all current students if the new
rules were applied only to the incom
ing freshmen of IMS4-S5 and there
after, because the system can he con
sidered fair only if it affects all stu
dents equally. If these changes are im
plemented next year, they will affect
students unequally and unfairly.
