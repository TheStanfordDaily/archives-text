## Academic freedom compatible with end-use rules 
### 
Stanford University has traditionally taken
the position that research never should be
stopped because of the "moral impropriety of
the end uses." The wisdom of this principle,
however, has been recently questioned be

tory (SSRL) that may held develop new, dan
gerous "Star Wars" weaponry. In reaction to
these concerns, the Faculty Senate charged its
Committee on Research to investigate whe
ther the traditional rule should be modified
with respect to research of weapons of mass
destruction.
According to Peter Hochschild, a computer
science graduate student who sits on the Com
mittee on Research, the members have now
all but decided that they will deliver an un
qualified reaffirmation on the traditional rule.
This course, I believe, is morally irresponsible
and warrants immediate reconsideration.
The academic freedom principle as it now
exists allows the most heinous kinds of re
search activities to be undertaken with impu
nity. For example, the principle would allow
without the slightest question Pentagon

sponsored research into how to build better
gas chambers. Is this what the University
really intends to support in the name of aca
demic freedom?
Proponents of new regulations that would
ban research into weapons of mass destruction
have pointed out that, in other contexts, regu
lations have comfortably coexisted with aca
demic freedom. For example, the University
Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Re
search has ably eliminated a vast panoply of
dangerous and degrading experiments without
destroying medical science.
University President Donald Kennedy,
however, has countered, "The faculty policy
on research at Stanford has always drawn a
sharp distinction between restrictions on the
conduct of research and restrictions on the
prospective end uses of research" (Kennedy's
emphasis). In the view of Kennedy and most of
the Faculty Senate, the Human Subjects
Panel's regulations are acceptable because
they only look at the means of research. This
ends/means distinction, however, does not
stand up to critical scrutiny.
First, no one in the University has yet to of
fer a compelling, logical reason why end-use
standards threaten academic freedom any
more than means standards. Indeed, the exact

academic freedom arguments now invoked to
prevent end-use restrictions were once used
against the establishment of the Human Sub
jects Panel.
Second, the distinction is actually not main
tained by the Human Subjects Panel, whose
guidelines clearly stipulate: "Risks to subjects
must be reasonable in relation to anticipated

Supporters seem to be saying
that professors can build
better gas chambers so long
as they treat lab assistants
well.

benefits, if any, to subjects, and to the impor
tance of the knowledge to be gained." In
other words, the panel looks at both the
means and the ends. That the panel has been
able to do this without disturbing academic
freedom is further evidence of the possibility
of forging end-use prohibitions of genocidal
weapons research while not disturbing all
other kinds of research.
Finally, it seems absurd and contradictory
to care about the human subjects of experi

ments and yet be wholly unconcerned about
their human objects. Supporters of the current
regulations seem to be saying that professors
can build better gas chambers so long as they
treat lab assistants well. This kind of distinc
tion has no place in our moral universe. In
fact, both our civil and criminal laws always
hold people responsible for ultimate evil im
plications of their acts, so long as their behav
ior causes the evil implications. For example,
the supplier of criminal instruments is often
held guilty of a crime; a supplier of cocaine
whose user accidentally kills himself is prob
ably guilty of murder.
The Faculty Senate's Committee on Re
search would be wise to abandon the immoral
and contradictory means/end-use distinction
for regulating research. A more valid princi
ple, 1 believe, would be to ban all research
carried out primarily to develop weapons of
mass destruction. Where the connection of
such research to the end-use is attenuated,
perhaps because the research is either concep
tually far-removed from the end-use or the
lethal end-use is one of many positive end
uses, then the research should go forward.
The sensible way to decide responsibility, as
the common law has shown, is to look at
causality, not artificial categories of means

and ends. It' applied research directly causes
genocide, it should be banned; it the causality
is remote, the research should be tolerated.
The only way to apply these principles. I
believe, is through an ongoing panel with
well-developed standards — perhaps through
a new Panel to Prevent Genocidal Weapons
Research. Creation of this panel in a way that
will not disturb academic freedom will be
challenging, but no more challenging than the
task that once faced the architects ot the
Human Subjects Panel.
The alternative favored by the Committee
on Research — to allow faculty to undertake
genocidal weapons research without any
restriction — is less a detense ot academic
freedom and more a complete abdication
from any sense ot moral judgment. Scholars
should realize that academic freedom, like al
freedom, must be bounded by a modicum ot
social responsibility.
As Albert Einstein oncc pleaded, "In the
last analysis, how relatively insignificant is the
destruction of academic treedom it it is
compared with the military enslavement
which forces individuals to sacrifice their lives
in actions many of them condemn!

tory (SSRL) that may held develop new, dan
gerous "Star Wars" weaponry. In reaction to
these concerns, the Faculty Senate charged its
Committee on Research to investigate whe
ther the traditional rule should be modified
with respect to research of weapons of mass
destruction.
According to Peter Hochschild, a computer
science graduate student who sits on the Com
mittee on Research, the members have now
all but decided that they will deliver an un
qualified reaffirmation on the traditional rule.
This course, I believe, is morally irresponsible
and warrants immediate reconsideration.
The academic freedom principle as it now
exists allows the most heinous kinds of re
search activities to be undertaken with impu
nity. For example, the principle would allow
without the slightest question Pentagon

sponsored research into how to build better
gas chambers. Is this what the University
really intends to support in the name of aca
demic freedom?
Proponents of new regulations that would
ban research into weapons of mass destruction
have pointed out that, in other contexts, regu
lations have comfortably coexisted with aca
demic freedom. For example, the University
Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Re
search has ably eliminated a vast panoply of
dangerous and degrading experiments without
destroying medical science.
University President Donald Kennedy,
however, has countered, "The faculty policy
on research at Stanford has always drawn a
sharp distinction between restrictions on the
conduct of research and restrictions on the
prospective end uses of research" (Kennedy's
emphasis). In the view of Kennedy and most of
the Faculty Senate, the Human Subjects
Panel's regulations are acceptable because
they only look at the means of research. This
ends/means distinction, however, does not
stand up to critical scrutiny.
First, no one in the University has yet to of
fer a compelling, logical reason why end-use
standards threaten academic freedom any
more than means standards. Indeed, the exact

academic freedom arguments now invoked to
prevent end-use restrictions were once used
against the establishment of the Human Sub
jects Panel.
Second, the distinction is actually not main
tained by the Human Subjects Panel, whose
guidelines clearly stipulate: "Risks to subjects
must be reasonable in relation to anticipated

benefits, if any, to subjects, and to the impor
tance of the knowledge to be gained." In
other words, the panel looks at both the
means and the ends. That the panel has been
able to do this without disturbing academic
freedom is further evidence of the possibility
of forging end-use prohibitions of genocidal
weapons research while not disturbing all
other kinds of research.
Finally, it seems absurd and contradictory
to care about the human subjects of experi

ments and yet be wholly unconcerned about
their human objects. Supporters of the current
regulations seem to be saying that professors
can build better gas chambers so long as they
treat lab assistants well. This kind of distinc
tion has no place in our moral universe. In
fact, both our civil and criminal laws always
hold people responsible for ultimate evil im
plications of their acts, so long as their behav
ior causes the evil implications. For example,
the supplier of criminal instruments is often
held guilty of a crime; a supplier of cocaine
whose user accidentally kills himself is prob
ably guilty of murder.
The Faculty Senate's Committee on Re
search would be wise to abandon the immoral
and contradictory means/end-use distinction
for regulating research. A more valid princi
ple, 1 believe, would be to ban all research
carried out primarily to develop weapons of
mass destruction. Where the connection of
such research to the end-use is attenuated,
perhaps because the research is either concep
tually far-removed from the end-use or the
lethal end-use is one of many positive end
uses, then the research should go forward.
The sensible way to decide responsibility, as
the common law has shown, is to look at
causality, not artificial categories of means

and ends. It' applied research directly causes
genocide, it should be banned; it the causality
is remote, the research should be tolerated.
The only way to apply these principles. I
believe, is through an ongoing panel with
well-developed standards — perhaps through
a new Panel to Prevent Genocidal Weapons
Research. Creation of this panel in a way that
will not disturb academic freedom will be
challenging, but no more challenging than the
task that once faced the architects ot the
Human Subjects Panel.
The alternative favored by the Committee
on Research — to allow faculty to undertake
genocidal weapons research without any
restriction — is less a detense ot academic
freedom and more a complete abdication
from any sense ot moral judgment. Scholars
should realize that academic freedom, like al
freedom, must be bounded by a modicum ot
social responsibility.
As Albert Einstein oncc pleaded, "In the
last analysis, how relatively insignificant is the
destruction of academic treedom it it is
compared with the military enslavement
which forces individuals to sacrifice their lives
in actions many of them condemn!
