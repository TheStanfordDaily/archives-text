## Jackson only candidate for peace, justice 
### 
On June 5, Californians will get their chance to
vote in what will be the most historic election in
the history of the United States. For 200 years, the
major candidates for president have all shared a
common background in terms of race, class and
gender. This year is different. The color line has
been broken. As Jackie Robinson turned the

VIEWPOINT

sporting world upside down in the 19405, so has
the Rev. Jesse Jackson revolutionized the po
litical world. And like Jackie Robinson, Jackson is
not just the first black person on the field, but one
of the best players of any race.
Jackson, of all the candidates, has fought most
strenuously for the American ideal of "liberty and
justice for all." Central to Jackson's philosophy of
life is the belief espoused by Terrance, an African
slave who became a great playwright in Rome.
Terrance's motto was "I am a human being, noth
ing human can be alien to me." Viewing the world
from this frame of reference, we will come to see
that our common humanity transcends any
ideological or cultural differences that divide us.
When we realize this fact, we will realize that this
country needs a new direction in its domestic and
foreign policy.
At present. America and its leading educational
institutions fail to respect its women and citizens of
color. If Stanford respected all of its members, it
would not threaten the sanctity of an individual's
culture by cutting off freshman from the support
groups necessary to make the transition to a differ
ent culture.
If Stanford respected all of its students, it
wouldn't design a mandatory program which

teaches that the greatest people in civilization were
all white men. If Stanford respected its employees
it wouldn't question the legitimacy of their right to
unionize.
II America respected all people, it wouldn't
glorify a statue inscribed with the words, ''Give me
your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearn
ing to breathe free" while labeling dark-skinned,
Spanish-speaking immigrants from south of the
border "illegal aliens."
If America respected all people, it wouldn't
oppress a race tor 400 years because of its color
and then try to "resolve" the problem with color
blind policies.

He does not share President
Reagan's and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's belief
that all cultures should assim
ilate into the Anglo-Western
culture.

If America respected all people, it would go to
an Indian reservation and talk about honesty,
justice and freedom.
Jackson believes that everybody is somebody
and nobody should have to live under the iron fist
of oppression. He does not share President
Reagan's and University President Donald Ken
nedy's belief that all cultures should assimilate into

the Anglo-Western culture. He describes a quilt as
a metaphor for America. "Lots of different
patches, lots of different shapes, lots of different
colors, but everyone fits somewhere."
America's wrong direction is not limited to
domestic affairs. As Jackson likes to say, "foreign
policy is domestic policy extending beyond the
border." Disrespect for people south of the border
means that we can exploit Latin American
economies, support dictators who ruthlessly mur
der their own citizens and invade tiny islands that
have no army and lots of black people.
Disrespect for people (yes, they really are
people) called communists means that we can
spend billions of dollars on weapons to destroy all
of life, intervene in indigenous revolutions tor
freedom and justify risking nuclear holocaust with
the assurance that we'd rather "be dead than red
(echoing Gen. Custer and forgetting Christ's ad
monition to love our enemies).
While the country is traveling at breakneck
speed in this warlike and unjust direction, we, as
California voters, can make a difference. We can
vote for the candidate who has dedicated his life to
bringing peace and justice to the top of the Ameri
can agenda. In the 19605, Jesse Jackson, Martin
Luther King and a host of brave college students,
among many others, introduced justice and peace
into a racist and violent South. Today, we are
called again to fight for the betterment of
mankind. This time we do not have to risk death
marching in Mississippi. We can simply vote at
Stanford. These are historic times. Let us take our
place in history. Let us stand foi what is right. Let
us vote for basic human rights for all people.
