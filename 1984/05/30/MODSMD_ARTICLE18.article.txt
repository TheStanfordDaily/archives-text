## Counselor to rallier, Supton a profile in seriousness 
### MARC PEYSER Daily staff 
At 39, Alicc Supton's face is a
study in contradictions. Dark
and curly, her wild, child-like
hair seems almost out of place
crowning an assistant dean. But
it is beneath this girlish mop of
curls where the real tone is set.
Here, through deeply wrinkled
and often darkly circled amber
eyes, passes an almost over
whelming seriousness. Pensive
and demure, there can be little

the Student Center for Innova
tion in Research Education
(SCIRE) and Stanford
Workshops on Political and So
cial Issues (SWOPSI).
"1 have friends from so many
different parts of my Stanford
life," Supton said. "One of the
reasons 1 think I can be effective
in my current job is a number a
years of contact with faculty and
staff. I have personal
friendships. I really know
people."

doubt that this is a face of expe
rience.
After 10 years at Stanford,
however, it would be almost
impossible not to have seen
nearly everything. And she has.
Supton arrived here in 1973,
when she worked as a secretary,
half-time in Urban Studies and
half-time for the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. Since
then, she has moved through
various organizations, including

It is in her current job as the
assistant dean of Residential
Education that Supton is known
best. From working with and se
lecting residence staffs to for
mulating policy and organizing
programs, hers is a tireless
schedule. "When I'm working,
I'm really working."
But her life has always been
active. After reading an article
in a magazine, she, like many
students in the 19605, headed
South to work in the Civil

Rights movement during sum
mer vacations in college.
"I was always interested in
how social change comes
about," she said. Still, she was
not quite prepared for what she
found in Mississippi. "It was a
shock. Being harassed, not
being allowed to go to the bath
room. being followed in cars.
There was extreme poverty and
deprivation," she said.
After graduating with honors
from Bryn Mawr College in
Pennsylvania, she "thought
about law school," but instead
turned her efforts toward
working against the Vietnam
War and later taught first grade
in a New York City project
school which she called "front
line work."
No longer as politically in
volved, she does, in a sense,
miss her work as an activist.
"When I come across people
who do real political work, I am
beset by awareness that I am not
doing it," she said.
Life inside Old Union is not,
however, without its own types
of battles. Last year, for in
stance, she was forced to
remove a freshman from his
dorm because of behavior prob
lems. "The other kids in the
house thought I was the wicked
witch of Res Ed and attack(ed)
me, literally, in the courtyard,"
she said. "They were really very
accusatory and 1 didn't enjoy it.
But I held my own."
She has also come under fire
because of Res Ed's alcohol
policy. "I think there is confu
sion as to what the office of Res
Ed is doing," said Supton. "As
an office, we have resisted in all
areas setting a single standard.
We realize the settings of
residences are different — the
personalities differ from year to
year. We don't want to decide
for people how they should
live."
It seems, then, that she has
found enough to keep her occu
pied in her job away from the
political battlefield. "If you had
asked me what would be a good
job for me I wouldn't have
thought about" this type of po
sition, she said. "It happpens
that this kind of job allowed me
to meet the expectations that
Norm (Robinson, dean of Res
Ed) had, but also to develop."
As the firsjt assistant dean re
sponsible, for working closely
with residence staff, she feels

that she has been able to make
the most of her abilities while
learning more about herself.
"I found I like being part
manager, part impressario, part
counselor, part problem solver,
part rallier and part shoulder to
lean on. I like multiple roles,"
she said.
Looking at all that she has ac
complished during her tenure
here, it might be difficult to im
agine Supton as having a life
outside of her office. Yet she is
reputed by some of her friends
to be one of the University's
best party givers as well as a
very loyal friend. "I spend a lot
of time developing my
friendships," she said. "I have a
whole set of swimming friends
just from the office."
In addition, she said she
"likes to go to events," and is
very interested in modern
dance, a fact which is affirmed
by the numerous dance pictures
on her desk in her office.
"In my truest self I'm a dan

cer," she said. It's "a way of
moving unlike any other."
But her interests are not
confined to the arts. As a mem
ber of both the Center for Re

search on Women (CROW) and
the Feminist Studies Policy
Board, she has worked toward
achieving equality for women at
Stanford, although she does feel
that "there is a problem still that

"I'm a resonably sensitive per
son," she said, "and I have a
somewhat better ability now to
disengage myself emotionally
from situations connnected with

my work. Sometimes, though, I
don't take my own advice and,
when people I care about are
hurting, Ido feel wretched, - ' she
said.
Wretched or not, her work
has not gone unnoticed, as last
year she was honored with the
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award for
outstanding contributions to un
dergraduate education and to
the Stanford community. "It
was a wonderful moment of
recognition," she said. "It put a
value on the work that we've all
been doing in Residential Edu
cation. It was a great joy that
they chose to honor someone
who has put her life-blood into
enhancing education in
residences."
Still, Supton has a difficult
time singling out her greatest
success. "That's hard for me,"
she said. "It sounds like a single
thing — I tend to think in con
tinuities. I like the feeling of
having everything come to
gether."

asked me what would be a good
job for me I wouldn't have
thought about" this type of po
sition, she said. "It happpens
that this kind of job allowed me
to meet the expectations that
Norm (Robinson, dean of Res
Ed) had, but also to develop."
As the firsjt assistant dean re

with residence staff, she feels

that she has been able to make
the most of her abilities while
learning more about herself.
"I found I like being part
manager, part impressario, part
counselor, part problem solver,
part rallier and part shoulder to
lean on. I like multiple roles,"
she said.
Looking at all that she has ac
complished during her tenure
here, it might be difficult to im
agine Supton as having a life
outside of her office. Yet she is
reputed by some of her friends
to be one of the University's
best party givers as well as a
very loyal friend. "I spend a lot
of time developing my
friendships," she said. "I have a
whole set of swimming friends
just from the office."
In addition, she said she
"likes to go to events," and is
very interested in modern
dance, a fact which is affirmed
by the numerous dance pictures
on her desk in her office.

Wretched or not, her work
has not gone unnoticed, as last

Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award for
outstanding contributions to un

the Stanford community. "It
was a wonderful moment of

she said. "It sounds like a single

Alice Supton
Likes everything to come together
At 39, Alicc Supton's face is a
study in contradictions. Dark
and curly, her wild, child-like
hair seems almost out of place
crowning an assistant dean. But
it is beneath this girlish mop of
curls where the real tone is set.
Here, through deeply wrinkled
and often darkly circled amber
eyes, passes an almost over
whelming seriousness. Pensive
and demure, there can be little

(SCIRE) and Stanford

"1 have friends from so many
different parts of my Stanford
life," Supton said. "One of the
reasons 1 think I can be effective
in my current job is a number a
years of contact with faculty and
staff. I have personal
friendships. I really know
people."

doubt that this is a face of expe
rience.
After 10 years at Stanford,
however, it would be almost
impossible not to have seen
nearly everything. And she has.
Supton arrived here in 1973,
when she worked as a secretary,
half-time in Urban Studies and
half-time for the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. Since
then, she has moved through
various organizations, including

It is in her current job as the
assistant dean of Residential
Education that Supton is known
best. From working with and se
lecting residence staffs to for
mulating policy and organizing
programs, hers is a tireless
schedule. "When I'm working,
I'm really working."
But her life has always been
active. After reading an article
in a magazine, she, like many
students in the 19605, headed
South to work in the Civil

Rights movement during sum
mer vacations in college.
"I was always interested in
how social change comes
about," she said. Still, she was
not quite prepared for what she
found in Mississippi. "It was a
shock. Being harassed, not
being allowed to go to the bath
room. being followed in cars.
There was extreme poverty and
deprivation," she said.
After graduating with honors
from Bryn Mawr College in
Pennsylvania, she "thought
about law school," but instead
turned her efforts toward
working against the Vietnam
War and later taught first grade
in a New York City project
school which she called "front
line work."
No longer as politically in
volved, she does, in a sense,
miss her work as an activist.
"When I come across people
who do real political work, I am
beset by awareness that I am not
doing it," she said.
Life inside Old Union is not,
however, without its own types
of battles. Last year, for in
stance, she was forced to
remove a freshman from his
dorm because of behavior prob
lems. "The other kids in the
house thought I was the wicked
witch of Res Ed and attack(ed)
me, literally, in the courtyard,"
she said. "They were really very
accusatory and 1 didn't enjoy it.
But I held my own."
She has also come under fire
because of Res Ed's alcohol
policy. "I think there is confu
sion as to what the office of Res
Ed is doing," said Supton. "As
an office, we have resisted in all
areas setting a single standard.
We realize the settings of
residences are different — the
personalities differ from year to
year. We don't want to decide
for people how they should
live."
It seems, then, that she has
found enough to keep her occu
pied in her job away from the
political battlefield. "If you had
asked me what would be a good
job for me I wouldn't have
thought about" this type of po
sition, she said. "It happpens
