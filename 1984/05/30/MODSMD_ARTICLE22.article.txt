## Card Olympic hopeful Kostoff—going for the gold 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Jeff Kostoff claims he doesn't
have much natural speed in the
water. Sure he doesn't.
Kostoff, a distance swimmer
who currently holds three
American records, is Stanford's
best bet to win a gold medal at
this summer's Olympic Games
in Los Angeles. He will be
racing in the U.S. Olympic Tri
als at the end of June to qualify
for one of two spots in the 400-
and 1500-meter freestyle races
and the 400-meter individual
medley.
But fame has not deprived the
wiry freshman of a typical life
style here.
Kostoff drives his brown
Camaro (licence plates "I
SWIMS") around campus,
speeding from workouts to
classes, and retires to a Roble
room decorated with a large So
viet flag, ABC Sports ban
ner and a crate packed with
record albums. "I really like to
listen to my music a lot," the 18-
year-old says.
He characterizes his musical
tastes — Elvis Costello, The
Jam, Joe Jackson, Pink Floyd,
The Police and X heading his
list of favorites — as a mix of
new wave and intellectual
music.
Kostoff achieved the top na
tional ranking in the 1500 free
and 400 IM last year, despite his
youth and what he deems a lack
of natural speed.
He attributes his success to
"conditioning from lots of train
ing.
"It's a combination of mental
toughness and endurance. You
know you gotta do it and you
just do it. That's the way it
goes."
That's the way it has always
gone for the multi-talented
Southern Californian who ex
celled at cross country running as
well as swimming in high school.
Racing at five years old in a

local country club pool. Kostofl
was. in his own words, "a very
hard-working kid." By the age
of eight, he was training I I
months each year, and by 1(1 he
had already established himselt
as an exceptional talent.
"You get more and more into
it,"he says."It snowballs."
Kostoffs current six-day-a
week training schedule — with
double workouts twice weekly
— shows that he is not letting up
at all, despite an inevitable
feeling of "getting burned out"
that hit him at the beginning of
spring quarter.
Men's swimming Head Coach
Skip Kenney calls his freshman
prodigy "an inspiration."
"Everybody on the team has
bad days," says Kenney. "He
just fewer bad days than
anyone else."
"When you look at U.S.
swimming, he's the one on the
horizon," Kenney says, adding
that Kostoffs "enthusiasm and
great sense of humor" as well as
"spectacular talent" make him a
very positive asset to the team.
"He's extremely coachable.
You can dream up anything to
challenge him. He loves it.
Kostoff, who entered Stan
ford with a half-dozen national
titles, has lived up to his reputa
tion this year, winning the
NCAA Championship 1650-
yard free, capturing three titles
at the U.S. Swimming Short
Course Championships and
breaking a plethora of Univer
sity and DeGuerre Pool records.
And he says he has much
room for improvement in the
upcoming years.
Meanwhile, he is working
toward a double major in phil
osophy and history. He's taking
a full load of classes this quarter
while other potential Olympic
swimmers have stopped out or
opted for light loads in order to
concentrate on their training.
There is definitely life after

swimming for Kostoff. who
claims he has tentative plans to
fetire after competing in the
1988 ()l\mpics.
"I'd kind of like to go into
coaching someday." he says."I
might want to be a teacher or I
might go into law it I decide 1
don't want to he poor."
But the 1954 Olympic Games
are Kostoff s chief priority now .
and the Soviet boycott has not
deterred him.
"It's their problem if they
don't want to come," he says."I
still have to train hard to make
our team. It's not slowing me
down any."
Kostoff feels he stands the
best chance of qualifying for the
Olympics in the 1500 free and
400 IM. with an outside chance
in the 4(H) free.
But his win in the 400 free
over Soviet world-record holder
Vladimir Salniko\ last February
proved that he is equally capa
ble of qualifying in his self
proclaimed weakest event.
And capable of beating the
world's finest competition, even
if he is not given the chance this
summer.
Sports Illustrated magazine,
in a recent article lauding Sal
nikov's command of world-class
distance swimming, offered this
statement on the Soviet star:
"The longer his domination
lasts, the more Soviet coaches
wonder when America is going
to uncork some 19-year-old
monster to swim him down."
Although he may not admit it,
Kostoff fits the bill and has all
the talent and determination to
end Salnikov's era of
dominance.
"1 wouldn't say 1 see myself as
a monster," he says. "Maybe a
threat, but not yet."
Kostoff s personal best in the
400 free is a 3:54, which falls
six seconds short of Sal
nikov's world record. He needs
to drop his 15:17 clocking in the
1500 free by 23 seconds to bet

ter Salnikov's record of 14:54 in
that event.
"I could heat his records
eventually," Kostoff states.

Kostoff approaches life with
both humor and seriousness of
purpose. He sees his 13 years of
rigorous training as worthwhile

and enjoyable.
"I like to win," he states.
"The payoff (for the long hours
spent training) is the records.

the glory, the scholarship, the
usual sports motivation. It's a
challenge, seeing what you can
do."

Freshman Jeff Kostoff likes records — listening to them and
breaking them. The swimmer is one of the hottest
Jeff Kostoff claims he doesn't
have much natural speed in the
water. Sure he doesn't.
Kostoff, a distance swimmer
who currently holds three
American records, is Stanford's
best bet to win a gold medal at
this summer's Olympic Games
in Los Angeles. He will be
racing in the U.S. Olympic Tri
als at the end of June to qualify
for one of two spots in the 400-
and 1500-meter freestyle races
and the 400-meter individual
medley.
But fame has not deprived the
wiry freshman of a typical life
style here.
Kostoff drives his brown
Camaro (licence plates "I
SWIMS") around campus,
speeding from workouts to
classes, and retires to a Roble
room decorated with a large So
viet flag, ABC Sports ban
ner and a crate packed with
record albums. "I really like to
listen to my music a lot," the 18-
year-old says.
He characterizes his musical
tastes — Elvis Costello, The
Jam, Joe Jackson, Pink Floyd,
The Police and X heading his
list of favorites — as a mix of
new wave and intellectual
music.
Kostoff achieved the top na
tional ranking in the 1500 free
and 400 IM last year, despite his
youth and what he deems a lack
of natural speed.
He attributes his success to
"conditioning from lots of train
ing.
"It's a combination of mental
toughness and endurance. You
know you gotta do it and you
just do it. That's the way it
goes."
That's the way it has always
gone for the multi-talented
Southern Californian who ex
celled at cross country running as
well as swimming in high school.
Racing at five years old in a

local country club pool. Kostofl
was. in his own words, "a very
hard-working kid." By the age
of eight, he was training I I
months each year, and by 1(1 he
had already established himselt
as an exceptional talent.
"You get more and more into
it,"he says."It snowballs."
Kostoffs current six-day-a
week training schedule — with
double workouts twice weekly
— shows that he is not letting up
at all, despite an inevitable
feeling of "getting burned out"
that hit him at the beginning of
spring quarter.
Men's swimming Head Coach
Skip Kenney calls his freshman
prodigy "an inspiration."
"Everybody on the team has
bad days," says Kenney. "He
just fewer bad days than
anyone else."
"When you look at U.S.
swimming, he's the one on the
horizon," Kenney says, adding
that Kostoffs "enthusiasm and
great sense of humor" as well as
"spectacular talent" make him a
very positive asset to the team.
"He's extremely coachable.
You can dream up anything to
challenge him. He loves it.
Kostoff, who entered Stan
ford with a half-dozen national
titles, has lived up to his reputa
tion this year, winning the
NCAA Championship 1650-
yard free, capturing three titles
at the U.S. Swimming Short
Course Championships and
breaking a plethora of Univer
sity and DeGuerre Pool records.
And he says he has much
room for improvement in the
upcoming years.
Meanwhile, he is working
toward a double major in phil
osophy and history. He's taking
a full load of classes this quarter
while other potential Olympic
swimmers have stopped out or
opted for light loads in order to
concentrate on their training.
There is definitely life after

swimming for Kostoff. who
claims he has tentative plans to
fetire after competing in the
1988 ()l\mpics.
"I'd kind of like to go into
coaching someday." he says."I
might want to be a teacher or I
might go into law it I decide 1
don't want to he poor."
But the 1954 Olympic Games
are Kostoff s chief priority now .
and the Soviet boycott has not
deterred him.
"It's their problem if they
don't want to come," he says."I
still have to train hard to make
our team. It's not slowing me
down any."
Kostoff feels he stands the
best chance of qualifying for the
Olympics in the 1500 free and
400 IM. with an outside chance
in the 4(H) free.
But his win in the 400 free
over Soviet world-record holder
Vladimir Salniko\ last February
proved that he is equally capa
ble of qualifying in his self
proclaimed weakest event.
And capable of beating the
world's finest competition, even
if he is not given the chance this
summer.
Sports Illustrated magazine,
in a recent article lauding Sal
nikov's command of world-class
distance swimming, offered this
statement on the Soviet star:
"The longer his domination
lasts, the more Soviet coaches
wonder when America is going
to uncork some 19-year-old
monster to swim him down."
Although he may not admit it,
Kostoff fits the bill and has all
the talent and determination to
end Salnikov's era of
dominance.
"1 wouldn't say 1 see myself as
a monster," he says. "Maybe a
threat, but not yet."
Kostoff s personal best in the
400 free is a 3:54, which falls
six seconds short of Sal
nikov's world record. He needs
to drop his 15:17 clocking in the
1500 free by 23 seconds to bet
