# Erickson: a confident golfer
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
Scott Erickson's estimation of his self
worth appears to fluctuate about as often
as his quiet, almost monotonal voice.
Following his performance in last
week's NCAA Golf Championships in
Houston, one would anticipate that there
would be at least a slight swell in Erick
son's voice as he discussed his achieve
ments. After all, he opened the pres
tigious tournament with rounds of 74-69,
a start which placed him only 10 strokes
behind leader and eventual champion
John Inman of North Carolina.
Then, after Stanford failed to make
the cut at the end of the third round,
Erickson was invited by the NCAA to
compete in Saturday's round as an indi
vidual. He finished the tournament with
rounds of 72-76 to wind up at a solid 3-
over-par 291, only three shots out of
ninth place.
Teammate and long-time acquaint
ance Tim Robinson was one of the spec
taforv-'wbvvErickson impressed with his
. . i ,
"This tournament is definitely going to
help Scott," said Robinson. "After the
slumps he'd had earlier this year, this was
the kind of thing he needed to give him
some real confidence in his game."
Erickson, however, exhibited neither
enthusiasm nor disappointment as he
talked about his play in Houston.
"I was happy with the way I played,"
said Erickson. "I didn't hit the ball as
well as I have all year, but my putting
was a little better. Confidence?" He
paused. '"I guess the tournament
reassured me a little bit, but it's really my

whole past record that gives me confi
dence in my game."
Don't mistake Erickson's
"confidence" for egotism, which often
affects participants in such individually
oriented sports as golf and tennis. Erick
son simply knows in his heart that he is
capable of playing golf very well, and
that quiet self-assurance keeps him from
overreacting to either his successes or
his failures.
The successes have been more fre
quent than the failures for Erickson, ever
since he took his first golf lesson at the
age of five from an instructor in Orange
County. He began playing in the
highly competitive Southern California
Junior Golf circuit at age 10, and, at 17,
he climaxed his career as a junior player
by winning the U.S. Golf Association
Junior National Championship.
Despite his achievements as a junior
golfer, Erickson was not heavily
recruited by colleges, mainly because he
did not spend his high school years in a
single-minded obsession with golf. He
played football and soccer in the fall,
which meant that he wasn't able to start
playing golf seriously until February.
Schoolwork also took up a large chunk
of his time during the high school season,
and during Erickson's extensive summer
golf schedule, he would often spend his
mornings at the beach with friends
before playing in tournaments in the af
ternoon. He was always careful, he said,
"not to make golf the one thing that I
did."
He was offered a full scholarship from
Duke University during his senior year,

but turned it down to enter Stanford in
the fall of 1981. It wasn't long before
Erickson discovered the huge differo'ice
between high school and college golf.
"It took me a while to adjust to
playing at the college level," said Erick
son. "It's much harder to balance golf,
academics and social life at Stanford than
in high school."
In his three years on the Farm, in fact,
Erickson's attitude towards golf has un
dergone a major change. Golf is no
longer something he does for the sake of
competition and enjoyment; for Erick
son and most of his teammates on the
Stanford team, golf is now a "pre
professional" experience.
"At times it seems like a job," said
Erickson in the same soft, even voice.
"I've started to think that golf might be
my career, so I'm putting more emphasis
on it now."
The temptation to become one
dimensional in his pursuit of excellence
on the golf course is something which
Ericksoti is conscious of. and he has
made an effort to maintain an active aca
demic and social life while at Stanford.
"There aren't a lot of guys that come
out of golf factories like Oklahoma State
— the NCAA champion in 1983 and the
runner-up this year — and make it on the
pro tour," said Erickson. "It's a theory of
(Coach) Tim Schaafs that guys who
aren't able to play under such ideal con
ditions, who have to organize their time
and develop good study habits at college,
end up with a much stronger mental
game."


Scott Erickson, top Cardinal golfer, contemplates his next
shot. The junior has also done some serious thinking about

phasis on the sport than he has in the past.
