# IOC will extend deadline if Soviets attend games

From wire reports
Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the In
ternational Olympic Committee, said yesterday
that it would immediately extend Saturday's
deadline for Olympic entries if his talks in Mos
cow show any sign of Soviet willingness to reverse
the boycott.
And in a pep talk to American athletes vying
for a spot in the Summer Games at Los Angeles,
President Reagan denounced the boycott as the
"political machinations of powerbrokers in less
than-free countries."
A top-level Olympic delegation prepared to
travel to Moscow today to deliver a letter to So
viet President Konstantin Chernenko containing
"proposals, suggestions and comments" in a plea
for a reversal of the Soviet boycott decision, offi
cials of the lOC said.
"I am not very optimistic," Samaranch said.
"I'm a realist. Of course, if they make some new
proposals to overcome the impediment to their
full participation, and if the June 2 deadline poses
a problem, I will postpone the deadline immedi
ately."
Marat Gramov, Soviet Olympics Committee
chairman, already has declared the boycott final
and "irrevocable," on several occasions.
"If we postpone the deadline, it will be a good
sign. But I do not think they will ask for it,"
Samaranch said.
The delegation will include Samaranch,
Monique Berlioux, director of the International
Olympic Committee, Primo Nebiolo of Italy,
president of the Association of Summer Sports
Federations, and Mario Vazquez Rana of Mexico,
president of the Association of National Olympic
Committees.
Peter Ueberroth, president of the Los Angeles
Olympic Organizing Committee, told the same
news conference in Lausanne, Switzerland: "We
take our instructions from the lOC. If the lOC
asks us to extend the deadline, we will do it."
Ueberroth was willing to attend the Moscow
meeting, but he said he was not invited.
In a new development yesterday, Pravda, the
Soviet Communist Party daily, accused Reagan of
wanting to use the Games to stir up anti-Soviet
sentiment that would carry him to victory in the
November presidential election.
It said Reagan wanted to "grab a victory at the
Games at any price for political aims in order to
humiliate contenders."
Reagan, in speaking yesterday to American
athletes hoping to compete in the Los Angeles
Olympics, said, "The games are moving forward
and they will be successful." Reagan made his
remarks at the U.S. training center in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
"It is unfortunate that not all nations will be
represented at the Games. I hope you realize,
however, that the success of the Olympics and
your personal success in the games in no way
depend on political machinations of powerbrokers

in less-than-free countries," Reagan said.
Meanwhile, hopes of athletes from communist
countries who are seeking to break the Soviet-led
boycott by competing individually in the Games
were denied yesterday.
"It is impossible for the lOC to accept these
entries," Berlioux said. "It would be a violation of
Olympic rules. No athlete can compete unless he
is sponsored by his National Olympic Commit
tee."
Berlioux said the applications had to be turned
down under Article 30 of the Olympic charter
governing the admission of athletes to the Games.
The article stipulates that "only National Olympic
Committees recognized by the lOC may enter
competitors in the Olympic Games."
The National Olympic Committees of the So
viet Union and at least 10 Soviet-influenced na-

tions are boycotting the Los Angeles Games be
cause of alleged American violations of Olympic
rules and alleged "threats" to athletes from com
munist nations.
Berlioux recalled that a number of American,
German and other athletes tried to break the
American-led boycott of the 1980 Moscow games
by entering individually, but were rejected for the
same reason.
Ueberroth said that "between 10 and 20" ath
letes from countries boycotting this summer's
Games have approached the organizers for
permission to compete without the approval of
their National Olympic Committees.
He said most of them were refugees or were
simply living outside the Soviet bloc. He noted,
however, that at least four athletes have written
from inside their own countries to apply for indi
vidual admission.
It was also believed that several Soviet
influenced African countries, including Congo,
Ethiopia, Benin, Mozambique and Angola, were
under strong pressure to join the boycott.
Tanzania said yesterday it will send a team of
least 22 athletes to the Summer Games. Tanzania
won two silver medals in the 1980 Games.
The announcement by Tanzania was the latest
indication that most African nations will partici
pate in the beleaguered games. Kenya and
Uganda have also declared intentions to compete
in the Games.
Despite the boycott, Ueberroth said a record
132 nations have issued formal written assurances
they will participate in the Games. The 1972
Munich Games had the largest number of par
ticipating countries to date â€” 122.
