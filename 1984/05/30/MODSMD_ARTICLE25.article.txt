# Netters in Olympic trials
## 
### 
With the NCAA Champion
ships behind them, six members
of the Stanford men's and wo
men's tennis teams compete
today in the U.S. Olympic Trials
in New York, where they will
vie for a spot on the team that
will represent the United States
at the July Games in Los An
geles.
Two of the six have already
begun play. John Letts and

Stephanie Savides need to
survive a qualifying tournament
to make it into the respective
32-player draws. Derrick Ros
tagno, Jim Grabb, Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Patty Fendick
were seeded into their draws in
advance.
Because of the age limit set
for the sport at the Los Angeles
Games, no upperclassmen are
participating in the Trials.

In addition to players already
on the Farm, three incoming
recruits for the women's team
are competing in New York.
Kate Tittle and Anna Idam are
already in the women's bracket,
while Cari Hagey is trying to
make it through the qualifying
rounds.
Tennis is a demonstration
sport at the Los Angeles Olym
pics.
