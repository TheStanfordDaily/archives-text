## 'Temple of Doom': superior craftsmanship with a sour heart 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
In the first 20 minutes of Steven
Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom, genres overlap
cl it ( hanger, spy thriller, screwball
comedy, musical comedy spectacular,
high-voltage parody — all moving at
such a breakneck speed that you grow
di//y trying to keep track of the
switches (and of the plot). Indiana
Jones (Harrison Ford), the
archeologist-adventurer hero ol the
IMS 1 Spielberg-George Lucas co
production Raiders of the Lost Ark.
has arranged to swap a sacred relic

with a Chinese gangster in exchange
for a diamond. At a Shanghai
nightclub, the hood attempts to
swindle Jones, and after a face-off in
volving poison, flaming skewers,
hundreds of white balloons and an
elaborate visual pun (the diamond
gets buried in a pile of chipped ice),
Jones, his juvenile Chinese sidekick
Short Round (played by a charmer
named Ke Huy Quan) and the
gangster's mistress, an American
singer named Willie Scott (Kate Cap
shaw), escape onto a plane — piloted,
it develops, by stooges employed by
Jones' adversary, who parachute out

of the \ehicle. leaving Jones and his
cohorts to their own devices. When
the\ have survived a plane crash, a
toboggan ride down the side of a
mountain and a bout with the rapids
below, they find themselves on the
outskirts of a \ illage in India.
This prefatory sequence, which
serves (like the first scenes in James
Hond pictures) to shilt the action from
the end of one adventure to the start
of a new, local one. has more style and
imagination than anything in Raiders
did. I was not among the fans of
Raiders, which I found a pallid, com-

mercially safe entertainment, without
originality or spirit or (much) wit; it
seemed to me that in his previous film,
the slapstick blockbuster 194], Spiel
berg had taken far more chances, but
when 1941 bombed he took refuge in
putting together, with his friend
George Lucas, a movie that just
couldn't fail at the box office. Self
destructive though it undoubtedly
was. 1941 had a marvelous first half
hour, and its firecracker energy was
something to watch — it left you
winded, the way a Preston Sturges
does, because of the pace and the
buoyancy of some of the young

performers and the seemingly endless
Rube Goldberg inventiveness ot the
gags. And after Raiders, which (as
other critics have pointed out) seemed
more in the style of George Lucas,
who thought up the story and
produced it. than Steven Spielberg, it's
a surprise to find the vertiginous
pleasures of 1941 011 display at the
outset of Indiana Jones.
The best sequence in 1941 was a jit
terbug number that slid into a brawl
but maintained a musical comedy
rhythm: Indiana Jones begins with .1
nightclub extravagan/a — "Anything
Goes" by Cole Porter, sung in Chinese
(with the title interpolated in English)
by Kate Capshaw — that sets the
tempo for the thrills that follow. (That
number is an esoteric act ol homage to
the musicals of the 19305. The use of the
chorus girls parodies Busby Berkeley ,
as does the linguistic hodgepodge: In
the most famous Berkeley interlude ol
them all, "We're 111 the Money"
which opened Gold Diggers of 1933
— Ginger Rogers sang one verse in
pig Latin. But Spielberg layers his ref
erences: In 1936, Paramount — dis
tributors for Indiana Jones — put out
a film adaptation of Anything Goes.
with a finale, "Shanghai-De-Ho."
built around a Chinese theme and
belted by the star of both stage and
movie versions, Ethel Merman.
Indiana Jones takes place in 1935.)
But once Indy, Willie Scott and Short
Round reach India, the fun stops
and by the time it resumes, a good
hour later, you're no longer in the
mood to enjoy it.
The tiny Indian village suffers from
poverty, famine and the loss of its two
priceless treasures — all of its
children and a sacred stone from the
temple, both stolen by evil forces oc
cupying the palace of the Maharajah
who rules over the villagers. Con
vinced that the plane crash was a
divine act delivering a savior to them
after months of prayer, the Indians
persuade Jones to undertake the
recovery of the children and the holy
diamond. And so Jones, Willie and
Short Round travel to the hilltop
palace — its entrance marked by an
ominous, blood-stained statue and
proclaimed by the shrieks of vampire
bats circling above the rescue party.
(This eerie fairy tale image is, of
course, straight out of The Wizard of
Oz.) Inside they encounter a gracious,
Anglicized prime minister and a child
Maharajah with uncomfortably gen
teel British manners and creepy, red
rimmed eyes, who treat them to what
is probably the most extravagantly
repulsive gourmet feast ever put on
screen (and that includes the wriggling
delicacies of the Skeksis in The Dark
Crystal). This sequence, and the scene
a few minutes later (after an overlong,
too-broad comic-romantic match be
tween Harrison Ford and Kate Cap
shaw), in which the adventurers attain
the buried Temple of Doom through a
secret passage inhabited by every
known variety of cockroach, arc ex
tended sick jokes that will probably
delight many of the 12- and 13-year
olds in the audience. But once Spiel
berg, Lucas (who wrote this story, too)
and the screenwriters, Willard Huyck
and Gloria Katz, trap the trio — and
us — inside the temple itself, their
sense of humor turns perverse. The
temple encloses the rites of an evil
cult, centuries old and long believed
extinct, whose worshippers include the
child prince and his prime minister,
and whose priest (Amrish Puri),

wearing a pair ot horns and a hideous
shrunken head, administers the pagan
spectacle: He binds a sacrificial victim
to a cage, tears his heart out ot his
chest, and loxvers him into a pit of
molten gold. Below the altar — where
the phallic sacred stone and two
identical ones sit — the kidnaped
children dig in the mines for more
diamonds (and for other precious
stones that provide the revenue to
support the cult), whipped by sneering
slavemasters and occasionally taken
away to become worshippers after an
enforced dose of a poisonous brew
known as the blood of Kali Ma. (The
liquid drives them into a delirium and
then tree/es their compassion, so that
they are capable — like the pubescent
Maharajah — of performing voodoo
tortures with glee.)
I his section of the mov ie is so
repugnant and so relentlessly sadistic
that we pass from horror through
outrage into a sense of betrayal — be
cause it was fabricated, after all. by the
same Steven Spielberg who made the
ineffably sweet-natu red Close
Encounters of the Third Kind and
E.T.. It's not the first time I've spotted
a mean-spiritedness in Spielberg's
work; the mystical elimination of the
Nazi villains at the finish of Raiders

was needlessly \iolent. hut I thought
the real problem there was that he'd
tried to make a movie about the
powers ot faith (at least, the />lot w;is
about the powers of t'aith) hut without
any heart. In Indiana Jones, which is a
superior piece of craftsmanship in al
most every wax. his heart seems to
ha\e gone sour. Could he and l.ucas
really have imagined that either the
adolescents or the adults 111 the audi
ence (taking younger children to see
the picture would he sheer lunacy)
would derive any enjoyment out of
these ghoulish proceedings? Even
Harrison ford appears to he having a
lousy time — though that max he the
result of physical pain (he suffered a
ruptured disc during the shooting) or
of the frustrations of playing opposite
Kate Capshaw. who throws herself
into her dumb part (a spoiled, whining
female who sprays perfume 011 the ele
phant she's riding and demands to call
her agent from the farthest reaches of
the Indian jungle) with a great deal
more enthusiasm than skill. You keep
wishing Kathleen Turner would take
over — at least until the movie enters
the Temple of Doom, when all you
wish for is a speedy conclusion.
When a critic dissents against a pre

head against a stone wall, because
nothing he says will stop people from
going to see it — or. in most cases,
from succumbing, once they're sucked

sures of a movie that has been turned
into an Event. That's the way I felt
during Haiders and Return of the Jedi.

defensively, to protest that I don t
hate movies just because they're com
mercial triumphs — that I loved Jaws
and The Empire Strikes Back and
E.T.. But surely there must be others
who reacted as I did to Indiana Jones.
who wondered what impulse had
provoked Spielberg to level such a vi
cious assault on his audience. I would
like to think that he and Lucas mis
calculated here — that moviegoers
won't be amused by the Temple of
Doom scenes and won't be lulled, by
the cracker jack mine-tunnel
rollereoaster ride that shirts the
picture's gears toward the end. into
giving the filmmakers the high sign.
Indiana Jones isn't pleasurable enter
tainment. but a cruel cheat that some
sleight-of-hand from Industrial Light
and Magic and a happy ending can't
rectify. It's as if Spielberg and Lucas
had drunk from the blood of Kali Ma.
