# Keystone party to feature Eddie and the Tide
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
This year, the Stanford classes
of 1984 and '85 arc jointly
presenting the "First Annual
Class Wars," which is an end
of-the-term party being held at
the Keystone Palo Alto. To add
to the party atmosphere, there
will be a variety of local bands
supplying their musical wares.
Headlining this extravaganza is
Eddie and the Tide, who is one
of the hottest bands in the area
right now. In a relatively short
time, Eddie and the Tide has
emerged out of the garages in its
home turf of Santa Cruz to
become one of the best club
bands in Northern California.
The band was recently awarded
the cover story in BAM maga
zine (BAM stands for Bay Area
Music, for those who don't read
it) which attests to its local fame
and popularity.
As for a little background,
Eddie and the Tide have been
around for about five years.
Though the band formed in
Santa Cruz, both "Eddie" Rice,
the lead vocalist and rhythm
guitarist, and Scott Mason, the
drummer, hailed originally from
Nashville. This "Nashville" in
fluence on a predominantly Cal
ifornia rock band is an impor
tant factor in the band's make
up since it can account for the
band's fine sense of tightness
and interplay (as is noted with

Nashville's session musicians.)
This, then, places it apart from
the the limited, run of the mill
California club bands. Even
Rice, in an interview with this
reviewer, was keen to point out
the innate influence of Nash
ville's sound. He particularly
noted that he grew up listening
to Creedence Clearwater
Revival, whose sound was
greatly influenced by the
country and western sound of
Nashville.
Eddie and the Tide, however,
is not particularly a CCR-copy
band. The band incorporates a
variety of style which all add to
its own sound. In fact, it reminds
me of the early Greg Kihn
Band. The band combines early
'60s spunk rock with some mu
sical flourishes, courtesy of
Bruce Springsteen. As its six
song EP. Maybe I'll Gel Lucky
(which spawned the San Fran
cisco hit, "Running Wild, Run
ning Free," and which won it a
highly touted BAMMIE award)
displayed, the band had the
ability to be diverse and yet be
distinctly consistent.
One of the band's major
breaks was entering into a man
agement deal with the Keystone
company. In about 2Vi
years with the Keystone,
the band has been growing in
popularity throughout Northern
California and has even

ventured out to Southern Cali
fornia and Nevada. As proof of
this growing popularity, the
band was the second-place
finalist in the closely watched
"MTV Basement Tapes" con
test (which featured new, un
signed acts so as to gain ther.
exposure and publicity.) This
week, in fact, is the release date
of its debut album which is en
titled V Do It For You (the al
bum is being released on its own
"Spin" label.) It includes
"Running Wild, Running Free,"
along with an array of other
tunes which should garner the
group some local and college
airplay. Especially noteworthy
is the hypnotic "Till I Can't Run
No More," and the frolicsome
"Make Every Second Count."
With this exposure, the band
hopes to sign with a major
record label in the immediate
future.
Right now, though, the band
is constantly working to win
over club audiences and the
like. After all, rock 'n' roll
began in the clubs and it still
begins there. Therefore, this
band believes in doing things
the old (and proper way). It
knows that it will have to pay its
dues in performing to uni
nitiated listeners, but it realizes
that the rewards of the future
far outweigh the pains and pres
sures of the present.

So far, the band seems suc
cessful. It was recently invited to
open days for Huey l ewis and
the News' tour of the northwes
tern part of the country, and
from doing this, the band feels
that it aquired much in the style,
class and verve that a band
needs to command a larger au
dience.
As for its future goals, the
band feels that breaking out
cross-country and signing with a
major record label are not the

most pressing and important
ones. This is what the band has
been shooting for and it seems
intent on succeeding. The whole
band (which, besides Rice and
drummer Mason, also includes
George Diebold on bass and
Cazz on keyboards) represents
the belief in the power of rock
'n' roll to generate positive
results. Hopefully, such a belief
will pay off for the band and
give it the positive results it
deserves.

finalist in the closely watched
"MTV Basement Tapes" con
test (which featured new, un
signed acts so as to gain ther.
exposure and publicity.) This
week, in fact, is the release date
of its debut album which is en
titled V Do It For You (the al
bum is being released on its own
"Spin" label.) It includes
"Running Wild, Running Free,"
along with an array of other
tunes which should garner the
group some local and college
airplay. Especially noteworthy
is the hypnotic "Till I Can't Run
No More," and the frolicsome
"Make Every Second Count."
With this exposure, the band
hopes to sign with a major
record label in the immediate
future.
Right now, though, the band
is constantly working to win
over club audiences and the
like. After all, rock 'n' roll
began in the clubs and it still
begins there. Therefore, this
band believes in doing things
the old (and proper way). It
knows that it will have to pay its
dues in performing to uni
nitiated listeners, but it realizes
that the rewards of the future
far outweigh the pains and pres
sures of the present.

So far, the band seems suc
cessful. It was recently invited to
open days for Huey l ewis and
the News' tour of the northwes
tern part of the country, and
from doing this, the band feels
that it aquired much in the style,
class and verve that a band
needs to command a larger au
dience.
As for its future goals, the
band feels that breaking out
cross-country and signing with a
major record label are not the

most pressing and important
ones. This is what the band has
been shooting for and it seems
intent on succeeding. The whole
band (which, besides Rice and
drummer Mason, also includes
George Diebold on bass and
Cazz on keyboards) represents
the belief in the power of rock
'n' roll to generate positive
results. Hopefully, such a belief
will pay off for the band and
give it the positive results it
deserves.
