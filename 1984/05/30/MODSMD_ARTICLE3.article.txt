Because of the recent rent increases in Escon
dido Village, the University is forming a commit
tee to assist graduate students whose financial
needs are no longer being met by established
sources, according to Associate Dean Jean l etter.
The Grant-in-Aid Committee will recommend
grants for graduate students in need of aid due to
extenuating personal circumstances. Doctoral
level graduate students who are currently regis
tered and making satisfactory academic progress
will he eligible to apply for grants-in-aid.
The grants are intended to supplement the need
based as well as the merit-based loan programs
already in existence. Fetter said.
"This is a no-strings-attached grant. I muled
through the graduate fellowship reserve." she said.

letter said the committee doesn't know how
main people will respond or what their needs will
he.
According to Fetter, the committee still has not
decided exactly what information will be required
in the application process. However, the commit
tee will meet soon to establish guidelines.
" I he ti rst step will be to develop the procedures
for eligibility and to determine exactly how we'll
decide w ho gets these grants." l etter explained.
I he committee will also decide "how we should
ask the applicant to prove to us the extent of his
needs, l etter said.
The committee will be made up of faculty and
graduate students from the I niversitv Committee
on Graduate. Studies and staff members from the
112 inancial Aid and Graduate Studies Research
Offices.
Some graduate students responded favorablv to

the decision to establish the committee;
"This is a good idea in light of the tact of the
subsidization of undergraduates b\ Kscondido
rents." said Marc Lewis, a graduate student in
business. "It'll help ullc\iate some of the need."
However. Tom l.utz. a graduate student living in
Escondido Village, said the t niversitv â€¢'shouldn't
pretend that it is an\ kind of response to the Vil
lage rent issue."
"I know that people resent being asked to go
begging to the I ni\ersit\ because it's not living up
to its agreement.' Lutz added.
John McMatius. another graduate student in Ls
condido \ illage. said the rent problem is struc
tural. and not easil\ fixed b\ a one-time applica
tion of mone\.
"A one-time Band-Aid won't do it. but it's still
good that an effort is being made to help those who
reall\ need it." McManus said.
