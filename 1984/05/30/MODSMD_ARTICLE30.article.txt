On any other day. . . . You remem
ber that great Police song in which the
poor suburban man suffers one of
those kind of days, where his toast is
burnt and his dog bites him and his
teenage daughter runs away. Well, this
is one of those days.
Maybe it's the heat. Maybe it's the

end of year let-down. Maybe it's a
summer in Sacramento. "Hot time,
summer in the city, back of my neck
getting ..." I never could figure out
the rest of that line. I guess that makes
it worse.
But happy times are ahead, they
say. The Daily Banquet, that bi
annual evening during which we all
look through a two-way looking glass
to see our Alice, happens a week from
tonight at the Prime Rib Inn. The
editor, offering choices of prime rib
(surprise) and chicken teriyaki, prom

ises a grand evening in the highest
style, but this from the man in the yel
low velour baseball shirt.
The Dead Week (an aptly morbidly
dubbed duration) issue of The Daily
comes out a week from today as well,
so all you would-be writers may make
me less desperate and come in now for
one last surge.
"But desperate-sounding Brieflys
turn people away," he said. But des
perate is desperate. I'm not sure why.
I just feel desperate. And that's all.
Strange days indeed.
