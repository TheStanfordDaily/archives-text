## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
United Stanford Workers (USW) officials apologized
yesterday for any impact their threatened picket may have
had on Democratic presidential candidate Walter
Mondale's decision to cancel a scheduled speech on
campus.
The statement of apology was the result of discussions
between USW representatives and ASSU Senators Mark
Landesmann and Jon Adelstein, two sponsors of an ASSU
resolution supporting the USW. The resolution, also spon
sored by Senators John Boranian, Robert Slater and Su
Uhland, will be voted on at tonight's meeting following an
open torum featuring USW and University representa
tives.
Priscilla Wheeler, University staff counsel, and Robert
Freelen. vice president of public affairs for the University,
will explain the University's position at the 7 p.m. meeting
at the Law School. Linda Crouse, USW president, and
David Stevens, a USW steward at the Medical Center, will
present the union's position.
Landesmann said most members of the ASSU Senate
support the USW but some senators "objected strongly to

the destructive action by the USW leadership" in threat
ening to picket Mondale's speech.
Because of these objections, Landesmann said he con
tacted USW leaders yesterday evening and told them
ASSU support was "basically contingent on their issuing a
statement acknowledging three things."
The USW was asked <o say in its statement that any im
pact on Mondale's decision not to come was unintentional,
that USW leaders apologized for any impact they might
have had and that the USW would not interfere with
future events without first consulting student organizers.
"If they want our support, than they have to show some
consideration for our events that we sponsor," Landes
mann said.
USW leaders "committed themselves to definitely is
suing a statement," Landesmann said.
Copies of the statement will be given to Stanford-in-
Government, Students for Mondale, the ASSU Speakers
Bureau and sponsors of the resolution, according to Lan
desmann.
The ASSU resolution is likely to
p;iss now that USW has issued a state
ment. I.andesmann said.
"We essentially see what happened
with Mondale as kind of an accident."
he said. "We just wanted them to
know that their action, though not in
tentional. might have an effect on the
way that students fee I about them."
Adelstein encouraged any inter
ested students to attend tonight's
meeting, emphasizing "it's the first
time the two legal counsels will meet
in a public forum before the commu
nity."
