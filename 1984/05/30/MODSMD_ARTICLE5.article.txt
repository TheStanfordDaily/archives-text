It Provost Albert Hastorf declines
to reverse her tenure denial. Asst. Re
ligious Studies Prof. Diana Paul says
she may take legal action against the
University.
English Prof. A 1 Gelpi is currently
considering Paul's appeal to Hastorf.
Gelpi can recommend that Hastorf
overturn the decision or give Paul a
new review.
Paul said that she was supposed to
receive a response from Hastorf by
May 25. but that she has still not
received one. The decision is expected
by the end of the week, she added.
However. Paul already has contin
gency plans. "If the answer turns out
to be negative, which 1 think it will be
. . . I'll review my legal options," Paul
said. "I've already filed with the Equal
Opportunity Employment Commis
sion."
The basis of that complaint is possi
ble "sex and race discrimination" by
the University, according to Paul.
In a previous Daily article, English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz, who is serving

as Paul's grievance adviser, said
"there seems to be no sexual discrimi
nation. but one cannot ignore the fact
that there are no tenured women in

the department." And considering
that Paul is a member of a minority
group (she is part Japanese) as well as
being a woman, she was denied 'the
special care called for by the faculty
affirmative action report." Rebholz
said.
Paul has scheduled a fund-raising
party for June 15 to raise money to
cover her previous and future legal
fees, she said. There has also been a
Diana Paul Legal Defense Fund es
tablished under the auspices of the
National Women's Studies Associa
tion.
A letter being circulated by Rebholz
states that Paul's case is so strong that
she "must now take it to court."
'"The lawyers she's consulted ihfn√ü"
that she has a good chance of win
ning," the letter adds.
Rebholz also questioned the ap
propriateness of the 1 1 referees who
were selected by the Religious Studies
Department to evaluate Paul's work.
The recommendations of the referees
were considered by the five-member
