# Awaits provost's decision on appeal
## Paul may sue for tenure 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
Senior staff writer
It Provost Albert Hastorf declines
to reverse her tenure denial. Asst. Re
ligious Studies Prof. Diana Paul says
she may take legal action against the
University.
English Prof. A 1 Gelpi is currently
considering Paul's appeal to Hastorf.
Gelpi can recommend that Hastorf
overturn the decision or give Paul a
new review.
Paul said that she was supposed to
receive a response from Hastorf by
May 25. but that she has still not
received one. The decision is expected
by the end of the week, she added.
However. Paul already has contin
gency plans. "If the answer turns out
to be negative, which 1 think it will be
. . . I'll review my legal options," Paul
said. "I've already filed with the Equal
Opportunity Employment Commis
sion."
The basis of that complaint is possi
ble "sex and race discrimination" by
the University, according to Paul.
In a previous Daily article, English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz, who is serving

as Paul's grievance adviser, said
"there seems to be no sexual discrimi
nation. but one cannot ignore the fact
that there are no tenured women in

the department." And considering
that Paul is a member of a minority
group (she is part Japanese) as well as
being a woman, she was denied 'the
special care called for by the faculty
affirmative action report." Rebholz
said.
Paul has scheduled a fund-raising
party for June 15 to raise money to
cover her previous and future legal
fees, she said. There has also been a
Diana Paul Legal Defense Fund es
tablished under the auspices of the
National Women's Studies Associa
tion.
A letter being circulated by Rebholz
states that Paul's case is so strong that
she "must now take it to court."
'"The lawyers she's consulted ihfnß"
that she has a good chance of win
ning," the letter adds.
Rebholz also questioned the ap
propriateness of the 1 1 referees who
were selected by the Religious Studies
Department to evaluate Paul's work.
The recommendations of the referees
were considered by the five-member


Diana Paul
Threatens legal action
Religious Studies "personnel commit
tee." which decides on the depart
ment's tenure appointments.
Rebholz said the department inac
curately defined Paul's field of re
search as "Chinese thought and reli
gion" when conducting its nationwide
search for evaluators.
"My real field is Chinese Bud
dhism." Paul said.
Paul also said the department over
emphasized her infrequent graduate

teaching and downplayed her
undergraduate teaching.
Paul appealed her tenure refusal to
Norman Wessells, dean of Humanities
and Sciences, after the Religious
Studies Department rejected her first
appeal on Dec. 1, 1983.
Wessells appointed Emeritus His
tory Prof. Gordon Craig to evaluate
her appeal. On April 27, Wessells
rejected the appeal on Craig's recom
mendation. But Craig did state that
Paul's teaching should have been
evaluated as excellent rather than
good to very good, as it had been
originally evaluated.
Rebholz also claims that the depart

ment omitted important examples ot
Paul's work and University service.
Reviews of two of Paul's books were
not considered by the outside referees,
nor was Paul's serv ice as resident fel
low at Soto for live years.
"I have also been active in Feminist
Studies, which I doubt the Religious
Studies Department took into ac
count," Paul said.
Paul has also complained that she
was not allowed to see the letters from
the various referees and that an inac
curate timetable for the tenure review
forced her to submit an unrevised
manuscript to the outside referees.
