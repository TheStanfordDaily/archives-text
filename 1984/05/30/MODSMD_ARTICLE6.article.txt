# Senate gets the boot after pie altercation
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Daily staff 
A pie fight at last week's ASSU sen
ate meeting has left egg on the face of
the senate, which won't be able to
hold a meeting today in its usual place
â€” the Graduate School of Business.
Incoming senate chair Eric Berg
said yesterday an altercation between
as-yet unidentified pie-throwers and
members of the senate caused the
Business School to eject the senate
from its usual meeting place. The sen
ate will meet today in Room 95 in the
Law School.
"They kicked us out," Berg said
yesterday."I do hope I'll be able to
patch things up with them."
Barbara Taddeo, the building
manager of the Business School, said
the altercation caused $250 worth of
damage. She said the ASSU will
"absolutely, positively not" be able to
meet in the Business School next year.
Berg refused to comment on who he
thought was responsible for the attack
on the senate, but a source who asked
not to be identified by name said. "It
was definitely people associated with
the Chaparral (magazine)."
Jim Kohn, an ASSU senator, said
members of the senate had been

forewarned about an imminent attack.
The meeting was the last of the this
year's senate, and unidentified attack
ers pied graduate senator Jim
McGrath at the last meeting of last
year's senate.
Kohn said he and other senators
bought five pies which they filled with
shaving cream to fend off the expected
attack.
"At about 9:30 they came wearing
masks, army stuff and carrying guns,"
Kohn said. "We hit some of them with
shaving cream pies. It was a lot of fun.
There was shaving cream all over the
place."
Kohn said the attackers hit senator
Mark Soble, Berg and former Council
of Presidents member Vincent Freda
with shaving cream pies.
Staff members of the Chaparral
denied any involvement in the prank.
"1 can tell you that it wasn't an offi
cially sanctioned Chaparral event or
program." said, Ron Fernandez, the
editor of the magazine.
Fernandez said it livas
"unfortunate" that the ASSU was
ejected from the Business School.
Mike Collins, a copy editor for the
Chaparral, said "we don't know who
did it. but if you find out, we'll hire
them."
Taddeo said the mess left by the al
tercation was not cleaned up until the

next morning when classes began in
the room.
"Everything was fermented. It had
permeated into the woodwork. There
was even some stuff on the ceiling,"
Taddeo said.
She said the Business School had to
hire professional cleaners to strip and
clean the floor. The people involved in

the fight have "a complete disregard
of property," Taddeo said.
Berg said he is expecting a bill from
the Business School but said he hopes
the ASSU will be able to meet there
next year.
He refused to comment when asked
whether he was planning any legal ac
tion against the people responsible for
the attack.
