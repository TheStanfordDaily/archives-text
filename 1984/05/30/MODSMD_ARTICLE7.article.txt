U.S., japan will open markets
Washington — The United States and Japan unveiled a
wide-ranging pact yesterday to gradually open Japanese fin
ancial markets and boost the role of the \en in international
trade.
Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan hailed the agree
ment as likely to "redress many of the problems" that have
prevented U.S. companies and financial institutions from
freely operating in Japan. It was reached after four months of
negotiations that began in the wake of President Reagan's
visit to Tokyo last November.
Regan also argued that the agreement should "strengthen
the yen in relation to the dollar" over the long run, but he
would not predict what the immediate effect of the pact
would be in international currency markets.
For more than two years, U.S. manufacturers (led by
Caterpillar Corp., one of the nation's leading exporters) have
been complaining that a cheap yen hurts their business by
making Japanese goods less expensive in world markets,
which helps to swell the huge $26 billion U.S. trade deficit
with Japan.
Many analysts say. however, that the Japanese concessions
are unlikely to shrink the U.S. trade deficit soon. The yen is
expected to fall even further once the Japanese are given
greater freedom to invest abroad.
Incumbents win in Egypt
Cairo, Egypt —The ruling National Democratic Party has
won a crushing victory over four opposition groups in the first
elections to the Egyptian parliament since Hosni Mubarak
became president.
Announcing the results of Sunday's voting. Interior Mini
ster Hassan Abu Basha said the Democratic Party won 73
percent of the total, giving it 391 ot the 448 elected seats in
the People's Assembly.
The only other party to get a large enough vote to qualify
was the right-wing New Wafd Party, which received 15.1 per
cent, giving it 57 seats in the new assembly.
The three other parties in the election — the leftist Socialist
Labor with 7.1 percent and Unionist Progressives with 4.2
percent, and the right-of-center Liberals with 0.7 percent —
all failed to win the 8 percent minimum required for repre
sentation in the parliament.
The Labor Party, led by Ibrahim Shukri, constituted the
main opposition bloc of the outgoing parliament and the
Liberals had a small representation in it. Now both have been
knocked out, leaving only the Wafd to challenge the govern
ment, but without enough strength to be a real problem to it.
Thus what had been heralded by Mubarak as the most
"free, honest and sincere," elections in 60 years and the ad
vent of "true democracy" has apparently resulted in an as
sembly more tightly controlled by the ruling party than ever
before and with fewer opposition groups represented.
Diplomat beaten in U.S.S.R.
Moscow —An American diplomat was attacked and beaten
by several unidentified men in Leningrad last month in an as
sault that U.S. officials believe was organized by Soviet auth
orities in an atmosphere of increasingly cold relations with the
United States.
The diplomat, Ronald Harms, was not seriously injured in
the attack, which reportedly occurred April 17. According to
sources familiar with the incident, the State Department and
the U.S. Embassy vigorously protested to Soviet officials in
Washington and Moscow. But in keeping with a standing U.S.
practice, the assault was not publicly disclosed.
According to the sources, who asked not to be identified,
the incident occurred as Harms, 35, one of a dozen U.S..
diplomats serving in the U.S. Consulate in Leningrad, left a
restaurant where he had met with a Soviet acquaintance.
Several unidentified men in civilian clothes were said to
have surrounded Harms on the sidewalk, beating him in plain
view of passersby. Harms immediately hailed a uniformed
police officer to report the attack, but the officer is said to
have shown little interest.
Dealers fear end to auto quotas
Los Angeles — If the government adopts U.S. Trade Rep
resentative William Brock's proposal to let Japanese automo
bile import quotas expire next year. West Coast car dealers
will suffer reduced businesss, the dealers say.
"We would lose about 25 percent of our business," said
Robert Ruehman, owner of a Pontiac dealership in North
Hollywood.
Ruehman said the import restraints, which were imple
mented during the recession in 1981, "helped increase our
business."
Brock's proposal "scares the hell out of me," said Brian
Wilson, a Dodge dealer in Tacoma, Wash. He said he could
lose 10 percent to 15 percent of his business. "We're closer
(to Japan). It's cheaper for them to ship cars here than to the
East Coast."
Under pressure from the United States. Japan initiated vo
luntary limits on auto exports to America. In the first three
years, Japan limited its passenger car exports to America to
1.65 million units annually. In the fourth year, the ceiling was
raised to 1.85 million units.
On May 1. Brock, angered by big bonuses paid U.S. auto
industry executives, warned that the Reagan Administration
is considering letting the import quotas on Japanese auto
makers expire next March.
Administration studies effects
of nuclear catastrophe
Washington — The Reagan administration is beginning a
national research program to find out if a nuclear war would
trigger the worldwide weather catastrophe called "nuclear
winter."
After initial suspicion and debate in the administration
about whether the nuclear winter discussion was merely a
veiled attack on Reagan defense policy, the president's sci
ence adviser, George Keyworth. approved the project as a
nonpolitical scientific mission.
Several federal facilities are studying the problem, includ
ing a nine-person team at Lawrence Livermore National Lab
oratory and a group at the Defense Nuclear Agency. But the
new program would cost several million dollars a year for the
three prime years of study, and would include not only
massive calculations on supercomputers but also some experi
ments in which city-sized fires would be set to measure their
intensity and ability to throw soot into the upper atmosphere.
Dow Jones continues slump
New York —The stock market moved broadly lower in
light trading yesterday and its best-known indicator estab
lished a new 15-month low as a three-day holiday weekend
did little to brighten the market's recent gloomy mood.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 3.67
points on Friday, fell 5.86 to 1 101.24. It was the lowest close
for Wall Street's best-known indicator since it finished at
1096.94 on Feb. 23, 1983.

U.S., japan will open markets
Washington — The United States and Japan unveiled a
wide-ranging pact yesterday to gradually open Japanese fin
ancial markets and boost the role of the \en in international
trade.
Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan hailed the agree
ment as likely to "redress many of the problems" that have
prevented U.S. companies and financial institutions from
freely operating in Japan. It was reached after four months of
negotiations that began in the wake of President Reagan's
visit to Tokyo last November.
Regan also argued that the agreement should "strengthen
the yen in relation to the dollar" over the long run, but he
would not predict what the immediate effect of the pact
would be in international currency markets.
For more than two years, U.S. manufacturers (led by
Caterpillar Corp., one of the nation's leading exporters) have
been complaining that a cheap yen hurts their business by
making Japanese goods less expensive in world markets,
which helps to swell the huge $26 billion U.S. trade deficit
with Japan.
Many analysts say. however, that the Japanese concessions
are unlikely to shrink the U.S. trade deficit soon. The yen is
expected to fall even further once the Japanese are given
greater freedom to invest abroad.
Incumbents win in Egypt
Cairo, Egypt —The ruling National Democratic Party has
won a crushing victory over four opposition groups in the first
elections to the Egyptian parliament since Hosni Mubarak
became president.
Announcing the results of Sunday's voting. Interior Mini
ster Hassan Abu Basha said the Democratic Party won 73
percent of the total, giving it 391 ot the 448 elected seats in
the People's Assembly.
The only other party to get a large enough vote to qualify
was the right-wing New Wafd Party, which received 15.1 per
cent, giving it 57 seats in the new assembly.
The three other parties in the election — the leftist Socialist
Labor with 7.1 percent and Unionist Progressives with 4.2
percent, and the right-of-center Liberals with 0.7 percent —
all failed to win the 8 percent minimum required for repre
sentation in the parliament.
The Labor Party, led by Ibrahim Shukri, constituted the
main opposition bloc of the outgoing parliament and the
Liberals had a small representation in it. Now both have been
knocked out, leaving only the Wafd to challenge the govern
ment, but without enough strength to be a real problem to it.
Thus what had been heralded by Mubarak as the most
"free, honest and sincere," elections in 60 years and the ad
vent of "true democracy" has apparently resulted in an as
sembly more tightly controlled by the ruling party than ever
before and with fewer opposition groups represented.
Diplomat beaten in U.S.S.R.
Moscow —An American diplomat was attacked and beaten
by several unidentified men in Leningrad last month in an as
sault that U.S. officials believe was organized by Soviet auth
orities in an atmosphere of increasingly cold relations with the
United States.
The diplomat, Ronald Harms, was not seriously injured in
the attack, which reportedly occurred April 17. According to
sources familiar with the incident, the State Department and
the U.S. Embassy vigorously protested to Soviet officials in
Washington and Moscow. But in keeping with a standing U.S.
practice, the assault was not publicly disclosed.
According to the sources, who asked not to be identified,
the incident occurred as Harms, 35, one of a dozen U.S..
diplomats serving in the U.S. Consulate in Leningrad, left a
restaurant where he had met with a Soviet acquaintance.
Several unidentified men in civilian clothes were said to
have surrounded Harms on the sidewalk, beating him in plain
view of passersby. Harms immediately hailed a uniformed
police officer to report the attack, but the officer is said to
have shown little interest.
Dealers fear end to auto quotas
Los Angeles — If the government adopts U.S. Trade Rep
resentative William Brock's proposal to let Japanese automo
bile import quotas expire next year. West Coast car dealers
will suffer reduced businesss, the dealers say.
"We would lose about 25 percent of our business," said
Robert Ruehman, owner of a Pontiac dealership in North
Hollywood.
Ruehman said the import restraints, which were imple
mented during the recession in 1981, "helped increase our
business."
Brock's proposal "scares the hell out of me," said Brian
Wilson, a Dodge dealer in Tacoma, Wash. He said he could
lose 10 percent to 15 percent of his business. "We're closer
(to Japan). It's cheaper for them to ship cars here than to the
East Coast."
Under pressure from the United States. Japan initiated vo
luntary limits on auto exports to America. In the first three
years, Japan limited its passenger car exports to America to
1.65 million units annually. In the fourth year, the ceiling was
raised to 1.85 million units.
On May 1. Brock, angered by big bonuses paid U.S. auto
industry executives, warned that the Reagan Administration
is considering letting the import quotas on Japanese auto
makers expire next March.
Administration studies effects
of nuclear catastrophe
Washington — The Reagan administration is beginning a
national research program to find out if a nuclear war would
trigger the worldwide weather catastrophe called "nuclear
winter."
After initial suspicion and debate in the administration
about whether the nuclear winter discussion was merely a
veiled attack on Reagan defense policy, the president's sci
ence adviser, George Keyworth. approved the project as a
nonpolitical scientific mission.
Several federal facilities are studying the problem, includ
ing a nine-person team at Lawrence Livermore National Lab
oratory and a group at the Defense Nuclear Agency. But the
new program would cost several million dollars a year for the
three prime years of study, and would include not only
massive calculations on supercomputers but also some experi
ments in which city-sized fires would be set to measure their
intensity and ability to throw soot into the upper atmosphere.
Dow Jones continues slump
