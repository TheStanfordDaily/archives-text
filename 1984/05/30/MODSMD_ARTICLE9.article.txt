# Court to hear selective draft prosecution case
## 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — The Supreme Court,
moving to settle a conflict over the mili
tary draft and free speech, agreed yester
day to decide whether the government
may single out protesters for prosecution
for failing to register with the Selective
Service.
In a brief order, the justices said they
would review the case of David Wayte, a
former Yale University philosophy stu
dent from Pasadena who had spoken at
demonstrations, appeared on radio and
television and written the White House
twice stating his intention not to sign up
for the draft.

Wiiyte, 23. contended that his subse
quent indictment represented improper
"selective prosecution" by the Depart
ment of Justice. U.S. District Judge
Terry Hatter of Los Angeles agreed
and dismissed the indictment. But the
charge was reinstated last July by the
U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in
San Francisco.
A federal appeals court in Cincinnati,
meanwhile, had ruled that seeking out
vocal draft opponents for prosecution
violated the right to free speech. The Su
preme Court, faced with a conflict be
tween appellate courts, agreed to hear
Wayte's case to resolve the dispute. A
decision is expected next year.

Draft registration, but not the draft,
was reinstated by President Carter in
1980 after the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan. Draft-age males who tail to
register face imprisonment tor as much
as five years and a $10,000 line. About
97 percent of more than 11 million men
now are registered, according to
Selective Service officials.
Wayte's case (Wayte v. United States.
83-1292) emerged in 1982, when up to one
million men had failed to.register, and
draft resisters were rallying across the
nation. The government at that time en
gaged in what it called "passive enforce
ment" of the law, acting only on infor
mation prosecutors received about non

registrants — including data from those
who wrote in to say that they were refus
ing to sign up.
By mid-1983, only 15 others besides
Wayte had been prosecuted. Now the
government says it is actively pursuing
"persistent non-registrants." Compli
ance also has been spurred by a 19N2 law
that denies grants, loans and other
federal educational assistance to college
students who fail to register. The validity
ol that law is before the Supreme Court
in another case (Selective Serv ice v. Min
nesota Public Interest Research Group.
N3-276), which is expected to be decided
by July.
