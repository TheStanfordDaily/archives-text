## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Six months ot deliberation will end
tomorrow when the Task Force to
Study Fraternities and Sororities an
nounces its final recommendations.
A series of statements ratified by
the task force will be released at the
Row Office, according to Business
School Prof. Oscar Serbein, chairman
of the 18-mcmber committee.
The report will be reviewed by
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
before reaching the Administrative
Council.
"I'll make judgments about what, if
any, further action or discussion is
necessary, whether (the recommenda
tion) should be reviewed by other
groups," Lyons said.
"Nothing will happen this summer,"
he added.
He called the task force's decisions
"a fairly weighty recommendation,"
reached only after a "thorough" ex
amination of the current fraternal sys
tem at Stanford.
"I don't have a view (on fraterni
ties) that will not be influenced by the
task force recommendation," he said.
All members of the task force
agreed at yesterday's final meeting not
to discuss their decisions until Friday.
They have hinted in recent weeks
that the chief focus of their discussion
has been the issue of subjective selec
tion in assigning students University
housing.
"There is strong sentiment that sub
jective selectivity and University
housing are incompatible and the task
force is considering alternatives to the
current situation," a statement the
task force released two weeks ago
read.
"The task force is still questioning
the place of subjective groups at Stan
lord, including University recognition
of such groups and the allocation of
resources to such yroups."
