# Time capsules: a cure for centennial forgetfulness
## 
### MARC PEYSER Daily staff 
A hundred years from now,
few outside of the History De
partment or the Archives will
remember that 1983-84 was the
year that saw the U.S. invasion
of Grenada or the first students
move into Sterling Quad. Most
likely, no one will have even
heard of Fred Hargadon or know
that 19N4 was Ins last year on
the Farm.
But come 20N4, Stanfordians
will he renewing a ritual that
had been begun 91 years earlier
— a bronze-encased tradition
containing artifacts and
mementos of campus and na
tional happenings of the day.
When students and faculty open
the Senior Time Capsule laid to
rest in 1984, they will be rein
formed about the activities of
their campus predecessors.
But this year's capsule hasn't
been installed yet, and the
Senior Class presidents are still
in the process of deciding which
objects will represent their year
when they bury their capsule on
June 16, the day before Com
mencement.
According to Andy Chan, one
of the four Senior Class presi
dents, the objects will be
divided into three areas. In
cluded in the "fads and ideas of
the '80s" category will be things
like a pair of Risky Business
glasses, tapes of The Big Chill
and Thriller and a leather tie.
Newspaper articles will com
prise the majority of the items in
the other two groups — campus
and national news. Some of the
topics represented will be the
Reagan library, Theodore
Streleski and Lebanon. A poster
of Hargadon will also be in
cluded.
Unlike last year, when the
Class of '83 put in some choco
late frozen yogurt, no
perishables will be included.
"That's gross," said Chan.
"The ideas are unlimited,"
said president Rick Naimark,
"but the space is not that big."
In fact, the space is almost
miniscule, only 15 inches by 15
inches by five inches deep. So,
even though the presidents
"asked a lot of people" for
ideas. Chan said that they still
must mtrraw the list.

The tradition of laying the
senior plaque, the bronze
cover for the capsule, was begun
in the late 1800s by Robert
Campbell, treasurer of the Class
of 1896. As the initiator of the
tradition, Campbell was able to
choose the most choice spot on
campus — directly in front of
the main entrance of Memorial
Church.
Not to be outdone, however,
anonymous members of the
Class of '95 painted on their
own plaque in the square right
before the one the Class of '96
had placed. After this "bogus"
cover was washed off by the rain
a few times, members of the
class got together and installed a
r<.nt one in 1 W.?. Shortly thcre

after, in 1917 and 1919, mem
bers of the Classes of '92, '93
and '94 got into the act and
placed capsules as well. The cost
of these early plaques was
somewhere between $10 and
$12.
These days, the cover runs
much higher, around $700, of
which half is paid by the Office
of the President. Nonetheless,
the higher price does not keep
the tradition from being an im
portant one.
"It's really special, a gim
mick," said Chan. "It's neat to
think what relates to you will be
opened in 100 years by people
with no relation to you. 1 think
they'// get it hik£ kick out ()/ It."

Last year, students threw their I.D.sand meal cards into the
time capsule in a bid for immortality.
