## The 						Stanford Daily Humanity interface 
### 
University President Donald Kennedy has
made it clear to the community that the
humanities should have increasing importance in
undergraduate education. College is supposed to
prepare students for life, rather than a profes
sional career, so a well-rounded study program is
encouraged.
Diversity of academic subjects is not a strong
feature ol the Engineering School however. En
gineers have a difficult time meeting their distri
bution requirements, and their decision to
become engineers must be made freshman year.
Kennedy has made it clear that he won't sacrifice
the excellence of the engineering program in or
der to *' humanitize" engineers.
Given this situation, the decision to create a
new "software engineering" major is a sensible
one. Good programmers are heavily demanded in
this age of high technology, and if Stanford wishes
to remain a leader in the field, a programming
major is practically required.

Currently, many students who want to be
programmers major in math sciences. This is the
closest major to a programming major, but it re
quires taking upper-level math classes and other
subjects which have no direct relevance to pro
gramming.
A software engineering major would provide
those students with an opportunity to pursue that
direction fairly singlemindedly and with a good
competitive background for the job market.
Programming skills are important, and they are
a valid subject to be studied. We hope that the re
quirements of the proposed software engineering
major will not be as stringent as implied by the
Engineering School, and that students who
choose this major will be allowed to diversify
their courses.
Perhaps excellence in engineering can be
achieved without sacrificing the humanities. Let's
try.
