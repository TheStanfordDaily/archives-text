## Abstention the right solution for unwanted pregnancies 
### 
I'm sorry. I've been doing a
remarkable job of restraining myself
from writing a viewpoint on abortion
because my opinion has a very holier
than-thou sound to it and 1 will no
doubt irritate a good many people. So,
I want to apologize in advance to

VIEWPOINT

Daily editors tor the mountains of
mail they're going to receive denounc
ing the self-righteous and judgmental
tone of my outburst.
I am finally writing because I have
read one opinion too many in which
the fallibility of contraceptives is cited
as a reason for condoning non
therapeutic abortions. If this is such a
well-known fact, as is apparent from
the pieces which have recently graced
this page, why do people who are not
willing to have a baby have sex?
A certain number of unwanted
pregnancies no doubt result from
people being uneducated about the
means of reproduction, and many
more are certainly the result of incest
and rape, but nobody will ever con
vince me that 1.5 million abortions a
year are needed to rectify the ills of ig
norance and sexual abuse in this
country. These are special cases, and I
am not addressing them.
As I see it, given the knowledge that
abstention is the only foolproof con
traceptive, the problem of unwanted
pregnancies comes down to this:
Don't have sex when you aren't will
ing to become a parent. Then, with
every pregnancy a wanted one or at
least an accepted one, we can spend
the money now being spent on abor
tions to make this a better world into
which to bring children. By not having
intercourse, those who don't want to
subject children to life in this world
can show their convictions by their ac
tions. which speak a lot louder than
viewpoints.
I can hear it already.
"I have the right to do what I want
with my body." Fine, but somewhere
along the line the notion became
popular that rights exist in vacuums as
absolutes. They don't. Rights entail
responsibilities. The right to a free

press entails the responsibility not to
libel. The right to free speech entails
the responsibility not to slander. It is
because people have repeatedly
ignored the responsibilities entailed by
the right to bear arms that that right
may soon be modified.
I can't imagine where the notion of
"the right to consequence-free inter
course" came from. Intercourse and
pregnancy go together far more
naturally than do people and free
speech or the right to carry around

The problem of un
wanted pregnancies is
this: Don't have sex
when you aren't willing
to become a parent.

devices that enable one to kill another.
For those concerned with express
ing themselves, love can be shared
through other kinds of physical in
timacy. People need to seriously
reflect on how necessary intercourse is
in most situations. Obviously, this is
idealistic, but it seems to me to be
worth saying.
One of the nicest things about
making abstention rather than abor
tion the answer to unwanted preg
nancies is that it doesn't discriminate
against anybody. The burden is
equally distributed. It is as much a
male contraceptive as it is a female
contraceptive, and it is as available to
the poor as it is to the rich. By the way,
the argument that abortion should be
legal because its prohibition would
discriminate against the poor may be
the most ridiculous thing I've ever
heard. Since when do we enact or
reject laws based on the economic
ability of those who would evade them
to do so?
If all this sounds like a roundabout
way of saying that we need to accept
responsibility for our actions, good;
I'm communicating. To me, two
people who indulge themselves in a

few hours of sensual delight without
the willingness, though not necessarily
the intention, to bring about the po
tential human life which they know
beforehand may result from their ac
tions, represent the very definition of
irresponsibility, yes, even in marriage.
Is it proper to "penalize" a woman
for an unwanted pregnancy? If
"penalize" means holding someone
responsible for their actions, which is
the fundamental tenet of every code of
justice with which I am familiar, yes.
And as soon as a comparable
"penalty" can be found for the men
involved, I'll support that, too. I'm
definitely "pro-choice," but given the
knowledge that the only foolproof
contraceptive is abstention, the choice
belongs in the bedroom. It seems to
me a small sacrifice when compared to
the life of the fetus, not to mention the
anxiety of the parents.
I'm not out to condemn people,
only actions. My harshness and sar
casm have been a mask for feelings
which, when expressed in softer tones,
really wreak havoc on me. My heart
truly goes out to those who have had
to deal with an unwanted pregnancy,
and as I think of the anguish and in
eradicable guilt that no doubt accom
pany many otherwise vibrant and
fresh people who have chosen to have
abortions, tears come to my eyes as I
consider how much easier things might
have been for them if the same
amount of thought had gone into the
decision to have intercourse. And yes,
I am moved just as deeply by the
thought of an unwanted child growing
up economically and emotionally
deprived. So much senseless tragedy.
But abortion is a solution to only one
of those tragedies, and, to me, an un
acceptable one. Abstention prevents
both tragedies.
I'm done now. I've embarrassed
myself, I've probably alienated half of
all the people who know me, and I'll
probably regret this in the morning,
but if this viewpoint, God willing,
plays even the smallest part in pre
venting one unwanted pregnancy,
that's a small price to pay.
