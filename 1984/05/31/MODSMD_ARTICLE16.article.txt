## USW story inaccurate 
### 
The views of United Stanford
Workers' (USW) leaders on the
Mondale cancellation were seriously
distorted by the press yesterday
(Daily, May 30).
No one from USW was interviewed
before this story was published. We
hope this statement clarifies our
position.
USW could not stand silently while
a political candidate supported by
unions was to be introduced by the
University president who is trying to
break our union here. That would
have been intolerable. USW must and
will protest Donald Kennedy's anti
union policies. For us. it is an issue of
survival.
On the other hand, as in past labor
disputes, we are sincerely sorry that
students and the rest of the commu
nity were seriously inconvenienced.
We apologize for that.
It was in the spirit of improving this
kind of communication that we have
recently talked to and written to
student organizations and expressed
our apologies about the Mondale
cancellation.
I.inda Crouse
President, USW
