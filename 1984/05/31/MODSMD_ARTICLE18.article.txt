# An irresponsible party
## 
### 
The Scene: Synergy House Benefit for Nicaragua,
Friday, May 25, 10:30 p.m. Before handing over the $2
donation required for admittance, a young man briefly
questions the Synergy resident manning the contribution
box:
Prospective donor: "So what is this money going to be
used for?"
Synergy representative: "Oh, for a lot of things, it goes
to a grass-roots organization. They'll use it for health and
education . . . just a lot of things."
Prospective donor: "So it's being used for peaceful
purposes?"
Synergy rep: "Uhhh . . . yes." (Donor gives rep his $2
contribution, having been assured that it will be used for
peaceful purposes.) "Thanks."
I stood in line directly behind the "prospective donor."
Having heard that exchange of words, if I were an FBI
agent or a policeman I probably would have considered
closing the party and confiscating the money box, citing
something like "donations collected by misrepresenta
tion," as the reason for my action. Why?
The money collected from party-goers is sent to an or
ganization called the Sandinista Defense Committee
(CDS) — in Nicaragua. Its primary function is law en
forcement, and it collaborates closely with the Sandinista
Army and the internal Sandinista police force. It is hardly
a "peaceful" organization.
Since I stood next in line, the Synergy rep now wanted
my money.
"So this money is going to buy food and clothing?" I
asked.
"Well, no. But we do collect clothing in boxes around
campus which go to the same committee. Mainly it's used
for local projects to improve the economy and health and
education."
"Is any of it going to buy arms?"
"Well, they do have civil defense organizations." He
paused. He appeared uncomfortable with the direction of
my inquiry. "If you want to take a look at those sheets
over there, they'll tell you everything about the commit
tee."
He wouldn't tell me flat out that money would not be
used to buy guns; he wouldn't feed me an outright lie. But
he certainly did his best to obscure the truth. I discovered
what "the truth" was when 1 carefully read the five- or six
page, single-spaced description of the CDS's activities that
had been pasted to the donation table.
Not until the second to the last page of the tedious
report did I find a specific listing of the CDS's functions.
According to the Sandinistas 1 own literature, the top
three functions of the CDS have nothing to do with pro
viding food or clothing or fostering economic progress.
Indeed, those functions cited by Synergy as primary ap
pear conspicuously low on the CDS priority list. The first
part of the list reads as follows:
"The most important tasks of the CDS are:
A.) Cooperation in national defense: voluntary night
watch, civil defense, in collaboration with the Sandinista
Army and Police.
B.) Political consciousness-raising and education, in col

laboration with the government and the the FSI.N
(Sandinista Liberation Front):
C.) Monitoring the behavior of leaders and
functionaries. Promotion of the Adult Education pro
grams in collaboration with the Ministry of Education."
Was I reading a page from Big Brother's Guide to
Stability or the priority list ol a group allegedly dedicated
to improving health and strengthening the economy?
When one translates Sandinista Newspeak into Eng
lish. one finds that contributions to Synergy's fund-raiser
go to an organization whose top three priorities are: to buy
weapons for. and otherwise support, local militias
cooperating with the Sandinista Army and Police: to sup
port government-directed political indoctrination; and to
ensure that all remain loyal to the Sandinista government
by means of a Big Brother-like spy network.

It appears obvious why the Synergy house representa
tive was so tight-lipped and evasive at the donation table:
Prospective donors who knew the truth about CDS
purposes might not want to contribute.
Synergy house member Marc Gimbrerer was clearly
conscious of prospective contributors' uneasiness about
donating money for arms purposes. He was quoted
(Daily, May 25) as saying: "There is a good chance that
Synergy would not have reached this consensus (to have a
benefit for CDS) if they had thought some of the money
would go to buying weapons."
And at least one resident knew for certain that the
money would help purchase arms. Synergy resident Jim
Costain is quoted in the same article: "Some of the money
is known to be used for weapons."
What does an obstruction of the truth in order to collect
donations of the sort I witnessed at Synergy last I riday
night amount to? I'm not a lawyer, but words like "fraud"
and "misrepresentation" come to mind. Nor am I a judge,
but statements like "confiscate deceitfully garnered funds"
and "prohibit further fund-raisers by irresponsible parties"
come to mind also.

pear conspicuously low on the CDS priority list. The first
part of the list reads as follows:
"The most important tasks of the CDS are:
A.) Cooperation in national defense: voluntary night
watch, civil defense, in collaboration with the Sandinista
Army and Police.
B.) Political consciousness-raising and education, in col

laboration with the government and the the FSI.N
(Sandinista Liberation Front):
C.) Monitoring the behavior of leaders and
functionaries. Promotion of the Adult Education pro
grams in collaboration with the Ministry of Education."
Was I reading a page from Big Brother's Guide to
Stability or the priority list ol a group allegedly dedicated
to improving health and strengthening the economy?
When one translates Sandinista Newspeak into Eng
lish. one finds that contributions to Synergy's fund-raiser
go to an organization whose top three priorities are: to buy
weapons for. and otherwise support, local militias
cooperating with the Sandinista Army and Police: to sup
port government-directed political indoctrination; and to
ensure that all remain loyal to the Sandinista government
by means of a Big Brother-like spy network.

It appears obvious why the Synergy house representa
tive was so tight-lipped and evasive at the donation table:
Prospective donors who knew the truth about CDS
purposes might not want to contribute.
Synergy house member Marc Gimbrerer was clearly
conscious of prospective contributors' uneasiness about
donating money for arms purposes. He was quoted
(Daily, May 25) as saying: "There is a good chance that
Synergy would not have reached this consensus (to have a
benefit for CDS) if they had thought some of the money
would go to buying weapons."
And at least one resident knew for certain that the
money would help purchase arms. Synergy resident Jim
Costain is quoted in the same article: "Some of the money
is known to be used for weapons."
What does an obstruction of the truth in order to collect
donations of the sort I witnessed at Synergy last I riday
night amount to? I'm not a lawyer, but words like "fraud"
and "misrepresentation" come to mind. Nor am I a judge,
but statements like "confiscate deceitfully garnered funds"
and "prohibit further fund-raisers by irresponsible parties"
come to mind also.
