## Theme house debate misses point 
### 
I attended the open forum hosted by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies held May 23. I am writing this let
ter primarily because I did not get the opportunity to voice
my opinion at that forum. I believe the forum provided a
good opportunity for opinions to be heard, but I was dis
satisfied with the lack of focus on one of the arguments
against the exclusion of freshmen from theme houses.

VIEWPOINT

It was brought up that, by trying to give all black fresh
men this wonderful "freshman experience." the exclusion
of these freshmen from theme houses would tend to assim
ilate them into the white majority of Stanford. I would like
to be optimistic and believe that this end was not
purposely aimed at by the committee. But I believe that
this point should be considered by the committee before
it issues its final recommendations.
I also attended the night C-US members visited Ujamaa
to hear student reactions to their preliminary report. On
that occasion, 1 heard the committee's justifications for
wanting freshmen to predominantly live in freshmen
houses. As I understood them, the two major reasons were
that they wanted house-based academic programs for
freshmen and that it would be ideal for shared advising
programs. I answer these justifications in the following
way:
I am personally offended that the committee feels that
such freshman courses as Western Culture (read
"Caucasian history") is more important for me, a black
freshman, than to learn more about my culture by support
ing the theme of Ujamaa. Coming from a predominantly
white neighborhood and school. I was very fortunate to get
in touch with my culture as a result of living in Ujamaa. I
know that if I had been placed in a freshman dorm, the
chances are great that I would have become a miscel
laneous "white" minority Stanford student. I would hate
to think that this is the goal of the University.

As to the importance of freshman advising programs,
I'm sure this idea probably amuses Stanford freshmen of
the past and present. Before any committee uses this justi
fication for such a major change in policy, this university
must make major changes in the freshman advising pro
gram. As it stands, it is a joke. Freshman advisers are not
the source of advice I was led to believe they were when I
first arrived at Stanford. I have found that a much more
useful source of advice is upperciassmen. Besides being
more in touch with issues that concern incoming freshmen,
upperciassmen also seem more knowledgeable about where to

go for various other sources of information.
When I hear the C-US speak of creating a "shared
freshman experience," I cringe. It brings to mind words
like "uniformity" and "assimilation." Since coming to
Stanford, I have heard the staff speak of their wish for di
versity — but action speaks louder than words. If it truly is
the aim of this university to provide diversity, then this
step backward proposed by the C-US should not be
tolerated. As was well-put during the open forum, it is not
the theme houses that should come under such attacks as
the attempt to remove freshmen from them; it is the rest of
the housing s\stem that should be examined for its lack of
diversity and academic value.
