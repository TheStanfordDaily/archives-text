# Scientists march for Sakharov's freedom
## 
### TROY EID Daily staff 
San Francisco â€” Nearly two dozen
scientists, most from Stanford and
UC-Berkeley, staged a quiet
demonstration in front of the Soviet
Consulate here yesterday in support of
Andrei Sakharov, the Nobel Prize
winning physicist who launched a
hunger strike May 2 to demand auth
orities release his wife to the West for
medical care.
The protest, part of International
March of Scientists Day, was mirrored
at Soviet consulates and embassies in
nine countries, where scientists pre
sented a common statement to Soviet
officials saying a negative resolution of
the Sakharov case "would ruin the
prospects for scientific exchanges and
cooperation for years to come."
In a related event at the demonstra
tion. Michael Peskin. associate profes
sor of theoretical physics at the Stan
lord Linear Accelerator Center
(SI.AC), announced that a scientific
paper written by Sakharov one year
ago "has appeared" at Stanford.
Moments before the noontime
protest. Stanford's Paul Flory.
emeritus professor of chemistry and a
Nobel laureate, emerged from the
consulate with Morris Pripstein and
Andrew Sessler. senior physicists at
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
The three men had met privately with
the deputy consule general, who they
said refused to accept the common
statement.
"He told us to put it in the U.S.
Mail." Pripstein said.
Pripstein. the chairman of Scientists
for Sakharov. Orlov and Scharansky
(SOS) reported that a "frank ex

change of views" had taken place be
tween the scientific delegation and the
deputy consule general.
But in a private interview, Flory, a
member of the SOS executive com
mittee, said the Soviet officials
"seemed very agitated" during the
dialogue.
"I would not say it was a rational
exchange," Flory said. "They gave us
the old thread-worn argument that
this is an internal affair."
"It got to the point where (the dep
uty consule general) refused to talk to
me. Essentially, he refused to let me
talk. Then he read us the statement
that (the Soviet news agency) TASS
released this morning."
In a statement titled, "Healers from
the CIA," TASS said. "Sakharov feels
well, takes regular meals and lives an
active way of life. Western mass media
are continuing a hostile anti-Soviet
campaign, with the issue of the plight
of A.D. Sakharov and his wife
(Yelena) Bonner being chosen as a
pretext. As expected, the U.S. presi
dent has joined this unseemly
propaganda farce."
TASS did not disclose the
whereabouts of the dissidents, but
repeated earlier claims that Bonner's
illness is not severe and does not re
quire medical care unavailable in the
Soviet Union. Bonner, who has suf
fered repeated heart attacks and the
loss of an eye, had previously been
allowed to travel to Italy for treat
ment.
"Experience teaches us to be cau
tious in accepting these reports."
Horv said. "We asked the Soviet offi
cials tii allow a party of doctors from
the West to check on Sakharov s con
dition."
Soviet Consulate officials have not
been available for comment. I or the
past three days there has been no an
swer at the consulate's phone number,
and operators report that the plume is
off the hook.
Sidney Drell. deputy director of
SLAC and a close friend of Sakharov
and Bonner, helped write the common
statement. Drell. on sabbatical at Co
lumbia University in New York, said
in a telephone interview yesterday
that "from all reports, the interna
tional march was a success."
Drell also disclosed that the paper
found at Stanford, written in Sak
harov's own handwriting, was
smuggled out of the Soviet Union and
into the hands "of (Sakharov's)
children living in Boston"' before
reaching the University.
The paper marks the fourth time
Stanford has received a scientific man
uscript from Sakharov since he was
exiled to Gorky in 19N0. Drell said.
Peskin said the paper, which deals
with the possibility of extra dimen
sions in space, reflects the difficulties
of life in Gorky.
"It's all full cif second-hand citations
to literature. It was obviously
produced under great hardships." he
said.
By sending his manuscript to SLAC.
Sakharov was acting in a way consis
tent with international scientific
practices, Peskin said.
