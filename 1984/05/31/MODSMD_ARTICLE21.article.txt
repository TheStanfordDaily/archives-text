## Ethnic theme houses are valuable and necessary

Arturo Pacheco is the associ

academic planning, evaluation
and scheduling, Office of Ad

ten about and given presenta
tions on alienation, cultural
pluralism, class perspectives and
equity.
Much has been said recently
about ethnic theme houses, al
ways a controversial topic at
Stanford. The recent Interim
Report by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
has recommended that fresh
men not be allowed to live in
ethnic theme houses. The In
terim Report sparked debate in
the Faculty Senate, a number of
articles in The Daily, and a
Daily editorial in favor of the C
US recommendation that frosh
not be allowed to live in theme
houses.
Many have forgotten why
ethnic theme houses were estab
lished in the first place. In 1969,

when the first significant num
bers of minority undergraduates
were recruited to come to Stan
ford, there was a clear recogni
tion that neither these students
nor Stanford were completely
ready for each other. Stanford
had little experience with
minority students, had only a
handful of minority faculty
members, few minority support
staff and few courses in its cur
riculum that would help its stu
dents understand minority
peoples in the United States.
Many of these minority stu
dents came from black, Chicano

and native Americans commu
nities that were low-income and
working class, and that were of
ten racially isolated. In addition,
like other major universities
across the country in the late
19605, Stanford came to the
reluctant recognition that rac
ism, both in its personal and in
stitutional forms, was pervasive
in American society. Ethnic
theme houses, then called
"minority concentration
houses," it was argued, would
help bridge some of these im
portant social problems, and
more importantly, ease the
transition of a number of
minority students from their
communities to Stanford.
The transition from high
school to Stanford is difficult for
all students, including middle

class white students, but for
many young people from poor
and minority backgrounds, it is
one of the most severe and
traumatic events of their lives.
The creation of residences
where black, Chicano, Asian
and native American students
could exist in sufficient numbers
— enough to constitute a
"critical mass," but never more
than 50 percent of the students
at any one house — and provid
ing those houses with
knowledgeable and supportive
resident fellows and resident as
sistants was seen as a major step
ensuring the academic success
of these students at Stanford.
Despite their location in the
worst of facilities (Stern and
Wilbur) theme houses have per
formed this critical function well
over the years. Few minority
freshmen who have lived in
theme houses have dropped out
during their first year at Stan
ford.
The context and history in
which ethnic theme houses were
created make them quite differ
ent from other "theme houses,"
and makes their comparison to
other theme houses difficult, if
not impossible, /apata, U jamaa
and Okada have far different
histories and justifications than
the French house or the Italian
house, and these ought to be
recognized. Nor is being black,
Chicano or Asian in this country
a "lifestyle," as some of the
other theme houses have been
designated.
Over the years, the ethnic
theme houses have become
much more of a "transition"
place for minority students en
tering Stanford. Participation by
ethnic theme house students in

the life of the university is often
far greater than by students in
other houses. Academic pro
gramming (both formal courses
and informal programs) in eth
nic theme houses is better than
most of the Stanford residences,
including '•academic" theme
houses, and the opportunities
for all students to learn about
black, Chicano and Asian his
tory and culture is unparalleled
anywhere else on campus.
Despite the efforts of the last
15 years, conditions for
minority people have not
changed that much — either in
society or at Stanford. Racism is
still pervasive in our society.

Chicanos are far more racially
isolated now than they were 20
years ago. The high school drop
out rate for Chicanos and
Puerto Ricans is nearly 50 per
cent. A black male college
graduate earns only $110 more
annually than a white male high
school graduate, and the major
cause of death among black
males is homicide. Rates of
suicide and alcoholism among
native Americans far exceed the
national average. Yet, myths
and stereotypes about the
causes of these conditions per
sist, even among the college ed
ucated.
Minimal progress has been

made at Stanford. When I
joined the faculty in 1972. there
were nine Chicano faculty mem
bers. As I leave the faculty 12
years later, there will be nine
Chicanos on a faculty of 1200.
There are no native American
faculty members. Yet is is com
mon to hear congratulatory
pronouncements about how
well Stanford is doing on Af
firmative Action, compared to
other similar institutions.
We have had little impact on
the curriculum. In fact, move
ment has been in the direction
of a required Eurocentric cur
riculum with the distribution re
quirements. Ethnic studies
courses often receive little real
encouragement or support and
are reluctantly tolerated. How
often do freshman advisers sug
gest that their students take a
course on the black experience,
on Chicano history, or a
SWOPSI course on native
American traditions with the
same zeal that they prescribe
Psychology 1 or Chem 33? As a
result, these courses often go
undersubscribed, unless they
are taught in theme houses.
If anything, the problems that
minority students face at Stan
ford are more severe now than
they were in 1970. Then, there
was at least a social and political
context outside the university
walls that forced a discussion of
these problems into our lives.
Now, it is possible to spend four
years as a student at Stanford
and never have a serious intel
lectual or cultural interchange
with a black, Asian, Chicano or
native American student. It is
possible to get through the cur
riculum without taking a course
that treats these issues centrally
and seriously. It is possible to

never encounter a minority ad
ministrator or professor. All of
this is quite possible in the isola
tion of Stanford, despite the fact
that Stanford is in California,
where 51 percent of the children
entering public schools today
come from minority back
grounds.
Such protected isolation is not
possible in ethnic theme houses,
where 35 to 50 percent of the
students come from minority
backgrounds, where one will
meet minority faculty and admin
istrators, and where students
can learn about the history, cul
ture and current conditions of
minority groups at the same
time that they form culturally
mixed study groups in Western
culture and chemistry. The C
US recommendation would
deny freshmen this knowledge
anjjl this experience in favor of a
more purified frosh experience.
It would isolate the minority
freshmen throughout the sys
tem, where in groups of twos
and threes they would have
little chance to openly celebrate
and further understand their
lives and cultures, let alone live
them in relative comfort.
At present, the ethnic theme
houses are the residences that
best help prepare students to
face society as it exists in reality,
not as imagined on the Stanford
Farm. It is unfortunate that the
C-US report has focused its at
tention on the three ethnic
theme houses that have been
doing well by almost any meas
ure. Instead, it should be
recommending more such
houses and experiences for in
coming freshmen, and it should
be critical of the majority of
those houses that don't offer
these opportunities.
