### 
Kugene, Ore. (AP) — Arkansas' Mike Con
ley began his bid for a long jump-triple jump
double in the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
Championships yesterday, and the Razorbacks
won a protest to reach the final of the men's
400-meter relay.
Arkansas' relay team, consisting of Fred
Clean, Mike Davis, Conley and Wallace
Spearmon, finished second in its heat in 39.71
seconds, behind Baylor (39.52), and would
have qualified for Friday's final.
But Cleburne Price, head track coach at the
University of Texas, protested to meet referee
Eldon Fix that the Razorbacks should have
been disqualified because Davis' uniform did
not conform with those of his teammates.
Davis was wearing tights — as had other run
ners in different heats — to keep warm and
protect his hamstrings, while his teammates
wore shorts.
Fix agreed with Price, citing rule 4, section 2.
article I in the track and field rule book that
says: "All members of a relay team must wear
identical uniforms."
And he disqualified Arkansas.
Razorback Coach John McDonnell
protested to the jury of appeals, and that group
overturned Fix's decision.
"The last couple of years, we have
dominated the Southwest Conference, and I
guess mighty Texas doesn't like it," said
McDonnell, whose Razorbacks won the
NCAA indoor title in March and recently won
their third straight league championship.
"If they can't beat us on the track, they'll try
to beat us off the track." added McDonnell.
"He (Price) thinks it's a rivalry, 1 don't."

Meanwhile. Fresno State's Matt Mileham
broke the meet record in the hammer throw
with a heave of 238-1 1 in leading 14 qualifiers
into Friday's final. The previous NCAA record
was 238-7. set by Scott Neilson of Washington
in 1978.
Mileham dismissed the importance of the
record.
"It's not significant for the final results be
cause the (qualifying) marks don't carry over,"
he said. ""1 would say (it will take) at least 244-
10 to win."
Oregon's Joaquin Cruz, a favorite to capture
the men's 800 and 1500. opened his quest for
that double by advancing into Friday's final.
Cruz, the defending champion in the 800
and Brazil's big hope in the Olympics, won his
qualifying heat in 1:46.34, the fastest time in
the three sections.
Florida State, the favorite for the women's
title because of its great sprint depth, showed
why it deserved that role, in the qualifying of
the 100-meter dash.
Not only did the Seminoles get all three of
their entrants into Friday's final, but all three
Randy Givens. Michelle Finn and Brenda
Cliette — won their heats. Givens had the fast
est clocking, a wind-adided I 1.20.
Washington State, the favorite for the men's
title, suffered a big loss when Brent Harken
failed to reach the high jump final. Harken,
who had cleared 7-6 this season, did not get
over 7-2 in the qualifying.
"I was disappointed," said Harken. "1 just
didn t have it today, but I'm looking forward to
the Olympic Trials."
