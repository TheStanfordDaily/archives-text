### 
Eugene, Ore. (AP) —
Stanford University was consid
ered one of the top contenders
for the women's title in the
NCAA Outdoor Track and
112 ield Championships, which
began in earnest yesterday.
Cardinal Coach Brooks
Johnson says whether his team
wins or not is out of his hands.
"The only thing a coach can
do is get his team to a meet like
the nationals," said Johnson,
also the Women's Coach for the
U.S. Olympic team.
"If you get there often
enough, your number will come
up. We have the potential to
win. but so do five or six other
teams (among them favored
Florida State and Tennessee).
Stanford is led by distance
runners PattiSue Plumer. Alison
Wiley and Regina Jacobs, discus
thrower and shot putter Carol
Cady and javelin thrower Mary
Osborne.
Johnson prefers to talk more
about the injustices for women
in the Olympics, the entire
Olympic movement and the
world in general.
He is upset that a runner of
Plumer's caliber will not have an
opportunity to compete in the
Games in the 5000-meter race,
her best event, because it is not
in the Olympic program for wo
men — only for men. Instead,
she'll have to compete for a
berth on the U.S. team in the

\OOO meters. the.longest event
tor women other than the
marathon.
"It's criminal, because she's a
natural 5000 runner." said
Johnson. "That would he like
taking Sydney Maree or Steve
Scott (who specialize in the
1500) and asking them to run
SOO meters. Nobody's asking
Carl Lewis (who runs the 100
and 200 meters, and long
jumps) to run in the 400, or Ed
win Moses (who competes in the
400-meter intermediate hur
dles) to run in the high hurdles.
"PattiSue's education cost
Stanford nearly $60,000. That
$60,000 underwriting is for
nothing.
"That's what concerns me
about the Olympics," added
Johnson. "The Olympic move
ment is sexist, racist and
anti-Semitic."
While Stanford, Florida State
and Tennessee are expected to
battle for the women's title, won
each of the past two years by
Ut LA, the men's team champi
onship figures to be a scrap
among Washington State,
Oregon and defending cham
pion Southern Methodist.
Yesterday's program was
devoted mainly to qualifying
and preliminaries, with only one
final scheduled, in the women's
10.000 meters.
