## Why good liberals go to the movies – a defense of 'Moscow' 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
[ I lie extreme negative response of

Mazursky actually made and conjur

chauvinistic, stereotypical, and (most
bizarrely) anti-Soviet — adjectives

rabid right-wing fantasy, a sort of
Uncommon Valor with Russian vil
lains instead of Laotian ones. Could
these modifiers really apply to the
Moscow on the Hudson I saw (twice)
the gentle, expansive tragicomedy
on the theme of home and displace
ment. in which New York is portrayed
as a funny, jazzy city in which the cur
rency of American daily life
(consumer items, pop, street and busi
ness jargon) is swapped entirely by the
uprooted representatives of other
cultures?
The charge of "anti-Sovictism" —
hurled so vehemently in these days of
failed diplomacy — strikes me as very
odd. In the first part of the film, we see
the hero, Vladimir Ivanoff (Robin
Williams), a musician in a circus about
to embark on a New York tour, suffer
ing the inconveniences of living in
Moscow (the shortage of goods, the
crowded apartment buildings, the in
terminable lines) and the greater in
dignities of living in a non-democratic
country (the omnipresence of the
K(iß, the fear of police informers, the
constraints on freedom of speech); in
the second part, bewitched by his first
glimpses of America, he chooses to

defect. Are Moscow's critics truly
claiming that no such conditions exist
in the U.S.S.R., that men and women
live there in perfect freedom and com
fort? Mazursky and his co
screenwriter, Leon Capetanos, may
exaggerate — their vision is, after all,
a comic one — but nothing I have read
on the subject of Soviet life greatly
contradicts what Vladimir endures
(and grows to hate). Wouldn't it be
the height of political naivete to depict
a Moscow in which citizens can move
about as freely as they can in America,
and where consumers arc as spoiled as

we are? Besides, Moscow on the Hud
son is the tale of a defector, and all of
it is seen from his point of view. If
Vladimir were happy in Russia, why
the hell would he defect?
Had' Mazursky and Capetanos
drawn a collection of red villains, the
way Hollywood did in the bad old
Cold War days, there might be some
thing to grouse about in this area. But
even the KGB men in the movie are
written in human terms — one as
rather stolid and sluggish, the other as
a sweet, slightly paranoid individual as
terrified of the system as any civilian
could be. (Note: The filmmakers in
dict the system, not its practitioners; as
far as I know, that still qualifies them
as humanist-satirists in good stand
ing.) In dozens of American-set
movies of the past 10 years, the FBI
and the CIA come across as sinister,
all-powerful organizations that breed
heartless assassins, and I've rarely en
countered a word of objection in a
liberal paper to this obvious wholesale
stereotyping. Yet friends have com
plained to me in all seriousness that
the willingness of the Muscovites in
Mazursky's movie to stand in line
without knowing whether they're

waiting for chicken or toilet paper
makes Russians appear stupid, and
that the movie would he less offensive
if Vladimir worked for a ballet com
pany instead of a circus troupe. (If an
allusion to popular taste really taints a
culture and sinks a serious subject,
then Diner should be consigned to the
lower half of drive-in double bills.)
Frankly, I couldn't locate a single
stereotype in all of Moscow on the
Hudson. Mazursky deliberately plays
against types, introducing a sleazy
looking Cuban lawyer who turns out
to be both ethical and generous, and a
vacuous-seeming Italian shopgirl who,
as we get to know her better, displays
a complex of ambitions and tensions
and emotions. But that's not the real
sore spot for most critics of
Mazursky's film, I suspect; it's just a
kneejerk liberal reaction when there
are so many non-WASPS on screen in
an American movie. (Some people
have said that Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom — a film I have no
pressing wish to defend — is racist be
cause the Indians in it are either
wicked or helpless. Well, yes. the vil
lagers are certainly helpless —
strapped by poverty — and so are the
enslaved children in the Temple of
Doom. Does that arrangement really
add up to a racist statement? Aren't
there more serious indictments one
can make against Indiana Jones?)
Moscow on the Hudson rankles
many liberals, I think, because in it an
immigrant embraces America fully
and, despite a few unfortunate experi
ences (with muggers and insensitive
neighbors), he never experiences a
rude awakening. If Mazursky had cho
sen to make a modern-day Cundide,
with Vladimir as an innocent abroad
who discovers that life in all quarters is
equally rotten, then presumably the
picture would come in for fewer in
credulous sneers. But Mazursky's hero
insists on fainting in a supermarket
when confronted with the sheer over
whelming variety of coffee on the
shelves and in hanging American flag
shower curtains in his apartment (both
details reportedly derived from true
life incidents), and that apparently im
presses many people as a sentimental,
dishonest version of immigrant life in
America.
Isn't it remotely possible that
Vladimir might prefer New York to
Moscow, that he might love America
with the open-hearted love im
migrants in fact often feel, immune to

the easy cynicism of many American
liberals? If Mazursky had given us a
film about a man who escapes to
America and ends up feeling just as
defeated by his new country, it might
please the people who made the inar
ticulate. dead-ended Silkwood, but it
certainly wouldn't communicate the
point of view of the Vladimir Ivanoffs
of America.

last year's most shameless weepers.
Nothing could be more moralistic tlutn
the '"respectable" finish of Terms of
Endearment, in which the irrespon
sible little-boy astronaut (Jack Nichol
son) grows up and begins to take care
of his lover's grandchildren — unless it
is the ending of The Natural — not the
ending Malamud gave his novel —
with the over-the-hill baseball star
(Robert Redford) hitting a homer for
the son he never knew he had and
then settling down to teach his boy
how to play the game.
Is Moscow on the Hudson really
more fraudulent than these movies?
It's certainly a lot less deadening. I
avoided reviewing Testament when it
came out because the thought of all
the angry reaction I was sure to
provoke exhausted me. and anyway,
how do you begin to explain why a
movie about nuclear holocaust featur
ing a little retarded Japanese boy
named Hiroshi couldn't possibly be
any good? People don't object to the
kind of high-minded manipulation
that goes on in Testament because it's
widely assumed that any film dealing
with a theme as serious as nuclear war
must be worthwhile. (That's a central
misconception — like the other wrong
headed belief that any performance
as relentlessly somber as Jane Alexan
der's must be great acting.)
It's not, finally, a matter of how
good a movie is, or how authentic a
representation of human experience,
but of how politically "correct" it is,
how safe, how trendy. The sentiments
expressed in Moscow on the Hudson
don't happen to be fashionable right
now; those at the end of Terms of En
dearment and The Natural — the reaf
firmation of fatherhood, the sensitiza
tion of the male role model — are, at
least among liberal audiences. And
only certain movies receive censure —

the ones that depend on art house
audiences to survive. No one got up in
arms over Uncommon Valor or

they were morally appalling spec
tacles; the audience for Silkwood

Fire, about journalists in Nicaragua
during the final days of Somoza's
regime. Perhaps because it dealt with
emotionally and intellectually chal
lenging questions of political commit
ment and journalistic ethics, local
audiences bypassed it (as audiences all
around the nation did) in favor of the
terribly self-righteous, enervated El

Norte, a movie that tells you exactly
what to think about all its characters
— a pre-digested vitamin pill of a
movie. The Saturday night audience 1
saw El Norte with at the Aquarius fol

the sickeningly noble Guatemalan
protagonists with grave concern (1 feft

and dangerous, I thought 1 detected
smiles of smug satisfaction in the dark

Do liberal audiences still want the
message American movies fed us
during the Vietnam War — that we're

irredeemably lousy people living in a
doomed, racist society — only now in
the form of a civics lesson? Is a Chek
hovian filmmaker like Paul Mazursky,
who tells us that people are often
mfred and often miserable but none
theless wonderful creatures with an
endless capacity for surprising each
other — still out of step in 1984?
