# The 						Moody Blues: victorious warriors of a long forgotten era
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Of all the British bands to
emerge out of the psychedelic
haze of the 19605, the most
popular and the most persistent
has been the Moody Blues. Start
ing out with their landmark or
chestrated album. Days of
Future Passed, in 1967. the
Moody Blues gradually built up
a! following which has never
diminished in size, lor some
reason, the public has continu
ally shown great affection for
the grandiose, majestic and
"heady" pomposity of the
.Moodies' style of rock music.
I However, whether it was the
Moodies taking their listeners on a
quest for Eastern spiritualism
[In Search of the Lost Chord,
196K) or on a trip back to the
dawn of man (To Our
VChtidren '.v C liidren' s ( hildren,
1969), the Moodies always
could be counted on to add that
extra punch of Chuck Berry
rock 'n' roll to even their most
bombastic and pretentious
opuses. For no matter what they
did, the Moodies did originally
start off as an R & B cover hand
and they still have a charming
lead guitarist, Justin Hayward,
who supplies some of the most
concise, yet so full of rock 'n'
roll energy, guitar solos this side
of George Harrison and Robbie
Robertson. F.veri the band knew
where they were coming from,
especially when they expressed it
in their 1973 hit, "I'm Just a
Singer In a Rock and Roll
Band."
After a hiatus in the '70s,
though, the Moodies struck
hack with lull force in 1981 by
releasing a No. 1 charting al
bum. Long Distance Voyager,
and hy beginning to tour again.
Last year's album. The Present,
was a great letdown after their
previous album, but when the
Moodies announced their first
Bay Area appearance in many a
year. I was anxious to catch

these "veteran cosmic rockers"
(as they've alluded to them
selves in one of their more
recent compositions).
They chose to open up their
summer 'K4 tour hy performing
at the wonderful Concord
Pavilion amphitheater. The set
ting was perfect, as the
Moodies, just like the Grateful
Dead, are one of the best hands
to sec put of doors. Under the
starlit night sky. the Moodies
promised to take their mostly
suburban adult hippie crowd on
a fantastic voyage through space
and time (with or without the
help of any organic substances).
Opening with their recent hit,
"Sitting at the Wheel," the
Moodies proved themselves to
be able performers for two
hours. The material of the con
cert encompassed the full
breadth of the Moody Blues'
history and although they did
push too many songs from The
Present LP, they were
thoroughly enjoyable. As I
mentioned previously, the
Moodies* fans are some of the
most loyal around and they
rewarded their favorite band
with numerous standing ova
tions and rounds of applause. It
was as if they were applauding
the victorious warriors of a long
forgotten era.
Musically, as this was the
opening night of the tour, the
Moodies were occasionally out
of synch. However, since they
have been playing for closc to
20 years, when they did begin
grooving together, they hit
many musical highpoints. The
third song of the evening,
"Tuesday Afternoon" (off Days
of 112 uture Passed), was the first
instance of their magic. This
song, which is almost as ethereal
and moving as the Kinks'
"Waterloo Sunset," was sung
with a touching passion by Jus
tin Hayward, and the two-part
backup harmonies of bassist

and flutist Ray
Thomas were heavenly in their
choirboy proficiency. In this
song's English music hall
middle-eight, the band ex
ploded forth with a loose, up
beat, happy-go-lucky spirit of
rock 'n' roll that resulted in a
great effusion of warmth from
the crowd.
For the remainder of the con
cert, the Moodies successfully
intermingled older material with
the new. The hard driving "The
Story In Your Eyes" was a spurt
of fresh energy in the middle of

a languid set of some of the
weak songs off The Present,
whil; the gorgeous "Driftwood"
(off Octave) was equally
emotive. Their suite of tunes off
the Long Distance Voyager al
bum included the aforemen
tioned "Veteran Cosmic Rock
ers," which enabled the band to
showcase its musical chops.
While drummer Graeme Edge
powered out a tough "Bo Did
dley" R & B stomp, Ray
Thomas worked out with a
blues-driven harmonica solo
along with a Middle East
flavored flute solo. While all this

was going on, Patrick Mora/,
supplied some soulful keyboard
work (he also successfully
reproduced many of the intri
cate orchestrations and sound
effects found on the studio ver
sions of the songs) and Justin
Hayward would sprinkle brief,
yet spine-tingling guitar solos
throughout the length of the
song. It was a true display of
musicianship by these "veteran
cosmic rockers."
However, it was the last third
of the concert when the
Moodies really achieved their

musical heights. Starting from
the manic "Gypsy (Of a Strange
and Distant Time)" (from
1969) on which the band
sounded amazingly like Jethro
Tull, the band didn't let up in its
final 40 minutes on stage. Wheth
er it was all-out rockers ("The
Ouestion"; "Ride My See-
Saw"), classically inspired bal
lads ("Isn't Life Strange"), or
psychedelic anthems like
"Legend of a Mind." the band
really gave its audience what it
had come for. Of course, during
this final set, the band per
formed its all-time classic,

"Nights in White Satin" (again
off Days of Future Passed).
After cries of recognition from
the crowd upon hearing the first
notes of this composition, the
crowd fell into a silent hush as if
it was listening to the Sermon on
the Mount. With the calm night
above and the smooth, rolling
mountains outlined along the
horizon, the Moodies cast their
musical spell to the fullest. The
crowd exploded graciously as
the song drew to a close. It was
the highpoint of the night â€” one
that will be remembered come
days of future passed.

lads ("Isn't Life Strange"), or
psychedelic anthems like
"Legend of a Mind." the band
really gave its audience what it
had come for. Of course, during
this final set, the band per
formed its all-time classic,

"Nights in White Satin" (again
off Days of Future Passed).
After cries of recognition from
the crowd upon hearing the first
notes of this composition, the
crowd fell into a silent hush as if
it was listening to the Sermon on
the Mount. With the calm night
above and the smooth, rolling
mountains outlined along the
horizon, the Moodies cast their
musical spell to the fullest. The
crowd exploded graciously as
the song drew to a close. It was
the highpoint of the night â€” one
that will be remembered come
days of future passed.

Of all the British bands to
emerge out of the psychedelic
haze of the 19605, the most
popular and the most persistent
has been the Moody Blues. Start
ing out with their landmark or
chestrated album. Days of
Future Passed, in 1967. the
Moody Blues gradually built up
a! following which has never
diminished in size, lor some
reason, the public has continu
ally shown great affection for
the grandiose, majestic and
"heady" pomposity of the
.Moodies' style of rock music.
I However, whether it was the
Moodies taking their listeners on a
quest for Eastern spiritualism
[In Search of the Lost Chord,
196K) or on a trip back to the
dawn of man (To Our
VChtidren '.v C liidren' s ( hildren,
1969), the Moodies always
could be counted on to add that
extra punch of Chuck Berry
rock 'n' roll to even their most
bombastic and pretentious
opuses. For no matter what they
did, the Moodies did originally
start off as an R & B cover hand
and they still have a charming
lead guitarist, Justin Hayward,
who supplies some of the most
concise, yet so full of rock 'n'
roll energy, guitar solos this side
of George Harrison and Robbie
Robertson. F.veri the band knew
where they were coming from,
especially when they expressed it
in their 1973 hit, "I'm Just a
Singer In a Rock and Roll
Band."
After a hiatus in the '70s,
though, the Moodies struck
hack with lull force in 1981 by
releasing a No. 1 charting al
bum. Long Distance Voyager,
and hy beginning to tour again.
Last year's album. The Present,
was a great letdown after their
previous album, but when the
Moodies announced their first
Bay Area appearance in many a
year. I was anxious to catch

these "veteran cosmic rockers"
(as they've alluded to them
selves in one of their more
recent compositions).
They chose to open up their
summer 'K4 tour hy performing
at the wonderful Concord
Pavilion amphitheater. The set
ting was perfect, as the
Moodies, just like the Grateful
Dead, are one of the best hands
to sec put of doors. Under the
starlit night sky. the Moodies
promised to take their mostly
suburban adult hippie crowd on
a fantastic voyage through space
and time (with or without the
help of any organic substances).
Opening with their recent hit,
"Sitting at the Wheel," the
Moodies proved themselves to
be able performers for two
hours. The material of the con
cert encompassed the full
breadth of the Moody Blues'
history and although they did
push too many songs from The
Present LP, they were
thoroughly enjoyable. As I
mentioned previously, the
Moodies* fans are some of the
most loyal around and they
rewarded their favorite band
with numerous standing ova
tions and rounds of applause. It
was as if they were applauding
the victorious warriors of a long
forgotten era.
Musically, as this was the
opening night of the tour, the
Moodies were occasionally out
of synch. However, since they
have been playing for closc to
20 years, when they did begin
grooving together, they hit
many musical highpoints. The
third song of the evening,
"Tuesday Afternoon" (off Days
of 112 uture Passed), was the first
instance of their magic. This
song, which is almost as ethereal
and moving as the Kinks'
"Waterloo Sunset," was sung
with a touching passion by Jus
tin Hayward, and the two-part
backup harmonies of bassist

and flutist Ray
Thomas were heavenly in their
choirboy proficiency. In this
song's English music hall
middle-eight, the band ex
ploded forth with a loose, up
beat, happy-go-lucky spirit of
rock 'n' roll that resulted in a
great effusion of warmth from
the crowd.
For the remainder of the con
cert, the Moodies successfully
intermingled older material with
the new. The hard driving "The
Story In Your Eyes" was a spurt
of fresh energy in the middle of

a languid set of some of the
weak songs off The Present,
whil; the gorgeous "Driftwood"
(off Octave) was equally
emotive. Their suite of tunes off
the Long Distance Voyager al
bum included the aforemen
tioned "Veteran Cosmic Rock
ers," which enabled the band to
showcase its musical chops.
While drummer Graeme Edge
powered out a tough "Bo Did
dley" R & B stomp, Ray
Thomas worked out with a
blues-driven harmonica solo
along with a Middle East
flavored flute solo. While all this

was going on, Patrick Mora/,
supplied some soulful keyboard
work (he also successfully
reproduced many of the intri
cate orchestrations and sound
effects found on the studio ver
sions of the songs) and Justin
Hayward would sprinkle brief,
yet spine-tingling guitar solos
throughout the length of the
song. It was a true display of
musicianship by these "veteran
cosmic rockers."
However, it was the last third
of the concert when the
Moodies really achieved their

musical heights. Starting from
the manic "Gypsy (Of a Strange
and Distant Time)" (from
1969) on which the band
sounded amazingly like Jethro
Tull, the band didn't let up in its
final 40 minutes on stage. Wheth
er it was all-out rockers ("The
Ouestion"; "Ride My See-
Saw"), classically inspired bal
lads ("Isn't Life Strange"), or
psychedelic anthems like
"Legend of a Mind." the band
really gave its audience what it
had come for. Of course, during
