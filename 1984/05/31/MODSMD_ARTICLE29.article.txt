# Stanford scientists to search stars for life
## 
### 
In a search for extraterrestrial life,
Stanford scientists will begin
eavesdropping on billions of stars and
planets in four years.
Scientists at the University's Center
lor Space Science and Astrophysics
are working on the research and de
\elopment necessary to design parts of
an antenna which will be used for
"sound scans" of the heavens.
I he project is funded by the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration. which has already allocated
$20 million for this decade.
Through the antenna, signals de
tected from outer space will be re
corded. Stanford scientists are
working to build a sophisticated signal
analyzer which would look for charac
teristics to indicate an artificial rather

than a natural origin for signals the an
tenna picks up.
Hewlett-Packard's Bernard Oliver,
who works with NASA's Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence project,
discussed the project last week in a
speech here.
"There may e\en be an intercom
municating network in the galaxy
which we can't afford not to be mem
bers of," Oliver said.
It there are creatures on other
planets. the\ may return messages
sent from earth, and scientists here
hope that the antenna will capture
those signals.
Because of the great distance to
even the nearest stars, space travel to
investigate for extraterrestrial life is
impossible, Oliver said.
