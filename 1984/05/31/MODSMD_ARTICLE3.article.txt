## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate demonstrated
strong support for the United Stanford
Workers (USW) last night by approv
ing a resolution urging University
President Donald Kennedy to recog
nize USW Local 680 as the bargaining
agent for Stanford's 1300 technical,
maintenance and service workers.
The vote was 13 to 3 with two
senators abstaining.
USW President Linda Crouse said
the vote constituted "a historic mo
ment," adding, "It's the first time to
our knowledge that the ASSU Senate
has ever directly supported workers."
Senator Mark Landesmann. who
co-authored the resolution with
senator Jon Adelstein, agreed that the
decision was "landmark in the sense
that students showed that they are in
terested in having input on University
policy."

The senators considered the resolu
tion after an hour-long debate in
which union and University represen
tatives presented their cases regarding
the dispute and responded to ques
tions from the senators.
David Stevens, union steward at the
Medical Center, and Jim Eggleston,
USWs attorney, argued the union's
view while the University was
represented by Robert Freelen. vice
president of Public Affairs, and Felix
Barthelemy, director of employee re
lations. Crouse and University Legal
Counsel Priscilla Wheeler also entered
the debate.
Stevens said the University is trying
to bust the union because "what 680 is
and what the USW and the workers
here are are a strong militant union
and Stanford doesn't like that."
He said that the administration

Priscilla Wheeler, University legal counsel, and Jim Eggleston, attorney for United Stanford Workers, are
two of the major figures in Local 680's battle for recognition by the University. Last night, the ASSU urged
the University to accept the USW's new union affiliation.
