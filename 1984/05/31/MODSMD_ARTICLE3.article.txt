## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate demonstrated
strong support for the United Stanford
Workers (USW) last night by approv
ing a resolution urging University
President Donald Kennedy to recog
nize USW Local 680 as the bargaining
agent for Stanford's 1300 technical,
maintenance and service workers.
The vote was 13 to 3 with two
senators abstaining.
USW President Linda Crouse said
the vote constituted "a historic mo
ment," adding, "It's the first time to
our knowledge that the ASSU Senate
has ever directly supported workers."
Senator Mark Landesmann. who
co-authored the resolution with
senator Jon Adelstein, agreed that the
decision was "landmark in the sense
that students showed that they are in
terested in having input on University
policy."

The senators considered the resolu
tion after an hour-long debate in
which union and University represen
tatives presented their cases regarding
the dispute and responded to ques
tions from the senators.
David Stevens, union steward at the
Medical Center, and Jim Eggleston,
USWs attorney, argued the union's
view while the University was
represented by Robert Freelen. vice
president of Public Affairs, and Felix
Barthelemy, director of employee re
lations. Crouse and University Legal
Counsel Priscilla Wheeler also entered
the debate.
Stevens said the University is trying
to bust the union because "what 680 is
and what the USW and the workers
here are are a strong militant union
and Stanford doesn't like that."
He said that the administration

the University to accept the USW's new union affiliation.
tears I ocal f>SO because it is a "rank
and-tile. democratically run union
that tights for its workers. "What thc\
(University officials) would prefer,
he said, "is a company union. Thcv
want to see a union that's run from thi
top down and where the management
of the union and the management ol
the university decide what the condi
tions of employment are."
Barthelemy explained the Univei
sitv's position that Local 680's disal
filiation with the larger union. Local
715. was invalid because USW ofti
cials failed to comply with the require
ments of the National Labor
Board (NLRB) and thus left the bar
gaining unit without union representa
tion.
Wheeler contended that the Univer
sity was being unjustly portrayed as "a
monster and a monolith."
"We didn't ask them (Local 715) to
abandon this unit," she said. Wheelei
added that the University believes the
workers' April IN vote to disaffiliate
was invalid because, although the vote
was 632 to 125. the largest vote anil
voting margin in the union's 1 1 -year
history, disaffiliation was approved b\
a majority of the voters and not a
majority of the bargaining unit. Ap
proval by a majority of the bargaining
unit would be required for a valid dis
affiliation if. as the University con
tends. the workers had no union rep
resentation at the time of the vote, she
said.
Wheeler also said the ballot was im
proper because it only gave workers
the choice of whether they wanted to

be represented by Local 6S()and listed
no other options.
Part ol the debate that followed the
torum centered on the proper role of
the senate in the controversy
Senator Mark Soble introduced a
resolution to postpone the
Adelstein Landesmann resolution in
definitely. explaining that he felt that
"students would not want us to ad
dress this resolution."
Soble said he doesn't think most
students have an opinion on the issue.
"I do not think the senate should
create an opinion for them." he said.
But other senators argued that most
students support the USW.
" I he people I speak to do have an
opinion and do want us to take a
stance." said senator Su Uhland. "I
think it's our university as much as
anyone's university, and it's our
privilege to make a statement on it
and it's our right." she said.
Adelstein added that since the
workers are "people who take care of
us. the senate had an "obligation to
call on the University to recognize the
rights" of the workers.
He also said students should try to
see that the University "behaves in a
way befitting an institution of higher
learning."
The resolution includes a clause
saying that "we as students expect the
administration to uphold Stanford
I University s high ethical standards and
commitment to democratic prin
ciples. . .."
In other matters, the senate urged
campus radio station K/.SU to broad
cast senate meetings and approved the
budget for Guest Prof. A.H. Raskin,
the labor journalist who will teach
here fall quarter.
