# Engineering School to offer new degree programs
## 
### SAM DELSON Staff writer 
Associate Dean Gilbert Masters announced a
new structure for the Engineering School's un
dergraduate curriculum yesterday, calling it "a
new and innovative program that is a drastic
departure from the past."
Under the new system, the school will offer
two alternative paths toward a Bachelor of Sci
ence degree.
The first path will require 107 units (10 less
than is currently required) and lead to an ac
credited degree in one of the five traditional
fields ot engineering: electrical, mechanical,
civil, industrial and chemical. The 107 units will
be divided into five different categories: depth,
mathematics, science, fundamentals, electives
and experimentation.
"We're trying to increase the likelihood that
engineering students will be able to take advan
tage of the other things the University has to of
fer," Masters said.

The second path will require 90 units and lead
to an unaccredited degree in "engineering sci
ence."
Two different types of engineering science
programs will be offered.
The first will consist of individually designed
majors which would be proposed by students
and approved by the Undergraduate Council.
The second program will include curricula
proposed by departments or other groups of fac
ulty within the school. These curricula will be
advertised to students and will lead to degrees
with designations such as "engineering science:
operations research," or "engineering science:
systems engineering."
Both Masters and Dean of Engineering
William Kays are excited about the second type
of engineering science degree.
"We are taking a step toward what is likely to
be the future of engineering," Masters said.
In a recent memo to the Undergraduate
Council advocating adoptioji of the new

structure, Kays said, "I would like to very
strongly endorse the concept of an alternative
route to a B.S. degree in engineering which is far
more liberal than our present accredited pro
grams can ever be."
He added, "I think we have a real opportunity
here to provide some leadership in engineering
education."
The new structure is the first significant
change in the Engineering School's undergradu
ate curriculum in more than 15 years.
While the engineering science program is in
tended as a radical departure from the school's
current structure, the 107-unit program is meant
to reduce the number of courses required for an
accredited engineering degree.
Under the present system, 1 17 units are re
quired for a B.S. in engineering.
Masters said the University's adoption of
more extensive distribution and foreign lan
guage requirements during the last four years

created a situation in which engineering students
have "almost no flexibility in course selection."
In addition to the elimination of 10 units of
requirements, the new structure will increase the
number of units some classes are worth without
increasing the workload in those courses.
"In the long run, we hope to give students a
full quarter's worth of extra flexibility," Masters
said.
"We've done everything we can to streamline
and smooth out the traditional program," he
added. "If we cut any more we would risk losing
our accreditation."
The restructuring is the product of more than
30 committee meetings during the past IS
months, and will take effect during the 1985-86
academic year. Masters said.
It was adopted by the school's Undergraduate
Council Friday with only one dissenting vote
The council is composed of 24 faculty and 1!
students, but voting rights are limited to 18 fac
ultv.
