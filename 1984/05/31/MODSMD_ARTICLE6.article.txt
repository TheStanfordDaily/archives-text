# Assembly votes down Roberti bill
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Daily staff 
A bill that would have prohibited
the use of pound animals in research
was defeated yesterday by the state
Assembly's Governmental Organiza
tion Committee, a move that pleases
the University and angers animal
rights lobbyists.
SB-883, the work of Senate Presi
dent Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los
Angeles) which would have required
scientists to use only animals specifi
cally bred for laboratory research, was
killed in a 9-4 vote by the committee.
Mike Goodkind. a Medical Center
spokesman, said he was "certainly
grateful that the legislature acted in
the way that they did to vote against
legislation which would have been ex
tremely detrimental to medical re
search and which essentially does
nothing to protect or help people's
pets."
Goodkind added that there "has
been a pressing need to use animals in
research - ' and that the need will
"certainly exist for the foreseeable
future." Had the bill passed, the ef
fects on humans would have been
"potentially devastating," he said.
Goodkind said that pound animals
"have certainly been a vital source
(for research) over the years."
The University's Public Affairs of
fice had printed literature against the
Roberti bill, which said the measure
"would prohibit medical researchers
from obtaining any dogs and cats from
pounds — even though those animals
would otherwise be destroyed."
According to a University of Cali
fornia survey, the bill would have
quadrupled the cost ot obtaining re
search dogs and cats for 12 California
universities.
But I ise Giraud. a librarian at
Green and a proponent of the bill,
said "the biomedical establishment"
used a "propaganda barrage that was
totally unjustified." She said the
"implication to the public at large that
medical research would come to a
grinding halt" is false.
Giraud also complained that the in
creased costs of purchasing animals
for research is "dwarfed by (scientist)
salary costs." She said this issue was
never discussed.
Roberti. in a statement released
yesterday afternoon, said. "The fact
that it dragged 011 for a year indicates
that we were fearful all along that the
votes were short in the committee.
"I will recommend to the numerous
humane groups that are involved in
this issue that the avenue to them to
change the hearts and minds of the
legislature is to appeal directly to the
people. Most surveys that have been
taken . . . indicate that the majority
are 011 the anti-pound seizure side."
Roberti said.
