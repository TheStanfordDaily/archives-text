## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
Approximately 50 personal computers will be
installed in Meyer Library next fall for the general
use ot students, according to the chairman of an ad
hoc committee on the librarv.
"We're going in cautiouslv in the fall vvith 50
Macintoshes." said Carolyn l.ougee. associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences, who chaired the
committee, "and three other kinds will probably
come after that."
I lie computers will be installed partially in con
junction vvith a faculty-author development pro
gram that w ill be implemented this summer to pro
vide technical assistance for professors who wish to
develop computer supplements to then classes.
Students will check out microdiscs at the Meyer
reserve desk to be used for selected courses.
" V\e want to provide public access for students

who don't own their own machines." explained
Elizabeth Salzer. head of Meyer Library She said
computers would also be placed in several depart
ments and department libraries on campus.
" It's not clear whether there will be some time
limit placed on the computers or whether there will
be some priority given to people in the classes."
said l.ougee. "It's not even clear how high the
demand will be for the computers."
Salzer said. "We will be monitoring how well the
computers lit in at the librar\ and we are hoping to
have fairly quiet ones." She said the computers will
be available only during Meyer's regular hours and
that no extension ot hours is planned for next year.
"Several sites on campus were considered for
the computers." l.ougee said, "but I don't think
there's any other place that can handle that num
ber. We also felt that personal computers are a
technology that belong in that library if people are

going to be checking out materials to use for
classes." She added that she thought the com
puters would be removed from Meyer "if people
are just using them for word processing and uses
not related to other functions of the library."
Due to the amount ot noise they make, no print
ers will be put in the library. "We don't want to to
do anything to change the basic atmosphere ot the
library." said l.ougee. "We want to see what the
impact will be on space, traffic, the environment
and whole feel of the library before we decide to
continue putting computers there."
Eventually Meyer's first floor, which now houses
the audio visual department and language lab, mav
be rearranged to provide computer space. Accor
ding to l.ougee this area would probably be open
24 hours. "It probably won't happen next year,"
she said.
