Labor court rules against
lockout of German workers
Frankfurt, West Germany — The Frankfurt labor court
issued a temporary restraining order yesterday against a
metal industry employers' plan to lock out 26,300 metal
workers, the union 1G Metall said.
The court ruled in favor of a suit by IG Metall. which began
a series of strikes to press demands for a 35-hour
workweek with no loss of pay. The labor dispute has
paralyzed the auto industry.
The employers are expected to appeal the court decision.
The lockout had been announced earlier yesterday by
employers at 16 plants in the state of Hesse, after district
level negotiations between IG Metall and employers broke
down late Tuesday in the neighboring state of Baden-
Wuerrtemberg.
Until yesterday's move by employers, about 123,000
workers had been directly involved — 58,000 on strike and
65,000 locked out — in the labor dispute in the states of
Baden-Wuerrtemberg and Hesse.
In addition, at least 100.000 more workers, chiefly from the
automotive industry, were idled as their plants were shut
down by a lack of parts.
Immigration raid smashes
illegal alien smuggling ring
Los Angeles — Immigration raids yesterday smashed a
''barbaric" smuggling ring that allegedly sold illegal aliens
around the country, federal officials said.
"They became the property of whoever paid the smuggler
for that person," said Hal Ezell, western regional commis
sioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. "They
were barbaric."
INS agents climaxed a 10-month investigation with the ar
rests of eight people, including the 17-year-old son of the al
leged ringleader, who eluded authorities. The father was not
identified.
Nearly SO illegal aliens, most from Mexico, also were ar
rested in simultaneous raids on two homes in the Los Angeles
suburb of Compton and at a commercial property in San
Diego.
The aliens face court hearings if they refuse voluntary
deportation. Ezell said.
Each day, as many as 400 aliens paid $300 to be driven the
125 miles from San Diego to squalid housing in Compton.
Ezell said.
Officials suspect as many as 100 non-Hispanic drivers were
paid $50 for each alien they transported, he said.
Ezell described the San Diego facility, apparently owned by
the ringleader, as a place where aliens were sold, hidden in
car trucks and smuggled through Border Patrol checkpoints.

Nations must announce bans
on chemicals, U.N. group says
Nairobi, Kenya — The U.N. Environment Program said
yesterday that nations which ban chemicals produced on their
territory must alert potential importing nations.
Executive Director Mustapha Tolba announced a plan un
der which U.N. member nations would notify each other
whenever a chemical's use is banned.
Tolba said there has been growing evidence of industrial
ized nations dumping dangerous chemicals, banned by their
own local health organizations, on unsuspecting Third World
countries.
Under the new plan, "Importing countries will be better in
formed of the hazards of chemicals in international trade and
will be able to make informed decisions on the use of such
chemicals," Tolba said in a news release.
Labor court rules against
lockout of German workers
Frankfurt, West Germany — The Frankfurt labor court
issued a temporary restraining order yesterday against a
metal industry employers' plan to lock out 26,300 metal
workers, the union 1G Metall said.
The court ruled in favor of a suit by IG Metall. which began
a series of strikes to press demands for a 35-hour
workweek with no loss of pay. The labor dispute has
paralyzed the auto industry.
The employers are expected to appeal the court decision.
The lockout had been announced earlier yesterday by
employers at 16 plants in the state of Hesse, after district
level negotiations between IG Metall and employers broke
down late Tuesday in the neighboring state of Baden-
Wuerrtemberg.
Until yesterday's move by employers, about 123,000
workers had been directly involved — 58,000 on strike and
65,000 locked out — in the labor dispute in the states of
Baden-Wuerrtemberg and Hesse.
In addition, at least 100.000 more workers, chiefly from the
automotive industry, were idled as their plants were shut
down by a lack of parts.
Immigration raid smashes
illegal alien smuggling ring
Los Angeles — Immigration raids yesterday smashed a
''barbaric" smuggling ring that allegedly sold illegal aliens
around the country, federal officials said.
"They became the property of whoever paid the smuggler
for that person," said Hal Ezell, western regional commis
sioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. "They
were barbaric."
INS agents climaxed a 10-month investigation with the ar
rests of eight people, including the 17-year-old son of the al
leged ringleader, who eluded authorities. The father was not
identified.
Nearly SO illegal aliens, most from Mexico, also were ar
rested in simultaneous raids on two homes in the Los Angeles
suburb of Compton and at a commercial property in San
Diego.
The aliens face court hearings if they refuse voluntary
deportation. Ezell said.
Each day, as many as 400 aliens paid $300 to be driven the
125 miles from San Diego to squalid housing in Compton.
Ezell said.
Officials suspect as many as 100 non-Hispanic drivers were
paid $50 for each alien they transported, he said.
Ezell described the San Diego facility, apparently owned by
the ringleader, as a place where aliens were sold, hidden in
car trucks and smuggled through Border Patrol checkpoints.

are expected to testify , including one man w ho claims to have
been a professional government hitman who once was asked
by a top-ranking military official to kill Aquino.
Also expected to take the stand are passengers and jour

landed in Manila just before he was killed.
