# Persian Gulf hostilities continue

From The Washington I'ost ami Ids Angeles Times
Manama, Bahrain — Iraq yesterday
announced resumption of its air attacks
against shipping in Iranian waters of the
Persian Gulf after a five-day lull.
A military spokesman said on Bagh
dad radio that Iraqi aircraft had inflicted
"direct and accurate" damage on a
"large naval target." the usual Iraqi
description for a tanker or freighter.
There was no confirmation of the at
tack. which Iraq said took place south til
kharg Island. Iran's main oil terminal.
Last Friday. Iraq claimed to have
destroyed eight ships — believed to be
small coastal vessels — in the Khor Musa
channel connecting the Iranian port of
Bandar Khomeini with the northern end
of the gulf.
The previous day Iranian aircraft
damaged the Liberian-registered
29.427-ton tanker Chemical Venture oil
Saudi Arabia in retaliation for a claimed
Iraqi air attack against two ships near
Kharg Island.
An Iraqi air-to-sea missile had nar
rowly missed the 140.000-ton tanker
Arizona as the Panamanian-registered
ship was headed south with a cargo of
crude oil loaded at Kharg Island.
The announcement of new attacks
took place as Iraq warned of widening
the 44-month-old war. Even before, in
formed sources had predicted the lull
was only temporary and designed to al
low Saudi Arabia and its Arab partners
to complete air defense plans.
"As long as Iran stays on Iraqi soil the
war will continue and could even spread
to other areas." Iraqi Information Mini
ster Latif Nassif Jassem told Turkish
journalists accompanying their prime
minister, Turgut Ozal, on a visit to Bagh
dad.
Knowledgeable sources suggested that
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz con
veyed a similar message when he con
ferred yesterday with King Fahd and
Foreign Minister Saud Faisal of Saudi
Arabia in Jeddah.
Kuwait wants missiles too
Washington — Kuwait informally has
asked the United States to provide it
with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles such as
those sold earlier this week to Saudi
Arabia, Defense Department sources
said yesterday.
The Kuwaitis, who asked U.S. officials
in their country for permission to buy an
unspecified number of Stingers, were
"told that they need to formalize their
request" before any action can be taken,
a defense official said.
"I guess they feel just as vulnerable"
as the Saudis to Iraqi and Iranian
warplanes that have attacked Persian
Gulf shipping in recent weeks, he added.
The official noted that the Saudis have
hc-L-n sliming with Kuwait military intelli
gence nlcancd from U.S. Airborne

Warning and Control System (AWACS)
planes assigned to Saudi Arabia to moni
tor the gull.
A senior defense official said yester
day that "the Saudis have a responsibility
to protect Kuwait's interests. The Saudi
responsibility is regional self-defense."
It is not clear, however, whether that
viewpoint would preclude emergency
U.S. military sales to Kuwait, where a
15-member U.S. military mission has
been to study that country's defense
needs.
There is a "consensus" in the Pent
agon that "it's the Saudis' turn" to take

military action in the gulf now that the
United States has provided them with
400 shoulder-fired Stingers, extra fuel
tanks for their F-15 fighters and four
U.S-manned aerial tankers to allow them
to maintain round-the-clock patrols, the
senior official said.
The Saudis also are buying from the
United States more than 1000 sophisti
cated A9L air-to-air missiles that allow
an F-15 to fire head-on at an enemy
plane and not have to maneuver behind
it to aim a heat-seeking missile at its ex
haust.
"You would have to try hard to have
an F-15 with an A9L not sweep the
skies," the senior official added. "But it
takes the political will to be able to shoot
down either an Iraqi or Iranian airplane.
That's what everybody's waiting to see if
the Saudis will do."
In a meeting with Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger here yesterday, Is
raeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens
protested the sale of the 400 Stinger
missiles to Saudi Arabia because of con
cern that they could be stolen by terror
ists and used against commercial aircraft.
"I don't see that shoulder-fired, short
range anti-aircraft missiles are going to
make any difference" in the gulf war,
particularly since the Saudis are well
defended with F-15s and Hawk missiles,

Arens later said at a press conference.
I'.S. and Europe respond to gulf war
I nited Nations — The United States
yesterday condemned attacks on Persian
Ciult shipping outside the Iranian-Iraqi
war /one and non-aligned nations sought
to tone down an anti-Iranian resolution
proposed by Arab states in behind-the
scenes negotiations.
"The Security Council should take a
clear and unambiguous stand against the
extremely dangerous expansion ol the
war by attacks on innocent vessels in in
ternational waters or in the territorial

waters of non-combatants." said U.S.
Ambassador Jose Sorzano.
The United States. Sorzano said,
"firmly supports the views expressed by
the Gulf Cooperation Council."the pro-
Iraqi group of six gull Arab states
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman. Bahrain,
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
The U.S. statement did not strongly
condemn Iran, as the gull states are
pushing the Security Council to do.
However, supporting the Arabs' posi
tion. it omitted any condemnation of
tanker attacks in the northern gull war
zone, as have been carried out by Iraq.
"We must prevent a widening of the
war in the Persian Gulf which might dis
rupt the vital How of oil and for that rea
son we urge that the council take
meaningful action in addressing this criti
cally important matter," Sorzano said.
Eager to avoid being drawn into any
new Western military intervention in the
Middle East. West European countries
have reacted cautiously to the escalation
of fighting in the Persian Gulf and have
played down the threat to their oil
supplies.
Gulf war not expected to up oil prices
Washington — Attacks on oil tankers
in the Persian Gulf should not force oil
prices up this year during the peak sum
mer driving season, the Energy Informa

tion Ulministration predicted yesterday.
However. '•normal seasonal factors"
will raise the cost of gasoline slightly —
about foui cents a gallon — between
Januarv and September of this year, ac
cording to the agency, an independent
research branch of the Energy Depart
ment.
In the longer term, the agency's
"Annual Energy Outlook" found, con
tinuum energv conservation will lead to
stable oil prices and ample supplies
through 1995.
••Unless the hostilities spread well
beyond the Iran-Iraq conflict, we don't
see a substantial impact on world oil
prices — and hence on petroleum prod
ucts. such as gasoline and heating oil. in
the United States any time in the
foreseeable future." J- Erich Evcred.
who heads the agency, said at a news
conference.
Evcred said that even if the 44-month
old war closed the Strait of Hormu/,
through which oil tankers must pass to
leave the gulf, it "would not necessarily
mean that much of a reduction in the
availability of oil to the world.
It that happened, he predicted,
countries outside the gult would boost
production and some oil from Saudi
Arabia could he transported overland by
pipeline to the Red Sea.
Since last winter. Iran and Iraq have
claimed attacks on more than 30 vessels
in the strategic waterway. Iraq, seeking
to reduce Tehran's oil revenue, has
declared a blockade /one around Iran's
main oil terminal at Kharg Island and has
concentrated its aerial assaults there,
while Iran has conducted raids in the
southern sector of the gulf.
A total of 20 percent of the world's oil.
much of it destined for Western Europe
and Japan, is shipped through the gulf.
The United States imports only 3 percent
of its oil from the gulf.
The report predicted that the average
world oil price — currently about $29 a
barrel — will decline to $26 by 19N6 and
then rise to $50 by 1995.
Overall, the report said. U.S. oil im
ports in 19N3 fell to their lowest point in
12 years, largely because of continuing
energy conservation.
"Increasing efficiency in energy use is
evident in all sectors of the economy,"
Evcred said. " I he last decade's rising
real energy prices led directly to the use
of more efficient cars, machinery, build
ings and processes — and to direct
reductions in energy consumption."
Although petroleum conservation is
expected to increase, the fossil fuel likely
will remain as the major fuel used in the
United States, the report predicted. But
it also forecast greater use of electricity,
coal and nuclear power.
