Jackson made the stop in East Palo
Alto to raise money and garner votes
for the June 5 California Democratic
primary. After his speech, supporters
passed around buckets to collect
money trom the crowd to help his
financially strapped campaign.
The latest polls indicate that former

Vice President Walter Mondale and
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart are in a vir
tual tie for the lead in the California
primary, with Jackson a distant third.
Jackson has said he hopes to get 20
percent of the vote in California.
New Jersey, West Virginia, New
Mexico and South Dakota will also
choose delegates June 5 to the Demo
cratic convention in San Francisco.
USW and the University have been
in a legal battle over the status of the
union, which represents Stanford. In
April, the bargaining unit voted to
change its representation from Local
715 to Local 680, but the University
refused to accept that change.
The National Labor Relations
Board yesterday decided to issue a
complaint against the University,
