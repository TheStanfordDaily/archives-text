# Speaking in East Palo Alto
## Jackson says he supports USW 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Daily staff 
Presidential candidate Rev. Jesse
Jackson told an overflow crowd of 700
in an elementary school gym in East
Palo Alto yesterday that he supports
the United Stanford Workers (USW)
in its dispute with the University.
"The poor are the United Stanford
Workers. They work and they don't
get paid enough for the work they
do," Jackson said.
Linda Crouse, president of USW.
told the crowd before Jackson arrived:
"We have asked each of the three
presidential candidates for their sup
port. and the only candidate who has
had the guts and the morality to sup
port us is Jesse Jackson."
C'rousc sui«.l in iiii interview after the
specch that she Uilkcd with Jackson in
San Francisco this morning when he

spoke to a meeting of longshoremen
there.
"We went up there, asked for his
help, and he very forthrightly said he
would support us," Crouse said. She
said he wore a button saying
"Solidarity Begins at Home — USW"
during his speech to the
longshoremen.
Crouse said that while she per
sonally supports Jackson for presi
dent. the union has not taken an offi
cial position on whom it will support in
the presidential race.
Jackson made the stop in East Palo
Alto to raise money and garner votes
for the June 5 California Democratic
primary. After his speech, supporters
passed around buckets to collect
money trom the crowd to help his
financially strapped campaign.
The latest polls indicate that former

Vice President Walter Mondale and
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart are in a vir
tual tie for the lead in the California
primary, with Jackson a distant third.
Jackson has said he hopes to get 20
percent of the vote in California.
New Jersey, West Virginia, New
Mexico and South Dakota will also
choose delegates June 5 to the Demo
cratic convention in San Francisco.
USW and the University have been
in a legal battle over the status of the
union, which represents Stanford. In
April, the bargaining unit voted to
change its representation from Local
715 to Local 680, but the University
refused to accept that change.
The National Labor Relations
Board yesterday decided to issue a
complaint against the University,

ance in East Palo Alto yesterday.
USW officials said.
Jackson's verbal support of the
union comes in the wake of the recent
cancellation of a scheduled speech by
Mondale here. USW sent Mondale a
telegram Friday asking that he speak
out against the University's relations
with labor and threatened to picket if
he did not.
University President Donald Ken
nedy immediately released a state
ment saying the union's threatened
picket probably had some influence on
Mondale's cancellation. A spokesper
son for the Mondale campaign said,
however, that the decision to cancel
was not based on USW's threat.
Most of the people in yesterday's
crowd, who packed into a hot gym to
see Jackson, focused on the candidate
and his message. Chanting "win,
Jesse, win" before he walked into the
gym, they gave Jackson a standing
ovation when he arrived.
Often speaking in a shaky voice,
Jackson told the crowd that his cam

paign's mission is to "defend (he poor,
deliver the needy, to reach out for the
locked out. to lift the boats stuck on
the bottom.
"Under (President) Reagan, there
are more wrecked ships, 8 million
more people in poverty, 3 million of
them children. Now 15 percent of our
nation is in poverty," Jackson said.
"The,poor are not poor because
they're lazy. The poor in fact work the
hardest and the longest on the nastiest
jobs and make the least amount of
money. The poor are the most
patriotic. Their children are the first to
die in these foolish foreign wars.
"The poor are the United Stanford
Workers. They work and don't get
paid for the work that they do."
Jackson said his campaign "focuses
on the poor because we're the con
science of the (Democratic) party and
the conscience of the nation.
"Mondale and Hart cannot talk
about the poor as I talk about the
poor. They have not lived way down
below. They talk about it but they
have limited experience. They didn't
grow up in the projects. They don't
understand. They have never been

denied equal protection under the law.
They just don't understand. They've
never seen their father come back
home the veteran of foreign wars and
couldn't vote. They just don't under
stand.
"They never had to march for the
right to use the bathroom downtown.
They just don't understand. They
never had to go up the back stairs of a
movie theater . . . they mean well,
they just don't understand.
"If you want somebody who under
stands life from the bottom up ... if
you want somebody who will care
about children, if you want somebody
w ho will care about poor people in the
pit of life, here am I. say amen.
"You must come alive on June 5.
Your time has come.
"We've run the most cost-efficient
campaign in American history. We've
raised less than $3 million. Hart
around $10 million, Mondale around
$15 million. If Mondale and Hart had
my budget, they could not compete. If
I had their budget, they still could not
compete. Don't judge me just by
where I am, judge me bv where I
started from. We've come a mighty

lung way.
"We need a new direction. It you
change from a Republican elephant to
a Democratic donkey, going in the
same direction, just a little slower,
that's not enough.
"Hart and Mondale want to raise
the military budget in peace time. I
argue that we can cut the budget with
out cutting defense, and we can use
that money to rebuild our nation."
Jackson has proposed a 20 percent
cut in military spending.
"Hart and Mondale want to keep
military advisers in Central America.
Well, military advisers give military
advice. Their advice: military solu
tions and more soldiers. I say bring the
boys back home and send economic
advisers.
"They say they are against apar
theid. but they have no plan to light
apartheid. As president, I would not
license another American corporation
to go to South Africa.
"The workers at Stanford are fight
ing for their lives. We support these
workers. They're lighting for livable
wages. Let us support them," Jackson
said.

never had to go up the back stairs of a

they just don't understand.

you want somebody who will care

pit of life, here am I. say amen.
"You must come alive on June 5.
Your time has come.
"We've run the most cost-efficient
campaign in American history. We've
raised less than $3 million. Hart
around $10 million, Mondale around
$15 million. If Mondale and Hart had
my budget, they could not compete. If
I had their budget, they still could not
compete. Don't judge me just by
where I am, judge me bv where I
started from. We've come a mighty

lung way.
"We need a new direction. It you
change from a Republican elephant to
a Democratic donkey, going in the
same direction, just a little slower,
that's not enough.
"Hart and Mondale want to raise
the military budget in peace time. I
argue that we can cut the budget with
out cutting defense, and we can use
that money to rebuild our nation."
Jackson has proposed a 20 percent
cut in military spending.
"Hart and Mondale want to keep
military advisers in Central America.
Well, military advisers give military
advice. Their advice: military solu
tions and more soldiers. I say bring the
boys back home and send economic
advisers.
"They say they are against apar

"The workers at Stanford are fight

workers. They're lighting for livable
wages. Let us support them," Jackson
said.



Rev. Jesse Jackson supports United Stanford Workers in a speech in East Palo Alto as an elementary school girl cheers
Presidential candidate Rev. Jesse
Jackson told an overflow crowd of 700
in an elementary school gym in East
Palo Alto yesterday that he supports
the United Stanford Workers (USW)
in its dispute with the University.
"The poor are the United Stanford
Workers. They work and they don't
get paid enough for the work they
do," Jackson said.
Linda Crouse, president of USW.
told the crowd before Jackson arrived:
"We have asked each of the three
presidential candidates for their sup
port. and the only candidate who has
had the guts and the morality to sup
port us is Jesse Jackson."
C'rousc sui«.l in iiii interview after the
specch that she Uilkcd with Jackson in
San Francisco this morning when he

spoke to a meeting of longshoremen
there.
"We went up there, asked for his
help, and he very forthrightly said he
would support us," Crouse said. She
said he wore a button saying
"Solidarity Begins at Home — USW"
during his speech to the
longshoremen.
Crouse said that while she per
sonally supports Jackson for presi
dent. the union has not taken an offi
cial position on whom it will support in
the presidential race.
Jackson made the stop in East Palo
Alto to raise money and garner votes
for the June 5 California Democratic
primary. After his speech, supporters
passed around buckets to collect
money trom the crowd to help his
financially strapped campaign.
The latest polls indicate that former

Vice President Walter Mondale and
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart are in a vir
tual tie for the lead in the California
primary, with Jackson a distant third.
Jackson has said he hopes to get 20
percent of the vote in California.
New Jersey, West Virginia, New
Mexico and South Dakota will also
choose delegates June 5 to the Demo
cratic convention in San Francisco.
USW and the University have been
in a legal battle over the status of the
union, which represents Stanford. In
April, the bargaining unit voted to
change its representation from Local
715 to Local 680, but the University
refused to accept that change.
The National Labor Relations
Board yesterday decided to issue a
complaint against the University,

ance in East Palo Alto yesterday.
USW officials said.
Jackson's verbal support of the
union comes in the wake of the recent
cancellation of a scheduled speech by
Mondale here. USW sent Mondale a
telegram Friday asking that he speak
out against the University's relations
with labor and threatened to picket if
he did not.
University President Donald Ken
nedy immediately released a state
ment saying the union's threatened
picket probably had some influence on
Mondale's cancellation. A spokesper
son for the Mondale campaign said,
however, that the decision to cancel
was not based on USW's threat.
Most of the people in yesterday's
crowd, who packed into a hot gym to
see Jackson, focused on the candidate
and his message. Chanting "win,
Jesse, win" before he walked into the
gym, they gave Jackson a standing
ovation when he arrived.
Often speaking in a shaky voice,
Jackson told the crowd that his cam

paign's mission is to "defend (he poor,
deliver the needy, to reach out for the
locked out. to lift the boats stuck on
the bottom.
"Under (President) Reagan, there
are more wrecked ships, 8 million
more people in poverty, 3 million of
them children. Now 15 percent of our
nation is in poverty," Jackson said.
"The,poor are not poor because
they're lazy. The poor in fact work the
hardest and the longest on the nastiest
jobs and make the least amount of
money. The poor are the most
patriotic. Their children are the first to
die in these foolish foreign wars.
"The poor are the United Stanford
Workers. They work and don't get
paid for the work that they do."
Jackson said his campaign "focuses
on the poor because we're the con
science of the (Democratic) party and
the conscience of the nation.
"Mondale and Hart cannot talk
about the poor as I talk about the
poor. They have not lived way down
below. They talk about it but they
have limited experience. They didn't
grow up in the projects. They don't
understand. They have never been

denied equal protection under the law.
They just don't understand. They've
never seen their father come back
home the veteran of foreign wars and
couldn't vote. They just don't under
stand.
"They never had to march for the
right to use the bathroom downtown.
They just don't understand. They
never had to go up the back stairs of a
movie theater . . . they mean well,
they just don't understand.
