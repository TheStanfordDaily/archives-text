## Life begins in the womb according to the Bible 
### 
Pro-choice and anti-abortionists
have been debating back and forth
whether abortion is murder, an act of
convenience or "an individual's own
choice for the sanctity of life." But in
any discussion of abortion, the basic
parameter that must be determined is
the point at which life begins for a
fetus. Is the one-moment-old, con
ceived embryo a person? Since God is
the one who has given life to
humanity it follows that he would
have a good idea as to at what instant
life begins. In the book of Jeremiah.
(1:4,5) "The word of the Lord came
to me saying.
"Before I formed you in the
womb 1 knew you,
before you were born I set you
apart;
I appointed you as a prophet to
the nations."
God had plans for Jeremiah's life
before he was born; while in his
mother's womb Jeremiah was given a
special work as a prophet. We see
that God did not wait until after
Jeremiah's birth before God ap
pointed him. To abort Jeremiah's life
in the womb would prevented a cho
sen person of God from entering the
world.
Second. King David writes in
Psalm. 119:
"For you created my inmost
being: you knit me together in
my mother's womb . . .
My frame was not hidden from
you when I was made in the se
cret place . . .
All the days ordained for me
were written in your book
before one of them came to be."
The Bible indicates that God does
not wait until the baby's first move
ment or when it is prepared for life
outside of the mother's body before
He recognizes it as a living human
being. The opposite is true. God puts
the baby together inside the womb
and gives it life. It is not the right of
men and women to put to death that
which God has given life. The mo-

ment an embryo is conceived it
becomes a living person in the sight
of God, and to take life from this
embryo is to commit a murder,
however harsh this truth is. God is
not pleased with abortion.

Mondale and USW
It was right handsome of the union
to apologize for the Mondale flap. I
see nothing wrong with making a
candidate who has traded so heavily
on his support for union — and even
taken some lumps lor it — to fish or
cut bait on a union issue. President
Kennedy deplores the tactlessness of
making him take sides on a local
issue. 1 bet that a man of Mondale's
resources could have found someone
on the scene to enlighten him. He
might even have discovered that this
particular local issue has. alas, consi
derable universality, which should be
of concern to him. But then, Kennedy
himself said. Mondale was engaged
elsewhere and could not have come
here anyway, so what's the beef?
I think Mondale was dumb. By
coming here and supporting the
union, lie might have indeed lost one
vote — Kennedy's. But who is to say
that Kennedy, once in the privacy of
the voting booth, might feel a surge
of kinship with the other candidate,
his soulmate on union questions, the
subject of Stanford's next library and
a visitors' center and man for whose
Defense Department Kennedy has so
valiantly defended against all comers
the pursuit of scientific inquiry in the
Sychrotron Radiation Lab? That sort
of thing makes for some powerful
ties.
For the loss of that one very iffy
vote, Mondale could have earned
himself 1320 union members' and
given himself an air of integrity
besides — something that every
candidate needs more desperately
even than money. And should it have
turned out that those 1320 votes
carried him to victory in November,
lie could always have turned the other
check and given Kennedy his old job
back as head of the Federal Drui>

Administration. 1 could guarantee
there would be no dearth of people
here to give him a truly royal send
off.

Party for arms
1 feel compelled to express my
disappointment with those involved in
the Nicaraguan benefit held at
Synergy Friday evening. It is one
thing for students to raise money for
legitimate charity to Central
America, quite another to solicit from
uninformed students funds to support
the Sandinistas fighting our allies in
Central America.
These student activities didn't seem
to consider that if members of the
Stanford community, believing that
their donations are destined for food
and medical supplies, discover that
the funds will go to the Sandinista
Defense Committee — with no
strings attached (and a dubious des
tiny). they might be less generous and
receptive to other political programs
of all persuasions on campus.
Whether the activity would have
received the reception it did from
supporters if its organizers had been
more open about the destiny of the
monies raised is a moot question. I
fail to find any justification what
soever for this lack of candidness. I
urge those involved to place the
encouragement of student political
activity over their own particular
program, and offer an apology and
retribution to those members of the
Stanford community who were misin
formed as to the nature of the fund
raiser.

Anti-frat bias
I was a freshman in 1978 and '79.
I low many times did I hear "Trancos
Rules!" or "Let's go trash Brainier."
The Fire Department came numerous
times on unnecessary "emergency"
calls because some dormitory had
unleashed their firehoses on their

neighbors.
As a sophomore, 1 lived in one of
the most destructive dorms on
campus. I vividly recall several inci
dents of fist fights, broken windows,
loud arguments and general dis
respect for others among the mem
bers of my dorm. We were the "worst
dorm on campus" and many people
took pleasure in promoting this
notoriety. Have things changed signif
icantly in five or six years? I think
not. There may be pressure to curb
some of the destructive behavior but I
am sure it persists among dorm dwel
lers as well as fraternity dwellers.
Why didn't Cedro ever make the
front page of The Daily in 1978-80?
Was it because we did not have
Greek letters in our title? How about
the dorms in the spring of 1983-84?
Is everything as peaceful as Daily
coverage would let us believe? If not,
is The Daily conscientiously and
representatively reporting the news of
public disturbances on campus?

I.M. death
I am writing this letter in protest of
teams like "Death From Above"
going against the spirit of intramural
sports. They do not add anything to
the healthy and fun-filled recreational
activity most colleges nurture. "Death
From Above" is made up of
"ringers" recruited from all over
campus. According to the I M. Hand
hook. "players must have some
residence, social or specific interest
group affiliation." "Death From
Above" has none of the above.
For instance, a friend of mine, a
freshman who was cut from the men's
varsity volleyball team, was contacted
far in advance and asked to play for
this "elite" squad. This kind of
recruiting is ridiculous, and they
practice it in other sports as well. I
feel that teams like these should be
abolished so that we can all have
FUN.
Why does "Death From Above"
insist on ruining our fun?
