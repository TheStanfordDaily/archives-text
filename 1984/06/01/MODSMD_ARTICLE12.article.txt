## Manley speaks on Hoover, tenure 
### DANA RATLIFF 
Almost everyone has heard him, or at
least heard ol him. He's the guy who always
seems to be in the paper, always running
around with Prof. Ronald Rebholz yelling
about Hoover. But Political Science Prof.
John Manley is not only concerned with
Stanford's political ties.
On the contrary, Manley's critical analysis
of the University runs from the heights of
Hoover l ower to the often murky depths of
the faculty promotion and tenure policies.
Like many others, Manley is critical of the
"publish or perish" policies at many
schools, including Stanford.
"There is too much research, and teaching
comes second," says Manley. "There is a
reward system here that is dispropor
tionately emphasized. You may be a
dynamite teacher but if you don't publish
enough you won't be getting tenure."
According to Manley, "Research and
teaching should be equal and complemen
tary. But when a university is trying to be
No. 1, it requires research that is nar
row and specialized at the expense of the
students' level and interest. I've resisted
that trend toward extreme specialization by
asking much broader questions in my re
search."
In an effort to counter this "over
researched professor syndrome," Manley
attempts to combine the two most impor
tant aspects of a professor's job.
"I teach my research,"' said Manley,
"especially in my seminar course where I
present to the class the ideas 1 have been
thinking about in Green I-ibrary."
When he presents his research in class,
Manley says,"I feed the information into
the students and they feed it back out to me.

When you get them interested in the ma
terial you get fresh input . . . you could call
it synergy."
The vocal professor arrived on campus in
1971 after embracing the world of
academia; "somewhere along the line in
college I discovered that I like libraries and
learning," he says.
After getting his undergraduate degree in
political science, he went on to get a Ph.D.
so that he could teach at the college level,
which he claims to enjoy quite a bit.
"I really like the students at Stanford. I
have found that the students are tremen
dously open to the problems and research I
am dealing with. They get interested in what
I am doing and they want to participate. My
interaction with the students allows me to
try my ideas out on an audience. If they boo
and hiss or start dozing off, you know you
are in trouble."
Manley, who has been one of the
strongest voices in the Hoover controversy,
says, "When I'm not fighting Hoover, I
write, research and think"
Although he is happy that he has really
found his "niche" as a Stanford professor,
he continues to be critical of the University.
In addition to condemning the tenure
process, he also continues to question Stan
ford's relation to what he and many others
see as the politically partisan Hoover Insti
tution, a debate by which he is perhaps most
recognized on campus.
"There is a contradiction between what a
university stands for and what is happening
at Stanford right now. We should not be
supporting an institution like Hoover with
its partisan objectives," says Manley.
"Hoover Tower is not just a tall library
and archive like it was many years ago. It

houses an institution with a political bent
with a $70 million endowment and a budget
of $9.3 million, from which only one-third
is used for the library. The other two-thirds
is to support Hoover as a "political think
tank."
Manley sees Hoover's status in many
ways dependent on the University.
"Suppose you wanted to house a political
think tank ... it would be great to have a
leading university connected with you so
you could push your program aided by that
indirect support from the school.
"Stanford students have direct interest in
maintaining the school's reputation for ob
jectivity." says Manley. "Who wants to get a
degree from a University that contains
within it a political institution?"
The current problem concerning Hoover
is, according to Manley. determining what
Hoover's real problem is. "You've got two
conventions at odds with each other. Presi
dent Kennedy says that there is a problem
with governance within the institution,
while our contention is that it is a political
problem. The problem is getting the issue
into public form so that the Stanford com
munity can debate it on an informed
level. . . . The faculty had voted for a
reassessment of Hoover even before the
Reagan library had been suggested."
At present. Manley claims there is still no
objective committee researching the
Hoover Institution. "The issue is the struc
tural role of Hoover as an institution. Our
view is that if you look at the evidence,
Stanford is supporting one of the leading
political think tanks. The evidence we have
put forth has never been refuted, but simply
ignored."
