# McGrath takes top honors
## Ugly men compete for campus 'beauty' title 
### JEFF WEXLER 
Graduate student James McGrath was the
landslide winner in this year's Ugliest Man on
Campus (UMOC) contest, a fund-raiser spon
sored by service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega.
The contest raised more than $500 which was
donated to Palo Alto's Community Associa
tion for the Retarded in a ceremony held ves
terday in White Plaza. The victors of the con
test were revealed, with McGrath winning with
a whopping $307.75. Rohle Resident Assistant
George Bengston came in second place, raising
$54.14.
"I don't have much to say," McGrath said,
"except that I'd like to thank all of the people
who voted for me."
According to chairwoman Wendy Hansen,
the UMOC fund-raiser is a project recom
mended by the national association of Alpha
Phi Omega. Jars with the pictures of the candi
dates have been set up in White Plaza for the
last week, and members of the Stanford com
munity could vote for their favorite candidate
by dropping money into each candidate's
respective jar. McGrath won by raising the
most money.
"People were really enthusiastic," said Han
sen. "They were cracking up over the pictures
and donated pennies, quarters, even dollars."
Hansen explained that every pledge class to
Alpha Phi Omega must do a project. This year
the pledges took over the UMOC contest when
actives found that they were too busy. "Last
year the actives had a full quarter to organize
it. This year we had only 2V2 weeks." This
year's class has 26 members, the largest in
recent memory, according to Hansen.
Psychology Prof. Philip /.imbardo took the

top award last year, with Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon taking second place. "Rumor
has it that last year Dean Fred came by at the
last minute and threw $3 into /.imbardo's jar,
but no one really knows," Hansen said,
"/.imbardo declined a nomination this year on
grounds that he didn't want to win again."
A new feature was added to the contest this
year to try to get more candidates. "We asked
dorms to sponsor candidates for $10," said
Hansen. Bengston thinks this is how he got
nominated.
"I think my hall donated, but I'm not quite
sure." He said he thought this was a
worthwhile cause but said, "I'm not sure what
I'm doing with the likes of (University Presi
dent) Kennedy or (Dean of Humanities and
Sciences) Wessells."
Hansen thinks that having more students
running added to the popularity ot the contest.
Student candidates included Jon Kaplan, the
house manager at Terra House, IFC President
Steve Pierce, sophomore Diego Cordovez and
the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Kennedy led the faculty and staff race, com
ing in sixth with $12.16. Other staff included
Football Coach Jack Elway, Basketball Coach
Tom Davis and Marv Herrington, the chief of
Stanford Police.
"I thought I had to have the mean vote
wrapped up," said Herrington. who came in
last place.
Hansen called the event a success, saying, "I
never expected it would go so high." She says
she expects that the event will be held again
next year. "The Stanford community was so
responsive â€” it was fantastic."
