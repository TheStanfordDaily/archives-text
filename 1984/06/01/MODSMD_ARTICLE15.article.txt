1 Many adjectives would be needed to describe each of us. Which single adjective do you think would most frequently be used
to describe you by those who know you best/ Briefly explain.
If 1 had to hcluct a single adjective to describe ine (if
I had. to, mind you), it would be serendipitous. It is my
fate in life to discover more by accident than on purpose.
Good things (mostly), bad things (some tiir.es), it doesn't
matteri I continually stumble upon them, run into them,
trip over them, fall upon them, wake up to them, and take
advantage of them.
Sometimes they make me feel happy. Sometimes they make
me feel sad. They can make me look good. They can also
make me look worse than I am. lam not a good planner.
I don't like to plan. At least not much. I like to leave
plenty of room for serendipity to operate. I leave room
in my life for accidents to happen, for opportunities to
present themselves. I think that's why I don't like maps
and can't remember street names or even where particular
dormitories on campus are located. It's also why I don't
know whether I am busy tomorrow or not. I like to give
serendipity a long leash, so to speak.
I think that is why I do not know what I want to be when I
grow up. Whatever it is I turn out to be, I want it to
be hospitable to serendipity. Maybe like an admissions
dean. I understand that involves finding out about a lot of
things by accident, even while pretending it's all well
thought-through and planned. Or maybe something else.
Whatever. If you like serendipity, you'd like me. That's
what my friends tell me. How does it work? Well, if I hadn't
been asked to write this essay, I wouldn't have had to think
of an adjective. And if I hadn't had to do that, I wouldn't
have thought of serendipity. And if I hadn't had to do that,
I wouldn't have checked the dictionary. And without that
I wouldn't have found out the word was coined by Horace Wal
pole. And if I hadn't learned that, I wouldn't have stum
bled upon the fact that it was Walpole who wrotei "The
world is a comedy to those who think, a tragedy to those
who feel." And finding that out helped me put some other
things in perspective today. I wish the reader a long and
serendipitous life.
I hereby apply for admission to the Freshman Class at Stanford, and I certify that ALL of the information provided herein is my own work

Probably the closest thing Stanford has to a real
tradition, Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon has
endeared himself to many of the 20,000 or so stu
dents he's accepted here.
But just as he has closed the files on thousands of
high school seniors every spring for the past 15
years, Hargadon will close his own Stanford file later
this month as he leaves for New York and the Col
lege Board.
A nationwide search is still underway for possible
successors. But whoever opens his mail box to find
that proverbial fat envelope will have a tough act to
follow.
