# Demo nomination isn't alone on ballot
## Other races, propositions in Tuesday's vote 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
As so often happens in a presiden
tial election year, the presidential can
didates receive all the publicity. But
on June 5, as California Democrats
cast their votes in the primary elec
tion, several other issues and candi
dates will he on the ballot.
National, state and local politics are
all represented on the Democratic pri-

mary ballot. The races and issues dis
cussed below represent each of those
levels.
• Stanford Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy faces Richard Mattoon of the
Laßouche Party for the Democratic
nomination in the race for the 12th
District representative seat. The win
ner of that race will go on to face the
tirst-term incumbent Rep. Ed /schau
(R-Sunnyvale) in November.
• Proposition 20 adds a section to the
state constitution which provides that
any person who is found in a civil ac
tion suit to have made libelous or slan
derous statements against an op
ponent in a political campaign will not
be able to retain Ins or her seat. In or
der tor this section to apply, the libel
or slander must have been a major
contributing cause in the defeat of an
opposing candidate and the statement
must have been made with knowledge
that it was false or with reckless disre
gard for its truth.
I he supporters of the measure
argue that current laws only allow a
defeated candidate to recover mone

tary damages, even if the court decides
that the winner lied to defeat his op
ponent.
"Theie is no other profession where
persons can lie about themselves or
their competitors and keep their jobs
or continue to do business," Art
Agnos. a member of the California
Assembly from the 16th District wrote
in the California ballot pamphlet.
But those in opposition to the
proposition have named it "the in
cumbent protection act of 19N4." Lib
ertarian Party members point to the
overwhelming number of incumbents
who voted for the proposition.
' Incumbents generally avoid any
mention of their challengers, while
newcomers must challenge the record
of the incumbents. Under this mea
sure campaigns will be turned around,
with challengers put on the defensive.
Whenever any incumbent is defeated,
the results of the election will be in
question until any trials (and appeals)
are completed.*' read the opposing
statement.
Another point of contention is how
libel and slander charges would be
proven. It the incident must have been
a contributing factor to the election
outcome, then voters will be forced to
reveal not only why but whom they
voted for, according to opponents of
the measure. "Such trials would mean
the end of the secret ballot in Califor
nia." the opposition charged.
But others have different concerns
about the measure. In its potential
limitation of free speech. Communica
tion Prof. Elie Abel said. "It seems to
raise a serious lirst amendment ques
tion."

• Proposition 16 would authorize the
state to sell $250 million in state gen
eral obligation bonds to be used tor
the construction, reconstruction,
remodeling and replacement ol county
jails.
Supporters of this measure, includ
ing California Gov. George Deuk
mejian. said. "Passage ol this measure
is desperately needed it we are to con
tinue isolating serious ottenders trom
law-abiding citizens."
Opponents of the measure state that
if both Propositions I 6 and 17. a state
prison funding act. pass, voters will
have approved $3 billion tor new jails
and prisons in the past two years. Lib
ertarian candidates ask the inevitable:
"Where is this money really going'.'
Another concern is the tax increase
opponents fear will accompany the
measure. "As taxes go up. the state
creates more criminals to put in their
new jails. It's a never-ending cycle,
the opponents wrote in the ballot
pamphlet.
But defenders of the measure point
to the overcrowding of present
facilities as well as the successes ol the
criminal system in general.
"Removing criminals is working. The
crime rate is going down. Now is not
the time to revert to the practice of
putting more criminals on probation."
• Proposition 17 is similar to Proposi
tion 16 in that it would authorize the
sale of $300 million in state general
obligation bonds for the construction
and maintenance of state prison
facilities. Arguments for and against
the measure divide into similar camps.
Deukmejian and state senators
Joseph Montoya (26th District) and
Robert Presley (36th District) said,
"This bond measure will cost less than
$2 per year for each citizen of this
state. This is obviously a small price to
pay for increased public safety."
But Rev. John Deckenback, on be
half of the California Church Council,
and Patricia Marrone, on behalf of the
Friends Committee on l egislation,
argue, "The habit of spending will not
solve the problem of prison over
crowding." They advocate instead
several proposals that would attempt

to ease overcrowding without nec<
sitating new construction and ni
funds.

facilities as well as the successes ol the
criminal system in general.
"Removing criminals is working. The
crime rate is going down. Now is not
the time to revert to the practice of
putting more criminals on probation."
• Proposition 17 is similar to Proposi
tion 16 in that it would authorize the
sale of $300 million in state general
obligation bonds for the construction
and maintenance of state prison
facilities. Arguments for and against
the measure divide into similar camps.
Deukmejian and state senators
Joseph Montoya (26th District) and
Robert Presley (36th District) said,
"This bond measure will cost less than
$2 per year for each citizen of this
state. This is obviously a small price to
pay for increased public safety."
But Rev. John Deckenback, on be
half of the California Church Council,
and Patricia Marrone, on behalf of the
Friends Committee on l egislation,
argue, "The habit of spending will not
solve the problem of prison over
crowding." They advocate instead
several proposals that would attempt

to ease overcrowding without nec<
sitating new construction and ni
funds.

As so often happens in a presiden
tial election year, the presidential can
didates receive all the publicity. But
on June 5, as California Democrats
cast their votes in the primary elec
tion, several other issues and candi
dates will he on the ballot.
National, state and local politics are
all represented on the Democratic pri-

mary ballot. The races and issues dis
cussed below represent each of those
levels.
• Stanford Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy faces Richard Mattoon of the
Laßouche Party for the Democratic
nomination in the race for the 12th
District representative seat. The win
ner of that race will go on to face the
tirst-term incumbent Rep. Ed /schau
(R-Sunnyvale) in November.
• Proposition 20 adds a section to the
state constitution which provides that
any person who is found in a civil ac
tion suit to have made libelous or slan
derous statements against an op
ponent in a political campaign will not
be able to retain Ins or her seat. In or
der tor this section to apply, the libel
or slander must have been a major
contributing cause in the defeat of an
opposing candidate and the statement
must have been made with knowledge
that it was false or with reckless disre
gard for its truth.
I he supporters of the measure
argue that current laws only allow a
defeated candidate to recover mone

tary damages, even if the court decides
that the winner lied to defeat his op
ponent.
"Theie is no other profession where
persons can lie about themselves or
their competitors and keep their jobs
or continue to do business," Art
Agnos. a member of the California
Assembly from the 16th District wrote
in the California ballot pamphlet.
But those in opposition to the
proposition have named it "the in
cumbent protection act of 19N4." Lib
ertarian Party members point to the
overwhelming number of incumbents
who voted for the proposition.
' Incumbents generally avoid any
mention of their challengers, while
newcomers must challenge the record
of the incumbents. Under this mea
sure campaigns will be turned around,
with challengers put on the defensive.
Whenever any incumbent is defeated,
the results of the election will be in
question until any trials (and appeals)
are completed.*' read the opposing
statement.
Another point of contention is how
libel and slander charges would be
proven. It the incident must have been
a contributing factor to the election
outcome, then voters will be forced to
reveal not only why but whom they
voted for, according to opponents of
the measure. "Such trials would mean
the end of the secret ballot in Califor
nia." the opposition charged.
But others have different concerns
about the measure. In its potential
limitation of free speech. Communica
tion Prof. Elie Abel said. "It seems to
raise a serious lirst amendment ques
tion."

• Proposition 16 would authorize the
state to sell $250 million in state gen
eral obligation bonds to be used tor
the construction, reconstruction,
remodeling and replacement ol county
jails.
Supporters of this measure, includ
ing California Gov. George Deuk
mejian. said. "Passage ol this measure
is desperately needed it we are to con
tinue isolating serious ottenders trom
law-abiding citizens."
Opponents of the measure state that
if both Propositions I 6 and 17. a state
prison funding act. pass, voters will
have approved $3 billion tor new jails
and prisons in the past two years. Lib
ertarian candidates ask the inevitable:
"Where is this money really going'.'
Another concern is the tax increase
opponents fear will accompany the
measure. "As taxes go up. the state
creates more criminals to put in their
new jails. It's a never-ending cycle,
the opponents wrote in the ballot
pamphlet.
But defenders of the measure point
to the overcrowding of present
facilities as well as the successes ol the
criminal system in general.

crime rate is going down. Now is not
