# Demo nomination isn't alone on ballot
## Other races, propositions in Tuesday's vote 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
As so often happens in a presiden
tial election year, the presidential can
didates receive all the publicity. But
on June 5, as California Democrats
cast their votes in the primary elec
tion, several other issues and candi
dates will he on the ballot.
National, state and local politics are
all represented on the Democratic pri-

mary ballot. The races and issues dis
cussed below represent each of those
levels.
• Stanford Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy faces Richard Mattoon of the
Laßouche Party for the Democratic
nomination in the race for the 12th
District representative seat. The win
ner of that race will go on to face the
tirst-term incumbent Rep. Ed /schau
(R-Sunnyvale) in November.
• Proposition 20 adds a section to the
state constitution which provides that
any person who is found in a civil ac
tion suit to have made libelous or slan
derous statements against an op
ponent in a political campaign will not
be able to retain Ins or her seat. In or
der tor this section to apply, the libel
or slander must have been a major
contributing cause in the defeat of an
opposing candidate and the statement
must have been made with knowledge
that it was false or with reckless disre
gard for its truth.
I he supporters of the measure
argue that current laws only allow a
defeated candidate to recover mone

tary damages, even if the court decides
that the winner lied to defeat his op
ponent.
"Theie is no other profession where
persons can lie about themselves or
their competitors and keep their jobs
or continue to do business," Art
Agnos. a member of the California
Assembly from the 16th District wrote
in the California ballot pamphlet.
But those in opposition to the
proposition have named it "the in
cumbent protection act of 19N4." Lib
ertarian Party members point to the
overwhelming number of incumbents
who voted for the proposition.
' Incumbents generally avoid any
mention of their challengers, while
newcomers must challenge the record
of the incumbents. Under this mea
sure campaigns will be turned around,
with challengers put on the defensive.
Whenever any incumbent is defeated,
the results of the election will be in
question until any trials (and appeals)
are completed.*' read the opposing
statement.
Another point of contention is how
libel and slander charges would be
proven. It the incident must have been
a contributing factor to the election
outcome, then voters will be forced to
reveal not only why but whom they
voted for, according to opponents of
the measure. "Such trials would mean
the end of the secret ballot in Califor
nia." the opposition charged.
But others have different concerns
about the measure. In its potential
limitation of free speech. Communica
tion Prof. Elie Abel said. "It seems to
raise a serious lirst amendment ques
tion."
