### CATHY JANUS 
Students planning a summer
of travel in Europe and other
exotic spots may be in for a
pleasant surprise guaranteed to
make their spirits and bank ac
counts happy.
Beginning this month, certain
charter flights between New
York and London may drop to
as low as $133 round trip, if
British and U.S. aviation auth
orities can reach agreement.
This would represent a greater
savings than even People's Ex

press, the current bargain inter
continental airline, offers.
Due to favorable exchange
rates in combination with bar
gain airfares, travel opportuni
ties — whether to London,
nearby Mexico or other faraway
places — are becoming the
bargain-hunter's dream come
true. "Vet it isn't only the British
charter companies that are cut
ting prices or offering package
deals. Just pick up the nearest
newspaper and you'll see ad
vertisements offering everything

from 45 percent off on a cruise
to Alaska, $339 to Hawaii in
cluding hotel and airfare or
$549 from New York to Lon
don.
Even bargain-buyers have to
pay a price, however, and the
drawback to many of these deals
is the conditions of travel. Many
advertisements are misleading.
Call for information before be
coming too excited about a
$250 one-way (light from Los
Angeles to Amsterdam. Such a

deal usually means flying stand
by .
The $133 New York to Lon
don flight would also be stand
by. Still pending government
approval, it does remain a possi
bility. Until then, People's Ex
press. so popular last year,
remains lowest, charging $169
each way for a no-frills ride.
Though this may seem expen
sive in comparison to proposed
airfares, it is still much cheaper
than APEX flights (advanced
purchase excursions). These can

run as high as $619 for a round
trip (light between New York
and London and $819 between
San Francisco and London.
Another seemingly fantastic
savings package offers seven
days in Waikiki and Maui, in
cluding hotel accommodations,
a cruise ol Pearl Harbor and
airfare, tor $259.5(). On closer
inspection, however, it appears
that round-trip airport to hotel
transfers are covered, but the
flight itself is not.
So read the fine print and

consult a travel agent before
paying $75 for a cruise to
Mexico and packing your
suitcase. You'll be embarrassed
to board ship with your baggage
in hand only to discover that
your vacation cruise departs at
10 a.m. from San Diego en
route to Ensenada and returns
the same evening at I I p.m.
Whether you plan to vacation
in Mazatlan or Madrid, keep a
discerning eye out for bargains
— sometimes they're just mis

leading advertisements. And
don't he in a hurry to take ad
