## He wields a hammer just for the fun of it 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
In a world where sporting events have
been marred by politics, drugs and an ex
treme emphasis on winning, it is refreshing
to come across an athlete like Stanford's
Shaun Pickering.
Pickering, a junior hammer thrower who
hails from Broxbourne, Great Britain, has
been one of the most productive point
scorers for the Cardinal men's track and
field team.
Here on the Farm, Pickering has qualified
for three Pacific-10 Championships in as
many years, having taken third place in the
conference during his sophomore season,
and second in both his freshman and junior
years.
Today Pickering will compete in the finals
of the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
Championships in Eugene, Ore., after
qualifying with a toss of 21 3 feet, 4 inches.
It was the seventh-best qualifying throw
in the meet for Pickering, who is coming oft
his best season ever; earlier this year he set
a school record by throwing the 16-pound
weight 225-1.
While Pickering, 6-feet-5 and 265
pounds, makes a sizable impression on the
field, it is the type of athlete he is that really
distinguishes him.
"He's out there just for fun," said Stan
lord Assistant Coach Dave Wollman, three
time NCAA Division II shot put and discus
champion from Indiana Central University.
â€¢"I'm a great believer in the sport-for
sport attitude," Pickering said. "I don't
believe in the win-at-all-costs attitude.
Everyone should be allowed to compete in
sports regardless of how well they do.
Although Pickering, who ranked sixth in
England in the hammer throw last year,
does plan to try out for the British Olympic
team, he said his chances ot making the
team are "somewhat slim."
"I'm gearing more toward (the Olmpic
Games in Seoul. Korea in) 1988, he said.
"The hammer throw is a very deep event at
home, more so than any other track and
field event."
While many athletes go in for long,
rigorous training schedules, Pickering has
adopted a different and less arduous train
ing philosophy. Some, even Pickering him
self. might call it laziness.
"I am lazy," the big, jovial Englishman
said with a smile. "I don't work that hard. I

never have. I don't work hard academically
or physically. I've nevei pushed myself as
hard as I could have, and I'm the liist to ad
mit it.
"It goes back to the idea that I compete in
sports for fun." he said. "It I worked harder,
it would detract from that enjoyment."
Wollman insisted Picketing is not really
lazy. "It's just that he gets distracted so
easily. Everybody has certain levels ot at
tention span. His attention span just isn't
that long. Mis biggest obstacle, priot to this
year, was himself."
Despite the problem of keeping Picker
ing's mind on his throwing. Wollman said
Pickering is still "an absolute joy to coach.
If it seems that Pickering succeeds despite
himself, one need not look \erv In toi a
reason why.
"I'm very lucky I inherited good natural
abilitv from my parents." Pickering said.
That is an understatement. Pickerings
parents have both carved quite a com
fortable niche for themselves in British ath
letic history. His father, Ron. was coach ot
the British Olympic team in 1964, and the
individual coach lot I ynn Davies, who won
the gold medal in the long jump in those
Games. Currently he is a popular sports
broadcaster lor the BBC.
"lie is probably one of the greatest
motivaters in sport." Pickering said of liis
father. "It's kind of interesting, because I'm
the one person he can't motivate."
Jean. Ins mother, is "definitely the athlete
in the family." Pickering said. She was an
Olympic bronze medalist in the 4x I (lO
meter relay at the Helsinki Olympic Games
in 1952. siie also was a two-time European
champion, once in 1950 for the 4x 100
relay and again in 1954 for the long jump.
"ft I can emulate anything she's done. I'll
be happy," Pickering said.
It is his father, however, who seems to be
more of a driving force in Pickering's ath
letic career.
"He's a very big influence," Pickering
said. "He's never forced me into any sport,
but he's always encouraged me and been
there for advice and support. It's nice when
1 can go out there and throw well and sot t of
give something back to him."
While most collegiate track and field ath
letes get to take the summer off. Picketing
heads back to England, where he competes
for the Haringcy Athletic Club in North
London.

I he club has won the British national club
championship for the past three years, and
its founder and president is none other than
Pickering's father.
By the time the junior returns to Stanford
next fall, he'll have to start preparing for the
winter indoor season.
"It makes vou tired." Pickcri|fe*said of his
extra-long season. It may. in tact, have
made him too tired during his sophomore
year, when Pickering's best throw was 21 1
feet, onlv lour feet better than his freshman
season.
I ast fall, however, when Pickering
arrived from England, he gave himself a
little break bv not beginning his hard train
ing until later. It has apparently paid off.
lie lias already reached the 225-foot
plateau this year, and today in the NCAA
finals, he said he will be looking to close the
season at 230 feet.
Wollman said Pickering's success in the
hammer this year has been due to a differ
ent attitude on the part of the big thrower.
"Up until this year he was in track and
field for a different reason than anybody
else." he said. "He was out there for fun.
111 is year he finally figured throwing
long w as more fun than throwing short, and
lie lias become serious about lifting and
throwing. Shaun realized this hasn't
detracted from the fun but added to it,"
Wollman said.
l or a big man, Pickering has surprising
speed. As a freshman, he said he ran the 40-
yard dash in 4.63 seconds.
Considering his size and speed, and the
fact that he is often seen stalking the campus
in a football practice jersey, one could easily
mistake Pickering for a football player here.
I le is, in fact, toying with such an idea.
I'm actually thinking of trying out for
fullback, just for the hell of it," said Picker
ing. who has the build of an offensive tackle
or defensive end.
"I like sports for enjoyment, and I'd like
to try football. It's an opportunity I may not
get again," he said. "I don't figure on
playing much, but 1 do think I'll have some
momentum over other guys."
Junior Danny Westerfield, a friend of
Pickering's as well as a tight end on the foot
ball team and a former discus thrower, said
Picketing may be too big. "I don't think
he'd be able to fit through some of the holes
inside."
