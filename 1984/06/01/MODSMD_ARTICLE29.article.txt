Moscow — The Soviet decision to boycott the
Los Angeles Olympic Games is final. Interna
tional Olympics Committee president Juan An
tonio Samaranch said yesterday after speaking
with Deputy Premier Nikolai Talyzin.
Samaranch, in Moscow for what he called a
"last attempt" to dissuade the Soviets from
leading a Communist bloc boycott of the Summer
Games, said he had offered "new arguments and
new assurances" that the United States would
comply strictly with its obligations as host to the
Olympic Games.
He added, however, that "for the U.S.S.R..
reconsideration of its position is no longer possi
ble. . . . Today, there is no hope."
Heaping blame on anti-Soviet groups in Cali
fornia for driving Moscow from the Olympics, the
lOC president, said in Spanish that "the Califor
nia extremist groups have done tremendous
damage to the Olympic movement."
Samaranch carried a letter from himself and the
lOC offering fresh assurances of U.S. compliance
with the Olympic Charter, but he did not say what

they were. The lOC chief spoke briefly by tele
phone with the Spanish news agency F.FL before
leaving Moscow in midafternoon.
Col. F. Don Miller, president of the United
States Olympic Committee, said Samaranch's
conclusion that the Soviet decision is final
"doesn't surprise me at all. . . .
"I accepted their decision as final aftei the
meetings in Lausanne 10 days ago." Miller said
yesterday in a telephone interview with the Los
Angeles Times from his offices in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
But Miller said he was somewhat surprised by
Samaranch's condemnation of "California ex
tremist groups."
" The president of the United States and all con
cerned have given assurances that all countries
would be welcome to participate in the Games,"
Miller said.
His meeting with Deputy Premier Taly/in, a
minor figure in the Soviet leadership, came as a
surprise to Western diplomats, who had expected
the lOC president to be granted an audience at
least with Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
