# Nat'l labor board rules against University stance
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) has ruled in favor of
United Stanford Workers (USW) in
USW's unfair labor practice charge
against the University, according to
USW officials.
Jim Eggleston, counsel to USW,
said yesterday that he was informed by
the NLRB that it had reached a
"decision to issue a complaint" yester
day on behalf of USW based on Stan
ford's refusal to recognize Local 680
from April IN onward.
University President Donald Ken
nedy said the decision "did not
surprise" him but would not comment
further until the University had
received the full text of the decision.
The written complaint should be
issued by next week, according to Eg
gleston.
On April 18, USW held a referen
dum election to approve its disaffilia
tion from Service Employees Interna
tional Union (SEIU) Local 715. The
election resulted in 632 votes cast in
favor of transfering collective bargain
ing to the Local 680 and 125 votes
against.
USW had been affiliated with Local
715 — the 9000-member countywide
union 1 — since 1980. From the union's
organization in 1973 till 1980, USW
was known as Local 680.
The University claims the April 18
election was not conducted according
to NLRB guidelines and the result was
therefore invalid.
Following the election, USW
amended its previous unfair labor
practice charge against the University
with the NLRB. The new charge
accused the University of ignoring the
results of a legal disaffiliation election
and continuing its refusal to recognize
Local 680 as the legal representative
of the Stanford bargaining unit.
Eggleston said the Nl.Rß's decision
indicated that the disaffiliation process

was "perfected with the election" and
that the board had confirmed Local
680's status as the legal bargaining
agent of the 1321 technical, service
and maintenance workers at Stanford.
Kim Scipes, labor consultant to
USW, said the union was pleased with
the decision. "We're delighted that
the NLRB has ruled in our favor." he
said.
"It shows that when a relatively im
partial body looks as the situation (it)
see(s) that Stanford is wrong."
Eggleston said Stanford now has
little legal justification for its position.
"They can either stop their illegal be-

havior and start bargaining with us or
they will be prosecuted," he said.
According to Eggleston, if Stanford
did not immediately recognize Local
680, the NLRB would prosecute Stan
ford on behalf of USW in a hearing
before an administrative law judge.
The case would come up in a hearing
in about six months, but the NLRB
may expedite the proceedings.
Eggleston said USW is the largest
bargaining unit in the NLRB's 32nd

district and the regional director is
paying close attention to USW's case
because it could have important impli
cations nationally. "The investigation
took over a month to complete, in
volving many witnesses and hundreds
of documents," he said. "It was very
comprehensive."
He added that either USW or the
NLRB could file for an injunction
forcing Stanford 10 recognize Local
680 in federal court. He said USWs
next move would depend on the
response the University chooses.
Eggleston said he hoped Stanford
would end its "stalling," recognize

Local 680 and begin bargaining with
the union in good faith before
University-labor relations became ir
reparable.
"In the process of taking this road,
they (University officials) are poison
ing the atmosphere," he said.
Presidential candidate Jesse Jack
son also came out in support of USW
at a campaign rally yesterday after
noon in East Palo Alto.
