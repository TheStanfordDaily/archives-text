# Cardinal sails to Chicago for title

### JASON COLE Daily staff 
While the rest of campus
takes exams inside, the Stan
ford men's and women's
sailing teams will head to the
shores of Lake Michigan and
the Chicago Yacht Club next
week for their own kind of
finals.
The Cardinal will open the
competition Monday in the
Intercollegiate Yacht Racing
Association Women's Na
tional Championship and
then begin the following
Monday in the Association's
Team Racing National
Championship.
The women's team will be
Stanford's best title hope.
They are the No. 1 seed and

have been in the top spot all
season. The team is a diverse
mix of youth, experience and
raw talent.
The squad is led by seniors
Carolyn Brown and
Elizabeth Edmonds in the
first boat. Brown, the team
captain, has led the Cardinal
to three straight appearances
in the championship along
with Edmonds.
But strength may not be in
the veterans. The second
team of freshman Jenny
Swett and sophomore Rona
Sisson may lack the experi
ence, but not the talent, as
Swett was named the
Yachtswoman of the Year by
Yacht Racing/Cruising mag
azine.

Head Coach Joe Petrucci
is confident of the team's
chances. "We've got a good
shot at winning unless the
winds are heavy." The gus
ting winds off Lake Michigan
could cause a problem and
allow one of the other
favored schools (Navy, Tufts,
Boston University or Brown)
to take the title.
Stanford will make its first
appearance in the Team
Racing Championship with
what Petrucci calls a "young
squad."
In the first boat will be
sophomores Rich Bergsund
and Marika Fussganger. The
second boat will feature
freshman Doug Hagan and

sophomore Alvina Obrien,
and the third boat will be
composed of freshman Tom
Kuhnle and sophomore Liz
Egan.
The Cardinal's chances
will depend on how it reacts
to the championship pres
sure. "If we perform like we
can, we'll end up around the
top. But we could end up in
the middle if we lose our
composure," Petrucci said.
The team competition
resembles the women's side
very much with Tufts, Bos
ton University and Navy,
along with Kingspoint
Academy, making up the top
of the 13-team field.
