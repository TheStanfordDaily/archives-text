the United States Tennis Asso
ciation Olympic Trials yesterday
in New York by recording
second-round wins. Derrick
Rostagno, John Letts and Jim
Grabb in the men's tournament
and Patty Fendick in the wo
men's competition have all ad
vanced to the round of eight.
Grabb. the No. 7 seed in the
tournament, advanced with a 6-
4, 7-5 win over unseeded Jeff
Hersh of Rockville, Md. The
sophomore from Tucson, Ariz.,
will face another unseeded
player, Kelly Jones of San
Diego, today. Jones stayed alive
in the tournament by upsetting
No. 2 seed Rich Leach of
Laguna Beach and USC, 6-3, 6-
I, in yesterday's second round.
Rostagno moved on with a 6-
4. 6-2 upset of No. 8 seed Steve
DeVries of Sansun and UC-
Berkeley. The freshman, who
hails from Rancho Palos
Verdes, will next face Richard
Matuszewski. who moved into
the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-4
win over Mike Wolf of Still well,
Kans. Matuszewski had earlier
pulled the biggest upset of the
tournament, knocking off No. 1
seed Lawson Duncan of Ash
ville, N.C., 6-1, 7-6, in Wednes

day's first round.
Letts rolled into the quarter
finals by blasting No. 6 seed
Bobby Blair of Orlando, Fla., 6-
1, 6-0. The sophomore from

It is conceivable that all four
Cardinals could make the team.
Should they win today, Ros
tagno and Letts would face each
other in a semifinal match, the
winner securing a spot on the
team. The loser, however, could
also gain the final spot by win
ning the consolation match and
finishing third. Grabb would
face neither until the finals,
should they advance that far.
