Henry's
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680
Henry's is an unobtrusive ele
ment of University Avenue, but
it you seek a good meal at a
moderate priee in a lively, but
mature, atmosphere, it is a res
taurant worth \ isiting.
When my 112 riend and I entered
the restaurant. 1 thought we
would be eating dinner in a
eocktail-lounge atmosphere. An
energetic, cackling, "Yuppie"-
type crowd jammed the small
tables lining the wall opposite
the bar.
My slightly more perceptive
friend, however, kept walking,
and led us back through the
lounge area to a small cove
where we waited to be seated.
We never did escape the
vigorous atmosphere or the dis
tinctive patrons, though.
The atmosphere, like the
food, was enjoyable. The dining
room is a small room, parallel to
a quiet alley, but the high
ceilings and the pleasant din of
conversation keep its size from
seeming even slightly con
strictive. We sat near a window,
slightly ajar, which admitted a
cool evening breeze.
Once seated, our waitress,
politely attentive throughout
the evening, was immediately
available for questions and to
take our order.
The menu the waitress be

stows only covers about halt the
choices available to the diner,
and we chose our appeti/ers
oysters on the half-shell ($4.75)
and deep-fried Brie with apples
($3.50) — from one of the three
blackboards on the walls.
The oysters were slippery (as
oysters will be) but fresh, and
we enjoyed them. The deep
fried Brie was a new experience
for me. and really not that excit
ing. Our waitreess served a
quarter-circle of deep-fried Brie
surrounded by thinly sliced
apples. Brie is very strong
cheese, and eating apples with
deep-fried Brie is not much dif
ferent from eating deep-tried
Brie, which is not much differ
ent from just plain Brie. So Brie
lovers are the ones who should
keep this dish in mind.
Next, we opted for gazpacho
— a spicy Mexican soup of
chopped tomatoes and other
salad ingredients served chilled
— rather than the conventional
salad. It was another first expe
rience. and I found the sensa
tion of cold soup followed im
mediately by heat from the
spices enervating to the palate.
We finally reached dinner —
again chosen from the black
board. We ordered red snapper
dijonaise ($10.25) and seafood
quenelles with Cajun sauce
($9.75). The "dijonaise"tui tied
out to mean that it was prepared
with spicy Dijon mustard, and
the combination was delicious.
Describing seafood quenelles is

;i hit more difficult, and. though
still good, it did not quite
match up to the snapper.
Seafood quenelles is a
poached puree of salmon, scal
lops and red snapper "with a
little cream and sometimes an
egg yoke or two." according to
the chef at Henry's. The result is
served in five or six small,
rounded hills with Cajun sauce
a light gravy made with
crayfish. The product was tasty,
hut the sauce and the salmon
overpowered the other in
gredients.
The dinner options — both
from the menu and the black
boards — were biased toward
seafood —stuffed rainbow trout
($9.75). filet of sole meuniere
($10.95) and shrimp salad
($5.25) — but also included
were veal picatta ($12.50), top
sirloin steak ($1 1.50). and even
Henry's dinner burger ($6.95).
The decor is decidedly rustic,
though not to the point of being
overbearing. Old photographs
and framed posters broke up the
space on the walls and meshed
well with the brass-backed
benches at the tables along the
wall. A simple, aged, white tile
floor and a small, rusty pump
head on the wide windowsill at
our elbows completed the ef
fect.
Good food: casual, friendly
setting; Yuppies— Henry's.
