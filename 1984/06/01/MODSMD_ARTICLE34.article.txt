Notorious (1946)
Kresge Auditorium
The most romantic of Alfred
Hitchcock's pictures. When her
father turns out to be a fascist,
Ingrid Bergman feels she must
clear her name by working to
trap another fascist — her hus
band (Claude Rains). (The plot
has a number of similarities to
Orson Welles' The Stranger,
released the same year.)
Bergman looks ravishing, and
her scenes with Cary Grant, as
the agent she is allied with, are
among the few genuine exam
ples of eroticism in American
films of this puritanical decade.
Ben Hecht wrote the screenplay.
Classic sequences: the wine cel
lar scene and the famous full
screen shot of Bergman's ring.
Plays tonight at 9.
Aparajito (1956)
Terman Auditorium
The title means "the unvan
quished," which might be a fit
ting name for any of Satyajit
Ray's movies. In this second part
of Ray's Apu Trilogy, Apu
(played first by Smaran Ghosal
and then by Pinaki Sen Gupta, a
teenager with lazily beautiful
eyes), whose father dies early in
the picture, must decide between
taking up his vocation as a priest,
which would please his mother,
and going to university in Cal
cutta. As Ray describes it, this
conflict represents the central
tension between the old India
and the new — and the struggles
between the adolescent, intellec
tually eager Apu and his mother
(wonderfully played by Karuna
Banerjee), who doesn't want
him to grow up, transcend the
boundaries of time and place.
Plays tonight at 7:30.
The Graduate (1967)
Memorial Auditorium
Mike Nichols' satirical com
edy made an immediate connec
tion with young audiences, and it
has never lost it, even though the
broad revue style is dated now
and the jangling editing and Nic
hols' insistent use of close-ups
were always an aesthetic assault.
The major drawback to the
Calder Willingham-Buck Henry
screenplay — the one-sided, un
subtle attack on the bourgeois
values of the older generation —
is, ironically, probably what
keeps it popular. On the other
hand, some of the dialogue has
stayed remarkably fresh, and
there are three highly commen
dable performances: a full-scale
one by Anne Bancroft as embit
tered, overpoweringly seductive
Mrs. Robinson, an imaginative
comic one by Dustin Hoffman as
the confused hero, Benj;r~iii»
Braddock, and a small, generally

ignored one by Katharine Ross
as Bancroft's daughter, Elaine,
whom Benjamin courts. Less im
pressive work is done by Murray
Hamilton as Mr. Robinson,
William Daniels as Mr. Brad
dock and Elizabeth Wilson as
Mrs. Braddock. (No wonder the
older generation gets roasted in
this picture, represented as it is
by three of the least attractive,
least believable actors in the
business.) Richard Dreyfuss
shows up in a bit at the rooming
house (run by Norman Fell).
The songs, for anyone who has
resided in a cave for the last 17
years, are by Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.

Fahrenheit 451 (1966)
Cubberley Auditorium
Ray Bradbury's high school
class symbolic novel about book
lovers and book burners in a fas
cist society apparently didn't in
spire Francois Truffaut: This is
one of his two or three most un
impassioned movies. (He and
Jean-Louis Richard did the
adaptation.) Oskar Werner plays
the fireman (i.e., firestarter)

wooed by Julie Christie (in one
of her two roles) into joining the
underground movement to save
the endangered books. (Radicals
"save" them by walking around
reciting them. It's really a very
silly idea.) Photographed by
Nicolas Roeg, with music by
Bernard Herrmann.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.

It's a Wonderful Life (1946)
Festival, Palo Alto
James Stewart plays a small
town joe who has spent years
putting other people's interests
before his own; when his life
begins to fall apart and he con
templates suicide, an angel
(Henry Travers) shows him what
life would have been like for
those closest to him had he never
existed. This comedy-drama is
the most eloquent expression of
the populist philosophy Frank
Capra infused his films with. It's
superbly crafted, and two or
three scenes are too powerful to
shake off — Capra could be an
amazing director, and he knew
exactly what he was doing here.
But his vision is so fraudulent
that your tears may freeze into
outrage when you consider the
effect of the movie. Much of the
film's success as a piece of
manipulation is due to Stewart,
whose earnestness has never
been affecting in quite this way
before; his intensity is frighten
ing — in the scene in which he

cries out to his girl. Donna Reed
(who is very good), that he feels
trapped in the town, you can
really see the potential for ner
vous collapse and suicide. The
supporting cast includes the un
convincing Lionel Barrymore,
Thomas Mitchell. Beulah Bondi,
Frank Faylen. Ward Bond,
Gloria Grahame, H.B.Warner
and Frank Albertson. Capra
worked on the script with
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett, and Joseph Walker and
Joseph Biroc collaborated on the
(fine) cinematography.
Plays through Wednesday
with Topper Returns.
Jules and Jim (1962)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's film about
the evanescence of love, of
dreams, of innocence; often the
tone is playful, as in Godard's
later Band of Outsiders, which
also spins around the games
shared by two men and a wo
man. but this is a much richer
movie — it has the substance of
a long novel, and its lyricism and
esprit mask a tragedy. Truffaut
and Jean Gruault based the
picture on an autobiographical
novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, a
minor figure from the Paris of
the '20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a
legendary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a woman,
together with all the qualities
one expects in a man, with none

of the inconveniences of either."
The film is a masterpiece — and
likely the best movie released in
the '60s (with the possible ex
ception of L'Avventura).
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Fanny and Alexander.
Under Fire (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In Nicaragua in 1979, where
the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full apprecia
tion of its implications.
Plays today with The Year of
Living Dangerously.
On Ciolden Pond (1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The two central characters in
Ernest Thompson's play, filmed
by Mark Rydell, are Norman
Thayer, Jr. (Henry Fonda), a
retired professor approaching
his 80th birthday, and his wife
Ethel (Katharine Hepburn),
who is 10 years his junior. He is
ornery and foxy; she is affec
tionate and sage. The movie
takes place at their country
cottage, where they are visited
by their daughter Chelsea (Jane
Fonda), who is still smarting
from a series of childhood con
flicts with her father, though of
course they are reconciled by the
end of the picture, when she
does a symbolic back Hip into
the lake for him and he ap
plauds. The script is a shameless
compendium of all the heart
tugging devices that can be
crammed into two hours, but
Mark Rydell can be as slick as a
snake oil salesman, and the pres
ence of the two aging stars, as
well as the once-in-a-lifetime
casting of Henry and Jane Fonda
as father and daughter, gets
audiences cheering.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Terms of Endearment.

the most eloquent expression of
the populist philosophy Frank

superbly crafted, and two or
three scenes are too powerful to
shake off — Capra could be an
amazing director, and he knew
exactly what he was doing here.
But his vision is so fraudulent
that your tears may freeze into
outrage when you consider the
effect of the movie. Much of the
film's success as a piece of
manipulation is due to Stewart,
whose earnestness has never
been affecting in quite this way

cries out to his girl. Donna Reed
(who is very good), that he feels
trapped in the town, you can
really see the potential for ner

supporting cast includes the un
convincing Lionel Barrymore,
Thomas Mitchell. Beulah Bondi,

Gloria Grahame, H.B.Warner
and Frank Albertson. Capra
worked on the script with
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett, and Joseph Walker and
Joseph Biroc collaborated on the
(fine) cinematography.
Plays through Wednesday
with Topper Returns.
Jules and Jim (1962)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's film about
the evanescence of love, of
dreams, of innocence; often the
tone is playful, as in Godard's
later Band of Outsiders, which
also spins around the games
shared by two men and a wo
man. but this is a much richer
movie — it has the substance of
a long novel, and its lyricism and
esprit mask a tragedy. Truffaut
and Jean Gruault based the
picture on an autobiographical
novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, a
minor figure from the Paris of
the '20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a
legendary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a woman,
together with all the qualities
one expects in a man, with none

of the inconveniences of either."
The film is a masterpiece — and
likely the best movie released in
the '60s (with the possible ex
ception of L'Avventura).
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Fanny and Alexander.
Under Fire (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In Nicaragua in 1979, where
the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full apprecia
tion of its implications.
Plays today with The Year of
Living Dangerously.
On Ciolden Pond (1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The two central characters in
Ernest Thompson's play, filmed
by Mark Rydell, are Norman
Thayer, Jr. (Henry Fonda), a
retired professor approaching
his 80th birthday, and his wife
Ethel (Katharine Hepburn),
who is 10 years his junior. He is
ornery and foxy; she is affec
tionate and sage. The movie
takes place at their country
cottage, where they are visited
by their daughter Chelsea (Jane
Fonda), who is still smarting
from a series of childhood con
flicts with her father, though of
course they are reconciled by the
end of the picture, when she
does a symbolic back Hip into
the lake for him and he ap
plauds. The script is a shameless
compendium of all the heart
tugging devices that can be
crammed into two hours, but
Mark Rydell can be as slick as a
snake oil salesman, and the pres
ence of the two aging stars, as
well as the once-in-a-lifetime
casting of Henry and Jane Fonda
as father and daughter, gets
audiences cheering.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Terms of Endearment.

Notorious (1946)
Kresge Auditorium
The most romantic of Alfred
Hitchcock's pictures. When her
father turns out to be a fascist,
Ingrid Bergman feels she must
clear her name by working to
trap another fascist — her hus
band (Claude Rains). (The plot
has a number of similarities to
Orson Welles' The Stranger,
released the same year.)
Bergman looks ravishing, and
her scenes with Cary Grant, as
the agent she is allied with, are
among the few genuine exam
ples of eroticism in American
films of this puritanical decade.
Ben Hecht wrote the screenplay.
Classic sequences: the wine cel
lar scene and the famous full
screen shot of Bergman's ring.
Plays tonight at 9.
Aparajito (1956)
Terman Auditorium
The title means "the unvan
quished," which might be a fit
ting name for any of Satyajit
Ray's movies. In this second part
of Ray's Apu Trilogy, Apu
(played first by Smaran Ghosal
and then by Pinaki Sen Gupta, a
teenager with lazily beautiful
eyes), whose father dies early in
the picture, must decide between
taking up his vocation as a priest,
which would please his mother,
and going to university in Cal
cutta. As Ray describes it, this
conflict represents the central
tension between the old India
and the new — and the struggles
between the adolescent, intellec
tually eager Apu and his mother
(wonderfully played by Karuna
Banerjee), who doesn't want
him to grow up, transcend the
boundaries of time and place.
Plays tonight at 7:30.
The Graduate (1967)
Memorial Auditorium
Mike Nichols' satirical com
edy made an immediate connec
tion with young audiences, and it
has never lost it, even though the
broad revue style is dated now
and the jangling editing and Nic
hols' insistent use of close-ups
were always an aesthetic assault.
The major drawback to the
Calder Willingham-Buck Henry
screenplay — the one-sided, un
subtle attack on the bourgeois
values of the older generation —
is, ironically, probably what
keeps it popular. On the other
hand, some of the dialogue has
stayed remarkably fresh, and
there are three highly commen
dable performances: a full-scale
one by Anne Bancroft as embit
tered, overpoweringly seductive
Mrs. Robinson, an imaginative
comic one by Dustin Hoffman as
the confused hero, Benj;r~iii»
Braddock, and a small, generally

ignored one by Katharine Ross
as Bancroft's daughter, Elaine,
whom Benjamin courts. Less im
pressive work is done by Murray
Hamilton as Mr. Robinson,
William Daniels as Mr. Brad
dock and Elizabeth Wilson as
Mrs. Braddock. (No wonder the
older generation gets roasted in
this picture, represented as it is
by three of the least attractive,
least believable actors in the
business.) Richard Dreyfuss
shows up in a bit at the rooming
house (run by Norman Fell).
The songs, for anyone who has
resided in a cave for the last 17
years, are by Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.

one of his two or three most un

Jean-Louis Richard did the
adaptation.) Oskar Werner plays
the fireman (i.e., firestarter)

wooed by Julie Christie (in one
of her two roles) into joining the

James Stewart plays a small
