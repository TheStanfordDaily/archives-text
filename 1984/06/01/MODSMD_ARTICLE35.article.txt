The first recipients ot the Stanford
public service fellowship awards were
announced by University President
Donald Kennedy yesterday afternoon.
Fourteen students selected from
what Kennedy called an
"extraordinary" pool of more than 70
applicants received monetary grants to
pursue a wide variety ot public serv ice
programs this summer.
Catherine Milton, coordinator of
the program, said Kennedy's call for
greater emphasis on public sen ice and
enthusiasm generated by the February
"You Can Make a Difference"
entrepreneur conference here helped
spawn the awards.
The students' programs, which are
self-designed, range from teaching
basic math to East Palo Alto students
and researching and publicizing pes
ticide use in the Third World, to
working with cancer patients in India
and counseling children of battered
wives in Houston. Texas.
Kennedy praised the reward
recipcnts, saying their efforts would
help dispel "a popular contemporary
myth of student apathy with regard to
public service."
The fellowships, which range up to

$1200. were instrumental in making
most of the projects possible. Senior
Rudy Rodriguez, who will be working
with HI SaKadoran children suffering
from a syndrome related to the psy
chological effects of violence at the
USC Medical Center in I.os Angeles,
said. "The grant makes my project
possible; without it. living in 1..A.
would be too expensive."
Junior Emily Ghilarducci agreed
with Rodriguez. "The fellowship ad
vertisement came just as I was realiz
ing I couldn't afford my summer
plans." she said.
Ghilarducci will work with native
Alaskans, exploring the population's
high rate of sudden Infant Death

quate prbnatal care.
