# The 						1984 Photography Contest
## 
### 
The Ninth Annual Stanford Daily Photography Contest
featured well over 100 entries this year. A new category,
"Humor," was added in an attempt to reach another seg
ment of photographs which we did not want to ignore.
At least three prints were selected from each category,
and the judges chose honorable mentions when they felt it
was appropriate.
This year's judges were Joe Melena, senior photog
rapher at the Peninsula Times-Tribune and Chuck Painter,
chief photographer at Stanford News and Publications.
Each print is labeled with the specific information about
the picture, and the top three winners have comments from
the judges which explain the judges' feelings about those
photos.
