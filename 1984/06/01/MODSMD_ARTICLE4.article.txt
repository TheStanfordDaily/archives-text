In Hollywood's cliched portrayal of what a
typical groups of 1960s radicals has become
today, the public defender is a corporate lawyer,
the crusading journalist works for People maga
zine and the only true visionary has killed him
self .
lint does reality reflect The Big Chill s
scenario? Are all the former radical idealists now
successful microcomputer entrepreneurs and fit
ness salon owners? Have all the anti-war
protesters really gone from the barricades to the
board room?
On the contrary, a survey of student leaders at
Stanford in the 1960s shows that "former" ac
ti\ ists are generally just as committed to progres
sive politics as they were 15 years ago. The focus
of their activities may have shifted, and their tac
tics may be different, but in general former Stan
ford radicals are still sincerely dedicated to their
activist ideals.
Lenny Siegel. once a leader in the Stanford
chapter of the national Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and Stanford's own April Third
Movement auamst military research, said he

thinks most of the activists of his generation have
retained their progressive attitudes.
"A handful have renounced their views." he
said. "But generally, although their positions in
life have changed, they're supporting social
change in some way."
Siegel himself is a good example of a former
student radical attempting to pursue his social
ideals in his professional life. As the administra
tor of the Pacific Studies Center in Mountain
View. Siegel helps maintain a comprehensive li
brary with materials "of broad interest to ac
tivists." Besides working for the Center, which
grew out of the April Third Movement, Siegel
has been involved both in the nuclear freeze
movement and in local campaigns for rent con
trol and against condominium conversion. He
also serves as a research coordinator for the con
gressional campaign of Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy. a progressive candidate seeking to
replace Rep. Ed /schau (R-Sunnyvale).
Jeanne Friedman, one of Siegel's contem
poraries in SDS here, is also still working to
translate her social goals into public policy. After
teaching college for several years. Friedman cur
rently works for a policy and advocacy organiza-

15 years after the 'revolution,'
Stanford '60s activists look back

tion striving to attain civil rights for the disabled.
Friedman maintains that her radical attitudes and
goals have not changed since her Stanford days.
"The U.S. has not done things in the last 10 years
to show that I was wrong." she said.
Omowale Satterwhite, now a city councilman
in East Palo Alto, was active in the Black Student
Union here in the late 19605. Satterwhite cur
rently runs the Institute for the Study of Commu
nity Economic Development in East Palo Alto,
which assists "almost essentially black" nonprofit
organizations in becoming more effective in car
rying out their services.
Satterwhite said he dislikes labels, but admits
that he has been "characterized in some circles as
a black nationalist," both now and in the'6os. He
believes that his present community organizing
work, including his fight to incorporate East Palo
Alto, has grown out of his activities in the 19605.
"I see what I do today as a practical extension
of what I was doing then," he said.
