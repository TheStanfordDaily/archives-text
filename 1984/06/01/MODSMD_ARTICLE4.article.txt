In Hollywood's cliched portrayal of what a
typical groups of 1960s radicals has become
today, the public defender is a corporate lawyer,
the crusading journalist works for People maga
zine and the only true visionary has killed him
self .
lint does reality reflect The Big Chill s
scenario? Are all the former radical idealists now
successful microcomputer entrepreneurs and fit
ness salon owners? Have all the anti-war
protesters really gone from the barricades to the
board room?
On the contrary, a survey of student leaders at
Stanford in the 1960s shows that "former" ac
ti\ ists are generally just as committed to progres
sive politics as they were 15 years ago. The focus
of their activities may have shifted, and their tac
tics may be different, but in general former Stan
ford radicals are still sincerely dedicated to their
activist ideals.
Lenny Siegel. once a leader in the Stanford
chapter of the national Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and Stanford's own April Third
Movement auamst military research, said he

thinks most of the activists of his generation have
retained their progressive attitudes.
"A handful have renounced their views." he
said. "But generally, although their positions in
life have changed, they're supporting social
change in some way."
Siegel himself is a good example of a former
student radical attempting to pursue his social
ideals in his professional life. As the administra
tor of the Pacific Studies Center in Mountain
View. Siegel helps maintain a comprehensive li
brary with materials "of broad interest to ac
tivists." Besides working for the Center, which
grew out of the April Third Movement, Siegel
has been involved both in the nuclear freeze
movement and in local campaigns for rent con
trol and against condominium conversion. He
also serves as a research coordinator for the con
gressional campaign of Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy. a progressive candidate seeking to
replace Rep. Ed /schau (R-Sunnyvale).
Jeanne Friedman, one of Siegel's contem
poraries in SDS here, is also still working to
translate her social goals into public policy. After
teaching college for several years. Friedman cur
rently works for a policy and advocacy organiza-

15 years after the 'revolution,'
Stanford '60s activists look back

tion striving to attain civil rights for the disabled.
Friedman maintains that her radical attitudes and
goals have not changed since her Stanford days.
"The U.S. has not done things in the last 10 years
to show that I was wrong." she said.
Omowale Satterwhite, now a city councilman
in East Palo Alto, was active in the Black Student
Union here in the late 19605. Satterwhite cur
rently runs the Institute for the Study of Commu
nity Economic Development in East Palo Alto,
which assists "almost essentially black" nonprofit
organizations in becoming more effective in car
rying out their services.
Satterwhite said he dislikes labels, but admits
that he has been "characterized in some circles as
a black nationalist," both now and in the'6os. He
believes that his present community organizing
work, including his fight to incorporate East Palo
Alto, has grown out of his activities in the 19605.
"I see what I do today as a practical extension
of what I was doing then," he said.

... progressive political causes. Hayes was not
associated with the "revolutionaries" at Stan
ford in the late 60s, and was in fact frequently
caught between SDS and the University ad
ministration.
That s the traditional political position,"
he laughtd. It you re making everybody
angry, maybe you re doing something right."
But I layes is as much a product of his era as
the most militant members of SDS. Attracting
attention as one of the two Board of Trustees
members to vote against the firing of radical
Prof. Bruce Franklin in the early 19705,
Hayes has moved on to lobby tor environmen
talist and solar energy legislation in Washing
ton. In addition to serv ing as chairman of the
50,000-member Solar Lobby, Hayes was an
organizer of the national Earth Day and Sun
Day. Now a law student and a consulting pro
fessor of engineering, Hayes was the director
ot the Solar Energy Research Institute until
he was tired by the Reagan administration.
Hayes joked that some observers may think
that his views should have changed over the
last 15 years. "Maybe I don't have the
capacity for growth," he said. "I'd like to
think that I was perceptive from the start."
Not all former Stanford radicals have
married their progressive ideals to their pro
fessional lives like Siegel, Satterwhite, Fried
man and Hayes. But all of the activists inter
viewed said they have retained the fundamen
tal beliefs they developed in the 19605.
Political Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier,
one ol the leaders of the faculty anti-war
movement here in the 19605, said he is still
sympathetic to "any movement for social
justice." A supporter of the environmentalist
movement and of Carnoy's candidacy, Drek
meier has also helped teach a new peace
studies course here this year.
Drekmeier said lie has retained the funda
mental values that inspired his anti-war ac
tivism in the 19605. "There are moments
when you feel that if you don't speak out . . .
then you really can't go to sleep with a clear
conscience," he said.

One of Stanford's host-known radical
leaders, former ASSU President David Har
ris. attempted to enact his political and social
agenda hy running for Congress in ! 1 )76. But
now disgusted hy the public relations aspects
of the American electoral process — "ideas
have no place in political campaigns," he says
— Harris has decided to devote his time to his
successful journalistic career.

Interestingly enough, Harris — who was
convicted of draft resistance and sent to
prison, had his head shaved by fraternity
members who were vexed by his anti-Greek
attitudes and was once married to radical folk
singer Joan Baez — was the only former Stan
ford leader interviewed who said that his
views have changed much over the years.
"I think I know a lot more now; I should
hope so," he said. "I'd hate to think I'd
wasted all that goddamned time in between."
But Harris said that although his personal
beliefs and attitudes have evolved over the
years, he still supports many of the same is
sues — such as resistance to draft registration
— and feels "comfortable with the person I
was then."
"I don't think my ideas have changed so
much that there's some big break between me
and my past," he said.
Movement's accomplishments
But if their values, beliefs and goals are fun
damentally the same, then how do the former
radicals now view their activities in the 19605?
Do they feel that they achieved their goals?
Or. in retrospect, do they wish that they had
done things differently?
All of the former Stanford leaders agreed
that the movements in which they were in
volved were not completely successful in at
taining all of their stated goals, such as sever
ing the University's military and industrial
ties.
" I think the utility of what we did is an open
historical question," Harris said. "What we
did was very important and very useful. It cer
tainly was by no means 100 percent success
ful."
But nevertheless, all of the activists agreed
that the student movement at Stanford and
across the nation made some very concrete ac
complishments.
"Hell, there's not a Vietnamese war going
on now. That's nice, isn't it?" Harris said. "If
we hadn't done what we did, the first Marine
division would be in San Salvador right now."
In addition, the various movements made
important changes in American culture and

society as a whole, the activists claimed.
"We created an important historical prece
dent," Harris said, "changed some of the basic
terms upon which politics operated in this
country and made an enormous alteration in
the day-to-day operation of the culture wc
lived in."
In addition, several important changes were
made at Stanford itself. Friedman cited the

University's adoption of Affirmative Action
programs, the establishment of SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops on Political and Social
Issues) and the severing of the link between
the University and the Stanford Research In
stitute as concrete results of the student move
ment.
Even though the student radicals had
wanted SRI more tightly controlled by Stan
ford, Friedman said, the protest movement
did manage to force the University to confront
its role in military research.
Hayes also cited the University's changed
attitude on military research as one of the
most important accomplishments of the stu
dent movement here. When he was opposed
to classified research in the I 9605, Hayes said,
his ideas were considered extremely radical at
the time. Now the belief that classified re
search is incompatible with the role of the
University is "well beyond the pale of conven
tional wisdom." he said.
The black student movement on campus
also attained several of its goals, Satterwhite
said. However, the community activist feels
that in retrospect, those goals were too lim
ited. "I think we probably asked for . . . about
5 percent of what we should've asked for." he
said.
After the shooting of Martin Luther King.
Jr., the Black Student Union presented 10
demands to the University, requesting
changes in housing, curriculum, admission and
financial aid policies for black students. Al
though these demands were significant for
their time, Satterwhite said, "in retrospect,
they were very meager."
Instead, the students should have asked for
structural changes "to institutionalize what we
perceived as the needs of black students," he
said.
Nevertheless, the movement did attain most
of its stated goals, he said. "Just about every
thing you see on the campus with a black iden
tification now came out of that movement,"
he said.
Student apathy
All of these activists were present at Stan
ford when the campus witnessed frequent
rallies in White Plaza, window-breakings at
Hoover, sit-ins at the President's Office and
mass anti-war marches down El Camino. But
why. in their opinion, are students today so in
active?
Most of the former radicals interviewed
denied the prevalent assumption that students
today are much more apathetic than their
counterparts in the 19605. Many observers
made sweeping generalizations about student
lethargy even during the heyday of student ac
tivism, Siegel said.
"Every year during the '60s and early '705,"
he said, "somebody would come out with a
paper about how students are no longer ac
tive.
"But the fact is that most of the time, most
of the students were apathetic," he continued.
"It's only because of what was going on in the
world that things happened as they did."
Harris agreed that the extent of present stu
dent apathy is often exaggerated. Many
people romanticize the activity in the '60s and
forget that the student and anti-war move
ments were actually led by determined
minorities, he said.
For example, Harris noted that the govern
ment's estimate of three-quarters of a million
Selective Service Act violators today is much
higher than the number of draft resisters
during the Vietnam War.
"Good God, when we started organizing
draft resistance, you could put all of us in a
room — a small room," he said.
The fact that the level of registration non
compliance is so high is especially noteworthy

considering that students today don't have the
same pressing issues confronting them that
their counterparts did 15 years ago, Harris
said. "When 1 was a student, every day people
our age would be hauled home in plastic bags,
and we were all subject to the draft, he said.
"That created an immediacy to a lot of the is
sues that you don't have today."
Drekmeier speculated that the admissions
policies of the universities today also might
contribute to the present perception ot stu
dent apathy. Students who could have been
admitted to Stanford in earlier years because
of their exceptional extracurricular activities
— for example, editing radical journals —
might now be rejected because the University
doubts that they can "master the kinds of
techniques that a computerized world will re
quire," Drekmeier said.
As a result, the students at Stanford today
are less interested in philosophy than their
1960s counterparts, he said. As a professor ot
ancient Greek philosophy, Drekmeier found

it a "much different teaching experience" in
the 1960s to instruct students "who have dis
covered that their moral integrity and the laws
of the country are not in congruence, and who
may be preparing to commit acts of civil dis
obedience.
"Now you wonder just how what you're
teaching is going to be used," he continued.
" It becomes sort of ornamental."
Most of the former Stanford activists
predicted that students might become even
more active than they were in the 1960s if an
emotionally charged issue — such as U.S. in
tervention in Central America — galvanizes
the public.
"1 think if the U.S. were to send troops into
El Salvador or Nicaragua today," Siege/ said,
"you would not only see the same kind of ac
tivism. you'd see much broader support and
linkage with the community, because there's
plenty of people around who went through it
before."
Rational politics
Even though their basic views have stayed
the same, however, one might wonder if there
is a fundamental contradiction between the
activists' present and former activities. Isn't
there an essential difference between David
Harris who went to jail for draft resistance,
and David Harris the successful journalist?
Isn't there a key distinction between Lenny
Siegel who received a summons from the Uni
versitv every time there was a demonstration,

and Lenny Siegel the researcher?
Even though the former activist leaders
here are still working for progressive political
changes, isn't there a difference between oc
cupying the Applied Electronics Laboratory
and lobbying for rent-control legislation?
Not as far as the former Stanford activists
interviewed are concerned. Rather than
seeing their present "within-the-system" poli
tical activities as a form of selling out. the
radicals feel that they're merely adopting the
most practical means of achieving their goals
in the present political and social setting.
"I'm not working in a Chicano community
and I'm not working at IBM," Satterwhite
said. "But I'm not spending my time figuring
out how we can get some land somewhere and
set up our own nation, either. That's a vision
rather than a working objective."
In addition to recognizing the difference be
tween short- and long-term objectives, the
former activists said, being politically effective
in the country today means using tactics ap-

propriate for the current political environ
ment. And, they say, just because they're
adopting practical methods does not mean
they're abandoning their ideals.
"A rational political approach requires that
you be prepared to act on different levels —
from signing petitions to blocking a troop
train," Siegel said. "If I'm not being drafted, I
can't refuse the draft. If they aren't drafting
people, then I can't block an induction cen
ter."
In addition, Harris pointed out that activists
today are not confronted with the intense,
personal, life-or-death issues that radicalized
so many in the '60s.
"1 don't have the personal obsession for
various issues that I had then," Harris said. "J
dropped everything and ended up becoming a
convicted felon because of the war in Viet
nam. There's nothing today that gives me the
urge to go out and become a convicted felon
again."
But that doesn't mean the former Stanford
activist leaders believe that the goals they
sought or the tactics they used in the '60s were
wrong. Instead, they say it just means they
have pragmatically recognized that the tactics
that served radicals well in the '60s will not
work 15 years later —or two years or 30 years
later.
"I'm not a person who believes in repeating
historical epochs," Harris said. "I'm not sit
ting around waiting for the '60s to happen
again. The '60s happened, and it was good
that they happened, and they're over."

"A rational political approach requires that
you be prepared to act on different levels —
from signing petitions to blocking a troop
train," Siegel said. "If I'm not being drafted, I
can't refuse the draft. If they aren't drafting
people, then I can't block an induction cen
ter."
In addition, Harris pointed out that activists
today are not confronted with the intense,
personal, life-or-death issues that radicalized
so many in the '60s.
"1 don't have the personal obsession for
various issues that I had then," Harris said. "J
dropped everything and ended up becoming a
convicted felon because of the war in Viet
nam. There's nothing today that gives me the
urge to go out and become a convicted felon
again."
But that doesn't mean the former Stanford
activist leaders believe that the goals they
sought or the tactics they used in the '60s were
wrong. Instead, they say it just means they
have pragmatically recognized that the tactics
that served radicals well in the '60s will not
work 15 years later —or two years or 30 years
later.
"I'm not a person who believes in repeating
historical epochs," Harris said. "I'm not sit
ting around waiting for the '60s to happen
again. The '60s happened, and it was good
that they happened, and they're over."

In Hollywood's cliched portrayal of what a
typical groups of 1960s radicals has become
today, the public defender is a corporate lawyer,
the crusading journalist works for People maga
zine and the only true visionary has killed him
self .
lint does reality reflect The Big Chill s
scenario? Are all the former radical idealists now
successful microcomputer entrepreneurs and fit
ness salon owners? Have all the anti-war
protesters really gone from the barricades to the
board room?
On the contrary, a survey of student leaders at
Stanford in the 1960s shows that "former" ac
ti\ ists are generally just as committed to progres
sive politics as they were 15 years ago. The focus
of their activities may have shifted, and their tac
tics may be different, but in general former Stan
ford radicals are still sincerely dedicated to their
activist ideals.
Lenny Siegel. once a leader in the Stanford
chapter of the national Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and Stanford's own April Third
Movement auamst military research, said he

thinks most of the activists of his generation have
retained their progressive attitudes.
"A handful have renounced their views." he
said. "But generally, although their positions in
life have changed, they're supporting social
change in some way."
Siegel himself is a good example of a former
student radical attempting to pursue his social
ideals in his professional life. As the administra
tor of the Pacific Studies Center in Mountain
View. Siegel helps maintain a comprehensive li
brary with materials "of broad interest to ac
tivists." Besides working for the Center, which
grew out of the April Third Movement, Siegel
has been involved both in the nuclear freeze
movement and in local campaigns for rent con
trol and against condominium conversion. He
also serves as a research coordinator for the con
gressional campaign of Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy. a progressive candidate seeking to
replace Rep. Ed /schau (R-Sunnyvale).
Jeanne Friedman, one of Siegel's contem
poraries in SDS here, is also still working to
translate her social goals into public policy. After
teaching college for several years. Friedman cur
rently works for a policy and advocacy organiza-

15 years after the 'revolution,'
Stanford '60s activists look back

tion striving to attain civil rights for the disabled.
Friedman maintains that her radical attitudes and
goals have not changed since her Stanford days.
"The U.S. has not done things in the last 10 years
to show that I was wrong." she said.
Omowale Satterwhite, now a city councilman
in East Palo Alto, was active in the Black Student
Union here in the late 19605. Satterwhite cur
rently runs the Institute for the Study of Commu
nity Economic Development in East Palo Alto,
which assists "almost essentially black" nonprofit
organizations in becoming more effective in car
rying out their services.
Satterwhite said he dislikes labels, but admits
that he has been "characterized in some circles as
a black nationalist," both now and in the'6os. He
believes that his present community organizing
work, including his fight to incorporate East Palo
Alto, has grown out of his activities in the 19605.
"I see what I do today as a practical extension
of what I was doing then," he said.

... progressive political causes. Hayes was not
associated with the "revolutionaries" at Stan
ford in the late 60s, and was in fact frequently
caught between SDS and the University ad
ministration.
That s the traditional political position,"
he laughtd. It you re making everybody
angry, maybe you re doing something right."
But I layes is as much a product of his era as
the most militant members of SDS. Attracting
attention as one of the two Board of Trustees
members to vote against the firing of radical
Prof. Bruce Franklin in the early 19705,
Hayes has moved on to lobby tor environmen
talist and solar energy legislation in Washing
ton. In addition to serv ing as chairman of the
50,000-member Solar Lobby, Hayes was an
organizer of the national Earth Day and Sun
Day. Now a law student and a consulting pro
fessor of engineering, Hayes was the director
ot the Solar Energy Research Institute until
he was tired by the Reagan administration.
Hayes joked that some observers may think
that his views should have changed over the
last 15 years. "Maybe I don't have the
capacity for growth," he said. "I'd like to
think that I was perceptive from the start."
Not all former Stanford radicals have
married their progressive ideals to their pro
fessional lives like Siegel, Satterwhite, Fried
man and Hayes. But all of the activists inter
viewed said they have retained the fundamen
tal beliefs they developed in the 19605.
Political Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier,
one ol the leaders of the faculty anti-war
movement here in the 19605, said he is still
sympathetic to "any movement for social
justice." A supporter of the environmentalist
movement and of Carnoy's candidacy, Drek
meier has also helped teach a new peace
studies course here this year.
Drekmeier said lie has retained the funda
mental values that inspired his anti-war ac
tivism in the 19605. "There are moments
when you feel that if you don't speak out . . .
then you really can't go to sleep with a clear
conscience," he said.

One of Stanford's host-known radical
leaders, former ASSU President David Har
ris. attempted to enact his political and social
agenda hy running for Congress in ! 1 )76. But
now disgusted hy the public relations aspects
of the American electoral process — "ideas
have no place in political campaigns," he says
— Harris has decided to devote his time to his
successful journalistic career.

Interestingly enough, Harris — who was
convicted of draft resistance and sent to
prison, had his head shaved by fraternity
members who were vexed by his anti-Greek
attitudes and was once married to radical folk
singer Joan Baez — was the only former Stan
ford leader interviewed who said that his
views have changed much over the years.
"I think I know a lot more now; I should
hope so," he said. "I'd hate to think I'd
wasted all that goddamned time in between."
But Harris said that although his personal
beliefs and attitudes have evolved over the
years, he still supports many of the same is
sues — such as resistance to draft registration
— and feels "comfortable with the person I
was then."
"I don't think my ideas have changed so
much that there's some big break between me
and my past," he said.
Movement's accomplishments
But if their values, beliefs and goals are fun
damentally the same, then how do the former
radicals now view their activities in the 19605?
Do they feel that they achieved their goals?
Or. in retrospect, do they wish that they had
done things differently?
All of the former Stanford leaders agreed
that the movements in which they were in
volved were not completely successful in at
taining all of their stated goals, such as sever
ing the University's military and industrial
ties.
" I think the utility of what we did is an open
historical question," Harris said. "What we
did was very important and very useful. It cer
tainly was by no means 100 percent success
ful."
But nevertheless, all of the activists agreed
that the student movement at Stanford and
across the nation made some very concrete ac
complishments.
"Hell, there's not a Vietnamese war going
on now. That's nice, isn't it?" Harris said. "If
we hadn't done what we did, the first Marine
division would be in San Salvador right now."
In addition, the various movements made
important changes in American culture and

society as a whole, the activists claimed.
"We created an important historical prece
dent," Harris said, "changed some of the basic
terms upon which politics operated in this
country and made an enormous alteration in
the day-to-day operation of the culture wc
lived in."
In addition, several important changes were
made at Stanford itself. Friedman cited the

University's adoption of Affirmative Action
programs, the establishment of SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops on Political and Social
Issues) and the severing of the link between
the University and the Stanford Research In
stitute as concrete results of the student move
ment.
Even though the student radicals had
wanted SRI more tightly controlled by Stan
ford, Friedman said, the protest movement
did manage to force the University to confront
its role in military research.
Hayes also cited the University's changed
attitude on military research as one of the
most important accomplishments of the stu
dent movement here. When he was opposed
to classified research in the I 9605, Hayes said,
his ideas were considered extremely radical at
the time. Now the belief that classified re
search is incompatible with the role of the
University is "well beyond the pale of conven
tional wisdom." he said.
The black student movement on campus
also attained several of its goals, Satterwhite
said. However, the community activist feels
that in retrospect, those goals were too lim
ited. "I think we probably asked for . . . about
5 percent of what we should've asked for." he
said.
After the shooting of Martin Luther King.
Jr., the Black Student Union presented 10
demands to the University, requesting
changes in housing, curriculum, admission and
financial aid policies for black students. Al
though these demands were significant for
their time, Satterwhite said, "in retrospect,
they were very meager."
Instead, the students should have asked for
structural changes "to institutionalize what we
perceived as the needs of black students," he
said.
Nevertheless, the movement did attain most
of its stated goals, he said. "Just about every
thing you see on the campus with a black iden
tification now came out of that movement,"
he said.
Student apathy
All of these activists were present at Stan
ford when the campus witnessed frequent
rallies in White Plaza, window-breakings at
Hoover, sit-ins at the President's Office and
mass anti-war marches down El Camino. But
why. in their opinion, are students today so in
active?
Most of the former radicals interviewed
denied the prevalent assumption that students
today are much more apathetic than their
counterparts in the 19605. Many observers
made sweeping generalizations about student
lethargy even during the heyday of student ac
tivism, Siegel said.
"Every year during the '60s and early '705,"
he said, "somebody would come out with a
paper about how students are no longer ac
tive.
"But the fact is that most of the time, most
of the students were apathetic," he continued.
"It's only because of what was going on in the
world that things happened as they did."
Harris agreed that the extent of present stu
dent apathy is often exaggerated. Many
people romanticize the activity in the '60s and
forget that the student and anti-war move
ments were actually led by determined
minorities, he said.
For example, Harris noted that the govern
ment's estimate of three-quarters of a million
Selective Service Act violators today is much
higher than the number of draft resisters
during the Vietnam War.
"Good God, when we started organizing
draft resistance, you could put all of us in a
room — a small room," he said.
The fact that the level of registration non
compliance is so high is especially noteworthy

considering that students today don't have the
same pressing issues confronting them that
their counterparts did 15 years ago, Harris
said. "When 1 was a student, every day people
our age would be hauled home in plastic bags,
and we were all subject to the draft, he said.
"That created an immediacy to a lot of the is
sues that you don't have today."
Drekmeier speculated that the admissions
policies of the universities today also might
contribute to the present perception ot stu
dent apathy. Students who could have been
admitted to Stanford in earlier years because
of their exceptional extracurricular activities
— for example, editing radical journals —
might now be rejected because the University
doubts that they can "master the kinds of
techniques that a computerized world will re
quire," Drekmeier said.
As a result, the students at Stanford today
are less interested in philosophy than their
1960s counterparts, he said. As a professor ot
ancient Greek philosophy, Drekmeier found

it a "much different teaching experience" in
the 1960s to instruct students "who have dis
covered that their moral integrity and the laws
of the country are not in congruence, and who
may be preparing to commit acts of civil dis
obedience.
"Now you wonder just how what you're
teaching is going to be used," he continued.
" It becomes sort of ornamental."
Most of the former Stanford activists
predicted that students might become even
more active than they were in the 1960s if an
emotionally charged issue — such as U.S. in
tervention in Central America — galvanizes
the public.
"1 think if the U.S. were to send troops into
El Salvador or Nicaragua today," Siege/ said,
"you would not only see the same kind of ac
tivism. you'd see much broader support and
linkage with the community, because there's
plenty of people around who went through it
before."
Rational politics
Even though their basic views have stayed
the same, however, one might wonder if there
is a fundamental contradiction between the
activists' present and former activities. Isn't
there an essential difference between David
Harris who went to jail for draft resistance,
and David Harris the successful journalist?
Isn't there a key distinction between Lenny
Siegel who received a summons from the Uni
versitv every time there was a demonstration,

and Lenny Siegel the researcher?
Even though the former activist leaders
here are still working for progressive political
changes, isn't there a difference between oc
cupying the Applied Electronics Laboratory
and lobbying for rent-control legislation?
Not as far as the former Stanford activists
interviewed are concerned. Rather than
seeing their present "within-the-system" poli
tical activities as a form of selling out. the
radicals feel that they're merely adopting the
most practical means of achieving their goals
in the present political and social setting.
"I'm not working in a Chicano community
and I'm not working at IBM," Satterwhite
said. "But I'm not spending my time figuring
out how we can get some land somewhere and
set up our own nation, either. That's a vision
rather than a working objective."
In addition to recognizing the difference be
tween short- and long-term objectives, the
former activists said, being politically effective
in the country today means using tactics ap-

propriate for the current political environ
ment. And, they say, just because they're
adopting practical methods does not mean
they're abandoning their ideals.
"A rational political approach requires that
you be prepared to act on different levels —
from signing petitions to blocking a troop
train," Siegel said. "If I'm not being drafted, I
can't refuse the draft. If they aren't drafting
people, then I can't block an induction cen
ter."
In addition, Harris pointed out that activists
today are not confronted with the intense,
personal, life-or-death issues that radicalized
so many in the '60s.
"1 don't have the personal obsession for
various issues that I had then," Harris said. "J
dropped everything and ended up becoming a
convicted felon because of the war in Viet
nam. There's nothing today that gives me the
urge to go out and become a convicted felon
again."
But that doesn't mean the former Stanford
activist leaders believe that the goals they
sought or the tactics they used in the '60s were
wrong. Instead, they say it just means they
have pragmatically recognized that the tactics
that served radicals well in the '60s will not
work 15 years later —or two years or 30 years

"I'm not a person who believes in repeating
historical epochs," Harris said. "I'm not sit
ting around waiting for the '60s to happen
again. The '60s happened, and it was good
that they happened, and they're over."

linkage with the community, because there's
plenty of people around who went through it
before."
Rational politics
Even though their basic views have stayed
the same, however, one might wonder if there
is a fundamental contradiction between the
activists' present and former activities. Isn't
there an essential difference between David
Harris who went to jail for draft resistance,
and David Harris the successful journalist?
Isn't there a key distinction between Lenny
Siegel who received a summons from the Uni
versitv every time there was a demonstration,

and Lenny Siegel the researcher?
Even though the former activist leaders
here are still working for progressive political
changes, isn't there a difference between oc
cupying the Applied Electronics Laboratory
and lobbying for rent-control legislation?
Not as far as the former Stanford activists
interviewed are concerned. Rather than
seeing their present "within-the-system" poli
tical activities as a form of selling out. the
radicals feel that they're merely adopting the
most practical means of achieving their goals
in the present political and social setting.
"I'm not working in a Chicano community
and I'm not working at IBM," Satterwhite
said. "But I'm not spending my time figuring
out how we can get some land somewhere and
set up our own nation, either. That's a vision
rather than a working objective."
In addition to recognizing the difference be
tween short- and long-term objectives, the
former activists said, being politically effective
in the country today means using tactics ap-

propriate for the current political environ
ment. And, they say, just because they're
adopting practical methods does not mean
they're abandoning their ideals.
"A rational political approach requires that
you be prepared to act on different levels —
from signing petitions to blocking a troop
train," Siegel said. "If I'm not being drafted, I
can't refuse the draft. If they aren't drafting
people, then I can't block an induction cen
ter."
In addition, Harris pointed out that activists
today are not confronted with the intense,
personal, life-or-death issues that radicalized
so many in the '60s.
"1 don't have the personal obsession for
various issues that I had then," Harris said. "J
dropped everything and ended up becoming a
convicted felon because of the war in Viet
nam. There's nothing today that gives me the
urge to go out and become a convicted felon
again."
But that doesn't mean the former Stanford
activist leaders believe that the goals they
sought or the tactics they used in the '60s were
wrong. Instead, they say it just means they
have pragmatically recognized that the tactics
that served radicals well in the '60s will not
work 15 years later —or two years or 30 years
later.
"I'm not a person who believes in repeating
historical epochs," Harris said. "I'm not sit
ting around waiting for the '60s to happen
again. The '60s happened, and it was good
that they happened, and they're over."

In Hollywood's cliched portrayal of what a
typical groups of 1960s radicals has become
today, the public defender is a corporate lawyer,
the crusading journalist works for People maga
zine and the only true visionary has killed him
self .
lint does reality reflect The Big Chill s
scenario? Are all the former radical idealists now
successful microcomputer entrepreneurs and fit
ness salon owners? Have all the anti-war
protesters really gone from the barricades to the
board room?
On the contrary, a survey of student leaders at
Stanford in the 1960s shows that "former" ac
ti\ ists are generally just as committed to progres
sive politics as they were 15 years ago. The focus
of their activities may have shifted, and their tac
tics may be different, but in general former Stan
ford radicals are still sincerely dedicated to their
activist ideals.
Lenny Siegel. once a leader in the Stanford
chapter of the national Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and Stanford's own April Third
Movement auamst military research, said he

thinks most of the activists of his generation have
retained their progressive attitudes.
"A handful have renounced their views." he
said. "But generally, although their positions in
life have changed, they're supporting social
change in some way."
Siegel himself is a good example of a former
student radical attempting to pursue his social
ideals in his professional life. As the administra
tor of the Pacific Studies Center in Mountain
View. Siegel helps maintain a comprehensive li
brary with materials "of broad interest to ac
tivists." Besides working for the Center, which
grew out of the April Third Movement, Siegel
has been involved both in the nuclear freeze
movement and in local campaigns for rent con
trol and against condominium conversion. He
also serves as a research coordinator for the con
gressional campaign of Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy. a progressive candidate seeking to
replace Rep. Ed /schau (R-Sunnyvale).
Jeanne Friedman, one of Siegel's contem
poraries in SDS here, is also still working to
translate her social goals into public policy. After
teaching college for several years. Friedman cur
rently works for a policy and advocacy organiza-

15 years after the 'revolution,'
Stanford '60s activists look back

tion striving to attain civil rights for the disabled.
Friedman maintains that her radical attitudes and
goals have not changed since her Stanford days.
"The U.S. has not done things in the last 10 years
to show that I was wrong." she said.
Omowale Satterwhite, now a city councilman
in East Palo Alto, was active in the Black Student
Union here in the late 19605. Satterwhite cur
rently runs the Institute for the Study of Commu
nity Economic Development in East Palo Alto,
which assists "almost essentially black" nonprofit
organizations in becoming more effective in car
rying out their services.
Satterwhite said he dislikes labels, but admits
that he has been "characterized in some circles as
a black nationalist," both now and in the'6os. He
believes that his present community organizing
work, including his fight to incorporate East Palo
Alto, has grown out of his activities in the 19605.
"I see what I do today as a practical extension
of what I was doing then," he said.

... progressive political causes. Hayes was not
associated with the "revolutionaries" at Stan
ford in the late 60s, and was in fact frequently
caught between SDS and the University ad
ministration.
That s the traditional political position,"
he laughtd. It you re making everybody
angry, maybe you re doing something right."
But I layes is as much a product of his era as
the most militant members of SDS. Attracting
attention as one of the two Board of Trustees
members to vote against the firing of radical
Prof. Bruce Franklin in the early 19705,
Hayes has moved on to lobby tor environmen
talist and solar energy legislation in Washing
ton. In addition to serv ing as chairman of the
50,000-member Solar Lobby, Hayes was an
organizer of the national Earth Day and Sun
Day. Now a law student and a consulting pro
fessor of engineering, Hayes was the director
ot the Solar Energy Research Institute until
he was tired by the Reagan administration.
Hayes joked that some observers may think
that his views should have changed over the
last 15 years. "Maybe I don't have the
capacity for growth," he said. "I'd like to
think that I was perceptive from the start."
Not all former Stanford radicals have
married their progressive ideals to their pro
fessional lives like Siegel, Satterwhite, Fried
man and Hayes. But all of the activists inter
viewed said they have retained the fundamen
tal beliefs they developed in the 19605.
Political Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier,
one ol the leaders of the faculty anti-war
movement here in the 19605, said he is still
sympathetic to "any movement for social
justice." A supporter of the environmentalist
movement and of Carnoy's candidacy, Drek
meier has also helped teach a new peace
studies course here this year.
Drekmeier said lie has retained the funda
mental values that inspired his anti-war ac
tivism in the 19605. "There are moments
when you feel that if you don't speak out . . .
then you really can't go to sleep with a clear
conscience," he said.

One of Stanford's host-known radical
leaders, former ASSU President David Har
ris. attempted to enact his political and social
agenda hy running for Congress in ! 1 )76. But
now disgusted hy the public relations aspects
of the American electoral process — "ideas
have no place in political campaigns," he says
— Harris has decided to devote his time to his
successful journalistic career.

Interestingly enough, Harris — who was
convicted of draft resistance and sent to
prison, had his head shaved by fraternity
members who were vexed by his anti-Greek
attitudes and was once married to radical folk
singer Joan Baez — was the only former Stan
ford leader interviewed who said that his
views have changed much over the years.
"I think I know a lot more now; I should
hope so," he said. "I'd hate to think I'd
wasted all that goddamned time in between."
But Harris said that although his personal
beliefs and attitudes have evolved over the
years, he still supports many of the same is
sues — such as resistance to draft registration
— and feels "comfortable with the person I
was then."
"I don't think my ideas have changed so
much that there's some big break between me
and my past," he said.
Movement's accomplishments
But if their values, beliefs and goals are fun
damentally the same, then how do the former
radicals now view their activities in the 19605?
Do they feel that they achieved their goals?
Or. in retrospect, do they wish that they had
done things differently?
All of the former Stanford leaders agreed
that the movements in which they were in
volved were not completely successful in at
taining all of their stated goals, such as sever
ing the University's military and industrial
ties.
" I think the utility of what we did is an open
historical question," Harris said. "What we
did was very important and very useful. It cer
tainly was by no means 100 percent success
ful."
But nevertheless, all of the activists agreed
that the student movement at Stanford and
across the nation made some very concrete ac
complishments.
"Hell, there's not a Vietnamese war going
on now. That's nice, isn't it?" Harris said. "If
we hadn't done what we did, the first Marine
division would be in San Salvador right now."
In addition, the various movements made
important changes in American culture and

society as a whole, the activists claimed.
"We created an important historical prece
dent," Harris said, "changed some of the basic
terms upon which politics operated in this
country and made an enormous alteration in
the day-to-day operation of the culture wc
lived in."
In addition, several important changes were
made at Stanford itself. Friedman cited the

University's adoption of Affirmative Action
programs, the establishment of SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops on Political and Social
Issues) and the severing of the link between
the University and the Stanford Research In
stitute as concrete results of the student move
ment.
Even though the student radicals had
wanted SRI more tightly controlled by Stan
ford, Friedman said, the protest movement
did manage to force the University to confront
its role in military research.
Hayes also cited the University's changed
attitude on military research as one of the
most important accomplishments of the stu
dent movement here. When he was opposed
to classified research in the I 9605, Hayes said,
his ideas were considered extremely radical at
the time. Now the belief that classified re
search is incompatible with the role of the
University is "well beyond the pale of conven
tional wisdom." he said.
The black student movement on campus
also attained several of its goals, Satterwhite
said. However, the community activist feels
that in retrospect, those goals were too lim
ited. "I think we probably asked for . . . about
5 percent of what we should've asked for." he
said.
After the shooting of Martin Luther King.
Jr., the Black Student Union presented 10
demands to the University, requesting
changes in housing, curriculum, admission and
financial aid policies for black students. Al
though these demands were significant for
their time, Satterwhite said, "in retrospect,
they were very meager."
Instead, the students should have asked for
structural changes "to institutionalize what we
perceived as the needs of black students," he
said.
Nevertheless, the movement did attain most
of its stated goals, he said. "Just about every
thing you see on the campus with a black iden
tification now came out of that movement,"
he said.
Student apathy
All of these activists were present at Stan
ford when the campus witnessed frequent
rallies in White Plaza, window-breakings at
Hoover, sit-ins at the President's Office and
mass anti-war marches down El Camino. But
why. in their opinion, are students today so in
active?
Most of the former radicals interviewed
denied the prevalent assumption that students
today are much more apathetic than their
counterparts in the 19605. Many observers
made sweeping generalizations about student
lethargy even during the heyday of student ac
tivism, Siegel said.
"Every year during the '60s and early '705,"
he said, "somebody would come out with a
paper about how students are no longer ac
tive.
"But the fact is that most of the time, most
of the students were apathetic," he continued.
"It's only because of what was going on in the
world that things happened as they did."
Harris agreed that the extent of present stu
dent apathy is often exaggerated. Many
people romanticize the activity in the '60s and
forget that the student and anti-war move
ments were actually led by determined
minorities, he said.
For example, Harris noted that the govern
ment's estimate of three-quarters of a million
Selective Service Act violators today is much
higher than the number of draft resisters
during the Vietnam War.
"Good God, when we started organizing
draft resistance, you could put all of us in a
room — a small room," he said.
The fact that the level of registration non
compliance is so high is especially noteworthy

considering that students today don't have the
same pressing issues confronting them that
their counterparts did 15 years ago, Harris
said. "When 1 was a student, every day people
our age would be hauled home in plastic bags,
and we were all subject to the draft, he said.
"That created an immediacy to a lot of the is
sues that you don't have today."
Drekmeier speculated that the admissions
policies of the universities today also might
contribute to the present perception ot stu
dent apathy. Students who could have been
admitted to Stanford in earlier years because
of their exceptional extracurricular activities
— for example, editing radical journals —
might now be rejected because the University
doubts that they can "master the kinds of
techniques that a computerized world will re
quire," Drekmeier said.
As a result, the students at Stanford today
are less interested in philosophy than their
1960s counterparts, he said. As a professor ot
ancient Greek philosophy, Drekmeier found

it a "much different teaching experience" in
the 1960s to instruct students "who have dis
covered that their moral integrity and the laws
of the country are not in congruence, and who
may be preparing to commit acts of civil dis
obedience.
"Now you wonder just how what you're
teaching is going to be used," he continued.
" It becomes sort of ornamental."
Most of the former Stanford activists
predicted that students might become even
more active than they were in the 1960s if an
emotionally charged issue — such as U.S. in
tervention in Central America — galvanizes
the public.
"1 think if the U.S. were to send troops into
El Salvador or Nicaragua today," Siege/ said,
"you would not only see the same kind of ac
tivism. you'd see much broader support and
linkage with the community, because there's
plenty of people around who went through it
before."
Rational politics
Even though their basic views have stayed
the same, however, one might wonder if there
is a fundamental contradiction between the
activists' present and former activities. Isn't
there an essential difference between David
Harris who went to jail for draft resistance,
and David Harris the successful journalist?
Isn't there a key distinction between Lenny
Siegel who received a summons from the Uni
versitv every time there was a demonstration,

and Lenny Siegel the researcher?
Even though the former activist leaders
here are still working for progressive political
changes, isn't there a difference between oc
cupying the Applied Electronics Laboratory
and lobbying for rent-control legislation?
Not as far as the former Stanford activists
interviewed are concerned. Rather than
seeing their present "within-the-system" poli
tical activities as a form of selling out. the
radicals feel that they're merely adopting the
most practical means of achieving their goals
in the present political and social setting.
"I'm not working in a Chicano community
and I'm not working at IBM," Satterwhite
said. "But I'm not spending my time figuring
out how we can get some land somewhere and
set up our own nation, either. That's a vision
rather than a working objective."
In addition to recognizing the difference be

can't refuse the draft. If they aren't drafting

In addition, Harris pointed out that activists

said. "When 1 was a student, every day people
our age would be hauled home in plastic bags,
and we were all subject to the draft, he said.
"That created an immediacy to a lot of the is
sues that you don't have today."
Drekmeier speculated that the admissions
policies of the universities today also might
contribute to the present perception ot stu
dent apathy. Students who could have been
admitted to Stanford in earlier years because
of their exceptional extracurricular activities
— for example, editing radical journals —
might now be rejected because the University
doubts that they can "master the kinds of
techniques that a computerized world will re
quire," Drekmeier said.
As a result, the students at Stanford today
are less interested in philosophy than their
1960s counterparts, he said. As a professor ot
ancient Greek philosophy, Drekmeier found

it a "much different teaching experience" in
the 1960s to instruct students "who have dis
covered that their moral integrity and the laws
of the country are not in congruence, and who
may be preparing to commit acts of civil dis
obedience.
"Now you wonder just how what you're
teaching is going to be used," he continued.
" It becomes sort of ornamental."
Most of the former Stanford activists
predicted that students might become even
more active than they were in the 1960s if an
emotionally charged issue — such as U.S. in
tervention in Central America — galvanizes
the public.
"1 think if the U.S. were to send troops into
El Salvador or Nicaragua today," Siege/ said,
"you would not only see the same kind of ac
tivism. you'd see much broader support and
linkage with the community, because there's
plenty of people around who went through it
before."
Rational politics
Even though their basic views have stayed
the same, however, one might wonder if there
is a fundamental contradiction between the
activists' present and former activities. Isn't
there an essential difference between David
Harris who went to jail for draft resistance,
and David Harris the successful journalist?
Isn't there a key distinction between Lenny
Siegel who received a summons from the Uni
versitv every time there was a demonstration,

and Lenny Siegel the researcher?
Even though the former activist leaders
here are still working for progressive political
changes, isn't there a difference between oc
cupying the Applied Electronics Laboratory
and lobbying for rent-control legislation?
Not as far as the former Stanford activists
interviewed are concerned. Rather than
seeing their present "within-the-system" poli
tical activities as a form of selling out. the
radicals feel that they're merely adopting the
most practical means of achieving their goals
in the present political and social setting.
"I'm not working in a Chicano community
and I'm not working at IBM," Satterwhite
said. "But I'm not spending my time figuring
out how we can get some land somewhere and
set up our own nation, either. That's a vision
rather than a working objective."
In addition to recognizing the difference be
tween short- and long-term objectives, the
former activists said, being politically effective
in the country today means using tactics ap-

propriate for the current political environ
ment. And, they say, just because they're
adopting practical methods does not mean
they're abandoning their ideals.
"A rational political approach requires that
you be prepared to act on different levels —
from signing petitions to blocking a troop
train," Siegel said. "If I'm not being drafted, I
can't refuse the draft. If they aren't drafting
people, then I can't block an induction cen
ter."
In addition, Harris pointed out that activists
today are not confronted with the intense,
personal, life-or-death issues that radicalized
so many in the '60s.
"1 don't have the personal obsession for
various issues that I had then," Harris said. "J
dropped everything and ended up becoming a
convicted felon because of the war in Viet
nam. There's nothing today that gives me the
urge to go out and become a convicted felon
again."
But that doesn't mean the former Stanford
activist leaders believe that the goals they
sought or the tactics they used in the '60s were
wrong. Instead, they say it just means they
have pragmatically recognized that the tactics
that served radicals well in the '60s will not
work 15 years later —or two years or 30 years
later.
"I'm not a person who believes in repeating
historical epochs," Harris said. "I'm not sit
ting around waiting for the '60s to happen
again. The '60s happened, and it was good
that they happened, and they're over."

In Hollywood's cliched portrayal of what a
typical groups of 1960s radicals has become
today, the public defender is a corporate lawyer,
the crusading journalist works for People maga
zine and the only true visionary has killed him
self .
lint does reality reflect The Big Chill s
scenario? Are all the former radical idealists now
successful microcomputer entrepreneurs and fit
ness salon owners? Have all the anti-war
protesters really gone from the barricades to the
board room?
On the contrary, a survey of student leaders at
Stanford in the 1960s shows that "former" ac
ti\ ists are generally just as committed to progres
sive politics as they were 15 years ago. The focus
of their activities may have shifted, and their tac
tics may be different, but in general former Stan
ford radicals are still sincerely dedicated to their
activist ideals.
Lenny Siegel. once a leader in the Stanford
chapter of the national Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and Stanford's own April Third
Movement auamst military research, said he

thinks most of the activists of his generation have
retained their progressive attitudes.
"A handful have renounced their views." he
said. "But generally, although their positions in
life have changed, they're supporting social
change in some way."
Siegel himself is a good example of a former
student radical attempting to pursue his social
ideals in his professional life. As the administra
tor of the Pacific Studies Center in Mountain
View. Siegel helps maintain a comprehensive li
brary with materials "of broad interest to ac
tivists." Besides working for the Center, which
grew out of the April Third Movement, Siegel
has been involved both in the nuclear freeze
movement and in local campaigns for rent con
trol and against condominium conversion. He
also serves as a research coordinator for the con
gressional campaign of Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy. a progressive candidate seeking to
replace Rep. Ed /schau (R-Sunnyvale).
Jeanne Friedman, one of Siegel's contem
poraries in SDS here, is also still working to
translate her social goals into public policy. After
teaching college for several years. Friedman cur
rently works for a policy and advocacy organiza-

15 years after the 'revolution,'
Stanford '60s activists look back

tion striving to attain civil rights for the disabled.
Friedman maintains that her radical attitudes and
goals have not changed since her Stanford days.
"The U.S. has not done things in the last 10 years
to show that I was wrong." she said.
Omowale Satterwhite, now a city councilman
in East Palo Alto, was active in the Black Student
Union here in the late 19605. Satterwhite cur
rently runs the Institute for the Study of Commu
nity Economic Development in East Palo Alto,
which assists "almost essentially black" nonprofit
organizations in becoming more effective in car
rying out their services.
Satterwhite said he dislikes labels, but admits
that he has been "characterized in some circles as
a black nationalist," both now and in the'6os. He
believes that his present community organizing
work, including his fight to incorporate East Palo
Alto, has grown out of his activities in the 19605.
"I see what I do today as a practical extension
of what I was doing then," he said.
One of the ASSU presidents of this turbulent
era — Denis Haves of 1 968-69 — is also engaged

... progressive political causes. Hayes was not
associated with the "revolutionaries" at Stan
ford in the late 60s, and was in fact frequently
caught between SDS and the University ad
ministration.
That s the traditional political position,"
he laughtd. It you re making everybody
angry, maybe you re doing something right."
But I layes is as much a product of his era as
the most militant members of SDS. Attracting
attention as one of the two Board of Trustees
members to vote against the firing of radical
Prof. Bruce Franklin in the early 19705,
Hayes has moved on to lobby tor environmen
talist and solar energy legislation in Washing
ton. In addition to serv ing as chairman of the
50,000-member Solar Lobby, Hayes was an
organizer of the national Earth Day and Sun
Day. Now a law student and a consulting pro
fessor of engineering, Hayes was the director
ot the Solar Energy Research Institute until
he was tired by the Reagan administration.
Hayes joked that some observers may think
that his views should have changed over the
last 15 years. "Maybe I don't have the
capacity for growth," he said. "I'd like to
think that I was perceptive from the start."
Not all former Stanford radicals have
married their progressive ideals to their pro
fessional lives like Siegel, Satterwhite, Fried
man and Hayes. But all of the activists inter
viewed said they have retained the fundamen
tal beliefs they developed in the 19605.
Political Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier,
one ol the leaders of the faculty anti-war
movement here in the 19605, said he is still
sympathetic to "any movement for social
justice." A supporter of the environmentalist
movement and of Carnoy's candidacy, Drek
meier has also helped teach a new peace
studies course here this year.
Drekmeier said lie has retained the funda
mental values that inspired his anti-war ac
tivism in the 19605. "There are moments
when you feel that if you don't speak out . . .
then you really can't go to sleep with a clear
conscience," he said.

One of Stanford's host-known radical
leaders, former ASSU President David Har
ris. attempted to enact his political and social
agenda hy running for Congress in ! 1 )76. But
now disgusted hy the public relations aspects
of the American electoral process — "ideas
have no place in political campaigns," he says
— Harris has decided to devote his time to his
successful journalistic career.

Interestingly enough, Harris — who was
convicted of draft resistance and sent to
prison, had his head shaved by fraternity
members who were vexed by his anti-Greek
attitudes and was once married to radical folk
singer Joan Baez — was the only former Stan
ford leader interviewed who said that his
views have changed much over the years.
"I think I know a lot more now; I should
hope so," he said. "I'd hate to think I'd
wasted all that goddamned time in between."
But Harris said that although his personal
beliefs and attitudes have evolved over the
years, he still supports many of the same is
sues — such as resistance to draft registration
— and feels "comfortable with the person I
was then."
"I don't think my ideas have changed so
much that there's some big break between me
and my past," he said.
Movement's accomplishments
But if their values, beliefs and goals are fun
damentally the same, then how do the former
radicals now view their activities in the 19605?
Do they feel that they achieved their goals?
Or. in retrospect, do they wish that they had
done things differently?
All of the former Stanford leaders agreed
that the movements in which they were in
volved were not completely successful in at
taining all of their stated goals, such as sever
ing the University's military and industrial
ties.
" I think the utility of what we did is an open
historical question," Harris said. "What we
did was very important and very useful. It cer
tainly was by no means 100 percent success
ful."
But nevertheless, all of the activists agreed
that the student movement at Stanford and
across the nation made some very concrete ac
complishments.
"Hell, there's not a Vietnamese war going
on now. That's nice, isn't it?" Harris said. "If
we hadn't done what we did, the first Marine
division would be in San Salvador right now."
In addition, the various movements made
important changes in American culture and

society as a whole, the activists claimed.
"We created an important historical prece
dent," Harris said, "changed some of the basic
terms upon which politics operated in this
country and made an enormous alteration in
the day-to-day operation of the culture wc
lived in."
In addition, several important changes were
made at Stanford itself. Friedman cited the

University's adoption of Affirmative Action
programs, the establishment of SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops on Political and Social
Issues) and the severing of the link between
the University and the Stanford Research In
stitute as concrete results of the student move
ment.
Even though the student radicals had
wanted SRI more tightly controlled by Stan
ford, Friedman said, the protest movement
did manage to force the University to confront
its role in military research.
Hayes also cited the University's changed
attitude on military research as one of the
most important accomplishments of the stu
dent movement here. When he was opposed
to classified research in the I 9605, Hayes said,
his ideas were considered extremely radical at
the time. Now the belief that classified re
search is incompatible with the role of the
University is "well beyond the pale of conven
tional wisdom." he said.
The black student movement on campus
also attained several of its goals, Satterwhite
said. However, the community activist feels
that in retrospect, those goals were too lim
ited. "I think we probably asked for . . . about
5 percent of what we should've asked for." he
said.
After the shooting of Martin Luther King.
Jr., the Black Student Union presented 10
demands to the University, requesting
changes in housing, curriculum, admission and
financial aid policies for black students. Al
though these demands were significant for
their time, Satterwhite said, "in retrospect,
they were very meager."
Instead, the students should have asked for
structural changes "to institutionalize what we
perceived as the needs of black students," he
said.
Nevertheless, the movement did attain most
of its stated goals, he said. "Just about every
thing you see on the campus with a black iden
tification now came out of that movement,"
he said.
Student apathy
All of these activists were present at Stan
ford when the campus witnessed frequent
rallies in White Plaza, window-breakings at
Hoover, sit-ins at the President's Office and
mass anti-war marches down El Camino. But
why. in their opinion, are students today so in
active?
Most of the former radicals interviewed
denied the prevalent assumption that students
today are much more apathetic than their
counterparts in the 19605. Many observers
made sweeping generalizations about student
lethargy even during the heyday of student ac
tivism, Siegel said.
"Every year during the '60s and early '705,"
he said, "somebody would come out with a
paper about how students are no longer ac
tive.
"But the fact is that most of the time, most
of the students were apathetic," he continued.
"It's only because of what was going on in the
world that things happened as they did."
Harris agreed that the extent of present stu
dent apathy is often exaggerated. Many
people romanticize the activity in the '60s and
forget that the student and anti-war move
ments were actually led by determined
minorities, he said.
For example, Harris noted that the govern
ment's estimate of three-quarters of a million
Selective Service Act violators today is much
higher than the number of draft resisters
during the Vietnam War.
"Good God, when we started organizing
draft resistance, you could put all of us in a
room — a small room," he said.
The fact that the level of registration non
compliance is so high is especially noteworthy

considering that students today don't have the
same pressing issues confronting them that
their counterparts did 15 years ago, Harris
said. "When 1 was a student, every day people
our age would be hauled home in plastic bags,
and we were all subject to the draft, he said.
"That created an immediacy to a lot of the is
sues that you don't have today."
Drekmeier speculated that the admissions
policies of the universities today also might
contribute to the present perception ot stu
dent apathy. Students who could have been
admitted to Stanford in earlier years because
of their exceptional extracurricular activities
— for example, editing radical journals —
might now be rejected because the University
doubts that they can "master the kinds of
techniques that a computerized world will re
quire," Drekmeier said.
As a result, the students at Stanford today
are less interested in philosophy than their
1960s counterparts, he said. As a professor ot
ancient Greek philosophy, Drekmeier found

it a "much different teaching experience" in
the 1960s to instruct students "who have dis
covered that their moral integrity and the laws
of the country are not in congruence, and who
may be preparing to commit acts of civil dis
obedience.
"Now you wonder just how what you're
teaching is going to be used," he continued.
" It becomes sort of ornamental."
Most of the former Stanford activists
predicted that students might become even
more active than they were in the 1960s if an
emotionally charged issue — such as U.S. in
tervention in Central America — galvanizes
the public.

El Salvador or Nicaragua today," Siege/ said,
