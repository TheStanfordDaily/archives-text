Iraqis attack Iranian refinery
Manama, Bahrain — Iraq announced that its warplanes
raided an oil refinery in northern Iran yesterday and said it
would destroy installations on Iran's Kharg Island in the Per
sian Gulf if Iran launches a major ground assault.
Iran said the Persian Gulf war "has reached a sensitive and
highly fateful stage" and warned that if the United States in
tervened. "then our people will go to the gulf in groups and
make it insecure."
An Iraqi military spokesman, speaking on state television,
said Iraqi jets attacked an oil refinery and a pumping station
near Tabriz, about 300 miles northwest of Tehran.
The attack was "carried out this evening. The two targets
were accurately hit." said the spokesman. "All Iraqi jet
fighters returned sately to base except for one, which was
downed in enemy territory."
The broadcast was monitored in Baghdad. There was no
immediate confirmation from Iran.
Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said in a
speech to artillery and air defense personnel that it would
destroy ports and oil pipelines in the gull region if the United
States intervened in the Iran-Iraq war.
"If we decide to damage the Persian Gulf oil installations,
we shall do so in such a way that they would not be able to
rebuild them in the near future," Rafsanjani said. The speech
was carried on Tehran radio and monitered in Manama.
The United States has said it will intervene in the gulf
region to keep open the Strait of Hormuz. the narrow gulf
passage through which about 20 percent of the non
communist world's oil passes.
Kuwait made an "informal request" to the United States
for short-range Stinger anti-aircraft missiles for protection
against attacks spilling over into the gulf from the Iran-Iraq
war, the Defense Department said.
Iran's parliament may discuss
'cessation' of war with Iraq
Washington — One of Iran's top officials has suggested for
the first time that the Iranian parliament may soon open a
debate about "a cessation" to the 44-month-old war begun
by Iraq.
"We hope to end the war soon." Hojatoleslam Hashemi
Rafsanjani, speaker of the Majlis, or parliament, said at a
news conference in Tehran last week. He sketched out two
options: either a decision by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to
declare an end to the war, which the Majlis would approve, or
a total victory over Iraq.
State Department officials studying the remarks said that it
was the first time a key official had called for parliamentary
debate on the war. It also appeared to be the first time any
option for ending the way other than total victory had been
aired.
Officials said that they viewed the remarks as a signal that
other options were being weighed rather than as meaning
Khomeini had abandoned his demand for the overthrow of
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
The statements also were seen in the context of Iranian ef
forts to maintain public support for the war effort, which has
become bogged down with as many as a half-million troops
and revolutionary guards committed to the front or inside
Iraqi territory.
NATO affirms U.S. arms stance
Washington — The NATO alliance yesterday endorsed the
refusal of the United States to make concessions as the price
for resuming arms control talks. At the same time. President
Reagan assured the allies that his view is that nothing is more
important than achieving a better understanding with the So
viet Union.
"We all recognize there is no more important consideration
than the development of a better working relationship with
the Soviet Union, one marked by greater cooperation and un
derstanding and leading to stable, secure and peaceful rela
tions," Reagan told the foreign ministers of the 16 NATO na
tions as they concluded their spring meeting here.
The president's statement, made at a White House Rose
Garden ceremony on the eve of his departure today for a two
week European trip, was warmly received by the ministers,
several of whom cited it as disproving the view often heard in
Europe that Reagan is interested only in confrontation with
the Soviets.
Reagan, facing a presidential re-election campaign,
reportedly has become increasingly sensitive to charges by his
potential Democratic challengers that his hard-line approach
to the Soviet Union has raised the risk of war and made the
United States mistrusted abroad.
