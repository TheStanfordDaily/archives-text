# House votes to tighten MX moratorium
## 
### 
Washington ( \P) — The House. In the barest ot
margins, voted last night to tighten a prospective
moratorium against the MX strategic missile by
denying President Reagan am discretion over whether
to order production it he thinks the Soviet Union has
tailed to resume arms bargaining in good faith.
And it applied similar curbs, also aimed at rekindling
negotiations with Moscow, to nuclear versions of the
sea-launched cruise missile.
The chamber, on consecutive tallies, voted 199 to
197 and 198 to 147 to strengthen the restrictions it ap
proved May 16 against 1985 production of the 10-
vv at head MX.
In the showdown two weeks earlier, the House
trimmed Reagan's request for 40 of the missiles to 15.
and then only if Moscow refuses, by his assessment, to
begin good-laith bargaining over strategic arms by
April 15. •
1 lie House initially reaffirmed that decision last night
203 to 182. But barely an hour later, the two whisker
thin votes carried the amendment of Reps. Charles
Bennett (D-Fla.) and Stephen Neal (D-N.C.) that
would virtually remove the MX issue from Reagan's
hands. Rep. Dante Fascell (D-Fla.) cast the deciding
vote after Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.). a
longtime MX opponent, tied it.
The new measure would leave the decision of "whe
ther to proceed with any further production of the MX
after next April strictly up to Congress — requiring new
legislation after that date.
Earlier, the House voted to prohibit production ot
nuclear-tipped, sea-launched cruise missiles unless the
Soviet Union deploys a similar weapons system.
The stiffer curb on MX production followed an emo
tional appeal from Democratic Leader Jim Wright ol

Texas, who invoked the words of Dwight Eisenhower:
"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every
rocket tired, signifies in a final sense .i thelt trom those
who are hungrv and are not fed. trom those cold and
not clothed."
"I or 40 vears." said Wright, "we ve been leaptrog
ging each other, each side building weapons ot more
destructive capability. We have 4000 nuclear warheads
in the world already. Both ot lis have enough weapons
to destroy one another three or tour times over ... it
evei we were in a position where we could attord to
take a step lor arms control, now is the time."

budget that the House has tied arms.control strings it)

ventional warheads.
The Tomahawk is sized to be fired from torpedo
tubes, and is capable of being tired from naval vessels
and land platforms. Some 180 would be produced in
1985.
Reps. I.es Aspin (D-Wis.) and Berkley Bedell (D
-lovva) originally proposed to the House that deploy
ment of nuclear-tipped models be prohibited until
President Reagan submits a report to Congress describ

ine methods to distinguish conventional Tomahawks
from those with the nuclear warheads, for treaty
verification purposes.
That, opponents argued, was asking the impossible.
-It would permanently prohibit the deployment of nu
clear cruise missiles on submarines." said Bennett.
Rep. Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.). a proponent of the
sea-based Tomahawk, offered revised language peg
nine deployment to similar action bv the Soviets.
And that. s;nd Stratum, "has already happened." be
cause the So\iet Union has nuclear-tipped SSN-iy s at
sea alread\. By his account, the measure would be no
impediment whatever to the administration.
But Aspin and Bedell apparently caught Stratton in
an end run. They readily agreed to his revision, but
pointed to language in the amendment that specifically
conditioned Tomahawk deployment on whether the
Soviets had deployed a new system after Jan. 31. 1953.
The SSN-1 9 was deployed in 1980.
Critics of the Tomahawk challenged Stratton's asser
tion that the SSN-19 is comparable in any case. They
noted it was designed as an anti-ship weapon, not one
directed against land targets, and has a much shorter
range, less than 500 miles compared to the
Tomahawk's 1500. I he Soviet Union is testing, but has
not deployed, the SSNX-21, which is more similar to
the U.S. weapon.
Rep. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) declared that "what
makes these weapons so dangerous to the future of the
arms race is that they cannot be detected, cannot be
monitored and verified." particularly when it comes to
telling the difference between nuclear and conventional
versions.

legislation after that date.
Earlier, the House voted to prohibit production ot
nuclear-tipped, sea-launched cruise missiles unless the
Soviet Union deploys a similar weapons system.
The stiffer curb on MX production followed an emo
tional appeal from Democratic Leader Jim Wright ol

Texas, who invoked the words of Dwight Eisenhower:
"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every
rocket tired, signifies in a final sense .i thelt trom those
who are hungrv and are not fed. trom those cold and
not clothed."
"I or 40 vears." said Wright, "we ve been leaptrog
ging each other, each side building weapons ot more
destructive capability. We have 4000 nuclear warheads
in the world already. Both ot lis have enough weapons
to destroy one another three or tour times over ... it
evei we were in a position where we could attord to
take a step lor arms control, now is the time."
I he voice vote on the cruise missiles marked the
third time in the three-week debate over the defense
budget that the House has tied arms.control strings it)
the development ot major new entries in the strategic
arse n sal.
The House also has prohibited testing of anti
satellite weapons against objects in space as long as
Moscow continues a moratorium it
The vote last night bars the administration from
huving nuclear weapon versions ol the lomahawk sea
laiinched Cruise missile, for which $589 million would
he budgeted in liscal 1985.
I he money still could be spent for models with con
ventional warheads.
The Tomahawk is sized to be fired from torpedo
tubes, and is capable of being tired from naval vessels
and land platforms. Some 180 would be produced in
1985.
Reps. I.es Aspin (D-Wis.) and Berkley Bedell (D
-lovva) originally proposed to the House that deploy
ment of nuclear-tipped models be prohibited until
President Reagan submits a report to Congress describ

ine methods to distinguish conventional Tomahawks
from those with the nuclear warheads, for treaty
verification purposes.
That, opponents argued, was asking the impossible.
-It would permanently prohibit the deployment of nu
clear cruise missiles on submarines." said Bennett.
Rep. Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.). a proponent of the
sea-based Tomahawk, offered revised language peg
nine deployment to similar action bv the Soviets.
And that. s;nd Stratum, "has already happened." be
cause the So\iet Union has nuclear-tipped SSN-iy s at
sea alread\. By his account, the measure would be no
impediment whatever to the administration.
But Aspin and Bedell apparently caught Stratton in
an end run. They readily agreed to his revision, but
pointed to language in the amendment that specifically
conditioned Tomahawk deployment on whether the
Soviets had deployed a new system after Jan. 31. 1953.
The SSN-1 9 was deployed in 1980.
Critics of the Tomahawk challenged Stratton's asser
tion that the SSN-19 is comparable in any case. They
noted it was designed as an anti-ship weapon, not one
directed against land targets, and has a much shorter
range, less than 500 miles compared to the
Tomahawk's 1500. I he Soviet Union is testing, but has
not deployed, the SSNX-21, which is more similar to
the U.S. weapon.
Rep. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) declared that "what
makes these weapons so dangerous to the future of the
arms race is that they cannot be detected, cannot be
monitored and verified." particularly when it comes to
telling the difference between nuclear and conventional
versions.
