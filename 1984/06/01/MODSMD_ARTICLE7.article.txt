## The 						Stanford Daily Putting Fritz in the fire 
### 
It isn't too often that a presidential candidate
drops by Stanford to make a speech. And almost
everyone was encouraged to hear that former
Vice President Walter Mondale, Democratic con
tender for the nomination, had made plans to visit
the University earlier this week.
Before the end of the weekend, however, his
plans were off. Mondale people say it was because
of conflicting commitments in New Jersey, but
some at Stanford believe his cancellation was a
direct result of the United Stanford Workers'
(USW) demand that Mondale either support the
union in its dispute with the University or suffer
an anti-University picket during his appearance.
If he had come, Mondale would have entered a
campus in the middle of a bitter labor dispute. As
a candidate with a deep, public commitment to
organized labor as well as strong ties to establish
ment Democrats, Mondale was placed in a politi
cally difficult position.
Regardless of whether USW's threat had any
thing to do with Mondale's change in plans, the
incident offers some new insights into the labor
conflict and its participants. USW says it could
not stand idly by while Mondale, a candidate
seeking organized labor's support, was being in

troduced by University President Donald Ken
nedy — a union-buster in the eyes of USW.
Still, USW could easily have altered its tactics
so that it picketed Kennedy without risking
Mondale's withdrawal — by not attempting to
coerce Mondale, for example. USW has every
right to protest the University's treatment of
labor; it should not. however, drive off presiden
tial candidates in the process.
Ihe incident also reveals Kennedy's hitter
feelings toward the union. Immediately after the
cancellation, Kennedy berated the union for
spoiling the event. We feel the tone of the state
ment was extremely paternalistic and evidenced
his desire to foster antipathy toward the union in
the Stanford community. It was a cheap shot, a
heavy-handed action in an attempt to boost Ken
nedy's ailing reputation on the labor issue.
Throughout their battle, it has been the strat
egy of both USW and Kennedy to take strong
stands and to actively seek support from the com
munity. Both factions attempted to take advan
tage of the Mondale visit and subsequent cancel
lation by using the events to advocate their
stance. This type of manipulation is unnecessary
and harmful to all parties.
