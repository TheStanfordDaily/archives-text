## Party proceeds destined for literacy campaign 
### 
In response to the Daily article "Aid or
Arms" (May 25) we at Synergy House would
like to clarify some of the issues. The actions
described in this letter were approved hv
house consensus; the political views are the
writers' own.
First, as stated in the article, we are sending
the proceeds of our party to the Sandinista
Defense Committee (CDS) in Nicaragua. We

VIEWPOINT

have decided to specify that the funds be used
for the ongoing literacy campaign. The Stan
ford branch of USOCA (U.S. out of Central
America), through which we are sending the
money, has arranged this by direct telephone
contact with connections in the CDS
headquarters.
The literacy campaign, one of the main
focuses of the CDS. reduced illiteracy from
over one-half to less than one-seventh of the
population in its first year, and is still operat
ing today. For instance, the campaign now
prints easy-to-read comic books on topics
such as how to build grain silos and air-raid
shelters. It has been greatly lauded by the
United Nations.
We emphasize here that we fully support
the sovereignty of the CDS over its own af
fairs. According to the "Aid or Arms" article,
many CDS funds go to arms purchasing. At
this point, having spoken with a number of

people who have been in Nicaragua and have

studied the CDS. we doubt very much that
any CDS money is spent on arms, although
the CDS may distribute some arms received
from the militias. We have two reasons for
specifying the use of the funds:
• Synergy originally agreed upon allocation to
the CDS with no recognition that any funds
might go to arms.
• Several of the dorms that donated to our
party were also unaware of this.
However, the writers of this viewpoint, and
some house members, would not object were
some money spent on arms. We. the writers,
doubt that a purely nonviolent solution is pos
sible today in Nicaragua. We should ask
Robert Wesson and Col. Lawrence Tracy
(quoted in the May 25 article) whether they,
like many conservatives, support sending
money to arm the contras, who have killed
1300 Nicaraguans in the last year.
If the issue is not nonviolence, it must be a
question of which side to support. The answer
is clear to us. The people of Nicaragua in
1979. like the people of the United States in
1776. revolted against an oppressive system of
government. In fact, in 1979, the country was
so united that even most of the upper classes
were against the Somoza government. The
Sandinista National Liberation Front led the
revolution, and since they came to power in
July of 1979, the situation has improved im
mensely.
Torture and political murder have disap
peared (see reports by Americas Watch,

Amnesty International, etc.). Expenditures
for health and education have more than
tripled. The infant death rate has been
reduced by one-third. Almost 40,000 landless
rural families have received access to land.
Production of corn is up by 10 percent, beans
by 45 percent and rice by 100 percent. (See
"Now We Can Speak," by Frances Moore
Lappe and Joseph Collins, and "Revolution in

Central America," edited by the Stanford
Central America Action Network).
While the CDS. to which we are donating
our funds, is not a Nicaraguan government or
ganization. it has been very important in im
plementing these improvements in
Nicaraguan daily life. The CDS is a grass
roots organization consisting of thousands of
small groups, totaling more than half a million

members, in neighborhoods all over the
country. Some of the most important func
tions of the local CDS groups have included
involvement in the literacy campaign, the
teaching of health techniques and distribution
of medical supplies and the organization of
volunteer citizens' watches, some of them
armed, which patrol the streets at night to
guard against petty crime, and occasionally,
against contra attacks. Importantly, the CDS
serves as an outlet for suggestions and griev
ances in the community. A meeting described
in Lappe and Collins' book included planning
for a community dance as well as complaints
about the disorganized state of the local li
brary.
In addition to voicing opinions on the local
levels, the groups elect representatives to the
National CDS committee, which elects nine
delegates to the Council of State. This council,
composed of delegates from the Sandinista
party, the CDS and some opposition parties,
governs the country along with the Sandinista
junta.
Wesson and Tracy's insinuations that the
CDS coerces members to join and spies on the
populace are not borne out by observations ol
visitors to Nicaragua or by research ol
Central American church groups. While in the
history of the thousands of village committees
there have probably been a few abuses, the
weight of the evidence clearly shows the bene
ficial effect of the CDS on society. To call the
CDS a "network of informants" is as

ridiculous as applying the same label to any
neighborhood crime watch in the United
States, and completely ignores the many other
equally important functions of the CDS.
Our government seems unable to view the
situation from the Nicaraguan perspective; it
sees the Sandinistas only as "puppets of the
expansionist Soviet Union," a threat to our
security. These ideas, unfounded even in a
military context, completely ignore the fact
that the Sandinistas are succeeding in
Nicaragua not because of Soviet support, but
because they are supported by the Nicaraguan
people. The Sandinistas have a vision of a
democratic society with justice, freedom and
human rights and needs. Is it perhaps the ex
ample ol a revolutionary success which the
United States fears the most?
When Reagan talks about "exporting revo
lution." does he mean that in other countries
where America supports brutal governments,
the people might read about the success of the
Sandinista revolution, and the peace, freedom
and food provided to the average Nicaraguan?
We at Synergy held our benefit party to en
courage questions such as these. We would
like to thank Theta Chi, Terra, Phi Psi,
Granada and Casa /apata and the individuals
who chose to make a donation for their sup
port in this matter.
