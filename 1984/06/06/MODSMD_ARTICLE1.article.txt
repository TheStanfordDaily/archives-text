## Hart leads delegate count; Mondale takes popular vote 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer With wire reports 
Former Vice President Walter
Mondale captured the popular vote in
yesterday's California primary, hut he
lost the delegate race, possibly depriv
ing him of the 1967 delegates he needs
to clinch the Democratic presidential
nomination.
With 90 percent of the precincts re
ported this morning, Mondale had 39
percent of the popular vote to
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart's 35 per
cent. But Hart had ISI delegates to SO
for Mondale. Rev. Jesse Jackson had

' r \ ii -i ; •' 1
proce.v; . ! awarding delegates on the
basis of victory in each congressional
district rather than on a winner-take
all basis. Under Democratic party
rules, delegates are not bound even
when they are elected in a particular
candidate's name.
Early this morning Mondale was
still claiming a victory, saying he
would capture the necessary delegates
from California to secure the Demo

cratic nomination.
Mondale had yesterday planned an
announcement for noon today to
''announce who won." But Hart said
last night that he's in the race "to San
Francisco."
Because of California's inconclusive
results. Hart and Mondale are ex
pected to hattle until the convention,
trying to garner the support of a num
ber of uncommitted delegates.
According to a volunteer at the
Hart campaign headquarters in Los
Angeles, California is one case where
the rules of the Democratic party
aided rather than hurt Hart. "In a lot
of close districts we've won.
Mondale's gotten a large percentage
because he's won big in the districts
he's won, but he can't announce to
morrow at noon that he's over the
top." he said.
Hart announced to supporters last
night that he won the first primary in
New Hampshire and that "we believe
we will win the last and the largest in
California."
Mondale likewise was confident as
he told his supporters he had a
message for President Reagan: "Don't
look back, someone's gaining on you."
Jackson got more than 20 percent of
the vote in New Jersey, guaranteeing
him federal funding.
Mondale scored decisive victories in
West Virginia and New Jersey, which
had 142 delegates between the two
states.
I lart won the smaller delegate states
of New Mexico and South Dakota.
Eric Diesel, a member of Students
For Mondale, attributes Mondale's
support in California "in particular to
his position to shut down the danger
ous Diablo Canyon nuclear power
facility." Mondale was also the first
presidential candidate to endorse, tiu
nuclear freeze. Diesel said.
Mondale has shown "leadership as
an original co-sponsor of the ERA,"
he said. Californians were likewise
drawn to his pro-education stand and
support for environmental issues be
cause "these are the issues that appeal
to liberal Cailfornian voters," Diesel
added.

showing in Los Aneeles as greatly

aiding their delegate count. "It's not
over \et. We're in it until and through
S;m Francisco." a Hart volunteer said.
Keith Archuleta, a Jackson delegate
from the 12th District, is also pleased
with the California results. "I think he
(Jackson) has done pretty well . . . he's
gotten 12 percent of the white vote in
Northern California and we think
we'll get 20 percent of the state vote."
Diesel forsees few problems in uni
ting the party for the future. •"We'll
start working with Hart and Jackson
people. We'll all he working together
\ to defeat Ronald Reagan," he said.
But Jackson is still not committed to
either candidate, Archuleta said. "At
this point lie's not saving he'll go with
Hart or Mondale but rather trying to
resolve conflicts. He will work with
other 'uncommitteds.' Jackson pro
posed for the three of them (Jackson,
Hart and Mondale) to get together
before the convention. Jackson pro
posed making three lists: one of the
things they agree on, one of the things
they don't agree on and one of the
things they may agree on."
Jackson's message to Hart and
Mondale is that "the two of them bet
tor stop lighting and work together to
defeat Ronald Reagan," Archuleta
said.
California election officials
predicted a 62 percent turnout among
California's 11.5 million voters, the
lowest presidential primary turnout in
36 years. However, California would
still have the largest number of voters
participating in any primary.
Yesterday California was significant
not only in terms of delegates but also
symbolically because it represents a
broad cross section of the country with
its diverse population and economy.
Archuleta agreed. "California,
other than New York, is the first test
of the Rainbow Coalition. There was a
large turn-out of Asian, white,
Chicano and other voters,"he said.
Jackson's East Palo Alto appear
ance helped the coalition, according to
Archuleta. "We did a very good pro
gram in East Palo Alto. . .1 think it's
important for people see first hand the
type of coalition that comes together

around Jackson." he said.
Students here who were exercising
their right to vote yesterday encoun
tered numerous difficulties. Primary
among them was failure to consult
their sample ballot before proceeding
to a polling site. In the April elections
because of a smaller ballot several
precincts were combined.
Yesterday parts of the Stanford
campus were included in 13 different
precincts, each with its own polling
site. "Some people came here saying' I
voted here in April' but now they are
in a different precinct." said Carol
Hint/, election inspector at the Wilbur

Hall polling site.
The situation caused confusion for
at least one student.
"We went up to Tresidder where
there lias been a polling site in the
past. We asked at the information
desk where the polling place was and
the man said 'that seems to he the
question of the day,' " said student
Sarah Carpenter.
"It would be a lot easier if it was the
same place every year. . .If you didn't
know and weren't directed you'd have
a hard time finding it," Carpenter
added.

precincts, each with its own polling
site. "Some people came here saying' I
voted here in April' but now they are
in a different precinct." said Carol
Hint/, election inspector at the Wilbur

Hall polling site.
The situation caused confusion for
at least one student.
"We went up to Tresidder where
there lias been a polling site in the
past. We asked at the information
desk where the polling place was and
the man said 'that seems to he the
question of the day,' " said student
Sarah Carpenter.
"It would be a lot easier if it was the
same place every year. . .If you didn't
know and weren't directed you'd have
a hard time finding it," Carpenter
added.

Although voting turnout across the state was the lowest in 36 years,
some Stanford voters did go to campus polls to cast their ballots in yes
terday's primary.
Former Vice President Walter
Mondale captured the popular vote in
yesterday's California primary, hut he
lost the delegate race, possibly depriv
ing him of the 1967 delegates he needs
to clinch the Democratic presidential
nomination.
With 90 percent of the precincts re
ported this morning, Mondale had 39
percent of the popular vote to
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart's 35 per
cent. But Hart had ISI delegates to SO
for Mondale. Rev. Jesse Jackson had

proce.v; . ! awarding delegates on the
basis of victory in each congressional
district rather than on a winner-take
all basis. Under Democratic party
rules, delegates are not bound even
when they are elected in a particular
candidate's name.
Early this morning Mondale was
still claiming a victory, saying he
would capture the necessary delegates
from California to secure the Demo

cratic nomination.
Mondale had yesterday planned an
announcement for noon today to
''announce who won." But Hart said
last night that he's in the race "to San
Francisco."
Because of California's inconclusive
results. Hart and Mondale are ex
pected to hattle until the convention,
trying to garner the support of a num
ber of uncommitted delegates.
According to a volunteer at the
Hart campaign headquarters in Los
Angeles, California is one case where
the rules of the Democratic party
aided rather than hurt Hart. "In a lot
of close districts we've won.
Mondale's gotten a large percentage
because he's won big in the districts
he's won, but he can't announce to
morrow at noon that he's over the
top." he said.
Hart announced to supporters last
night that he won the first primary in
New Hampshire and that "we believe
we will win the last and the largest in
California."
Mondale likewise was confident as
he told his supporters he had a
message for President Reagan: "Don't
look back, someone's gaining on you."
Jackson got more than 20 percent of
the vote in New Jersey, guaranteeing
him federal funding.
Mondale scored decisive victories in
West Virginia and New Jersey, which
had 142 delegates between the two
states.
I lart won the smaller delegate states
of New Mexico and South Dakota.
Eric Diesel, a member of Students
For Mondale, attributes Mondale's
support in California "in particular to
his position to shut down the danger
ous Diablo Canyon nuclear power
facility." Mondale was also the first
presidential candidate to endorse, tiu
nuclear freeze. Diesel said.
Mondale has shown "leadership as
an original co-sponsor of the ERA,"
he said. Californians were likewise
drawn to his pro-education stand and
support for environmental issues be
cause "these are the issues that appeal
to liberal Cailfornian voters," Diesel
added.
Hart supporters point to a strong
showing in Los Aneeles as greatly

aiding their delegate count. "It's not
over \et. We're in it until and through
S;m Francisco." a Hart volunteer said.
Keith Archuleta, a Jackson delegate
from the 12th District, is also pleased
with the California results. "I think he
(Jackson) has done pretty well . . . he's
gotten 12 percent of the white vote in
Northern California and we think
we'll get 20 percent of the state vote."
Diesel forsees few problems in uni
ting the party for the future. •"We'll
start working with Hart and Jackson
people. We'll all he working together
\ to defeat Ronald Reagan," he said.
But Jackson is still not committed to
either candidate, Archuleta said. "At
this point lie's not saving he'll go with
Hart or Mondale but rather trying to
resolve conflicts. He will work with
other 'uncommitteds.' Jackson pro
posed for the three of them (Jackson,
Hart and Mondale) to get together
before the convention. Jackson pro
posed making three lists: one of the
things they agree on, one of the things
they don't agree on and one of the
things they may agree on."
Jackson's message to Hart and
Mondale is that "the two of them bet
tor stop lighting and work together to
defeat Ronald Reagan," Archuleta
said.
California election officials
predicted a 62 percent turnout among
California's 11.5 million voters, the
lowest presidential primary turnout in
36 years. However, California would
still have the largest number of voters
participating in any primary.
Yesterday California was significant
not only in terms of delegates but also
symbolically because it represents a
broad cross section of the country with
its diverse population and economy.
Archuleta agreed. "California,
other than New York, is the first test
of the Rainbow Coalition. There was a
large turn-out of Asian, white,
Chicano and other voters,"he said.
Jackson's East Palo Alto appear
ance helped the coalition, according to
Archuleta. "We did a very good pro
gram in East Palo Alto. . .1 think it's
important for people see first hand the
type of coalition that comes together

around Jackson." he said.
Students here who were exercising
their right to vote yesterday encoun
tered numerous difficulties. Primary
among them was failure to consult
their sample ballot before proceeding
to a polling site. In the April elections
because of a smaller ballot several
precincts were combined.
Yesterday parts of the Stanford
campus were included in 13 different
precincts, each with its own polling
site. "Some people came here saying' I
voted here in April' but now they are
in a different precinct." said Carol
