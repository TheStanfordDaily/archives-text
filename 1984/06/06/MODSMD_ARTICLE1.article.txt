## Hart leads delegate count; Mondale takes popular vote 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer With wire reports 
Former Vice President Walter
Mondale captured the popular vote in
yesterday's California primary, hut he
lost the delegate race, possibly depriv
ing him of the 1967 delegates he needs
to clinch the Democratic presidential
nomination.
With 90 percent of the precincts re
ported this morning, Mondale had 39
percent of the popular vote to
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart's 35 per
cent. But Hart had ISI delegates to SO
for Mondale. Rev. Jesse Jackson had

11, raptuied far more delegates

proce.v; . ! awarding delegates on the
basis of victory in each congressional
district rather than on a winner-take
all basis. Under Democratic party
rules, delegates are not bound even
when they are elected in a particular
candidate's name.
Early this morning Mondale was
still claiming a victory, saying he
would capture the necessary delegates
from California to secure the Demo

cratic nomination.
Mondale had yesterday planned an
announcement for noon today to
''announce who won." But Hart said
last night that he's in the race "to San
Francisco."
Because of California's inconclusive
results. Hart and Mondale are ex
pected to hattle until the convention,
trying to garner the support of a num
ber of uncommitted delegates.
According to a volunteer at the
Hart campaign headquarters in Los
Angeles, California is one case where
the rules of the Democratic party
aided rather than hurt Hart. "In a lot
of close districts we've won.
Mondale's gotten a large percentage
because he's won big in the districts
he's won, but he can't announce to
morrow at noon that he's over the
top." he said.
Hart announced to supporters last
night that he won the first primary in
New Hampshire and that "we believe
we will win the last and the largest in
California."
Mondale likewise was confident as
he told his supporters he had a
message for President Reagan: "Don't
look back, someone's gaining on you."
Jackson got more than 20 percent of
the vote in New Jersey, guaranteeing
him federal funding.
Mondale scored decisive victories in
West Virginia and New Jersey, which
had 142 delegates between the two
states.
I lart won the smaller delegate states
of New Mexico and South Dakota.
Eric Diesel, a member of Students
For Mondale, attributes Mondale's
support in California "in particular to
his position to shut down the danger
ous Diablo Canyon nuclear power
facility." Mondale was also the first
presidential candidate to endorse, tiu
nuclear freeze. Diesel said.
Mondale has shown "leadership as
an original co-sponsor of the ERA,"
he said. Californians were likewise
drawn to his pro-education stand and
support for environmental issues be
cause "these are the issues that appeal
to liberal Cailfornian voters," Diesel
added.
Hart supporters point to a strong
showing in Los Aneeles as greatly
