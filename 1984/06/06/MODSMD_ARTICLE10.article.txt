## Sakharov's friends remain optimistic 
### TROY EID Daily staff 
It's been over a month since So
viet physicist Andrei Sakharov
dropped from Western view, and
even his Iriends disagree as to w hat
has happened to him.
I he mood of the scientists and
human rights activists working
most intimately on behalf of the
Nobel Prize-winning dissident, who
launched a hunger strike May 2 to
demand authorities release his wife
to the West for medical care, con
tinues to be one of guarded op
timism, even in the face of incom
plete and often contradictory
reports from the Soviet Union.
To Sidney Drell, deputy direc
tory of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and a close friend
of the Soviet physicist, one of the
most encouraging reports arrived
Saturday from Sakharov's stepson
living in Boston.
The stepson, Aleksei Sem
yonov, said '"a reliable source"
in the Soviet city of Ciorky saw
Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner,
"walking on the balcony of her
apartment" May 28.
In a telephone interview, Drell,
on sabbatical at Columbia Univer
sity in New York, said Saturday
that the Semyonov report "shows
me that (Bonner) is not desperately
sick. I'm pleased to have physicial
proof that she is mobile."
Bonner, who has suffered three
heart attacks and the loss of an eye,
reportedly began her own hunger
strike when Sakharov was removed
from their Gorky apartment by So
viet authorities May 7, and Drell
said Semyonov "seems to feel that
she is alone there."
But Vladimir Bukovsky, a
former Soviet dissident living in

Palo Alto, said he disputes the
Semyonov report.
"Sakharov and Bonner live on
the ground floor. There is no bal
cony . . . There is no patio. They do
not have (patios) in the Soviet
Union.
"A few days ago some of my
friends went to Gorky, and they say
the windows of the apartment are
dark," Burkovsky said.
At about the same time Drell
disclosed the Semyonov report, an
Italian newspaper said a writer in
Florence had received a telephone
call from Bonner saying she had
been told at a hospital in Gorky
that "your husband is no longer
with us."
The New York Times said West
ern diplomats questioned whether
the call had taken place. The
diplomats said Bonner, if allowed
telephone access, would likely have
contacted family or friends.
But Bukovsky, who describes his
term in a Soviet prison camp in his
book, "To Build a Castle," said he
has confirmed that "the call came
from the Soviet Union."
"I have friends in Florence who
have checked with the computer
system, so 1 know the call was
made. But I have no idea what was
said, or if it was Bonner," he said.
The Italian dispatch was fol
lowed closely by an article in The
Sunday Times of London which
said Sakharov died Thursday. The
Associated Press and United Press
International did not confirm The
Times report, and by Monday offi
cial sources in Moscow said Sak
harov was alive. Yesterday mor
ning, the Soviet news agency
TASS, echoing previous statements
on the subject, said Sakharov and
Bonner "are in good health and are

not starving.
Drell, the co-director of Stan
ford's Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control (CISAC),
said he is somewhat reassured by
the TASS statement. Paul Flory,
emeritus professor of chemistry
and a Nobel laureate, concurred,
saying the report may reflect a
slightly different tone on the part of

Soviet officials. "They may have
dropped their campaign of mali
cious attacks against him," he said.
Coit Blacker, the CISAC associ
ate director, said the TASS state
ment "can be viewed as encourag
ing because it does seem to indicate
the Soviet bureaucracy ... is con
cerned enough to say something to
the effect that (Sakharov and Bon
ner) are still alive."
Bukovsky, however, said the
flurry over Sakharov this weekend
reveals that Soviet officials "are in
terested in leaking out news that
Sakharov is dead." He said the

leaks indicate "he really is dead" or
a willingness by the government to
"lay the foundation just in case he
does die."
Bukovskyand Blacker agree that
the possibility of Sakharov's
release is remote, hut for different
reasons.
Blacker said Soviet authorities
recognize that holding Sakharov
and Bonner might be costly, but in
the present political climate are
unlikely to act "in any way that
might be perceived to be a conces
sion." He said the tactics of the
Stanford scientists and others who
have sought to focus public opinion
on the dissidents "can keep Sak
harov and Bonner alive," but
"probably will not get them
released."
"The most effective way to com
municate one's concern is in
private," he said.
Bukovsky said pursuing private
negotiations would be "a profound
mistake."
"1 don't remember any case of
private diplomacy achieving results
in these matters. Quite to the con
trary, the more open the talks are
the better," he said.
"As far as I know the Soviet
Union, they normally judge these
things on the basis of increments,"
Bukovsky said. If the cost is too
high, Soviet leaders "find a way to
get rid of the problem."
Only public attention will free
Sakharov and Bonner, but keeping
that interest at a high level is a dif
ficult task, Bukovsky said.
"We've all witnessed how
quickly people forget," he said.
"Think of the Korean Airliner.
That's the trouble in the West.
People get tired and distracted and
then they forget."

But Bukovsky, who describes his
term in a Soviet prison camp in his
book, "To Build a Castle," said he
has confirmed that "the call came
from the Soviet Union."
"I have friends in Florence who
have checked with the computer
system, so 1 know the call was
made. But I have no idea what was
said, or if it was Bonner," he said.
The Italian dispatch was fol
lowed closely by an article in The
Sunday Times of London which
said Sakharov died Thursday. The
Associated Press and United Press
International did not confirm The
Times report, and by Monday offi
cial sources in Moscow said Sak
harov was alive. Yesterday mor
ning, the Soviet news agency
TASS, echoing previous statements
on the subject, said Sakharov and
Bonner "are in good health and are

not starving.
Drell, the co-director of Stan
ford's Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control (CISAC),
said he is somewhat reassured by
the TASS statement. Paul Flory,
emeritus professor of chemistry
and a Nobel laureate, concurred,
saying the report may reflect a
slightly different tone on the part of

Soviet officials. "They may have
dropped their campaign of mali
cious attacks against him," he said.
Coit Blacker, the CISAC associ
ate director, said the TASS state
ment "can be viewed as encourag
ing because it does seem to indicate
the Soviet bureaucracy ... is con
cerned enough to say something to
the effect that (Sakharov and Bon
ner) are still alive."
Bukovsky, however, said the
flurry over Sakharov this weekend
reveals that Soviet officials "are in
terested in leaking out news that
Sakharov is dead." He said the

leaks indicate "he really is dead" or
a willingness by the government to
"lay the foundation just in case he
does die."
Bukovskyand Blacker agree that
the possibility of Sakharov's
release is remote, hut for different
reasons.
Blacker said Soviet authorities
recognize that holding Sakharov
and Bonner might be costly, but in
the present political climate are
unlikely to act "in any way that
might be perceived to be a conces
sion." He said the tactics of the
Stanford scientists and others who
have sought to focus public opinion
on the dissidents "can keep Sak
harov and Bonner alive," but
"probably will not get them
released."
"The most effective way to com
municate one's concern is in
private," he said.
Bukovsky said pursuing private
negotiations would be "a profound
mistake."
"1 don't remember any case of
private diplomacy achieving results
in these matters. Quite to the con
trary, the more open the talks are
the better," he said.
"As far as I know the Soviet
Union, they normally judge these
things on the basis of increments,"
Bukovsky said. If the cost is too
high, Soviet leaders "find a way to
get rid of the problem."
Only public attention will free
Sakharov and Bonner, but keeping
that interest at a high level is a dif
ficult task, Bukovsky said.
"We've all witnessed how
quickly people forget," he said.
"Think of the Korean Airliner.
That's the trouble in the West.
People get tired and distracted and
then they forget."


Andrei Sakharov
Whereabouts still unknown
It's been over a month since So
viet physicist Andrei Sakharov
dropped from Western view, and
even his Iriends disagree as to w hat
has happened to him.
I he mood of the scientists and
human rights activists working
most intimately on behalf of the
Nobel Prize-winning dissident, who
launched a hunger strike May 2 to
demand authorities release his wife
to the West for medical care, con
tinues to be one of guarded op
timism, even in the face of incom
plete and often contradictory
reports from the Soviet Union.
To Sidney Drell, deputy direc
tory of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and a close friend
of the Soviet physicist, one of the
most encouraging reports arrived
Saturday from Sakharov's stepson
living in Boston.
The stepson, Aleksei Sem
yonov, said '"a reliable source"
in the Soviet city of Ciorky saw
Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner,
"walking on the balcony of her
apartment" May 28.
In a telephone interview, Drell,
on sabbatical at Columbia Univer
sity in New York, said Saturday
that the Semyonov report "shows
me that (Bonner) is not desperately
sick. I'm pleased to have physicial
proof that she is mobile."
Bonner, who has suffered three
heart attacks and the loss of an eye,
reportedly began her own hunger
strike when Sakharov was removed
from their Gorky apartment by So
viet authorities May 7, and Drell
said Semyonov "seems to feel that
she is alone there."
But Vladimir Bukovsky, a
former Soviet dissident living in

Palo Alto, said he disputes the
Semyonov report.
"Sakharov and Bonner live on
the ground floor. There is no bal
cony . . . There is no patio. They do
not have (patios) in the Soviet
Union.
"A few days ago some of my
friends went to Gorky, and they say
the windows of the apartment are
dark," Burkovsky said.
At about the same time Drell
disclosed the Semyonov report, an
Italian newspaper said a writer in
Florence had received a telephone
call from Bonner saying she had
been told at a hospital in Gorky
that "your husband is no longer
with us."
The New York Times said West
ern diplomats questioned whether
the call had taken place. The
diplomats said Bonner, if allowed
telephone access, would likely have
contacted family or friends.
But Bukovsky, who describes his
term in a Soviet prison camp in his
book, "To Build a Castle," said he
has confirmed that "the call came
from the Soviet Union."
"I have friends in Florence who
have checked with the computer
system, so 1 know the call was
