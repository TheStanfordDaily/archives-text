# Survey finds most don't like to report cheaters

A survey conducted by the Honor Code Com
mission indicates that most students object to the
code's third party obligation of turning in other
students who they witness cheating, especially
when there is a professor or teaching assistant
present in the examination room.
According to Mark Landesmann, chairman of
the commission, the survey also reveals "some
good news" as proctoring occurs only "very
rarely." He said the exception to this is in the sci
ence departments of chemistry and biology , where
there is a higher proclivity for proctoring.
Jon Adelstein, an ASSU senator who also sits on
the commission, said a "small proportion" of pro
fessors proctor, largely because they are aware that
students are not willing to turn in their peers.

Landesmann said professors who proctor "hurt
the credibility of the Honor Code."
The third party burden, as it exists now,
demands students take action when they see some
one cheating. Such action includes encouraging the
violator to stop, and then to report the incident to
the professor if the violation persists.
More than 600 undergraduates returned the
questionnaires, which were distributed by mail and
in the classroom. Landesmann said professors
were very cooperative in distributing the survey.
Adelstein said students are "signing away their
honor" when they decide to attend Stanford be
cause they are likely not to obide by the third party
burden. He added, however, that very few stu
dents admit to cheating on exams.
Adelstein said changing the Honor Code is a
"touchy issue." He said because professors recog

nize that many students will not accept the third
party, they feel the need to proctor. "There is a lot
of administrative resistance to going too much to
the students' preferences," Adelstein said.
Landesmann added that it will be difficult to
change the Honor Code to fit student preferences
"without threatening the stability of the Honor
Code."
The Honor Code Commission is comprised of
students, faculty and University administrators.
Landesmann said this is the first time in the com
mission's existence that there has been a survey
which "directly grouped students' preferences"
about the Honor Code.
A detailed report of the survey will he
developed this summer and given to members of
the ASSU Senate and the Student Conduct
Legislative Council.
