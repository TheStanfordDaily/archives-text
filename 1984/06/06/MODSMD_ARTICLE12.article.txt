# Tresidder changes to begin in summer
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
Tresidder Union will undergo the
first half of its two part renovation
plan this summer, with the replace
ment of Sequoia Travel, the downsiz
ing of Wells Fargo Bank and the up
dating of many of the meeting rooms.
"The first part of our project is
fairly modest in scope," said Ellie Op
penheim, director of Tresidder Union.
"To begin with, we'll be replacing the
folding wall between the two upstairs
room 2XI-2N2 with a new soundproof
folding wall, allowing us to double
schedule the rooms.
"We'll also be putting in new carpet
and furnishings." Oppcnheim said.
"Basically we'll be jazzing the place
up.
"Secondly, we'll be downsizing the
Wells Fargo Bank. The bank will be
reduced somewhat in size and partially
in existing services, all of which will
still be available at the (Stanford)
Barn office, however," said Oppen
heim.

Betty Lattie, vice president of
public relations for Wells Fargo Bank,
added "We'll be continuing to provide
the transactions that most of us do
anyway: opening and closing of ac
counts. loan applications, teller and
check cashing at two walk-up win
dows, etc. In addition, we'll be adding
a third express stop," she said.
"As well, in realization that not
everyone desires to bank with Wells
Fargo, there will be the addition of
two automatic tellers from two other
financial operations," Oppenheim
stated. "We've received proposals
from banks which students have
shown the most interest in, and we're

presently reviewing them."
Wells Fargo will also begin to allow
other banks' customers to cash checks
for up to $40 in the Wells Fargo auto
matic tellers. "In order to do this they
will arrange for a purchased check cas
hing card for an annual $10 fee," said
Oppenheim.
All of the plans for remodeling and
updating of services will be in full op
eration for the tall, according to
Lattie.

The next move will be to
"consolidate and relocate our travel
services from three offices to one,"
said Oppenheim.
"No longer employing Sequoia has
something to do with major changes in
the travel industry, especially airline
deregulation. We're taking into con
sideration the overall needs of the
community and how to get the best
service at the lowest cost for the most

use to the Stanford community," Op
penheim said.
Ellen Friar, manager of Sequoia
Travel, said "We've not been given
any reasons why we're being replaced,
which is a little disconcerting. We stiii
haven't received any reply concerning
our visit to the President's Office.
"Our understanding last fall was
that Stanford was looking for a
preferred organization, but it never
occured to us that we would be ousted
from Tresidder. We hardly know what
to do, some of us have been here up to
16 years, and we've never advertised
outside of Stanford," Friar said.
"Suddenly telling 14 people that
they no longer have a job and giving
absolutely no provisions ... they've
simply gone and given our entire
clientele to someone else, giving us
nothing in writing since we met a few
days ago." Friar added.
"We have a lease with Sequoia typi
cal of all tenents. and it's due to expire
at the end of the summer. If Sequoia
chooses not to re-locate, we'll trv to

help them through their transition."
Oppenheim said.
The new travel office will be located
where Tresidder Ticket Office cur
rently stands, and the ticket office will
be housed temporarily in an office on
the first floor.
"In addition, we'll be adding a spe
cial lounge. It will be a fun and differ
ent space from what we've had in the
past. It will be carpeted, tiered plat
form seating that will lend itself to an
indoor amphitheatre effect. It will seat
around 25 to 30 people," Oppenheim
said.
"I'm crossing my fingers and hoping
that the current schedule for the first

part of the renovation will go as
planned. It's scheduled for completion
on Sept. 15. It's an aggressive
schedule, however 1 hope it will be ac
complished by the time school starts,"
said Oppenheim.
The funding for the first phase of
the renovation project is coming from
four to five different sources. The
Tresidder Union reserve fund, tenent
contributions, the General Plant Im
provement fund, the facilities reserve

fund and one anonymous gift to the
University arc all involved sources.
The second phase of the project in
volves such major changes as remov
ing the bowling alley, relocating and
shrinking the games area and relocat
ing The Store into the Coffee House
and game room space, according to
Oppenheim.
This phase of the plan is unlikely to
develop before fall of

deregulation. We're taking into con
sideration the overall needs of the
community and how to get the best
service at the lowest cost for the most

use to the Stanford community," Op
penheim said.
Ellen Friar, manager of Sequoia
Travel, said "We've not been given
any reasons why we're being replaced,
which is a little disconcerting. We stiii
haven't received any reply concerning
our visit to the President's Office.
"Our understanding last fall was
that Stanford was looking for a
preferred organization, but it never
occured to us that we would be ousted
from Tresidder. We hardly know what
to do, some of us have been here up to
16 years, and we've never advertised
outside of Stanford," Friar said.
"Suddenly telling 14 people that
they no longer have a job and giving
absolutely no provisions ... they've
simply gone and given our entire
clientele to someone else, giving us
nothing in writing since we met a few
days ago." Friar added.
"We have a lease with Sequoia typi
cal of all tenents. and it's due to expire
at the end of the summer. If Sequoia
chooses not to re-locate, we'll trv to

help them through their transition."
Oppenheim said.
The new travel office will be located
where Tresidder Ticket Office cur
rently stands, and the ticket office will
be housed temporarily in an office on
the first floor.
"In addition, we'll be adding a spe
cial lounge. It will be a fun and differ
ent space from what we've had in the
past. It will be carpeted, tiered plat
form seating that will lend itself to an
indoor amphitheatre effect. It will seat
around 25 to 30 people," Oppenheim
said.
"I'm crossing my fingers and hoping
that the current schedule for the first

part of the renovation will go as
planned. It's scheduled for completion
on Sept. 15. It's an aggressive
schedule, however 1 hope it will be ac
complished by the time school starts,"
said Oppenheim.
The funding for the first phase of
the renovation project is coming from
four to five different sources. The
Tresidder Union reserve fund, tenent
contributions, the General Plant Im
provement fund, the facilities reserve

fund and one anonymous gift to the
University arc all involved sources.
The second phase of the project in
volves such major changes as remov
ing the bowling alley, relocating and
shrinking the games area and relocat
ing The Store into the Coffee House
and game room space, according to
Oppenheim.
This phase of the plan is unlikely to
develop before fall of
