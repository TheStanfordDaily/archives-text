## The 						Stanford Daily Toward frat equity 
### 
At last, steps are being taken to correct the ine
qualities of the fraternity system at Stanford. The
community realizes that a problem exists, and
Stanford should be ready to respond.
The Task Force on Fraternities and Sororities
released six recommendations to the University
Friday. Although the recommendations are
unquestionably a step in the right direction, they
are somewhat vague and ambiguous. No
where in the report does the task force explicitly
recommend that residential fraternities be
prohibited or that all University housing should
be assigned through the Draw. These ideas are
implied, but the task force seems to be somewhat
intimidated. Here are some highlights of the task
force's report:
I he University should continue to recognize
subjectively selective student groups.
Hie task force admits that subjective selectivity
contradicts University policy, yet it still waffles on
the issue. A more assertive stance should be
adopted: Stanford should not recognize any resi
dential organization which uses only social
criteria to determine its membership.
Assignment to student housing may not he
denied based on the subjective judgments of cur
rent or former residents.
Does this mean that a Draw should be used to
fill the houses? Why isn't the task force more spe
cific?
The task force is aware of the commitment made
and support provided to fraternities by alumni,

and feels that whatever steps are taken to put these
recommendations into effect must take into consid
eration that commitment and support.
This is a very surprising recommendation. In
stead of being outraged by the fraternities' im
plicit threats of loss of alumni financial support,
the task force appears to have buckled under to
pressure. Decisions of such import to student lite
should not be influenced by the potential
withdrawal of alumni support. The University
should make its decisions based on human values,
not financial ones.
Regardless of the quality of the task force s
recommendations, strong organization and plan
ning in the University will be required to make
any changes. The administration of student
housing is terribly complex, and the logistics of
implementing significant changes are even more
considerable. A number of questions must be an
swered if residential fraternities are eliminated:
Should the houses be four-year dorms or up
perclass row houses; should the houses be all
male. co-ed or some of each; if they are co-ed
should the houses be filled 50-50 male-female or
should they just fill up according to the demands
of the Draw?
We hope the University recognizes the value of
the task force's report as far as it goes. We en
courage Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons to
accept the report's recommendations and
facilitate a smooth transition between the present
system and its more equitable successor.
