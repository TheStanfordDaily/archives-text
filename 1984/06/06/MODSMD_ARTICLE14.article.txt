# Improving the ASSU
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate's reputation is suffering.
Few students give it the respect that a student
senate would seemingly warrant. Comments from
around campus charge that the body is nothing
more than a self-gratifying, self-indulgent collec
tion of politicos pandering to the whims of its 40
or so members and not to the needs of the student
body.
Evidence of this problem abounds. Only 25 un
dergraduates sought to fill the 20 undergraduate
senatorial spots. Still fewer ran for the 20
graduate positions. And services like the highly
touted photo identification card and the shuttle to
the City too often got lost in yards of red tape and
pages of referendums.
Perhaps the ASSU's biggest problem, however,
lies not in its excessive bickering and bylaws, but
in the degree of devotion shown by its senators.
Attendance at senate meetings, while required of
all senators, has fallen to less than 50 percent
several times this year.
The senate has a system for penalizing senators
who are consistently derelict in their duties. A
senator can be displaced — moved to the end of
the voting list, behind the list of regulars and al
ternates — if he or she misses three meetings in a
row or five all year. This supposedly includes
committee and district meetings as well as the 14
regular senate meetings.
But senators acknowledge that attendance at
committee and district meetings is sporadic at
best, and the infrequent displacements come as a
result of missing regular senate meetings, not
committee or district. Still, five undergraduate
and four graduate senators were displaced this
year.
If the senate enforced its rules more tightly,
many more senators would be displaced, if not

suspended or expelled. The minutes of the senate
and committee meetings indicate that meetings
get sparser as the quarter progresses. Dorm resi
dents testify that the senators representing their
districts attend dorm meetings at the beginning of
each quarter, but not much thereafter (there are
some noteworthy and laudable exceptions).
In addition, senators can get "excused" from
meetings — and those little "Es" begin appear
ing in the minutes with increasing regularity —
when they know they cannot attend. Excuses
don't count toward displacement, suspension or
expulsion.
All this may seem unimportant, but the lack of
commitment can have an effect on the students.
Fewer than 10 of the 20 undergraduate senators
were present when the senate voted on which
groups would appear on the fee assessment ballot
and, in a different meeting, when the senate voted
on the status of the amendments to its constitu
tion. These are important issues, the kind for
which the senate primarily should exist.
We can blame the individual senators for not
showing up for important votes, or we can blame
the senate for allowing meetings to drag out five
or more hours, thereby encouraging senators to
leave before the vote occurs. In either case, it
becomes clear that the senate, motto withstand
ing, is not always working for us.
A member of last year's Council of Presidents
slate, after winning the election in April, 1983,
said, "We aren't happy with the present state of
the ASSU and the reputation it has with the stu
dent body. We want to improve that image." This
year the senate came a long way, but not far
enough. Senators have to show some commit
ment. and attendance at meetings seems like the
very least to ask for. We hope that next year's
senators give us at least that very least.
