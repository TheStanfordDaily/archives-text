# An election revolution
## 
### 
The old black woman was helped up to the
podium by a number of younger people, and
when she got there she spoke with one hand on
the podium to steady herself. Her hands shook
uncontrollably. She had just one thing to say: She
felt great.
Now. for the first time in her life, she was able
to see a black man being seriously considered tor
the presidency, she said. It was an inspiration to
her and would probably prove to be an inspiration
for many generations to come.
That black man is Jesse Jackson, the man who
is forgotten when most people talk about the two
man race for the Democratic nomination. But, as
Jackson's appearance in East Palo Alto last week
proved, he is revered by many. And the many
who revere him are not the type of people most
Stanford students associate with.
They are the the poor, the black, the Hispanics,
the Asians, the native Americans. Jesse Jackson
speaks the language of many of these people. For

get that he sounds like a Baptist preacher, forget
that he's not qualified for the job, forget that he
uses simplified language unbecoming to intellec
tuals, forget that racist America will never accept
a black man. His is one of the few voices that
speaks for those who are not able to speak for
themselves.
In this democracy where less than 60 percent of
the eligible voters cast a ballot for president, we
often forget who composes that other 40 percent.
They are not the wealthy. They are the people
Jackson speaks for.
Jackson will certainly not win the nomination
of the Democratic party. But there's a good rea
son all those people are following him to the polls
to to vote. It's the same reason that inspired the
old black woman to shuffle to the podium and
tremble.
That reason could very well trigger a revolution
in the future of democratic politics in the United
States.
