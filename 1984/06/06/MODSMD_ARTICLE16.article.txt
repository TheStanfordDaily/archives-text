# A 						rational animal bill
## 
### 
Last week the state Assembly's Governmental
Organization Committee voted 9-4 to defeat state
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti's bill
that would have required scientists to use only
animals especially bred for, and prohibiting the
use of pound animals in, research. We support the
committee's move and in doing so endorse an al
ternative bill proposed by Assemblyman William
Filante (R-Greenbrae).
Filante's bill — one supported by the Univer
sity — would permit the limited use of pound
animals in laboratory research. Instead of an all
or none philosophy, we believe that the Hlante
bill is a sensible compromise that would allow re
search by the University and other institutions to
continue with the limited use ol pound animals,
safeguarding the rights of people's lost pets.
The Filante measure, which will go before the
Senate this summer, states that pounds which

choose to supply animals for research must allow
pet owners who bring in animals to decide whe
ther they wish their animals to be used in re
search. In addition it prohibits research use of any
animal picked up by animal control officials if that
animal is wearing a collar, ID tag or any similar
evidence of ownership.
Filante's measure seems both humane to the
animal and beneficial to humans — research
would be done to benefit the future of mankind at
the expense of animals only when the animal is
unclaimed and certain to be destroyed by the
humane agency involved.
In comparison, the Roberti bill seems almost
reactionary. In the name of animal rights, all
pound animal research would come to an end.
While this measure may seem more humane at
first glance, it loses force when one realizes it for
bids research that might someday profit humanity
in general.
