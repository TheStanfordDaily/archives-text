## The
						cold war of world opinion 
### 
Robert Conquest recently warned
against the failure to realize that the
Soviet mindset is quite different from
ours. Here, from my personal experi
ence, are some illustrations of four
mindsets which affect international re
lations profoundly and which are of
special importance in the analysis of
East-West relations.
We have little information about
what Soviet citizens think, since Soviet

VIEWPOINT

opinion polls, such as they are, avoid
the really critical issues. All the
evidence suggests that, while the
Kremlin fights apathy and complaints,
our vision of Soviets seething with dis
sidence is a gross distortion. Most fol
low the party line loyally. Our picture
of a nation of inefficient drunkards is
wishful thinking. There is a sense of
patriotic duty largely lost in the West,
and, as for inefficiency. Soviet produc
tion surpasses that of the United
States, in many areas. Recall the not
far distant times when the Japanese
were ridiculed as being able to make
only cheap imitations of American
products.
The full realization of this came to
me when I traveled around the Soviet
Union with a young member of the
Academy of Sciences, where 1 was lec
turing. Day after day, Boris would
berate me with a hard devotion to the
party line which reminded me chill
ingly of the Nazi son of a German
family with which 1 lived in the 19305.
1 listened patiently and politely, until
one day I said: "Look Boris, no politi
cal system is perfect." He stared at me
with his steely eyes and said with
harsh, total conviction: "Prof.
Hilton, communism is perfect!"
His deep hatred of the United
States was matched with a total loyalty
to Moscow. When we were traveling
around Georgia, I asked our Georgian
hosts about the republic's governance.
"Who runs this and that?" I asked.
"We do," came the reply. I finally
asked, "Who controls the armed
forces in Georgia?" Again the answer
came, "We do." Boris, who had lis
tened to the conversation with
repressed anger, broke in and said in a
chilling way, "Everything here is run

from Moscow." Dead silence for
several minutes, then a change of sub
ject. Some Georgians we met mut
tered. "He's like the Na/is." How far
the non-Russians, such as the Mos
lems of Central Asia, are expressing
similar sentiments sotto voir we do
not know.
I have frequently lectured in the
universities of Western Europe, espe
cially France. Much as I love France,
and appreciate French hospitality, it
was not an altogether pleasant experi
ence. Whenever I criticized U.S.
foreign policy, I was loudly applauded.
When 1 defended it I was interrupted
repeatedly and rudely. Even in Swiss
universities the response was similar,
albeit not as loud.
This hostility, shrill or tacit, does
not reflect the totality of European
opinion, but it has the effect of creat-

ing paranoia among otherwise sane
American representatives abroa i.
Now back to the United States:
What do we find at our universities?
Despite the talk of student modera
tion, student organizations, which
control abundant funds for visiting
lecturers, organize programs from
which conservatives are excluded and
in which the United States is depicted
as the international villain. Informed
talk of a Soviet master plan to control
the world, or even stress on the inter
national Muscovite threat, is ridiculed
by people whose ignorance of world
affairs is appalling.
Our priorities are strange. Univer
sity administrators make scathing
speeches about born-again Christians
(who are inoffensive, and, in any case,
have a poor source of funds). They do
not take on groups who might becomq
dangerous (such as homosexuals). Nor

do the campus clergy, who have ful
minated against President Reagan,
who simply shakes his head sadly.
Secular thinkers may view the
homosexual lifestyle as simply an ac
ceptable variation, hut it is totally
alien to the Judeo-Christian tradition.
The silence of administration and
clergy become even more suspect
when a Dutch defender of pedophilia
with "consenting" children tours our
campuses speaking at the expense of
student organizations. In view of the
wave of exposes of child abuse, it is in
credible that it should he left to a few
mothers to protest. The gay and les
bian organizations invite prostitutes to
speak on our campuses, since
"liberation" is the order of the day.
This dangerous nonsense impinges
on international issues when a "Gay
and Lesbian Awareness (GAI.A)

Week" features a graduate student
who "came out of the closet" before
spending eight months doing research
in the Soviet Union, where he was
able "to experience gay life from a
first-hand perspective." The likes of
Boris will be confirmed in their anti-
Americanism. and a fresh tube of
paint will be in the hands of the Soviet
press artists who paint lurid pictures ot
the United States and its priorities.
During the Prague Spring, an
American news magazine celebrated
this triumph for Western democracy
with a cover picture of a hippie. Is this
what the West stands for? If so. Boris
is right. At least he realizes that inter
national relations are a deadly serious
affair, lie believes that in the end the
Soviet Union will win, and he is deter
mined that it should.
