# Task force raps frat selectivity
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The Task Force to Study Fraterni
ties and Sororities at Stanford recom
mended Friday that the University
deny self-selective fraternal organiza
tions housing privileges.
"Assignment to student housing
may not be denied based on the sub
jective judgments of current or former
residents," the task force concluded
after six months of deliberation.
The chief issue on which the 18-
member committee based its decision
was "who controls access to Univer
sity resources," according to Norm
Robinson, associate dean of Residen
tial Education.
"All fraternal groups, whether all
male, all-female or co-ed, should have
equal access to University resources,"
the task force advised.
The task force also suggested a time
limit of three years for dissolving fra
ternity housing on campus.
Task Force member Vance
McMahan, a senior who dissented
from the committee's majority
opinion, expressed his feelings on the
recommendations.
"I regret the task force's preoccupa
tion with the means fraternities use to
admit their members," he said. "With
me, the ends were most important. I
cared more whether the fraternities
fulfilled the educational objectives of
the University,"
Many statements in the task force's
report supported the rights of Stan
ford's fraternal organizations.

"The University should continue to
recognize subjectively selective stu
dent groups as long as they meet Uni
versity criteria," the report said. "The
University should acknowledge the
value provided students by fraternal
organizations and should afford them
University support and guidance."
Robinson, an ex-officio and thus
non-voting member of the committee,
said the decision to continue recogniz
ing fraternal organizations was the
most important recommendation.
"The feeling was that the University
should do more than tolerate fraterni
ties," he said. "They should work with
them to make them the best they can
be."
Robinson said he predicts "a great
deal of debate" before the University
takes any action. Nothing will be done
this summer, he added.
As a spokesman for Residential
Education. Robinson said he has not
determined a viable method for dis
solving fraternity housing.
"Our recommendations were policy
statements," he said. "We were not
concerned with methods of implemen
tation."
If the University ratifies the recom
mendation to stop housing fraterni
ties, Robinson said he will consult with
members of all affected groups before
changing the current system.
"Some thoughtful representatives
from those groups would be able to
provide useful suggestions for an im
