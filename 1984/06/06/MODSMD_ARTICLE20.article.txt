# In search of...them
## 
### 
They laughed when I told them of
my summer plans. But they laughed at
Columbus, too. I hey laughed at lots
ol people, ["hey always do. And I was
going to put an end to it.
I didn t know how long they'd been
around. Longer than me, of course.
Too long, by my standards. So I
packed my bags, left the resort hotel
ot higher education — the Stanford of
the West, I liked to call it — and began
my odyssey. Armed with nothing but
ideals, I went in search of . . . THEM!
I didn t like them very much, and
not knowing who they were made me
like them even less. They jumped at
you Irom newspapers, television
shows and your grandmother's lips.
1 hey decided what caused cancer,
who was winning elections and how
long you should wait before jumping
in the pool after eating. I hey said this
and they said that, and if you
disagreed with them, tough. Iry ar
guing with someone who isn't there.
You always lose.
I had a hunch that it was all a joke.
They didn't know anything more than
I did. I could just see them, sitting in a
bar. inventing new ways to frustrate
people everywhere.
"What did we make popular last
week?" one would say.
"Uh, Boy George, "I Hate Bum
perstick ,-rs' bumperstickers and
anorexia.
"nont Wendy's commer
cials!"
"Oh yeah. Those too."
"Let's say there are spider eggN in
Wendy's burgers."

"No, no, we've done that."
"Let's call ourselves a high official
who asked to remain unnamed and tell
everybody Fritz Mondale isn't boring
anymore."
"Great! Get the phone."
I wasn't going to take it anymore.
I'm no Reagan fan, but at least when
lie's running things I have someone to
hate. It's different when they make
decisions, because you look really silly
holding an "Anti-Them" rally. If you
speak out against them, they call you
paranoid. They said they were
impossible to beat, but what'd I know?
I was just a freshman.
They weren't hard to find. I just
tlew over the Bermuda Triangle a
couple of times until I disappeared.
My plane exploded, and I found
myself in a large hall. A pair of dol
phins guided me down the passage
way, towards a bright light.
"What's down there?" I asked.
"A bunch of Southern Californians
screwing in a light bulb," one of the
dolphins said.
"How many?"
"That's what we're trying to find
out."
We reached the room with the
Californians. Ten were trying to screw
in a light bulb, but they couldn't
manage.
"Maybe it's 11," one said.
Another joined the group. I wanted
to stay and see if 1 1 could do it, but
the dolphins pushed me forward. We
walked by a little cafe. Amelia Earhart
.uid Jimmy Hoffa were eating brie.

Leonard Nimoy jumped out from be
hind a bush, took their picture, and
ran off yelling, "I found her, I found
her!" 1 ducked as I (),()()() odd socks
tlew over my head. John Gait waved
at me, then went back to reading the
rules to Coke's Golden Caps game.
"Where are they?" I asked the dol
phins.
"I don't think you want to meet
them," one dolphin said. "It's bound
to be a let-down."
"I'm ready for anything," I said.
"Who are they? A woman, a black, a
cripple and a Jew? Unborn babies?
John Doe? God? Taxi drivers who've
had an education I can never hope to
have, even if they don't know where
Hawaii is?"
The dolphins scratched their heads
with their fins. "It's nothing like that,"
one said.
"They are here, aren't they?"
"Well "
"Yes, of course," the other jumped
in.
"Then I want to see them."
"They're quite busy," the first dol
phin said.
"I can imagine."
"They have an awful lot to do."
"Obviously," I said. "May 1 see
them?"
"Wait here," they said, and scurried
off.
So I'm waiting. And they'd better
be ready to do some explaining. I've
got a lot of questions. And I'm mad.
