# Editor's farewell
## 
### 
Back in February, in one of the first weeks of
this volume, an Associated Press reporter gave
me a call. He wanted to know about activism on
campus. He said that college students today are
much more apathetic than they had been when he
was in school 15 years before.
He wanted me to comment. He wanted me to
tell him why there weren't more protests. He
wanted to know why students didn't have the
same values today. 1 was sorry. I couldn't tell him.
At the time, I didn't know.
But it made me wonder. True, the closest thing
to a sit-in that had occurred on campus this year
was the protest over Meyer Library cutting its
hours — certainly not the exciting stuff of the
1960s and '70s.
But then this isn't 1965 or 1971. The United
States is not embroiled in the mess of Vietnam.
Blacks in Mississippi can vote in the elections.
The year is 1 954 . . . and students today are not
facing the same situation faced by their predeces
sors.
That doesn't mean students aren't interested in
the world around them. That doesn't mean that
students are no longer activists. And most impor
tantly, it doesn't mean that students are more
apathetic now than they were 15 years ago.
They may not be rioting and throwing rocks,
but they aren't hiding and cowering from today's
issues either. Students do not face the Vietnam
era's agenda of immediacy. They are, however,
facing an unstable economic and political climate
— and they are well aware of how these tensions
could explode at any time.
Awareness is the key here. Students do want to
know what the CIA is up to in Nicaragua, why the
Reagan administration insists on supporting the
government in El Salvador and what will happen

if the Persian Gulf s oil is cut off because of the
Iran-Iraq war. On campus they question plans for
a Reagan library, University treatment of labor
unions, the necessity of theme houses and frater
nities and even the use of proceeds from a campus
party.
In that regard, I hope that The Daily has
succeeded these past months in covering the com
munity's concerns. We have remained dedicated
to activity — to questioning and to learning. In
our news stories we sought to responsibly report
the important issues and events of campus. In our
editorials we took our stand and hopefully
provoked campus discussions. In your many let
ters and viewpoints we hope we allowed for a
meaningful exchange of ideas.
I thank everyone who ever took the time to
write a letter or call in. I am extremely grateful
to my friends who would corner me in classes or
at lunch to discuss issues or at other times would
let me ramble on about The Daily over beers.
Mostly, however, I am especially indebted to an
incredibly dedicated staff who make this paper
what it is every day. The product delivered on
campus is the result of an active group of many
motivated individuals — in the editorial office,
the business office and ASSU Typesetting —
working together for something in which they
believe. Hardly apathetic. It is a friendship I will
deeply miss.
I only wish I still had that reporter's phone
number. I think maybe I can answer his questions
now.
