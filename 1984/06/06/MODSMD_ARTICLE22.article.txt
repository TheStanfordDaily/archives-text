# The 						big three: power, prestige and money
## 
### 
"Always end things right" people have said
to me, but correctly terminating this one may
be a bit difficult. This is my last column and
the world still has Haws. I see no mammoth
changes in the subjects I wrote about earlier
— most television shows have yet to inspire
me, racism failed to disappear, Reagan failed
to become the champion of the poor and little
squirrels still have trouble with rude bikers.
So I did not change the world, but 1 hope I
at least made people think about topics and
opinions they had previously shrugged off or
ignored. And before 1 end this milestone in
history and donate my works to the archives. I
have just a tew more thoughts to express
about life's "simple" pleasures — power,
prestige and money.
Power
Everybody wants power hut too few people
have it. I am not talking about power to rule a
country or the power to influence future
generations. I am saying that too few people
control their own lives or the lives of their
children. The huge difference between the
living conditions of the man who punches the
time clock and the person who owns it is noth
ing more than a difference in power. Eco
nomic power keeps the rich richer and the
poor starving.
Blue collar workers all over the country suf
fer because of management's union husting
tactics which stem from the desire to keep as

much power as possible. Minorities suffer he
cause we do not have the economic power to
fully comhat housing and job discrimination.
Even though laws say this type of discrimina
tion is illegal, laws often lose their strength
when faced with reality. According to history,
the employers and the powerful will not fairly
share power unless forced to. No one readily
gives up the advantage and it will take time
and constant struggle before the disad
vantaged receive their fair freedom. We must
continue to fight and work for equality and
power.
Prestige
Ahhhh — the world loves you — you're

wonderful, you're a star. But why are you a
star? Do you have exceptional talent or do
you have exceptional talent plus the fact that
you never rock anybody's boat? The same
people who keep that stranglehold on power,
the same people who often run mercilessly
over the poor, are the very same people who
try to create our national heroes and
celebrities. Michael Jackson has talent —
beautiful talent, but what policies or actions
has he ever challenged? He is a national su
perstar and Thriller represents his superior
musical skills. Jackson receives more media
attention and praise from powerful people
than any artist 1 can remember.

Yet a few years ago, Stevie Wonder was
"Mr It." With songs like "Isn't She Lovely"
and "Sunshine of My Life," Stevie was a hero
and a national treasure. Then he began sing
ing songs which spoke out against unfair
housing, the refusal to recognize Martin Luth
er King's birthday and U.S. policies and atti
tudes concerning Africa. Though his records
still sold, the Grammys and the attention
stopped coming. He had grown too political.
He had upset the people with the "power" to
bestow "prestige."
Think about who you admire. Think about
who you consider to be prestigious. Ihink
about why certain people grab so much atten

tion and who continues to generate it. Think
about who gives these medals of honor and
certificates of praise.
Money
Do not expect me to say that money is not
important or that the best things in life are
free. Money is important and it is quite diffi
cult to enjoy the wonderful free thing of lift
when you are cold or hungry. Some of you
reading this column will one day have the
money and power to help those who need to
get back on solid economic ground. But what
are you going to do with the money? Will you
hoard it or will you use it to help?
1 hope that those of you who plan to hoard
it never get any. If you already have money, I
hope you lose it to someone more compas
sionate. You don't deserve it if you can jet
through this life without feeling for others.
Those of us who do care must work harder
to acquire the money we need to strengthen
and protect the down-trodden citizens. We
net *et the money to build security for our
selves. We need our own corporations, banks
and stores. We need the power that this inde
pendence will give us.
We n. ti, lit ,o this pov while
letting our prestige reside in the fact that we
care and that we are willing to help those truly
in need.
