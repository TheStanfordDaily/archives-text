## Personal inconvenience is the price we pay for personal freedom 
### 
I am not fond of fraternities.
Having lived for decades in their
immediate neighborhood, I have
suffered many indignities inflicted on
my by the "brothers" through the
years: From sleepless nights to savage
midday music, from empty beer cans
to reckless driv ing, from verbal abuse
to the occasional finger.
Nevertheless. I am disturbed by the
intolerance of their critics. Nowadays,
people seem less and less satisfied to
see their own views and values
respected. They are increasingly
obsessed with imposing them on
others. Civilized social arrangements
should allow for as much freedom as
possible to as many as possible. In
principle, those who wish to associate
through the Draw should be able to
do so through the Draw: and those
who wish to associate by other means
should be allowed to do so by other
means.
I wish I knew more about the
dispute and what's behind it. but if
fraternity critics must reach for a
common adjective ("subjective") and
endow it with an ud hoc pejorative
meaning, their case must be less than
overwhelming. The antonym of sub
jective is objective, and there is
hardly anything "objective" about the
Draw. The curious argument seems to
be: Because the fraternities' mode of
selection is somewhat capricious, let's
make selection even more capricious,
in fact, let's make it as capricious as
can be.
A measure of inconvenience is the
price we must sometimes pay for our
freedoms This is why I'm willing to
put up with fraternities, empty beer
cans and foul idioms notwithstanding.

No fun with sun
! fe ! a rest ' * * the
false notion which was presented on

the front page photograph "Fun with
the Sun" (Daily. May 31). which
depicts school teachers and their
students viewing last Wednesday's
partial eclipse of the sun through
exposed photographic film. This is a
very dangerous way to view the sun.
The sun's intensity is not effectively
reduced or increased during a partial
eclipse. The rumored danger most
people hear about at the time of an
eclipse is to account for the tendency
people have to look directly at the
sun in an attempt to see the eclipse.
The Daily has furthered the myth that
viewing the sun through exposed film
is safe. It is not, and a correction is
due to all who read the front page of
the Daily.
The danger in viewing the sun
during a solar eclipse, or at any time,
for that matter, is due to the invisible
infrared radiation of the sun which
damages the retina of the eye. By
using film to reduce the intensity of
light from the sun in the \isihle range
of the spectrum, the viewer may not
feel the infrared rays which pass
unattenuated through the film and
burn the sensitive retinal cells in the
eye. The only safe way to directly
view an eclipse is through welders'
glasses or through solar filters made
of aluminized glass. It is dangerous to
use exposed film and normal camera
filters, and the public should be made
aware tit this commonly misun
derstood danger.

Abortion rights
In the torrent ol pro-abortion mail
touched oil by Jason Matherlv's
column, there have been a number of
disturbing contentions.
112 irst, there's Tom Lyon arguing
that a fertilized egg is no different
from an individual sperm or egg. It
that's true. I wonder why test-tube

baby labs always implant fertilized
eggs in women's wombs, rather than a
single egg, or a sperm. There should
be no denying the fact that something
significant happens at conception: a
genetically unique and physically
distinct human being emerges. And it
is a human "being" even though we
can't, say, have lunch with it at En
cina Station.
Several letters raised the spectre of
"unwanted" babies, the clear implica
tion being that if a child is
"unwanted" (by whom?) then it is
better for it to die now rather than
run the risk of being abused later.
Not only is the solution out of
proportion to the potential problem,
but it is surprising that some people
think, in effect, that a child's worth is
contingent upon its parents' feelings.
Finally, many have argued that a
woman's right to control her body
outweighs the fetus' right to life. This
is arguable, of course, since inter
course is voluntary and its possible
consequences known to all. But for
those who hold to this approach the
problem is to justify the current U.S.
legal situation in which the fetus has
no legal standing under any circum
stances in which the mother wishes to
end its life. There is no balance of
rights here. Vet pro-abortion par
tisans resist even attempts to institute
such small sanctions on abortion as a
24-hour waiting period before the
procedure.
All in all. pro-abortion arguments
we've seen these past weeks are flimsy.
The compassionate answer to the
abortion dilemma is to change our
institutions and our ethos to encour
age women to bring their pregnancies
to term, rather than the unrestricted
access to abortion urged by so many
of The Daily's readers.

Library praise
On the eve of my graduating and
leaving Stanford, I would like to
make public my admiration and
gratitude to the staff of the
Math/Computer Science library and
in particular to Harry Llull. Richard
Manuckand Larry Lim. As a graduate
student in the Mathematics Depart
ment, I have found the library staff
unwaiveringly courteous, competent
and aggressively looking for ways to
help and encourage people to use the
library, and use it effectively. Here are
several examples.
Well before Socrates existed
publicly, the math library made
available several types of computer
ized literature searching and
publicized this capability with a num
ber of demonstrations set up in the
math department.
The library staff has made the
effort to be conversant with fairly
esoteric mathematical (and computer
science) terminology. More than once
this has been the decisive factor in my
tracking down, within a reasonable
amount of time, a published version
of some vaguely remembered
theorem.
Lists ot new books are
prominently displayed on bulletin
boards outside the library as well as
on the electronic bulletin board of the
SCORE computer.
I close this letter with what im
presses me the most about the
Math/CS library: The attitude of its
stall which is to get those books out
there being used, circulating (rather
than "protecting" the books from
being used, an attitude that I have
occasionally encountered elsewhere.)
My warmest thanks to the Math CS
library staff.

Closing Sequoia
I have just heard that Sequoia
Travel Center has been asked to
leave the Stanford campus. It seems
Stanford has decided to consolidate
its travel dollar (a decision that
should have been made years ago)
and choose one agency to handle its
travel arrangements. Although Se
quoia Travel would have been the
natural choice since it already oc
cupies space in Tresidder Union, the
University is rumored to have chosen
American Express as the "preferred"
agent. While I might take issue with
the choice — personal service from a
giant like Amex? — I do not under
stand why Sequoia has to be evicted.
American Express could not possibly
be interested in the student or leisure
traveler, a market that Sequoia has
served loyally for 22 years.
Aside from the convenience of
hav ing Sequoia Travel in Tresidder
Union, can you imagine American
Express, an enormous commercial
agency, remaining open for 20 hours
a day for 10 days during the United
Airlines Christmas strike of 1975?
Sequoia did. It was a stunning exam
ple of loyalty to a community. Can
you imagine American Express spon
soring hot air balloons to promote the
spring, Christmas and other faires at
Tresidder? Giv ing away free trans
portation and hotel accommodations
to a fraternity to raise money? Be
coming a member of the Stanford
Committee for Art. The Stanford
Music Guild, the Alumni Continuing
Education Program? Extending credit
to students to purchase air transpor
tation for interview trips? Sequoia
has. does and would have continued
to do so. However, it seems they will
not.
The University is putting 14 people
out of work, some with long associa
tions to Stanford, and has given away
the clientele of a small business.

Distorted opinions
In 1 he Daily of Wednesday. May
30. Steve Phillips writes of Jesse
Jackson: "He does not share Presi
dent Reagan's and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's belief that all
cultures should assimilate into the
Anglo-Western culture."
That is a complete mischaracteriza
tion of my views. Steve Phillips has
never asked me what I think about
this matter; I have never stated any
thing like the belief he attributes to
me; and I have never even thought it.
I find it appalling that a person will
write, and a newspaper then
obediently print, flagrant misstate
ments of a person's views without
even t;iking the trouble to check
them.

Non-donation
We would like to briefly comment
on the viewpoint "Party proceeds
destined for literacy campaign"
(Daily, June 1).
Our dorm. Granada, did not
donate money to the benefit party
which Synergy held as a fund-raiser
for the Sandinista Defense Commit
tee in Nicaragua. We would not want
people to incorrectly think otherwise.
Moreover, it is our contention that
dorm funding should be used exclu
sively for dorm programming — and
not lor making political statements.
Even a small number of people
should not be forced to contribute
money to a political cause with which
they do not agree.
