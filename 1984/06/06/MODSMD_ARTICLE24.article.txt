## Erik Thompson: In the business of wisdom swapping 
### GLYNIS COSTIN 
He wiped the sweat olt his forehead and peered down
intense!) at the two men standing before him. "Ms there
anything for which you would die?" he asked them. It was
the day before Memorial Day and the Stanford campus
was hot and still.
I he men paused. "I think so ... yes I would die for
some things, sure," one of them answered.
"Is there anything for which you would kill?" his green
eyes were probing, intense, but he was more concerned
with the reasons for their answers than the answers them
selves.
Most people know Erik Thompson, by sight if not b\
name, as the guy who stands on a gray milk crate in White
Plaza and "preaches" to people 011 Sunday afternoons.
Milk-crate philosophizing, however ("What Erik does is
not preaching." said one friend), is but one of the many
pastimes of Thompson, a second year student at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business.

Many people are surprised when they find out that
Thompson is a Business School student or that he is a
Stanford student at all.
But in addition to the MBA he will receive this June,
Thompson has two other Stanford degrees — a bachelor's
degree in economics and political science and a master's
degree from the Food Research Institute. His Stanford
education has been interrupted only once in the past eight
years, when he spent a year in Micronesia as a volunteer
for the Peace Corps in 1979-KO.

It wasn't your typical barefoot-in-the-\illage Peace
Corp experience." he said. "I worked with the legislature
on economic development issues and designed a coconut
processing plant."
He was also a liaison officer for the Governor of Truk
and the speaker of the state legislature 011 their state visit
txi Nauru, 112 iji. American Samoa. Tahiti and Hawaii.
"It confirmed my interest in working on economic de
velopment in a micro state," he said. That is one of the
reasons he decided to get an MBA.
"I needed to get credentials. Hven if I had good ideas,
ex-patriots wouldn't consider me it I didn't have enough
letters after my name." he said. "And there were still some
things I could learn about corporate and public manage
ment. which I could adapt for my own use."
"Erik is a very unique person." said Ahmed Moinud
den. one of I hompson's classmates at the Business School.
"His attitude toward the world and materialism is \er\ un
usual tor a Westerner, especially a business school student.

'Erik is a very
unique person.
His attitude
toward the
world and
materialism is
very unusual
for a West
erner, espe
cially a business
school student.
The concept of
"I'm going to
make a million
dollars before
I'm 35 years
old" is com
pletely foreign
to him. He's got
more important
things on his
mind.'

The concept of I'm going to make a million dollars before
I'm 35 years old' is completely foreign to him. He's got
more important things on his mind."
Jane Udall, another classmate, agreed. "Most of us at
the Business School go through interviews with commer
cial or investment banks or consulting firms for large cor
porations during our second year, but you'd never see Erik
at the Placement Center in a gray suit." she said.
Instead of a watch, he wears a silver bracelet on his left
hand, identifying himself as an organ donor. "So in case I

act wasted. I won't be wasted. - ' he said, smiling.
Mis locker at the Business School is decorated vvith poli
tical cartoons, "ranginu from liberal to radical." according
to Udall.
But it is his public speaking that makes many people see
him as a bit zany and which may have prompted one Busi
ness School student to call him "an odd duck."
While some may think of him as a religious tanatic or ail
exhibitionist, however, those who know him well describe
him as brilliant, enlightened, sincere and focused, among a
long string of other complimentary adjectives.
Erik is amused, but unconcerned about the way others
perceive him.
Justice, peace, freedom and self-improvement are more
important to him than his reputation and these are the
kinds of things he has been discussing in White Plaza tor
the past three years.
"I don't talk it there's nobody listening. Ihompson
said. "I usually have a certain topic in mind, depending
upon what book I'm reading."
Most people pass him by without a second glance.
Others look at him curiously . A few people approach him.
Thompson said about 1 percent ot the people who go
through White Plaza will talk to him.
"But I don't mind." he said, "that way. I get to talk to a
lot Of interesting people. Oddly enough, its also one ol the
places where I'm least likely to be disturbed — no phones
ringing, no unwanted interruptions."
He said that he does only about 30 percent ot the talking
himself, because, "Stanford students love to talk.
A vear ago. Noah Noviek. an undergraduate, w as 011 his
\sa\ home from the library feeling upset about .1 paper he
was working on when he decided to talk to I hompson.
"I saw I rik standing there and decided that was what he
was there for. so I went up and started talking to him. In
stead of asking me what my paper was 011 or what class it
was for. he asked me why it was important to me. lie
helped me put it into perspective."
Noviek believes that Thompson adds to the intellectual
environment at Stanford by offering a social torum lor
casual but intellectual conversations.
"It's also ;m advanced kind of psychotherapy." Nov iek
said.
Thompson was introduced to this form of public speak
ing while on an overseas studies program in the tall ol
at what was then Stanford's Britain campus.
Cliveden
Dunne his first week there, he became intrigued by the
people whi stood on "speaker's corner." in London's
Hvde Park
There would be about 50 speakers out on any Sun
day . Thompson said. "Some were comedians, some were
religious, some were political and then there was this guy.
He was talking about why people didn't have to lead petty
lives."'
Thompson said he did not like the way the man
responded to questions from the audience so he went
home that night and prepared an argument of why the man
was wrong.
"But when I returned the following Sunday, he had
changed books." Thompson said.
He kept returning, however, and eventually became
friends with the man. who was a teacher at a school for
boys. Two summers later, he stayed with the man and
began speaking himself.
Thompson didn't start speaking on White Pla/.a,
however, until winter of J9N2.
A person's first question to him is usually about what he
is doing. Depending on his mood, his responses vary.
"I might say something like. I'm talking about truth,
justice and the American way.' " he said. "Or if there are a
lot of vendors out. I might say, 'I'm dealing in wisdom, do
you have any you'd like to swap?' "
"If people want to talk trivia. I'll talk trivia." he said.
"But there are certain things that I think really should be
raised on campus."
For these "certain things," Thompson breaks out of his
usual formula of mutual dialect and reads out loud all day
long, whether he has an audience or not. On Martin Luth
er King's birthday, for example, he read King's speeches.
On "regular" days, he quotes from the works of
philosophers such as Kahil Gibran and authors such as Leo
Tolstoy. He also relates "Sufi" stories, which he likes be

In addition to working for peace. Thompson has also
been heavily involved in campaigning against hunger. Last
summer lie worked as an intern for the Ecumenical
Hunger Program in l ast Palo Alto, through the Stanford
Management Internship Fund (SMIF).
He has also participated in several "walk-a-thons" in
order to raise money for the program. This April he raised

soft-spoken. Irving to compliment him is like playing a
game of hot potato or boomerang. He somehow manages
to redirect the credit or praise to someone else.
Of his hunger program fund raising, he said smiling. "I
j ust had generous donors And he stressed the fact thai
his business school peers paid for his summer internship.
I le would also rather discuss politics or religion than his
personal life.
As Ins former college roommate and friend of eight
years. John MeClintok. put it. "lie doesn't wear his inner
feelings on his sleeve."
John's wife. Flaine. agreed. "It's funny, he'll call on the
phone and just sit there waiting for you to say something,
lie's really a listener more than a talker."
Ironic, for a man known as a "speaker."
"He's very disciplined," said Novick. "He's always
trying to improve himself, mentally and physically."
Thompson wakes up every morning between 4 and
5 a.m. — a habit he got used to while working on a ranch
when he was 15 — and reads until 6 or 6:30 a.m. Then he
shelves books at the Food Research Institute library, "so I
can afford to drink beers." he said.
It is sometimes hard to know when he is kidding and
when he is being serious and he seems to enjoy playing the
devil's advocate.
"He may be smiling and laughing at you, but he looking
at you seriously," said Moinudden. "He won't display his
true feelings through his expressions. I think maybe he's
playing a game."
Novick agreed. "Lrik never loses his poise." he said.
'.'No inultcr whut situalion he's in. he's abwn s culm, gatxi
looking and speaks well and intelligently.'
When the Business School students were asked to fill in
three captions for their yearbook, Thompson wrote,
"Origin: a small tow n. Destiny : a small island. Key to Suc
cess: a willingness to fail."
"This is so different from the way most of us feel." said
Udall."Erik is willing to take risks. He realizes that people
do make mistakes and that people learn from the mistakes
they make."
"What could you say ves to that would make you willing
to accept everything?" he asked a bystander on White
Plaza.
"Death." the woman said.
"Close," he replied. "But I was talking about life. That's
what I'm try ing to accept right now. the big"l..' "He made
a gesture in the air like a bird flying across the sky. "Not
my life, just life."

Most people know Erik Thompson, by sight if not b\
name, as the guy who stands on a gray milk crate in White
Plaza and "preaches" to people 011 Sunday afternoons.
Milk-crate philosophizing, however ("What Erik does is
not preaching." said one friend), is but one of the many
pastimes of Thompson, a second year student at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business.

Many people are surprised when they find out that
Thompson is a Business School student or that he is a
Stanford student at all.
But in addition to the MBA he will receive this June,
Thompson has two other Stanford degrees — a bachelor's
degree in economics and political science and a master's
degree from the Food Research Institute. His Stanford
education has been interrupted only once in the past eight
years, when he spent a year in Micronesia as a volunteer
for the Peace Corps in 1979-KO.

ex-patriots wouldn't consider me it I didn't have enough
letters after my name." he said. "And there were still some
things I could learn about corporate and public manage

"Erik is a very unique person." said Ahmed Moinud

"His attitude toward the world and materialism is \er\ un

Jane Udall, another classmate, agreed. "Most of us at
the Business School go through interviews with commer
cial or investment banks or consulting firms for large cor
porations during our second year, but you'd never see Erik
at the Placement Center in a gray suit." she said.
Instead of a watch, he wears a silver bracelet on his left
hand, identifying himself as an organ donor. "So in case I

act wasted. I won't be wasted. - ' he said, smiling.
Mis locker at the Business School is decorated vvith poli
tical cartoons, "ranginu from liberal to radical." according
to Udall.
But it is his public speaking that makes many people see
him as a bit zany and which may have prompted one Busi
ness School student to call him "an odd duck."
While some may think of him as a religious tanatic or ail
exhibitionist, however, those who know him well describe
him as brilliant, enlightened, sincere and focused, among a
long string of other complimentary adjectives.
Erik is amused, but unconcerned about the way others
perceive him.
Justice, peace, freedom and self-improvement are more
important to him than his reputation and these are the
kinds of things he has been discussing in White Plaza tor
the past three years.
"I don't talk it there's nobody listening. Ihompson
said. "I usually have a certain topic in mind, depending
upon what book I'm reading."
Most people pass him by without a second glance.
Others look at him curiously . A few people approach him.
Thompson said about 1 percent ot the people who go
through White Plaza will talk to him.
"But I don't mind." he said, "that way. I get to talk to a
lot Of interesting people. Oddly enough, its also one ol the
places where I'm least likely to be disturbed — no phones
ringing, no unwanted interruptions."
He said that he does only about 30 percent ot the talking
himself, because, "Stanford students love to talk.
A vear ago. Noah Noviek. an undergraduate, w as 011 his
\sa\ home from the library feeling upset about .1 paper he
was working on when he decided to talk to I hompson.
"I saw I rik standing there and decided that was what he
was there for. so I went up and started talking to him. In
stead of asking me what my paper was 011 or what class it
was for. he asked me why it was important to me. lie
helped me put it into perspective."
Noviek believes that Thompson adds to the intellectual
environment at Stanford by offering a social torum lor
casual but intellectual conversations.
"It's also ;m advanced kind of psychotherapy." Nov iek
said.
Thompson was introduced to this form of public speak
ing while on an overseas studies program in the tall ol
at what was then Stanford's Britain campus.
Cliveden
Dunne his first week there, he became intrigued by the
people whi stood on "speaker's corner." in London's
Hvde Park
There would be about 50 speakers out on any Sun
day . Thompson said. "Some were comedians, some were
religious, some were political and then there was this guy.
He was talking about why people didn't have to lead petty
lives."'
Thompson said he did not like the way the man
responded to questions from the audience so he went
home that night and prepared an argument of why the man
was wrong.
"But when I returned the following Sunday, he had
changed books." Thompson said.
He kept returning, however, and eventually became
friends with the man. who was a teacher at a school for
boys. Two summers later, he stayed with the man and
began speaking himself.
Thompson didn't start speaking on White Pla/.a,
however, until winter of J9N2.
A person's first question to him is usually about what he
is doing. Depending on his mood, his responses vary.
"I might say something like. I'm talking about truth,
justice and the American way.' " he said. "Or if there are a
lot of vendors out. I might say, 'I'm dealing in wisdom, do
you have any you'd like to swap?' "
"If people want to talk trivia. I'll talk trivia." he said.
"But there are certain things that I think really should be
raised on campus."
For these "certain things," Thompson breaks out of his
usual formula of mutual dialect and reads out loud all day
long, whether he has an audience or not. On Martin Luth
er King's birthday, for example, he read King's speeches.
On "regular" days, he quotes from the works of
philosophers such as Kahil Gibran and authors such as Leo
Tolstoy. He also relates "Sufi" stories, which he likes be

to Udall.
But it is his public speaking that makes many people see
him as a bit zany and which may have prompted one Busi
ness School student to call him "an odd duck."
While some may think of him as a religious tanatic or ail
exhibitionist, however, those who know him well describe
him as brilliant, enlightened, sincere and focused, among a
long string of other complimentary adjectives.
Erik is amused, but unconcerned about the way others
perceive him.
Justice, peace, freedom and self-improvement are more
important to him than his reputation and these are the
kinds of things he has been discussing in White Plaza tor
the past three years.
"I don't talk it there's nobody listening. Ihompson
said. "I usually have a certain topic in mind, depending
upon what book I'm reading."
Most people pass him by without a second glance.
Others look at him curiously . A few people approach him.
Thompson said about 1 percent ot the people who go
through White Plaza will talk to him.
"But I don't mind." he said, "that way. I get to talk to a
lot Of interesting people. Oddly enough, its also one ol the
places where I'm least likely to be disturbed — no phones
ringing, no unwanted interruptions."
He said that he does only about 30 percent ot the talking
himself, because, "Stanford students love to talk.
A vear ago. Noah Noviek. an undergraduate, w as 011 his
\sa\ home from the library feeling upset about .1 paper he
was working on when he decided to talk to I hompson.
"I saw I rik standing there and decided that was what he
was there for. so I went up and started talking to him. In
stead of asking me what my paper was 011 or what class it
was for. he asked me why it was important to me. lie
helped me put it into perspective."
Noviek believes that Thompson adds to the intellectual
environment at Stanford by offering a social torum lor
casual but intellectual conversations.
"It's also ;m advanced kind of psychotherapy." Nov iek
said.
Thompson was introduced to this form of public speak
ing while on an overseas studies program in the tall ol
at what was then Stanford's Britain campus.

people whi stood on "speaker's corner." in London's
Hvde Park
There would be about 50 speakers out on any Sun
day . Thompson said. "Some were comedians, some were
religious, some were political and then there was this guy.
He was talking about why people didn't have to lead petty
lives."'
Thompson said he did not like the way the man
responded to questions from the audience so he went
home that night and prepared an argument of why the man
was wrong.
"But when I returned the following Sunday, he had
changed books." Thompson said.
He kept returning, however, and eventually became
friends with the man. who was a teacher at a school for
boys. Two summers later, he stayed with the man and
began speaking himself.
Thompson didn't start speaking on White Pla/.a,
however, until winter of J9N2.
A person's first question to him is usually about what he
is doing. Depending on his mood, his responses vary.
"I might say something like. I'm talking about truth,
justice and the American way.' " he said. "Or if there are a
lot of vendors out. I might say, 'I'm dealing in wisdom, do
you have any you'd like to swap?' "
"If people want to talk trivia. I'll talk trivia." he said.
"But there are certain things that I think really should be
raised on campus."
For these "certain things," Thompson breaks out of his
usual formula of mutual dialect and reads out loud all day
long, whether he has an audience or not. On Martin Luth
er King's birthday, for example, he read King's speeches.
On "regular" days, he quotes from the works of
philosophers such as Kahil Gibran and authors such as Leo
Tolstoy. He also relates "Sufi" stories, which he likes be

years. John MeClintok. put it. "lie doesn't wear his inner

John's wife. Flaine. agreed. "It's funny, he'll call on the
phone and just sit there waiting for you to say something,
lie's really a listener more than a talker."
Ironic, for a man known as a "speaker."
"He's very disciplined," said Novick. "He's always
trying to improve himself, mentally and physically."
Thompson wakes up every morning between 4 and
5 a.m. — a habit he got used to while working on a ranch
when he was 15 — and reads until 6 or 6:30 a.m. Then he
shelves books at the Food Research Institute library, "so I
can afford to drink beers." he said.
It is sometimes hard to know when he is kidding and
when he is being serious and he seems to enjoy playing the
devil's advocate.
"He may be smiling and laughing at you, but he looking
at you seriously," said Moinudden. "He won't display his
true feelings through his expressions. I think maybe he's
playing a game."
Novick agreed. "Lrik never loses his poise." he said.
'.'No inultcr whut situalion he's in. he's abwn s culm, gatxi

When the Business School students were asked to fill in
three captions for their yearbook, Thompson wrote,
"Origin: a small tow n. Destiny : a small island. Key to Suc
cess: a willingness to fail."
"This is so different from the way most of us feel." said
Udall."Erik is willing to take risks. He realizes that people
do make mistakes and that people learn from the mistakes
they make."
"What could you say ves to that would make you willing
to accept everything?" he asked a bystander on White
Plaza.
"Death." the woman said.
"Close," he replied. "But I was talking about life. That's
what I'm try ing to accept right now. the big"l..' "He made
a gesture in the air like a bird flying across the sky. "Not
my life, just life."

He wiped the sweat olt his forehead and peered down
intense!) at the two men standing before him. "Ms there
anything for which you would die?" he asked them. It was
the day before Memorial Day and the Stanford campus
was hot and still.
I he men paused. "I think so ... yes I would die for
some things, sure," one of them answered.
"Is there anything for which you would kill?" his green
eyes were probing, intense, but he was more concerned
with the reasons for their answers than the answers them
selves.
Most people know Erik Thompson, by sight if not b\
name, as the guy who stands on a gray milk crate in White
Plaza and "preaches" to people 011 Sunday afternoons.
Milk-crate philosophizing, however ("What Erik does is
not preaching." said one friend), is but one of the many
pastimes of Thompson, a second year student at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business.

Many people are surprised when they find out that
Thompson is a Business School student or that he is a
Stanford student at all.
But in addition to the MBA he will receive this June,
Thompson has two other Stanford degrees — a bachelor's
degree in economics and political science and a master's
degree from the Food Research Institute. His Stanford
education has been interrupted only once in the past eight
years, when he spent a year in Micronesia as a volunteer
for the Peace Corps in 1979-KO.

It wasn't your typical barefoot-in-the-\illage Peace
Corp experience." he said. "I worked with the legislature
on economic development issues and designed a coconut
processing plant."
He was also a liaison officer for the Governor of Truk
and the speaker of the state legislature 011 their state visit
txi Nauru, 112 iji. American Samoa. Tahiti and Hawaii.
"It confirmed my interest in working on economic de
velopment in a micro state," he said. That is one of the
reasons he decided to get an MBA.
"I needed to get credentials. Hven if I had good ideas,
ex-patriots wouldn't consider me it I didn't have enough
letters after my name." he said. "And there were still some
things I could learn about corporate and public manage
ment. which I could adapt for my own use."
"Erik is a very unique person." said Ahmed Moinud
den. one of I hompson's classmates at the Business School.
"His attitude toward the world and materialism is \er\ un
usual tor a Westerner, especially a business school student.

'Erik is a very
unique person.
His attitude
toward the
world and
materialism is
very unusual
for a West
erner, espe
cially a business
school student.
The concept of
"I'm going to
make a million
dollars before
I'm 35 years
old" is com
pletely foreign
to him. He's got
more important
things on his
mind.'

I'm 35 years old' is completely foreign to him. He's got
more important things on his mind."
Jane Udall, another classmate, agreed. "Most of us at
the Business School go through interviews with commer
cial or investment banks or consulting firms for large cor
porations during our second year, but you'd never see Erik
at the Placement Center in a gray suit." she said.
