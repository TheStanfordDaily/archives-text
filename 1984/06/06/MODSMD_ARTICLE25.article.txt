# 'Big siblings' provide role models for needy youth
## 
### VIRGINIA GUISER 
"They're not a lot of tangible
rewards and you don't get a lot
of pats on the hack. It's more
just a inner thing, seeing the kid
grow, seeing what kind of influ
ence you're having on him."
For sophomore Tom Ren
nard, that is why he spends at
least one day a week going to
the beach, watching a baseball
game or seeing a movie with his
"little brother," an eight-year
old boy from a single-parent
family. "It gives the boy an op
portunity to get out of the house
and do things he might not or
dinarily do," Rennard said.
Rennard was matched with
his little brother, Soto, through
the Big Brother/Big Sister pro
gram in Palo Alto.
About 30 Stanford students,
as well as a number of staff,
volunteer as big brothers or
sisters for Peninsula six to 13-
year-olds, mostly from families
headed by single women.
"We're dealing with single
parent families where the adult
is stretched to her (sometimes
his) limits," said Jim Gorman,
the casework supervisor for the
nonprofit program. "A volun
teer can be a role model, a lis
tener and a companion who
provides the child with a sense
of knowing someone else is
there who cares about him. It is
someone who takes the load off
the single parent."
Gorman added that a year's
commitment is required of the
volunteers because they "don't
want to let down some kid who
has been let down so many
times before."
The Big Brother/Big Sister
agency, along with Partners,
Inc. and Volunteers in Youth, is
one of three area programs
pairing economically and/or
emotionally deprived children
with adult friends. Stanford stu
dents comprise approximately
125 of their volunteers.

Twenty of those students are
volunteers with Partners. Of all
the programs, it is geared to
help the most troubled children,
according to Lorraine Stevens,
the on-campus liaison for the
northern Santa Clara County
agency.
A senior economics major.
Stevens said "senior partners"

are matched with children aged
10 to 18, who "are having prob
lems in school or with the law."
Sometimes the kids need an
other role model in addition to
their own older brothers or
sisters who may be having prob
lems, she added.
The children are referred to
Partners by probation officers.

school counselors, parents and
teachers. Joining the program,
however, is not mandatory for
the kids. "It is fully voluntary,
which makes it more fun for the
junior and senjor partner,"
Steven said.
Since the program helps
troubled children, staff coun
selors are available 24 hours a

day to assist the senior partners.
"That's a security for students
to know because we're inexperi
enced," Stevens said. "If we
don't know how to handle a par
ticular situation, the Partners's
counselors are there."
A senior partner herself,
Stevens said she spends three to
five hours per week with her 14-

year-old junior partner, Vicky.
They talk on the phone or go
bowling or out to dinner.
Recently they visited the Ex
ploratorium.
Occasionally, all the volun
teers and their junior partners
get together for picnics or
bowling days at Tresidder,
Stevens said.

"It's really fun for me to go
out with my junior partner and
know she sees the time as really
special," Stevens said. "It's
been neat to he a sister to a girl
whose parents and friends are
often not there for her." Stevens
added that the most rewarding
thing for a senior partner is
seeing "a real friendship and
trust develop between her and
her junior partner."
While Joyce Moore par
ticipates in a different program
— Volunteers in Youth — she
also expressed a sense of spe
cialness about her relationship
with her 15-year-old little sister
of three years, Justine.
"I am someone who cares and
is close to her own age, but is
old enough that she can
respect," Moore said. "I like
Justine as a person. I like to see
her change and grow."
Unlike Partners, however,
Volunteers in Youth does not
have the capacity to handle kids
with serious problems, accor
ding to Moore, one of the pro
gram's six student directors. The
program is unique among the
three in that it is run entirely by
students.
"We are basically for kids
who need to have their self
esteem uplifted or need role
models to follow," Moore said.
"They need a little extra help."
Now a nationwide program
sponsored by the NCAA, Vol
unteers in Youth originated at
Stanford in 1969. Then and now
the program matches Stanford
athletes with kids from two of
Palo Alto's junior high schools,
Wilbur and Jordan.
"We've found that the kids
really identify with athletes,"
Moore said. "It gives them
something in common, some
thing they can connect with. The
kids tend to respect varsity ath
letes. These are their heroes."

"little brother," an eight-year
old boy from a single-parent
family. "It gives the boy an op
portunity to get out of the house
and do things he might not or
dinarily do," Rennard said.
Rennard was matched with
his little brother, Soto, through
the Big Brother/Big Sister pro
gram in Palo Alto.
About 30 Stanford students,
as well as a number of staff,
volunteer as big brothers or
sisters for Peninsula six to 13-
year-olds, mostly from families
headed by single women.
"We're dealing with single
parent families where the adult
is stretched to her (sometimes
his) limits," said Jim Gorman,
the casework supervisor for the
nonprofit program. "A volun
teer can be a role model, a lis
tener and a companion who
provides the child with a sense
of knowing someone else is
there who cares about him. It is
someone who takes the load off
the single parent."
Gorman added that a year's
commitment is required of the
volunteers because they "don't
want to let down some kid who
has been let down so many
times before."
The Big Brother/Big Sister
agency, along with Partners,
Inc. and Volunteers in Youth, is
one of three area programs
pairing economically and/or
emotionally deprived children
with adult friends. Stanford stu
dents comprise approximately
125 of their volunteers.

Twenty of those students are
volunteers with Partners. Of all
the programs, it is geared to
help the most troubled children,
according to Lorraine Stevens,
the on-campus liaison for the
northern Santa Clara County
agency.
A senior economics major.
Stevens said "senior partners"

are matched with children aged
10 to 18, who "are having prob
lems in school or with the law."
Sometimes the kids need an
other role model in addition to
their own older brothers or
sisters who may be having prob
lems, she added.
The children are referred to
Partners by probation officers.

school counselors, parents and
teachers. Joining the program,
however, is not mandatory for
the kids. "It is fully voluntary,
which makes it more fun for the
junior and senjor partner,"
Steven said.
Since the program helps
troubled children, staff coun
selors are available 24 hours a

day to assist the senior partners.
"That's a security for students
to know because we're inexperi
enced," Stevens said. "If we
don't know how to handle a par
ticular situation, the Partners's
counselors are there."
A senior partner herself,
Stevens said she spends three to
five hours per week with her 14-

year-old junior partner, Vicky.
They talk on the phone or go
bowling or out to dinner.
Recently they visited the Ex
ploratorium.
Occasionally, all the volun
teers and their junior partners
get together for picnics or
bowling days at Tresidder,
Stevens said.

"It's really fun for me to go
out with my junior partner and
know she sees the time as really
special," Stevens said. "It's
been neat to he a sister to a girl
whose parents and friends are
often not there for her." Stevens
added that the most rewarding
thing for a senior partner is
seeing "a real friendship and
trust develop between her and
her junior partner."
While Joyce Moore par
ticipates in a different program
— Volunteers in Youth — she
also expressed a sense of spe
cialness about her relationship
with her 15-year-old little sister
of three years, Justine.
"I am someone who cares and
is close to her own age, but is
old enough that she can
respect," Moore said. "I like
Justine as a person. I like to see
her change and grow."
Unlike Partners, however,
Volunteers in Youth does not
have the capacity to handle kids
with serious problems, accor
ding to Moore, one of the pro
gram's six student directors. The
program is unique among the
three in that it is run entirely by
students.
"We are basically for kids
who need to have their self
esteem uplifted or need role
models to follow," Moore said.
"They need a little extra help."
Now a nationwide program
sponsored by the NCAA, Vol
unteers in Youth originated at
Stanford in 1969. Then and now
the program matches Stanford
athletes with kids from two of
Palo Alto's junior high schools,
Wilbur and Jordan.
"We've found that the kids
really identify with athletes,"
Moore said. "It gives them
something in common, some
thing they can connect with. The
kids tend to respect varsity ath
letes. These are their heroes."
