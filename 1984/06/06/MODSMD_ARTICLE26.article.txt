# Plans to tackle heart disease cure next
## Two Nobels later, Linus Pauling still full of spunk 
### CATHERINE ROMERO 
He is a dynamic man at age 83 with the en
ergy of a spunky kid. Linus Pauling s enthusi
asm for learning has taken him far in lite —
from the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry to the
1962 Nobel Peace Prize to his many
remarkable discoveries about vitamin C .
"Interest in what I'm doing." Pauling said,
is what keeps him going. "And. of course, the
lot of invitations that 1 get. Some ot them 1
can't turn down." Pauling recently returned
from Rhode Island where he lectured on
chemistry and will soon be going to the Uni
versity of Denver. A week later he will travel
to Moscow for a biochemical meeting and
then to West Germany to talk on nuclear
peace.
In between his many travels he frequently
lectures at Stanford for different organizations
and classes. Just yesterday he lectured on
nutrition for the Optimal Health and Fitness
class.

But Pauling's ties to the Farm go much
deeper than lecturing. From 1969 to 1974
Pauling taught chemistry at Stanford and he is
now a professor emeritus of chemistry. Before
his Stanford days he first taught chemistry at
Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon
State University), where he received a B.S. in
chemical engineering. He then went on to
receive his Ph.D. in chemistry at Cal Tech. and
later worked his way up to chairman of the
Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engi
neering before he left Cal Tech in 1964.
It was during his professorship at Cal Tech
that Pauling received his two Nobel Prizes, the
first of which, in chemistry, was for his work
on the chemical bond. "I used quantum me
chanical ideas to get a better understanding of
the nature of the chemical bond," Pauling
said. His work on bonding included calculat
ing the now well-known electronegativity of
atoms.
Shortly before receiving his first Nobel

Prize, Pauling became involved in politics
and peace. During the unstable 1950s
era of McCarthyism, Pauling was viewed as a
threat to anti-Communist fanatics. At that
time the Royal Society of London was holding
a symposium on his work and wanted him to
give the opening speech. Pauling was unable
to attend, however, because the government
refused to issue him a passport.
"All that 1 could get out of the government
was that it was not in the best interests of the
United States to talk about the need for world
peace," Pauling explained. By 1954, he was
finally able to get a passport in order to
receive his Nobel Prize in chemistry.
But McCarthyism soon faded out, making it
easier for Pauling to speak out against war and
nuclear testing and he was again awarded the
Nobel Prize, this time for peace, in 1962, for
his work on halting bomb testing. Coinciden
tally, he received the award on the same day
that the tripartite test ban treaty between the

United States, the Soviet Union and Great
Britain was signed.
•'I wasn't involved with government olti
cials directly about the test ban treaty.
Pauling said. "My work was largely with the
public."
It was this second Nobel Prize which meant
the most to Pauling. "The peace prize I trea
sure more." Pauling said. Before. "I was just
enjoying myself working on chemistry, study
ing new ideas about the chemical bond and
carrying out experiments and so on — having
a good time and here I get the Nobel Prize in
chemistry."
Alter he left Cal Tech. Pauling went to UC-
San Diego to teach chemistry and was then of
fered a professorship at Stanford. He accepted

even though, at 6N, he was already past retire
ment age. "I've always liked Stanford,
Pauling said. "Ever sinee the 1920s I ve had
friends in the Stanford C hemistry Depart
ment."
Pauling now does research at the Linus
Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine not
far from campus and continues to speak on
nuclear issues. "I'd like to see the United
States take the lead in moving toward world
peace and rationality," Pauling said. He
believes that if the United States initiates a
peace movement the Soviet Union will follow.
"The people of the Soviet Union and the
leaders of the Soviet Union are far more eager
to avoid war and to have peace than we are."
Pauling said.
An ideal situation, Pauling believes, would
be one where "two different systems
cooperate and get along side by side and try to
improve themselves. Incorporate those
aspects of the other system that have value
and get rid of the undesirable aspects of each
system," Pauling said. ' T hat is what I work
for."
But Pauling realizes that he cannot do the
work himself. "Everyone should do every
thing that he can in relation to working for
world peace. Participate in demonstrations,
marches and things like that. Write letters,
and especially apply pressure on candidates to
state where they stand and then vote for the
people that are working for world peace."
Aside from all the energy he puts into
achieving peace, Pauling also works toward im-

proving health. He has done numerous studies
on vitamin C. colds, intluen/a and cancer and
has made some remarkable discoveries. "It
you take enough vitamin C you can surpress
any cold." Pauling said. Just how much is
enough? That varies from person to person.
However, according to Pauling, vitamin C is
not harmful in large amounts. "It acts as a
laxative in most people, but there are no
harmful side effects." Pauling said. "I take
200 times what the authorities recommend. I
take 12.000 mg a day and the RDA
(recommended daily allowance) is 60 mg a
day."
Vitamin C also works toward increasing the
energy and lengthening the life of cancer
patients, accoring to Pauling. He and his col
league Ewan Cameron believe that vitamin C
is essential for producing a substance in
muscles that increases the muscle s energy.
"The conclusion that Dr. Cameron and I
have reached is that every patient with cancer
benefits by taking large doses of vitamin C
along with whatever conventional therapy is
appropriate for his or her condition, Pauling

said. "I think we've done the job in that field,
but the medical profession still is holding
back, slow to respond."
Now that Pauling is finished with his vita

tackling heart disease, the nation's No. I kil
ler. ••I've been working on cancer for 10 years.
I think it would be worthwhile to work on
heart disease, because it's such an important
disease," Pauling said.
Heart disease, cancer, nuclear war
Pauling almost seems to be out to save the
world from its major problems. Will he ever
give up? Unlikely. With true Pauling deter
mination, he says, "1 11 keep on working. Ot
that, we can all be sure.

ing the now well-known electronegativity of
atoms.
Shortly before receiving his first Nobel

Prize, Pauling became involved in politics
and peace. During the unstable 1950s
era of McCarthyism, Pauling was viewed as a
threat to anti-Communist fanatics. At that
time the Royal Society of London was holding
a symposium on his work and wanted him to
give the opening speech. Pauling was unable
to attend, however, because the government
refused to issue him a passport.
"All that 1 could get out of the government
was that it was not in the best interests of the
United States to talk about the need for world
peace," Pauling explained. By 1954, he was
finally able to get a passport in order to
receive his Nobel Prize in chemistry.
But McCarthyism soon faded out, making it
easier for Pauling to speak out against war and
nuclear testing and he was again awarded the
Nobel Prize, this time for peace, in 1962, for
his work on halting bomb testing. Coinciden
tally, he received the award on the same day
that the tripartite test ban treaty between the

United States, the Soviet Union and Great
Britain was signed.
•'I wasn't involved with government olti
cials directly about the test ban treaty.
Pauling said. "My work was largely with the
public."
It was this second Nobel Prize which meant
the most to Pauling. "The peace prize I trea
sure more." Pauling said. Before. "I was just
enjoying myself working on chemistry, study
ing new ideas about the chemical bond and
carrying out experiments and so on — having
a good time and here I get the Nobel Prize in
chemistry."

San Diego to teach chemistry and was then of

even though, at 6N, he was already past retire

Pauling said. "Ever sinee the 1920s I ve had
friends in the Stanford C hemistry Depart
ment."
Pauling now does research at the Linus
Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine not
far from campus and continues to speak on
nuclear issues. "I'd like to see the United
States take the lead in moving toward world
peace and rationality," Pauling said. He
believes that if the United States initiates a
peace movement the Soviet Union will follow.
"The people of the Soviet Union and the
leaders of the Soviet Union are far more eager
to avoid war and to have peace than we are."
Pauling said.
An ideal situation, Pauling believes, would
be one where "two different systems
cooperate and get along side by side and try to
improve themselves. Incorporate those
aspects of the other system that have value
and get rid of the undesirable aspects of each
system," Pauling said. ' T hat is what I work
for."
But Pauling realizes that he cannot do the
work himself. "Everyone should do every
thing that he can in relation to working for
world peace. Participate in demonstrations,
marches and things like that. Write letters,
and especially apply pressure on candidates to
state where they stand and then vote for the
people that are working for world peace."
Aside from all the energy he puts into
achieving peace, Pauling also works toward im-

on vitamin C. colds, intluen/a and cancer and
has made some remarkable discoveries. "It
you take enough vitamin C you can surpress
any cold." Pauling said. Just how much is
enough? That varies from person to person.
However, according to Pauling, vitamin C is
not harmful in large amounts. "It acts as a
laxative in most people, but there are no
harmful side effects." Pauling said. "I take
200 times what the authorities recommend. I
take 12.000 mg a day and the RDA
(recommended daily allowance) is 60 mg a
day."
Vitamin C also works toward increasing the
energy and lengthening the life of cancer
patients, accoring to Pauling. He and his col
league Ewan Cameron believe that vitamin C
is essential for producing a substance in
muscles that increases the muscle s energy.
"The conclusion that Dr. Cameron and I
have reached is that every patient with cancer
benefits by taking large doses of vitamin C
along with whatever conventional therapy is
appropriate for his or her condition, Pauling

I think it would be worthwhile to work on

At 83, Prof. Emeritus Linus Pauling continues to travel the world and peace, he is also currently looking for a cure to heart
promoting peace. Winner of the Nobel Prize in both chemistry disease.
He is a dynamic man at age 83 with the en
ergy of a spunky kid. Linus Pauling s enthusi
asm for learning has taken him far in lite —
from the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry to the
1962 Nobel Peace Prize to his many
remarkable discoveries about vitamin C .
"Interest in what I'm doing." Pauling said,
is what keeps him going. "And. of course, the
lot of invitations that 1 get. Some ot them 1
can't turn down." Pauling recently returned
from Rhode Island where he lectured on
chemistry and will soon be going to the Uni
versity of Denver. A week later he will travel
to Moscow for a biochemical meeting and
then to West Germany to talk on nuclear
peace.
In between his many travels he frequently
lectures at Stanford for different organizations
and classes. Just yesterday he lectured on
nutrition for the Optimal Health and Fitness
class.

But Pauling's ties to the Farm go much
deeper than lecturing. From 1969 to 1974
Pauling taught chemistry at Stanford and he is
now a professor emeritus of chemistry. Before
his Stanford days he first taught chemistry at
Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon
State University), where he received a B.S. in
chemical engineering. He then went on to
receive his Ph.D. in chemistry at Cal Tech. and
later worked his way up to chairman of the
Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engi
neering before he left Cal Tech in 1964.
It was during his professorship at Cal Tech
that Pauling received his two Nobel Prizes, the
first of which, in chemistry, was for his work
on the chemical bond. "I used quantum me
chanical ideas to get a better understanding of
the nature of the chemical bond," Pauling
said. His work on bonding included calculat
ing the now well-known electronegativity of
atoms.
