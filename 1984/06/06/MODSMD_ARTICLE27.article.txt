# Cross-country bicyclists tackle adventure head-on
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer Adventure 
Especially at this time of year, many
of us yearn for it. We want to go some
place new, do something daring.
Hollywood filmmakers have long
understood this yearning, capitalizing
on it every year with films like Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom and
Star Wars in which brave young ad
venturers journey to faraway places to
face unknown hardships and do battle
with the forces of evil. In the process,
these adventurers learn about them
selves, about life and about human na
ture.
But in recent summers, vicarious
adventurism wasn't enough for four
Stanford students. So, like the heroes
in adventure movies, Andrew
Fitzhugh set out last summer and
Glenn Hallam, Chris Norte and Steve
Perez the summer before, to face the
unknown.
Their mission? To cross the entire
continental United States by bicycle.
Although the two trips differed in
many respects, each cyclist encoun
tered hard times, new places, new
people and emotional ups and downs
that made for some extraordinary ex
periences. And the same spirit of ad
venture will propel them on long rides
this summer that will give them a fix of
adventure once again.
The differences between the two
trips are striking. Fitzhugh, a member
of the Stanford cycling team and a tri
athlete, rode alone; Hallam, Norte
and Perez traveled together. Fitzhugh
saw his ride as a training experience
that would improve his racing skills;
Hallam, Norte and Perez viewed their

1 ride as a touring experience that
would allow them to see new places
and meet new people.
Their different approaches to the
ride led them to choose different
routes and time frames. Fitzhugh fol
lowed a path that led him from
Florence, Ore., directly across the
country to his home state of New
York. He rested only three days the
entire trip — once in Yellowstone
when he was having knee problems
and two days visiting relatives in Min
neapolis, where he arrived after two
weeks, feeling "totaled." Fitzhugh
rode with an odometer on his bike and
pushed himself to pedal at least 100
miles every riding day, no matter
what.

He completed the ride in exactly
one month.
For Hullam, Norte and Perez, the
ride took twice as long. They started
off with their tires symbolically dipped
in the ocean at Sloat Beach in San
Francisco and headed across the Mid
west, traversing 14 states and winding
up at the nation's capital, where the
trio finally separated. The three shared
many more non-riding days than
Fitzhugh and varied their mileage
from a low of 12 one day to a high of
140 on another, averaging about 86
miles per riding day, according to
Norte's calculations.
In spite of the different natures of
their rides, Fitzhugh and the self
proclaimed "Transamerica Dream
ers" faced many similar chal
lenges, road weariness and difficult
riding conditions among them.
The Dreamers found themselves in
bad weather on many occasions, in
cluding their first day. Perez explained
that the winds were so strong that day
that he and Norte were "blown off the
side of the road into the delta." Perez
said he then rolled down an incline
and climbed up only to be blown down
a second time.
"Sometimes I think back and it's
amazing that I wasn't discouraged,"
said Perez, who had never even been
on an overnight ride before, "but I

guess I was just too excited."
Excitement alone, though, would
not seem to he enough to keep them
going throughout the trip. Perez spoke
of a "terrible," day's ride through cold
wind and rain in the Appalachian
Mountains, Norte mentioned the "SO
to 85 percent sweltering humidity" ac
companied by mosquitos in the Mid
west and all three mentioned the in
credibly steep grades in the Ozark
Mountains.
One of the worst days of the trip,
mentioned by all three in separate in
terviews, was a day of intense heat in
the desert in Utah in which the three
pedaled 107 miles without passing
anything but sagebrush, rocks and
mountains. Pedaling up a hill which
they said seemed to last forever, the
three riders were hot and thirsty, and

to make matters worse, they kept
being passed by trucks filled with
Coors beer.
"I was ready to start crying," Perez
said. "I said I was going to go to the
top without stopping or die trying. It's
a good thing my tire blew out," he
added, "or I would have died trying."
Like the heroes of an adventure
film, the cyclists had to develop a cer
tain attitude in the face of adversity.
But the dreamers learned to deal
with adversity through humor. Hallam
said they were good at "taking our
selves with a grain of salt and laughing
at everything. We would laugh at the
stupidest things," he said, "but that
was what was so beautiful about it."
Another way of coping was to
become absorbed in something that
diverted the mind.
Fitzhugh said he liked concentrating
on the act of riding itself. "I'd think
about what my body was doing, how it
felt, how the road was passing under
my wheels," he said.
y

The riders had to rely on one an
other, beeause they faced more than
just physical hardships. Midway
through the ride, Norte learned that
his father had died of cancer. Norte,
who had been expecting the news,
flew back to California for the funeral
while Hallam and Perez rode on.
After the funeral, Norte flew back
to continue the trip, as his father had
encouraged him to do. He caught up
with the others after several days of
riding which included six consecutive
century rides — 100 miles — and
"massive mood swings."
Throughout the ride the dreamers
relied on each other for support. All
three said that they got along ex
tremely well, rarely bickering and con
stantly joking.
Novelty was another source of
courage. Hallam and Perez said they
knew the next day's journey would
bring them to a new and completely
different place with different people.
Norte said his faith in human nature
was restored.
"It was great to know that (the next
day) you could meet someone you'd

a
really like," said Perez, adding en
thusiastically, "We met the most fan
tastic people."
Fitzhugh said his favorite place was
the town of Bennett, Idaho, which
consisted of a trailer, a bar and a few
people who lived nearby. He arrived
there after climbing out of the flat
lowlands to the top of some snow
capped moutains.
"It was dead quiet, isolated from all
life," he said, adding, "The people
who lived there belonged to the
mountains." As Fitzhugh sat in
his tent that evening, a few people
wandered by one at a time to tell him
about Bennett and about their lives.
"One guy told me the story of his
whole life. One guy once drove to
L.A. and he told me absolute horror
stories about driving on the
freeways. . . . They were true mountain
people. . . . They lived in an isolated
place and loved it and were proud of
it. They were some of the most
hospitable people."
The a.dventurers were also
propeled by a desire to discover new
horizons. The landscapes they crossed
varied greatly to include expanses of
barren desert land, farming land with
fields of corn and wheat and pristine
forest lands.
Fitzhugh, who had never before

traveled in the West, found the
beauty inspiring.
"You see things in National Geo
graphic and the pictures themselves
are awesome, but when you stick
yourself in it, it's just indescribable,"
he said.
Unlike the denouement of most
movies, the end of both trips was des
cribed as anticlimactic because the
cyclists were too tired to be enthusias
tic. Fitzhugh pedaled to his home in
New York, Hallam stayed in Washing
ton, D.C. to sightsee and meet his con
gressman and Perez flew to New
York.
Norte, however, was determined to
reach the Atlantic, so he set out on his
own for Rehoboth Beach, Del.
But for the second time on his trip,
disaster struck. At 10:15 p.m., despite
the three bike lights Norte said he had
aimed towards the rear, he was hit by
a car which then tied the scene. When
Norte regained consciousness half an
hour later, he discovered he was mis
sing a front tooth, had a gash under
one eye and his bike — with one shoe
still in the toeclip — was demolished
and strewn across the pavement.
"Everything that could break was
broken except me," he said.
Still, with the spirit of a true adven
turer, Norte describes the trip as an

exciting, positive experience. He
spoke about his adventures with the
enthusiasm and animation of a true
storyteller. "It pointed out things in
me that I didn't know were there." he
said.
Fitzhugh said he did have some
regrets about his trip, namely that the
whole idea for the ride was "kind of
stupid." He said that because racing
and touring involve entirely different
styles of riding, his training was actu
ally set back and he had to work extra
hard to regain his speed and learn how
to ride without heavy weights again.
Still, Fitzhugh said, going across the
country was a "definable event in my
life," and it "solidified a lot of ideas
about what I like, like peace and
quiet."
Like Norte, both Perez and and
Hallam seemed to look back on the
trip with a certain amount of nostalgia.
Perez reminisced about the
pleasures of meeting so many
"fantastic" and different people each
day of the ride.
Hallam talked of the way the ride
appealed to the senses, since there was
no windshield to separate the rider
from the world around him. "You
smell everything, you feel the wind,
you feel the mountains that you go up
and down."

Especially at this time of year, many
of us yearn for it. We want to go some

York. He rested only three days the
entire trip — once in Yellowstone
when he was having knee problems
and two days visiting relatives in Min
neapolis, where he arrived after two
weeks, feeling "totaled." Fitzhugh
rode with an odometer on his bike and
pushed himself to pedal at least 100
miles every riding day, no matter
what.

He completed the ride in exactly
one month.
For Hullam, Norte and Perez, the
ride took twice as long. They started
off with their tires symbolically dipped
in the ocean at Sloat Beach in San
Francisco and headed across the Mid
west, traversing 14 states and winding
up at the nation's capital, where the
trio finally separated. The three shared
many more non-riding days than
Fitzhugh and varied their mileage
from a low of 12 one day to a high of
140 on another, averaging about 86
miles per riding day, according to
Norte's calculations.
In spite of the different natures of
their rides, Fitzhugh and the self
proclaimed "Transamerica Dream
ers" faced many similar chal
lenges, road weariness and difficult
riding conditions among them.
The Dreamers found themselves in
bad weather on many occasions, in
cluding their first day. Perez explained
that the winds were so strong that day
that he and Norte were "blown off the
side of the road into the delta." Perez
said he then rolled down an incline
and climbed up only to be blown down
a second time.
"Sometimes I think back and it's
amazing that I wasn't discouraged,"
said Perez, who had never even been
on an overnight ride before, "but I

guess I was just too excited."
Excitement alone, though, would
not seem to he enough to keep them
going throughout the trip. Perez spoke
of a "terrible," day's ride through cold
wind and rain in the Appalachian
Mountains, Norte mentioned the "SO
to 85 percent sweltering humidity" ac
companied by mosquitos in the Mid
west and all three mentioned the in
credibly steep grades in the Ozark
Mountains.
One of the worst days of the trip,
mentioned by all three in separate in
terviews, was a day of intense heat in
the desert in Utah in which the three
pedaled 107 miles without passing
anything but sagebrush, rocks and
mountains. Pedaling up a hill which
they said seemed to last forever, the
three riders were hot and thirsty, and

to make matters worse, they kept
being passed by trucks filled with
Coors beer.
"I was ready to start crying," Perez
said. "I said I was going to go to the
top without stopping or die trying. It's
a good thing my tire blew out," he
added, "or I would have died trying."
Like the heroes of an adventure
film, the cyclists had to develop a cer
tain attitude in the face of adversity.
But the dreamers learned to deal
with adversity through humor. Hallam
said they were good at "taking our
selves with a grain of salt and laughing
at everything. We would laugh at the
stupidest things," he said, "but that
was what was so beautiful about it."
Another way of coping was to
become absorbed in something that
diverted the mind.
Fitzhugh said he liked concentrating
on the act of riding itself. "I'd think
about what my body was doing, how it
felt, how the road was passing under
my wheels," he said.
y

The riders had to rely on one an
other, beeause they faced more than
just physical hardships. Midway
through the ride, Norte learned that
his father had died of cancer. Norte,
who had been expecting the news,
flew back to California for the funeral
while Hallam and Perez rode on.
After the funeral, Norte flew back
to continue the trip, as his father had
encouraged him to do. He caught up
with the others after several days of
riding which included six consecutive
century rides — 100 miles — and
"massive mood swings."
Throughout the ride the dreamers
relied on each other for support. All
three said that they got along ex
tremely well, rarely bickering and con
stantly joking.
Novelty was another source of
courage. Hallam and Perez said they
knew the next day's journey would
bring them to a new and completely
different place with different people.
Norte said his faith in human nature
was restored.
"It was great to know that (the next
day) you could meet someone you'd

a
really like," said Perez, adding en
thusiastically, "We met the most fan
tastic people."
Fitzhugh said his favorite place was
the town of Bennett, Idaho, which
consisted of a trailer, a bar and a few
people who lived nearby. He arrived
there after climbing out of the flat
lowlands to the top of some snow
capped moutains.
"It was dead quiet, isolated from all
life," he said, adding, "The people
who lived there belonged to the
mountains." As Fitzhugh sat in
his tent that evening, a few people
wandered by one at a time to tell him
about Bennett and about their lives.
"One guy told me the story of his
whole life. One guy once drove to
L.A. and he told me absolute horror
stories about driving on the
freeways. . . . They were true mountain
people. . . . They lived in an isolated
place and loved it and were proud of
it. They were some of the most
hospitable people."
The a.dventurers were also
propeled by a desire to discover new
horizons. The landscapes they crossed
varied greatly to include expanses of
barren desert land, farming land with
fields of corn and wheat and pristine
forest lands.
Fitzhugh, who had never before

traveled in the West, found the
beauty inspiring.
"You see things in National Geo
graphic and the pictures themselves
are awesome, but when you stick
yourself in it, it's just indescribable,"
he said.
Unlike the denouement of most
movies, the end of both trips was des
cribed as anticlimactic because the
cyclists were too tired to be enthusias
tic. Fitzhugh pedaled to his home in
New York, Hallam stayed in Washing
ton, D.C. to sightsee and meet his con
gressman and Perez flew to New
York.
Norte, however, was determined to
reach the Atlantic, so he set out on his
own for Rehoboth Beach, Del.
But for the second time on his trip,
disaster struck. At 10:15 p.m., despite
the three bike lights Norte said he had
aimed towards the rear, he was hit by
a car which then tied the scene. When
Norte regained consciousness half an
hour later, he discovered he was mis
sing a front tooth, had a gash under
one eye and his bike — with one shoe
still in the toeclip — was demolished
and strewn across the pavement.
"Everything that could break was
broken except me," he said.
Still, with the spirit of a true adven
turer, Norte describes the trip as an

exciting, positive experience. He
spoke about his adventures with the
enthusiasm and animation of a true
storyteller. "It pointed out things in
me that I didn't know were there." he
said.
Fitzhugh said he did have some
regrets about his trip, namely that the
whole idea for the ride was "kind of
stupid." He said that because racing
and touring involve entirely different
styles of riding, his training was actu
ally set back and he had to work extra
hard to regain his speed and learn how
to ride without heavy weights again.
Still, Fitzhugh said, going across the
country was a "definable event in my
life," and it "solidified a lot of ideas
about what I like, like peace and
quiet."
Like Norte, both Perez and and
Hallam seemed to look back on the
trip with a certain amount of nostalgia.
Perez reminisced about the
pleasures of meeting so many
"fantastic" and different people each
day of the ride.
Hallam talked of the way the ride
appealed to the senses, since there was
no windshield to separate the rider
from the world around him. "You
smell everything, you feel the wind,
you feel the mountains that you go up
and down."

Especially at this time of year, many
of us yearn for it. We want to go some
place new, do something daring.
Hollywood filmmakers have long
understood this yearning, capitalizing
on it every year with films like Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom and
Star Wars in which brave young ad
venturers journey to faraway places to
face unknown hardships and do battle
with the forces of evil. In the process,
these adventurers learn about them
selves, about life and about human na
ture.
But in recent summers, vicarious
adventurism wasn't enough for four
Stanford students. So, like the heroes
in adventure movies, Andrew
Fitzhugh set out last summer and
Glenn Hallam, Chris Norte and Steve
Perez the summer before, to face the
unknown.
Their mission? To cross the entire
continental United States by bicycle.
Although the two trips differed in
many respects, each cyclist encoun
tered hard times, new places, new
people and emotional ups and downs
that made for some extraordinary ex
periences. And the same spirit of ad
venture will propel them on long rides
this summer that will give them a fix of
adventure once again.
The differences between the two
trips are striking. Fitzhugh, a member
of the Stanford cycling team and a tri
athlete, rode alone; Hallam, Norte
and Perez traveled together. Fitzhugh
saw his ride as a training experience
that would improve his racing skills;
Hallam, Norte and Perez viewed their

1 ride as a touring experience that
would allow them to see new places
and meet new people.
Their different approaches to the
ride led them to choose different
routes and time frames. Fitzhugh fol
lowed a path that led him from
Florence, Ore., directly across the

of a "terrible," day's ride through cold
wind and rain in the Appalachian
Mountains, Norte mentioned the "SO
to 85 percent sweltering humidity" ac
companied by mosquitos in the Mid
west and all three mentioned the in
credibly steep grades in the Ozark
Mountains.
One of the worst days of the trip,
mentioned by all three in separate in
terviews, was a day of intense heat in
the desert in Utah in which the three
pedaled 107 miles without passing
anything but sagebrush, rocks and
mountains. Pedaling up a hill which
they said seemed to last forever, the
three riders were hot and thirsty, and

to make matters worse, they kept
being passed by trucks filled with
Coors beer.
"I was ready to start crying," Perez
said. "I said I was going to go to the
top without stopping or die trying. It's
a good thing my tire blew out," he
added, "or I would have died trying."
Like the heroes of an adventure
film, the cyclists had to develop a cer
tain attitude in the face of adversity.
But the dreamers learned to deal
with adversity through humor. Hallam
said they were good at "taking our
selves with a grain of salt and laughing
at everything. We would laugh at the
stupidest things," he said, "but that
was what was so beautiful about it."
Another way of coping was to
become absorbed in something that
diverted the mind.
Fitzhugh said he liked concentrating
on the act of riding itself. "I'd think
about what my body was doing, how it
felt, how the road was passing under
my wheels," he said.

The riders had to rely on one an
other, beeause they faced more than
just physical hardships. Midway
through the ride, Norte learned that
his father had died of cancer. Norte,
who had been expecting the news,
flew back to California for the funeral
while Hallam and Perez rode on.
After the funeral, Norte flew back
to continue the trip, as his father had
encouraged him to do. He caught up
with the others after several days of
riding which included six consecutive
century rides — 100 miles — and
"massive mood swings."
Throughout the ride the dreamers
relied on each other for support. All
three said that they got along ex
tremely well, rarely bickering and con
stantly joking.
Novelty was another source of
courage. Hallam and Perez said they
knew the next day's journey would
bring them to a new and completely
different place with different people.
Norte said his faith in human nature
was restored.
"It was great to know that (the next
day) you could meet someone you'd

a
really like," said Perez, adding en
thusiastically, "We met the most fan
tastic people."
Fitzhugh said his favorite place was
the town of Bennett, Idaho, which
consisted of a trailer, a bar and a few
people who lived nearby. He arrived
there after climbing out of the flat
lowlands to the top of some snow
capped moutains.
"It was dead quiet, isolated from all
life," he said, adding, "The people
who lived there belonged to the
mountains." As Fitzhugh sat in
his tent that evening, a few people
wandered by one at a time to tell him
about Bennett and about their lives.
"One guy told me the story of his
whole life. One guy once drove to
L.A. and he told me absolute horror
stories about driving on the
freeways. . . . They were true mountain
people. . . . They lived in an isolated
place and loved it and were proud of
it. They were some of the most
hospitable people."
The a.dventurers were also
propeled by a desire to discover new
horizons. The landscapes they crossed
varied greatly to include expanses of
barren desert land, farming land with
fields of corn and wheat and pristine
forest lands.
Fitzhugh, who had never before

traveled in the West, found the
beauty inspiring.
"You see things in National Geo
graphic and the pictures themselves
are awesome, but when you stick
yourself in it, it's just indescribable,"
he said.
Unlike the denouement of most
movies, the end of both trips was des
cribed as anticlimactic because the
cyclists were too tired to be enthusias
tic. Fitzhugh pedaled to his home in
New York, Hallam stayed in Washing
ton, D.C. to sightsee and meet his con
gressman and Perez flew to New
York.
Norte, however, was determined to
reach the Atlantic, so he set out on his
own for Rehoboth Beach, Del.
But for the second time on his trip,
disaster struck. At 10:15 p.m., despite
the three bike lights Norte said he had
aimed towards the rear, he was hit by
a car which then tied the scene. When
Norte regained consciousness half an
hour later, he discovered he was mis
sing a front tooth, had a gash under
one eye and his bike — with one shoe
still in the toeclip — was demolished
and strewn across the pavement.
"Everything that could break was
broken except me," he said.
Still, with the spirit of a true adven
turer, Norte describes the trip as an

exciting, positive experience. He
spoke about his adventures with the
enthusiasm and animation of a true
storyteller. "It pointed out things in
me that I didn't know were there." he
said.
Fitzhugh said he did have some
regrets about his trip, namely that the
whole idea for the ride was "kind of
stupid." He said that because racing
and touring involve entirely different
styles of riding, his training was actu
ally set back and he had to work extra
hard to regain his speed and learn how
to ride without heavy weights again.
Still, Fitzhugh said, going across the
country was a "definable event in my
life," and it "solidified a lot of ideas
about what I like, like peace and
quiet."
Like Norte, both Perez and and
Hallam seemed to look back on the
trip with a certain amount of nostalgia.
Perez reminisced about the
pleasures of meeting so many
"fantastic" and different people each
day of the ride.
Hallam talked of the way the ride
appealed to the senses, since there was
no windshield to separate the rider
from the world around him. "You
smell everything, you feel the wind,
you feel the mountains that you go up
and down."
