### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
Senior staff writer
Provost Albert Hastorf tn«s rejected the tenure
appeal of Religious Studies Pro'. Pan.', j
I'aol said yesterday she will now take her appeal o
• lie tira' stage of the University's process, an advi
sory board to University President Donald Ken
nedy.
"As soon as I get the document written i: will go
to the advisory board," she said.
And if that appeal is also denied, "My lawyer
and I will be consulting and filing charges (against
the University) in court by July 1," she said.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, who is serving as
Paul's grievance counselor, said, "The advisory
board to the president is the final step . For all
practical purposes they make the decision. On

these academic matters Kennedy always follows
their advice."
But Rebholz remains hopeful about Paul's
ci mevs. They have ihe power to leview and
change the decision of all the previous levels in the
grievance process, and I hope they will," he said.
But if they do not. Rebholz supports Paul's deci
sion to take the case to court."I think the case has
merit and that previous decisions have left some
questions unanswered ... 1 think the case is so
good it has to go to court,"he said.
Paul has already filed charges against the Uni
versity with the Equal Opportunity Employment
Commission on the basis of possible "sex and race
discrimination."
And although those charges may get the case
into court, Rebholz said he hopes that an attorney

will be able to go beyond those particular concerns
and force the University to release the letters from
reviewing referees on which the Religious Studies
Department based its initial icfusal.
Rebholz said he questioned fhe -v -v- ■>>
of the referees chosen to evaftiafe Paul's work.
"There is a question of the department's good faith
in accepting these people and whether or not the
department was in some subtle way discriminating
against Diana," he said.
According to Paul, the Religious Studies De
partment inaccurately defined her field of research
as "Chinese thought and religion" when conduct
ing its nationwide search for evaluators. "My real
field is Chinese Buddhism," she said.
Rebhoi/ and Paul said they are de
manding access to the referees' letters
"so we II know who were chosen as
outside referees and whether they
were appropriate." Rebholz said.
According to Paul, two other pro
fessors were given their letters while
she was denied access to hers.

However. English Prof. Albert Gelpi.
who was appointed by Hastorf to
review the ease, attributes this not to
unfairness but rather to clarification ot
University procedures by Hastorf.
The provost s;iid that "people
should know what's written about
them without knowing who wrote it
. . . and what we did for Prof. Paul was
to have the chairman of the depart
ment (religious studies) do a summary
and I had Prof. (Herant)

katehadourian. who has not been di
rectlv involved in the case, go over all
of the confidential material ... I also
happen to believe that fairness
dictates that people know content but
not exact words."
Paul's citing of "possible race and
sex discrimination" as the basis of le
gal action is supported by Rebholz.
who said that Paul was denied "the
special care called for by the faculty
affirmative action report."
