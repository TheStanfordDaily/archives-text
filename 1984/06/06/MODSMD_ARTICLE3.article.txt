## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
Senior staff writer
Provost Albert Hastorf tn«s rejected the tenure
appeal of Religious Studies Pro'. Pan.', j
I'aol said yesterday she will now take her appeal o
• lie tira' stage of the University's process, an advi
sory board to University President Donald Ken
nedy.
"As soon as I get the document written i: will go
to the advisory board," she said.
And if that appeal is also denied, "My lawyer
and I will be consulting and filing charges (against
the University) in court by July 1," she said.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, who is serving as
Paul's grievance counselor, said, "The advisory
board to the president is the final step . For all
practical purposes they make the decision. On

these academic matters Kennedy always follows
their advice."
But Rebholz remains hopeful about Paul's
ci mevs. They have ihe power to leview and
change the decision of all the previous levels in the
grievance process, and I hope they will," he said.
But if they do not. Rebholz supports Paul's deci
sion to take the case to court."I think the case has
merit and that previous decisions have left some
questions unanswered ... 1 think the case is so
good it has to go to court,"he said.
Paul has already filed charges against the Uni
versity with the Equal Opportunity Employment
Commission on the basis of possible "sex and race
discrimination."
And although those charges may get the case
into court, Rebholz said he hopes that an attorney

will be able to go beyond those particular concerns
and force the University to release the letters from
reviewing referees on which the Religious Studies
Department based its initial icfusal.
Rebholz said he questioned fhe -v -v- ■>>
of the referees chosen to evaftiafe Paul's work.
"There is a question of the department's good faith
in accepting these people and whether or not the
department was in some subtle way discriminating
against Diana," he said.
According to Paul, the Religious Studies De
partment inaccurately defined her field of research
as "Chinese thought and religion" when conduct
ing its nationwide search for evaluators. "My real
field is Chinese Buddhism," she said.
