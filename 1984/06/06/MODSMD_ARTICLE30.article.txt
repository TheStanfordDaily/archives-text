# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

University recognizes slugs
An underground campus charity organiza
tion has finally come to light, and according
to The Daily Princetonian, has been leaving
a trail of good will behind it.
The 10 members of the SLUGS — Several
Lonely Ugly Guys — began getting together
to play poker and turned gambling into a
fund-raiser. Doug Stuart, president of the
society, said, "The group just grew and it was
a good way to have a good time, so we've
kept it up."
At each game, some of the poker kitty is
set aside and deposited into the SLUG fund.
One SLUG said, "At first we were going to
spend the money on ourselves at the end of
the year, but then we came up with the idea
of giving it to charity. We had a big debate
over it, but altruism won out."
The group will probably support a foreign
child through the SLUG F-'und. Employees
of the savings and loan where the SLUG
Fund is kept actually sent the SLUGs a letter

advising them to support the child rather
than a group trip to the Bahamas.
Recently, the SLUGs celebrated a mile
stone in their brief history. The group has
been given official recognition as a student
organization by the office of the dean of stu
dent affairs.
In their charter, the group couldn't men
tion the word "poker," so tltey used some
other roundabout terms. Most of the SLUGs
do downplay the role of gambling in the or

ganization. "The poker part of it is all act
ing," Stuart admitted. " We're just a group of
guys who you expect to be sitting around
playing cards and smoking cigars. In fact, we
really don't even know how to play."
Most of the SLUGs claim that the organi
zation has given them support and sustained
friendships throughout the year.
"We were all good friends, but we dis
covered this year that we weren't in any or
ganizations together. We were afraid we'd
never see each other if we didn't make the
effort," said one SLUG.
"A negative part of senior year is that you
can become separated from people. Our
group has cut across clubs and other separa
tions and has really kept us together," noted
another member of the group.
SL.UG archivist Phil Stern added "1 men
tioned the group in the acknowledgements
of my thesis. They've been a great support."
Campaigning for credit
Northwestern Prof. William Crotty
decided in the early 1970s that students
should have a chance to be active in political
campaigns without risking their status as
full-time students. He created a course en
titled Political Campaigning C7O, which 13
students are taking this quarter.
Requirements for the course include
working on a campaign for 10-12 hours per
week, reading five campaign textbooks and
completing four quizzes and one term paper.
Crotty said he wanted to present the feel of a
campaign in an academic context.
Junior Bill Thomas told The Daily
Northwestern, "It's definitely a time
consuming class. But once the class time is
over, you can really get into the campaign."
Thomas works 12 hours per week for Rep.
Paul Simon's senate campaign. His main
task has been to research the last three elec
tions of Simon's opponent, Sen. Charles
Percy. "Electoral targeting tells planners
what counties -will be close based on past
results," Thomas said. "It gives them ideas
of where Democrats usually win and where

it will be close."
Senior Marsha Brown wasn't excited
about any of the candidates, so she decided
to work for a political movement. She works
for a local branch of the political action com
mittee National Freeze Voters. The biggest
part of her job is getting people to think
about the nuclear disarmament issue, either
through phone calls or going door-to-door.
Although Brown said she thinks that most
people want something to be done, many are
wary about the list of current proposals.
"There are people who slam the door in
your face, or don't recognize that you're
trying to do something worthwhile," she
said. But from the class she has learned how
to deal with that type of reaction.

"One of the main things you find out in
politics is that you can't convert people,"
Brown said. "If they are really against it,
there is no way you can change their minds."
Elements of style
Though members of other English depart
ments in the California State University
(CSU) system generally express satisfaction
with the status of their composition classes,
controversy has raged in the San Jose State
English Department over the teaching of
freshman composition.
Writing requirements at SJSU are actually
stricter than at the other four colleges sur
veyed. While San Jose State requires two
semesters of freshman composition'for gen
eral education, other schools require only
one.
The CSU system has no uniform stand
ards, although an English placement test re
quirement for incoming freshmen was

adopted systemwide about 10 years ago.
Robert Bess. C'SU assistant vice-chancellor
of academic affairs, told The Spartan Daily
that success rates on the placement test indi
cate students are not well-prepared for col
lege composition courses when they enroll in
college.
SJSU English Prof. Dennis Chaldecott
contended earlier this semester that students
were not ready to be taught freshman com
position because they lack the knowledge
necessary to write on university-level sub
jects. He also said the quality of students is
declining.
"Every year, fewer and fewer students
want to work," Chaldecott said.
John Galm, chairman of the SJSU English
Department, disagreed with him.
"The students over the past few years are
coming in less well-prepared," he said, "but
I'm impressed that students who come into
college now are really very serious about
their education. They're hard-working."
Bess agreed that there had been a period
of laxness, and until very recently, there had
been a fairly casual approach to teaching
composition.
Members of English departments at other
universities also commented on the recent
improvement.
"We're just now coming out from under
the laxness in the "605," the Spartan Daily
quoted Charles May, composition coordina
tor at C'SU Long Beach.
Bess said the quality of high school educa
tion is also a significant factor in the readi
ness of students for college composition
courses. The CSU system has recently
revised admission requirements. The new
requirements, which will be in effect for
freshmen entering this fall, include four
years of college preparatory English.
A fatal decision
A former University of South Carolina
teacher who was denied tenure shot and
killed himself after taking a student hostage,
according to The Daily Pennsylvanian.
Philip /eltner, a former assistant philoso
phy professor, shot himself in the head in the
office of the university's president, where he
had barricaded himself after seizing a stu
dent who was later released, said a
spokesperson for the State Law Enforce
ment Division.
/.eltner was found at about 5:30 p.m. by a
SWAT team that apparently picked the lock
of the door to university president James
Holderman's office in the administration
building.
"He apparently shot himself with one of
the two handguns he had." said the
spokesperson.
/.eltner arrived at the university in 1973
and was named the school's Teacher of the
Year in 1978, but was later denied tenure.
He had filed a lawsuit against the university.
He entered the president's office shortly
after 1 p.m., demanding to see Holderman.
When told that Holderman wasn't there,
/eltner took a student hostage. Security
officials evacuated and sealed off the build
ing about 1:30 p.m.

/eltner talked by telephone with Holder
man, agents of the State Law Enforcement
Division and a television personality, hut
hung up and was dead within half an hour.
The student, who was released unharmed
at about 3:50 p.m.. told authorities /eltner
was armed with two revolvers and claimed to
have explosives.

A professor blurts out to one of his female
graduate students: "You know I want to
sleep with you. You know I can do a lot for
you; 1 have a great deal of influence. Now of
course I don't want to force you into any
thing, but I'm sure you're going to be sen
sible about this."
Many similar tales of sexual harassment
by college teachers against female students
across the country have been collected in a
new book, "The Lecherous Professor," by
Linda Weiner. vice provost for student af
fairs at the University of Cincinnati, and
Billie Wright Dziech, a literature professor
at the same school.
According to the Indiana Daily Student,
the study, based on 400 anonymous inter
views of students, faculty, alumni and admi
nistrators across the country, may well be
the most chilling indictment of higher educa
tion ever published.
The study states that 20 to 30 percent of
female students can expect to be sexually
harassed by male faculty during their college
years — at a time when parents or the stu
dents are being asked to pay upward of
$10,000 a year for a college education.
The book offers the collective testimony
of female students who say they have been
pawed, gawked at. sexually assaulted, ver
bally abused, threatened with lower grades,
promised higher ones and even had their
future careers ruined by male faculty mem
bers.
Some colleges are beginning to take the
problem more seriously, the authors point
out. Numerous campuses have recently sur
veyed their female students to determine the
extent of the problem.
The most common targets of sexual har
assment. in fact, seem to be loners, minority
women and female students enrolled in
traditionally male fields where they tend to
be viewed with hostility — fields like engi
neering, accounting or architecture, accor
ding to the book.

Campaigning for credit
Northwestern Prof. William Crotty
decided in the early 1970s that students
should have a chance to be active in political
campaigns without risking their status as
full-time students. He created a course en
titled Political Campaigning C7O, which 13
students are taking this quarter.
Requirements for the course include
working on a campaign for 10-12 hours per
week, reading five campaign textbooks and
completing four quizzes and one term paper.
Crotty said he wanted to present the feel of a
campaign in an academic context.
Junior Bill Thomas told The Daily
Northwestern, "It's definitely a time
consuming class. But once the class time is
over, you can really get into the campaign."
Thomas works 12 hours per week for Rep.
Paul Simon's senate campaign. His main
task has been to research the last three elec
tions of Simon's opponent, Sen. Charles
Percy. "Electoral targeting tells planners
what counties -will be close based on past
results," Thomas said. "It gives them ideas
of where Democrats usually win and where

it will be close."
Senior Marsha Brown wasn't excited
about any of the candidates, so she decided
to work for a political movement. She works
for a local branch of the political action com
mittee National Freeze Voters. The biggest
part of her job is getting people to think
about the nuclear disarmament issue, either
through phone calls or going door-to-door.
Although Brown said she thinks that most
people want something to be done, many are
wary about the list of current proposals.
"There are people who slam the door in
your face, or don't recognize that you're
trying to do something worthwhile," she
said. But from the class she has learned how
to deal with that type of reaction.

"One of the main things you find out in
politics is that you can't convert people,"
Brown said. "If they are really against it,
there is no way you can change their minds."
Elements of style
Though members of other English depart
ments in the California State University
(CSU) system generally express satisfaction
with the status of their composition classes,
controversy has raged in the San Jose State
English Department over the teaching of
freshman composition.
Writing requirements at SJSU are actually
stricter than at the other four colleges sur
veyed. While San Jose State requires two
semesters of freshman composition'for gen
eral education, other schools require only
one.
The CSU system has no uniform stand
ards, although an English placement test re
quirement for incoming freshmen was

adopted systemwide about 10 years ago.
Robert Bess. C'SU assistant vice-chancellor
of academic affairs, told The Spartan Daily
that success rates on the placement test indi
cate students are not well-prepared for col
lege composition courses when they enroll in
college.
SJSU English Prof. Dennis Chaldecott
contended earlier this semester that students
were not ready to be taught freshman com
position because they lack the knowledge
necessary to write on university-level sub
jects. He also said the quality of students is
declining.
"Every year, fewer and fewer students
want to work," Chaldecott said.
John Galm, chairman of the SJSU English
Department, disagreed with him.
"The students over the past few years are
coming in less well-prepared," he said, "but
I'm impressed that students who come into
college now are really very serious about
their education. They're hard-working."
Bess agreed that there had been a period
of laxness, and until very recently, there had
been a fairly casual approach to teaching
composition.
Members of English departments at other
universities also commented on the recent
improvement.
"We're just now coming out from under
the laxness in the "605," the Spartan Daily
quoted Charles May, composition coordina
tor at C'SU Long Beach.
Bess said the quality of high school educa
tion is also a significant factor in the readi
ness of students for college composition
courses. The CSU system has recently
revised admission requirements. The new
requirements, which will be in effect for
freshmen entering this fall, include four
years of college preparatory English.
A fatal decision
A former University of South Carolina
teacher who was denied tenure shot and
killed himself after taking a student hostage,
according to The Daily Pennsylvanian.
Philip /eltner, a former assistant philoso
phy professor, shot himself in the head in the
office of the university's president, where he
had barricaded himself after seizing a stu
dent who was later released, said a
spokesperson for the State Law Enforce
ment Division.
/.eltner was found at about 5:30 p.m. by a
SWAT team that apparently picked the lock
of the door to university president James
Holderman's office in the administration
building.
"He apparently shot himself with one of
the two handguns he had." said the
spokesperson.
/.eltner arrived at the university in 1973
and was named the school's Teacher of the
Year in 1978, but was later denied tenure.
He had filed a lawsuit against the university.
He entered the president's office shortly
after 1 p.m., demanding to see Holderman.
When told that Holderman wasn't there,
/eltner took a student hostage. Security
officials evacuated and sealed off the build
ing about 1:30 p.m.

/eltner talked by telephone with Holder
man, agents of the State Law Enforcement
Division and a television personality, hut
hung up and was dead within half an hour.
The student, who was released unharmed
at about 3:50 p.m.. told authorities /eltner
was armed with two revolvers and claimed to
have explosives.

A professor blurts out to one of his female
graduate students: "You know I want to
sleep with you. You know I can do a lot for
you; 1 have a great deal of influence. Now of
course I don't want to force you into any
thing, but I'm sure you're going to be sen
sible about this."
Many similar tales of sexual harassment
by college teachers against female students
across the country have been collected in a
new book, "The Lecherous Professor," by
Linda Weiner. vice provost for student af
fairs at the University of Cincinnati, and
Billie Wright Dziech, a literature professor
at the same school.
According to the Indiana Daily Student,
the study, based on 400 anonymous inter
views of students, faculty, alumni and admi
nistrators across the country, may well be
the most chilling indictment of higher educa
tion ever published.
The study states that 20 to 30 percent of
female students can expect to be sexually
harassed by male faculty during their college
years — at a time when parents or the stu
dents are being asked to pay upward of
$10,000 a year for a college education.
The book offers the collective testimony
of female students who say they have been
pawed, gawked at. sexually assaulted, ver
bally abused, threatened with lower grades,
promised higher ones and even had their
future careers ruined by male faculty mem
bers.
Some colleges are beginning to take the
problem more seriously, the authors point
out. Numerous campuses have recently sur
veyed their female students to determine the
extent of the problem.
The most common targets of sexual har
assment. in fact, seem to be loners, minority
women and female students enrolled in
traditionally male fields where they tend to
be viewed with hostility — fields like engi
neering, accounting or architecture, accor
ding to the book.




Grading on a curve
University recognizes slugs
An underground campus charity organiza
tion has finally come to light, and according
to The Daily Princetonian, has been leaving
a trail of good will behind it.
The 10 members of the SLUGS — Several
Lonely Ugly Guys — began getting together
to play poker and turned gambling into a
fund-raiser. Doug Stuart, president of the
society, said, "The group just grew and it was
a good way to have a good time, so we've
kept it up."
At each game, some of the poker kitty is
set aside and deposited into the SLUG fund.
One SLUG said, "At first we were going to
spend the money on ourselves at the end of
the year, but then we came up with the idea
of giving it to charity. We had a big debate
over it, but altruism won out."
The group will probably support a foreign
child through the SLUG F-'und. Employees
of the savings and loan where the SLUG
Fund is kept actually sent the SLUGs a letter

advising them to support the child rather
than a group trip to the Bahamas.
Recently, the SLUGs celebrated a mile
stone in their brief history. The group has
been given official recognition as a student
organization by the office of the dean of stu
dent affairs.
In their charter, the group couldn't men
tion the word "poker," so tltey used some
other roundabout terms. Most of the SLUGs
do downplay the role of gambling in the or

ganization. "The poker part of it is all act
ing," Stuart admitted. " We're just a group of
guys who you expect to be sitting around
playing cards and smoking cigars. In fact, we
really don't even know how to play."
Most of the SLUGs claim that the organi
zation has given them support and sustained
friendships throughout the year.
"We were all good friends, but we dis
covered this year that we weren't in any or
ganizations together. We were afraid we'd
never see each other if we didn't make the
effort," said one SLUG.
"A negative part of senior year is that you
can become separated from people. Our
group has cut across clubs and other separa
tions and has really kept us together," noted
another member of the group.
SL.UG archivist Phil Stern added "1 men

ments in the California State University
(CSU) system generally express satisfaction
with the status of their composition classes,
controversy has raged in the San Jose State
English Department over the teaching of
freshman composition.
Writing requirements at SJSU are actually
stricter than at the other four colleges sur
veyed. While San Jose State requires two
semesters of freshman composition'for gen
eral education, other schools require only
one.
The CSU system has no uniform stand
ards, although an English placement test re
quirement for incoming freshmen was

adopted systemwide about 10 years ago.
Robert Bess. C'SU assistant vice-chancellor
of academic affairs, told The Spartan Daily
that success rates on the placement test indi
cate students are not well-prepared for col
lege composition courses when they enroll in
college.
SJSU English Prof. Dennis Chaldecott
contended earlier this semester that students
were not ready to be taught freshman com
position because they lack the knowledge
necessary to write on university-level sub
jects. He also said the quality of students is
declining.
"Every year, fewer and fewer students
want to work," Chaldecott said.
John Galm, chairman of the SJSU English
Department, disagreed with him.
"The students over the past few years are
coming in less well-prepared," he said, "but
I'm impressed that students who come into
college now are really very serious about
their education. They're hard-working."
Bess agreed that there had been a period
of laxness, and until very recently, there had
been a fairly casual approach to teaching
composition.
Members of English departments at other
universities also commented on the recent
improvement.
"We're just now coming out from under
the laxness in the "605," the Spartan Daily
quoted Charles May, composition coordina
tor at C'SU Long Beach.
Bess said the quality of high school educa
tion is also a significant factor in the readi
ness of students for college composition
courses. The CSU system has recently
revised admission requirements. The new
requirements, which will be in effect for
freshmen entering this fall, include four
years of college preparatory English.
A fatal decision
A former University of South Carolina
teacher who was denied tenure shot and
killed himself after taking a student hostage,
according to The Daily Pennsylvanian.
Philip /eltner, a former assistant philoso
phy professor, shot himself in the head in the
office of the university's president, where he
had barricaded himself after seizing a stu
dent who was later released, said a
spokesperson for the State Law Enforce
ment Division.
/.eltner was found at about 5:30 p.m. by a
SWAT team that apparently picked the lock
of the door to university president James
Holderman's office in the administration
building.
"He apparently shot himself with one of
the two handguns he had." said the
spokesperson.
/.eltner arrived at the university in 1973
and was named the school's Teacher of the
Year in 1978, but was later denied tenure.
He had filed a lawsuit against the university.
He entered the president's office shortly
after 1 p.m., demanding to see Holderman.
When told that Holderman wasn't there,
/eltner took a student hostage. Security
officials evacuated and sealed off the build
ing about 1:30 p.m.

/eltner talked by telephone with Holder
man, agents of the State Law Enforcement
Division and a television personality, hut
hung up and was dead within half an hour.
The student, who was released unharmed
at about 3:50 p.m.. told authorities /eltner
was armed with two revolvers and claimed to
have explosives.

A professor blurts out to one of his female
graduate students: "You know I want to
sleep with you. You know I can do a lot for
you; 1 have a great deal of influence. Now of
course I don't want to force you into any
thing, but I'm sure you're going to be sen
sible about this."
Many similar tales of sexual harassment
by college teachers against female students
across the country have been collected in a
new book, "The Lecherous Professor," by
Linda Weiner. vice provost for student af
fairs at the University of Cincinnati, and
Billie Wright Dziech, a literature professor
at the same school.
According to the Indiana Daily Student,
the study, based on 400 anonymous inter
views of students, faculty, alumni and admi
nistrators across the country, may well be
the most chilling indictment of higher educa
tion ever published.
The study states that 20 to 30 percent of
female students can expect to be sexually
harassed by male faculty during their college
years — at a time when parents or the stu
dents are being asked to pay upward of
$10,000 a year for a college education.
The book offers the collective testimony
of female students who say they have been
pawed, gawked at. sexually assaulted, ver
bally abused, threatened with lower grades,
promised higher ones and even had their
future careers ruined by male faculty mem
bers.
Some colleges are beginning to take the
problem more seriously, the authors point
out. Numerous campuses have recently sur
veyed their female students to determine the
extent of the problem.
The most common targets of sexual har
assment. in fact, seem to be loners, minority
women and female students enrolled in
traditionally male fields where they tend to
be viewed with hostility — fields like engi
neering, accounting or architecture, accor
ding to the book.
