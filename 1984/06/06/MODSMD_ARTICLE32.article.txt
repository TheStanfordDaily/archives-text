# Mondale wins in New Jersey
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Former Vice President Walter
Mondale claimed "overwhelming"
victories yesterday in New Jersey
and West Virginia and pronounced
himself the winner in his Demo
cratic presidential marathon with
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart. Hart
countered with wins in South
Dakota and New Mexico, with Cal
ifornia rated close in a five-state
primary finale.
Hart said "of course" he would
stay in the race.
But the small state victories were
far less than the twin victories he
hoped for in New Jersey and Cali
fornia to give momentum and
credibility to his cause.
Mondale said late yesterday that
he thought the race was finally
over, the persistent Hart finally
vanquished.

"Marathons are long and hard,
hut every one of them has a finish
line and a winner. Well this is it and
here I am," Mondale told sup
porters in St. Paul. Minn. "We
have carried New Jersey and West
Virginia overwhelmingly."
In all. 486 convention delegates
were at stake on the final day of a
long primary season that began in a
New Hampshire snowstorm. Even
before the polls closed, Mondale
picked up a dozen additional
delegates from among previously
uncommitted in other states.
That put him about 220 short of
the 1967 delegates he needs to
claim a majority for nomination
and meant he needed to win 45
percent of yesterday's total to
reach his goal.
With 58 percent of the precincts
counted in New Jersey, Mondale

had 46 percent of the vote, to 3 I
percent for Hart and 21 percent for
Jackson.
In West Virginia, with 17 per
cent of the precincts counted,
Mondale had 53 percent of the
vote to 37 percent for Hart and 7
percent for Jackson. Laßouche had
2 percent.
In South Dakota, 77 percent of
the precincts gave Hart 50 percent
of the vote to 40 percent for
Mondale and 5 percent for Jack
son. 3 percent for Laßouche and 2
pe rce nt u ncom m i tted.
In New Mexico, with 57 percent
of the vote counted. Hart with 47
percent. Mondale with 35 percent
and Jackson 12 percent. One per
cent was uncommitted, three per
cent voted for dropout George
McGovern and two percent for
Laßouche.
