# Provost Hastorf leaves post to travel
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Provost Albert Hastorf, who an
nounced his decision to resign in
September, will give up his office in
late August to his successor. Eco
nomics Prof. James Rosse. But
Hastorf, who has repeatedly stated
that he "isn't going anywhere, after
all," said yesterday he feels the
transition will be smooth, unevent
ful and will perhaps go unnoticed
by the majority of Stanford stu
dents.
"The provost is, after all, a
shadowy figure in the life of most
undergraduates," he said.
After he leaves office, Hastorf
will go on sabbatical for a year,
though he planned at the time of
his resignation to begin teaching in
the fall. He said he plans to spend
part of the time doing work at
Stanford in his field, social psychol
ogy, and some time traveling
abroad.
"I'll be going to Europe, Asia
and Israel, delivering an occasional
lecture," he said. "But 1 won't be
gone the entire year — I find that I
don't really get much work done in
a foreign land, so I'll have to spend
part of my time here."
The traveling will provide Has
torf with a "change of scene," he
said, explaining that he rarely had
the opportunity to travel during his
term as provost. He plans to
resume his teaching duties in the
fall of 1985.
Rosse, Hastorfs successor, has
been a member of the faculty for
almost 20 years and most recently

headed the Center ror Economic
Policy Research. Hastorf said
Rosse is a "consummately able ad
ministrator," and perhaps better
suited than he to administrative
duties.
"He's more adept than I at mar
shalling people's energies," he ex
plained, "and he may be able to
make the job look easier than it
really is. I was more like an
amateur in a rodeo — they make

everything they do look really diffi
cult, and so did I."
Hastorf said the problems faced
by Rosse during his time in office
would be virtually the same as
those he faced during his own term.
"Basically, we have needs beyond
our income," he said. "But this is a
problem we've been facing lor the
last few years — and studies have
shown that it's a problem that's not
going to magically go away."

Hastorf said the worst crises that
Rosse could face would be "any se
vere funding crisis, any severe at
tack on academic freedom — basi
cally, any external attack on the
tremendous emphasis we make on
quality here."
Looking back on his own term as
provost, Hastorf told The Daily in
fall that the "reorganization of un
dergraduate education" and the
revamping of the Western Culture
program were the highlights of his
term.
This past year, he said, was
largely devoted to working out next
year's budget, but high points in
cluded the Faculty Senate's thor
ough discussion about the Overseas
Studies program and the decision
of Mark Mancall to remain as
director of the program for an ad
ditional year.
A book Hastorf co-wrote with
six others was published in Janu
ary. Titled "Social Stigma," the
book is a collection of essays on
"the social psychology of relation
ships in which one or more of the
individuals is 'marked' physically,
socially or psychologically.
"For instance, if you meet a per
son on a train and they tell you
they've just gotten out of jail —
how do you interact?"
Although he seems satisfied with
his term as provost, Hastorf said,
"There are lots of things still to be
done. The new provost will not be
bored." Reflecting on his long
awaited return to teaching and so
cial psychology research, he added,
"Nor will I."
