# Donald Kennedy
## Looking back after a generation of students 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Almost four years have passed since Donald
Kennedy, the biology professor who had left
Stanford to head the Food and Drug Adminis
tration and returned to become the University's
provost, was elected to succeed Richard Lyman
as president. That is not a long time as university
presidencies go — .Stan ford, nearly 100 years old,

inaugural address, delivered to more than than
6000 attending gala festivities replete with
trumpet fanfares and heraldic shields in Frost
Amphitheater. The "earthy Western prag
matism" that had "animated the founding years

of the University" left Stanford with a heritage
of utilitarianism, Kennedy said, making for a
tendency to emphasize the practical over the
purely intellectual, and thus the sciences over
the humanities — where no department had
ever been ranked among the top three nation
ally. The "straightforward and welcome chal
lenge" of resolving that disparity would be one
of the two most important goals of his
presidency, Kennedy said. Me went on to an
