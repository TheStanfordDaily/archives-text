# Donald Kennedy
## Looking back after a generation of students 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Almost four years have passed since Donald
Kennedy, the biology professor who had left
Stanford to head the Food and Drug Adminis
tration and returned to become the University's
provost, was elected to succeed Richard Lyman
as president. That is not a long time as university
presidencies go — .Stan ford, nearly 100 years old,
lias had just eight presidents - but for students,
whose time here is Jar shorter, it is a generation:
All but the most enduring of students have
known no president other than Kennedy.

Few were surprised on that June afternoon in
IVSO when members of the Board of Trustees
emerged from a private meeting to announce
that Donald Kennedy would assume the
presidency effective Aug. I. As is customary, a
nationwide search had been conducted after
Richard Lyman, who had headed the Univer
sity for 10 years, announced his intention to
resign, but all along Kennedy, then 4N. had
been thought to be the most likely successor.
Witty, personable, articulate and thoughtful, he

had collected impressive academic and scien
tific credentials, proven both popular and able
as teacher and administrator and had demon
strated. moreover, a profound interest and con
cern for the humanities.
That concern, emphasized and re
emphasi/ed almost from the moment of his
election, was articulated in Kennedy's October
inaugural address, delivered to more than than
6000 attending gala festivities replete with
trumpet fanfares and heraldic shields in Frost
Amphitheater. The "earthy Western prag
matism" that had "animated the founding years

of the University" left Stanford with a heritage
of utilitarianism, Kennedy said, making for a
tendency to emphasize the practical over the
purely intellectual, and thus the sciences over
the humanities — where no department had
ever been ranked among the top three nation
ally. The "straightforward and welcome chal
lenge" of resolving that disparity would be one
of the two most important goals of his
presidency, Kennedy said. Me went on to an
nounce that a $1.25 million Mellon Foundation

tial address.
grant would he used to help open appointments in
the humanities and that renowned literary eritie
lan Watt, a professor of English, would serve as
the first direetor of a new I humanities Center.
The Kennedy years have seen sharp growth in
the number of faculty in the humanities — indeed,
that is where nearly every new position has been
created — and the Humanities Center, which now
occupies its own buildings, is beginning to attract
noted scholars from both inside and outside the
University.
In emphasizing the humanities, however. Ken
nedy has been bucking a trend: though enrollment
in humanities courses is about the same as it was
five years ago. the percentage of students majoring
in the humanities has dropped sharply to an all
time low of 15 percent. Kennedy has argued that it
is exceedingly difficult, in allocating resources, to
keep pace with shifting student interest, and that
the changes tend to he short-lived.
Improving the student-teacher relationship was.
Kennedy said in his inaugural address, a second
major goal. Frequent casualties of the turmoil of
the '60s and '70s were, he said, faculty participa
tion in residential education, in advising and in
more casual voluntary relationships with students.
"The challenge before us amounts to nothing less
than the reformation of undergraduate education
at Stanford; yet I do not see how we can make
much serious progress with it until we can
evaporate the aftermath of mistrust that has hung
over us for so long," he said.
Under his leadership, administrative oversight
of undergraduate education has been overhauled,
with Herant Katchadourian assuming the new role ol
vice provost for undergraduate education. Katcha
dourian works with an Undergraduate Cabinet to keep
abreast of undergraduate interests and concerns
through an expanded annual Senior Survey, a cur
riculum survey and other studies. Even greater ef
forts have been made toward engaging faculty in
"life off the Quad" through expanded programs in
residential education and advising — efforts con
sidered by many as models in providing a broad
based college education hut criticized by others
who worry that University officials are acting more
like parents than mentors.
It is the job of a university president, of course,
not just to advocate change but also to strive tor
institutional growth — growth that can be mea
sured, as Kennedy put it early in his tenure, "by
how attractive Stanford is to students, how peers ot
the faculty regard them and (by) the health and
spirit of the institution." Some 15,600 students ap
plied to enter Stanford for the fall of 19K4 — up
from 12,731 four years ago — and 61 percent ot
those accepted will enroll — a "yield' second only
to Harvard's.
Most of those accepted by both institutions go to
Harvard, but Stanford has succeeded in recent
years in getting a larger share ot these students,
partly through more aggressive recruiting and
partly because the University's academic reputa
tion has grown dramatically in recent years. Over
all enrollment, particularly among graduate stu

dents. is at an all-time high.
More and more often. Stanford is being named
in professional and journalistic polls as the best or
one of the best institutions in the nation, and many
of its departments, particularly in engineering and
the sciences, rank among the country s best. I uiul
raising has increased as well; the I niversity s take
this year was about $40 million, far behind Har
vard's S—s() million, but still the second-best in the
nation. Tuition has increased sharply. Irom
in 19K0-NI to $9705 in 19N4-N5. but no more so
than at comparable institutions, and Stanford lias
managed to retain its policy ol aid-blind admis-

sions m years when other
universities have aban
doned theirs.
If its visitors are any
measure, Stantord s
reputation has been ascen
dant internationally as well,
for the University has
become a must stopping
point for dignitaries \ isiting
Silicon Valley and the rest
of the West Coast. In
March of 1953. Kennedy
played host to Queen
Elizabeth II of England and
her husband Prince Philip,
hosting a luncheon at his
home for the royal couple,
faculty and students.
Kennedy welcomed a
flurry of visitors to campus
this spring, including King
Carl XVI Gust at ol
Sweden, who met with
Stanford's 10 Nobel
laureates; Rudolt
Kirschlaeger. president of
Austria; and Francois Mit
terrand, president of
France, who was briefed at
the Center for Integrated

Systems by Silicon Valley scientists and
entrepeneurs.
"I want to be a cultivator of enthusiasm and a
good agent of consensus," Kennedy told Hie Daily
shortly after becoming president, and lie lias cer
tainly been the former. Because of his ability to sell
potential contributors on Stanford ~-n an ability lie
makes use of nearly every dav in speaking lo

alumni or meeting in his oltice or ov ,r lunch with
friends ol the University — he is m jme part re
sponsible for the growth in fund i ; , mig. He has
seemed to instill enthusiasm aniony indents, too,
particularly in encouraging them to t < usider public
service and to major in disciplines i| [it impassion
them, not those which seem niosi p ri meal.
Whether Kennedy is described ts of con
sensus in autocrat depends on the p ct ~n doing the
describing. Certainly, as one who set nut from the
first to be an active presidential leai| t "a presi
dent must do much more than main sin structure
and conserve momentum, he s;n<| ltl |~s inaugural
address —- he has sought to have n | );| K | m the for
mulation ot the consensus. But on m ( s | controver
sial issues which have arisen dunnj>|i ; administra
tion. Kennedy has has acted coni tiusly, often
reserving judgment — at least pnH icK — unt 'l
others have considered the issue an( issued a re
commendation.
Some ol the most loudly debate cases have
never reached him — the denial ol >nure to As
soc. History Prol. Estelle Frecdnian, for example,
which was overturned by Pro\ost ,\ hert Hastorf
while on others, such as th c of
graduate student Stephen Moshu or behavior
while conducting research in C hin;i e has simply
accepted the recommendations ui hose subor-

dinate to him.
The controversy over the Kulald Reagan
presidential library complex, the longest lasting
and most heated ol his administration, provides
the best example ot Kennedy seanjhing for and
then articulating a consensus. Not nihil a commit
tee headed by Economics Prol J,mies Rosso ex
pressed support tor a Reagan Vi\h;u\, reservations

about but reluctant acquiescence to a presidential
museum and opposition to a Hoover Institution
run policy center, and not until the Faculty Senate
unanimously voted support of those positions, did
Kennedy speak out on the issue, and then his posi
tion echoed theirs.
Still there were critics — on one side, those un
swayingly opposed to the notion of a Reagan li
brary at Stanford; on the other, those within the
University and the press who supported the idea of
a policy center run by Hoover — but they were
small in number and absent altogether on the
Board of Trustees. Kennedy's role in acting as a
forceful agent of that con-

sensus, many observers
believe, was the most im
portant factor in persuad
ing the White House that
Stanford would rather lose
the library complex altogeth
er than accept a Hoover
run center, and thus in
bringing about the resolu
tion of the dispute, which
will bring a presidential li
brary and museum to Stan
ford without a policy cen
ter.
Charges that Kennedy is
acting autocratically have
been heard more and more
often recently, however,
mostly because of the
dispute over recognition of
United Stanford Workers
Local 6KO as the bargaining
unit for the University's
service employees. An
tagonism between Kennedy
and the union had been ap
parent since the strike in
the fall of 1982, but the
University and the union
held to an uneasy truce un-

til this spring, when the service employees chose
Local 6SO to represent them.
Almost immediately the University charged that
the election had been conducted improperly and
that 6SO thus could not represent the employees,
and then stopped colleeting dues tor the union.
That provoked accusations that Kennedy and staff

counsel Priscilla Wheeler, the two most directly in
volved in the dispute, were acting as dictators and
trying to break the union. The wrangling between
union and University has now gone to the National
Labor Relations Board, which upheld the union's
position, and threatens to go to the courts. Ken
nedy has made this issue a personal one, and for
that reason criticism of the University position,
which has come from faculty, the ASSU Senate
and presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, will
likely continue to be criticism of him.
The conflict with the union is but one of the
many challenges that face Kennedy and the Uni
versity in the coming years. Another is the rela
tionship between the University and the Hoover
Institution — and especially between Kennedy and
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell — which is
still uneasy. The now-simmering controversy is
likely to boil over again when the Board of Trus
tees committee currently looking into the issue
makes a recommendation some time this summer
or next fall.
The role of fraternities on campus will continue
as well to be hotly contested, with influential and
generous alumni sure to object to a task force re
commendation that subjective selection be
abolished in the University housing system. Fac
ulty recruiting will continue to be a high priority,
one made more difficult by the scarcity of affor
dable housing in the Stanford area, a problem
compounded by the current impasse over the Stan
ford West housing project.
Beginning this fall new administrators will oc
cupy the three offices most directly concerned with
undergraduate education — provost, vice-provost
for undergraduate studies and director of admis
sions — presenting a potential for confusion that
will need to be overcome.
A further challenge will come in fund raising:
the goal for a four-year centennial campaign
tentatively scheduled to begin in 1957 is sure to be
ambitious and reportedly may be as high as $1 bil
lion.
How long Kennedy will continue as president is,
of course, still not known, though Kennedy has
done nothing to suggest he will leave office
anytime in the near future. He has indicated that
he would not accept a cabinet position in the next
presidential administration if one were to be of
fered to him, but popular suspicion — encouraged
by his leadership in national efforts to improve
university/government and university/business re
lations — holds that his aspirations are political,
and that he will someday seek a U.S. Senate seat.
In an interview earlier this year, he said he in
tended to take stock of his performance after next
June, believing five years to be an ideal time to
reflect on what he had accomplished and what he
had yet to do. For now, he continues at the frenetic
pace — up at six, a run to the Dish, to work early
and home late, periodic evenings out on business
— that he has kept most days for the four years he
has served as president of Stanford University.

Kennedy's family has been an
integral part of the larger Stan
ford family during the last four
years. Kennedy and his wife
Jeanne, the director of commu
nity relations at Stanford Uni
versity Hospital, (above) cele
brated their 30th wedding an
niversary at Senior Class Day
last June. Julia, one of Ken
nedy's two daughters, sttM>d in
for her mother to serve as the
president's escort (left) at the
Cardinal Club auction in Los
Angeles in November. Kennedy
gave his father William a tour of
the campus during the elder
Kennedy's recent 10-day stay
here.






As Stanford's official host and goodwill ambassador, Kennedy has met with dignitaries both on and
off campus. England's Queen Elizabeth II (above) lunched with students and faculty at Kennedy's
campus home last March. Kennedy later shared the stage with Secretary of State George Shult/.
(left) at last year's Commencement. On a lobbying trip to Washington I).C. in 1982, Kennedy met
with Missouri Sen. Tom Eagleton to discuss indirect cost recovery for University research. Former
President Jimmy Carter visited campus this summer (below left) to meet with high-technology
experts and Kerinedv, Carter's Food and Drug Administration chief. This soring, French President
Francois Mitterrand dropped in by helicopter to inspect Stanford's Center for Integrated Systems.










One of Kennedy's most visible roles has been as mediator between battling elements of the
Stanford community. Whether listening to his colleagues argue over a controversial report on
theme houses (above), or explaining his own position on Hoover Institution and Reagan Library
issues to the displeasure of Hoover critic Prot. Ronald Rebholz (below), Kennedy has remained a
central figure in the Faculty Senate. Outside the Faculty Senate, Kennedy eventually answers to
the Board of Trustees, lead bv Board President William Kimball (bottom).



Kennedy has taken the idea of the
student-athlete to the logical extreme,
becoming a president-athlete himself.
An avid runner now famous for his
early-morning jogs to The Dish, Ken
nedy warmed up for the 1982
Maderathon with Cardinal safety
Vaughn Williams before hitting the
trail (lower left and far left). At the
end of the Cardinal's dismal 1983
football season, Kennedy tried to raise
morale with quarterback Steve Cot
trell (below) as he rolled into the Big
Game. In happier times, Kennedy
congratulated former Head Coach
Paul VViggin after the Cardinal upset
Washington in 1982.
