This year marks the 21st ver
sion of the Modern Olympics.
Unfortunately, the summer of
1984 may be better remembered
as the second version of the
"Half Games."
For the second straight
Games, a major boycott will
prevent nearly half of the
world's greatest athletes from
competing in Los Angeles. What
was once the greatest meeting of
athletes from around the world
has been reduced to a tool of
political reciprocity.
For Stanford athletes, coaches
and even local fans, this dim
forecast for the summer is
received with mixed reviews.
This year's U.S. Olympic team

will be filled with many of the
names listed above.
In swimming, Pablo Morales,
Jeff Kostoff, Dave Bottom, John
Moffet and Marybeth Linzmeier
are nearly sure bets to make the
team. Distance runner PattiSue
Plumer is another with great
promise, along with discus
thrower and shot putter Carol
Cady.
But without the fierce compe
tition of the Eastern-bloc
countries (especially the Soviet
Union and East Germany), many
of these athletes may feel
slighted or lackluster about the
Games.
These Games would have also
been a chance for improvement
by example for the United
States. As Stanford Men's Swim-

ming Coach (and possible Olym
pic Coach) Skip Kenney ex
plained, "(The East German) wo
men would have kicked our tails
and spurred us on toward im
provement."
But fellow Stanford and Olym
pic Coach George Haines
disagreed, "They're not going to
put an asterisk by these
medals." Linzmeier pointed out
simply, "It's hard enough to
make the U.S. team without
having to worry about who is or
isn't going to be there."
That incentive may be enough
for Linzmeier to get through the
Olympic Trials later this month
and on to the team. But
Linzmeier, who was a member
of the 1980 Olympic Team, may
let down just a bit when she

jumps into the water and
realizes that the top two women
in her event are at home.
In any case, Stanford athletics
will be well represented at the
Games both physically and
structurally.
Olympic fans in the Stanford
area will be treated to some of
the world's finest soccer still.
The Olympic flag will be raised
over Stanford Stadium for some
preliminary matches. Stanford
was chosen along with Harvard,
the Naval Academy and Los An
geles as the sites for games.
Other Stanford coaches at the
Olympics will include Brooks
Johnson, who will coach the wo
men's track team, and Buzz
Hurst, who will direct the Olym-

pic fencing tournament. Trainer
Stan Scott will take up the same
capacity in Los Angeles and Ken
ney may join them if Stanford
qualifies the most collegiate
swimmers for the U.S. team.
Freshman Derrick Rostagno
already qualified for the tennis
team by reaching the finals of
the trials in New York. Tennis is
only an exhibition sport this
year, as is baseball, where three
Stanford players will compete
for spots. Players in exhibition
sports are restricted by age.
Internationally, Stanford may
also be represented on the
Canadian, British and Israeli
teams as well by Mark Olson,
Shaun Pickering and Nanci
Goldsmith respectively.
