# Second place just isn't a consideration to Moffet
## 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
"I'm not swimming for
second place," says Stanford
sophomore John Moffet.
Moffet, a Cardinal swimmer
who holds Stanford records in
the 100- and 200-yard
hreaststroke and shares the
400 medley relay mark, is
aiming for a berth on the 1 9N4
Olympic team. He will swim in
the Olympic Trials at the end of
the month in hopes of becoming
a two-time Olympian.
Moffet was 16 when he
qualified for the 1980 Olympic
team as the youngest male
member of the U.S. contingent
that did not attend the Moscow
Olympics due to President
Carter's decision to boycott the
Ciames. Now Moffet is shooting
for a berth as a participant in an
Olympics that will be marred by
Soviet boycott, and he can em
pathize with Soviet athletes.
" It's too bad all around. I feel
sorry for the athletes personally
because I went through the
same thing myself in 1980. I'm
sure all the athletes want to be
here, and I wish they could be in
I.os Angeles," he said.
"I'm lucky that the boycott
doesn't affect me much per
sonally as far as my races are
concerned," Moffet said.
"Robertas /hulpa will not be
there in 200, but he is the only
Eastern-bloc breaststroker
ranked ahead of me and so the
boycott is not so major in my
events as in others'.
"It would have been the ul
timate test to swim against the
strongest field, but the boycott
will not change my goal of win
ning. Sure, if I make the team,
in the back of my mind will be
the thought that it isn't the best
possible competition, but when
I'm swimming it will not make a
difference," Moffet added.
The absence of the Eastern
bloc countries is not on Moffet's
mind as he aims for the Trials
either. "The boycott is not det
rimental to my swimming be
cause it is still just as tough to
make the U.S. team, regardless
of what other nations will be
competing, and right now
making the team is my priority,"
Moffet said.
Oualifyinp for the Olympic
team hits changed since 19tiO.
Now only the top two swimmers
from each country per event can
qualify, a rule enacted during
the U.S. absence at the Moscow
Games. The intent of the rule is
to eliminate the opportunity for
one country to sweep an event,
as the United States has done
many times in the past.
The result of the rule is dra

matic, according to Moffet. "It
is a whole new ballgame, the
change makes an exponential
difference. It is so much harder
to get second than it is to get
third at the Trials. In some
events the competitors have vir
tually conceded one of the
spots, such as to Rick Carey (in
the backstroke), and are swim
ming for the second spot."
Moffet is currently ranked
second in the world in the two
breaststroke races, behind fel
low American Steve Lundquist.
The races at the Trials are ex
pected to be close
■'/ try n»( t<i think übaiit Steve
because 1 have no control over
what he does. I can only control
my own swimming. I can't make
Steve go faster or slower so I
can't be concerned with what he
is doing; I have to think of what
I am doing," Moffet explained.
When he made the 1980 team
as a self-described "long-shot,"
Moffet received his greatest

thrill from swimming. Moffet
explains, "I think the officials
were feeling pretty bad about us
not getting to swim, so we got to
be VIPs in Washington for a few
days and meet the president and
all that, and then we went to
China for a few days for a meet,
followed by Hong Kong. We
ended our trip in Hawaii, and
got to stay there for as long as
we wanted."
It's not surprising that he had
such a good time on the trip, for
the sophomore is known as a
fun-loving guy. "John's a great
tniv who loves \rir ami ts hlwhvn
a tun guy to t>c around," accor
ding to Stanford Men's Swim
Coach Skip Kenney. "Even on
his occassional bad days he is
fun to have around because he
jokes about his own grumpiness
and manages to improve his dis
position as well as cheer up
those around him."
Kenney brims with praise for
his sophomore sensation. "John

is successful without sacrificing
anything, and I say the more
power to him. He has taken his
God-given talent and worked
his tail off in the water to
become a phenomenonal swim
mer.
"He is probably one of the
most coachable great athletes I
have ever come across. He lis
tens to every word I say, and
then goes out and makes the
small changes that have made
him so good. I would love to be
able to take credit for his col
legiate successes, but the truth is
he wasun exceptionally talented
swimmer before he came to
Stanford.
"John gives 100 percent at
every practice, and is the key to
our medley relay team (which
broke the American record in
the event but was disqualified)
because he goes so fast. He
handles hard workouts and then
bounces back for more quickly,"
Kenney said. "He has a great

physique lor swimming — 1 guess
I should thank his parents for
his great genes."
It is in the area of appearanee
that Kenney can find fault with
his hreaststroker, sort of. He ex
plains, "If 1 were to make the
perfect swimmer. I would make
him uglier. 1 tease John about
his looks because it seemed like
for the longest time wherever
we went he always knew a group
of girls."
Is John Moffet a coach's
ideal? Kenney thinks so.
"Seriously, I would not change
John Moffet one bit 1
C'Oll 111.'*
Moffet has stopped out of
school to train for the Games,
and is living off campus with fel
low swimmer Dave Bottom in
an arrangement that is working
out well, according to Mof
fet. "We are in similar situa
tions. so it is nice to always have
someone there to talk to if any
problems arise."

The decision to stop out of
school was not an easy one. "I
had started talking about the
possibility of stopping out when
I was a freshman and last sum
mer I decided to do so. But
when I got back to school in the
fall I wanted to stay, and didn't
reach my final decision until
February. Now I'm really glad I
did because I can concentrate
on my swimming without other
pressures."
The concentration is going
well, according to Kenney.
"John's training indicates that
he is well on his way to breaking
the world rucord (in JOO),
and if anybody is going to beat
him they will have to break the
record to do it."
Moffet began swimming as an
I 1-year-old when he took a
competitive swimming course at
his local parks and recreation
department. His dad, a former
high school swimmer, had
predicted great things for his

son before John ever hit the
water. "My dad and my mom
thought 1 could he really good
and convinced me to try swim
ming. They've never told me
how they knew I would do well,
hut I've always wondered what
made them so certain." Mot'fet
said.
He began double workouts at
the age of 15. the start of the
Olympic year. A student both
in and out of the pool,
Mot'fet watched other swimmers
to pick up their advantages. "1
watched the strokes of top
swimmers to see what made
them good, and sometimes I
would copy them. I still use
various stroke techniques
sometimes to try things out. but
my stroke, especially my kick, is
different than anyone else's."
Mot'fet does not believe that
his swimming is hampering his
enjoyment of his time at Stan
ford. "1 miss out on some of the
things that regular students do,
but I haven't missed out as a
person. 1 get so much more out
of swimming that it is unques
tionably worth the time commit
ment. Any time that an athlete
thinks he is putting more into
his sport than he is getting out of
it, then it is time for him to get
out of athletics.
"I've been fortunate to get a
lot out of swimming. I've had
my education paid for, and I've
gotten to travel a lot and get the
opportunity to meet people
from many countries that I
couldn't have without swim
ming. I've trained with swim
mers from other countries and
really gotten to know them as
people and not just as names.
It's really fun and rewarding."
Swimming has certainly not
deprived Moffet of many typical
student endeavors. "I still like
to go out and have a good time,
it's just the way I am. But I keep
it all in perspective and try to
keep everyting mellow. All a lot
of partying does is make you
sick, and you can't trash your
body if you are a serious ath
lete," he said.
Kenney doesn't worry much
about his fun-loving swimmer.
"John gets serious at the big
meets. He goes off by himself
and psyches himself up for the
meet, tic doesn't need to rely on
the leam «i> get hi ran nH.liv.ilcJ.
He is a leader on this team by
example, dedicated to all that he
does."
Kenney looks forward to
coaching Moffet for two more
years, but wishes he had more
time. Kenney says,"I just wish I
had John for four more years.
When you coach a guy like him,
you wish he'd stay forever."


sophomore John Moffet has seen both sides of what an Olympic boycott is
ike. Moffet was the youngest member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, which

loss Geiciusehek/Uaily
was not allowed to participate in the Games, and is a candidate for this year's
team which will not face Eastern-bloc competition.

the 100- and 200-yard
hreaststroke and shares the
400 medley relay mark, is
aiming for a berth on the 1 9N4
Olympic team. He will swim in
the Olympic Trials at the end of
the month in hopes of becoming
a two-time Olympian.
Moffet was 16 when he
qualified for the 1980 Olympic
team as the youngest male
member of the U.S. contingent
that did not attend the Moscow
Olympics due to President
Carter's decision to boycott the
Ciames. Now Moffet is shooting
for a berth as a participant in an
Olympics that will be marred by
Soviet boycott, and he can em
pathize with Soviet athletes.
" It's too bad all around. I feel
sorry for the athletes personally
because I went through the
same thing myself in 1980. I'm
sure all the athletes want to be
here, and I wish they could be in
I.os Angeles," he said.
"I'm lucky that the boycott
doesn't affect me much per
sonally as far as my races are
concerned," Moffet said.
"Robertas /hulpa will not be
there in 200, but he is the only
Eastern-bloc breaststroker
ranked ahead of me and so the
boycott is not so major in my
events as in others'.
"It would have been the ul
timate test to swim against the
strongest field, but the boycott
will not change my goal of win
ning. Sure, if I make the team,
in the back of my mind will be
the thought that it isn't the best
possible competition, but when
I'm swimming it will not make a
difference," Moffet added.
The absence of the Eastern
bloc countries is not on Moffet's
mind as he aims for the Trials
either. "The boycott is not det
rimental to my swimming be
cause it is still just as tough to
make the U.S. team, regardless
of what other nations will be
competing, and right now
making the team is my priority,"
Moffet said.
Oualifyinp for the Olympic
team hits changed since 19tiO.
Now only the top two swimmers
from each country per event can
qualify, a rule enacted during
the U.S. absence at the Moscow
Games. The intent of the rule is
to eliminate the opportunity for
one country to sweep an event,
as the United States has done
many times in the past.
The result of the rule is dra

matic, according to Moffet. "It
is a whole new ballgame, the
change makes an exponential
difference. It is so much harder
to get second than it is to get
third at the Trials. In some
events the competitors have vir
tually conceded one of the
spots, such as to Rick Carey (in
the backstroke), and are swim
ming for the second spot."
Moffet is currently ranked
second in the world in the two
breaststroke races, behind fel
low American Steve Lundquist.
The races at the Trials are ex
pected to be close
■'/ try n»( t<i think übaiit Steve
because 1 have no control over
what he does. I can only control
my own swimming. I can't make
Steve go faster or slower so I
can't be concerned with what he
is doing; I have to think of what
I am doing," Moffet explained.
When he made the 1980 team
as a self-described "long-shot,"
Moffet received his greatest

thrill from swimming. Moffet
explains, "I think the officials
were feeling pretty bad about us
not getting to swim, so we got to
be VIPs in Washington for a few
days and meet the president and
all that, and then we went to
China for a few days for a meet,
followed by Hong Kong. We
ended our trip in Hawaii, and
got to stay there for as long as
we wanted."
It's not surprising that he had
such a good time on the trip, for
the sophomore is known as a
fun-loving guy. "John's a great
tniv who loves \rir ami ts hlwhvn
a tun guy to t>c around," accor
ding to Stanford Men's Swim
Coach Skip Kenney. "Even on
his occassional bad days he is
fun to have around because he
jokes about his own grumpiness
and manages to improve his dis
position as well as cheer up
those around him."
Kenney brims with praise for
his sophomore sensation. "John

is successful without sacrificing
anything, and I say the more
power to him. He has taken his
God-given talent and worked
his tail off in the water to
become a phenomenonal swim
mer.
"He is probably one of the
most coachable great athletes I
have ever come across. He lis
tens to every word I say, and
then goes out and makes the
small changes that have made
him so good. I would love to be
able to take credit for his col
legiate successes, but the truth is
he wasun exceptionally talented
swimmer before he came to
Stanford.
"John gives 100 percent at
every practice, and is the key to
our medley relay team (which
broke the American record in
the event but was disqualified)
because he goes so fast. He
handles hard workouts and then
bounces back for more quickly,"
Kenney said. "He has a great

physique lor swimming — 1 guess
I should thank his parents for
his great genes."
It is in the area of appearanee
that Kenney can find fault with
his hreaststroker, sort of. He ex
plains, "If 1 were to make the
perfect swimmer. I would make
him uglier. 1 tease John about
his looks because it seemed like
for the longest time wherever
we went he always knew a group
of girls."
Is John Moffet a coach's
ideal? Kenney thinks so.
"Seriously, I would not change
John Moffet one bit 1
C'Oll 111.'*
Moffet has stopped out of
school to train for the Games,
and is living off campus with fel
low swimmer Dave Bottom in
an arrangement that is working
out well, according to Mof
fet. "We are in similar situa
tions. so it is nice to always have
someone there to talk to if any
problems arise."

The decision to stop out of
school was not an easy one. "I
had started talking about the
possibility of stopping out when
I was a freshman and last sum
mer I decided to do so. But
when I got back to school in the
fall I wanted to stay, and didn't
reach my final decision until
February. Now I'm really glad I
did because I can concentrate
on my swimming without other
pressures."
The concentration is going
well, according to Kenney.
"John's training indicates that
he is well on his way to breaking
the world rucord (in JOO),
and if anybody is going to beat
him they will have to break the
record to do it."
Moffet began swimming as an
I 1-year-old when he took a
competitive swimming course at
his local parks and recreation
department. His dad, a former
high school swimmer, had
predicted great things for his

son before John ever hit the
water. "My dad and my mom
thought 1 could he really good
and convinced me to try swim
ming. They've never told me
how they knew I would do well,
hut I've always wondered what
made them so certain." Mot'fet
said.
He began double workouts at
the age of 15. the start of the
Olympic year. A student both
in and out of the pool,
Mot'fet watched other swimmers
to pick up their advantages. "1
watched the strokes of top
swimmers to see what made
them good, and sometimes I
would copy them. I still use
various stroke techniques
sometimes to try things out. but
my stroke, especially my kick, is
different than anyone else's."
Mot'fet does not believe that
his swimming is hampering his
enjoyment of his time at Stan
ford. "1 miss out on some of the
things that regular students do,
but I haven't missed out as a
person. 1 get so much more out
of swimming that it is unques
tionably worth the time commit
ment. Any time that an athlete
thinks he is putting more into
his sport than he is getting out of
it, then it is time for him to get
out of athletics.
"I've been fortunate to get a
lot out of swimming. I've had
my education paid for, and I've
gotten to travel a lot and get the
opportunity to meet people
from many countries that I
couldn't have without swim
ming. I've trained with swim
mers from other countries and
really gotten to know them as
people and not just as names.
It's really fun and rewarding."
Swimming has certainly not
deprived Moffet of many typical
student endeavors. "I still like
to go out and have a good time,
it's just the way I am. But I keep
it all in perspective and try to
keep everyting mellow. All a lot
of partying does is make you
sick, and you can't trash your
body if you are a serious ath
lete," he said.
Kenney doesn't worry much
about his fun-loving swimmer.
"John gets serious at the big
meets. He goes off by himself
and psyches himself up for the
meet, tic doesn't need to rely on
the leam «i> get hi ran nH.liv.ilcJ.
He is a leader on this team by
example, dedicated to all that he
does."
Kenney looks forward to
coaching Moffet for two more
years, but wishes he had more
time. Kenney says,"I just wish I
had John for four more years.
When you coach a guy like him,
you wish he'd stay forever."


sophomore John Moffet has seen both sides of what an Olympic boycott is
ike. Moffet was the youngest member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, which

loss Geiciusehek/Uaily
was not allowed to participate in the Games, and is a candidate for this year's
team which will not face Eastern-bloc competition.

Olympic team. He will swim in
the Olympic Trials at the end of
the month in hopes of becoming
a two-time Olympian.
Moffet was 16 when he
qualified for the 1980 Olympic
team as the youngest male
member of the U.S. contingent
that did not attend the Moscow
Olympics due to President
Carter's decision to boycott the
Ciames. Now Moffet is shooting
for a berth as a participant in an
Olympics that will be marred by
Soviet boycott, and he can em
pathize with Soviet athletes.
" It's too bad all around. I feel
sorry for the athletes personally
because I went through the
same thing myself in 1980. I'm
sure all the athletes want to be
here, and I wish they could be in
I.os Angeles," he said.
"I'm lucky that the boycott
doesn't affect me much per
sonally as far as my races are
concerned," Moffet said.
"Robertas /hulpa will not be
there in 200, but he is the only
Eastern-bloc breaststroker
ranked ahead of me and so the
boycott is not so major in my
events as in others'.
"It would have been the ul
timate test to swim against the
strongest field, but the boycott
will not change my goal of win
ning. Sure, if I make the team,
in the back of my mind will be
the thought that it isn't the best
possible competition, but when
I'm swimming it will not make a
difference," Moffet added.
The absence of the Eastern
bloc countries is not on Moffet's
mind as he aims for the Trials
either. "The boycott is not det
rimental to my swimming be
cause it is still just as tough to
make the U.S. team, regardless
of what other nations will be
competing, and right now
making the team is my priority,"
Moffet said.
Oualifyinp for the Olympic
team hits changed since 19tiO.
Now only the top two swimmers
from each country per event can
qualify, a rule enacted during
the U.S. absence at the Moscow
Games. The intent of the rule is
to eliminate the opportunity for
one country to sweep an event,
as the United States has done
many times in the past.
The result of the rule is dra

matic, according to Moffet. "It
is a whole new ballgame, the
change makes an exponential
difference. It is so much harder
to get second than it is to get
third at the Trials. In some
events the competitors have vir
tually conceded one of the
spots, such as to Rick Carey (in
the backstroke), and are swim
ming for the second spot."
Moffet is currently ranked
second in the world in the two
breaststroke races, behind fel
low American Steve Lundquist.
The races at the Trials are ex
pected to be close
■'/ try n»( t<i think übaiit Steve
because 1 have no control over
what he does. I can only control
my own swimming. I can't make
Steve go faster or slower so I
can't be concerned with what he
is doing; I have to think of what
I am doing," Moffet explained.
When he made the 1980 team
as a self-described "long-shot,"
Moffet received his greatest

thrill from swimming. Moffet
explains, "I think the officials
were feeling pretty bad about us
not getting to swim, so we got to
be VIPs in Washington for a few
days and meet the president and
all that, and then we went to
China for a few days for a meet,
followed by Hong Kong. We
ended our trip in Hawaii, and
got to stay there for as long as
we wanted."
It's not surprising that he had
such a good time on the trip, for
the sophomore is known as a
fun-loving guy. "John's a great
tniv who loves \rir ami ts hlwhvn
a tun guy to t>c around," accor
ding to Stanford Men's Swim
Coach Skip Kenney. "Even on
his occassional bad days he is
fun to have around because he
jokes about his own grumpiness
and manages to improve his dis
position as well as cheer up
those around him."
Kenney brims with praise for
his sophomore sensation. "John

is successful without sacrificing
anything, and I say the more
power to him. He has taken his
God-given talent and worked
his tail off in the water to
become a phenomenonal swim
mer.
"He is probably one of the
most coachable great athletes I
have ever come across. He lis
tens to every word I say, and
then goes out and makes the
small changes that have made
him so good. I would love to be
able to take credit for his col
legiate successes, but the truth is
he wasun exceptionally talented
swimmer before he came to
Stanford.
"John gives 100 percent at
every practice, and is the key to
our medley relay team (which
broke the American record in
the event but was disqualified)
because he goes so fast. He
handles hard workouts and then
bounces back for more quickly,"
Kenney said. "He has a great

physique lor swimming — 1 guess
I should thank his parents for
his great genes."
It is in the area of appearanee
that Kenney can find fault with
his hreaststroker, sort of. He ex
plains, "If 1 were to make the
perfect swimmer. I would make
him uglier. 1 tease John about
his looks because it seemed like
for the longest time wherever
we went he always knew a group
of girls."
Is John Moffet a coach's
ideal? Kenney thinks so.
"Seriously, I would not change
John Moffet one bit 1

Moffet has stopped out of
school to train for the Games,
and is living off campus with fel
low swimmer Dave Bottom in
an arrangement that is working
out well, according to Mof
fet. "We are in similar situa
tions. so it is nice to always have
someone there to talk to if any
problems arise."

The decision to stop out of
school was not an easy one. "I
had started talking about the
possibility of stopping out when
I was a freshman and last sum
mer I decided to do so. But
when I got back to school in the
fall I wanted to stay, and didn't
reach my final decision until
February. Now I'm really glad I
did because I can concentrate
on my swimming without other
pressures."
The concentration is going
well, according to Kenney.
"John's training indicates that
he is well on his way to breaking
the world rucord (in JOO),
and if anybody is going to beat
him they will have to break the
record to do it."
Moffet began swimming as an
I 1-year-old when he took a
competitive swimming course at
his local parks and recreation
department. His dad, a former
high school swimmer, had
predicted great things for his

son before John ever hit the
water. "My dad and my mom
thought 1 could he really good
and convinced me to try swim
ming. They've never told me
how they knew I would do well,
hut I've always wondered what
made them so certain." Mot'fet
said.
He began double workouts at
the age of 15. the start of the
Olympic year. A student both
in and out of the pool,
Mot'fet watched other swimmers
to pick up their advantages. "1
watched the strokes of top
swimmers to see what made
them good, and sometimes I
would copy them. I still use
various stroke techniques
sometimes to try things out. but
my stroke, especially my kick, is
different than anyone else's."
Mot'fet does not believe that
his swimming is hampering his
enjoyment of his time at Stan
ford. "1 miss out on some of the
things that regular students do,
but I haven't missed out as a
person. 1 get so much more out
of swimming that it is unques
tionably worth the time commit
ment. Any time that an athlete
thinks he is putting more into
his sport than he is getting out of
it, then it is time for him to get
out of athletics.
"I've been fortunate to get a
lot out of swimming. I've had
my education paid for, and I've
gotten to travel a lot and get the
opportunity to meet people
from many countries that I
couldn't have without swim
ming. I've trained with swim
mers from other countries and
really gotten to know them as
people and not just as names.
It's really fun and rewarding."
Swimming has certainly not
deprived Moffet of many typical
student endeavors. "I still like
to go out and have a good time,
it's just the way I am. But I keep
it all in perspective and try to
keep everyting mellow. All a lot
of partying does is make you
sick, and you can't trash your
body if you are a serious ath
lete," he said.
Kenney doesn't worry much
about his fun-loving swimmer.
"John gets serious at the big
meets. He goes off by himself
and psyches himself up for the
meet, tic doesn't need to rely on
the leam «i> get hi ran nH.liv.ilcJ.
He is a leader on this team by
example, dedicated to all that he
does."
Kenney looks forward to
coaching Moffet for two more
years, but wishes he had more
time. Kenney says,"I just wish I
had John for four more years.
When you coach a guy like him,
you wish he'd stay forever."


sophomore John Moffet has seen both sides of what an Olympic boycott is
ike. Moffet was the youngest member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, which

loss Geiciusehek/Uaily
was not allowed to participate in the Games, and is a candidate for this year's
team which will not face Eastern-bloc competition.
