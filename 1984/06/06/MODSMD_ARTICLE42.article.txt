# Haines makes class and athletics work
## 
### SCOTT LUDEKE 
George Haines, like other
Stanford coaches, believes it is
quite possible for students to
participate in a nationally pow
erful athletic program while
doing well academically at Stan
lord. His women's swimming
program fully supports this
belief.
Hie Cardinal women success
fully balanced academic com
petence with first and second
places in 1 982 and 1983 NCAA
competition. This balance is
made possible by Haines'
recognition of the needs of the
women's academic schedules.
According to free-styler
Marybeth Linzmeier, "George
has a real concern for us other
than just as swimmers. He
makes the Stanford women's
program really enjoyable."
Linzmeier won eight gold
medals in NCAA competition.
Haines' coaching style is
marked by an ability to individ
ually diagnose his swimmers. He
directs each swimmer toward
achieving her potential rather
than going blindly for the gold:
"If you only coach for No. 1,
you don't last long. You have to
coach for what the athlete gets
out of it."
Itaincs will carry tUis 'satne
concern for the individual to the
Olympic Games this summer, in
his seventh appearance on the

U.S. coaching staff. The staff
has already distributed ques
tionnaires to potential Olympic
swimmers and their coaches de
signed to result in individually
tailored programs for each ath
lete.
Haines regrets the Soviet
boycott of the Olympics but is
currently thinking more of the
U.S. Olympic Trials in July than
of the Soviet's absence later in
the summer. He considers the
U.S. Olympic Trials to be "the
best swim meet ever held" due
to the very stiff competition at
home, and is now coaching
several Cardinal women in their
effort to make the Olympic
squad.
After 34 years of coaching
(three at Stanford), one might
think that George Haines must
be ready to retire. In fact, this
argument has been used by
competing coaches as a ploy to
snare desirable recruits. But
Haines doesn't appear about to
quit. He recently wore to
NCAA competition a T-shirt
saying, "No, I'm not fired. No,
I'm not tired. No, this job's not
open." Haines says. "I'm going
to coach as long as I'm having
fun." Judging from the energy,
enthusiasm, and good health he
not*- UispUiysvand by flit: succcas
and good humor of his squad, it
looks as if he may well be having
ftm for many vears to come.
