### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Stanford freshman Derrick Rostagno earned a
spot on the 1 9K4 U.S. Olympic Tennis Team with
a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 semifinal victory over Eric Amend
of Rolling Hills Saturday at the Olympic Trials in
New York. Rostagno had earlier advanced to the
semifinals with a 6-1, 6-4 win over Richard
Matuszewski.
Rostagno was the only qualifier among the
three Stanford men who had advanced into
Friday's quarterfinals. John Letts fell victim to
Amend by a 6-0, 3-6, 6-3 score, while No. 7 seed
Jim Grabb lost a close match to Kelly Jones of San
Diego, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
In the women's trials. No. 7 seed Patty Fendick
was the only Stanford player to make it past the
first round, as teammates Leigh Anne Eldredge
and Stephanie Savides were both knocked out
early. Fendick made it to the quarterfinals, where
she lost to No. 2 seed Gretchen Rush of Trinity
and Pittsburgh, 6-4, 6-4.
Joining Rostagno on the men's team will be
Jones and Amend, along with Jimmy Arias, who
received a berth on the team without having to
qualify. Rush and Andrea Leand qualified for the
women's team and will join Kathy Horvath and
Andrea Jaeger.
Jones wrapped up his spot on the team with a 6-
3, 6-4 win over No. 5 seed Randy Reneberg of
Houston. Reneberg had made it to the semifinals
with a 6-2, 7-5 victory over John C'arras of Hol
land. Mich. After dropping his semifinal match to
Rostagno, Amend gained the final opening by
defeating Reneberg in the third-place match. The
final match was not played since Rostagno and
Jones had already made the team.

After defeating Fendick, Rush secured a spot
on the team with a 7-5, 6-2 decision over Cynthia
MacGregor of San Diego State and Palos Verdes
Estates. Leand gained the other spot by defeating
Maeve Ouinlan of Northwestern and Northfield,
111., 6-1. 6-2, after having earlier gotten by Kirstm
Dreyer of Weston, Conn., 7-5, 6-1. Again the
final match was not played.
Leand and Rush were the No. I and 2 seeds in
the women's bracket, a contrast to the men's
bracket, where none of the eight seeded players
made the team.
Rostagno began his successful bid at the Olym
pic team last Wednesday with a 7-5, 5-7, 6-1 first
round victory over fellow Rancho Palos Verdes
native Jim Pugh. The next day he upset No. 8 seed
Steve DeVries of Sansun and UC-Berkeley, 2-6,
7-5, 6-1, to move into the quarterfinals against
Matuszewski, who himself had earlier defeated
No. 1 seed Lawson Duncan of Ashville, N.C., 6-1,
7-6, in the first round.
Letts and Grabb had also won their first two
matches. Letts defeated Eugene Herzbacher of
Findlay, Ohio, 6-3, 6-2, and No. 6 seed Bobby
Blair of Orlando, Fla., 6-1, 6-0, before losing to
Amend, while Grabb put away Brian Flowers of
Westfield, N.J., 6-3, 6-0, and Jeff Hersh of Rock
ville, Md., 6-4, 7-5, before succumbing to Jones.
Fendick also won her first two matches. She
defeated Marianne Werdel of Bakersfield —
sister of Cardinal sophomore Alyce Werdel — 6-
1, 6-2, and Cheryl Jones of USC and Los Angeles,
6-4, 6-4, before falling to Rush.
Eldredge and Savides both lost tough first
round matches.
