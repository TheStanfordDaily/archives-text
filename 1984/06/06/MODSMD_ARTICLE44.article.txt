# Warner gets competition on a dare
## 
### TRASK LEONARD 
Stanford field hockey player
and Olympic luger Bonnie
Warner issued a dare on Mon
day, and several members of the
Stanford community took her
up on the offer. Her dare: to
speed down an ice-packed trail
while supine on a sled-type con
traption. Her goal: to get people
interested in competitive luge.
Warner competed in the 1984
Winter Olympic Games at
Saravejo, Yugoslavia, and
found the depth of American
competition, especially among
the women, inadequate. So she
decided to do something about
it.
"There are so many good ath
letes out there, but a lot of them
never get the opportunity to ex
periment with luging. There is
just no outlet for people around
here to do anything with the
luge. I tried to provide an op
portunity for others. And that's
why I held the California Luge

Team Selection," explained
Warner.
About 50 people'showed up
Monday at Woodside High
School to compete for a chance
to work out at the U.S. winter
training site in Lake Placid,
N.Y. Of those 50, three Stan
ford students had enough talent
to make the 'A' team, the high
est level of competition.
Craig Willey, Scott Gode and
Caroline Paul, all members of
Stanford's successful crew pro
gram, had the upper body
strength and coordination nec
essary to qualify for the U.S.
Luge Association-sponsored
event in Lake Placid this
December.
The luge involves a great deal
of strength as well as talent, so
the prospects underwent a
physical screening to.sr bofure
trying out the actual device.
Those who tried out used luges
equipped with wheels to go

down a hill off Sand Hill Road
near Highway 280.
"We were supposed to get
several luges with wheels on the
bottom donated by the Luge
Association, but they never
showed up, so I had to im
provise. Luckily, we were able
to use my luge from the Olym
pics and one belonging to a fel
low luger from Berkeley," said
Warner.
Ironically, Warner's interest
in competitive luge began when
she entered a contest a few
years ago sponsered by Safeway
Markets.
"1 was just doing it for fun.
and found that 1 really liked it,
so 1 continued, until I decided !
wanted a shot at the Olympics,"
explained Warner.
Her athletic talent combined
with lt€.-r strength /'<»• ,in
easy transition to the new sport.
In fact, she developed so well
that she was able to qualify for

the Olympic team.
At Saravejo, she suffered a
spill and was only able to finish
15th. Still this was the highest
linish ever by an American wo
man. This prompted Warner to
take an interest in giving other
women the opportunity to com
pete in the Olympics.
"I was in eighth place after the
first round and decided to take a
risk and try to move up dramati
cally in the standings. Unfortun
ately when I did that, 1 crashed
and finished 15th. Then I
realized that since no other
American had done that well
before, something needed to be
done. A country that had been
very competitive in other sports
should not have been so weak in
the luge," said Warner.
"Besides, 1 need some com
/>«rti-titin. * * she- *tiiU*j<J with it
laugh.
Warner remains very optimis
tic about the chances of the

people who qualified at her pro
gram.
"I bet that within two years or
so one-half or so of the competi
tors can he on the national team
for the '88 Winter Olympics,"
she said.
Warner herself plans on con
tinuing her training all the way
to the Games, which will he held
in Seoul, Korea, where she will
be shooting for a medal this
time.
"This year I was just trying to
get some experience and see
what 1 could do. But in 1988 1
hope to be in serious contention
for a medal. This event no
longer needs to be dominated
by the Europeans," said
Warner.
Warner's attitude is best
captured by the T-shirts pro
i/tic*d ft a the.* cfv-osj/. which
"I dare you." With such atten
tion given to the cause, her wish
might just come true.
