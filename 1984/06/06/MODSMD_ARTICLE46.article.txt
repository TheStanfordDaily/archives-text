## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Seniors PattiSue Plumer and Carol Cad\
and sophomore Alison Wiley led the Stan
lord women's track and field team to a
third-place finish at the NCAA Outdoor
Track it Field Championships in Eugene.
Ore. this weekend.
Finishing ahead of the Cardinal women
were Florida State with 145 points and Ten
nessee with 124. Stanford scored 71 points
with two first-, three second- and one
eighth-place finish.
"We're pleased that we got third, but
we're not pleased about the way we got
third." Coach Brooks Johnson said, noting
that only three of the 10 Stanford women
competing contributed to the point total.
"We basically stunk up the meet." he
said.
But it was Stanford's highest finish ever in
the women's NCAA outdoor champion
ships.
Plumer, the national collegiate record
holder at 5000 meters, won her speciality
event on Saturday in a meet record
15:39.38, edging out teammate Wiley, who
finished second in 15:45.52.
"I'm so happy," Plumer said after captur
ing her first NCAA outdoor title. "The
team's coming in third made me as happy as
winning my race," she added.
On Friday. Plumer took second for the
third straight year in the 3000-meter final,
finishing behind Wisconsin's Cathy Branta
with a 9:03.51 clocking. Wiley finished
eighth in the race with a time of 9:14.19.
"We went out (in the 3000) with a differ
ent strategy," Plumer explained. "We were

concerned with a really competitive effort,
so we went out really hard."
She said her silver plaque from Friday s
3000 was "incenti\e enough" to win the
5000 the following day.
"1 was not going to come in second
again." she said.
Cadv surprised no one with her spectacu
lar discus and shot put performances.
Her discus throw of 198 feet, 5 inches
against the wind Saturda> won that event, in
which she placed second in 1983. Earlier in
the week, she unleashed a 206-6. the best
throw by a collegian this year.
"I was glad to win but I need to work out
some technique points.' she si)ld - ,l *
never a good idea to throw a (personal best)
in the qualifying round and then to throw
eight feet shorter in the finals."
The defending NCAA champion in the
shot put. Cady placed second in that event
on Friday with a toss of 54-5 1/4. San Diego
State's Ramona Pagel won with a meet
record 56-8.
The only other Cardinal woman to qualify
for the finals was sophomore Denise Gaz
tambide, whose leap of 5-10 in the high
jump earned a 14th place.
Team members who competed in the
NCAA meet but did not qualify for the
finals included junior Regina Jacobs in the
800- and 1500-meter runs, senior Marcia
Martin in the 800, senior Mary Osborne in
the javelin, sophomore Pam Dukes in the
shot put and sophomore Karen Nickerson in
the discus.
Freshman Cory Schubert, who had
qualified to run in both the 3000 and 5000,

did not run because of an injury.
• The problem was mental toughness,"
Johnson said of the Cardinal women who
did not quality.
•Duplicating the times they needed to
qualify for the meet will usually get them
into the finals, and duplicating those times
again usually means they'll (finish among
the top 12 in their event and thus) score
points. So all they needed to do was repeat
something they already did, he said.
"I would have liked to have gone out with
a better team effort," Plumer said. "There
was no one on our team who couldn't have
qualified. . . . It's frustrating when potential
goes unfulfilled.
"People think track isn't a team sport."
she continued. "It is definitely a team effort.
You need support to do well."
Cady said people expect a great deal 112 rom
every member of a successful team and that
not living up to those expectations is just
part of a learning experience.
"The meet was not a disappointment,"
she said. "All good athletes remember the
time they bombed. 1 sure do."
In the men's championships, junior Shaun
Pickering scored Stanford's only points with
an eighth-place hammer throw of 221-6.
Six of his teammates participated in the
meet but none qualified for the finals.
They were: senior Jim Smith, junior Jeff
Atkinson, junior Brian Pettingill and fresh
man Marc Oleson, all in the 1500-meter
run; junior Brian Masterson in the hammer
and senior David Frank in the 3000-meter
steeplechase.

were Florida State with 145 points and Ten
nessee with 124. Stanford scored 71 points
with two first-, three second- and one
eighth-place finish.
"We're pleased that we got third, but
we're not pleased about the way we got
third." Coach Brooks Johnson said, noting
that only three of the 10 Stanford women
competing contributed to the point total.
"We basically stunk up the meet." he
said.
But it was Stanford's highest finish ever in
the women's NCAA outdoor champion
ships.
Plumer, the national collegiate record
holder at 5000 meters, won her speciality
event on Saturday in a meet record
15:39.38, edging out teammate Wiley, who
finished second in 15:45.52.
"I'm so happy," Plumer said after captur
ing her first NCAA outdoor title. "The
team's coming in third made me as happy as
winning my race," she added.
On Friday. Plumer took second for the
third straight year in the 3000-meter final,
finishing behind Wisconsin's Cathy Branta
with a 9:03.51 clocking. Wiley finished
eighth in the race with a time of 9:14.19.
"We went out (in the 3000) with a differ
ent strategy," Plumer explained. "We were

concerned with a really competitive effort,
so we went out really hard."
She said her silver plaque from Friday s
3000 was "incenti\e enough" to win the
5000 the following day.
"1 was not going to come in second
again." she said.
Cadv surprised no one with her spectacu
lar discus and shot put performances.
Her discus throw of 198 feet, 5 inches
against the wind Saturda> won that event, in
which she placed second in 1983. Earlier in
the week, she unleashed a 206-6. the best
throw by a collegian this year.
"I was glad to win but I need to work out
some technique points.' she si)ld - ,l *
never a good idea to throw a (personal best)
in the qualifying round and then to throw
eight feet shorter in the finals."
The defending NCAA champion in the
shot put. Cady placed second in that event
on Friday with a toss of 54-5 1/4. San Diego
State's Ramona Pagel won with a meet
record 56-8.
The only other Cardinal woman to qualify
for the finals was sophomore Denise Gaz
tambide, whose leap of 5-10 in the high
jump earned a 14th place.
Team members who competed in the
NCAA meet but did not qualify for the
finals included junior Regina Jacobs in the
800- and 1500-meter runs, senior Marcia
Martin in the 800, senior Mary Osborne in
the javelin, sophomore Pam Dukes in the
shot put and sophomore Karen Nickerson in
the discus.
Freshman Cory Schubert, who had
qualified to run in both the 3000 and 5000,

did not run because of an injury.
• The problem was mental toughness,"
Johnson said of the Cardinal women who
did not quality.
•Duplicating the times they needed to
qualify for the meet will usually get them
into the finals, and duplicating those times
again usually means they'll (finish among
the top 12 in their event and thus) score
points. So all they needed to do was repeat
something they already did, he said.
"I would have liked to have gone out with
a better team effort," Plumer said. "There
was no one on our team who couldn't have
qualified. . . . It's frustrating when potential
goes unfulfilled.
"People think track isn't a team sport."
she continued. "It is definitely a team effort.
You need support to do well."
Cady said people expect a great deal 112 rom
every member of a successful team and that
not living up to those expectations is just
part of a learning experience.
"The meet was not a disappointment,"
she said. "All good athletes remember the
time they bombed. 1 sure do."
In the men's championships, junior Shaun
Pickering scored Stanford's only points with
an eighth-place hammer throw of 221-6.
Six of his teammates participated in the
meet but none qualified for the finals.
They were: senior Jim Smith, junior Jeff
Atkinson, junior Brian Pettingill and fresh
man Marc Oleson, all in the 1500-meter
run; junior Brian Masterson in the hammer
and senior David Frank in the 3000-meter
steeplechase.
