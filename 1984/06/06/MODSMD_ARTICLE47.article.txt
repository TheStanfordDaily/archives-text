# Tigers take Stephens in draft
## 
### ROB ZWEIG Stuff sportswriter 
The Stanford baseball team
ended its 1984 season at the
NCAA West II Regionals in
Tempe last week, but for two
Card seniors the end of their
final collegiate campaign also
marked the beginning of a

three-week wait that may lead
to a professional career.
Centerfielder Darryl Ste
phens was chosen by the Detroit
Tigers in the second round of
the secondary phase of Major
League Baseball's annual
amateur free-agent draft that
began Monday in New York.

Teammate John Radtke was not
taken in the first two rounds but
is expected to be chosen. Only
juniors and seniors are eligible
to be drafted.
Results of the first two rounds
of the draft were released yes
terday, but the remaining
choices will not be disclosed un
til June 12. Pacific-10 Southern
Division stars Mark McGwire
(USC), Shane Mack (UCLA)
and Oddibe McDowell
(Arizona State) were named in
the first round as the 10th, I Ith
and 1 2th picks respectively.
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess said that he has not
been in contact with any profes
sional scouts and, as a result, he
is as unsure as anyone. "I'm
sure they'll he drafted." he said,
"hut in which round is hard to
say. I can't even make a good
guess."
At the beginning of this year
speculation on the prospects of
pro careers for either player
might have been considered a
bit foolish. Radtke entered his
senior year with a career record
of 7-6 on the Farm and
Marquess penciled the right
hander in as his third starter, be
hind Brian Myers and Steve
Cottrell.
But a shoulder injury
sidelined Myers and Cottrell
struggled in the early season,
leaving the door open for
Radtke. The Westminster
native made the most of the op
portunity with an 8-2 season
mark and a 3.23 earned run
average that propelled him
toward All-Pac-10 honors.
Radtke indicated Monday

that he hopes to be chosen as
early as round five and as late as
the 10th round.
For Stephens, this season
began as a rehabilitation proj
ect. He missed the entire 1983
campaign with a serious knee
injury. As a consequence, he
may have been a shade slower in
center field; nevertheless, Ste
phens bounced back to display
the defensive genius that Car
dinal fans had come to expect
from the native of Spokane,
Wash.
Offensively, Stephens
finished the year with a rush,
capturing the team batting title
with a .344 average. Stephens
earned All-Pac-10 honorable
mention status by supplement
ing his average with seven home
runs and 39 runs batted in. He
also made the all-tournament
team at the NCAA Regionals.
"I think the key thing with
Stephens is that he's shown that
he's physically able to play,"
said Marquess in sizing up the
outfielder's prospects. "He had
his best year in his four years
here and I think he showed the
scouts what he can do."
The Card's pilot also noted
that All-Pac-10 shortstop John
Verducci and honorable men
tion selection Pete Stanicek,
both juniors, may have a chance
at being dfafted.
Two years ago, junior second
sacker Steve Buechele fled the
Farm for the Texas Ranger or
ganization. Last year three
Stanford seniors were selected
and opted to turn professional:
Mike Aldrcte (San Francisco),
Eric Hardgrave (San Diego)
and Vince Sakowski (Texas).
