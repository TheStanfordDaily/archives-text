## Good beef credentials back Harris' 
### JULIE RYAN 
Harris' Restaurant
2100 Van Ness Avenue
San Francisco
673-1888
Relatives coming to town
soon and you're tired of jokes
about California and its flaky
habits? Are you looking for a
restaurant that J.R. types
wouldn't be embarrassed to be
seen in? II so there is one new
restaurant in San Francisco that
may be perfect. The specialty is
beef, the atmosphere no
nonsense elegant, and the food
top quality. It is called Harris'
and its owner Ann Harris is con
vinced that it will make obsolete
her statement that "San Fran
cisco needs a good steak
house."
In a time when many restau
rants are clones, franchises or
enterprises owned by a group of
businessmen who know less
about food than they know
about tax write-offs, it's nice to
see a restaurant where the
owner is there and runs the
show. Harris has been involved
in every phase of opening the
restaurant from picking the site
to greeting the guests when they
arrive, and the personal com
mitment should show in your
meal.
It's not surprising that beef is
the star at Harris' because Ann
Harris and her late husband
Jack Harris, who died in 1981,
owned one of the largest beef
and cattlc businesses in the

United States. Those of you
who have driven south on Inter
state 5 may have noticed it and
perhaps you have eaten at the
Harris Restaurant, which Ann
Harris ran for several years. So
you can see that she's not just a
dabbler in beef; she's got
credentials.
What is now Harris' used to
be Grisson's, a 50-year-old and
once highly popular San Fran
cisco steak-house which had
recently become a bit run-down.
"You wouldn't recognize the
place now," said Harris since
she raised the ceilings, added
chandeliers, and redid the
kitchen.
The restaurant is made up of
four rooms. The largest is the
dining room with about 20
booths and tables, two huge
brass chandeliers, and large
potted plants in the center. One
side of the room features a huge
mural of the King's River Ranch
painted by Barnaby Conroy.

boy hat and horses sits amid the
trees and the river.
The bar may be the highlight
of the place. It was built in 1900
and has been moved around the
country before landing at Har
ris'. The dark handcarved wood
bar is opposite an even older
mural which shows scenes of
San Francisco past. Off from the
bar is a small room called the li
brary which features a large
painting of Jack Harris and, you
guessed it, books. Somehow it's
easy to visualize a bunch of cow

hoy types smoking cigars and
playing cards in this room.
I went to Harris' for the
opening of the restaurant, so the
full range of the menu wasn't
available. However, for ap
petizers I did sample the fried
zucchini ($3.25), the fried
mushrooms ($3.50), and the
raw vegetables ($3.50). The
fried zucchini and mushrooms
were light and good and raw
vegetables will be raw
vegetables. Other appetizers on
the menu are Harris' beef pate
($4.25), smoked salmon
($6.25), and sturgeon caviar
($22). This is obviously not a
steak house in the same league
as the Sizzler.
The roast prime rib was juicy
and tender and was served with
freshly grated horseradish. You
can order two sizes, the Harris
Cut ($13.95) or the executive
cut ($16.95). The menu also in
cludes items such as filet mignon
($15.95), broiled sweetbreads
($12.95), and sliced roast filet
bordelaise ($15.95).
For those of you who cannot
live by beef alone, the chef
prepares a fresh fish each day.
I.amb chops ($16.95), roast
duckling ($13.95) or breast of
chicken ($11.95) are other
would-be choices.
The dinners are served with
fresh vegetables and Texas red
potatoes, though salads and
soups must be ordered a la carte.
A hot and cold soup is offered
each day and salads range from
crabmeat, grapefruit and

avocado ($4.M3) to mixed
greens ($2.95).
A meat counter at the en
trance of the restaurant also
sells cuts of beef from the Harris
Company. A sign above the
counter reads "Eat wisely. Eat
beef."
The restaurant will be open
for lunch starting June 1 1 and
the menu is more diverse. Eggs
benedict ($6.75), tostadas
($5.50). Harrisburgers ($6.50),
steak tartare ($9.50) and Texas
style chili ($4.75) are a few ex
amples.
The Garden Room is
decorated in whites and greens
with lots of light streaming in
the windows. It can be reserved
for large parties and can be ar
ranged for dancing.
The outside of the restaurant
is a tasteful blend of orangish
paint and green awnings.
However, one of the restau
rant's best features is under
ground. It's the large parking lot
which eliminates the usual
hassle of finding a space in the
city.
You probably know some
body who would love this res
taurant. A beef and potato lover
who usually hates being dragged
out to dinner. Harris' definitely
has something to offer, and it
will be interesting to see if San
Franciscans will accept this
return to traditional American
good eatine.

easy to visualize a bunch of cow

hoy types smoking cigars and
playing cards in this room.
I went to Harris' for the
opening of the restaurant, so the
full range of the menu wasn't
available. However, for ap
petizers I did sample the fried
zucchini ($3.25), the fried
mushrooms ($3.50), and the
raw vegetables ($3.50). The
fried zucchini and mushrooms
were light and good and raw
vegetables will be raw
vegetables. Other appetizers on
the menu are Harris' beef pate
($4.25), smoked salmon
($6.25), and sturgeon caviar
($22). This is obviously not a
steak house in the same league
as the Sizzler.
The roast prime rib was juicy
and tender and was served with
freshly grated horseradish. You
can order two sizes, the Harris
Cut ($13.95) or the executive
cut ($16.95). The menu also in
cludes items such as filet mignon
($15.95), broiled sweetbreads
($12.95), and sliced roast filet
bordelaise ($15.95).
For those of you who cannot
live by beef alone, the chef
prepares a fresh fish each day.
I.amb chops ($16.95), roast
duckling ($13.95) or breast of
chicken ($11.95) are other
would-be choices.
The dinners are served with
fresh vegetables and Texas red
potatoes, though salads and
soups must be ordered a la carte.
A hot and cold soup is offered
each day and salads range from
crabmeat, grapefruit and

avocado ($4.M3) to mixed
greens ($2.95).
A meat counter at the en
trance of the restaurant also
sells cuts of beef from the Harris
Company. A sign above the
counter reads "Eat wisely. Eat
beef."
The restaurant will be open
for lunch starting June 1 1 and
the menu is more diverse. Eggs
benedict ($6.75), tostadas
($5.50). Harrisburgers ($6.50),
steak tartare ($9.50) and Texas
style chili ($4.75) are a few ex
amples.
The Garden Room is
decorated in whites and greens
with lots of light streaming in
the windows. It can be reserved
for large parties and can be ar
ranged for dancing.
The outside of the restaurant
is a tasteful blend of orangish
paint and green awnings.
However, one of the restau
rant's best features is under
ground. It's the large parking lot
which eliminates the usual
hassle of finding a space in the
city.
You probably know some
body who would love this res
taurant. A beef and potato lover
who usually hates being dragged
out to dinner. Harris' definitely
has something to offer, and it
will be interesting to see if San
Franciscans will accept this
return to traditional American
good eatine.

Harris' Restaurant
2100 Van Ness Avenue
San Francisco
673-1888
Relatives coming to town
soon and you're tired of jokes
about California and its flaky
habits? Are you looking for a
restaurant that J.R. types
wouldn't be embarrassed to be
seen in? II so there is one new
restaurant in San Francisco that
may be perfect. The specialty is
beef, the atmosphere no
nonsense elegant, and the food
top quality. It is called Harris'
and its owner Ann Harris is con
vinced that it will make obsolete
her statement that "San Fran
cisco needs a good steak
house."
In a time when many restau
rants are clones, franchises or
enterprises owned by a group of
businessmen who know less
about food than they know
about tax write-offs, it's nice to
see a restaurant where the
owner is there and runs the
show. Harris has been involved
in every phase of opening the
restaurant from picking the site
to greeting the guests when they
arrive, and the personal com
mitment should show in your
meal.
It's not surprising that beef is
the star at Harris' because Ann
Harris and her late husband
Jack Harris, who died in 1981,
owned one of the largest beef
and cattlc businesses in the

United States. Those of you
who have driven south on Inter
state 5 may have noticed it and
perhaps you have eaten at the
Harris Restaurant, which Ann
Harris ran for several years. So
you can see that she's not just a
dabbler in beef; she's got
credentials.
What is now Harris' used to
be Grisson's, a 50-year-old and
once highly popular San Fran
cisco steak-house which had
recently become a bit run-down.
"You wouldn't recognize the
place now," said Harris since
she raised the ceilings, added
chandeliers, and redid the
kitchen.
The restaurant is made up of
four rooms. The largest is the
dining room with about 20
booths and tables, two huge
brass chandeliers, and large
potted plants in the center. One
side of the room features a huge
mural of the King's River Ranch
painted by Barnaby Conroy.
Jack Harris, complete with cow
boy hat and horses sits amid the
trees and the river.
The bar may be the highlight
of the place. It was built in 1900
and has been moved around the
country before landing at Har
ris'. The dark handcarved wood
bar is opposite an even older
mural which shows scenes of
San Francisco past. Off from the
bar is a small room called the li
brary which features a large
painting of Jack Harris and, you
guessed it, books. Somehow it's
easy to visualize a bunch of cow

hoy types smoking cigars and
playing cards in this room.
I went to Harris' for the
