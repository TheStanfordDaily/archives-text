Walking into The Caran
vansary. one is greeted with a
slight sense of confusion. On
the one hand, the shop seems
to resemble an old country
store: Baskets adorn the
walls and ceiling, and a wide
array of coffees, teas and
sweets is available behind an
old-fashioned counter.
However, this stereotype
is soon shattered by the high,
modern ceilings and sidewalk
cafe atmosphere generated
by the cobbled floor and
tables for two and four care
fully placed in the front of
the shop by large window.
The Caravansary defies

description â€” it is a store in
the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter that should he browsed
through by all. It is a good
restaurant, but also the ideal
place to stock up for elegant
picnic supplies. It offers a
wide array of 45 interna
tional cheeses as well as
pates, deli sandwiches,
drinks, and desserts.
My roommate and I did
not know what to expect
when we arrived, as neither
one of us had heard of The
Caravansary previously. We
browsed around the shop,
trying the free samples of
cheese and jam and noting
the mildly exotic offerings
such as marinated miniature
eggplant.
After a few minutes our
curiosity overcame us and we
decided to order. The restau

rant is cateteria-st\le. with
all ot the entrees on display.
We chose our meal and
found a table in the side
room where we could enjov
the food. The restaurant was
crowded and seemed to have
a large following, although it
does not seem to have been
discovered by Stanford.
My roomie ordered the
Briochkv ($5). consisting ol
Brioch dough filled with
ground sirloin and pine nuts
and heated in a cheese sauce.
All of the entrees come with
a small green salad and a few
slices of French bread, and
are garnished with two or
ange slices. The Briochk\
was fairly simple but very
good; the pine nuts and
cheese sauce combined to
give the dish . l enhancing
spicy flavor.

I ordered the Chicken
Geras ($5.95), a boneless
chicken breast tilled with
raisins, rice and nuts, and
covered by a burgundy
cherry sauce. Like the
Briochky, my portion was
not huge, but quite
manageable. The chicken
was not as sensational as the
Briochky, but was a tasty
new way to prepare a dish
that often ends up being
mediocre.
Two other main dishes
were available, and both
looked as good as those we
chose. The Moussaka ($4)
was a combination of egg
plant and tomato meat
sauce topped with a cheese
custard; the spinach filo pie
($5.75) consisted of layerec
filo dough and spinach witl
feta cheese and greek, olive*
A dozen cold salads an

pastas sold by the pound and
various quiche and sandwich
options completed the main
course choices.
For an appeti/er we chose
the cheese and pate hoard,
which came on a cutting
hoard and was accompanied
by French bread. It was care
lull) arranged and ottered a
nice selection but did not
satisfy our hunger com
plete!). M\ roommate's Cafe
Mocha deserves special
notice as a delicious and
generous portion of brewed
on-the-spot steaming coffee.
We managed to end up
hungry enough to split a slice
ot Kahlua cheesecake for
dessert. Alter one bite it was
easy to tell why there had
been a steady stream of cus
tomers at the dessert counter
throughout our meal: It was
heavenly delicious! All of the

dessert portions are large
and the pecan pie, varieties
of cake, cheesecake and torte
all seem a deal at $2.N5.
Truffles and pecan bars are
available for $1, hut we
couldn't find the room to in
dulge our palate once more.
The Caravansary is open
for both lunch and dinner, al
though it seems to be ideally
suited for a relaxing lunch
escape. The restaurant seems
to bring the outdoors inside,
as a casual open feeling is
generated by the decor and
large areas of window panes.
It you are looking for a nice
place to sit a while and chat
over good moderately priced
food. The Caravansary is a
gem waiting to be discovered
by more students.
