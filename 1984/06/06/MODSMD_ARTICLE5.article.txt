# Record number of students accept admission
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
A record 1630 prospective fresh
men. 65 percent of the roughly 250(1
admitted, have accepted their offers ol
admission to the Class ot 19NN. accor
ding to Dean ol Admissions Fred Har
gadon.
"Some attrition will probably occur
over the summer, but the (incoming)
class will be large." Hargadon said,
adding that the Admissions Office had
planned for a freshman class of 1500.
Hargadon said he admitted about
the same number of students as last
year but the percent ol students ac
cepting th' ,ir offers of admission

jumped by two or three percentage
points.
More students were denied admis
-0 sion this year than ever before, he
it noted, because a record number of ap
. plications (15.614) were received.
- Last year. 14.522 students applied to
Stanford.
"It seems that the tougher it is (to
' gain entrance), the more attractive it
. becomes." he said.
Hargadon, who for many years has
advocated building enough residences
to supply students with lour years of
t housing, is not happy with the current
,t housing shortage or with the prospects
- ot housing an exceptionally large
n freshman class.

He said fewer transfers than usual
would be admitted in the fall to offset
the potential problem of housing all
incoming freshman.
But a spokesman for Residential
Education said the unexpectedly large
class will not cause any housing prob
lems.
"I'm not at all uncomfortable with
the situation." Rodger Whitney said.
Whitney, assistant dean of student af
fairs and director of the Housing Cen
ter. said 1600 spaces were allocated
for freshman prior to this year's
housing Draw.
• We underalloeated by onlv 25
spaces, and that will cause no prob
lem." he said, "l ast yeat about 50

fewer freshman came than we thought
would." he said.
Whitney offered another solution to
the potential but unlikely housing
problem. Spaces created when up
perclassmen drop housing, as a num
ber do each year, could be converted
into freshman housing instead ot going
to upperclassmcn on the waiting list.
In an admissions report released
\esterday. Hargadon noted some ot
the credentials of the applicants to the
Class of 198 N.
•"In terms of grades and test scores
and the rigorousness ot the aeadcmic
programs taken in high school, the ap-
plicant group as a whole shifted up
ward. Approximately 2400 of the ap
plicants were valedictorians of their
respective senior classes.
"While the Class of I 9SS is an ex
ceptionally fine one, it would he diffi
cult to argue that it is superior to the
others which have preceded it. What is
clear is that the quality of those to
whom we unfortunately could not of
fer admission was significantly higher
than any time in memory.

"There is no doubt that the Class of
19N8 is the best "last class' it has been
my good fortune to have admitted to
Stanford." he wrote.
The students in the Class of I MSN
represent every state except Rhode Is
land. Thirty-nine percent hail from
California, the largest state represen
tation. followed by that of New York.
Massachusetts, Texas. Washington,
Oregon and New Jersey. A record
number of secondary schools. 104.5,
are represented in the freshman class.
Eighteen percent of the students
come from black, Chicano or native
American backgrounds, a percentage

fairly consistent with Stanford's
minority enrollment (which does not
include Asian-American.-). Hargadon
said. A total of 66 freshman will be
entering from 35 foreign countries.
Also, the Class of 19NN comprises
57 percent men and 43 percent wo
men.
