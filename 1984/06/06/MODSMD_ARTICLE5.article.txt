### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
A record 1630 prospective fresh
men. 65 percent of the roughly 250(1
admitted, have accepted their offers ol
admission to the Class ot 19NN. accor
ding to Dean ol Admissions Fred Har
gadon.
"Some attrition will probably occur
over the summer, but the (incoming)
class will be large." Hargadon said,
adding that the Admissions Office had
planned for a freshman class of 1500.
Hargadon said he admitted about
the same number of students as last
year but the percent ol students ac
cepting th' ,ir offers of admission

jumped by two or three percentage
points.
More students were denied admis
-0 sion this year than ever before, he
it noted, because a record number of ap
. plications (15.614) were received.
- Last year. 14.522 students applied to
Stanford.
"It seems that the tougher it is (to
' gain entrance), the more attractive it
. becomes." he said.
Hargadon, who for many years has
advocated building enough residences
to supply students with lour years of
t housing, is not happy with the current
,t housing shortage or with the prospects
- ot housing an exceptionally large
n freshman class.

He said fewer transfers than usual
would be admitted in the fall to offset
the potential problem of housing all
incoming freshman.
But a spokesman for Residential
Education said the unexpectedly large
class will not cause any housing prob
lems.
"I'm not at all uncomfortable with
the situation." Rodger Whitney said.
Whitney, assistant dean of student af
fairs and director of the Housing Cen
ter. said 1600 spaces were allocated
for freshman prior to this year's
housing Draw.
• We underalloeated by onlv 25
spaces, and that will cause no prob
lem." he said, "l ast yeat about 50

fewer freshman came than we thought
would." he said.
Whitney offered another solution to
the potential but unlikely housing
problem. Spaces created when up
perclassmen drop housing, as a num
ber do each year, could be converted
into freshman housing instead ot going
to upperclassmcn on the waiting list.
In an admissions report released
\esterday. Hargadon noted some ot
the credentials of the applicants to the
Class of 198 N.
•"In terms of grades and test scores
and the rigorousness ot the aeadcmic
programs taken in high school, the ap-
