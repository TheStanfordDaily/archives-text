lucked away on El Camino just below San
Antonio Road, the Columbus Street Restau
rant and Bar may not seem like the best place
to begin an elegant night on the town.
But appearances can be deceiving. The
smallish, charming restaurant is actually one of
the more stylish and moderately priced places
to eat in the area.

tables combine to give the restaurant a pleas
ant, low-key atmosphere. The nicely dressed
patrons add to the ambiance of elegance.
But the restaurant's inherent elegance does
not imply snobbishness on the part of its
employees. One of our party was hopelessy un
depressed with shorts and a sweatshirt, but
the graceful hosts made no complaints.
The restaurant offers a wide variety of cock
tails and wines. We started our meal with the
house rose, which was very reasonably priced
(51.50 for a glass) and very sweet.
The entrees come either a la carte, or. tor $3
to $4 more, as a complete dinner. The dinners
— large enough to satisfy even the most vora
cious appetites — include minestrone or soup
du jour, fresh green salad, a choice of
beverages and ice cream.
However, I recommend ordering the meal a
la curte and for the same $3.50 you can have
soup, skip the green salad which you can have
anywhere, and go all out on a dessert. You
won't get milk or coffee with your meal, but it
gives you more freedom when ordering. Or
skip the soup and split a pasta for an appetizer.

The Columbus Street menu offers a variety
of entrees from"the air. the land and the sea."
The seafood selections include Scallops Saute
($11.50 for the dinner) and Steamed Cher
rystone Clams Bordelaise ($12.50). Three
types of filet of sole, including Sole a la
Florentine ($11), are also listed.
We ordered the Prawns Saute, which
featured large, succulent prawns on a bed of
rice. The giant shrimp were sauteed in a deli
cious tangy sauce, and garnished with tender
carrots and fresh beans.
The "air" portion of the menu features four
varieties of chicken, including Chicken Cac
ciatore ($11.50) and Chicken Paillard ($10).
Selections "from the land" include Eggplant
Parmigiana ($9.50), New York Steak ($13.00)
and five different types of veal.
We chose the Veal Parmigiana ($l2) — a
large piece of tender veal topped with tasty
cheese. All the dinners come with fresh
vegetables and delicious, traditional San Fran
cisco sourdough bread.
The restaurant also offers a selection of ap
petizers and salads, ranging in price from $1.50
for a mixed green salad to $8.50 for an as
sorted seafood platter.
Pastas also make up a large portion of the
menu. Selections include Gnocchi Piedmon
tese ($5.75), fettuccine with scallops, mush
rooms and cream ($8.50) and tort el 1i n i
($5.75). Many of the items on the menu are
Italian and word is that the pasta is very good.
The desserts include spumoni or Bud's San
Francisco ice cream. But homemade items,
such as Torta Connoli ($2) or Chocolate
Decadence with raspberry puree ($2.25)
sound a lot more memorable.
The service we received was impeccable
throughout the meal. An attentive waitress
hovered nearby, quickly refilling water glasses
and offering condiments.
In fact, perhaps the best aspect of this
charming little eatery is the politeness and con
scientiousness of its employees. Its food is
tastv, and its atmosphere is lovely, but the one
factor that really distinguishes Columbus
Street from the other nice restaurants in the
area is its extraordinary service.
