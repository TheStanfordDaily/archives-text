If you are looking for the per
fect place to take your parents
when they arrive for graduation
or to splurge once before the
end of school, Hugo's Market at
the Hyatt Rickey's on El
Camino is a perfect choice.
Hugo's offers elegant dining
in a pleasantly unpretentious at
mosphere. Although the entrees
are fairly costly, ranging from
$13.95 to $20.95, a magnificent
salad bar, a cool sherbet "to
refresh your palate" between
courses and a sundae bar are all
included with the meal.
We had a great meal, though
it didn't start off too well. To
begin, we indulged in a rare ap
petizer. The creamed morelles
on toast, wild mushrooms in a
wine cream sauce and covered
with mozarella cheese, were
wonderfully flavored but some
how lacking. The piece of toast
was too tough and did not bal
ance the rest of the dish.
Next we sampled an assort
ment of fresh salads at the salad
bar. Along with lettuce and
spinach salad and a variety of
dressings and toppings, there
was also a cheese and ham salad
in a vinagrette dressing,
calamari, mushrooms and ar
tichoke hearts, tomatoes in a

creamy Italian dressing, herring,
shrimp and fresh fruit.
The salad bar and the
freedom to choose as much and
as often as one wished was
definitely one of the high points
of the meal. However, although
the salads were all delicious the
herb bread, which is toasted as
you watch, was not very tasty.
Being two who favor crunchy
bread — if it's going to he toasted
it should be crunchy — we were
disappointed not only in the
flavor but also the texture.
The entrees were superb. In
order to sample Hugo's dex
terity at both fish and meat
dishes, we sampled one of each.
The filet mignon ($19.?0) was
amazing. It was wonderfully
flavored with herb butter and
prepared exactly as ordered —
medium rare. Served with the
rather generous serving of this
very tender meat were fresh
steamed vegtables and a potato,
both of which were equally good.
The vegetables were especially
nice because they were not over
cooked as so often happens.
The more daring of us chose
the prawns and pasta ($18.50).
This dish includes jumbo
prawns, diced tomatoes and
broccoli served on pasta altredo.
When Hugo's menu says jumbo,
it means jumbo. These had to be
the largest prawns we had ever
seen. And the taste was fantas
tic. With the cream sauce and
abundant noodles, the prawns
really did melt in vour mouthy.

Other entrees to choose from
included honey almond duck
ling ($17.50). Indonesian rack
of lamb ($20.95). tarragon
chicken ($13.95). veal
sweetbreads ($18.50). pellale
sole ($16.95). poached salmon
($ 17.50) and more.
To accompany our meal we
decided to sample the house
white wine. Our waitress in
formed us that the Hyatt chain
had recently switched its house
wine from Mondavi wines to J.
l.ohr wines. The wine was
medium dry with a slightly tiuity
taste and just a bit sweeter than
we would have liked. It sold lor
$9 a bottle.
Along with our meal, we were
entitled to indulge in the well
stocked sundae bar where there
is a choice of chocolate or
vanilla soft ice cream that was
actually more like an ice milk.
There were several choices ot
toppings as well. We tasted the
brandy cafe, strawberry and
chocolate sauces which were all
delicious.
The real joys of this meal,
however, were the little extras,
which were pleasant enough,
but not so overbearing as to
make you uncomfortable about
things like picking up the right
fork. Along with coffee we were

served not only the traditional
cream and sugar hut also fresh
whipped cream and chocolate
hits. Even the water served
throughout the meal had a
lemon wheel in it.
People-watching is another
plus here for those so inclined.
Our neighboring diners in
cluded Rep. Ed /.schau and his
family, who we are told frequent
the restaurant. And to accom
pany all this delicious food was a
wonderfully friendly, attentive
and helpful waitress named
Clare.
All in all Hugo's is well worth
the splurge. It is delicious food
that does not require driving all
the way to San Francisco to ob
tain. As well as being local it is
very pleasant and surprisingly
uncrowded dining on off-nights.
However, graduation week may
he another story. And for good
reason.

cooked as so often happens.
The more daring of us chose
the prawns and pasta ($18.50).
This dish includes jumbo
prawns, diced tomatoes and
broccoli served on pasta altredo.
When Hugo's menu says jumbo,
it means jumbo. These had to be
the largest prawns we had ever
seen. And the taste was fantas
tic. With the cream sauce and
abundant noodles, the prawns
really did melt in vour mouthy.

Other entrees to choose from
included honey almond duck
ling ($17.50). Indonesian rack
of lamb ($20.95). tarragon
chicken ($13.95). veal
sweetbreads ($18.50). pellale
sole ($16.95). poached salmon
($ 17.50) and more.
To accompany our meal we
decided to sample the house
white wine. Our waitress in
formed us that the Hyatt chain
had recently switched its house
wine from Mondavi wines to J.
l.ohr wines. The wine was
medium dry with a slightly tiuity
taste and just a bit sweeter than
we would have liked. It sold lor
$9 a bottle.
Along with our meal, we were
entitled to indulge in the well
stocked sundae bar where there
is a choice of chocolate or
vanilla soft ice cream that was
actually more like an ice milk.
There were several choices ot
toppings as well. We tasted the
brandy cafe, strawberry and
chocolate sauces which were all
delicious.
The real joys of this meal,
however, were the little extras,
which were pleasant enough,
but not so overbearing as to
make you uncomfortable about
things like picking up the right
fork. Along with coffee we were

served not only the traditional
cream and sugar hut also fresh
whipped cream and chocolate
hits. Even the water served
throughout the meal had a
lemon wheel in it.
People-watching is another
plus here for those so inclined.
Our neighboring diners in
cluded Rep. Ed /.schau and his
family, who we are told frequent
the restaurant. And to accom
pany all this delicious food was a
wonderfully friendly, attentive
and helpful waitress named
Clare.
All in all Hugo's is well worth
the splurge. It is delicious food
that does not require driving all
the way to San Francisco to ob
tain. As well as being local it is
very pleasant and surprisingly
uncrowded dining on off-nights.
However, graduation week may
he another story. And for good
reason.
