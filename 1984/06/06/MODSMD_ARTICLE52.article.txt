Before I proceed with my
review of Grand China's
cuisine, I'd like to point out that
it takes a lot, a whole lot, to
impress me — reason being that
I live in East house, a residence
which serves Chinese food not
once or twice, but five times a
week, every week of the year.
Granted I don't profess to any
great expertise in the judgment

of Chinese cuisine owing to that
tact, but I teel that it does lend
me a measured amount of
credibility.
Finding the restaurant was
simple enough; it, like half the
restaurants in the area, is lo
cated on El Camino and a bit
beyond San Antonio Road. 1
walked in with three com
panions. Two of us followed the
hostess who led us immediately
to our table, while the other two
wandered into the bar area at

the far side of the restaurant.
Upon joining us at the table, my
other two companions com
mented that the full bar had a
casual atmosphere for before
dinner drinks and socializing.
I he mood of the oriental
decor throughout the entire res
taurant is, in fact, quite casual.
There is definitely no need to
"dress up" for dinner here.
We had just enough time to
browse through the menu,
which has a wide range of ap
petizers, soups, mu-shu, beef,
lamb, pork, sea food, fowl and
vegetable dishes, before our at-

tentive waiter came to take our
order.
Two of my friends chose to
order a complete family dinner
lor two ($7.75 per person). The
dinner consisted of hot and sour
soup, crispy drumsticks and
spring rolls, all acting as ap
petizers, with sweet and sour
shrimp and broccoli with garlic
sauce comprising the main
course.
I, along with another friend,
chose from the a la carte

selections on the menu. We or
dered fried wonton ($1.95) and
potstickers ($2.85) for ap
petizers, and for the main dishes
we selected mu-shu egg
($4.75), snow peas and water
chestnuts ($4.50) and, from the
special recommendation list,
Szechuan beef ($5.50).
I o he sure, we were always
certain to sample a little bit of
food off everyone's various plat
ters. Once the first appetizer
dish was brought, the waiters
maintained a steady pace of
removing and replacing our dif
ferent dishes, so we were never

without the next, newest prepa
ration.
Unfortunately, the potstick
ers and the spring rolls were not
nearly as good as most we've
tasted before. They were not
served quite hot enough, and
were sadly soggy. The fried
wontons were much better.
Brightening our appraisal,
however, was the hot and sour
soup. The soup was excellent. It
was piping hot and had a lot of
flavor. After the soup we were

hungrily looking forward to the
next dish, which happened to be
mu-shu egg.
The following platters held
the sweet and sour shrimp and
the broccoli with garlic sauce.
The broccoli was garlic-tasting
all right, so much so that we
ended up dousing every bite
with a sip of Tsing Tau beer.
The moment I've been
waiting to write about, though,
is here, and it concerns the
sweet and sour shrimp. That
particular dish is one of the best
shrimp dishes I've tasted in my
life. I honestly can't remember
when I've had such tender,
scrumptious shrimp before, and
swathed in my favorite sweet
and sour sauce. The shrimp dish
was undoubtedly the highlight
of the evening.
Subsequently, the next dishes
had quite an act to follow, and
they didn't really follow it well.
It's not that they weren't ade
quately prepared, but that's just
the problem, they were only
that — adequate.
Since we were more than full,
we opted out of the desserts,
though they did sound interest
ing enough. Honeyed Banana
Fritters ($3.25) was one of the
offerings, but it demanded a 30-
minute advance notice, which
we had all neglected to note ear
lier.
All in all, we were satisfied.
Grand China serves good fare,
though it is priced slightly
higher than is optimal on a col
lege budget. However, you can
easily get away for under $10
per person.
The restaurant offers a
stupendous dinner if you know
precisely what to order off the
menu, but if you are simply
walking in to dabble around
with your order, be careful, a
case of the so-so's might find
its way to your taste buds.

ters. Once the first appetizer
dish was brought, the waiters
maintained a steady pace of
removing and replacing our dif
ferent dishes, so we were never

without the next, newest prepa
ration.
Unfortunately, the potstick
ers and the spring rolls were not
nearly as good as most we've
tasted before. They were not
served quite hot enough, and
were sadly soggy. The fried
wontons were much better.
Brightening our appraisal,
however, was the hot and sour
soup. The soup was excellent. It
was piping hot and had a lot of
flavor. After the soup we were

hungrily looking forward to the
next dish, which happened to be
mu-shu egg.
The following platters held
the sweet and sour shrimp and
the broccoli with garlic sauce.
The broccoli was garlic-tasting
all right, so much so that we
ended up dousing every bite
with a sip of Tsing Tau beer.
The moment I've been
waiting to write about, though,
is here, and it concerns the
sweet and sour shrimp. That
particular dish is one of the best
shrimp dishes I've tasted in my
life. I honestly can't remember
when I've had such tender,
scrumptious shrimp before, and
swathed in my favorite sweet
and sour sauce. The shrimp dish
was undoubtedly the highlight
of the evening.
Subsequently, the next dishes
had quite an act to follow, and
they didn't really follow it well.
It's not that they weren't ade
quately prepared, but that's just
the problem, they were only
that — adequate.
Since we were more than full,
we opted out of the desserts,
though they did sound interest
ing enough. Honeyed Banana
Fritters ($3.25) was one of the
offerings, but it demanded a 30-
minute advance notice, which
we had all neglected to note ear
lier.
All in all, we were satisfied.
Grand China serves good fare,
though it is priced slightly
higher than is optimal on a col
lege budget. However, you can
easily get away for under $10
per person.
The restaurant offers a
stupendous dinner if you know
precisely what to order off the
menu, but if you are simply
walking in to dabble around
with your order, be careful, a
case of the so-so's might find
its way to your taste buds.
