It's hard to pinpoint the source, but
somehow when I walked into Le Nor
mandie I felt like I was back in a French
cafe. That's its goal and for some reason it
works.
Maybe it's the blue awning in front, or
the customers sitting outside eating at small
tables, or maybe the smell of the food, but it
happens.
Le Normandie is a perfect place for lunch
because it is served cafeteria-style. You can
make the lunch as simple and quick as you
want, or if you have a bit more time you can
order one of the more elaborate entrees and
a bottle of wine.
However, at least one incentive exists for
going back for dinner. Cheese fondue ($9
which serves two), one of my favorites and
hard to get locally, is available. Dipping
pieces of French bread into a blend of
cheese and wine tastes better than it may
sound and is also a lot of fun.
The food is well displayed behind glass.
As we went through the line, evaluating the
menu overhead and also the food in sight, it
was tough to make a choice. I stuttered, "I
want the uh, uh," vying for more time, and
the owner quickly replied that they didn't
have "uh, uh" so I ordered the shrimp
scampi ($6.25). My companion ordered the
chicken salad sandwich on a croissant
($3.50).
It was the owner who took our order and
dished up the salad. He, with his outgoing
personality, foreign accent and advice on
the food set the friendly mood of the cafe.
The sandwiches and salads are made right
at the counter, but I got a piece of French
bread and a number to take back to the
table. A few minutes later the scampi was

delivered from the kitchen, where the hot
entrees are prepared.
The scampi was served with rice and
vegetables. It came in a butter and garlic
sauce that was delicious and spicy enough to
make the dish interesting. The shrimp were
standard and the serving fairly generous. A
little of the sauce on the rice was great. The
croissant sandwich was fresh and the
chicken salad not typical â€” large fresh
chunks of chicken and pineapple blended in
a lighter than usual sauce.
Next time I go to Le Normandie, I'd like
to sit outside under the canopy, which is es
pecially nice in the summer. But the inside
is equally pleasant. It is decorated primarily
with small, deep-blue tiles and even the
tables are made of the tiles. The effect is
warm and tasteful. A few brass pots hang on
the wall and a small wine and beer bar in
the corner completes the decor.
Le Normandie is also open for breakfast
and offers a typical light French selection.
I'd recommend trying the pain au chocolate
($1.25) if you've never had one. It is a
croissant-type roll with melted chocolate
inside that goes perfectly with cafe au lait.
Croissants, pastries, and Yoplait yogurt (75
cents) are also available.
For lunch and dinner you could get as
gourmet as having escargot ($4.25) and Co
quilles St. Jaques ($6.95), to as simple as a
salami sandwich served on a baguette
($3.50). Coquilles St. Jaques consists of
scallops and mushrooms in a white wine and
cream sauce and is a good bet for an enjoy
able dish.
Red Snapper ($6.50), New York Steak
($6.95) and ham and cheese crepes ($4.95)
are a few of the other selections on the
menu. It is fairly loyal to its French name,
but still offers a wide variety of dishes.
Since I spent spring quarter last year in
Tours, Le Normandie brought back good
memories. If you haven't been to France, so
what, I think you'll like the food.
