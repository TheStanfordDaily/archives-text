### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"Stanford Songs, Centennial Fac
simile Edition"
Stanford Book Store, 40 pp.
Congratulations and thanks to the
Bookstore for reissuing this amusing
collection of favorite school songs
from Stanford's first decades. Alumni
.md students alike will have a natural
interest in this material, but the exam
ples of campus serenades from a per
iod when most private colleges were
single-sex lend a special novelty to
this collection.
There are 18 pieces in the book,
most of them football fight songs, a
few of them drinking songs. My
fa\orites, however, are "My Palo Alto
Pal," and"I Love a Co-ed." The latter
is particularly interesting because it
adds the element of academics to the
romance, and the thoroughly un
reflective sexism of the singer, who
disregards the scholarly successes of
his beloved, depicts some aspects of
campus life that don't seem remarked
on in most other historical materials
about the University.
These two songs and the wittiest
and best of the others in the book
come from Junior Class Operas of the
teens. The stadium songs are standard
fare, though the exclusive attention to
the rivalry with Cal and the difficulty
of giving active character to the mas
cotless Cardinal seem responsible for
there being somewhat less variety than
is found in other schools' fight songs.
The collection is on sale at the
Mi < kstorc. where a video display
makes it possible to hear the songs
performed.

"So Excellent a Fishe"
By Archie Carr
Rev. Ed., Scribners, $15.95, 280
pp.
Scribners has reissued Archie Carr's
classic on the mysteriuous habits and
behavior of sea turtles, with an appen
dix added by the author to bring the
book up to date on new discoveries
and the efforts being made to save the
endangered animals. Carr describes
the astonishing navigational feats of
the turtles engagingly, explaining how
they always return to the same small
strip of beach to mate and lay eggs,
crossing thousands of miles of open
sea from their as yet undiscovered
feeding grounds.
The turtles are endangered by the
disappearance of their nesting beach
es beneath the oily bodies of sun
worshipping tourists and by the
depredations of poachers, who
slaughter the turtles for a few strips of
cartilage-like material called calipee,
the main ingredient in turtle soup.
Carr. a professor at the University
of Florida, has studied the turtles since
1955, but his expertise doesn't get in
the way of his lively account. Filled
with personal anecdotes and written in
an engaging National Geographic
style, this book is an enjoyable survey
of a mysterious and curiously graceful
creature. It's also much more appeal
ing as seaside reading than •'Jaws."

"Megan's Book of Divorce"
As told to Erica Jong
Illustrated by Freya Tan/
New American Library, $10.50,
66pp.
Erica Jong's presentation of a child's
view of divorce has been favorably
received by most reviewers, and I
agree that it is charming, well written
and illustrated, and at least concerns
itself with what is a very serious prob
lem: the effect of parents' divorce on
their children. But 1 have reservations
about the responsibility of Jong's ap
proach to the problem, and the way
her book wraps it up.
"Megan's Book of Divorce" is ap
parently intended for adult readers,
but its format is that of a children's
book: wider than it is tall, illustrations
on every page, brief text, simple story
line. The handicap is the story. As in
many children's books, a lot of the text
goes to creating character and atmo
sphere through small vignettes or
remarks, and the plot itself is reduced
to a one-step resolution of some con
flict that is established through these

"The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft
for Young Writers"
By John Gardner
Knopf, $13.95, 224 pp.
The late John Gardner's remarks on
the hows of fiction writing may please
or dismay, according to what works
for you and what you think works for
others, but his ideas about why certain
principles and techniques should be
used will interest readers already
familiar with his "On Moral Fiction"
and his novels and stories. The sec
tions of specific advice and the exer
cises seem useful and reveal Gardner's
experience teaching creative writing
classes. 1 found the first pait, "Notes
on Literary-Aesthetic Theory," more
interesting not only as abstract discus
sion, but because the principles he
enunciates there make clearer how the
specific advice holds together and is

short views. The problems and solu
tions of most children's hooks are
simple enough to be fairly presented
in this way. but the impact of divorce
upon children is not. Megan explains
some of the charming difficulties of
living with divorced parents (she can
never find matching barettes, her mo
ther's lover is a zero), but the book is
resolved by her discovery that, on her
birthday, she gets double the usual
presents, because each parent's new
lover gives her one too.
Jong may appeal to the "as told to"
of her title and argue that the
presentation of the book conforms to
what a child would say. True enough;
children are not often terribly
forthcoming about anxieties they can't
understand or articulate. But that is
hardly a reason to tell the story in a
way implying that a child's under
standing of it is adequate. Though
hints at Megan's worries are apparent
in the story — she plays marriage and
divorce with her friend Jeremy — a
book for adults may justly be expected
to deal with them more responsibly
than this one has.

motivated.
Based on my experience in writing
classes at other universities, I found
Gardner's most telling observations to
be that one does not have to write out
of one's own experience, but that most
good writers follow the forms and con
tent of the genre they know best. Tied
to this is his argument that one need
only have a few good "informants" to
come up with enough material for
several stories.
Gardner's attitude is conservative,
and he is unindulgent towards ex
perimenters in metafiction. Yet his ad
vice for beginning writers is well
suited to their capabilities and needs. 1
don't know how successfully one could
use this book in lieu of a workshop,
but perhaps it might be better than a
class with a teacher less committed to
his craft and his students than Gardner
obviously is.

"The World According to Beaver"
By Irwvn Applebaum
Bantam, $7.95, 324 pp.
Some of you who saw Hitchcock's
The Trouble with Harry at the
Aquarius last month may have
recognized the little boy in the film,
without being able to place him. This
manual of "Leave it to Beaver" lore
contains the answer: It's Jerry Math
ers, whose part in Hitchcock's 1956
film about a corpse that won't stay
buried is a pale foreshadowing of the
godlike status that has devolved upon
him in the spirit world of TV reruns.
It sounded ridiculous to me, too. but
Irwyn Applebaum's book devoted to
the Beaver series turns out to be a
respectable attempt to explain and
display some of the reasons why the
show really was an outstanding prod
uct of durable value. Applebaum puts
his finger on the thing that differenti
ates "Leave it to Beaver" from the

other shows about families with young
children: It took the kid's experience
of the world seriously and depicted it
with sympathy.
It wasn't just that the content of the
shows was something everyone (that
is, everyone who was once a child)
could remember with sentimental
pleasure; the structure of the show
was distinct from that of the situation
comedies that dominate television.
One of the producers told an inter
viewer, "It's not a 'situation' comedy
where you have to create a situation
for a particular effect. Our emphasis is
on a natural story line." Applebaum
has made a complete set of plot sum
maries for all the 234 episodes, and
they are excellent examples of just this
sort of plotting, which allows a resolu
tion that gives greater emphasis to the
viewers' feelings about the characters
as people.
The book not only includes plot
summaries, but also collects quota
tions from the various characters on
any number of subjects. Beaver is
cited remarking about Penny Woods,
"If her face was on television parents
wouldn't let little kids watch it." The
multitude of similar quotations makes
it clear why so many little kids and
adults still watch the show's reruns.

"Fires: Essays, Poems, Stories"
By Raymond Carver
Vintage, $3.95, 220 pp.
Raymond Carver's last collection of
stories. "Cathedral." received the
kind of praise that has continued long
enough to establish him securely
among the best short story writers
working in America. Vintage has now
issued in paperback a collection of
seven of his stories, some essays and a
number of poems from collections
now out of print. The book affords the
opportunity to attempt a reevaluation
of his work, but one finds that there's
little to add to the accolades that have
been handed down already.
This continuing progress of publica
tion — appearance in a magazine, col
lection, then republication in an an
thology — lends itself to Carver's
penchant for revision, and almost all
ot the material here has been changed.
Carver thinks for the better in all
cases; I'm not so sure, but the level of
quality itself remains the same.
