# Comic book Shakespeares: both ends of spectrum
## Pollock's illustrated 'Lear' sketches new interpretation 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"Romeo and Juliet,"
William Shakespeare
Illustrated by Von
Knopf, $8.95, 122 pp.

by "King Lear," by William
Shakespeare
Illustrated by lan Pollock
Workman, $8.95, 140 pp.

The strangest thing about Knopf s comic book edition of "Romeo
and Juliet" is that, at the time they issued it this past winter, they
must have known that Workman Publishing was soon to offer its
version of"Lear." "What's so odd?" you ask, "Competition is nor
mal in the book business, too." Very true, but a house as good as
Knopf rarely tries to compete against a book like "Lear" with an ef
fort as pathetic as " Romeo and Juliet."
Workman began the newest series of comic book Shakespeares in
1982, when it commissioned Von, the artist who illustrated Knopf s
"R&J," to illustrate "Macbeth." 1 haven't seen that book, but the
work Von does in "R&J" makes me wonder that the reception
of "Macbeth" didn't crush the project of a series of illustrated
Shakespeare texts from the very start. Workman's artist for "Lear"
is lan Pollock, and the skill and expressiveness of his graphics
validate the whole effort, producing a text that is not merely ac
companied by pictures, but interpreted by them.
The idea of adapting Shakespeare to comic book form is not new.
Marvel comics tried something like it in the old Marvel Classics se
ries. The difference was that those versions did not reproduce the
original text, but altered and abridged it considerably, relying on the
pictures to tell much of the story and achieving a good fit between
images and text.
The problem with both Von's"R&J" and Pollock's "Lear" is that
they preserve the entire text, and have to adapt their pictures to it.
Apparently, the publishers of both books feel that they must really
offer Shakespeare to their readers, adding the pictures for some fur
ther benefit. But the only gain that can be alleged is that young or
reluctant readers will find the comic book format more appealing,
making the Bard's bitter pill go down more sweetly. What anyone
arguing this way fails to realize is that the hardest thing for inexperi
enced readers to deal with is the text itself, and, without notes and
glosses, no sugar coating can make Shakespeare palatable or digest
ible.
If this intent fails, Von's ill-drawn, unintelligent pictures have no
purpose and no excuse. Pollock's book, on the other hand, may not
be appropriate for those unfamiliar with Shakespeare, but presents
as interesting an interpretation of the play as many stage produc
tions do. Pollock's expressive, vigorous images manipulate charac
ters' shapes, sizes and colors, and show a remarkable variety of bod
ily and facial expressions for comic book figures. His deep engage
ment with the play is clear on every page, and he has produced an il
lustrated version that shows not merely that comic book versions of
Shakespeare are possible, but that they extend the media in which a
novel and sensitive presentation of Shakespeare can appear.
