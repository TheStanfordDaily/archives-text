### LYDIA ALIX FILLINGHAM 
"Domestick Beings"
June Sprigg, ed.
Knopf, $17.95, 143 pp.
I originally had no intention of reviewing
this book. I am a busy scholar type, infinitely
burdened with erudite reading, and this
pretty little book seemed a hit too trivial for
my notice. However, on opening the cover I
discovered a personal connection to the
work, and I suppose we are all suckers for
coincidence.
"Domestick Beings" is a collection of
snippets from the diaries of seven 18th
century women — diaries being rather
loosely defined so as to include letters.
Among the seven is one Jemima Condict,
who was not only from my home town (West
Orange, N.J.) but also an ancestor of the wo
man from whom my family bought our
house. 1 remember early childhood visits,
doll Lucy in tow, to ancient Mrs. Conditt,

and of course my heart immediately went
out to Jemima of long ago. She seems to be
an independent young woman, writing in the
years just before the Revolution. She talks,
for instance, of refusing a marriage offer.
When the young man asks why, she reports,
"Because says I you will find that I am a
crose ill contrived Pese of Stuff told him
that 1 would advise all men to remain as they
was for woman was Bad & the men so much
worse that It was a wonder if they agreed. So
I scared the poor fellow and he is gone."
Jemima is a farmer's daughter, none too
educated nor wealthy. She is joined in this
book by: Nancy Green Winslow. a well-to
do Boston school girl; Abby May, an ed
ucated young invalid, staying at a New York
mineral spring spa; Aunt Bek Dickison, a
lonely spinster and seamstress in western
Massachusetts; Martha Ballard, a midwife
who delivered 996 babies; Molly Cooper, a
miserable Long Island farmer's wife; and

Abigail Adams, the famous one, wife and
mother to presidents.
These are interesting people, and the
result is pleasant, if hardly profound. The se
lections have been divided into seven sec
tions: Marriage and motherhood,
housework, food, clothing, leisure, health
and education. Each section begins with
commentary by Sprigg on the general atti
tudes on the subject displayed by the
diarists. Short quotations follow, inter
spersed with charming illustrations of
household artifacts.
One does get from this book a sense of the
daily rhythms of women's lives around the
time of the Revolution, and very tough, lim
ited lives they were. But one does not get
any analysis of the pressures that led these
women to seek expression in what was, for
most of them, a most unusual way. There are
hints, but they remain largely unexplored.
Jemima Condict seems to have been

tortured by a love for her cousin Aaron at a
time when marriage to a first cousin was
coming to be considered incest. Molly
Cooper was embittered by many years of
burdensome, loveless marriage and seems to
have sought release not only in her diary, but
in joining the New Light Baptist Church,
against her husband's wishes. There is al
most no comment on the political events of
the day, but there is no way of knowing whe
ther this omission is due to the interest of the
diarists or the selector. Certainly Abigail
Adams could hardly keep politics out of her
correspondence with her husband, but the
others might have felt it a subject that did
not concern them. It would be nice to know,
one way or the other.
Any deep analysis, however, is beyond the
ken of this work. Reading it as I did, straight
through, is not the reading it deserves. It is
meant to be dipped into from time to time; it
is a patchwork quilt, made up of any number

of pleasurable and arresting scraps, and 1
will close with a couple of these.
• "I was called in great haste to see Mrs.
Hamlen who was in a fitt . . . Applyed
vinagar to her lips, temples, and hands, and
onions to her feet, and shee revived." —
Martha Ballard
• to He out of fashion, is more crimi
nal than to be seen in a state of Nature to
which the parisians are not averse." —
Abigail Adams in France.
• "This day is forty years sine I left my fa
ther's house and come here, and here have I
seene littel els but harde labour and sorrow,
crosses of every kind. 1 think in every respect
the state of my affairs is more than forty
times worse than when I came here first, ex
cept that I am nearer the disierered haven."
— Molly Cooper
