## Come back to the revival houses, good movies, good movies 
### SIEVE VINEBERG 
The 1 l >K()s are not a great de
cade for movie revival houses.
Despite all the attention given
to film scholarship and
reconstruction, the eagerness of
young audiences in the late 'Ms
and early 70s to see unusual
films, foreign pictures, the
lesser- known work of famous
directors or the often
praiseworthy but commercially
unsuccessful work of less fa
mous directors, has passed to a
complacency about watching
movies or a lack of imagination

on the part of those who put to
gether film series (or both).
The New Varsity oecasionally
shows good movies that have
not surfaced for years (like
Sunday, Bloody Sunday or
Claire's Knee earlier this year),
hut poor attendance wears
down their efforts to vary their
programming. The Bijou, which
reopened as a revival theater in
December with a loudly trum
peted commitment to show the
kind of movies that too seldom
appear in moviehouses these
days, has lately been reduced to
advertising double bills of On
Golden Pond and Terms of En

dearment. (The Bijou's new
management must hold the local
record for quickest sellout.)
Even the once reliable Festival
Cinema, which could be
counted on at least to restrict
their schedule to older Holly
wood and British movies, has
included On Golden Pond in its
latest schedule, excusing its
crassness with a pitifully disin
genuous note about the "history
making" pairing of two great
stars. Can the term "cinematic
history" truly be applied to
any movie that shows up as reg-

ularly as the 1981 Oscar-laden
On Golden Pond?
Despite the preponderance of
film societies on the Stanford
campus, where the same com
mercial considerations should
not dictate policy, courageous
programming is almost un
known outside of the occasional
festivals sponsored by the
Japanese and German Studies
Departments or the highly
esoteric offerings of that bizarre
organization that calls itself the
Great Directors Film Series and
operates out of STARTS.
(Their films don't even attempt
to represent the work of great

directors, and they include per
verse — sometimes lunatic —
choices, but at least they aren't
conventional.)
However, having been, as an
undergraduate, fortunate
enough to attend a university
with a remarkable film society
(we had only one), I persist in
believing that the way to build
up a serious film audience on
campus is to provide a consis
tently intelligent, provocative
and entertaining alternative to
the Sunday Flicks' endless recy
cling of last season's box office

hits and the monthly screenings
in other corners of The Philadel
phia Story and Citizen Kane. (1
love these two movies as much
as the next guy, but Hollywood
did turn out more than two good
pictures in the '30s and '405.)
Permit me, therefore, to offer a
list of 15 movies — none shown
within 45 miles of this university
in at least the four years I have
been writing about movies for
The Daily — that barely begins
to suggest the untapped
treasures furnished by the last
six decades of filmmaking.
Easy Living (1937): Preston
Sturges wrote the script for this
screwball comedy before he'd
made his debut as a director,
"tmd-'PfrrawmH-nt 1 -hnnde-ebH —
Mitchell Leisen, who gave it an
elegant veneer Sturges himself
might have scorned. Jean Ar
thur plays a working class wo
man who becomes involved with
an eccentric rich family ("rich"
and "eccentric" were always
synonyms in Depression
comedies) when one of them
drops a mink coat on her head
from his penthouse balcony as
she passes on an open-air bus.
Forbidden Games (1951):
Rene Clement's indelible
tragedy about the effects of war
on children — surely the
greatest film to come out of
France between the Occupation
and the late-'sos aesthetic take
over of the New Wave directors.
Clement's fable is comparable
to Renoir's "Grand Illusion" in
its power and trenchancy.
(Neither contains any actual
battle scenes.)
It's Always Fair Weather
(1955): During the golden age
of musicals at M-G-M — the
heyday of the Arthur Freed

unit, in the late '40s and early
'50s — Stanley Donen and
Gene Kelly made this unex
peetedly cynical entertainment,
from a sharp satirical script by
Betty Comden and Adolph
Green. Kelly, Dan Dailey (in
easily his best performance) and
choreographer Michael Kidd
play army buddies who reunite
10 years after the war and find
they can't stand each other any
more. When M-G-M adapted
Comden and Green's stage
show On the Town six years ear
lier, the material had been
sweetened and truncated; in It's
Always Fair Weather the writers
managed to reintroduce some of
the melancholic low notes that
the sunnier On the Town had
missed.
Laughter in Paradise (1951):
One of the funniest of the
British comedies of the '50s. A
practical joker dies, leaving his
estate to four distant relatives —
each of whom must perform
some action incompatible with
his own principles or habits in
order to earn the promised por
tion. In the most memorable
episode, Alastair Sim, as a timid
mystery writer, tries to get him
self arrested.
The Letter (1940): William
Wyler's superbly crafted film of
the Somerset Maugham story
features Bette Davis in one of
her greatest performances, as
the chillingly assured planter's
wife in colonial Singapore who
(in the opening sequence)
shoots her lover.
The Member of the Wedding
(1952): Carson McCullers
adapted her own novel — one of
the most sensitively and del
icately idiosyncratic portraits of
adolescence published in this
country — to the stage in 1950,
where Julie Harris and Ethel
Waters gave legendary perfor
mances as the' 12-year-old
Frankie Addams and her com
panion, the middle-aged black

housekeeper Berenice Sadie
Brown. Fred Zinnemann's film
preserves those performances
and McCullers' text: It's as es
sential a document of the Amer
ican theatrical heritage (and as
much a tribute to American
naturalistic acting) as the movie
of A Streetcar Named Desire,
released the previous year.
Seven Chances (1925): Buster
Keaton based this film on a

David Belasco stage success;
though virtually unknown, it's a
perfect comedy. Keaton plays a
young man who stands to inherit
a fortune if he can find a bride
before the end of the day.
Shame (1968): Ingmar
Bergman's war film — so obvi
ously a masterpiece (and cer
tainly heralded as one by critics
on its release) that its disap
pearance from revival houses is
a true mystery, especially con
sidering the quality of Liv LJI-
Imann's performance. The war
in this picture is übiquitous, un
explained, seemingly without
politics — and harrowing. (The
final image is as shattering as
any moment in a Bergman
picture.)
Shoeshine (1946): Vittorio
De Sica made this impassioned,
lyrical story of two boys, close
friends, who are crushed be
tween the forces of crime and

law. Heartbreaking — one of
the great neo-realist films (like
The Bicvle Thief and Umherto
D) De Sica made in Italy in
post-World War II Italy.
The Shop Around the Corner
(1940): In Ernst Lubitseh's ex
quisite romantic comedy, James
Stewart and Margaret Sullavan
give classic performances as co
workers in a shop — adversaries

who end up as lovers. This ma
terial, out of a Hungarian play,
has been done several times in
this country (Judy Garland and
Van Johnson starred in a cut
rate version. In the Good Old
Summertime, in 1948, and there
is a delightful stage musical
based on it. She Loves Me), but
this is the supreme rendering.
The Story of Adele H (1975):
In the '70s, Francois Truiffaut
received commendation for a
number of sweet but decidedly
unambitious comedies with safe
commercial appeal (like Day for
in 1973). But this brilliant
rhapsody on romantic love —
intensely passionate yet satirical
— went almost unnoticed. The
20-year-old Isabelle Adjani
gives a spellbinding perfor
mance as Adele, the daughter of
Victor Hugo, who chases a sol
dier she adores — and who has
no interest in her — halfway
across the world.

The Sugarland Express
(1974): Considering Steven
Spielberg's box office record,
you'd think someone would be
clever enough to revive this
film, his first theatrical feature
— and one of the most dazzling
debuts a director has ever made
in this country. Goldie Hawn is
wonderfully unaffected as a wo
man whose baby is taken away
from her while she and her hus

hand (William Atherton) are
serving jail sentences; she
springs him from pre-release
helps him kidnap the child and
drives across the western United
States with the police on her tail
and the emotional support of
the people in every town she
passes through.
Thieves Like L's (1974): This
may be Robert Altman's best
film, with the possible excep
tions of Nashville and McCabe
and Mrs. Miller. Adapting a
fine, muted Edward Anderson
novel from the '30s about
doomed lovers, he explores the
effects of pop culture on people
who live on the edge of poverty
and or. the edge of the law.
Keith Carradine, Shelley
Duvall, Louise Fletcher (in her
first movie), Bert Remsen and
especially John Schuck —
whose television acting gives no
hint of his capabilities — give
marvelous performances; and
the cinematography, by Jean
Boffety, is peerless.
I Vitelloni (1953): Whenever
1 complain about the latest Fel
lini extravaganza, someone
writes an angry letter claiming 1
don't understand the genius of
this Italian director. But when
you see a film like I Vitelloni.
about the camaraderie of bored,
spoiled young Roman men, you
appreciate w hat has been lost in
the last two decades of Fellini's
career. This is the movie Barry
Levinson must have been think
ing of when he made Diner.
The Wind (1928): Lillian
Gish in one of her most as
tonishing performances, as a
woman made neurotic by the
cruel, unhappy life she leads in a
physical and emotional wilder
ness. During the televised
American Film Institute's trib
ute to Gish. the best scene —
her attempts to burv the man
who has raped her during a
sandstorm, and her subsequent
psychological disintegration —
was show n to many viewers who
could have had no idea how ex
traordinary an actress Gish has
always been, since her finest
performances rarely show up at
revival houses. Beautifully di
rected by the Swedish emigre
filmmaker Victor Seastrom,
who had also been at the helm
when she played Hester Prynne
in The Scarlet Letter two years
before.


"Seven Chances": Buster Keaton makes a rushed proposal to his love


"The Wind": Lillian Gish at her most beguiling.


"It's Always Fair Weather": Drunk and deliriously happy at returning home, soldiers Mi
chael Kidd, Gene Kelly and Dan Dailey dance on a New York street with garbage-can lids on
their feet.


"The Letter": Bette Davis as lying murderess Leslie Crosbie faces a moment of awful truth
with her husband (Herbert Marshall).

Van Johnson starred in a cut
rate version. In the Good Old
Summertime, in 1948, and there
is a delightful stage musical
based on it. She Loves Me), but
this is the supreme rendering.
The Story of Adele H (1975):
In the '70s, Francois Truiffaut
received commendation for a
number of sweet but decidedly
unambitious comedies with safe
commercial appeal (like Day for
in 1973). But this brilliant
rhapsody on romantic love —
intensely passionate yet satirical
— went almost unnoticed. The
20-year-old Isabelle Adjani
gives a spellbinding perfor
mance as Adele, the daughter of
Victor Hugo, who chases a sol
dier she adores — and who has
no interest in her — halfway
across the world.

The Sugarland Express
(1974): Considering Steven
Spielberg's box office record,
you'd think someone would be
clever enough to revive this
film, his first theatrical feature
— and one of the most dazzling
debuts a director has ever made
in this country. Goldie Hawn is
wonderfully unaffected as a wo
man whose baby is taken away
from her while she and her hus

hand (William Atherton) are
serving jail sentences; she
springs him from pre-release
helps him kidnap the child and
drives across the western United
States with the police on her tail
and the emotional support of
the people in every town she
passes through.
Thieves Like L's (1974): This
may be Robert Altman's best
film, with the possible excep
tions of Nashville and McCabe
and Mrs. Miller. Adapting a
fine, muted Edward Anderson
novel from the '30s about
doomed lovers, he explores the
effects of pop culture on people
who live on the edge of poverty
and or. the edge of the law.
Keith Carradine, Shelley
Duvall, Louise Fletcher (in her
first movie), Bert Remsen and
especially John Schuck —
whose television acting gives no
hint of his capabilities — give
marvelous performances; and
the cinematography, by Jean
Boffety, is peerless.
I Vitelloni (1953): Whenever

lini extravaganza, someone
writes an angry letter claiming 1

this Italian director. But when
you see a film like I Vitelloni.
about the camaraderie of bored,
spoiled young Roman men, you
appreciate w hat has been lost in
the last two decades of Fellini's
career. This is the movie Barry
Levinson must have been think
ing of when he made Diner.
The Wind (1928): Lillian
Gish in one of her most as
tonishing performances, as a
woman made neurotic by the
cruel, unhappy life she leads in a
physical and emotional wilder
ness. During the televised
American Film Institute's trib
ute to Gish. the best scene —
her attempts to burv the man
who has raped her during a
sandstorm, and her subsequent
psychological disintegration —
was show n to many viewers who
could have had no idea how ex
traordinary an actress Gish has
always been, since her finest
performances rarely show up at
revival houses. Beautifully di
rected by the Swedish emigre
filmmaker Victor Seastrom,
who had also been at the helm
when she played Hester Prynne
in The Scarlet Letter two years
before.


"Seven Chances": Buster Keaton makes a rushed proposal to his love


"The Wind": Lillian Gish at her most beguiling.


"It's Always Fair Weather": Drunk and deliriously happy at returning home, soldiers Mi
chael Kidd, Gene Kelly and Dan Dailey dance on a New York street with garbage-can lids on
their feet.


"The Letter": Bette Davis as lying murderess Leslie Crosbie faces a moment of awful truth
with her husband (Herbert Marshall).
The 1 l >K()s are not a great de
cade for movie revival houses.
Despite all the attention given
to film scholarship and
reconstruction, the eagerness of
young audiences in the late 'Ms
and early 70s to see unusual
films, foreign pictures, the
lesser- known work of famous
directors or the often
praiseworthy but commercially
unsuccessful work of less fa
mous directors, has passed to a
complacency about watching
movies or a lack of imagination

on the part of those who put to
gether film series (or both).
The New Varsity oecasionally
shows good movies that have
not surfaced for years (like
Sunday, Bloody Sunday or
Claire's Knee earlier this year),
hut poor attendance wears
down their efforts to vary their
programming. The Bijou, which
reopened as a revival theater in
December with a loudly trum
peted commitment to show the
kind of movies that too seldom
appear in moviehouses these
days, has lately been reduced to
advertising double bills of On
Golden Pond and Terms of En

dearment. (The Bijou's new
management must hold the local
record for quickest sellout.)
Even the once reliable Festival
Cinema, which could be
counted on at least to restrict
their schedule to older Holly
wood and British movies, has
included On Golden Pond in its
latest schedule, excusing its
crassness with a pitifully disin
genuous note about the "history
making" pairing of two great
stars. Can the term "cinematic
history" truly be applied to
any movie that shows up as reg-

ularly as the 1981 Oscar-laden
On Golden Pond?
Despite the preponderance of
film societies on the Stanford
campus, where the same com
mercial considerations should
not dictate policy, courageous
programming is almost un

and entertaining alternative to
the Sunday Flicks' endless recy
cling of last season's box office

Easy Living (1937): Preston
Sturges wrote the script for this
screwball comedy before he'd
made his debut as a director,
"tmd-'PfrrawmH-nt 1 -hnnde-ebH —
Mitchell Leisen, who gave it an
elegant veneer Sturges himself
might have scorned. Jean Ar
thur plays a working class wo
man who becomes involved with
an eccentric rich family ("rich"
and "eccentric" were always
synonyms in Depression
comedies) when one of them
drops a mink coat on her head
from his penthouse balcony as
she passes on an open-air bus.
Forbidden Games (1951):
Rene Clement's indelible
tragedy about the effects of war
on children — surely the
greatest film to come out of
France between the Occupation
and the late-'sos aesthetic take
over of the New Wave directors.
Clement's fable is comparable
to Renoir's "Grand Illusion" in
its power and trenchancy.
(Neither contains any actual
battle scenes.)
It's Always Fair Weather
(1955): During the golden age
of musicals at M-G-M — the
heyday of the Arthur Freed

unit, in the late '40s and early
'50s — Stanley Donen and
Gene Kelly made this unex
peetedly cynical entertainment,
from a sharp satirical script by
Betty Comden and Adolph
Green. Kelly, Dan Dailey (in
easily his best performance) and
choreographer Michael Kidd
play army buddies who reunite
10 years after the war and find
they can't stand each other any
more. When M-G-M adapted
Comden and Green's stage
show On the Town six years ear
lier, the material had been
sweetened and truncated; in It's
Always Fair Weather the writers
managed to reintroduce some of
the melancholic low notes that
the sunnier On the Town had
missed.
Laughter in Paradise (1951):
One of the funniest of the
British comedies of the '50s. A
practical joker dies, leaving his
estate to four distant relatives —
each of whom must perform
some action incompatible with
his own principles or habits in
order to earn the promised por
tion. In the most memorable
episode, Alastair Sim, as a timid
mystery writer, tries to get him
self arrested.
The Letter (1940): William
Wyler's superbly crafted film of
the Somerset Maugham story
features Bette Davis in one of
her greatest performances, as
the chillingly assured planter's
wife in colonial Singapore who
(in the opening sequence)
shoots her lover.
The Member of the Wedding
(1952): Carson McCullers
adapted her own novel — one of
the most sensitively and del
icately idiosyncratic portraits of
adolescence published in this
country — to the stage in 1950,
where Julie Harris and Ethel
Waters gave legendary perfor
mances as the' 12-year-old
Frankie Addams and her com
panion, the middle-aged black

housekeeper Berenice Sadie
Brown. Fred Zinnemann's film
preserves those performances
and McCullers' text: It's as es
sential a document of the Amer
ican theatrical heritage (and as
much a tribute to American
naturalistic acting) as the movie
of A Streetcar Named Desire,
released the previous year.
Seven Chances (1925): Buster
Keaton based this film on a

David Belasco stage success;
though virtually unknown, it's a
perfect comedy. Keaton plays a
young man who stands to inherit
a fortune if he can find a bride
before the end of the day.
Shame (1968): Ingmar
Bergman's war film — so obvi
ously a masterpiece (and cer
tainly heralded as one by critics
on its release) that its disap
pearance from revival houses is
a true mystery, especially con
sidering the quality of Liv LJI-
Imann's performance. The war
in this picture is übiquitous, un
explained, seemingly without
politics — and harrowing. (The
final image is as shattering as
any moment in a Bergman
picture.)
Shoeshine (1946): Vittorio
De Sica made this impassioned,
lyrical story of two boys, close
friends, who are crushed be
tween the forces of crime and

law. Heartbreaking — one of
the great neo-realist films (like
The Bicvle Thief and Umherto
D) De Sica made in Italy in
post-World War II Italy.
The Shop Around the Corner
(1940): In Ernst Lubitseh's ex
quisite romantic comedy, James
Stewart and Margaret Sullavan
give classic performances as co
workers in a shop — adversaries

who end up as lovers. This ma
terial, out of a Hungarian play,
has been done several times in
this country (Judy Garland and
Van Johnson starred in a cut
rate version. In the Good Old
Summertime, in 1948, and there
is a delightful stage musical
based on it. She Loves Me), but
this is the supreme rendering.

of musicals at M-G-M — the
heyday of the Arthur Freed

unit, in the late '40s and early
'50s — Stanley Donen and
Gene Kelly made this unex
peetedly cynical entertainment,
from a sharp satirical script by
Betty Comden and Adolph
Green. Kelly, Dan Dailey (in
easily his best performance) and
choreographer Michael Kidd
play army buddies who reunite
10 years after the war and find
they can't stand each other any
more. When M-G-M adapted
Comden and Green's stage
show On the Town six years ear
lier, the material had been
sweetened and truncated; in It's
Always Fair Weather the writers
managed to reintroduce some of
the melancholic low notes that
the sunnier On the Town had
missed.
Laughter in Paradise (1951):
One of the funniest of the
British comedies of the '50s. A
practical joker dies, leaving his
estate to four distant relatives —
each of whom must perform
some action incompatible with
his own principles or habits in
order to earn the promised por
tion. In the most memorable
episode, Alastair Sim, as a timid
mystery writer, tries to get him
self arrested.
The Letter (1940): William
Wyler's superbly crafted film of
the Somerset Maugham story
features Bette Davis in one of
her greatest performances, as
the chillingly assured planter's
wife in colonial Singapore who
(in the opening sequence)
shoots her lover.
The Member of the Wedding
(1952): Carson McCullers
adapted her own novel — one of
the most sensitively and del
icately idiosyncratic portraits of
adolescence published in this
country — to the stage in 1950,
where Julie Harris and Ethel
Waters gave legendary perfor
mances as the' 12-year-old
Frankie Addams and her com
panion, the middle-aged black

housekeeper Berenice Sadie
Brown. Fred Zinnemann's film
preserves those performances
and McCullers' text: It's as es
sential a document of the Amer
ican theatrical heritage (and as
much a tribute to American
naturalistic acting) as the movie
of A Streetcar Named Desire,
released the previous year.
Seven Chances (1925): Buster
Keaton based this film on a

David Belasco stage success;
though virtually unknown, it's a
perfect comedy. Keaton plays a
young man who stands to inherit
a fortune if he can find a bride
before the end of the day.
Shame (1968): Ingmar
Bergman's war film — so obvi
ously a masterpiece (and cer
tainly heralded as one by critics
on its release) that its disap
pearance from revival houses is
a true mystery, especially con
sidering the quality of Liv LJI-
Imann's performance. The war
in this picture is übiquitous, un
explained, seemingly without
politics — and harrowing. (The
final image is as shattering as
any moment in a Bergman
picture.)
Shoeshine (1946): Vittorio
De Sica made this impassioned,
lyrical story of two boys, close
friends, who are crushed be
tween the forces of crime and

law. Heartbreaking — one of
the great neo-realist films (like
The Bicvle Thief and Umherto
D) De Sica made in Italy in
post-World War II Italy.
The Shop Around the Corner
(1940): In Ernst Lubitseh's ex
quisite romantic comedy, James
Stewart and Margaret Sullavan
give classic performances as co
workers in a shop — adversaries

who end up as lovers. This ma
terial, out of a Hungarian play,
has been done several times in
this country (Judy Garland and
Van Johnson starred in a cut
rate version. In the Good Old
Summertime, in 1948, and there
is a delightful stage musical
based on it. She Loves Me), but
this is the supreme rendering.
The Story of Adele H (1975):
In the '70s, Francois Truiffaut
received commendation for a
number of sweet but decidedly
unambitious comedies with safe
commercial appeal (like Day for
in 1973). But this brilliant
rhapsody on romantic love —
intensely passionate yet satirical
— went almost unnoticed. The
20-year-old Isabelle Adjani
gives a spellbinding perfor
mance as Adele, the daughter of
Victor Hugo, who chases a sol
dier she adores — and who has
no interest in her — halfway
across the world.

The Sugarland Express
(1974): Considering Steven
Spielberg's box office record,
you'd think someone would be
clever enough to revive this
film, his first theatrical feature
— and one of the most dazzling
debuts a director has ever made
in this country. Goldie Hawn is
wonderfully unaffected as a wo
man whose baby is taken away
from her while she and her hus

hand (William Atherton) are
serving jail sentences; she
springs him from pre-release
helps him kidnap the child and
drives across the western United
States with the police on her tail
and the emotional support of
the people in every town she
passes through.
Thieves Like L's (1974): This
may be Robert Altman's best
film, with the possible excep
tions of Nashville and McCabe
and Mrs. Miller. Adapting a
fine, muted Edward Anderson
novel from the '30s about
doomed lovers, he explores the
effects of pop culture on people
who live on the edge of poverty
and or. the edge of the law.
Keith Carradine, Shelley
Duvall, Louise Fletcher (in her
first movie), Bert Remsen and
especially John Schuck —
whose television acting gives no
hint of his capabilities — give
marvelous performances; and
the cinematography, by Jean
Boffety, is peerless.
I Vitelloni (1953): Whenever
1 complain about the latest Fel
lini extravaganza, someone
writes an angry letter claiming 1
don't understand the genius of
this Italian director. But when
you see a film like I Vitelloni.
about the camaraderie of bored,
spoiled young Roman men, you
appreciate w hat has been lost in
the last two decades of Fellini's
career. This is the movie Barry
Levinson must have been think
ing of when he made Diner.
The Wind (1928): Lillian
Gish in one of her most as
tonishing performances, as a
woman made neurotic by the
cruel, unhappy life she leads in a
physical and emotional wilder
ness. During the televised
American Film Institute's trib
ute to Gish. the best scene —
her attempts to burv the man
who has raped her during a
sandstorm, and her subsequent
psychological disintegration —
was show n to many viewers who
could have had no idea how ex
traordinary an actress Gish has
always been, since her finest
performances rarely show up at
revival houses. Beautifully di
rected by the Swedish emigre
filmmaker Victor Seastrom,
who had also been at the helm
when she played Hester Prynne
in The Scarlet Letter two years
before.


"Seven Chances": Buster Keaton makes a rushed proposal to his love


"The Wind": Lillian Gish at her most beguiling.


"It's Always Fair Weather": Drunk and deliriously happy at returning home, soldiers Mi
chael Kidd, Gene Kelly and Dan Dailey dance on a New York street with garbage-can lids on
their feet.


"The Letter": Bette Davis as lying murderess Leslie Crosbie faces a moment of awful truth
with her husband (Herbert Marshall).
The 1 l >K()s are not a great de
cade for movie revival houses.
Despite all the attention given
to film scholarship and
reconstruction, the eagerness of
young audiences in the late 'Ms
and early 70s to see unusual
films, foreign pictures, the
lesser- known work of famous
directors or the often
praiseworthy but commercially
unsuccessful work of less fa
mous directors, has passed to a
complacency about watching
movies or a lack of imagination

on the part of those who put to
gether film series (or both).
The New Varsity oecasionally
shows good movies that have
not surfaced for years (like
Sunday, Bloody Sunday or
Claire's Knee earlier this year),
hut poor attendance wears
down their efforts to vary their
programming. The Bijou, which
reopened as a revival theater in
December with a loudly trum
peted commitment to show the
kind of movies that too seldom
appear in moviehouses these
days, has lately been reduced to
advertising double bills of On
Golden Pond and Terms of En

dearment. (The Bijou's new
management must hold the local
record for quickest sellout.)
Even the once reliable Festival
Cinema, which could be
counted on at least to restrict
their schedule to older Holly
wood and British movies, has
included On Golden Pond in its
latest schedule, excusing its
crassness with a pitifully disin
genuous note about the "history
making" pairing of two great
stars. Can the term "cinematic
history" truly be applied to
any movie that shows up as reg-

ularly as the 1981 Oscar-laden
On Golden Pond?
Despite the preponderance of
film societies on the Stanford
campus, where the same com
mercial considerations should
not dictate policy, courageous
programming is almost un
known outside of the occasional
festivals sponsored by the
Japanese and German Studies
Departments or the highly
esoteric offerings of that bizarre
organization that calls itself the
Great Directors Film Series and
operates out of STARTS.
(Their films don't even attempt
to represent the work of great

directors, and they include per
verse — sometimes lunatic —
choices, but at least they aren't
conventional.)
However, having been, as an
undergraduate, fortunate
enough to attend a university
with a remarkable film society
(we had only one), I persist in
believing that the way to build
up a serious film audience on
campus is to provide a consis
tently intelligent, provocative
and entertaining alternative to
the Sunday Flicks' endless recy
cling of last season's box office

hits and the monthly screenings
in other corners of The Philadel
phia Story and Citizen Kane. (1
love these two movies as much
as the next guy, but Hollywood
did turn out more than two good
pictures in the '30s and '405.)
Permit me, therefore, to offer a
list of 15 movies — none shown
within 45 miles of this university
in at least the four years I have
been writing about movies for
The Daily — that barely begins
to suggest the untapped
treasures furnished by the last
six decades of filmmaking.
Easy Living (1937): Preston
Sturges wrote the script for this
screwball comedy before he'd
made his debut as a director,
"tmd-'PfrrawmH-nt 1 -hnnde-ebH —
Mitchell Leisen, who gave it an
elegant veneer Sturges himself
might have scorned. Jean Ar
thur plays a working class wo
man who becomes involved with
an eccentric rich family ("rich"
and "eccentric" were always
synonyms in Depression
comedies) when one of them
drops a mink coat on her head
from his penthouse balcony as
she passes on an open-air bus.
Forbidden Games (1951):
Rene Clement's indelible
tragedy about the effects of war
on children — surely the
greatest film to come out of
France between the Occupation
and the late-'sos aesthetic take
over of the New Wave directors.
Clement's fable is comparable
to Renoir's "Grand Illusion" in
its power and trenchancy.
(Neither contains any actual
battle scenes.)

(1955): During the golden age
