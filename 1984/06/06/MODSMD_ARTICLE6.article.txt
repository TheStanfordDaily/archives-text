# Mosher sends answer to Kennedy's letter
## 
### ADAM GOODMAN Daily staff 
Expelled anthropology graduate
student Stephen Mosher and his
lawyer have mailed a 39-page
response to University President
Donald Kennedy, who last month re
quested Mosher to "supplement the
record" for a possible reconsideration
of the expulsion.
Mosher said his letter refers to spe
cific questions Kennedy asked and
also refutes the testimony of Mosher's
former wife, Maggie So. Mosher
claims he in fact had earlier answered
all of the specific questions concerning
his research in China.
Most of the letter deals with the tes
timony of So. "Maggie So's account is
almost totally a fiction," the letter
says. "She was not an eyewitness . ..
and seems to have invented details
freely as she and (Anthropology Prof.)
Jane Collier discussed my "crimes."
"If there is anthing new in my
response it lies in the large amount of
background information that I have
provided you so that you may judge
for yourself the credibility of Maggie
So's allegations."
The Anthropology Department ad
hoc committee which dismissed Mosh
er from the doctoral program last
February for illegal and unethical con

duct had heard So's testimony. Accor
ding to Mosher. some of the accusa
tions made concerned his mental state
and used the term "insanity."
Mosher said in an interview yester
day that he hopes Kennedy will now
personally review the case. Kennedy
had said in his May 1 letter to Mosher
that if any new action were taken it
would most likely be referring the
matter back to the ad hoc committee
for "limited reconsideration."
In an attached letter to Iris Brest.
University staff counsel, Mosher's
lawyer, Steven Fabbro, wrote, "It is
our hope that President Kennedy will
either consider the matter personally
or with you and your staff assistants.
In any event we hope President Ken
nedy will not simply rely on the
original ad hoc committee or other
previous review personnel to review
the matter at this juncture."
Mosher worries the committee "has
already comitted itself publicly" to his
expulsion. "We hope the president
himself will rule on it,"he said.
Mosher said that in a February let
ter he received from Kennedy he had
understood that Kennedy alone would
do any possible reviewing.
Brest had no comment on the latest
information received from Mosher
and Fabbro, and she said she "did not
have any expectations." She said the
President's Office had in fact received
the letter as well, but she did not know
if Kennedy had read it. Kennedy is
currently in Orange County and not
available for comment.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the presi
dent. maintained yesterday afternoon
that the letter had not yet been
received. Kennedy had set a June 1
deadline for Mosher to respond.
Fabbro's secretary said yesterday
evening that she had mailed the letters
dated May 31 on June 1.
Mosher claims all of the incidents
raised by Kennedy had "honest ex
planations." These included refer
ences to a trip through China's off
limits Guizhou province, damage done
to Mosher's van, the sale of a truck to
an agricultural collective group and
the removal of research materials
from the country.
"I was in a very difficult situation in
China," Mosher said. "I took out 20
boxes of research legally: to say it was
secret was unjustifiable."
Mosher once again stated that he
believed he was expelled because of
pressure from Chinese officials an
gered by his documentation of forced
abortions in China which was printed
in a Taiwanese magazine article.
He also again denied to give
specifics about the actual questioned
events. The committee "did not set
out to prove in any one instance what
was so unethical or illegal that they
had no choice but to expel me," he
said.
The University has also been silent
for the most part concerning the

specifics of the case, refusing to
release the ad hoc committee's report.
The University's release to The Daily
of Kennedy's letter to Mosher last
month was the first time any detailed
information has been provided.
Kennedy's request for more infor
mation from Mosher was based on his
receiving of a letter from a Ms. Va
quer, who disputed the testimony of
So. Mosher said Vaquer, who was in
correctly reported earlier as connected
with Stanford, was "very close to

Maggie So hut not close" to him. He
said Vaquer knew So in China and in
the United States, but that he had not
requested her testimony concerning
So which was received in February, a
year after his expulsion.
Mosher maintains he will sue the
University if he is not reinstated and
has called the charges against him
libelous.
