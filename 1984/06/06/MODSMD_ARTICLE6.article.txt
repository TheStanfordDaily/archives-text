# Mosher sends answer to Kennedy's letter
## 
### ADAM GOODMAN Daily staff 
Expelled anthropology graduate
student Stephen Mosher and his
lawyer have mailed a 39-page
response to University President
Donald Kennedy, who last month re
quested Mosher to "supplement the
record" for a possible reconsideration
of the expulsion.
Mosher said his letter refers to spe
cific questions Kennedy asked and
also refutes the testimony of Mosher's
former wife, Maggie So. Mosher
claims he in fact had earlier answered
all of the specific questions concerning
his research in China.
Most of the letter deals with the tes
timony of So. "Maggie So's account is
almost totally a fiction," the letter
says. "She was not an eyewitness . ..
and seems to have invented details
freely as she and (Anthropology Prof.)
Jane Collier discussed my "crimes."
"If there is anthing new in my
response it lies in the large amount of
background information that I have
provided you so that you may judge
for yourself the credibility of Maggie
So's allegations."
The Anthropology Department ad
hoc committee which dismissed Mosh
er from the doctoral program last
February for illegal and unethical con

duct had heard So's testimony. Accor
ding to Mosher. some of the accusa
tions made concerned his mental state
and used the term "insanity."
Mosher said in an interview yester
day that he hopes Kennedy will now
personally review the case. Kennedy
had said in his May 1 letter to Mosher
that if any new action were taken it
would most likely be referring the
matter back to the ad hoc committee
for "limited reconsideration."
In an attached letter to Iris Brest.
University staff counsel, Mosher's
lawyer, Steven Fabbro, wrote, "It is
our hope that President Kennedy will
either consider the matter personally
or with you and your staff assistants.
In any event we hope President Ken
nedy will not simply rely on the
original ad hoc committee or other
previous review personnel to review
the matter at this juncture."
Mosher worries the committee "has
already comitted itself publicly" to his
expulsion. "We hope the president
himself will rule on it,"he said.
Mosher said that in a February let
ter he received from Kennedy he had
understood that Kennedy alone would
do any possible reviewing.
Brest had no comment on the latest
