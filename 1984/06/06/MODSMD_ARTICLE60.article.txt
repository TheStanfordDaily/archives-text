# Whipping Boy's music powerful and angry in 'Muru Muru'
## 
### LARRY NADLER 
The sun has settled. Fog hangs thick and
viscous in the air as crickets chirp trom
across the still lake. No one is around to
hear the sudden splash of warm water as I
jump in and submerge . . . switch scenes.
Standing in a spacious living room — my
first look at a Stanford University fraternity
party. The smell of leather, sweat and alco
hol permeate the air. Music, or rather, a
sonic assault is being hurled around the
room by the band. Whipping Boy, the mo
mentum picked up and sustained by the
frantic dancers. A blond jock holds a whis
key and soda in one hand, watching the un
folding scenario with deep-rooted ridicule.
The first Whipping Boy Ll'. The Sound oj
No Haml.s Clapping, was released a couple
of years ago to wide critical approval in the
underground music press, although the
band remained largely ignored among its
Stanford peers. That album was a raw af
firmation of dissatisfaction and warning.
The production was crude, but the energy
unrelenting.
Songs like "Meltdown." "Radioactive
Earth," and"America Must Die" tried to
break down personal and societal fortresses
by attacking the institutions, roles, and
other traps we use to attempt to qualify and
categorize the puzzles of civ ilization.
Fifty years ago, Freud wrote that "the
fatefui question for the human species (is)
whether and to what extent their cultural
development will succeed 111 mastering the
disturbance of their communal lite b\ the
human instinct ot aggression and sell
destruction." As I watch the scene .it the
fraternity party. I beui to feel myself being
hypnotized b *' ij; b • ' ot the band.
I Jnconscioti 1 1 1 1 move.

Listening to a test pressing of Whipping
Boy's second album, Muru Muru, (an
aborigine greeting), I was struck by the crisp
production by the Dead Kennedy's Klaus
Flouride — still angry and rough, but with
added dimension and gleaming edges.
"Muru Muru" abounds with constant sonic
surprises — powerful music adorned with
grave textures and deep caverns of vibration
and rhythm. For instance, "Junkman," a
grinding blues workout that sounds some
thing like Hendrix in a delirium. Steve Bal
linger's sorrowful guitar riffs wail as lead
vocalist Eugene Robinson sings of "gun
blue nut nusters stoolie grinning shuck
sters."
Robinson's vocals are fascinating
throughout — his voice has gained tremen
dous flexibility, becoming a multidimen
sional tool of expression and passion.
"Myster Magi" begins with muffled
whispers, the sound of water dripping, and a
steady heartbeat on the bass drum, rocket
ing into an explosion of fury as Sam Smoot's
snarling bass lines rumble and Dave Owen's
drums shake and crash.
By the song's end, Eugene seems to have
become the desperate protagonist of the
song, the "kingpin in the machine he alone
can save." a chosen prophet with the futile
mission of saving humanity from imminent
destruction.
"\lv mission is sort ot .1 damaged /.en
mission. I'd hopefully like to brinjg
spiritualit\ back and have people look at it
and deal with it not as an object of some
ridicule, but as a natural part of the human
experience." said Robinson in an interview
last year.
Compared to No Hands Clapping, Muru
Muru is much more interesting in terms of
rich emotional imagers delving into un

charted sectors of the human psyche. "Once
in a Lifetime" is a painfully honest confes
sion of romantic selfishness, while
" Nevermore" taps a fountain of sadness and
nostalgic yearning for a love decayed: "love
letters whisper scratches on paper/love let
ters glorious past frozen in time."
I've heard Whipping Boy being con
fronted with the charge of negativity. Care
ful listening of Muru Muru, however, yields
a very positive personal message, the vital
importance of being true to your own iden
tity and instincts. Indeed, these songs are
enticingly open to wide personal interpreta
tion. "My Day at the Lake" could be
anybody's day at the lake, anyone's con
frontation with life's meandering cross
roads: "My day at the lake/look at my life
you see nothing/that's what I had
before/Today I opened the door." "Vision"
is a reggae-tinged declaration of indepen
dence from the "crooked light from the
crooked prism" that distorts and corrupts
true perception.
Thoreau once lamented that "the whole
ground of human life (seemed) to some to
have been gone over by their predecessors,
both the heights and the valleys, and all
things to have been cared for." Whipping
Boy. like Thoreau, will gladly discount such
a notion, and Muru Muru presents the ad
venturous listener with some luring heights
and valleys.
You may come away from this album with
the feeling I had coming away from that fra
ternitv party — that there are always
surprises, m steries and hope for true indi
vidual expression even in a society that
processes culture like Velveeta cheese.
Keep an eye out for Muru Muru, due out in
finer record boutiqu mid-June.
