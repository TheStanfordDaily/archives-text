# New play 'Skaters' lacks direction and directing

Stephen Wylie's new play,
"Skaters," which opened at the
Magic Theatre last week is a
fine example of a young
playwright struggling to find his
own voice. "Skaters" is a play
that, at moments, has a caustic
quirky view of American family
life, which allows the audience
both to embrace and reject
Wylie's characters. In the style
of the best stage farces,
"Skaters" never slows down its
frantic pace to ask questions,
and in the style of the best ab
surdist dramas "Skaters" is full
of questions that need to be an
swered.
The assumption behind the
action ol the play is that since
the world has stopped making
sense so long ago, it would be a
futile gesture to try and find any
meaning in life. This assumption
gives the play a sort of desperate
pain, an unnecessary agony that
haunts the characters. This
shunning of answers to describe
pain gives the play a strong im
mediacy, as if the audience were
receiving a pure view of Ameri
can family life, a view untram
meled by an outside intelli
gence. This is "Skaters" at its
best.
"Skaters" at its worst is a
cliched piece of tripe that relies
on stereotypes and stock scenes,
which even a hack television
writer would not dredge up. It
clutters the stage with boring
and useless characters, saying
boring and useless things within
boring and useless scenes. The
play becomes episodic, losing
track of the main characters and
glorifying the boring ones. It
makes a point in saying the
banal and never reaches a satis
fying conclusion even though it
tries three or four times. Finally

it ends when our young
playwright, Wylie, finds a way
to bring in the title one more
time.
"Skaters" is about the loss of
unity in the American family.
The father, a colonel in the
army, is never home and lives in
a Winnebago trailer. It is clearly
the best written part in the play.
The absurdity of the play seems
to rise up out of this man; he
defines himself completely.
There is no need of explanation.
Without creating a stereotype,
Wylie has created a character
that the audience understands
immediately, an everchanging
cardboard cutout-symbol of ir
responsible fatherhood. He is a
cartoon character who can ex
perience pain and confusion
without losing either his car
toonish exterior, or the im
mediancy of his feelings.
If there is a center to
"Skaters," it is the mother of
the family, Mrs. Warren. The
part is not as will written or
defined as the Colonel, but that
is only because Wylie is trying
something more difficult with
her. Like the other characters,
she too is cartoonish, but not
enough to detract from the
feeling that she is the only one
in the play still trying to make
sense of the world around her.
Her pain is more real, more
physical and down to earth than
anyone elses. Where the other
characters experience transfor
mations, she feels an actual pain
that is easier to assess. She hurts
when her children leave her,
and is outraged at her husband
who only comes home for
holidays because America is
more important than his fam
ily. In a moment of desperation
to combat the senselessness she
feels towards her husband, she

tries to pull her wedding ring
off. Unable to do this, she sticks
her hand in a meat grinder and
grinds her fingers into pulp. For
Mrs. Warren, answers only
come with physical pain.
The Warren's two children.
Maddy and Lyle, are unpolished
creations on Wylie's part It is as
if Wylie had not yet reconciled
his relation to these two charac
ters. They seem line when sur
rounded by the two strong char
acters of their parents but
become curiously flat when the
play's action takes them outside

the family unit. Wylie. for some
reason, teels the need to justify
the children's strangeness where
he did not for the parents. This
need to explain the plight of the
children is not only insufficent
as explanation, but slows the
pace ol the play, which is all im
portant tor this type of
absurdist-farce.
Wylie's laults as a playwright
are never clearer than in his
depiction ot Maddy's boyfriend
and Lvle's girlfriend. Maddy's
boyfriend is a blatant stereotype
of the black-stud-athlete. This

portrayal is even more disturb
ing when Wylie throws a few
liberal statements about blacks
into "Skaters," and then creates
a character that clearly denies
his liberal pretensions. I.vies'
girlfriend, however, is an
amazing creation on Wylie's
part. He manages to create a
character who is completely
oblivious to the world without
making her dumb. The audience
tirst sees her as a prostitute who
does not know that she is paid to
have sex; she thinks all she has
to do is talk. I he scene's ending

line is. "I hope 1 did everything
right. I'hey never told me what
to do back at the place." Wylie
gives this character some beauti
ful things to say. such as when
she compares herself to a
tumbleweed. He creates great
depth in this character at the
same time that he lets her ap
pear as a rather non-thinking
flower child. She is a masterful
creation.
The rest of the characters in
the plav should be cut; they are
not even worth mentioning.
The Magic Theatre's produc

tion of "Skaters" is an excellent
one. Tom Dahlgren as the
Colonel and Maud Winchester
as the girl are brillent. Carol
Shoup-Sanders as Mrs. Warren
is excellent, and James Bundy as
l.yle and Christianne Hauber as
Muddy are both very good. The
rest of the players hold up their
parts well. Andrew Doe's direc
tion has an excellent sense ot
how to bring out the play's
strong points. The interesting
set. sound and light design were
by lerdinand Penker. Al Agius-
Sinerco and Margaret Dunn.


Tom Dahlgren is a less than devoted husband as the colonel in "Skaters" and Carol Shoup-Sanders makes a brilliant performance as his angry wife.

Stephen Wylie's new play,
"Skaters," which opened at the
Magic Theatre last week is a
fine example of a young
playwright struggling to find his
own voice. "Skaters" is a play
that, at moments, has a caustic
quirky view of American family
life, which allows the audience
both to embrace and reject
Wylie's characters. In the style
of the best stage farces,
"Skaters" never slows down its
frantic pace to ask questions,
and in the style of the best ab
surdist dramas "Skaters" is full
of questions that need to be an
swered.
The assumption behind the
action ol the play is that since
the world has stopped making
sense so long ago, it would be a
futile gesture to try and find any
meaning in life. This assumption
gives the play a sort of desperate
pain, an unnecessary agony that
haunts the characters. This
shunning of answers to describe
pain gives the play a strong im
mediacy, as if the audience were
receiving a pure view of Ameri
can family life, a view untram
meled by an outside intelli
gence. This is "Skaters" at its
best.
"Skaters" at its worst is a
cliched piece of tripe that relies
on stereotypes and stock scenes,
which even a hack television
writer would not dredge up. It
clutters the stage with boring
and useless characters, saying
boring and useless things within
boring and useless scenes. The
play becomes episodic, losing
track of the main characters and
glorifying the boring ones. It
makes a point in saying the
banal and never reaches a satis
fying conclusion even though it
tries three or four times. Finally

it ends when our young
playwright, Wylie, finds a way
to bring in the title one more
time.
"Skaters" is about the loss of
unity in the American family.
The father, a colonel in the
army, is never home and lives in
a Winnebago trailer. It is clearly
the best written part in the play.
The absurdity of the play seems
to rise up out of this man; he
defines himself completely.
There is no need of explanation.
Without creating a stereotype,
Wylie has created a character
that the audience understands
immediately, an everchanging
cardboard cutout-symbol of ir
responsible fatherhood. He is a
cartoon character who can ex
perience pain and confusion
without losing either his car
toonish exterior, or the im
mediancy of his feelings.
If there is a center to
"Skaters," it is the mother of
the family, Mrs. Warren. The
part is not as will written or
defined as the Colonel, but that
is only because Wylie is trying
something more difficult with
her. Like the other characters,
she too is cartoonish, but not
enough to detract from the
feeling that she is the only one
in the play still trying to make
sense of the world around her.
Her pain is more real, more
physical and down to earth than
anyone elses. Where the other
characters experience transfor
mations, she feels an actual pain
that is easier to assess. She hurts
when her children leave her,
and is outraged at her husband
who only comes home for
holidays because America is
more important than his fam
ily. In a moment of desperation
to combat the senselessness she
feels towards her husband, she

tries to pull her wedding ring
off. Unable to do this, she sticks
her hand in a meat grinder and
grinds her fingers into pulp. For
Mrs. Warren, answers only
come with physical pain.
The Warren's two children.
Maddy and Lyle, are unpolished
creations on Wylie's part It is as
if Wylie had not yet reconciled
his relation to these two charac
ters. They seem line when sur
rounded by the two strong char
acters of their parents but
become curiously flat when the
play's action takes them outside

the family unit. Wylie. for some
reason, teels the need to justify
the children's strangeness where
he did not for the parents. This
need to explain the plight of the
children is not only insufficent
as explanation, but slows the
pace ol the play, which is all im
portant tor this type of
absurdist-farce.
Wylie's laults as a playwright
are never clearer than in his
depiction ot Maddy's boyfriend
and Lvle's girlfriend. Maddy's
boyfriend is a blatant stereotype
of the black-stud-athlete. This

portrayal is even more disturb
ing when Wylie throws a few
liberal statements about blacks
into "Skaters," and then creates
a character that clearly denies
his liberal pretensions. I.vies'
girlfriend, however, is an
amazing creation on Wylie's
part. He manages to create a
character who is completely
oblivious to the world without
making her dumb. The audience
tirst sees her as a prostitute who
does not know that she is paid to
have sex; she thinks all she has
to do is talk. I he scene's ending

line is. "I hope 1 did everything
right. I'hey never told me what
to do back at the place." Wylie
gives this character some beauti
ful things to say. such as when
she compares herself to a
tumbleweed. He creates great
depth in this character at the
same time that he lets her ap
pear as a rather non-thinking
flower child. She is a masterful
creation.
The rest of the characters in
the plav should be cut; they are
not even worth mentioning.
The Magic Theatre's produc

tion of "Skaters" is an excellent
one. Tom Dahlgren as the
Colonel and Maud Winchester
as the girl are brillent. Carol
Shoup-Sanders as Mrs. Warren
is excellent, and James Bundy as
l.yle and Christianne Hauber as
Muddy are both very good. The
rest of the players hold up their
parts well. Andrew Doe's direc
tion has an excellent sense ot
how to bring out the play's
strong points. The interesting
set. sound and light design were
by lerdinand Penker. Al Agius-
Sinerco and Margaret Dunn.
