# At least one performance makes 'Erendira' fascinating

As the aging matriarch who pimps
for her teenage granddaughter in
Erendira, Irene Papas acts with out
rageous abandon. I haven't seen a per
formance on such a grand scale, physi
cally and emotionally, since Marilia
Pera's as the whore in the Brazilian
Pixote — and Erendira's director, too,
/ Brazilian, Rin Guerra. It's the
most international of movies, a
German-French-Spanish co
production in which a famous Greek
actress stars in material written by a
Nobel Prize-winning Colombian au
thor. Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and the
cast also includes a well-known
French character actor, Michel
Lonsdale, in a supporting role.
When you see Irene Papas on film
as Antigone or Electra, as Helen in
The Trojan Women or the Klytem
nestra of Iphigenia, you realize that
the line of great tragedians has contin
ued unbroken into contemporary
Greece. But Papas is not a stage tech

nician; she has succeeded in tempering
the immense stylization of classic
tragedy with the subtlety of film act
ing. Whispering Electra's curses into
the ear of her dead mother, bathing
Helen's feet in the drinking water a
soldier has carried to the tent where
she is held prisoner. Papas is as inti
mate as she is bold. And maybe you
would have to be schooled in the fero
cious passions of classical drama in or
der to play one of Garcia Marquez's
majestic, dilapidated old dragons,
those unkillable Rasputins who
survive unimaginable disasters and
their own children.
I think it is safe to say that no
American actress and probably no
British one could play this role — a
woman who relives all the horrors of
her life, eyes wide open, in
nightmares, who stuffs gobs of
poisoned birthday cake into her
mouth with her fingers and then
cackles delightedly when her thick

hair. richly silvered at the roots, falls
out in handfuls — without appearing
ludicrous. Casting Papas in this mythic
role was not just a stroke of genius,
but quite possibly the only choice that

could have made the film work. She is
magnificent, and all of Erendira flows
from her performance.
The trailers for Erendira claim that
Garcia Marquez's screenplay is based

on a "selection" from "100 Years of
Solitude," but in fact Erendira and her
grandmother, who forces her to pay
off on her back the house that burned
down around her while she slept, are

incidental characters who cross the
pages of that glorious family chronicle
only fleetingly. In a short story called
"The Incredible and Sad Tale of Inno
cent Erendira and Her Heartless

Grandmother," published here in
Esquire in 1972, Garcia Marquez ex
panded on this incident, and his
screenplay is an almost literal
dramatization of the story.
And Ruy Guerra has faithfully
transcribed all the Garcia Marquez
trademarks: the obstinately
idiosyncratic characters, the "Arabian
Nights" details (orange* grown with
diamonds inside, women who
consume entire cakes laced with rat
poison yet live through the night), the
savage, unpredictable humor, and the
themes — magic and charlatanism,
death and survival, the repetition of
history. Guerra is a perfectly com
petent director; his images are not
kinetic or erotic, but they're also not
his images: Reading the story after
seeing the picture, you realize that
Garcia Marquez actually invented
every moment himself. The extended
instant when Erendira (Claudia
Ohana), resisting the touch of her first
client, is flung through the air so that

her hair seems frozen derives from the
sentence, "She fought him off with a
scratch on the face . . . but he replied
with a solemn slap that lifted her off
the ground and suspended her in the
air for an instant with her long Medusa
hair floating in space;" the surreal
depiction of Erendira's distracted
thoughts during sex is dictated by the
phrase, "-remained as if toscinated t>y
the moonbeams from a fish that was
floating through the storm air;" and so
on.
We can dream of a film of this talc
as, say, the Bertolucci of The Con
formist might have made it, but we
can't really complain that Guerra has
misunderstood the story or violated it
in any way — except perhaps in the
casting of Oliver Wehe, an inadequate
physical choice for the role of Ulises,
the angelic boy who liberates Eren
dira. Guerra doesn't personalize the
material, but he renders it intel
ligently, and he's wise enough to leave
it in Irene Papas' command.
