# Music makes 'Streets of Fire' a feeble rock drama
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
|112 Bruce Springsteen had written the
songs for Streets of Fire, it might be a
more compelling movie. The director,
Walter Hill, got the title for his movie
— which he calls "a rock and roll
fable"' — from a 1978 Springsteen
ballad, in which the white-hot vocal
articulates, with a histrionic intensity
usually found only in opera, the
depths of urban paranoia. In Streets oj
Fire, as in his 1979 The Warriors, Hill
stylizes urban terror by converting a
city drama about street gangs and a
heroic ghetto bad boy who fights for
the woman he loves into pure pop
mythology, incorporating all three
classic American genres: the western,
the gangster picture and the musical.

The Warriors was, in its hal
lucinatory design and rhythmic
editing, a rock 'n' roll movie by sug
gestion; in Streets of Fire Hill has con
sciously placed rock at the center of
the film by making his heroine, Ellen
Aim (Diane Lane), a pop star whose
abduction by Raven (William Dafoe),
the malevolent leader of a motorcycle
gang, sends her old flame Tom Cody
(Michael Pare) into action.
Hill and Larry Gross, his co-writer,
clearly conceived the whole picture as
much in terms of the songs as the char
acters or storyline or visual imagery.

and Ellen's performances are meant to
carry much of the emotional weight —
just as the live numbers (shameless
imitations of Springsteen and Jim
Morrison) did in Eddie and the
Cruisers, another failed rock musical
drama. (Pare starred in that film, too,
as the band's enigmatic genius.) But
the songs in Streets of Fire aren't
electrifying; they're synthetic-sexy,
the way Pat Benatar's and Bonnie
Tyler's songs are, with enfeebled
female vocals (rendered by Laurie
Sargent and Holly Sherwood) that
shift our attention to Ellen's B-girl
clothes. Listening to the opening tune,
"Nowhere Fast," I couldn't get the
Bonnie Tyler hit "Total Eclipse of the
Heart" out of my head, and after-

wards, consulting the film's press kit, I
realized why: Tyler's composer
producer. Jim Steinman, wrote it, and
he wrote the equally mediocre finale,
"Tonight Is What It Means to Be
Young," too.
What could have prompted Walter
Hill to make his heroine a queen of
lipstick rock? Taking her cue from
those songs, Diane plays Ellen as
a pouty teen bitch who takes no spe
cial pride in her craft; when one of her
fans (Elizabeth Dailey) praises her
records, she answers that she doesn't
write or even choose her own songs

and seems only vaguely aware of
where they come from or how they
have been altered to fit her talents.
You begin to think that this performer
is nothing but a slick collage of other
people's parts — the arranger's, the
costumers', the makeup artist's, the
hairdresser's.
In order for a musical like Streets of
Fire to succeed, we don't have to
believe in Ellen as a human being, but
her singing does have to mesmerize us,
and the songs should be infused with
more than just commercially wrought
sexual energy. Ellen Aim ought to
give us a fever — like Bette Midler did
in The Rose, like David Byrne does in
the upcoming Talking Heads concert
film Stop Making Sense.
Hill's kinetic The Warriors was mar
velous, I thought, and its fantasy vi
sion of a glowing subterranean New
York has made it impossible for me to
look at a subway car in the same way
since. Streets of Fire could be a sequel
to The Warriors, or at least a com
panion piece: They share a cinematog
rapher (Andrew Laszlo), a tempo, and
a presentational, exaggerated style.
(We're not intended to take anything
in it very seriously.) But 1 sensed that
Hill had shot the titles first — one of
the best credits sequences I've ever
seen (he uses a jagged wipe technique
to freeze the action that astonishes
you every time he applies it) — and
then lost interest in the project. It's
the work of a master technician and a
born entertainer, but it lacks purpose.
The story parallels that of The War
riors, with Tom accepting the mission
to bring Ellen back to her home turf
— safe from the crazy bikers and the
corrupt cops in another part of town
— but Hill cheats us of the electric
street battle that our experiences at
the first picture (and the structure of
this one) geared us up for; the movie
ends prematurely. And all along you
keep asking yourself why Hill wanted
to make the film anyway, since he nei
ther took it in a different direction
from The Warriors nor capitalized on
all of the elements that gave the ear
lier film its excitement and immediacy.
When Diane Lane sings her first
number, those of us who saw The
Warriors can recognize Deborah Van

Valkenburgh in the crowd — the
young actress who, as the desperately
love-starved tough girl who attaches
herself to the Warriors' chief, gave the
single performance in that movie that
transcended its deliberately rigid en
semble style. (Some of the other ac
tors, like James Remar and David
Patrick Kelly, contributed consider
able wit to the proceedings, but the
acting generally stuck to a series of
highly photogenic attitudes.) She's the
only Warriors veteran I spotted in the
cast, except for Lynne Thigpen (the
black D.J. who communicated the
threats of other gangs to the Warriors
as they crossed the city) in a cameo as
— what else? — a subway car driver.
Van Valkenburgh has grown up in
these five years, but her face still

carries the conflicting messages of
hard-shelled street smartness and vul
nerability, and we wait for her charac
ter to develop. She has a thin, obliga
tory role, though — a subservient role,
as Michael Pare's sister, who writes to
tell him about Ellen's abduction and
then remains in the background for
the rest of the film. Her old part has
passed on, in modified form, to Amy
Madigan, who — as a mop-haired
gunslinger who gets Cody to hire her
as a deputy — gives the freshest line
readings in the movie.
As for Pare, he has yet to establish
himself as more than a wonderful
camera (baby) face, though if Martin
Scorsese ever finishes his film of The
Last Temptation of Christ. Pare will be
right at the center of it (in the role De

Niro was originally slated for). Pare
probably landed the lead in Streets of
Fire, as well as the title part in Eddie
and the Cruisers, because he's a James
Dean type, and we hadn't had one of
those in at least six months. A stronger
Tom Cody might not make a startling
difference to this picture, however,
since Ellen Aim's ennui effectively
turns him into a sap when he risks his
life to rescue her. So on a simple emo
tional level. Streets of Fire isn't very
satisfying, though the time passes
pleasantly enough while you're watch
ing it, and Hill's craftsmanship keeps
you interested in what's on the screen.
But you hope for a lot more than you
get; Streets of Fire is another in a series
of disappointing recent pictures by
gifted American directors.
