The French Connection
(1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
William Friedkin did a neat,
craftsmanlike job of directing
Ernest Tidyman's script (from a
Robin Cook novel) about the
trackdown of a heroin connec
tion in New York and Paris. And
Gene Hackman is excellent as
"Popeye" Doyle, the tough, in
dividualistic cop in charge of the
case. All told, this bloody steam
roller of a thriller is terribly ef
fective — but it's also a highly
unpleasant experience, and
manipulative in a way that raises
moral questions. The supporting
cast features Roy Scheider, Fer
nando Rev and Tony Lo Bianco.
Plays next Wednesday with
Scarface.
Performance (1970)
Bijou, Palo Alto
James Fox and Mick Jagger
play opposite numbers — a
gangster and a rock singer —
who. Persona-like, merge and
switch personalities in this
druggy cult favorite by Nicolas
Roeg (who also photographed)
and Donald Cammell (who
wrote the script). Roeg hadn't
yet acquired his talent for
erotica: The sex scenes, in which
all sorts of combinations are
hinted at, make so little visual
sense that they have a distinctly
soporific effect. Incoherent and
extremely unpleasant, this is a
film that perhaps can only be
comprehended by moviegoers
who see it under the influence of
chemicals but can be detested by
all of us. The only redeeming
few moments are provided by
Jagger, who performs one ter
rific number. Anita Pallenberg
heads an undistinguished sup
porting cast.
Plays Friday with Brimstone
and Treacle.
Morocco (1930)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Cinephiles who take Josef von
Sternberg's American movies
seriously have a lot of explaining
to do when it comes to this one,
which Jules Furthman wrote in a
very light, very silly mood. Mar
lene Dietrich (in her first film in
this country) plays a cabaret
singer who follows her man,
Gary Cooper, a Legionnaire,
into the desert. (She first
removes her high heels.) Terrific
fun.
Plays next Wednesday with
The Lost Honor of Katharina
Blum.
Eboli (1980)
York, San Francisco
In Christ Stopped at Eboli.
Carlo Levi tells of the months he
spent during the mid-1930s in a
remote, backward Italian village
where Mussolini's government
had exiled him for his anti-fascist
sentiments. (A prefatory passage
in Levi's wonderful book,
quoted in the film, explains the
title: "Christ stopped at Eboli
where the road and the railway
abandon . . . Christ never came
this far — nor did time or history
nor hope nor redemption.")
The extraordinary Italian direc
tor Francesco Rosi shaped this
richly suggestive material into
his most masterly film, starring
(in perhaps his best perfor
mance) the remarkable Gian
Maria Volonte, with Irene
Papas, Lea Massari and Alain
Cuny. (This is the uncut, 3'/2-
hour version not originally
released in this country.)
Plays Monday.
The Seven Year Itch (1955)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
George Axelrod's 1953
Broadway comedy about a hap
pily married man who lusts after
Ins upstairs neighbor while his
wife is on vacation had a Walter
Mitty charm: in this misshapen
film version, directed by Billy
Wilder, what had been sweet

and understated became broad
and sniggery. Tom Ewell, who
never could tone down his stage
mannerisms for the camera,
repeats his performance as the
fantasizing husband, but the
movie really focuses on the sexy
neighbor — a roie altered radi
cally to fit Marilyn Monroe.
Axelrod is listed as co
screenwriter (with Wilder), but
he couldn't have been very
happy with the results, which
make his play look so tired and
so foolishly dated that no one
ever considers it for revival now.
(It's a forgotten gem — one of
the few good original American
comedies of the '505.)
Plays today with Some Like It
Hot.
The Lovers (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The love scenes between
Jeanne Moreau and Alain Cuny,
including a celebrated assigna
tion in a rowboat, are among the
most erotic ever filmed, but the
director, Louis Malle, doesn't
seem to have had any other rea
son for making the picture: The
rest of it is rather chilly and for
mal. The Louise de Valmorin
script is an obvious variation on
Madame Bovary, and the role
turned Moreau into a star. In
one of the most breathtaking
compositions (lit by Henri
Decae), she hides in the
shadows, held from behind by
Cuny, her hair and nightgown
billowing in the wind. (The film's
sensibility may cause one to
giggle.)
Plays tomorrow with The Nun.
Effi Briest (1977)
U.C. Theater. Berkeley
Rainer Werner Fassbinder's
most respectable movie (except
perhaps for his lengthy television
adaptation of Berlin Alexan
derplatz) was this rendering of
the Theodor Fontane novel,
starring Hanna Schygulla.
Practically a definition of the art
house film, this carefully
detailed period piece moves so
slowly that you feel as if you're
stuck in an airless compartment
on a broken-down train some
where in the German
countryside: The landscape is
beautiful, but you aren't going
anywhere, and after a while you
can't breathe. The film is well
made, though; it marked one of
Fassbinder's first departures
from the rickety formal ex
perimentation that first won him
the attention of European crit
ics.
Plays Monday with Celeste.
An American Tragedy (1931)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Josef von Sternberg's film of
the Theodore Dreiser novel —
one of the cornerstones of
American naturalism — may
have provoked the earliest con
troversy over the filmmaker's re
sponsibility in adapting material
from another medium: Dreiser
was so incensed with the film
that he picketed it. (Had he lived
to see the second version, A
Place in the Sun. 20 years later,
he would certainly have picketed
it as well, though the director,
George Stevens, distorted the
novel in a different way.)
Dreiser had considerable justifi
cation — Sternberg's film is
glossy melodrama — but you
come away from it with the
image of Sylvia Sidney as the
doomed working-class girl firmly
in your mind. (Sidney was the
great proletarian heroine of
American movies of the Depres

sion.) Phillips Holmes plays the
wide-eyed social climber —
Dreiser's answer to Stendhal's
Julien Sorel — who dumps his
pregnant girlfriend for an aris
tocratic beauty, played by
Frances Dee (who. like Sylvia
Sidney, could act as well as hold
the camera). Lee Garmes super
vised the first-rate cinematog
raphy.
Plays tonight.
True Heart Susie (1919)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
D. W. Griffith's charming pas
toral romance stars Richard Bar
thelmess and the exquisite young
Lillian Gish. (This was her great
Griffith period. In 19 IS she
starred in Hearts of the World as
the young woman driven to dis
traction when her soldier sweet
heart is missing in action on what
was to be their wedding night. In
1919, in addition to True Heart
Susie, she appeared in Broken
Blossoms as the waif bullied by
her father and adored by a
lonely Chinese — played by Bar
thelmess. Way Down East came
in 1920, and Orphans of the
Storm in 1921.) This movie cer
tainly doesn't rank among Grif
fith's greatest, but it
demonstrates his gift for infusing
sentimental material with so
much lyricism and emotion that
he transforms it. Even in a slight
romantic comedy like True
Heart Susie, Griffith resists easy
cynicism (and easy categoriza
tion); he was the Dickens of
movies, their greatest popular
artist.
Plays Sunday.
Peyton Place (1957)
Strand, San Francisco
If you're curious about the
forerunners of today's prime
time TV soaps, this slick,
ridiculous movie will tell you
what brand of trash sold tickets
in the '50s. Pre-sold, actually:
Grace Metalious' novel, which
(to quote the ads) "pried the lid
off a New England town," was
such a hot bestseller that every
one wanted to see the film. Un
der the Hays Code restrictions,
of course, the film version tamed
Metalious' sexual expose, and
the result was one of those
plushly romantic Cinemascope
melodramas of the era, starring
(naturally) Lana Turner. The
cast also includes Arthur Ken
nedy, Hope Lange, Lee Philips,
Lloyd Nolan, Diane Varsi, Russ
Tamblyn, Terry Moore, David
Nelson (yes. that David Nelson),
Betty Field. Barry Coe. Mildred
Dunnock, Leon Ames and
Lome Greene — several of
whom actually managed to
garner Oscar nominations (along
with the director, Mark Robson;
the screenwriter, John Michael
Hayes, and the photographer.
William C. Mellor). Franz Wax
man composed the (typically)
string-heavy score.
Plays Tuesday with The Long
Hot Summer.
The Adventures of Robin
Hood (1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
The best way to describe the
experience of seeing this movie,
one of the early Technicolor ad
ventures, is to say that it is to
swashbucklers what The Wizard
of Oz is to musicals. Seton Miller
and Norman Reilly Raine, who
wrote the script, must have been
grinning for weeks, and the plea
sure that the spirited cast takes
in performing it is highly infec
tious. Errol Flynn had his ideal
role in Robin Hood; Olivia De

Havilland, as Maid Marian, is as
beautiful as a fairy tale princess;
Alan Hale plays Little John,
Eugene Pallette is Friar Tuck,
Basil Rathbone is the villainous
Sir Guy of Gisborne, Melville
Cooper is the Sheriff of Notting
ham, Claude Rains is evil
Prince John, lan Hunter is King
Richard, Una O'Connor and
Herbert Mundin are Bess and
Much the Miller. William Keigh
ley initiated the film, but it was
completed by Michael Curtiz.
There are many unforgettable
sequences, but perhaps the best
is the entrance of Robin in the
midst of Prince John's feast with
a stag on his shoulder.
Plays tomorrow through next
Wednesday with Scaramouche.
Foreign Correspondent
(1940)
Telegraph, Berkeley
This wartime espionage thril
ler was one of Alfred
Hitchcock's early American
pictures, and it is one of his most
sheerly enjoyable. The film is so
chock full of suspense sequences
— it is almost a catalogue of
ideas for a spy movie — that it is
endearingly silly. This is the
movie that contains the Tower of
London scene and the windmill
scene, both of which are well
known to Hitchcock fans. Joel
McCrea, an amiable performer
whose talents have been un
derrated, plays the American
hero, and the supporting cast in
cludes Laraine Day, Herbert
Marshall and Edmund Gwenn.
Plays through Tuesday with
The 39 Steps and The Lady
Vanishes.
The Magic Flute (1975)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's
movie of Mozart's last opera
evokes Dickens, sometimes
Shakespeare; sometimes it
parodies operetta conventions,
like Peter Brook's The Beggar's
Opera. The Three Spirits are
Christmas choirboy children
who descend in a balloon and
pelt Pagageno (Hakan
Hagegard, dressed in green, with
a pageboy haircut, so that he
looks like one of Robin Hood's
men) with snowballs to avert
him from suicide. When Tamino
(Josef Kostlinger) plays his flute,
he attracts an audience of
charmingly stylized beasts — a
wide-eyed bear, a mournful lion,
a walrus lying on his back, a trio
of possums hanging upside down
from the flies. Birgit Nordin
plays that imperious
manipulator, the Oueen of the
Night, and Ulrik Cold is a truly
humanistic Sarastro. Bergman
gets amazingly natural perfor
mances from his cast, and the
movie, set in the Drottningholm
Court Theatre in Stockholm, has
so much heart that — coming
after his dreary psychodrama
Scenes from a Marriage — it was
practically a rebirth. (It is also,
by the way, one of the few great
children's movies.) Sven Nykvist
shot it in 16mm for Swedish tele
vision (and it was blown up to
35mm for theatrical release), but
when you see the quality of the
photography you won't believe
it.
Plays tomorrow with From
Mao to Mozart.
The Leopard (1963)
York, San Francisco
In its full-length version (not
shown in this country until
1983), Luchino Visconti's
chronicle of the last days of the
Sicilian aristocracy in the mid

19th century runs three hours
and 25 minutes, and perhaps no
one else in the history of movies
has made so sensuous an epic —
or, until Coppola and The God
father. one so literate and com
plex. (Visconti wrote his own
script, adapting the famous
novel by Giuseppe de Lam
pedusa.) Visconti enables us to
taste the pleasures of the nobility
before a united, bourgeois Italy
alters them forever. In one
scene, Alain Delon, as the das
hing adventurer nephew of the
aging nobleman Don Fabrizio
(Burt Lancaster), returns from
Garibaldi's revolution with some
other young soldiers; the revolu
tionaries are so overwhelmed by
the seductive old world gracious
ness of Fabrizio's home that they
lose their bearings. The title
comes from one of Fabrizio's
lines about the aristocracy: "We
were the leopards, the lions, and
those who replace us will be
jackals, hyenas; and all of us —
leopards, lions, jackals, sheep —
will think we're the salt of the
earth." Burt Lancaster is mag
nificent as the clear-eyed realist
Fabrizio, especially in the last
hour, when the movie cul
minates in a ball — the wedding
of Delon and the bourgeoise
played by Claudia Cardinale
(fiery and vital, she leaves no
doubt in our minds that the
bourgeoisie will survive), which
represents the end of Fabrizio's
world. This superb final hour
recalls the films of Max Ophuls,
but Visconti is as romantic as
Ophuls was baroque.
Photographed by Giuseppe
Rotunno, with a lush, operatic
score by Nino Rota.
Plays tomorrow.
Fame (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A loud, hyperactive musical
that traces the (minimal) prog
ress of a small group of not
especially talented teenagers as
they plough an interminable
route through the High School
of the Performing Arts. It's sen
timental and manipulative in the
Chorus Line style, and wildly
implausible as well. Some of the
scenes are howlers — like one in
which a supposedly street-smart
girl (Irene Cara) allows herself
to be picked up by a porno direc
tor who says he's going to make
her a star. Alan Parker directed,
and le frenetic dance numbers
were choreographed by Louis
Falco. Christopher Gore wrote
the screenplay. With Laura
Dean, Paul McClure, Barry Mil
ler, Maureen Teefy, Anthony
Roy, Jim Moody, Antonia Fran
ceschi and Anne Meara.
Plays Friday with Flashdance.
The (ireat Santini (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The response to this movie
suggests it should be a kind of
Long Day's Journey into Night
for Marine families, but it's
closer to Father Knows Best.
Lewis John Carlino adapted Pat
Conroy's autobiographical novel
about a Marine commander and
his relationship to his wife and
children; it is almost pure
hokum, despite the high quality
of the acting, and the direction
(by Carlino) is drab. Robert
Duvall gives a perfectly
creditable performance as Bull
Meacham, the tyrannical flier,
but it is not as inventive or out
rageous as his Lt. Kilgore in
Apocalypse Now the previous

year. Blythe Danner, as his wife
Lillian, creates a character out of
very little, and young Michael
O'Keefe contributes a very
promising portrayal of their son
Ben. The one-on-one basketball
match between father and son is
far and away the best sequence
in the picture.
Plays Tuesday with Tender
Mercies.
Some Like It Hot (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The setting is first Chicago
and then Miami, in 1929; Jack
Lemmon and Tony Curtis play
two musicians who have the bad
luck to witness the St.
Valentine's Day Massacre and
then must run for their lives. In
order to escape their pursuers,
they don drag and join an all
girls' band, where they — and
we — have the good luck to
encounter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing
"Running Wild," "I Wanna Be
Loved by You" and "I'm
Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous, amateurishly
appealing best in this dizzy farce,
one of the few memorable
comedies of the '50s, and her
two leading men give extremely
skillful performances (especially
Curtis, whose imitation of Cary
Grant in the passive-aggressive
seduction scene is a high point).
Billy Wilder produced, directed
and co-wrote the picture (with
his frequent partner, I.A.L. Dia
mond), and he assembled a witty
supporting cast. George Raft,
Pat O'Brien, George Stone and
Mike Mazurki show up to spoof
roles they played earlier in their
careers, and the woefully un
derrated '30s comic Joe E.
Brown gives his most endearing
performance as millionaire Os
good Fielding, who falls madly in
love with Jack Lemmon and
delivers the most famous curtain
line in movie history.
Plays today with The Seven
Year Itch.
The Thief of Baghdad (1940)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
The hero of this magnificent
Arabian Nights fantasy ad
venture, Prince Ahmed (John
Justin),~has liquid brown eyes
and a light, teasing moustache,
and the villain, the Grand Vizier
Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), stands on
a tower, shrouded in white, his
arms upraised as he invokes the
winds to visit the sea — a great
fairy tale image. Ludwig Berger,
Michael Powell and Tim Whelan
(credited) and producers Alex
ander Korda, Zoltan Korda and
William Cameron Menzies
(uncredited) all had a hand in
the direction, and Miles Mal
leson and Lajos Biro col
laborated on the clumsy, confus
ing screenplay, which you forget
about whenever there's a new
set (Vincent Korda was the
designer) or a new effect. Except
for Conrad Veidt, who is the
soul of malevolence, and Rex In
gram as a djinni with a laugh that
causes tidal waves, the acting is
mostly Grade B, but the movie
has such an amiable spirit and so
many magical sequences (in the
best one, the thief, played by
Sabu, eludes a giant spider on an
immense web) that it transcends
all its shortcomings. Malleson
makes an appearance,
memorably, as the childish Sul
tan, who is addicted to toys, and
June Duprez plays his daughter,
the object of Ahmed's affection.
Plays Friday.

1
Jules and Jim (1962)
Festival, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's film about
the evanescence of love, of
dreams, of innocence; often the
tone is playful, as in Godard's
later Band of Outsiders, which
also spins around the games
shared by two men and a wo
man, but this is a much richer
movie — it has the substance of
a long novel, and its lyricism and
esprit mask a tragedy. Truffaut
and Jean Gruault based the
picture on an autobiographical
novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, a
minor figure from the Paris of
the '20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a
legendary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a woman,
together with all the qualities
one expects in a man, with none
of the inconveniences of either."
The film is a masterpiece — and
likely the best movie released in
the '60s (with the possible ex
ception of L'Avventura).
Plays with Shoot the Piano
Player, beginning next
Thursday.
Shoot the Piano Player (1960)
Festival, Palo Alto
Charles Aznavour plays the
title role in this justly famous
Francois Truffaut tragicomedy,
which he and Marcel Moussy
adapted from a David Goodis
novel. Like Godard in
Breathless, Truffaut takes the
American gangster melodramas
of the '30s and '40s as his start
ing point; what he ends up with
is charming and lyrical and al
together unpredictable. Raoul
Coutard is the photographer,
and of the suppoorting players,
Marie Dubois makes the most
memorable appearance.
Plays with Jules and Jim,
beginning next Thursday.
Diner(l9B2)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Barry Levin
son based this wonderful period
piece, set in 1959, on his own
past, and every detail in it seems
deeply felt. The heroes are a
quintet of men in their early 20s
who gather to celebrate the wed
ding of one of them and to send
off the decade that saw their
adolescence. Levinson under
stands the highly emotionally
charged nature of what we call
"trivia": Pop music is the abso
lute against which these people
measure everything that
transpires in their lives. The act
ing (by Daniel Stern, Steve Gut
tenberg, Mickey Rourke, Kevin
Bacon, Timothy Daly, Ellen
Barkin and others) has the kind
of verisimilitude we usually find
in great documentaries.
Plays next Thursday and
Friday with Footloose.
The Blues Brothers (1980)
Cubberley Auditorium
For some reason, John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
weren't as funny together on
film as they had been when they
tried this routine out on
"Saturday Night Live," but there
are bright moments — like their
rendition of the theme from
"Rawhide" in a country and west
ern bar. This is a genial bad
movie — rather chintzy for the
money spent on it — with some
memorable musical highlights
provided by John Lee Hooker,
Cab Calloway, James Brown and
especially Aretha Franklin,
whose performance of "Think"
is one of the most electrifying
solos ever filmed. It's well worth
the price of admission. Carrie
Fisher has a surprisingly funny
cameo. John Landis directed.
Plays Friday evening at 7 &
9:30.

Peyton Place (1957)
Strand, San Francisco
If you're curious about the
forerunners of today's prime
time TV soaps, this slick,
ridiculous movie will tell you
what brand of trash sold tickets
in the '50s. Pre-sold, actually:
Grace Metalious' novel, which
(to quote the ads) "pried the lid
off a New England town," was
such a hot bestseller that every
one wanted to see the film. Un
der the Hays Code restrictions,
of course, the film version tamed
Metalious' sexual expose, and
the result was one of those
plushly romantic Cinemascope
melodramas of the era, starring
(naturally) Lana Turner. The
cast also includes Arthur Ken
nedy, Hope Lange, Lee Philips,
Lloyd Nolan, Diane Varsi, Russ
Tamblyn, Terry Moore, David
Nelson (yes. that David Nelson),
Betty Field. Barry Coe. Mildred
Dunnock, Leon Ames and
Lome Greene — several of
whom actually managed to

The Adventures of Robin
Hood (1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
The best way to describe the
experience of seeing this movie,
one of the early Technicolor ad
ventures, is to say that it is to
swashbucklers what The Wizard
of Oz is to musicals. Seton Miller
and Norman Reilly Raine, who
wrote the script, must have been
grinning for weeks, and the plea
sure that the spirited cast takes
in performing it is highly infec
tious. Errol Flynn had his ideal
role in Robin Hood; Olivia De

Havilland, as Maid Marian, is as
beautiful as a fairy tale princess;
Alan Hale plays Little John,
Eugene Pallette is Friar Tuck,
Basil Rathbone is the villainous
Sir Guy of Gisborne, Melville
Cooper is the Sheriff of Notting

Prince John, lan Hunter is King
Richard, Una O'Connor and

This wartime espionage thril

chock full of suspense sequences
— it is almost a catalogue of

The Magic Flute (1975)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's
movie of Mozart's last opera
evokes Dickens, sometimes
Shakespeare; sometimes it
parodies operetta conventions,
like Peter Brook's The Beggar's
Opera. The Three Spirits are
Christmas choirboy children
who descend in a balloon and
pelt Pagageno (Hakan
Hagegard, dressed in green, with
a pageboy haircut, so that he
looks like one of Robin Hood's
men) with snowballs to avert
him from suicide. When Tamino
(Josef Kostlinger) plays his flute,
he attracts an audience of
charmingly stylized beasts — a
wide-eyed bear, a mournful lion,
a walrus lying on his back, a trio
of possums hanging upside down
from the flies. Birgit Nordin
plays that imperious
manipulator, the Oueen of the
Night, and Ulrik Cold is a truly
humanistic Sarastro. Bergman
gets amazingly natural perfor
mances from his cast, and the
movie, set in the Drottningholm
Court Theatre in Stockholm, has
so much heart that — coming
after his dreary psychodrama
Scenes from a Marriage — it was
practically a rebirth. (It is also,
by the way, one of the few great
children's movies.) Sven Nykvist
shot it in 16mm for Swedish tele
vision (and it was blown up to
35mm for theatrical release), but
when you see the quality of the
photography you won't believe
it.
Plays tomorrow with From

The Leopard (1963)
York, San Francisco
In its full-length version (not
shown in this country until
1983), Luchino Visconti's
chronicle of the last days of the
Sicilian aristocracy in the mid

19th century runs three hours
and 25 minutes, and perhaps no
one else in the history of movies
has made so sensuous an epic —
or, until Coppola and The God
father. one so literate and com
plex. (Visconti wrote his own
script, adapting the famous
novel by Giuseppe de Lam
pedusa.) Visconti enables us to
taste the pleasures of the nobility
before a united, bourgeois Italy
alters them forever. In one
scene, Alain Delon, as the das
hing adventurer nephew of the
aging nobleman Don Fabrizio
(Burt Lancaster), returns from
Garibaldi's revolution with some
other young soldiers; the revolu
tionaries are so overwhelmed by
the seductive old world gracious
ness of Fabrizio's home that they
lose their bearings. The title
comes from one of Fabrizio's
lines about the aristocracy: "We
were the leopards, the lions, and
those who replace us will be
jackals, hyenas; and all of us —
leopards, lions, jackals, sheep —
will think we're the salt of the
earth." Burt Lancaster is mag
nificent as the clear-eyed realist
Fabrizio, especially in the last
hour, when the movie cul
minates in a ball — the wedding
of Delon and the bourgeoise
played by Claudia Cardinale
(fiery and vital, she leaves no
doubt in our minds that the
bourgeoisie will survive), which
represents the end of Fabrizio's
world. This superb final hour
recalls the films of Max Ophuls,
but Visconti is as romantic as
Ophuls was baroque.
Photographed by Giuseppe
Rotunno, with a lush, operatic
score by Nino Rota.
Plays tomorrow.
Fame (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A loud, hyperactive musical
that traces the (minimal) prog
ress of a small group of not
especially talented teenagers as
they plough an interminable
route through the High School
of the Performing Arts. It's sen
timental and manipulative in the
Chorus Line style, and wildly
implausible as well. Some of the
scenes are howlers — like one in
which a supposedly street-smart
girl (Irene Cara) allows herself
to be picked up by a porno direc

her a star. Alan Parker directed,
and le frenetic dance numbers
were choreographed by Louis

Plays Friday with Flashdance.
The (ireat Santini (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The response to this movie
suggests it should be a kind of
Long Day's Journey into Night
for Marine families, but it's
closer to Father Knows Best.
Lewis John Carlino adapted Pat
Conroy's autobiographical novel
about a Marine commander and
his relationship to his wife and
children; it is almost pure
hokum, despite the high quality
of the acting, and the direction
(by Carlino) is drab. Robert
Duvall gives a perfectly
creditable performance as Bull
Meacham, the tyrannical flier,
but it is not as inventive or out
rageous as his Lt. Kilgore in
Apocalypse Now the previous

year. Blythe Danner, as his wife
Lillian, creates a character out of
very little, and young Michael
O'Keefe contributes a very
promising portrayal of their son
Ben. The one-on-one basketball
match between father and son is
far and away the best sequence
in the picture.
Plays Tuesday with Tender
Mercies.
Some Like It Hot (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The setting is first Chicago
and then Miami, in 1929; Jack
Lemmon and Tony Curtis play
two musicians who have the bad
luck to witness the St.
Valentine's Day Massacre and
then must run for their lives. In
order to escape their pursuers,
they don drag and join an all
girls' band, where they — and
we — have the good luck to
encounter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing
"Running Wild," "I Wanna Be
Loved by You" and "I'm
Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous, amateurishly
appealing best in this dizzy farce,
one of the few memorable
comedies of the '50s, and her
two leading men give extremely
skillful performances (especially
Curtis, whose imitation of Cary
Grant in the passive-aggressive
seduction scene is a high point).
Billy Wilder produced, directed
and co-wrote the picture (with
his frequent partner, I.A.L. Dia
mond), and he assembled a witty
supporting cast. George Raft,
Pat O'Brien, George Stone and
Mike Mazurki show up to spoof
roles they played earlier in their
careers, and the woefully un
derrated '30s comic Joe E.
Brown gives his most endearing
performance as millionaire Os
good Fielding, who falls madly in
love with Jack Lemmon and
delivers the most famous curtain
line in movie history.
Plays today with The Seven
Year Itch.
The Thief of Baghdad (1940)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
The hero of this magnificent
Arabian Nights fantasy ad
venture, Prince Ahmed (John
Justin),~has liquid brown eyes
and a light, teasing moustache,
and the villain, the Grand Vizier
Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), stands on
a tower, shrouded in white, his
arms upraised as he invokes the
winds to visit the sea — a great
fairy tale image. Ludwig Berger,
Michael Powell and Tim Whelan
(credited) and producers Alex
ander Korda, Zoltan Korda and
William Cameron Menzies
(uncredited) all had a hand in
the direction, and Miles Mal
leson and Lajos Biro col
laborated on the clumsy, confus
ing screenplay, which you forget
about whenever there's a new
set (Vincent Korda was the
designer) or a new effect. Except
for Conrad Veidt, who is the
soul of malevolence, and Rex In
gram as a djinni with a laugh that
causes tidal waves, the acting is
mostly Grade B, but the movie
has such an amiable spirit and so
many magical sequences (in the
best one, the thief, played by
Sabu, eludes a giant spider on an
immense web) that it transcends
all its shortcomings. Malleson
makes an appearance,
memorably, as the childish Sul
tan, who is addicted to toys, and
June Duprez plays his daughter,
the object of Ahmed's affection.
Plays Friday.

1
Jules and Jim (1962)
Festival, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's film about
the evanescence of love, of
dreams, of innocence; often the
tone is playful, as in Godard's
later Band of Outsiders, which
also spins around the games
shared by two men and a wo
man, but this is a much richer
movie — it has the substance of
a long novel, and its lyricism and
esprit mask a tragedy. Truffaut
and Jean Gruault based the
picture on an autobiographical
novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, a
minor figure from the Paris of
the '20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a
legendary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a woman,
together with all the qualities
one expects in a man, with none
of the inconveniences of either."
The film is a masterpiece — and
likely the best movie released in
the '60s (with the possible ex
ception of L'Avventura).
Plays with Shoot the Piano
Player, beginning next
Thursday.
Shoot the Piano Player (1960)
Festival, Palo Alto
Charles Aznavour plays the
title role in this justly famous
Francois Truffaut tragicomedy,
which he and Marcel Moussy
adapted from a David Goodis
novel. Like Godard in
Breathless, Truffaut takes the
American gangster melodramas
of the '30s and '40s as his start
ing point; what he ends up with
is charming and lyrical and al
together unpredictable. Raoul
Coutard is the photographer,
and of the suppoorting players,
Marie Dubois makes the most
memorable appearance.
Plays with Jules and Jim,
beginning next Thursday.
Diner(l9B2)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Barry Levin
son based this wonderful period
piece, set in 1959, on his own
past, and every detail in it seems
deeply felt. The heroes are a
quintet of men in their early 20s
who gather to celebrate the wed
ding of one of them and to send
off the decade that saw their
adolescence. Levinson under
stands the highly emotionally
charged nature of what we call
"trivia": Pop music is the abso
lute against which these people
measure everything that
transpires in their lives. The act
ing (by Daniel Stern, Steve Gut
tenberg, Mickey Rourke, Kevin
Bacon, Timothy Daly, Ellen
Barkin and others) has the kind
of verisimilitude we usually find
in great documentaries.
Plays next Thursday and
Friday with Footloose.
The Blues Brothers (1980)
Cubberley Auditorium
For some reason, John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
weren't as funny together on
film as they had been when they
tried this routine out on
"Saturday Night Live," but there
are bright moments — like their
rendition of the theme from
"Rawhide" in a country and west
ern bar. This is a genial bad
movie — rather chintzy for the
money spent on it — with some
memorable musical highlights
provided by John Lee Hooker,
Cab Calloway, James Brown and
especially Aretha Franklin,
whose performance of "Think"
is one of the most electrifying
solos ever filmed. It's well worth
the price of admission. Carrie
Fisher has a surprisingly funny
cameo. John Landis directed.
Plays Friday evening at 7 &
9:30.

The French Connection
(1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
William Friedkin did a neat,
craftsmanlike job of directing
Ernest Tidyman's script (from a
Robin Cook novel) about the
trackdown of a heroin connec
tion in New York and Paris. And
Gene Hackman is excellent as
"Popeye" Doyle, the tough, in
dividualistic cop in charge of the
case. All told, this bloody steam
roller of a thriller is terribly ef
fective — but it's also a highly
unpleasant experience, and
manipulative in a way that raises
moral questions. The supporting
cast features Roy Scheider, Fer
nando Rev and Tony Lo Bianco.
Plays next Wednesday with
Scarface.
Performance (1970)
Bijou, Palo Alto
James Fox and Mick Jagger
play opposite numbers — a
gangster and a rock singer —
who. Persona-like, merge and
switch personalities in this
druggy cult favorite by Nicolas
Roeg (who also photographed)
and Donald Cammell (who
wrote the script). Roeg hadn't
yet acquired his talent for
erotica: The sex scenes, in which
all sorts of combinations are
hinted at, make so little visual
sense that they have a distinctly
soporific effect. Incoherent and
extremely unpleasant, this is a
film that perhaps can only be
comprehended by moviegoers
who see it under the influence of
chemicals but can be detested by
all of us. The only redeeming
few moments are provided by
Jagger, who performs one ter
rific number. Anita Pallenberg
heads an undistinguished sup
porting cast.
Plays Friday with Brimstone
and Treacle.
Morocco (1930)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Cinephiles who take Josef von
Sternberg's American movies
seriously have a lot of explaining
to do when it comes to this one,
which Jules Furthman wrote in a
very light, very silly mood. Mar
lene Dietrich (in her first film in
this country) plays a cabaret
singer who follows her man,
Gary Cooper, a Legionnaire,
into the desert. (She first
removes her high heels.) Terrific
fun.
Plays next Wednesday with
The Lost Honor of Katharina
Blum.
Eboli (1980)
York, San Francisco
In Christ Stopped at Eboli.
Carlo Levi tells of the months he
spent during the mid-1930s in a
remote, backward Italian village
where Mussolini's government
had exiled him for his anti-fascist
sentiments. (A prefatory passage
in Levi's wonderful book,
quoted in the film, explains the
title: "Christ stopped at Eboli
where the road and the railway
abandon . . . Christ never came
this far — nor did time or history
nor hope nor redemption.")
The extraordinary Italian direc
tor Francesco Rosi shaped this
richly suggestive material into
his most masterly film, starring
(in perhaps his best perfor
mance) the remarkable Gian
Maria Volonte, with Irene
Papas, Lea Massari and Alain
Cuny. (This is the uncut, 3'/2-
hour version not originally
released in this country.)
Plays Monday.
The Seven Year Itch (1955)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
George Axelrod's 1953
Broadway comedy about a hap
pily married man who lusts after
Ins upstairs neighbor while his
wife is on vacation had a Walter
Mitty charm: in this misshapen
film version, directed by Billy
Wilder, what had been sweet

and understated became broad
and sniggery. Tom Ewell, who
never could tone down his stage
mannerisms for the camera,
repeats his performance as the
fantasizing husband, but the
movie really focuses on the sexy
neighbor — a roie altered radi
cally to fit Marilyn Monroe.
Axelrod is listed as co
screenwriter (with Wilder), but
he couldn't have been very
happy with the results, which
make his play look so tired and
so foolishly dated that no one
ever considers it for revival now.
(It's a forgotten gem — one of
the few good original American
comedies of the '505.)
Plays today with Some Like It
Hot.
The Lovers (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The love scenes between
Jeanne Moreau and Alain Cuny,
including a celebrated assigna
tion in a rowboat, are among the
most erotic ever filmed, but the
director, Louis Malle, doesn't
seem to have had any other rea
son for making the picture: The
rest of it is rather chilly and for
mal. The Louise de Valmorin
script is an obvious variation on
Madame Bovary, and the role
turned Moreau into a star. In
one of the most breathtaking
compositions (lit by Henri
Decae), she hides in the
shadows, held from behind by
Cuny, her hair and nightgown
billowing in the wind. (The film's
sensibility may cause one to
giggle.)
Plays tomorrow with The Nun.
Effi Briest (1977)
U.C. Theater. Berkeley
Rainer Werner Fassbinder's
most respectable movie (except
perhaps for his lengthy television
adaptation of Berlin Alexan
derplatz) was this rendering of
the Theodor Fontane novel,
starring Hanna Schygulla.
Practically a definition of the art
house film, this carefully
detailed period piece moves so
slowly that you feel as if you're
stuck in an airless compartment
on a broken-down train some
where in the German
countryside: The landscape is
beautiful, but you aren't going
anywhere, and after a while you
can't breathe. The film is well
made, though; it marked one of
Fassbinder's first departures
from the rickety formal ex
perimentation that first won him
the attention of European crit
ics.
Plays Monday with Celeste.
An American Tragedy (1931)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Josef von Sternberg's film of
the Theodore Dreiser novel —
one of the cornerstones of
American naturalism — may
have provoked the earliest con
troversy over the filmmaker's re
sponsibility in adapting material
from another medium: Dreiser
was so incensed with the film
that he picketed it. (Had he lived
to see the second version, A
Place in the Sun. 20 years later,
he would certainly have picketed
it as well, though the director,
George Stevens, distorted the
novel in a different way.)
Dreiser had considerable justifi
cation — Sternberg's film is
glossy melodrama — but you
come away from it with the
image of Sylvia Sidney as the
doomed working-class girl firmly
in your mind. (Sidney was the
great proletarian heroine of
American movies of the Depres

sion.) Phillips Holmes plays the
wide-eyed social climber —
Dreiser's answer to Stendhal's
Julien Sorel — who dumps his
pregnant girlfriend for an aris
tocratic beauty, played by
Frances Dee (who. like Sylvia
Sidney, could act as well as hold
the camera). Lee Garmes super
vised the first-rate cinematog
raphy.
Plays tonight.
True Heart Susie (1919)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
D. W. Griffith's charming pas
toral romance stars Richard Bar
thelmess and the exquisite young
Lillian Gish. (This was her great
Griffith period. In 19 IS she
starred in Hearts of the World as
the young woman driven to dis
traction when her soldier sweet
heart is missing in action on what
was to be their wedding night. In
1919, in addition to True Heart
Susie, she appeared in Broken
Blossoms as the waif bullied by
her father and adored by a
lonely Chinese — played by Bar
thelmess. Way Down East came
in 1920, and Orphans of the
Storm in 1921.) This movie cer
tainly doesn't rank among Grif
fith's greatest, but it
demonstrates his gift for infusing
sentimental material with so
much lyricism and emotion that
he transforms it. Even in a slight
romantic comedy like True
Heart Susie, Griffith resists easy

suggests it should be a kind of
Long Day's Journey into Night
for Marine families, but it's
closer to Father Knows Best.
Lewis John Carlino adapted Pat
Conroy's autobiographical novel
about a Marine commander and
his relationship to his wife and
children; it is almost pure
hokum, despite the high quality
of the acting, and the direction
(by Carlino) is drab. Robert
Duvall gives a perfectly
creditable performance as Bull
Meacham, the tyrannical flier,
but it is not as inventive or out
rageous as his Lt. Kilgore in
Apocalypse Now the previous

year. Blythe Danner, as his wife
Lillian, creates a character out of
very little, and young Michael
O'Keefe contributes a very
promising portrayal of their son
Ben. The one-on-one basketball
match between father and son is
far and away the best sequence
in the picture.
Plays Tuesday with Tender
Mercies.
Some Like It Hot (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The setting is first Chicago
and then Miami, in 1929; Jack
Lemmon and Tony Curtis play
two musicians who have the bad
luck to witness the St.
Valentine's Day Massacre and
then must run for their lives. In
order to escape their pursuers,
they don drag and join an all
girls' band, where they — and
we — have the good luck to
encounter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing
"Running Wild," "I Wanna Be
Loved by You" and "I'm
Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous, amateurishly
appealing best in this dizzy farce,
one of the few memorable
comedies of the '50s, and her
two leading men give extremely
skillful performances (especially
Curtis, whose imitation of Cary
Grant in the passive-aggressive
seduction scene is a high point).
Billy Wilder produced, directed
and co-wrote the picture (with
his frequent partner, I.A.L. Dia
mond), and he assembled a witty
supporting cast. George Raft,
Pat O'Brien, George Stone and
Mike Mazurki show up to spoof
roles they played earlier in their
careers, and the woefully un
derrated '30s comic Joe E.
Brown gives his most endearing
performance as millionaire Os
good Fielding, who falls madly in
love with Jack Lemmon and
delivers the most famous curtain
line in movie history.
Plays today with The Seven
Year Itch.
The Thief of Baghdad (1940)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
The hero of this magnificent
Arabian Nights fantasy ad
venture, Prince Ahmed (John
Justin),~has liquid brown eyes
and a light, teasing moustache,
and the villain, the Grand Vizier
Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), stands on
a tower, shrouded in white, his
arms upraised as he invokes the
winds to visit the sea — a great
fairy tale image. Ludwig Berger,
Michael Powell and Tim Whelan
(credited) and producers Alex
ander Korda, Zoltan Korda and
William Cameron Menzies
(uncredited) all had a hand in
the direction, and Miles Mal
leson and Lajos Biro col
laborated on the clumsy, confus
ing screenplay, which you forget
about whenever there's a new
set (Vincent Korda was the
designer) or a new effect. Except
for Conrad Veidt, who is the
soul of malevolence, and Rex In
gram as a djinni with a laugh that
causes tidal waves, the acting is
mostly Grade B, but the movie
has such an amiable spirit and so
many magical sequences (in the
best one, the thief, played by
Sabu, eludes a giant spider on an
immense web) that it transcends
all its shortcomings. Malleson
makes an appearance,
memorably, as the childish Sul
tan, who is addicted to toys, and
June Duprez plays his daughter,
the object of Ahmed's affection.
Plays Friday.

Jules and Jim (1962)
Festival, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's film about
the evanescence of love, of
dreams, of innocence; often the
tone is playful, as in Godard's
later Band of Outsiders, which
also spins around the games
shared by two men and a wo
man, but this is a much richer
movie — it has the substance of
a long novel, and its lyricism and
esprit mask a tragedy. Truffaut
and Jean Gruault based the
picture on an autobiographical
novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, a
minor figure from the Paris of
the '20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a
legendary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a woman,
together with all the qualities
one expects in a man, with none
of the inconveniences of either."
The film is a masterpiece — and
likely the best movie released in
the '60s (with the possible ex
ception of L'Avventura).

American gangster melodramas

Diner(l9B2)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Barry Levin
son based this wonderful period
piece, set in 1959, on his own
past, and every detail in it seems
deeply felt. The heroes are a
quintet of men in their early 20s
who gather to celebrate the wed
ding of one of them and to send
off the decade that saw their
adolescence. Levinson under
stands the highly emotionally
charged nature of what we call
"trivia": Pop music is the abso
lute against which these people
measure everything that
transpires in their lives. The act
ing (by Daniel Stern, Steve Gut
tenberg, Mickey Rourke, Kevin

of verisimilitude we usually find
in great documentaries.
Plays next Thursday and
Friday with Footloose.
The Blues Brothers (1980)
Cubberley Auditorium
For some reason, John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
weren't as funny together on
film as they had been when they
tried this routine out on
"Saturday Night Live," but there
are bright moments — like their
rendition of the theme from
"Rawhide" in a country and west
ern bar. This is a genial bad
movie — rather chintzy for the
money spent on it — with some
memorable musical highlights
provided by John Lee Hooker,
Cab Calloway, James Brown and
especially Aretha Franklin,
whose performance of "Think"
is one of the most electrifying
solos ever filmed. It's well worth
the price of admission. Carrie
Fisher has a surprisingly funny
cameo. John Landis directed.
Plays Friday evening at 7 &
9:30.

The French Connection
(1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
William Friedkin did a neat,
craftsmanlike job of directing
Ernest Tidyman's script (from a
Robin Cook novel) about the
trackdown of a heroin connec
tion in New York and Paris. And
Gene Hackman is excellent as
"Popeye" Doyle, the tough, in
dividualistic cop in charge of the
case. All told, this bloody steam
roller of a thriller is terribly ef
fective — but it's also a highly
unpleasant experience, and
manipulative in a way that raises
moral questions. The supporting
cast features Roy Scheider, Fer
nando Rev and Tony Lo Bianco.
Plays next Wednesday with
Scarface.
Performance (1970)
Bijou, Palo Alto
James Fox and Mick Jagger
play opposite numbers — a
gangster and a rock singer —
who. Persona-like, merge and
switch personalities in this
druggy cult favorite by Nicolas
Roeg (who also photographed)
and Donald Cammell (who
wrote the script). Roeg hadn't
yet acquired his talent for
erotica: The sex scenes, in which
all sorts of combinations are
hinted at, make so little visual
sense that they have a distinctly
soporific effect. Incoherent and
extremely unpleasant, this is a
film that perhaps can only be
comprehended by moviegoers
who see it under the influence of
chemicals but can be detested by
all of us. The only redeeming
few moments are provided by
Jagger, who performs one ter
rific number. Anita Pallenberg
heads an undistinguished sup
porting cast.
Plays Friday with Brimstone
and Treacle.
Morocco (1930)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Cinephiles who take Josef von
Sternberg's American movies
seriously have a lot of explaining
to do when it comes to this one,
which Jules Furthman wrote in a
very light, very silly mood. Mar
lene Dietrich (in her first film in
this country) plays a cabaret
singer who follows her man,
Gary Cooper, a Legionnaire,
into the desert. (She first
removes her high heels.) Terrific
fun.
Plays next Wednesday with
The Lost Honor of Katharina
Blum.
Eboli (1980)
York, San Francisco
In Christ Stopped at Eboli.
Carlo Levi tells of the months he
spent during the mid-1930s in a
remote, backward Italian village
where Mussolini's government
had exiled him for his anti-fascist
sentiments. (A prefatory passage
in Levi's wonderful book,
quoted in the film, explains the
title: "Christ stopped at Eboli
where the road and the railway
abandon . . . Christ never came
this far — nor did time or history
nor hope nor redemption.")
The extraordinary Italian direc
tor Francesco Rosi shaped this
richly suggestive material into
his most masterly film, starring
(in perhaps his best perfor
mance) the remarkable Gian
Maria Volonte, with Irene
Papas, Lea Massari and Alain
Cuny. (This is the uncut, 3'/2-
hour version not originally
released in this country.)
Plays Monday.
The Seven Year Itch (1955)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
George Axelrod's 1953
Broadway comedy about a hap
pily married man who lusts after
Ins upstairs neighbor while his
wife is on vacation had a Walter
Mitty charm: in this misshapen
film version, directed by Billy
Wilder, what had been sweet

and understated became broad
and sniggery. Tom Ewell, who
never could tone down his stage
mannerisms for the camera,
repeats his performance as the
fantasizing husband, but the
movie really focuses on the sexy
neighbor — a roie altered radi
cally to fit Marilyn Monroe.
Axelrod is listed as co
screenwriter (with Wilder), but
he couldn't have been very
happy with the results, which
make his play look so tired and
so foolishly dated that no one
ever considers it for revival now.
(It's a forgotten gem — one of
the few good original American
comedies of the '505.)
Plays today with Some Like It
Hot.
The Lovers (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The love scenes between
Jeanne Moreau and Alain Cuny,
including a celebrated assigna
tion in a rowboat, are among the
most erotic ever filmed, but the
director, Louis Malle, doesn't
seem to have had any other rea
son for making the picture: The
rest of it is rather chilly and for
mal. The Louise de Valmorin
script is an obvious variation on
Madame Bovary, and the role
turned Moreau into a star. In
one of the most breathtaking
compositions (lit by Henri
Decae), she hides in the
shadows, held from behind by
Cuny, her hair and nightgown
billowing in the wind. (The film's
sensibility may cause one to
giggle.)
Plays tomorrow with The Nun.
Effi Briest (1977)
U.C. Theater. Berkeley
Rainer Werner Fassbinder's
most respectable movie (except
perhaps for his lengthy television
adaptation of Berlin Alexan
derplatz) was this rendering of
the Theodor Fontane novel,
starring Hanna Schygulla.
Practically a definition of the art
house film, this carefully
detailed period piece moves so
slowly that you feel as if you're
stuck in an airless compartment
on a broken-down train some
where in the German
countryside: The landscape is
beautiful, but you aren't going
anywhere, and after a while you
can't breathe. The film is well
made, though; it marked one of
Fassbinder's first departures
from the rickety formal ex
perimentation that first won him
the attention of European crit
ics.
Plays Monday with Celeste.
An American Tragedy (1931)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Josef von Sternberg's film of
the Theodore Dreiser novel —
one of the cornerstones of
American naturalism — may
have provoked the earliest con
troversy over the filmmaker's re
sponsibility in adapting material
from another medium: Dreiser
was so incensed with the film
that he picketed it. (Had he lived
to see the second version, A
Place in the Sun. 20 years later,
he would certainly have picketed
it as well, though the director,
George Stevens, distorted the
novel in a different way.)
Dreiser had considerable justifi
cation — Sternberg's film is
glossy melodrama — but you
come away from it with the
image of Sylvia Sidney as the
doomed working-class girl firmly
in your mind. (Sidney was the
great proletarian heroine of
American movies of the Depres

sion.) Phillips Holmes plays the
wide-eyed social climber —
Dreiser's answer to Stendhal's
Julien Sorel — who dumps his
pregnant girlfriend for an aris
tocratic beauty, played by
Frances Dee (who. like Sylvia
Sidney, could act as well as hold
the camera). Lee Garmes super
vised the first-rate cinematog
raphy.
Plays tonight.
True Heart Susie (1919)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
D. W. Griffith's charming pas
toral romance stars Richard Bar
thelmess and the exquisite young
Lillian Gish. (This was her great
Griffith period. In 19 IS she
starred in Hearts of the World as
the young woman driven to dis
traction when her soldier sweet
heart is missing in action on what
was to be their wedding night. In
1919, in addition to True Heart
Susie, she appeared in Broken
Blossoms as the waif bullied by
her father and adored by a
lonely Chinese — played by Bar
thelmess. Way Down East came
in 1920, and Orphans of the
Storm in 1921.) This movie cer
tainly doesn't rank among Grif
fith's greatest, but it
demonstrates his gift for infusing
sentimental material with so
much lyricism and emotion that
he transforms it. Even in a slight
romantic comedy like True
Heart Susie, Griffith resists easy
cynicism (and easy categoriza
tion); he was the Dickens of
movies, their greatest popular
artist.
Plays Sunday.
Peyton Place (1957)
Strand, San Francisco
If you're curious about the
forerunners of today's prime
time TV soaps, this slick,
ridiculous movie will tell you
what brand of trash sold tickets
in the '50s. Pre-sold, actually:
Grace Metalious' novel, which
(to quote the ads) "pried the lid
off a New England town," was
such a hot bestseller that every
one wanted to see the film. Un
der the Hays Code restrictions,
of course, the film version tamed
Metalious' sexual expose, and
the result was one of those
plushly romantic Cinemascope
melodramas of the era, starring
(naturally) Lana Turner. The
cast also includes Arthur Ken
nedy, Hope Lange, Lee Philips,
Lloyd Nolan, Diane Varsi, Russ
Tamblyn, Terry Moore, David
Nelson (yes. that David Nelson),
Betty Field. Barry Coe. Mildred
Dunnock, Leon Ames and
Lome Greene — several of
whom actually managed to
garner Oscar nominations (along
with the director, Mark Robson;
the screenwriter, John Michael
Hayes, and the photographer.
William C. Mellor). Franz Wax
man composed the (typically)
string-heavy score.
Plays Tuesday with The Long
Hot Summer.
The Adventures of Robin
Hood (1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
The best way to describe the
experience of seeing this movie,
one of the early Technicolor ad
ventures, is to say that it is to
swashbucklers what The Wizard
of Oz is to musicals. Seton Miller
and Norman Reilly Raine, who
wrote the script, must have been
grinning for weeks, and the plea
sure that the spirited cast takes
in performing it is highly infec
tious. Errol Flynn had his ideal
role in Robin Hood; Olivia De

Havilland, as Maid Marian, is as
beautiful as a fairy tale princess;
Alan Hale plays Little John,
Eugene Pallette is Friar Tuck,
Basil Rathbone is the villainous
Sir Guy of Gisborne, Melville
Cooper is the Sheriff of Notting
ham, Claude Rains is evil
Prince John, lan Hunter is King
Richard, Una O'Connor and
Herbert Mundin are Bess and
Much the Miller. William Keigh
ley initiated the film, but it was
completed by Michael Curtiz.
There are many unforgettable
sequences, but perhaps the best
is the entrance of Robin in the
midst of Prince John's feast with
a stag on his shoulder.
Plays tomorrow through next
Wednesday with Scaramouche.
Foreign Correspondent
(1940)
Telegraph, Berkeley
This wartime espionage thril
ler was one of Alfred
Hitchcock's early American
pictures, and it is one of his most
sheerly enjoyable. The film is so
chock full of suspense sequences
— it is almost a catalogue of
ideas for a spy movie — that it is
endearingly silly. This is the
movie that contains the Tower of
London scene and the windmill
scene, both of which are well
known to Hitchcock fans. Joel
McCrea, an amiable performer
whose talents have been un
derrated, plays the American
hero, and the supporting cast in
cludes Laraine Day, Herbert
Marshall and Edmund Gwenn.
Plays through Tuesday with
The 39 Steps and The Lady
Vanishes.
The Magic Flute (1975)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's
movie of Mozart's last opera
evokes Dickens, sometimes
Shakespeare; sometimes it
parodies operetta conventions,
like Peter Brook's The Beggar's
Opera. The Three Spirits are
Christmas choirboy children
who descend in a balloon and
pelt Pagageno (Hakan
Hagegard, dressed in green, with
a pageboy haircut, so that he
looks like one of Robin Hood's
men) with snowballs to avert
him from suicide. When Tamino
(Josef Kostlinger) plays his flute,
he attracts an audience of
charmingly stylized beasts — a
wide-eyed bear, a mournful lion,
a walrus lying on his back, a trio
of possums hanging upside down
from the flies. Birgit Nordin
plays that imperious
manipulator, the Oueen of the
Night, and Ulrik Cold is a truly
humanistic Sarastro. Bergman
gets amazingly natural perfor
mances from his cast, and the
movie, set in the Drottningholm
Court Theatre in Stockholm, has
so much heart that — coming
after his dreary psychodrama
Scenes from a Marriage — it was
practically a rebirth. (It is also,
by the way, one of the few great
children's movies.) Sven Nykvist
shot it in 16mm for Swedish tele
vision (and it was blown up to
35mm for theatrical release), but
when you see the quality of the
photography you won't believe
it.
Plays tomorrow with From
Mao to Mozart.
The Leopard (1963)
York, San Francisco
In its full-length version (not
shown in this country until
1983), Luchino Visconti's
chronicle of the last days of the
Sicilian aristocracy in the mid

19th century runs three hours
and 25 minutes, and perhaps no
one else in the history of movies
has made so sensuous an epic —
or, until Coppola and The God
father. one so literate and com
plex. (Visconti wrote his own
script, adapting the famous
novel by Giuseppe de Lam
pedusa.) Visconti enables us to
taste the pleasures of the nobility
before a united, bourgeois Italy
alters them forever. In one
scene, Alain Delon, as the das
hing adventurer nephew of the
aging nobleman Don Fabrizio
(Burt Lancaster), returns from
Garibaldi's revolution with some
other young soldiers; the revolu
tionaries are so overwhelmed by
the seductive old world gracious
ness of Fabrizio's home that they
lose their bearings. The title
comes from one of Fabrizio's
lines about the aristocracy: "We
were the leopards, the lions, and
those who replace us will be
jackals, hyenas; and all of us —
leopards, lions, jackals, sheep —
will think we're the salt of the
earth." Burt Lancaster is mag
nificent as the clear-eyed realist
Fabrizio, especially in the last
hour, when the movie cul
minates in a ball — the wedding
of Delon and the bourgeoise
played by Claudia Cardinale
(fiery and vital, she leaves no
doubt in our minds that the
bourgeoisie will survive), which
represents the end of Fabrizio's
world. This superb final hour
recalls the films of Max Ophuls,
but Visconti is as romantic as
Ophuls was baroque.
Photographed by Giuseppe
Rotunno, with a lush, operatic
score by Nino Rota.
Plays tomorrow.
Fame (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A loud, hyperactive musical
that traces the (minimal) prog
ress of a small group of not
especially talented teenagers as
they plough an interminable
route through the High School
of the Performing Arts. It's sen
timental and manipulative in the
Chorus Line style, and wildly
implausible as well. Some of the
scenes are howlers — like one in
which a supposedly street-smart
girl (Irene Cara) allows herself
to be picked up by a porno direc
tor who says he's going to make
her a star. Alan Parker directed,
and le frenetic dance numbers
were choreographed by Louis
Falco. Christopher Gore wrote
the screenplay. With Laura
Dean, Paul McClure, Barry Mil

Roy, Jim Moody, Antonia Fran
ceschi and Anne Meara.

James Fox and Mick Jagger
play opposite numbers — a

who. Persona-like, merge and
switch personalities in this
druggy cult favorite by Nicolas
Roeg (who also photographed)

Morocco (1930)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Cinephiles who take Josef von
Sternberg's American movies
seriously have a lot of explaining
to do when it comes to this one,
which Jules Furthman wrote in a
very light, very silly mood. Mar
lene Dietrich (in her first film in
this country) plays a cabaret
singer who follows her man,
Gary Cooper, a Legionnaire,
into the desert. (She first
removes her high heels.) Terrific
fun.
Plays next Wednesday with
The Lost Honor of Katharina

Eboli (1980)
York, San Francisco
In Christ Stopped at Eboli.
Carlo Levi tells of the months he
spent during the mid-1930s in a
remote, backward Italian village
where Mussolini's government
had exiled him for his anti-fascist
sentiments. (A prefatory passage
in Levi's wonderful book,
quoted in the film, explains the
title: "Christ stopped at Eboli
where the road and the railway
abandon . . . Christ never came
this far — nor did time or history
nor hope nor redemption.")
The extraordinary Italian direc
tor Francesco Rosi shaped this
richly suggestive material into
his most masterly film, starring
(in perhaps his best perfor
mance) the remarkable Gian
Maria Volonte, with Irene
Papas, Lea Massari and Alain
Cuny. (This is the uncut, 3'/2-
hour version not originally
released in this country.)
Plays Monday.
The Seven Year Itch (1955)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
George Axelrod's 1953
Broadway comedy about a hap
pily married man who lusts after
Ins upstairs neighbor while his
wife is on vacation had a Walter
Mitty charm: in this misshapen
film version, directed by Billy
Wilder, what had been sweet

and understated became broad
and sniggery. Tom Ewell, who
never could tone down his stage
mannerisms for the camera,
repeats his performance as the
fantasizing husband, but the
movie really focuses on the sexy
neighbor — a roie altered radi
cally to fit Marilyn Monroe.
Axelrod is listed as co
screenwriter (with Wilder), but
he couldn't have been very
happy with the results, which
make his play look so tired and
so foolishly dated that no one
ever considers it for revival now.
(It's a forgotten gem — one of
the few good original American
comedies of the '505.)
Plays today with Some Like It
Hot.
The Lovers (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The love scenes between
Jeanne Moreau and Alain Cuny,
including a celebrated assigna

most erotic ever filmed, but the
director, Louis Malle, doesn't
seem to have had any other rea
son for making the picture: The
rest of it is rather chilly and for
mal. The Louise de Valmorin
script is an obvious variation on
Madame Bovary, and the role
turned Moreau into a star. In
one of the most breathtaking
compositions (lit by Henri
Decae), she hides in the
shadows, held from behind by
Cuny, her hair and nightgown
billowing in the wind. (The film's
sensibility may cause one to
giggle.)
Plays tomorrow with The Nun.
Effi Briest (1977)
U.C. Theater. Berkeley
Rainer Werner Fassbinder's
most respectable movie (except
perhaps for his lengthy television
adaptation of Berlin Alexan
derplatz) was this rendering of
the Theodor Fontane novel,
starring Hanna Schygulla.
Practically a definition of the art
house film, this carefully
detailed period piece moves so
slowly that you feel as if you're
stuck in an airless compartment
on a broken-down train some
where in the German
countryside: The landscape is
beautiful, but you aren't going
anywhere, and after a while you
can't breathe. The film is well
made, though; it marked one of
Fassbinder's first departures
from the rickety formal ex
perimentation that first won him
the attention of European crit
ics.
Plays Monday with Celeste.
An American Tragedy (1931)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Josef von Sternberg's film of
the Theodore Dreiser novel —
one of the cornerstones of
American naturalism — may
have provoked the earliest con
troversy over the filmmaker's re
sponsibility in adapting material
from another medium: Dreiser
was so incensed with the film
that he picketed it. (Had he lived
to see the second version, A
Place in the Sun. 20 years later,
he would certainly have picketed
it as well, though the director,
George Stevens, distorted the
novel in a different way.)
Dreiser had considerable justifi
cation — Sternberg's film is
glossy melodrama — but you
come away from it with the
image of Sylvia Sidney as the
doomed working-class girl firmly
in your mind. (Sidney was the
great proletarian heroine of
American movies of the Depres

sion.) Phillips Holmes plays the
wide-eyed social climber —
Dreiser's answer to Stendhal's
Julien Sorel — who dumps his
pregnant girlfriend for an aris
tocratic beauty, played by
Frances Dee (who. like Sylvia
Sidney, could act as well as hold
the camera). Lee Garmes super
vised the first-rate cinematog
raphy.
Plays tonight.
True Heart Susie (1919)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
D. W. Griffith's charming pas
toral romance stars Richard Bar
thelmess and the exquisite young
Lillian Gish. (This was her great
Griffith period. In 19 IS she
starred in Hearts of the World as
the young woman driven to dis
traction when her soldier sweet
heart is missing in action on what
was to be their wedding night. In
1919, in addition to True Heart
Susie, she appeared in Broken
Blossoms as the waif bullied by
her father and adored by a
lonely Chinese — played by Bar
thelmess. Way Down East came
in 1920, and Orphans of the
Storm in 1921.) This movie cer
tainly doesn't rank among Grif
fith's greatest, but it
demonstrates his gift for infusing
sentimental material with so
much lyricism and emotion that
he transforms it. Even in a slight
romantic comedy like True
Heart Susie, Griffith resists easy
cynicism (and easy categoriza
tion); he was the Dickens of
movies, their greatest popular
artist.
Plays Sunday.
Peyton Place (1957)
Strand, San Francisco
If you're curious about the
forerunners of today's prime
time TV soaps, this slick,
ridiculous movie will tell you
what brand of trash sold tickets
in the '50s. Pre-sold, actually:
Grace Metalious' novel, which
(to quote the ads) "pried the lid
off a New England town," was
such a hot bestseller that every
one wanted to see the film. Un
der the Hays Code restrictions,
of course, the film version tamed
Metalious' sexual expose, and
the result was one of those
plushly romantic Cinemascope
melodramas of the era, starring
(naturally) Lana Turner. The
cast also includes Arthur Ken
nedy, Hope Lange, Lee Philips,
Lloyd Nolan, Diane Varsi, Russ
Tamblyn, Terry Moore, David
Nelson (yes. that David Nelson),
Betty Field. Barry Coe. Mildred
Dunnock, Leon Ames and
Lome Greene — several of
whom actually managed to
garner Oscar nominations (along
with the director, Mark Robson;
the screenwriter, John Michael
Hayes, and the photographer.
William C. Mellor). Franz Wax
man composed the (typically)
string-heavy score.
Plays Tuesday with The Long
Hot Summer.
The Adventures of Robin
Hood (1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
The best way to describe the
experience of seeing this movie,
one of the early Technicolor ad
ventures, is to say that it is to
swashbucklers what The Wizard
of Oz is to musicals. Seton Miller
and Norman Reilly Raine, who
wrote the script, must have been
grinning for weeks, and the plea
sure that the spirited cast takes
in performing it is highly infec
tious. Errol Flynn had his ideal
role in Robin Hood; Olivia De

Havilland, as Maid Marian, is as
beautiful as a fairy tale princess;
Alan Hale plays Little John,
Eugene Pallette is Friar Tuck,
Basil Rathbone is the villainous
Sir Guy of Gisborne, Melville
Cooper is the Sheriff of Notting
ham, Claude Rains is evil
Prince John, lan Hunter is King
Richard, Una O'Connor and
Herbert Mundin are Bess and
Much the Miller. William Keigh
ley initiated the film, but it was
completed by Michael Curtiz.
There are many unforgettable
sequences, but perhaps the best
is the entrance of Robin in the
midst of Prince John's feast with
a stag on his shoulder.
Plays tomorrow through next
Wednesday with Scaramouche.
Foreign Correspondent
(1940)
Telegraph, Berkeley
This wartime espionage thril
ler was one of Alfred
Hitchcock's early American
pictures, and it is one of his most
sheerly enjoyable. The film is so
chock full of suspense sequences
— it is almost a catalogue of
ideas for a spy movie — that it is
endearingly silly. This is the
movie that contains the Tower of
London scene and the windmill
scene, both of which are well
known to Hitchcock fans. Joel
McCrea, an amiable performer
whose talents have been un
derrated, plays the American
hero, and the supporting cast in
cludes Laraine Day, Herbert
Marshall and Edmund Gwenn.
Plays through Tuesday with
The 39 Steps and The Lady
Vanishes.
The Magic Flute (1975)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's
movie of Mozart's last opera
evokes Dickens, sometimes
Shakespeare; sometimes it
parodies operetta conventions,
like Peter Brook's The Beggar's
Opera. The Three Spirits are
Christmas choirboy children
who descend in a balloon and
pelt Pagageno (Hakan
Hagegard, dressed in green, with
a pageboy haircut, so that he
looks like one of Robin Hood's
men) with snowballs to avert
him from suicide. When Tamino
(Josef Kostlinger) plays his flute,
he attracts an audience of
charmingly stylized beasts — a
wide-eyed bear, a mournful lion,
a walrus lying on his back, a trio
of possums hanging upside down
from the flies. Birgit Nordin
plays that imperious
manipulator, the Oueen of the
Night, and Ulrik Cold is a truly
humanistic Sarastro. Bergman
gets amazingly natural perfor
mances from his cast, and the
movie, set in the Drottningholm
Court Theatre in Stockholm, has
so much heart that — coming
after his dreary psychodrama
Scenes from a Marriage — it was
practically a rebirth. (It is also,
by the way, one of the few great
children's movies.) Sven Nykvist
shot it in 16mm for Swedish tele
vision (and it was blown up to
35mm for theatrical release), but
when you see the quality of the
photography you won't believe
it.
Plays tomorrow with From
Mao to Mozart.
The Leopard (1963)
York, San Francisco
In its full-length version (not
shown in this country until
1983), Luchino Visconti's
chronicle of the last days of the
Sicilian aristocracy in the mid

19th century runs three hours
and 25 minutes, and perhaps no
one else in the history of movies
has made so sensuous an epic —
or, until Coppola and The God
father. one so literate and com
plex. (Visconti wrote his own
script, adapting the famous
novel by Giuseppe de Lam
pedusa.) Visconti enables us to
taste the pleasures of the nobility
before a united, bourgeois Italy
alters them forever. In one
scene, Alain Delon, as the das
hing adventurer nephew of the
aging nobleman Don Fabrizio
(Burt Lancaster), returns from
Garibaldi's revolution with some
other young soldiers; the revolu
tionaries are so overwhelmed by
the seductive old world gracious
ness of Fabrizio's home that they
lose their bearings. The title
comes from one of Fabrizio's
lines about the aristocracy: "We
were the leopards, the lions, and
those who replace us will be
jackals, hyenas; and all of us —
leopards, lions, jackals, sheep —
will think we're the salt of the
earth." Burt Lancaster is mag
nificent as the clear-eyed realist
Fabrizio, especially in the last
hour, when the movie cul
minates in a ball — the wedding
of Delon and the bourgeoise
played by Claudia Cardinale
(fiery and vital, she leaves no
doubt in our minds that the
bourgeoisie will survive), which
represents the end of Fabrizio's
world. This superb final hour
recalls the films of Max Ophuls,
but Visconti is as romantic as
Ophuls was baroque.
Photographed by Giuseppe
Rotunno, with a lush, operatic
score by Nino Rota.
Plays tomorrow.
Fame (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A loud, hyperactive musical
that traces the (minimal) prog
ress of a small group of not
especially talented teenagers as
they plough an interminable
route through the High School
of the Performing Arts. It's sen
timental and manipulative in the
Chorus Line style, and wildly
implausible as well. Some of the
scenes are howlers — like one in
which a supposedly street-smart
girl (Irene Cara) allows herself
to be picked up by a porno direc
tor who says he's going to make
her a star. Alan Parker directed,
and le frenetic dance numbers
were choreographed by Louis
Falco. Christopher Gore wrote
the screenplay. With Laura
Dean, Paul McClure, Barry Mil
ler, Maureen Teefy, Anthony
Roy, Jim Moody, Antonia Fran
ceschi and Anne Meara.
Plays Friday with Flashdance.
The (ireat Santini (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The response to this movie
suggests it should be a kind of
Long Day's Journey into Night
for Marine families, but it's
closer to Father Knows Best.
Lewis John Carlino adapted Pat
Conroy's autobiographical novel
about a Marine commander and
his relationship to his wife and
children; it is almost pure
hokum, despite the high quality
of the acting, and the direction
(by Carlino) is drab. Robert
Duvall gives a perfectly
creditable performance as Bull
Meacham, the tyrannical flier,
but it is not as inventive or out
rageous as his Lt. Kilgore in
Apocalypse Now the previous

year. Blythe Danner, as his wife
Lillian, creates a character out of
very little, and young Michael
O'Keefe contributes a very
promising portrayal of their son
Ben. The one-on-one basketball
match between father and son is
far and away the best sequence
in the picture.
Plays Tuesday with Tender
Mercies.
Some Like It Hot (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The setting is first Chicago
and then Miami, in 1929; Jack
Lemmon and Tony Curtis play
two musicians who have the bad
luck to witness the St.
Valentine's Day Massacre and
then must run for their lives. In
order to escape their pursuers,
they don drag and join an all
girls' band, where they — and
we — have the good luck to
encounter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing
"Running Wild," "I Wanna Be
Loved by You" and "I'm
Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous, amateurishly
appealing best in this dizzy farce,
one of the few memorable
comedies of the '50s, and her
two leading men give extremely
skillful performances (especially
Curtis, whose imitation of Cary
Grant in the passive-aggressive
seduction scene is a high point).
Billy Wilder produced, directed
and co-wrote the picture (with
his frequent partner, I.A.L. Dia
mond), and he assembled a witty
supporting cast. George Raft,
Pat O'Brien, George Stone and
Mike Mazurki show up to spoof
roles they played earlier in their
careers, and the woefully un
derrated '30s comic Joe E.
Brown gives his most endearing
performance as millionaire Os
good Fielding, who falls madly in
love with Jack Lemmon and
delivers the most famous curtain
line in movie history.
Plays today with The Seven
Year Itch.
The Thief of Baghdad (1940)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
The hero of this magnificent
Arabian Nights fantasy ad
venture, Prince Ahmed (John
Justin),~has liquid brown eyes
and a light, teasing moustache,
and the villain, the Grand Vizier
Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), stands on
a tower, shrouded in white, his
arms upraised as he invokes the
winds to visit the sea — a great
fairy tale image. Ludwig Berger,
Michael Powell and Tim Whelan
(credited) and producers Alex
ander Korda, Zoltan Korda and
William Cameron Menzies
(uncredited) all had a hand in
the direction, and Miles Mal
leson and Lajos Biro col
laborated on the clumsy, confus
ing screenplay, which you forget
about whenever there's a new
set (Vincent Korda was the
designer) or a new effect. Except
for Conrad Veidt, who is the
soul of malevolence, and Rex In
gram as a djinni with a laugh that
causes tidal waves, the acting is
mostly Grade B, but the movie
has such an amiable spirit and so
many magical sequences (in the
best one, the thief, played by
Sabu, eludes a giant spider on an
immense web) that it transcends
all its shortcomings. Malleson
makes an appearance,
memorably, as the childish Sul
tan, who is addicted to toys, and
June Duprez plays his daughter,
the object of Ahmed's affection.
Plays Friday.

1
Jules and Jim (1962)
Festival, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's film about
the evanescence of love, of
dreams, of innocence; often the
tone is playful, as in Godard's
later Band of Outsiders, which
also spins around the games
shared by two men and a wo
man, but this is a much richer
movie — it has the substance of
a long novel, and its lyricism and
esprit mask a tragedy. Truffaut
and Jean Gruault based the
picture on an autobiographical
novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, a
minor figure from the Paris of
the '20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a
legendary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a woman,
together with all the qualities
one expects in a man, with none
of the inconveniences of either."
The film is a masterpiece — and
likely the best movie released in
the '60s (with the possible ex
ception of L'Avventura).
Plays with Shoot the Piano
Player, beginning next
Thursday.
Shoot the Piano Player (1960)
Festival, Palo Alto
Charles Aznavour plays the
title role in this justly famous
Francois Truffaut tragicomedy,
which he and Marcel Moussy
adapted from a David Goodis
novel. Like Godard in
Breathless, Truffaut takes the
American gangster melodramas
of the '30s and '40s as his start
ing point; what he ends up with
is charming and lyrical and al
together unpredictable. Raoul
Coutard is the photographer,
and of the suppoorting players,
Marie Dubois makes the most
memorable appearance.
Plays with Jules and Jim,
beginning next Thursday.
Diner(l9B2)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Barry Levin
son based this wonderful period
piece, set in 1959, on his own
past, and every detail in it seems
deeply felt. The heroes are a
quintet of men in their early 20s
who gather to celebrate the wed
ding of one of them and to send
off the decade that saw their
adolescence. Levinson under
stands the highly emotionally
charged nature of what we call
"trivia": Pop music is the abso
lute against which these people
measure everything that
transpires in their lives. The act
ing (by Daniel Stern, Steve Gut
tenberg, Mickey Rourke, Kevin
Bacon, Timothy Daly, Ellen
Barkin and others) has the kind
of verisimilitude we usually find
in great documentaries.
Plays next Thursday and
Friday with Footloose.
The Blues Brothers (1980)
Cubberley Auditorium
For some reason, John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
weren't as funny together on
film as they had been when they
tried this routine out on
"Saturday Night Live," but there
are bright moments — like their
rendition of the theme from
"Rawhide" in a country and west
ern bar. This is a genial bad
movie — rather chintzy for the
money spent on it — with some
memorable musical highlights
provided by John Lee Hooker,
Cab Calloway, James Brown and
especially Aretha Franklin,
whose performance of "Think"
is one of the most electrifying
solos ever filmed. It's well worth
the price of admission. Carrie
Fisher has a surprisingly funny
cameo. John Landis directed.
Plays Friday evening at 7 &
9:30.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
William Friedkin did a neat,
craftsmanlike job of directing
Ernest Tidyman's script (from a
Robin Cook novel) about the
trackdown of a heroin connec
tion in New York and Paris. And
Gene Hackman is excellent as
"Popeye" Doyle, the tough, in
dividualistic cop in charge of the
case. All told, this bloody steam
roller of a thriller is terribly ef

The Adventures of Robin
Hood (1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
The best way to describe the
experience of seeing this movie,
one of the early Technicolor ad
ventures, is to say that it is to
swashbucklers what The Wizard
of Oz is to musicals. Seton Miller
and Norman Reilly Raine, who
wrote the script, must have been
grinning for weeks, and the plea
sure that the spirited cast takes
in performing it is highly infec

role in Robin Hood; Olivia De

Havilland, as Maid Marian, is as
beautiful as a fairy tale princess;
Alan Hale plays Little John,
Eugene Pallette is Friar Tuck,
Basil Rathbone is the villainous
Sir Guy of Gisborne, Melville
Cooper is the Sheriff of Notting

Prince John, lan Hunter is King
Richard, Una O'Connor and
Herbert Mundin are Bess and
Much the Miller. William Keigh

There are many unforgettable

This wartime espionage thril
ler was one of Alfred
Hitchcock's early American
pictures, and it is one of his most
sheerly enjoyable. The film is so
chock full of suspense sequences
— it is almost a catalogue of
ideas for a spy movie — that it is
endearingly silly. This is the
movie that contains the Tower of
London scene and the windmill
scene, both of which are well
known to Hitchcock fans. Joel

The Magic Flute (1975)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's
movie of Mozart's last opera
evokes Dickens, sometimes
Shakespeare; sometimes it
parodies operetta conventions,
like Peter Brook's The Beggar's
Opera. The Three Spirits are
Christmas choirboy children
who descend in a balloon and
pelt Pagageno (Hakan
Hagegard, dressed in green, with
a pageboy haircut, so that he
looks like one of Robin Hood's
men) with snowballs to avert
him from suicide. When Tamino
(Josef Kostlinger) plays his flute,
he attracts an audience of
charmingly stylized beasts — a
wide-eyed bear, a mournful lion,
a walrus lying on his back, a trio
of possums hanging upside down
from the flies. Birgit Nordin
plays that imperious
manipulator, the Oueen of the
Night, and Ulrik Cold is a truly
humanistic Sarastro. Bergman
gets amazingly natural perfor
mances from his cast, and the
movie, set in the Drottningholm
Court Theatre in Stockholm, has
so much heart that — coming
after his dreary psychodrama
Scenes from a Marriage — it was
practically a rebirth. (It is also,
by the way, one of the few great
children's movies.) Sven Nykvist
shot it in 16mm for Swedish tele
vision (and it was blown up to
35mm for theatrical release), but
when you see the quality of the
photography you won't believe
it.
Plays tomorrow with From
Mao to Mozart.
The Leopard (1963)
York, San Francisco
In its full-length version (not
shown in this country until
1983), Luchino Visconti's
chronicle of the last days of the
Sicilian aristocracy in the mid

19th century runs three hours
and 25 minutes, and perhaps no
one else in the history of movies
has made so sensuous an epic —
or, until Coppola and The God
father. one so literate and com
plex. (Visconti wrote his own
script, adapting the famous
novel by Giuseppe de Lam
pedusa.) Visconti enables us to
taste the pleasures of the nobility
before a united, bourgeois Italy
alters them forever. In one
scene, Alain Delon, as the das
hing adventurer nephew of the
aging nobleman Don Fabrizio
(Burt Lancaster), returns from
Garibaldi's revolution with some
other young soldiers; the revolu
tionaries are so overwhelmed by
the seductive old world gracious
ness of Fabrizio's home that they
lose their bearings. The title
comes from one of Fabrizio's
lines about the aristocracy: "We
were the leopards, the lions, and
those who replace us will be
jackals, hyenas; and all of us —
leopards, lions, jackals, sheep —
will think we're the salt of the
earth." Burt Lancaster is mag
nificent as the clear-eyed realist
Fabrizio, especially in the last
hour, when the movie cul
minates in a ball — the wedding
of Delon and the bourgeoise
played by Claudia Cardinale
(fiery and vital, she leaves no
doubt in our minds that the
bourgeoisie will survive), which
represents the end of Fabrizio's
world. This superb final hour
recalls the films of Max Ophuls,
but Visconti is as romantic as
Ophuls was baroque.
Photographed by Giuseppe
Rotunno, with a lush, operatic
score by Nino Rota.
Plays tomorrow.
Fame (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A loud, hyperactive musical
that traces the (minimal) prog
ress of a small group of not
especially talented teenagers as
they plough an interminable
route through the High School
of the Performing Arts. It's sen
timental and manipulative in the
Chorus Line style, and wildly
implausible as well. Some of the
scenes are howlers — like one in
which a supposedly street-smart
girl (Irene Cara) allows herself
to be picked up by a porno direc
tor who says he's going to make
her a star. Alan Parker directed,
and le frenetic dance numbers
were choreographed by Louis
Falco. Christopher Gore wrote
the screenplay. With Laura
Dean, Paul McClure, Barry Mil

Roy, Jim Moody, Antonia Fran
ceschi and Anne Meara.
Plays Friday with Flashdance.
The (ireat Santini (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The response to this movie
suggests it should be a kind of
Long Day's Journey into Night
for Marine families, but it's
closer to Father Knows Best.
Lewis John Carlino adapted Pat
Conroy's autobiographical novel
about a Marine commander and
his relationship to his wife and
children; it is almost pure
hokum, despite the high quality
of the acting, and the direction
(by Carlino) is drab. Robert
Duvall gives a perfectly
creditable performance as Bull
Meacham, the tyrannical flier,
but it is not as inventive or out
rageous as his Lt. Kilgore in
Apocalypse Now the previous

year. Blythe Danner, as his wife
Lillian, creates a character out of
very little, and young Michael
O'Keefe contributes a very
promising portrayal of their son
Ben. The one-on-one basketball
match between father and son is
far and away the best sequence
in the picture.
Plays Tuesday with Tender
Mercies.
Some Like It Hot (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The setting is first Chicago
and then Miami, in 1929; Jack
Lemmon and Tony Curtis play
two musicians who have the bad
luck to witness the St.
Valentine's Day Massacre and
then must run for their lives. In
order to escape their pursuers,
they don drag and join an all
girls' band, where they — and
we — have the good luck to
encounter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing
"Running Wild," "I Wanna Be
Loved by You" and "I'm
Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous, amateurishly
appealing best in this dizzy farce,
one of the few memorable
comedies of the '50s, and her
two leading men give extremely
skillful performances (especially
Curtis, whose imitation of Cary
Grant in the passive-aggressive
seduction scene is a high point).
Billy Wilder produced, directed
and co-wrote the picture (with
his frequent partner, I.A.L. Dia
mond), and he assembled a witty
supporting cast. George Raft,
Pat O'Brien, George Stone and
Mike Mazurki show up to spoof
roles they played earlier in their
careers, and the woefully un
derrated '30s comic Joe E.
Brown gives his most endearing
performance as millionaire Os
good Fielding, who falls madly in
love with Jack Lemmon and
delivers the most famous curtain
line in movie history.
Plays today with The Seven
Year Itch.
The Thief of Baghdad (1940)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
The hero of this magnificent
Arabian Nights fantasy ad
venture, Prince Ahmed (John
Justin),~has liquid brown eyes
and a light, teasing moustache,
and the villain, the Grand Vizier
Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), stands on
a tower, shrouded in white, his
arms upraised as he invokes the
winds to visit the sea — a great
fairy tale image. Ludwig Berger,
Michael Powell and Tim Whelan
(credited) and producers Alex
ander Korda, Zoltan Korda and
William Cameron Menzies
(uncredited) all had a hand in
the direction, and Miles Mal
leson and Lajos Biro col
laborated on the clumsy, confus
ing screenplay, which you forget
about whenever there's a new
set (Vincent Korda was the
designer) or a new effect. Except
for Conrad Veidt, who is the
soul of malevolence, and Rex In
gram as a djinni with a laugh that
causes tidal waves, the acting is
mostly Grade B, but the movie
has such an amiable spirit and so
many magical sequences (in the
best one, the thief, played by
Sabu, eludes a giant spider on an
immense web) that it transcends
all its shortcomings. Malleson
makes an appearance,
memorably, as the childish Sul
tan, who is addicted to toys, and
June Duprez plays his daughter,
the object of Ahmed's affection.
Plays Friday.

1
Jules and Jim (1962)
Festival, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's film about
the evanescence of love, of
dreams, of innocence; often the
tone is playful, as in Godard's
later Band of Outsiders, which
also spins around the games
shared by two men and a wo
man, but this is a much richer
movie — it has the substance of
a long novel, and its lyricism and
esprit mask a tragedy. Truffaut
and Jean Gruault based the
picture on an autobiographical
novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, a
minor figure from the Paris of
the '20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a
legendary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a woman,
together with all the qualities
one expects in a man, with none
of the inconveniences of either."
The film is a masterpiece — and
likely the best movie released in
the '60s (with the possible ex
ception of L'Avventura).
Plays with Shoot the Piano
Player, beginning next
Thursday.
Shoot the Piano Player (1960)
Festival, Palo Alto
Charles Aznavour plays the
title role in this justly famous
Francois Truffaut tragicomedy,
which he and Marcel Moussy
adapted from a David Goodis
novel. Like Godard in
Breathless, Truffaut takes the
American gangster melodramas
of the '30s and '40s as his start
ing point; what he ends up with
is charming and lyrical and al
together unpredictable. Raoul
Coutard is the photographer,
and of the suppoorting players,
Marie Dubois makes the most
memorable appearance.
Plays with Jules and Jim,
beginning next Thursday.
Diner(l9B2)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Barry Levin
son based this wonderful period
piece, set in 1959, on his own
past, and every detail in it seems
deeply felt. The heroes are a
quintet of men in their early 20s
who gather to celebrate the wed
ding of one of them and to send
off the decade that saw their
adolescence. Levinson under
stands the highly emotionally
charged nature of what we call
"trivia": Pop music is the abso
lute against which these people
measure everything that
transpires in their lives. The act
ing (by Daniel Stern, Steve Gut
tenberg, Mickey Rourke, Kevin
Bacon, Timothy Daly, Ellen
Barkin and others) has the kind
of verisimilitude we usually find
in great documentaries.
Plays next Thursday and
Friday with Footloose.
The Blues Brothers (1980)
Cubberley Auditorium
For some reason, John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
weren't as funny together on
film as they had been when they
tried this routine out on
"Saturday Night Live," but there
are bright moments — like their
rendition of the theme from
"Rawhide" in a country and west
ern bar. This is a genial bad
movie — rather chintzy for the
money spent on it — with some
memorable musical highlights
provided by John Lee Hooker,
Cab Calloway, James Brown and
especially Aretha Franklin,
whose performance of "Think"
is one of the most electrifying
solos ever filmed. It's well worth
the price of admission. Carrie
Fisher has a surprisingly funny
cameo. John Landis directed.
Plays Friday evening at 7 &
9:30.

The French Connection
(1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
William Friedkin did a neat,
craftsmanlike job of directing
Ernest Tidyman's script (from a
Robin Cook novel) about the
trackdown of a heroin connec
tion in New York and Paris. And
Gene Hackman is excellent as
"Popeye" Doyle, the tough, in
dividualistic cop in charge of the
case. All told, this bloody steam
roller of a thriller is terribly ef
fective — but it's also a highly
unpleasant experience, and
manipulative in a way that raises
moral questions. The supporting
cast features Roy Scheider, Fer
nando Rev and Tony Lo Bianco.
Plays next Wednesday with
Scarface.
Performance (1970)
Bijou, Palo Alto
James Fox and Mick Jagger
play opposite numbers — a
gangster and a rock singer —
who. Persona-like, merge and
switch personalities in this
druggy cult favorite by Nicolas
Roeg (who also photographed)
and Donald Cammell (who
wrote the script). Roeg hadn't
yet acquired his talent for
erotica: The sex scenes, in which
all sorts of combinations are
hinted at, make so little visual
sense that they have a distinctly
soporific effect. Incoherent and
extremely unpleasant, this is a
film that perhaps can only be
comprehended by moviegoers
who see it under the influence of
chemicals but can be detested by
all of us. The only redeeming
few moments are provided by
Jagger, who performs one ter
rific number. Anita Pallenberg
heads an undistinguished sup
porting cast.
Plays Friday with Brimstone
and Treacle.
Morocco (1930)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Cinephiles who take Josef von
Sternberg's American movies
seriously have a lot of explaining
to do when it comes to this one,
which Jules Furthman wrote in a
very light, very silly mood. Mar
lene Dietrich (in her first film in
this country) plays a cabaret
singer who follows her man,
Gary Cooper, a Legionnaire,
into the desert. (She first
removes her high heels.) Terrific
fun.
Plays next Wednesday with
The Lost Honor of Katharina
Blum.
Eboli (1980)
York, San Francisco
In Christ Stopped at Eboli.
Carlo Levi tells of the months he
spent during the mid-1930s in a
remote, backward Italian village
where Mussolini's government
had exiled him for his anti-fascist
sentiments. (A prefatory passage
in Levi's wonderful book,
quoted in the film, explains the
title: "Christ stopped at Eboli
where the road and the railway
abandon . . . Christ never came
this far — nor did time or history
nor hope nor redemption.")
The extraordinary Italian direc
tor Francesco Rosi shaped this
richly suggestive material into
his most masterly film, starring
(in perhaps his best perfor
mance) the remarkable Gian
Maria Volonte, with Irene
Papas, Lea Massari and Alain
Cuny. (This is the uncut, 3'/2-
hour version not originally
released in this country.)
Plays Monday.
The Seven Year Itch (1955)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
George Axelrod's 1953
Broadway comedy about a hap
pily married man who lusts after
Ins upstairs neighbor while his
wife is on vacation had a Walter
Mitty charm: in this misshapen
film version, directed by Billy
Wilder, what had been sweet

and understated became broad
and sniggery. Tom Ewell, who
never could tone down his stage
mannerisms for the camera,
repeats his performance as the
fantasizing husband, but the
movie really focuses on the sexy
neighbor — a roie altered radi
cally to fit Marilyn Monroe.
Axelrod is listed as co
screenwriter (with Wilder), but
he couldn't have been very
happy with the results, which
make his play look so tired and
so foolishly dated that no one
ever considers it for revival now.
(It's a forgotten gem — one of
the few good original American
comedies of the '505.)
Plays today with Some Like It
Hot.
The Lovers (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The love scenes between
Jeanne Moreau and Alain Cuny,
including a celebrated assigna
tion in a rowboat, are among the
most erotic ever filmed, but the
director, Louis Malle, doesn't
seem to have had any other rea
son for making the picture: The
rest of it is rather chilly and for
mal. The Louise de Valmorin
script is an obvious variation on
Madame Bovary, and the role
turned Moreau into a star. In
one of the most breathtaking
compositions (lit by Henri
Decae), she hides in the
shadows, held from behind by
Cuny, her hair and nightgown
billowing in the wind. (The film's
sensibility may cause one to
giggle.)
Plays tomorrow with The Nun.
Effi Briest (1977)
U.C. Theater. Berkeley
Rainer Werner Fassbinder's
most respectable movie (except
perhaps for his lengthy television
adaptation of Berlin Alexan
derplatz) was this rendering of
the Theodor Fontane novel,
starring Hanna Schygulla.
Practically a definition of the art
house film, this carefully
detailed period piece moves so
slowly that you feel as if you're
stuck in an airless compartment
on a broken-down train some
where in the German
countryside: The landscape is
beautiful, but you aren't going
anywhere, and after a while you
can't breathe. The film is well
made, though; it marked one of
Fassbinder's first departures
from the rickety formal ex
perimentation that first won him
the attention of European crit
ics.
Plays Monday with Celeste.
An American Tragedy (1931)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Josef von Sternberg's film of
the Theodore Dreiser novel —
one of the cornerstones of
American naturalism — may
have provoked the earliest con
troversy over the filmmaker's re
sponsibility in adapting material
from another medium: Dreiser
was so incensed with the film
that he picketed it. (Had he lived
to see the second version, A
Place in the Sun. 20 years later,
he would certainly have picketed
it as well, though the director,
George Stevens, distorted the
novel in a different way.)
Dreiser had considerable justifi
cation — Sternberg's film is
glossy melodrama — but you
come away from it with the
image of Sylvia Sidney as the
doomed working-class girl firmly
in your mind. (Sidney was the
great proletarian heroine of
American movies of the Depres

sion.) Phillips Holmes plays the
wide-eyed social climber —
Dreiser's answer to Stendhal's
Julien Sorel — who dumps his
pregnant girlfriend for an aris
tocratic beauty, played by
Frances Dee (who. like Sylvia
Sidney, could act as well as hold
the camera). Lee Garmes super
vised the first-rate cinematog
raphy.
Plays tonight.
True Heart Susie (1919)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
D. W. Griffith's charming pas
toral romance stars Richard Bar
thelmess and the exquisite young
Lillian Gish. (This was her great
Griffith period. In 19 IS she
starred in Hearts of the World as
the young woman driven to dis
traction when her soldier sweet
heart is missing in action on what
was to be their wedding night. In
1919, in addition to True Heart
Susie, she appeared in Broken
Blossoms as the waif bullied by
her father and adored by a
lonely Chinese — played by Bar
thelmess. Way Down East came
in 1920, and Orphans of the
Storm in 1921.) This movie cer
tainly doesn't rank among Grif
fith's greatest, but it
demonstrates his gift for infusing
sentimental material with so
much lyricism and emotion that
he transforms it. Even in a slight
romantic comedy like True
Heart Susie, Griffith resists easy
cynicism (and easy categoriza
tion); he was the Dickens of
movies, their greatest popular
artist.
Plays Sunday.

but it is not as inventive or out
rageous as his Lt. Kilgore in
Apocalypse Now the previous

year. Blythe Danner, as his wife
Lillian, creates a character out of
very little, and young Michael
O'Keefe contributes a very
promising portrayal of their son
Ben. The one-on-one basketball
match between father and son is
far and away the best sequence
in the picture.
Plays Tuesday with Tender
Mercies.
Some Like It Hot (1959)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The setting is first Chicago
and then Miami, in 1929; Jack
Lemmon and Tony Curtis play
two musicians who have the bad
luck to witness the St.
Valentine's Day Massacre and
then must run for their lives. In
order to escape their pursuers,
they don drag and join an all
girls' band, where they — and
we — have the good luck to
encounter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing
"Running Wild," "I Wanna Be
Loved by You" and "I'm
Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous, amateurishly
appealing best in this dizzy farce,
one of the few memorable
comedies of the '50s, and her
two leading men give extremely
skillful performances (especially
Curtis, whose imitation of Cary
Grant in the passive-aggressive
seduction scene is a high point).
Billy Wilder produced, directed
and co-wrote the picture (with
his frequent partner, I.A.L. Dia
mond), and he assembled a witty
supporting cast. George Raft,
Pat O'Brien, George Stone and
Mike Mazurki show up to spoof
roles they played earlier in their
careers, and the woefully un
derrated '30s comic Joe E.
Brown gives his most endearing
performance as millionaire Os
good Fielding, who falls madly in
love with Jack Lemmon and
delivers the most famous curtain
line in movie history.
Plays today with The Seven
Year Itch.
The Thief of Baghdad (1940)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
The hero of this magnificent
Arabian Nights fantasy ad
venture, Prince Ahmed (John
Justin),~has liquid brown eyes
and a light, teasing moustache,
and the villain, the Grand Vizier
Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), stands on
a tower, shrouded in white, his
arms upraised as he invokes the
winds to visit the sea — a great
fairy tale image. Ludwig Berger,
Michael Powell and Tim Whelan
(credited) and producers Alex
ander Korda, Zoltan Korda and
William Cameron Menzies
(uncredited) all had a hand in
the direction, and Miles Mal
leson and Lajos Biro col
laborated on the clumsy, confus
ing screenplay, which you forget
about whenever there's a new
set (Vincent Korda was the
designer) or a new effect. Except
for Conrad Veidt, who is the
soul of malevolence, and Rex In
gram as a djinni with a laugh that
causes tidal waves, the acting is
mostly Grade B, but the movie
has such an amiable spirit and so
many magical sequences (in the
best one, the thief, played by
Sabu, eludes a giant spider on an
immense web) that it transcends
all its shortcomings. Malleson
makes an appearance,
memorably, as the childish Sul
tan, who is addicted to toys, and
June Duprez plays his daughter,
the object of Ahmed's affection.
Plays Friday.

Jules and Jim (1962)
Festival, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's film about
the evanescence of love, of
dreams, of innocence; often the
tone is playful, as in Godard's
later Band of Outsiders, which
also spins around the games
shared by two men and a wo
man, but this is a much richer
movie — it has the substance of
a long novel, and its lyricism and
esprit mask a tragedy. Truffaut
and Jean Gruault based the
picture on an autobiographical
novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, a
minor figure from the Paris of
the '20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a
legendary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a woman,
together with all the qualities
one expects in a man, with none
of the inconveniences of either."
The film is a masterpiece — and
likely the best movie released in
the '60s (with the possible ex
ception of L'Avventura).
Plays with Shoot the Piano
Player, beginning next
Thursday.
Shoot the Piano Player (1960)
Festival, Palo Alto
Charles Aznavour plays the
title role in this justly famous
Francois Truffaut tragicomedy,
which he and Marcel Moussy
adapted from a David Goodis
novel. Like Godard in
Breathless, Truffaut takes the
American gangster melodramas
of the '30s and '40s as his start
ing point; what he ends up with
is charming and lyrical and al
together unpredictable. Raoul
Coutard is the photographer,
and of the suppoorting players,
Marie Dubois makes the most
memorable appearance.
Plays with Jules and Jim,
beginning next Thursday.
Diner(l9B2)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Barry Levin
son based this wonderful period
piece, set in 1959, on his own
past, and every detail in it seems
deeply felt. The heroes are a
quintet of men in their early 20s
who gather to celebrate the wed
ding of one of them and to send
off the decade that saw their
adolescence. Levinson under
stands the highly emotionally
charged nature of what we call
"trivia": Pop music is the abso
lute against which these people
measure everything that
transpires in their lives. The act
ing (by Daniel Stern, Steve Gut
tenberg, Mickey Rourke, Kevin
Bacon, Timothy Daly, Ellen
Barkin and others) has the kind
of verisimilitude we usually find
in great documentaries.
Plays next Thursday and
Friday with Footloose.
The Blues Brothers (1980)
Cubberley Auditorium
For some reason, John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
weren't as funny together on
film as they had been when they
tried this routine out on
"Saturday Night Live," but there
are bright moments — like their
rendition of the theme from
"Rawhide" in a country and west
ern bar. This is a genial bad
movie — rather chintzy for the
money spent on it — with some
memorable musical highlights
provided by John Lee Hooker,
Cab Calloway, James Brown and
especially Aretha Franklin,
whose performance of "Think"
is one of the most electrifying
solos ever filmed. It's well worth
the price of admission. Carrie
Fisher has a surprisingly funny
cameo. John Landis directed.
Plays Friday evening at 7 &
9:30.
