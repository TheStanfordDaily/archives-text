Iran vows revenge for bombs
lehran, Iran — Iranian military leaders yesterday said 10
towns in eastern Iraq should he evacuated as soon as possible
since they will be bombed 111 reprisal for the attack yesterday
on the Iranian town of Baneh, Iranian radio reported.
Iraqi planes killed between 200 and 300 people and
wounded about the same number in an air attack on Baneh in
northwest Iran, the government said.
"We will avenge ourselves," Iranian President Ali
Khamenei said, according to the radio.
The Iraqi attack on Baneh. a few miles inside Iranian Kur
distan. took place as people were in the streets celebrating the
21st anniversary of an anti-shah uprising provoked by the ar
rest of Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Tehran Radio said.
A government spokesman in Sanandaj, the provincial capi
tal, said bombs fell on a square full of people who had gath
ered to hear a speech and on seven nther places in the town.
It was the first attack on an Iranian town in more than a
month, and first reports suggested it was the worst attack so
far on Baneh, which has been bombed a number of times
since the start of the Iran-Iraq war in September 1980.
Anti-terrorism plan criticized
Washington — A Reagan administration plan to prohibit
Americans from aiding or supporting groups that the govern
ment has designated as terrorist was attacked yesterday at a
Senate hearing as "a throwback to the McCarthy era."
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), speaking at the
opening day of hearings on Reagan's anti-terrorism package,
compared the measure to the indiscriminate accusations un
leashed by the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) during
the anti-communist "witch hunts" of the early 19505.
"We must not make an effort to stop terrorism in a way
that tramples on the Bill of Rights," Metzenbaum said, noting
that he considered the administration plan unconstitutional.
"I am not willing to destroy our Constitution just so that
Congress can appear to be doing something about terrorism."
But at the same time. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), lashed
out at "self-styled civil libertarians" who protect terrorists
rather than their victims. Without the enactment of stronger
measures, he said, such violence — including the bombings last
October of U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. Lebanon, in
which 269 servicemen died, and of the U.S. Capitol the fol
lowing month — would occur more frequently.
"The government has little choice but to wait until sub
versive organizations actually set off their pipe bombs or
sabotage their public facilities before we can treat their activi
ties as more than protected expressions," Hatch said.
Reagan, Thatcher reportedly
discuss Persian Gulf war
London — An informed U.S. source said last night Presi
dent Reagan, in his private meeting with British Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher, almost certainly discussed possible
reactions to an escalation of the Persian Gulf war and may
have touched on London's sales of materiel to Iran.
' The British have been very cautious" on the Persian Gulf
war between Iran and Iraq, "and so are we," the source said.
"But we want to talk about being ready in case there is a need
to respond effectively in a crisis."
Discussions of the gulf situation are known to have taken
place between British and U.S. military officers and at high
political levels.
Previously, U.S. officials said privately that the British
seemed most concerned that the United States might use an
incident in the gulf, where both warring countries have at
tacked shipping, as an excuse to retaliate against Iran. Lon
don seemed interested in restraining such a L'.S. action.
The president, the sources said, may also have raised the
subject of British sales of military equipment to Iran, includ
ing support equipment. The United States, the source said,
believes the British are selling such equipment and would like
London to stop.
Limits OK'd for refugees
Washington — The Supreme Court, rejecting pleas by
numerous U.S. and international human rights organizations,
yesterday upheld longstanding limitations on the availability
of refuge in the United States for foreigners fearing persecu
tion if deported to their home countries.
The court had been asked to interpret federal immigration
law so as to lessen the amount of proof required to support a
claim that a foreign citizen living in the LJnited States would
be persecuted if deported. By a unanimous vote, the justices
declined, saving no such change has been authorized by
Congress.
The ruling was a deleat for Predrag Stevic, 32, a Yugoslav
citizen attempting to avoid deportation on the grounds that
he faces possible imprisonment in Yugoslavia.
Stevic. who lives in Chicago, bases his fear on his participa
tion in an anti-communist organization in this country and the
fact that his father-in-law had been imprisoned in Yugoslavia
because of membership in the same organization. Stevic's ap
peal now returns to a lower court.
The case also affects thousands of Haitians. Salvadorans.
Ethiopians, Iranians and citizens of communist nations who
are residing in the United States and hoping to avoid deporta
tion to their homelands. The decision does not mean that they
will be deported, but it makes it more difficult for them to
stay.
Teamster head is FBI informant
Washington — Teamsters Union President Jackie Presser,
the target of a federal corruption investigation in Cleveland,
has been an informant for the FBI since the 19705, according
to current and former federal law enforcement officials.
Presser"s cooperation with the FBI. considered rare for a
high-ranking official of the scandal-plagued union, is believed
to have complicated a Department of Justice decision on
whether to seek his indictment by a grand jury.
That decision already had been considered sensitive be
cause Presser has been virtually alone among major labor
leaders in his political support for President Reagan.
Federal strike force attorneys in Cleveland have decided to
recommend seeking a grand jury indictment in the case,
which involves "ghost employees'" who drew pay but did no
work for Teamsters Local 507, which Presser controls.
If Department of Justice officials in Washington agree,
Presser would be charged with defrauding the local of at least
$250,000 by approving salaries for the ghost workers, who al
legedly included Presser's uncle. Allen Friedman. Friedman
was convicted last fall of accepting $165,000 in such pay
ments over three years.
Department of Justice officials in Washington have said
that the case against Presser has "problems." Crucial among
them, according to other officials familiar with the matter, is
Presser's role as a source for the FBI.
IBM heads market decline
New York — IBM fell to a 52-week low and helped lead
stocks to a broad decline in sluggish trading yesterday, snap
ping the market's string of four straight advances.
Other computer issues joined International Business
Machines in the loss column, as did oil. steel, telephone, min
ing and drug stocks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.68 to
1 124.89 after climbing 30.33 over the four previous sessions.

The court had been asked to interpret federal immigration
law so as to lessen the amount of proof required to support a
claim that a foreign citizen living in the LJnited States would
be persecuted if deported. By a unanimous vote, the justices
declined, saving no such change has been authorized by
Congress.
The ruling was a deleat for Predrag Stevic, 32, a Yugoslav
citizen attempting to avoid deportation on the grounds that
he faces possible imprisonment in Yugoslavia.
Stevic. who lives in Chicago, bases his fear on his participa
tion in an anti-communist organization in this country and the
fact that his father-in-law had been imprisoned in Yugoslavia
because of membership in the same organization. Stevic's ap
peal now returns to a lower court.
The case also affects thousands of Haitians. Salvadorans.
Ethiopians, Iranians and citizens of communist nations who
are residing in the United States and hoping to avoid deporta
tion to their homelands. The decision does not mean that they
will be deported, but it makes it more difficult for them to
stay.
Teamster head is FBI informant
Washington — Teamsters Union President Jackie Presser,
the target of a federal corruption investigation in Cleveland,
has been an informant for the FBI since the 19705, according
to current and former federal law enforcement officials.
Presser"s cooperation with the FBI. considered rare for a
high-ranking official of the scandal-plagued union, is believed
to have complicated a Department of Justice decision on
whether to seek his indictment by a grand jury.
That decision already had been considered sensitive be
cause Presser has been virtually alone among major labor
leaders in his political support for President Reagan.
Federal strike force attorneys in Cleveland have decided to
recommend seeking a grand jury indictment in the case,
which involves "ghost employees'" who drew pay but did no
work for Teamsters Local 507, which Presser controls.
If Department of Justice officials in Washington agree,
Presser would be charged with defrauding the local of at least
$250,000 by approving salaries for the ghost workers, who al
legedly included Presser's uncle. Allen Friedman. Friedman
was convicted last fall of accepting $165,000 in such pay
ments over three years.
Department of Justice officials in Washington have said
that the case against Presser has "problems." Crucial among
them, according to other officials familiar with the matter, is
Presser's role as a source for the FBI.

Iran vows revenge for bombs
lehran, Iran — Iranian military leaders yesterday said 10
towns in eastern Iraq should he evacuated as soon as possible
since they will be bombed 111 reprisal for the attack yesterday
on the Iranian town of Baneh, Iranian radio reported.
Iraqi planes killed between 200 and 300 people and
wounded about the same number in an air attack on Baneh in
northwest Iran, the government said.
"We will avenge ourselves," Iranian President Ali
Khamenei said, according to the radio.
The Iraqi attack on Baneh. a few miles inside Iranian Kur
distan. took place as people were in the streets celebrating the
21st anniversary of an anti-shah uprising provoked by the ar
rest of Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Tehran Radio said.
A government spokesman in Sanandaj, the provincial capi
tal, said bombs fell on a square full of people who had gath
ered to hear a speech and on seven nther places in the town.
It was the first attack on an Iranian town in more than a
month, and first reports suggested it was the worst attack so
far on Baneh, which has been bombed a number of times
since the start of the Iran-Iraq war in September 1980.
Anti-terrorism plan criticized
Washington — A Reagan administration plan to prohibit
Americans from aiding or supporting groups that the govern
ment has designated as terrorist was attacked yesterday at a
Senate hearing as "a throwback to the McCarthy era."
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), speaking at the
opening day of hearings on Reagan's anti-terrorism package,
compared the measure to the indiscriminate accusations un
leashed by the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) during
the anti-communist "witch hunts" of the early 19505.
"We must not make an effort to stop terrorism in a way
that tramples on the Bill of Rights," Metzenbaum said, noting
that he considered the administration plan unconstitutional.
"I am not willing to destroy our Constitution just so that
Congress can appear to be doing something about terrorism."
But at the same time. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), lashed
out at "self-styled civil libertarians" who protect terrorists
rather than their victims. Without the enactment of stronger
measures, he said, such violence — including the bombings last
October of U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. Lebanon, in
which 269 servicemen died, and of the U.S. Capitol the fol
lowing month — would occur more frequently.
"The government has little choice but to wait until sub
versive organizations actually set off their pipe bombs or
sabotage their public facilities before we can treat their activi
ties as more than protected expressions," Hatch said.
Reagan, Thatcher reportedly
discuss Persian Gulf war
London — An informed U.S. source said last night Presi
dent Reagan, in his private meeting with British Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher, almost certainly discussed possible
reactions to an escalation of the Persian Gulf war and may
have touched on London's sales of materiel to Iran.
' The British have been very cautious" on the Persian Gulf
war between Iran and Iraq, "and so are we," the source said.
"But we want to talk about being ready in case there is a need
to respond effectively in a crisis."
Discussions of the gulf situation are known to have taken
place between British and U.S. military officers and at high
political levels.
Previously, U.S. officials said privately that the British
seemed most concerned that the United States might use an
incident in the gulf, where both warring countries have at
tacked shipping, as an excuse to retaliate against Iran. Lon
don seemed interested in restraining such a L'.S. action.
The president, the sources said, may also have raised the
subject of British sales of military equipment to Iran, includ
ing support equipment. The United States, the source said,
believes the British are selling such equipment and would like
London to stop.
Limits OK'd for refugees
Washington — The Supreme Court, rejecting pleas by
numerous U.S. and international human rights organizations,
yesterday upheld longstanding limitations on the availability
of refuge in the United States for foreigners fearing persecu
tion if deported to their home countries.
