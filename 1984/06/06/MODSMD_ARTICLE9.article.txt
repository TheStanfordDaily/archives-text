New Delhi, India (AP) â€”
More than 100 worshipers
obeyed army orders to leave the
Golden Temple in Amritsar
yesterday, but militants
entrenched inside the Sikhs'
holiest shrine fought a daylong
battle with government troops.
A government spokesman
confirmed for the first time that
army and paramilitary forces
had been authorized to storm
the 17th Century fortress-like
complex where 3000 Sikh faith

ful live if the militants didn't
surrender.
Tanks and heavy artillery
were poised in Amritsar and
just outside the gates of other
major cities, said reliable
sources in the northern state of
Punjab, where violence by Sikh
estremists seeking autonomy
has resulted in 350 deaths in the
past three months.
The state has been cut off
from the rest of India since Sun
day when the government

imposed a curfew, prohibited
travel and banned news reports.
Foreigners, including jour
nalists, have been expelled from
the area.
At least 1 17 Sikhs left the be
sieged temple as the soldiers
held their fire, according to gov
ernment officials in the capital
of New Delhi. 230 miles south
of the fighting.
One soldier and a civilian
laborer were killed and four
troopers were wounded yester

day as the defiant militants fired
mortars and machine guns from
a fortified water tower within
the temple complex, said Home
Ministry secretary M.K. Wali.
The security forces returned
the fire, but it was not known if
there were any casualties among
the Sikhs in the temple, he said.
The United News of India
said between eight and 10
people were killed when secur
ity forces opened fire on the
protesters.

Thirty-six people on the
temple grounds were killed in a
five-hour battle Monday when
the militants used suh-machine
guns, grenades and homemade
bombs, reliable sources in Pun
jab said. Police in Punjab said
16 had died.
The Sikhs are a minority in
India, but they form a 52 per
cent majority of the population
in Punjab, where their Akali
Dal party is seeking more religi
ous and political autonomy.
