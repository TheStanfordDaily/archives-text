Spectacular whitewater rafting
only three hours from the campus
While you're on the Farm this summer, why not take
advantage of the excitement and flat-out fun that
California's whitewater rivers offer experienced and tyro
rafters. The South Fork of the American, the main
Tuolumne, the Merced — all are within a morning's drive
from Hoover Tower. For only $100, a group of eight or so
can rent a whitewater raft, complete with paddles, life
vests, safety lines and baling buckets (Gsee — only
$12.50 per rafter). Stanford offers you a great tradition —
and the best of California's rivers are right up the road.
