# Moffet sets world record at Olympic trials
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Stanford junior John Moffet, often a brides
maid to Steve Lundquist in the past, set a world
record yesterday in the 100-meter breaststroke to
make the Olympic team at the U.S. Swimming
Trials in Indianapolis.
Moffet, 19, of Costa Mesa, and Lundquist, 23,
of Jonesboro, Ga., both qualified for the Los An
geles Games by eclipsing Lundquist's previous
world standard of 1:02.28.
But it was Moffet, who had finished behind
Lundquist in the 1982 World Championships and
the 1983 Pan American Games, who got the glory
of winning the race. Moffet was clocked in
1:02.13 and Lundquist was a whisker behind in
1:02.16.
Lundquist, who set the previous record at last
summer's Pan American Games in Caracas,
Venezuela, also had beaten Moffet in the morning
preliminaries.
"I've never beaten Steve in the 100 in a big
meet," said Moffet. "1 just wanted to make the
team."
"When he beat me in the Pan Am games, it was
only by eight hundredths of a second," Moffet
said, "but before that he's kind of blatantly beaten

my butt in the past. It was easier having a person
to beat than a time, but it was frustrating losing to
him all the time."
In March, Moffet won both the 100 and 200-
yard breaststroke events at the NCAA champion
ships in Cleveland as Stanford finished third as a
team. Lundquist still holds the NCAA marks in
both events, having set them last year as a senior
at Southern Methodist.
Lundquist was somewhat surprised in defeat. "I
thought I had a chance to win. I came off the wall
(at 50 meters) and thoug-ht, 'Maybe he'll die,' but
he didn't. He's a great competitor."
"I died a little coming home the last five or 10
meters," Moffet responded. "I just wanted to get
home. Whenever it's that close, it's just a matter
of the touch."
Moffet is the first Stanford swimmer to make
the Olympic team. Others who are given a good
shot at the squad are Pablo Morales in the 100
and 200-meter butterfly, Jeff Kostoff in the 400
and 1500-meter freestyle as well as the 400-meter
individual medley, Dave Sims in the 1500 free,
Marybeth Linzmeier in the 200, 500 and 1500
free, and Susan Rapp in the 100 fly.
The trials began yesterday and continue
through Saturday.
