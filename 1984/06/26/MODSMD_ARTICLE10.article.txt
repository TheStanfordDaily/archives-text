## David Broder Father grapples with the future at commencement 
### 
Palo Alto, Calif. — My 1984 commencement
trail began on a rainy May Monday in New
Haven, and ended here on a hot and cloudless
June Sunday, where the youngest son was collect
ing a bachelor's degree. But how could that be?
Surely, this kid had started at Stanford about six
months ago — not four years ago, as he claimed.
It did not help that the night before, the
graduate had explained that his future was in
futures — a field of endeavor as unknown to his
father as the strange trees surrounding what the
campus map called "The Sunken Diamond" or
baseball field, where the graduation spectators
were gathering.
This son I thought 1 knew had gone west to this
place of strange vegetation, had entered some sort
of time-warping and mind-altering California
process, and now was going to walk ott a below
ground baseball field into a future of futures.
Flipping through the commencement program
book during the processional did not ease the dis
quiet. Every page seemed to suggest the presence
of forces that could further distort the future.
"Sixteen members of the Stanford faculty were
named to endowed professorships during the past
year," I read. The list followed: four in law; three
in business; one in business and law; three in elec
trical engineering; two in radiology. That left
three for traditional academics: one in Spanish,
one in economics and one in philosophy. What
does that 1 3-3 ratio suggest?
I turned the pages of the advanced degree can
didates, searching for trends. There were 13 new
doctors of aeronautics and astronautics. One has
written a dissertation on "computation of inviscid
transonic flow using tlux vector splitting in
generalized coordinates." Is that space-talk tor
"The future is futures"?
Toward the back of the book, there was more
depressing news: There are more doctorates in
computer science than in philosophy or history or
English, more than in classics, French and music
combined. Someone has earned a doctorate in a
field called "communication" with a thesis en
titled: "Personal computers: their adoption and
use in information work by professors."
By this time, I was seriously depressed. But
things began to improve as soon as the program
started, and then got steadily better. "America
the Beautiful" was sung, including the important
verse enjoining us to "confirm thy soul in self
control, thy liberty in law."
Richard W. Lyman, president of the Rockefel
ler Foundation and former president of Stanford,
delivered a graceful commencement address,
quoting Adlai Stevenson, as all such orations
should do. On the campus that will house the
future Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, his
torian Lyman said that "not since the 14th cen
tury and its bubonic plague have human beings
felt their survival as threatened" as they do today.
By way of illustrating the danger of following
the trendy psychologists' counsel to "try tor small
victories," rather than risk major frustration, he
decried the "relentless small-mindedness" of both

sides at the aborted Geneva arms-control talks.
"Humanity deserves better than that," he said.
As if in response, the teaching award for the
year went to Condoleezza Rice, a black woman
political scientist who helped organize an under
graduate seminar on arms-control issues.
"The greatest danger you face," Lyman told the
graduates, "is the narrowing of your horizons."
But there was nothing narrow about the horizons
of honor graduate Deborah Anne Prentice of
Moraga, Calif., who took a double major in
human biology and music. "Bravo and long life,
Deborah Anne!," we cried.
Then Donald Kennedy, Stanford's civilized
president, gave his advice to the graduates.
Quoting John Gardner, he told them that in this
pluralistic, fast-changing society, "Your commit-

ments determine your identity."
Quoting Stanford predecessor Wallace Sterling
and ignoring the extraordinary price the business
world sets on Stanford MBAs, he told them that
education is not training but rather the process
that "equips you to entertain yourself, a friend
and an idea."
Quoting outspoken Cedric Maxwell of the Bos
ton Celtics, he said that, "If you are afraid about
the repercussions of honesty, you ought to get
yourself a Doberman."
And drawing on his own experience as a
teacher and public official, he gave them the best
advice of the day. "Touch bottom often" in your
country, he said. Looking out on the products of
his elite and expensive institution, Kennedy said,
"Yuppiedom does not conduce to a realistic view
of the human condition or of American society."
"This is a great diverse country," he said. "Its
genius does not reside in the practice of law or
medicine or in the cultivation of urbane taste and
high culture."
When you want to know who you are and what
you are part of, he said, "visit Newark. Ohio, or
Bend, Ore., or Munising, Mich and relearn the
arts of living in communities of manageable size."
As he spoke, my disorientation faded and my
equanimity was restored. I may never understand
futures, but as the graduates gathered up their
black robes and charged up the grassy banks of
the "sunken diamond" to join their spectator kin,
I could feel the joy and energy and hopefulness of
their scrambling steps.
