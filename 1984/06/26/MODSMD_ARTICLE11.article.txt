Unfair use of the term partisan

How long will every associa
tion with the government of the
United States be defined as
"partisan political activity,"
when engaged in by anyone at
the Hoover Institution — but
not when other members of the
Stanford community serve as
consultants, advisers, or appoin

tees to various administrations?
The definition is not even ap
plied consistently to the people
at Hoover, who include advisers
to administrations of both par
ties. Or is it twice as bad to be
"bipartisan?"
Thomas Sowell
Hoover Institution

Daily misrepresents The Birth Place

This is in response to your ar
ticle, "Natural childbirth, a fam
ily affair at the Birth Place,"
published on May 25, 1984.
I found the editing of the arti
cle highly biased and mislead
ing. For example: Dr. Rosen
berg was quoted as to speaking
of the home birth movement in
reference to The Birth Place.
The Birth Place is a licensed
maternity clinic under Title 22

of the State of California and is
as well equipped as any commu
nity hospital for low risk births.
Our statistics are outstanding
and the safety of our clients is of
prime importance to us.
Nowhere in the article did I
see mentioned that The Birth
Place has a very strict Medical
Protocol and Procedure and
highly trained obstetricians,
family practitioners and cer
tified nurse-midwives practicing
here.
I know the reporter inter
viewed physicians who have
privileges at The Birth Place
and feel further proof of the bias
of this article by the fact that no
quotes were taken from them.
The article was edited to depict
parents vs. professionals and
implant the idea that any devia
tion from current medical tech
nology is unwise and unsafe.
Furthermore, the example
given of a newborn with a nuc-

Hal cord implied that such
children would make it only in
the hospital. It is not only a very
rare occurence, but The Birth
Place also has the equipment to
handle it.
What The Birth Place offers is
a safe alternative to home and
hospital birth. We offer our
clients dignity, awareness, sup
port and control along with pro
fessional medical care and
safety during the birth of their
child.
I am disappointed to see that
The Daily does not pride itself
in representing unbiased jour
nalism.
