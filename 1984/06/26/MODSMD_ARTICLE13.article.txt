## White Plaza's fruit man suffers heart attack 
### LISA LYNCH 
Thomas Dallas, better known
as "Thomaso the fruit man," is
in critical condition after a heart
attack last Tuesday morning at
his son's home.
Dallas is presently in Stanford
Hospital; he has been in a coma
since his attack and there is
"small hope that he will
recover," according to his son
Tom Dallas Jr.
"We aren't sure that it was a
heart attack," Dallas Jr. said.
"We know that he has suffered
brain damage due to a hypoxic
condition (lack of oxygen to the
brain) and that though he is
physically active, the signs nec
essary for recovery just aren't
there."
Thomaso and Maria Dallas
have sold fruit from a cart
outside of the Stanford
Bookstore since 1971. They
have befriended faculty, staff
and generations of students,
who stopped to listen to the
classical music playing on the
Dallas' radio, to buy a piece of
fruit Dallas shopped for every
morning, or just to talk about
fruit, music or Dallas himself.
Dallas had lived many lives

before becoming a fruit seller;
born in Italy in 1906, he lost his
father at the age of thirteen and
set out on his own. "He's been
to almost every country in the
world," explained Dallas Jr.,
adding that his father spoke
eight languages and had served
both in the United States army
and the Italian 'foreign legion'
in Africa.
Dallas' name, obviously not
Italian, was changed by Dallas
when he got to the United
States and found that by chang
ing his name it would be easier
to break down some of the bar
riers normally faced by im
migrants.
In addition to running the
fruit stand, Tom is an active
amateur musician. He often
sings at San Francisco's Caffe
Trieste, sometimes with music
professor Robert McGinn.
According to Dallas Jr., it is
unlikely that the fruit stand will
continue without Thomaso.
"I'm not sure about this, but I
can't imagine Maria running the
stand without my father," he
said. "My father was a vigorous
man for his age, and he did all
the shopping, lifting of bags, etc.

She might try to run the stand
for limited hours, because she
loves to be at Stanford."
When interviewed for last

fall's Up Front magazine, Dallas
said that he had four childhood
aspirations. "I had four things in
mind; a musician, a composer, a

doctor or a lawyer. My motto is
to work to make an honest
living . . . I've always made an
honest living."
