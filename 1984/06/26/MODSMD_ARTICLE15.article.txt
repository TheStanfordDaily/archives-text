## Sakharov resolution signed individually 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
More than 20 members of the
Faculty Senate have signed a
petition supporting Soviet dissi
dent physicist Andrei Sakharov.
The action came June 14 after
an official resolution backing
Sakharov was withdrawn from
consideration because several
senators objected to it.
The resolution would have
urged Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko to
facilitate medical care essential
to the health of Sakharov and
his wife, Yelena Bonner.
University President Donald
Kennedy then proposed a com
promise solution in which all
members of the senate were en
couraged to sign the statement
as individuals, without making it
a formal institutional act.
The senators who spoke
against the resolution, physics
Prof. Dirk Walecka, business
Prof. Eugene Webb and medical
microbiology Prof. Leon Rosen
berg, said they supported Sak
harov but did not believe it was
proper for the senate to involve
itself in his case. All three
signed the petition immediately

after the meeting.
Walecka was the first to speak
against the resolution.
"I will work against it,"he
said. "This has nothing to do
with my personal feelings on
this issue, but is precisely be
cause they are personal beliefs."
Webb then joined Walecka.
Senate Chairman Craig Hel
ler said he felt it was appropri
ate for the senate to consider
the resolution because "the
heart of the issue deals with aca
demic freedom, and that is
something the faculty should be
concerned with."
Rosenberg said the resolution
was "impossible to vote against,
but I will abstain on the grounds
that similar issues in the past
have not been addressed.
"Those other issues were just
as acute and involved injustices
at least as great," Rosenberg
said.
He referred to "abrogations
of civil rights in South American
universities.
"The failure of the senate to
take positions in those circum
stances makes it difficult for me
to endorse this resolution,"
Rosenberg said.

Kennedy said he normally
opposes taking institutional pos
itions on political questions.
He added, however, "There
are cases so compelling that you
accept risks and abandon that
position . . . It's a departure
from the kind of restraint I nor
mally impose on myself, but
even the most robust principle
has exceptions."
Kennedy said, "The failure of
this resolution would be a state
ment as unintendedly strong as
its passage . . . Not to decide is
to decide."
The president then suggested
a recess in order that "all mem
bers can append their names as
individuals, if that satisfies both
the proponents and those
troubled by the action."
Rosenberg then suggested
that language be added to the
statement noting that "this case
is just one of many which
troubles us." He specifically
referred to persecution of
academicians in Bolivia, Chile
and Argentina.
Sakharov won the Nobel
Prize for developing the Soviet
hydrogen bomb, and has since
become a prominent critic of

Soviet policies.
He began a hunger strike in
early May to protest Bonner's
arrest on charges of treason. Al
though he is in extremely poor
health, he vowed to continue to
fast until Bonner is allowed to
travel abroad for medical treat
ment.
The international academic
community has rallied behind
Sakharov's cause.
In mid-May, Kennedy joined
the presidents of Harvard, Yale,
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Cornell and Cal-
Tech in signing a telegram offer
ing Sakharov a teaching position
at any of theiF universities and
urging Chernenko to release
Sakharov and Bonner. Similar
appeals were sent by 34 mem
bers of the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences, including
Stanford professors Sidney
Drell and Paul Flory.
The ASSU Senate-elect
unanimously passed a resolution
similar to the one the Faculty
Senate withdrew from consider
ation.
The text of the proposed
resolution read as follows: "The
Senate of the Academic council

of Stanford University joins uni
versity and academic institu
tions throughout Western
Europe and the United States in
urging you to protect and
restore the academic freedom of
Academician Andrei Sakharov
and to facilitate medical care es
sential to his health and that of
his wife, Yelena Bonner. We
ask this in the furtherance of the
intellectual and academic ex
changes of knowledge vital to
the future of all of us."
In other action, the senate:
• Approved a report from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) which signifi
cantly reduced the number of
courses fulfilling the distribution
requirement in literature and
fine arts;
• Asked the CUS to review the
impact of the undergraduate
distribution requirement sys
tem;
• Passed a resolution in memory
of Psychology Prof. J. Merrill
Carlsmith, who died of cancer
April 19 at the age of 48;
• Announced the results of or
ganizational elections for the
new senate.
