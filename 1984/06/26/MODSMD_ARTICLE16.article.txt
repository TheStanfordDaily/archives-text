EDITOR'S NOTE: The following are some important news items from
the interim between the Dead Week issue of The Daily and tnis first
issue of the summer session.

New sculpture
honors pioneer
A sculpture by renowned
cubist Jacques Lipchitz now
stands in front of Stanford Uni
versity Hospital as a memorial
to Dr. Henry Kaplan,
radiologist and cancer research
pioneer, who died Feb. 4.
The aluminum cast of the 17-
foot sculpture, "Song of the
Vowels," was positioned in the
grassy area in front of the hospi
tal on June 12 at an angle in
tended to optimize the effect of
sunlight on the work. Graphi
cally, it depicts the theme of
twin harpists, another interest of
Lipchitz, who said he had been
inspired by a performance in a
French concert hall.
A fundraising effort is under
way to meet the $350,000 cost
of the sculpture, and a formal
dedication will be scheduled in
the fall.
'Gay Liberation'
reinstalled
George Segal's outdoor
sculpture, "Gay Liberation,"
damaged by a hammer-wielding

vandal on March 6, was
reinstalled at Stanford on June
8. The decision was made by
University president Donald
Kennedy on the unanimous re
commendation of the University
Panel on Outdoor Art.
The four life-size bronze fig
ures, grouped on and near a
park bench, were put back on a
grassy knoll at the northern end
of Lomita Mall, west of the
Mathematics Department and
east of Varian Laboratories.
The restoration was done
with the approval of the sculptor
and the owner, the Mildred
Andrews Fund of New Orleans.
Cost was not disclosed by the
University.
Stanford Board
of Trustees busy
Election of 1984-85 officers —
The Board of Trustees on June
15 elected William Kimball to
serve another one-year term as
board president, effective July
1.
A 1941 graduate of Stanford,
Kimball was originally elected

to the board in 1974 and has
served as major gifts chairman
and chairman of the Develop
ment Committee. He was first
elected board president in 1981.
Warren Christopher, James
Gaither, John Young and Bar
bara Finberg were elected to
serve one-year terms as vice
presidents.
Road improvements on
campus — The Board of Trus
tees has authorized $558,000
for road improvements in the
San Juan subdivision, with
major repairs planned on Al
varado Row, Lane B, Cabrillo
Ave. and Valpariso and Dolores
Streets.
Roads and drainage in the
campus residential subdivisions
have not had major repairs since
they were constructed, and
some in the older areas have
deteriorated significantly, a
report to the trustees noted.
These projects will be part of
a residential subdivision general
plant improvement program ap
proved by the trustees June 15.
Funding will come from a pro
rata charge on new housing de

velopment and, starting in 1990,
an increase in the ground rent
charged to each adjustable rent
residential leasehold.
More parking spaces — The
Board of Trustees on June 15
authorized an additional 400
parking spaces at the Stanford
Shopping Center, scheduled for
construction by late October.
The existing lot will be ex
panded at its northern boundary
at an estimated total cost of
$705,000. Endowment funds
will provide approximately
$615,000, with the remainder
from Neiman-Marcus. Revenue
from the shopping center contri
butes to the University's endow
ment.
This will complete the
planned expansion of parking at
the center.
Funds for environmental
safety — The Board of Trustees
on June 15 authorized $6.4 mil
lion for the construction of an
environmental safety facility
(ESF) for the handling of medi
cal and research hazardous
wastes on campus. The board

endorsed the concept last fall
and approved a site for the
facility in December.
The ESF will consist of three
low-lying buildings on a 3.5-
acre site on unincorporated
University property midway be
tween Campus Dr. and vVillow
Rd. The buildings will house
offices, a classroom and waste
handling areas.
Activities now conducted at
scattered locations on campus
will be consolidated in the new
facility, according to Dr Alain
DeCleve, director of health and
safety. There will be no on
campus burial of hazardous ma
terials.
Seven various permits will be
obtained from local, state and
federal agencies. Public
hearings on the ESF and its En
vironmental Impact Report will
be held in Palo Alto and at
Santa Clara County in the fall.
Informational material about
the project may be obtained
from the Department of Health
and Safety, Encina Annex,
Stanford campus.

Road improvements on
campus — The Board of Trus
tees has authorized $558,000
for road improvements in the
San Juan subdivision, with
major repairs planned on Al
varado Row, Lane B, Cabrillo
Ave. and Valpariso and Dolores
Streets.
Roads and drainage in the
campus residential subdivisions
have not had major repairs since
they were constructed, and
some in the older areas have
deteriorated significantly, a
report to the trustees noted.
These projects will be part of
a residential subdivision general
plant improvement program ap
proved by the trustees June 15.
Funding will come from a pro

velopment and, starting in 1990,
an increase in the ground rent
charged to each adjustable rent
residential leasehold.

$705,000. Endowment funds
will provide approximately
$615,000, with the remainder
from Neiman-Marcus. Revenue

This will complete the
planned expansion of parking at
the center.
Funds for environmental
safety — The Board of Trustees
on June 15 authorized $6.4 mil
lion for the construction of an
environmental safety facility
(ESF) for the handling of medi

facility in December.
The ESF will consist of three
low-lying buildings on a 3.5-
acre site on unincorporated
University property midway be
tween Campus Dr. and vVillow
Rd. The buildings will house
offices, a classroom and waste
handling areas.
Activities now conducted at
scattered locations on campus
will be consolidated in the new
facility, according to Dr Alain
DeCleve, director of health and
safety. There will be no on
campus burial of hazardous ma
terials.
Seven various permits will be
obtained from local, state and
federal agencies. Public
hearings on the ESF and its En
vironmental Impact Report will
be held in Palo Alto and at
Santa Clara County in the fall.

the project may be obtained
