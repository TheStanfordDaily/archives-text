## Cady qualifies for Olympic shot put team 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Stanford graduate Carol Cady
put the shot 55 feet, 7% inches
at the U.S. Olympic Track Tri
als in Los Angeles last week to
place second and qualify for the
Olympic team.

Cady was the only Stanford
athlete to make the track team.
Only two other Cardinals ad
vanced to the finals in their
events, and neither qualified.
PattiSue Plumer finished sixth
in the 3000-meter run and
Regina Jacobs came in 10th in

the 1500-meter run. Plumer was
in a particularly poor position
because her natural event is the
5000 meters, which is not an
Olympic event for women.
Cady considers her stronger
event to be the discus, but she
finished fourth in that event on

Sunday with a toss of 187-2, one
foot shy of the third-place finish
needed to make the team. "I'm
not going to hide the fact that
I'm disappointed that I didn't
make it in the discus," Cady
said. "The discus has always
been my favorite event."
Cady said that she was not ex
pecting to make the team in the
shot put. "I expected to qualify
in the discus, but I ended up
qualifying in the shot," she said.
"Maybe someone was trying to
tell me something."
Cady said that she was some
what surprised at her 55-7 3 /4 ef
fort though her best put is 56-
10. "I haven't worked on the
shot recently and I have been
working on the discus," she
said. "I'd passed my peak in the
shot and I was there in the dis
cus."
Cady, who graduated just
nine days ago with a degree in
mechanical engineering, said
that her mental attitude wasn't
right in the discus. "I had a bad
day," she said, "I didn't have
the 'attack mode'. I do better
under pressure, and I knew that
I could make the team in the
discus, so I didn't go after it. I
went after the shot because I
knew I had nothing to lose."

Even though the Soviet
Union and its satellites have
dropped out of the games, Cady
is still a long way from the best
at the Games. "The fact that the
Eastern Bloc has dropped out
makes it easier, but there is still
a Romanian who has thrown 68
feet, a West German who threw
67, and an Australian who
threw 62."
The American record is 62-7.
The best throw by an American
this year is 58-8 by Lorna Grif
fin, who won the Trials with a
toss of 56-1. Cady barely edged
out third-place finisher Ramona
Pagel, who was a quarter-inch
behind at 55-7V2.
"I've got to take it in steps,"
Cady said about challenging at
the Games. "I've never taken it
(the shot) seriously before."
Though she will only compete
in the shot put at the Olympics,
Cady said she won't stop her
discus training.
Cady said her workouts will
be "shorter, but much more in
tense. I can't afford to overtrain,
so I'll train smarter. I'll go out
each day with a goal, and once I
accomplish it, I'll stop. I'll do
less throws, but I'll concentrate
more."
