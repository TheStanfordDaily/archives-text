# Revelli, Jones picked by Lakers in NBA draft
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Stanford graduates John
Revelli and Keith Jones will be
teammates for at least a few
months longer because both
were picked by the Los Angeles
Lakers in last Tuesday's Na
tional Basketball Association
draft. Revelli was chosen in the
fourth round, while Jones went
in the sixth round.
Both face some very long
odds against making it in the
NBA. Very few fourth-round
selections make NBA teams,
and even fewer sixth-round
picks stick with clubs.
Revelli was chosen for his
rebounding abilities and would
probably be a power forward in
the NBA. Unfortunately for
Revelli, the Lakers' No. 1
choice, Earl Jones, is also a
Strong forward. Jones played at
the University of the District of
Columbia and led UDC to the
NCAA Division II Champion
ship last year.
Â£ Stanford Head Coach Tom
Davis commented, "Earl Jones
is a different type of player.
He's more tall and thin, while

John is more muscular."
Davis went on to say, "There
are a couple of things in their fa
vor. First, Jerry West scouted
both of them himself in Decem
ber. He saw them play a good,
up-tempo game against North
Carolina, and he apparently
liked what he saw enough to
draft them both. Also, Keith
was the first guard they took.
"As far as coachability and
attitude go, they're the best.
They're both very receptive,
they listen extremely well, and
they're competitive. But unfor
tunately, they're both small by
NBA standards. (Revelli is 6-8,
Jones is 6-1.) They're fine for
college, but small for the pros,
and I don't think they're going
to grow many inches during the
next few months."
Davis compared Revelli to
current Laker forward Kurt
Rambis, who played at Santa
Clara and went to Italy before
making it with the Lakers.
"There's no question that John
has some of the same qualities
as Rambis," he said. "They both
play in the same tough fashion."
Looking at the other side.

Davis said, "There are also
some negatives, though. The
Lakers may not have any spots
open on their roster. They'll
have to go into training camp
and earn their jobs."
Davis refused to make predic
tions. "I won't speculate on
their chances," he said.
"Obviously, the higher you're
drafted, the better your chances
are. John and Keith are both in
a gray area. They both have a
shot at it. The one thing in favor
of both is that the more they see
them, the more they'll like
them. I know they'll really
impress anyone who sees them
play enough. Their personalities
and attitudes and everything
about them is first rate."
Davis concluded by saying,
"Keith and John know the odds
are against them. But they both
also know they'll have Stanford
degrees when their basketball
careers are over. Even if they
make it, they won't play forever.
They'll have to do something
else, whether it's next year or a
few years down the line."
Revelli has received his degree
and Jones has one quarter to go.

Keith Jones and John Revelli will be playing together
for at least another few months, as the two Stanford
teammates were both chosen by the Los Angeles
Lakers in the NBA draft last Tuesday. If they fail to
make the Lakers, Revelli will likely play in Europe,
while Jones will probably return to Stanford for one
quarter to finish his degree.
