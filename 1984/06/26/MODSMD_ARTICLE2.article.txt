Nearly 4500 degrees were
awarded at Stanford's 93rd
commencement June 17, as an
estimated 20,000 people filled
Sunken Diamond for the first
commencement ceremony held
on the baseball field.
Commencement had previ
ously been conducted in Frost
Amphitheater, but overcrowd
ing led to the move. 15,000
paper visors emblazoned "I
survived the Sunken Diamond"
were passed out to those attend
ing.
Graduates and guests heard

commencement speaker Rich
ard Lyman — Stanford presi
dent from 1970 to 1980 — urge
graduates to tackle the large
problems that society faces,
while President Donald Ken
nedy reminded them that
"yuppiedom" does not provide
a realistic view of the American
heartland.
Lyman opened with an obser
vation on the intermittent ex
plosions of champagne corks,
saying, "Experts in chemistry
inform me that in any competi
tion between rhetoric and
champagne, champagne reaches
the human brain first every

time."
Lyman reassured the
graduates that receiving their
degree was an accomplishment
to be proud of, but he intro
duced his message with a refer
ence to a New York Times arti
cle entitled "Commencement
'84: Graduates Told to Build a
Better Future.'" He also noted a
brertk from this tradition:
humorist Art Buchwald, who
told Vassar graduates, "Now we
of the older generation have
given you a perfect world —
don't louse it up!"
Lyman said the line that is of
ten drawn between College and

The Real World does not exist.
"The notion that grim reality is
just waiting out there, on the
other side of El Camino, to grab
you when you leave Stanford is
fanciful in the extreme — and
an obstacle to clear thinking
about who you are and where
you're headed," he said.
Lyman said he rejects the
idea oi a "Me Gent ration", but
thinks there are '"Me Eras,* pe
riods of national self
centeredness that inevitably af
fect young as well as old. Na
tions, like individuals, get weary
from time to time. Societies, like
people, can lose confidence in

their ability to copc with stub
born difficulties or problems of
great complexity.
"In such periods it is tempting
to limit oneself, consciously or
unconsciously, to activities and
interests that one can readily
grasp, problems that seem likely
to have solutions, though the
problems themselves may be of
minor importance in the long
scheme of things.
"There's even a whole theory
put forth by some psychologists
urging us to adopt a strategy of
trying for small wins. Big
