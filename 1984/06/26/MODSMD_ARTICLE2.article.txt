# Lyman, Kennedy urge courage in graduates

### JOHN LIS Staff writer 
Nearly 4500 degrees were
awarded at Stanford's 93rd
commencement June 17, as an
estimated 20,000 people filled
Sunken Diamond for the first
commencement ceremony held
on the baseball field.
Commencement had previ
ously been conducted in Frost
Amphitheater, but overcrowd
ing led to the move. 15,000
paper visors emblazoned "I
survived the Sunken Diamond"
were passed out to those attend
ing.
Graduates and guests heard

commencement speaker Rich
ard Lyman — Stanford presi
dent from 1970 to 1980 — urge
graduates to tackle the large
problems that society faces,
while President Donald Ken
nedy reminded them that
"yuppiedom" does not provide
a realistic view of the American
heartland.
Lyman opened with an obser
vation on the intermittent ex
plosions of champagne corks,
saying, "Experts in chemistry
inform me that in any competi
tion between rhetoric and
champagne, champagne reaches
the human brain first every

time."
Lyman reassured the
graduates that receiving their
degree was an accomplishment
to be proud of, but he intro
duced his message with a refer
ence to a New York Times arti
cle entitled "Commencement
'84: Graduates Told to Build a
Better Future.'" He also noted a
brertk from this tradition:
humorist Art Buchwald, who
told Vassar graduates, "Now we
of the older generation have
given you a perfect world —
don't louse it up!"
Lyman said the line that is of
ten drawn between College and

The Real World does not exist.
"The notion that grim reality is
just waiting out there, on the
other side of El Camino, to grab
you when you leave Stanford is
fanciful in the extreme — and
an obstacle to clear thinking
about who you are and where
you're headed," he said.
Lyman said he rejects the
idea oi a "Me Gent ration", but
thinks there are '"Me Eras,* pe
riods of national self
centeredness that inevitably af
fect young as well as old. Na
tions, like individuals, get weary
from time to time. Societies, like
people, can lose confidence in

their ability to copc with stub
born difficulties or problems of
great complexity.
"In such periods it is tempting
to limit oneself, consciously or
unconsciously, to activities and
interests that one can readily
grasp, problems that seem likely
to have solutions, though the
problems themselves may be of
minor importance in the long
scheme of things.
"There's even a whole theory
put forth by some psychologists
urging us to adopt a strategy of
trying for small wins. Big
lefeats can leave people
lemoralized without the neces
lary minimum confidence to try
urther. Small wins operate in
he opposite way."
Lyman then pointed out the
law in the theory. "Settling for
mall wins, limiting oneself to
jroblems in one's own back
ward, or one's own profession or
jusiness, will mean that the
ireat overarching problems are
eft by default to somebody
:lse," he said.
"The only people left to deal
vith nuclear war or hunger in
lub-Saharan Africa or acid rain
ivill be those whose very roles in
Society require that they deal
*ith them. If the rest of us leave
them to do what they like,
.maided and also unhindered by
sur advice and participation, we
rannot reasonably expect happy
outcomes," Lyman said.
He then encouraged the
graduates to try to deal with the
arge problems that society faces

today. "We need a blend of
rationality with disciplined exer
cise of the imagination, an abil
ity to learn from experience, yet
also to transcend it. We must be
able to see both the uniqueness
of our situation — the human
race has never had to grapple
with the question of its own sur
vival so directly — and our rela
tion to the human past," he said.
Lyman then described a dis
play at the American Museum
of Natural History in New York
called "Ancestors: Four Million
Years of Humanity" which
features the bones of the earliest
humans. Describing the experi
ence, Lyman said, "Such experi
ences do not tell us how to cope.
They do suggest that coping has
been one of mankind's most en
during characteristics."
Lyman concluded by saying,
"May your own coping skills
stand you in good stead as you
pursue life after Stanford. Bet
ter still, may you find fulfill
ment, even a certain exhilara
tion, in meeting the problems of
our age head-on, the huge and
frightful ones as much as the

small and manageable. As John
Mason Brown put it in a sen
tence much quoted from plat
forms such as this — and for
good reason: "The only true
happiness comes from squan
dering ourselves for a pur
pose.'"
Kennedy, in his farewell
speech, told the graduates,
"Most of what has been hap
pening to you here , 1 think.

If you're that worried about the
repercussions of honesty, get yourself a
Doberman.

represents not what we have
taught you (though my faculty
colleagues and I would be proud
to stake that claim), but the un
folding, under especially favor
able circumstances, of capacities
that were already there."
Kennedy talked about the op
portunities that the graduates
had and told them, "It is impor
tant to keep asking yourself
whether you are living up to the

responsibility your opportuni
ties have created for you."
Kennedy emphasized that
education is not a "free pass",
quoting Casey Stengel, who
said, "... say you're educated,
and you can't throw strikes,
then they don't leave you in too
long."
Kennedy went on to say,
"You are likely some time to
have to decide whether or not to

serve in some leadership role. I
hope you will accept that chal
lenge, even if it looks a little
scary. The prospect of public
failure and humiliation is daunt
ing and full of risks, but the
rewards are great."
Kennedy then urged the
graduates to be willing to be
candid. He quoted the Boston
Celtics" Cedric "Cornbread"
Maxwell, who said, "If you're

that worried about the repercus
sions of honesty, you should get
a Doberman."
Kennedy concluded,
"Yuppiedom does not conduce
to a world view, and neither
does it conduce to a realistic
view of the heart of America.
This is a great, splendid, diverse
country. Its soul is not centered
in the practice of law or
medicine, nor in the pursuit of
national fads so wide that it can
simultaneously encompass
nouvelle cuisine, break dancing
and Monday Night Football.
"Its soul resides, rather, in
some awkwardly-expressed set
of values that blends a deep
commitment to communities of
manageable size with an equally
deep respect for the dignity of
the individual. It you lose touch
with that, you better go back
and find it."
Prior to his farewell, Kennedy
had conferred degrees to the
graduates. The actual presenta
tion of diplomas occurred at
dozens of smaller departmental
ceremonies after the Sunken
Diamond ccremonv.
