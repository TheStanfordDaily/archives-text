## Quality returns to the Stanford Theater 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
Ever since his days as a Stan
ford undergraduate during the
mid-70s, Charles Duggan has
dreamed of bringing big-time
theater to Palo Alto.
After successfully managing
the Marines Memorial Theater
in San Francisco for two years,
Duggan took on an even greater
challenge this spring, when he
announced a new subscription
series of three shows at Palo
Alto's Stanford Theater.
Although the Stanford is 59
years old, its stage has been
empty for most of the last 50
years. A brief run of "Talley's
Folly" last summer was Dug
gan's first experiment with
reviving live theater here. The
show did well at the box office,
Duggan said, but still lost
$15,000 due to high expenses.
The Stanford's curtain rose
for a production of "Crimes of
the Heart." Beth Henley's
Pulitzer Prize-winning play, in
early May.
"Crimes" was a success by
most artistic standards. Enthusi
astic reviews and favorable
word of mouth led to an in

crease in attendance over the
course of the show's run.
Allan Ulrich of the San Fran
cisco Examiner called it "a pro
duction of considerable wit and
delicacy," and added, "until . . .
the play closes, Palo Alto may
just be the luckiest theater town
in the Bay Area."
But good reviews and enthu
siastic audiences weren't
enough. "Crimes" needed to
average $50,000 in revenues
per week to break even, and the
first week brought in only
$9000 at the box office, accord
ing to Duggan.
Although business increased
during each of the final three
weeks of the engagement,
"Crimes" lost approximately
$120,000 during its four-week
run.
"Greater Tuna," the Stan
ford's second show this year,
opened June 14 and will run
through July 22.
Attendance for the show has
exceeded Duggan's projections
and continues to increase, but
revenues are still running short
of the $50,000 weekly break
even point.
The Stanford Theater has a

long and tumultuous history in
Palo Alto.
The June 8, 1925 edition of
the Palo Alto Times was a spe
cial issue entirely devoted to the
opening of the brand new
theater.
"Beautiful Structure Em
bodies Best Features in Building
and Equipment," declared one
headline. Others read,
"$300,000 Amusement House
is One of First in State," and
"Public is Assured of High Class
Programs."
But despite such backing, live
theater did not thrive at the new
theater.
Stage productions were
replaced by movies in the late
'20s, when the advent of the
talkies revolutionized the mo
tion picture industry.
By 1 974, the theater could no
longer support first-run movies.
The Stanford closed that year,
and has been gathering dust
ever since.
Several unsuccessful efforts
were made to revive the Stan
ford during the late '70s and
early '80s.
By the late '70s, its once
plush interior had decayed so

severely that hundreds of
thousands of dollars would have
been required for restorations.
In 1977 real estate developer
Ryland Kelley, purchased the
theater, and the Stanford Com
munity Theater Foundation was
established to manage it and
raise money for renova
tions.The building was trans
formed into a nonprofit commu
nity performing arts center.
The foundation's fundraising
efforts were unsuccessful
however. In March of last year,
Kelley assumed management of
the theater, and sank more than
a quarter of a million dollars
into debt.
Soon afterward, the Stanford
reopened with several jazz con
certs and regular showings of
second-run films at bargain
prices.
Following the brief run of
"Talley's Folly" last summer,
second-run movies returned to
the theater and stayed there for
almost a year.
In early spring, Duggan an
nounced a series of three
productions, beginning with
"Crimes," that would have kept
live theater booked at the Stan

ford until fall.
"The commitment is there
from us," he said at the time.
"Now we have to find out if
Palo Alto likes us."
But problems quickly
surfaced.
Two of the three shows in the
original subscription series were
cancelled.
The first, "A Coupla White
Chicks Sitting Around
Talking," was to have starred
Elizabeth Ashley.
"White Chicks" would have
given the Stanford the big-name
star it needed to attract
audiences.
Trouble soon appeared, Dug
gan said, when Ashley
threatened to withdraw because
she disapproved of her co-star.
The show was postponed
several times. Ashley was
replaced by Sandy Duncan, and
Duggan finally decided to drop
the entire production.
The second show, "Taking
My Turn," a musical which
would have starred Sheila
Mcßae, was dropped when
Mcßae left the cast and Duggan
became concerned about the
