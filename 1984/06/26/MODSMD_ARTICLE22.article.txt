## 'Greater Tuna'â€” A tall teasing Texas tale 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
Greater Tuna,' the new production at the
Stantord Theater, is 90 minutes of rollicking
humor and down-home tun.
Set in 1 una, Texas, the third-smallest town in
the Lone Star State, "Greater Tuna" is the story
of a small town tilled with small minds, where
bigotry and backwardness are taken for granted.
While most of the laughs come at the expense
of Tuna and its 20 citizens, the show's venomous
barbs are balanced by an offbeat quality and mo
ments of gentleness.
It's "Main Street'" transplanted to Texas, with
an extra dose of malevolence thrown in for good
measure.
Like Garrison Keillor s Lake Wobegon on
public radio's "Prairie Home Companion," Tuna
is a town that time forgot, where eccentrics act out
their fantasies in blissful isolation from the outside
world.
Mrs. Bertha Bumiller, a leader of both The Bet
ter Baptist Bureau and Citizens for Fewer Blacks
in Literature, believes "Roots" should be banned
because "it presents only one side of the slavery
issue."
The local radio station, OKKK, is sponsored by
DiDi's Used Weapons, which guarantees "If
DiDi's can't kill it, it's immortal."
The only phrases taught in Tuna's bilingual
education program are "Where can I cash a
traveller's check? "Please send a boy up for my
luggage," and "That's not what I ordered."
I he show has little or no discernible plot.
Instead of a narrative, it presents 12 slices of
daily life in Tuna.
All 20 characters (19 humans and a dog) are
played by the Laurel and Hardy team of Michael
Jeter and Ron Lee Savin.
Jeter, the slight one, plays Humane Society
spokesman Petey Fisk, munitions merchant Didi
Snavely, three members of the Bumiller family

and five other disparate misfits.
The stout Savin portrays fearsome Aunt Pearl
Burras, UFO afticionado R.R. Snavely, Reverend
Spikes of the book-snatching squad, Yippy the
dog and six others.
Both give memorable performances.
Jeter is a master of the quick costume change,
but more importantly, he manages to create
unique personalities for each of his characters.
It is somewhat incongruous to see children and
teenagers portrayed by a balding man, but Jeter
pulls it off.
When, as Petey Fisk, he says, "Fish feel pain;
they re just very, very subtle about expressing it,"
you believe him.
Savin does more than just alter his walk and
change his accent when he switches gears and
costumes. Although many of his roles are more
caricatures than characters, he makes them con
vincing.
The production has several flaws, however.
The two-character play seems better suited to a
smaller theater. Both Jeter and Savin have good
stage presence, but the nuances of their perfor
mances were lost to those in the rear of the caver
nous 1252-seat auditorium.
More importantly, the extensive renovations
the theater has undergone do not seem to have
improved the sound system. Although the actors
voices were clear and carried well, the taped back
ground music and recorded voices were often
obscured by an annoying hum.
1 he distortion was never bad enough to render
words inaudible, but it was consistently distracting
and served as a frequent reminder that the play
did not really take place in Tuna, Texas, but in a
59-year-old theater that is feeling its age.
But despite these problems, "Greater Tuna'" is
a thoroughly enjoyable evening of theater. Its mo
ments of maliciousness are outnumbered by its
frequent scenes of deliciousness.


Ron Lee Savin, as Aunt Pearl Burras, and Michael Jeter
as Vera Carp are the stars of "Greater Tuna."
