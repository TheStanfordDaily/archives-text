## Jackson holds talks 
### 
Havana, Cuba (AP) — Cuban President Fidel Castro
greeted the Rev. Jesse Jackson at the Havana airport
last night and, speaking through an interpreter, said the
visit could "possibly" improve U.S.-Cuban relations.
Jackson was on the third day of his five-day Latin
American trip. He arrived here from El Salvador,
where he had met with guerrilla leaders who offered to
begin cease-fire talks immediately with EI Salvador's
president, Jose Napoleon Duarte.
But there apparently was not a positive response
from the Salvadoran president, Jose Napoleon Duarte,
despite the guerrillas' offer to come to the capital city of
San Salvador as early as yesterday to begin negotia
tions.
Duarte has demanded that the guerrillas put down
their arms as a condition for such talks. But Ruben
/amora, leader and spokesman for the guerrillas, said
they were unwilling to do so.
He told reporters the guerrillas were prepared to
begin their talks at that time at the Costa Rican em
bassy. Costa Rica has offered its embassy in San Sal
vador as the site for such talks, Jackson said.
Duarte praised Jackson's "moral offensive" after
Jackson conveyed to him the offer from Salvadoran
guerrilla leaders to talk about a cease-fire, but said
there was nothing new in Jackson's concept or
presentation.
