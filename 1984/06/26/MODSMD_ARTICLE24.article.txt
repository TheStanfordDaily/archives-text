### 
(AP) — Walter Mondale, taking major strides
toward uniting the Democratic Party behind him, won a
promise yesterday from presidential rival Gary Hart
not to raise a divisive delegate challenge at the national
convention and gained a long-sought endorsement
from Sen. Edward Kennedy.
The two men agreed to meet in New York today, al
though they decided in advance not to discuss the vice
presidential nomination.
Aides said the planned Mondale-Hart meeting as
well as the agreement on rules and credentials issues
was brokered bv Kennedy, who had remained neutral

in this year's race after pressing his challenge to Jimmy
Carter and Mondale all the way to the Democratic na
tional convention four years ago.
In a letter to Democratic Chairman Charles Manatt,
Hart said he would stay in the race for the top spot on
the Democratic ticket but promised no action that
would divide or embitter the party's national conven
tion.
Mondale agreed to accept parts of a "democracy
package" of suggested rules changes Hart wants for
1988, including a reduction in the number of unpledged
party officials who will serve as delegates and a cut in
the primary or caucus vote — the threshold a candidate
must receive to qualify for delegates. .
Aides to Mondale and Hart said negotiations were
continuing on other issues.
Hart and Mondale aides met with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's supporters late yesterday to discuss revisions
in the rules.
