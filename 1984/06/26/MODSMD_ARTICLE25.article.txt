Geneva, Switzerland (AP) â€” The United States said
yesterday that it would cut off millions of dollars in aid
to the U.N. Fund for Population Activities unless the
agency guarantees the money is not used for programs
subsidizing or advocating abortion.
A source who spoke on condition the information
not be attributed in any way said "an accommodation
has been reached" in which the United States would
continue its funding, but only for programs in nations
where abortion was not practiced as a form of popula
tion control.
The warning, delivered by Undersecretary of State
Gregory Newell in a speech at a meeting of the U.N.
Fund for Population Activities, came after reports the
Reagan administration wants to cut such aid because of
its anti-abortion views.
The source, familiar with the Newell speech and the
population agency, said the Development Program had
worked out the accommodation with U.S. officials. The
source did not give further details of the accord.
The U.S. mission to the United Nations said the
United States contributes $38 million annually to the
population fund, but could not say what percentage of

the agency's annual budget this was. It also did not give
figures for U.S. aid to other population control
agencies.
