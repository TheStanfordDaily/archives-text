Munich, West Germany (AP) — The United States
and the Soviet Union clashed yesterday over the nu
clear arms buildup at the start of a major East-West
conference on air pollution.
Representatives of the Soviet Union and three of its
Hast European allies — East Germany, Poland and
Hungary — said the arms race is damaging to the envi
ronment.
Soviet delegation leader Yuri Israel said the confer
ence should regard disarmament as another way of
protecting the environment.
U.S. delegation leader William D. Ruckelshaus said
he also favored arms cutbacks, but he criticized the
Soviets for bringing up the subject at a meeting organ
ized by West Germany to encourage international
cooperation in reducing acid rain.
Ruckelshaus also said the United States is ready to
resume nuclear arms talks with the Soviet Union at any
time in a proper forum.
The Soviets walked out of arms reduction talks in
Geneva last year after the NATO alliance began
deploying new nuclear missiles in Western Europe.
Israel's comments were echoed by the leader of the
East German delegation, Hans Reichelt, who said there
is a "direct connection" between disarmament and en
vironmental protection.
Money for ecological measures is often lacking be
cause it has been spent on arms, Reichelt said.
The Soviet Union and East Germany accepted
Canada's suggestion that nations try to reduce emis
sions of sulfur dioxide from coal-burning power plants
by 30 percent within the next decade.
The United States continued to oppose the sugges
tion despite pressure from Canada.
The Americans do not feel enough research has been
done to warrant singling out sulfur dioxide for such
large cutbacks, Philip Angell, an assistant to Ruckel
shaus, said.
