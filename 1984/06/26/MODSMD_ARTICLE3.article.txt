### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
Both Medical School Dean
Dominick Purpura and Depart
ment of Medicine Chairman
Kenneth Melmon have resigned
their positions, leaving the
school with four major
vacancies in its academic leader
ship.

Melmon resigned June 3 after
the Medical School's Commit

"grossly negligent scholarship."
[University President Donald
[Kennedy then sent him a letter

the University," but added, "In

chairman), I do not believe any
action beyond this letter of
censure is appropriate."
In a June 6 statement, Mel

to resign as department chair
man rather than allow the affair
to blow up into a giant con

past five years."
Purpura's resignation came

Both men will retain their fac
