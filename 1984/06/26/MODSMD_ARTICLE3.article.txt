### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
Both Medical School Dean
Dominick Purpura and Depart
ment of Medicine Chairman
Kenneth Melmon have resigned
their positions, leaving the
school with four major
vacancies in its academic leader
ship.

Melmon resigned June 3 after
the Medical School's Commit
tee on Ethical Scientific Perfor
mance said he was guilty of
"grossly negligent scholarship."
[University President Donald
[Kennedy then sent him a letter
lot censure.
While the committee con
cluded that Melmon's work was
■ seriously out of conformity
ivith professional standards," it
Concluded that no fraud had
T»een committed and said he
Bhad no conscious intent to
deceive."
Hln his letter, Kennedy said
Hrour conduct was a serious

departure from the high stand
ards of scholarship required by
the University," but added, "In
light of your resignaton (as
chairman), I do not believe any
action beyond this letter of
censure is appropriate."
In a June 6 statement, Mel
mon said, "I realized that I had
to resign as department chair
man rather than allow the affair
to blow up into a giant con
frontation . . . that would in
evitably weaken or destroy the
work that I have done over the
past five years."
Purpura's resignation came
nine days later, but was not
believed to be related to the
Melmon case.
The dean said he resigned be
cause of his desire to devote
more time to his research.
Both men will retain their fac
ulty positions. The Melmon res
ignation will take effect July 31,
while Purpura will leave the
dean's office August 31.
Two other leadership posts
are vacant at the Medical
School. Leßoy Heinrichs
resigned as chairman of gyne
cology and obstetrics last Janu
ary, and Philip Larson stepped
down as chairman of the anes
thesia department in December,
1982.
Heinrichs also cited a desire
to return to research as the rea
son for his resignation. His
departure followed a dispute
over a memo he wrote last sum
mer that criticized a chief resi


Dominick Purpura
dent's request for pregnancy
leave.
The investigation of Mel
mon's conduct concerned
charges that he used unat
tributed copyrighted material
from a hook that he helped edit
in a chapter he wrote for an
other textbook.
He was an associate editor of
the sixth edition of Goodman
and Oilman's "The Phar
macological Basis of
Therapeutics," published in
1980, and wrote a chapter in the
sixth edition of Williams'
"Textbook of Endocrinology,"
published in 1981.
Melmon freely admitted that
he copied the materials "nearly
verbatim with some minor
editing for style." But he in
sisted that he had intended to
use them only with permission
and attribution.
He said Williams, the editor
of the endocrinology text, asked
him to include details from the
forthcoming Goodman and Gil
man book.
Melmon said he was not in
terested in doing this, but
agreed after Williams insisted.
He said he agreed to use the
material only if Williams ob
tained permission from its aut
hors.

Williams died before the
book was completed and ap
parently never requested
permission to use the material.
Melmon said he did not learn
that permission had not been
obtained until February of this
year, when he received a call
from the editor of the Goodman
and Gilman text.
Reflecting on his resignation

yesterday, Melmon said "It may
make me a better person and it
will certainly give me more time
to spend on my faculty work "
He thanked his faculty col
leagues for supporting him
during a difficult period, and
added, "You can never put it
behind you, but you have to
decide whether to let a mistake
rule your life."

Melmon said he believed
Kennedy's censure was un
necessary.
"It's clear that an error was
made, but there's nothing to be
gained by censure. It was
unneeded and didn't add to the
story.
Melmon said he didn't know
whether his case had any influ
ence on Purpura's decision.
