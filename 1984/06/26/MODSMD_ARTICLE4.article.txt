# Labor hearing postponed
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
A June 20 State Labor Commission show cause
hearing was postponed until sometime in July by
deputy labor commission Ray Brady. The hearing
concerned Stanford University's refusal to deduct
union dues from employees' wages and pay them
to United Stanford Workers, Local 680 of the
Service Employees International Union (SEIU).
According to USW President Linda Crouse, the
dues are part of employee benefits which are re
quired by law to be deducted.
According to Stanford legal counsel Priscilla
Wheeler, Stanford will not withold dues for Local
680 because they still cannot recognize 680 as
Stanford's union. The controversy stems from the
decision of Local 715, Stanford's former Union,
to disaffiliate from the University in February and
name Local 680 as Stanford's acting union.

Wheeler said at the time that Stanford could
not recognize 680 without a proper election; an
election was held on April IS which the Univer
sity refused to recognize because 715 was not on
the ballot. Since then, the University and USW
have filed charges against one another; USW
charging Stanford with failure to withold em
ployee benefits and Stanford charging 715 with
abandoning its constituency and 680 with holding
an improper election.
USW had filed a criminal complaint with the
State Labor Relations Board at the urging of the
Board. The hearing was scheduled by deputy
labor commission Ray Galvez, and according to
Crouse it was in Galvez' absence that the hearing
was postponed through Stanford's intervention.
"While Galvez was out of the
office on a vacation day, the
University got someone who
had no knowledge of the situa
tion to postpone the hearing,"
she said. "When Galvez got
back, he was intent on res
cheduling — especially in light
of what Stanford did. The Uni
versity abused the authority of
the person who scheduled the
hearing.
Wheeler said that although

the Labor Comission office gave
no specific reason for postpon
ing the hearing, the University
had sent the Commission a let
ter explaining that they felt the
hearing was inappropiate.
"The National Labor Rela
tions Board has scheduled a
hearing on this matter in Sep
tember/' she said, "and they
have pre-emptive jurisdiction."
Wheeler said that her office had
not heard about the hearing un
til four or five days before it was
scheduled; they sent a letter im
mediately and attempted to
reach Galvez, but could only
reach Brady.

"We just went through some
one who was supposed to be
Galvez' supervisor," she said,
"When you work through these
offices, these things happen all
of the time."
Crouse said that although the
University claimed that the
NLRB had pre-emptive juris
diction over the State Labor
Commission, the University was
actually up against two different
kinds of charges.
"The complaint filed with the
NLRB is essentially a civil
charge, she said "but these are
criminal charges — they could

result in a fine or imprisonment
for the offending parties." This,
she explained, was why two sep
arate hearings were necessary.
The union dues which the
Universtiy refuses to deduct are
presently being collected by
hand; there were several booths
around campus last Friday
(payday), and union members
have been approached individu
ally. According to Crouse, the
collection is going better than
was previously hoped. "There
are still some bugs in the system,
but generally people are pretty
sympathetic and willing to help
out," she said.
