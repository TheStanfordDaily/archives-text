# Labor hearing postponed
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
A June 20 State Labor Commission show cause
hearing was postponed until sometime in July by
deputy labor commission Ray Brady. The hearing
concerned Stanford University's refusal to deduct
union dues from employees' wages and pay them
to United Stanford Workers, Local 680 of the
Service Employees International Union (SEIU).
According to USW President Linda Crouse, the
dues are part of employee benefits which are re
quired by law to be deducted.
According to Stanford legal counsel Priscilla
Wheeler, Stanford will not withold dues for Local
680 because they still cannot recognize 680 as
Stanford's union. The controversy stems from the
decision of Local 715, Stanford's former Union,
to disaffiliate from the University in February and
name Local 680 as Stanford's acting union.

Wheeler said at the time that Stanford could
not recognize 680 without a proper election; an
election was held on April IS which the Univer
sity refused to recognize because 715 was not on
the ballot. Since then, the University and USW
have filed charges against one another; USW
charging Stanford with failure to withold em
ployee benefits and Stanford charging 715 with
abandoning its constituency and 680 with holding
an improper election.
USW had filed a criminal complaint with the
State Labor Relations Board at the urging of the
Board. The hearing was scheduled by deputy
labor commission Ray Galvez, and according to
Crouse it was in Galvez' absence that the hearing
was postponed through Stanford's intervention.
