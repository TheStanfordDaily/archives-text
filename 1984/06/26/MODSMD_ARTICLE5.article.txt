# Heart/lung patient receives No. 2
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
Charles Walker, the second
person to receive a heart-lung
transplant at Stanford Medical
Center, was given a second
transplant June 17, and is
"alive, alert and in good
spirits," according to Med Cen
ter spokesman Mike Goodkind.
This is the first time a heart
and lungs have been replaced
twice in a single patient.
Walker, who received his first
operation in May of 1981, was
hospitalized April 20 after he
began to reject the initial
transplant. Stuart Jamieson,
head of Stanford's heart/lung
transplant program, said that
Walker had been placed on a
respirator because his lungs
were damaged beyond use.
The demand for heart/lung
has always been higher than the
supply of donors, and according

to Goodkind this year Stanford
has had fewer donors than
usual. But the decision to re
transplant Walker was an easy
one, Goodkind explained.
"Hospitals have a commit
ment to provide ongoing care
for their present patients," he
said. "Walker was already
hospitalized, and this was an op
eration that could save his life.
It would have been illogical to
transplant an entirely new pa
tient."
Even so, doctors admit that
Walker has a tougher road to
recovery than a patient after
their initial transplant. The sur
gery itself, which lasted eight
hours, was complicated by the
scar tissue left over from the
previous operation, which could
potentially have caused more
post-operative bleeding. And
Walker's body, wearied by the

rejection of his second set of
lungs, is now more vulnerable.
An unusual aspect of the re
jection was that Walker's
second heart remained un
damamged even after the lungs


Charles Walker
were rejected. It was previously
theorized that rejection would
only occur in tandem. However,
according to Jamieson, studies
on lab animals had shown that
rejection of only one organ was
possible, if not probable, and
this enabled doctors to diagnose
Walker's condition.
Both Walker's heart and
lungs were replaced because a
lung transplant is not a feasible
operation, Goodkind said. "It
would mean he would have
body parts from two different
people; it was just not a consid
eration," he said.
According to Med Center
press spokesman Mary
Campbell, Walker is presently
breathing without the aid of a
respirator. "He has a tracheos
tomy collar which provides him
with oxygen through a hole in
his throat," she explained.
