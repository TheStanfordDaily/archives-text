## Discovery's first flight Computer errors delay shuttle launch 
### 
Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP) â€”
The debut of America's new
space shuttle Discovery was
delayed yesterday by the failure
of an on-board backup com
puter, but NASA replaced it
and aimed for a morning launch
today, despite a forbidding wea
ther forecast.
Liftoff was reset for 5:43 a.m.
PDT.
Mission managers decided to
gamble on the weather, saying
"the current forecast indicates
rain showers and a cloud cover
associated with a frontal system
moving through the area may

clear by launch time.'"
However, NASA had the op
tion of changing its mind until
late last night when a half
million gallons of supercold liq
uid fuel were to begin flowing
into the shuttle's tank.
If the weather over the Ken
nedy Space Center looked
ominous, the tanking would not
begin, and a delay of more than
one hour in the start of fueling
would force a postponement un
til at least tommorow, said Jim
Ball, a NASA spokesman.
Ball said technicians had con
firmed that a replacement corn

puter, cannibalized from the
shuttle Challenger and installed
in Discovery during a pounding
thunderstorm yesterday after
noon, was working well. He said
NASA had "confidence that the
anomaly that occurred this morn
ing is well understood.
Air Force forecasters said
conditions would be marginal,
with showers possible in the
skies above Kennedy Space
Center. At midafternoon yes
terday, storms hit the Cape just
as workers were replacing the
errant computer that halted yes
terday morning's countdown to

liftoff.
The shuttle's crew of six, in
cluding the second woman
named to an American
spaceflight and the first com
mercial astronaut, had endured
three hours lying on their backs
Monday morning in Discovery's
cabin. Disappointment was
etched on their faces as they
climbed out.
The countdown clock stood at
nine-minutes-to-go when
launch control spokesman Mark
Hess announced: "We will
scrub for the day." A suitcase
sized backup computer had

failed to duplicate commands
from four primary computers.
The backup computer, con
sisting of two pieces two feet
long and 10 inches square, had
failed to engage when ordered
to run parallel witlf the primary
system.
"When we attempted to turn
on the machine we had a hard
ware failure, some electronic
component failing," said Carroll
Dawson, deputy manager of
shuttle avionics. The computer,
which cost $1.2 million, went
