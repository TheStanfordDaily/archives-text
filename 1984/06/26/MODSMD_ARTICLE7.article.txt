Washington (AP) — Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, pushing for
either Gary Hart or a woman as
the Democrats' vice presidential
nominee, said Sunday she envi
sions a floor fight at the national
convention next month if Wal
ter Mondale chooses anyone
else.

The Colorado congress
woman, who is co-chair of
Hart's campaign, stopped short
of stating flatly that she prefers
Hart to a woman on the ticket
with Mondale.
But questioned on that point
on CBS-TV's "Face The Na
tion" program, Schroeder

said: "I am a little biased. I
think Gary would bring a lot to
the ticket."
In Minnesota, Mondale met
Sunday with Judy Goldsmith,
president of the National Or
ganization for Women, and they
discussed, among other things,
the strength a woman would add

to the Democratic ticket.
Mondale press secretary
Maxine Isaacs said
Goldsmith "made a very strong
case about why she thought a
woman would be an advan
tage."
Hart, in Washington, told

reporters he was interested in
discussing with Schroeder her
recent suggestion that he should
consider announcing a woman
as his choice for a running mate
on a Hart ticket before the con
vention.
"I haven't had a chance to
talk to her," he said."
