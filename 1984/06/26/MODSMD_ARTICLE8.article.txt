# Rallies mark occasion
## Gays remember riots

(AP) â€” Lesbians and
homosexual men rallied in
several cities Sunday to demon
strate the "political muscle"
that participants said was
needed to combat the repres
sion symbolized by 1969's so
called "Stonewall Rebellion."
In San Francisco, a crowd of
100,000, led by a squadron of
leather-clad lesbians on motor
cycles, turned out for the 13th
Lesbian-Gay Freedom Day
Parade.
New York City's 15th annual
Gay Pride parade was a typical
mixture of partying, politics and
protest, with a controversy in
volving the Catholic Church as a
backdrop.
The New York marchers ob
tained a city permit allowing a
brief stop at St. Patrick's Cathe
dral. In past years, they made
unauthorized detours past the
church, the base of New York's
Catholic Archdiocese.
Thousands of gay men and
women chanted "Shame!" as
they passed the cathedral, and
called on Archbishop John J.
O'Connor to sign a pledge
against homosexual discrimina
tion.
A group of gay Catholics
belonging to a group called Dig
nity set out a wreath at the
church symbolizing their grief
over O'Connor's refusal to sign
the pledge, which is required by

the city for any organization
with city social service contracts.
Mayor Edward Koch said
O'Connor's refusal to sign the
order pledging not to dis
criminate against gays would
cost the church about $76 mil
lion in city contracts. The issue
is pending in court.
After saying mass in Central
Park, O'Connor was asked if he
had any message for the mar
chers.
"I bear them no malice
whatever and I hope that they
recognize that my responsibility
as a bishop is to teach the teach
ings of the Catholic church."
In San Francisco, some 200
"Dykes on Bikes," sporting
tattoos, leather pants, multi
colored hair and roses on their
motorcycle handlebars led the
parade from the Embarcadero
to City Hall.
Konstantin Berlandt, presi
dent of the Freedom Day board
of directors, said waning sup
port for the gay community had
been bolstered recently by Cali
fornia Gov. George Deuk
mejian's veto in March of a gay
rights bill, an increase in the
number of cases of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome,
and the proposed closure of the
gay bathhouses in San Fran
cisco.
"I feel we're being thrown a
curve ball in the commnity . . .

but we're coming back. We're
all out here together. It's a point
to look forward to rather than
slipping back," said Berlandt,
who was dressed in a two-piece
dress with blue sequins, plastic
high heels and a woman's wig.
The parade, with the theme
"Unity and More in '84,"
featured gay parents with their
children, lesbian doctors, the
Gay American Indian Associa
tion, four AIDS organizations,
baton twirlers, pom pon girls
and pom pon boys.
The parades began in com
memoration of the "Stonewall
Rebellion" rioting that broke
out on June 28, 1969, when
police raided the Stonewall Inn,
a gay bar in Greenwich Village
in New York City.
It became "a symbol of resis
tance to repression of gays and
lesbians," said Berlandt.
About 150 people marched in
Des Moines on Saturday to kick
off Gay and Lesbian Freedom
Week, and about 300 people
took part in Hartford, Conn.'s
third annual Lesbian and Gay
Pride Festival, organizers said.
In Chicago, former Mayor
Jane Byrne joined more than
30,000 marchers at the Gay
Pride Week parade, while in
Seattle, several hundred gay
people turned out to call for an
end to job discrimination and
for a cure for AIDS.
