### 
Washington (AP) — The
sponsors of landmark im
migration legislation said
Sunday they think the House
and Senate can resolve their
differences and enact a com
promise hill before the No
vember elections.
But one. Sen. Alan K.
Simpson. R-Wyo., said the
measure could be in trouble
if too many opponents of the
proposal are named to the
joint conference committee
that will attempt to work out
the differences.
"We can get it through
conference if we get an
honest conference commit
tee," Simpson said during an
appearance with his co
sponsor, Rep. Romano Maz
zoli, D-Ky., on NBC-TV's
"Meet the Press."
Simpson said he was espe
cially wary of the House con
ferees, including foes from
the Education and Labor
Committee chaired by Rep.
Carl Perkins, D-Ky. He
called them a "tough bunch"
of negotiators.
"When you get into a con
ference committee with Carl
Perkins, you may end up not
having any furniture left in
your office," the senator

said. "He's awesome. I don't
want to have him in there.
He's never been in favor of it
(the legislation) anyway."
Asked whether a compro
mise could be steered
through Congress by No
vember, Mazzoli replied, "I
think we can." No date nas
been set for the start of
deliberations.
Mazzoli noted that the
Senate and House versions
of the bill contain different
language providing for am
nesty for some illegal aliens
and fines for employers who
knowingly hire undocu
mented workers. But he said
he thought the differences on
those key points were "very
well adjustable."
A major gap between the
two bills involves the ques
tion of allowing "guest
workers'' into the United
States temporarily to harvest
perishable crops.
The Senate was silent on
this point. The House added
an amendment to allow
hundreds of thousands of
such workers to enter the
country annually.
