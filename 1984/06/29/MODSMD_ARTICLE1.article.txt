## Morales sets second world record of trials 
### 
From the Associated Press
Stanford sophomore Pablo
Morales set the second world
record at the U.S. Olympic
Swimming Trials in Indianapolis
Tuesday, posting a 53.38-
second clocking in the men's
100-meter butterfly.
Morales' winning time broke
the American and world record
of 53.44 set by Matt Gribble of
the University of Miami last
August. Gribble, the 1982
world champion who has been
slowed by a back injury,
finished second to Morales with
a time of 54.07. Both qualified

for the Olympic team.
Morales, like all the other
qualifiers, is thrilled at making
the U.S. Olympic swimming
team. It's just that he doesn't
show it.
"This is a stepping stone (to
the Olympic Games in Los An
geles). If I appear to be non
chalant, it's just because I'm an
easygoing person," Morales
said, a big grin on his face.
"Really, I'm very excited about
it."
Morales on Tuesday became
the second Stanford swimmer to
shatter a world record in two

days of Olympic Trials.
Teammate John Moffet set a
world mark in the men's 100-
meter breaststroke on Monday.
On Tuesday, a third Stanford
swimmer, sophomore Susan
Rapp, set an American record
in the women's 200-meter
breaststroke, and a fourth swim
mer from Stanford, sophomore
Jeff Kostoff, beat American
record-holder Jesse Vassallo for
the top spot in the 400-meter
individual medley.
"We didn't plan it that way,"
Morales, 19, of Santa Clara,
said of the outstanding perfor
mance by Stanford swimmers.
"But we hoped it would happen.
Hopefully, there will be more."
Rapp, who will be 19 next
week, was clocked at 2:31.54 to
break the former American
record of 2:32.41 by Jeanne
Childs, who finished fifth. Kim
Rhodenbaugh was more than
three seconds behind Rapp at
2:34.91.
Rapp said a technique she
learned from sports psychologist
Dr. Thomas Tutko helped her in
setting the record. "I visualize
the whole race in my mind
before 1 start it," she said, "but I
had to try to keep my nerves

from flying all around the place.
The race happened just as I
visualized it."'
Rapp was not overconfident
despite the surprisingly large
margin of victory. "1 don't think
I'm that much better than the
others," she said. "1 just had a
good day."
Kostoff, the American record
holdei in the 800-freestyle, won
the 400-meter individual med
ley at 4:21.37. Vassallo, whose
American record of 4:20.05 was
set six years ago, finished
second.

Moffet's world-record perfor
mance gave him a spot on the
Olympic team, but it was almost
as important that it ended a long
string of second-place finishes
to perennial rival Steve
Lundquist.
"Sure it was frustrating," the
19-year-old junior said of his
five-year pursuit of Lundquist,
whose year-old world record he
broke during Monday's opening
round of Olympic Trials. "But
now, if I'm the favorite, that's

line with me."
Mottet and Lundquist
qualified for next month's
Olympic Games in Los Angeles
with their 1-2 finish on Monday,
the first of six days of competi
tion at the Indiana University
Natatorium. Moffet had a time
of 1:02.13, while Lundquist was
clocked at 1:02.16. The previ
ous world record was 1:02.28,
set by Lundquist at last sum
mers Pan American Games in
Venezuela.
"It was kind of nice having
something physical in front of
mc. It was something to go for,"
said Mottet, who had never
beaten Lundquist in that event

in a major meet. "But I didn't
look at him as a goal. I tried to
think about what I wanted to do
and go out and do it."
Moffet and Rapp also earned
spots in new events yesterday —
Mottet in the men's 200
breaststroke and Rapp in the
women's 100 breaststroke.
Richard Schroeder of Santa
Barbara, the last of the eight
qualifiers in the men's 200
breaststroke, swam in an
outside lane in the final and
sneaked past Moffet in the final
meters to win the event in
2:17.64.
Moffet was only two
hundredths of a second behind
Schroeder in 2:1 7.66.
Tracy Caulkins of Nashville,
Tenn., who won the 400 indi
vidual medley, got another vic
tor) in the 100 breaststroke

with a time of 1:11.23. Rapp,
who set an American record in
the 200 breaststroke, got a 100
breaststroke spot with her
second-place finish in 1:11.39.
The world and American
records by Moffet, Morales and
Rapp have been balanced by
disappointment for Marybeth
Linzmeier, however.
On Tuesday, she finished
third in the women's 200-meter
freestyle in 2:00.56, less than
halt a second behind the winner,
Cynthia Woodhead.
Linzmeier's third-place finish
would have been good enough
to qualify for the Olympic team
every year before 1 984, but the
rules have been changed for the
I.os Angeles games so that each
country is limited to only two
swimmers per event.

meter breaststroke on Monday.
On Tuesday, a third Stanford
swimmer, sophomore Susan
Rapp, set an American record
in the women's 200-meter
breaststroke, and a fourth swim
mer from Stanford, sophomore
Jeff Kostoff, beat American
record-holder Jesse Vassallo for
the top spot in the 400-meter
individual medley.
"We didn't plan it that way,"
Morales, 19, of Santa Clara,
said of the outstanding perfor
mance by Stanford swimmers.
"But we hoped it would happen.
Hopefully, there will be more."
Rapp, who will be 19 next
week, was clocked at 2:31.54 to
break the former American
record of 2:32.41 by Jeanne
Childs, who finished fifth. Kim
Rhodenbaugh was more than
three seconds behind Rapp at
2:34.91.
Rapp said a technique she
learned from sports psychologist
Dr. Thomas Tutko helped her in
setting the record. "I visualize
the whole race in my mind
before 1 start it," she said, "but I
had to try to keep my nerves

from flying all around the place.
The race happened just as I
visualized it."'
Rapp was not overconfident
despite the surprisingly large
margin of victory. "1 don't think
I'm that much better than the
others," she said. "1 just had a
good day."
Kostoff, the American record
holdei in the 800-freestyle, won
the 400-meter individual med
ley at 4:21.37. Vassallo, whose
American record of 4:20.05 was
set six years ago, finished
second.

Moffet's world-record perfor
mance gave him a spot on the
Olympic team, but it was almost
as important that it ended a long
string of second-place finishes
to perennial rival Steve
Lundquist.
"Sure it was frustrating," the
19-year-old junior said of his
five-year pursuit of Lundquist,
whose year-old world record he
broke during Monday's opening
round of Olympic Trials. "But
now, if I'm the favorite, that's

Mottet and Lundquist
qualified for next month's
Olympic Games in Los Angeles
with their 1-2 finish on Monday,
the first of six days of competi
tion at the Indiana University
Natatorium. Moffet had a time
of 1:02.13, while Lundquist was
clocked at 1:02.16. The previ
ous world record was 1:02.28,
set by Lundquist at last sum
mers Pan American Games in
Venezuela.
"It was kind of nice having
something physical in front of
mc. It was something to go for,"
said Mottet, who had never
beaten Lundquist in that event

in a major meet. "But I didn't
look at him as a goal. I tried to
think about what I wanted to do
and go out and do it."
Moffet and Rapp also earned
spots in new events yesterday —
Mottet in the men's 200
breaststroke and Rapp in the
women's 100 breaststroke.
Richard Schroeder of Santa
Barbara, the last of the eight
qualifiers in the men's 200
breaststroke, swam in an
outside lane in the final and
sneaked past Moffet in the final
meters to win the event in
2:17.64.
Moffet was only two
hundredths of a second behind
Schroeder in 2:1 7.66.
Tracy Caulkins of Nashville,
Tenn., who won the 400 indi
vidual medley, got another vic
tor) in the 100 breaststroke

with a time of 1:11.23. Rapp,
who set an American record in
the 200 breaststroke, got a 100
breaststroke spot with her
second-place finish in 1:11.39.
The world and American
records by Moffet, Morales and
Rapp have been balanced by
disappointment for Marybeth
Linzmeier, however.
On Tuesday, she finished
third in the women's 200-meter
freestyle in 2:00.56, less than
halt a second behind the winner,
Cynthia Woodhead.
Linzmeier's third-place finish
would have been good enough
to qualify for the Olympic team
every year before 1 984, but the
rules have been changed for the
I.os Angeles games so that each
country is limited to only two
swimmers per event.
From the Associated Press
Stanford sophomore Pablo
Morales set the second world
record at the U.S. Olympic
Swimming Trials in Indianapolis
Tuesday, posting a 53.38-
second clocking in the men's
100-meter butterfly.
Morales' winning time broke
the American and world record
of 53.44 set by Matt Gribble of
the University of Miami last
August. Gribble, the 1982
world champion who has been
slowed by a back injury,
finished second to Morales with
a time of 54.07. Both qualified

for the Olympic team.
Morales, like all the other
qualifiers, is thrilled at making
the U.S. Olympic swimming
team. It's just that he doesn't
show it.
"This is a stepping stone (to
the Olympic Games in Los An
geles). If I appear to be non
chalant, it's just because I'm an
easygoing person," Morales
said, a big grin on his face.
"Really, I'm very excited about
it."
Morales on Tuesday became
the second Stanford swimmer to
shatter a world record in two

days of Olympic Trials.
