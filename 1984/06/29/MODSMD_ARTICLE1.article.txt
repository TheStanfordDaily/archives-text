# Rapp, Kostoff also make team
## Morales sets second world record of trials

From the Associated Press
Stanford sophomore Pablo
Morales set the second world
record at the U.S. Olympic
Swimming Trials in Indianapolis
Tuesday, posting a 53.38-
second clocking in the men's
100-meter butterfly.
Morales' winning time broke
the American and world record
of 53.44 set by Matt Gribble of
the University of Miami last
August. Gribble, the 1982
world champion who has been
slowed by a back injury,
finished second to Morales with
a time of 54.07. Both qualified

for the Olympic team.
Morales, like all the other
qualifiers, is thrilled at making
the U.S. Olympic swimming
team. It's just that he doesn't
show it.
"This is a stepping stone (to
the Olympic Games in Los An
geles). If I appear to be non
chalant, it's just because I'm an
easygoing person," Morales
said, a big grin on his face.
"Really, I'm very excited about
it."
Morales on Tuesday became
the second Stanford swimmer to
shatter a world record in two

days of Olympic Trials.
Teammate John Moffet set a
world mark in the men's 100-
meter breaststroke on Monday.
On Tuesday, a third Stanford
swimmer, sophomore Susan
Rapp, set an American record
in the women's 200-meter
breaststroke, and a fourth swim
mer from Stanford, sophomore
Jeff Kostoff, beat American
record-holder Jesse Vassallo for
the top spot in the 400-meter
individual medley.
"We didn't plan it that way,"
Morales, 19, of Santa Clara,
said of the outstanding perfor
mance by Stanford swimmers.
"But we hoped it would happen.
Hopefully, there will be more."
Rapp, who will be 19 next
week, was clocked at 2:31.54 to
break the former American
record of 2:32.41 by Jeanne
Childs, who finished fifth. Kim
Rhodenbaugh was more than
three seconds behind Rapp at
2:34.91.
Rapp said a technique she
learned from sports psychologist
Dr. Thomas Tutko helped her in
setting the record. "I visualize
the whole race in my mind
before 1 start it," she said, "but I
had to try to keep my nerves

from flying all around the place.
The race happened just as I
visualized it."'
Rapp was not overconfident
despite the surprisingly large
margin of victory. "1 don't think
I'm that much better than the
others," she said. "1 just had a
good day."
Kostoff, the American record
holdei in the 800-freestyle, won
the 400-meter individual med
ley at 4:21.37. Vassallo, whose
American record of 4:20.05 was
set six years ago, finished
second.

Moffet's world-record perfor
mance gave him a spot on the
Olympic team, but it was almost
as important that it ended a long
string of second-place finishes
to perennial rival Steve
Lundquist.
"Sure it was frustrating," the
19-year-old junior said of his
five-year pursuit of Lundquist,
whose year-old world record he
broke during Monday's opening
round of Olympic Trials. "But
now, if I'm the favorite, that's
