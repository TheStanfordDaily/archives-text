Consider
the Stadium
I was wrong. I admit it. When
the senior class made their pre
sentations on the site of the
commencement exercises, I was
convinced that the Sunken Dia
mond was the correct choice.
The greenery and more appro- j
priate size seemed then to out-j
weigh the accessibility, facilities,
and sightlines of the Stadium.
After attending the ceremony
last week, however, it became
clear that the Sunken Diamond
was a disaster. The Events and
Services folks did their best, but
a baseball field is really not de
signed to be filled with chairs
facing home plate. The heat was
oppressive, and the tents in the
back were so far away on the
grass level as to be comical.
I am leery of suggesting
moves every year, but it would
seem appropriate that the class
of '85 seriously consider the
stadium, fresh with renovations
for the Super Bowl. They might
even want to consider suggest
ing an afternoon or evening
commencement to escape the
heat. Black robes can be down
right unpleasant, even when
wearing very little underneath
(as Rick Naimark found to Pres
ident Kennedy's mirth this
year). Plenty of other schools
graduate in their stadiums, per
haps Stanford should consider
it.

Registration
is absurd
Is Candid Camera back?
After years of inactivity, it ap
pears the zany old classic has
returned with a routine that
many will consider sheer genius.

Forget the "talking mailbox"
sketch. Forget the "I'm sorry
sir, but New Jersey is closed
today" routine. These old
standards pale in comparison to
what can only be the latest
brainchild of the Alan Funt
legacy, a scenario so funny that
it won't even require a
laughtrack: introducing the
"Summer Registration at Stan
ford (or how to waste five hours
registering for six units of
class)" routine.
During my attempted
registration, I heard many ad
jectives used to describe the
summer registration process.
Some very accurate ones were
mentioned while waiting in line
in Old Union. I spent more than
two hours in these lines so 1 was
able to hear a lot of adjectives.
"Archaic" ranks as one of the
more popular, and certainly one
of the more printable.
I cannot understand how this
campus-wide scavenger hunt for
releases, waivers, stamps-of
approval, and signatures known
as registration has been allowed
to persist at Stanford. The

Registrar must realize that other
learning institutions are able to
register students much more ef
ficiently. In fact, the present sys
tem is more suited to Ripley's

Believe It or Not than to Candid
Camera. Given Stanford's
reputation as premier learning
institution, most people prob
ably wouldn't believe the effort

required to register tor a few
summer classes.
