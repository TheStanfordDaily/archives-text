## Elway, staff instruct 325 youths at camp 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
The annual Stanford Football Camp, a
week-long event running through today,
has taken on a slightly different look this
year as new Head Coach Jack Elway has
taken over the reins. Elway is aided by
Stanford assistants Larry Kerr and Tom
Beckett, as well as 45 other high school
and junior college coaches, in running
the camp for over 325 youths aged 10 to
17.
In addition to the coaches, several
Stanford alumni who have gone on to
play professional football are helping
with the camp, including Denver
Broncos quarterback John Elway, Min
nesota Vikings running back Darrin Nel
son, Dallas Cowboys lineman Pat
Donovan and former 49er great John
Brodie.
One change that Elway has instituted
this year is to include full contact in the
camp. In previous years, the camp
featured non-contact passing instruction.
Elway said the camp began Monday with
fundamental work and has progressed to
skeleton and group work. The highlight
comes today in a series of full-squad
scrimmages in Stanford Stadium.
The players have also received instruc

tion on weight training and running form
as well as nightly lectures from both
alumni and coaches.
The cost of the camp is $275 for board
ers and $175 for day campers. Elway
said the money is mainly used for ex
penses and to pay the staff. "It's pretty
much a non-profit venture," he said.
"We want to put on a quality camp."
The camp also allows Elway and his
staff to identify potential Stanford
players whom they will recruit in future
years. Asked about the camp's effect on
recruiting, Elway replied, "We think it's
going to help a whole lot. We've got to
find athletes who can compete in the
classroom as well as on the field."
The camp enables Elway and the Stan
ford staff to talk with other coaches and
get ideas about the game, some of which
are incorporated into the Stanford pro
gram, the coach said.
The players also benefit from the ex
pertise of- the more than 50 coaches.
They have two workouts each day and
can be seen practicing on Harry Maloney
Field and on the football practice fields
next to Maples Pavilion.
Despite the work, the kids seem to en
joy it. As Elway said, " We're here to ed
ucate, but we're also here to have fun."
