## R.E.M. delivers at Warfield show 
### JOHN PHILLIPS 
To begin with, the ticket
prices for the Bill Graham
presentation of R.E.M. were
typical. The crowd — young, ex
pectant, going for that
"underprivileged bohemian"
look — was typical, the pat
down by the Bill Graham secur
ity staff was unsurprisingly typi
cal as well. The typical Warfield
regulations were in effect: entry
only through the designated
doorway, overpriced alcohol
only in the designated stock
yard, remain in your seats
please and don't dance in the
aisle. Even The Dream Synd
icate, one of my favorite under
ground bands, turned into a
typical opening act. So far, so
typical.
Then R.E.M. took the stage
and put to rest my fears that the
headlining act was doomed to
be as typical as the rest of the
evening had been.
R.E.M. is not as much a band
as it is a mouthpiece for mood
and emotion. The members of
the group do not set out to di
rectly excite the crowd with
politically aware lyrics or hot
guitar licks or inspired rythym
solos. Rather, they evoke a
feeling in the audience, one
which always results in dancing
and singing, smiling and cheer
ing. Their music stirs and
conjures responses indirectly

and effectively. It seems to go
directly to the bones and
muscles which control finger
snapping and toe-tapping,
bypassing ears and brain com
pletely.
R.E.M.'s universal accep
tance by the Warfield crowd
certainly cannot be attributed to
the traditional elements which
make a band popular. Michael
Stipe's lead vocals are largely
indecipherable. The musicians
in the band — Bill Berry on
drums, Pete Buck on guitar, and
Mike Mills on bass — are all
technically proficient but I can
think of a handful of superior
musicians on each of those in
struments. The music is not very
complicated or challenging. But
it happens, it works ... to near
perfection.
Lead singer Stipe was nursing
an injured ankle (bodysurfing
accident) and relied on a crutch
and stool onstage. Thankfully,
the wave did no damage to his
brooding, mysterious voice. The
first song was a slow country
ballad, after which they played
previously released material and
new songs. Their concentration
was on " Reckoning," their most
recently released LP. The back
to-back playing of "Camera"
(from "Reckoning") and "Talk
About the Passion,"" from
1983's "Murmur," was espe
cially moving. Pete Buck's
