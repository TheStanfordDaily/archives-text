## R.E.M. delivers at Warfield show 
### JOHN PHILLIPS 
To begin with, the ticket
prices for the Bill Graham
presentation of R.E.M. were
typical. The crowd — young, ex
pectant, going for that
"underprivileged bohemian"
look — was typical, the pat
down by the Bill Graham secur
ity staff was unsurprisingly typi
cal as well. The typical Warfield
regulations were in effect: entry
only through the designated
doorway, overpriced alcohol
only in the designated stock
yard, remain in your seats
please and don't dance in the
aisle. Even The Dream Synd
icate, one of my favorite under
ground bands, turned into a
typical opening act. So far, so
typical.
Then R.E.M. took the stage
and put to rest my fears that the
headlining act was doomed to
be as typical as the rest of the
evening had been.
R.E.M. is not as much a band
as it is a mouthpiece for mood
and emotion. The members of
the group do not set out to di
rectly excite the crowd with
politically aware lyrics or hot
guitar licks or inspired rythym
solos. Rather, they evoke a
feeling in the audience, one
which always results in dancing
and singing, smiling and cheer
ing. Their music stirs and
conjures responses indirectly

and effectively. It seems to go
directly to the bones and
muscles which control finger
snapping and toe-tapping,
bypassing ears and brain com
pletely.
R.E.M.'s universal accep
tance by the Warfield crowd
certainly cannot be attributed to
the traditional elements which
make a band popular. Michael
Stipe's lead vocals are largely
indecipherable. The musicians
in the band — Bill Berry on
drums, Pete Buck on guitar, and
Mike Mills on bass — are all
technically proficient but I can
think of a handful of superior
musicians on each of those in
struments. The music is not very
complicated or challenging. But
it happens, it works ... to near
perfection.
Lead singer Stipe was nursing
an injured ankle (bodysurfing
accident) and relied on a crutch
and stool onstage. Thankfully,
the wave did no damage to his
brooding, mysterious voice. The
first song was a slow country
ballad, after which they played
previously released material and
new songs. Their concentration
was on " Reckoning," their most
recently released LP. The back
to-back playing of "Camera"
(from "Reckoning") and "Talk
About the Passion,"" from
1983's "Murmur," was espe
cially moving. Pete Buck's

guitar remained crisp and accu
rate, and the soft backing vocals
of Mills and Berry comple
mented their hard-driven bass
and drums nicely.
Stipe occasionally bantered
with the audience. The band
received a very supportive
response when Stipe mentioned
that they had opened the Moun
tain Aire Festival in Calaveras
County that afternoon, and
played in front of 8,000 scream
ing heavy metal fans. "They
thought we sucked," Stipe said.
When the applause diminished,
he added, "Yeah, I guess we
do."
R.E.M. played two encores.
After the first — which included
a cover of Frankie Laine's
"Ghost Riders" — Stipe
remained perched on his stool,
remarking that his foot hurt too
much to justify the obligatory
trip offstage. Upon the band's
return and throughout the
second encore. Stipe showered
the audience with a bouquet
given to the band by admirers
from Doraville, Ga.
R.E.M. treated each of its

songs as a building block, and
for an hour and a half, the band
stackcd block upon block.
There were no peaks or
climaxes during the show; just a
steady, upward musical progres
sion. The last song was a series
of choruses, each beginning with
Buck's solitary guitar and build
ing to a manic, harmonic howl
chanted by both band and audi
ence members. The show's
evolution from C & W love
warble to sheer musical energy
was completed without a hitch.
As for The Dream Synd
icate's disappointing perfor
mance, well, it was just disap
pointing. Instead of indulging in
their patented version of Pais
leyesque "feedback rock" they
offered a stripped-down set
which was unable to please es
tablished fans yet a little too ec
centric to attract any new ones.
This was especially upsetting to
my three concert companions,
who had come to see the
opening act. When the lights
went down, signalling R.E.M.
was about to begin, I joined the
stampede to the front and left

three disgruntled patrons kibbitz
ing about The Dream Synd
icate's alleged sellout. It was
satisfying to return to three
smiling faces chanting
"Radioooooo fahree Eurup!" in
unison. R.E.M.'s stream of con
sciousness approach to rock and
roll had snagged three more
devotees.
1 don't think the members of
R.E.M. think as highly of them
selves as all the critics think of
them. The bottom line reads
that they are four guys from
Athens, Ga., who sing and
play instruments. Most people
who play their albums enjoy
them and concurrently wonder
why the hell they enjoy songs
that cannot be sung. Surely
everybody at the Warfield expe
rienced this paradox. I've given
up wondering about why I play
one of their albums almost
daily, 1 just play them again,
pleasantly assuming that the an
swer may one day pop up. No
need to hunt for the elusive ex
planation. That would be too
typical.
