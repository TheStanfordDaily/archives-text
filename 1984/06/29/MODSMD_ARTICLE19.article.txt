## 'Gremlins' – good ideas, poor execution 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
As a director, Joe Dante has a terrific visual imagina
tion, an outrageous sense of humor, and considerable
technical sophistication, but he seems to lack concen
tration. His touch is so light that you wonder how
deeply committed he is to filmmaking — to any project
he works on; his movies come across as ingenious larks,
which is (so far) a mixed virtue. He's like the gifted kid
in your high school class you feel sure could do brilliant
work if only he applied himself. I enjoyed Dante's first
feature, The Howling, very much, but the plot was
worked out so casually that 1 was always conscious of
watching a director's juvenilia, and nothing in this
parodic werewolf tale really caught fire (though the
transformation effects were stunning). The segment he
directed in last year's The Twilight /.one, "It's a Good
Lite," showed off his passion for pop and his visual wit:
The spooky little boy with a telepathic stranglehold on
his family thought in terms of the cartoons he saw, and
so the entire sequence looked like a live action version
of a C huck Jones or Tex Avery animated short. But he
couldn t figure out a way to sustain the sneakily funny
humor tor the lull 30 minutes — the unpersuasive
happy ending violated the style, tone and logic of what
had preceded it.
In Gremlins, working from a script by a young NYU
Film School graduate, Chris Columbus, Dante has his
tirst full-length big-budget production, and it's loaded
with ideas. A hapless inventor, Rand Peltzer (the enor
mously likable folk singer Hoyt Axton, who played
Kelly Reno's father in The Black Stallion and Bonnie
Bedelia's in Heart Like a Wheel), wandering into a cel
lar junk shop run by an ancient Chinese (Keye Luke),
spots a small creature he decides would make a perfect
Christmas present for his teenage son Billy (/.ach Gal
ligan). But the sage refuses to sell it to him: The crea
ture — a Mogwai, he calls it — brings too much respon
sibility with it. However, the shopkeeper's impatient
grandson (John Louie) strikes up a bargain with Pelzer
behind the old man's back, and warning the inventor to
adhere to three rules (Don't expose it to the light;
Don't get it wet; Don't feed it after midnight), he sends

him home with the Mogwai in a box. Inevitably, Billy,
who is really the movie's hero — Rand Peltzer speaks
the voice-overs at the beginning and end, but after the
first 15 minutes or so the picture phases him out —
learns the dangers of not following the magic rules.
Water spilled carelessly on his new pet causes it to mul
tiply, and when the baby Mogwai, which are fiendishly
clever rascals, trick Billy into feeding them after mid
night, they metamorphose into vicious monsters that
chortle with glee at the havoc they wreak.
The basic premise of the film suggests a contempo
rary variation on an Arabian Nights fantasy, but Dante
and Columbus stray so far from the feeling of the junk
shop scene, with the Mogwai (later dubbed "Gizmo"
by Billy) singing plaintively on the shelf of a back aisle,
that when its Chinese keeper returns at the end, we're
startled — we forgot all about him, and about Gizmo's
origins. The old man calls Gizmo "one of nature's gifts"
and censures Rand Peltzer for not having heeded his
admonitions — "You're not yet ready for him," he says
— but almost nothing between keye Luke's two ap
pearances recalls the mysterious beauty of The Arabian
Nights or confirms the shopkeeper's vision of Gizmo.
Dante gets so carried away with the demonic exploits
of the second generation Mogwai that Gizmo, who is
cute and loyal throughout, doesn't hold our interest —
especially since Chris Walas, who designed the grem
lins, expended more ingenuity on the monsters.
Gizmo's face is a cross between Yoda's and a baby
monkey's, with Yoda's amazing quality of seeming
young and old at the same time, but it has opaque,
button-bright eyes. Only once does he achieve a truly
extraordinary effect with Gizmo — when it has given
birth to the monster embryos, and its face takes on a
horrifying, waterlogged look, as if eroded by pain and
misery. (This is a moment Tolkien would have loved, I
think.) On the other hand, the nasty Mogwai — by the
middle of the picture, they number around a thousand
— have batwing ears, armored eyelids, and irresistibly
villainous grins. Their antics take over the picture and
bend it out of shape, because we lose track of the
"good magic that might have kept the fantasy in bal

a nee.
In a way, you can't blame the filmmakers for getting
wrapped up in the Mogwai's hijinks. Almost everything
these malevolent creatures do is hilarious, and some of
the best scenes in Gremlins feature them at their most
extravagantly destructive or at their most mocking (or
both) — tearing apart a bar where Billy's girlfriend
Kate (Phoebe Cates, of Fast Times at Ridgemont High)
works, rigging traffic lights to turn green for all oncom
ing traffic, showing up outside the door of the town's
resident harridan (Polly Holliday, impersonating Mar
garet Hamilton in The Wizard of Oz) dressed as carol
lers. This whole middle section, in which Dante and
Columbus roast the Christmas spirit, is partly an ex
tended sick joke — sadistic in the way that Michael
O'Donohue's skits on Saturday Night Live used to be,
but without his chintzy taste, so instead of making you a
little queasy, they scare you and tickle you at the same
time.
In the most entertaining sequence, Billy's mother
(Frances Lee McCain) battles a kitchen infested with
Mogwai, employing a baking sheet as a shield to deflect
flying dishes and eliminating the monsters with the help
of a range of kitchen implements. But even here you
sense Dante's failure to take advantage of all his ideas.
Since he established early on that the Peltzers are
cursed with the daily messes furnished by Rand's un
reliable invention, couldn't Dante have capped this
uproarious running gag by playing up Lynn Peltzer's
being forced to use her husband's flop devices to com
bat the monsters, and having the damned things work
properly for once? (A minor inconsistency: If Rand's
inventions never work, where did he get the money to
attord that spacious, handsomely appointed home?)
Gremlins has a lot of problems — missed or forgotten
ideas (the Mogwai tie up Billy's dog, Barney, in a string
ot Christmas lights, and we wait in vain for the animal
to have his revenge), miscalculated scenes (most
dramatically, Kate's story of why she hates Christmas),
actors given free rein to mug (Polly Holliday; Dick Mil
ler) or talented actors barely used at all (Judge Rein
hold — another Ridgemont High alumnus; Hoyt Ax-
ton). And the movie runs out of
steam about ten minutes before
the end, in the midst of the face
off between Billy and the last
remaining monster. But it's a
very genial evening's entertain
ment, more consistently funny
than anything I've seen since
Splash, and — as in The
Howling — the transformations
are magical. Moreover, Joe
Dante's affection for pop cul
ture makes you grin, even if he
doesn't take a terribly advanced
approach to it. TV sets blare
snatches from half a dozen old
movies, Chuck Jones and west
ern character actor Harry
Carey, Jr. appear in cameo roles
(and of course Keye Luke, fa
mous as Charlie Chan's Number
One Son, has the imporant role
of the Chinese shopkeeper), and
Dante includes tributes to The
Wizard of Oz, It's a Wonderful
Life, Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, Raiders of the Lost
Ark, E.T., Star Wars, The Road
Warrior, Psycho, The Birds, The
Blob, Carrie, The Day the Earth

Stood Still, The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre, Buster Keaton's The
Electric House, and both of his
own previous films. Gremlins
succeeds just where Ghost
Busters falls flat: As it becomes

'Gremlins' has a lot
of problems —
missed or forgot
ten ideas, miscalc
ulated scenes,
actors given free
rein to mug and
talented actors
barely used at all.

As a director, Joe Dante has a terrific visual imagina
tion, an outrageous sense of humor, and considerable
technical sophistication, but he seems to lack concen
tration. His touch is so light that you wonder how
deeply committed he is to filmmaking — to any project
he works on; his movies come across as ingenious larks,
which is (so far) a mixed virtue. He's like the gifted kid
in your high school class you feel sure could do brilliant
work if only he applied himself. I enjoyed Dante's first
feature, The Howling, very much, but the plot was
worked out so casually that 1 was always conscious of
watching a director's juvenilia, and nothing in this
parodic werewolf tale really caught fire (though the
transformation effects were stunning). The segment he
directed in last year's The Twilight /.one, "It's a Good
Lite," showed off his passion for pop and his visual wit:
The spooky little boy with a telepathic stranglehold on
his family thought in terms of the cartoons he saw, and
so the entire sequence looked like a live action version
of a C huck Jones or Tex Avery animated short. But he
couldn t figure out a way to sustain the sneakily funny
humor tor the lull 30 minutes — the unpersuasive
happy ending violated the style, tone and logic of what
had preceded it.
In Gremlins, working from a script by a young NYU
Film School graduate, Chris Columbus, Dante has his
tirst full-length big-budget production, and it's loaded
with ideas. A hapless inventor, Rand Peltzer (the enor
mously likable folk singer Hoyt Axton, who played
Kelly Reno's father in The Black Stallion and Bonnie
Bedelia's in Heart Like a Wheel), wandering into a cel
lar junk shop run by an ancient Chinese (Keye Luke),
spots a small creature he decides would make a perfect
Christmas present for his teenage son Billy (/.ach Gal
ligan). But the sage refuses to sell it to him: The crea
ture — a Mogwai, he calls it — brings too much respon
sibility with it. However, the shopkeeper's impatient
grandson (John Louie) strikes up a bargain with Pelzer
behind the old man's back, and warning the inventor to
adhere to three rules (Don't expose it to the light;
Don't get it wet; Don't feed it after midnight), he sends

him home with the Mogwai in a box. Inevitably, Billy,
who is really the movie's hero — Rand Peltzer speaks
the voice-overs at the beginning and end, but after the
first 15 minutes or so the picture phases him out —
learns the dangers of not following the magic rules.
Water spilled carelessly on his new pet causes it to mul
tiply, and when the baby Mogwai, which are fiendishly
clever rascals, trick Billy into feeding them after mid
night, they metamorphose into vicious monsters that
chortle with glee at the havoc they wreak.
The basic premise of the film suggests a contempo
rary variation on an Arabian Nights fantasy, but Dante
and Columbus stray so far from the feeling of the junk
shop scene, with the Mogwai (later dubbed "Gizmo"
by Billy) singing plaintively on the shelf of a back aisle,
that when its Chinese keeper returns at the end, we're
startled — we forgot all about him, and about Gizmo's
origins. The old man calls Gizmo "one of nature's gifts"
and censures Rand Peltzer for not having heeded his
admonitions — "You're not yet ready for him," he says
— but almost nothing between keye Luke's two ap
pearances recalls the mysterious beauty of The Arabian
Nights or confirms the shopkeeper's vision of Gizmo.
Dante gets so carried away with the demonic exploits
of the second generation Mogwai that Gizmo, who is
cute and loyal throughout, doesn't hold our interest —
especially since Chris Walas, who designed the grem
lins, expended more ingenuity on the monsters.
Gizmo's face is a cross between Yoda's and a baby
monkey's, with Yoda's amazing quality of seeming
young and old at the same time, but it has opaque,
button-bright eyes. Only once does he achieve a truly
extraordinary effect with Gizmo — when it has given
birth to the monster embryos, and its face takes on a
horrifying, waterlogged look, as if eroded by pain and
misery. (This is a moment Tolkien would have loved, I
think.) On the other hand, the nasty Mogwai — by the
middle of the picture, they number around a thousand
— have batwing ears, armored eyelids, and irresistibly
villainous grins. Their antics take over the picture and
bend it out of shape, because we lose track of the
"good magic that might have kept the fantasy in bal

a nee.
In a way, you can't blame the filmmakers for getting
wrapped up in the Mogwai's hijinks. Almost everything
these malevolent creatures do is hilarious, and some of
the best scenes in Gremlins feature them at their most
extravagantly destructive or at their most mocking (or
both) — tearing apart a bar where Billy's girlfriend
Kate (Phoebe Cates, of Fast Times at Ridgemont High)
works, rigging traffic lights to turn green for all oncom
ing traffic, showing up outside the door of the town's
resident harridan (Polly Holliday, impersonating Mar
garet Hamilton in The Wizard of Oz) dressed as carol
lers. This whole middle section, in which Dante and
Columbus roast the Christmas spirit, is partly an ex
tended sick joke — sadistic in the way that Michael
O'Donohue's skits on Saturday Night Live used to be,
but without his chintzy taste, so instead of making you a
little queasy, they scare you and tickle you at the same
time.
In the most entertaining sequence, Billy's mother
(Frances Lee McCain) battles a kitchen infested with
Mogwai, employing a baking sheet as a shield to deflect
flying dishes and eliminating the monsters with the help
of a range of kitchen implements. But even here you
sense Dante's failure to take advantage of all his ideas.
Since he established early on that the Peltzers are
cursed with the daily messes furnished by Rand's un
reliable invention, couldn't Dante have capped this
uproarious running gag by playing up Lynn Peltzer's
being forced to use her husband's flop devices to com
bat the monsters, and having the damned things work
properly for once? (A minor inconsistency: If Rand's
inventions never work, where did he get the money to
attord that spacious, handsomely appointed home?)
Gremlins has a lot of problems — missed or forgotten
ideas (the Mogwai tie up Billy's dog, Barney, in a string
ot Christmas lights, and we wait in vain for the animal
to have his revenge), miscalculated scenes (most
dramatically, Kate's story of why she hates Christmas),
actors given free rein to mug (Polly Holliday; Dick Mil
