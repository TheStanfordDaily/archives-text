# USW hearing set for July 11
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
A hearing before the state
labor commission over the
current dispute between
Stanford and USW, which
was postponed June 20, has
been rescheduled for July 11.
The hearing was scheduled
by deputy labor commis
sioner Philip Galvez, but
postponed by deputy labor
commissioner Ray Brady
while Galvez was out of the
office. Galvez decided that
the hearing was necessary to
"determine if there was a
violation of California Labor
Code Section 227," in which
management is required by
law to withhold funds for
employee benefits.
The University intends to
go to the State Labor Com
missioner, C. Robert
Simpson, to appeal Galvez's
decision. University Associ
ate Staff Counsel Susan de
Jong-Kearl said Tuesday that

the University still felt the
matter was "preempted by
the jurisdiction of the Na
tional Labor Relations
Board," thus making the
State Labor Commission
trial excessive and unneces
sary.
The present NLRB
hearing is slated for Sept. 17,
but according to USW coun
sel Jim Eggleston "ir
reparable harm" will be
done if the union and
employees have to wait that
long for any legal action on
the matter.
"There are people who
have been fired who need ar
bitration, there are people
who have to make contract
negotiations . . . these people
can't wait until September to
have a union to represent
them," he said.
The Sept. 17 date for the
NLRB hearing "has already

been expedited," according
to Eggeleston; normally
NLRB hearings are sched
uled 6 months from the
grievance date, but this one
was set only three months
after USW filed their com
plaint. But even though the
hearing itself cannnot be
scheduled any sooner, Eg
gleston intends to file for an
injunction through the
Washington office of the
NLRB to force the Univer
sity to recognize 680 up until
the time of the hearing.
"The regional board will
decide early next week whe
ther or not we send the mat
ter to Washington,"he said.
"I'm not sure how it will go
from there. We have met all
the requirements for an in
junction, but the people that
Reagan's put into the NLRB
have a definite anti-labor
bias. We'll just have to wait
and see."
