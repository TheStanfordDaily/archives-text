M*A*S*H* (1970)
Memorial Auditorium
Robert Altman's first
breakthrough was this classic
depiction of sane men and mad
men in a Korean War medical
unit. The stunning cast includes
Donald Sutherland (who has
never been better), Elfiott
Gould (who has been better only
once — in another Altman film.
The Long Goodbye), Tom Sker
utt, Sally Kellerman, Robert
Duvall, Rene Auberjonois, and
of course Gary Burghof, who
survived the Korean War only to
re-enlist — in the TV version of
Ring Lardner, Jr.
adapted the Richard Hooker
novel (one of a series), though
much of the rapid-fire overlap
ping dialogue (the best since His
Girl Friday) was obviously im
provised under Altman's super
vision. Quite likely the funniest
movie ever made about war.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.
Crime and Punishment
(1935)
Cubberley Auditorium
This is the kind of movie that
fans of the director, Josef von
Sternberg, go ape over, because
of the striking visual stylization;
the more cynical among us may
giggle at the tableaux and Lucien
Ballard's dramatic lighting. It's a
dreadful movie, or it would be if
Peter Lorre, a recent emigre
from Germany, weren't cast as
Raskolnikov. Perhaps no film
actor has ever come closer to the
spirit of Dostoevski (except pos
sibly Edwige Feuillere in The
Idiot). The rest of the cast, with
the exception of Mrs. Patrick
Campbell, doesn't really belong
in the same studio with Lorre:
Edward Arnold as Porfiry,

Marian Marsh as Sonya, Gene
Lockhart, Elizabeth Risdon,
1 ala Birell and Douglas
Dumbrille.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Conformist (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Leaves fly ferociously into the
camera as if possessed; tiny, rat
like dogs overrun an invalid's
bed; a bureaucrat sits, Magritte
like, at an immense marble desk
placed squarely in the center of
an immense office. Bernardo
Bertolucci's film of the Alberto
Moravia novel, set in Italy in the
late 19305, is so imagistically
rich that you grow delirious
while you watch. Intellectually,
the treatment of fascism as un
resolved homosexual tension
may not be satisfying, but vis
ually and emotionally this is a
great movie, made by a true
poet-director. The cast is ex
traordinary, too; Jean-Louis
Trintignant as the fascist,
Stefania Sandrelli as his silly, en
dearing wife, and Dominique
Sanda as the other woman.
Plays Tuesday with The Pas
senger.
Laura(l944)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In which Dana Andrews plays
a detective who falls in love with
a corpse. Otto Preminger did
such a polished job of directing
this highly amusing thriller that
you may wonder how it is that
he's botched almost everything
he's filmed since. Gene Tierney,
Vincent Price, Judith Anderson

and, in an Oscar Wildean role,
Clifton Webb co-star, but it's
Dana Andrews' haunted tough
guy brio that gives the film its
emotional center. Script by Jay
Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein and
Betty Reinhardt, based on a
Vera Caspary novel; David Rak
sin wrote the famous,
memorable theme song.
Plays Thursday with Vertigo.
Green for Danger (1947)
Festival, Palo Alto
At the beginning of this
movie, we watch two doctors
and four nurses at work in an
operating room and a familiar,
fastidious voice tells us that by
the end three of these characters
will be dead and one revealed as
a murderer. The voice belongs to
Alastair Sim, who doesn't ap
pear until half an hour has
elapsed; as Inspector Cockrill,
who is cheerfully insulting to
everyone, he steals the picture.
Of course, the screenwriters,
Sidney Gilliatt (who also di
rected) and Claud Curacy, have
given him all the best lines: At
one point he says, "My presence
lay over the hospital like a
pall,"and one has only to look at
that drawn, spectral face to
know that he must be accurate.
The suspects include a surgeon
who is haunted by an earlier
death on his operating table
(Trevor Howard), his lovely
tiancee (Sally Gray); another
doctor attracted to her (Leo
Genn); the head nurse, in love
with him (Judy Campbell); an
unstable nurse who has not yet

recovered from the death of her
mother (Rosamund John); and
Megs Jenkins, who conveys
warmth and intelligence in her
small performance as a matronly
nurse. The movie was released in
1947 but ls set during the war; it
contains some implausible twists
and Gilliatt's suspense tech
niques are crude, but it is quite
entertaining. (One of the plot
devices may remind you of the
much later Coma.) The signifi
cance of the title is not explained
until the last few minutes.
Plays through Wednesday
with Murder fry Death.
Murder by Death (1976)
Festival, Palo Alto
The idea sounds promising
enough: A collection of
detectives, each a parody of a fa
mous fictive sleuth, gathers at
the home of a rich eccentric and,
as in And Then There Were
None, people are eliminated one
by one. But the screenplay is by
Neil Simon, who — to put it as
kindly as possible — has no gift
for parody,and the director,
Robert Moore, doesn't help
matters. (Neither does the
clumsy editing.) The result is
fairly stupid and certainly
ing in delicacy, despite the all
star cast: Peter Falk (spoofing
Sam Spade), Elsa Lanchester
(Miss Marple), Peter Sellers
(Charlie Chan), David Niven
(Nick Charles), Maggie Smith
(Nora Charles), James Coco
(Herculc Poirot), and Eileen
Brennan, Alec Guinness, Nancy
Walker, Estelle Winwood, and

Truman Capote as the eccentric.
Falk and Smith each have a few
reasonably funny moments.
Plays through Wednesday
with Green for Danger.
Victor Victoria (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In mid-1930s Paris, a gay
nightclub singer out of a job
teams up with a starving soprano
and turns her into a star by pass
ing her off as a female imper
sonator. It's a tantalizing idea:
One thinks of Some Like It Hot
and La Cage aux Folles and
Cabaret, and the romantic twist
— the heroine, pretending to be
her gay manager s lover, falls in
love with a straight club owner
who's being backed by Chicago
mobsters — is potentially
Shakespearean. But the role of
the soprano requires not only
crack timing but also an
androgynous sexiness, and the
star, Julie Andrews, has neither;
furthermore, her musical num
bers, which should be jazzy and
sophistcated, are like those aw
ful scenes in '30s and '40s musi
cals in which opera stars conde
scend to perform pop. Blake Ed
wards wrote and directed, but
his fabled slapstick gift> desert
him here, and he shows very
little sense of the period. Lucki
ly, Robert Preston plays the
homosexual, and he makes his
econd-rate lines sound first-rate,
as well as putting over his num
bers with vaudevillian assurance.
With James Garner as the club
owner (he's so passive he's
practically nonexistent) and Les
ley Ann Warren as his dumb
sexpot mistress. (She may be
even more ludicrously miscast
than Julie Andrews.)
Plays Thursday with Splash.
