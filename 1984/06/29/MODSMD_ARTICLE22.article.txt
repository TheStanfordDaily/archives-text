Mid-East prisoner swap
Jerusalem — Israel and Syria swapped prisoners
across a United Nations-patrolled cease-fire line in
the Golan Heights yesterday in an often emotional
ceremony governed by such stiff protocol that it
took almost six hours to complete.
It was a lopsided deal with Syria releasing just six
Israelis — three soldiers and three low-ranking
diplomats — in exchange for 291 Syrian soldiers and
20 Arab "security prisoners," most of them Druse
residents of villages in the Israeli-annexed portion of
the strategic Golan Heights.
The prisoner exchange was the first in 10 years
between the two countries, but Israeli officials said it
did not appear to point the way to improved rela
tions.
Defense Minister Moshe Arens told a press con
ference that the Red Cross handled negotiations for

the trade because Damascus refused to participate
in direct talks.
Shmuel Tamir, chief of the Israeli negotiating
team, insisted that the swap was not politically
motivated.
Water plan passes
Sacramento — Gov. George Deukmejian's hotly
debated delta water plan was approved by the state
senate yesterday, but critics took steps that could
force a public vote on the proposal in 1986.
The plan, in a bill by Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-
Chino), would authorize widening of channels in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and the possible
construction of a cross-delta canal and storage reser
voirs south of the delta. Ayala said it would allow
shipment of 500,000 more acre-feet of water south
to the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California.
Most northern lawmakers opposed the bill, saying
it lacked protections for northern water rights, fish

and wildlife, the delta and San Francisco Bay. The
Senate approved northern amendments to remove
the urgency clause, a step that could pave the way
for a referendum in 1986, to give greater protection
to the Suisun Marsh and to require the state to adopt
a water conservataion program.
DeLorean trial goes on
Los Angeles — The arrest of John DeLorean's
personal secretary on drug charges in New Jersey
provided a distraction but had little apparent effect
on the cocaine-trafficking trial of the automaker
Thursday.
While waiting outside the courtroom during a
recess, DeLorean declined to say anything to
reporters.
At first DeLorean's attorney, Howard VVeitzman,
said Brady's arrest was "just too strange a coinci
dence," hut he later told a press conference
had nothing further to say on the matter.
