### KIMBERLY ESTIS 
The connection between Stanford and
Silicon Valley has captured the attention
of the overseas media.
The Bechtel International Center's
Office for International Visitors (OIV)
has received a "considerable amount of
requests from journalists and
broadcasters all over the world," Maria-
Mary Bun, the OIVs assistant director,
said Tuesday.
"We have received so far 98 requests
for programs in July from visitors â€”
most of whom are politicians and media
specialists," Bun stated.
OIV is approximately 30 years old. It
has greeted and welcomed almost a
thousand visitors per year during the past
eight years, and the number is steadily
increasing .
With the Democratic convention in
San Francisco and the Olympic games in
Los Angeles and at Stanford this sum

mer, the Bay Area is expected to receive
an enormous number of international
visitors. Bun predicted.
Many professionals will request to
meet with faculty and administrators this
summer.
The increased number of visitors
results in competition and conflicts for
appointments as agencies and individual
visitors call administrators and faculty di
rectly.
The heads of state who have visited
the University in recent years include
Queen Elizabeth of England, King Gus
tav of Sweden and President Miterrand
of France. A constantly-increasing num
ber of professors around the world con
tact their campus colleagues directly.
Bun revealed.
"I am sure that a staggering number of
international visitors would be accounted
for if we could find out how many come
to conferences, seminars and direct ap

pointments with faculty as visiting
scholars," she said.
An average of 500 international
visitors came to the campus each year
until 1976. During the bicentennial
celebration in 1976, the number doubled
and stopped increasing. Bun said.
This past May, there was a 50 percent
increase in the number of visitors
compared to the previous May.
More than half of the international
visitors during the first five months of the
year were invited to the U.S. through the
United States Information Agency
(USIA), Bun said.
Accommodations for some visitors are
arranged by the International Visitors
Center in San Francisco, a clearinghouse
for the USIA. Others are arranged di
rectly by the University's Office of Inter
national Visitors . Guests appreciate the
opportunity to exchange ideas with the
faculty and to share information about

their cultures.
Bun said, "The mutual benefits of the
visitors program generate more visitors."
According to Bun, who has been the
assistant director of the visitors center
for ten years, the most significant reasons
why visitors come to Stanford are for dis
cussions on high technology, arms con
trol and world economic issues.
Third World visitors are especially in
terested in trends in higher education
and the impact of computers, while
European visitors are curious about the
American political system and want to
learn about it by observing primaries, at
tending conventions and meeting the
candidates.
Many politicians from West Germany
are expected to visit Stanford and Silicon
Valley in July, Bun said.
