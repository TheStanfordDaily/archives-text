## Jackson finishes Cuban mission

Havana — Jesse Jackson
returned to Havana's Jose Marti
Airport last night to pick up 48
Cuban and American prisoners
released to him by Fidel Castro
just hours after meetings with
Sandinista officials in
Nicaragua.
The Cuban leader was at the
airport to greet the American
Democratic presidential
aspirant. To the chant of "Fidel,
Jackson" from thousands of
Cubans lining the airport build
ings, the two walked through a
light rain across the tarmac to an
airport meeting room where
they talked as Cuban and
American officials worked out
last-minute problems holding
up departure of the planes
bringing the Jackson entourage
and the prisoners back to Wash
ington's Dulles Airport.
The head of the U.S. Interests
Section in Cuba, John Ferch,
said landing rights had been
granted for a Cuban plane to
bring the prisoners — 26

Cubans and 22 Americans — to
the United States, but there still
was a dispute over the crew and
pilot of the Cuban aircraft.
Secret Service agents accom
panying Jackson said the
prisoners would be kept hand
cuffed and isolated aboard the
aircraft on the flight to the
United States.
In Washington, federal offi
cials said they would arrest only
those Americans facing charges
in this country, reported to be a
small number, and release the
rest. The Cubans will arrive
here on a temporary entry status
that does not require a visa.
They will be able to apply for
asylum. Most of the Americans
released had been in jail on
drug-trafficking charges.
Jackson also said he wants to
meet with President Reagan to
discuss his talks with Cuban
President Fidel Castro. But a
White House spokesman said
"we don't see any urgency for
such a meeting."
