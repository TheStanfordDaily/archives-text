# House sends drinking bill to Reagan

### 
From the Washington Post and the Asso
ciated Press
Washington — The House
yesterday swiftly approved and
sent to President Reagan a bill
that would force states to raise
their minimum drinking age to
21 or lose federal highway
funds.
The politically popular
election-year measure, ap
proved by the Senate Tuesday
night, also would increase fun
ding for states that enact man
datory penalties for drunken
driving.
The House approved the bill

by unanimous consent, an ex
pedited procedure that required
no debate and no vote.
Reagan has said he will sign
the bill. He initially opposed it,
saying that a minimum drinking
age of 21 was a good idea but
that the federal government
should not force it on states. He
quickly moderated his position,
however, saying that he sup
ported the minimum drinking
age but not the highway bill to
which it was attached.
In response, the Senate put
the drinking-age provision in a
different, non-controversial bill,

and the House Wednesday night
agreed to the switch so that the
measure could be completed
before Congress leaves Friday
for its July 4th recess.
The action by Congress is part
of a national effort to curtail
drinking by young people and
reduce drunken-driving
fatalities caused by those under
21. National statistics show that
people between 18 and 20 are
more than twice as likely as
others to be involved in an
alcohol-related accident.
After enactment of the law,
states with a drinking age under

21 would have two years to raise
it. States that failed to comply
would lose 5 percent of their
federal highway-construction
aid in the third year and 10 per
cent in the fourth year, although
they would be reimbursed once
they complied.
States that put into effect the
drunken-driving penalties speci
fied in the bill would receive an
increase in highway funds of up
to 5 percent.
Federal highway aid, raised
primarily from the gasoline tax,
is apportioned to the states on a

formula basis.
The mandatory penalties in
the legislation include loss of
driver's license for 90 days and
two days in jail on the first con
viction for the second convic
tion, and loss of license for three
years and 120 days in jail for the
third conviction.
Twenty-two states have a
minimum drinking age of 21;
nine others have 21 as the mini
mum age for hard liquor but al
low younger persons to buy beer
and wine. The other 19 have
minimum drinking ages of 18,
19 or 20.
