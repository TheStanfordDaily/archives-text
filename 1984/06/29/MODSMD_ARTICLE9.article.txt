## Baccalaureate speaker inappropriate 
### 
The speech by Rabbi Facken
heim at the baccalaureate ser
vice was very appalling. It was a
matter of extreme bad taste tor
the B jiai B'rith to bring the
speaker, and inject their politi
cal propaganda into a formal
campus activity. In my opinion,
it was also a mistake on behalf
of President Kennedy and the
Stanford administration to allow
this speech to take place as part

Viewpoint

of the formal commencement
ceremony without regard to the
feelings of the Arab students,
faculty and staff. In the next few
lines, I would like to repudiate
some of the statements men
tioned in that speech.
The speaker s comparison of
the early American conquest of
the West to the present Israeli
expansion needs further ex
amination. Rabbi Fackenheim's
statement, "what the West was
to America, the desert is to Is
rael,".is the best example of the
colonialist spirit in Zionism. It
reminded me of a letter by
Theodor Herzel, who many
consider "The father of
/.ionism," to Cecil Rhodes, the
British founder of what used to
be Rhodesia, in an attempt to
gain British consent for the oc
cupation of Palestine, " because

it is something colonial," Herzel
wrote. Other statements in the
not-so-distant past also ex
emplify the colonial spirit in
/.ionism, like Ben-Gurion's
description of his people as a
"company of conquistadores"
and Chaim Weizman's state
ment, "What France did in Al
geria, we can do in Palestine."
The pioneers' push westward
was with only a geographic bar
rier, the Pacific Ocean; so what
is going to stop the Israeli settle
ments and kibbutzes? Will it be
the Jordan River, the Arabian
(Persian) Gulf, or the Great
Wall of China?
The speaker also did not
mention anything about the fate
of the people who will be in the
way of his desert conquest and
what is he planning to do with
them? I would like to tell the
speaker and the readers that we,
the Arabs, will never allow our
refugee camps to become
"reservations."
The speaker then reversed
himself to speak of his "historic
rights" to take the land. What
rights and what history? Jewish
authors such as Arthur Koestler
and Alfred Lilienthal showed
that more than 95 percent of the
Ashkenazi Jews, a group which
includes both the speaker and
the ruling class of Israel, are main
ly Khazar and several other

European origins. They are not
even Semites. The only right
that they possess is not by his
tory or the Bible, but by the
Balfour Declaration and the
1947 U.N. partition resolution.
Contrary to the speaker's alle
gations, the anti-Zionist Jews
are honest people with an alter
nate opinion to his. They range
trom the ultra-conservative
Hadasic Satmar sect, who
believe that /.ionism and the
state of Israel are heresy; to
people like my fellow chemist,
Dr. Israel Shahak, who is a sur
vivor of the Nazi holocaust, but
against /.ionism because it is
discriminatory; to patriotic
Americans such as Dr. Alfred
Lilienthal, who refuses to let his
loyalty be hyphenated.
Every American, in my
opinion, should protest the al
leged connection between the
symbol behind the Statue of
Liberty and the Israeli 1950
Law of Return. This law is racist
to say the least, since it allows
only the Jews to come and
become citizens. Can you imag
ine or would you want your im
migration law in the U.S. to be
restricted to one race, one
nationality, or one religion?
The Israeli record on civil
rights to black Jews is nothing to
be proud of. According to Asiel

Ben Israel, minister of the He
brew Nation of Israelites —
Black Americans of the Jewish
faith, "The state of Israel is
racist to the core."
The speaker was boasting
about the Israeli bravery and
how many Arab soldiers they
killed in one battle. Our history
is also full of epic stands like the
Karameh battle in Jordan in
1968, and several heroic stands
by my fellow Lebanese in Beirut
and the South where we still are
making our land like hot coal
under the feet of the occupiers.
But what I would like to leave
you with is: our enemy is fight
ing with his might; but we are
fighting with our right. This
makes us looking forward to a
future of peace, where justice
prevails and our rights are
honored and respected.

Liberty and the Israeli 1950
Law of Return. This law is racist
to say the least, since it allows
only the Jews to come and
become citizens. Can you imag
ine or would you want your im
migration law in the U.S. to be
restricted to one race, one
nationality, or one religion?
The Israeli record on civil
rights to black Jews is nothing to
be proud of. According to Asiel

Ben Israel, minister of the He
brew Nation of Israelites —
Black Americans of the Jewish
faith, "The state of Israel is
racist to the core."
The speaker was boasting
about the Israeli bravery and
how many Arab soldiers they
killed in one battle. Our history
is also full of epic stands like the
Karameh battle in Jordan in
1968, and several heroic stands
by my fellow Lebanese in Beirut
and the South where we still are
making our land like hot coal
under the feet of the occupiers.
But what I would like to leave
you with is: our enemy is fight
ing with his might; but we are
fighting with our right. This
makes us looking forward to a
future of peace, where justice
prevails and our rights are
honored and respected.
