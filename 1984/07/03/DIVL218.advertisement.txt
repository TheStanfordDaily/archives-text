Programmers/Entrepreneurs
We need experienced programmers who:
• Have written many large Pascal programs
• Know how compilers and real-time systems are designed
• Are interested in working on a future-royalties basis
• Are able to work full- or part-time for several months
Our software development effort has been underway for
2 years. The first program in a family of similar programs is
now working and we want to elaborate the family.
Excellent potential for a highly skilled programmer.
