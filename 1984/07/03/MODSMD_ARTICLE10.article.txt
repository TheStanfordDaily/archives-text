## Dan Turner Housing office taken over by Weenie agent 
### 
The receptionist at Stanford University's Office of
Residential Education looked up from her scattered
paperwork and found herself staring straight into the
barrel of a sleek .45 Magnum.
"Where is he?" hissed a voice on the other side of the
oversized handgun. He was a thin, balding man in his
early twenties. His eyes were colder than the lenses of
his steel-rimmed glasses.
"Who . . the secretary stammered.
"You know who â€” The Man."
"Yeah, I know, he's in a conference and can't be dis
turbed. Well, you're gonna disturb him, punk." The
man spoke the last word through clenched teeth, with
enough vitriol in his tone to melt microwave cookware.
"If you have some problem, perhaps 1 can help you,"
she answered, swallowing past a lump in her throat.
"Dirty Danny" narrowed his eyes to slits. "This
receptionist was a cool one," he thought. Too cool to be
what she appeared. She was stalling for time, and
Danny knew it. Perhaps she had an alarm button hid
den under her desk that would alert the Director in case
of trouble. Danny had no intention of letting her use it,
but he was willing to play her little game.
"I want my summer housing assignment."
The woman could scarcely conceal her sigh of relief.
She was in familiar territory now.
"To find that out you have to go to the house offices
on the 24th."
"I don't want to wait until the 24th," Danny spat.
"I want to have phone service when I move in. I want
to know if there is any chance of getting into an apart
ment, because the difference means an extra $461 for
food service. The Draw only takes nine seconds for
each sex, for a combined total of IS seconds. So why

have I waited five weeks for my housing assignment
only to find out that I won't know until I move in?'
Danny's face was contorted into a mask of hate.
"Very clever, whoever you are," said a voice from a
doorway behind the receptionist. The Director slumped
against the frame. Something red was barely concealed
in his left fist.
"You seem to have figured out our little plan,' he
sneered. "Yes, we could have given you your housing
assignment long ago, if we had wanted to. Any mental
deficient with a pocket calculator and a rubber stamp
could have completed the process by now. But we've
been stalling. And why do you suppose we'd want to do
that?" '
Danny leveled his .45 at the Director's chest. There
was something vaguely disturbing about the Director's
manner. Perhaps it was the blue and gold beanie which
perched on his head like a malignant tumor, or the"I
love E.T." button he wore in his lapel. And then, sud
denly, Danny had the answer.
"You're a weenie!" he exclaimed. The Director
emitted an evil iaugh.
"Yes, that's right, 1 go to Cal. And when they discover
how inept their housing system is, so will dozens of cur
rent Stanford students. Perhaps even hundreds." There
was an insane gleam in the fake Director's eye.
Everyone knows that Berkeley's housing system is
completely inadequate," he continued. "It's what has
kept so many of you holier-than-thou Stanfordites
away for years. We can't change that; but we can
destroy the competition by continually frustrating
anyone who comes into contact with Res Ed."
"You fiend," Danny hissed, temporarily stunned by
the audacity of the Director's plan. This gave the Direc

tor all the time he needed. With a flick of his wrist he
hurled a ribbon of red tape at Danny's .45. One end
wrapped around the barrel, and the Director tugged
back at the other end as though he were cracking a
whip. The gun flew out of Danny's grasp.
At that instant the secretary threw a stack of used
computer paper at Danny's head. He was knocked
backwards by the impact. Suddenly a cloud of pink and
yellow forms were thrown at him. There were provi
sions for pregnant graduate women, RA applications,
housing agreement cards. Danny struggled to retain his
balance, but it was too much. He was beaten.
"I suppose you're going to kill me now," Danny said
from somewhere beneath the pile of bureaucratic ex
creta.
"Kill you? No. 1 have something much more
frightening than that in mind for you. I'm going to put
you in Wilbur."
"That's right," continued the Director. "Eight long
weeks of food service. And that's not all. There'll be
dozens of junior high and grade school kids sharing
your tables, throwing food, spilling Coke on your $48
pants. And when food service is over you'll find your
self living on cold Pop-tarts and beer, because there's
no cooking allowed in the rooms. Take him away!"
Two thugs emerged from the Director's office and
dragged Danny's defeated form out of the Old Union.
The Director watched them go and then turned with a
smile to his faithful secretary.
"You have done well, and deserve a reward. How
would you like to be on the ASSU Council of Presi
dents?"
