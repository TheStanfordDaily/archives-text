## Stanford needs a more sensitive newspaper 
### 
This commentary began as a
response to the recent articles in
the Daily about the Synergy
party to raise funds for
Nicaragua. The "Aid or Arms?"
article (May 25), which lay the
basis for Jason Matherly's
opinion column (May 31), is
one small example of why I have

Viewpoint

become frustrated, often angry
and disillusioned by the ir
responsible reporting that dis
tinguishes The Stanford Daily.
Over the years, I have seen
the Daily repeatedly concoct
reports and substantiate false
accusations. For example, the
Daily has introduced myths
about Casa /apata to the Stan
ford community, such as report
ing a student's erroneous claim
that house meetings are held in
Spanish. The Daily has also
fueled negative sentiments and
stereotypes about Zapata's
murals. While giving plenty of
column space to the dominant,
white interpretation of the
murals, the muralist's or other
Chicanos' views were not ex
pressed.
The recent "controversy"
over the destination of the
proceeds from the Synergy

benefit is the latest in a well
established history of irrespon
sible reporting. How the
"controvefsy spread to the
campus party scene,"' other than
in the reporter's mind, the arti
cle does not say. However, the
reporter s investigation revealed
that two members from the
campus organizations that were
active and knowledgeable on is
sues concerning Central America
were involved with the party.
Despite this, not one member of
U.S. Out of Central America
(USOCA) was interviewed for
the article, nor were any quotes
by members of the Stanford
Central America Action Net
work (SCAAN) included. The
exclusion of these organizations"
views and experience is particu
larly disturbing when, as the ar
ticle suggested, one of the
groups has direct contact with
the Sandinista Defense Com
mittees (CDS), the organization
at the center of this concocted
controversy. Instead, we read
the views of representatives of a
wide political spectrum and ex
perience, such as the president
of the Stanford Republican
League, a Hoover Fellow, and a
colonel from the State Depart
ment.
The ultimate responsibility

tor a report lies with a reporter
and her/his editor. Had the
Daily sought to verify the claim
that, "some of the money is
known to he used for weapons,"
then it would have found that
claim to be false. Not even the
statements made by the Hoover
Fellow or the colonel substan
tiated the claim. In general, the
article was poorly researched: it
was ignorant of the concept of
mass organizations in this
country and on this campus, and
it was completely uninformed
about the way in which nation
states secure weapons.
My frustration with the
Daily's irresponsibility has led
me to take actions available to
anyone. 1 have sent articles and
letters, and have encouraged
others to do so when they saw a
misrepresentation of the
facts. I have taken other
individual, more symbolic ac
tions, such as withholding my
portion of the Daily's fee assess
ment, and voting against its re
quest for a fee assessment
during elections. I have also
envisioned more collective ac
tions, like combining The Inde
pendent, The Real News, La
Onda, Aurora and any other al
ternative papers still in exis
tence into one journal. Individ

11 a 1 1 y, these papers struggle to
publish once or twice a year.
Together, perhaps, they would
publish more frequently and be
more responsive to campus
events and communities that are
often ignored (Cinco de Mayo
celebrations), undervalued (the
Pow-Wow) or misrepresented
by the Daily.
As I graduate, 1 still see a
combined newspaper as an at
tractive alternative for the
minority and progressive com
munities. In the coming year,
our response to the C-US
report, to the affirmative action
backlash, and to other reversals
in the advances fought for by

student that came before us, is
imperative. We need a newspa
per that is responsive to our
communities on these issues,
not one we have to respond to
with a letter of protest every
time we pick it up. We need a
medium that will reflect our
views, not distort them. Finally,
The Stanford Daily needs to
take responsibility for its meth
ods of reporting that un
abashedly reveal a chasm of ig
norance and indifference
toward certain sectors of the
Stanford community.
