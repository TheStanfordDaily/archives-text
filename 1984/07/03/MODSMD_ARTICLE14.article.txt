## Pristine lake plagued by trespassers, trash 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
Felt Lake, a picturesque jewel nestled
in the foothills two miles south of
campus, has become a subject of contro
versy.
For years, the lake has been a popular
haven for swimmers and fishermen, but
police say it is also a dangerous spot,
where drownings and violent crimes are
common.
The lake is surrounded by a barbed
wire tence and "no trespassing" signs,
but it is easy to cross the fence by climb
ing over tree stumps. A popular access
point begins at the Stanford Center for
Computer Studies in Music on
Arastradero Road.
The University owns the lake and the
adjacent land, but for more than 50 years
it has been leased by the Piers Dairy of
Menlo Park, which grazes almost 1000
head of cattle on approximately 2000
acres surrounding the lake. The cattle
leave the lake in early June when the
grass dries up, and return in late Novem
ber or December.
Most of the lake's visitors are Stanford
students and local residents who are
aware they are trespassing, but are well
behaved and leave no litter.
But a significant minority causes trou
ble for police and creates thousands of
dollars in damage which the dairy must
pay for.
Over 500 people were given citations
for trespassing at Felt Lake in 1982.
Those who are cited for trespassing can
be convicted of misdemeanors and fined
$500 or jailed for six months. The mini
mum fine is $150.
The number of citations decreased to
150 last year because budget cuts forced
police to decrease their patrols of the
area.
But despite the smaller number of
citations, the lake continues to be a trou

ble spot.
"During the past few years there's
been one murder, several rapes and
drownings and several fires out there,"
said Roger Piers, co-owner of the dairy
which leases the land.
"Earlier this year, three boys went
around bragging that they were going out
to the lake on weekends, getting loaded,
tinding a steer, tying it up and beating it
to death," Piers said.
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Deputy
Phil Livak confirmed Piers' account.
Livak has been assigned to the patrol
area which includes the lake for several
years, and he has many tales of violent
crimes there.
"There's at least one drowning every
year, and every time the victim was
either drunk or on drugs," he said.
"They're usually still wearing their Levis
and tennis shoes."
Livak said he's had to deal with "a
couple of rapes and numerous assaults
with deadly weapons" at Felt Lake.
Although many of the trespassers at
the lake are Stanford students, "the real
trouble comes from lots of people who
aren't exactly your Stanford types,"
Livak said.
"We get lots of drunk 300-pound ex
bikers who like to get into fights," Livak
said. "Lots of women go up there to sun
bathe in the nude, and the next thing you
know, someone is trying to jump on top
of them."
As a member of the sheriff s depart
ment's Underwater Search and Rescue
Unit, Livak has recovered several
drowned bodies from the lake. He said
the bottom is covered at one point by a
two-foot layer of broken glass.
According to Livak, 300-400 people
often turn up at the lake on warm sum
mer weekends. "It's impossible to do
anything about them when it's just you
against several hundred people. They

throw bottles at you and want to fight,"
he said.
The number of visitors usually in
creases after the University's Lake
Lagunita is drained, he said.
Sgt. Philip Love of the University
police is occasionally called to the lake to
deal with disruptions.
"It's a traditional place for skinnv
dipping, fraternity parties and high
school parties," said Love.
"By and large, people are well
behaved and cooperative, but any time
you have an isolated area with a body of
water, there's the potential for drown
ings, fires and drug use." Love said.
Four visits to the lake last weekend
turned up more than 25 trespassers and a
great deal of litter, but no illicit behavior.
The grass around the lake's edge was
strewn with empty wine, beer and liquor
bottles, cigarette boxes and fish hook
containers.
Most of the people at the lake were
reluctant to reveal their names or be
photographed. A man fishing on the
Northern shore with two children
refused to answer any questions. "I'm

just trying to feed my family," he said.
"If it's private property, take it up with
the owner, but leave me alone."
Marilyn Radojsich, 27, an occupa
tional therapist at the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration hospital, said she swims
at Felt Lake because it is the closest
freshwater lake to her home in Barron
Park.
"The water's really nice," she said,
"but it bothers me when I see people
leaving their trash there. Sometimes I
clean up after other people and carry out
what they leave behind."
Radojsich said she plans to continue
swimming at the lake unless the police
crack down on the practice.
"It'd be a drag if 1 had to stop." she
said, "but I know it's private property
and I'm aware that I've been trespass
ing."
Livak and other law enforcement offi
cials are pessimistic about the likelihood
of eliminating the problems at Felt Lake.
"They tear down the no trespassing
signs faster than we can put them up,"
Livak said. "The expense required to en
force the laws there would be
phenomenal."

Felt Lake, a picturesque jewel nestled
in the foothills two miles south of
campus, has become a subject of contro
versy.
For years, the lake has been a popular
haven for swimmers and fishermen, but
police say it is also a dangerous spot,
where drownings and violent crimes are
common.
The lake is surrounded by a barbed
wire tence and "no trespassing" signs,
but it is easy to cross the fence by climb
ing over tree stumps. A popular access
point begins at the Stanford Center for
Computer Studies in Music on
Arastradero Road.
The University owns the lake and the
adjacent land, but for more than 50 years
it has been leased by the Piers Dairy of
Menlo Park, which grazes almost 1000
head of cattle on approximately 2000
acres surrounding the lake. The cattle
leave the lake in early June when the
grass dries up, and return in late Novem
ber or December.
Most of the lake's visitors are Stanford
students and local residents who are
aware they are trespassing, but are well
behaved and leave no litter.
But a significant minority causes trou
ble for police and creates thousands of
dollars in damage which the dairy must
pay for.
Over 500 people were given citations
for trespassing at Felt Lake in 1982.
Those who are cited for trespassing can
be convicted of misdemeanors and fined
$500 or jailed for six months. The mini
mum fine is $150.
The number of citations decreased to
150 last year because budget cuts forced
police to decrease their patrols of the
area.
But despite the smaller number of
citations, the lake continues to be a trou

ble spot.
"During the past few years there's
been one murder, several rapes and
drownings and several fires out there,"
said Roger Piers, co-owner of the dairy
which leases the land.
"Earlier this year, three boys went
around bragging that they were going out
to the lake on weekends, getting loaded,
tinding a steer, tying it up and beating it
to death," Piers said.
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Deputy
Phil Livak confirmed Piers' account.
Livak has been assigned to the patrol
area which includes the lake for several
years, and he has many tales of violent
crimes there.
"There's at least one drowning every
year, and every time the victim was
either drunk or on drugs," he said.
"They're usually still wearing their Levis
and tennis shoes."
Livak said he's had to deal with "a
couple of rapes and numerous assaults
with deadly weapons" at Felt Lake.
Although many of the trespassers at
the lake are Stanford students, "the real
trouble comes from lots of people who
aren't exactly your Stanford types,"
Livak said.
"We get lots of drunk 300-pound ex
bikers who like to get into fights," Livak
said. "Lots of women go up there to sun
bathe in the nude, and the next thing you
know, someone is trying to jump on top
of them."
As a member of the sheriff s depart
ment's Underwater Search and Rescue
Unit, Livak has recovered several
drowned bodies from the lake. He said
the bottom is covered at one point by a
two-foot layer of broken glass.
According to Livak, 300-400 people
often turn up at the lake on warm sum
mer weekends. "It's impossible to do
anything about them when it's just you
against several hundred people. They

throw bottles at you and want to fight,"
he said.
