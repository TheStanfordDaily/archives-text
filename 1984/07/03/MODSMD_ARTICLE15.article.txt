## Scientists postpone DNA-corn planting 
### LISA LYNCH 
Two Stanford biologists who
had planned an agricultural ex
periment involving corn seed
containing recombinant-gene
DNA have decided to delay the
experiment after some unex
pected legal hassles.
The two scientists, Ronald
Davis and Virginia Walbot,
have been planning the experi
ment since 1981, when they
received permission from the
National Institute of Health to
plant a field of gene-altered
corn. Previously, experiments of
this sort had only been con
ducted in special greenhouses,
which according to Davis were
"expensive and unnecessary."
Trouble arose when Jeremy
Rifkin, an activist opposed to
experiments that release en
gineered life forms into the en
vironment, sued to stop the test
and claimed that an injunction
he won May 16 applies to the
experiment.
Last fall, Rifkin sued to stop
three experiments approved by
the NIH Recombinant Advisory
Board in 1981 — the Stanford
study, an experiment at UC-
Berkeley, and a tobacco experi
ment that has been since
abandoned.

Ihe May 16 injunction by
Federal judge John Sirica cen
tered on the UC-Berkeley ex
periment. The ruling came
about over a legal rather than
scientific matter — the NIH had
failed to file an environmental
impact statement in both cases.
The Berkeley experiment in
volved the release of genetically
altered microbes in to the envi
ronment, which are difficult to
control. The Stanford experi
ment, however, involves entire
plants, genetically altered '"self
contained units" which are no
threat to the environment. Even
so, Davis and Walbot have
decided to delay the experiment
rather than go through the legal
hassles initiated by Rifkin.
"There is no reason why we
should file an environmental
impact statement." Davis said,
"because the experiment will
have no environmental impact."
Davis said that he could see
no possible motive behind Rif
kin's actions, unless the activist
wanted publicity. "He may be
planning to write a book about
recombinant DNA, and to use
this as advertising," he said.
"He's done similar things
before."
