## Morales leads Olympic swimming contingent 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Stanford sophomore Pablo
Morales scored a victory in the
200-meter butterfly Friday and
added a second-place finish in
the 200-meter individual med
ley Saturday to become the only
American man to qualify for the
Olympic team in three events
this year.
Morales' triple wrapped up an
extremely impressive showing
by Stanford swimmers at the
Olympic Trials in Indianapolis.
He followed up last Monday's
world record performance in the
100 butterfly by posting a time
of 1:58.07 in the 200 fly on
Friday to defeat Patrick Ken
nedy of Cockeysville, Md., bv
over a second. Kennedy was
second in 1:59.14.
Morales then came back Sat
urday to snare his third spot on
the team by swimming the 200
IM in 2:03.55, only .24 second
behind winner Steve Lundquist
of Jonesboro, Ga. Jeff Float of
Sacramento swam 2:04.29 to
finish third.
Morales' performance
exceeded his expectations. "I
knew I had a shot at all three
events, but I didn't plan on
making it in all three," he said.
Morales wasn't surprised bv
the world record, though. "It
was my goal all spring," he said,
"but it was still exciting when it
happened."

Despite holding the world
mark, Morales said, "I don't
know if that makes me the guy
to beat. I here are no shoo-ins.
I here's a lot of hard work
ahead. I can't just sit back on
my laurels."
Stantord Head Swimming
Coach Skip Kenney wasn't
surprised by the record either.
"It was predictable," he said.
"At the Nationals (in April) a
couple ot coaches thought he
was capable ot it. His winning
the 200 did surprise me. Craig
Beardsley (the U.S. record
holder) was the favorite, but
Pablo's speed changed the race
strategy."
Four Stanford swimmers —
John Moffet, Susan Rapp, Jeff
Kostoff and Morales —

qualified for the Olympic team
in a total of eight events. Moffet
set the other world record of the
trials with a time of 1:02.13 in
the 100 hreaststroke, and Rapp
set an American record in the
200 hreaststroke with a 2:31.54
clocking.
Because of this performance,
Kenney was named an assistant
coach ot the Olympic team,
joining Cardinal women's coach
George Haines. "It's amazing
how good athletes make good
coaches." Kenney observed.
Kenney was also unsurprised
by Moffet's world mark. "John
had actually broken the world
record in practice," he said.
"There was no assurance that
breaking the world record
would win, though. John had
shown amazing speed in

practice all quarter."
Moffet said, "I'm excited, but
I still have a lot to do." Com
menting on qualifying in two
events, he said, "I would've
been upset if 1 didn't make it in
both events."
Assessing his chances, Moffet
said, "In the 100 it looks okay.
I'm the world record holder and
all. The 200 will be tougher.
Victor Davis of Canada is the
world record holder and Rich
ard Schroeder, the guy who beat
me here, will be there as well.
The good thing is that I didn't
feel good at the trials and 1 still
had a good time. 1 took a day
off, and now it's back to hard
work."
Rapp said she was "excited"
about setting the American
record in the 200 breast, but

hadn't expected to do so well. "I
was just hoping to make the
team," she said. She also didn't
plan on the double. "I was just
going for the 200, and the 100
was just an extra."
Kenney commented, "Sue
was the most relaxed athlete at
the trials. She was smiling the
whole time. In the ready room
before a race most swimmers
look around and watch their op
ponents seem to get stronger,
but Sue just took some pictures
in there and didn't pay any at
tention to the others."
Kostoff was expected to make
the team in three events — the
400 freestyle, the 1500 freestyle
and the 400 individual medley
— but he only qualified in the
IM, winning it with a time of

4:21.37. He finished fourth in
the 1500 and ninth in the 400.
"Jeff never swam the 400
long course (50-meter pool)
well," Kenney said. He has
great turns and doesn't have the
speed for the long course. The
guys in the 1500 have enough
speed to open up a lead and the
endurance to hold Jeff off.
"He told me, '1 procras
tinated too much spring quar
ter,' right after the race. That's
easy to do at Stanford. He's still
upset about it. He learned a
valuable lesson, though, for next
year's NCAAs and 1988."

The biggest disappointment
for Stanford was the failure of
Marybeth Linzmeier to make
the team. Linzmeier finished
third in the 200 freestyle and
did not make the team because
of new rules that limit each
country to two swimmers per
event. Linzmeier was a member
of the 1980 team that boycotted
the Moscow games.
"Being third best in the
United States is an accomplish
ment," Kenney said, "but when
you take away that third spot
you take away dreams.
Marybeth was really depressed.
She made it in 1980 and then
Carter screwed that up, and now
this. Our number one priority in
the next four years is going to be
to get that third spot back."
