The Stanford Girls' Basket
ball Camp ended its most suc
cessful year to date Saturday.
The camp has grown continu
ally since it was started four
years ago. While only 35 girls
ages 8 to 16 participated in the
first camp, this year's session at
tracted 178 campers, and more
would have attended if the camp
had sufficient facilities to ac
commodate them.
"We had 30 girls on our wait
list and we've been filled up for
two months," said Stanford
Basketball Coach Dotty
McCrea, the camp director.
"We're expanding the program
to two weeks next year."
The camp involved funda
mental work, but participants

also played at least two full
games each day. "You can only
do drills for so long before the
kids start to get restless,"
McCrea said.
The camp drew many players
from Sacramento and one from
as far away as Idaho. The cost
was $215 for boarders living in
Branner Hall or Whitman
House, $125 for day campers.
The staff featured four cur
rent Stanford players and three
former Cardinals in addition to
area coaches.
Like other such camps, this
one enables the Cardinal staff to
identify players who may be
recruited by Stanford in the
future. "One of our recruits this
year, Charli Turner, was picked
out by us at the camp," McCrea
said. "It's also a good way to im
prove community relations.'"
