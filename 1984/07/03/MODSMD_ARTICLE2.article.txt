# NLRB calls for USW injunction
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
The regional office of the Na
tional Labor Relations Board
has recommended an injunction
forcing the University to recog
nize United Stanford Workers
(USW) as the University's
union until the Sept. 17 hearing,
according to USW President
Linda Crouse.
Crouse, who received the
news late yesterday afternoon,
said that the regional board's
decision was important because
it showed that "Stanford's viola
tion of labor laws is quite clear."
She explained that the position
taken by the NLRB showed
that, contrary to the Univer
sity's position, the NLRB is ac
tually supportive of USW's
grievance.
USW Counsel Jim Eggleston
said the NLRB's decision was
"significant" because, out of
hundreds of requests for injunc
tions, only "a handful have been
granted this year." By recom
mending the grievance, he ex
plained, the NLRB had con
cluded that there was ir

reparable damage being done
because Stanford workers were
not presently represented by a
union.
"It cannot be said (by Stan
ford) that the Board hasn't
taken a position on this issue,"
he said. "They've taken a
strong, forthright position."
According to University As
sociate Counsel Susan de Jong-
Kearl, the NI.RB decision was
"a big surprise."
"It was our understanding
that the board had decided
against recommending an in
junction," she said. "The direc
tor of the office called us and
told us as much ... to our
knowledge, the decision was
made while he was away on
vacation." She said that the
University would "wait for his
return" to see what had really
occurred.
Jong-Kearl added that though
the injunction had been recom
mended, the decision would be
made at the"Washington
level," by the Washington
based main office of the NLRB.
She said she had no idea how
long the procedure would take,
or what the ultimate decision
would be.
