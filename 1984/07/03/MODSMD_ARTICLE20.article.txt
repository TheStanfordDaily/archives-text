## Effects upstage actors in 'Ghostbusters' 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Bill Murray has such amazing audience rapport
that filmgoers cheer him when he appears in the
trailers for his new picture, Ghostbusters. His self
mocking wild man cool sets a rhythm all its own,
and it sweeps an audience up — tuning in on Mur
ray's weird wavelength can be a gleeful roller
coaster ride. The key to his hilarity is his
ridiculous self-confidence; how could anyone
whose behavior and logic suggest a sphere so
remote from that of most functioning human
beings be so sure of himself? He's like a Martian
hipster.
Except for Tootsie, in which he played a scene
stealing supporting role, the disastrous Where the
Buffalo Roam (where he was cast as Hunter
Thompson), and the odd guest appearance, Mur
ray's films have been Ivan Reitman-directed
trifles showcasing his uniquely flipped-out brand
of comedy. In most ways Reitman isn't much of a
director, but he knows a good comic idea when he
sees it, and in the best scenes in Meatballs and
Stripes he operated like an appendage of the Bill
Murray act, fine tuning the dramatic context to
balance Murray's lunacy as fully as possible. In
Meatballs, Murray played a counselor at a sum
mer camp. Although it was a very slight movie
that developed, unwisely, into a stock tale about
the triumph of an unpopular adolescent, Reitman
and the team of writers, probably drawing from
their own experiences at Jewish summer camps,
got the funkiest details of that peculiarly isolated
milieu right. And Murray's impersonation of a
crazy happily at large in this autonomous mini
society was grounded in reality: He played a more

extravagant version of characters I remember
fondly (and still with some awe) from my own
camp days.
Stripes, in which the Bill Murray persona joined
the New Army, supplied him with an even more
felicitous vehicle, though the picture only sus
tained itself for the first hour, running aground
when Murray and his servicemen pals left basic
training for a stint in Germany. Stripes had the
relaxed small-time feeling of an Abbott and Cos
tello feature from the 1940's — say, In the Navy.
And judging from the pre-release publicity for
Ghostbusters, Reitman and Murray, working from
a script by Murray's co-stars, Dan Aykroyd and
Harold Ramis, have found their funniest idea yet
— casting the comedian as a smooth-talking
hustler who establishes a company for trapping
troublesome ectoplasms. But though audiences
greet everything Murray does in his new movie
with grateful laughter — it's been 18 months since
his last screen appearance — Reitman and the
screenwriters make the worst imaginable mistake
in Ghostbusters: T hey fail to give Murray room to
cut loose. It's not their only miscalculation, but it's
the key one — the error that makes the film such a
disappointment.
Perhaps the picture simply got out of hand. The
filmmakers began with a smashing subject for a
low-budget comedy and then — looking, I
suppose, to compete with this summer's other
blockbusters (Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom, Gremlins, Star Trek ///) — they escalated
the production scale and acquired a load of special
visual effects, designed by Richard Edlund. Many
audiences are now too sophisticated, in these days

of Industrial Light and Magic, to accept the patchwork
ghosts of the less ambitious '30s and '40s efforts, hut in
Ghostbnsters the holograms upstage the actors.
The title certainly recalls the spook story parodies of
the war years — in 1940, following up on the box office
success of the remake of The Cat and the Canary,
Paramount's leading comic, Bob Hope, starred in a
picture called The Ghost Breakers, and four years later
Universal brought out The Ghost Catchers with Olsen
and Johnson.
Traditionally, this genre lays the emphasis on the
haunted, not on the haunters, and as clumsy and out
of-tempo as the first tew scenes in Ghostbusters are,
they do establish a promising trio of heroes. Peter
Venkman (Murray) is allegedly a scientist, but his main
interests are sexual and financial. ("You don't act like a
scientist," Venkman's first client, played by Signourey
Weaver, tells him. "You're more like a game show
host.") Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) behaves like a su
perannuated adolescent with a genius I.Q. And Egon
Spengler (Harold Ramis), is humorless, his voice as
deep and airless as a cellar, his face set permanently for
pre-apocalyptic tension but his demeanor comically
calm. The movie has two possible satisfying routes from
this starting point: Either we can watch these screw-ups
fumble their way into a victory against their spectral ad
versaries, or else we can applaud as Venkman, a char
latan at the outset, saves the girl he loves (Weaver)

from the spirits infesting her apartment. A smart writer
would try to combine the two. But oddly enough, the
movie takes a third path — as soon as Venkman and his
partners get an opportunity to demonstrate their
tinesse as ghost fighters, they rise to the occasion and
achieve instant popular success. Since that occurs 30 or
40 minutes into the picture, the filmmakers have no op
tion left but to build in size, so in the final reel our
heroes take on virtually the entire spirit world. Mean
while, the three characters lose their distinguishing
features, and a potentially funny subject — a romance
between Egon and another deadpan, the ghostbusters
blase secretary (Annie Potts) — disintegrates before it
ever gets off the ground.
The whole movie might have been redeemed, I think,
if the ghost battles had been conceived in comic terms,
but Reitman and Edlund came up with only one
humorous apparition — a squat green gnome that looks
like the face of the talking apple tree in The Wizard
of Oz and spends all its time stuffing food into its huge
mouth. The effects are very well executed (an excep
tion: a monster reminiscent of the mutation in
Prophecy loses all credibility when it bounds across the
screen like an outsize cereal box prize propelled by an
invisible child's hand), but the film ceases to be a com
edy when Reitman clicks them on, and John De Cuir's
production design in the climactic supernatural se
quence isn't imaginative enough to justify all the time

we spend looking at it. And couldn't the makers of
Ghostbusters arrive at a better idea for the image of the
evil ghost commanding all those spirits than a punk
transvestite — Dr. Frank N. Furter with woozy eyes?
It's a pity that so little develops between Bill Murray
and Signourey Weaver, because their first scene to
gether sparks our expectations — she gets laughs by
playing foil to his loopy gigolo come-on, and her utter
amazement at his audacity sets up the romance. (They
end up together, but we never do see the romance.)
And it's a pity, too, that Dan Aykroyd, who looks
somewhat flabby and worn here, once again has so little
to do that he fades out of the movie for all practical
purposes. Eddie Hudson, as a black man who signs on
in the middle of the picture, never even has the promise
of a role. The performer who comes off best is Rick
Moranis, as Weaver's nerdy accountant neighbor who,
possessed by demons, becomes this movie's Renfield
figure (the part Dwight Frye had in the Lugosi
Draculu), wandering the streets proclaiming the im
minent appearance of the Tim Curry lookalike. As the
bad guy, who tries to put the ghostbusters out of busi
ness and precipitates a near-catastrophe by shutting
down the "protection grid" that incarcerates the
captured spirits, William Atherton overacts, but his
character brings the film its sole distinction;
Ghostbusters is the first movie to have an environmen
talist as a villain.
