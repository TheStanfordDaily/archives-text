## Effects upstage actors in 'Ghostbusters' 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Bill Murray has such amazing audience rapport
that filmgoers cheer him when he appears in the
trailers for his new picture, Ghostbusters. His self
mocking wild man cool sets a rhythm all its own,
and it sweeps an audience up — tuning in on Mur
ray's weird wavelength can be a gleeful roller
coaster ride. The key to his hilarity is his
ridiculous self-confidence; how could anyone
whose behavior and logic suggest a sphere so
remote from that of most functioning human
beings be so sure of himself? He's like a Martian
hipster.
Except for Tootsie, in which he played a scene
stealing supporting role, the disastrous Where the
Buffalo Roam (where he was cast as Hunter
Thompson), and the odd guest appearance, Mur
ray's films have been Ivan Reitman-directed
trifles showcasing his uniquely flipped-out brand
of comedy. In most ways Reitman isn't much of a
director, but he knows a good comic idea when he
sees it, and in the best scenes in Meatballs and
Stripes he operated like an appendage of the Bill
Murray act, fine tuning the dramatic context to
balance Murray's lunacy as fully as possible. In
Meatballs, Murray played a counselor at a sum
mer camp. Although it was a very slight movie
that developed, unwisely, into a stock tale about
the triumph of an unpopular adolescent, Reitman
and the team of writers, probably drawing from
their own experiences at Jewish summer camps,
got the funkiest details of that peculiarly isolated
milieu right. And Murray's impersonation of a
crazy happily at large in this autonomous mini
society was grounded in reality: He played a more

extravagant version of characters I remember
fondly (and still with some awe) from my own
camp days.
Stripes, in which the Bill Murray persona joined
the New Army, supplied him with an even more
felicitous vehicle, though the picture only sus
tained itself for the first hour, running aground
when Murray and his servicemen pals left basic
training for a stint in Germany. Stripes had the
relaxed small-time feeling of an Abbott and Cos
tello feature from the 1940's — say, In the Navy.
And judging from the pre-release publicity for
Ghostbusters, Reitman and Murray, working from
a script by Murray's co-stars, Dan Aykroyd and
Harold Ramis, have found their funniest idea yet
— casting the comedian as a smooth-talking
hustler who establishes a company for trapping
troublesome ectoplasms. But though audiences
greet everything Murray does in his new movie
with grateful laughter — it's been 18 months since
his last screen appearance — Reitman and the
screenwriters make the worst imaginable mistake
in Ghostbusters: T hey fail to give Murray room to
cut loose. It's not their only miscalculation, but it's
the key one — the error that makes the film such a
disappointment.
Perhaps the picture simply got out of hand. The
filmmakers began with a smashing subject for a
low-budget comedy and then — looking, I
suppose, to compete with this summer's other
blockbusters (Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom, Gremlins, Star Trek ///) — they escalated
the production scale and acquired a load of special
visual effects, designed by Richard Edlund. Many
audiences are now too sophisticated, in these days
