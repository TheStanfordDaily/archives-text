Court rules on Miranda
Washington — The Supreme Court, in a potential
boost for the growing crackdown on drunken
driving, said yesterday that motorists stopped and
questioned by police for traffic offenses generally do
not have to be warned of their right against self
incrimination.
The justices ruled unanimously that police warn
ings required by its controversial Miranda decision
IS years ago do not apply when officers question
motorists before formally arresting them.
But the court said that once a motorist is formally
arrested or otherwise put "in custody," he or she
must be told about the right to remain silent and to
have a lawyer present, and that anything said could
be used as incriminating evidence.
The court, led by Justice Thurgood Marshall, also
ruled that anyone questioned while in police custody
— not just someone charged with a serious crime —
is entitled to receive Miranda warnings.
Federal and state courts had been split on that
point. Some had ruled that the Miranda doctrine ap

plied only when felony suspects were being ques
tioned. But the high court said it applies to mis
demeanor cases as well.
U.S. agrees on arms talks
Washington — The Reagan administration has
agreed unconditionally to talks with the Soviet
Union in September about curbing weapons in outer
space, U.S. officials said yesterday.
The administration asserted its unqualified readi
ness to meet with the Soviets after Moscow rejected
as "totally unsatisfactory" a U.S. proposal to
broaden the talks to include other nuclear weapons.
It was not immediately clear whether the Soviets
would take the administration up on its latest ap
proach.
Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, un
derscored U.S. readiness to meet with the Soviets.
But referring to the nuclear weapons, he stressed
that "we will also raise these other issues."
But in a speech in Moscow, Soviet Foreign Mini
ster Andrei Gromyko repeated his government's re
jection of the earlier U.S. proposal to merge talks on
space weapons and nuclear missiles, calling it a

"stacked deck" against the Soviets. He said the nu
clear missiles issue has "no relation to the problem
of space weapons.
A U.S. official, who spoke only on condition he
not he identified, said the negotiations would be
held in Vienna, as suggested by the Soviets, or at
"any mutually agreeable location."
Centrists lead in elections
Guatemala City — A new, slickly promoted
centrist party took a strong lead yesterday in the
voting for delegates to the Constituent Assembly, an
election that could be a preview for a presidential
race next year.
With tabulation completed from Sunday's voting
in the Guatemala City metropolitan area, the Union
of the National Center received 88,563 votes or
25.12 percent of the total. The count from the rest
of the country's electoral districts may not be com
pleted until today.
Seventeen parties fielded I 179 candidates tor the
assembly, which will write a constitution to replace
the 1965 document suspended by a March 1982 mil
itary coup.
