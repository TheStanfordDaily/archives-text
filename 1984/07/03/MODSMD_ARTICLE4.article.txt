# Pay phone rates double
## 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
The 10-cent pay telephone call will soon be just
a memory in California, like the nickel movie and
the 25-cent gallon of gas.
Pacific Bell service personnel began converting
each of the state's 171,668 pay telephones to
charge 20 cents per call Sunday morning.
Students who wish to get in a final call at the
10-cent rate will have to hurry, because "Pa Bell"
repairmen will begin converting the 75-100 pay
phones on campus today or tomorrow, according
to District Manager Frank Riddle. Every phone in
the state will be converted by Thursday, July 12,
Riddle said.
I he converted phones are easy to spot, because
the instructions next to their coin slots are printed
in gray and white. The remaining 10-cent phones
have blue instruction stickers.
C alitornia has had a 10-cent rate for pay calls
ever since 1952. Riddle said. The rate was five
cents before that.

Riddle said costs rose considerably during the
32 years the 10-cent rate was in effect. "In 1932,
a pay phone cost us $37 and now it costs $385. A
phone booth cost $150 then and $800 now."
The phone company first asked for an increase
to 25 cents in 1982, and on June 13 the California
Public Utilities Commission approved the 20-cent
rate.
Riddle said Pacific Bell will lose money even at
the 20-cent price. "It actually costs us 24 cents per
call," he explained. " Local pay calls will cost us
$200 million in expenses this year, and we'll take
in only $ 194 million."
In 1982, the phone company lost $100 million
on local pay calls in California, Riddle said.
Only 19 states still have 10-cent pay phones.
Most of California's neighbors, including Oregon,
Washington, Nevada and Arizona, charge 25
cents.
Pacific Bell has not received anv complaints
about the new rate, and does not expect usage ol
pay phones to decline. Riddle said.
