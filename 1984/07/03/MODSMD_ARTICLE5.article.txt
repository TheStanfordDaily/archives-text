# Stanford Band gets around
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
A summer schedule
featuring possible appear
ances at the Olympics, the
Major League All-Star
Game and the Democratic
Convention has the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band practicing
and drum major Jim Kohn
smiling.
According to Kohn, the
Band has received national
attention in the past few
years because of its behavior
on the field and, perhaps
more importantly, because of
"The Play" at the 1982 Big
Game.
"People introduce us as
'the band that dropped their
pants on national television,"
or 'the band that ran onto the
lield,' " he said. "Everyone
knows who we are now."
Kohn said that because of
the Band's fame it has had
requests to play from as far
away as New Orleans.
"1 can't imagine anyone
else would have a band like

we do duiing the summer,"
he said.
The first summer gig the
Band played was at the
Grand Reopening of the San
Francisco Cable Cars on
June 21. "We thought there
would he a lot of other bands
playing and we would only
be on for a few minutes,"
Kohn said. "But really we
were the only band playing
and getting the people dan
cing. The mayor spoke, Tony
Bennett sang I left my heart
in San Francisco,' and then
we played."
The Band may make a big
summer even bigger if it
plays, as scheduled, at the
Major League All-Star
Game in Candlestick Park
next week. Plans for that
rally are still under consider
ation by both parties.
Also on the agenda for the
summer incomparables is an
appearance at the Olympics
â€” either the soccer matches
here at Stanford Stadium, or,
less likely, a stint in Los An

ge\es. Students may remem
ber the Band's somewhat
unique and polished version
ot the Olympic hymn when
they helped to dedicate the
Stadium last fall.
The highlight of the sum
mer, if the Band can pull it
off, would be a rally on the
floor of the Democratic Na
tional Convention at the
Moscone Center in San
Francisco. The city plays host
to the convention Juiy 13-16,
and, Kohn hopes, the
Democrats will play host to
the Band. They have already
expressed interest, lie said.
"Everything is out here
this summer, from the Olym
pics to the convention,"
Kohn said. "Luckily, it con
vinced some people to hang
around and play for the
Band."
Although the Band is not
at full strength, there are at
least 20 members tooting,
puffing and blowing over ;it
the Band Shak and at the
rallies scheduled.
One gig that is definitely
not 'out here' is the Sept. 3
Stanford-Oklahoma football
game, with which the Band
plans to kick off the autumn
quarter. An unexpected re
quest to play at the New Or
leans World Fair has Band
higher-ups up in the air
about whether or not to
"stop in New Orleans on the
way to Oklahoma."
Kohn said that he hopes to
involve non-Band members
in the Band come fall; to do

this, he wants to have guest
"ringers," students who play
a non-Band instrument (such
as violin or vacuum cleaner)
and blend in with the other
musicians. He also wants to
involve outside students in
Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers (SMUT), the group
responsible for planning
Band formations at the foot
ball games.
As for the summer Band,
Kohn invites anyone musical
to join, whether they're a
Stanfordite with a little extra
time to spare, or just a sum
mer visitor.
"Anyone's welcome," said
Kohn. "Sure, why not?"
