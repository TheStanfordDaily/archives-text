# Pipes repaired
## Lagunita to drain 
### LISA LYNCH 
Stanford students who are
staying here this summer are
probably wondering why Lake
Lagunita is still around. Sum
mer visitors are probably won
dering where it's going. Either
way, the lake is definitely on its
way out — aeeording to opera
tion manager Cheryl Jensen, it
should be dry in ii week or so.
Lake Lagunita, or "Lake
Lake" for anyone who knows
Spanish, is actually a reservoir
that is filled each spring and
drained after Commencement
weekend. This year, according
to Jensen, the lake was drained

more slowly than usual he cause
the drains were heing repaired
as the lake was heing drained.
"Now that the drains have
been repaired, it should dry up
real quick/' Jensen said. She ex
plained that the water ran
through drains down Lasuen
Road, into Palo Alto, and even
tually into the hay.
Last spring, damages to
Lagunita's till pipes threatened
the future of the reservoir,
which has been a Stanford insti
tution ever since I eland Stan
lord used it as an irrigation ditch
for 60 acres of horse feed.
