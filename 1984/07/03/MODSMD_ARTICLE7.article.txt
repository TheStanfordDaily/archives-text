## Toxics controversy Critics delay plan 
### 
Sacramento (AP) —
Environmentalists and the
petrochemical industry clashed
yesterday over a heavily
amended $100 million plan to
speed up toxic dump cleanups.
At the same time, a state
commission said California's
track record of fighting hazar
dous wastes has been marked by
"years of failure."
Representatives of oil and
chemical producers, along with
state officials and key law
makers, met late into the eve
ning Sunday and resumed
negotiations Monday in an at
tempt to place a bond measure
on the November ballot to
linance the cleanup.
The measure, AB3 1 N I by As
semblyman Pat Johnston (D-
Stockton), originally proposed
issuing $300 million in voter
approved general obligation
bonds for toxic waste cleanup, a
program supported by the
Deukmejian administration.
But the dollar figure was
reduced through negotiations
between the chemical industry

and the Deukmejian adminis
tration to $100 million, because
of a "general agreement that the
state could not intelligently
spend that much money in the
foreseeable future to clean up
toxic waste dumps,'" Johnston
said.
The result of the negotiations
is a new bill, A 82547 by
Johnston, which combines ele
ments of Johnston's plan and a
similar proposal by As
semblyman William Filante (R-
Greenbrae).
A special two-house confer
ence committee had been
scheduled to hear the bill, but
the meeting was postponed
several times yesterday as the
talks continued, including a ses
sion in the governor's office,
Johnson said.
Filante said the lawmakers
had been unable to reach agree
ment on two key areas — the
creation of an arbitration board
to process cleanup disputes and
the establishment of "consistent
standards" to apply toward en
forcment.
