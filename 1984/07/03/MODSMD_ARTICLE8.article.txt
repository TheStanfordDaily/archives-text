# Mondale claims Ferraro is contender for VP post
## 
### 
(AP) — Walter Mondale interviewed Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro for the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket yesterday and pronounced
her qualified to he vice president and "'clearly
in contention" for the job, while the Rev. Jesse
Jackson announced globe-trotting missions to
Africa and the Soviet Union.
Mondale dismissed growing pressure to
name a female running mate as "politics" and
repeated his determination to select the most
qualified vice presidential contender, regard
less of sex.
Among Ferraro"s supporters for the job are
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill, a million
member labor union, nearly 10 percent of the
Democratic National Convention delegates
and three prominent women colleagues in the
House of Representatives.
The third-term congresswoman from
Queens was the second woman to be inter
viewed for the vice presidential spot on the
ticket. San Francisco Mayor Diane Feinstein
made the trip to Minnesota last week, and
Kentucky Go\. Martha Layne Collins will go
on Friday.
Earlier, Mondale lashed out at President
Reagan.
"Our choice is . . . between two futures: be
tween a Reagan future and a better future,"
the likely Democratic presidential nominee

told the National Education Association in
Minneapolis.
A CBS-New York Times poll released Mon
day shows Mondale trailing President Reagan
by 15 percentage points and losing to the presi
dent among both men and women.
The poll said Reagan leads Mondale 50 per
cent to 35 percent, up from a 12-point margin
Reagan held over Mondale in the same poll
conducted in February. The latest sample of
1600 people has a margin of error of plus or
minus three points.
Among women, the poll said Reagan led 45-
37; among men, Reagan led 55-32.
A Gallup poll released Saturday showed
Reagan with a 19 point lead, 56-37.
Half a continent away, Sen. Gary Hart in
New York also attacked Reagan, declaring
that federal budget deficits of $200 billion a
year are the president's "economic Vietnam."
The third Democratic presidential con
tender, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, told a news
conference in San Diego he will go to Africa
and seek a visa for white-minority ruled South
Africa, and also will visit the Soviet Union
later this year. Jackson returned from a
Central American trip last week with 22
Americans and 26 Cubans who had been im
prisoned in Cuban jails.
