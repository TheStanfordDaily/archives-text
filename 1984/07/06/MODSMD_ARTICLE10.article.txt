# Tapes show Kennedy pressing for civil rights

Boston â€” The dilemma that confronted
John F. Kennedy as he worked during the last
summer of his presideney for a solution to the
nation's festering race problem eomes into
high relief in secretly recorded tapes, released
yesterday, of 1963 Oval Office conversations.
As he strove for a new, stronger civil rights
law, which failed to pass Congress until seven
months after his assassination on Nov. 22,
1963, Kennedy was barraged with exhorta
tions and warnings from impatient black
leaders on one side and from stubborn
segregationists on the other.
The fuzzy, sometimes indistinct tapes made
public by the John F. Kennedy Library, along
with stenographer's recordings of some
presidential telephone talks, reproduce con
versations on the civil rights question between
March 7 and Oct. 30, 1963.
They show Kennedy steering a canny course,
fully aware that the competing pressure tactics
stirred crosscurrents in Congress that affected
the Kennedy administration's support on is
sues far afield from civil rights.
In an Oval Office meeting with black leaders
that was held Sept. 19, 1963, just four days
after a bomb killed four black children in Bir
mingham, Ala., the late Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. warned the president, "More and
more, we're facing the problem of our people
saying, 'What's the use?' and we find it a little
more difficult to get over non-violence."
"I am convinced," continued King, who
preached non-violence, "that if something isn't
done to give the Negro a new sense of hope
and a sense of protection, there is the danger
we will face the worst race rioting we have seen
yet in this country."
Charging brutality and "unbelievable and
barbaric conduct" by police on duty in Bir
mingham. King urged their replacement with

federal forces, but the president seemed un
persuaded.
"It doesn't mean a damn thing," Kennedy
said. "First of all, we've got to get the white
community to take on its responsibilities."
In his dealings with Southern white leaders,
Kennedy showed patience leavened by tact
even though he was clearly haunted by the po
tential for domestic conflict implicit in the ra
cial ferment. Sometimes he intervened per
sonally to persuade Southern officeholders to
act while there was yet time to reduce racial
tensions.
In one such conversation, Kennedy
telephoned Allen Thompson, then mayor of
Jackson, Miss., on June 14, 1963, to inquire
whether "there's anything that we could do to
make the situation less critical down there."
Thompson, whose city had been beset with
street demonstrations, suggested that the ad
ministration "go through the courts and . . .
not have marches and intimidation." Kennedy
offered a counter-suggestion: Hire a couple of
blacks for the police force. On June IS, in an
other telephone chat, Thompson said that he
might be able to find black police candidates.
Southern officials warned of racial con
frontations resulting from demonstrations, and
Kennedy did not disagree. On June 3. he told
Louisiana Gov. James Davis: "It isn't just
Jackson. It's Philadelphia, and it's going to be
Washington, D.C., this summer, and we're
trying to figure out what we can to do put this
stuff in the courts and get it off the streets be
cause somebody is going to get killed."
Kennedy kept in close contact witli the
legislative leaders who were trying to get ac
tion on the civil rights bill. They saw it as an
uphill but winnable tight.
