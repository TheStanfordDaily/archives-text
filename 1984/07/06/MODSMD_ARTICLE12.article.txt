## Middle America accepts male feminists more easily 
### 
I noticed a curious thing the other day.
But before I tell you what this curious thing is, 1
want to give you some background. Think about
the words "feminism" and "feminist." It you're
like the overwhelming majority of Americans,
these words should conjure up something like,
"I'm all in favor of women's rights, but I think
most feminists go too far." This is definitely the

Men don't feel threatened by a
male feminist: it becomes just
another political issue to dis
cuss.

consensus on this matter in this country, which
ignores the tact that it's only these "feminists"
who bother to lobby on behalf of "women's
rights."
It's also interesting to note that feminists are of
ten described as too pushy, too radical, too up
tight about little issues ("chairperson" vs.
"chairman"), and in less polite company are
either called lesbians or described by a vulgar
term which may also designate the female of an
other species. I don't plan to examine why all this
is part of the mainstream view of feminists, just
note that this is the case.
Now the curious thing: male feminists do not
suffer from this stigma.
I noticed this when a (female) friend was com
plaining to me about the "extremist" views of a
mutual friend who is both female and a feminist.
Even though I stood up for every one of these
"extremist" positions, I was immune to criticism,
as shown by the fact that she continued to confide
in me about our mutual friend's "extremism." I
am sure this was. unconsciously, because I am
male.
I've noticed this phenomenon elsewhere as
well, which convinced me it was a general rule. It's
doubly interesting because I'm probably as radical
as all but a few female feminists on virtually every
issue. But that seems to be acceptable to most
people. Women, feminist or not, seem to like the
idea of a man who tries to understand their prob
lems in some way, and they like men to support
equal rights strongly. Men don't feel threatened
by a male feminist: it becomes just another politi
cal issue to discuss. And discussing political issues
is a good traditional male role, so even chauvinist

men can deal with the male temininist.
In short, male feminists are taken to be sup
porters of such noble goals as equal rights, which
is acceptable under the "I'm in favor of women's
rights but I'm no feminist" doctrine of most of
America. Naturally this is a major contradiction,
and could lead to the ridiculous result of having
men dominate the feminist movement, since men
are the most acceptable to Middle America.
Fortunately, feminist organizations show no
signs ot ever reaching this point. But the
politicians who make laws on behalf of these
feminist organizations are almost all male. Female
politicians in this country tend to be overly
"tough," "pragmatic," "businesslike" — male, in
other words — and not vocal feminists. The most
likely woman vice-presidential candidate, for in
stance, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.), is often
described as being "just like a man," and while
she is sympathetic to women's issues, she is best
described as a mainstream liberal. On top of that,
her reputation is built on being a "team player,"
which means that she is still dependent on men —
Tip O'Neill in the House, or for the vice
presidential nomination, the machinations of
Walter Mondale, Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson.
Surprise! It's a male world.
In fact, it's probably only because I'm a man
that most of you have read this column this far,

The most likely woman vice
presidential candidate, for
instance, Rep. Geraldine Fer
raro (D-N.Y.), is often des
cribed as being 'just like a man/

and not dismissed it immediately as feminist bunk.
And I must admit I feel guilty about exploiting the
fact that I am male like that. But whattheheck! It's
for a good cause.
So what should we do about all this? Recognize
the nobility of feminist goals and recognize that
this makes us feminists, even if we would hesitate
to label ourselves so "extreme." What's so hard
about that? In any case, we shouldn't dismiss
feminist positions just because they're being es
poused by a woman. That's ridiculous — but it's
what most people seem to do.
