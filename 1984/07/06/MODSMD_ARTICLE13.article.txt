## Feinstein is the best running mate

As everybody knows, Walter
Mondale has his problems.
His biggest one is that he
desperately needs the enthusias
tic support of Jesse Jackson. He
needs that moment of televised
unity on the platform —
jubilantly raising hands with and
embracing Jackson.
Without a strong black voter
turnout, which only Jackson can
give, Mondale is a loser. The

Viewpoint

problem for Mondale is that this
moment on the platform could
cost him much of the Jewish
vote, which he also needs.
Mondale also faces a possible
revolt on the convention floor
from the women if he picks a
man. Just as much as he needs
the blacks, Mondale needs the
women, and, similarly, he needs
them to go to the polls in fervor
and in force.
There is really only one solu
tion to both problems. That is
Dianne Feinstein. With her at
his side on the convention plat
form and on the ticket,
Mondale's maneuvering room
to accommodate Jackson ex
pands enormously.
Feinstein would also appeal
to the young progressive Hart
constituency and young people
in general. She would draw
heavily from liberal segments of
New York and California, and,
importantly, with her solid
middle of the road record, she
can do this without alienation of
conservative Democrats. In fact,
she generated considerable Re
publican support in her last city
election.
And, finally, the Democrats
probably just won't pass up this
historically ripe moment to pick
a woman and set off all the en
thusiasm and refreshing in
vigoration such a move would
generate. The prospect of gal
vanizing the long-felt senti
ments of women is too good to
pass up. Especially, in view of

the cool Mondale media image,
the Feinstein presence will be
able to add the needed flash of
energy.
So, what will probably hap
pen is that California House
Speaker Willie Brown will be
tapped to engineer the
Mondale/Jackson unification
program. And Richard Blum —
Feinsteins adept, highly success
ful businessman and sportsman
husband — will be tapped to
minimize any male backlash. He
can "talk sense" to the men, and
bring, in addition, vast adminis
trative and financial capabilities
both to the campaign planning
and to a new Washington ad-

ministration. Richard Blum is
the unforeseen depth to the
Feinstein candidacy.
The outlook, then, is for a
roaring campaign filled with un
expected Democratic rapport
and vigor. In one master stroke,
the Democrats will tap the raw
ethnic power from Jackson's
campaign and summon a vast
wave of emotion from the na
tion's women. It will be a cam
paign which the Reagan camp
will be very hard-pressed to out
shine.
