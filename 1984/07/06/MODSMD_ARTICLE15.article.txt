# Professor's commentary: Ronald Hilton
## Can this faith really move mountains? 
### 
Most American departments
of psychology, including that at
Stanford, are dogmatically mec
hanistic, or shall we say Skin
nerian. Parapsychology, or psy
chic ability, is consequently
outside of the limits they have
imposed on themselves. They
therefore react with incredulity
to claims made by non
psychologists like Russell Targ,
who is a physicist, that psychic
power can, among other things,
forecast the future: locate lost
objects, missing persons, ar
cheological sites, and hidden
natural resources; interpret
dreams; and even find a parking
place.
In a way we are back in the
19th century, when Alain Kar
dek was making similar claims
for spiritualism. Kardek, a
Frenchman, is famous in Brazil,
where a postage stamp honors
him, but he is not mentioned in
Targ and Keith Harary's book,
"The Mind Race."
The roles have been reversed.
It is now the physicists like Targ
and engineers like Stanford
Prof, of Engineering Willis W.
Harman whose minds are open
to this futuristic scenario, while
the psychologists, who once
welcomed it, have become the
opposition.
If, as the Bible says, faith can
move mountains, nuclear weap
ons may become obsolete. Even
if it helps us find a parking
space, parapsychology will be a
good investment. Presumably it
is not a shortage of parking
spaces which led the Pentagon
to make a heavy investment in

parapsychology, through insti
tutions like SRI International,
which has a team of experts
working on the problem, a team
from which Russell Targ disas
sociated himself when the Pent
agon stressed the need for
results useful to it.
Sensitive to academic skep
ticism, the Pentagon hides its in
volvement. Not so the Soviets,
who are supposed to be hard
line defenders of scientific
materialism. In an extraordinary
case of symbiosis, the Soviet
Union has encouraged its scien
tists to investigate the claims of
American parapsychology and
to attend sessions of the Esalen
Institute in Big Sur. Conversely,
Soviet interest has prompted the
Pentagon to invest more funds
in parapsychological research so
as to ensure that we do not fall
behind the Russians.
The U.S. media have devoted
little attention to this "mind
race," to use the title of Targ
and Harary's book. We
therefore view as utterly bizarre
the incident when Soviet defec
tor and world chess champion
Viktor Korchnoi charged that
the Kremlin had planted a
parapsychologist in an interna
tional tournament to disrupt his
game. The Russians take chess
very seriously.
Russell Targ is perhaps the
only American with a detailed,
personal knowledge of Soviet
research in the field. He will dis
cuss the American and Soviet
experience in a meeting to be
held in the LGI Room of the
CERAS Building on Monday at

7:30 p.m. The discussion will be
led by Willis Harman. The
public is welcome. We hope that
those with expertise will partici
pate so that this issue may be
raised above the level of the
sensational as manifest in some

feature articles in the press.
Without wishing to appear to
endorse the claims of parapsyc
hologists, we should remember
that "There are more things in
heaven and earth than are
dreamed of in thy philosophy.

was a member of Stanford's psy
chology department, reputed to
be the best in the country.
