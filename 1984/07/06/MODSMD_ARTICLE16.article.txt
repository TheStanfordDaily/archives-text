## Student lab workers stress experience 
### SHINYA AKAMINE 
While most other Stanford
students have left campus tor
the summer, 19-year-old
Toby Lau finds himself in a
cluttered laboratory sur
rounded by test tubes,
beakers and graduated stu
dents. Lau is among the few
undergraduates at Stanford
who are working in research
labs this summer.
The University's reputa
tion as a high-caliber re
search institution both lures
and repels potential students.
While some students have
high hopes of gleaning in
sights from the research,
others fear that teaching will
take a back seat to it.
Relatively few students
realize the opportunity to
work full time in a research
laboratory. For undergradu
ates who find research posi
tions, the experience adds an
extra dimension to their
Stanford education.
Having just completed his
freshman year, Lau is busy
mapping mitochondrial
DNA for biology Prof. Vir
ginia Walbot. Comparing
book learning to hands-on
research, Lau said, "It's an
entirely different experience.
You can talk in generalities.

and you can read about it in
the book, but when you're
getting specific you're as
king. How do you cut that
DNA?' In that way, 1 think
it's very different from book
learning, and a lot more ex
citing."
Nelson Christcnsen. a
senior working in physics
Prof. William Fairbanks lab,
finds that learning in the
classroom can get tiresome
and mundane unless there is
a specific topic he finds inter
esting.
Christcnsen is attracted to
gravity. This summer, he is
working to develop a trans
ducer that will help to con
firm the existence of gravity
waves. "This is really neat
because this is something I
found to be really interesting
in the book, and all of a sud
den I turn around and see the
actual experimentation and
detection right here. I can't
think ot a better way to
learn," he said.
In addition to com
plementing classroom in
struction. working in a lab as
an undergraduate can pro
vide valuable experience that
students feel will help them
find positions in the future.
Christcnsen hopes that the

experience he gains this sum
mer will help him get to
graduate school with his
"feet running."
Another student, inter
ested in attending medical
school, hoped her lab experi
ence would help her med
school applications "stand
out." Still others hope the
recommendations they can
earn will be useful when ap
plying to graduate schools.
But working in labs also
has its drawbacks. Most of
the students interviewed re
ported having to watch their
budgets carefully. Although
the salaries are not high, Lau
said he receives a fair wage,
and quickly added, "It beats
food service."
In some cases students ac
tually lose money by working
in lab jobs. Although stu
dents can expect to be paid
between $4.50 and $7 an
hour, living in the high-cost
Palo Alto area makes it diffi
cult to save money.
Debra Yeh and Mike
( hang, both working for Dr.
Peter Wood at the Stanford
Heart Disease Prevention
Program, are making far less
than what they could earn in
other jobs, even other lab
jobs. In fact they are not ear

ning enough to pay for their
living expenses.
They are working at Stan
ford because they were cho
sen as two of roughly 100
American Heart Association
scholarship winners
i had to get away from
Berkeley," said Yeh, a senior
majoring in biology. "Also,
there is a certain amount of
prestige associated with
everything to do with Stan
ford.''" In addition, Yeh was
particularly interested in the
emphasis on nutrition in her
research.
Chang, a senior at UCLA,
also chose Wood's lab out of
interest. Chang majors in
kinesiology, the study of the
human body in motion, and
he prefers to view the body
from a holistic perspective.
Though the actual levels of
responsibility differ, all of
the undergraduates inter
viewed felt their research ac
tivity was meaningful. They
said they often find them
selves committed to projects,
sometimes working nights
and scheduling around
lengthy experiments.
Research positions for un
dergraduates are few, per
haps numbering less than 40
campuswide. It seems,

however, that interest is the
major factor when deciding
who gets these positions.
Since positions specifically
reserved for undergraduates
are uncommon, often it is the
student who contacts the
professor. Christensen ap
proached Fairbank after
taking a seminar from him.
Other students just happen
to be in the right place at the
right time.
Dr. Peter Michelson, a
senior research associate
who works with Christensen,
said "if there is any money
available, all the student
must show is a real interest
and a general knowledge of
the field." He described the
hiring of undergraduates as
"a part of the educational
mission."
The educational mission is
embraced by undergraduates
who opt to do research over
the summer. They speak
excitedly about gaining expe
rience and learning. The
sense of personal growth is
evident in Lau's description
of summer research.
"Working at a lab job versus
working at Great America is
kind of like working at
McDonalds versus being
your own chef."
