## 
### KEVIN CRACRAFT 
As part of a change in customer service, the Wells
Fargo Bank office at Tresidder is significantly altering
its check cashing policy. It will now cost non-Wells
Fargo customers $1 per check or $10 per year to cash
checks at the bank.
Wells Fargo is also renovating its physical layout as
part of an extensive remodeling of the second floor of
Tresidder Union. The hank's planned changes "led to
the plan to remodel the entire second floor of Tresid
der," said Tresidder director Ellie Oppenheim.
The remodeling project will begin on Monday and

- continue through the summer.
Physically, the bank is "downsizing" its facility. The
inside of the office will be smaller, with fewer person
nel. The walk-up windows will remain, but will be
shifted from their present location on the left side of the
entrance to the right side of the bank's front entryway.
In their place, three new automatic teller machines will
be installed. One will be a Wells Fargo machine, an
other will belong to the Stanford Federal Credit Union
and the third will belong to a bank that has yet to be de
termined.
While many bank services will remain, some will

change. The opening and closing of accounts, travelers'
checks and merchant services will all be conducted
inside the bank. Withdrawals, deposits, and check cas
hing will be done at either the walk-up windows or the
automatic teller machines.
"Customer service will be t ocuscd Oil the Willk-lip
windows and automatic tellers," stated Oppenheim. In
addition, a telephone hotline inside the bank will pro
vide access to bookkeeping information. Information
about account balances and cleared checks status will
be stored at another branch, and can be accessed
through this hotline.
