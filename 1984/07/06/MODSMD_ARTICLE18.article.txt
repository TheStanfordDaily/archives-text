# Turner's daughter discusses father, fame
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
Beneath the filter of the University's
eucalyptus trees, few people at Stanford
are aware that Canadian Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau recently resigned after
16 years in office.
Stanford students might take more
notice, however, if they knew that
Trudeau's successor, John Turner, has a
daughter who will be a senior here next
fall.
An English and history major,
Elizabeth Turner discussed her father
and his politics during a telephone inter
view from her grandmother's home in
Winnipeg earlier this week.
John Turner agreed to accept election
as the leader of the Canadian Liberal
Party three weeks ago in Ottawa. In
Canada, the leader of the ruling party
automatically becomes the new prime
minister. Turner took the oath of office
last weekend.
In order to remain prime minister.
Turner must win an election within nine
months. The big question is whether he
will call the election immediately or wait
until later in the fiscal year when his
policies have had some time to take ef
fect.
Few people who know Elizabeth know
about her father's role in Canadian
politics, and she likes it this way.
Publicity "can definitely be a pain in the
ass," she explained.
She said s*he is not always recognized
in public, especially far away from the
capital. Canadians are not as preoc
cupied with the intimate details of their
leaders' personal lives as Americans are,
she said.
"He's been out of government for

eight years," Elizabeth explained, "but I
still wanted to sort of get away and start
something on my own."
This does not mean she is totally
divorced from her father's politics,
however. "Sometimes when he was get
ting ready for a speech, I would sit in and
give pointers," she said.
In fact, she flew directly to the Liberal
Party convention which elected her fa
ther to succeed Trudeau immediately
after her last final exam this spring. "It
was like a crash course in Canadian
politics," she said.
"It's wrong to get so carried away with
school that you forget. I was separated
from some of the main issues by being at
Stanford."
According to Elizabeth, this is not the
first time her father was asked to become
leader of the party. When Trudeau
threatened resignation in 1979, Turner
was asked to take his place.
But Turner decided to stick with his
retirement and resolve "other pressures"
before taking such a position. The 1979
offer was a surprise because Turner had
resigned from his position as Minister of
Finance in 1975.
The Canadian finance minister oc
cupies a position "similar in duty to your
secretary of the treasury and the right
hand man like your secretary of state,"
Elizabeth said.
Trudeau and Turner got into a dis
agreement which "had something to do
with wage and price controls," she said.
"1 think my father supported voluntary
wage or price controls and Trudeau did
not."
Neither man talks about it much. Ac
cording to Elizabeth, the incident is the

reason her father has a reputation as a
political conservative.
Turner is expected to apply conserva
tive policies to Canada's tailing eco
nomy. "It depends on where you look at
it from,'' she explained. "He likes to
think of himself as a good compromise
for both sides."
By portraying himself as a moderate.
Turner hopes to win support from voters
on hoth sides of the political spectrum.
Although he is a member of the same
party as Trudeau, Turner will have to
separate his image from that of his
predecessor in order to avoid being
blamed for Canada's high unemploy
ment and low gross national product.
Elizabeth said her father will propose
dramatic measures to combat his
country's economic problems.
"According to the press, it all happens
in the first week after he is sworn in. Un
employment is the big problem, espe
cially youth unemployment which is
really bad. I think he plans a lot of train
ing and retraining programs for the work
force," she said.
Women's issues are also extremely im
portant to her father, Elizabeth said.
"During the leadership convention,
the women became a big force on the po
litical scene. Up to seven of nine
delegates could have been women. 1
think it will be a big issue."
In addition, she said her father's ad
ministration will pay great attention to
the problems of Western Canada.
Under the parliamentary system ot
government, the prime minister must run
for election from a single local district.
"Instead of running from a district in
Ottawa, where he is assured of support.

he will he running from British Columbia
â€” a big risk," she said. In any case, she
hopes to help with his campaign. "It
really depends on when he runs," she
said. "I have to finish my job this sum
mer; that is a committment. But I would
like to work on the campaign."
What does her father's new status as a
world leader mean to Elizabeth?
"1 sometimes get attention," she said.
"Mostly at public functions where he ap
pears. But not much. In Canada, we
don't have to worry about the prime
minister being shot at. Security isn't as
tight. I have three younger brothers and
they are only sometimes uncomfortable
about it. We aren't used to it. We try to
stay out of the scene."
Although the government asked to
protect her with bodyguards, she
rejected the request.
Elizabeth studied at Stanford's Berlin
campus last fall and enjoyed the experi
ence. During the two quarters following
her return, she continued to study inter
national relations, French and German.
Despite her interest in international
relations, however, she said she has no
particular aspirations for a political
career of her own.
"I think of politics as not something
that you decide to get into yourself," she
explained. "International relations is not
necessarily political. I just definitely
want to do some work overseas."
It is not yet clear what form her over
seas career will take.
Like most other students about to en
ter their senior year, she said her plans
for after graduation are still "a good
question."
