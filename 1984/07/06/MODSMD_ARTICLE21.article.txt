## Geiger says Court ruling may help Stanford 
### JASON COLE Senior sportswriter 
Despite gloomy predictions
lor the rest of the nation's col
lege football teams, the Su
preme Court decision last week
to strip the NCAA of its control
over television rights might
mean a net gain for the Stanford
Department of Athletics.
At least that's what Athletic
Director Andy Geiger predicts
in the aftermath of the decision
and an NCAA meeting held in
Chicago last week. That predic
tion was made although a con
tract for major network
coverage has yet to be worked
out.
Geigers optimism is based on
the contract the Pacific 10 Con
ference is already committed to
with Metro Sports, a syndicated
television network based in
Roclcville, Md., that televises
Pac-1 0 basketball.
The Metro Sports contract will
garner the conference approxi
mately $5.04 million for
regional coverage 'alone. Last
year, the conference received
about $7.2 million in television
revenue.
Thus, with network television
providing another "$3-5 mil

lion", according to Cicigcr, the
conference will have at least $8
million tor revenue sharing. The
exact division of that sum will be
determined during the confer
ence meetings in August.
Last year, Stanford received
roughly $385,000 from confer
ence sharing without making a
television appearance. The year

before, ;iltcr milking four ap
pearances, the department
made $ 1.9 million and kept $ 1 .2
million of it after sharing.
Next year, the budget calls for
$400.000 in television earnings
â€” the equivalent of one net
work appearance. With the
Metro Sports contract already
accounted for, the department

seems well on the way to
meeting its projection even if
doesn't get a network game.
For a while last week, though,
the Metro Sports contract
looked like it was going to tall
through. Despite having made
commitments several weeks ago
in the event of the Supreme
Court's decision, the Pac-10
faced an apparent stumbling
block.
USC President James /um
herge announced Friday that his
university "has begun negotia
tions for commercial telecasts of
1 y<S4 football games."
That departure may have led
to a boycott of the Trojans by
the rest of the conference and,
as Geiger explained, "No con
ference as we know it."
But that fear has been sof
tened by assurances from USC
that it would sign on with the
rest of the conference. Those as
surances came privately after
the NCAA meetings, according
to Geiger.
Under the Metro Sports con
tract, Stanford could "very pos
sibly" make two regional ap
pearances, with the Arizona
State, Illinois or Washington
games being the most likely op

portunities.
Another rumor indicated that
the time of the annual Big
Game against UC-Berkeley
would be changed to accomo
date television. But Geiger
seemed firm when asked about
the possible change, saying,
"We won't change (the time),
no matter what."
The question that still
remains, however, is what will
happen with major network
coverage. According to Geiger,
the NCAA will try to revamp its
present policy to allow teams
greater flexibility.
"The Supreme Court didn't
tell them (the NCAA) what to
do. It just told them they were
doing something wrong," said
Geiger. "Now the NCAA will
go back to the drawing board
and see if it can come up with
something new."
That "something new" will
probably be a 50 percent cut
back in the number of hours the
NCAA controls for network
broadcast. Instead of determin
ing all seven hours of Saturday
programming, the NCAA
would only have three and a half
and leave the rest for the indi
vidual schools to negotiate.

The greatest fear among col
lege coaches and administrators
is that this will create a wider rift
between the major powerhouses
and the smaller, less- prominent
schools: Without the NCAA
rules, schools like Notre Dame,
Georgia, Nebraska and Okla
homa will dominate the screen.
Geiger agreed with that,
saying, "You're going to see
fewer schools on the networks."
But he also pointed out that this
probably wouldn't affect Stan
lord as much as other less pow
erful schools.
As the last two years indicate,
Stanford's ability to draw a net
work appearance varies drasti
cally from year to year. "If we
have a player like an Elway or
we're winning, the networks are
interested," Geiger explained.
But Stanford will always have
the ability to draw for two
reasons. "First, we throw a lot
and as a result are very unpre
dictable. We can be very excit
ing," Geiger explained.
"Second, the prestige of the
University combined with its
athletic program make us very
attractive to the networks."
