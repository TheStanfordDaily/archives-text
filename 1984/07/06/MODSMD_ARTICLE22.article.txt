Olvmpic organizers here are
lacing difficult challenges in
providing housing, transporta
tion, and security for the up
coming Olympics.
Stanford will host several
rounds ol the Olympic Soccer
competition, beginning Sunday,
July 29 ;it 7 p.m. and ending
August S. Stanford Stadium has
been chosen as the site for the
matches and the campus will be
the Olympic Village.
1 he athletes will be housed in
Branner Hall, which will accom
modate four teams at one time.
I he teams will be housed on a
rotating basis between Stanford
and Pasadena, where other
Olympic matches will take place
at the Rose Bowl. Branner will
be home to teams from Costa
Rica, West (iermany, Egypt and
the United States.
Stanford Food Service will
cater to the 140 Olympians.
They w ill be fed at Branner on a
rigid food plan â€” three meals a
day plus a snack. The food ser
vice will take into account spe
cial needs of the athletes.
Transportation will be han

died through a system of vans
manned by Los Angeles Olym
pic Organizing Committee
(LAOOC) volunteers, who will
drive the athletes to and from
various spots.
The LAOOC has accredited
more than 700 staff members,
600 of whom are volunteers
from the local area. The skills of
these people will be applied in
many ways, ranging from secur
ity, interpreters and translators
to messengers, runners, van
drivers and ushers.
The Olympic effort involves
the entire community. "We
have an incredible group of
people working with us," said
project coordinator Brenda
Pascoe. A 19N3 Stanford
graduate, Pascoe is enthusiastic
about the support the commu
nity has invested in the upcom
ing events.
The Olympic Neighboring
Committee is a community rela
tions group that is rallying mer
chants, neighbors and
politicians to help the Olympic
effort. It has sponsored every
thing from coloring contests and
parades to t-shirt sales and pic

nics. On July 22 from 11:30
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Rinconada
Park in Palo Alto (Newell and
Middlefield Roads), the com
mittee is sponsoring a day of
soccer and music, to welcome

Olympians from West Ger
many, Brazil, Costa Rica, Mor
rocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
the USA to the community.
Despite the growing anticipa
tion of the games, many Stan

lord students fear their campus
may be turned into an armed
camp. Pascoe admits security
will be tight, but the athletes will
have the freedom to go where

No, sports fans, Branner Hall has not been converted into a dorm for freshmen who steal from
their roommates. The barbed-wire topped chain-link fence is merely part of the security prepara
tions for the Olympic soccer teams that will be staying at Branner when the Games open at Stan
ford July 29.
