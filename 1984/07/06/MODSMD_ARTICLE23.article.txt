Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Geiger announced Wed
nesday that Sam Koch — head

Men's Senior select soccer team
and assistant coach at Boston
College — has been appointed
head men's soccer coach at
Stanford.
Koch replaces Nelson Lodge
as the Cardinal soccer coach.
Lodge's contract was not
renewed after last season.
The lateness of the decision
— practice begins in less than
two months — was surprising to

senior letterman Angel Vaz
quez. "I figured they'd decide
sooner than this," he said. "This
is really kind of late. We still
don't know exactly when
practice starts, and there are a
lot of little administrative things
that he's going to have to take
care of before this. -
Vazquez said he had not
learned of the decision and that
the appointment of a coach
from the East Coast was unex
pected. "We — the players and
the trainers — had talked about
the names we heard mentioned,
and most of them were local or
from around California."

This past season. Koch
coached the Massachusetts
Senior select team to the Boston
College Indoor Soccer Tourna
ment championship and second
place at the U.S. Soccer Federa
tion Regional Indoor Tourna
ment.
Geiger also announced Wed
nesday that Helen Keohane —
varsity girl's soccer coach at
Berkeley High School — has
been named named head coach
of the Stanford women's soccer
program. The women's program
has been elevated from club to
varsity status for the coming
season.
