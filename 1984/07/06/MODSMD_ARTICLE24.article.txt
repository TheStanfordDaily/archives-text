A LA CARTE
2310 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
494-7478
Sophie Nicolos, owner of A
La Carte, is an old hand in the
restaurant business. She ran La
Potiniere in San Francisco suc
cessfully for years before
mov ing to the Peninsula to open
Alouette on Lytton Avenue, in
Palo Alto about li \e years ago.
That was a very small location
and also unpleasantly hot in the
summer, so she decided to move
and expand. The result is the
present restaurant on LI
Camino.
The restaurant's building
used to be the site ol a fish and
chips fast-food joint, and for
those familiar with the earlier
establishment, entry into A La
Carte will be quite a surprise. It
is a place of understated, simple
elegance, tastefully decorated
with flowered wallpaper,
plaques and photographs, and
an occasional piece ol antique
furniture. We were seated
promptly and courteously on a
Monday evening of rather light
traffic. About one third of the
twenty-odd tables were occu
pied.
A modest but respectable
wine list was quaintly presented
on a wine bottle, with prices
ranging from $9 to $25 per bot
tle for California and French se
lections. All wines are available
by the glass as well, for $4.25
and up. Standard items on the
printed menu are limited to ap
petizers, soups, salads and
desserts. Dinner entrees are

presented handwritten on a
plate, giving the impression that
a different list is produced daily.
The Monday menu had a fair
mix of seafood, fowl and red
meat, ranging in price from
$11.50 for chicken breast in
ginger sauce to $17.25 for sal
mon, or prawn in garlic butter,
or rack of lamb Dijonnaise.
Among the appetizers there
were fish and meat terrines (a
type of pate), as well as the stan
d a rd escargots, ranging from
$3.95 to $5.25. There is I rench
onion soup, crab bisque, and
soup ol the day; the latter of
erudite (a selection from the the
salad carte) included with din
ner. Other salads are also
available.
We tried the terrine aux pois
ssons (fish pate) in cream based
dill sauce, and the cream of
cauliflower soup. The pate had
very fine texture, and the whole
peppercorns in it added a nice
touch. Unfortunately, it was a
bit too heavily salted, The dill
sauce was delicate and excel
lent. The soup, with a touch of
salt and pepper added, was very
line. It had the correct consis
tency for a cream soup.
The assortment of salads in
eluded green beans, cauliflower,
carrots, mixed vegetables, and
rice, and frankly, was not im
pressive. The rice was under
cooked, the green beans were
overcooked, and everything
needed salt. Among the
entrees, we tried the chicken
and the white salmon
provencale. Chicken breast is
easy to dry out, but this was
crispy outside and moist inside.

The sauce was subtle with just a
hint of ginger, quite enjoyable.
The salmon was superb; tender
and pertectly poached, with a
tangy tomato sauce. Both
entrees arrived with rice and
pureed broccoli. T his reviewer
prefers tackling vegetables in
their pristine, crisp state, and
was sorry to be deprived of theis
opportunity. However,
Europeans are more used to
pureed vegetables, and it is not
an inappropriate accompani
ment in a French restaurant.
Despite my prejudice, it actually
tasted good.

The dessert menu is rather
short, consisting ot strawberry
tart, chocolate Grand Marnier
cake, chocolate mousse, vac
herin, and creme caramel with
lemon sauce. The vacherin -
vanilla and chocolate sauce -
was fabulous. The meringue was
extraordinarily crisp, the al
monds toasted just right, and
the flavors were perfectly
balanced, the chocolate cake
was pleasantly moist and aro
matic with neither too much,
nor too little Grand Marnier.
Service was good throughout.
The waiter was prompt and

courteous, and manager Marie-
Jose Launay was very generous
with her time and attention
without being overbearing, the
restaurant's atmosphere was
generally pleasant, friendly and
inviting.
The whole dinner for two, in
cluding a $12 bottle of French
white burgundy, came to $57
without tip. It is a bit above the
average student budget, but if it
is time to celebrate, I would rec
ommend A La Carte.

their pristine, crisp state, and
was sorry to be deprived of theis
opportunity. However,
Europeans are more used to
pureed vegetables, and it is not
an inappropriate accompani
ment in a French restaurant.
Despite my prejudice, it actually
tasted good.

The dessert menu is rather
short, consisting ot strawberry
tart, chocolate Grand Marnier
cake, chocolate mousse, vac
herin, and creme caramel with
lemon sauce. The vacherin -
vanilla and chocolate sauce -
was fabulous. The meringue was
extraordinarily crisp, the al
monds toasted just right, and
the flavors were perfectly
balanced, the chocolate cake
was pleasantly moist and aro
matic with neither too much,
nor too little Grand Marnier.
Service was good throughout.
The waiter was prompt and

courteous, and manager Marie-
Jose Launay was very generous
with her time and attention
without being overbearing, the
restaurant's atmosphere was
generally pleasant, friendly and
inviting.
The whole dinner for two, in
cluding a $12 bottle of French
white burgundy, came to $57
without tip. It is a bit above the
average student budget, but if it
is time to celebrate, I would rec
ommend A La Carte.
