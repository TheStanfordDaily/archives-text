Getting a good Chinese meal
in the area doesn't necessarily
involve making a journey to San
Francisco's Chinatown. Just one
block fron the Farm is King
Chuan, a small, better-than
average Chinese restaurant
specializing in Szechuan and
Peking fare.
King Chuan, tucked away in
the south side of the Town and
Country Village Shopping Cen
ter at the corner of Embar
cadero and El Camino Real, dif
fers little in decor from any
other Chinese restaurant. The
darkness tempers the effect of
the usual ornate lamps, mirrors,
and bamboo decorations. We
found the chopsticks, engraved
with the phone number (323-
6550), a little overbearing, and
on the whole the atmosphere
falls somewhere between func
tional and pleasant. The huge
menu suggested that the empha
sis here, like at most Chinese
restaurants, was on the food,
not the decor.
Our waiter brought us a pot
of tea as we sat down, a nice
courtesy which was a testament
to the extent of the menu.
Making a decision was difficult.
There was an ample selection
of appetizers, both hot and cold.
The range of main dishes was
vast, with more than a dozen
choices under each of the pork,
beef, fowl and seafood
headings. The chow mein and
vegetables sections were also
large. The wine list was not ex
tensive but who goes to a

Chinese restaurant to drink
wine anyway? Sake was listed,
hut we opted for a couple of
bottles ot tasty Tsing Tao, im
ported Chinese beer.
We decided on the assorted
hot appetizers (for two) ($4.75)
which included egg rolls, fried
wonton and fried chicken wings.
It we had been older, our waiter
said, he would have suggested
that that particular appetizer
might be too much food, but
since we appeared to be stu
dents (Was it that obvious?), he
withheld his admonition, assum-

ing that we had hearty student
appetites. His judgment was not
unfounded, as only the chicken
bones remained on our plates,
the egg rolls were crisp, but the
won ton was only so-so, being al
most entirely crust.
We intended our order of mu
shu vegetables ($4.25) to be a
side dish with our main course,
but our waiter brought it imme
diately after the appetizers, an
informed decision on his part.
Containing mushrooms,
cabbage, onions, and eggs, the
crepe-like dish proved to be an

excellent prelude to the main
course and could provide a light
main course for a vegetarian. In
fact, the selection of both mild
and hot and spicy vegetable
dishes offers an attractive as
sortment for the vegetarian to
choose from. Our waiter, whose
judgment was flawless, also sug
gested the eggplant with garlic
sauce ($4.25).
Our main dishes arrived, with
the simple complement of a
bowl of steamed rice as we
finished our mu-shu vegetables.
Although marked with a red
diamond on the menu
(indicating a hot and spicy dish),
the twice-cooked pork only
mildly tingled the palate. Those
who fear Szechuan food may
want to exercise care in selec
tion, and assume that other
diamond-marked dishes live up
to the designation.
The chicken with garlic sauce
($4.75) contained just the right
amount of garlic, a perfect
seasoning for the chicken, car
rots, onions, and green peppers
which comprise the dish.
An insert to the menu alerts
the reader to nightly specials,
some of which we hated to pass
up — lemon chicken, Szechuan
hot lish, and hot and sour
chicken. Whatever the specials
may be, get your waiter to
describe their preparation
before you order from the stan
dard menu. One of these may be
particularly appealing to your
taste.
As many Stanford students
will tell you, the reputation of
the restaurant is built on these
Szechuan specials.
