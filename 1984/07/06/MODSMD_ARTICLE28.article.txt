## Bay Area summer theater round-up 'Transylvania'-jokes soon wear thin 
### MARC FAJER 
A rather entertaining group
of shows have opened in the
area since Spring quarter ended.
"La Cage aux Folles" is the star
attraction, but each has some
thing to recommend it. In order
of appearance:
"Welcome to Transylvania"
opened June b at the Alcazar
Theatre. It is a British music hall
version of the Dracula story
featuring "Hill Street Blues"
star Joe Spano as the narrator
and as the Count himself. The
play, written and directed by

Douglas Johnson, sutlers from a
tendency to drag a joke out until
it bleeds to death, which may be
fitting tor the mood, but does
tend to slow things down a bit.
To be lair, I saw the show on the
second night of its run, and it
seemed to be suffering from
standard second night blues.
The fruitless searches for laughs
that came the night before and
the slight but unmistakable
tiredness of the players and the
jokes hampered the perfor
mances. Still, there is much that
is funny, stylish and clever here,

including Spano, who is quite an
arresting presence and a much
more interesting Dracula than
one might expect (Henry
Goldblume does not send chills
down anyone's spine). The
music hall emcee he portrays is
sleazy and fascinating (and has a
stunningly awful plaid suit). The
contrast between this and the
standard elegant evening wear
of the vampire is striking, as is
Spano's use of the smooth
toned sensual voice of the nar
rator as a weapon when he is
Dracula.
The rest of the cast is uneven.
Shelley Williams, Beth
Cloninger and Lorri Holt are
terrific as the three dance hall
girls who generally act as the
chorus for the show. Their
dance numbers are technical
masterpieces as they carry off
difficult moves that still look as
though they are being per
formed by fairly low-life ladies.
The song "Evil," with Spano, is
especially good. John Tyson and
Kathryn Meisle, as young
lovers, were either directed to
do too much or were just in
capable of staying behind the
fine line that separates parody
from ridiculous overplaying.
Patti Cohenour as the girl
Dracula first attacks in England
does quite a nice job; she is very
attractive on stage and has a
lovely voice. Unfortunately, her
best song, "'.Vanity," which was
quite good to start, was dragged
on too long. Gregory Boyd is
very funny ;is German doctor
with great knowledge of
vampires and little of English;
his malapropisms are some of
the funniest and cleverest lines
in the play. Caspar Thomas is
intermittantly funny as an
Englishman's version of a
Texan. The horrible attempt to

do the accent and posture is
very funny at first, but again, the
joke wears thin.
Nancy Thun's sets and espe
cially Robert Jared's light
design are very good and add to
the mood without getting in the
way of the show. John Asch
brenner's music manages to
do a fine job capturing both
moods of the play, and generally
both the tunes and the lyrics are
interesting. There are a couple
of unfortunate attempts at spe
cial effects that didn't appear to
quite work from the center of

the audience and were, as a
result, distracting. On the
whole, however, the show works
pretty well. The not-so-subtle
sexuality of the dance hall and
the tackiness of its decor some
how add to the atmosphere, and
(wonder of wonders) most of
the frightening scenes really arc
frightening. The first bite is es
pecially chilling, and the use of
the repetition of the victim's
own words as a mechanism of
entrapment is clever and effec
tive. in all, "Welcome to Tran
sylvania" is an often entertain
ing but overplayed production.
