# 'La Cage Aux Folles' – a star attraction
## 
### 
I lie long-awaited opening of
"La Cage aux Folles" at the
Golden Gate Theatre in San
Francisco was a smashing suc
eess. The musical, based on the
play by Jean Poiret and the
movie of the same name, is a
spectacular piece of showman
ship. David Mitchell's sets and
Theoni Aldridge's costumes arc
delightful and exciting to watch,
Jerry Herman's music is warm
and hummable (if not notably
original), and the two leads,
Keith Michel I and Walter
Charles are very good. If Har
vey Fierstein's book is not all
you might expect after "Torch
Song Trilogy" and if some of the
smaller roles are a little less than
perfectly acted, it really doesn't
matter that much. This is
(except lor the plot) a nice old
fashioned glitzy musical, full of
love songs and exuberant dance
numbers, generously coated
with feathers and sequins. It is
simply a lot of fun.
The story, for those of you
who don't know, concerns a gay
couple. Georges and AI bin.
Georges (Keith Michell), is the
proprietor of a nightclub. La
Cage aux Folles, which features
t r a n s v e s t i t e en t e r t a in m en t
(including the "notorious"
chorus girls, les cagelles of
whom more later). Albin is the
great /aza, the star and feature
attraction of the club. Georges'
son, Jean-Michel (begotten in a
brief heterosexual fling years
ago) has been brought up by the
couple, and is on the verge of
getting married. He has ar

ranged for his fiancee's parents
(her father is the head of a
morality party) to come meet
his family and has asked his bio
logical mother to appear. When
she does not, Albin decides to
portray the mother with, as they
say, hilarious consequences.
Michell gives a warm and en
gaging performance as Georges.
His renditions of the love songs
are touching, especially the
lovely "Song on the Sand"
(which sounds a lot like "Bells
Notte" from "Lady and the
Tramp" — remember the two
dogs eating spaghetti while the
Italian restaurant owner plays
the concertina and sings?). Wal
ter Charles, however, steals the
show as Albin. His first number,
"A Little More Mascara" (the
gist of which is that when he is
down, he gets a lift from getting
into drag), is a joyous, funny
and unabashed tribute to being
a transvestite and sets the tone
lor the rest ot his stage appear
ances. "1 Am What I Am," the
first act finale, is a similar plea
for tolerance and is a very
moving and effective number.
Charles combines a wonderful
voice with a marvelous reper
toire of small mannerisms to
build a very appealing character
that is richer than many musical
comedy leading roles.
The minor roles are less uni
formly good. Darrell Carey is
terrific as Jacob, the black but
ler/maid who prances about out
rageously, looking for a way to

become part of the stage show.
Carol I eitel does a very tunny
bit as Jacqueline (whose name is
always accompanied by a large
theatrical gesture with the arms)
a local restaurauteur. Joseph
Breen as the son is less success
ful: he is a fairly flat actor and
his singing voice is surprisingly
weak given the amount he has
to sing. Mollie Smith as his fian
cee does little more than twirl
on and off stage, and Robert
Burr and Laurel Lockhart are a

little less than convincing as her
parents. The chorus, however, is
wonderful. Ten men and two
women portray the dancing
girls, and they are uniformly
marvelous. The dancing
(choreographed by Scott Sal
mon) is stimulating and often
exhilarating to watch, and the
marvel of the costumes is used
to best advantage. They also do
a wonderful job recreating the
campy world backstage com
plete with requisite giggles, leers

and squeals.
Overall, Director Arthur
Laurents has fashioned a pro
duction that is more fun than
anything I have seen for a long
time. Even it the writing is not
all it could he, and if much of
the subtlety ot the movie is nec
essarily gone, this is still an en
gaging and \cry funny show.
1 hough the prices reflect the
lavishness ol the production,
this is worth saving your pennies
tor and making an effort to see.
