# No draft registration, no financial aid
## Faculty, students not surprised at Court ruling 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
with wire reports
The U.S. Supreme Court yes
terday upheld the con
situtionality of the Solomon
Amendment, a controversial
law that requires male college
students to register for the draft
if they want to receive federal
financial aid.
Chief Justice Warren Burger,
writing for the six-member
majority, said the law is "plainly
a rational means to improve
compliance with the registration
requirement."
Stanford officials and stu
dents criticized the decision, but
were not surprised by it.
Director of Financial Aids
Robert Huff said, "The decision
didn't surprise me, given the

conservative nature ot the
court."
Huff said yesterday's decision
will not affect the University's
policies.
"It doesn't change our cir

cumstances, because for all
practical purposes the Solomon
Amendment has been in effect
for a year."
Huff said 20-30 students ap
proached his office this year to
inquire about replacing their
federal aid.
Approximately 4,200 Stan
ford students receive federal as
sistance each year. Huff said.
He has no records, however,
of how many students were ac
tually affected by the Amend
ment this year.
Others in the Stanford com
munity agreed with Huff that
the decision was unwelcome,
but not unexpected.
Matt Nicodemus, a senior
philosophy major who lost
$5,000 in federal aid last year
because of his failure to register.

said the decision was "terrible,
but not a surprise."
"As someone who's been a
public nonregistrant, my friends
and 1 feel we can't count on the
courts and legislature to help

us," Nicodemus said.
"People muy end up doing
time or losing money because of
nonregistration, but it's worth
it,"he lidded.
"If we could stop the
Solomon Amendment, it would
make registration hard to en
force,"' Nicodemus said.
The strongest criticism of the
decision came from Doris Jones,
a draft counselor with Draft In
formation Service in Menlo
Park, who called the ruling "a
step toward fascism."
Although the University's
policy is to replace lost federal
aid with loans of its own. Huff
said the terms of Stanford loans
are not as favorable as those of
federal loans.

Students must pay 5 percent
interest on Stanford loans while
they are in school and S percent
after graduation. In contrast,
the major tederal loan programs
charge no interest while stu
dents are in school.
'The law clearly discrimi
nates against needy students,"
Mutt said. "We hope to change
the law and eliminate that
provision," he added.
In March 19N3, the Univer
sity adopted a policy in which it
substitutes Stanford loans and
jobs for lost federal aid. The
University does not provide
grants for such students,
however.
Nicodemus has waged a
public battle with the selective
service system for almost four
years.
In the summer ol IMSO, lie and
his friend Ed Hasbrouck held a
press conference in Evans ton,
111. at which tliev announced

their noncompliance with the
draft registration system.
Since then, Hasbrouck, a
former University of Chicago
student, has been convicted for
his nonregistration and served
four months of a six-month sen
tence in jail in Lewisburg, Pa.
Nicodemus has received a few
letters from the justice depart
ment, but has not been
threatened with prosecution.
The Solomon Amendment
lias caused financial hardships
for him. however.
Until this year, Nicodemus
received $2,500 per year in
federal grants and another
$2,500 in loans.
When the Solomon Amend
ment first took effect last fall,
Nicodemus lost his federal aid,
but replaced it with $5,000 in
loans from the University.
Stanford's loans carry higher
interest rates than federal loans,
however.
Despite the penalties for non
registration. Nicodemus contin
ues to urge other students to
resist the selective service.
"There are over 500.000

nonregistrants in the country,
but only 16 have been indicted
and only six have been con
victed," he said.
The decision yesterday over
turned a lower court ruling
which struck down the Solomon
Amendment as unconstitu
tional.
The lower court judge held
that Congress had determined,
without trial, the guilt and
punishment of students for a
past act, non-registration, and
that this constituted a violation
of the Constitution's prohibition
on bills of attainder.
The judge also ruled that the
law compels students to in
criminate themselves, a viola
tion of the Fifth Amendment.
In his opinion. Burger said
the law "furthers a fair alloca
tion of scarce federal resources
by limiting . . . aid to those who
are willing to meet their respon
sibilities to the United States by
registering with the Selective
Serv ice."
Failure to register carries a
maximum penalty of live years
in prison and a $1 (),()()() fine.
