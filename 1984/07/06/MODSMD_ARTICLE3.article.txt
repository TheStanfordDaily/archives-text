# No draft registration, no financial aid
## Faculty, students not surprised at Court ruling 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
with wire reports
The U.S. Supreme Court yes
terday upheld the con
situtionality of the Solomon
Amendment, a controversial
law that requires male college
students to register for the draft
if they want to receive federal
financial aid.
Chief Justice Warren Burger,
writing for the six-member
majority, said the law is "plainly
a rational means to improve
compliance with the registration
requirement."
Stanford officials and stu
dents criticized the decision, but
were not surprised by it.
Director of Financial Aids
Robert Huff said, "The decision
didn't surprise me, given the

conservative nature ot the
court."
Huff said yesterday's decision
will not affect the University's
policies.
"It doesn't change our cir

cumstances, because for all
practical purposes the Solomon
Amendment has been in effect
for a year."
Huff said 20-30 students ap
proached his office this year to
inquire about replacing their
federal aid.
Approximately 4,200 Stan
ford students receive federal as
sistance each year. Huff said.
He has no records, however,
of how many students were ac
tually affected by the Amend
ment this year.
Others in the Stanford com
munity agreed with Huff that
the decision was unwelcome,
but not unexpected.
Matt Nicodemus, a senior
philosophy major who lost
$5,000 in federal aid last year
because of his failure to register.

said the decision was "terrible,
but not a surprise."
"As someone who's been a
public nonregistrant, my friends
and 1 feel we can't count on the
courts and legislature to help

us," Nicodemus said.
"People muy end up doing
time or losing money because of
nonregistration, but it's worth
it,"he lidded.
"If we could stop the
Solomon Amendment, it would
make registration hard to en
force,"' Nicodemus said.
The strongest criticism of the
decision came from Doris Jones,
a draft counselor with Draft In
formation Service in Menlo
Park, who called the ruling "a
step toward fascism."
Although the University's
policy is to replace lost federal
aid with loans of its own. Huff
said the terms of Stanford loans
are not as favorable as those of
federal loans.
