# Weak endings undercut plays' strengths
## 
### 
Lynn Redgrave opened June
16 in the Christopher Durang
double-header, "Sister Mary Ig
natius Explains It All For You"
and "The Actor's Nightmare"
at the Marines Memorial
Theatre in San Francisco. Both
plays are very funny, but both,
at least in this production, have
decidedly weak endings which
undercut their strength. As a
result, while the shows are en
joyable, the total effect is rather
unsatisfying, and one can't help
but wish that the imagination
that went into the conception of
the two plays had carried over a
bit more thoroughly to their
conclusions.
"Actor's Nightmare," which
was presented first, concerns a
CPA, George Spelvin (Jeff
Brooks) who unaccountably
finds himself the understudy to
an unavailable actor. Unfortun
ately, the play he is in changes
from Noel Coward to "Hamlet"
to Samuel Beckett to "A Man
For All Seasons" and he is hard
pressed to figure out what is
going on, let alone what he
should be saying. Brooks is very
funny in the early part of the
play as he struggles vainly with
the two actresses (Redgrave and
Mary Catherine Wright) on the
balcony in the Coward piece. As
the play moves into Hamlet's
monologue, however, it loses
something. In this section, the
character is supposed to be
desperately rattling anything off
the top of his head in an effort
to fill time and his spotlight. Un
fortunately, Brooks is too
polished here, the lines are too
easy. It is impossible to believe
that this person isn't a real ac
tor. The Stanford Drama De
partment did this piece last sum
mer and did a much better job
of capturing the lost quality of
the character.
The Beckett section which
follows is very funny; Wright

does a nice job as a loony lady in
a garbage can rattling off her
stage directions as well as her
lines. The final portion of the
show has poor George playing
Sir Thomas More at the close of
"A Man For All Seasons." At
this point the vaguely Catholic
undercurrent of the show begins
to make a little more sense.
George has occasionally
prattled on about his Catholic
upbringing, his desire to enter a
monastery, the fact that this
never happened and his current
disassociation from religion.
Somehow he views the execu
tion as a weird sort of punish
ment for all this. The playwright

does not make the connection
here very clearly, and aside
from the title which suggests
that this is a nightmare, there is
no good reason for the ending.
"Sister Mary Ignatius" begins
with Regrave as a redoubtable
nun confidently explaining the
way the world works. She is
confident and frightening as she
gives neat, absolute answers to
most of the questions sup
posedly given her by the audi
ence. Redgrave does a fine job
both in displaying the absolute
assurance of the character as far
as the world order is concerned
and the vulnerability which she

tries to hide that results from a
difficult family background. The
first half of the play lives up to
the raves it received in New
York; it is thoroughly hysterical,
yet chiling when you realize how
many Americans were raised
with just that world vision being
forced upon them. Sister Mary
is aided by Thomas (played al
ternately through the run by
Ariel Shafir Michael and Philip
Barreras; it was never made
clear to me which we were
seeing) a seven-year-old who
rattles off his catechism in ex
change for cookies. His utter
obedience and conformity were
frightening, though he managed

to get quite a few laughs with
well-placed lifts of eyebrows.
Sister Mary's near-mono
logue is interrupted by a
group of former students who
have come to present their old
Christmas play. This skit is hys
terical. In it, we can see how all
of the nun's stories came to be
incorporated by its author, sup
posedly one of Sister Mary's star
students. In addition, there is a
lot of subtle sacrilegious busi
ness (for example, the plastic
doll Jesus actually being nailed
to a cross). After this, however,
the production goes downhill
rapidly. It turns out that these
are not model former students.
One is an unwed mother (Mary
Catherine Wright); one has had
abortions (Madi Weland); one
is gay (Jeffrey Hayenga); the
last is an alcoholic wife-beater
(Jeff Brooks). The visit has been
arranged by the one who has
had the abortions to get back at
the nun, who she blames for all
her problems. She brings out a
gun and threatens to kill Sister
Mary. At this point, the play,
which had been balanced neatly
on the fine edge between
slightly surreal farce and total
absurdity, falls over. Weland's
explanatory speeches are not
believable, and the final se
quence of events pushes the
play beyond the frightening
reality it had achieved into
chaos.
Overall, the two plays to
gether are interesting and
funny. However, there is a sense
in both that the playwright,
having thrown his Catholic
upbringing, his resentment and
his guilt onto the stage, does not
know what to do with them. In a
weird sort of way, the Catholic
Church ends up beating him
both within the framework of
the plays themselves, and, in a
larger sense, by his inability to
deal with it adequately himself.

last is an alcoholic wife-beater
(Jeff Brooks). The visit has been
arranged by the one who has
had the abortions to get back at
the nun, who she blames for all
her problems. She brings out a
gun and threatens to kill Sister
Mary. At this point, the play,
which had been balanced neatly
on the fine edge between
slightly surreal farce and total
absurdity, falls over. Weland's
explanatory speeches are not
believable, and the final se
quence of events pushes the
play beyond the frightening
reality it had achieved into
chaos.
Overall, the two plays to
gether are interesting and
funny. However, there is a sense
in both that the playwright,
having thrown his Catholic
upbringing, his resentment and
his guilt onto the stage, does not
know what to do with them. In a
weird sort of way, the Catholic
Church ends up beating him
both within the framework of
the plays themselves, and, in a
larger sense, by his inability to
deal with it adequately himself.


Sister Mary Ignatius tells all.
Lynn Redgrave opened June
16 in the Christopher Durang
double-header, "Sister Mary Ig
natius Explains It All For You"
and "The Actor's Nightmare"
at the Marines Memorial
Theatre in San Francisco. Both
plays are very funny, but both,
at least in this production, have
decidedly weak endings which
undercut their strength. As a
result, while the shows are en
joyable, the total effect is rather
unsatisfying, and one can't help
but wish that the imagination
that went into the conception of
the two plays had carried over a
bit more thoroughly to their
conclusions.
"Actor's Nightmare," which
was presented first, concerns a
CPA, George Spelvin (Jeff
Brooks) who unaccountably
finds himself the understudy to
an unavailable actor. Unfortun
ately, the play he is in changes
from Noel Coward to "Hamlet"
to Samuel Beckett to "A Man
For All Seasons" and he is hard
pressed to figure out what is
going on, let alone what he
should be saying. Brooks is very
funny in the early part of the
play as he struggles vainly with
the two actresses (Redgrave and
Mary Catherine Wright) on the
balcony in the Coward piece. As
the play moves into Hamlet's
monologue, however, it loses
something. In this section, the
character is supposed to be
desperately rattling anything off
the top of his head in an effort
to fill time and his spotlight. Un
fortunately, Brooks is too
polished here, the lines are too
easy. It is impossible to believe
that this person isn't a real ac
tor. The Stanford Drama De
partment did this piece last sum
mer and did a much better job
of capturing the lost quality of
the character.
The Beckett section which
follows is very funny; Wright

does a nice job as a loony lady in
a garbage can rattling off her
stage directions as well as her
lines. The final portion of the
show has poor George playing
Sir Thomas More at the close of
"A Man For All Seasons." At
this point the vaguely Catholic
undercurrent of the show begins
to make a little more sense.
George has occasionally
prattled on about his Catholic
upbringing, his desire to enter a
monastery, the fact that this
never happened and his current
disassociation from religion.
Somehow he views the execu
tion as a weird sort of punish
ment for all this. The playwright

does not make the connection
here very clearly, and aside
from the title which suggests
that this is a nightmare, there is
no good reason for the ending.
"Sister Mary Ignatius" begins
with Regrave as a redoubtable
nun confidently explaining the
way the world works. She is
confident and frightening as she
gives neat, absolute answers to
most of the questions sup
posedly given her by the audi
ence. Redgrave does a fine job
both in displaying the absolute
assurance of the character as far
as the world order is concerned
and the vulnerability which she

tries to hide that results from a
difficult family background. The
first half of the play lives up to
the raves it received in New
York; it is thoroughly hysterical,
yet chiling when you realize how
many Americans were raised
with just that world vision being
forced upon them. Sister Mary
is aided by Thomas (played al
ternately through the run by
Ariel Shafir Michael and Philip
Barreras; it was never made
clear to me which we were
seeing) a seven-year-old who
rattles off his catechism in ex
change for cookies. His utter
obedience and conformity were
frightening, though he managed

to get quite a few laughs with
well-placed lifts of eyebrows.
Sister Mary's near-mono
logue is interrupted by a
group of former students who
have come to present their old
Christmas play. This skit is hys
terical. In it, we can see how all
of the nun's stories came to be
incorporated by its author, sup
posedly one of Sister Mary's star
students. In addition, there is a
lot of subtle sacrilegious busi
ness (for example, the plastic
doll Jesus actually being nailed
to a cross). After this, however,
the production goes downhill
rapidly. It turns out that these
are not model former students.
One is an unwed mother (Mary
Catherine Wright); one has had
abortions (Madi Weland); one
is gay (Jeffrey Hayenga); the
last is an alcoholic wife-beater
(Jeff Brooks). The visit has been
arranged by the one who has
had the abortions to get back at
the nun, who she blames for all
her problems. She brings out a
gun and threatens to kill Sister
Mary. At this point, the play,
which had been balanced neatly
on the fine edge between
slightly surreal farce and total
absurdity, falls over. Weland's
explanatory speeches are not
believable, and the final se
quence of events pushes the
play beyond the frightening
reality it had achieved into
chaos.
Overall, the two plays to
gether are interesting and
funny. However, there is a sense
in both that the playwright,

upbringing, his resentment and
his guilt onto the stage, does not
know what to do with them. In a
