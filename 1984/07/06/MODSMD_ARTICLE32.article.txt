# Acting styles clash in 'Greenwich Village'
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Mickey Rourkc's tender face and apple cheeks make
him look soft, untried, yet he's the most worldly of
young actors — it would be a mistake to cast him as a
rube. As a junior league hustler in Diner, he demon
strated how men with boyish countenances and juvenile
charm can use these characteristics as sexual resources.
Rourkc's most extraordinary quality as an actor isn't
his way of defining a character's inner tension so
precisely that we respond viscerally to it. or his uncanny
skill at locating the danger point inside every man he
plays, but his ability to illuminate the turmoil that
produces that tension, that danger, so that we care
about him even when his actions give us pause. This is
the ability that Robert De Niro had once but seems to
have lost in the past few years — when you get danger
signals from De Niro these days, you want to walk away
from him.
As the arsonist in Body Heat, Rourke stole the
picture away from the stars, William Hurt and Kathleen
Turner — both, it has since been proven, considerable
actors — by resisting the reductive hand of the writer
director, Lawrence Kasdan, and remaining firmly
rooted in reality. We might wish to avoid this character
in real life, but on screen he was infinitely more inter
esting than the supposedly explosive lovers. In The
Pope of Greenwich Village, as Charlie Moran, a grown
up street kid from Little Italy talked into robbing a safe
that turns out to be Mafia-owned, he translates a blun
dering, impotent kind of violence into an expression of
frustration — the frustration of a man caught between
warring drives. On the one hand, Charlie' sees himself
as a sophisticated, self-controlled adult, leading a
"civilized" life — he dreams of owning a restaurant —
in which his most generous and ethical impulses can
surface without encountering any obstacles. Diane
(Daryl Hannah), the aerobics teacher he lives with,
represents this side of him: She is a classy WASP from
New England stock with definite notions of morality.
His cousin Paulie (Eric Roberts) embodies Charlie's
other side — the child whose thoughtless pranks and
elaborate displays of ego indicate a staunch refusal to
grow up. Even Charlie's yearning for respectability and
his meticulous sell-presentation have something of
Paulie in them, something of the self-conscious swagger
of an adolescent putting on adult airs. Paulie has a
cockeyed idea that a man's style — his ace, by Paulie's
standards — is a matter of how much money he throws
around, and that way of thinking is reflected, in part at
least, in Charlie's expensive suit. But more than that,
Churlic is drawn to Paulie's screw-it attitude and his
dumb clownishness; Charlie, straining under the yoke
of alimony payments, out of a job (due to Paulie's dis
honesty) and newly informed of Diane's pregnancy,
might well wish he were free from responsibility.
Though he grows furious with Paulie and continually
lectures him on his behavior, he can't help going along
with his doomed schemes and dooming himself along
with Paulie.
Vincent Patrick's screenplay, out of his own novel, is
thematically a replay of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets,
with Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. The friendship
between Charlie and Paulie occupies the major part of
the movie's emotional terrain, so we need a Paulie who

can justify Charlie's identification with him, one of
those possibly psychotic wild men from the early Bruce
Springsteen albums who appeals to the little kid in us,
too. De Niro's Johnny Boy in Mean Streets had all of
that; his performance was a triumph of crossed signals
— we didn't know whether to laugh or sit in appalled
silence when he deposited a bomb in a mailbox and
dashed away to listen to the explosion. Moreover, to
make the rapport between Charlie and Paulie really
comprehensible (and affecting), the picture demands
an actor with the same unfettered, improvisatory ap
proach to acting as Mickey Rourke.
But Eric Roberts is an obsessively careful actor who
has never, in any film or television performance I've
seen from him, come up with one convincing moment of
spontaneity. In an "interior" role like Paul in the PBS
American Short Story adaptation of "Paul's Case"
(directed by Lamont Johnson), or the sailor who at
taches himself to Sissy Spacek in Raggedy Man,
Roberts can be brilliant, and within the confines of Bob
Fosse's unsavory Star HO he did impressive work as a
different variety of psycho, but as Paulie, reaching for a
goofily ostentatious manner, he comes across as heavy
and charmless. The key to Mickey Rourke's acting, I
think, is how much he can express when he's absolutely
still — what happens in his face after Charlie has
stopped yelling and pounding the wall with his fists and
hurling things. Eric Roberts never ceases to move; his
acting in this picture is about how he moves his lips,
how he gets from a grin to a pout, about his consciously
prepared dry-bass line readings, about the half-loping,
half-limping character walk you know he spent hours
devising. And not a minute in it persuades us that
Paulie resides in the same world as Mickey Rourke's
Charlie. Two-thirds of the way through the picture,
Patrick and the director, Stuart Rosenberg, allow
Roberts two no-holds-barred scenes back to back —
one in which he learns that the Mafia chieftain (Burt
Young) whose money he stole has demanded Paulie's
thumb as compensation, and one when he arrives,
bandaged and bleeding and reeling from ingesting too
many pain killers, at Charlie's door — and the resultant
exhibition of emotional pyrotechnics is enough to make
you duck under your seat. It's also such self-enclosed
acting that for Rourke it must have been like playing
off a brick wall — though in fact if he felt any frustra
tion, he doesn't give it away; He couldn't be more
forthcoming if his partner really were the Robert De
Niro of Mean Streets.
Stuart Rosenberg's appreciation for good actors
prompts him to permit them their space — the too
little-seen 1980 Brubaker contained an astonishing
amount of fine supporting performances from people
like Yaphet Kotto, David Keith and Tim Mclntire —
but not everyone on screen in The Pope of Greenwich
Village deserves all that room. Another director might
have toned Eric Roberts down and kept the camera far
ther away from Geraldine Page, who gives an Oscar
bid performance as a hard-shelled semi-invalid whose
son (Jack Kehoe), a cop on the take, falls to his death in
an elevator shaft after surprising Charlie, Paulie and
their safecracking Irish accomplice Barney (Kenneth
McMillan) in mid-theft. Still relying on the mannerisms
that she developed as a younger actress (in her Tennes

see Williams period) — the snarl, the bleary crossed
eyes,the deliberately crabbed passes at emotion, the
mocking stretch of one-syllable words into two ("sow
urr" for "sour") — she pushes every moment of her
two scenes, and I'm afraid now that these mannerisms
have acquired (by dint of Page's longevity as a major
stage and screen actress) "classic" status, and, given the
nature of her part, she may get her Oscar. Really,
though, there's something shameless about the way she
drills those battling old dame lines ("My Walter was as
tough as a bar of iron, and he didn't get that from his fa
ther") into the ground, dissolving in tears and kissing
the cross around her neck as soon as the investigating
cops she's been bullying have gone — and something
shameless about the way Patrick and Rosenberg have
shaped the role to accommodate Page's inclination to
self-indulgence.
The Pope of Greenwich Village may have a plot that
revolves around camaraderie and the Mafia and the
petty aspirations of street-smart Italian Americans, but
it's really about actors and acting styles. While you
watch it, you may complain about composer Dave
Grusin's unfortunate habit of providing an Irish jig
whenever Barney is on screen, or about the holes in the
plot (Barney's effortless escape from the cops, the fact
that Charlie takes so long to listen to the tape he
removed from the dead cop's chest), but when you
leave the theater you want to argue about the actors.
They are the high and low points of the film — the rea
son it is so entertaining for the first 90 minutes, and the
reason it fails. Some of Rosenberg's miscalculations are
possibly connected to his ideas about what will make
the characters "dramatic" — it's a mistake to have
Mickey Rourke, having just torn up the apartment
when he finds Daryl Hannah has left with his share of
the money, respond to the sight of Eric Roberts'
bandaged hand by throwing another chair. And there's
an excess of gruff sentiment: Too many tough men and
women break down and grab their wives or sons or
friends in too many crushing embraces. (The movie
begins to suffocate you in the last half hour.) But it's
because of Rosenberg's affection for actors that Ken
neth McMillan, that impeccable character actor who
has given pleasure in film after film (Bloodbrothers,
Chilly Scenes of Winter, Eyewitness, Whose Life Is It
Anyway, True Confessions, Ragtime) is so lovingly shot
in this picture, and his portrayal of Barney given the
weight and attention it deserves.
At first, McMillan looks so different with white hair,
his accustomed Falstaffian jowls flattened out, his face
rendered more rectangular by the addition of thick,
heavy-rimmed glasses, that you nearly don't recognize
him. Always authentic, he may have immersed himself
more fully in the role of Barney than in any of his previ
ous parts. There is an old misconception that American
actors lack the range and self-effacing temperament to
accumulate, over the years, a gallery of portraits com
parable to those of the most distinguished British char
acter players — the Alec Guinnesses and the Edith
Evanses. Kenneth McMillan, whose entire career thus
far probably wouldn't make up the complete running
time of one movie, should put that myth to rest once
and for all.

standards — is a matter of how much money he throws
around, and that way of thinking is reflected, in part at
least, in Charlie's expensive suit. But more than that,
Churlic is drawn to Paulie's screw-it attitude and his
dumb clownishness; Charlie, straining under the yoke
of alimony payments, out of a job (due to Paulie's dis
honesty) and newly informed of Diane's pregnancy,
might well wish he were free from responsibility.
Though he grows furious with Paulie and continually
lectures him on his behavior, he can't help going along
with his doomed schemes and dooming himself along
with Paulie.
Vincent Patrick's screenplay, out of his own novel, is
thematically a replay of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets,
with Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. The friendship
between Charlie and Paulie occupies the major part of
the movie's emotional terrain, so we need a Paulie who

can justify Charlie's identification with him, one of
those possibly psychotic wild men from the early Bruce
Springsteen albums who appeals to the little kid in us,
too. De Niro's Johnny Boy in Mean Streets had all of
that; his performance was a triumph of crossed signals
— we didn't know whether to laugh or sit in appalled
silence when he deposited a bomb in a mailbox and
dashed away to listen to the explosion. Moreover, to
make the rapport between Charlie and Paulie really
comprehensible (and affecting), the picture demands
an actor with the same unfettered, improvisatory ap
proach to acting as Mickey Rourke.
But Eric Roberts is an obsessively careful actor who
has never, in any film or television performance I've
seen from him, come up with one convincing moment of
spontaneity. In an "interior" role like Paul in the PBS
American Short Story adaptation of "Paul's Case"
(directed by Lamont Johnson), or the sailor who at
taches himself to Sissy Spacek in Raggedy Man,
Roberts can be brilliant, and within the confines of Bob
Fosse's unsavory Star HO he did impressive work as a
different variety of psycho, but as Paulie, reaching for a
goofily ostentatious manner, he comes across as heavy
and charmless. The key to Mickey Rourke's acting, I
think, is how much he can express when he's absolutely
still — what happens in his face after Charlie has
stopped yelling and pounding the wall with his fists and
hurling things. Eric Roberts never ceases to move; his
acting in this picture is about how he moves his lips,
how he gets from a grin to a pout, about his consciously
prepared dry-bass line readings, about the half-loping,
half-limping character walk you know he spent hours
devising. And not a minute in it persuades us that
Paulie resides in the same world as Mickey Rourke's
Charlie. Two-thirds of the way through the picture,
Patrick and the director, Stuart Rosenberg, allow
Roberts two no-holds-barred scenes back to back —
one in which he learns that the Mafia chieftain (Burt
Young) whose money he stole has demanded Paulie's
thumb as compensation, and one when he arrives,
bandaged and bleeding and reeling from ingesting too
many pain killers, at Charlie's door — and the resultant
exhibition of emotional pyrotechnics is enough to make
you duck under your seat. It's also such self-enclosed
acting that for Rourke it must have been like playing
off a brick wall — though in fact if he felt any frustra
tion, he doesn't give it away; He couldn't be more
forthcoming if his partner really were the Robert De
Niro of Mean Streets.
Stuart Rosenberg's appreciation for good actors
prompts him to permit them their space — the too
little-seen 1980 Brubaker contained an astonishing
amount of fine supporting performances from people
like Yaphet Kotto, David Keith and Tim Mclntire —
but not everyone on screen in The Pope of Greenwich
Village deserves all that room. Another director might
have toned Eric Roberts down and kept the camera far
ther away from Geraldine Page, who gives an Oscar
bid performance as a hard-shelled semi-invalid whose
son (Jack Kehoe), a cop on the take, falls to his death in
an elevator shaft after surprising Charlie, Paulie and
their safecracking Irish accomplice Barney (Kenneth
McMillan) in mid-theft. Still relying on the mannerisms
that she developed as a younger actress (in her Tennes

see Williams period) — the snarl, the bleary crossed
eyes,the deliberately crabbed passes at emotion, the
mocking stretch of one-syllable words into two ("sow
urr" for "sour") — she pushes every moment of her
two scenes, and I'm afraid now that these mannerisms
have acquired (by dint of Page's longevity as a major
stage and screen actress) "classic" status, and, given the
nature of her part, she may get her Oscar. Really,
though, there's something shameless about the way she
drills those battling old dame lines ("My Walter was as
tough as a bar of iron, and he didn't get that from his fa
ther") into the ground, dissolving in tears and kissing
the cross around her neck as soon as the investigating
cops she's been bullying have gone — and something
shameless about the way Patrick and Rosenberg have
shaped the role to accommodate Page's inclination to
self-indulgence.
The Pope of Greenwich Village may have a plot that
revolves around camaraderie and the Mafia and the
petty aspirations of street-smart Italian Americans, but
it's really about actors and acting styles. While you
watch it, you may complain about composer Dave
Grusin's unfortunate habit of providing an Irish jig
whenever Barney is on screen, or about the holes in the
plot (Barney's effortless escape from the cops, the fact
that Charlie takes so long to listen to the tape he
removed from the dead cop's chest), but when you
leave the theater you want to argue about the actors.
They are the high and low points of the film — the rea
son it is so entertaining for the first 90 minutes, and the
reason it fails. Some of Rosenberg's miscalculations are
possibly connected to his ideas about what will make
the characters "dramatic" — it's a mistake to have
Mickey Rourke, having just torn up the apartment
when he finds Daryl Hannah has left with his share of
the money, respond to the sight of Eric Roberts'
bandaged hand by throwing another chair. And there's
an excess of gruff sentiment: Too many tough men and
women break down and grab their wives or sons or
friends in too many crushing embraces. (The movie
begins to suffocate you in the last half hour.) But it's
because of Rosenberg's affection for actors that Ken
neth McMillan, that impeccable character actor who
has given pleasure in film after film (Bloodbrothers,
Chilly Scenes of Winter, Eyewitness, Whose Life Is It
Anyway, True Confessions, Ragtime) is so lovingly shot
in this picture, and his portrayal of Barney given the
weight and attention it deserves.
At first, McMillan looks so different with white hair,
his accustomed Falstaffian jowls flattened out, his face
rendered more rectangular by the addition of thick,
heavy-rimmed glasses, that you nearly don't recognize
him. Always authentic, he may have immersed himself
more fully in the role of Barney than in any of his previ
ous parts. There is an old misconception that American
actors lack the range and self-effacing temperament to
accumulate, over the years, a gallery of portraits com
parable to those of the most distinguished British char
acter players — the Alec Guinnesses and the Edith
Evanses. Kenneth McMillan, whose entire career thus
far probably wouldn't make up the complete running
time of one movie, should put that myth to rest once
and for all.
Mickey Rourkc's tender face and apple cheeks make
him look soft, untried, yet he's the most worldly of
young actors — it would be a mistake to cast him as a
rube. As a junior league hustler in Diner, he demon
strated how men with boyish countenances and juvenile
charm can use these characteristics as sexual resources.
Rourkc's most extraordinary quality as an actor isn't
his way of defining a character's inner tension so
precisely that we respond viscerally to it. or his uncanny
skill at locating the danger point inside every man he
plays, but his ability to illuminate the turmoil that
produces that tension, that danger, so that we care
about him even when his actions give us pause. This is
the ability that Robert De Niro had once but seems to
have lost in the past few years — when you get danger
signals from De Niro these days, you want to walk away
from him.
As the arsonist in Body Heat, Rourke stole the
picture away from the stars, William Hurt and Kathleen
Turner — both, it has since been proven, considerable
actors — by resisting the reductive hand of the writer
director, Lawrence Kasdan, and remaining firmly
rooted in reality. We might wish to avoid this character
in real life, but on screen he was infinitely more inter
esting than the supposedly explosive lovers. In The
Pope of Greenwich Village, as Charlie Moran, a grown
up street kid from Little Italy talked into robbing a safe
that turns out to be Mafia-owned, he translates a blun
dering, impotent kind of violence into an expression of
frustration — the frustration of a man caught between
warring drives. On the one hand, Charlie' sees himself
as a sophisticated, self-controlled adult, leading a
"civilized" life — he dreams of owning a restaurant —
in which his most generous and ethical impulses can
surface without encountering any obstacles. Diane
(Daryl Hannah), the aerobics teacher he lives with,
represents this side of him: She is a classy WASP from
New England stock with definite notions of morality.
His cousin Paulie (Eric Roberts) embodies Charlie's
other side — the child whose thoughtless pranks and
elaborate displays of ego indicate a staunch refusal to
grow up. Even Charlie's yearning for respectability and
his meticulous sell-presentation have something of
Paulie in them, something of the self-conscious swagger
of an adolescent putting on adult airs. Paulie has a
cockeyed idea that a man's style — his ace, by Paulie's
standards — is a matter of how much money he throws
around, and that way of thinking is reflected, in part at
least, in Charlie's expensive suit. But more than that,

acting in this picture is about how he moves his lips,
how he gets from a grin to a pout, about his consciously
prepared dry-bass line readings, about the half-loping,
half-limping character walk you know he spent hours
devising. And not a minute in it persuades us that
Paulie resides in the same world as Mickey Rourke's
Charlie. Two-thirds of the way through the picture,
Patrick and the director, Stuart Rosenberg, allow
Roberts two no-holds-barred scenes back to back —
one in which he learns that the Mafia chieftain (Burt
Young) whose money he stole has demanded Paulie's
thumb as compensation, and one when he arrives,
bandaged and bleeding and reeling from ingesting too
many pain killers, at Charlie's door — and the resultant
exhibition of emotional pyrotechnics is enough to make
you duck under your seat. It's also such self-enclosed
acting that for Rourke it must have been like playing
off a brick wall — though in fact if he felt any frustra
tion, he doesn't give it away; He couldn't be more
forthcoming if his partner really were the Robert De
Niro of Mean Streets.
Stuart Rosenberg's appreciation for good actors
prompts him to permit them their space — the too
little-seen 1980 Brubaker contained an astonishing
amount of fine supporting performances from people
like Yaphet Kotto, David Keith and Tim Mclntire —
but not everyone on screen in The Pope of Greenwich
Village deserves all that room. Another director might
have toned Eric Roberts down and kept the camera far
ther away from Geraldine Page, who gives an Oscar
bid performance as a hard-shelled semi-invalid whose
son (Jack Kehoe), a cop on the take, falls to his death in
an elevator shaft after surprising Charlie, Paulie and
their safecracking Irish accomplice Barney (Kenneth
McMillan) in mid-theft. Still relying on the mannerisms
that she developed as a younger actress (in her Tennes

see Williams period) — the snarl, the bleary crossed
eyes,the deliberately crabbed passes at emotion, the
mocking stretch of one-syllable words into two ("sow
urr" for "sour") — she pushes every moment of her
two scenes, and I'm afraid now that these mannerisms
have acquired (by dint of Page's longevity as a major
stage and screen actress) "classic" status, and, given the
nature of her part, she may get her Oscar. Really,
though, there's something shameless about the way she
drills those battling old dame lines ("My Walter was as
tough as a bar of iron, and he didn't get that from his fa
ther") into the ground, dissolving in tears and kissing
the cross around her neck as soon as the investigating
cops she's been bullying have gone — and something
shameless about the way Patrick and Rosenberg have
shaped the role to accommodate Page's inclination to
self-indulgence.
The Pope of Greenwich Village may have a plot that
revolves around camaraderie and the Mafia and the
petty aspirations of street-smart Italian Americans, but
it's really about actors and acting styles. While you
watch it, you may complain about composer Dave
Grusin's unfortunate habit of providing an Irish jig
whenever Barney is on screen, or about the holes in the
plot (Barney's effortless escape from the cops, the fact
that Charlie takes so long to listen to the tape he
removed from the dead cop's chest), but when you
leave the theater you want to argue about the actors.
They are the high and low points of the film — the rea
son it is so entertaining for the first 90 minutes, and the
reason it fails. Some of Rosenberg's miscalculations are
possibly connected to his ideas about what will make
the characters "dramatic" — it's a mistake to have
Mickey Rourke, having just torn up the apartment
when he finds Daryl Hannah has left with his share of
the money, respond to the sight of Eric Roberts'
bandaged hand by throwing another chair. And there's
an excess of gruff sentiment: Too many tough men and
women break down and grab their wives or sons or
friends in too many crushing embraces. (The movie
begins to suffocate you in the last half hour.) But it's
because of Rosenberg's affection for actors that Ken
neth McMillan, that impeccable character actor who
has given pleasure in film after film (Bloodbrothers,
Chilly Scenes of Winter, Eyewitness, Whose Life Is It
Anyway, True Confessions, Ragtime) is so lovingly shot
in this picture, and his portrayal of Barney given the
weight and attention it deserves.
At first, McMillan looks so different with white hair,
his accustomed Falstaffian jowls flattened out, his face
rendered more rectangular by the addition of thick,
heavy-rimmed glasses, that you nearly don't recognize
him. Always authentic, he may have immersed himself
more fully in the role of Barney than in any of his previ
ous parts. There is an old misconception that American
actors lack the range and self-effacing temperament to
accumulate, over the years, a gallery of portraits com
parable to those of the most distinguished British char
acter players — the Alec Guinnesses and the Edith
Evanses. Kenneth McMillan, whose entire career thus
far probably wouldn't make up the complete running
time of one movie, should put that myth to rest once
and for all.
