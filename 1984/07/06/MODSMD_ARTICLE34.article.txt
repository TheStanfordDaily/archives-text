Summertime (1955)
Festival, Palo Alto
In this David Lean-H.E. Bates
adaptation of Arthur Laurents'
play "The Time of the Cuckoo,"
Katharine Hepburn plays Jane
Hudson, an American spinster
who takes a Venetian holiday in
the hope of finding romance. In
the first few scenes, the writing is
poor and David Lean's direction
rather shaky, but Hepburn's per
formance is sheer magic, and it
makes the whole picture work.
Perhaps no other actress in
movies has ever been able to ex
press the desperation of lonely,
sexually frustrated women the
way Hepburn does here and in
The Rainmaker; you can see a
direct line from her brilliant
portrait of the young woman
constrained by her social milieu
in the 1935 Alice Adams to these
middle-aged women, trapped as
much by psychology as by envi
ronment. Rossano Brazzi is per
fectly cast as the married man
who courts her (though occa
sionally his dialogue defeats him
— at one point, inviting Hep
burn to have an affair with him,
he says, "You are like a hungry
child who is given ravioli to eat.
You are hungry — eat the ravioli
...").
Plays through Wednesday
with On Golden Pond.
Last Year at Marienbad
(1961)
Cubberley Auditorium
In a huge, baroque hotel,
Giorgio Albertazzi sees Del
phine Seyrig, whom he seems to
recognize. "Did we meet at
Marienbad?" he asks her; she
insists that she has never laid
eyes on him before. Nothing else
happens in this carefully crafted,
very famous puzzle picture, ex
cept that the camera tracks end
lessly up and down those thickly
carpeted corridors. Even the
writer, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and
the director, Alain Resnais,
could not agree on whether or
not the two principals had ever
met before, but of course, it isn't
supposed to matter. Marienbad
may be the most enervating film
experience one can have (a real
masochist would see it on a
double bill with Hiroshima Mon
Amour), but it has been very in
fluential — the worst mistakes of
Robert Altman, Stanley Kubrick
and Nicolas Roeg, among many
others, can be traced to it.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
Iceman (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
From the majestic opening
shots of twin choppers dancing
under an arch of swirled ice, the
Australian emigre director Fred
Schepisi uses his camera to
engage his audience; he thinks in
terms of the big screen. Iceman
tells the story of a Neanderthal
discovered frozen in ice and
revivified, who awakens to the
scrutiny of a team of doctors
who want to investigate how his
system works, how it has
survived unknown centuries —
and to the curiosity of a compas
sionate anthropologist (Timothy
Hutton), who hopes to learn
from him how man evolved.
Despite a tired, pedestrian script
by Chip Proser and John Drim
mer, the movie is thrillingly
made (and shot, by lan Baker),
and the Chinese-American actor
John Lone, as the "iceman,"
gives an immaculate perfor
mance; He makes the Neander
thal's bewilderment and sorrow,
his physical and emotional and
even spiritual hungers, piercing
ly clear. With Lindsay Crouse
(who has one good scene, with
Lone) as the head of the medical
team at the Arctic outpost.
Plays Thursday with The Man
Who Fell to Earth.
16 Candles (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The young actress Molly
Ringwald has fashioned a comic

style out of 1980s teenage cool.
She is utterly charming in this
messy, overloaded but surpris
ingly enjoyable little picture
written and directed by John
Hughes, in which she plays a girl
whose family forgets her 16th
birthday in the flurry of prepara
tions for her sister's wedding.
Hughes invents so many sub
plots that he can't possibly keep
them all spinning simultane
ously, and so sometimes you get
the impression he forgot to shoot
crucial scenes, or left them in the
editing room by accident. But he
has a talent for writing adoles
cent dialogue (the grown-ups'
lines are hopeless), and when
Molly Ringwald or Anthony Mi
chael Hall, as a high school
freshman named Ted the Geek,
is on screen, the movie sparkles.
These two get to know each
other in the automotive shop
during a school dance; they ap
pear at first like an implausible
couple of friends, but Ringwald
and Hall make their characters
so likable that by the end of the
scene their camaraderie seems
perfectly natural. With Justin
Henry as Ringwald's kid brot
her, Paul Dooley as her father,
Blanche Baker as her sister, Mi
chael Schoffling as the senior she
adores, and, as Ted's nerdy pals,
a pair of effortless charmers —
John Cusack and Darren Harris.
Plays Wednesday with
Footloose.
On Golden Pond (1981)
Festival, Palo Alto
The two central characters in
Ernest Thompson's play, filmed
by Mark Rydell, are Norman
Thayer, Jr. (Henry Fonda), a
retired professor approaching
his 80th birthday, and his wife
Ethel (Katharine Hepburn),
who is 10 years his junior. He is
ornery and foxy; she is affec
tionate and sage. The movie
takes piace at their country
cottage, where they are visited
by their daughter Chelsea (Jane
Fonda), who is stiil smarting
from a series of childhood con
flicts with her father, though of
course they are reconciled by the
end of the picture, when she
does a symbolic back flip into
the lake for him and he ap
plauds. The script is a shameless
compendium of all the heart
tugging devices that can be
crammed into two hours, but
Mark Rydell can be as slick as a
snake oil salesman, and the pres
ence of the two aging stars, as
well as the once-in-a-lifetime
casting of Henry and Jane Fonda
as father and daughter, gets
audiences cheering. Henry
Fonda, in his valedictory perfor
mance, manages to retain his
dignity throughout the picture —
no mean feat. With Dabney
Coleman as Chelsea's boy friend
and Doug McKeon as his 13-
year-old son.
Plays through Wednesday
with Summertime.
The Road Warrior (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Set in Australia in the not
too-distant future, when the fuel
shortage has triggered a war and
the survivors wander in bands
searching for gas to keep them
going. The road is more or less
owned by brutal marauders, and
in the course of the film one
"family" enlists the aid of Max
(Mel Gibson, who also played
this role in Mad Max) to defeat
their hoodlum adversaries. The
director, George Miller, is very
talented, and there are moments
of apocalyptic glory in Dean
Semmler's photography, but the
movie is mostly a long destruc
tion orgy featuring bows and ar
rows and cannon-sized flame
throwers. It's intended to be fun
ny, but you may not remember
that when you are offered such
delights as a child tossing a
boomerang into the skull of one
of the attackers. In the last third,
the picture has the nerve to turn

self-righteous, and we are asked
to hear lectures on survival and
despair from characters dressed
like medieval punk neander
thals.
Plays today with Mad Max.
The French Lieutenant's Wo
man (1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
As John Fowles' mystery wo
man, Sarah Woodruff, Meryl
Streep gives a remarkably artic
ulate performance, but her mas
tery of technique is so clearly ev
ident that it becomes the theme
of her scenes. Karel Reisz di
rected this chilly, split movie
from Harold Pinter's screenplay;
in an attempt to find a filmic
equivalent to the commentary
chapters in Fowles' novel, Pinter
has provided a modern story
about the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman, filled with
the elliptical dialogue that is his
specialty, but Reisz's heart
doesn't seem to be in these
scenes — they're flat, and after a
while they begin to seem in
trusive. The period sequences
are beautifully finished,
however, and exquisitely shot by
Freddie Francis. Reisz coaxes
admirable work from Jeremy
Irons, Patience Collier, Leo
McKern, Hilton Mcßae, Emily
Morgan, Toni Palmer and Liz
Smith.
Plays Sunday with Heat and
Dust.
Splash (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This spaikling comedy-fantasy
about a romance between a nice
young New Yorker (Tom
Hanks) and a mermaid (Daryl
Hannah) who complicates —
messes up and enriches — his
life bears some resemblance to
the 1943 musical One Touch of
Venus. The writers (Lowell
Ganz, Babaloo Mandel and
Bruce Jay Friedman, adapting a
story by producer Brian Grazer)
and the director (Ron Howard)
have given the film a completely
formed narrative shape, from its
sepia-tinted black-and-white
prologue to its Brigadoon end
ing. It has its sentimental side,
but Howard provides an unusual
tone: sweetly dazed. And watch
ing it, you become infected by it
you feel as if someone had
knocked you lightly on the head
or spun you around a little too
fast. With Eugene Levy as an
obssessed scientist and the irre
pressible John Candy as Tom
Hanks' brother; Candy is so un
reasonably hilarious that you
start laughing whenever he
shows up in anticipation of what
he's going to do.
Plays today with Victor Vic
toria.
Terms of Endearment (1983)-
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jack Nicholson dominates this
James Brooks movie by playing
against his role as Garrett
Breed!ove, a slightly seedy
astronaut. The movie, which
began life as an oddball 1975
novel by Larry McMurtry, is es
sentially a story about the deli
cate balance two strong women,
Aurora and Emma Greenway,
preserve in their mother
daughter relationship; all the
men in their lives — husbands
and lovers — are weak and
rather pathetic. (You sense that
McMurtry and Brooks think
there's something sexy about in
effectual men.) Brooks really
takes his tone from the last 50
pages of the novel, in which Em
ma learns she has cancer, and
audiences respond to his movie
because it makes them weep.
Debra Winger is terrific as Em
ma — she's zesty, in a loose, im
provisatory style — but Shirley
MacLaine, as Aurora, appears
somewhat hard and sharp and
unsympathetic; her timing is just
about perfect, but she doesn't
show a great deal of depth. The
film has a number ol i>ood se

quences, and a lovely cameo by
John Lithgow, but Brooks is not
a director yet (Oscar or no Os
car), and much of what he does
here is fairly shameless. With
Jeff Daniels as Emma's husband
Flap.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Sophie's Choice.
Sophie's Choice (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alan Pakula's movie lumbers
along for more than two and a
half hours without care to pace
or dramatic tension, but it's cer
tainly faithful to William
Styron's prestigious bestseller
(set in Brooklyn in 1947, War
saw and Auschwitz in flash
backs) — maddeningly faithful,
as if Styron were Faulkner at the
very least. Instead of paring
down Styron's overzealous nar
rative, losing the rites of passage
subplot, merging several of the
flashbacks, and devising a more
plausible treatment for Sophie's
lunatic lover Nathan (Kevin
Kline), he has taken the other
extreme: He actually overlays
blocks of Styron's prose in the
form of voice-over narration.
The only strength in the movie is
Meryl Streep's portrayal of
Sophie: She's radiant in this
movie — majestic — with real,
rooted warmth. Peter MacNicol
is stuck with the impossible role
of the author's alter ego.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Terms of Endearment.

The Man Who Fell to Karth
(1976)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Paul Mayerberg's screenplay,
derived from Walter Tevis'
novel, inverts the old story of the
visiting alien who alters the lives
of the human beings he
encounters: Tommy Newton
(David Bowie, whose
androgynous purity — his vul
nerability — somehow gives him
an erotic charge here) leaves his
wife and children behind on
their home planet, which is suf
fering from a murderous
drought, flies to earth in an ef
fort to secure water, and ends up
corrupted and finally destroyed
by earth men. This is material
for an ironic comedy, but the
director, Nichlas Roeg, treats it
without humor. However, the
dissociated world he and his
photographer. Anthony Rich

mond, create of weird, vast
landscapes and magnificent,
scary skyscrapers is different
from anything else you've seen
in a movie. Emotionally dis
tanced as it is, the film is
seductive, and there is one great
scene in which Newton sells his
ring to a desiccated old lady in a
wondrous, glittering second
hand shop where, on an ancient
recording, Louis Armstrong
sings "Blueberry Hill." With
Candy Clark, Buck Henry and
Rip Torn.
Plays Thursday with Iceman.
Victor Victoria (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In mid-1930s Paris, a gay
nightclub singer out of a job
teams up with a starv ing soprano
and turns her into a star by pass
ing her off as a female imper
sonator. It's a tantalizing idea:
One thinks of Some Like It Hot
and La Cage aux Folles and
Cabaret, and the romantic twist
— the heroine, pretending to be
her gay manager's lover, falls in
love with a straight club owner
who's being backed by Chicago
mobsters — is potentially
Shakespearean. But the role of
the soprano requires not only
crack timing but also an
androgynous sexiness, and the

star, Julie Andrews, has neither;
furthermore,.her musical num
bers, which should he jazzy and
sophistcated, are like those aw
ful scenes in '30s and '40s musi
cals in which opera stars conde
scend to perform pop. Blake Ed
wards wrote and directed, hut
his fabled slapstick gifts desert
him here, and he shows very
little sense of the period. Lucki
ly, Robert Preston plays the
homosexual, and he makes his
second-rate lines sound first
rate, as well as putting over his
numbers with vaudcvillian as
surance. With James Garner as
the club owner (he's so passive
he's practically nonexistent) and
Lesley Ann Warren as his dumb
sexpot mistress. (She may be
even more ludicrously miscast
than Julie Andrews.)
Plavs todav with Splash.
