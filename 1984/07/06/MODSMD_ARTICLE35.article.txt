Washington — The Supreme Court, concluding its
1983-N4 term yesterday, weakened a rule aimed at
deterring police misconduct by allowing evidence
seized by authorities with detective court warrants
to be used at criminal trials.
The 6-3 decision marks the first time since 1914
that the nation's highest court has narrowed the
"exclusionary rule" to permit exceptions based on
the good faith of police officers who believed they
did nothing wrong.
I lie court said that when judges or magistrates
make mistakes that violate a defendant's rights —
and police reasonably rely on those court actions —
the exclusionary rule generally should not come into
play.
Although the decision is limited to those occa
sions in which police get court warrants, its wording
could lead lower courts to apply it to situations in
which police acted in the reasonable — but wrong —
opinion that no warrant was needed.
But even in its limited form, the decision marks a
major victory tor the Reagan administration and law
enforcement agencies nationwide that for years have
blamed the exclusionary rule for letting criminals go
free on technicalities.
