# Scientists trace 6th quark

Geneva, Switzerland — Scientists at the European
Nuclear Research Center announced yesterday they
have tracked down the sixth and "missing link"
among the atomic particles known as quarks, tit
which five have been discovered.
Working under Professor Carlo Rubbia, of Har
vard University's physics department, 151 scientists
from 17 laboratories found the sixth quark —
known as the "T-quark" — which nuclear physicists
had theorized was stuck somewhere in the atomic
nucleus, made up of positively charged protons and
electrically neutral neutrons.
Now that the T-quark has been discovered and
the physicists suspecting its existence have been
vindicated, the race is on to see whether quarks are
indeed the ultimate part of matter.
