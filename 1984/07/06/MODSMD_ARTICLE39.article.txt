### 
Los Angeles — A jury yesterday found Marvin
Pancoast guilty of tirst-degree murder in the
baseball-bat slaying of model Vicki Morgan,
mistress of the late millionaire Alfred
Bloomingdale.
The 10-woman, two-man jury deliberated for 4
hours before reaching the verdict.
The jury received the case after defense attorney
Charles Mathews suggested Tuesday in closing argu
ments that Pancoast, 34, might have been hyp
notized by telephone into believing he murdered
Morgan. 31, as she slept July 7, 1983, in the apart
ment they sometimes shared.
He told jurors that author Gordon Basichis, who
is writing Morgan s life story, had more of a motive

and was fascinated by hypnotism.
However, Basichis scoffed at the notion yesterday
in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
Deputy District Attorney Stanley Weisberg, in his
final arguments Tuesday, also called the hypnotism
idea a "fantasy" and told jurors that Pancoast had
complained to Morgan's mother that Basichis was
sleeping with Morgan. Basichis declined comment
on that issue.
