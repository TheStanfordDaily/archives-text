# Toxic waste 'cure' criticized
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
A Stanford scientist may
be well on his way to solving
the Santa Clara Valley's
toxic waste problems, but a
local group may not be will
ing to see some of the neces
sary preliminary experiments
take place.
Prof, of Civil Engineering
Perry McCarty has been
working on a project to
break toxic wastes down into
harmless substances, but the
two-year-old Silicon Valley
Toxics Coalition believes
McCarty's experiments may
produce byproducts more
harmful than the wastes it is
intended to eliminate.
The toxic waste issue came
back to public attention
recently with the discovery
that 30 of 36 private drinking
water wells in Mountain
View contained high
amounts of trichloroethane
(TCE), a toxic solvent used
by Silicon Valley industries.
Following the discovery,
200 residents packed St.

Mark's Lutheran Church in
Sunnyvale Tuesday night to
demand that the Environ
mental Protection Agency
(EPA) immediately begin
the clean-up of over 120 sites
in the Bay Area.
McCarty, a consultant to
Fairchild Industries, has
been working on the prob
lem since the issue of water
contamination first came to
the public's attention in
1981. At that time, Fairchild
found itself responsible for a
huge spill in Oak Park.
Smith is concerned that
the research is still in its pre
liminary stages and not yet
ready for field tests, espe
cially since one of the inter
mediate substances produced
by the breakdowns McCarty
has studied is vinyl chloride,
a well-known carcinogen.
"My main concern is that
the proposed cure might be
worse than the illness,"
Smith said yesterday,"I
don't want anyone to go off
half-cocked on this.

"You have to realize that
the economic pressure to
pursue this must be enor
mous," he added. "I mean,
we are talking hundreds of
millions of dollars. That
makes me nervous.'"
McCarty said Smith's con
cerns are unfounded because
the vinyl chloride can be bro
ken down and eliminated.
"The evidence indicates
that this (vinyl chloride) is, in


Perry McCarty
turn. biodegradable,"
McCarty explained. "We are
not proposing that this
should go full forward in a
full-scale system until we
work it out more fully.
If and when Fairchild
makes the proposal, the main
review agency will be the
Regional Water Quality
Control Board in Oakland.
"I think it is reasonable to
study it in the field on a lim
ited scale," McCarty
repeated. "That doesn't
mean to go in to the
groundwater and con
taminate it just to study it.
"There is reason for con
cern," he said, referring to
the current problems in
Mountain View. "Vinyl
chloride is in the water now
as an intermediate substance
and is being transformed
naturally.
"1 don't want to create an

other Frankenstein mon
ster/" Smith complained.
"From what I understand,
this is not something that is
tried and proven.
"I don't want to experi
ment with the water supply
with something they 'think'
will work,* he said.
