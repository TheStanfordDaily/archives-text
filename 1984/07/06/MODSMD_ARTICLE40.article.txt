# Navy rejects faulty missile

Washington â€” The U.S. Navy has refused to ac
cept new shipments of its most sophisticated air-to
air missile because of "marginal workmanship" and
other quality-control problems at the Hughes
Aircraft Co. plant in Tucson, Ariz., Navy officials
said yesterday.
In a letter dated June 22, the Navy informed
Hughes it would no longer take delivery on AIM
54C Phoenix missiles after a Navy inspection team
dissected a missile and found "possible questionable
quality-control procedures."
A Hughes spokesman at the company's Missile
Systems Group headquarters in Canoga Park, Calif.,
declined to comment on the specific problems af
flicting the Phoenix, which one Navy officer said in
clude faulty welding, flaws in the electronics wiring
and tolerances in the machined parts that exceed
specifications.
At $950,000 apiece, the AIM-54C eventually will
be deployed on the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter
planes, which are flown from aircraft carriers.
Although the first of the AIM-54Cs was delivered
in October 1981, none has been deployed to the
lleet because the Navy is still evaluating the missile's
performance. Secretary of the Navy John Lehman
Jr. had been scheduled to decide later this year whe
ther to authorize full production of the Phoenix at a
rate of 567 missiles per year.
