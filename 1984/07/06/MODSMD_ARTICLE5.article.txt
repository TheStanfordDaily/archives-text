### R. TAEZA PIERCE 
The majority of the proceeds
from tonight's premiere of
director Robert Altman's new
film will go to Stanford Students
Anainst Reaganism (STAR
PAC).
Altman will attend the N p.m.
premiere of "Secret Honor" at
the Cannery Theater in San
Francisco, STAR-PAC member
Kent Walker said.
Through his pre-19K4 Demo
cratic Convention activities,
Walker learned Altman was
"looking for something to at
tract pre-convention publicity
and the attention of national
press in town for the conven
tion." Walker then called
Altman by telephone and inter
ested the director in helping the
newly formed organization.
Five first-year law students
formed STAR-PAC this spring
to "oppose the public policies of
President Reagan and right
wing ideologues throughout the
nation." (See April 6 Daily)
STAR-PAC's leaders are

looking forward to tonight's
premiere as a means to gain
publicity and to raise needed
lunds. "STAR-PAC will chan
nel the money," Walker said,
"into (campaign) contributions
tor *84 election candidates who
share its commitment to pro
gressive policies."
According to Walker, Altman
agreed to collaborate with
STAR-PAC "because of his in
terest in the student response to
'Secret Honor.' "
Altman co-produced the film
with the Los Angeles Actors'
Theater and the University ol
Michigan's Communication De
partment, where he is a visiting
professor. Students helped
produce the film, write the
score, and adapt the screenplay.
Adapted from last year's
Broadway play of the same
name, "Secret Honor" is a fic
tional account of the decline of
Richard Nixon. Philip Baker
Hall stars as Nixon in the movie.
