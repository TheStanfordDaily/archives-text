### 
Islamabad. Pakistan (AP) —
Sikh hijackers forced an Indian
Airlines plane to Lahore, Pakis
tan, yesterday and threatened to
blow it up with 264 people
aboard it their demands were
not met, a government spokes
man said.
The Sikhs, who seized the
aircraft on a domestic flight
from Srinagar, capital of Kash
mir, to New Delhi, demanded
the immediate release of all
Sikhs arrested during recent
agitations by that sect in India's
Punjab state.
Mohammad Sharif, deputy
information officer for the mili
tary government in Pakistan,
said the hijackers set a deadline
of 2 p.m. yesterday and would
not extend it.
But a Pakistani source in con
tact with Lahore airport said
negotiations with the hijackers
broke down several hours
before the deadline, and it
passed without incident.
"They suspended the negotia
tions at 10 a.m.," said a local

journalist. "They said they had
given a deadline and there was
nothing more to discuss."
The plane remained under
heavy guard at Lahore Airport,
ISO miles east ot Islamabad.
Sharif said his government had
no word on the hostages on the
plane, and was waiting word
from New Delhi on how to
proceed.
Pakistani officials said 15N
men, X 2 women and 15 children
passengers plus a nine-member
crew were aboard. They could
not say if there were any foreig
ners aboard the plane, despite
reports that the flight manifest
in New Delhi listed 30 non-
Indian names, some of whom
were believed to be British.
Sharif said there were four
hijackers. Earlier, the United
News of India said nine mem
bers of the banned All-India
Sikh Students Federation had
seized the Airbus A-300. The
Indian government has accused
the federation of plotting seces
sion and setting up guerrilla

training camps in Kashmir.
The hijackers also demanded
that India: announce over radio
and television the names of all
those arrested in the Sikh crack
down; release Harmandar Singh
Sandho, general secretary of the
All-India Sikh Students Federa
tion, and 29 other prominent
members; convert into U.S. dol
lars the approximately $25 mil
lion in money and treasure
Sikhs say was looted by Indian
troops during the Amritsar op
eration last month, and send the
money to Pakistan.
Last month, Indian army
troops attacked the Golden
Temple in Amritsar, the Sikhs'
holiest shrine, which India said
was a haven for Sikh terrorists.
The official death toll listed 492
Sikhs and 92 government sol
diers, but military and police of
ficials put it at more than 1,200.
Indian Ambassador K.D.
Sharma was said to be in Lahore
to negotiate with the hijackers.
"My first priority is the safety of
the passengers," said Sharma.
