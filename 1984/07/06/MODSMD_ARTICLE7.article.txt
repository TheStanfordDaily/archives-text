# Jackson vows to visit Soviets

Greenville, S.C. â€” Jesse
Jackson vowed yesterday to
make a "moral crusade" to the
Soviet Union this fall despite
President Reagan's suggestion
that the trip may be illegal.
"If our government will not
interfere with my passport and
the Soviet Union will not stop
me, I expect to be making a
peace mission to the Soviet
Union," Jackson said.
Jackson says he will seek the
release of Soviet dissidents
Andrei Sakharov and his wife,
Yelena Bonner.
While touring an automobile
plant yesterday, Reagan was
asked whether Jackson would
cause a problem for the govern
ment if he went to Russia.
He replied, "I don't know.
I'm sure the State Department
will be working things out."
Reagan on Wednesday called
Jackson's efforts to gain the
release of 58 prisoners from
Cuban jails "successful," but
said "there were things to make
you pause and think."
He indicated that Jackson

may have violated the Logan
Act, a 1799 law that prohibits
U.S. citizens from negotiating
with a foreign power without
the consent of the State Depart
ment. No one has been
prosecuted under the act.
Jackson denied Wednesday
that he engaged in any unlawful
negotiations in Central America
and Cuba and said he had acted
with the cooperation of the
State Department. A State De
partment spokesman had said
earlier that Jackson had not vio
lated the Logan Act.
Jackson's proposed venture
to free Sakharov and Bonner,
Reagan said in an interview
Wednesday, "ignores things
that might be going on in the
quiet diplomatic channels that
we have going forward."
However, the State Depart
ment "would not stand in the
way" of Jackson traveling to the
Soviet Union, a State Depart
ment spokesman said Thursday.
