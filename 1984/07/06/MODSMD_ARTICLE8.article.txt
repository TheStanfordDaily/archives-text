### 
Washington — In unusually
strong language, the State De
partment yesterday condemned
as "reprehensible and totally
uncalled lor" the detention ol
two U.S. diplomats in Moscow.
" It's part ol an increasing
drive on the part of Soviet auth
orities to isolate their people
Ironi loreiiin contacts and to

repress legitimate expression of
differing political and social
views — except under condi
tions which are under the com
plete control of the Soviet auth
orities," department spokesman
John I lughes said.
Hughes said he did not know
the nature of the documents
Moscow police seized from U.S.

Embassy political officer Jon
Purnell and consular officer
George Glass, who were ar
rested Wednesday as they
talked on a street with a Soviet
citizen who handed them a sheaf
of papers.
I le added, "Soviet conduct in
this case Ikis been reprehensible

and totally uncalled for, and we
condemn it."
But in both a prepared state
ment and in later comments,
Hughes emphasized that the
Americans had not committed
any breach of conduct but were
engaged in "their normal
diplomatic and consular duties."

Their detention, he said, was
a violation of the Vienna Con
vention on Diplomatic Rela
tions, which forbids the arrest of
envoys. Soviet refusal to let
Purnell and Glass contact the
U.S. Embassy after their arrest
compounded the offense.
