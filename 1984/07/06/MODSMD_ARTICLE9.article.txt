# Scientists find gaseous arc in center of galaxy

Washington (AF) —
California and New York
astronomers announced yester
day that they have discovered a
giant arc of hot gases near the
center of our Milky Way galaxy
that is unlike anything previ
ously seen.
Researchers from UCLA and
New York's Columbia Univer
sity said the arc is billions of
times larger than the sun and
resembles a huge solar flare
leaping out into space.
The arc, which rises straight
up from the flat plane in which
the galaxy and our solar system
lie before turning at a 90-degree
angle, is more than 150 light
years long, said the
astronomers.
"It resembles a large solar
flare in appearance, but the
scale is billions of times larger,"
said Dr. Mark Morris, an associ
ate professor of astronomy at
UCLA.
A light year is the distance
light travels in a year at 186,000
miles per second — about six
trillion miles. The Milky Way is
a flat spiral of billions of stars
that is 100,000 light years across
and between 1,000 and 2,000
light years thick.
Pictures of the structure
produced from observations

with radio telescopes show that
it is composed of many narrow,
filament-like features that are
each a few light years wide.
Morris, with Farhad Yusef
/adeh and Don Chance of Co
lumbia, discovered the structure
in observations made with the
Very Large Array telescope as
sembly located in New Mexico.
The array, which is sponsored
by the National Science Foun
dation. is a Y-shaped network
of 27 movable radio telescopes,
located miles apart, that work in
unison.
Morris said in a telephone in
terview that no one knows how
the arc is produced, but it could
result from a warping of the
magnetic lines generated by the
rotation of the galaxy.
While the galaxy's magnetic
field is thought to lie in its flat
plane, he said, the new structure
indicates there also may be a
substantial "north-south" or
vertical magnetic field with
poles much like those of the
Earth, the sun and other stars.
"The evidence now available,
especially the detailed shape of
the structure, implies that the
arc of hot ionized gas is con
trolled by a magnetic field,"
Morris said.
