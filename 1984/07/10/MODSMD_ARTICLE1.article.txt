# Lab technician reports toxic acid dumping

### BILL MARTIN KRISHNA WEST 
Stanford's Integrated Circuit Labora
tories has been pouring gallons of highly
toxic acids down the drain and into Palo
Alto's sewer system, but city officials
have yet to find any trace of the acid in
the main sewer lines.
Tests indicate that the sewage's pH
level is actually greater than seven,
meaning the waste is not acid at all, said
Robert Beth, director of risk manage
ment for Stanford.
But Beth acknowledged that although
the practice of pouring the acids down
the drain does not pose any health or
safety hazard on a small scale, it is not
permitted by law.
John Burke, facilities coordinator for
the Stanford Electronic Laboratories,
said the laboratory administrators were
not aware that they were doing anything
illegal. The disposed acid, he said, was
mixed with "copious amounts" of water
and was thoroughly diluted to safe levels
before being poured down the drain, in
compliance with lab policy.
A frenzy of activity begun in the
McCullough Building Sunday after the
Peninsula Times Tribune reported lab
technician Robert Schmidt's allegations
about the acid dumpings. Schmidt said
he contacted the newspaper as a last
resort in an effort to "bring the problem
to light."

"This is just one of many types of inci
dents," Schmidt told the Daily yesterday.
"I became concerned when I got gassed a
while back and they didn't listen to my
concerns." Schmidt breathed disabling
amounts of toxic gas twice while working
on normal lab projects.
"Once, after I opened a pH tank," he
recalled, "the other technicians in the lab
told me that the gauges were not correct.
By opening the tank, 1 could have caused
it to burst and it would have killed every
one in the lab."
In addition, Schmidt and his col
leagues told Prof, of Electrical Engineer
ing James Piummer and Research Asso
ciate John Shott yesterday that masks
were not being worn when technicians
handled highly toxic arsenic.
Piummer and Shott met with the labo
ratory staff several times yesterday to
outline stop-gap procedures in order to
"please the public."
"What we have is a PR problem," ex
plained Piummer to a group of tech
nicians attending the afternoon meeting.
"We do not know yet whether we have
violated any ordinances. In fact, it ap
pears we haven't. However, the lab must
stop dumping from a PR point of view."
Shott outlined a new procedure for
handling acid wastes in which no acid
would be disposed of down drains.
Rather, the labs would use the Univer
sity Department of Health and Safety's

free pick-up service for disposal of the
wastes.
Schmidt, in the meantime, is taking a
lot of heat for his actions. "Generally,
the engineers here are pissed off at me,"
he said. "I'm sure they'd love it if I quit "
right now.

'"They are saying that they never vio
lated the law in the first plaee and that
they are taking all of these extra
measures for the public's concern.
"You know it's worse than that if they
