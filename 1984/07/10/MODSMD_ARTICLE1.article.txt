# Lab technician reports toxic acid dumping
## 
### BILL MARTIN KRISHNA WEST 
Stanford's Integrated Circuit Labora
tories has been pouring gallons of highly
toxic acids down the drain and into Palo
Alto's sewer system, but city officials
have yet to find any trace of the acid in
the main sewer lines.
Tests indicate that the sewage's pH
level is actually greater than seven,
meaning the waste is not acid at all, said
Robert Beth, director of risk manage
ment for Stanford.
But Beth acknowledged that although
the practice of pouring the acids down
the drain does not pose any health or
safety hazard on a small scale, it is not
permitted by law.
John Burke, facilities coordinator for
the Stanford Electronic Laboratories,
said the laboratory administrators were
not aware that they were doing anything
illegal. The disposed acid, he said, was
mixed with "copious amounts" of water
and was thoroughly diluted to safe levels
before being poured down the drain, in
compliance with lab policy.
A frenzy of activity begun in the
McCullough Building Sunday after the
Peninsula Times Tribune reported lab
technician Robert Schmidt's allegations
about the acid dumpings. Schmidt said
he contacted the newspaper as a last
resort in an effort to "bring the problem
to light."

"This is just one of many types of inci
dents," Schmidt told the Daily yesterday.
"I became concerned when I got gassed a
while back and they didn't listen to my
concerns." Schmidt breathed disabling
amounts of toxic gas twice while working
on normal lab projects.
"Once, after I opened a pH tank," he
recalled, "the other technicians in the lab
told me that the gauges were not correct.
By opening the tank, 1 could have caused
it to burst and it would have killed every
one in the lab."
In addition, Schmidt and his col
leagues told Prof, of Electrical Engineer
ing James Piummer and Research Asso
ciate John Shott yesterday that masks
were not being worn when technicians
handled highly toxic arsenic.
Piummer and Shott met with the labo
ratory staff several times yesterday to
outline stop-gap procedures in order to
"please the public."
"What we have is a PR problem," ex
plained Piummer to a group of tech
nicians attending the afternoon meeting.
"We do not know yet whether we have
violated any ordinances. In fact, it ap
pears we haven't. However, the lab must
stop dumping from a PR point of view."
Shott outlined a new procedure for
handling acid wastes in which no acid
would be disposed of down drains.
Rather, the labs would use the Univer
sity Department of Health and Safety's

free pick-up service for disposal of the
wastes.
Schmidt, in the meantime, is taking a
lot of heat for his actions. "Generally,
the engineers here are pissed off at me,"
he said. "I'm sure they'd love it if I quit "
right now.

'"They are saying that they never vio
lated the law in the first plaee and that
they are taking all of these extra
measures for the public's concern.
"You know it's worse than that if they

are going this far. They're scared of
something."'
Schmidt has already asked for a trans
fer to another building.
The staff of the lab reacted reluctantly
to the new guidelines which will be en
forced by Robert de Mattei of the
McCullough Building Safety Committee,
who insisted that "nothing that is not
water will be poured down those drains,"
despite complaints that the department is
overreacting to unfavorable publicity
caused by the Peninsula Times Tribune
article.
According to Plummer, Schmidt was
referring to the hydroflouride and nitric
acid used to clean five-foot quartz tubes
used in cleaning stations.
The acid problem at McCullough has

been around for a long time, according to
Plummer. The original steel tubing in the
building had to be replaced with plastic
when the acid dissolved the steel pipes.
In addition, pH gauges were installed in
the sump pumps, although they currently
are not working.
Schmidt said the Health and Safety de
partment told him numerous times that
facilities manager Jacques Beaudouin
had insisted that no acid was being
poured into the drains. This shocked
Schmidt and complaints were made fre
quently in staff meetings and personal
meetings with Research Associate Jim
McVittie, his former supervisor. Finally,
on Thursday, he approached Times
Tribune reporter Ann Gibbons with the
story as a last resort.
The lab was shut down completely yes
terday and probably will not reopen until
Wednesday, when new procedures for
handling acids will be put into effect.

Until problems can be solved at
McCullough, acids will not be drained by
pouring them in to the sink, and only
Plummer and Shott will be allowed to
handle the most dangerous fluids, includ
ing hydroflouride.
"Our only problem is if Palo Alto or
the EPA find we've been violating some
ordinance we haven't looked into." ex
plained Plummer. "We do not want to
shut down the lab entirely — there are
too many people who use it: Ph.D. stu
dents, grad students and classes ..."
University Vice President for Business
and Finance William Massy said Presi
dent Donald Kennedy is very concerned
about the problem, although he is away
from the University at present. Director
of Health and Safety Alain Decleve will
work with health and safety specialists
George Seto and Barbara Cohrssen to
investigate the matter and present a
report next week.

plained Plummer. "We do not want to
shut down the lab entirely — there are
too many people who use it: Ph.D. stu
dents, grad students and classes ..."
University Vice President for Business
and Finance William Massy said Presi
dent Donald Kennedy is very concerned
about the problem, although he is away
from the University at present. Director

Stanford's Integrated Circuit Labora
tories has been pouring gallons of highly
toxic acids down the drain and into Palo
Alto's sewer system, but city officials
have yet to find any trace of the acid in
the main sewer lines.
Tests indicate that the sewage's pH
level is actually greater than seven,
meaning the waste is not acid at all, said
Robert Beth, director of risk manage
ment for Stanford.
But Beth acknowledged that although
the practice of pouring the acids down
the drain does not pose any health or
safety hazard on a small scale, it is not
permitted by law.
John Burke, facilities coordinator for
the Stanford Electronic Laboratories,
said the laboratory administrators were
not aware that they were doing anything
illegal. The disposed acid, he said, was
mixed with "copious amounts" of water
and was thoroughly diluted to safe levels
before being poured down the drain, in
compliance with lab policy.
A frenzy of activity begun in the
McCullough Building Sunday after the
Peninsula Times Tribune reported lab
technician Robert Schmidt's allegations
about the acid dumpings. Schmidt said
he contacted the newspaper as a last
resort in an effort to "bring the problem
to light."

"This is just one of many types of inci
dents," Schmidt told the Daily yesterday.
"I became concerned when I got gassed a
while back and they didn't listen to my
concerns." Schmidt breathed disabling
amounts of toxic gas twice while working
on normal lab projects.
"Once, after I opened a pH tank," he
recalled, "the other technicians in the lab
told me that the gauges were not correct.
By opening the tank, 1 could have caused
it to burst and it would have killed every
one in the lab."
In addition, Schmidt and his col
leagues told Prof, of Electrical Engineer
ing James Piummer and Research Asso
ciate John Shott yesterday that masks
were not being worn when technicians
handled highly toxic arsenic.
Piummer and Shott met with the labo
ratory staff several times yesterday to
outline stop-gap procedures in order to
"please the public."
"What we have is a PR problem," ex
plained Piummer to a group of tech
nicians attending the afternoon meeting.
"We do not know yet whether we have
violated any ordinances. In fact, it ap
pears we haven't. However, the lab must
stop dumping from a PR point of view."
Shott outlined a new procedure for
handling acid wastes in which no acid
would be disposed of down drains.
Rather, the labs would use the Univer
sity Department of Health and Safety's

free pick-up service for disposal of the
wastes.
Schmidt, in the meantime, is taking a
lot of heat for his actions. "Generally,
the engineers here are pissed off at me,"
he said. "I'm sure they'd love it if I quit "
right now.

'"They are saying that they never vio
lated the law in the first plaee and that
they are taking all of these extra
measures for the public's concern.
"You know it's worse than that if they

New signs bar acid disposal at the Integrated Circuits Laboratories.

are going this far. They're scared of
something."'
Schmidt has already asked for a trans
fer to another building.
The staff of the lab reacted reluctantly
to the new guidelines which will be en
forced by Robert de Mattei of the
McCullough Building Safety Committee,
who insisted that "nothing that is not
water will be poured down those drains,"
despite complaints that the department is
overreacting to unfavorable publicity
caused by the Peninsula Times Tribune
article.
According to Plummer, Schmidt was
referring to the hydroflouride and nitric
acid used to clean five-foot quartz tubes
used in cleaning stations.
The acid problem at McCullough has

been around for a long time, according to
Plummer. The original steel tubing in the
building had to be replaced with plastic
when the acid dissolved the steel pipes.
In addition, pH gauges were installed in
the sump pumps, although they currently
are not working.
Schmidt said the Health and Safety de
partment told him numerous times that
facilities manager Jacques Beaudouin
had insisted that no acid was being
poured into the drains. This shocked
Schmidt and complaints were made fre
quently in staff meetings and personal
meetings with Research Associate Jim
McVittie, his former supervisor. Finally,
on Thursday, he approached Times
Tribune reporter Ann Gibbons with the
story as a last resort.
The lab was shut down completely yes
terday and probably will not reopen until
Wednesday, when new procedures for
handling acids will be put into effect.

Until problems can be solved at
McCullough, acids will not be drained by
pouring them in to the sink, and only
Plummer and Shott will be allowed to
handle the most dangerous fluids, includ
ing hydroflouride.
"Our only problem is if Palo Alto or
the EPA find we've been violating some
ordinance we haven't looked into." ex
plained Plummer. "We do not want to
shut down the lab entirely — there are
too many people who use it: Ph.D. stu
dents, grad students and classes ..."
