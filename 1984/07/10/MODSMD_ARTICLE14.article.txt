## Rep. Lantos calls for US-Soviet summit 
### THOMAS O. MOORE 
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-
Hillsborough) of the 11th con
gressional district brought his
campaign home last weekend,
calling for an annual series of
summit meetings between the
U.S. president and Soviet
leaders.
Lantos spoke at town
meetings in both Redwood City
and Daly City Saturday.
Concerning international af
fairs, Lantos, who is a member
of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, stressed the need
for rapprochement with the So
viet Union. He described his
trip with President Reagan to
Normandy, France, last month
for the 40th anniversary of D-
Day, and reflected on his expe

riences fighting in World War
II.
Lantos, a Hungarian Jewish
immigrant, spent the war years
fighting in the underground
against the Nazis. He cited the
link-up of Soviet and American
forces in a small German town
on the Elbe River which
signaled the end of the war in
Europe, and, in remembrance
of that event, proposed an an
nual Elbe summit meeting with
the Soviets.
He has introduced a resolu
tion which would call for the
U.S. president and the Soviet
leader to meet in Elbe in the
spring of 1985, and annually
thereafter, for the primary pur
pose of dispelling the tension
and mistrust separating the two

nations. Lantos asked his con
stituents to write to Senators
Cranston and Wilson to urge
them to support the resolution.
Lantos, who with 57 percent
of the vote defeated Republican

opponent Bill Royer in 1982,
was first elected in 1980. The
11th congressional district en
compasses most of the Penin
sula south of San Francisco, in
cluding much of Menlo Park hut
excluding Palo Alto.
The congressman covered a
variety of issues at the district
meetings, including his efforts to
add new sections of coastline to
the Golden Gate National
Recreational Area (GGNRA).
He predicted that the struggle
would be difficult, but recalled
the successful inclusion of
Sweeney Ridge into the
GGNRA after much per
severance.
Lantos warned that efforts to
close the budget deficit may
lead to dangerous cuts in

Medicare and social security
programs, but he vowed to
defend these programs budgets
during the huge congressional
battle he foresees in January
1985. He also urged voters to
strike down the Jarvis initiative,
because its passage will cause
major cuts in municipal budgets
for Peninsula cities.
Not all of those present at the
meeting professed complete
satisfaction with Lantos' perfor
mance in office, and some
voiced their discontent over the
lack of communication between
the district and its representa
tive in Washington. But Lantos
managed to maintain a smile
and an air of confidence which,
perhaps, will carry him into an
other term.
