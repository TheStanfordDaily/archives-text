# Democratic delegate says Hart still fighting
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
It looks like the Democrats are gearing
up for floor tight at their national con
vention next week, and at least one local
delegate, Stacy Sher. will play a key role
in the outcome.
Sher, an operations manager and assis
tant librarian at the art library, was
elected from the 1 1th Congressional Dis
trict to support Sen. Gary Hart at the
Democratic National Convention which
begins next Monday in San Francisco.
The district, which includes Menlo
Park and cities just north of Stanford,
gave Hart strong support in the June 5
primary. Sher was a volunteer worker in
the Hart campaign.
According to Sher, the California
delegation to the convention met three
weeks ago to outline convention plans.
She said \ lart is still tightmg, tor the nom
/ nut ion.

"The Northern California Hart
delegation will be meeting again this
week. We should find out the national
plans then."
For now, Sher's job is defined as a
floor whip, one of 400 working for the
Hart campaign and crucial to the success
of Hart's challenge.
"We pretty much run around and in
form the delegates about what (Hart's)
stands are and we'll be working on dele
gate persuasion. We generally have to
keep track of what's happening on the
floor."
Sher said she still hopes Hart will win,
even though most media reports say
Mondale has the nomination locked up.
But she also said she realizes that
Mondale will probably be the victor. In
that ease, she said, " I'll probably still
work on the campaign, though not as
much. It takes lots of time. If 1 do get in

volved, it'll probably be with the Sierra
Club.'"
Sher avoided predicting who Mondale
will select for his running mate, but she
discounted speculation that Mondale's
choice might be rejected by the
delegates. "If Mondale wins, he will
nominate the person," she said.
"Whoever it is, the person is always ap
proved (by the delegates)."
She said Hart would accept the vice
presidential nomination if Mondale of
fers it to him.
"I'm sure (he) will go for it," she said.
"I hope so. It's going to be really difficult
to beat Reagan and that is one of our
prime motivating forces. We're anti-
Reagan, not anti-Mondale," she added.
For Sher, this convention will be the
end of a long and tough nine months of
working on the Hart campaign.
"Tve been working on the Hart cam
paign since November. There were only

two people then, but we've gained a lot
of help since then."
This help, she is sure, will continue
through November. Next week, the Hart
forces will challenge some of the
Mondale delegates' credentials. This
could be effective, she said, because the
California election wasn't a firm
mandate for any candidate.
To her, the final delegate count "was
not very representative. There were
some split votes." This may have hurt
Hart in California.
She said Hart's slim hopes for captur
ing the nomination rest on replacing the
delegates he believes were improperly
elected and on winning the support of
the hundreds ot delegates who are un
committed or are pledged to Mondale,
but whose support for the former vice
president is believed to be "soft."
