# Researchers show new uses for monoclonal antibodies
## 
### DAN BLUMBERG 
Last week, Stanford Medical Center research
ers Dr. Nelson Teng and Dr. Jefferey Sklar an
nounced the development of two potentially
lifesaving uses of monoclonal antibody cells —
cells which attack a single foreign protein in the
bloodstream.
Teng, assistant professor of gynecology and
obstetrics, announced that his research group has
created a monoclonal cell which produces an an
tibody that could protect Rh-positive fetuses from
their mothers' immune systems. "The antibody
developed by our research group may lead to a
simpler and safer method of protecting the fetus
of an Rh-negative mother." Teng said.
According to Teng, an Rh-negative female par
ent and an Rh-positive male parent can often
produce an Rh-positive fetus whose red blood
cells are incompatible with its mother's and could
potentially be destroyed by the mother's immune
system.
During an Rh-negative woman's first preg
nancy, an Rh-positive baby is usually safe because
its mother's immune system has not yet been sen
sitized to Rh-positive blood. But when the baby is
delivered, some of its Rh-positive cells, foreign to
the mother's immune system, cause her to
generate anti-Rh antibodies.
Teng explained that in subsequent pregnancies
with Rh-positive babies, the mother's anti-Rh an
tibodies can move across the placenta into the fe
tal circulation, destroying the baby's red blood
cells. This may result in jaundice, developmental
problems, mental retardation and even the death
of the infant.
To prevent this from happening, the mother is
injected with serum containing anti-Rh antibodies
shortly after delivery of her first child. These an
tibodies destroy the foreign red blood cells before
the mother's immune system can build defenses
against them.
Although the anti-Rh serum is effective, it is
becoming increasingly scarce. Teng said, "Our
monoclonal procedure which produces the anti-
Rh antibody can potentially become widely
available to circumvent scarcity problems with the
currcnt method. And it may also prevent potential
contamination problems inherent in the present

approach. Clinical trials with the monoclonal an
tibody in humans are planned for the near
future."
The procedure for producing antibodies from
monoclonal cells generally requires the fusion of a
cell that produces the desired antibody with a
tumor cell. The resulting cell replicates rapidly, al
lowing quicker production of the antibody than
would be available from a slower-replicating non
tumor cell.
Colleagues of Teng who contributed to his re
search are postdoctoral scholar Dominique Bron
from Belgium, medical student Mark Feinberg,
and the late Henry Kaplan, who was a world
renowned Stanford cancer specialist.
Another use of monoclonal techniques is devel
oping antibodies that are specific to certain can
cers. Current chemotherapy techniques often
destroy normal cells in the process of killing can
cer cells. Therefore, a major goal of cancer re
searchers is the development of agents such as an
tibodies specific to only the cancer cells enabling
the normal cells to remain unharmed.
Assistant Prof of Pathology Jefferey Sklar is in
vestigating this approach to cancer therapy. In
doing this, his research group has determined that
certain patients with B-cell lymphoma, a can
cerous growth of the immune system's antibody
producing cells, have two cancer cell types instead
of one as expected.
Sklar said, "This is a surprising discovery be
cause this questions the longstanding assumption
that all cells in a tumor are genetically identical.
Therefore the selection of drugs and use of an
tibodies is likely to be more complex than previ
ously thought.
"At the present time, new strategies for the ap
plication of monoclonal antibodies appear to be
possible to circumvent the difficulties suggested
by these studies."
Sklar's research was reported in the July 5 issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine by
postdoctoral scholars Dr. Michael Cleary and Dr.
Kristiaan Thielemans, research assistant Julie
Graloq, associate professor of pathology Dr.
Roger Warnke, Dr. Ronald Levy, associate pro
fessor of medicine, and Sklar.
