## Stanford organ a tribute to designer 
### DAN CORAN 
When Charles Fisk first
visited Stanford's Memorial
Church in 1950, he was a Ph.D.
student in electronics and nu
clear physics. But after hearing
Herbert Nanney play the organ,
everything changed. Enrolling
as a student under Nanney, Fisk
became an organist, and then an
organ designer, whose career
ended with his death in Dec.
1983.
The legacy of Charles Fisk —
the recently installed Fisk Or
gan in Memorial Church — is a
triumph of design and
craftsmanship. Moreover, it is
the only one of its kind; accor
ding to Herbert Nanney, who is
still head organist here, "this or
gan is the first instrument in the
history of organ-building that is
capable of reproducing nearly
all organ music written from the
16th through the 18th centuries
with the proper sounds."
For nearly 30 years, the Uni
versity's dream has been to con
struct such an organ, capable of
authentically reproducing the
sound of baroque music, and
have this instrument stand side
by side with the existing Murray
Harris organ with its beautiful
romantic sound of the 19th and
20th centuries. Taken together,
they give organists at Memorial
Church the opportunity to play
from a broad historical range of
organ music with the proper his
torical sound.
Serious efforts to construct
the new organ began in 1973
when the late Evelyn Almack

Turrentine left a gift of
$400,000 in her will to be used
toward constructing the new in
strument. After the first pro
posed site in one of the church's
transept galleries had been
abandoned due to aesthetic and
acoustical problems, the choir
loft was chosen as the organ's
optimal location. Architects
soon found, however, that the
loft would not support the addi
tional weight of the organ and
that reinforcement work was
necessary.
In 19X1, the half-million dol
lar donation of the late George
Morell, as well as contributions
by Jacques Littlefield and Wal
ter Hewlett, allowed the project
to move toward completion.
Reinforcement work and instal
lation were completed in
December of 1983.
The cost of the organ itself
was $657,000, and all together
the project cost was over $ 1 mil
lion.
The laborious task of voicing
and tuning the organ to fit the
particular acoustics of Memorial
Church stretched over five
months, beginning in January of
this year. The organ sits in the
center of the choir loft, with
several choir benches in front of
it, and matches its 4422 pipes
with the 3600 of the old organ
which occupies both sides of the
loft.
As Nanney points out, the
unique characteristic of the new
organ is its ability to switch from
two distinctly different types of
tuning for baroque organ music

at the pull of a lever.
"Meantone" tuning, common
throughout the 16th and late
17th centuries, can be replaced
by the "well-tempered" tuning
favored by Bach and popular
from the late 17th to the early
18th centuries. This switch is
made possible by having five ex
tra pipes (two for each "black"
key) in each octave.
Like the true baroque organ,
the new Fisk organ utilizes me
chanical action valves, pipes
which speak directly into the
room, bright and high upper
work, and short, straight and
flat pedal board. Its designers —
C harles Hsk, Harold Vogel and
Manuel Rosales — with some
assistance by Herbert Nanney,
were carelul to incorporate ele
ments ot historic East German,
North German and French or
gans into its design.
The new organ was a triumph
tor Fisk, its chief designer and
constructor, who died unex
pectedly last winter, shortly
before construction was com
pleted.
Alter serving an apprentice
ship under John Swinford, the
person who maintained the or
gan in Memorial Church, Fisk
studied organ building at the
Holt Kamp Company in
Cleveland. In 1955 he became a
partner in an organ rebuilding
company in Massachusetts and
within three years became its
sole owner. In 1961, the com
pany became C.B. Fisk, Inc. and
moved to Gloucester, Mass.

Performances on the new or
gan are scheduled throughout
the year. Guest organists such as
Robert Noehren, David Craig
head and Katherine Crozier will
be giving performances in the
coming months.
As University organist, Her
bert Nanney will play every
Sunday tor the 11 a.m. service.
He intends to hold several or

ganist workshops using the new
instrument.
Students enrolled in inter
mediate or advanced organ will
have regular access to The Fisk
organ. Several of the doctoral
students are already scheduled
to hold public recitals which ap
pear on the concert calendars
mentioned above.

when the late Evelyn Almack

Turrentine left a gift of
$400,000 in her will to be used
toward constructing the new in
strument. After the first pro
posed site in one of the church's
transept galleries had been
abandoned due to aesthetic and
acoustical problems, the choir
loft was chosen as the organ's
optimal location. Architects
soon found, however, that the
loft would not support the addi
tional weight of the organ and
that reinforcement work was
necessary.
In 19X1, the half-million dol
lar donation of the late George
Morell, as well as contributions
by Jacques Littlefield and Wal
ter Hewlett, allowed the project
to move toward completion.
Reinforcement work and instal
lation were completed in
December of 1983.
The cost of the organ itself
was $657,000, and all together
the project cost was over $ 1 mil
lion.
The laborious task of voicing
and tuning the organ to fit the
particular acoustics of Memorial
Church stretched over five
months, beginning in January of
this year. The organ sits in the
center of the choir loft, with
several choir benches in front of
it, and matches its 4422 pipes
with the 3600 of the old organ
which occupies both sides of the
loft.
As Nanney points out, the
unique characteristic of the new
organ is its ability to switch from
two distinctly different types of
tuning for baroque organ music

at the pull of a lever.
"Meantone" tuning, common
throughout the 16th and late
17th centuries, can be replaced
by the "well-tempered" tuning
favored by Bach and popular
from the late 17th to the early
18th centuries. This switch is
made possible by having five ex
tra pipes (two for each "black"
key) in each octave.
Like the true baroque organ,
the new Fisk organ utilizes me
chanical action valves, pipes
which speak directly into the
room, bright and high upper
work, and short, straight and
flat pedal board. Its designers —
C harles Hsk, Harold Vogel and
Manuel Rosales — with some
assistance by Herbert Nanney,
were carelul to incorporate ele
ments ot historic East German,
North German and French or
gans into its design.
The new organ was a triumph
tor Fisk, its chief designer and
constructor, who died unex
pectedly last winter, shortly
before construction was com
pleted.
Alter serving an apprentice
ship under John Swinford, the
person who maintained the or
gan in Memorial Church, Fisk
studied organ building at the
Holt Kamp Company in
Cleveland. In 1955 he became a
partner in an organ rebuilding
company in Massachusetts and
within three years became its
sole owner. In 1961, the com
pany became C.B. Fisk, Inc. and
moved to Gloucester, Mass.

Performances on the new or
gan are scheduled throughout
the year. Guest organists such as
Robert Noehren, David Craig
head and Katherine Crozier will
be giving performances in the
coming months.
As University organist, Her
bert Nanney will play every
Sunday tor the 11 a.m. service.
He intends to hold several or

ganist workshops using the new
instrument.
Students enrolled in inter
mediate or advanced organ will
have regular access to The Fisk
organ. Several of the doctoral
students are already scheduled
to hold public recitals which ap
pear on the concert calendars
mentioned above.
