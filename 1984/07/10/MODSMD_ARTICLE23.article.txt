## All-Star Game workouts cap day at Candlestick 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
San Francisco — The Bay
Area prepared for tonight's
Major League All-Star Game
with a day of baseball at
Candlestick Park yesterday
featuring the official workouts
of both all-star teams.
Prior to the workouts, fans
saw the United States Olympic
Team down the Japanese col
legiate all-stars,, N-0. and wit
nessed an exhibition softball
game featuring stars of the now
famous Miller Lite Beer com
mercials and local radio
broadcasters.
The U.S. Olympians got the
show off to an early start,
scoring seven runs in the first
four innings to chase Japanese
starter and loser Hideyuki
Awano. Shortstop Corv Snvder
opened the outburst with a
triple off the top of the center
field fence in the second.
Catcher B.J. Surhoff singled
him home and then to
third on Gary Green's single to
right. Second baseman Havio
Alfaro then beat a double play
relay to allow Surhoff to score.
In the third, consecutive
singles by right fielder Shane
Mack, left fielder Will Clark,
and USC first baseman Mark
McGwire plated the Americans'
third run.
In the four-run fourth, pitcher
Scott Bankhead came to bat
with runners on first and second
with no one out. He attempted
to sacrifice, but an wide throw
allowed one run to score and

put runners on second and third.
Arizona State's Oddibe
MeDowell followed with a two
run single to right.
McDowell advanced to third
after a walk and a double play,
and McGwire — who was
drafted by the Oakland Ath
letics last month — got his
second KBI of the day with a
single to center to make it 7-0.
Clark ended the scoring with
a solo home run over the right
field fence in the sixth.
Bankhead got the victory,
working six innings and combin
ing with Fresno State's John
Hoover on the four-hit shutout.
'
He struek out six and walked
one. The game was called after
7 1/2 innings.
The Olympic team's game
was followed by the clash be
tween the Tastes Great and Less
Filling teams in a tour-inning
softball game. The Tastes Great
team won. 7-5, behind two hits
by Giants' manager Frank Rob
inson.
Among notable occurences
were the double by former New
York Mets "no-hit, no-field"
standout Marvelous Marv
Throne berry and a protest by
former Baltimore Orioles' and
Cleveland Indians' slugger Boog
Powell of the eyesight of former
umpire Jim Honichek.
Fans were disappointed,
however, when Lee Meredith,
Mickey Spillane's "Doll", failed
to repeat her home run off Rod
ney Dangerfield, managing only
a strikeout and groundout. Dan
gerfield has apparently given up

pitching, as the Less Filling
reliever did not show up for yes
terday's showdown.
The National League
workout featured batting
practice by some of the game's
greatest hitters. Giants Bob
Brenly and Chili Davis received
the loudest ovations. Brenly
responded with several shots
over the left-field fence to the
kids waiting with their gloves,
while Davis sent a few line
drives off the fence in right.
The loudest boos of the day
were reserved for Los Angeles
Dodger Mike Marshall — a
typical response at the 'Stick —
and San Diego Padre Steve
Garvey — a former Dodger.

Rickey Henderson of the A's
received the loudest ovation
among the American Leaguers.
The Oakland outfielder, noted
more for his speed than his
power, proceeded to send a few
shots over the 400-foot sign in
center. The fans also gave a
welcome to former Athletic
Tony Armas, now with the Bos
ton Red Sox.
The workout ended with a
home run duel between Califor
nia Angel Reggie Jackson and
Baltimore's Eddie Murray.
Murray opened up strong, put
ting two shots deep into the
back rows of the football
grandstand in right, but Jackson
won the competition when he

parked a drive into the upper
deck seats in right, ending a long
afternoon of baseball for the al
most 15,000 who spent a warm,
sunny, but as usual windy, after
noon at the 'Stick.
The wind seems to be the
main topic of pre-game con
versation here. Many recall the
last classic played here in 1961,
when National League pitcher
Stu Miller was blown off the
mound and called for a balk.
Yesterday's wind began about
2:30 p.m. and two hours later
began to litter the field with the
paper that seems an un
avoidable part of baseball at
Candlestick.

practice by some of the game's
greatest hitters. Giants Bob
Brenly and Chili Davis received
the loudest ovations. Brenly
responded with several shots
over the left-field fence to the
kids waiting with their gloves,
while Davis sent a few line
drives off the fence in right.
The loudest boos of the day
were reserved for Los Angeles
Dodger Mike Marshall — a
typical response at the 'Stick —
and San Diego Padre Steve
Garvey — a former Dodger.

Rickey Henderson of the A's
received the loudest ovation
among the American Leaguers.
The Oakland outfielder, noted
more for his speed than his
power, proceeded to send a few
shots over the 400-foot sign in
center. The fans also gave a
welcome to former Athletic
Tony Armas, now with the Bos
ton Red Sox.
The workout ended with a
home run duel between Califor
nia Angel Reggie Jackson and
Baltimore's Eddie Murray.
Murray opened up strong, put
ting two shots deep into the
back rows of the football
grandstand in right, but Jackson
won the competition when he

parked a drive into the upper
deck seats in right, ending a long
afternoon of baseball for the al
most 15,000 who spent a warm,
sunny, but as usual windy, after
noon at the 'Stick.
The wind seems to be the
main topic of pre-game con
versation here. Many recall the
last classic played here in 1961,
when National League pitcher
Stu Miller was blown off the
mound and called for a balk.
Yesterday's wind began about
2:30 p.m. and two hours later
began to litter the field with the
paper that seems an un
avoidable part of baseball at
Candlestick.
