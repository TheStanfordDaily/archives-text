## Surprises abound at used record stores 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
As new album prices rise to the $N
level, the student record junkie is faced
with a difficult dilemma: How to indulge
a powerful addiction without ending up
in the poorhouse.
Fortunately, a reasonable solution
exists.
1 he music lover on a budget can find
quick lixes at any one of a number of
good used record stores in the area.
These stores feature recent releases for
less than half their list prices, and also ot
ter rare and out-of-print records which
are unavailable elsewhere at any price.
Ihe key to judging used record stores
is to match your tastes to those of the
proprietor. No store meets everyone's
needs, but the Peninsula offers at least
one good store for almost any taste.
Before heading off to a used record
store in search of serendipitous dis
coveries. several points of advice may be
useful.
First, remember that the cream always
rises to the top. New releases or rare
items have very short shelf lives. Because
of this, it's a good idea to make regular
visits to favorite stores. Look for stores
which have new arrival bins which elimi
nate the need to plow through all the old
merchandise which has been sitting for
months.
It's also a good idea to decide how
pick\ you want to be in terms of quality.
Most reputable used stores guarantee
their records against major defects, but
some are more choosey about their mer
chandise' than others. Some will buy al
most anything that doesn't have
scratches, but others only stock records
in excellent or mint condition. If you
have cheap stereo, minor flaws won't
matter. But an expensive sound system
will pick up small imperfections and
magnify any defects in your records.
There are also major variations be
tween stoves over how long you can keep
u leeord be fare returning it. whether
non-defective records are retuiyiable and
whether records can be rented for taping.
A good way to estimate a store's
standards is to count how many of the
lollowing records it stocks: "Frampton
Comes Alive." "Saturday Night Fever,"
or any albums by Chicago or Kiss.
All of these albums were million
sellers when first released, and all have
fallen into disfavor in recent years. Dis
criminating stores refuse to purchase
them because they know they won't sell.
I he more of these albums a store has,
the less selective it is. and this lack of dis
crimination in terms of content is likely
to be accompanied by a similar lack of
selectivity with regard to the condition of
its wares.
Finally, be on the lookout for imports,
out-ot-print records, promotional copies

ol new releases, and special discs which
were never released to regular retail out
lets.
Used record stores often have albums
which are unavailable elsewhere. Many
of these come from disc jockeys and
music critics who receive hundreds of
tree records and sell some of them to
supplement their incomes.
With these guidelines in mind, used
record stores can pro\ ide countless hours
ol inexpensive pleasure. Every visit can
produce new discoveries, and the infor
mal atmosphere of most used stores is a
nice contrast to the jarring high-tech feel
ol Tower Records and other chain stores.
Without further ado:
Chimaera Books and Records
Kipling and Lvtfon
Palo Alto
327-1122
( himaera is a Palo Alto institution
threatened with extinction. Located in a
comfortably worn Victorian house one
block oft University Avenue near the
New Varsity Theater, Chimaera has
been a haven for book and music lovers
alike lor 13 years. The store is full of
cozy little irregularly shaped rooms
where customers can curl up with good
books on comfortably worn pieces of
furniture.
But the store s live-year lease expired
at the beginning of April, and the build
ing s owner, Dennis Levett. wants to
convert the structure into office space.
Because of this, Chimaera will have to
move in less than a year. Owner Walter

Martin, a 41-year-old Stanford graduate,
is looking for a new location.
The record section is to the left of the
front entrance and specializes in classical
music. Between the sections labelled
classical, opera and piano, there are 15
bins ot classical records, compared to
seven rock bins, five jazz bins, and
smaller sections devoted to reggae, soul,
comedy and other genres.
Chimaera's records are all in good to
excellent condition, and because of this,
its stock is smaller and its prices are
slightly higher than those at Recycled
Records two blocks away.
Almost one-third of Chimaera's rock
records are contained in its two "new ar
rival" bins, and after the first visit,
record-buyers can save time by skipping
the other bins and checking out only the
new stuff. I'his section has a rapid turn
over rate, so it's a good idea to check it
out frequently. The true bargains and
rare finds are often snapped up within
hours.
The best thing about Chimaera is its
atmosphere. As Charles Emerson, the
owner of competing Coyote Records, put
it. "I've always been a sucker for that in
tellectually stimulating ambience."
Detective records are returnable for
two days after purchase.
Used records can be rented for $1 per
week per disc, and new records rent for
$2 and up per week. Beware, however.
( himaera charges sales tax on the
deposit for record rentals and does not
refund the tax. This can boost the cost of
a rental by 50 percent. Although

Chimaera insists this practice is required
by law. the other local stores don't seem
to follow the same policy.
Coyote Records
4319 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
941-8022
Coyote is the new kid on the block.
Opened in December in a tiny (250
square feet) storefront on El Camino a
few blocks north of San Antonio Road.
Coyote specializes in rare and out-of
print jazz and soul records. Owner
manager Charles Emerson estimates that
1 000 of his 8000 albums arc out of print.
Another 500 are so precious to him that
they are not for sale, although he is will
ing to rent them out for taping.
Coyote also stocks rock and classical
records, but jazz, soul and rhythm and
blues form the heart of its collection.
The store has a very different feel to it
than most used-record emporia. The
walls are clean and white and festooned
with primitive art objects from around
the world. Emerson also displays several
abstract silkscreen prints of his own
design.
'it's your basic surrealistic retail envi
ronment," said Emerson, 32. "I went
into this business to postpone adulthood,
and I'm doing well enough that I'm in no
danger of having to find a real job."
He enjoys drinking beer with his cus
tomers and chatting amiably about music
and baseball — his two loves. The store
is open Mon.-Sat. from noon until 6:45.
"unless there's a night game scheduled
or I decide to leave early," Emerson
said.
He boasts that his records are of such
high quality that only one percent are
returned as defective, compared to a 5-8
percent return rate for brand-new
records.
All records at Coyote are guaranteed
tor live days. Rentals cost S 1 -$2 per disc
for 48 hours.
Emerson is extremely knowledgeable,
and he's not shy about sharing his ex
pertise with his customers. He often
makes suggestions to browsers and even
sometimes constructively criticizes their
choices.
"This is basically a glorified junk
store," Emerson said, "but it's great
junk."
Record Exchange
2305 S. El Camino Real
San Mateo
345-5945
An adherent to the "If it's got a hole in
the middle, we'll sell it" philosophy of
used records. Record Exchange has a se
lection as big as Recycled Records, and
its prices are very reasonable. Many al
bums go for $3 or less. Recent trips have
yielded good copies of the Beatles'
"Something New" and David Grisman's
"Hot Dawg" for $2.99 and $3.49,
