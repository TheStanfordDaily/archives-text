## Surprises abound at used record stores 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
As new album prices rise to the $N
level, the student record junkie is faced
with a difficult dilemma: How to indulge
a powerful addiction without ending up
in the poorhouse.
Fortunately, a reasonable solution
exists.
1 he music lover on a budget can find
quick lixes at any one of a number of
good used record stores in the area.
These stores feature recent releases for
less than half their list prices, and also ot
ter rare and out-of-print records which
are unavailable elsewhere at any price.
Ihe key to judging used record stores
is to match your tastes to those of the
proprietor. No store meets everyone's
needs, but the Peninsula offers at least
one good store for almost any taste.
Before heading off to a used record
store in search of serendipitous dis
coveries. several points of advice may be
useful.
First, remember that the cream always
rises to the top. New releases or rare
items have very short shelf lives. Because
of this, it's a good idea to make regular
visits to favorite stores. Look for stores
which have new arrival bins which elimi
nate the need to plow through all the old
merchandise which has been sitting for
months.
It's also a good idea to decide how
pick\ you want to be in terms of quality.
Most reputable used stores guarantee
their records against major defects, but
some are more choosey about their mer
chandise' than others. Some will buy al
most anything that doesn't have
scratches, but others only stock records
in excellent or mint condition. If you
have cheap stereo, minor flaws won't
matter. But an expensive sound system
will pick up small imperfections and
magnify any defects in your records.
There are also major variations be
tween stoves over how long you can keep
u leeord be fare returning it. whether
non-defective records are retuiyiable and
whether records can be rented for taping.
A good way to estimate a store's
standards is to count how many of the
lollowing records it stocks: "Frampton
Comes Alive." "Saturday Night Fever,"
or any albums by Chicago or Kiss.
All of these albums were million
sellers when first released, and all have
fallen into disfavor in recent years. Dis
criminating stores refuse to purchase
them because they know they won't sell.
I he more of these albums a store has,
the less selective it is. and this lack of dis
crimination in terms of content is likely
to be accompanied by a similar lack of
selectivity with regard to the condition of
its wares.
Finally, be on the lookout for imports,
out-ot-print records, promotional copies

ol new releases, and special discs which
were never released to regular retail out
lets.
Used record stores often have albums
which are unavailable elsewhere. Many
of these come from disc jockeys and
music critics who receive hundreds of
tree records and sell some of them to
supplement their incomes.
With these guidelines in mind, used
record stores can pro\ ide countless hours
ol inexpensive pleasure. Every visit can
produce new discoveries, and the infor
mal atmosphere of most used stores is a
nice contrast to the jarring high-tech feel
ol Tower Records and other chain stores.
Without further ado:
Chimaera Books and Records
Kipling and Lvtfon
Palo Alto
327-1122
( himaera is a Palo Alto institution
threatened with extinction. Located in a
comfortably worn Victorian house one
block oft University Avenue near the
New Varsity Theater, Chimaera has
been a haven for book and music lovers
alike lor 13 years. The store is full of
cozy little irregularly shaped rooms
where customers can curl up with good
books on comfortably worn pieces of
furniture.
But the store s live-year lease expired
at the beginning of April, and the build
ing s owner, Dennis Levett. wants to
convert the structure into office space.
Because of this, Chimaera will have to
move in less than a year. Owner Walter

Martin, a 41-year-old Stanford graduate,
is looking for a new location.
The record section is to the left of the
front entrance and specializes in classical
music. Between the sections labelled
classical, opera and piano, there are 15
bins ot classical records, compared to
seven rock bins, five jazz bins, and
smaller sections devoted to reggae, soul,
comedy and other genres.
Chimaera's records are all in good to
excellent condition, and because of this,
its stock is smaller and its prices are
slightly higher than those at Recycled
Records two blocks away.
Almost one-third of Chimaera's rock
records are contained in its two "new ar
rival" bins, and after the first visit,
record-buyers can save time by skipping
the other bins and checking out only the
new stuff. I'his section has a rapid turn
over rate, so it's a good idea to check it
out frequently. The true bargains and
rare finds are often snapped up within
hours.
The best thing about Chimaera is its
atmosphere. As Charles Emerson, the
owner of competing Coyote Records, put
it. "I've always been a sucker for that in
tellectually stimulating ambience."
Detective records are returnable for
two days after purchase.
Used records can be rented for $1 per
week per disc, and new records rent for
$2 and up per week. Beware, however.
( himaera charges sales tax on the
deposit for record rentals and does not
refund the tax. This can boost the cost of
a rental by 50 percent. Although

Chimaera insists this practice is required
by law. the other local stores don't seem
to follow the same policy.
Coyote Records
4319 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
941-8022
Coyote is the new kid on the block.
Opened in December in a tiny (250
square feet) storefront on El Camino a
few blocks north of San Antonio Road.
Coyote specializes in rare and out-of
print jazz and soul records. Owner
manager Charles Emerson estimates that
1 000 of his 8000 albums arc out of print.
Another 500 are so precious to him that
they are not for sale, although he is will
ing to rent them out for taping.
Coyote also stocks rock and classical
records, but jazz, soul and rhythm and
blues form the heart of its collection.
The store has a very different feel to it
than most used-record emporia. The
walls are clean and white and festooned
with primitive art objects from around
the world. Emerson also displays several
abstract silkscreen prints of his own
design.
'it's your basic surrealistic retail envi
ronment," said Emerson, 32. "I went
into this business to postpone adulthood,
and I'm doing well enough that I'm in no
danger of having to find a real job."
He enjoys drinking beer with his cus
tomers and chatting amiably about music
and baseball — his two loves. The store
is open Mon.-Sat. from noon until 6:45.
"unless there's a night game scheduled
or I decide to leave early," Emerson
said.
He boasts that his records are of such
high quality that only one percent are
returned as defective, compared to a 5-8
percent return rate for brand-new
records.
All records at Coyote are guaranteed
tor live days. Rentals cost S 1 -$2 per disc
for 48 hours.
Emerson is extremely knowledgeable,
and he's not shy about sharing his ex
pertise with his customers. He often
makes suggestions to browsers and even
sometimes constructively criticizes their
choices.
"This is basically a glorified junk
store," Emerson said, "but it's great
junk."
Record Exchange
2305 S. El Camino Real
San Mateo
345-5945
An adherent to the "If it's got a hole in
the middle, we'll sell it" philosophy of
used records. Record Exchange has a se
lection as big as Recycled Records, and
its prices are very reasonable. Many al
bums go for $3 or less. Recent trips have
yielded good copies of the Beatles'
"Something New" and David Grisman's
"Hot Dawg" for $2.99 and $3.49,

respectively.
I he store places an unfortunate em
phasis on heavy metal, however. Records
by Def Leppard, Van Halen, and others
of their ilk are prominently displayed in a
special section, and the house stereo is
usually blaring some mindless mishmash
ot bass ritts and misogynistic ranting.
During a recent visit, the leather-clad
counterman (who looked like an un
masked member of Kiss) informed me he
"really wasn't into reading until (he)
read this book about the Beatles."
The place has a nice air of informality
about it. Last week I found the door wide
open, the stereo blaring, and the store
completely empty of employees. When
the proprietor returned five minutes
later, he said he liked to get some fresh
air every now and then.
This informality unfortunately extends
to the return policy. Two different in
quiries about guarantees elicited hazy
answers. On my most recent visit, 1 was
told, ''Look, you're buying a used
record, you know." When it was clear I
considered the answer unsatisfactory, he
said, "Well, I guess if it's really bad you
can take it in."
Recycle Books and Records
230 Hamilton Ave.
Palo Alto
321-2846
Basically a bookstore, Recycle carries
almost 1000 used records and is looking
to expand its record department.
The store wants to move to a bigger lo
cation, and is currently investigating
several possible sites on University Ave
nue, according to Manager Pat Sobrero.
Recycle's most appealing feature is its
return policy. All used records which sell
for $2 or more are guaranteed, not just
for defects, but for disinterest as well.
"Even if there's nothing wrong with it, if
you decide you just don't like it, you can
return it within two days for full credit,"
Sobrero said.
Used records can be rented for 50
cents per day.
Sobrero said she doesn't like to keep
records in stock very long. Because of
this, all records which have been in the
bins for six months or more sell for less
than a dollar.
Recycle has a sister store in downtown
San Jose which is three times as large and
has ten times as many records. If you
don t tind what you're looking for at the
Palo Alto store, you can order it from the

San Jose outlet and have it delivered to
Palo Alto at no charge.
Recycled Records
550 Cow per
Palo Alto
321-3806
Offering by far the largest selection of
used records in Palo Alto, Recycled sells
more than 15 different categories of
music, but the emphasis is on rock. Less
than a block off University Avenue,
Recycled is part of a three-store chain.
The other stores, located in Haight-
Ashbury and North Beach, wiP accept
returns from the Palo Alto outlet, and
vice versa.
Although there is no new arrivals bin
for albums, Recycled does have a new
arrivals section for its 12" singles.
According to manager Greg Marriner,
the Palo Alto store started with 5000 al
bums three years ago, and now has 15-
20,000. Marriner said the store's most
distinctive features are its collections of
imports, music magazines and cassettes.
The store is very successful, and Mar
riner said Recycled is currently consider
ing opening a fourth store in San Fran
cisco or Berkeley. A move to a larger lo
cation in Palo Alto is also a possibility.
One of the store's best features is its
selection of records for $1 or less. I've
purchased several 75-cent albums here
which, while far from mint condition,
were free of skips and survived

numerous playings.
Recycled also has many $ 1.50 records,
including titles by the Rolling Stones,
Marvin Gaye and other major artists.
All records priced at more than $1 are
guaranteed against detects for four days.
Records can be rented for 75 cents per
day.
Rod's Used Records & Tapes
119 W. 25th Ave.
San Mateo
571-0440
Two blocks away from Record Ex
change, Rod s has a moderate selection
ot rock albums, and surprisingly large
stocks of soundtracks and MOR music.
Most prices are fairly low, but the
pricing policy seemed erratic. A used
copy of Laurie Anderson's latest album
sold tor $6.99 — more than new copies
sell for in many stores. Other new
releases, however, sold for $3.49 or less.
Rod's has another store in San Carlos.
Wessex Used Books & Records
1083 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
321-1333
Boasting the area's largest selection of
used classical records, Wessex is a quaint
little shop named after the English
county which was the setting for Thomas
Hardy's novels.
Owner Tom Hayden (no relation to
Jane Fonda) bought a collection of ap
proximately 25,000 classical records last
year, and approximately 5000 of those

albums are currently on sale at Wessex.
"We're very selective about what we
buy," said Assistant Manager Suzanne
Flint. "Our records are all in excellent
condition, and even the $1.50 albums are
guaranteed." Defective albums can be
returned within three days for credit. No
refunds are offered.
The store also has roughly 600 blues
and 300 jazz albums on sale, as well as
100 discs of ethnic music from around
the world. It used to sell rock records,
but Hayden is in the final stages of li
quidating his rock holdings. Less than
100 rock albums remain, sandwiched
with tolk and comedy records in a single
bin. Wessex no longer purchases records
in those categories.
Recent additions to the store's stock
are conveniently displayed in "new arri
val" bins which are cleaned out every
week.
Wessex does not rent its albums for
taping. It does occasionally offer sales,
such as a recent 30 percent markdown on
all non-blues albums.
World Records
1076 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-1237
A small storefront with a small selec
tion, World Records nonetheless offers
some real gems for the discriminating
buyer. A recent visit yielded a near-mint
copy of "Beatles VI" that the counter
man assured me came from his personal
collection. The stacks also included an
excellent copy of a rare album by the
Bobby Fuller Four on Mustang Records.
The store seems to cater to a
predominantly high school clientele. It
otters 20 percent student discounts,
which apply to college students as well. It
also has a stack ot posters which are
available tor free with any purchase.
The small interior is dominated by a
massive pair ot five-foot high Peavey
speakers. When I entered last week, the
speakers were blasting at ear-splitting
volume. Ihe sound was quickly turned
off, and the counterman politely asked if
he could turn it on again. When 1 assured
him it was okay, he turned up the juice
for Prince's "1999" and bunged on the
counter with a pair of drumsticks.
(This is the first article in a three-part se
ries. The second installment will explore
used record stores' buying policies, and
the third will look at used record stores in
San Francisco and the East Bay.)

Charles Emerson of Coyote Records threatens one of his less valuable albums.
The spear is not for sale.
As new album prices rise to the $N
level, the student record junkie is faced
with a difficult dilemma: How to indulge
a powerful addiction without ending up
in the poorhouse.
Fortunately, a reasonable solution
exists.
1 he music lover on a budget can find
quick lixes at any one of a number of
good used record stores in the area.
These stores feature recent releases for
less than half their list prices, and also ot
ter rare and out-of-print records which
are unavailable elsewhere at any price.
Ihe key to judging used record stores
is to match your tastes to those of the
proprietor. No store meets everyone's
needs, but the Peninsula offers at least
one good store for almost any taste.
Before heading off to a used record
store in search of serendipitous dis
coveries. several points of advice may be
useful.
First, remember that the cream always
rises to the top. New releases or rare
items have very short shelf lives. Because
of this, it's a good idea to make regular
visits to favorite stores. Look for stores
which have new arrival bins which elimi
nate the need to plow through all the old
merchandise which has been sitting for
months.
It's also a good idea to decide how
pick\ you want to be in terms of quality.
Most reputable used stores guarantee
their records against major defects, but
some are more choosey about their mer
chandise' than others. Some will buy al
most anything that doesn't have
scratches, but others only stock records
in excellent or mint condition. If you
have cheap stereo, minor flaws won't
matter. But an expensive sound system
will pick up small imperfections and
magnify any defects in your records.
There are also major variations be
tween stoves over how long you can keep
u leeord be fare returning it. whether
non-defective records are retuiyiable and
whether records can be rented for taping.
A good way to estimate a store's
standards is to count how many of the
lollowing records it stocks: "Frampton
Comes Alive." "Saturday Night Fever,"
or any albums by Chicago or Kiss.
All of these albums were million
sellers when first released, and all have
fallen into disfavor in recent years. Dis
criminating stores refuse to purchase
them because they know they won't sell.
I he more of these albums a store has,
the less selective it is. and this lack of dis
crimination in terms of content is likely
to be accompanied by a similar lack of
selectivity with regard to the condition of
its wares.
Finally, be on the lookout for imports,
out-ot-print records, promotional copies

ol new releases, and special discs which
were never released to regular retail out
lets.
Used record stores often have albums
which are unavailable elsewhere. Many
of these come from disc jockeys and
music critics who receive hundreds of
tree records and sell some of them to
supplement their incomes.
With these guidelines in mind, used
record stores can pro\ ide countless hours
ol inexpensive pleasure. Every visit can
produce new discoveries, and the infor
mal atmosphere of most used stores is a
nice contrast to the jarring high-tech feel
ol Tower Records and other chain stores.
Without further ado:
Chimaera Books and Records
Kipling and Lvtfon
Palo Alto
327-1122
( himaera is a Palo Alto institution
threatened with extinction. Located in a
comfortably worn Victorian house one
block oft University Avenue near the
New Varsity Theater, Chimaera has
been a haven for book and music lovers
alike lor 13 years. The store is full of
cozy little irregularly shaped rooms
where customers can curl up with good
books on comfortably worn pieces of
furniture.
But the store s live-year lease expired
at the beginning of April, and the build
ing s owner, Dennis Levett. wants to
convert the structure into office space.
Because of this, Chimaera will have to
move in less than a year. Owner Walter

Martin, a 41-year-old Stanford graduate,
is looking for a new location.
The record section is to the left of the
front entrance and specializes in classical
music. Between the sections labelled
classical, opera and piano, there are 15
bins ot classical records, compared to
seven rock bins, five jazz bins, and
smaller sections devoted to reggae, soul,
comedy and other genres.
Chimaera's records are all in good to
excellent condition, and because of this,
its stock is smaller and its prices are
slightly higher than those at Recycled
Records two blocks away.
Almost one-third of Chimaera's rock
records are contained in its two "new ar
rival" bins, and after the first visit,
record-buyers can save time by skipping
the other bins and checking out only the
new stuff. I'his section has a rapid turn
over rate, so it's a good idea to check it
out frequently. The true bargains and
rare finds are often snapped up within
hours.
The best thing about Chimaera is its
atmosphere. As Charles Emerson, the
owner of competing Coyote Records, put
it. "I've always been a sucker for that in
tellectually stimulating ambience."
Detective records are returnable for
two days after purchase.
Used records can be rented for $1 per
week per disc, and new records rent for
$2 and up per week. Beware, however.
( himaera charges sales tax on the
deposit for record rentals and does not
refund the tax. This can boost the cost of
a rental by 50 percent. Although

Chimaera insists this practice is required
by law. the other local stores don't seem
to follow the same policy.
Coyote Records
4319 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
941-8022
Coyote is the new kid on the block.
Opened in December in a tiny (250
square feet) storefront on El Camino a
few blocks north of San Antonio Road.
Coyote specializes in rare and out-of
print jazz and soul records. Owner
manager Charles Emerson estimates that
1 000 of his 8000 albums arc out of print.
Another 500 are so precious to him that
they are not for sale, although he is will
ing to rent them out for taping.
Coyote also stocks rock and classical
records, but jazz, soul and rhythm and
blues form the heart of its collection.
The store has a very different feel to it
than most used-record emporia. The
walls are clean and white and festooned
with primitive art objects from around
the world. Emerson also displays several
abstract silkscreen prints of his own
design.
'it's your basic surrealistic retail envi
ronment," said Emerson, 32. "I went
into this business to postpone adulthood,
and I'm doing well enough that I'm in no
danger of having to find a real job."
He enjoys drinking beer with his cus
tomers and chatting amiably about music
and baseball — his two loves. The store
is open Mon.-Sat. from noon until 6:45.
"unless there's a night game scheduled
or I decide to leave early," Emerson
said.
He boasts that his records are of such
high quality that only one percent are
returned as defective, compared to a 5-8
percent return rate for brand-new
records.
All records at Coyote are guaranteed
tor live days. Rentals cost S 1 -$2 per disc
for 48 hours.
Emerson is extremely knowledgeable,
and he's not shy about sharing his ex
pertise with his customers. He often
makes suggestions to browsers and even
sometimes constructively criticizes their
choices.
"This is basically a glorified junk
store," Emerson said, "but it's great
junk."
Record Exchange
2305 S. El Camino Real
San Mateo
345-5945
An adherent to the "If it's got a hole in
the middle, we'll sell it" philosophy of
used records. Record Exchange has a se
lection as big as Recycled Records, and
its prices are very reasonable. Many al
bums go for $3 or less. Recent trips have
yielded good copies of the Beatles'
"Something New" and David Grisman's
"Hot Dawg" for $2.99 and $3.49,

respectively.
I he store places an unfortunate em
phasis on heavy metal, however. Records
by Def Leppard, Van Halen, and others
of their ilk are prominently displayed in a
special section, and the house stereo is
usually blaring some mindless mishmash
ot bass ritts and misogynistic ranting.
During a recent visit, the leather-clad
counterman (who looked like an un
masked member of Kiss) informed me he
"really wasn't into reading until (he)
read this book about the Beatles."
The place has a nice air of informality
about it. Last week I found the door wide
open, the stereo blaring, and the store
completely empty of employees. When
the proprietor returned five minutes
later, he said he liked to get some fresh
air every now and then.
This informality unfortunately extends
to the return policy. Two different in
quiries about guarantees elicited hazy
answers. On my most recent visit, 1 was
told, ''Look, you're buying a used
record, you know." When it was clear I
considered the answer unsatisfactory, he
said, "Well, I guess if it's really bad you
can take it in."
Recycle Books and Records
230 Hamilton Ave.
Palo Alto
321-2846
Basically a bookstore, Recycle carries
almost 1000 used records and is looking
to expand its record department.
The store wants to move to a bigger lo
cation, and is currently investigating
several possible sites on University Ave
nue, according to Manager Pat Sobrero.
Recycle's most appealing feature is its
return policy. All used records which sell
for $2 or more are guaranteed, not just
for defects, but for disinterest as well.
"Even if there's nothing wrong with it, if
you decide you just don't like it, you can
return it within two days for full credit,"
Sobrero said.
Used records can be rented for 50
cents per day.
Sobrero said she doesn't like to keep
records in stock very long. Because of
this, all records which have been in the
bins for six months or more sell for less
than a dollar.
Recycle has a sister store in downtown
San Jose which is three times as large and
has ten times as many records. If you
don t tind what you're looking for at the
Palo Alto store, you can order it from the

San Jose outlet and have it delivered to
Palo Alto at no charge.
Recycled Records
550 Cow per
Palo Alto
321-3806
Offering by far the largest selection of
used records in Palo Alto, Recycled sells
more than 15 different categories of
music, but the emphasis is on rock. Less
than a block off University Avenue,
Recycled is part of a three-store chain.
The other stores, located in Haight-
Ashbury and North Beach, wiP accept
returns from the Palo Alto outlet, and
vice versa.
Although there is no new arrivals bin
for albums, Recycled does have a new
arrivals section for its 12" singles.
According to manager Greg Marriner,
the Palo Alto store started with 5000 al
bums three years ago, and now has 15-
20,000. Marriner said the store's most
distinctive features are its collections of
imports, music magazines and cassettes.
The store is very successful, and Mar
riner said Recycled is currently consider
ing opening a fourth store in San Fran
cisco or Berkeley. A move to a larger lo
cation in Palo Alto is also a possibility.
One of the store's best features is its
selection of records for $1 or less. I've
purchased several 75-cent albums here
which, while far from mint condition,
were free of skips and survived

numerous playings.
Recycled also has many $ 1.50 records,
including titles by the Rolling Stones,
Marvin Gaye and other major artists.
All records priced at more than $1 are
guaranteed against detects for four days.
Records can be rented for 75 cents per
day.
Rod's Used Records & Tapes
119 W. 25th Ave.
San Mateo
571-0440
Two blocks away from Record Ex
change, Rod s has a moderate selection
ot rock albums, and surprisingly large
stocks of soundtracks and MOR music.
Most prices are fairly low, but the
pricing policy seemed erratic. A used
copy of Laurie Anderson's latest album
sold tor $6.99 — more than new copies
sell for in many stores. Other new
releases, however, sold for $3.49 or less.
Rod's has another store in San Carlos.
Wessex Used Books & Records
1083 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
321-1333
Boasting the area's largest selection of
used classical records, Wessex is a quaint
little shop named after the English
county which was the setting for Thomas
Hardy's novels.
Owner Tom Hayden (no relation to
Jane Fonda) bought a collection of ap
proximately 25,000 classical records last
year, and approximately 5000 of those

albums are currently on sale at Wessex.
"We're very selective about what we
buy," said Assistant Manager Suzanne
Flint. "Our records are all in excellent
condition, and even the $1.50 albums are
guaranteed." Defective albums can be
returned within three days for credit. No
refunds are offered.
The store also has roughly 600 blues
and 300 jazz albums on sale, as well as
100 discs of ethnic music from around
the world. It used to sell rock records,
but Hayden is in the final stages of li
quidating his rock holdings. Less than
100 rock albums remain, sandwiched
with tolk and comedy records in a single
bin. Wessex no longer purchases records
in those categories.
Recent additions to the store's stock
are conveniently displayed in "new arri
val" bins which are cleaned out every
week.
Wessex does not rent its albums for
taping. It does occasionally offer sales,
such as a recent 30 percent markdown on
all non-blues albums.
World Records
1076 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-1237
A small storefront with a small selec
tion, World Records nonetheless offers
some real gems for the discriminating
buyer. A recent visit yielded a near-mint
copy of "Beatles VI" that the counter
man assured me came from his personal
collection. The stacks also included an
excellent copy of a rare album by the
Bobby Fuller Four on Mustang Records.
The store seems to cater to a
predominantly high school clientele. It
otters 20 percent student discounts,
which apply to college students as well. It
also has a stack ot posters which are
available tor free with any purchase.
The small interior is dominated by a
massive pair ot five-foot high Peavey
speakers. When I entered last week, the
speakers were blasting at ear-splitting
volume. Ihe sound was quickly turned
off, and the counterman politely asked if
he could turn it on again. When 1 assured
him it was okay, he turned up the juice
for Prince's "1999" and bunged on the
counter with a pair of drumsticks.

Charles Emerson of Coyote Records threatens one of his less valuable albums.
The spear is not for sale.
As new album prices rise to the $N
level, the student record junkie is faced
with a difficult dilemma: How to indulge
a powerful addiction without ending up
in the poorhouse.
Fortunately, a reasonable solution
exists.
1 he music lover on a budget can find
quick lixes at any one of a number of
good used record stores in the area.
These stores feature recent releases for
less than half their list prices, and also ot
ter rare and out-of-print records which
are unavailable elsewhere at any price.
Ihe key to judging used record stores
is to match your tastes to those of the
proprietor. No store meets everyone's
needs, but the Peninsula offers at least
one good store for almost any taste.
Before heading off to a used record
store in search of serendipitous dis
coveries. several points of advice may be
useful.
First, remember that the cream always
rises to the top. New releases or rare
items have very short shelf lives. Because
of this, it's a good idea to make regular
visits to favorite stores. Look for stores
which have new arrival bins which elimi
nate the need to plow through all the old
merchandise which has been sitting for
months.
It's also a good idea to decide how
pick\ you want to be in terms of quality.
Most reputable used stores guarantee
their records against major defects, but
some are more choosey about their mer
chandise' than others. Some will buy al
most anything that doesn't have
scratches, but others only stock records
in excellent or mint condition. If you
have cheap stereo, minor flaws won't
matter. But an expensive sound system
will pick up small imperfections and
magnify any defects in your records.
There are also major variations be
tween stoves over how long you can keep
u leeord be fare returning it. whether
non-defective records are retuiyiable and
whether records can be rented for taping.
A good way to estimate a store's
standards is to count how many of the
lollowing records it stocks: "Frampton
Comes Alive." "Saturday Night Fever,"
or any albums by Chicago or Kiss.
All of these albums were million
sellers when first released, and all have
fallen into disfavor in recent years. Dis
criminating stores refuse to purchase
them because they know they won't sell.
I he more of these albums a store has,
the less selective it is. and this lack of dis
crimination in terms of content is likely
to be accompanied by a similar lack of
selectivity with regard to the condition of
its wares.
Finally, be on the lookout for imports,
out-ot-print records, promotional copies

ol new releases, and special discs which
were never released to regular retail out
lets.
Used record stores often have albums
which are unavailable elsewhere. Many
of these come from disc jockeys and
music critics who receive hundreds of
tree records and sell some of them to
supplement their incomes.
With these guidelines in mind, used
record stores can pro\ ide countless hours
ol inexpensive pleasure. Every visit can
produce new discoveries, and the infor
mal atmosphere of most used stores is a
nice contrast to the jarring high-tech feel
ol Tower Records and other chain stores.
Without further ado:
Chimaera Books and Records
Kipling and Lvtfon
Palo Alto
327-1122
( himaera is a Palo Alto institution
threatened with extinction. Located in a
comfortably worn Victorian house one
block oft University Avenue near the
New Varsity Theater, Chimaera has
been a haven for book and music lovers
alike lor 13 years. The store is full of
cozy little irregularly shaped rooms
where customers can curl up with good
books on comfortably worn pieces of
furniture.
But the store s live-year lease expired
at the beginning of April, and the build
ing s owner, Dennis Levett. wants to
convert the structure into office space.
Because of this, Chimaera will have to
move in less than a year. Owner Walter

Martin, a 41-year-old Stanford graduate,
is looking for a new location.
The record section is to the left of the
front entrance and specializes in classical
music. Between the sections labelled
classical, opera and piano, there are 15
bins ot classical records, compared to
seven rock bins, five jazz bins, and
smaller sections devoted to reggae, soul,
comedy and other genres.
Chimaera's records are all in good to
excellent condition, and because of this,
its stock is smaller and its prices are
slightly higher than those at Recycled
Records two blocks away.
Almost one-third of Chimaera's rock
records are contained in its two "new ar
rival" bins, and after the first visit,
record-buyers can save time by skipping
the other bins and checking out only the
new stuff. I'his section has a rapid turn
over rate, so it's a good idea to check it
out frequently. The true bargains and
rare finds are often snapped up within
hours.
The best thing about Chimaera is its
atmosphere. As Charles Emerson, the
owner of competing Coyote Records, put
it. "I've always been a sucker for that in
tellectually stimulating ambience."
Detective records are returnable for
two days after purchase.
Used records can be rented for $1 per
week per disc, and new records rent for
$2 and up per week. Beware, however.
( himaera charges sales tax on the
deposit for record rentals and does not
refund the tax. This can boost the cost of
a rental by 50 percent. Although

Chimaera insists this practice is required
by law. the other local stores don't seem
to follow the same policy.
Coyote Records
4319 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
941-8022
Coyote is the new kid on the block.
Opened in December in a tiny (250
square feet) storefront on El Camino a
few blocks north of San Antonio Road.
Coyote specializes in rare and out-of
print jazz and soul records. Owner
manager Charles Emerson estimates that
1 000 of his 8000 albums arc out of print.
Another 500 are so precious to him that
they are not for sale, although he is will
ing to rent them out for taping.
Coyote also stocks rock and classical
records, but jazz, soul and rhythm and
blues form the heart of its collection.
The store has a very different feel to it
than most used-record emporia. The
walls are clean and white and festooned
with primitive art objects from around
the world. Emerson also displays several
abstract silkscreen prints of his own
design.
'it's your basic surrealistic retail envi
ronment," said Emerson, 32. "I went
into this business to postpone adulthood,
and I'm doing well enough that I'm in no
danger of having to find a real job."
He enjoys drinking beer with his cus
tomers and chatting amiably about music
and baseball — his two loves. The store
is open Mon.-Sat. from noon until 6:45.
"unless there's a night game scheduled
or I decide to leave early," Emerson
said.
He boasts that his records are of such
high quality that only one percent are
returned as defective, compared to a 5-8
percent return rate for brand-new
records.
All records at Coyote are guaranteed
tor live days. Rentals cost S 1 -$2 per disc
for 48 hours.
Emerson is extremely knowledgeable,
and he's not shy about sharing his ex
pertise with his customers. He often
makes suggestions to browsers and even
sometimes constructively criticizes their
choices.
"This is basically a glorified junk
store," Emerson said, "but it's great
junk."
Record Exchange
2305 S. El Camino Real
San Mateo
345-5945
An adherent to the "If it's got a hole in
the middle, we'll sell it" philosophy of
used records. Record Exchange has a se
lection as big as Recycled Records, and
its prices are very reasonable. Many al
bums go for $3 or less. Recent trips have
yielded good copies of the Beatles'
"Something New" and David Grisman's
"Hot Dawg" for $2.99 and $3.49,

respectively.
I he store places an unfortunate em
phasis on heavy metal, however. Records
by Def Leppard, Van Halen, and others
of their ilk are prominently displayed in a
special section, and the house stereo is
usually blaring some mindless mishmash
ot bass ritts and misogynistic ranting.
During a recent visit, the leather-clad
counterman (who looked like an un
masked member of Kiss) informed me he
"really wasn't into reading until (he)
read this book about the Beatles."
The place has a nice air of informality
about it. Last week I found the door wide
open, the stereo blaring, and the store
completely empty of employees. When
the proprietor returned five minutes
later, he said he liked to get some fresh
air every now and then.
This informality unfortunately extends
to the return policy. Two different in
quiries about guarantees elicited hazy
answers. On my most recent visit, 1 was
told, ''Look, you're buying a used
record, you know." When it was clear I
considered the answer unsatisfactory, he
said, "Well, I guess if it's really bad you
can take it in."
Recycle Books and Records
230 Hamilton Ave.
Palo Alto
321-2846
Basically a bookstore, Recycle carries
almost 1000 used records and is looking
to expand its record department.
The store wants to move to a bigger lo
cation, and is currently investigating
several possible sites on University Ave
nue, according to Manager Pat Sobrero.
Recycle's most appealing feature is its
return policy. All used records which sell
for $2 or more are guaranteed, not just
for defects, but for disinterest as well.
"Even if there's nothing wrong with it, if
you decide you just don't like it, you can
return it within two days for full credit,"
Sobrero said.
Used records can be rented for 50
cents per day.
Sobrero said she doesn't like to keep
records in stock very long. Because of
this, all records which have been in the
bins for six months or more sell for less
than a dollar.
Recycle has a sister store in downtown
San Jose which is three times as large and
has ten times as many records. If you
don t tind what you're looking for at the
Palo Alto store, you can order it from the

San Jose outlet and have it delivered to
Palo Alto at no charge.
Recycled Records
550 Cow per
Palo Alto
321-3806
Offering by far the largest selection of
used records in Palo Alto, Recycled sells
more than 15 different categories of
music, but the emphasis is on rock. Less
than a block off University Avenue,
Recycled is part of a three-store chain.
The other stores, located in Haight-
Ashbury and North Beach, wiP accept
returns from the Palo Alto outlet, and
vice versa.
Although there is no new arrivals bin
for albums, Recycled does have a new
arrivals section for its 12" singles.
According to manager Greg Marriner,
the Palo Alto store started with 5000 al
bums three years ago, and now has 15-
20,000. Marriner said the store's most
distinctive features are its collections of
imports, music magazines and cassettes.
The store is very successful, and Mar
riner said Recycled is currently consider
ing opening a fourth store in San Fran
cisco or Berkeley. A move to a larger lo
cation in Palo Alto is also a possibility.
One of the store's best features is its
selection of records for $1 or less. I've
purchased several 75-cent albums here
which, while far from mint condition,
were free of skips and survived

numerous playings.
Recycled also has many $ 1.50 records,
including titles by the Rolling Stones,
Marvin Gaye and other major artists.
All records priced at more than $1 are
guaranteed against detects for four days.
Records can be rented for 75 cents per
day.
Rod's Used Records & Tapes
119 W. 25th Ave.
San Mateo
571-0440
Two blocks away from Record Ex
change, Rod s has a moderate selection
ot rock albums, and surprisingly large
stocks of soundtracks and MOR music.
Most prices are fairly low, but the
pricing policy seemed erratic. A used
copy of Laurie Anderson's latest album
sold tor $6.99 — more than new copies
sell for in many stores. Other new
releases, however, sold for $3.49 or less.
Rod's has another store in San Carlos.
Wessex Used Books & Records
1083 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
321-1333
Boasting the area's largest selection of
used classical records, Wessex is a quaint
little shop named after the English
county which was the setting for Thomas
Hardy's novels.
Owner Tom Hayden (no relation to
Jane Fonda) bought a collection of ap
proximately 25,000 classical records last
year, and approximately 5000 of those

albums are currently on sale at Wessex.
"We're very selective about what we
buy," said Assistant Manager Suzanne
Flint. "Our records are all in excellent
condition, and even the $1.50 albums are
guaranteed." Defective albums can be
returned within three days for credit. No
refunds are offered.
The store also has roughly 600 blues
and 300 jazz albums on sale, as well as
100 discs of ethnic music from around
the world. It used to sell rock records,
but Hayden is in the final stages of li
quidating his rock holdings. Less than
100 rock albums remain, sandwiched
with tolk and comedy records in a single
bin. Wessex no longer purchases records
in those categories.
Recent additions to the store's stock
are conveniently displayed in "new arri
val" bins which are cleaned out every
week.
Wessex does not rent its albums for
taping. It does occasionally offer sales,
such as a recent 30 percent markdown on
all non-blues albums.
World Records
1076 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-1237
A small storefront with a small selec
tion, World Records nonetheless offers
some real gems for the discriminating
buyer. A recent visit yielded a near-mint
copy of "Beatles VI" that the counter
man assured me came from his personal
collection. The stacks also included an
excellent copy of a rare album by the
Bobby Fuller Four on Mustang Records.
The store seems to cater to a
predominantly high school clientele. It
otters 20 percent student discounts,
which apply to college students as well. It
also has a stack ot posters which are
available tor free with any purchase.
The small interior is dominated by a
massive pair ot five-foot high Peavey
speakers. When I entered last week, the
speakers were blasting at ear-splitting
volume. Ihe sound was quickly turned
off, and the counterman politely asked if
he could turn it on again. When 1 assured
him it was okay, he turned up the juice
for Prince's "1999" and bunged on the
counter with a pair of drumsticks.

Charles Emerson of Coyote Records threatens one of his less valuable albums.
The spear is not for sale.
As new album prices rise to the $N
level, the student record junkie is faced
with a difficult dilemma: How to indulge
a powerful addiction without ending up
in the poorhouse.
Fortunately, a reasonable solution
exists.
1 he music lover on a budget can find
quick lixes at any one of a number of
good used record stores in the area.
These stores feature recent releases for
less than half their list prices, and also ot
ter rare and out-of-print records which
are unavailable elsewhere at any price.
Ihe key to judging used record stores
is to match your tastes to those of the
proprietor. No store meets everyone's
needs, but the Peninsula offers at least
one good store for almost any taste.
Before heading off to a used record
store in search of serendipitous dis
coveries. several points of advice may be
useful.
First, remember that the cream always
rises to the top. New releases or rare
items have very short shelf lives. Because
of this, it's a good idea to make regular
visits to favorite stores. Look for stores
which have new arrival bins which elimi
nate the need to plow through all the old
merchandise which has been sitting for
months.
It's also a good idea to decide how
pick\ you want to be in terms of quality.
Most reputable used stores guarantee
their records against major defects, but
some are more choosey about their mer
chandise' than others. Some will buy al
most anything that doesn't have
scratches, but others only stock records
in excellent or mint condition. If you
have cheap stereo, minor flaws won't
matter. But an expensive sound system
will pick up small imperfections and
magnify any defects in your records.
There are also major variations be
tween stoves over how long you can keep
u leeord be fare returning it. whether
non-defective records are retuiyiable and
whether records can be rented for taping.
A good way to estimate a store's
standards is to count how many of the
lollowing records it stocks: "Frampton
Comes Alive." "Saturday Night Fever,"
or any albums by Chicago or Kiss.
All of these albums were million
sellers when first released, and all have
fallen into disfavor in recent years. Dis
criminating stores refuse to purchase
them because they know they won't sell.
I he more of these albums a store has,
the less selective it is. and this lack of dis
crimination in terms of content is likely
to be accompanied by a similar lack of
selectivity with regard to the condition of
its wares.
Finally, be on the lookout for imports,
out-ot-print records, promotional copies

ol new releases, and special discs which
were never released to regular retail out
lets.
Used record stores often have albums
which are unavailable elsewhere. Many
of these come from disc jockeys and
music critics who receive hundreds of
tree records and sell some of them to
supplement their incomes.
With these guidelines in mind, used
record stores can pro\ ide countless hours
ol inexpensive pleasure. Every visit can
produce new discoveries, and the infor
mal atmosphere of most used stores is a
nice contrast to the jarring high-tech feel
ol Tower Records and other chain stores.
Without further ado:
Chimaera Books and Records
Kipling and Lvtfon
Palo Alto
327-1122
( himaera is a Palo Alto institution
threatened with extinction. Located in a
comfortably worn Victorian house one
block oft University Avenue near the
New Varsity Theater, Chimaera has
been a haven for book and music lovers
alike lor 13 years. The store is full of
cozy little irregularly shaped rooms
where customers can curl up with good
books on comfortably worn pieces of
furniture.
But the store s live-year lease expired
at the beginning of April, and the build
ing s owner, Dennis Levett. wants to
convert the structure into office space.
Because of this, Chimaera will have to
move in less than a year. Owner Walter

Martin, a 41-year-old Stanford graduate,
is looking for a new location.
The record section is to the left of the
front entrance and specializes in classical
music. Between the sections labelled
classical, opera and piano, there are 15
bins ot classical records, compared to
seven rock bins, five jazz bins, and
smaller sections devoted to reggae, soul,
comedy and other genres.
Chimaera's records are all in good to
excellent condition, and because of this,
its stock is smaller and its prices are
slightly higher than those at Recycled
Records two blocks away.
Almost one-third of Chimaera's rock
records are contained in its two "new ar
rival" bins, and after the first visit,
record-buyers can save time by skipping
the other bins and checking out only the
new stuff. I'his section has a rapid turn
over rate, so it's a good idea to check it
out frequently. The true bargains and
rare finds are often snapped up within
hours.
The best thing about Chimaera is its
atmosphere. As Charles Emerson, the
owner of competing Coyote Records, put
it. "I've always been a sucker for that in
tellectually stimulating ambience."
Detective records are returnable for
two days after purchase.
Used records can be rented for $1 per
week per disc, and new records rent for
$2 and up per week. Beware, however.
( himaera charges sales tax on the
deposit for record rentals and does not
refund the tax. This can boost the cost of
a rental by 50 percent. Although

Chimaera insists this practice is required
by law. the other local stores don't seem
to follow the same policy.
Coyote Records
4319 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
941-8022
Coyote is the new kid on the block.
Opened in December in a tiny (250
square feet) storefront on El Camino a
few blocks north of San Antonio Road.
Coyote specializes in rare and out-of
print jazz and soul records. Owner
manager Charles Emerson estimates that
1 000 of his 8000 albums arc out of print.
Another 500 are so precious to him that
they are not for sale, although he is will
ing to rent them out for taping.
Coyote also stocks rock and classical
records, but jazz, soul and rhythm and
blues form the heart of its collection.
The store has a very different feel to it
than most used-record emporia. The
walls are clean and white and festooned
with primitive art objects from around
the world. Emerson also displays several
abstract silkscreen prints of his own
design.
'it's your basic surrealistic retail envi
ronment," said Emerson, 32. "I went
into this business to postpone adulthood,
and I'm doing well enough that I'm in no
danger of having to find a real job."
He enjoys drinking beer with his cus
tomers and chatting amiably about music
and baseball — his two loves. The store
is open Mon.-Sat. from noon until 6:45.
"unless there's a night game scheduled
or I decide to leave early," Emerson
said.
He boasts that his records are of such
high quality that only one percent are
returned as defective, compared to a 5-8
percent return rate for brand-new
records.
All records at Coyote are guaranteed
tor live days. Rentals cost S 1 -$2 per disc
for 48 hours.
Emerson is extremely knowledgeable,
and he's not shy about sharing his ex
pertise with his customers. He often
makes suggestions to browsers and even
sometimes constructively criticizes their
choices.
"This is basically a glorified junk
store," Emerson said, "but it's great
junk."
Record Exchange
2305 S. El Camino Real
San Mateo
345-5945
An adherent to the "If it's got a hole in
the middle, we'll sell it" philosophy of
used records. Record Exchange has a se
lection as big as Recycled Records, and
its prices are very reasonable. Many al
bums go for $3 or less. Recent trips have
yielded good copies of the Beatles'
"Something New" and David Grisman's
"Hot Dawg" for $2.99 and $3.49,

respectively.
I he store places an unfortunate em
phasis on heavy metal, however. Records
by Def Leppard, Van Halen, and others
of their ilk are prominently displayed in a
special section, and the house stereo is
usually blaring some mindless mishmash
ot bass ritts and misogynistic ranting.
During a recent visit, the leather-clad
counterman (who looked like an un
masked member of Kiss) informed me he
"really wasn't into reading until (he)
read this book about the Beatles."
The place has a nice air of informality
about it. Last week I found the door wide
open, the stereo blaring, and the store
completely empty of employees. When
the proprietor returned five minutes
later, he said he liked to get some fresh
air every now and then.
This informality unfortunately extends
to the return policy. Two different in
quiries about guarantees elicited hazy
answers. On my most recent visit, 1 was
told, ''Look, you're buying a used
record, you know." When it was clear I
considered the answer unsatisfactory, he
said, "Well, I guess if it's really bad you
can take it in."
Recycle Books and Records
230 Hamilton Ave.
Palo Alto
321-2846
Basically a bookstore, Recycle carries
almost 1000 used records and is looking
to expand its record department.
The store wants to move to a bigger lo
cation, and is currently investigating
several possible sites on University Ave
nue, according to Manager Pat Sobrero.
Recycle's most appealing feature is its
return policy. All used records which sell
for $2 or more are guaranteed, not just
for defects, but for disinterest as well.
"Even if there's nothing wrong with it, if
you decide you just don't like it, you can
return it within two days for full credit,"
Sobrero said.
Used records can be rented for 50
cents per day.
Sobrero said she doesn't like to keep
records in stock very long. Because of
this, all records which have been in the
bins for six months or more sell for less
than a dollar.
Recycle has a sister store in downtown
San Jose which is three times as large and
has ten times as many records. If you
don t tind what you're looking for at the
Palo Alto store, you can order it from the

San Jose outlet and have it delivered to
Palo Alto at no charge.
Recycled Records
550 Cow per
Palo Alto
321-3806
Offering by far the largest selection of
used records in Palo Alto, Recycled sells
more than 15 different categories of
music, but the emphasis is on rock. Less
than a block off University Avenue,
Recycled is part of a three-store chain.
The other stores, located in Haight-
Ashbury and North Beach, wiP accept
returns from the Palo Alto outlet, and
vice versa.
Although there is no new arrivals bin
for albums, Recycled does have a new
arrivals section for its 12" singles.
According to manager Greg Marriner,
the Palo Alto store started with 5000 al
bums three years ago, and now has 15-
20,000. Marriner said the store's most
distinctive features are its collections of
imports, music magazines and cassettes.
The store is very successful, and Mar
riner said Recycled is currently consider
ing opening a fourth store in San Fran
cisco or Berkeley. A move to a larger lo
cation in Palo Alto is also a possibility.
One of the store's best features is its
selection of records for $1 or less. I've
purchased several 75-cent albums here
which, while far from mint condition,
were free of skips and survived

numerous playings.
Recycled also has many $ 1.50 records,
including titles by the Rolling Stones,
Marvin Gaye and other major artists.
All records priced at more than $1 are
guaranteed against detects for four days.
Records can be rented for 75 cents per
day.
Rod's Used Records & Tapes
119 W. 25th Ave.
San Mateo
571-0440
Two blocks away from Record Ex
change, Rod s has a moderate selection
ot rock albums, and surprisingly large
stocks of soundtracks and MOR music.
Most prices are fairly low, but the
pricing policy seemed erratic. A used
copy of Laurie Anderson's latest album
sold tor $6.99 — more than new copies
sell for in many stores. Other new
releases, however, sold for $3.49 or less.
Rod's has another store in San Carlos.
Wessex Used Books & Records
1083 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
321-1333
Boasting the area's largest selection of
used classical records, Wessex is a quaint
little shop named after the English
county which was the setting for Thomas
Hardy's novels.
Owner Tom Hayden (no relation to
Jane Fonda) bought a collection of ap
proximately 25,000 classical records last
year, and approximately 5000 of those

albums are currently on sale at Wessex.
"We're very selective about what we
buy," said Assistant Manager Suzanne
Flint. "Our records are all in excellent
condition, and even the $1.50 albums are
guaranteed." Defective albums can be
returned within three days for credit. No
refunds are offered.
The store also has roughly 600 blues
and 300 jazz albums on sale, as well as
100 discs of ethnic music from around
the world. It used to sell rock records,
but Hayden is in the final stages of li
quidating his rock holdings. Less than
100 rock albums remain, sandwiched
with tolk and comedy records in a single
bin. Wessex no longer purchases records
in those categories.
Recent additions to the store's stock
are conveniently displayed in "new arri
val" bins which are cleaned out every
week.
Wessex does not rent its albums for
taping. It does occasionally offer sales,
such as a recent 30 percent markdown on
all non-blues albums.
World Records
1076 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-1237
A small storefront with a small selec
tion, World Records nonetheless offers
some real gems for the discriminating
buyer. A recent visit yielded a near-mint
copy of "Beatles VI" that the counter
man assured me came from his personal
collection. The stacks also included an
excellent copy of a rare album by the
Bobby Fuller Four on Mustang Records.
The store seems to cater to a
predominantly high school clientele. It
otters 20 percent student discounts,
which apply to college students as well. It
also has a stack ot posters which are
available tor free with any purchase.
The small interior is dominated by a
massive pair ot five-foot high Peavey
speakers. When I entered last week, the
speakers were blasting at ear-splitting
volume. Ihe sound was quickly turned
off, and the counterman politely asked if
he could turn it on again. When 1 assured
him it was okay, he turned up the juice
for Prince's "1999" and bunged on the
counter with a pair of drumsticks.
