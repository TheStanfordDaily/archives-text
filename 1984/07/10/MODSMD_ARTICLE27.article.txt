# 'Duck's Breath' Theater is right on target

The Duck's Breath Mystery
Theater, a comedy troupe trans
planted to the Bay Area from
the wilds of darkest lowa, pro
vided an evening of solid enter
tainment during two sold-out
shows at the Bijou Saturday
night.
Although more than SO "per
cent of the skits in Saturday's
shows were also in the Duck's
Breath performance 1 saw last
December in Berkeley, the ma
terial aged well and was still
tunny the second time.
Duck's Breath's format is
similar in some ways to
Chicago's Second City group,
but relies more on planned skits
than on improvisation. In this
respect, it is more like Dudley
Riggs' Brave New Workshop in
Minneapolis.
The troupe has attracted na
tional attention recently be
cause two of its characters, Mr.
Science and lan Shoales, are
now regular features on public
radio.
All four Duck's Breath mem
bers who appeared in Palo Alto
(a fifth, Leon Martell, is on
leave) were gifted actors who let
their expressions and body mo
tions convey their messages as
much as their words did. The
most effective performer was
Merle kessler, a small man with
deep-set eyes whose musical
skills and David Letterman-like
cynicism consistently hit the
mark.
Kessler's characters, from
The Folksinger to culture critic
lan Shoales, had an intellectual
edge to them that the perfor

mances by fellow ducks Jim
Turner, Dan Coffey and Bill Al
lard sometimes lacked.
The Folksinger began his set
with a song reminiscent of Neil
Innes' Dylan parody line in the
Monty Python Broadway show
— "I've done a lot of suffering,
and now you're gonna suffer
too."
Kessler's folksinger told the
audience "I'll sing a song about
human rights — about love and
war and fear. I'll sing a song that
lasts too long that no one wants
to hear . . . When Dylan went
electric, my whole world fell
apart. But I'm still singing folk
songs — these two chords arc
my art."
His guitar-playing was actu
ally too good for the character,
and his rich voice carried the
songs without losing the smirky
edge of his speaking voice.
Kessler then launched into a

trucker's ballad entitled "Jesus
Drives My Semi When I'm
Sleeping.".
Equally amusing was the ap
pearance of lan Shoales, Kes
sler's motor-mouthed, mis
anthropic social commentator.
lk l don't like people who
speak French in public places,"
Shoales declared, adding, "This
includes the French."
He continued, "The French
invented only three things —
the croissant, the foreign movie
and existentialism. Existen
tialism only pretended to be a
philosophy. It was just an
excuse for alienated college stu
dents to hang out in ratty cafes
until 3 a.m. and come to believe
that despair is sexually appeal
ing."
But though Shoales' mile-a
minute barbs were generally on
target, the monologue he used

in the show was beginning to
seem a bit dated, especially in
his line about the Grenada
"rescue mission" — "If Reagan
is so worried about the safety of
American medical students,
why didn't he invade Harvard?"
Highlights of the second act
were more abstract.
Most interesting was the "Art
for a good time" skit.
The four ducks rearranged
themselves into freeze-frame
tableaus of famous works of art,
with consistently fascinating
results.
Especially well-done were
Turner's rendition of Botticelli's
"Birth of Venus," Turner and
Coffey's poses for Picasso's
"Demoiselles d'Avignon," and
the group's depiction of Du
champ's "Nude Descending A
Staircase."
Another high note came in
Turner's performance as Dick
Balloonass, the human statue.
After striking poses to represent
mirth and melancholy. Turner's
look of panic was hilarious when
Coffey asked him to portray
onomatopoeia. His perfor
mance as entropy was also
memorable.
Audience participation is a
central element of Duck's
Breath's humor.
At their New Year's perfor
mances at the Julia Morgan
Theater in Berkeley, for exam
ple, Duck's Breath staged an
auction of what they said were
their prized possessions of the
last ten years, including "the
ugliest pair of pants in the
world."
Members of the audience
were invited to come on stage

during intermission to inspect
the merchandise, and the total
proceeds of the auction (less
than $10) were raffled off to an
audience member who submit
ted a question for Mr. Science.
Audience participation was
less important in Saturday's
show, but a skit in which Allard
led the audience in a choral
rendition of "Old McDonald"
(the second movement, in E-I-
E-l-O) worked well.
Not everything worked.
Turner's brain-damaged flower
child, Randee of the Redwoods,
had the audience in stitches, but
drug humor has grown tiresome.
Coffey, the least physical of
the four ducks, occasionally
came off as too sleazy or pom
pous in his characterizations,
losing the street-wise edge that
made Kessler and the other two
performers so effective. Even
his Mr. Science character, a big
hit on the radio every morning,
was only intermittently amusing
at the Bijou.
Judging by the audience
response Saturday night, Bijou
owners Bob Stern and Mark
Tommacci appear to have hit
the mark with their new series
of weekly comedy shows. The
lines stretched around the
block, and the audience enthusi
astically chanted for an encore
at the late show.
But the Bijou's small lobby
was ill-equipped to accommo
date the intermission rush from
a sellout crowd. Many
abandoned their plans to visit
the candy counter or rest rooms
when confronted with the
sardine-like conditions outside
the auditorium.


Typical Duck's Breath fish aliens.
