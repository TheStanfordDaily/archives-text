# 'Star Trek III' – The Search for Schlock
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
As an actor, Leonard Nimoy has no dramatic
sensibility; he gives every line of dialogue equal
weight and seems unaware of other actors, as it he
were encased in glass. I've never believed, like
some of my Trekkie friends, that this was an act
ing choice cannily suited to the alien, unemotional
Mr. Spock. In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,
where under Nicholas Meyer's warm direction
even the stolid William Shatner managed to give a
performance, Nimoy was almost as disconnected
as usual, and in the newest sequel, subtitled The
Search for Spock, he offers his typical out-of
whack performance, only this time from the direc
tor's chair. (Star Trek II killed off Spock; as Part
III begins, his body lies in a coffin on Genesis, a
planet created as an experiment in regeneration.)
Scenes of emotional confusion and distress are
played out and then dismissed as if they had never
occurred; if you tried to recount the story, it
would make more sense than it does while you're
watching it, because you would naturally supply
the dramatic accents Nimoy leaves off. (You get
the feeling Nimoy hasn't grasped the logic or the
flaw of the story — that he's still waiting for some
one to walk him through it.) The script Harve
Bennett supplied contains more than its share of
bargain basement dialogue, but it sets up one big
scene after another — Dr. McCoy's (DeForest
Kelley) nervous breakdown, which turns out to be
a manifestation of the psychic connection Spock
forged with him before his death; the "stealing"
of the Enterprise, under the command of James
Kirk (William Shatner), to return to Genesis to
recover Spock's body and transport it to Vulcan;
the attack on the Enterprise by a Klingon ship;
the destruction of Genesis due to an error in its
creation — which, though they may require un
questioning devotion well beyond the usual will

ing suspension of disbelief, nonetheless indicate a
quota of exciting adventure. But Nimoy is worse
than a klutz; he doesn't seem to register the possi
bility for drama.
The Search for Spock squeaks by for the first
half hour on the good will The Wrath of Khan
built up, but that fades out when you realize that
no one with either wit or taste exerted any control
over the project. The death of one of the major
characters is shockingly mishandled, as if Nimoy
simply forgot to place the camera where it could
pick up the incident and then cut away in embar
rassment as quickly as possible. At that point you
begin to enjoy the dumb picture for its colossal in
eptitude — for the vintage Republic Pictures look
of the disintegrating planet (1 looked around for
the wind machine) and the general absurdity of
the mystical Vulcan finish. Dame Judith Ander
son, wearing inch-long false eyelashes and a red
helmet with what appears to be an IV tube run
ning from its tip. plays the high priestess who
speaks in biblical English phrases and then
switches into high-toned gibberish (said to be
Vulcan) when the religious service commences.
It's amusing to hear that richly cadenced voice,
familiar to us as Mrs. Danvers' or Lady Mac
beth's, wrapped around artificial language that
might have clunked happily through any Maria
Montez film. Someone (Marc Okrand) actually
receives mention tor making up the "alien lan
guage" — he must have devised the Klingon
tongue, too. But my favorite end credit is "Special
Makeup Appliances Created by The Burman
Studio," a reference to (mostly) the Klingon
foreheads, which have so much latex piled on
them that the poor actors' eyes are swimming. (In
retribution, perhaps, they respond with deadly
performances.) Unfortunately, you don't believe
for a minute that any of the humor in The Search
for Spock is intentional — even in the credits.
