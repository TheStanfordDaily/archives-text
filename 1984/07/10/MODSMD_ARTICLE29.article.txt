Washington — A Soviet delegation is scheduled
to arrive here tomorrow to complete an agreement
with the United States to modernize the so-called
hot line communication links between the Kremlin
and the White House, according to officials in both
governments.
The technical negotiations, which began a year
ago, got caught up in the general freezing of rela
tions following deployment of U.S. missiles in West
ern Europe in December.
If agreement is reached this week, U.S. sources
said yesterday, it would mark another sign that the
two superpowers have begun to move ahead on
some issues that had been stalled for the last six
months.
I he hot line system s slow, 67-words-a-minute
teletypewriters, which have been used to head off
misunderstandings in several past crises, are to be
supplemented in both Washington and Moscow with
new high-speed equipment that can send "pictures,
graphics and a whole page of prepared text ... in a
second." a State Department official said.
