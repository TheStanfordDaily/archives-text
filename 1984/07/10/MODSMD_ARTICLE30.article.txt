### 
Beirut, Lebanon — Beirut's airport reopened yes
terday tor the first time in five months, hut protest
ing families of eivil war hostages blocked access
roads to the airport and the crossings between the
capital's Moslem and Christian sectors.
The protests stalled the six-day-old plan to
reunite Beirut, stabilize the cease-fire and introduce
reforms aimed at power-sharing between Christians
and Moslems to end a nine-year civil war.
I he protesters — most ot them women with
pictures of missing persons pinned to their clothes —
are demanding the release of people taken captive
by various militias during the civil war.
The Lebanese army, which assumed control of
Beirut last week under a Syrian-backed security

plan to end the rule of warring militias, made no
move against the demonstrators. Some armed
militiamen were seen helping the demonstrators.
