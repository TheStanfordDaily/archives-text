# Reagan begins tour

Washington â€” President Reagan sets out today
on a political damage-control mission directed at a
persistent trouble spot of his presidency: environ
mental policy.
In a series of campaign-style appearances this
week on Chesapeake Bay, at Theodore Roosevelt
Island here and at Mammoth Cave National Park in
Kentucky, Reagan is trying once again to lay to rest
what polls show to he public skepticism of his hand
ling of environmental protection.
White House strategists think they defused what
could have been a major Reagan campaign liability
with the resignation last year of former Interior Sec
retary James Watt and the earlier departure under
pressure of Environmental Protection Agency chief
Anne Burford.
But the environmental issue continues to be a
nagging political ditticulty for Reagan, aggravated
last week when the White House announced Bur
lord s reappointment to an advisory panel on oceans
and the atmosphere.
