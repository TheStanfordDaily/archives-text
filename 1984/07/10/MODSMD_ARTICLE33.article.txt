# NASA may combine flight

### 
Washington — NASA is considering a plan to
combine the 12th and 13th missions of the space
shuttle as a way to avoid expensive delays that could
push at least one mission scheduled for 1984 into
next year.
Sources at the space agency said they expect a
decision sometime this week on whether to res
chedule the aborted 12th mission for late in July,
move the 13th mission forward from its planned
Aug. 29 launch date or combine the two missions
and fly Discovery into orbit on its maiden voyage on
Aug. 29.
The question of combining missions came up last
weekend when technicians at NASA's engine test
facility at Bay St. Louis, Miss, were unable to dupli
cate the failure of Discovery's starboard engine that
aborted its maiden flight last month. Until NASA
understands what went wrong, another launch can
not be scheduled, one source said.
