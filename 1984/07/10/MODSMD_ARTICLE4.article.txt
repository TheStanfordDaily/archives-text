# Prof. Manley advises Mondale to 'hit hard'
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
"Walter Mondale has one
chance and one chance only to
win the Presidency in Novem
ber: he must run a center-left
campaign like Franklin
Roosevelt in 1936 and Harry
Truman in 1948 And he must,
above all, do it aggressively."
The above passage is the in
troduction to a letter Political
Science Prof. John Manley sent
to former vice president Walter
Mondale last week, advising the
probable Democratic presiden
tial nominee about strategy for
the upcoming campaign against
President Reagan.
Manley, well-known on
campus as a leader of the cam
paign for a review of the role of
the Hoover Institution and for
teaching classes on the impact of
class and pluralist policies in
U.S. history, sent the letter to
Mondale in an attempt to spell
out the issues which Manley
believes will mobilize key
groups of voters that Mondale
must.have to defeat Reagan:
"workers, women, blacks,
Hispanics, and the young."
Manley spent many years in
Washington before coming to
Stanford and met Mondale
during that period. He supports
a Mondale presidency and
taught one of the two classes
originally invited to Mondale's
scheduled speech at Stanford
before it was canceled in early
June.
"If the aggressive center-left
strategy is adopted by Mondale,
there arc two issues that have
the potential to elect him: the
issue of fairness and the issue of
fear," Manley asserted.
The letter called on Mondale
to avoid relying on Reagan's
well-concealed mistakes and the
country's economic problems to
be elected. Instead, he should
play on the "polarization ot the
rich and poor, black and white,
labor and management,"
quoting Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-

Ark.), and on the idea that
"Ronald Reagan is dangerous."
"In a time of party decom
position, party I.D. is of declin
ing importance, but more
people still identity themselves
as Democrats than
Republicans," Manley wrote.
"The way to motivate Demo
cratic partisans to vote is to
remind them of what made
them Democrats in the first
place, and there is no better way
to do this than to attack the up
per class and interest biases of
the Republicans."
Manley ended his letter with
five specific recommendations.
First, he suggested, "Mondale
must be the aggressor. When he
did this to Gary Hart, it paid
off. . . Mondale must assume
control of this election from the
start. Attack, attack, attack."
"Second, stress the issues that
dramatize the differences be
tween the parties. Issues of
class, of fairness, and of equity
are Reagan's weakspots, he
feels defensive here — hit
hard."
In addition, Manley feels
Mondale should emphasize that
Reagan's economic policies did
not bring down unemployment,
and that an important reason for
the gender gap is the fear that
the president may lead the na
tion into war.
"Behind that nice smile is a
Strangelove," Manley wrote.
Finally, he suggested shar
pening the party platform and
picking a running mate who will
appeal to the left. He recom
mended Rep. Pat Schroedcr (D-
Colo.), a co-chair of the Hart
campaign, because "she's lett,
she's from the west, she will ap
peal to women, and she's smart
enough to handle the job."
For the platform, he recom
mends "reviving FDR's 1944
economic bill of rights."
"Walter Mondale has one
