## Discusses Jackson's trip, Soviets, abortion 
### 
Washington — President Reagan, who last
week questioned the legality of Jesse Jackson s
trip to Cuba, said yesterday that "I don t think
there's been any evidence" that Jackson broke
the law in his efforts to win the release of 4S
Cuban and American prisoners.
The White House also moved yesterday to
calm another potential campaign squall by an
nouncing that the president has ' no plans this
year or in a second term for "any changes in
Social Security. Presidential spokesman Larry
Speakes issued the statement after Reagan last
week predicted that some inequities in the sys
tem — dealing with the taxes paid and the
benefits received by young people — should be
corrected "in the coming years."
In an interview taped last week tor Honda
television stations, Reagan criticized Jackson's
trip and brought up the 185-year-old Logan
Act, which prohibits private citizens from car
rying out unauthorized diplomacy with other
nations.
At a luncheon for editors and broadcasters
from the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states yes
terday, Reagan was asked whether Jackson s
trip might be a "signal" for future candidates
to attempt such personal diplomacy without
fear of prosecution.
Reagan said his remark about the Logan Act
last week "suggested I was astray on that. He
added, "The Logan Act is very specific and 1
was only calling attention to the fact that there
is such a thing, and that private citizens cannot
go and literally try to negotiate terms and ar
rangements with foreign governments.
"1 don't think there is any evidence of that

being broken by Rev. Jackson, Reagan said.
The president said he was "grateful" for
Jackson's efforts to win the release of
prisoners, including his mission to Syria last
winter to free Navy flier Robert Goodman Jr.
"I know it's something I couldn't have done of
ficially," Reagan said of the Syrian effort.
Reagan told the editors and broadcasters
that while he has shown "again and again" that
he remains "unshakeably determined to sup
port freedom . . ~ we're also eager and willing
to negotiate genuine and verifiable arms
reductions" with the Soviets. He said "we con
tinue to hope" that the Soviets will agree to
talks this fall, "as they themselves first suuges
ted, to discuss the control of weapons in space
and, we hope, on earth as well."
When questioned "when and how" he in
tended to "protect the rights of the unborn,"
the president said:
I still have to leel that the Constitution
already protects the unborn, unless and until
someone can prove that the unborn child is not
a living human being. And after months of
hearings before committees in the Congress,
no one could prove that.
"Now, it any one ot us came upon a body
and we couldn't determine whether it was
living or dead, we certainly wouldn't bury it
until someone proved to us it should have been
buried. And I feel that one of the great moral
sins that is violating our very constitutional
guarantee — a right to life — is now prevalent
in abortion on demand."
