# Bonner faces trial for anti-Soviet acts

London (AP) â€” Yelena
Bonner, wife of Soviet dissi
dent Andrei Sakharov, is to
be put on trial for "anti-
Soviet behavior," The Sun
day Express of London re
ported.
The newspaper, citing uni
dentified "informed sources
in Moscow," said prelimi
nary proceedings already had
begun against Bonner in
Gorky, 240 miles east of
Moscow, where Sakharov
has been in internal exile for
four years.
The Sunday Express said
Bonner is accused of keeping
in touch with Western jour
nalists during her husband's
exile to keep his cause alive.
The Express did not spell out
what article of the Soviet
criminal code would be used
to try Bonner.
On May 6, Irina Kristi, a
friend of Bonner's, told The
Associated Press that Bon
ner had told her she was
being investigated under an
article of the Soviet criminal
code that prohibits "anti-
Soviet slander and agita
tion."
The Sunday Express said
that "the new crackdown on
the Sakharovs, if it goes
ahead, will signal a brutal
Russian snub for the West's

hopes of cooperation be
tween the superpowers."
There was no immediate
official Soviet comment.
Sakharov, a renowned nu
clear physicist and winner of
the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize,
has been barred from contact
with the West since he was
banished to Gorky, a city
closed to foreigners, in Janu
ary 1980.
He dropped from public
view in early May. Friends
and relatives said he had
gone on a hunger strike to
press a demand that the So
viet government allow his
wife to seek medical treat
ment in the West. This led to
unconfirmed reports that the
Soviet Union's best-known
human rights dissident, who
has a heart condition, had
died.
The Kremlin denied that
recently. It said Sakharov
was healthy and eating, but
did not provide proof or al
low Westerners to see him.
The plight of Sakharov
and other dissidents in the
Soviet Union was brought up
by French President Francois
Mitterrand and British
Foreign Secretary Sir Geof
frey Howe in official visits to
the Kremlin in the past two
weeks.
