## Todd Pilch Drifting through Hemingway's shadow 
### 
i am not a man. nor a boy. As a mem
ber of the vast group of "in-betweens"
groping along the path to manhood, this
column seems the appropriate place to
air my thoughts. At this stage in my life,
floundering in a sea of uncertainty, I find
myself searching for answers in men's
magazines and books. It annoys me to no
end when another writer offers his in
sights into what it means to be a man. My
maturation has seemingly ended, stunted
and confused by a glut of elderly gents
bombarding me with assorted maxims.
"Son, what you should do . . . " When
will it be my turn to deal out advice?
As one who has chosen a path shel
tered by academia, I am told that my
metamorphosis into an adult will be
delayed. Some say that if I was working,
supporting a family, paying bills, then I
would know what it meant to be a man. I
can neither accept nor reject these
claims. My dilemma stems from confu
sion, manifested by the accumulation of
impressions. These indelible impressions
have amassed over many years. Perhaps
it is manly to admit confusion.
The first time anyone incorrectly ad
dressed me as a man was during the sup
posedly deeply religious and moving ex
perience of my bar mitzvah. My religious
ceremony took a back seat to the gaiety
and hoopla of the reception: a ten-piece
band, waiters tossing salad to the accom
panying blare of trumpets, 250 relatives
and friends drunk. Amid the gaudy spec

tacle that was my bar mitzvah. Uncle Sol
slipped me a check along with the proph
etic statement, "Now you are a man "
Actually he was one of many that slipped
me checks and made similar statements.
What could they all mean? Physically,
1 was not a man, possessing a voice that
had a pitch somewhere up in the strato
sphere. Perhaps they thought that a man
was a bov who could stuff $3000 worth
of checks into his breast pocket and
boldly avert muggers? I was puny, im
mature, and only thirteen, vet addressed
as a man. Adding to the confusion, the
high-priced photographer kept on calling
me "big boy," while grandmother
repeatedly addressed me as her "good
little boy." The seeds of my dilemma
were planted that day.
During college I became a victim of a
mentality that equated manhood with
contact sports. As a result, rugby became
my next chosen path toward becoming a
man. I soured on this route after
numerous twisted knees, mashed digits,
and too many nights swathed in Ben-
Gay. 1 here was and still exists a certain
rough and manly feeling in playing this
cherished sport, but the cleat mark on
my left temple is a continual reminder
that this could not be the way all boys
become men.
My own father has often confused me
as much as anyone. He urges me to get
on with life because we are only given a

lew years to get our lifework done. He
lectures as if I am Luke and he is Yoda,
leaving me to wonder when he
developed this knowledge. Obviously he
was not espousing these ideas at 20, nor
did he possess the clairvoyance at 30.
When did he know?
Quite similarly, a doctor friend offered
advice to me once, while hunched over
his new home computer. After com
manding the Apple to update his stock
earnings, Dr. K. spun his chair around
and with a twinkle in his eye stated,
"You know, Todd, they say the differ
ence between men and boys is their toys.
Don't you agree?" I nodded but was
reminded of all mv high school acquain
tances hunched in similar fashion over
their computers. This was no criterion
tor manhood and once again 1 was lost in
a blur of contrasting thoughts.
For the past few years I have had a
routinely normal sex life except for one
isolated night. On that evening with
someone special, I learned that im
potence is not reserved exclusively for
older men. Although 1 joked about my
lack of performance, the unavoidable
fact was that I had failed. How could this
happen to me, a virile, athletic young
man at the peak of his sexual potency? I
felt as if the word impotent was forever
inscribed on my forehead. I was shat
tered and perplexed.
After college, I escaped to Florida and

immersed myself in literature. Perhaps it
was possible to become a character in a
novel and grow along with that charac
ter. Obviously 1 was getting desperate to
grab on to something, an idea, a feeling
... I am not quite sure. After wading
through just about every Hemingway
novel, I chose to be like Hemingway
himself, strutting about, drunken, chest
thrown forward, and of course playing
rugbv again.
It seemed logical to go down to
Hemingway's house in Key West and
continue my quest. Nothing seemed bet
ter than to camp out in the town where a
real "man's man" lived, a womanizer,
the macho type. Within 20 minutes after
I arrived in Key West, I was surprised to
be approached by five or six
homosexuals. There were few
heterosexuals in the whole area. Locals
kindly informed me that today's Key
West was not quite the same town in
which Hemingway had written. Time had
sure changed Ernest's place.
Confusion. I can't offer answers.
Reflection and contemplation makes this
metamorphosis slow and painful. My
time will come.
Perhaps next year I will try windsurf
ing, or parachuting . . .
