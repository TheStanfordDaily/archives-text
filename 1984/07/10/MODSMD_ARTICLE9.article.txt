## USW contributing to Olympic demise 
### 
Enough is enough. For the
last year or so we've had to lis
ten to countless stories ol how
the Union and the University
can't get along. We've been sub
jected to more accusations and
political rhetoric than we will
see in the presidential race.
Newspaper articles contradict
each other. Informational let
ters only serve to confuse us
even more. The Stanford com-

Viewpoint

munity is left with trying to eval
uate the stories, separating fact
from emotional fantasy; and
forming opinions based on
whichever side sounds more
believable.
Through the last few months,
we've seen the union attempt to
solicit support from many
groups. We've seen the union
attempt to call attention to its
cause in many different ways.
But now the union has gone too
far. In the United Stanford
Workers leaflet dated June 28,
19N4, a calendar of events ap
pears. Reading through it, we
see various committee meetings,
a council meeting, a member
ship meeting and down at the
very bottom I see the most dis
gusting thing the union has ever
come up with. "July 2V — Sum -
mer Olympics at Stanford —
Opening Ceremonies Sunday
eve. (I lelp us expose Stanford's
abuse of human rights before
the international community)''
It seems that the union has
really hit bottom. Ever since the
disaster at the Munich Olym
pics, the world has had to live
with the fact that political differ
ences play an overly important
role in the Olympic Games.
We've seen demonstrations,
protests, terrorist attacks, and
boycotts. If the USW plans any
official presence whatsoever,
they are contributing to the
demise of the Olympic Games,
which are already on very shaky
ground. Mow dare you consider
yourselves victims of human

rights violations. People all
around the world are being
murdered, tortured, kidnapped,
and imprisoned. How dare you
consider this labor dispute a
human rights issue. Especially in
the eyes of the international
community. Furthermore, who
are you trying to fool? Do you
really believe that some meager
demonstration or rally will have
any effect on anyone? By the
time the people reach the ticket
booth, the cause will be forgot
ten. The only thing that will
linger is the embarrassment we
will all have to live with. It is an
honor for Stanford to host the
Olympic Games. USW is trying
to make a mockery of it. To
have any kind of rally or
demonstration, the USW would
be lowering itself to the level of
the self-serving political or ter
rorist groups that have nearly
caused an end to the Games.
1 know the way the Union
works. For this to appear in the
USW newsletter, it had to have
been discussed by some group
of people. I'm astounded that
the union administration would
even consider this. So much so,
that I never want to be associ
ated with it again. This is a for
mal statement of disassociation
trom USW. In this way, perhaps
we can retain a little dignity in
the lace ot so much absurdity.
1 he boycotts of the Olympic
Games have been tragic. But
now I'm calling for one. We are
calling for every USW member
to boycott the demonstration or
rally that USW is planning.
