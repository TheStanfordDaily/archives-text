## EXTRA Mondale to announce Ferraro as V.P. 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Walter
Mondale has selected Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.) to
be his running mate, a senior
aide to Mondale disclosed late
yesterday. Mondale was to an
nounce his choice in Minnesota
at 10 a.m. PDT today.
If the Democratic National
Convention confirms his choice,
Ferraro would become the first
woman vice presidential candi
date on a major party ticket.
She represents a blue collar dis
trict of Oueens in New York.
The 48-year-old congres
swoman could not be reached,
but a well-placed Mondale aide,
who would not be identified,
said the decision came during
the day yesterday in Minnesota
where Mondale has been
secluded for days.
Rep. Ferraro was extremely
upbeat during an evening ap
pearance but gave reporters no
hint of her selection.
Mondale will make his choice
known today at the Minnesota
State Capitol, the site where he
launched his own presidential
campaign more than a year ago,
Johnson said.

The decision capped a process
that was criticized by many
Democrats, but that Mondale
himself used to emhpasize his
decision to give serious consid
eration to a black, woman or
Hispanic running mate for the
first time.
Two vice presidential
finalists, Mayors Dianne
Feinstein of San Francisco and
Henry Cisneros of San Antonio,
Texas, said they were not
Mondale's choice. Mayor Tom
Bradley of Los Angeles could
not be reached and Massachu
setts Gov. Michael Dukakis
simply said he was flattered to
have been considered.
Mondale had dispatched a
key aide, John Reilly, to this
convention city to meet with
Ferraro. Reilly talked to the 48-
year-old New York congres
swoman after Tuesday night's
Major League All Star game
and then returned to Minnesota.
"Reilly's visit with Ferraro
was not cosmetic," said one
source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. "It was very
detailed. I get the feeling

Mondale is in a gambling
mood."
In addition, sources disclosed
that another top Mondale aide,
Michael Berman, met recently
with Ferraro's husband,
developer John /.accaro.
Mondale's top aides briefed
reporters in Minnesota yester
day evening and said the noon
announcement — they would
not disclose a name — would be
followed by a rally in Mondale's
hometown tomorrow and a
weekend retreat in Lake Tahoe,
Calif., en route to the conven
tion next Monday.
"Earlier this evening vice
president Mondale came to a
decision as to who his running
mate will be in the 1984 cam
paign," campaign chairman
James Johnson told reporters at
the end of a long day of swirling
speculation.
It is practically unprece
dented for a presidential candi
date to complete his ticket
before his party's convention.
The Democrats convene Mon
day here and Mondale will
