## EXTRA Mondale to announce Ferraro as V.P. 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Walter
Mondale has selected Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.) to
be his running mate, a senior
aide to Mondale disclosed late
yesterday. Mondale was to an
nounce his choice in Minnesota
at 10 a.m. PDT today.
If the Democratic National
Convention confirms his choice,
Ferraro would become the first
woman vice presidential candi
date on a major party ticket.
She represents a blue collar dis
trict of Oueens in New York.
The 48-year-old congres
swoman could not be reached,
but a well-placed Mondale aide,
who would not be identified,
said the decision came during
the day yesterday in Minnesota
where Mondale has been
secluded for days.
Rep. Ferraro was extremely
upbeat during an evening ap
pearance but gave reporters no
hint of her selection.
Mondale will make his choice
known today at the Minnesota
State Capitol, the site where he
launched his own presidential
campaign more than a year ago,
Johnson said.

The decision capped a process
that was criticized by many
Democrats, but that Mondale
himself used to emhpasize his
decision to give serious consid
eration to a black, woman or
Hispanic running mate for the
first time.
Two vice presidential
finalists, Mayors Dianne
Feinstein of San Francisco and
Henry Cisneros of San Antonio,
Texas, said they were not
Mondale's choice. Mayor Tom
Bradley of Los Angeles could
not be reached and Massachu
setts Gov. Michael Dukakis
simply said he was flattered to
have been considered.
Mondale had dispatched a
key aide, John Reilly, to this
convention city to meet with
Ferraro. Reilly talked to the 48-
year-old New York congres
swoman after Tuesday night's
Major League All Star game
and then returned to Minnesota.
"Reilly's visit with Ferraro
was not cosmetic," said one
source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. "It was very
detailed. I get the feeling

Mondale is in a gambling
mood."
In addition, sources disclosed
that another top Mondale aide,
Michael Berman, met recently
with Ferraro's husband,
developer John /.accaro.
Mondale's top aides briefed
reporters in Minnesota yester
day evening and said the noon
announcement — they would
not disclose a name — would be
followed by a rally in Mondale's
hometown tomorrow and a
weekend retreat in Lake Tahoe,
Calif., en route to the conven
tion next Monday.
"Earlier this evening vice
president Mondale came to a
decision as to who his running
mate will be in the 1984 cam
paign," campaign chairman
James Johnson told reporters at
the end of a long day of swirling
speculation.
It is practically unprece
dented for a presidential candi
date to complete his ticket
before his party's convention.

day here and Mondale will

/accaro and her top aide
were reported heading for Min
nesota. Reporters flocked to the
congresswoman's hotel here and
to the airport.
Ferraro said she talked about
personal matters such as her
family, her health and her
finances in a 90-minute meeting
with Mondale aide John Reilly
yesterday night.
"If selected, 1 will work very
hard for the campaign," Ferraro
told reporters before a speech,
/accaro said he was asked whe
ther he could supply detailed
financial information on short
notice.
Campaign rivals Gary Hart
and Jesse Jackson were
eliminated. Mondale cited
"substantial differences" be
tween him and Jackson.
"I intend to pick the best per
son I can find, who's compati
ble, whose selection speaks for
my vision of our future, and
there are sufficient differences
between the Rev. Jackson and
myself that I can't do that,"
Mondale told CBS News.
An aide, Maxine Isaacs, said
the differences include Jack
son's call for a Palestinian

homeland and a reduction in the
defense budget.
The aide also said Mondale
considers some of Jackson's
recent statements to be "quite
offensive," an apparent Prefer
ence to his complaints that
Mondale was bowing to pres
sure from Jewish leaders in not
considering him for the vice
presidential post.
Earlier yesterday Hart had
told ABC News, "I would do it
if asked, not because it would
make political sense, but be
cause it would be the nominee's
judgment and, hopefully, that of
the party that I would add
something to the ticket and,
hopefully, beat President
Reagan."
It was his most positive state
ment on the subject to date,
coming just 24 hours after he
vowed not to quit his challenge
to Mondale for the nomination.
It is unusual for a vice
presidential choice to be
decided before the convention.
Eight years ago, a struggling
candidate named Ronald
Reagan attempted to boost his
chances for the Republican
nomination by announcing his
choice of moderate Sen. Rich
ard Schweicker. Reagan lost
anyway, to incumbent President
Ford.
Four years ago, Reagan
waited until the night of his own
nomination before choosing
Bush over Ford for the No. 2
spot.

ence to his complaints that
Mondale was bowing to pres
sure from Jewish leaders in not
considering him for the vice
presidential post.
Earlier yesterday Hart had
told ABC News, "I would do it
if asked, not because it would
make political sense, but be
cause it would be the nominee's
judgment and, hopefully, that of
the party that I would add
something to the ticket and,
hopefully, beat President
Reagan."
It was his most positive state
ment on the subject to date,
coming just 24 hours after he
vowed not to quit his challenge
to Mondale for the nomination.
It is unusual for a vice
presidential choice to be
decided before the convention.
Eight years ago, a struggling
candidate named Ronald
Reagan attempted to boost his
chances for the Republican
nomination by announcing his
choice of moderate Sen. Rich
ard Schweicker. Reagan lost
anyway, to incumbent President
Ford.
Four years ago, Reagan
waited until the night of his own
nomination before choosing
Bush over Ford for the No. 2
spot.
San Francisco (AP) — Walter
Mondale has selected Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.) to
be his running mate, a senior
aide to Mondale disclosed late
yesterday. Mondale was to an
nounce his choice in Minnesota
at 10 a.m. PDT today.
If the Democratic National
Convention confirms his choice,
Ferraro would become the first
woman vice presidential candi
date on a major party ticket.
She represents a blue collar dis
trict of Oueens in New York.
The 48-year-old congres
swoman could not be reached,
but a well-placed Mondale aide,
who would not be identified,
said the decision came during
the day yesterday in Minnesota
where Mondale has been
secluded for days.
Rep. Ferraro was extremely
upbeat during an evening ap
pearance but gave reporters no
hint of her selection.
Mondale will make his choice
known today at the Minnesota
State Capitol, the site where he
launched his own presidential
campaign more than a year ago,
Johnson said.

The decision capped a process
that was criticized by many
Democrats, but that Mondale
himself used to emhpasize his
decision to give serious consid
eration to a black, woman or
Hispanic running mate for the
first time.
Two vice presidential
finalists, Mayors Dianne
Feinstein of San Francisco and
Henry Cisneros of San Antonio,
Texas, said they were not
Mondale's choice. Mayor Tom
Bradley of Los Angeles could
not be reached and Massachu
setts Gov. Michael Dukakis
simply said he was flattered to
have been considered.
Mondale had dispatched a
key aide, John Reilly, to this
convention city to meet with
Ferraro. Reilly talked to the 48-
year-old New York congres
swoman after Tuesday night's
Major League All Star game
and then returned to Minnesota.
"Reilly's visit with Ferraro
was not cosmetic," said one
source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. "It was very
detailed. I get the feeling

Mondale is in a gambling
mood."
In addition, sources disclosed
that another top Mondale aide,
Michael Berman, met recently
with Ferraro's husband,
developer John /.accaro.
Mondale's top aides briefed
reporters in Minnesota yester
day evening and said the noon
announcement — they would
not disclose a name — would be
followed by a rally in Mondale's
hometown tomorrow and a
weekend retreat in Lake Tahoe,
Calif., en route to the conven
tion next Monday.
"Earlier this evening vice
president Mondale came to a
decision as to who his running
mate will be in the 1984 cam
paign," campaign chairman
James Johnson told reporters at
the end of a long day of swirling
speculation.
It is practically unprece
dented for a presidential candi
date to complete his ticket
before his party's convention.

/accaro and her top aide
were reported heading for Min
nesota. Reporters flocked to the
congresswoman's hotel here and
to the airport.
Ferraro said she talked about
personal matters such as her
family, her health and her
finances in a 90-minute meeting
with Mondale aide John Reilly
yesterday night.
"If selected, 1 will work very
hard for the campaign," Ferraro
told reporters before a speech,
/accaro said he was asked whe
ther he could supply detailed
financial information on short
notice.
Campaign rivals Gary Hart
and Jesse Jackson were
eliminated. Mondale cited
"substantial differences" be
tween him and Jackson.
"I intend to pick the best per
son I can find, who's compati
ble, whose selection speaks for
my vision of our future, and
there are sufficient differences
between the Rev. Jackson and
myself that I can't do that,"
Mondale told CBS News.
An aide, Maxine Isaacs, said
the differences include Jack
son's call for a Palestinian

homeland and a reduction in the
defense budget.
The aide also said Mondale
considers some of Jackson's
recent statements to be "quite
offensive," an apparent Prefer
ence to his complaints that
Mondale was bowing to pres
sure from Jewish leaders in not
considering him for the vice
presidential post.
