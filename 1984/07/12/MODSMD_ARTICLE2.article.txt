### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
San Francisco â€” Barely an hour after learning
Walter Mondale had selected her as the Demo
cratic nominee for vice president, Rep. Geraldine
Ferraro spoke to the World Affairs Council of
Northern California and gave no hints of her se
lection.
Ferraro delivered her prepared text on foreign
policy, attacking the Reagan administration and
praising all three Democratic presidential con
tenders.
Mondale reportedly reached his decision at 4
p.m. PDT, then notified Ferraro at 4:30.
The three-term Democratic congresswoman
from New York City looked nervous, but in good
spirits when she appeared in the ballroom of the
St. Francis Hotel to deliver her speech 75 minutes
later.
She coyly avoided giving away her secret, and at
one point praised San Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein and Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Col
lins, the two other women most frequently men
tioned as possible vice presidential candidates.
The only hint of her selection for the national
ticket came during the question and answer per
iod that followed.
When told that Cable News Network had an
nounced that the list of potential vice-presidential

candidates had been narrowed to herself and Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.), she said, "I think that's ter
rific. I'm going to go home and call my husband
and my mother."
Earlier, she responded to questions about the
gender issue in presidential politics this year.
"Why is there so much talk about a woman vice
presidential candidate?" asked World Affairs
Council President Max Thelen. "In this en
lightened age, should we not be more concerned
about the candidate's qualifications rather than
gender?"
"Who's the nasty person who said that?" Fer
raro retorted, to laughter from the audience.
"You have to look at it this way," she said.
"Who's kidding who?"
She repeated herself, then said, "I should do a
Joan Rivers here and say, 'Let's talk.'
'I want to tell you something," she said. "When
I graduated from law school in 1960 and applied
for jobs, 1 applied at one of the most prestigious
Wall Street law firms.
"I went through five job interviews and after
the fifth interview, the guy said to me, 'Gee, I'm
terribly sorry. You're wonderful, but we're just
not hiring any women this year.' I was excluded
from that job because of gender.
