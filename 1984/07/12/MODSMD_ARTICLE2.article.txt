# Ferraro sits on secret during speech in City
## 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
San Francisco — Barely an hour after learning
Walter Mondale had selected her as the Demo
cratic nominee for vice president, Rep. Geraldine
Ferraro spoke to the World Affairs Council of
Northern California and gave no hints of her se
lection.
Ferraro delivered her prepared text on foreign
policy, attacking the Reagan administration and
praising all three Democratic presidential con
tenders.
Mondale reportedly reached his decision at 4
p.m. PDT, then notified Ferraro at 4:30.
The three-term Democratic congresswoman
from New York City looked nervous, but in good
spirits when she appeared in the ballroom of the
St. Francis Hotel to deliver her speech 75 minutes
later.
She coyly avoided giving away her secret, and at
one point praised San Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein and Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Col
lins, the two other women most frequently men
tioned as possible vice presidential candidates.
The only hint of her selection for the national
ticket came during the question and answer per
iod that followed.
When told that Cable News Network had an
nounced that the list of potential vice-presidential

candidates had been narrowed to herself and Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.), she said, "I think that's ter
rific. I'm going to go home and call my husband
and my mother."
Earlier, she responded to questions about the
gender issue in presidential politics this year.
"Why is there so much talk about a woman vice
presidential candidate?" asked World Affairs
Council President Max Thelen. "In this en
lightened age, should we not be more concerned
about the candidate's qualifications rather than
gender?"
"Who's the nasty person who said that?" Fer
raro retorted, to laughter from the audience.
"You have to look at it this way," she said.
"Who's kidding who?"
She repeated herself, then said, "I should do a
Joan Rivers here and say, 'Let's talk.'
'I want to tell you something," she said. "When
I graduated from law school in 1960 and applied
for jobs, 1 applied at one of the most prestigious
Wall Street law firms.
"I went through five job interviews and after
the fifth interview, the guy said to me, 'Gee, I'm
terribly sorry. You're wonderful, but we're just
not hiring any women this year.' I was excluded
from that job because of gender.
"Now, when somebody says to me, 'Don't you
feel bad about all the attention you're getting?
Would you be getting it if you weren't female?'
Well, I have to tell you, I don't feel the least bit
badly about it."
At that point, Ferraro was interrupted by thun
derous applause.
She continued, "1 then asked that person, 'Do
you think that guy who got that job from me 24
years ago is walking around saying, Gee, 1
shouldn't have taken that job. It should have gone
to a woman. She was so qualified."
She continued, "I'm qualified. So is Dianne
Feinstein . . . and Martha Layne Collins. The wo
men who are being considered are capable.
"I'm delighted that there's no longer that big
sign outside that door of the office for vice presi
dent that says, 'white males only need apply.' "
The congresswoman was interrupted by ap
plause again, then declared, "It's our turn, folks."
As the audience applauded, she said, "I may
have just lost the job," implying that Mondale
might be offended by such demands.
Her prepared speech, entitled "A Democratic
Party View of U.S. Foreign Policy," was a forceful
attack on the Reagan administration and a call for
arms control measures and a foreign policy based
more on negotiations and less on foreign interven
tion.
"A Democratic Administration would reaffirm
the basic American values," Ferraro said. "We
will stand tor the principles of John Kennedy's
long twilight struggle: a struggle against "the com
mon enemies of man — tyranny, poverty, disease
and war itself."
She continued, "In our platform, we advocate a
comprehensive, mutual, and verifiable freeze on
the testing, production, and deployment of all nu
clear weapons. The world does not get safer with
new inventories of nuclear weapons and new tech
nological schemes to hurl the arms race into
space.
"It is time to reverse course, and the way to
start is by imposing mutual and verifiable
moratoria on the most dangerous new nuclear
weapons systems on the Reagan shopping list."
She continued, "It is time to stop building nu
clear bargaining chips, and start bargaining on a
freeze and reductions of nuclear weapons.
"Only in old Westerns do we shoot first and ask
questions later. The world is not the old West.
When I hear the president give the MX missile a
nickname — Peacekeeper — that U.S. Marshals
in the old West used for the Colt 45, I am con
cerned that he does not understand the difference
between those times and these."
She then praised Mondale, the likely Demo

cratic nominee, saying, "Because of his own deep
experience with issues of global security, Walter
Mondale's foreign policy will be as professional as
Ronald Reagan's foreign policy has been
amateurish."
Ferraro added, "It will stand in stark contrast to
the record of Ronald Reagan and the future he
promises."
Reagan, she said, "has replaced the quest for
nuclear arms control as a key component of na
tional security with a dangerous dash for nuclear
superiority.
"He has replaced traditional American respect
for international law with presidential actions that
flaunt the rule of law."
After pausing, she said, "Ronald Reagan does
not have a single foreign policy success to his
name. Where is his Camp David; where is his
Panama Canal Treaty; where is his nuclear arms
control agreement?"
Paraphrasing Reagan's famous line from his
1980 campaign debate with then-President Jimmy
Carter, she said, "Look around the world. Is the
situation in Europe, in the Middle East, Africa,
Central America any better than when he took of
fice?
"Are we really more secure? Except by the
standard of an administration that measures se
curity solely in terms of the size of the defense
budget, I would say we are not."
She closed her remarks with an outline of what
foreign policy would be like under a Mondale ad
ministration.
"We are for stronger conventional forces," she
said. "We are for improved military readiness."
But she also added, "Military power ought to
be our weapon of last resort."
Ferraro added, "As a mother and a Democrat,
as an American and legislator, I would welcome
an effort by this president to sit down with the
Soviets and repair the damage of four lost years.
But the record of this administration reflects the
life-long attitude of this president and the opposi
tion of his top advisers to arms control."
She concluded, "The Democratic platform of
fers a strategy for America that responds to the
fundamental dreams of the American people ... I
am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace
that makes life on earth worth living, the kind that
enables men and nations to grow and to hope and
to build a better life for their children."
During the question and answer session that
followed, Ferraro declared her opposition to
domestic content legislation, opposed Hart's at
tempt to bar deployment of U.S. forces in the Per
sian Gulf, and criticized the U.S. invasion of
Grenada.
In reference to the invasion of Grenada, she
spoke of her 20-year-old son, a student at Mid
dlcbury College, and said her foreign policy posi
tions are influenced by concern for his status as a
potential draftee.
