Jean Fetter, associate dean of
graduate studies and research,
has been named the University's
new dean of admissions, effec
tive Sept. 1, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy an
nounced Tuesday.
She succeeds Fred Hargadon,
who is leaving the position after
15 years to become senior vice
president of the College Board
in New York City.
Kennedy said Fetter is a per
son of "superb academic and
administrative accomplish
ments, who should have the im
mediate confidence and support
of this faculty."

At Stanford, Fetter served as
assistant to then-President
Richard Lyman between 1977
and 1980. She became an asso
ciate dean in 1980. From 1975
to 1977, she was associate direc
tor of the Center for Teaching
and Learning and the Lilly Pro
gram for Faculty Renewal.
Between 1966 and 1974 she
taught physics at San Jose State
University as a lecturer and
later as an assistant professor.
Kennedy said Fetter's "style
and emphasis will be different
from Fred Hargadon's, but they
share an enthusiastic affection
for Stanford undergraduates

and a solid commitment to the
excellence and diversity of our
student body. We are lucky to
have her."
Fetter said she felt "very
honored not only to be offered a
position of such challenge and
responsibility, but also to be the
successor to Fred Hargadon.
He'll be a tough, if not
impossible, act to follow in
many ways, He's made an ex
traordinary contribution to the
University.
"I'm going to do a lot of
looking and listening during the
first year," she said when asked
what changes she might make as
dean.
Provost Alberty Has tort, who
with Kennedy and Registrar
Sally Mahoney made up the
search committee for the new
dean, said Fetter was one of a
strong group of candidates both
from inside and outside Stan
ford who were considered for
the position.
Hastorf said she will be "an
absolutely superb dean of ad
missions and an outstanding
representative of this institu
tion. She epitomizes what we
mean by a liberal arts educa
tion," he added.
Fetter, 46, received her bac
helor's degree in physics in 1959
and a Ph.D. in solar physics in
1962 from Oxford University.
She studied st St. Hugh's Col
lege, where she was awarded the
Hurry Prize for best all-around
undergraduate. She earned her
bachelor's degree with first
class honors, and she wrote her
physics dissertation on "Sunspot
Velocity Fields."
At Oxford, she was awarded a
university prize, the Gladstone
Memoroial Travelling Fellow
ship, and she received the Rose
Sidgwik Fellowship, a joint
award from the British and
American Association of Uni
versity Women, to spend a year
as a Visiting Fellow at Harvard.
Fetter played varsity basket
ball at Oxford for three years,
serving as captain of the univer

sity team, and also played tennis
and hockey.
Fetter said the admissions
post is "going to be a steep
learning curve for me." But she
paid tribute to President
Emeritus Lyman and Gerald
Lieberman, dean of graduate
studies and research, from
whom she learned the art of
steep learning curves."
1 have learned such an in
credible amount from both of
them," she said. "That will
stand me in great stead on the
challenges ahead.
While I'm sorry to leave my
colleagues in graduate studies,
I'm looking forward to working
with talented and devoted ad
missions staff," she added.
"They have an incredible
responsibility to the institu
tion."
Lieberman said that Fetter
has a "great deal of understand
ing and compassion for students
and their needs. She will carry
this into her new position."
Part of her job as associate
dean for graduate studies and
research has been responsible
for coordinating the recruitment
of graduate minority students,
and she has been active recruit
ing women to study in science
and engineering fields.
Fetter often serves as a
hearing officer of student griev
ances. She has always "treated
students in a mature and fair
manner," Liebermann noted.
"It's a tribute to Stanford that
they chose to hire Jean in that
position. She'll be wonderful,"
he said.
Fetter has served as a fresh
man adviser since 1977. She
