# Mondale decision comes as surprise
## 
### BOB COHN Daily staff 
The apparent political lull
between Walter Mondale's
vice presidential media
fiesta, which ended last
week, and the Democratic
National Convention, which
opens in San Francisco next
week, was shattered late last
night when a senior Mondale
aide declared the former vice
president would announce
his running mate at 10 a.m.
today in Minnesota. NBC
News reported and the Asso
ciated Press later confirmed
that New York Congres
swoman Geraldine Ferraro
would share the ticket with
Mondale in November.
Journalists and political
experts have kept a close eye
on the entourage of potential
vice presidents who have
been parading through
Mondale's North Oaks,
Minn., home, but most did
not expect any announce
ment until the convention
began. Besides Ferraro, San
Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein, San Antonio
Mayor Henry Cisneros, Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Brad
ley, Texas Senator Lloyd
Bentsen, Philadelphia Mayor
Wilson Goode and Kentucky
Governor Martha Layne
Collins have all met with
Mondale about the job. In
addition, Mondale was said
to be interested in Colorado
Sen. and presidential candi
date Gary Hart, New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.
All three network news
programs reported during

last night's 11 p.m. newscasts
that Mondale would offi
cially announce his running
mate today. NBC re
ported that a Mondale aide
had disclosed Ferraro's iden
tity to the network, and that
Ferraro was at that moment
making her way to San Fran
cisco Airport, preparing to
catch a flight to Minneapolis.
The congresswoman was in
San Francisco to deliver a
speech at the St. Francis
Hotel on "A Democratic
Party View of U.S. Foreign
Policy."
The other networks played
it safer than NBC. On ABCs
Nightline, which airs nightly
at 11:30 p.m., host Ted Kop
pel traded insights and gossip
with ABCs North Oaks cor
respondent, who has been
following the vice
presidential candidate saga
for weeks. Neither corre
spondent would speculate on
the identity of the candidate
in the 10-minute via-satellite
dialogue.
Moments later, the Asso
ciated Press confirmed that
Ferraro was indeed the one.
Ferraro apparently spoke
at the St. Francis yesterday
only 75 minutes after
Mondale invited her to join
the ticket. Although she
delivered a rousing speech,
blasting President Reagan on
a number of issues and out
lining the Democrat's foreign
policy agenda, she never dis
closed the big news. She
spoke with characteristic
spunk and zeal, at times
brimming with excitement as
she began to speak faster and
faster with her street-smart
New York accent; neverthe
less, the thousand or so lis
teners in the hotel's Italian
Room could not have
suspected they had been lis
tening to a politician who
had been notified of her po

tential ascendancy only mo
ments before taking the
stage.
During the ensuing
question-and-answer ses
sion, Ferraro, who at that
point knew more about the
party's future than anyone
else in the large ballroom,
said, "I'm glad there's no
longer that big sign over the
vice president's door saying
'white males only need ap
ply/ "
