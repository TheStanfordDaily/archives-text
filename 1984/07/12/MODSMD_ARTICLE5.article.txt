## Michael Heath Ferraro is a political risk for Mondale 
### 
It seems Walter Mondale's well-publicized search for
a vice presidential running mate finally came to a close
and the result was announced before the opening of the
Democratic convention on July 16. However, the ver
dict o! the selection process itself came in some time
ago, and it appears that, rather than making him look
presidential, the VP search placed Mondale in a very
uncomtortable position. The process had been
criticized by rival Gary Hart as "pandering," and its
patchwork mixture of candidates with regard to eth
nicity and gender came close to fulfilling James Watt's
infamous remark of "one black, two Jews and a
cripple."
Besides being a source of embarrassment for party
officials, the publicity surrounding the selection process
appears to have restricted Mondale"s options due to
heightened expectations that he would select either a
female or a minority as a running mate. The selection of
a white male for the ticket would have risked possible
revolt by feminists and supporters of Jesse Jackson on
the convention floor, and would give his VP search the
appearance of a public relations charade. Thus, despite
the qualifications of Sens. Gary Hart, Lloyd Bentsen
and Dale Bumpers, the strongest contenders had to be
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro and Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley. My guess was that the eventual nod would go
to Bradley, and I still think that the Mondale staff may

have favored the L.A. mayor before the interview
process began.
Swaying a large proportion of America's indepen
dent voters to the Democratic Party is the key to
Mondale's future success and a massive minority voter
turnout in the general election could enable him to un
seat President Reagan this fall. To attract the middle
of-the-road block, the usual trend for liberal candidates
has been to choose a more conservative running mate
to provide an ideological "balance" to the overall
ticket. Unfortunately, indications are that the selection
of Ferraro for the VP position contradicts this priority.
Media attention will probably focus not on her
qualifications, but on the fact that she is a woman. Fol
lowing the threats of revolt made by the National Or
ganization for Women (NOW), the Mondale camp
must also fear that a female selection increases
Mondale's image as a prisoner to political pressure
trom support groups — an image which has hurt
Mondale among moderate Democrats during the pri
maries. Pressure for a minority vice president, however,
was not been nearly as strong. Such a selection would
have provided the ticket with a sense of independence
as well as progressiveness, and would have inspired the
support of the many voters registered as a result of the
Jesse Jackson campaign drive.
Mayor Bradley had emerged as the top minority can

didate, and his moderate low-key, manner would have
provided a stable contrast to the divisive theatrics oi
Jackson. Indeed, a recent Los Angeles Times report in
dicated that Mondale had already determined Bradk .
to he the top potential vote-getter among the vice
presidential candidates.
Indeed, if Mondale had not nominated a woman I
think he would have felt tremendous pressure to choose
a minority. It would have been his best way to prove his
sincertiy in efforts to break down political barriers.
As it turns out, Mondale's selection of Ferraro will
win the approval of both the feminists and Jackson
who had supported a woman candidate from the start
What he must now contend with, however, are the ac
cusations that he made his choice based on the
demands of NOW, who had pushed Ferraro as their top
candidate. The choice will inject greater emotion into
the campaign, much of it negative.
A recent NBC News poll indicates that support for
the ticket may drop as much as five percentage points
with a woman in the VP slot. And, as most pollsters will
attest, prejudice becomes more prevalent in the voting
booth than in public opinion surveys. Already trailing
Reagan by almost 20 points overall, Mondale may have
accomplished more as a candidate for office than he
ever will in the office itself. (Michael Heath is a junior
