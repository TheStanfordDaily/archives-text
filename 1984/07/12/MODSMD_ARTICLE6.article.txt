## Media can't ignore gay and lesbian march 
### 
On October 14, 1979, tour
members ot Stanford's gay com
munity unfurled the red, white
and lavender banner of the Clay
People's Union at Stanford
(GPI ) in Washington, D.C. and
joined I ()(),()()() other lesbians
and gay men in the first Na
tional March for (iav and Les-

Viewpoint

bian Rights. Openly gay San
Francisco Supervisor Harvey
Milk had called for the march
five months before he was mur
dered in 197(5.
The event marked the largest
gathering in history of gay men
and lesbians seeking redress of
grievances from our nation's
government, yet national media
largely downplayed or altoget
her ignored the march. Or
ganizers were thus frustrated in
their goal of bringing gay and
lesbian concerns to the center of
public debate and to the atten
tion of every American.
Stanford lesbians, gay men
and our friends have a new op
portunity this Sunday to join
with supporters from across the
country in demanding public ac
tion on issues crucial to the sur
vival and growth of our commu
nity and to the personal liberty
ot all|Our fellow citizens: A

second National March for Les
bian/Gay Rights will take place
in San Francisco, commencing
at the intersection of Castro and
Market Streets at 2 p.m. and
proceeding down Market to the
Moscone Center.
The march has been timed to
coincide with the Democratic
National Covention, but the
Democratic Party is not the ob
ject of protest; its platform com
mittee has adopted planks sup
porting virtually all of the goals
of the march. Rather, organizers
hope to attract the attention of
an estimated 14,000 media rep
resentatives who have des
cended on the City to covtjr the
convention.
Given San Francisco's reputa
tion as a mecca for gay men and
lesbians, most of these reporters
will be looking for a "queer
story" to tittilate readers and
viewers back home. The march
will almost unavoidably divert
much ol this coverage from
cheap sensationalism of the sort
exemplified by CBS's "Gay
Power, Gay Politics" (1979)
and its more recent "60
Minutes" feature on gay life
(1 953) to a consideration of the
national agenda advanced by
the lesbian and gay rights move
ment.
Marchers in San Francisco
will be pressing 12 demands.

arrived at through the consensus
of participating groups and
representing the core of the
struggle for lesbian and gay
rights:
• Immediate and massive
federal funding to end the AIDS
epidemic.
• An Executive Order prohibit
ing discrimination against les
bians and gay men in the federal
government, including military
positions and government con
tractors.
• Passage of the National Les
bian/Gay Rights Bill and broad
non-discriminatory legislation
at state and local levels.
• Enforcement of existing civil
rights legisation in society as a
whole, including within the gay
and lesbian community.
• I he right of women, regard
less of sexual orientation or eco
nomic status, to choose if and
when to bear children, as well as
the right to safe, legal and acces
sible abortion with freedom
from forced sterilization.
• An end to violent attacks
against gay and lesbian people.
• Elimination ot all immigration
and naturalization restrictions
and international human rights
violations against lesbian and
gay people.

• Repeal of all "sodomy" and
"solicitation" laws.
• Legal recognition and eco
nomic benefits for lesbian and
gay relationships equal to those
afforded to marital relation
ships.
• Elimination of all discrimina
tion against lesbians and gay
men in child custody, adoption
and visitation rights.
• Provision of necessary social
services for lesbian and gay
youth, seniors, the disabled,
prisoners and low-income
people and the increase to
above prior lev els of funding for
federal programs cut by the
Reagan administration.
The Gay and Lesbian Al
liance at Stanford (GLAS —
successor to GPU) has joined
dozens of other organizations
from across the nation, includ
ing the National Organization
for Women, the National Gay
Task Force, the National Asso

ciation of Business Councils and
the National Federation of Par
ents and Friends of Gays, in en
dorsing the march and its list of
demands. We particularly en
courage our non-gay friends to
join us in "voting with our feet"
for the simple justice and per
sonal freedom that should be
guaranteed to all Americans,
regardless of sexual orientation.
Marchers should arrive at
Castro Street by noon on Sun
day, July 15, to find a place in
the march order; individuals
need not join a contingent, but
GLAS invites all members of
the Stanford community to join
us with appropriate individual
placards behind the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
banner. Together we can again
make history, and this time we
will not be ignored.

ganizers were thus frustrated in
their goal of bringing gay and
lesbian concerns to the center of
public debate and to the atten
tion of every American.
Stanford lesbians, gay men
and our friends have a new op
portunity this Sunday to join
with supporters from across the
country in demanding public ac
tion on issues crucial to the sur
vival and growth of our commu
nity and to the personal liberty
ot all|Our fellow citizens: A

second National March for Les
bian/Gay Rights will take place
in San Francisco, commencing
at the intersection of Castro and
Market Streets at 2 p.m. and
proceeding down Market to the
Moscone Center.
The march has been timed to
coincide with the Democratic
National Covention, but the
Democratic Party is not the ob
ject of protest; its platform com
mittee has adopted planks sup
porting virtually all of the goals
of the march. Rather, organizers
hope to attract the attention of
an estimated 14,000 media rep
resentatives who have des
cended on the City to covtjr the
convention.
Given San Francisco's reputa
tion as a mecca for gay men and
lesbians, most of these reporters
will be looking for a "queer
story" to tittilate readers and
viewers back home. The march
will almost unavoidably divert
much ol this coverage from
cheap sensationalism of the sort
exemplified by CBS's "Gay
Power, Gay Politics" (1979)
and its more recent "60
Minutes" feature on gay life
(1 953) to a consideration of the
national agenda advanced by
the lesbian and gay rights move
ment.
Marchers in San Francisco
will be pressing 12 demands.

arrived at through the consensus
of participating groups and
representing the core of the
struggle for lesbian and gay
rights:
• Immediate and massive
federal funding to end the AIDS
epidemic.
• An Executive Order prohibit
ing discrimination against les
bians and gay men in the federal
government, including military
positions and government con
tractors.
• Passage of the National Les
bian/Gay Rights Bill and broad
non-discriminatory legislation
at state and local levels.
• Enforcement of existing civil
rights legisation in society as a
whole, including within the gay
and lesbian community.
• I he right of women, regard
less of sexual orientation or eco
nomic status, to choose if and
when to bear children, as well as
the right to safe, legal and acces
sible abortion with freedom
from forced sterilization.
• An end to violent attacks
against gay and lesbian people.
• Elimination ot all immigration
and naturalization restrictions
and international human rights
violations against lesbian and
gay people.

• Repeal of all "sodomy" and
"solicitation" laws.
• Legal recognition and eco
nomic benefits for lesbian and
gay relationships equal to those
afforded to marital relation
ships.
• Elimination of all discrimina
tion against lesbians and gay
men in child custody, adoption
and visitation rights.
• Provision of necessary social
services for lesbian and gay
youth, seniors, the disabled,
prisoners and low-income
people and the increase to
above prior lev els of funding for
federal programs cut by the
Reagan administration.
The Gay and Lesbian Al
liance at Stanford (GLAS —
successor to GPU) has joined
dozens of other organizations
from across the nation, includ
ing the National Organization
for Women, the National Gay
Task Force, the National Asso

ciation of Business Councils and
the National Federation of Par
ents and Friends of Gays, in en
dorsing the march and its list of
demands. We particularly en
courage our non-gay friends to
join us in "voting with our feet"
for the simple justice and per
sonal freedom that should be
guaranteed to all Americans,
regardless of sexual orientation.
Marchers should arrive at
Castro Street by noon on Sun
day, July 15, to find a place in
the march order; individuals
need not join a contingent, but
GLAS invites all members of
the Stanford community to join
us with appropriate individual
placards behind the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
banner. Together we can again
make history, and this time we
will not be ignored.
