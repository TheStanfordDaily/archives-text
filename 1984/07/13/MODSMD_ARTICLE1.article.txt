# Professors analyze Ferraro's impact
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
Stanford political scientists reacted
with both celebration and caution to the
selection of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro as
Walter Mondale's running mate yester
day.
In phone interviews yesterday after
noon, many professors said Ferraro's
nomination will lead to a more exciting
and enthusiastic campaign and a more
harmonious convention in the coming
weeks, while others pointed cautiously to
the reality of pollsters and sexism still ap
parent in many voting districts across the
nation.
"I'm ecstatic," said Berkeley and
Stanford Political Science lecturer Jen
nifer King. "I thought he had to pick a
woman to win. It was his only chance of
beating Reagan. It was an act with more
courage and vision and imagination than

is usually found in politics."
Most importantly, the choice added an
exciting twist to what might have been a
routine and predictable campaign.
"I think Mondale's strategy argued for
picking a woman," commmented Profes
sor John Manley, who recently wrote a
letter arguing for the selection of Rep.
Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.).
"She seems smart, quite articulate . . .
and she will be tested over the next few
weeks by all accounts of people," Man
ley said.
"He has generated a lot of enthusiasm
at a time when he must launch his cam
paign," Manley added. "He has also
added an enormous amount of forward
thrust in the beginning weeks of the cam
paign and the formation of a central
theme."
Professors Richard Brody and Hugh

Marshall both pointed to mixed poll
results and the next few weeks as crucial
to whether the choice will add support to
the Mondale candidacy.
"It's hard to tell what they say," Brodv
said of the polls. "It looks like a wash. A
small amount are turned on and a small
amount are turned off.
"Next week, she will get a lot of expo
sure. My guess is that it will be a net posi
tive gain. It certainly confounds notions
of Mondale as a tired ordinary candi
date."
Marshall was more skeptical. "It cer
tainly is a watershed in American his
tory," he said, but continued, "Mondale
is already ahead in terms of women. It
opens him up further to charges that he
knuckles under to pressure from special
interests. They (the National Organiza
tion for Women) threatened a floor fight

it he ended up choosing a man.
"One must question whether Fer
rraro's addition will significantly enhance
his win in November," said Deborah
Rhode, a professor at the Law School,
"which would have more of a major im
pact on this nation's policy on women."
But another professor said Ferraro will
significantly increase Mondale's chance
of winning election.
" 1 think that as far as the Ferraro nom
ination goes, it can't help but strengthen
his (Mondale's) image," said Diana Paul,
a professor of religious studies and lec
turer in feminist studies. "It will
strengthen it profoundly as far as women
voters go. She is obviously one of the
leading stars in women's political
forces."
Others expressed surprise at Ferraro's
selection.
"There is still a lot of sex discrimina
tion in the minds and hearts of people,"
agreed Law School Prof. Barbara Bab
cock. "It was a brave thing to do, and I
am excited that we may have come far
enough in this nation that Ferraro will
viewed as a plus if selected. I didn't think
it would happen in my lifetime."
Senior Research Associate Coit
Blacker also avoided predicting whether

Ferraro's selection would be a net plus or
minus for the Democratic ticket. "I'm
pleased," he said. "It's about time a wo
man was nominated for one of the two
highest political offices."
As for next week's convention, Fer
rarro's choice could make it more boring
or more exciting, depending on what you
look for in such an event.
According to political scientists,
Mondale's move may have eliminated
the possibility of a floor fight over the
nomination. Ferraro's selection may also
have multiplied the level of enthusiasm
for Mondale's campaign.
"It'll be a good show," predicted King.

"It'll be a party now, a celebration. It will
forestall any vicious moves against
Mondale. It will be hard to find fault with
him."
"I don't think Jackson will create splits
now. It is difficult for Mondale's oppo
nents not to look at the consequences of
opposing a ticket with a woman on it.
The party will become united behind
Mondale, and the election will become
exciting."
She believes this enthusiasm will con
tinue through November. "She is a win
ner politically and from New York, an
electorally important state. It will
rejuvenate interest in politics and in

crease interest to the point of a higher
turnout; women, young people, the ed
ucated ... He has made this election
very interesting and historically signifi
cant," she said. Large election turnouts
have traditionally helped Democratic
candidates.
In addition, the election will bring up
discussions of our own attitudes on sex
discrimination, according to Babcock.
"It's a step in the right direction,"
summed up Manley. "To me, it is so far
so good for Mondale as far as imple
menting a strategy with a chance at win
ning."
