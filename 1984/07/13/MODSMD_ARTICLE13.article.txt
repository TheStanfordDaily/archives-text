## Katz links zinc deficiency to anorexia 
### LYDIA ROBINSON 
The chief symptom is shock
ing; self-starvation followed by
weight loss. The treatment is
difficult, the cure elusive, and
the facts about the disease are
not well known.
Dr. Rebecca Katz, a fellow in
adolescent medicine, began a
study in February at the
Children's Hospital at Stanford,
to determine if zinc deficiencies
in anorexic adolescents per
petuate the illness.
"Many studies on anorexia
nervosa devote a lot of time to
the psychological aspects." said
Katz. "Although it is important
to focus on these areas, we're
devoting time to the physiologi
cal aspects as well."
There are several similarities
between zinc deficient teenagers
and anorexics Both conditions
are characterized by weight loss,
growth retardation, loss of ap
petite, lack of menstrual periods
in females, mood changes, and
hair and skin abnormalities.
The trace element zinc is es
sential for normal growth and
development. It has a diverse
function in protein and carbohy
drate metabolism.
"Right now I'm frustrated be
cause we've hit a low point in
recruitments. I'm reaching out
to the people in this community
for help in this study," Katz
said.

Katz needs 29 more anorexic
adolescents to make her re
search project complete. Eleven
subjects, all under the age of 21,
are currently enrolled in the
study.
After an initial examination
and series of tests, each individ
ual will be asked to take a tablet
daily for a six-month period.
Follow-up examinations will be
v conducted on a monthly basis.
"This study is a double blind
research project," Katz said. "It
is important that the inves
tigator be blinded with the
patients to avoid any prejudg
ments," she added.
Neither Katz nor the patients
know what type ot pill they are
receiving. The pharmacist at the
hospital, Rick Bross, is the only
person who knows which
patients receive zinc tablets and
which receive placebos.
No one knows what causes
anorexia nervosa. Fear of fat,
the enormous emphasis on fas
hion and slimness through tele
vision, magazines, and movies,
and a conviction of feeling help
less to change anything are just
a few of the possible explana
tions.
Whatever the cause, the in
formation gained from this
study may help to care tor
patients with anorexia, said
Katz. "There are important im
plications for the treatment of

the disease if the theory proves
correct," she added.
The children who are already
enrolled in the study are react
ing in a positive way. They tind
it interesting and enjoy it, Katz
said. They feel they're helping
to contribute to information
about the disease.
The study is funded by the
Robert Wood Johnson General
Pediatrics Development Pro
gram. The main objective ot the
fellowship is to train people in
academic medicine
Adolescent medicine is a
recent phenomenon. During the
past 10 years, pediatric depart
ments have been establishing
that teenagers have their own
problems, different from those
of younger children. Doctors
are now being trained as
specialists in the field.
Katz began her two-year fel
lowship at Stanford last Septem
ber. Her interest in anorexia
nervosa began at the eating dis
orders clinic in the Children's
Hospital.
The clinic receives patients
from this area and other parts of
the country. Sixteen to 20
patients are counseled on a
weekly basis.
Katz's goal is to continue con
tributing to the field of adoles
cent medicine. "If I'm still
learning, expanding, then I'm
content," she said.
