# Microcomputers used as teaching tools

### KIMBERLY ESTIS 
For years, students have been told to
take apples to their teachers. Now a
Stanford professor is getting in on the act
and taking Apples to her students, who
are teachers themselves.
Education Prof. Nira Hativa is co
teaching "Developing Lessons for the
Computer," a three-unit School of Edu
cation course designed to teach teachers
how to best use computers in the class
room.
Hativa uses a computer programming
language called BASIC as a topic tor dis
cussion. Panel sessions, speakers, field
trips and demonstrations of computer in
novations are also included in the sum
mer institute through the School ot Edu
cation.
'"Step-by-step is the way 1 teach every
thing," 1 lativa says.
The objective of the course is to
develop lessons on microcomputers for
use by students and teachers in elemen
tary and secondary schools.
Nimi Paulraj, a visiting teacher Irom

India, is learning how to prepare graphic
illustrations to teach basic math to stu
dents in elementary schools. "This is my
first computer class and 1 want to learn
how to prepare lessons to help me
teach," she said.
Students design educational software
on a topic of their choice, Hativa said.
"A computer is like a dumb animal . . .
you have to learn to speak in the few
symbols it understands," said Deborah
Randolph, teaching assistant for the in
teractive educational technology pro
gram.
Superpilot is a computer language de
signed to help nonprogrammers learn to
prepare brief lessons on microcom
puters. Authority languages provide
training in the development of graphic il
lustrations and sound technology.
"No prior knowledge of computers or
programming is assumed," Hativa said.
The unique aspect of the course is that
students evaluate each other's projects

and the grade is based upon the perfor
mance and quality of the software de
signed.
Also taken into consideration in
grading are the use of computer capabili
ties, technical quality, creativity,
documentation, screen layout and
quality of content.
"Computers should be used to show
things that teachers cannot," Hativa said.
Computers add an aesthetic value to pre
sentations of fast computations and math
equations.
One very good reason for taking a
computer course, Hativa says, is the high
demand for people technically skilled
with programming ability.
The search is on by business and
educators for people to work on projects
that require computer programming and
data analysis. Those people with experi
ence are always wanted, Hativa said.
"It is important to learn how to
develop lessons on microcomputers be

cause it is a highly requested skill,"
Hativa said.
The unusual feature about the course
is developing lessons on microcomputers
that give people who arc unlixT*\\\\aT v/w\\
computers knowledge of how to create
lessons and develop some degree of com
puter literacy within the eight-week
course.
Students who are already proficient in
programming can also participate in the
course and extend their knowledge of the
principles of software development by
using advanced computer languages and
additional computer equipment. Five
Apple computers are currently available
in the School of Education for this
course.
The first four weeks of the course are
devoted to lectures and demonstrations
on the theory and practice of computers.
The second half is geared toward hands
on experience. Emphasis is on productiv
ity â€” producing a useful product before
the end of the course, Hativa said.
