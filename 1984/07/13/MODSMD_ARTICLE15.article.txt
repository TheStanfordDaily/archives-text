# Alumni, STARTS host publishing courses
## 
### ELAINE WANG Daily staff 
I he two publishing
courses on campus this sum
mer span both extremes of
the how-to spectrum. There
is the seventh annual Stan
lord Publishing Course from
July 9-21, sponsored by the
Alumni Association, and the
one-day seminar tomorrow
by writer/publisher/scholar
Douglas Smith, sponsored by
Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS).
1 he two-week Stanford
Publishing Course is a high
powered, in-depth overview
of the book and magazine in
dustries. Over 150 profes
sionals, now housed at Roble
and with local families, par
ticipate in a series of general
and specialized seminars
held 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
Subjects covered include

editing, design, new technol
ogy, marketing, sales, adver
tising and production — with
over 50 publishing profes
sionals and Stanford faculty
leading lectures and
workshops.
Its a lavish and intense
operation — tuition is $950
— involving field trips to
printing companies, two din
ners, and daily lunches under
the trees of Bowman Alumni
Grove with the speakers.
Smith's one-day affair, on
the other hand, is simply
titled. "How to publish your
own book." Although he will
bring up similar issues of
what to do to get things pub
lished, his approach will be
to help those who edit jour
nals or write books which do
not necessarily appeal to
large-scale public interest.
"I can save you two-thirds

of the printing costs," said
Smith. In his seminar he will
include listings of first-rate
printers who do the . job
cheaply, and explain how
they do it. He will also pro
vide a workbook with bibli
ography and a list of Bay
Area and national resources
for small publishers.
He added, "If someone
has a book of poetry all
ready to go. we could talk a
few minutes about how to
market it . . . where to go."
Smith approached
SI ARTS about premiering
his seminar here. Coordina
tor Jean Martin found his
ideas an appropriate match
to the goals of STARTS.
From his own experience, he
gathered the information and
knowledge of shortcuts. "He
went through a lot of travail
and thought that lots of

people in the Stanford com
munity might need help. He
simply wanted to pass it on."
she said.
"This is what STARTS is
interested in," Martin added.

The seminar will empha
size "the flow of the publish
ing industry." said Smith,
with special attention to the
basic how-tos: how to figure
out if your book will sell,
how to do most of the type
setting and layout by your
self. and how to make
publishing your career.
It's a personal overview
from a man who's gone
through the long and often
frustrating process, although
he will have two other people
— a printer and a big-time
publisher — present as re
sources.
Martin stresses that
Smith's seminar is useful to
students as well as profes
sionals. "(The Stanford
Publishing Course) is very
expensive and very hard to
get into. It eliminates most
students," she said.
