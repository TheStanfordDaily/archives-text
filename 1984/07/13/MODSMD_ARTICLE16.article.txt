# Roman runs Olympic torch in Monterey

It seemed like a simple
enough idea. The Stanford
Shopping Center Merchants As
sociation would donate $3,000
to buy the kilometer of the
Olympic Torch Relay that will
be run near Stanford. Then the
Merchants Association would
hold a sweepstakes contest, with
the winner chosen to run that
kilometer.
So they hired the firm of
Aulik & Associates to

'This is my opportu
nity to be more than
a spectator - I'm
sharing in the spirit
of the Olympics'

administer the contest. Michael
Baum became its coordinator.
Enter Miguel Roman. A San
Mateo resident, Roman is an
employee ot the University in
the Facilities/Project Manage
ment office, a trailer in back of
Old Pavilion.
Roman won the contest, but
the Stanford Shopping Center
Merchants Association did not
get its money in on time, and
lost the kilometer near Stan
ford. Roman was then told that
he would run somewhere else.
Until Wednesday, however, he
didn't know where he would be

running.
A physical fitness buff who
runs 50 miles a week, bicycles,
and swims, Roman almost went
to the Olympics as a participant
— he was a member of the
Mexican judo team from 1961
to 1963, and competed in the
61 Pan-American Games.
"This is my opportunity to be
more than a spectator," he said.
Indirectly, I'm doing some
thing — I'm sharing in the spirit
of the Olympics."
Sadly, though, it is a spirit
that is becoming increasingly
commercialized. The Los An
geles Olympic Organizing Com
mittee (LAOOC) is selling the
kilometers on a first-come, first
serve basis.
As tar as Roman can tell, not
only did the Shopping Center
miss out because of the first
come, first-serve method of
buying, but the problem was
further compounded by the fact
that the LAOOC has oversold
the kilometers in Southern Cali
fornia. As a result, Southern
Californians are being bumped
up to Northern California.
Roman will be running the
kilometer on the 17-Mile Drive
in Monterey at 8:33 p.m. on
July 17. Although he was
relieved to finally be told where
he will be running, Roman was
puzzled, because Michael Baum
was still trying to get a kilometer
for him in this area.
