## Half Moon Bay: a quick escape from the city 
### DEBORAH BROWN 
The town of Half Moon Bay
may have gotten off on the
wrong foot. The WPA guide to
California reports that "The
weary men of the Portola ex
pedition pitched camp near the
mouth of Pilarcitos Creek on
the rainy night of October 20,
1769, and spent a wet and
miserable weekend — their
medicine gone and their food
running low — before they
could gather enough strength to
move on."
While it may still be possible
to get cold and wet, Half Moon
Bay has grown to a small but
pleasant town boasting its own
winery and an annual pumpkin
festival in October. Most impor
tant to visitors, though, is the
narrow white sandy beach that
borders the bay. The town
stretches out in the bit of flat
land next to the shore, soon
giving way to rolling hills,
dotted with grazing cattle, that
provide a scenic backdrop to the
general landscape.
Half Moon Bay is distin
guished more by being pleasant
and accessible than spectacular.
The 30-40 minute drive over
the Santa Cruz mountains on
Route 92 provides the fastest
escape to any local beaches —
Route 92 ends at Route 1 by the
center of Half Moon Bay. Food,
drink and other amenities are
easily available in the town it
self, or in the other small com
munities to the north along the
coast.
Commercial Half Moon Bay
starts a few miles out ot town,
along Route 92. Numerous
fresh produce stands and nur
series line the road. In addition,
the Obester Winery is located
on the left, near the city limit.
The weather is generally too
cool and wet for growing grapes
in the area, so the Obesters buy

them from all over northern
California. Tours of the winery
can be arranged by appointment
(phone 726-9463), and the tas
ting room is open Friday
through Sunday, 10-5, The
room is small but new and
pleasant, with a view of a
Christmas-tree plantation in
back. The staff are friendly and
willing to chat. They also let you
taste a lot of wines, and it's free.
A quick trip to Obester makes a
nice start to a day on the beach.
Prices run from $5 to $9 per
bottle.
The commercial center of
Half Moon Bay itself is Main St.
Although a few restored and
neatly painted Victorian houses
appear every few blocks, Main
St. is in general the main street
of a small farming town. One or
two crafts and clothing shops
are located at the end of the
street closest to the highway,
but this is not prime shopping
territory. The San Benito
House, a beautifuMy restored
old inn at Main and Mill, pro
vides one of the highlights of the
town.
For most people, the attrac
tion of Half Moon Bay is the
beach. One long uninterrupted
beach stretches along the whole
bay. It can be reached by any of
several access points along
Route 1. The farthest south is
Redondo Beach, which marks
the northern edge of the high
sandstone cliffs that provide
such spectacular scenery at San
Gregorio and Pomponio
beaches farther south. Redondo
Beach Road ends at the top of
the cliff. This may be the most
scenic of the Half Moon Bay
beaches, and there is no en
trance fee.
Francis Beach (also called
Half Moon Bay State Beach) is
next up the coast. There are
some picnic tables and grills be

tween the parking lot and the
beach, and RV camping is
available.
Farther North is Venice
Beach. Here the cliff has reap
pearred in the form of a low
rocky wall behind the beach that
provides some seclusion and a
good windbreak. At Dunes
Beach, the rock wall has given
way to some seclusion and a
good windbreak.
North of the beach, houses
and commercial establishments
appear within sight of the beach
and interfere a bit with the view.
Several of these are interesting
in themselves; the Bach Dan
cing and Dynamite Society (31 1
Mirada Road, 726-4143) is a
non-profit organization housed
in a two-story building on the

beach that puts on classical and
jazz concerts- on Friday nights
and Sunday afternoons
respectively. The classical series
has discontinued for the sum
mer (to restart Sept. 14).
Continuing north out of Half
Moon Bay itself, Route 1 bends
toward the ocean and runs right
along the beach. The beaches at
El Granada, clearly visible from
the long pier jutting out from
the beach, are quite popular.
Rocky tide pools line the
shore next to the town of Moss
Beach. Low tide is the best time
to look for starfish, sea urchins,
and assorted other marine in
vertebrates. A small sign in the
highway directs you to the
James V. Fitzgerald Marine
Preserve.

The hilly terrain inland from
the town is almost entirely
privately owned range land and
not very accessible. One excep
tion is a short drive in the
country along Higgins-
Purissima Road. Drive south
along Route 1 from Route 92,
then turn left at the sign just out
of town to get there. An eight
mile loop winds up a canyon
through the hills, and down the
next ravine along Purissima
Creek Road back to Route 1 a
few miles south. Unfortunately,
the road is very narrow with no
shoulder making it almost
impossible to stop along the
way. The only place to pull off is
the entrance to a small nature

preserve, just over the crest of
the hill.
