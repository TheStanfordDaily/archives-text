# Miramar: spectacular view
## 
### 
Miramar Beach Inn
Magellan Ave. and Mirada Rd.
Miramar
726-9053
"Miramar" means "sea view"
in Spanish: and the Miramar

Beach Inn boasts a spectacular
view of both Pillar Point and the
Pacific Ocean.
The decor is attractive, the at
mosphere is relaxed and infor
mal. and the food is good, but
undistinguished.

Hie interior is spacious, with
hardwood tables, plants, stained
glass and large picture windows
offering breathtaking views of
sunset on the ocean.

There isn't a bad seat in the
house, and the rear of the Inn
includes a small stage and dance
floor.
Located two and one-half
miles north of the intersection
of Highway 92 and Route 1, the
Inn offers three different menus
— a moderately priced one for
weekdays, a modified brunch
menu for weekend days and a
more expensive assortment of
entrees for weekend nights.
The weekend menu lists II
entrees, ranging in price from
pan-fried oysters, calamari
Dijon and fish and chips for
$8.25 to New York steak at
$12.95. A house specialty which
caught our attention was the Pil
lar Point Saute — prawns and
scallops sauteed with artichoke
hearts, tomatoes and mush
rooms — for $11.95.
We sampled the house white
wine — a decent but plain
chablis for $1.50 per glass.
The blackboard also listed
four wine specials — Alexander
Valley /infandel, Obester
Sauvignon Blanc, Tepesquet
Vin Blanc and Eaglepoint Blanc
de Noir — all for $2.25 per
glass.
The Eaglepoint had a pleas
ant fruity taste, good enough for
us to order a second glass.
Eight appetizers were listed,
ranging from garlic bread for
$1.25 to steamed clams at
$6.95.
The Miramar seafood chow
der ($2.25 for a cup, $2.95 for a
bowl) is billed as "the best on
the coast." While some might
dispute that claim, it was
definitely excellent — a rich
New England chowder base
with brandy, shrimp and crab as
well ns clams.
We ordered two of the tour
specials of tlie day — broiled
seabass ($10.25) and halibut
($11.50). Both were well
cooked, but slightly bland with
little seasoning.
Both were purchased fresh in
San Francisco, according to
Manager Melanie Smith.
The halibut was clearly the
better of the two entrees — the
serving was more generous and
the fish had more flavor.
Two other specials —
poached salmon and stuffed sole
Florentine — were similarly
priced.
Miramar gets its seafood spe
cials from a variety of sources.
Smith said, including nearby
Princeton fishermen. Not all are
completely fresh, however, and
some are flown in from as far
away as the East Coast. Specials

change every three days, she
said.
Dinner entrees come with
soup or salad, bread and butter,
rice and vegetables.
The house salad came in a
generous serving but consisted
mostly of iceberg lettuce. The
lettuce could have been fresher
and was topped by a large
cucumber slice, tomato and car
rot slices, and wilted alfalfa
sprouts. The blue cheese dress
ing had a rich, creamy base, but
included no chunks of cheese.
Both our entrees were accom
panied by slices of steamed zuc
chini, well-cooked but still firm.
The couple at the adjacent
table had the pan-fried oysters
($8.25) and linguine and clams
($8.50).
The former came in a
generous serving of five large
oysters, but was slightly
overdone and a bit too dry, we
were told.
The linguine was good, but
would have benefitted from
more garlic and butter, they
said.
Dessert offerings ranged from
carrot cake ($1.75) to chocolate
mousse torte ($2.25).
The chocolate torte was ex
cellent — a rich, smooth confec
tion that made us wish we'd left
more room for dessert.
The cheesecake ($2.00) was
not as satisfying. It wasn't bad,
though — somewhere in the
Sarah Lee range — but not up
to the level of a first-class New
York cheesecake.
Dinner for two, including
three glasses of wine, two
desserts, coffee and an extra or
der of soup, came to $38 with
tax.
Visitors to Miramar can enjoy
live entertainment six nights per
week. A pop-jazz group called
Ensemble plays every Sunday,
beginning at 9 p.m., and
Miramar otters live comedy
every Tuesday at 10 p.m.
The Miramar Beach Band is
featured every Wednesday
night, and a variety of rock
bands entertain on Thursdays,
Fridays and Saturdays. There is
no cover charge most nights, al
though comedy night costs $2
and special acts like last night's
performance by the Beau
Brummels cost $3.
According to Smith, the menu
will be expanded before the end
ot this summer, with popular
specials taking permanent posi
tions on the bill of fare.
Other changes are in the of
ting, she said, because owner
Dieter Hartmann recently
began taking a more active role
in the Inn's management.

Miramar Beach Inn
Magellan Ave. and Mirada Rd.
Miramar
726-9053
"Miramar" means "sea view"
in Spanish: and the Miramar

Beach Inn boasts a spectacular
view of both Pillar Point and the
Pacific Ocean.
The decor is attractive, the at
mosphere is relaxed and infor
mal. and the food is good, but
undistinguished.

Hie interior is spacious, with
hardwood tables, plants, stained
glass and large picture windows
offering breathtaking views of
sunset on the ocean.

There isn't a bad seat in the
house, and the rear of the Inn
includes a small stage and dance
floor.
Located two and one-half
miles north of the intersection
of Highway 92 and Route 1, the
Inn offers three different menus
— a moderately priced one for
weekdays, a modified brunch
menu for weekend days and a
more expensive assortment of
entrees for weekend nights.
The weekend menu lists II
entrees, ranging in price from
pan-fried oysters, calamari
Dijon and fish and chips for
$8.25 to New York steak at
$12.95. A house specialty which
caught our attention was the Pil
lar Point Saute — prawns and
scallops sauteed with artichoke
hearts, tomatoes and mush
rooms — for $11.95.
We sampled the house white
wine — a decent but plain
chablis for $1.50 per glass.
The blackboard also listed
four wine specials — Alexander
Valley /infandel, Obester
Sauvignon Blanc, Tepesquet
Vin Blanc and Eaglepoint Blanc
de Noir — all for $2.25 per
glass.
The Eaglepoint had a pleas
ant fruity taste, good enough for
us to order a second glass.
Eight appetizers were listed,
ranging from garlic bread for
$1.25 to steamed clams at
$6.95.
The Miramar seafood chow
der ($2.25 for a cup, $2.95 for a
bowl) is billed as "the best on
the coast." While some might
dispute that claim, it was
definitely excellent — a rich
New England chowder base
with brandy, shrimp and crab as
well ns clams.
We ordered two of the tour
specials of tlie day — broiled
seabass ($10.25) and halibut
($11.50). Both were well
cooked, but slightly bland with
little seasoning.
Both were purchased fresh in
San Francisco, according to
Manager Melanie Smith.
The halibut was clearly the
better of the two entrees — the
serving was more generous and
the fish had more flavor.
Two other specials —
poached salmon and stuffed sole
Florentine — were similarly
priced.
Miramar gets its seafood spe
cials from a variety of sources.
Smith said, including nearby
Princeton fishermen. Not all are
completely fresh, however, and
some are flown in from as far
away as the East Coast. Specials

change every three days, she
said.
Dinner entrees come with
soup or salad, bread and butter,
rice and vegetables.
The house salad came in a
generous serving but consisted
mostly of iceberg lettuce. The
lettuce could have been fresher
and was topped by a large
cucumber slice, tomato and car
rot slices, and wilted alfalfa
sprouts. The blue cheese dress
ing had a rich, creamy base, but
included no chunks of cheese.
Both our entrees were accom
panied by slices of steamed zuc
chini, well-cooked but still firm.
The couple at the adjacent
table had the pan-fried oysters
($8.25) and linguine and clams
($8.50).
The former came in a
generous serving of five large
oysters, but was slightly
overdone and a bit too dry, we
were told.
The linguine was good, but
would have benefitted from
more garlic and butter, they
said.
Dessert offerings ranged from
carrot cake ($1.75) to chocolate
mousse torte ($2.25).
The chocolate torte was ex
cellent — a rich, smooth confec
tion that made us wish we'd left
more room for dessert.
The cheesecake ($2.00) was
not as satisfying. It wasn't bad,
though — somewhere in the
Sarah Lee range — but not up
to the level of a first-class New
York cheesecake.
Dinner for two, including
three glasses of wine, two
desserts, coffee and an extra or
der of soup, came to $38 with
tax.
