# Cafe cranks out unusual fare

Ricci's Cafe
547 Main St.
Half Moon Bay
726-6266
Ricci's is a cheerful, bustling cafe in the main
street ot downtown Halt Moon Bay; obviously a
local favorite. The orange and white striped
awning sets an atmosphere that is continued
inside by potted plants, local seascapes on the
walls, and (on our visit) a bright bouquet of fresh
flowers on the counter. It is a clean, unpretentious
small restaurant.
Service has recently been extended to dinner,
and all lunch and dinner items except specials are
available for either meal. The breakfast items
sounded tempting. Numerous omelets (including
unusual ones containing artichoke or linguica)
ranged from $3 to $4.50. Pancakes, charbroiled
steak and eggs ($5.75) and out-of-the-ordinary
dishes like apple pan dowdee (apple French toast
served with bacon of sausage) made this seem like
an appealing place to eat if one found oneself in
Half Moon Bay at 6 a.m.
Lunch and dinner items run heavily to sand
wiches and burgers ($3.50-$4). We didn't order
burgers, but they looked large and charbroiled,
served on a sesame bun. Ricci's lives up to its
name with some pasta offerings as well as a few
solid dinner items — chicken Parmigiana ($6.00),
steak, surf and turf ($7.95), and a seafood platter
($6.95). We had the seafood platter annd a lunch
special, a calamari sandwich with Monterey Jack
and marinara sauce. The seafood platter
(calamari, shrinp, scallops, and sole) was breaded

and deep-fried, and fairly routine and bland,
despite a huge dollop of tartar sauce that ap
peared to have been deposited on the plate
several hours earlier. The calamari sandwich, on
the other hand, was an unusual and good idea,
and quite tasty. The calamari, breaded and fried,
sat on one slice of sourdough bread with a small
piece of Jack melted on top, while a spreading ot
marinara sauce graced the other slice. The
marinara sauce appeared in several other dishes
on the menu (rigatoni with calamari in marinara
sauce, $5.95, tor one), and was really the highlight
ot the meal. A tangy and fresh-tasting tomato
sauce, it was appealingly flavored with calamari.
(Calamari is stressed quite heavily at Ricci's).
I he sandwich came with a disappointing salad
that consisted of a wet, partially hacked pile of
iceberg with a slice of tomato one the side, and a
tew croutons-from-a-box on top.
I he only desserts are pie and apple fritters —
because they were out of pie, we had apple frit
ters. (the waitress informed us that since Ricci's is
closed on Monday, they tend to run out of things
by Sunday afternoon). The fritters were delicious;
a plate ot crisp, piping-hot morsels was buried in
whipped cream. With a cup of coffee, it was a very
satisfying end to the meal.
Ricci s is more of a cafe or a coffee shop than a
formal, tull-tledged restaurant. Some of the food
is plain and uninspired, but a few imaginative
touches enliven the offerings. Service is fast and
friendly, and a limited selection of wine and beer
is served.
