San Benito House
Main and Mill Sts. Half Moon Bav

The San Benito House in Half Moon
Bay ambitiously places itself in the tradi
tion of "the auberges of Europe" and
"the wayside hostelry of New England."
It beautifully supports and even sur
passes those claims — a comfortable bar,
a superior restaurant, and a quaint hotel
— all under one roof — provide a pleas
ing setting for a drink a meal, or a
weekend.
Covered with ivy and flanked by a
well-manicured English garden, the San
Benito House contrasts with the streets
of Half Moon Bay, where cowboys stroll
in mud-caked boots and signs proclaim
an upcoming rodeo. Hardly the ideal
spot for an auberge, you would think.
But at the corner of Main and Mill
Streets sits the San Benito Saloon. Its
doors and windows fly open to welcome
both local residents and visitors. And
that was exactly the clientele I found
there — seven cowboys at one large
table, local merchants, a few singles, and
snuggling couples. The groups co-exist in
an easy balance, even mingling to pet the
obligatory small-town-bar puppy.
The bar boasts an array of beer and
standard mixed drinks as well as a
surprising range of liqueurs and aperitifs.
Guests staying in the hotel receive two
complimentary drinks, one of the per
sonal touches that adds to the charm of
the San Benito. Decorated with old
photographs and antique fixtures, the
bar is a pleasant place to wait for your
dinner reservation or just to pass the af
ternoon.
Separated from the bar by curtained
double doors, the restaurant attracts a
less diverse, but not necessarily more
elite clientele. It is posh without preten
sion, and the furnishings are homey.
Fresh flowers dot every table.
The menu is intentionally limited and

changes weekly. The owner and Execu
tive Chet Carol Mickelson prefers to run
things this way. She co-ordinates a group
of suppliers in a personal arrangement
which assures the San Benito the freshest
food available. The group includes chef
Kristin Mathison, who cooks the special
meals on Friday and Saturday nights;
Valerie and Tom Phipps of the Phipps
ranch in Pescadero, who grow produce
tor the San Benito House; Marty Bot
ham of Princeton a few miles up the
coastline; and Mickelson, who purchases
the food and coordinates all the cooking.
In the winter, Mickelson meets with
Phipps, and the ranch agrees to grow
produce especially for the San Benito. If
something looks especially good for the
coming year, or even the coming week,
Mickelson can easily change the menu.
It's pretty much the same arrangement
with Princeton Seafood: Mickelson and
Botham discuss what's likely to be good
and Carol arranges the menu accord
ingly. The flexibility of the arrangement
allows for last-minute changes to include
whatever is fresh; the result is that every
meal is special.
Fresh food doesn't mean beans if you
don't have someone who knows how to
cook it. The talents of Mickelson and
Mathison and the rest of the kitchen staff
make the most of the opportunity as we
found out on a recent Saturday night
visit.
The homemade lasagna with pesto was
a delicious pasta, succulent and tinged
with fresh basil from San Benito's own
garden, I found myself talking about it
well into brunch the next day. Mickelson
picked up the recipe while studying
cooking in Italy. The salad which fol
lowed consisted of the smoothest feta
cheese I have ever eaten, black olives,
parsley, and spinach leaves in an un
obtrusive Caesar vinaigrette dressing.
These two appetizers did exactly what
they were supposed to do — whetted my

appetite for the main course.
The choices included filet of beet broc
hette with fresh truit grilled over
mesquite. The brochette included two
sauces, a mint bearnaise and a madeira,
both excellently prepared. "Having two
sauces is fashionable now," said Carol
with an almost apologetic grin as if she
hated to cater to fashion.
The other entree was seafood
provencale, which included sea bass,
halibut, mussels, clams, and prawns in
the traditional tomato, clam and garlic
broth. The chorus ot clam and mussel
shells gaping tron the bowl was an entic
ing sight. The broth was delicately
spiced, and the seafood was expertly
cooked, It is a pleasure to find a restau
rant that presents fresh food without em
bellishment.
Accompanying the meal was a basket
of warm homemade whole wheat bread,
which the San Benito makes twice a day.
Customers sometimes persuade the
kitchen to let them buy a loaf of two.
'Some people will pay as musch as six dol
lars for a loaf; said Mathison.
A moderate wine list offered Sonoma
and Napa vintages, with nothing over
$22. A true wine buff might not find the
right bottle to match the quality of his
food, but our choice of the Joseph Phelps
Cabernet (1979) was reasonably good.
The dessert were irresistible, espe
cially when the waitress began to
describe 'the hands-down house favorite,'
a Ghirardelli chocolate cake with
apricots, walnuts, and cognac and cov
ered with a chocolate glaze. The
olalaberries ordered by my dining com
panion were plump and tart. The Grand
Marnier sauce covering them provided a
sweet contradiction. An ample list of
special coffees will suit almost any taste.
During the week Mickelson, who has
trained with master chefs in France and
Italy, prepares dinner, which varies ac
cording to whatever is fresh. The previ

ous week she ottered veal scallopini and
mesquite-grilled fresh catch among other
entrees. During the week, a three-course
dinner costs $10.95. On weekends there
dishes are more elaborate, and dinner
costs $14.95. Call before you go, and
someone will be glad to tell you what is
offered for that day.
Lodgings in the San Benito House are
consistent with the 'country' air of the res
taurant. Each room is decorated individu
ally with antiques, brass fixtures, and is
painted in pastels. I stayed in a very
soothing aquamarine room. A pink room
was cute, but not 'cutesy.' The bathrooms
contain deep porcelain tubs, I slept with
my window open all night to breathe in
the ocean air.
A continental breakfast arrived in the
roon Sunday morning with hot coffee,
orange juice, soft boiled eggs, and hot
slices of the homemade whole wheat
bread. Those with light appetites may
want to pass up continental breakfast in
lieu of the Sunday brunch. There is a dis
count on the brunch for guests staying
the hotel.
Whether you are staying in the hotel
or just looking for a nice place to eat a
leisurely meal, the Sunday brunch is not
to be missed. For $10.95 the buffet style
meal includes a list of items enticing
enough to list without comment: cham
pagne; gravlax; live pate; artichoke; black
olive, red pepper salad; beef bourguig
non; roast ham; stuffed mushrooms;
huevos rancheros; homemade cinnamon
swirls; apple muffins; and strawberries
with Grand Marnier sauce. If it is not too
cool, sit outside on the redwood deck. As
with all meals at the San Benito, you
may want to call beforehand to see
what's offered. You can be sure that the
copious selction offered at the Sunday
brunch will contain something to please
you.
