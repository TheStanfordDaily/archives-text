The Shore Bird

The Shore Bird restaurant is a
saucy place, from its time-green
shutters to its menus.
This cozy retreat, billed as
"Cape Cod on the California
Coast,'' features fresh seafood
and cocktails in a homey atmo
sphere. It draws tourists weary
from the beach at El Granada,
yachtsmen from the marina at
Pillar Point Harbor, and young
salts from the local fishing fleet.
All drink hot toddies, or lu
scious cocktails, together in the
bar and keep a sharp eye out for
the comfortable chairs by the
fireplacd. On foggy afternoons,
this spot is particularly pleasant
and usually taken.
But if you miss out on the
fireplace, not to worry. The
entire restaurant with its
beamed-ceilings and nautical
overtones is equally appealing.
Built in 1971, the Shore Bird
is modeled after the architecture
around, you guessed it, Cape
Cod. Wood-paned windows,
flower boxes, a fenced gable
roof, and a ship-shaped weather
vane all mimic the Eastern
seaboard. But the patrons are
pure Californian, like the
sprawling cypress reaching over
the redwood patio.
To give you an example, one
recent Sunday evening, the wo
man at the table to our left told
of migrating to California from
Arkansas in the 1970s to orga
nize protest marches. While this
was going on, the yachtsman to
our right caressed his
ladyfriend's knee and explained,
in a Boston accent, how his wife
signed all the checks.
What draws a crowd at the
Shore Bird isn't the ec
centricities of a few of the pa
trons, however. It's the consis
tently good — if not always ex

cellent — food, fit to satisfy al
most any pocketbook and appe
tite.
The Shore Bird serves not
only lunch and dinner, but Sun
day brunch and a seafood/oyster
bar as well.
For the lesser appetite, or the
flatter wallet, one can order
from the Seafood Cafe menu in
the bar. This offers fish chow
ders, soups, appetizers, salads
and wonderful hot breads, at a
price range from $3.50 to $5.95.
You may have these served on
the patio, if you like.
A great way to top-off a day
at the beach is to drop by during
Happy Hour for fresh, raw
oysters, served on the half shell
with lemon and cocktail sauce.
You can order as many as you
want for 35 cent* eacfu The
cheese bread — hot, heady with
garlic and melted jack — is sure
to warm you all the way down.
Also a winner at the Shore
Bire is the Sunday Brunch. For
$10.50, you can order anything
on the menu, which ranges from
the traditional eggs Benedict, or
sausage and scrambled eggs, to
seafood cannelloni and the
catch of the day. The price in
cludes juice, a fresh fruit bowl,
biscuits, sweet rolls, muffins,
and coffee or tea.
Though the lunch and dinner
menus are very similar to each
other, there are a few differ
ences.
First, the luncheon offers
hamburgers, sandwiches, and a
bigger salad selection, along
with the more popular dinner
entrees. The latter are served a
la carte and are priced $3-$4
less than the full dinner would
be. And most of the dinners are
moderately priced in the $9.95
to $ 14.95 bracket.
Most are also quite good, with
a few exceptions.
Like the lime-green shutters
at the windows and their quilted

gingham valances, the dinners at
the Shore Bird hold enough
surprises to be interesting. We
ordered the teriyaki chicken at
$9.95 and the scallops Sausalito
at $13.95.
Both dinners included an ap
petizer tray of raw carrots, broc
coli, pickled peppers and
jicama, a type of Mexican tur
nip, and salad.
The salad, served family
style, could have fed four easily.
To the base of lettuce, red
cabbage, sliced mushrooms and
cherry tomatoes, you could then
add raisins, sunflower seeds,
parmesan, or bacon, as you
wished. Three different bowls of
dressing — blue cheese,
thousand island and a house
french — were also brought to
the table.
The teriyaki chicken was suc
culent, broiled with pineapple,
and garnished with slivered al
monds. One of the pleasant
surprises. Not so pleasant was

the teriyaki sauce served with it,
which had been thickened with
cornstarch and graciously left to
the side.
The scallops Sausalito were
quite tasty and cooked per
fectly, neither over- nor un
derdone. They had been
sauteed in white wine with gar
lic, mushrooms and green
onions, covered with bechamel
sauce and served on rice. Deli
cious.
The only complaint we had
was with the meal's vegetable.
Working on the assumption that
sliced zuccini (what else at this
time of year?) should be cooked
al dente, ours was overdone.
An even more intriguing
chicken dish than the one above
was the "Crabtown Chicken".
This was described as breast
stuffed with crab and garlic but
ter, then baked and topped with
a sherry cream sauce. Unfortun
ately, at $10.95, they had sold
out of it. Maybe next time.

If anything characterizes the
Shore Bird, it's the übiquitous
sauces. Almost everything, in
cluding the desserts, come with
one. Hollandaise, mornay, bear
naise, bechamel, fresh lemon,
sherry cream, fudge (on
desserts) — the list goes on.
No one was complaining,
however, except our neighbor,
the ex-Arkansas ex-radical. She
felt her seafood cannelloni in a
spicy Italian sauce was a bit too
tangy.
