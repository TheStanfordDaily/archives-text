## Pac-10, Big 10 break with CFA on TV pact 
### 
Chicago (AP) â€” The Big Ten and
Pacific 10 conferences indicated Wed
nesday they would not join the College
Football Association in a fall television
package, opting instead to form a coali
tion that could rival the 63-member CFA
for the biggest share of the television pie.
The decision came one day after the
sport's major schools voted the NCAA
out of the picture for 1984 by turning
down its last-ditch proposal for a TV

package based on voluntary cooperation.
The proposal was to replace two exist
ing NCAA packages sold to CBS, ABC
and ESPN tor almost $275 million that
the Supreme Court ruled two weeks ago
were in violation of federal antitrust
laws.
"I don't care what anyone tells you,
that vote was not against the NCAA
plan, but against the NCAA," Big Ten
Commissioner Wayne Duke said Wed

nesday. "It was calculated simply to
replace the NCAA with the CFA."
Stantord Athletic Director Andy
Geiger could not be reached for com
ment here last night.
Following the NCAA's defeat Tues
day, many of the universities' athletic
directors believed the Football Televi
sion Planning Committee, a coalition
that would have included the 63-member
CFA as well as the Big Ten and Pacific

10 conferences, would emerge as the
dominant bargaining agent in college
football.
The CPA already counts among its
members most of the traditional confer
ence powers such as Alabama, Georgia,
Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas, as well
as independent powers such as Notre
Dame and Penn State.
