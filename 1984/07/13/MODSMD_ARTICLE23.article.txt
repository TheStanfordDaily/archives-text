## Pac-10, Big 10 break with CFA on TV pact 
### 
Chicago (AP) — The Big Ten and
Pacific 10 conferences indicated Wed
nesday they would not join the College
Football Association in a fall television
package, opting instead to form a coali
tion that could rival the 63-member CFA
for the biggest share of the television pie.
The decision came one day after the
sport's major schools voted the NCAA
out of the picture for 1984 by turning
down its last-ditch proposal for a TV

package based on voluntary cooperation.
The proposal was to replace two exist
ing NCAA packages sold to CBS, ABC
and ESPN tor almost $275 million that
the Supreme Court ruled two weeks ago
were in violation of federal antitrust
laws.
"I don't care what anyone tells you,
that vote was not against the NCAA
plan, but against the NCAA," Big Ten
Commissioner Wayne Duke said Wed

nesday. "It was calculated simply to
replace the NCAA with the CFA."
Stantord Athletic Director Andy
Geiger could not be reached for com
ment here last night.
Following the NCAA's defeat Tues
day, many of the universities' athletic
directors believed the Football Televi
sion Planning Committee, a coalition
that would have included the 63-member
CFA as well as the Big Ten and Pacific

10 conferences, would emerge as the
dominant bargaining agent in college
football.
The CPA already counts among its
members most of the traditional confer
ence powers such as Alabama, Georgia,
Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas, as well
as independent powers such as Notre
Dame and Penn State.
Had Big Ten drawing cards like Mic
higan and Ohio State and Pac-10 attrac
tions like USC and UCLA been added to
the CFA deck, that coalition would have
claimed virtually all the big-name
schools and every important television
market.
But Duke said Wednesday after
meetings with Pac-10 Executive Director
Tom Hansen and the television commit
tees of both conferences that neither
league would have any part of a CFA
based coalition plan.
"There were irreconcilable differences
of philosophy between us (and the
O A), even after giving full considera

tion to the shared economic benefits,"
said Duke. "We believe our two confer
ences in a joint venture gives us enough
strength to go ahead. Combined, we
already saturate almost 40 percent of the
television market."
Duke had said his coalition was talking
with several Eastern and Southern in
dependents to try to widen its base.
Duke did not provide names of those
schools.
The CFA, as well as the NCAA and
the coalition, had set a deadline yester
day for commitments from any institu
tion that wished to participate.
Duke said the conferences' television
committees would travel to New York
next week to open discussions with net
work executives.
Because CBS had backed the NCAA

plan supported by both the Big Ten and
Pac-10, that network was thought to
have the inside track on any package en
gineered by the two leagues. CBS
already televises basketball games from
both leagues.
ABC, which had expressed serious
reservations about that plan, is believed
to have an edge on any CFA proposal.
But executives of both networks said
money would determine where the
packages were sold.
Meanwhile, all 63 members of the
CFA, ignoring efforts by the Big Ten-
Pac-10 coalition to lure them away,
agreed yesterday to join together for a
television package in 1984, officials said.
Chuck Neinas, executive director of
the CFA, said each of his members had
filed a commitment form to be part of

the organization's plan. Neinas said that
means the schools are bound.
The CFA membership consists of the
Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big 8
Conference, the Southeastern Confer
ence, the Southwest Conference, the
Western Athletic Conference and 19 in
dependents.
"Naturally, we are pleased with the
unanimous vote," Neinas said from the
CPA's headquarters in Denver.
The Supreme Court two weeks ago
struck down two existing NCAA
packages sold to CBS, ABC and ESPN
for almost $275 million, saying they vio
lated federal antitrust laws.
As it stands, schools can still negotiate
deals for themselves on top of any ar
rangement they may make with either
the CFA or Big Ten-Pac-10.
