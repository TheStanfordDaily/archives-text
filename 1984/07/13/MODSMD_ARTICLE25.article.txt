# Pitchers dominate NL win in classic at Candlestick

San Francisco (AP) — It was a battle of
strikeouts on the s()th anniversary of the greatest
strikeout performance in baseball All-Star his
tory .
The National League regained its winning form
3-1 Tuesday night, a night for Fernando Valen
zucla and for Dwight Gooden, the youngest man
ever to appear in an All-Star Game. Together,
they struck out six consecutive American League
batters, breaking the record of five straight
strikeouts by Carl Hubbell in 1934.
It was a night of power against power, as Gary
Carter and Dale Murphy homered for the Nation
als, and George Brett hit a monster shot to
straightaway center field for the American
League's lone run.
And baseball's 55th All-Star contest, played in
the chill evening winds of Candlestick Park, was a
battle of heat, with a record 21 strikeouts — 1 1 by
the National League and 10 by the American.
"Being part of this will give me something to
look back on," Gooden said. "It will always be a
part of my career I can be proud of."
Hubbell, who was here to participate in the

first-ball ceremony, accomplished what is consid
ered the All-Star Game's most impressive
strikeout feat in 1934, when he struck out in
succession Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx,
A 1 Simmons and Joe Cronin — all, like Hubbell,
to become Hall of Famers.
Protecting a 2-1 lead, Valenzuela, of the Los
Angeles Dodgers, struck out Dave Winfield,
Reggie Jackson and George Brett in succession in
the fourth inning. Then, the rookie Gooden, only
19 years old, struck out Lance Parrish, Chet
Lemon and rookie pinch-hitter Alvin Davis in the
fifth.
"The pitching against us was pretty darn good
tonight," AL Manager Joe Altobelli of the Bal
timore Orioles said. "I guess some of it could have
been the twilight, but those weren't fluke
strikeouts. Those guys that pitched against us are
up there in strikeouts."
Gooden leads the NL with 133 strikeouts, and
Valenzuela is second with 128.
The previous single-game strikeout record was
20 — 11 by the Americans and nine by the Na
tionals — in 1968.
