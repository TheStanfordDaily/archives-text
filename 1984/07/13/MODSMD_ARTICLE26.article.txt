## Updike's 'Witches' lacking in magic 
### MIKE HALE 
"The Witches of Eastwick," by John
Updike. Alfred A. Knopf. 304 pp. $15.95.

"The Witches of Eastwick" is John Updike's
10th novel, his 18th work of fiction, the 28th
volume he has published in 25 years. Like most of
the others, it is beautifully written; it is allusive
and intelligent, and subtly displays Updike's
profound knowledge of people and things; it is full
of sympathetically and sharply observed charac
ters; and it hits you, every few pages, with the
most precise and appropriate image for some ac
tion or object that you can possibly imagine. It
makes compelling reading, and has Updike's
usual quota of relatively steamy sex. And, like
most of its predecessors, it's a failure as a novel.
Not since his first effort in the form — 1959's
"The Poorhouse Fair" — has Updike produced a
novel that provides the sense of closure, or whole
ness, that we expect from a longer work. His
novels since have been elaborate excursions, art
fully packaged (here in a baroque style, there in a
jazzy, slangy American idiom) and brilliant in
their parts, but with no worthwhile destination.
Updike's short stories, from the early ones about
his boyhood in Pennsylvania right up through his
most recent collection (1981's "Problems and
Other Stories"), have always been superb; and
ironically, one of his primary assets as a short
story writer is his ability to close with a line or par
agraph that gives the story meaning and
resonance, that makes you remember it years
later (a classic example being "Here Come the
Maples"). It can't be done that way in novels,
however, and Updike's novels are always frustrat
ingly thin — they seem like short stories fleshed
out with Updike's various obsessions (primarily
sexual) and stretched on arbitrary intellectual and
literary frameworks.
Most Updike novels possess some gimmick,
either of style or substance; here, there is a sub
stantial leavening of the occult. "The Witches of
Eastwick" harks back 20 years to "The Centaur,"
Updike's exercise in integrating Greek myth into
1950s rural Pennsylvania, but it's much less
pretentious than the earlier novel. "Witches" is a
straightforward story about three divorced wo
men in suburban Rhode Island, circa 1969 or
1970, who happen to be witches, and the shady
bachelor they get involved with, who just may be

a devil (and whose last name is Van Home). The
women's lives are much like those of other women
in their 30s, except that these three will occasion
ally fly through the air, or turn tennis balls into
bats, or make feathers and pins fall out of the
mouth of a rival. These powers are taken for
granted, and pop in and out of the narrative
casually; no one dwells on them, and in fact,
witchcraft is present in the book mainly as a recur
ring allusive texture in the settings and descrip
tions.
Witchcraft is both real and symbolic in the
novel; the most significant fact about the women's
powers is that in each case, they appeared and
grew after the women were divorced, and other
women who have been abandoned in various ways
by men develop powers of their own. For the first
time, Updike deals with some of his favorite
themes — matters of power and sexuality, male
envy of women ("uterus envy"?), the brutality of
nature — from a female point of view. It's not for
me to say how successfully he does this; but the
women, particularly earth-mother Alexandra and
wood-sprite Sukie, are fully realized, fascinating
characters.
The problem, as before, is that no matter how
much the novel deals with — sex, power,
"witchcraft," etc. — it ends up not being about
anything. We're given a sense of the emptiness of
the women's lives, which they try to fill with
various artistic endeavors — sculpting for the
tourists, teaching music, writing for the awful
town newspaper — and shown how their powers
can be used for evil purposes out of frustration
and boredom; and then, in what seems like a
tacked-on ending, all three get married (perhaps
with the help of witchcraft) and lose their powers,
and that's that. A lot happens in the book, but at
the end it feels like nothing more than a 300-page
exercise in maintaining atmosphere.
Updike, the tremendously productive writer,
has had a fascination with unproductive charac
ters — the inarticulate, aimless Rabbit Angstrom,
Henry Bech with his 10-year writing block. Per
haps, realizing he hasn't really had anything in
particular to say when he hasn't been writing
about himself — his boyhood in. the Olinger
stories, his marriage in the Maples stories — he
admires the noble silence of Henry Bech. In the
meantime, he continues to produce a book a year,
well-written, admirable in every way, and in the
end, unmemorable.
