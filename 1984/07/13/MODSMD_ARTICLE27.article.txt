In the foreword to "Trouble in Our Backyard",
John Womaek, Jr. writes "two struggles have
reached Central America": that between the left
and right, and that of the United States to find
some means to legitimate its paternalistic claim to
direct the affairs of the region. Both the means of
legitimation and the repressive measures to inter
vene in the conflict between the left and right
through counterinsurgency operations are
thoroughly documented and described in Richard
Alan White's "The Morass". These two books
expose the poverty of the so-called "two-track"
plan of U.S. support for reactionary despots in
Central America, and both make clear that con
tinued U.S. adherence to present policies will fur
ther split the left and right within Central Ameri
can countries and lead inevitably to direct U.S.
military intervention.
"Trouble in Our Backyard" takes its title from
U.S. foreign policy statements, and Martin Dis
kin, the editor ot this collection of essays, begins
his introduction by analyzing the origins of the
pretentious and condescending attitude toward
Central America reflected in the phrase "our
backyard." Diskin claims that such an attitude
results in part from the Reagan administration's
reluctance or outright refusal to recognize the in
digenous origins of dissent and revolution in
Central American countries, despite the
availability of scholarship through which it could
construct a realistic policy to ameliorate rather
than exacerbate the complex struggles within the
region. The eight essays that follow the introduc
tion offer a synoptic view of the problems within
the region's economy, a vigorous polemic against
apologists for Reagan's policies, an excellent sum
mary of the Church's role in social transforma
tion. and articles on the socioecotiomicjorigins of

revolution and the U.S. s attempts to thwart it in
El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Hon
duras. Regrettably, however, little mention is
made of Costa Rica, a country which, despite its
tradition of convivencia, is beginning to suffer po
litical and social dissension in the wake of Reagan
administration pressures for President Luis Al
berto Monge to build up his military forces.
The Reagan administration recently targeted
Costa Rica for $8 million worth of "lethal" mili
tary aid, threatening to jeopardize what President
Monge perhaps idealistically calls his country's
"perpetual neutrality." Costa Rica can look to
Honduras, where the U.S. has built up a "Fortress
America" under the auspices of the Big Pine I and
II military "exercises," to see what lies ahead. As
the Honduran civilian government has grown in
creasingly skeptical of, and overshadowed by, the
U.S.-supplied strength of its military, up to 1000
U.S. National Guardsmen and military engineers
have quietly entered Costa Rica to build roads
and expand an airstrip near the Costa Rican-
Nicaraguan border. As Richard Alan White ex
plains in "The Morass," material support for
paramilitary forces — in this case Eden Pastora's
anti-Sandinista troops — typically precedes more
direct and overt U.S. involvement, in accordance
with standard counterinsurgency doctrine.
White's compelling and well-documented anal
ysis of U.S.-sponsored counterinsurgency in
Central America offers what some will consider
disturbing evidence that Reagan administration
policy in Central America is "little more than an
updated version of the counterinsurgency
doctrine developed during the Vietnam War era."
Beginning with what often are only superficial
reforms, counterinsurgency operations attempt to
pacify the poor and victims of social injustice in
order to diminish their support for "subversives."
When attempts at pacification fail, counterinsur
gency doctrine calls for increasingly repressive
measures — including extrajudicial executions
and torture of suspected sympathizers — to stifle
popular support for the rebels. In Vietnam's Op
eration Phoenix, these repressive measures
resulted in the "neutralization" of nearly 20,000
Vietcong sympathizers, 6187 of whom were
killed; in Guatemala, state terrorism has claimed
approximately 80,000 lives since 1954, when a
CIA sponsored coup ousted President Jucobo Ar
benz, and Amnesty International estimates that be
tween March 1982 and July 19N2, 2600 Guatemalans
were executed under Rios Montt's National Plan; in El
Salvador, death squads including members of the U.S.-
trained ORDEN and the elite Atlacatl Battalion have
murdered close to 40,000 people since October 1 979 in
extrajudicial executions or massacres. Of course
popular support for the rebels has not been curtailed in
any of these countries; state terrorism, on the contrary,
has caused their support to increase.
While little documented evidence exists to implicate
U.S. troops or military advisers in actual combat opera
tions, White presents some arresting circumstantial
evidence that raises serious doubts about strict U.S.
noncombatant status. The Air Force's Special Opera
tions commando unit, which flies cargo or saboteurs be
hind enemy lines in unmarked, black-painted airplanes,
participated in the Big Pine operations along the
Honduran-Nicaraguan border. White remarks that
"Their participation in the clandestine war of
Nicaragua, while not documented, is precisely the type
of military operation that they were created to fulfill."
One should recall that the former Reagan-appointed
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
Thomas Enders, directed the secret U.S. bombing of
Cambodia when he was at the U.S. embassy in Phnom
Penh from 1971 to 1974. John Negroponte, currently
ambassador to Honduras, served for three and one-half
years in the Saigon political division of the State De
partment before joining Kissinger's National Security
Council staff after several members resigned in the
spring of 1970 to protest the Cambodia bombing. Al
though Enders has since been fired for insisting on
opening negotations with the Salvadoran guerrillas and
endorsing the Contadora peace plan, CIA director
William Casey and hardliners like Undersecretary of
Defense Fred Ikle and his deputy Nestor Sanchez
clearly have an experienced team in place to direct

clandestine operations. White notes, in fact, that the
decision to replace Enders with William Clark marked
a shift from a "pragmatic" to an "ideological" Central
American policy.
Despite such deja vu, White stops short of naively
suggesting that Central America is another Vietnam.

He asserts instead that the U.S. designed and tested in
Vietnam the eounterinsurgency operations presently
condueted in Central America today. Moreover, he
notes an insidious difference: counterinsurgency opera
tions in Central America (officially called "low inten
sity conflict"), if no more effectual, are more efficient
than in Vietnam — that is, they are more violent, more
brutal, and more devastating to the mostly innocent
people caught up or killed in them.
The conclusion one draws from reading both "The
Morass" and "Trouble in Our Backyard" is that as long
as both liberals and conservatives in the United States
tend to view revolution in Central America as an East-
West confrontation and refuse to recognize its in
digenous and complicated socio-political origins in
poverty, social injustice, and earlier U.S. mistakes in
the region, the U.S. will "undoubtedly find itself drawn
deeper and deeper into the Central American morass,"
a morass resulting in part from the U.S.'s own self
fulfilling prophecies. Whether the U.S. emphasizes
reform or repression, without a significant structural
change in its Central American policy, U.S. interven
tion will produce the same failed outcomes: demonstra
tion elections, nominal reforms, tentative pacification,
and political polarization leading to violent internal
conflict. As President Carters ambassador to El Sal
vador Robert White, a moderate critic of U.S. Central
American policy, has written: "if we continue the reck
less misuse of power that, under Reagan, has allied us
with the military and economic elites, then we will drive
current and potential allies into the Communist camp,
alienate our democratic friends in Europe and Latin
America, and betray our own best values." While both
"The Morass" and "Trouble in Our Backyard" clearly
demonstrate the recklessness of our paternalistic grip
on Central America,"The Morass" in particular shows
that we have already betrayed our own best values —
and our own best neighbors as well.
