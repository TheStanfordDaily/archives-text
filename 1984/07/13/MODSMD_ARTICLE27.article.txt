In the foreword to "Trouble in Our Backyard",
John Womaek, Jr. writes "two struggles have
reached Central America": that between the left
and right, and that of the United States to find
some means to legitimate its paternalistic claim to
direct the affairs of the region. Both the means of
legitimation and the repressive measures to inter
vene in the conflict between the left and right
through counterinsurgency operations are
thoroughly documented and described in Richard
Alan White's "The Morass". These two books
expose the poverty of the so-called "two-track"
plan of U.S. support for reactionary despots in
Central America, and both make clear that con
tinued U.S. adherence to present policies will fur
ther split the left and right within Central Ameri
can countries and lead inevitably to direct U.S.
military intervention.
"Trouble in Our Backyard" takes its title from
U.S. foreign policy statements, and Martin Dis
kin, the editor ot this collection of essays, begins
his introduction by analyzing the origins of the
pretentious and condescending attitude toward
Central America reflected in the phrase "our
backyard." Diskin claims that such an attitude
results in part from the Reagan administration's
reluctance or outright refusal to recognize the in
digenous origins of dissent and revolution in
Central American countries, despite the
availability of scholarship through which it could
construct a realistic policy to ameliorate rather
than exacerbate the complex struggles within the
region. The eight essays that follow the introduc
tion offer a synoptic view of the problems within
the region's economy, a vigorous polemic against
apologists for Reagan's policies, an excellent sum
mary of the Church's role in social transforma
tion. and articles on the socioecotiomicjorigins of

revolution and the U.S. s attempts to thwart it in
El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Hon
duras. Regrettably, however, little mention is
made of Costa Rica, a country which, despite its
tradition of convivencia, is beginning to suffer po
litical and social dissension in the wake of Reagan
administration pressures for President Luis Al
berto Monge to build up his military forces.
The Reagan administration recently targeted
Costa Rica for $8 million worth of "lethal" mili
tary aid, threatening to jeopardize what President
Monge perhaps idealistically calls his country's
"perpetual neutrality." Costa Rica can look to
Honduras, where the U.S. has built up a "Fortress
America" under the auspices of the Big Pine I and
II military "exercises," to see what lies ahead. As
the Honduran civilian government has grown in
creasingly skeptical of, and overshadowed by, the
U.S.-supplied strength of its military, up to 1000
U.S. National Guardsmen and military engineers
have quietly entered Costa Rica to build roads
and expand an airstrip near the Costa Rican-
Nicaraguan border. As Richard Alan White ex
plains in "The Morass," material support for
paramilitary forces — in this case Eden Pastora's
anti-Sandinista troops — typically precedes more
direct and overt U.S. involvement, in accordance
with standard counterinsurgency doctrine.
White's compelling and well-documented anal
ysis of U.S.-sponsored counterinsurgency in
Central America offers what some will consider
disturbing evidence that Reagan administration
policy in Central America is "little more than an
updated version of the counterinsurgency
doctrine developed during the Vietnam War era."
Beginning with what often are only superficial
reforms, counterinsurgency operations attempt to
pacify the poor and victims of social injustice in
order to diminish their support for "subversives."
When attempts at pacification fail, counterinsur
gency doctrine calls for increasingly repressive
measures — including extrajudicial executions
and torture of suspected sympathizers — to stifle
popular support for the rebels. In Vietnam's Op
eration Phoenix, these repressive measures
resulted in the "neutralization" of nearly 20,000
Vietcong sympathizers, 6187 of whom were
killed; in Guatemala, state terrorism has claimed
approximately 80,000 lives since 1954, when a
CIA sponsored coup ousted President Jucobo Ar
