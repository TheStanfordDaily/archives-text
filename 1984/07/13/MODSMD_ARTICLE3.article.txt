# Stanford refuses to attend Labor Commission hearing

### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
A hearing scheduled by the State Labor Com
mission on the Stanford-United Stanford Workers
(USW) dispute was held Wednesday morning,
despite the fact that Stanford representatives
failed to show up.
(The hearing was originally scheduled tor June 20
by Deputy Labor Commissioner Phillip John Gal
vez, but it was postponed until July 11 by Deputy
Labor Commissioner Ray Brady. Before the
postponement of the first hearing, Stanford legal
counsel sent a letter to the State Labor Ottice
claiming the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) had "pre-emptive jurisdiction" in the
matter and that the June 11 hearing was unneces
sary.
Acording to USW counsel Jim Eggleston, a
practically identical letter was hand-delivered to
the State Labor Commission on Wenesday mor
ning â€” in place of an appearance by Stanford rep
resentatives. Members of the Stanford Legal
Counsel were unavailable for comment.
"The letter said that since Stanford thought the
NLRLB had pre-emptive jurisdiction in the mat
ter, they felt they didn't have to show up." Eggles
ton explained.
I he NLRB has scheduled a Stanford-USW
hearing on Sept. 16; since the scheduling of the
hearing, the local branch of the NLRB has recom
mended that an injuction be filed against Stanford
forcing the University to recognize USW up until

the hearing date because "irreparable damage"
was being done to Stanford employees in the ab
sence of a union.
According to Eggleston, Galvez read the Stan
ford letter and then showed it to USW. "It was the
first we heard that Stanford wasn't going to show
up," Eggleston said. "They didn't provide us with
any notice."
After Galvez read the Stanford letter, he
decided to "go ahead and hold the hearing
anyway".
"Everything ran as it was supposed to: we read
our grievances, presented our evidence, and Gal
vez listened," Eggleston said. "Stanford seems to
be pretending that if they ignore the hearing, it
will go away, but things don't work that way. This
was a show-cause hearing, where Stanford was or
dered to show cause why Galvez shouldn't rec
comend to the DA that they be criminally
prosecuted. Stanford really just forfeited their op
portunity to present evidence."
Eggleston said Galvez will decide within a few
weeks whether or not to consider charges against
Stanford. If he decides that USW's complaint is
legitimate, then USW will be offered the opportu
nity to press criminal charges against the Univer
sity, which could result in a fine or imprisonment
for the offending parties. When asked whether he
had ever heard of a university being charged
criminally for labor abuses, Eggleston reponded,
"No, never a university, only private labor com
panies. I don't know if there's a precedent."
