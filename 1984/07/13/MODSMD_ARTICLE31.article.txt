# Hitchcock hangs himself with own 'Rope'
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The most delightful treat
among the Hitchcock movies
reissued over the past year was
the 1956 The Man Who Knew
Too Much, a fuller, more grip
ping version of a story he had
tirst attempted in England 22
years earlier — and of course a
variation on the innoccnt
caught-in-intrigue plot that also
functioned for The 39 Steps,
young and Innocent, Foreign
Correspondent, Saboteur. and
North hy Northwest. And the
greatest disappointment was the
1948 Rope, the rarest of all the
tilms. (Due to copyright compli
cations, it had never been shown
on television or even, to my
knowledge, in revival houses
after its initial release.)
A failure in its time, Rope
nevertheless held a reputation
among Hitchcock huffs as one
of the most daring of his
pictures because it was the most
highly experimental — he shot it
in two takes, more or less,
burying the camera in a dark
spot (like the back of an actor s
jacket) whenever it was neces
sary to reload. Perverse Rope
assuredly is; daring it is not.
When a director celebrated for
his editing techniques — who, as
his critics have said, used to
"edit in the camera" — chooses
to keep his camera in constant
motion, in the restless style Max
Ophuls employed and Robert
Altman would adopt much
later, the results arc unlikely to
be dazzling unless (like Ophuls
and Altman) he has a vision that
demands a floating camera. In
Hitchcock's hands this peculiar

approach to a Patrick Hamilton
play has the effect of making al
ready stage-bound material
even stagier.
Hamilton based his script,
adapted by Arthur Laurents and
Hume Crony n, on the Leopold-
Loeb scandal of the 19205: Two
aesthetes murder a child to
prove they can carry out the
perfect crime. The dramatiza
tion converts the victim into a
comrade of the young men's,
adds a professor (James
Stewart) whose provocative

readings of Nietzsche suggested
the possibility of the murder,
and transpires at a party the kil
lers throw for the father and
fiancee of the dead boy, who
resides throughout in a chest in
the middle of the room. He has
retained, unspoken, the
homosexual relationship be
tween the Leopold and Loeb
characters, the sarcastic, self
possessed Brandon (John Dall)
and the nervous, vulnerable
Philip (Farley Granger, whose
moment would not come until

Hitchcock cast him opposite
Robert Walker in the unforget
table Strangers on a Train three
years later).
If all this sounds entertaining,
in a ghoulishly civilized fashion,
it's far too overstated and hys
terical and self-conscious to
work. Instead of marvelling at
the filmmakers' cleverness, we
keep thinking about how clever
they seem to think they are.
Rope is the precursor of all
those iron-deficient let's-talk

about-murder plays "Dial 'M'
for Murder" (which Hitchcock
filmed in 1954), "Sleuth,"
"Deathtrap" — which are to the
best Hitchcock mysteries ap
proximately what a movie like
Flashdance is to musicals: a
negation of the genre.
Though Hitchcock had no
surpassing sensitivity to actors,
we otten recall performers in his
films with pleasure, and occa
sionally, at a reviewing, they
catch us by surprise. (I'd forgot
ten how good Barbara Bel
Geddes was in Vertigo, or how
convincingly Doris Day played
the scene in The Man Who
Knew Too Much in which her
husband, James Stewart, tells
her their son has been kid
naped.) But in Rope, where
the characters talk and talk and
there's no editing to distract us,
we're forced to focus on the ac
tors at all times. And because
Dall and Granger give essen
tially one-note performances,
we grow impatient with them
and take to staring at the sofas
or the cutlery or the (badly
painted) backdrop outside the
window — that is, until Jimmy
Stewart gets his chance to chew
up all that decor. In the last half
hour, waxing indignant over the
boys' wanton misapplication of
his humanistic teachings, he
gives the most ludicrous exhibi
tion of eye-rolling bad acting
since his very early work in
After the Thin Man (before he'd
really become Jimmy Stewart).
Watching it, you wonder if it
could have been Stewart himself
who kept Rope out of circula
tion all these years.
