Body Heat (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
The hero and heroine of this
misbegotten imitation of a James
Cain thriller, played by William
Hurt and Kathleen Turner (who
later parodied this performance
in The Man with Two Brains),
talk like refugees from a 1940s
film noir, but no one else in the
movie seems to find it odd. Per
haps the heat, both real and
sexual, has addled everyone's
brain — especially the writer
director Lawrence Kasdan's.
Lest you miss the point, he puts
some red-hot thing — the sun, or
a flaming cigarette — in almost
every shot. This idiotic, broiled
melodrama satisfied a surpris
ingly large number of
moviegoers, though the only
sparks of life in it are the perfor
mances of Mickey Rourke (as an
arsonist) and Ted Danson as
Hurt's partner. Richard Crenna
plays Turner's dullish husband.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.

The Thin Man (1934)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Most people have forgotten
who the murderer is in this fa
mous adaptation of the Dashiell
Hammett novel, but not who the
detectives are: Nick and Nora
Charles, the most elegant sleuth
ing combination in the history of
movies. Never without a highball
or a hon mot. they suavely killed
off the stagebound, schematic
thrillers of the early talkie per
iod, and became so popular that
five sequels were made (the last
one in 1947). (An amusing bit of
trivia: the title alludes to a detail
of the mystery, but it caught on
so fast that all the follow-ups had
The Thin Man stuck, irrelevant
ly, in their titles.) William Powell
and Myrna Loy proved to be so
good together (and such a smash
at the box office) that they
teamed on several other films,
too, including The Great Zieg
feld, in which he played the cele
brated impresario and she
played Billie Burke. Screenplay
(a smart one) by Frances
Goodrich and Albert Hackett;
W.S.Van Dyke directed (more
deftly than usual). With
Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat
Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Ed
ward Ellis, Porter Hall, Cesar
Romero, Edward Brophy and
others.
Plays Tuesday with
Confidentially Yours.
Triumph of the Will (1936)
Cubberley Auditorium
Leni Riefenstahl fuses Greek,
Roman, Norse and Anglo-Saxon
mythology as well as biblical im

agery in this most famous and
most disturbing of all
propaganda films, dedicated to
the deification of Adolf Hitler.
The crowd sequences are in a
class with the ride of the Klan in
Griffith's The Birth of a Nation,
and one shot of soldiers' arms
raised simultaneously in salute
like so many self-propelled
playing cards is one of the most
startling images in the history of
cinema. This movie still holds so
much power that it offers an un
equalled magnetic-repellent
viewing experience. It's great,
despicable art.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
An American in Paris (1951)
Festival, Palo Alto
In a year that yielded A Street
car Named Desire, A Place in the
Sun and The African Queen, the
Academy Award for Best
Picture went to this sunny M-G-
M musical, written by Alan Jay
Lerner and directed by Vincente

Minnelli. The film was built
around the music of George
Gershwin (lyrics, of course, by
Ira), and though its planned
highlight, a 20-minute ballet to
the "American in Paris" suite
designed in the styles of half a
dozen impressionist painters, is
overloaded and pretentious, the
rest of it is truly in the Gershwin
spirit. (The songs include "'S
Wonderful." "Tra-La-La," "I
Got Rhythm" and "By
Strauss.") Gene Kelly got the
quintessential Gene Kelly role as
the American painter in Paris:
he dances a memorable pas de
deux with Leslie Caron to "Love
Is Here to Stay." With Oscar
Levant, Nina Foch and Georges
Guetary, whose performance of
"I'll Build a Stairway to
Paradise" defines, as much as
Chevalier did in the 19305,
American audiences' notion of
French urbanity.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Red Shoes.
The Dresser (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Director Peter Yates
demonstrates so much affection
for the frustrations of the rag
taggle Shakespearean troupe
traveling through the provinces
of war-torn London that for long
stretches of the movie we forget
what it's really about — the ef
forts of Norman (Tom Cour
tenay), personal dresser to an
aging, shell-shocked knight
(Albert Finney), to keep his
charge functioning throughout
one particularly trying perfor
mance of "King Lear." The

central drama (adapted by
Ronald Harwood from his stage
success) is drearily flamboyant,
full of pregnant moments and
grandiloquent revelations, and
focused on Tom Courtenay's
atrociously masochistic perfor
mance. But there is merry
humor in the backstage se
quences that nearly offsets the
desiccated bitterness of Nor
man's tirades, and Albert Finney
is highly enjoyable.
Plays Wednesday with
Tootsie.

Breathless (1960)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"It's normal: squealers squeal,
burglars burgle, killers kill and
lovers love," says Michel Poic
card (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the
hero of Jean-Luc Godard's
vivifying film, one of the
landmarks of the French New
Wave. Like Truffaut in Shoot the
Piano Player, Godard recasts the
American gangster pictures so
beloved of post-war French
audiences in a new, startling
mold that is at once jokey, self
referential, and unsettling. The
main characters, Michel and his
beautiful, morally blank
girlfriend Patricia (Jean Seberg),
are in love with style. A great
film, with a hypnotic perfor
mance from Belmondo.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with Diva.
Sleeper (1973)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Woody Aliens mostly visual
futuristic comedy is consistently
funny but never takes off into
the far-out realm of the craziest
sequences in Bananas and
Everything You Always Wanted
to Know About Sex. He plays the
owner of a health food store who
is frozen in the 20th century and
wakes up in the 21st; the first
thing he learns is that junk food,
scientists have discovered, is
really good for you. With Diane
Keaton, who does a memorable
imitation of Brando in A Street
car Named Desire, John Beck
and Mary Gregory. Marshall
Brickman co-wrote the
screenplay.
Plays Thursday with
Broadway Dannv Rose.

Local Hero (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Utterly charming. That clever
minimalist comic actor. Peter
Riegert, plays ari oil company
executive who tlies to Scotland
to buy up a village so that his
firm can set up a refinery on the
land — and the village turns out
to be almost as magical as
Brigadoon. Living in a breath
taking landscape, under a
showplace sky where meteor
showers erupt and the aurora
borealis makes guest appear
ances, the citizens have estab
lished an entirely peaceful,
laissez-faire society where a \ery
strange mix of people co-exists
harmoniously. The Scottish
writer-director. Bill Forsyth,
keeps his camera at a discreet
distance, so that what happens
up on screen seems peculiarly
self-contained, and the unrushed
scenes snap back at you with a
delayed comic spring. The cast is
impeccable; among its gems are
Denis Lawson, Peter Capaldi,
and especially Burt Lancaster.
He's only in a few scenes (he
plays the oil company chief), but
he embodies the quirkily
benevolent spirit of the movie.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Splash.
The Autobiography of Miss
Jane Pittman (1973)
New Varsity. Palo Alto
Tracy Keenan Wynn's adapta
tion of the Ernest J. Gaines
novel about a one-time slave
who, at the age of 1 10, par
ticipates in a civil rights
demonstration, directed with

tact and sensitivity by John
Korty and starring Cicely Tyson.
Originally made for American
television, this extremely affect
ing drama was subsequently
released in theaters in Europe
and now enjoys (roughly) the
status of a theatrical film. Tyson
gives a near-great performance;
it's one of her three unforget
table roles. (The others: Rebec
ca in Sounder and Harriet Tub
man in the made-for-television
A Woman Called Moses.)
Plays tomorrow.

Strange Invaders (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Michael Laughlin's sci-fi
movie (written by Laughlin and
William Condon) is obviously
intended to be a parody, but
maybe he got too close to the
tackiness he wanted to send up.
because most of it isn't funny —
just weird, as if the aliens had su
pervised the picture. Paul Le
Mat, Nancy Allen, Diana Scar
wid and Louise Fletcher are the
talented stars who sit around
waiting for someone to explain
the joke to them.
Plays Monday with Close
Encounters of the Third Kind.
Confidentially Yours (1984)
Bijou. Palo Alto
In this comic murder mystery
adapted by Francois Truffaut,
Suzanne Schiffman and Jean
Aurel from a Charles Williams
novel, Jean-Louis Trintignant
plays a real estate agent
suspected of killing his wife and
her lover, and the lovely Fanny
Ardant is his secretary, whose
aid Trintignant enlists to prove
his innocence. Truffaut employs
a deliberately artificial style to
unravel the plot, staging one
murder in an exaggerated
theatrical manner and placing
the characters' most important
revelations at odd moments that
retard the normal escalation of
suspense. Perhaps he intended
this approach as an affectionate
framing of the film, but since the
material is already inconsequen
tial, putting quotes around it in
this peculiar way has the effect
of reducing it still further. Trin
ginant and Ardant share some
funny moments in the adversary
inevit ably-turned-lover roles,
but they aren't really right for
them.
Plays Tuesday with The Thin
Man.
The Bounty (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Starting from an unusual
source — Richard Hough's book
"Captain Bligh and Mr. Chris
tian," rather than the romantic
adventure novels by Nordhoff
and Hall that spawned the two
earlier film versions, both called

Mutiny on the Bounty — director
Roger ' Donaldson and
screenwriter Robert Bolt build
two fascinating psychological
portraits. Bligh (Anthony Hop
kins) is a man driven by
thwarted pride and ambition to
conduct himself in an unreason
able, inhumane fashion; Chris
tian (Mel Gibson) is an im
mature younger man who rebels
against an older friend standing
in loco parentis. The crux of the
conflict between these two is
that Christian is not the man

Bligh thought him, and the dis
crepancy between Bligh's
idealized image of him — in
formed at least in part by a
homoerotic interest — and
Christian's real nature, causes
Bligh so much mental anguish
that he begins to behave cruelly
toward his friend and toward the
sailors who respect and admire
Christian. The first half of the
film is problematic, because Bolt
originally planned two
screenplays to chronicle the talc
of the Bounty's journey to
Tahiti, the mutiny, and the sepa
rate fates of Bligh and Christian,
and consequently the movie
feels compressed and frustrat
ingly episodic. But it you have
the patience to ride out the first
hour, your trust pays off. With
fine performances by Hopkins,
Gibson, Wi kuki Kaa, Tevaite
Vernette and Philip Martin
Brown.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Breaker Moroni.
Footsie (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The first comedy ever made
about sex roles with ideas that
you don't feel embarrassed
about discussing afterwards.
Dustin Hoffman plays Michael
Dorsey, a gifted actor and
teacher of acting who shows up
at an audition dressed and made
up as a woman and lands a part
in a daytime soap. The movie
starts out in the tradition of
Some Like It Hot, but it grows
and grows: as Michael gets him
self deeper and deeper into this
sexual and professional decep
tion, he has to exercise all his ac
tor's wiles to keep up with the
game, while he is discovering
layers of sensitivity in himself he
never knew existed. Sydney Pol
lack has done a marvelous job of
shaping a first-rate script by Lar
ry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal
(and uncredited others), and he
affirms his reputation as a fine
actor's director: Hoffman, Jes
sica l.ange. Bill Murray, Teri
Garr, Charles Durning, George
Gaynor and Pollack himself all
turn in excellent performances.
Plays Wednesday with The
Dresser.
