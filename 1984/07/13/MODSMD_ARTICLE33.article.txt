Smog shrouds Olympics
Los Angeles — Even the worst air pollution will
lorce no Olympic events to be rescheduled, chief
Olympic organizer Peter Ueberroth promised yes
terday during the longest July smog wave in 10
years.
Jim Birakos, deputy executive director of the Air
Quality Management District, said that in the 19
days since June 23 there have been IS days of smog
alerts, but the smog hasn't been as heavy as in past
air-pollution sieges.
Birakos noted that one year they had smog alerts
called simultaneously in 23 areas of the four-county
South Coast Air Basin, while the current siege is
averaging only around five areas per day. Nine alerts
were called yesterday.
Olympic endurance events are scheduled to miss
peak smog times and places, but an 1 1 a.m. alert
such as yesterday's could catch women marathoners
as they straggle into the Coliseum on Saturday, Aug.

UK, Nigeria expel envoys
London — Britain declared Nigeria's ambassador
unwelcome yesterday and expelled two of its
diplomats in retaliation for a bizarre attempt to kid
nap an exiled Nigerian politician. The West Atrican
country responded by announcing the expulsion ot
two British diplomats.
Britain stopped short of a break in diplomatic ties
with Nigeria, its chief African trading partner, or an

Haldu Hananiya.
Hananiya flew to Lagos, the Nigerian capital,
Wednesday for consultations with his government,
and Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told Parli
ament it would be "inappropriate" for the ambassa
dor to return.
Nigeria has denied involvement in the attempted
abduction of former Nigerian Transport Minister
Umaru Dikko, who was found drugged and uncon
scious July 5 in a crate that was to be loaded onto a
Nigerian-bound cargo plane at Stansted Airport
outside London. Dikko heads the list of former
Nigerian officials accused of corruption by the mili
tary regime that seized power in a New Year's Eve
coup.
Howe said Scotland Yard's investigation
"disclosed evidence that appears to implicate the
Nigerian High Commission (Embassy)," and the
Nigerian government refused to allow police to
question embassy staff members.
Bonn signs US arms pact
Washington — The United States and West Ger
many signed an agreement yesterday boosting joint
anti-aircraft defenses at their European military
bases, but Bonn's defense minister made clear his
opposition to Senate pressure for greater European
defense spending.
Manfred Woerner, the German official, said at a
news conference that an unsuccesssful Senate effort
to force other members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to increase their defense spending or
face a reduction in U.S. funding sent "the wrong sig
nal to Moscow."

NASA to combine flights
Washington — The maiden flight of the space
shuttle Discovery will take place Aug. 24 or later
and will combine missions the craft was to have per
formed during its aborted June flight and one
originally scheduled for Aug. 29, space agency offi
cials said yesterday.
They said the new schedule was designed to mini
mize delays stemming from an engine failure that
caused the June 25 launch to abort with just four
seconds left on the countdown.
Jesse Moore, head of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's shuttle program, said at
a news conference that he is now certain that the
engine failure was caused by a contaminant rather
than a basic mechanical problem.
As a result, he said, there is no need for a time
consuming "tear-down" of the entire shuttle assem
bly. Instead, he said, the Discovery's No. 3 engine
will simply be replaced by a spare that has un
dergone complete testing.
The reliability of the space shuttle and the turn
around time involved in preparing the reusable vehi
cle for launch after it returns from space have been
key concerns of both the military and the shuttle
program's commercial customers.
Today's weather outlook
Sunny and hot. Highs from the 70s to near-102
well inland. Westerly afternoon winds 10 mph to 20
mph. Fair and continued warm tonight and tomor
row. Lows in the 50s to mid-60s and highs in the
mid-70s to near-105.
