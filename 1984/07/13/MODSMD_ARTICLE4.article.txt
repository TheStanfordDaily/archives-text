# Bechtel, McKenna to clash in election
## 
### VINCE LARKIN 
Transportation, environment
and housing are the key issues in
this years campaign for Santa
Clara County Supervisor from
the district which includes Stan
ford.
The Nov. (S run-off election
pits two Democrats, Betsy Be
chtel und Dianne McKenna,
against cach nthtst fitr litis nori
partisan seat. Bechtel. a former

mayor of Palo Alto, ran first
among four candidates in the
June 5 primary with 25,114
votes. McKenna, a former Sun
nyvale mayor, was a close
second with 23,506.
Both are considered liberals
and both have creative ideas for
solutions to the county's prob
lems.
A half-cent sales tax has been
proposed to finance improve
ments in Highways 101, 85 and
237. Bechtel has not endorsed
the bill in its present form. She
will only support the bill if the
new lanes added to 101 and 237
are designated as two-person
commuter lanes. "I'm con
cerned if we just add to
freeways, in five years we'll be
right back where we are now in
terms of congested freeways,"
she said.
McKenna supports the pres
ent bill, and is pleased that
many of her suggestions have
been incorporated into an
amended version of it. One of
the conditions she suggested
stipulates that money from the
tax will only be used for those
three highways.
Both candidates support a
light rail system for the county.
Both believe something must be
done to encourage people to use
mass transit.
Both candidates also believe
in the preservation of open
space.
Bechtel wants to slow growth
in the countv while adding new

housing units in the cities. She
supports a creative mixed
housing format in which con
dominiums and businesses
would be encouraged to share
buildings.
McKenna ran on an open
space platform when she was
mayor of Sunnyvale. She is a
strong, hcVicvev \rÂ» vVvc v a\uc o\
ufvu apovt. / uiii ci regular user
of Rancho San Antonio," she
said. '1 jog there often. 1 know
what open space means in terms
of passive or active recreation."
Bechtel and McKenna both
believe the safety of the
county's citizens is the most im
portant consideration in dealing
with the toxic waste problem.
But they seem to be at odds on
how solutions should be reached
for the future.
Bechtel has issued a four
point comprehensive plan for
toxic chemicals. The plan calls
for water monitoring, evaluating
health risks, improving
responses to injuries, and plan
ning for storage. She also wants
more governmental involve
ment. She would like to see the

Environmental Protection
Agency provide more emer
gency funding.
Bechtel believes it is time for
everyone to stop passing blame
onto others. " We need to get on
with the clean-up of particular
spills," she said. She also
believes communication be
tween governmental agencies
needs to be improved.
McKenna said education is
the answer to avoiding similar
problems in the future. "The
problem is that some people get
their water from public wells,
some from private wells and
some from outside the county,"
she noted. She said everyone
