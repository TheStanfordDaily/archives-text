# Bechtel, McKenna to clash in election
## 
### VINCE LARKIN 
Transportation, environment
and housing are the key issues in
this years campaign for Santa
Clara County Supervisor from
the district which includes Stan
ford.
The Nov. (S run-off election
pits two Democrats, Betsy Be
chtel und Dianne McKenna,
against cach nthtst fitr litis nori
partisan seat. Bechtel. a former

mayor of Palo Alto, ran first
among four candidates in the
June 5 primary with 25,114
votes. McKenna, a former Sun
nyvale mayor, was a close
second with 23,506.
Both are considered liberals
and both have creative ideas for
solutions to the county's prob
lems.
A half-cent sales tax has been
proposed to finance improve
ments in Highways 101, 85 and
237. Bechtel has not endorsed
the bill in its present form. She
will only support the bill if the
new lanes added to 101 and 237
are designated as two-person
commuter lanes. "I'm con
cerned if we just add to
freeways, in five years we'll be
right back where we are now in
terms of congested freeways,"
she said.
McKenna supports the pres
ent bill, and is pleased that
many of her suggestions have
been incorporated into an
amended version of it. One of
the conditions she suggested
stipulates that money from the
tax will only be used for those
three highways.
Both candidates support a
light rail system for the county.
Both believe something must be
done to encourage people to use
mass transit.
Both candidates also believe
in the preservation of open
space.
Bechtel wants to slow growth
in the countv while adding new

housing units in the cities. She
supports a creative mixed
housing format in which con
dominiums and businesses
would be encouraged to share
buildings.
McKenna ran on an open
space platform when she was
mayor of Sunnyvale. She is a
strong, hcVicvev \r» vVvc v a\uc o\
ufvu apovt. / uiii ci regular user
of Rancho San Antonio," she
said. '1 jog there often. 1 know
what open space means in terms
of passive or active recreation."
Bechtel and McKenna both
believe the safety of the
county's citizens is the most im
portant consideration in dealing
with the toxic waste problem.
But they seem to be at odds on
how solutions should be reached
for the future.
Bechtel has issued a four
point comprehensive plan for
toxic chemicals. The plan calls
for water monitoring, evaluating
health risks, improving
responses to injuries, and plan
ning for storage. She also wants
more governmental involve
ment. She would like to see the

Environmental Protection
Agency provide more emer
gency funding.
Bechtel believes it is time for
everyone to stop passing blame
onto others. " We need to get on
with the clean-up of particular
spills," she said. She also
believes communication be
tween governmental agencies
needs to be improved.
McKenna said education is
the answer to avoiding similar
problems in the future. "The
problem is that some people get
their water from public wells,
some from private wells and
some from outside the county,"
she noted. She said everyone


Betsy Bechtel


Dianne McKenna
should have the right to know
the components of their water
and its source.
Bechtel and McKenna are not
newcomers to local politics.
Both have been mayors of
growing communities. Bechtel
served one term as Palo Alto's
mayor. A popular figure in

town, she has more than 15
years of experience in commu
nity service. Bechtel worked as
an executive assistant to former
county supervisor Gerry Stein
berg.
Bechtel said she has greater
experience on the county level
than her opponent. "The prob
lems are very different on the
county level than on the city
level," she said.
McKenna served two terms as
mayor of Sunnyvale. Her

mayoral experience is more ex
tensive than that of Bechtel.
Sunnyvale is a conservative
community. Because of this, her
stands in favor of low and
moderate-income housing led to
efforts to recall her from office.
Because she survived the
recall vote, McKenna feels she
brings a toughness to the job
that her opponent lacks. "It's
easy," she said, "to be an en
vironmentalist in Palo Alto.
Those issues are very popular

there."' She pointed out that it
took seven years ot fighting to
get a curb-side recycling project
for her citv. McKenna also said
she has more experience in top
policy-making than her op
ponent. McKenna has a B.S. in
behavioral sciences and a
Master s degree in urban plan
ning from San Jose State.
Bechtel believes her chances
will improve if more Stanford
voters participate in the Nov. 6
run-off election.

She noted that the coun
tywide turnout in the first round
of voting was 43 percent, hut
that only 30 percent of Stan
ford's registered voters partici
pated in the election. The Be
chtel camp is also not impressed
by the cute refrigerator magnets
that McKenna mailed to many
would-be voters. "Just some
one's name is not enough for the
intelligent voter to decide," said
BechtePs campaign manager.

Bechtel believes her chances
will improve if more Stanford
voters participate in the Nov. 6
run-off election.

She noted that the coun
tywide turnout in the first round
of voting was 43 percent, hut
that only 30 percent of Stan

pated in the election. The Be

by the cute refrigerator magnets
that McKenna mailed to many
would-be voters. "Just some

Transportation, environment
and housing are the key issues in
this years campaign for Santa
Clara County Supervisor from
the district which includes Stan
ford.
The Nov. (S run-off election
pits two Democrats, Betsy Be
chtel und Dianne McKenna,
against cach nthtst fitr litis nori
partisan seat. Bechtel. a former

mayor of Palo Alto, ran first
among four candidates in the
June 5 primary with 25,114
votes. McKenna, a former Sun
nyvale mayor, was a close
second with 23,506.
Both are considered liberals
and both have creative ideas for
solutions to the county's prob
lems.
A half-cent sales tax has been
proposed to finance improve
ments in Highways 101, 85 and
237. Bechtel has not endorsed
the bill in its present form. She
will only support the bill if the
new lanes added to 101 and 237
are designated as two-person
commuter lanes. "I'm con
cerned if we just add to
freeways, in five years we'll be
right back where we are now in
terms of congested freeways,"
she said.
McKenna supports the pres
ent bill, and is pleased that
many of her suggestions have
been incorporated into an
amended version of it. One of
the conditions she suggested
stipulates that money from the
tax will only be used for those
three highways.
Both candidates support a
light rail system for the county.
Both believe something must be
done to encourage people to use
mass transit.
Both candidates also believe
in the preservation of open
space.
Bechtel wants to slow growth
in the countv while adding new

housing units in the cities. She
supports a creative mixed
housing format in which con
dominiums and businesses
would be encouraged to share
buildings.
McKenna ran on an open
space platform when she was
mayor of Sunnyvale. She is a
strong, hcVicvev \r» vVvc v a\uc o\
ufvu apovt. / uiii ci regular user
of Rancho San Antonio," she
said. '1 jog there often. 1 know
what open space means in terms
of passive or active recreation."
Bechtel and McKenna both
believe the safety of the
county's citizens is the most im
portant consideration in dealing
with the toxic waste problem.
But they seem to be at odds on
how solutions should be reached
for the future.
Bechtel has issued a four
point comprehensive plan for
toxic chemicals. The plan calls
for water monitoring, evaluating
health risks, improving
responses to injuries, and plan
ning for storage. She also wants
more governmental involve
ment. She would like to see the

Environmental Protection
Agency provide more emer
gency funding.
Bechtel believes it is time for
everyone to stop passing blame
onto others. " We need to get on
with the clean-up of particular
spills," she said. She also
believes communication be
tween governmental agencies
needs to be improved.
McKenna said education is
the answer to avoiding similar
problems in the future. "The
problem is that some people get
their water from public wells,
some from private wells and
some from outside the county,"
she noted. She said everyone


Betsy Bechtel


Dianne McKenna
should have the right to know
the components of their water
and its source.
Bechtel and McKenna are not
newcomers to local politics.
Both have been mayors of
growing communities. Bechtel
served one term as Palo Alto's
mayor. A popular figure in

town, she has more than 15
years of experience in commu
nity service. Bechtel worked as
an executive assistant to former
county supervisor Gerry Stein
berg.
Bechtel said she has greater
experience on the county level
than her opponent. "The prob
lems are very different on the
county level than on the city
level," she said.
McKenna served two terms as
mayor of Sunnyvale. Her

mayoral experience is more ex
tensive than that of Bechtel.
Sunnyvale is a conservative
community. Because of this, her
stands in favor of low and
moderate-income housing led to
efforts to recall her from office.
Because she survived the
recall vote, McKenna feels she
brings a toughness to the job
that her opponent lacks. "It's
easy," she said, "to be an en
vironmentalist in Palo Alto.
Those issues are very popular

there."' She pointed out that it
took seven years ot fighting to
get a curb-side recycling project
for her citv. McKenna also said
she has more experience in top
policy-making than her op
ponent. McKenna has a B.S. in
behavioral sciences and a
Master s degree in urban plan
ning from San Jose State.
Bechtel believes her chances
will improve if more Stanford
voters participate in the Nov. 6
run-off election.

She noted that the coun
tywide turnout in the first round
of voting was 43 percent, hut
that only 30 percent of Stan
ford's registered voters partici
pated in the election. The Be
chtel camp is also not impressed
