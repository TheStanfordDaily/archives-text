## Ferraro choice lifts Mondale campaign 
### 
Washington — With his historic selec
tion of a woman as his running mate,
Walter Mondale struck fire to a sputter
ing campaign yesterday and sent
strategists of both parties scurrying to
appraise the long-term impact of this un
precedented move.
Democrats of all stripes agreed that
what Mondale called his "exciting

choice" of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (D-
N.Y.) showed uncommon boldness in the
normally cautious Minnesotan. Man\
said it would energize next week's Dem
ocratic National Convention in San
Francisco and shatter the sense of
deteatism that had been gathering
around Mondale's candidacy in recent
weeks.
Some Southern Democrats expressed
concern because both nominees are
liberals, but the overwhelming Demo
cratic reaction was enthusiastic.
President Reagan, questioned fre
quently about the development during a
trip to Kentucky, declined to comment
directly on Mondale's choice of Ferraro.
but said, "I'm looking forward to run
ning against and campaigning against the
Democratic ticket."
Asked it he thought it was "sort of his
toric." Reagan responded, "Yeah, like

appointing Sandra Day O'Connor to the
Supreme Court" — Reagan's feminist
"first."
A senior aide in Reagan's re-election
campaign said selection of the three
term Queens congresswoman makes
Mondale's uphill race against the incum
bent "look doable," bv strengthening the
Democrats' appeal to Italian-Americans
and possibly other Catholic ethnic
groups, by making the Northeastern

states more competitive and by focusing
renewed attention on a "gender gap"
that Reagan had seemed to be closing.
Officially, Reagan campaign spokes
man James Lake said that when voters
focus on the comparative experience and
readiness of Ferraro and Vice President
George Bush to occupy the Oval Office,
"we expect to do very well."
Republican officials said their private
polls showed that the selection of the

first woman on a major-party national
ticket was "a wash" politically, adding
some female votes to the Democratic
ticket but subtracting some male votes.
There were indications that Ferraro
might swing some independent and Re
publican women away from Reagan.
"I'm wearing my Ferraro button. |
think every woman in America has been
waiting to see this day," said Betsy Grif
fin, a longtime Republican activist and
feminist. "I'm having a harder and
harder time thinking of a reason to vote
for Ronald Reagan."
Mary Louise Smith, a former GOP na
tional chair, said that "Republican wo
men welcome this," and that she hoped
the move would give party moderates
leverage in "making our party more
sensitive and positve to making women
full partners."
Oddly enough, the most favorable
comments about Ferraro came from
men. perhaps because she is the kind of
savvy woman politician about whom men
feel most comfortable.
"This is high noon at gender gap," said
Robert Squier, a prominent Democratic
media expert, who said the move "gives
Mondale something he has never had
before: a passionate bunch of followers."
