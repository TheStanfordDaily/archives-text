# Protests greet Falwell forum
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” Nearly
2000 people, some of them
throwing rocks and bottles,
jammed Union Square yester
day as a protest against Jerry
Falwell's Moral Majority con
ference came "close to becom
ing a mob," police said.
Police said the demonstration
signaled the beginning of a se
ries of protests planned around
the Democratic National Con
vention next week.
"As far as we're concerned, it
began today," said Sgt. Michael
Pera, a police spokesman.
At least eight arrests were
made and medics reported
treating eight people, including
a female medic who allegedly
was hit over the head with a
police baton as she was helping
an injured demonstrator.
"They have a real aggressive
attitude toward the
demonstrators. I feel they lost
control," said Mary Isham, one
of 16 People's Medics at the
scene. "You don't hit a medic
from behind. That was
provocative."

The medic, Naomi Schapiro
of San Francisco, was treated
for a head wound at Children's
Hospital and released, an emer
gency room spokeswoman said.
As the crowd pushed to the
police barricade around Union
Square, police issued a declara
tion of unlawful assembly,
warning the demonstrators to
retreat into the city's fas
hionable square.
More than 200 police were in
full riot gear, including 17
mounted patrolmen whose
horses were nearly nose-to-nose
with protesters who shouted in
sults at police.
Six people were arrested after
protesters dragged garbage cans
into the street and blocked an
intersection, said Deputy Chief
George Eimil. One police offi
cer suffered minor injuries
during the demonstration, he
said.
Earlier, two people were ar
rested after "somebody belted
one of our motorcycle guys,"
said Capt. Richard Shippey, in
charge of police tactical units.
