# Arms talks proposal
## USSR seeks firm answer 
### 
Moscow — The Soviet Union said yesterday
that it has yet to receive a positive U.S. reply to
its proposal to negotiate a ban on antisatellite
and antiballistic space missile systems.
An editorial, intended for publication in
today's edition of the Communist Party news
paper Pravda, asserted that Reagan adminis
tration officials were "creating the impression
that they are all but packing their bags to go to
Vienna" despite the fact that Washington has
not formally agreed to Moscow's proposed
agenda for the September negotiations.
The editorial, distributed in advance by the
official news agency Tass, said "serious talks
are impossible if it is not clear what precisely
the sides are going to discuss and to reach
agreement on."
In Washington, a senior State Department
official said a public statement by the Soviets,
such as the Pravda editorial, "is designed to
give them flexibility" so that if they later
decide not to go to Vienna, they have "built a
public stage for it." He emphasized that the
Reagan administration does not think the
public announcements represent a final posi
tion but rather that the Kremlin is "still think
ing it through."
As for the formal exchange of written notes,
a White House official earlier this week said
that the United States had yet to receive a
response through diplomatic channels to its

message delivered June 29 to Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin. The senior official added
that the United States has been addressing the
proposed Vienna meeting "in diplomatic chan
nels."
"What is needed first and foremost is mutual
understanding" on the agenda, it said, noting
that Moscow has proposed to discuss a ban on
the offensive space weapons. The Reagan ad
ministration's only official response was that it
planned to raise the issue of strategic and
medium-range nuclear arms and discuss "some
aspects" of possible curbs on antisatellite sys
tems, the editorial added.
"A fortnight has already passed since that
(Soviet) proposal was conveyed to the White
House," Pravda said. "No positive response
has come as yet. At the same time, they in the
U.S. capital are creating the impression that
they are all but packing their bags to go to
Vienna and are trying to feign support for the
proposed talks, although in reality they do not
want them." Despite public pronouncements
by senior U.S. figures that the administration
was not setting any preconditions, Moscow has
not received any formal notification of Wash
ington's position to that effect.
"In other words, they in Washington behave
as if they are going to talk to themselves," the
editorial said.
