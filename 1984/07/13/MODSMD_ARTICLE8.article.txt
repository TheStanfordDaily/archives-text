## John Mark Agosta Lagrange multipliers let economists sleep easy 
### 
Every now and again I am reminded
that graduate and undergraduate educa
tion are different. Many things you learn
as an undergraduate you will unlearn as a
graduate. Here is a case from a basic cal
culus textbooks discussion on optimiza
tion methods. If you've studied this sub
ject, you know that the solution gives
you not only the point you're looking for,
but also a set of numbers known as
"Lagrange multipliers." In the words of
the authors of the text: The associated
values of lambda, called Lagrange multi
pliers, may come out in the wash but are
usually not of much interest to us.
Should I read "us" as beginning engi
neering students? Then a little learning
could be a dangerous thing. As a part of
economics, the multipliers have been the
spring of a fertile field of study. This
quote has provided unlimited amuse
ment ranging from peals of laughter to
mild disbelief to all in my department. In
fact, you may say that several depart
ment members have written theses and
then pursued academic careers from
careful scrutiny and tender care of that
which so to speak "comes out in the
wash."
So, with this introduction 1 hope 1 have
motivated an explanation of these pur
portedly subtle and mysterious objects.
Here goes: Imagine (with what other
word would a mathematical explanation
begin? Just as you may be assured that
"imagine" signals the beginning of the
technical section, you may rest assured
that this explanation is woefully inade
quate for the subject at hand.) You have
a formula to calculate value — any mea
sure will do — and you want the combi
nation of inputs to the formula giving the
best value and, in addition, the inputs
themselves must not exceed certain
limits.
In the general form, we've all faced
this one: For instance, consider a family
with a family car shared by its members.
The well-being of the family depends on
how the car is shared. Clearly the more
any one member gets to use it, the better

off they, and let's say the family as a col
leetive, becomes. The rub is that there is
only one car and only one person at a
time may use it.
One way to solve this problem is to
have each family member list, or more
likely vigorously propose, the contribu
tion their use of the car will make to the
clan. Mom or Dad then orders the list,
sorts the suggested uses into those ac
cepted and rejected and enforces the
results. Yet there is another way to solve
this same problem. Mom or dad could
look over the lists and propose a level of
trade-off of family benefit per use of the
car. Then everyone would select those
errands, trips and so on that met or
exceeded the proposed trade-off. The
trade-off level would have to be ad justed
so that the car got just the right amount
of use.
I call the first method the dictatorial
solution and the latter one the
decentralized solution. For reasons
buried in history, these have been called
"prima!" and "dual" solutions. The
mathematical insight that links them is
that both methods solve the same prob
lem. You can either select the allocations
directly that implicitly give the trade-off
level each allocation must meet, or you
can find the level of trade-off that when
applied gives the correct allocations. The
two methods, however, suggest very dif
ferent behaviors in the way people come
to agreement.
This story about use of the car is by na
ture similar to all economic problems. It
is solved by the method of constrained
optimization. Some people would main
tain that all economic problems are in
stances of constrained optimization. So
to get back to where we started: How do
those multipliers from the optimization
problem figure in economic problems?
Succinctly, they are prices. In an eco
nomic problem, you are trying to maxi
mize a value, e.g. utility, subject to con
straints on supplies, labor, or whatever.
The trade-offs that are made are em
bodied in the prices — you know the

prices and you know the allocations that
maximize your value.
Now I hope you realize the übi
quitousness of Lagrange multipliers.
Open to the stock market section of a
daily newspaper and what do you see?
You guessed it! Thousands of bodacious
Lagrange multipliers. Consider the shop
per who shops around comparing prices.
They're taking their Lagrange multi
pliers very seriously, just as the stock
tape-watcher does. Both ot them know
that they can sove their maximization
problem bv sob int.* "the dual" once
know the prices they need.
And woe be it to those who ignore
them. Recall the winter of 1973, after
the oil embargo, when government
bureaucrats were under political pres
sure to keep the price of natural gas
fixed. They believed they could pay no
heed to the Lagrange multipliers, then go
do as they wanted, yet this proved not to
be the case. Their hubris resulted in
shortage-- V a consequence, houses and
factories went without heat and power
regardless of the adequate supplies of gas
in the ground.
You by this time might be concerned
about where these mighty multipliers
come from. If our welfare is so depen
dent on them, can we be assured we'll
have them when we need them? The
question was basically the motivation of
the "Second Welfare Theorem" in eco
nomics. In the terms I used previoulsy, it
states that there will be prices that
"support," in the economists' terms, any
allocation of goods and services in the
economy. Proving this was a mathemati
cal tour-de-force of Arrow (here at Stan
ford) and Debreu (now at Berkeley).
The import of the theorem is that a sys
tem can be arranged so that if everyone
tries to sove their dual problem without
regard to anyone else's, the result will be
as good as if some central authority tried
to solve everyone's problem. With this
proof accomplished, I am sure that free
market economists sleep better at night,
having demonstrated rigorously that

people fundamentally get what they
want.
We tend to take for granted the power
of this result. The benevolence of its au
thority is true by the lack of controversy
it raises. As with the best authority, we
are completely unaware of its power. So
in this way, as long as we've paid atten
tion to the multipliers, we do not ques
tion why, for example, there are ade
quate numbers of tires for sale ir. Idaho
when there is no official in charge to
make this so. I have been told, perhaps
somewhat apocryphally, that economic
modelers in the Soviet counterpart of the
ClA's economic analysis division insisted
that there must be hidden somewhere in
the U.S. economy decision-makers that
tallied and monitored the numbers of
tires going to md maki ~g sure that
the right number were sent there. Clearly
these analysts did not comprehend the
subtle perspicacity Lagrange multipliers
bring to this situation any more than the
textbook authors did. Consider that mil
lions of people (not only in the ''free
world," but everywhere) several times
each day optimize their situation because
of this property of prices. And no
centralized computer data-base could do
better, even if it could keep track of all
the transactions necessary.
This point could be milked quite a bit
more in support of free-market ideology.
However, this is not a piece on ideology,
but rather a criticism of engineering. Ap
plication of Lagrange multipliers is a tool
to solve a class of problems which arise
for engineers as well as for economists
whatever their political beliefs. You need
the right tools for the job. That's what
the calculus text authors misappreciated.
Knowing the ease that prices provide in
dividing a good among users or uses,
price systems should be engineered
whenever possible to take ad vantage of
it.
