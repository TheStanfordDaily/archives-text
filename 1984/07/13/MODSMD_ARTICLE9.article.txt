## I asked Rabbi 
### 
Jamil Talhouk's "viewpoint"
on the Baccalaureate sermon
this year contains at least one
error of fact, which I would like
to correct. Rabbi Fackenheim
was not brought here by B'nai
B'rith, but by me. B'nai B rith
acted as agents for Rabbi Fack
enheim, and it was their agency,
not their initiative, which was
acknowledged by the reference
to them in the order of service.
1 invited Fackenheim after
consultation with the senior
class officers and with the Bac
caulaureate committee of the
representatives of the senior
class, and the latter representa
tives of the Stanford Islamic So
ciety, the Stanford Society of

Friends, the Catholic Student
Center, Hillel Foundation, the
United Christian Campus Mini
stries, and the Stanford Chris
tian Fellowship, acting on behalf
ot the more than twenty regis
tered religious groups on
campus. Fackenheim's pres
ence, therefore, was the result
of the best judgment of a re
sponsible representative group
of the Stanford community.
I am, of course, sorry that
Talhouk's feelings were hurt by
what Fackenheim said. By cus
tom and principle we do not try
to control what speakers say on
such occasions, beyond asking
them to bear in mind that the
hearers will be of diverse
opinions and to bear in mind
that the service is ecumenical, in
the broadest sense of the term. I

am glad that Talhouk had the
opportunity to make public his
dissatisfaction, and to make an
argument against what Facken
heim said. I read his argument
with care, and was reminded
again of how profoundly tragic
the situation is in the Middle
East, there being, it seems to
me, a moral impasse, a clash of
two rights.
I find that impasse insoluble
at present, and so am prepared
to listen patiently to all sides,
and to wait in prayer upon the
providence of God. If Talhouk
would like to nominate a repre
sentative of Islam to be consid
ered for Baccalaureate preach
er, I would be grateful.
