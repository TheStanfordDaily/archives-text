San Francisco — More than
4000 convention delegates, fol
lowed by an entourage of some
30,000 journalists, tourists,
curiosity seekers and other
hangers-on, arrived here this
weekend for the 39th Demo
cratic National Convention.
Strolls through Fisherman's
Wharf and along Market Street
seemed like journeys into the
world of political bigwigs and
high-tech media — and anyone
with a notepad and pen could
participate. Bizarre sights and
sounds were commonplace.
Take, for example, the silver
haired man wandering some
what aimlessly through the
lobby of the Fisherman's Wharf
Travelodge Saturday. He
looked a bit lost as he asked the
volunteers at the convention
host committee desk where his
fellow delegates were and what
he should be doing.
"This is my first political con
vention so I'm just finding my
way around," explained
Kingman Brewster in an inter
view later.
Brewster, a delegate for Gary
Hart, may be a newcomer to the
political scene, but he's hardly
new to the spotlight. The 65-
year-old London lawyer served
as president of Yale University
for 14 years and as a Harvard

law professor for 10 years
before that. He said he's excited
about his immersion into
politics. "It's a whole new ball
game for me."
Brewster arrived in the Bay
Area Thursday and spent two
days in Palo Alto visiting
friends, including Stanford Law
School Dean John Hart Ely and
Electrical Engineering Prof.
John Linvill.

He talked openly about Stan
ford and current politics, drift
ing from one subject to the next
with ease. He "sympathizes"
with some of the trouble that
University President Donald
Kennedy faced in the Hoover
Institution/Reagan library
quagmire, and doesn't think his
colleague has shown any par-
