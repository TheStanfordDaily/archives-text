# Democrats hit S.F.

### BOB COHN Daily staff 
San Francisco — More than
4000 convention delegates, fol
lowed by an entourage of some
30,000 journalists, tourists,
curiosity seekers and other
hangers-on, arrived here this
weekend for the 39th Demo
cratic National Convention.
Strolls through Fisherman's
Wharf and along Market Street
seemed like journeys into the
world of political bigwigs and
high-tech media — and anyone
with a notepad and pen could
participate. Bizarre sights and
sounds were commonplace.
Take, for example, the silver
haired man wandering some
what aimlessly through the
lobby of the Fisherman's Wharf
Travelodge Saturday. He
looked a bit lost as he asked the
volunteers at the convention
host committee desk where his
fellow delegates were and what
he should be doing.
"This is my first political con
vention so I'm just finding my
way around," explained
Kingman Brewster in an inter
view later.
Brewster, a delegate for Gary
Hart, may be a newcomer to the
political scene, but he's hardly
new to the spotlight. The 65-
year-old London lawyer served
as president of Yale University
for 14 years and as a Harvard

law professor for 10 years
before that. He said he's excited
about his immersion into
politics. "It's a whole new ball
game for me."
Brewster arrived in the Bay
Area Thursday and spent two
days in Palo Alto visiting
friends, including Stanford Law
School Dean John Hart Ely and
Electrical Engineering Prof.
John Linvill.

He talked openly about Stan
ford and current politics, drift
ing from one subject to the next
with ease. He "sympathizes"
with some of the trouble that

tisanship in the issue.
Committed to Hart (he
served as honorary co-chairman
of the candidate's Connecticut
campaign), Brewster won't go
so far as to predict a coup on the
floor of Moscone Center, but he
is keeping his fingers crossed.
"Anything can happen. There
were lots of surprises along the
way, and there could be more."
He added that he never ex
pected Hart to be offered a spot
on Mondale's ticket because
"Gary is too independent."
Kennedy's East Coast coun
terpart admitted that, while the
unusual collection of San Fran
ciscans — including street
people, punkers, gays and les
bians and the übiquitous pan
handlers — won't affect the
convention,"it may affect the
public's image of the Demo
cratic Party because there are so
many eccentric people around
here. It could be it will rub off
on the Democratic Party."
Jack Brooks, a 61-year-old
congressman from Texas caught
chatting with hotel personnel at
the Sheraton Fisherman's
Wharf, agreed with Brewster.
"They (San Francisco) got
'em all, all kinds," the 16-term
congressman said.
"We just have to work with
them. I think people will under
stand that there are all kinds of
people in the world," Brooks
said.
He paused, then added, "and
there are a hell of a lot more of
them here in San Francisco."
Chomping on a cigar stub and

talking with spirited Texas flair,
Brooks, a Mondale delegate,
said he enjoyed walking around
the city over the weekend. Of
the revamped cable car system,
which the congressman jokingly
recalled cost "45 million billion
dollars" in federal funds,
Brooks only said, "It was a good
investment."
Like Brewster, Brooks char
acterized Rep. Geraldine Fer
raro, Mondale's chosen running
mate, as "a lovely lady, a com
petent congresswoman, and a
(potentially) fine vice presi
dent." Still, he admitted favor
ing home-state hopefuls like
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen or
San Antonio Mayor Henry Cis
neros.
Brooks has attended seven
political conventions. He said
San Francisco's convention is
sure to stack up. After all, he
said, "It won't be as hot as
Miami; it won't be as violent as
Chicago."
As Brooks talked, hotel
employees strolled by in black
and-white striped suits and caps,
dragging mock balls-and-chains
fastened to their running shoes.
It's all part of the Sheraton's
special "Tour of Alcatraz"
registration theme.
Upon entering the hotel,
delegates faced a list of ten
prison rules. The four-station
registration process featured
hotel clerks in prison garb, sit
ting in chicken wire cells. After
checking in, paying and submit
ting to a thumb print, the
delegates were given bread and
water: In this case, Calistoga on
the rocks and Parisian sour
dough.

And don't think all this talk of
street people is simply a prissy,
preconvention phobia. The
down-on-their-luck were out in
full force for Sunday's labor
march on Market Street, only
most of them didn't seem to
notice any of the other 150,000
people or their floats, signs or
chants. Most looked on with dis
interest and perhaps some con
fusion at the invaders except a
ragged fellow on the corner of
Seventh and Market who, for no
apparent reason, began crashing
Budweiser bottles across the
parade route from his perch on
the north curb. The members of
the Plumbers and Pipefitters
Union hesitated as glass sprayed
their path and then, when the
man ran out of bottles, resumed
stride and song; " Two-four-six -
nine, Reagan in the welfare
line." The bottle thrower smiled
and gave the crowd the thumbs
up.
The highlights of the parade
were the hand-held and truck
towed signs, including:
"Ronnie, Don't Trickle Down
on Me;" "Putting on the Ritz
for Fritz;" "Grocery bags, not
body bags;" and United Stan
ford Workers' age-old entry:
"Stanford University: The J.P.
Stevens of higher education."
There is a danger, however, in
just hitting the streets armed
with notepad, pen and map.
Since the delegates look just
like the thousands of other
tourists, you end up asking
"Excuse me sir, are you a con
vention delegate?" And, since
there are four times as many
journalists here as delegates, the
usual answer is, "No, I'm a
reporter."
