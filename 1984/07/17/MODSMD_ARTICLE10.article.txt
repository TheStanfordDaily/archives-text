## Create a religion 
### 
I've been tripping through the
religions lately, and I've come to
the conclusion that none of
them make a whole lot of sense.
Take Christianity, for exam
ple. I'm not singling Christians
out just to pick on them, but
simply because they are the
most visible religious group in
my community. Christianity is
entirely too full of paradoxes for
me to accept. Probably the most
important of these is the con
cept of heaven and hell. How
can a merciful God condemn a
soul to hell for all eternity for
making human mistakes? If we
weren't supposed to engage in
"illicit" sexual behavior, why
did God give us hormones?
What is the origin of evil,
anyhow? Does a person who
worships coconuts in the jungles
of New Guinea get sent to hell
because he's never heard of
Jesus?
Of course, these aren't new
questions, even though there
are a number of new answers. In
fact, if you ask a devout Chris
tian these questions you'll get a
different answer almost every
time. I think the best answer
came from a Catholic friend of
mine. He said that when a per
son dies, God appears before
the soul and asks if now it
believes in Him. So there you
are, dead, floating through
space, when Jehovah Himself
pulls up in a fiery chariot drawn
by a host of angels and asks if
you would like to repent your
sins and go to heaven or refuse
and go to hell. I wonder who
would be stupid enough to say
no? And anyhow, what's the
point of being good on earth, if
that's all there is to it?
I don't want to make my
friend sound stupid. He's actu
ally quite a bit >marter than I
am, and I meant it when I said
that his was the best answer I've
heard.
This only goes to show that
there is no such thing as Religi
ous Truth. Most people know
that, but I think that a lot of
people are a bit too firm about
their religious beliefs. Anyone
who thinks he or she can find
the whole truth from the Bible,
Torah, or Koran is being very
narrow-minded. Even if we
believe wholeheartedly in one
of these books, we still find our
selves explaining little things
in our own way. ✓
After that lengthy introduc

tion, we now come to my reli
gion. For lack of a better name,
I'll call it Danism. I believe that
God is a great big mass of en
ergy — sort of like the warp
drive on the starship Enterprise,
but less contained. It may be in
telligent, and it may not, that
doesn't really matter. All that
matters is that it is extremely
creative. ,
The divine energy is made up
of the stuff of our souls. When
we die, we return to it, to be
recycled and reborn in another
body. Nobody gets punished for
being bad, or rewarded for
being good. If you need a reason
to be good in a system like this,
let it be that when you do harm
to another you are in fact hurt
ing yourself, since we are all
made of the same thing. When
I'm in a theological mood, 1 im
agine that this divine energy is
intelligent, and that occasionally
it instills particularly potent
quantities of itself in people like
Christ.
And that's it. It's ridiculously
simple for a religion, and I
doubt that it's even original. But
it's mine, and I can change it
when I like, and it answers all of
those uncomfortable questions
for me. And that's all that mat
ters. I look back at all the years I
spent trying to figure out what
the truth was, and I think I've fi
nally realized that the truth is
whatever I want it to be. My re
ligion is perfectly valid simply
because I believe in it.
I know what you're thinking.
What if I'm wrong. What if I
die, and Gabriel takes one look
at my primitive ideology and
hits the "Bad Egg" lever? It's
awfully tempting to adopt a reli
gion simply because a lot of
other people are following it.
That way, if you're wrong there
will be a bunch of others in the
same boat. That's a decision you
have to make for yourself. My
suggestion is simply to find a re
ligion that anwers all the ques
tions for you while you're on the
earth — even if you have to
make it up.
Don't use my religion,
though. I'm not accepting any
apostles. I found this religion
and you can bloody well find
your own. Who knows? Maybe
in the end we'll all turn out to be
right.

the whole truth from the Bible,
Torah, or Koran is being very
narrow-minded. Even if we
believe wholeheartedly in one
of these books, we still find our
selves explaining little things
in our own way. ✓
After that lengthy introduc

tion, we now come to my reli
gion. For lack of a better name,
I'll call it Danism. I believe that
God is a great big mass of en
ergy — sort of like the warp
drive on the starship Enterprise,
but less contained. It may be in
telligent, and it may not, that
doesn't really matter. All that
matters is that it is extremely
creative. ,
The divine energy is made up
of the stuff of our souls. When
we die, we return to it, to be
recycled and reborn in another
body. Nobody gets punished for
being bad, or rewarded for
being good. If you need a reason
to be good in a system like this,
let it be that when you do harm
to another you are in fact hurt
ing yourself, since we are all
made of the same thing. When
I'm in a theological mood, 1 im
agine that this divine energy is
intelligent, and that occasionally
it instills particularly potent
quantities of itself in people like
Christ.
And that's it. It's ridiculously
simple for a religion, and I
doubt that it's even original. But
it's mine, and I can change it
when I like, and it answers all of
those uncomfortable questions
for me. And that's all that mat
ters. I look back at all the years I
spent trying to figure out what
the truth was, and I think I've fi
nally realized that the truth is
whatever I want it to be. My re
ligion is perfectly valid simply
because I believe in it.
I know what you're thinking.
What if I'm wrong. What if I
die, and Gabriel takes one look
at my primitive ideology and
hits the "Bad Egg" lever? It's
awfully tempting to adopt a reli
gion simply because a lot of
other people are following it.
That way, if you're wrong there
will be a bunch of others in the
same boat. That's a decision you
have to make for yourself. My
suggestion is simply to find a re
ligion that anwers all the ques
tions for you while you're on the
earth — even if you have to
make it up.
Don't use my religion,
though. I'm not accepting any
apostles. I found this religion
and you can bloody well find
your own. Who knows? Maybe
in the end we'll all turn out to be
right.
