## Reagan uses bad logic on drinking 
### 
I have a meassage for our 18,19
and 20-year-old citizens.
Ronald Reagan wants votes this
fall. He is urging voter registra
tion. He thinks you are mature
enough to vote. Ronald Reagan
will send you off to war with or
without a weapon and thinks
you are mature enough for that.
Ronald Reagan will tearfully
thank you in speech if you die in
war as have many young
marines in recent years. He
definitely thinks you're mature
enough to die in war.
Ronald Reagan does not, I
repeat, does not think you ma
ture enough to drink. Ronald
Reagan needs a lesson in logic.
You can administer this lesson
by registering and voting against
him this year. Prove how mature
you are at the ballot box!
If you are old enough for war,
you are old enough to drink. I
hope all other logical thinking
persons will vote with you
against Ronald Reagan! I know
I will, and heck, I'll even buy
you a beer.
Mrs. Claude Mauldin
