# Rodin sculptures transform campus
## 
### 
When Mallarme died, Rodin,
grief-stricken, said to Renoir:
"How long will it take for na

ture to make another mind like
that?" The compliment can be
applied to himself: "How long
before we get another Rodin?"
Meanwhile, we can express our
gratitude to the gentleman who
loaned or gave us all those won
derful sculptures and to Profes
sor Elsen, the eminent Rodin
authority who was instrumental
in this windfall. They have
transformed our campus, raised
it a whole level in aesthetic
class. I hope the statues will
never be removed from in front
of those various arches and
vistas; it almost seems that they
were planned to be stationed
there.
Glory of French art! I like to
think, seriously, that there are
young spirits here who con
sciously or not will be lifted by
that presence and go beyond
themselves in time, worthy per
petuators of that grand tradi
tion. And I have another fond
hope: that the generous donor
can be persuaded to add to our
almost unparallelled collection
of Rodin one of his finest mas
terpieces: Le Baiser. What an
exquisite homage to the female
male relationship! That too may
be worth perpetuating . . .
