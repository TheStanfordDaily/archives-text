## Phillips backs Hart 
### BILL MARTIN 
The 3933 delegates to the
Democratic National Conven
tion include Stanford student
Jeff Phillips, 26, a leader of the
local Hart campaign.
Phillips, one of four Hart
delegates from the 12th Con
gressional District, met with the
California Hart delegation Sun
day and Monday to finalize a
plan of action for the conven
tion.
A graduate student in me
chanical engineering, Phillips
took a moment before he left
for his week in the city to talk
about Hart's chances and his
work for Mondale's most for
midable challenger.
In charge of the Stanford
Hart campaign since November,
Phillips wrote Hart last spring,
telling him "I liked your speech
here ... I think you will make a
very good president and I will
support you if you run."
Immediately after Hart an
nounced his candidacy last fall,
his staff wrote to Phillips asking
him to help organize the
Colorado senator's efforts in the
12th District and to help with
the Hart campaign on campus.
This week is the culmination
of that year-long effort. Phillips
said Hart still plans to battle it
out to the end, although his
voice was subdued and he didn't
hesitate to talk about a Mondale
candidacy.
Hart was expected to concede
the race this weekend after
some of his delegates, including
Pat Schroeder, came out
publicly supporting a Ferraro

vice-presidency. But with recent
developments and controversy
surrounding the Lance hiring
and Manatt resignation, Hart's
campaign could have inadver
tently received a big boost from
Mondale's blundering.
"If Mondale doesn't win on
the first ballot Wednesday,"
Phillips explained, "basically
anything could happen."
Still, Phillips is not too hope
ful.
"I'm not really optimistic," he
said. "Every indicator said he
lost the vote after last week."
He still has no regrets about
his long hours of work for Hart.
"The most important thing
was to beat Reagan," he said.
"Hart had 10 more points on
him (Reagan) in the polls. I just
don't think Mondale has a
chance. For someone with his
organization to not even have
the nomination wrapped up at
this point shows something.
"I've been working since
April last year and have been
speaking all over the place. I
was up at 2 a.m. throwing Hart
newspapers in people's yards. I
helped groups with a phone
banking effort. We called 8000
voters."
If nothing else, this week will
be one big party for Phillips.
"We're going to three or four
parties tonight," he said. "I'm
going to a big baseball game
with the delegates and Willie
Brown's 'Oh What a Night'
party. I also hope to get some
running in out on the
waterfront."
