# Ex-CIA man raps Reagan policy
## 
### MARY SMATHERS 
Former SRI researcher David Mac Michael has
become outspokenly critical of the Reagan ad
ministration s policy toward Central America and
is lobbying Democratic Convention delegates in
San Francisco this week.
A former CIA adviser to the National Intelli
gence Council (NIC), Mac Michael is also bringing
his case against the administration's foreign policy
to several local community groups.
Mac Michael, a former history professor al
Dominican College in San Rafael, served on the
NIC as special senior advisory staff to the director
of the CIA, from March 1981 to April 1983. Mac-
Michael said his job was to derive "estimates on
the Central American situation and the state of
the Salvadoran insurgency" for the CIA.
Mac Michael, who said he had serious doubts
about the estimates of the NIC, left the agency in
1983 because his two-year contract was not
renewed. Since April 1983, Mac Michael has
traveled twice to Nicaragua to continue his
"personal investigation into the situation."
Although he was offered CIA work outside of
the NIC after 1983, he said, "It would take a
court order to get me in there again."
Mac Michael's complaint is that the Reagan ad
ministration has had to justify its policy in the
region by claiming that a Moscow-Havana-
Managua connection is responsible for the insur
gency in El Salvador, which has involved that
country in a four-year-old civil war.
"They don't credit the problem with being an
indigenous one," Mac Michael said. "The basis for
their policy is a Nicaraguan k arms flow,' which I
don't believe exists."
Mac Michael said that although the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua gives "political,
diplomatic and moral support to the FMLN (the
National Liberation Front Farabundo Marti, El
Salvador's revolutionary group fighting against
the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government.), in
three and one-half years there has not been one
pistola (gun) of evidence'" that they are sending
arms to the Salvadoran rebels.
In 1980 and 1981 there was a sporadic transfer
of arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador, Mac-
Michael said. "Everyone admits to that," he
conceded.
The arms probably came from some of the
25,000 Salvadorans living in Nicaragua who still

have family in EI Salvador, he said.
"But since the spring of 1981 the evidence of
(Nicaraguan arms going to El Salvador) has disap
peared."
Mac Michael cited the Nicarguan government's
consistent denial of arms trafficking, the enor
mous U.S. presence in Central America that has
not produced any captured weapons, and the
recent World Court case as further evidence in
support of his position.
Nicaragua took the U.S. government to the
World Court after it mined Nicaragua's harbors
earlier this year. "The U.S. had a super opportu
nity to demolish Nicaragua's credibility at the
World Court. But they didn't take it, so I assume
they didn t have the tickets." Mac Michael said.
Mac Michael also questions the US justification
for continuing its support of rebels trying to over
throw the Nicaraguan government.^
He said the senior military leadership in the
U.S. has also been opposed to confrontation in
the Central American region. "The sea lanes
argument for U.S. involvement there is also non
sense, he said. U.S. officials have claimed that
Nicaragua may pose a threat to U.S. sea lanes in
the Carribean.
But now much of the U.S. military leadership is
being replaced by military leaders who were
colonels and lieutenant colonels when they left
Vietnam."These people are the ones you see
wearing t-shirts that read 'Southeast Asia
Wargames, '63-'75, Second Place,' "he said.
Mac Michael is concerned that the military's
new leadership is out to regain U.S. dominance —
lost in Vietnam — in Central America.
Mac Michael, who worked on Defense Depart
ment contracts in Southeast Asia for four years
during the Vietnam War, said a U.S. commitment
of troops to Central America would involve
long struggle, an enourmous number of deaths
and would have foreign and diplomatic conse
quences. I don't want to live through that Viet
nam crap all over again." he said.
Mac Michael will continue to speak out against
Reagan's policies by leading an informal discus
sion on "the Nicaragua-El Salvador connection,"
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at the First Presbyterian
Church in Palo Alto.
