# Publishing seminar offered once more

A total of 22 people, ranging
from students to a der
matologist, attended Douglas
Smith's one-day publishing
seminar — "How to Publish
Your Own Book — Saturday
at Tresidder.
It was Smith's first attempt at
bringing together the tips and
shortcuts of self-publishing.
Most of the participants had
an interest in writing, but
curiosity about the entire
publishing process was perhaps
the main reason for signing up.
Barbara Ingram, a housewife,
had edited an anthology of
autobiographies produced by a
Foothill College course on per
sonal narration. She wanted to
"learn how to do it better next
time."
Van Wilcox has been working
on an "in-house" book for his
company, more than 100 miles
away. "My partner signed me
up and told me to get down
here," he said. "I guess he really
wants me to finish it quick."
Others, whether in-process
writers or people like Judy An
derson. a freelancer who didn't
get into the two-week Stanford
Publishing Course, were simply
eager to get Smith's overview of
small-time — perhaps leading to
big-time — book publishing.
Smith began the day by
enumerating the virtues of using
a word processor. His personal
choice: the Kaypro 11, using the
Perfect software line. By coding
his own work, he cut his typeset
ting costs in half. Smith sent a
disk to the typesetter. meaning
he didn't have to pay someone
else $40/ hour to type it in for

him. "The front end of a type
setting operation is a word pro
cessing terminal. You are
bypassing that expense," said
Smith.
He then explained the steps
involved in physically putting
out the book: specifying
typesize, typeface and width;
proofing galleys (typed copy on
photographic paper); half
toning black-and-white
pictures; and finally, distribu
tion.
The latter goes hand in hand
with clever publicity, empha
sized Smith, "or else you will
have a stillborn book."
"Publishing is a business," he
continued, "This is anathema to
some people in the arts ... let
someone else handle the un
savory aspect. But if you have a
PR personality . . . you must
package properly."
Distribution is crucial, involv
ing lots of running around to
local bookstores and other out
lets. Smith, author of "The
Scotch Gourmet," said that his
book on inexpensive restaurants
around this area appealed to
local stores. Assessing the mar
ket is important to selling the
book.
The legwork can be tremen
dous, but Smith recommends
hiring students. "How many
English majors want to go into
publishing? About 50 percent,"
he commented, then quipped,
"If you call them flunkies, you
won t get anyone. But call them
publishing interns-in-charge-of
marketing . . ."
Hookstores aren't the only
