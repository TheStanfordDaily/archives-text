## McGovern attacks Reagan foreign policy 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
San Francisco — Former Sen
George McGovern delivered a
stinging denunciation of the
Reagan administration's foreign
policy Saturday, declaring.
"Even as the president talks of
peace, the fact remains thai
right now we are steadily
deepening our military involve
ment in the war in Central
America."
McGovern said, "After three
years of the most belligerent ap
proach in living memory, we will
now see an effort in the months
ahead for the president to tiptoe
through the election in the guise
of a peacemaker. But keep in
mind that that's what he also
calls the MX missile."
In McGovern's view, the
president "has chosen con
frontation over negotiation and
has brought back gunboat
diplomacy when we need a good
neighbor policy."
McGovern served two terms
as a congressman and 18 years as
a U.S. Senator from South
Dakota. He was the Democratic
nominee for president in 1972,
and waged a brief campaign for
the presidency again this year,
dropping out after the Massa
chusetts primary.
He is currently a history pro
fessor at Northwestern Univer
sity and the chairman of
Americans for Common Sense,
an organization dedicated to op
posing the New Right.
His criticism of Reagan was
not based in partisanship, he
said. In his view, President
Eisenhower, a Republican, was
the most effective post-war

president at restraining the arms
race.
After noting that Reagan is
the first American president in
more than 50 years who has not
met with the leader of the Soviet
Union, McGovern said, •"Even
my old rival, Richard Nixon, un
derstood the importance of reg
ular systematic talks with Soviet
leaders."
McGovern said the American
invasion of Grenada last fall
violated the charter of the Or
ganization of American States
(OAS).
"I have yet to see evidence
that a single American life was
endangered in any way justify
ing that intervention," he said.
He added, "I think the OAS
Charter is being violated again
today in Nicaragua ... the min
ing of the Nicaraguan harbors
and the training of forces in
Honduras for the purpose of
overturning or at least harassing
and sabotaging the existing gov

ernment of Nicaragua is a clear
violation of the spirit if not the
letter of the charter."
McGovern said, "I don't buy
these scare tactics that we have
heard from high officials in our
government that unless we're
there to crush these revolution
ary movements, we're going to
be invaded by regiments of
barefoot revolutionaries march
ing north from El Salvador."
Paraphrasing Santayana,
McGovern said, "Ronald
Reagan does not remember the
history of American presence in
Central America and Iran, and
is therefore condemned to
repeat some of the things for
which we've paid a heavy price
in the past."
McGovern closed his remarks
with a quote from a recent arti
cle by Averell Harriman, who
said "If present developments
are permitted to continue, we
could face not the risk but the
reality of nuclear war."

During the question-and
answer session after his speech,
McGovern noted that he dis
agrees with Walter Mondale.
the likely Democratic presiden
tial nominee this >ear, on
several issues. For example,
while Reagan favors a 10-15
percent annual increase in
defense spending and Mondale
favors a 4-5 percent increase,
McGovern favors reduced
spending.
When asked if he thought the
Soviets are scared by the presi
dent's proposed "Star Wars'
defense system, McGovern
replied, "I don't know if they're
scared, but 1 am. If they aren't
scared, then they're not as
shrewd as I think they are — it's
a very dangerous concept."
The former senator also com
mented on recent developments
in the 1984 presidential cam
paign.
McGovern said the appoint
ment of Bert Lance as chairman
of the Mondale campaign
"should strengthen us in the
South."
He said he had met with
Mondale the previous evening
and was asked to speak to the
convention Wednesday night.
Under the plan, McGovern will
be nominated for president, will
deliver a speech, then will
withdraw before any ballots are
cast.
The former senator said he
will continue to advise Mondale
and will campaign actively for
the Democratic ticket this fall.
McGovern spoke to an audi
ence of 500 at a global security
conference at St. Mary's Cathe
dral.

McGovern said the appoint
ment of Bert Lance as chairman
of the Mondale campaign
"should strengthen us in the
South."
He said he had met with
Mondale the previous evening

Under the plan, McGovern will
be nominated for president, will
deliver a speech, then will
withdraw before any ballots are
cast.
The former senator said he
will continue to advise Mondale
and will campaign actively for
the Democratic ticket this fall.
McGovern spoke to an audi
ence of 500 at a global security
conference at St. Mary's Cathe
