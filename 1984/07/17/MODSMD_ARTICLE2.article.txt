# USW charged with dues irregularities
## 
### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
The University has filed a
lawsuit against United Stanford
Workers (USW), charging that
union dues were collected
"secretly" by Local 680 during
February and March, and asking
that the dues be returned to
union members, according to
Associate Staff Counsel Susan
de Jongh-Kearl.
Jongh-Kearl also said Stan
ford arbitrators were told by the
San Francisco office of the State
Labor Commission that they
need not attend a show-cause
hearing scheduled last Thursday
by another Labor Commission
office.
When asked why Stanford
representatives had not gone to
the July 12 show-cause hearing,
which was held despite their ab
sence, Jongh-Kearl explained
that they were told by the San
Francisco office of the State
Labor Commission that they
could submit a written state
ment of their position in lieu of
a personal appearance.
"We have maintained all
along that this matter is pre
empted by the jursidiction of
the Sept. 17 National Labor Re
lations Board (NLRB)
hearing," Jongh-Kearl said.
Linda Crouse, president of
USW, has said that the July 11
State Labor Commission (SLC)
hearing and the Sept. 17 NLRB
hearing are separate issues, be
cause the NLRB hearing con
cerns a civil offense and the SLC
hearing deals with a criminal of
fense. But Jongh-Kearl main
tains that until the NLRB
decides whether or not Stanford
should recognize USW, any suit,
criminal or civil, will have to
wait.

Stanford's charge against
USW, filed the same day as the
labor commission hearing,
stated that during February and
March, approximately $30,000
was collected by the University
and turned over to Local 715.
Local 715 then "secretly"
agreed to transfer the money
over to Local 680.
"They (Local 715) gave all of
the money over to Local 680 . . .
what they did was cash the
check, and not endorse it over,
so we didn't know this was hap
pening," said Jongh-Kearl.
The University discovered the
transfer of dues in early May,
when the NLRB first recognized
Local 715's disaffiliation from
Stanford. Jongh-Kearl ex
plained that Stanford wanted to
press charges, but then realized
that because of an NLRB
statute of limitations a charge
had to be filed during a specific
time period.
Crouse responded to Stan
ford's latest move by calling the
charges "contemptible."
"The University is playing
games," she said. "They are the
ones facing charges by the
NLRB and the labor commis
sion, not us." The NLRB issued
a formal complaint against Stan
ford in June for conducting un
fair labor practices, which in
cluded terminating the collec
tion of USW dues.
Crouse said she felt the Uni
versity was trying to do two
things: bankrupt the union by
takng away three month's worth
of dues at once, and bribe the
union members.
"Management thinks our
members will give up their
membership for the return of a
few month's dues," she said.
