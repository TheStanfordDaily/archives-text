## BASS takes over Olympic soccer ticket sales 
### VINCE LARKIN With wire reports 
Prompted by reports of lagging ticket
sales, Olympic Soccer Commissioner
Alan Rothenberg announced last week
that tickets for the 1984 Olympic Soccer
Competition can now be bought through
Bay Area Seating Service (BASS).
Tickets had been sold through Nor
thern California Sears stores, but BASS
has now become the authorized ticketing
service. BASS can fill orders through 51
Northern California outlets.
"Ticket sales are going very well," said

BASS manager Valerie Kosorek.
Kosorek is confident that ticket sales will
improve. She noted that people can
charge ticket purchases over the phone
between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. She feels that
this is a real advantage. She also noted
there has been an increase in sales since
the Olympic Torch arrived in the Bay
Area. From 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. yesterday,
1200 tickets were sold. "That's an awful
lot of tickets in just five hours," she said.
The Record Factory in Menlo Park
also experienced a lot of business during
the past few days. "Saturday, there was

nothing but Stanford Soccer tickets,"
said store manager Benny Carlos.
"Selling like hot cakes!" exclaimed sales
man Greg Jones.
The Tresidder ticket office at Stanford
has been swamped the past couple of
days. John Milan, the assistant manager,
has praise for the new system. "It's the
best system available right now. It's very
flexible," he said. He added that the new
system gives everyone the same chance
to get tickets. He believes that with
720,000 tickets available, it is important
to have a centralized organized system.

Tresidder's biggest problem is accom
modating so many impatient people.
"People get antsy and impatient waiting
in line," said Milan. The ticket office has
also been moved to a temporary location
in Tresidder because of the remodeling
currently taking place at the student
union. Milan noted that five out of six
patrons are Olympic soccer enthusiasts.
Milan couldn't say if the matches
would sell out, but tickets are going fast
