## BASS takes over Olympic soccer ticket sales 
### VINCE LARKIN With wire reports 
Prompted by reports of lagging ticket
sales, Olympic Soccer Commissioner
Alan Rothenberg announced last week
that tickets for the 1984 Olympic Soccer
Competition can now be bought through
Bay Area Seating Service (BASS).
Tickets had been sold through Nor
thern California Sears stores, but BASS
has now become the authorized ticketing
service. BASS can fill orders through 51
Northern California outlets.
"Ticket sales are going very well," said

BASS manager Valerie Kosorek.
Kosorek is confident that ticket sales will
improve. She noted that people can
charge ticket purchases over the phone
between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. She feels that
this is a real advantage. She also noted
there has been an increase in sales since
the Olympic Torch arrived in the Bay
Area. From 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. yesterday,
1200 tickets were sold. "That's an awful
lot of tickets in just five hours," she said.
The Record Factory in Menlo Park
also experienced a lot of business during
the past few days. "Saturday, there was

nothing but Stanford Soccer tickets,"
said store manager Benny Carlos.
"Selling like hot cakes!" exclaimed sales
man Greg Jones.
The Tresidder ticket office at Stanford
has been swamped the past couple of
days. John Milan, the assistant manager,
has praise for the new system. "It's the
best system available right now. It's very
flexible," he said. He added that the new
system gives everyone the same chance
to get tickets. He believes that with
720,000 tickets available, it is important
to have a centralized organized system.

Tresidder's biggest problem is accom
modating so many impatient people.
"People get antsy and impatient waiting
in line," said Milan. The ticket office has
also been moved to a temporary location
in Tresidder because of the remodeling
currently taking place at the student
union. Milan noted that five out of six
patrons are Olympic soccer enthusiasts.
Milan couldn't say if the matches
would sell out, but tickets are going fast
Many LAOOC organizers are
enthusiastic about the new
ticket system. They expect a
pickup in sales. "Soccer has
traditionally been one of the
highest in revenue getters in

past Olympiads," noted one
Olympic official.
Tickets are $16.50, $11 and
$8 for the opening and closing
matches, and $11, $8 and $3.50
for the rest of the competition.
They may be purchased at all
BASS locations, including the
Record Factory in Menlo Park
and Tresidder Box Office at
Stanford. Tickets also can be

purchased by calling BASS at
893-2277.
Meanwhile, the Associated
Press reported in Los Angeles
yesterday that about 40,000
Southern Californians who or
dered Olympics tickets by mail
will get a second crack at seats
for top events at a three-day
invitation-only sale next
weekend.

More than 100,000
"premium" tickets — some
originally were alloted to na
tions participating in the Soviet
led boycott — will be offered at
an Olympic Ticket Faire set for
July 20-22 at Santa Anita Park
in Arcadia, Los Angeles Olym
pic Organizing Committee
spokesman Steve Montiel said.
"We wanted to do something
special for people who had or
dered early," Montiel said.
About 200,000 Southern Cal
ifornia residents participated in
the mail order ticket purchase
program, but only 40,000 were
sent invitations to the fair be
cause of space limitations. The
40,000 were selected randomly
by computer, Montiel added.
Invitations and photographic
identification must be presented
for admittance to the sale. In
vitations are non-transferable
except to other family members
living at the address on the invi
tation.
Each invitation is valid only
for a two-hour period on a spe
cific date. Participants will only
be allowed to buy two or four

tickets for any event, and the in
vitations spell out further limits
on the total number of tickets
and events per customer.
Payment must be in cash or
cashier's check.
Tickets will be offered for 17
sports and opening and closing
ceremonies. Many of the tickets
are for sessions that had previ
ously been sold out.
Montiel also said that the last
mail order tickets for people on
waitlists were sent out Monday
and should be delivered by
Wednesday or Thursday.
Those who are expecting tick
ets and haven't received them
by then can call a special service
number for information.
Meanwhile, more than one
million tickets for 14 sports
remain on sale to the general
public at nine Southern Califor
nia ticket information centers.
Despite the large number of
unsold tickets, Montiel noted
that $123 million worth of seats
have been sold — well above
the LAOOC's projected ticket
revenue of $93 million.
