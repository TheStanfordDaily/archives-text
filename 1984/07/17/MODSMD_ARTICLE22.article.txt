### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
As the world prepares to
come to Stanford for the Olym
pic soccer matches at the end of
this month, the Stanford wo
men's basketball team is doing
some international traveling of
its own. The cagers left Saturday
for New Zealand, where they
will play a 10-game schedule in
the next two weeks against local
amateur teams as well as the
New Zealand national team.
The tour began yesterday on
the country's South Island and
will travel north, finishing up in
Auckland. The cagers will face
the city teams of Canterbury,
Christchurch, Wellington and
Auckland among others, and
they will play New Zealand's
top team in a series of contests.
The women's team is follow
ing the example of the men's
team, which toured Japan last

summer. Asked how she chose
New Zealand, Head Coach
Dotty McCrea deadpanned, "I
needed new sheepskin slippers

â€” my old ones were worn out,"
a reference to the islands' wool
based economy.
On a more serious note
McCrea said, "It should be a
great experience for all of us.

Everyone seems excited about
going. In fact, some of the girls
are planning to go over to
Australia on their own when
we're done playing." NCAA
rules only permit one foreign
trip every four years for a team,
so this will be the only interna
tional tour the current players
will have while at Stanford.
The Cardinal also received a
quick initiation into jet lag,
having only one day to recover
before their first game yester
day.
McCrea said the major differ
ences between NCAA and in
ternational rules are that the of
ficial need not check the ball
after a backcourt violation in in
ternational play and that three
shots to make two are awarded
on a shooting foul. The three
second lane is also slightly
wider.
