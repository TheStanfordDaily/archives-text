## 'The Fourth Man' glittering surfaces 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The Dutch director Paul Ver
hoeven's flamboyant self
assurance ignites his films. He
hasn't received much critical
recognition in this country, but
his World War II espionage
picture Soldier of Orange was in
the Lives of a Bengal Lancer-
Gunga Din class of expertly
tooled, gloriously enjoyable ad
venture stories, and his latest
release, The Fourth Man, has an
exciting, sexy, ostentatious
surface. Jan De Bont's
cinematography reminds us of
Ralf Bode's in Dressed to Kill:
With glittering objects hidden
all over in unexpected places —
with a potentially glittering edge
to every object on screen, it
seems — the hero walks in con
stant danger. Verhoeven shows
he is an ingenious imagist in this
film, but it's not a museum piece
or a shimmering visual
junkyard, like the recent Cop
pola output or last year's The
Moon in the Gutter; the breath
taking skills of the editor, Ineke
Schenkkan, collaborate with
Verhoeven's instinct for timing
to keep the picture in constant
motion. (You're surprised that
it's over so soon.)

Nonsense releases Ver
hoeven's energy. Though it
stemmed from the memoirs of
an actual wartime spy, Soldier of
Orange delighted in the un
tainted bravery and panache of
its protagonists — heroes dedi
cated to comporting themselves
like heroes. Making the 1981
Spetters, about young men in
Amsterdam, Verhoeven ran
into trouble: The movie was ob
viously meant to be a serious
study, in the tradition of Fel
lini's I Vitelloni, but it was too
slick to be convincing, and yet
the details were disturbing — it
unsettled the audience to no ap
parent purpose. The violent sur
realism of The Fourth Man and
the unsavory, base characters
don't sour the experience for us,
the way Spetters was soured, be
cause we can't believe in the
ridiculous occult plot — because
we know it's junk, and that frees
us up to have a good time
watching it. In fact, the nastiness
creates the atmosphere a movie
like this requires in order to
really soar, just as the creeps in
Eyes of Laura Mars helped Irvin
Kershner to build the feeling of
impending disaster. The Fourth
Man is disreputable fun.

Jeroen Krabbe does first-rate
work in the role of a
homosexual, alcoholic author
with a petulant live-in lover
whom he fantasizes murdering,
and a gift for manipulating cir
cumstances to his own advan
tage. (The writer's name,
Gerard Reve, is also the name
of the man who penned the
novel upon which Gerard
Souteman based his
screenplay.) About to board a
train from his home city,
Amsterdam, to Flessingue,
where he has been hired to ad
dress a literary club, he tries
without success to pick up a
muscular young man (Thom
Hoffman) headed for Cologne.
In Flessingue, he allows himself
to be seduced by a wealthy
widow and coiffeuse, Christine
(Renee Soutendijk, the incen
diary blonde who was the best
reason for seeing Spetters), and
— like William Holden in
Sunset Boulevard — he begins
to entertain the prospect of
remaining in her house for a
while, living off her generosity
and indulging himself in her chic
lifestyle, especially when he
learns that the Adonis from
Cologne is Christine's lover,

Hermann. On some unlikely
pretext, he persuades Christine
to invite Hermann up for a
week's visit, trusting that during
that time he'll be able to lure the
young man (who is, it turns out,
a selfish, sensuous blockhead)
into his own bed.
What makes The Fourth Man
nonsensical is the supernatural
conflict underpinning the sex
story. Gerard, a clairvoyant
(like Faye Dunaway in Laura
Mars), receives a series of
"warnings" as he approaches
Flessingue and then as he in
volves himself with Christine —
bloody nightmarish images that
recur in slightly altered form
throughout the film. The images
have astonishing clarity, and the
best ones practically lift Ver
hoeven into the Bertolucci
ranks; one, in fact — dots of
crimson tissue paper splattering
a city street like an explosion of
tiny blood corpuscles — might be
an hommage to the proliferation
of autumn leaves in Bertolucci's
The Conformist. Demonic sym
bols battle with symbols of
salvation, and the two essential
warriors are Satan, in the form
of a spider, and the Madonna.

The Catholic iconography is
not, however, in the service of a
great theme (as it was in Scor
sese's Mean Streets), nor does it
provide a witty variation on a
conventional horror story (as in
De Palma's Carrie); in The
Fourth Man, it is the theme and
the story. Gerard lands in the
devil's spider web and only the
intervention of the Holy Mother
can save him.
Verhoeven doesn't seem to
have any ideas, so his imagery,
unlike Bertolucci's, operates
purely on the visceral level.
That's what makes The Fourth
Man such a limited film, and at
the moment I can't see Ver
hoeven directing great pictures,
unless he finds the right myth
for his temperament and ex
plores it, as Sam Peckinpah did
in his westerns and Walter Hill
started to in The Warriors and
Southern Comfort. The Fourth
Man is easy to denigrate, be
cause its fatuousness is so trans
parent and — again like Eyes of
Laura Mars — it is by nature
unlikeable, but working within
the constraints of a hollow genre
Verhoeven has made a master
ful little movie.

train from his home city,
Amsterdam, to Flessingue,
where he has been hired to ad
dress a literary club, he tries
without success to pick up a
muscular young man (Thom
Hoffman) headed for Cologne.
In Flessingue, he allows himself
to be seduced by a wealthy
widow and coiffeuse, Christine
(Renee Soutendijk, the incen
diary blonde who was the best
reason for seeing Spetters), and
— like William Holden in
Sunset Boulevard — he begins
to entertain the prospect of
remaining in her house for a
while, living off her generosity
and indulging himself in her chic
lifestyle, especially when he
learns that the Adonis from
Cologne is Christine's lover,

Hermann. On some unlikely
pretext, he persuades Christine
to invite Hermann up for a
week's visit, trusting that during
that time he'll be able to lure the
young man (who is, it turns out,
a selfish, sensuous blockhead)
into his own bed.
What makes The Fourth Man
nonsensical is the supernatural
conflict underpinning the sex
story. Gerard, a clairvoyant
(like Faye Dunaway in Laura
Mars), receives a series of
"warnings" as he approaches
Flessingue and then as he in
volves himself with Christine —
bloody nightmarish images that
recur in slightly altered form
throughout the film. The images
have astonishing clarity, and the
best ones practically lift Ver
hoeven into the Bertolucci
ranks; one, in fact — dots of
crimson tissue paper splattering
a city street like an explosion of
tiny blood corpuscles — might be
an hommage to the proliferation
of autumn leaves in Bertolucci's
The Conformist. Demonic sym
bols battle with symbols of
salvation, and the two essential
warriors are Satan, in the form
of a spider, and the Madonna.

The Catholic iconography is
not, however, in the service of a
great theme (as it was in Scor
sese's Mean Streets), nor does it
provide a witty variation on a
conventional horror story (as in
De Palma's Carrie); in The
Fourth Man, it is the theme and
the story. Gerard lands in the
devil's spider web and only the
intervention of the Holy Mother
can save him.
Verhoeven doesn't seem to
have any ideas, so his imagery,
unlike Bertolucci's, operates
purely on the visceral level.
That's what makes The Fourth
Man such a limited film, and at
the moment I can't see Ver
hoeven directing great pictures,
unless he finds the right myth
for his temperament and ex
plores it, as Sam Peckinpah did
in his westerns and Walter Hill
started to in The Warriors and
Southern Comfort. The Fourth
Man is easy to denigrate, be
cause its fatuousness is so trans
parent and — again like Eyes of
Laura Mars — it is by nature
unlikeable, but working within
the constraints of a hollow genre
Verhoeven has made a master
ful little movie.
The Dutch director Paul Ver
hoeven's flamboyant self
assurance ignites his films. He
hasn't received much critical
recognition in this country, but
his World War II espionage
picture Soldier of Orange was in
the Lives of a Bengal Lancer-
Gunga Din class of expertly
tooled, gloriously enjoyable ad
venture stories, and his latest
release, The Fourth Man, has an
exciting, sexy, ostentatious
surface. Jan De Bont's
cinematography reminds us of
Ralf Bode's in Dressed to Kill:
With glittering objects hidden
all over in unexpected places —
with a potentially glittering edge
to every object on screen, it
seems — the hero walks in con
stant danger. Verhoeven shows
he is an ingenious imagist in this
film, but it's not a museum piece
or a shimmering visual
junkyard, like the recent Cop
pola output or last year's The
Moon in the Gutter; the breath
taking skills of the editor, Ineke
Schenkkan, collaborate with
Verhoeven's instinct for timing
to keep the picture in constant
motion. (You're surprised that
it's over so soon.)

Nonsense releases Ver
hoeven's energy. Though it
stemmed from the memoirs of
an actual wartime spy, Soldier of
Orange delighted in the un
tainted bravery and panache of
its protagonists — heroes dedi
cated to comporting themselves
like heroes. Making the 1981
Spetters, about young men in
Amsterdam, Verhoeven ran
into trouble: The movie was ob
viously meant to be a serious
study, in the tradition of Fel
lini's I Vitelloni, but it was too
slick to be convincing, and yet
the details were disturbing — it
unsettled the audience to no ap
parent purpose. The violent sur
realism of The Fourth Man and
the unsavory, base characters
don't sour the experience for us,
the way Spetters was soured, be
cause we can't believe in the
ridiculous occult plot — because
we know it's junk, and that frees
us up to have a good time
watching it. In fact, the nastiness
creates the atmosphere a movie
like this requires in order to
really soar, just as the creeps in
Eyes of Laura Mars helped Irvin
Kershner to build the feeling of
impending disaster. The Fourth
Man is disreputable fun.

Jeroen Krabbe does first-rate
work in the role of a
homosexual, alcoholic author
with a petulant live-in lover
whom he fantasizes murdering,
and a gift for manipulating cir
cumstances to his own advan
tage. (The writer's name,
Gerard Reve, is also the name
of the man who penned the
novel upon which Gerard
Souteman based his
screenplay.) About to board a
train from his home city,
Amsterdam, to Flessingue,
where he has been hired to ad
dress a literary club, he tries
without success to pick up a
muscular young man (Thom
Hoffman) headed for Cologne.
