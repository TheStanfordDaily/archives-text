## 'After the Rehearsal' – recycled Bergman 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
When a famous director who has established a dis
tinctive style or tone or has adhered to a set of symbols
and obsessions throughout a long career releases a new
picture, art house audiences (and most critics) tend to
applaud familiar elements as they surface as if they
were in themselves proof of genius. There will always
be a receptive audience for a recycled exhibition like
Fellini's And the Ship Sails On, and whenever Truffaut
makes one of his charmingly inconsequential comedies
his reputation and revenue are reassured, while his
more unusual or daring attempts — Two English Girls
or The Story of Adele H. — pass virtually unnoticed.
And if you've seen enough Ingmar Bergman movies,
you can "get" all of After the Rehearsal, his acclaimed
newest chamber drama (originally made for Swedish
television), without thinking about it very hard.
A director, Henrik Volger (Erland Josephson), sits
alone on the stage after a rehearsal of his production of
Strindberg's A Dream Play, napping, his head slumped
over his script. Waking, he ponders his surroundings —
a makeshift work set comprising pieces from a variety
of other shows he has done — and his pleasure in
solitude, which is broken by the appearance of his
young leading lady, Anna Egerman (Lena Olin), on the
pretext of searching for a bracelet she left behind.
Anna, we learn, is the daughter of Henrik's best friend
and his old mistress Rakel (Ingrid Thulin), who, having
abandoned her career for her husband's sake, drank
herself to death. In the course of the film Henrik con

verses not only with Anna, who has sexual designs on
him, but also with her mother's ghost, while Bergman
shifts around the details of the set to denote the simul
taneous presence of past and present — or to suggest,
perhaps, that all we see is memory, or fantasy, or art.
Scarcely a moment in After the Rehearsal fails to ring
a bell; it's practically a recitation of whole sections of
Bergman's personal iconography. Aha, we think as
soon as we see Henrik asleep on his director's book,
this is Bergman himself, the man of the theater, the
grown-up version of Alexander in Fanny and Alexan
der, and sure enough, when Henrik tells Anna about his
backstage boyhood, watching the actors rehearse, it is
the intense, serious face of Bertil Guve (who played Al
exander) which we see in a single-image flashback. A
Dream Play, evoked in Cries and Whispers and quoted
liberally in Fanny and Alexander, represents for
Bergman (who has staged it on several occasions) the
key theatrical text, the merging of reality and dreams,
just as Strindberg's domestic nightmare plays have in a
sense given birth to every bickering couple in
Bergman's films, from Wild Strawberries through
Scenes from a Marriage. We recognize the doubling of
the two women, who enact virtually the same seduction
scene with Henrik, from Wild Strawberries and espe
cially from Persona, and the technique — the sleight of
hand with the sets, the two (or three?) levels of reality
— is, of course, a widely copied Bergman trademark.
Even the name "Anna Egerman" has emblematic
weight, since in Smiles of a Summer Night the actress,

Desiree, confesses she has always loved a lawyer named
Egerman, who may be the father of her daughter;
Rakel's story is a soured version of Desiree's in which
the actress ends up trading her career for love and
regretting it for the rest of her life. To add another
variation on this old scheme, Rakel taunts Henrik by
hinting that Anna may be his child.
By merely scrambling his old files like this, Bergman
runs the risk of self-parody, particularly when he fur
nishes his central character with a fragmented interior
monologue that sounds like the work of a Bergman im
itator. Last year's Fanny and Alexander contained doz
ens of signposts, too, but the Dickensian narrative
unified and strengthened it, and it was a lush, sensuous
experience — full of vital supporting roles (wonderfully
acted) and breathtaking imagery. After the Rehearsal is
well paced and visually varied; Erland Josephson reads
his lines skillfully; and after a rocky beginning, Lena
Olin justifies Henrik's faith in this young actress — we
start to see both passion and poise, restlessness and
concentration. Two or three scenes contain surprising
rhythms, and Josephson has one fine moment — in
which, having given Anna some new staging for a scene
she finds frustrating, he conveys both the exhaustion of
the director whose actors are continually sapping his
energy and Henrik's contentment in having generated a
response in Anna, who immediately sets to work on the
scene. (We can see, too, Henrik's pride in his casting
choice.) But on the whole this
picture feels like a repeat per
formance, and some of the
dialogue is appallingly trite.
Henrik/Bergman starts the film
off with the revelation that a
deserted theater after a rehear
sal is a very different place, and
he even hands out such antique
observations as "The living are
like ghosts" and "We actors are
often childish. Or how would it
be possible?"
Potentially the most interest
ing conflict in After the Rehear
sal pits the meticulous — almost
surgical — Henrik, who admits

that as an artist he only appears
to be spontaneous and im
pulsive, against the slovenly, al
coholic Rakel, who says that for
her theater is "filth" and "lust",
that she abhors Henrik's
"cleanliness." It might have
been revealing for Bergman to
confront that dichotomy in him
self — his attraction to emotion
and sexuality in all its untidi
ness, yet his commitment to for
malism as both a structural and
a stylistic guiding principle.
(Fanny and Alexander spilled
over the edges; that's why it was
such a delight to sit through.)
But as Bergman has written
Rakel's part, and as played by
Ingrid Thulin — suffering under
the most unkind hairdo any
actress has had to wear since

Diane Keaton in Interiors —
there's no contest: Control tri
umphs hands down over excess.
Rakel is so unappealing — and
so transparent — that we don't

wonder how he explained the
role to Ingrid Thulin, who in
one pathetic moment has to pull
up her skirt and her blouse to
prove to Henrik how firm and

even comprehend her mag
netism for Henrik; when he
agrees to make love to her, we
assume pity and not passion
motivates his action, despite his
insistence that she has always
aroused him. Bergman may
have a block about this; I

girlish her thighs and breasts
still are.
At one point Rakel does an
extemporaneous speech (from
The Bacchae, if I'm not mis
taken), and then smiles with
smug satisfaction at her perfor

mance. Thulin handles this mo
ment nicely (it's her best), but
we're clearly supposed to see
the mediocrity in Rakel's acting
here — to register that she's
destroyed her own talent. If
Bergman had allowed this
fading souse an instant of glory,
he would have scored a point for
the unpredictability of human
behavior, and admitted the life
force into this barred-up cham
ber play for one scene at least.
Instead he sticks to the security
of old patterns, old strategies.
"This is my fifth production of
A Dream Play, and perhaps
there will be a sixth," Henrik
tells Anna, and despite the gen
eral critical approbation of After
the Rehearsal, I heard myself
muttering in protest.
