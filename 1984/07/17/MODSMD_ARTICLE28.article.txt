Reagan condemns Soviets
Washington — Portraying communist rule as a
tyranny that "puts itself above God," President
Reagan said yesterday that the people of the Soviet
bloc "were taken captives by force and remain
captives by force."
In a ceremony marking the observance of
"Captive Nations Week," the president said the
"ugly, sinister walls " of the Soviet system "continue
to deny for the millions trapped behind them the
most basic yearnings of the human spirit."
He signed a declaration pledging the United
States to renew efforts to encourage freedom and
national independence "for those countries strug
gling to free themselves from communist ideology
and totalitarian oppression."
In a speech to an audience composed mostly of
representatives of groups from Eastern Europe,
Southeast Asia and Cuba, Reagan called again on
the Kremlin to allow outside observers to determine
the condition of Nobel Prize winner Andrei Sak
harov and his wife, Yelena Bonner.
In remarks reminiscent of his earlier description
of the Soviet system as an "evil empire," the presi
dent called Marxist totalitarianism the world's
greatest challenge to human rights.
Andropov named envoy
Athens, Greece — A government spokeman said
yesterday that the Soviet Union has officially put
forward the name of Igor Andropov, son of the late
Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, to be the next ambas
sador to Greece.
Spokesman Dimitris Maroudas told reporters that
the request is being studied by the government, but
that such applications are usually accepted.
Andropov, about 38, would replace Ambassador
Vladimir Kaboshkin. Andropov was promoted to
the rank of ambassador in June while serving as dep
uty leader of the Soviet delegation to the East-West
disarmament conference in Stockholm, Sweden.
The Athens post is considered important because
of Greece's membership in NATO and its small but
influential pro-Moscow Communist Party.

Shultz visits New Zealand
Wellington, New Zealand — Australia's visiting
foreign minister said yesterday that New Zealand's
newly elected leader will get a blunt and early warn
ing from Australia and the United States that his
party's policies on nuclear issues will completely un
dermine the defense treaty linking the three
countries.
The warning by Australian Foreign Minister Bill
Hayden came as Secretary of State George Shultz
arrived here in the midst of a New Zealand political
storm with the newly elected prime minister and the
lame-duck incumbent publicly feuding over emer
gency steps to protect the country's currency.
Shultz's effort to preserve the Australia-New
Zealand-United States (ANZUS) military alliance
appeared to be affected by the fray.
Hayden told journalists that both he and Shultz
will deal bluntly with David Lange, the incoming
Labor prime minister, on the contentious nuclear
issue.
The United States is greatly disturbed by the
Labor Party's declared stand that no nuclear
powered or nuclear-armed ships, including those of
the United States, can enter New Zealand waters or
ports.
Polish police acquitted
Warsaw, Poland — In a development expected to
intensify Poland's simmering political divisions, a
Warsaw court yesterday acquitted two policemen in
connection with the beating death of a youthful
Solidarity trade union supporter following his arrest
in May of last year.
The father of 19-year-old Grzegorz Przemyk and
those few friends and other relatives allowed into
the packed central Warsaw courtroom rose and left
in apparent protest immediately after the verdicts
were read but before the chief judge began a lengthy
justification of the decision.
Przemyk died from severe abdominal injuries sus
tained two days after he was picked up by riot police
in a Warsaw town square. His death sparked a
public anger that brought some 20,000 persons to
his funeral in a spontaneous mass protest against
brutal police interrogation methods used against
Solidarity sympathizers.
The ruling came despite the opinion of an expert

medical team that the youth was most likely beaten
before leaving the police station and Przemyk's own
statement prior to his death that he had been beaten
by police.
FBI probes Edwin Gray
Washington — The FBI is investigating allega
tions that Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, improperly used a special
entertainment fund and failed to account fully for
extensive redecoration of his office, according to
reliable sources.
Gray, a longtime friend of President Reagan and
White House counselor Edwin Meese 111, has spent
$47,254 in federal funds to renovate his office and
surrounding reception area since his appointment
last year, according to the sources. They said the
bank board erroneously told Congress that the
renovations amounted to $17,442.
Gray said yesterday that the renovation work was
needed for security reasons and to reorganize the
working space of his top staff.
Sources said the FBI probe of Gray, which is at an
early stage, follows a nearly completed investigation
by the bank board's Office of Internal Evaluation
and Compliance that began with an employee's
complaint.
COCOM limits tech trade
London — The NATO allies and Japan have
agreed to tighten controls further on sales of large
computers to the Soviet Union and its allies and
have established guidelines for the sale of the
smaller, desktop variety, according to diplomatic
sources here and U.S. officials in Washington.
The agreement also extends controls for the first
time to computer software and such items as sophis
ticated telecommunications switching equipment.
Under the accord, however, the sale of many vari
eties of commonly available desktop computers
would be free of controls, an issue which has been
the subject of a long-running political and bureau
cratic battle in Washington.
The agreement was reached in Paris last Thursday
during a closed-door meeting of the super-secret 15-
nation coordinating committee on strategic exports,
known as COCOM, which must approve sales of
sensitive items to Warsaw Pact nations.

brutal police interrogation methods used against
Solidarity sympathizers.
The ruling came despite the opinion of an expert

medical team that the youth was most likely beaten
before leaving the police station and Przemyk's own
statement prior to his death that he had been beaten
by police.
FBI probes Edwin Gray
Washington — The FBI is investigating allega
tions that Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, improperly used a special
entertainment fund and failed to account fully for
extensive redecoration of his office, according to
reliable sources.
Gray, a longtime friend of President Reagan and
White House counselor Edwin Meese 111, has spent
$47,254 in federal funds to renovate his office and
surrounding reception area since his appointment
last year, according to the sources. They said the
bank board erroneously told Congress that the
renovations amounted to $17,442.
Gray said yesterday that the renovation work was
needed for security reasons and to reorganize the
working space of his top staff.
Sources said the FBI probe of Gray, which is at an
early stage, follows a nearly completed investigation
by the bank board's Office of Internal Evaluation
and Compliance that began with an employee's
complaint.
COCOM limits tech trade
London — The NATO allies and Japan have
agreed to tighten controls further on sales of large
computers to the Soviet Union and its allies and
have established guidelines for the sale of the
smaller, desktop variety, according to diplomatic
sources here and U.S. officials in Washington.
The agreement also extends controls for the first
time to computer software and such items as sophis
ticated telecommunications switching equipment.
Under the accord, however, the sale of many vari
eties of commonly available desktop computers
would be free of controls, an issue which has been
the subject of a long-running political and bureau
cratic battle in Washington.
The agreement was reached in Paris last Thursday
during a closed-door meeting of the super-secret 15-
nation coordinating committee on strategic exports,
known as COCOM, which must approve sales of
sensitive items to Warsaw Pact nations.

Reagan condemns Soviets
Washington — Portraying communist rule as a
tyranny that "puts itself above God," President
Reagan said yesterday that the people of the Soviet
bloc "were taken captives by force and remain
captives by force."
In a ceremony marking the observance of
"Captive Nations Week," the president said the
"ugly, sinister walls " of the Soviet system "continue
to deny for the millions trapped behind them the
most basic yearnings of the human spirit."
He signed a declaration pledging the United
States to renew efforts to encourage freedom and
national independence "for those countries strug
gling to free themselves from communist ideology
and totalitarian oppression."
In a speech to an audience composed mostly of
representatives of groups from Eastern Europe,
Southeast Asia and Cuba, Reagan called again on
the Kremlin to allow outside observers to determine
the condition of Nobel Prize winner Andrei Sak
harov and his wife, Yelena Bonner.
In remarks reminiscent of his earlier description
of the Soviet system as an "evil empire," the presi
dent called Marxist totalitarianism the world's
greatest challenge to human rights.
Andropov named envoy
Athens, Greece — A government spokeman said
yesterday that the Soviet Union has officially put
forward the name of Igor Andropov, son of the late
Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, to be the next ambas
sador to Greece.
Spokesman Dimitris Maroudas told reporters that
the request is being studied by the government, but
that such applications are usually accepted.
Andropov, about 38, would replace Ambassador
Vladimir Kaboshkin. Andropov was promoted to
the rank of ambassador in June while serving as dep
uty leader of the Soviet delegation to the East-West
disarmament conference in Stockholm, Sweden.
The Athens post is considered important because
of Greece's membership in NATO and its small but
influential pro-Moscow Communist Party.

Shultz visits New Zealand
Wellington, New Zealand — Australia's visiting
foreign minister said yesterday that New Zealand's
newly elected leader will get a blunt and early warn
ing from Australia and the United States that his
party's policies on nuclear issues will completely un
dermine the defense treaty linking the three
countries.
The warning by Australian Foreign Minister Bill
Hayden came as Secretary of State George Shultz
arrived here in the midst of a New Zealand political
storm with the newly elected prime minister and the
lame-duck incumbent publicly feuding over emer
gency steps to protect the country's currency.
Shultz's effort to preserve the Australia-New
Zealand-United States (ANZUS) military alliance
appeared to be affected by the fray.
Hayden told journalists that both he and Shultz
will deal bluntly with David Lange, the incoming
Labor prime minister, on the contentious nuclear
issue.
The United States is greatly disturbed by the
Labor Party's declared stand that no nuclear
powered or nuclear-armed ships, including those of
the United States, can enter New Zealand waters or
ports.
Polish police acquitted
Warsaw, Poland — In a development expected to
intensify Poland's simmering political divisions, a
Warsaw court yesterday acquitted two policemen in
connection with the beating death of a youthful
Solidarity trade union supporter following his arrest
in May of last year.
The father of 19-year-old Grzegorz Przemyk and
those few friends and other relatives allowed into
the packed central Warsaw courtroom rose and left
in apparent protest immediately after the verdicts
were read but before the chief judge began a lengthy
justification of the decision.
Przemyk died from severe abdominal injuries sus
tained two days after he was picked up by riot police
in a Warsaw town square. His death sparked a
public anger that brought some 20,000 persons to
his funeral in a spontaneous mass protest against
brutal police interrogation methods used against
Solidarity sympathizers.
The ruling came despite the opinion of an expert

medical team that the youth was most likely beaten
before leaving the police station and Przemyk's own
statement prior to his death that he had been beaten
by police.
