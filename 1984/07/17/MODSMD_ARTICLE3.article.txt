# Band, crowd, traffic greet Olympic torch
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
I was with the band and about
a thousand other people waiting
for the Olympic torch.
The torch was going to be
late, they told us. We wouldn't
be playing for at least two hours.
Apparently the route was too
crowded for it to arrive on time,
so the Olympic Committee at
Stanford began announcing that
the 8:30 p.m. program would
start at 9:30 on Maloney Field

and the band would play until
the torch arrived at 10:40.
That was okay with the band.
After all, the Olympic people
had donated a keg of beer for
our pre-torch practice. Perfect
for drinking games.
We certainly couldn't blame
the torch for being late. After
all, it had a rough day.
Earlier, as it made its way
down through Marin and
Sausalito and over Golden Gate
Bridge to Golden Gate Park
and City Hall, thousands had
gathered and cheered in a
seemingly endless stream of
people.
As it crossed the panhandle of
Golden Gate Park, Joseph May,
a photographer, explained why
he was anxiously waiting for

hours for the flame to go by.
"It isn't every day an Olympic
torch runs by my house," he
said.
Another bystander, 31 year
old middle school science
teacher Madison Robinson 111,
explained that it was "much bet-

ter to see it live than on TV," as
he watched the people in the
packed terraces and lawns of the
Victorian homes.
At Stanford the crowd was
excited. They cheered for the
band when they noticed them
