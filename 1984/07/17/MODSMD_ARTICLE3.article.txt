# Band, crowd, traffic greet Olympic torch
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
I was with the band and about
a thousand other people waiting
for the Olympic torch.
The torch was going to be
late, they told us. We wouldn't
be playing for at least two hours.
Apparently the route was too
crowded for it to arrive on time,
so the Olympic Committee at
Stanford began announcing that
the 8:30 p.m. program would
start at 9:30 on Maloney Field

Reporter's Notebook

and the band would play until
the torch arrived at 10:40.
That was okay with the band.
After all, the Olympic people
had donated a keg of beer for
our pre-torch practice. Perfect
for drinking games.
We certainly couldn't blame
the torch for being late. After
all, it had a rough day.
Earlier, as it made its way
down through Marin and
Sausalito and over Golden Gate
Bridge to Golden Gate Park
and City Hall, thousands had
gathered and cheered in a
seemingly endless stream of
people.
As it crossed the panhandle of
Golden Gate Park, Joseph May,
a photographer, explained why
he was anxiously waiting for

hours for the flame to go by.
"It isn't every day an Olympic
torch runs by my house," he
said.
Another bystander, 31 year
old middle school science
teacher Madison Robinson 111,
explained that it was "much bet-

ter to see it live than on TV," as
he watched the people in the
packed terraces and lawns of the
Victorian homes.
At Stanford the crowd was
excited. They cheered for the
band when they noticed them

behind the brightly lit stage.
But there was not enough
room for us amongst the crowd,
the choir and the banjo troupe.
We moved to the other side of
the field about 20 minutes later
and began to play.
The torch had spent the day
in the company of 10 policemen
on motorbikes, as well as
bicycle-riders and joggers just
following along for the heck of
it. A media truck's siding held
10 reporters from falling out as
they leaned over the torch be
hind them.
When it arrived in Oakland,
after winding through San
Leandro and Hayward, Oak
land Mayor Lionel Wilson took
the handoff.
The crowd cheered, flags
waved, whistles blew.
Waiting for the torch, I
tromboned my lips into jelly.
We noticed people were
walking away from the stage
toward El Camino. Jim Kohn,
the band leader, led us over
there.
Perhaps 5000 or so people
packed the street between Gal
vez and California Avenues.

In their excitement, they swore
at us as we arrived.
Squished and tired of playing,
we watched as the crowd rushed
the street. Thinking it was com
ing, Jim whistled for us to play
"All Right Now." The crowd
cheered.
It was still two miles back.
We played some more.
"The torch went out when
they passed it to the Stanford
holding Lamp," someone
yelled. On Palm Drive, the
flame was to be captured in a
fireman's lamp and kept until
opening ceremonies on the
29th.
We laughed.
I missed the torch when it
passed Stanford. Too many
people were crowding and I
couldn't see over their heads as
I played "All Right Now" for
the second time. I just saw a
bunch of flashing lights and a
truck full of cameras. Congress
man Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos)
was carrying it and passed it to a
Mountain View runner.
I think I saw the smoke.
The torch is now on its way to
Los Angeles. It will arrive in
two weeks if it makes it through
the crowds. We just laughed and
smiled.
