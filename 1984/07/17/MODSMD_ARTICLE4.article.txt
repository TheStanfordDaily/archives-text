# SUNet connects campus tech
## 
### LYDIA ROBINSON 
The Board of Trustees recently approved a $3.7
million expenditure to fund the Stanford Univer
sity Network (SUNet), a system that will share in
formation and communicate with other systems
through the interconnection of computer termi
nals.
Projected for completion in December 1985,
SUNet will connect large computer systems, mini
computers and microcomputers through a broad
band wire cable. Broadband is a high frequency
signal often used for radio or television broad
casts.
The integrated computer network will permit
sharing of expensive hardware, (printers, storage
facilities, typesetting equipment), and software,
(programs and data base systems), which other
wise would only be accessible to users of a partic
ular system.
"SUNet is projected to directly connect almost
all of the undergraduate dorms, as well as inter
connecting a direct access to Terman Engineering,
Serra, Crothers Memorial, McCullough and GSB
(Graduate School of Business), to name a few,"
said William Yundt, head of Network, Academic
Computer and Information Systems.
"We're also hoping to connect SUNet to Es

condido Village, graduate student housing and
faculty and staff areas through the Palo Alto cable
TV system," he added.
A task force report noted the connecting of
computer information would enable:
• students to collaborate on group project, read
course materials and class notes, or search library
catalog files for references.
• staff members to prepare and receive data or
messages and obtain information from the admin
istration for report preparation.
• faculty members to prepare and revise articles,
coordinate conferences with colleagues at other
institutions, or search private files to locate previ
ously prepared documents.
More than 1800 personal computers were or
dered by students and faculty this spring. Close to
5000 computers are now on campus.
"Our biggest problem is the explosion of per
sonal computers, which can be connected to the
network," Yundt said, "with the projected sum of
these, we'll need close to 10,000 connections."
SUNet already has two miles of interconnecting
wire from Forsythe and Pine Hall to the Medical
Center, GSB, and Encina Hall.
SUNet's control systems will be housed in Pine
Hall and the Press building.
The money approved by the trustees in June
"will only provide for the local roadwork," Yundt
said, "no driveways, side streets, lights, stop signs,
or garages are provided for."
The rest of the funding will have to come from
within his own department's resources, Yundt
added.

SUNet's estimated costs, including other com
puter activities, are projected at $881,000 for
1985-86. The operating budget for networking
during 1984-85 has been approved at $389,000.
"Stanford spends over $35 million a year on its
current methods of preparing text and communi
cating by messages,"' noted the report, "although
the savings from an integrated system are not ex
pected to be dynamic in the short run, the long
term benefits could be substantial."
Institutions which are currently planning similar
networks include Brown University, Duke Uni
versity, MIT, Cornell, and the University of
Arizona.
