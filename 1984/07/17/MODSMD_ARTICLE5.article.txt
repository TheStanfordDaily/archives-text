# Paul to sue for tenure
## 
### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
With her tenure appeal still
pending in President Kennedy's
office. Assistant Prof, of Religi
ous Studies Diana Paul has filed
a lawsuit against Stanford,
charging sexual and racial bias
were the basis of her tenure
denial.
The suit, which was filed June
29 in Santa Clara Superior
Court, asks that Stanford either
be ordered to grant tenure to
Paul, or allow her a new tenure
review process that would be
free of bias.
Paul, who is part-Japanese,
was hired by Stanford in 1975 to
teach Chinese and Indian Bud
dhism. She was denied tenure a

year ago by a five-member
panel of "referees" chosen by
her department. The panel
rejected her appeal; to be ac
cepted for tenure one must rate
outstanding in either research or

teaching, and Paul received
"outstanding" ratings in neither
category.
Paul has appealed three
times, first to her department,
then to Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells, and
finally to Kennedy. In her ap
peal, she contends that due to
racial and sexual discrimination,
she was given a "procedurally
flawed" tenure review, and
reviewed by referees who either
were not involved in her special
ized field or had a conflict of in
terest in reaching their decision.
According to Assistant to the
President Robert Hamrdla,
Kennedy has received the ap


Diana Paul
peal and has turned it over to a
faculty advisory committee,
which will make a decision in "a
couple of weeks' time."
Hamrdla said he didn't know
whether or not Paul's decision
to file suit against the University
would affect the advisory
board's decision-making
process.
Dara Schur, Paul's attorney,
said Paul would prefer the issue
"to be resplved within the Uni
versity." Paul said she is hoping
for a "reasonable" decision
from Kennedy, but that the
statute of limitations on griev
ances made it necessary for her

to file her suit before Kennedy
could reach his decision.
Paul said that if she does not
eventually get tenure, she may
have to switch careers after ten
years of teaching at Stanford.
There just aren't any other
academic jobs around," she
said, "especially in the field that
I'm in. This could be the end of
my academic career."
If Paul leaves in September,
she will have three part-time
replacements: Lewis Gomez, a
visiting associate professor from
the University of Michigan, and
two others. Paul said Gomez
was one of her orginal referees.
"That is what I mean by a con
flict of interest," she said.
If she does return to the de
partment, Paul said, the Univer

sity is legally committed to res
toring her to her old post with
her old salary. The three addi
tional people the Religious
Studies department has hired
would also remain. "This would
mean that five people at the
University would be teaching
Buddhism," she said (at present
Prof Carl Bielefeldt is teaching
Japanese Buddhism). "I know
my classes are crowded, but that
would be ridiculous."
Paul believes she has a good
chance of winning tenure, either
at the internal level or through
her lawsuit. "I think I have a
very good chance of winning a
suit against Stanford," she said,
"but I really don t want to go
through the ordeal . . . who ever
wants to go to court?"
