With her tenure appeal still
pending in President Kennedy's
office. Assistant Prof, of Religi
ous Studies Diana Paul has filed
a lawsuit against Stanford,
charging sexual and racial bias
were the basis of her tenure
denial.
The suit, which was filed June
29 in Santa Clara Superior
Court, asks that Stanford either
be ordered to grant tenure to
Paul, or allow her a new tenure
review process that would be
free of bias.
Paul, who is part-Japanese,
was hired by Stanford in 1975 to
teach Chinese and Indian Bud
dhism. She was denied tenure a

year ago by a five-member
panel of "referees" chosen by
her department. The panel
rejected her appeal; to be ac
cepted for tenure one must rate
outstanding in either research or

teaching, and Paul received
"outstanding" ratings in neither
category.
Paul has appealed three
times, first to her department,
then to Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells, and
finally to Kennedy. In her ap
peal, she contends that due to
racial and sexual discrimination,
she was given a "procedurally

reviewed by referees who either
were not involved in her special
ized field or had a conflict of in

According to Assistant to the
President Robert Hamrdla,
