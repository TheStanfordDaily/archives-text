## Democratic convention kicks off Mondale camp calls for party unity, attacks Reagan 
### 
San I rancisco (AP) — Democrats
opened their 39th national convention
yesterday with a keynote address
denouncing President Reagan's
' hysterical commitment to an arms
race, while Walter Mondale agreed to a
unity summit with his two losing rivals
tor the presidential nomination.
One speaker after another at the con
vention's opening session uttered the
ritual victory predictions for the Demo
cratic ticket, but Rep. Morris Udall ot
tered a trank, hopeful assessment.
"Sure we're behind tonight and
everybody knows it,"he said. "But
we've got 100 days to go."
Mondale, with more than enough,
votes to nominate himself and running
mate Geraldine Ferraro, arranged the
peace meeting with Sen. Gary Hart and
the Rev. Jesse Jackson as their aides
negotiated over last-minute changes in
the party platform.
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
Mondale's handpicked keynote orator,
said Reagan's policies could "lead us to
bankruptcy or war . . . Our policy drifts
with no real direction other than an hys
terical commitment to an arms race that
leads nowhere — if we're lucky," he said.
He appealed for party unity, and said
Republican policies "divide the nation
into the lucky and the left-out, the
royalty and the rabble." He decried the
current federal budget as "the largest in
the history of the universe."
Former President Carter, who
preceded Cuomo to the platform,
received a standing ovation — but much
less enthusiasm — as he launched an at
tack against the man who routed him in
the 1980 election.
In a speech heard during prime time

television broadcasts due to convention
delays, Carter said that under Reagan,
the United States has "acquired a
reputation for unwanted belligerence,"
and withdrawn from the worldwide bat
tle for human rights.
"This must change," said Carter. "A
Democratic president will make it clear
again that as we move to reduce the
threat of nuclear war, any obstacle lies in
the Kremlin — not in the White House."
Mondale and Ferraro came to San
Francisco earlier in the day to await their
installation as the Democratic ticket.
Ferraro had the lead role at two arrival
rallies on the day of her 24th wedding
anniversary.
Mondale had resisted a three
candidate meeting before the nomina
tion. Bert Lance, newly installed as gen
eral campaign chairman, set up the ses
sion after he met with Hart and Jackson,
and said later, "This is the time for us to
begin the healing process in the Demo
cratic party."
Their nominating triumphs will come
later in the week. The first of 13
opening-day political speeches began im
mediately after the gavel fell, with plenty
of ceremony following.
Almost as the session opened, police
arrested about 100 demonstrators a half
mile from the convention hall for block
ing streets in a non-violent protest
against nuclear weapons.
Party chairman Charles Manatt
rapped the opening gavel only two
minutes past the official 2 p.m. starting
time, mounting the podium to overlook a
hall in which almost no one was seated.
Instead, thousands of delegates, al
ternates, guests and reporters conducted
their own business, ignoring Manatt.

The huge hall slowly filled with the
party faithful. Mondale signs, blue and
white with small red stripes, competed
with the bright red Hart standards, while
Jackson's face looked out from hundreds
of photographs.
Early speeches were all but ignored,
but the presence of former 1 reasury Sec
retary John Connally high above the
floor in the Cable News Network televi
sion tower provoked a spontaneous
demonstration. "Kick John Out,
shouted hundreds of delegates, making a
"thumbs down" gesture. Connally, a
former Democratic governor ot Texas
turned Republican, simply smiled.
Under Chairman Manatt's hand, the
opening business went smoothly, as the
credentials report was approved without
dissent.
There was irony in his role, for
Mondale fired him as chairman on Satur
day, only to reinstate him Sunday after a
vociferous protest from party leaders and
union supporters.
"I'm not saying this was handled per
fectly. Obviously, it wasn't," Mondale
said before his arrival in the convention
city.
Once in San Francisco, Mondale and
his new political partner spoke to women
leaders, many of whom had tears of joy
in their eyes at the sight of the Mondale-
Ferraro ticket.
Surrounded by more than 1,000 wo
men, most of whom had paid $ 1 50 to at
tend the "Celebration of American Wo
men" to raise money for female candi
dates, Mondale brought the crowd to its
feet when he said it was "with joy and
pride" that he introduced his campaign
partner.
In a line reminiscent of the late Presi

dent John F. Kennedy, Mondale said
"The question is what we — all of us —'
can do for our country if everyone has a
chance."
Echoing that thought, Ferraro said
"What this ticket is all about is not what
America can do for women, but what
women can do for America."
In the next 100 days, she added, " we
will invite Americans to join with us in
working for the future."
The party's likely nominees then went
to an outdoor rally in a sunken park a
few blocks from the convention center
where "Ferraro" posters were at least as
numerous as "Mondale" posters
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland
urged delegates to forget the "foul-ups
and quarrels" of the past and concen
trate on electing Mondale-Ferraro.
Manatt told the delegates that by re
electing Reagan "America would choose
the greater risk of nuclear war.
By electing the Democratic candi
date, Americans can choose to bring the
terror of the arms race to an end," he
said.
He stressed the unity theme: "Unity is
not a casaual slogan. It is a choice a
hard choice in which we give up some of
the things we want in order to get those
things we cannot do without."
Jackson is scheduled to speak to the
convention today, the final act of a cam
paign drama that has occasionally upset
establishment party leaders but given
them hope, as well, because of his appeal
among previously unregistered black
voters. "There will be fascination, and
trepidation, and hope in the minds of the
delegates when Jesse Jackson comes to
the podium," said Sen. Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.).
