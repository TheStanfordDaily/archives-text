San Francisco (AP) — Walter
Mondale arrived here for the
opening of the Democratic Na
tional Convention on Monday
and met with Sen. Guiy Hart
and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, his
two opponents for the presiden
tial nomination, saying he was
willing "to discuss anything they
wish."
The meeting at the Fairmont
Hotel on Nob Hill began shortly
after 8 p.m., as the convention's
opening session was still going
on a few miles away.
The three candidates ap
peared jointly after an hour
long meeting and said that while
significant differences remain
among them, they are more in
agreement than disagreement.
With the Democratic contest
nearly over, Jackson said, "We
reserve the right to be competi
tive until the very end." But he
added: "There is now a need
more and more to cooperate."
Both Hart and Mondale
praised the convention keynote
speech by New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo and said it sym
bolized the fall election cam

paign, which they said must
unify Democrats and end Presi
dent Reagan's time in the White
House.
Mondale said, "This was not a
meeting to negotiate."
In their initial account of the
closed meeting, none of the
three candidates described any
specific issues discussed among
them.
In a display of party unity that
the likely nominee hopes will set
the tone for convention week,
Mondale said he agreed to the
meeting after talking to each of
the other candidates and learn
ing "that's what each wanted to
do."
Asked to comment on a
report that Hart would allow his
name to be placed in nomina
tion and then ask that it be
withdrawn, Mondale said, "I
hadn't heard that, but I'd be
willing to hear it."
Mondale in the past said he
would prefer to meet with his
Democratic opponents individ
ually. Asked why he changed his
mind, he said, "I really had no
objections" to a joint meeting.
