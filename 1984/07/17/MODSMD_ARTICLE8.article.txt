# Nuclear suppliers weigh proliferation safeguards

### 
Washington — Nations that supply nuclear
technology to the rest of the world met secretly
in Luxembourg last week to discuss tightening
controls over the technology, administration
officials said yesterday.
Worried that too many nations are obtaining
the capacity to build nuclear bombs, the 13
countries agreed for the first time that all na
tions that buy nuclear equipment should some
how be required to have safeguards on all their
nuclear facilities, including research reactors
and power plants, to prevent weapons con
struction and theft of materials.
They did not agree, however, on how such a
result is to be achieved, according to officials
who described the talks privately.
Administration officials who arranged the
gathering said there had previously been such
dissent among the supplier nations over whe
ther to have any kind of agreement that the
Luxembourg meeting was a victory in itself.
It was kept secret, they said, in order not to
antagonize further the nations seeking to buy
nuclear technology, many of which complain
that the nuclear "haves" unjustly discriminate
against "have-not" countries by dictating
terms and questioning their peaceful inten
tions.
The officials said they were pleased that the
participants agreed to meet again and to

produce papers tor future discussion on issues
in the debate over nuclear proliferation. "They
did make progress toward some limitation on
shipments of (nuclear) supplies," said White
House spokesman Larry Speakes, "and we
look forward to continuing these talks in the
future."
The supplier nations had not met since the
so-called London Suppliers Group gathering in
1977. Participants in last week's meeting,
which officials said was not a club gathering,
were Australia (a new member), Belgium,
Canada, West Germany, France, Italy, Japan,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Swit
zerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States.
By mutual agreement, officials said, the So
viet Union, Czechoslovakia, East Germany
and Poland were not invited, even though they
have been members of the London Suppliers
Group since its founding in 1974.
The United States has been pressing other
supplier nations to join it in requiring compre
hensive safeguards as a condition of all nuclear
technology sales. But controls are complex and
difficult to enforce, requiring a nation to pro
vide information on its internal transfers of
equipment and on all its nuclear purchases,
and to install controls on facilities built earlier.
