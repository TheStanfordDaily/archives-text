# COMMENTARY
## Prof. William Poser Criticism of psychology dept. unjustified 
### 
Professor Ronald Hilton's article "Can
this faith really move mountains?" (July
6 Daily) mounts a misleading and unwar
ranted attack upon the department of
psychology to which I feel compelled to
reply.
Hilton begins with the unfortunately
vague assertion that most departments of
psychology are "... mechanistic, or
shall we say Skinnerian." If
"mechanistic" is taken to be a synonym
for "Skinnerian," the claim is simply
false. Skinnerian behaviorism long ago
ceased to be the dominant trend in aca
demic psychology. The entire thrust of
the cognitive science movement is at
odds with it. If "mechanistic" refers to
the scientific materialist belief that all
natural phenomena can ultimately be ex
plained without reference to an im
material mind, the accusation is probably
true, but this position is in no way incom
patible with the existence of psychic
phenomena.
The word phenomena is crucial here,
for there are two sorts of claims in para
psychology. One is that there are

phenomena for which, at present, we
have no adequate scientific account. The
second adds to this the claim that there
can be no physical account. This latter,
stronger claim is indeed incompatible
with scientific materialism, but the diffi
culty concerns the nature of the explana
tion, not the existence of the
phenomena. Indeed, much of the interest
in parapsychology by physicists has been
due to the possibility of explaining psy
chic phenomena as resulting from quan
tum effects such as the Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen paradox (See Oteri
1975). Should evidence be found for
psychic phenomena, nothing in principle
prevents the construction of materialist
accounts for these phenomena. For ex
ample, the claim that ESP exists amounts
to the assertion that there are sensory
modalities other than the ones currently
known to us. Should this prove to be
true, we might discover a new sensory
system, just as we have discovered echo
location in bats and avian sensitivity to
magnetic fields.
Hilton then claims that psychologists
have been uninterested in parapsychol

ogy while physicists and engineers are its
proponents. As Randi (1980) and
Gardner (1981) have pointed out, this is
not surprising: physicists are accustomed
to research in which the objects of inves
tigation cannot cheat, consciously or un
consciously. Consequently, they are
more likely to be taken in by psychic
claims than are psychologists or
magicians. Fortunately, this group
represents a minority of physicists â€”
indeed in 1979 John Archibald Wheeler,
one of the world's leading theoretical
physicists, called for the expulsion of the
parapsychology section from the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement of
Science on the grounds that parapsychol
ogy has not, as yet, produced a single
solid result. ("Drive the Pseudos out of
the Workshop of Science" and "A De
cade of Permissiveness" reprinted in
Gardner 1981).
This last claim is really the crux of the
matter. In spite of much literature on the
subject, there is little solid evidence for
the existence of psychic phenomena.
Time and time again experiments pur

porting to demonstrate the existence of
such phenomena have been shown to be
improperly designed, incorrectly inter
preted, or the results of outright fraud.
Randi (1980) and Gardner (1981) con
tain numerous case studies.
What then of Russell Targ? Is his work
solid? Is he really "... the only Ameri
can with a detailed personal knowledge
of Soviet research in this field?" Targ's
work is not exactly uncontroversial.
Randi's (1980) chapter "The Laurel and
Hardy of psi" and Gardner (1981) con
tain considerable illustrations of this.
Research in parapsychology suffers
from a severe lack of credibility, not just
among psychologists but among all scien
tists. Its status is due to the lack of hard
results, not the philosophical propen
sities of psychologists. Prof. Hilton is not
more justified in his attack on the psy
chology department than he would be in
attacking the chemistry department for
its lack of interest in the Philosopher's
Stone.
