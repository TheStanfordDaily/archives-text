— THE 1984 1
OLYMPIC SOCCER GAMES
AT
STANFORD
JULY 29-AUGUST 8
For these eleven days, international attention will focus on Stanford
as the University hosts the preliminary, quarter, and semifinal rounds
of the 1984 Olympic soccer competition.
During this period, The Stanford Daily, will publish three special
Olympic Editions — filled with related articles, photos, and statistics.
To effectively reach the thousands of Olympic visitors, circulation for
each of these publications will be increased to 20,000. Distribution
will be vastly expanded in Palo Alto and Stanford, and will include
points around the Stadium itself.
The Daily is looking to hire several people to help with this expanded
distribution. If you are interested in working at the Olympics, and
getting paid for it, please contact Kelvin Davis at 497-2554.
WATCH FOR THESE SPECIAL EDITIONS!
