# Convention gives media its message
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
San Francisco — "I have to
admit, I'm a little down."
That was the message last
week from an NBC News editor
to his staff, busy preparing to
cover this week's Democratic
National Convention.
Walter Mondale had just let
the few remaining summer
breezes out of journalism's sails
by announcing his vice
presidential choice four days
before the convention would
begin.
The only decent story of the
convention seemed to be gone,
leaving the Democratic Na
tional Convention little more
than a coronation ceremony for
King Walter and Queen
Geraldine.
NBC had assembled a few
hundred technicians, sec
retaries, supervisors, camera
men, editors and reporters —
myself and a half dozen or so
other Stanford students and fac
ulty included — in San Fran
cisco to cover what looked to be
a non-event of the first degree.
There were brief bits of hope
for some story, any story.
A little excitement came from
Mondale's decision to replace
party chair Charles Manatt with
Bert Lancc, then his decision to
make Lance only campaign
chair and put him in charge of
finding Manatt's replacement,
and finally his decision to let
Manatt stay on after all.
Another chance for a surprise
came from the threat that
Hispanics, led by Mario Obledo
and the League of United Latin
American Citizens, would

boycott the first ballot to oppose
Democratic support of the
Simpson-Mazzoli immigration
bill and cost Mondale an easy,
first-ballot nomination.
Finally, there was the worry
that Jesse Jackson, unhappy
with the concessions he did not
get from the Mondale camp,
would lead his Rainbow Coali
tion in a walk-out of the con
vention or would attract enough
"soft" black Mondale delegates
to deny Mondale the nomina
tion.
But these stories died quickly.
Mondale had cleared up the
Lance-Manatt problem by Sun
day night, and by Monday it was
clear he would lose few votes
over the flap. The Hispanic
boycott quickly became a Hart
vs. Mondale issue, and
Mondale's delegates, who are
nothing if not loyal, said Tues
day night they wouldn't go for
hurting their candidate. And
when Jackson said Tuesday
night, "There's a time to com
pete, and a time to unite," the
delegates went wild and the
press knew it was over.
So when an NBC vice presi
dent urged the crew at an NBC
pep rally to "go out and get the
sons of bitches" — quoting
Cassie Mackin, a young NBC
correspondent who was killed in
an airplane crash — it sounded a
little hollow.
The "sons of bitches" were in
control and there was little left
to get but the rhetoric of party
unity and Mondale's "bold
move."
What, then, was the story of
the 1984 Democratic National
