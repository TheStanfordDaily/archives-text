# Convention gives media its message
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
San Francisco — "I have to
admit, I'm a little down."
That was the message last
week from an NBC News editor
to his staff, busy preparing to
cover this week's Democratic
National Convention.
Walter Mondale had just let
the few remaining summer
breezes out of journalism's sails
by announcing his vice
presidential choice four days
before the convention would
begin.
The only decent story of the
convention seemed to be gone,
leaving the Democratic Na
tional Convention little more
than a coronation ceremony for
King Walter and Queen
Geraldine.
NBC had assembled a few
hundred technicians, sec
retaries, supervisors, camera
men, editors and reporters —
myself and a half dozen or so
other Stanford students and fac
ulty included — in San Fran
cisco to cover what looked to be
a non-event of the first degree.
There were brief bits of hope
for some story, any story.
A little excitement came from
Mondale's decision to replace
party chair Charles Manatt with
Bert Lancc, then his decision to
make Lance only campaign
chair and put him in charge of
finding Manatt's replacement,
and finally his decision to let
Manatt stay on after all.
Another chance for a surprise
came from the threat that
Hispanics, led by Mario Obledo
and the League of United Latin
American Citizens, would

boycott the first ballot to oppose
Democratic support of the
Simpson-Mazzoli immigration
bill and cost Mondale an easy,
first-ballot nomination.
Finally, there was the worry
that Jesse Jackson, unhappy
with the concessions he did not
get from the Mondale camp,
would lead his Rainbow Coali
tion in a walk-out of the con
vention or would attract enough
"soft" black Mondale delegates
to deny Mondale the nomina
tion.
But these stories died quickly.
Mondale had cleared up the
Lance-Manatt problem by Sun
day night, and by Monday it was
clear he would lose few votes
over the flap. The Hispanic
boycott quickly became a Hart
vs. Mondale issue, and
Mondale's delegates, who are
nothing if not loyal, said Tues
day night they wouldn't go for
hurting their candidate. And
when Jackson said Tuesday
night, "There's a time to com
pete, and a time to unite," the
delegates went wild and the
press knew it was over.
So when an NBC vice presi
dent urged the crew at an NBC
pep rally to "go out and get the
sons of bitches" — quoting
Cassie Mackin, a young NBC
correspondent who was killed in
an airplane crash — it sounded a
little hollow.
The "sons of bitches" were in
control and there was little left
to get but the rhetoric of party
unity and Mondale's "bold
move."
What, then, was the story of
the 1984 Democratic National

Convention?
The answer is Vasy. With media out
numbering delegates by about five to
one, Marshall McLuhan's prophesy has
never been more true. The media were
the message.
The evidence wasn't tough to find.
While Walter Mondale told the
Moscone masses about his "new
realism" in his acceptance speech last
night, a group of delegates stared up at

the NBC anchor booth, trying to see
Tom Brokaw through the smoked glass.
During the roll call vote for the
presidential nomination Wednesday
night, a pair of delegates from California
came off the floor to have a friend snap
their picture with Chronicle columnist
Herb Caen.
If the media were the message of the
convention, though, the Democrats —
and the Mondale Machine especially —
were damned sure to use that message
correctly.
Things started slowly for the Mondale
machine Monday, when the bright red
Hart posters, mounted on three-foot

cardboard tubes, made the hand-held
"Mondale for America" signs funda
mentally invisible on network TV. But
Mondale forces rallied Tuesday, offering
three-foot tubes of their own. Hart
troops and Jackson workers — armed
with bright green placards — stood their
ground, though, as the bright colors
made all the difference. Finally, on Wed
nesday Mondale made a major offensive
with double- and triple-height signs
during the day, and then blue and white
pennants and beach balls during the
nomination process.
By yesterday afternoon, Mondale
forces were ready for the final television

offensive. "Mondale/Ferraro f or
America" signs awaited delegates and al
ternates in every one of their seats.
On the floor, it all looked a little con
trived. "Like it or not, this party will be
unified," the Mondale Machine seemed
to be telling the Hart and Jackson sup
porters.
But in living rooms across the country,
television sets showed the Democrats'
three musketeers finally prepared to
joust with Ronald Reagan, all for one
and one for all.
And when the media are the message,
that's the whole idea.

a non-event of the first degree.
There were brief bits of hope
for some story, any story.
A little excitement came from
Mondale's decision to replace
party chair Charles Manatt with
Bert Lancc, then his decision to
make Lance only campaign
chair and put him in charge of
finding Manatt's replacement,
and finally his decision to let
Manatt stay on after all.
Another chance for a surprise
came from the threat that
Hispanics, led by Mario Obledo
and the League of United Latin
American Citizens, would

boycott the first ballot to oppose
Democratic support of the
Simpson-Mazzoli immigration
bill and cost Mondale an easy,
first-ballot nomination.
Finally, there was the worry
that Jesse Jackson, unhappy
with the concessions he did not
get from the Mondale camp,
would lead his Rainbow Coali
tion in a walk-out of the con
vention or would attract enough
"soft" black Mondale delegates
to deny Mondale the nomina
tion.
But these stories died quickly.
Mondale had cleared up the
Lance-Manatt problem by Sun
day night, and by Monday it was
clear he would lose few votes
over the flap. The Hispanic
boycott quickly became a Hart
vs. Mondale issue, and
Mondale's delegates, who are
nothing if not loyal, said Tues
day night they wouldn't go for
hurting their candidate. And
when Jackson said Tuesday
night, "There's a time to com
pete, and a time to unite," the
delegates went wild and the
press knew it was over.
So when an NBC vice presi
dent urged the crew at an NBC
pep rally to "go out and get the
sons of bitches" — quoting
Cassie Mackin, a young NBC
correspondent who was killed in
an airplane crash — it sounded a
little hollow.
The "sons of bitches" were in
control and there was little left
to get but the rhetoric of party
unity and Mondale's "bold
move."
What, then, was the story of
the 1984 Democratic National

yesterday afternoon.
Convention?
The answer is Vasy. With media out
numbering delegates by about five to
one, Marshall McLuhan's prophesy has
never been more true. The media were
the message.
The evidence wasn't tough to find.
While Walter Mondale told the
Moscone masses about his "new
realism" in his acceptance speech last
night, a group of delegates stared up at

the NBC anchor booth, trying to see
Tom Brokaw through the smoked glass.
During the roll call vote for the
presidential nomination Wednesday
night, a pair of delegates from California
came off the floor to have a friend snap
their picture with Chronicle columnist
Herb Caen.
If the media were the message of the
convention, though, the Democrats —
and the Mondale Machine especially —
were damned sure to use that message
correctly.
Things started slowly for the Mondale
machine Monday, when the bright red
Hart posters, mounted on three-foot

cardboard tubes, made the hand-held
"Mondale for America" signs funda
mentally invisible on network TV. But
Mondale forces rallied Tuesday, offering
three-foot tubes of their own. Hart
troops and Jackson workers — armed
with bright green placards — stood their
ground, though, as the bright colors
made all the difference. Finally, on Wed
nesday Mondale made a major offensive
with double- and triple-height signs
during the day, and then blue and white
pennants and beach balls during the
nomination process.
By yesterday afternoon, Mondale
forces were ready for the final television

offensive. "Mondale/Ferraro f or
America" signs awaited delegates and al
ternates in every one of their seats.
On the floor, it all looked a little con
trived. "Like it or not, this party will be
unified," the Mondale Machine seemed
to be telling the Hart and Jackson sup
porters.
But in living rooms across the country,
television sets showed the Democrats'
three musketeers finally prepared to
joust with Ronald Reagan, all for one
and one for all.
And when the media are the message,
that's the whole idea.
