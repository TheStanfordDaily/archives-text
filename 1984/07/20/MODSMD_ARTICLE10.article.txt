## Testimony ends career 
### 
I have been a permanent part-time Stanford
employee working for accounts payable. I have
enjoyed my work and have been happy and proud
of being a Stanford employee. I was regularly
called to work overtime to meet the heavy work
demand in my section. I always received excellent
work reviews.
My husband is a Stanford graduate and we al
ways dreamed of having our two boys (16 and 13

Viewpoint

years old now) attend Stanford University.
All of our happiness and dreams suddenly
ended when I was requested to testify at a fellow
employee's grievance hearing. In spite of the ver
bal promise by grievance officer Douglas Brown
that I would not be subject to retaliation as a
result of my testimony on the employee's behalf,
my position was eliminated by my manager six
months after this testimony.
The facts which prove that the elimination of
my position was unjustified and that it was being
proposed solely for the purpose of retaliation are
as follows: Just prior to my scheduled testimony in
December 1983, my manager Nile Jones
demanded my resignation, despite my prior good
work performance record. Also within the same
week my overtime hours beyond the 50 percent
position were suddenly eliminated.
In March 1984, co-workers were given perfor

mance reviews but I was not given any review. 1
had always received regular reviews in March. In
January and February 1984, I requested that my
vacation be scheduled because of overseas plans,
and I did not receive any response.
On April 16, 1984 with no previous warning,
my manager informed me that my position was
being eliminated due to work reduction. In
reality, the reduction of two to three hours work
load was exaggerated to 20 hours by the manage
ment to justify the elimination of my position.
A recently hired employee who was still under
probation in May 1984 doing the same work I did
is still employed, while I, who had many years
seniority, was "let go".
I feel this has been a retaliation for being an
outspoken witness at a grievance where a file
clerk was unjustly terminated from our depart
ment. It is unjust and a poor reflection on Stan
ford managers. Since 1982, 11 people have quit,
been fired, or laid off; and that's from a group of
three and one-half positions. I request that the
Stanford administration look into what is going on
in the accounts payable department's auditing
section.
I am willing to take this case to arbitration with
the Union's help, and to court so that this sort of
thing won't keep happening to other employees at
accounts payable.
