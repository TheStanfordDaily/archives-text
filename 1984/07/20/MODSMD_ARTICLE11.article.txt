Islamic Society
did not give OK
In Dean Kelly's letter to the
Daily (July 13), in which he
took responsibility for selecting
Rabbi Fackenheim as this year's
baccalaureate speaker, he men
tioned that the selection in
cluded the consent of Stanford
Islamic Society on the speaker.
The society would like to make
its position on the issue clear lo
everyone.
We made it very clear when
the issue was presented at the
Stanford Associated Ministry's
meeting last fall that the form of
baccalaureate worship is not
consistent with the Islamic way
of worship and prayers and that
we definitely could not partici
pate in any form in the bacca
laureate activities. Accordingly,
we have not participated in the
selection of the speaker in any
form either by consent or con

sultation.
Meanwhile we would like to
mention that when the issue of
the baccalaureate worship was
presented, it was understood
that the speech in the ceremony
would not contain any political
issues as it was a form of wor
ship. We believe that this was
not the case this year in Facken
heim's speech.
We hope we made our posi
tion clear to everyone involved.

Where did Soviets
find information?
The World Affairs Report,
published at Stanford, is
devoted primarily to a careful
comparison of U.S. and Soviet
versions of world development.
In response to the American
campaign about the plight of
Sakharov, the Soviet
propaganda machine has un
leashed a vicious campaign
about the case of American In
dian leader Leonard Peltier,
who is imprisoned for killing
two FBI agents at Wounded
Knee. The distortions are such
that the U.S. government has
protested.
On June 15 Pravda published
a lurid article (one in a series)
about the "genocide" of the
American Indians. It begins
with General Custer and ends
with President Reagan, "who
played the role of Custer in a
Hollywood western." I went to
the Reagan archives in the
Hoover Library, where Pravda's
assertion was received with
skepticism. However, on check
ing we found that Reagan did
indeed play the part of Custer in
"The Santa Fe Trail" (Warner,
1940). I could only wish that
American newsmen were as
well-informed about the Soviet
Union as Soviet journalists are

about the United States.
But now comes the tough
question. Pravda gives as the
source of its account of the
genocide of the American Indi
ans "the history textbook of
Stanford University." Since we
try to check and document our
analyses carefully, I would be
grateful if someone would tell
me exactly which textbook used
here is referred to. I am also
curious as to how Pravda got
hold of a copy.

Policy questioned
Is it the University policy that
the instructor should not allow
students to have a concept
which is not covered in the
textbook or which is different
from what is covered in the
textbook?
