Islamic Society
did not give OK
In Dean Kelly's letter to the
Daily (July 13), in which he
took responsibility for selecting
Rabbi Fackenheim as this year's
baccalaureate speaker, he men
tioned that the selection in
cluded the consent of Stanford
Islamic Society on the speaker.
The society would like to make
its position on the issue clear lo
everyone.
We made it very clear when
the issue was presented at the
Stanford Associated Ministry's
meeting last fall that the form of
baccalaureate worship is not
consistent with the Islamic way
of worship and prayers and that
we definitely could not partici
pate in any form in the bacca
laureate activities. Accordingly,
we have not participated in the
selection of the speaker in any
form either by consent or con

sultation.
Meanwhile we would like to
mention that when the issue of
the baccalaureate worship was
presented, it was understood
that the speech in the ceremony
would not contain any political
issues as it was a form of wor
ship. We believe that this was
not the case this year in Facken
heim's speech.
We hope we made our posi
tion clear to everyone involved.
