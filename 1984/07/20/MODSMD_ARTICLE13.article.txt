San Francisco — The Demo
cratic National Convention, like
the Super Bowl, Mardi Gras, or
feeding time at the zoo, attracts
a bizarre and fascinating set of
observers and hangers-on.
One continual source of
amusement was the battle be
tween various news organiza
tions to score points in front of
their peers. The San Francisco

Reporter's notebook

Chronicle and Examiner, for ex
ample, seemed determined to
be first with the news, even at
the risk of reporting things
before they actually happened.
Undeterred by the famous ex
amples of the Chicago Tribune's
1948 "Dewey Defeats Truman"
headline, or the Chicago Sun-
Times' 1980 "It's Reagan and
Ford" goofup, both the
Chronicle and the Examiner
jumped the gun on a few news
items last week, although for
tunately for them, their at
tempts at prescience never
proved inaccurate.
Wednesday night, for exam
ple, the Chronicle distributed its
first Thursday edition by 8:30
p.m., complete with lead articles
on Sen. Gary Hart's speech and
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Brad
ley's nominating speech for
Mondale. The articles were fine,
except the paper was printed

before either speech was
delivered at the convention.
Delegates were surprised to
read that "Bradley called Wal
ter Mondale 'a person of
decency and of unyielding char
acter' last night," before Brad
ley had even approached the
podium to deliver his remarks.
Those who read the articles
closely noticed that they
referred to the prepared texts of
the speeches, which were dis
tributed early Wednesday morn
ing. While the articles were ba
sically accurate, they failed to
note that Hart altered his
prepared remarks significantly,
so the speech that was quoted in
the Chron was not quite the
same as the one Hart actually
delivered to the Democratic
throng.
The Examiner's eagerness
was even more notable. A spe
cial eight-page extra edition
with the banner headline "It's
Fritz" in two-inch high red type
was distributed seconds after
New Jersey's votes put Mondale
over the top. The edition was
obviously printed before the
former vice president had actu
ally won the nomination, and
while a subheadline said "Now
it's me versus Reagan; I'll win,"
those who read the full article
learned that those comments
were made several days earlier
"in a recent Examiner inter
view."

My biggest exclusive of the

convention was an interview
with an Italian priest who was
covering the Democrats for a
Vatican newspaper. Resplen
dent in a black velvet robe with
an emerald alligator pin, Father
Guido Sarducci (also known as
Don Novello) spoke candidly
and seemed to have an opinion
on just about everything.
The big story? "The pizza,"
he said, "it stinks."
Women in politics? "I think
Ferraro's great," said Sarducci,
"after all, she's Italian. I go for a
Cuomo-Ferraro ticket. They'd
carry New York, no problem."
Concerning the Pope's
directive barring Catholic clergy
from holding public office, Sar
ducci said, "it stinks. He should
stop supporting all those right
wing dictators in South
America, but don't print that."
Sarducci said he was having a
good time at the convention, but
he was disappointed over mis

sing Willie Brown's $400,000
party Monday night. "I couldn't
get in," he said, "10,000 people
and I couldn't get in."

Much of the talk among the
media this week concerned
whether it was a mistake to
bring the convention to San
Francisco, where the city's large
population of, well, unusual
people might reinforce the
Democrats' image as a party
controlled by special interests.
National magazines and TV
reports have paid great atten
tion to Carol Doda, Sister Boom
Boom, the city's large popula
tion of homeless people and
some of Castro Street's more
bizarre inhabitants, while ignor
ing many of the city's cultural
and recreational attractions.
The endless string of protests
this week, from Saturdays mar
ijuana march to Sunday's labor
and gay pride rallies to the

protests by the handicapped and
other groups have done little to
counter the stereotypes. Still, it
came as a surprise to more than
one delegate Wednesday night
when the official convention
band broke into a spirited rendi
tion of "YMCA," the Village
People's tongue-in-cheek salute
to gay lifestyles. Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York,
while probably unaware of the
song's lyrics, was displeased by
its pounding beat. He turned to
his companion, let out a sigh,
and said "Why can't they just
play 'Happy Days Are Here
Again?' "

Overheard in passing: One
TV reporter excitedly ap
proached another. "My evening
is complete," he said, "I just
managed to trip Claiborne
Pell." The other reporter

giggled hysterically at the
thought of the 65-year-old
senator from Rhode Island hit
ting the pavement. "Nice job,"
he said. But to others, the
crowded conditions in
Moscone's hallways were no
laughing matter. Getting
bumped and pushed was com
mon, and tempers occasionally
flared.

Politics, it seems, makes for
strange bedfellows. Take for ex
ample, the odd couple observed

walking and talking on Fourth
Street outside the Moscone
Center Wednesday night. On
one side was a burly bear of a
man, a conservative Georgia
banker who resigned from the
Carter administration in dis
grace, then caused some
negative publicity for Mondale
last weekend when he was
named chairman of the
nominee's campaign. On the
other was a lithe movie star who
is probably better known for his
liberal politics and alleged
sexual adventures than for his
screen roles. The two men chat
ting amiably were, of course,
Bert Lance and Warren Beatty.
