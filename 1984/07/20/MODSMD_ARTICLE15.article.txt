# Strauss calls for one six-year term

San Francisco — The U.S.
Constitution should be
amended to limit presidents to a
single six-year term, former
Democratic National Commit
tee Chairman Robert Strauss
said Wednesday.
Strauss, who was chairman of
then-President Jimmy Carter's
re-election campaign in 1980,
views the present primary
process as "a lot of damn
foolishness."
He also suggested several sig
nificant changes in the system
for selecting presidential candi
dates. The present system of in
dividual primaries and caucuses
in every state is too complex, he
said. Strauss said a shorter and
simpler system of regional pri
maries based on time zones is
needed.
Strauss believes the present
system does not advance the
candidacy of people for office.
He feels that in many respects
the system is very damaging to
our nation.
"Why?" asked Strauss,
"because it takes four years of
foolishness, running around the
country, doing the demeaning
things candidates have to do."
Strauss pointed out that
America is facing grave prob
lems of debt. '.'Mean, tough, un
popular political choices have to
be made," Strauss warned.
The reason that presidents
fail to tackle hard problems is
because there is not enough
time, Strauss said. "We put a
president in piace and it takes

him six to nine months to learn
his job. He has six to fifteen
months to serve. Then he starts
running for reelection."
He continued, "Everything is
based on what is good or bad
politically to get re-elected. Un
til we come to grips with this,
we're not going to solve crucial
problems.'"
The former Democratic
chairman made his comments
during a speech to the Com
monwealth Club of California at
the Sheraton Palace.
In a question-and-answer ses
sion led by Commonwealth
Club President Shirley Temple
Black, Strauss faced questions
about the budget, and the state
of the Democratic Party.
Strauss opposes a constitu
tional amendment to balance
the budget. "If this nation is not
economically sensible enough to
keep its own books, then we
better find ourselves a better
bookeeper," he said.
Strauss was asked about
former vice president Walter
Mondale's attempt to replace
Charles Manatt with Bert
Lance as chairman of the Dem
ocratic Party. He replied, "At
best it was inelegant" — to peals
of laughter.
Strauss said Mondale's selec
tion of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro
as his running mate was "a win
ner." He believes Ferraro will
get many votes and will do well
even in the South. "This theory
that she's not going to sell votes
in the south is bologna!" he
said.
