Acting on rumors of a large
and uncontrollable party in San
Francisco, Daily cartoonist
Mark Wilson headed north early
this week, "on assignment."
Disheartened upon arrival by
finding the dance floor covered
with chairs and a long line at the
cash bar, he passed the time
sketching the sights. These are
his first published sketches since
his retirement last January.
