## Center reports blood shortage, needs donors 
### LYDIA ROBINSON 
The Stanford Blood Center is
reporting a critical shortage of
blood. Normally the center has
240 units of blood in reserve,
but only 30 units are currently
available.
"In the summertime, when
regular donors and students are
away, blood reserves tend to be
short, said Dr. Edgar
Engleman, associate professor
of pathology and medicine.
Ordinarily, the Stanford
Blood Center can phone a
nearby blood bank to obtain the
needed plasma, but area centers
have been equally low.
Many factors have caused
blood banks to cut back on their
reserve levels.

A general decline in the need
for blood has occurred,
Engleman speculated, because
of a depressed economy and
hospital costs, resulting in fewer
elective surgeries.

demand, blood banks
nationwide are lowering their
reserve levels, but "ours
(Stanford Blood Center) has
never done this," Engleman

said.
However, the combination of
more surgeries at Stanford
Medical Center and a low
reserve level in other blood
banks, has forced the center to
make a widespread appeal.

"We just simply don't have
the reserves anywhere in the
area," Engleman said. "Without
some help soon, it is indeed pos
sible that a desperately ill pa

tient might have a transfusion
delayed because of area-wide
shortages,"he continued.
"Some people have the mis
taken concern that giving blood
exposes donors to acquired
immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS)," said Rhoda Burns, su
pervisor of blood donor recruit
ment," but there is absolutely no
risk of getting the infectious
disease."
Stanford Blood Center
administers a screening test for
the illness, eliminating any pos
sible infection.
The donation process takes
45 minutes. Every donor has
their blood tested and complete
medical history taken.
"I was petrified to donate the

first time. The anxiety before
giving is the worst,"Burns said
Most people have between 11-
13 pints of blood so the only ill
effect is a little fatigue, she
added.
The donation itself takes 6-8
minutes. Refreshments are
served in the canteen where
contributors rest for at "least 15
minutes, according to federal
regulations," Burns said.
The Stanford Blood Center
at 800 Welch Road in Palo
Alto, will be open Friday from
8:30 a.m.to 7:30 p.m. Although
normally closed on Saturday,
the center will be open from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. For further infor
