# Disagreement over arms, defense
## Carnoy, Zschau debate 
### LARRY BOSCHE 
The two principal contenders to represent
Stanford in the U.S. Congress next year met
head-on yesterday afternoon in the first debate
of the campaign.
Both Democratic challenger Martin Carnoy
and Republican incumbent Ed Zschau have
ties to the University. Carnoy is an economics
professor in the Education School, and Zschau
is a former Business School professor who
earned graduate degrees here.
The two men are vying for the right to repre
sent California's 12th Congressional District,
which extends from Menlo Park down to San
Jose. Both were well-received by an audience
of approximately 100 at the Hyatt Rickeys in
Palo Alto.
The main focus of the debate was the candi
dates' stance on issues generated by the audi
ence and by "The New Forum," the group
which hosted the event. Former Congressman
Pete McCloskey moderated the forum, and
asked the two candidates questions on subjects
ranging from the invasion of Grenada to tax
legislation.
The areas of major disagreement between
Carnoy and Zschau included defense spending,
arms control, and U.S. military presence in
Central America and the Caribbean.
Regarding arms control, Zschau said he sup
ports negotiations with the Russians to control
nuclear arms. Citing the stalled Geneva talks,
Zschau expressed skepticism over the power of
Congress to influence what he views as Soviet
reticence to negotiate with the U.S. He does,
however, support the ASAT negotiations pro
posed by the Russians.
Carnoy disagreed with Zschau about the

amount of power that Congress can exert in
the arms control process. "Congress has con
trol of money. Congress has an obligation to
stop the funding of the arms race," said Car
noy.
Carnoy also opposes any growth in defense
spending. "If you reduce 1 percent of defense
spending, all you will save is about $250 mil
lion,"he said sarcastically. "Economists at
Stanford believe that we can cut $50 billion
from the defense budget without endangering
arms productivity."
Zschau countered, "It's not the rate of
growth that is significant but how we are
spending the money. The president should
challenge the defense department to spend
money more wisely."
A look at Zschau's voting record on large
defense projects like the MX and the Pershing
II reveals inconsistencies. He has voted for the
Pershing II and at one point he voted for the
modernization of the MX missile. But he now
feels that nuclear arms do not strengthen U.S.
bargaining power when negotiating with the
Russians. "I guess I made a mistake," he said,
"The MX was not a good bargaining chip."
Carnoy opposes all large defense projects.
He also opposes the importation of nuclear
technology to China. "The Reagan administra
tion has been juggling our nuclear capability as
if it were so many M & M's," he said.
Concerning Latin America, Carnoy stressed
that "we should get our troops out of Hon
duras. When you have troops in an area it's a
temptation to use them."
After the debate was over, McCloskey said,
"I think either candidate would make a fine
congressman. I look for people who dodge
questions and neither of them did that."
