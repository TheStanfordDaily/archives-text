## Olympic Soccer: U.S. team has a mission 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
The United States Olympic Soccer
Team is a team with a mission.

Representing a nation that has never
taken the world's most popular game as
seriously as the rest of the world, the
team and its coach, Alkis Panagoulias,

are set to try to convert a nation that
prefers its own game of football and its
national pastime of baseball to the inter
national sport.
Panagoulias, a native of Greece who
became the coach of the national team in
January 1983, believes soccer to be es
sential to the way we are perceived
throughout the world. At a press confer
ence yesterday in Stanford Stadium, site
of nine Olympic soccer matches, includ
ing two of the American team's first
round contests, Panagoulis explained
soccer's significance to the rest of the
world.
"Who the hell cares about baseball or
football," he said. "They know about
soccer. The average person does not care
about our foreign policy or our economic
or military strength. They care about our
soccer team. You just don't understand
the rest of the world.
"When we were in China, I asked a
man if he knew who Michael Jackson
was. He said, 'Who's he?' But he knew
(U.S. midfielder) Rick Davis, because
we played Italy on TV and the Chinese
saw it. I asked a guy in New York how
we did against Italy," — the U.S. played

the world champions to a 0-0 tie May 30
at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford,
N.J. — "and he didn't know."
Panagoulis then confronted the 30 or
so reporters from all over the Bay Area
by stating, "It is the duty of the U.S.
mass media to help this game in this
country. If soccer — or football, as the
rest of the world calls it — does not
survive, the U.S. will be misunderstood
in the world. These two weeks are crucial
to 'football' in the United States."
Outspoken defender Jeff Durgan
echoed the same sentiment about the
sport's media coverage. "When we tied
Italy, the Italian papers ran front page
headlines: 'National disgrace.' The Ger
man papers ran front-page headlines.
The American papers ran it on page five
of the sports section under 'Other
Sports.'
"I'm positive we'll give you the oppor
tunity to make something out of U.S.
soccer."
Panagoulis also explained the failure
of American foreign policy in terms of
America's failure to play the world's

United States Olympic Soccer Coach Alkis Panagoulis believes that soccer is
more than just a sport, it is an instrument of foreign policy. "They know soccer/'
he said. "The average person doesn't care about our foreign policy or economic
or military strength. They care about our soccer team. You don't understand the
rest of the world."
