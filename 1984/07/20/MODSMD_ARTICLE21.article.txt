## Olympic Soccer: U.S. team has a mission 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
The United States Olympic Soccer
Team is a team with a mission.

Representing a nation that has never
taken the world's most popular game as
seriously as the rest of the world, the
team and its coach, Alkis Panagoulias,

are set to try to convert a nation that
prefers its own game of football and its
national pastime of baseball to the inter
national sport.
Panagoulias, a native of Greece who
became the coach of the national team in
January 1983, believes soccer to be es
sential to the way we are perceived
throughout the world. At a press confer
ence yesterday in Stanford Stadium, site
of nine Olympic soccer matches, includ
ing two of the American team's first
round contests, Panagoulis explained
soccer's significance to the rest of the
world.
"Who the hell cares about baseball or
football," he said. "They know about
soccer. The average person does not care
about our foreign policy or our economic
or military strength. They care about our
soccer team. You just don't understand
the rest of the world.
"When we were in China, I asked a
man if he knew who Michael Jackson
was. He said, 'Who's he?' But he knew
(U.S. midfielder) Rick Davis, because
we played Italy on TV and the Chinese
saw it. I asked a guy in New York how
we did against Italy," — the U.S. played

the world champions to a 0-0 tie May 30
at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford,
N.J. — "and he didn't know."
Panagoulis then confronted the 30 or
so reporters from all over the Bay Area
by stating, "It is the duty of the U.S.
mass media to help this game in this
country. If soccer — or football, as the
rest of the world calls it — does not
survive, the U.S. will be misunderstood
in the world. These two weeks are crucial
to 'football' in the United States."
Outspoken defender Jeff Durgan
echoed the same sentiment about the
sport's media coverage. "When we tied
Italy, the Italian papers ran front page
headlines: 'National disgrace.' The Ger
man papers ran front-page headlines.
The American papers ran it on page five
of the sports section under 'Other
Sports.'
"I'm positive we'll give you the oppor
tunity to make something out of U.S.
soccer."
Panagoulis also explained the failure
of American foreign policy in terms of
America's failure to play the world's

or military strength. They care about our soccer team. You don't understand the
rest of the world."

game. "Here we are, America, trying to
help the world. Do they thank us. No.
They don't understand us. Russia, they
send their national team to Africa and
beat these countries 16-0 — do you
know what 16-0 means in soccer? — and
impress the Africans.
"America? We send baseball teams to
Africa and the Arab countries. That's
why Russia won over the Africans."
There is a tendency to compare this
team to the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey
team. Four years ago there were people
in places where ice is only something you
put in a margarita who suddenly became
hockey fans. This time around, this team
is hoping to turn a nation of football and
baseball fans into soccer fans.
Asked if he could imagine what a gold
medal would mean to American soccer,
Panagoulis retorted, "I can imagine; can
you imagine? Hockey's known here, but
soccer is not. You can imagine the im
pact it the United States wins the gold, or
any other medal."
And this team isn't thinking con
servatively, either. Asked what his idea
of success at the Games would be,
Panagoulis turned to his team, then
replied, "Gold medal. Nothing else.
Sport is not science, sport is art. Imagina

tion and sport go hand in hand."
Durgan didn't find this unrealistic. The
22-year-old native of Tacoma, Wash.,
now a player for the North American
Soccer League's New York Cosmos,
said, "I'm a world class player. These
guys here are world-class players. I've
played against Italy, they haven't scored
against me."
Assessing his team's first round oppo
sition, Panagoulis said, "Italy won't have
their World Cup players," — World Cup
professionals are the only players in
eligible for the Olympics — "but they
will have most of their team and they are
the world champions. We do have exper
ience playing against them.
"Costa Rica is a typical South Ameri
can team, relying on individual skills, and
they'll be unpredictable because of those
skills. Egypt won the African cup, and
they're skillful, fast and enduring. This
will be their World Cup team in 1986."
Panagoulis described his team as
having "a different style, a mixture of all
styles. America is a melting pot. We have
the ideal style — the blending of all our
talents to be able to face all opponents.
"They complement each other. With
11 Peles or 11 Paolo Rossis, you have a
bad team. If you have all one kind of —
give me a football player — all lineback
ers, you have a bad team."
Just when this team is hoping to con
vert this nation into a nation of soccer
fans, the NASL, the only major outdoor

soccer league in this country, has shrunk
to just nine teams and is struggling for
survival.
Durgan realized this. "I'm a member
of a league that's going under," he said.
"There's confusion, a lack of organiza
tion. It's a disaster, and that's what
people think of when they think of the
NASL."
Defender Erhardt Kapp realizes what
the sport is up against. A player for the
Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor
Soccer League, Kapp said, "In Pitts
burgh, in the fall, there isn't any other
sport that matters beside football."
The MISL is enjoying solid growth,
while the outdoor game is struggling.

Kapp explained, "The MISL is attractive
to television. Now, the outdoor game
just doesn't cater to TV."
Durgan was not happy about that.
Asked whether the indoor game is the
future of soccer in America, he replied,
"I pray to God it's not. The international
effect would not be the same."
This is a team that has taken it upon it
self to make soccer a major sport in this
country. Kapp said, "We all feel a major
burden. I felt it when we went to China."
Durgan said, "It's above the individ
uals. We're not doing this for ourselves.
We're doing this for everyone in this
country."

United States Olympic Soccer Coach Alkis Panagoulis believes that soccer is
more than just a sport, it is an instrument of foreign policy. "They know soccer/'
he said. "The average person doesn't care about our foreign policy or economic
or military strength. They care about our soccer team. You don't understand the
rest of the world."

game. "Here we are, America, trying to
help the world. Do they thank us. No.
They don't understand us. Russia, they
send their national team to Africa and
beat these countries 16-0 — do you
know what 16-0 means in soccer? — and
impress the Africans.
"America? We send baseball teams to
Africa and the Arab countries. That's
why Russia won over the Africans."
There is a tendency to compare this
team to the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey
team. Four years ago there were people
in places where ice is only something you
put in a margarita who suddenly became
hockey fans. This time around, this team
is hoping to turn a nation of football and
baseball fans into soccer fans.
Asked if he could imagine what a gold
medal would mean to American soccer,
Panagoulis retorted, "I can imagine; can
you imagine? Hockey's known here, but
soccer is not. You can imagine the im
pact it the United States wins the gold, or
any other medal."
And this team isn't thinking con
servatively, either. Asked what his idea
of success at the Games would be,
Panagoulis turned to his team, then
replied, "Gold medal. Nothing else.
Sport is not science, sport is art. Imagina

tion and sport go hand in hand."
Durgan didn't find this unrealistic. The
22-year-old native of Tacoma, Wash.,
now a player for the North American
Soccer League's New York Cosmos,
said, "I'm a world class player. These
guys here are world-class players. I've
played against Italy, they haven't scored
against me."
Assessing his team's first round oppo
sition, Panagoulis said, "Italy won't have
their World Cup players," — World Cup
professionals are the only players in
eligible for the Olympics — "but they
will have most of their team and they are
the world champions. We do have exper
ience playing against them.
"Costa Rica is a typical South Ameri
can team, relying on individual skills, and
they'll be unpredictable because of those
skills. Egypt won the African cup, and
they're skillful, fast and enduring. This
will be their World Cup team in 1986."
Panagoulis described his team as
having "a different style, a mixture of all
styles. America is a melting pot. We have
the ideal style — the blending of all our
talents to be able to face all opponents.
"They complement each other. With
11 Peles or 11 Paolo Rossis, you have a
bad team. If you have all one kind of —
give me a football player — all lineback
ers, you have a bad team."
Just when this team is hoping to con
vert this nation into a nation of soccer
fans, the NASL, the only major outdoor

soccer league in this country, has shrunk
to just nine teams and is struggling for
survival.
Durgan realized this. "I'm a member
of a league that's going under," he said.
"There's confusion, a lack of organiza
tion. It's a disaster, and that's what
people think of when they think of the
NASL."
Defender Erhardt Kapp realizes what
the sport is up against. A player for the
Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor
Soccer League, Kapp said, "In Pitts
burgh, in the fall, there isn't any other
sport that matters beside football."
The MISL is enjoying solid growth,
while the outdoor game is struggling.

Kapp explained, "The MISL is attractive
to television. Now, the outdoor game
just doesn't cater to TV."
Durgan was not happy about that.
Asked whether the indoor game is the
future of soccer in America, he replied,
"I pray to God it's not. The international
effect would not be the same."
This is a team that has taken it upon it
self to make soccer a major sport in this
country. Kapp said, "We all feel a major
burden. I felt it when we went to China."
Durgan said, "It's above the individ
uals. We're not doing this for ourselves.
We're doing this for everyone in this
country."

Coach Alkis Panagoulis speaks at yesterday's press conference as the U.S. Olym
pic soccer team looks on. Jeff Durgan is seated second from left.
The United States Olympic Soccer
Team is a team with a mission.

Representing a nation that has never
taken the world's most popular game as
seriously as the rest of the world, the
team and its coach, Alkis Panagoulias,

are set to try to convert a nation that
prefers its own game of football and its
national pastime of baseball to the inter
national sport.
Panagoulias, a native of Greece who
became the coach of the national team in
January 1983, believes soccer to be es
sential to the way we are perceived
throughout the world. At a press confer
ence yesterday in Stanford Stadium, site
of nine Olympic soccer matches, includ
ing two of the American team's first
round contests, Panagoulis explained
soccer's significance to the rest of the
world.
"Who the hell cares about baseball or
football," he said. "They know about
soccer. The average person does not care
about our foreign policy or our economic
or military strength. They care about our
soccer team. You just don't understand
the rest of the world.
"When we were in China, I asked a
man if he knew who Michael Jackson
was. He said, 'Who's he?' But he knew
(U.S. midfielder) Rick Davis, because
we played Italy on TV and the Chinese
saw it. I asked a guy in New York how
we did against Italy," — the U.S. played

the world champions to a 0-0 tie May 30
at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford,
N.J. — "and he didn't know."
Panagoulis then confronted the 30 or
so reporters from all over the Bay Area
by stating, "It is the duty of the U.S.
mass media to help this game in this
country. If soccer — or football, as the
rest of the world calls it — does not
survive, the U.S. will be misunderstood
in the world. These two weeks are crucial
to 'football' in the United States."
Outspoken defender Jeff Durgan
echoed the same sentiment about the
sport's media coverage. "When we tied
Italy, the Italian papers ran front page
headlines: 'National disgrace.' The Ger
man papers ran front-page headlines.
The American papers ran it on page five
of the sports section under 'Other
Sports.'
"I'm positive we'll give you the oppor
tunity to make something out of U.S.
soccer."
Panagoulis also explained the failure
of American foreign policy in terms of
