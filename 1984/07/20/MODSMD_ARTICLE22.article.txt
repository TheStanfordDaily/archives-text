# Can Olympic security be totally foolproof?
## 
### 
Yesterday morning I woke up
early — a true rarity for me —
went to breakfast and bought a
copy of the San Jose Mercury
News. Right below the in
credibly predictable headline
telling of Walter Mondale's
nomination was one that was a
shock — "Massacre at
McDonald's" — and a picture
of a policeman kneeling over a

Not Just
a Came
John Lis

dead child, the boy's bicycle
lying beside him.
For those who only read The
Daily's sports pages — I thank
both of you for keeping me
employed here — Wednesday a
gunman walked into a
McDonald's restaurant in San
Ysidro — somewhere between
San Diego and Mexico — and,
as a policeman later put it,
"started shooting everyone in
sight."
A police SWAT team eventu
ally killed the man, but not

before he had killed 20 people
and injured another 17. There
was absolutely no reason that
those people — some of them
just kids riding up on their bikes
to Mickey D's like any other
kids — were killed. They had no
idea they were in the wrong
place at the wrong time until the
shooting began.
Somehow, when I read about
a Mafia slaying outside an olive
oil factory or some psycho kil
ling homosexuals or PLO
bombs exploding in an Israeli
town, it just doesn't seem that
frightening, it just doesn't seem
a threat to me. Hey, I've never
been in the Mafia, never been a
homosexual and never been to
Israel. Those things can't really
affect my life.
But I've been to McDonald's.
1 rode my bike up there when I
was a kid. And if some crazy
dude walked in with an auto
matic rifle and started blowing
people away indiscriminately
. . . it's really kind of scary.
Random violence. All you
can do is pray that you're not in
that restaurant when the man's
switch flips and the lights begin
to go out.

I remember when I was seven
years old and watching the 1972
Munich Olympics on television.
I woke up early in the morning
— TV sports has always been
the one thing to get me out of
bed and Germany is six hours
ahead of Ohio — and sat down
expecting to see Mark Spitz win
another medal or Olga Korbut
turn a few flips.
Instead I got Jim McKay tel
ling America that several Israeli
athletes had been killed and
others taken hostage by an Arab
terrorist group. It's sadly
humorous, I suppose, that I first
thought that those "Arab goril
las" had escaped from a zoo and
pulled a cartoon-type move.
My mom soon explained what
a guerrilla was, and one seven
year-old boy soon learned that
the Olympics would no more
consist merely of sporting
events.
We survived the African
boycott in 1976 in Montreal and
the U.S. boycott in 1980 in
Moscow without any terrorist
activity, but no rational person
would say that precludes any
such activity in nine days when
the 1984 Games open in Los

Angeles. And this makes me a
little uncomfortable.
Munich is thousands of miles
from home, and I didn't know
anyone on the Israeli Olympic
Team. But now Los Angeles is
only 400 miles from campus and
I do know people from Stanford
who are going to be down there.
I lived with two of them this past
year and I've talked to most of
the others. There's even a soph
omore here who's on the Israeli
gymnastics team.
Suddenly it's not a bunch of
strangers who will be participat
ing — it's people I've talked to,
eaten lunch with, beat at
Donkey Kong.
And I don't care how elabo
rate the security is, let's face it,
there are going to be holes. My
God, if some kamikaze-style at
tacker can drive a truck into a
Marine compound, is someone
going to tell me a sniper can't
pick off a bus on a traffic
snarled Los Angeles freeway?
Sure, no one is going to walk
into the Olympic Village and
start shooting, but L.A. is one
hell of a big place to try and
make secure.
Think about all the political

groups that could use the
Games to make a statement.
Armenians and Cypriots who
hate Turkey, Croats who hate
Yugoslavia, Arabs who hate Is
rael and Jews who hate Arabs,
Irish who hate the United
Kingdom, Libyans who hate
everyone. And at the end of this
list are a bunch of groups who
hate the United States.
I'm sure that the chances of a
successful terrorist act occurring
are remote. I'm sure that the se
curity arrangements will be
more than adequate. I'm sure
that the chances of an American
athlete being taken hostage are
ridiculously small.
Then I think about things like
the Harvard-Yale game, when
MIT students put a balloon un
der the field and blew it up by
remote control. What if some
one had wanted to blo\V up the
stadium instead. Could a bomb
have been that much more diffi
cult to hide?
Yeah, I lenow I'm reaching
and the chances of a terrorist at
tack happening are pretty small.
But then, so are the chances of
being in a McDonald's when a
crazy man with a rifle begins
shooting.
