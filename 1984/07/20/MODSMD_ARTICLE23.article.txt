## Seafood and the world's best clam chowder 
### 
Ida's Seafood Grotto
4210 Cabrillo Highway
Half Moon Bav
726-2822 ,
Located just a few miles north of the
heart of Half Moon Bay on Highway 1,
Ida's Seafood Grotto couples a wonder
ful view of Pillar Point Harbor with a
Boston clam chowder that brings people
back again and again. The atmosphere is
perfect for the bicyclist, beachcomber, or
whale-watcher not attired for a formal
evening, but still desiring good food,
good service and a fine view of the
Pacific.
Ida's has been providing this service at
its current location for 17 years; however
Ida founded the Grotto as a fish store 13
years before that across the street from
the Shore Bird. Although Ida died three
years ago, the restaurant has a decidedly
family-run character and her son still
does the fishing, which provides the fresh
abalone, halibut and salmon featured on

the menu. About one-third of the tables
are next to windows, and the rest have
clear views of the Pillar Point Harbor,
the surfing beach, and the Pacific. Thus,
the atmosphere is set more by the view
than by the numerous Japanese glass fish
ing floats hanging from the ceiling.
The cost is up to the customer; meals
range from $3.95 for a super bowl of
Ida's famous Boston cream clam chow
der with sourdough french bread, to
$17.95 for a fresh abalone dinner. More
typical entrees run from $6.95 for fish
and chips to $1 1.95 for the deluxe shore
platter. All entrees include french bread,
a choice of ranch fries or rice pilaf, and a
choice of salad, cole slaw, or clam chow
der.
We ordered the breaded deep sea scal
lops and one of the assorted platters. The
two platters, one called "assorted shell
fish" and the other "deluxe shore" are
virtually identical, differing only in price
and quantity. Both of us chose the clam

chowder for warmth after a cold motor
cycle ride up Highway 1. The broth was
excellent as usual and at that point we
wished we had ordered super bowls in
stead of the cups that come with the
entrees. It's not as salty as East Coast

The atmosphere is perfect
for the bicyclist or beach
comber not attired for a
formal evening.

chowder can be, but it's very creamy and
thick with clams and potato chunks. Al
though the clams are not fresh, it's ob
vious that the chowder is made at Ida's
Grotto from their own recipe. The title
ot "World's Best Clam Chowder" is
claimed by many restaurants, but you
should try Ida's before deciding which to
cast your vote for. It has a taste that is

smooth, and a satisfyingly large amount
of clams make a "super bowl" a
legitimate meal.
By the time we were served our chow
der, it was clear that Ida's friendly ser
vice had not deteriorated at all since our
last visit. It has been uniformly fast and
informed, and an attempt is always made
to make you feel at home.
The scallops had a fine buttery taste,
and a tenderness that belied their large
size. The taste was hearty enough not to
be dominated by the breading and frying.
Since one of us is a true scallop fanatic,
we feel justified in recommending these
as a shellfish choice.
The rest of the shellfish on the platter
did not live up to the expectations set by
the chowder, with the exception of the
prawn. This was excellent, but only one
came on the smaller platter. In all fair
ness, the shellfish may not be the best
