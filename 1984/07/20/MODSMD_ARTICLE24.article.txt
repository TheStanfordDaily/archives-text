Duarte's Tavern
202 Stage Road
Pescadero
879-0464
During the 19th century, Pescadero was a thriving
town with three hotels. But two fires, one at the turn of
the century and another in the 19205, destroyed most of
the city, including the original Duarte's.
The tavern was rebuilt, however, and now enjoys an
enviable reputation for fine food at reasonable prices
— 89 years after Frank Duarte first started the place
with a barrel of whiskey a friend had brought him from
Santa Cruz.
The atmosphere is informal, with unrelated parties
often asked to share large tables. The restaurant is al
ways packed, and reservations are a good idea on
weekends.
Duarte's is divided into three sections, each one very
different from the others. On the right as you enter is
the main cafe, a clean and simple area with a small
lunch counter, wood fans spinning on the ceiling and
watercolor paintings of the tavern and its surroundings
on the walls.
In the center is the tavern, a dark and rugged room
with animal trophies on the walls. Most of the bar's cus
tomers are local farmers and fishermen.
Past the bar on the left is a second dining room,
opened only two and one-half years ago. The new
dining room has a clean but somewhat plastic feel to it,
with new wood paneling on the walls but without much
of the local flavor of the other two sections. The new
room does have one distinctive decoration — a large
19th century photograph of the town as it was before
the fires changed its appearance.
According to one of the waitresses, this room was a
pool hall until recently. The conversion to dining room
was made because "the Spanish and Portuguese used to
have wild hootenannies in there." She said the rowdi
ness "made me uncomfortable, both as a woman and as
a bartender."
Duarte's is especially known for three unusual
specialties: crab cioppino, artichoke soup ($2.50) and
olalaberry pie ($1.50).
The cioppino, a tomato-based seafood stew, is so
popular that diners must make reservations specifically
for this dish if they hope to have it on a Friday or Satur
day night. While the most expensive item on the regular
menu is New York steak, at $12, the cioppino carries a
hefty $18 price tag, surpassed only by the special
abalone dinner at $20.

The artichoke soup takes advantage of the town's
agricultural specialty. A rich puree with full-bodied
flavor, artichoke soup lists for $2.50 and carries a $ 1.00
premium if ordered with dinner.
Duarte's usually also offers at least one soup of the
day. We sampled the cream of salmon soup ($1.75),
which had a rich broth and many salmon chunks. But it
also had many pieces of onion and celery, which,
though well-cooked, detracted from the rest of the
soup.
Olalaberries are another locally grown specialty. Re
sembling a tart red raspberry, they make a marvelous
pie.
Served in small but filling slices, the olalaberry pie
comes with an irregularly shaped crumbly crust that ob
viously was prepared fresh on the premises.
Now in its third generation of ownership by the
Duarte family, the restaurant has a three-acre garden
which provides fresh vegetables for salads and side
dishes.

Although the regular menu features a number of
good entrees, the best meals are usually found among
the specials posted on signs throughout the restaurant.
Some of the specials seem to always be available, but
others change frequently, depending on what kinds of
fresh seafood are locally available.
On one visit, we ordered the seabass ($8.50), baby
scallops plate ($6.50) and salmon dinner ($8.50) and
found all to be excellent.
A return trip a week later, however, found neither
seabass nor scallops listed, although the salmon was ex
cellent once again.
Another special, steamed mussels ($6.50), was both
flavorful and filling.
Almost 40 mussels were piled high on a large plate,
served with two large thin slices of garlic bread and
dishes of melted butter and broth.
The mussels varied widely in size, but all were tender
and tasty.
The serving was large enough to satisfy any appetite.
It might be a good idea to split an order of mussels.
The regular menu boasts a wide variety of simple,
hearty dishes.
Seven appetizers are listed, ranging from cold ar
tichoke hearts ($3.75) to steamed clams ($7.00). Many
entrees can be ordered either as dinners, which include
soup or salad, potatoes, vegetables and bread and but
ter, or as platters, which come with bread and butter
and a choice of either potatoes, vegetables or salad.
Platters cost $1.00 less than dinners for the same entree.
Eight regular entrees are offered, including fried
oysters ($6.50), deep-fried scallops ($8.50) and lamb
chops ($7.00).
Duarte's also serves a number of omelets, including
an artichoke variety for $6.00.
The pronunciation of the restaurant's name is a
source of controversy in some circles. A friend who has
dined there several times uses the Spanish pronuncia
tion, making it sound like it's owned by the president of
El Salvador.
A professor, however, told me that only the yuppies
in the new section pronounce it that way. He said the
real pronunciation, as favored by the salt-of-the-earth
types in the bar section, is "DOO-erts," which rhymes
with "Stewart's."
It turns out, however, that both are wrong. On my
most recent visit, the waitress told me the name is Por
tuguese, and is pronounced "Doo-ARTs, with the em
phasis on the second syllable.
