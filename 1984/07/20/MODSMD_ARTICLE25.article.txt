## 'Gabriela'-holiday with chance delights 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Jorge Amado set his novel
"Gabriela, Clove and Cin
namon" in Ilheus, a burgeoning
town in backlands Bahia. Like
Brecht and Weill's Mahagonny,
Ilheus began life as a frontier
settlement, built on gangsterism
and an expedient morality of
survival of the fittest — flavored
in this case by a feudal code of
honor. A federation of colonels
comprise the ruling class, their
power backed up by the action
of hired gunslingers, and
nowhere is their tyranny more
forcefully felt than in their
"protection" of their women.
Should a wife or mistress dare
to take a lover, swift execution
follows for both. But now, in
1925, progress — "civilization"
— has started to transform the
town; a shrewd politico
gradually usurps the authority
that formerly resided entirely in
the chief colonel, Ramiro
Bastos, by investing money in
education, roads and the
opening of Ilheus' harbor to
trade. And, correspondingly,
the sacred code of honor un
dergoes a slow metamorphosis.
Against this background,
Amado plays out a comic
romance. Nacib, the proprietor
of the local bar, replaces his
cook with a young woman,
Gabriela, a new arrival to Ilheus
— she left her home village to
escape a drought — and imme

diately falls in love with her. She
is a willing, pliable servant and a
generous sexual partner, but
when he insists on marrying her
(first obtaining false papers for
her through a notary pal) he is
no longer satisfied with her
simple rural ways: He wants a
wife he can show off in society.
And she becomes restless and
frustrated. In Amado's lengthy,
episodic novel, the Nacib-
Gabriela story is one of many
plots of more or less equal
weight (though the book is
named for it), and the conflict
between Bastos and his political
adversary, Mundinho Falcao,
overshadows it, but in the film
version by the Brazilian director
Bruno Barreto, called simply
Gabriela, Nacib and Gabriela
are the main characters, and the
town's other colorful types fade
into the background, along with
the politics. (Barreto col
laborated on the screenplay by
Leopoldo Serran.) It's probably
the right choice, in terms of
focus, though inevitably the
movement from gangland to po
litical warfare becomes blurry,
and the other subplots, left over
from the bulky, leisurely book,
reduced to isolated incidents.
Barreto has such a light touch
that when characters disappear
from the film, we barely notice
their absence until they
resurface an hour later — such a
light touch that the movie as a

whole isn't especially
memorable. It's very pleasant,
though, while you're watching
it.
At first Sonia Braga, the
bombshell who first came to the
attention of North American
audiences in Barreto's Dona
Flor and Her Two Husbands,
seems too broadly fleshy to be
an appealing Gabriela, and she
throws her body around; she has
so little physical subtlety that
you're afraid her passion will
crush Nacib — even though that
amazing, animated actor Mar
cello Mastroianni plays him. But
Braga becomes more beautiful
as the picture proceeds, and she
refines Gabriela's responses to
life with Nacib. I didn't see
Dona Flor, so I don't know if
this is the first time Braga has
shown her talents as a com
edienne, but she has a charming
scene with Mastroianni in which
she tries to understand why he
insists she listen to a poet's
lecture rather than attend a
circus, and she knows how to
make discomfort humorous —
dragged to the lecture, she sits
entombed in her flapper's garb,
staring straight ahead. And
Mastroianni is marvelous to
watch, as always. He looks a
little thicker than usual here,
with a trim black moustache and
a pale, sweaty brow; when he
walks, his feet keep folding un
der him, as if they couldn't quite

hold his weight — he has to
struggle a little to catch up with
himself. He looks permanently
plowed under — a martyr to the
Ilheus heat, to the demands of
his customers, even to the
romantic obsession that trans
forms his life. Nacib isn't one of
Mastroianni's great creations,
but he gives a vivid, funny per
formance.
Mostly because of these two, I
had a much better time at
Gabriela than I'd anticipated.

Barreto doesn't have the
assured craftsmanship of many
other directors, but he doesn't
leave much out, as you discover
when you put the (fairly compli
cated) plot together in your
head afterwards, and what con
veys itself as a laissez-faire ap
proach to the material works for
him here — you surrender your
self to the tropical climate.
Carlo Di Palma's lush photogra
phy, and the gently rolling
calypso rhythms of Antonio

Carlos Jobim's music, which
holds the film together. The
movie is unimportant, certainly,
but it's like taking a vacation,
and it has its share of incidental
delights. These include Tonia
Boscoli's impersonation of a
local beauty, the mistress of one
of the colonels, who takes a
lover but warns him that their
relationship must remain clan
destine because she has no in
tention of endangering her
luxurious lifestyle. And

Barreto has such a light touch that when
characters disappear from the film, we
barely notice their absence until they
resurface an hour later - such a light touch
that the movie as a whole isn't especially
memorable.

moviegoers who saw Hector
Babenco's remarkable Pixote in
1981 — by far the best of the
Brazilian imports — may recog
nize Fernando Ramos, who
played the title role in that film,
in the small part of Nacib's bar
boy, Tuisca. He's taller and
more self-possessed, but he has
the same far-off gaze, and his
mouth still hangs open. Consid
ering that he plays almost all his
scenes with Sonia Braga, who
could blame him for gaping?

nowhere is their tyranny more
forcefully felt than in their
"protection" of their women.
Should a wife or mistress dare
to take a lover, swift execution
follows for both. But now, in
1925, progress — "civilization"
— has started to transform the
town; a shrewd politico
gradually usurps the authority
that formerly resided entirely in
the chief colonel, Ramiro
Bastos, by investing money in
education, roads and the
opening of Ilheus' harbor to
trade. And, correspondingly,
the sacred code of honor un
dergoes a slow metamorphosis.
Against this background,
Amado plays out a comic
romance. Nacib, the proprietor
of the local bar, replaces his
cook with a young woman,
Gabriela, a new arrival to Ilheus
— she left her home village to
escape a drought — and imme

diately falls in love with her. She
is a willing, pliable servant and a
generous sexual partner, but
when he insists on marrying her
(first obtaining false papers for
her through a notary pal) he is
no longer satisfied with her
simple rural ways: He wants a
wife he can show off in society.
And she becomes restless and
frustrated. In Amado's lengthy,
episodic novel, the Nacib-
Gabriela story is one of many
plots of more or less equal
weight (though the book is
named for it), and the conflict
between Bastos and his political
adversary, Mundinho Falcao,
overshadows it, but in the film
version by the Brazilian director
Bruno Barreto, called simply
Gabriela, Nacib and Gabriela
are the main characters, and the
town's other colorful types fade
into the background, along with
the politics. (Barreto col
laborated on the screenplay by
Leopoldo Serran.) It's probably
the right choice, in terms of
focus, though inevitably the
movement from gangland to po
litical warfare becomes blurry,
and the other subplots, left over
from the bulky, leisurely book,
reduced to isolated incidents.
Barreto has such a light touch
that when characters disappear
from the film, we barely notice
their absence until they
resurface an hour later — such a
light touch that the movie as a

whole isn't especially
memorable. It's very pleasant,
though, while you're watching
it.
At first Sonia Braga, the
bombshell who first came to the
attention of North American
audiences in Barreto's Dona
Flor and Her Two Husbands,
seems too broadly fleshy to be
an appealing Gabriela, and she
throws her body around; she has
so little physical subtlety that
you're afraid her passion will
crush Nacib — even though that
amazing, animated actor Mar
cello Mastroianni plays him. But
Braga becomes more beautiful
as the picture proceeds, and she
refines Gabriela's responses to
life with Nacib. I didn't see
Dona Flor, so I don't know if
this is the first time Braga has
shown her talents as a com
edienne, but she has a charming
scene with Mastroianni in which
she tries to understand why he
insists she listen to a poet's
lecture rather than attend a
circus, and she knows how to
make discomfort humorous —
dragged to the lecture, she sits
entombed in her flapper's garb,
staring straight ahead. And
Mastroianni is marvelous to
watch, as always. He looks a
little thicker than usual here,
with a trim black moustache and
a pale, sweaty brow; when he
walks, his feet keep folding un
der him, as if they couldn't quite

hold his weight — he has to
struggle a little to catch up with
himself. He looks permanently
plowed under — a martyr to the
Ilheus heat, to the demands of
his customers, even to the
romantic obsession that trans
forms his life. Nacib isn't one of
Mastroianni's great creations,
but he gives a vivid, funny per
formance.
Mostly because of these two, I
had a much better time at
Gabriela than I'd anticipated.

Barreto doesn't have the
assured craftsmanship of many
other directors, but he doesn't
leave much out, as you discover
when you put the (fairly compli
cated) plot together in your
head afterwards, and what con
veys itself as a laissez-faire ap
proach to the material works for
him here — you surrender your
self to the tropical climate.
Carlo Di Palma's lush photogra
phy, and the gently rolling
calypso rhythms of Antonio

Carlos Jobim's music, which
holds the film together. The
movie is unimportant, certainly,
but it's like taking a vacation,
and it has its share of incidental
delights. These include Tonia
Boscoli's impersonation of a
local beauty, the mistress of one
of the colonels, who takes a
lover but warns him that their
relationship must remain clan
destine because she has no in
tention of endangering her
luxurious lifestyle. And

Barreto has such a light touch that when
characters disappear from the film, we
barely notice their absence until they
resurface an hour later - such a light touch
that the movie as a whole isn't especially
memorable.

moviegoers who saw Hector
Babenco's remarkable Pixote in
1981 — by far the best of the
Brazilian imports — may recog
nize Fernando Ramos, who
played the title role in that film,
in the small part of Nacib's bar
boy, Tuisca. He's taller and
more self-possessed, but he has
the same far-off gaze, and his
mouth still hangs open. Consid
ering that he plays almost all his
scenes with Sonia Braga, who
could blame him for gaping?
Jorge Amado set his novel
"Gabriela, Clove and Cin
namon" in Ilheus, a burgeoning
town in backlands Bahia. Like
Brecht and Weill's Mahagonny,
Ilheus began life as a frontier
settlement, built on gangsterism
and an expedient morality of
survival of the fittest — flavored
in this case by a feudal code of
honor. A federation of colonels
comprise the ruling class, their
power backed up by the action
of hired gunslingers, and
nowhere is their tyranny more
forcefully felt than in their
"protection" of their women.
Should a wife or mistress dare
to take a lover, swift execution
follows for both. But now, in
