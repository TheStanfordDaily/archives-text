The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie (1972)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Luis Bunuel whips up a
wickedly amusing comedy out of
a single joke: the characters
keep trying to eat a meal and for
some reason they never can. It's
not much of a movie, but you'll
be amazed at how graceful it is.
(Bunuel wrote it with Jean-
Claude Carriere.) With a daz
zling cast, used mostly for their
elegance and panache: Stephane
Audran, Julien Bertheau', Fer
nando Rey, Delphine Seyrig,
Jean-Pierre Cassel, Bulle Ogier,
Michel Piccoli.
Plays Thursday with That
Obscure Object of Desire.
The Buddy Holly Story
Memorial Auditorium
The continuity is drab, but
Gary Busey gives a remarkable
performance as the great rock 'n'
roller; he does his own singing
and playing, and there isn't a
fake moment in his acting. Aside
from him and the songs, there
isn't much to the movie, but it
does have the virtue of un
pretentiousness.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.

Los Olvidados (1950)
Cubberley Auditorium
Luis Bunuel's study of slum
children in Mexico City is so
fierce, graphic and unsentimen
tal that it cleanses an audience;
its power, passion and stark
beauty are roughly comparable
to Picasso's Guernica — al
though the characters are
defeated in a different kind of
war. The boys are played by Al
fonso Mejia (Pedro), Roberto
Cobo (Jaibo), Mario Ramirez
("Little Eyes") and Javier
Amezcua (as the luckless
Julian). Estela Inda gives a
forceful, complex performance
as Pedro's mother, who loves
him but denies it until too late.
In the most terrifying sequence,
Pedro dreams of his mother of
fering him freshly killed meat; in
his imagination, she turns into a
vampire. Screenplay by Bunuel
and Luis Alcoriza; Gabriel
Figueroa photographed.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Petrified Forest (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
Robert E. Sherwood's hit
play, in which a group of dis
parate people thrown together at
a restaurant in rural Arizona
represent a cross-section of
America, presaged his Idiot's
Delight, in which the characters
added up to a microcosm of the
world on the verge of World
War 11. The ironies fall like
bricks in this Archie Mayo film
version (adapted by Charles and
Delmer Daves), and the
dialogue is awfully high-toned —
the hero, the terribly romantic
fatalist Alan Squier (played by
Leslie Howard), says he is in
search of "something to believe
in — something to live for and
die for." What he finds is
Gabrielle Maple, the daughter of
the restaurant owner, who likes
to read Francois Villon; Bette
Davis is a bit old for this
moonstruck ingenue role, but
she brings vitality and genuine
emotion to it. And, in his first
important screen role,
Humphrey Bogart plays Duke
Mantee, the gangster who holds
the rest of the cast (including
Dick Foran, Genevieve Tobin,
Porter Hall and Charley
Grapewin) at bay. Howard, who
played opposite him in the stage

version, apparently insisted that
Bogart be asked to repeat his
performance, and luckily the
studio gave in: He's definitely
the best thing in the picture.
Plays through Wednesday
with Key Largo.
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often
hilarious parody of heavy metal
rock, featuring Christopher
Guest, Michael McKean and
Harry Shearer (in a walrus
moustache) as the main mem
bers of the group whose descent
from fame is chronicled by the
mock documentary. (They also
collaborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical num
bers aren't as witty as they might
be, except for an imitation
British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays today with Get Crazy.

Key Largo (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
This is often referred to as a
Bogart classic, but actually he is
upstaged by Edward G. Robin
son, playing a sadistic hood, and
by the abrasive theatrics of
Claire Trevor in the role of his
alcoholic mistress. She is so
revved up that you can feel her
just pleading for the Oscar that,
of course, she received; the
scene in which she sings
"Moanin' Low" in a woozy
tremolo in order to earn a drink
from Robinson is memorably
bad. The cast also includes
Lauren Bacall, Lionel Bar
rymore and Thomas Gomez.
John Huston directed, with so
much energy that he successfully
disguised some of the hokum in
the script that he and Richard
Brooks worked up (from a best
forgotten play by Maxwell An
derson).
Plays through Wednesday
with The Petrified Forest.
The Lion in Winter (1968)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Every family has its ups and
downs," admits Eleanor of
Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn)
after a colossal Christmas row
with her husband, King Henry II
(Peter O'Toole), who keeps her
imprisoned in a castle far from
his own the rest of the year and
only tolerates her presence —
for the sake of appearances — at
Yuletide. Medieval England has
never seemed so drab and dirty
as in this pointlessly cynical,
reductionist historical

melodrama by James Goldman
(adapting his own Broadway
play), directed by Anthony Har
vey with excessive attention to
uninteresting detail. If it weren't
for the sour tone and the taste
fully boring style of the produc
tion, Goldman's depiction of the
royal family as petty, squabbling
egotists might be amusing. Kath
arine Hepburn's power is
diminished by a slightly depress
ing sentimentality (as it has been
in almost ail of her subsequent
appearances, too), but Peter
O'Toole gives a near-great per
formance as King Henry. (He
had played a much younger, ran
dier Henry in Becket four years
earlier.) Anthony Hopkins,
Nigel Terry and Timothy Dalton
play the sibling princes.
Plays Thursday with The
Dresser.

Get Crazy (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This offbeat film is a tribute to
Bill Graham's Fillmore East in
New York, where the director,
Allan Arkush, and one of the
screenwriters, Danny Opatoshu
(the others are Henry Rosen
baum and David Taylor),
worked in the late 1960s and
early '70s. Arkush doesn't have
the talent to pull off the weird
melange of pop music parody
and revue sketch fantasy he and
the writers have cooked up; you
keep wishing that the Brian De
Palma of Phantom of the
Paradise would step in and pare
down the cramped, overkill
crowd scenes, shape the satirical
numbers, record them properly,
and show Arkush where to place
his camera. But while you are
reshooting the damn thing in
your head, the most amazing
people show up — Allen Goor
witz, Daniel Stern, Ed Begley,
Jr., Franklyn Ajaye, Mary
Woronov, Paul Bartel, Lou
Reed, Howard Kaylan, Fabian
Forte, Bobby Sherman, Lee
Ving, Bill Henderson, Lori
Eastside, and, parodying Mick
Jagger, Malcolm McDowell.
Plays today with This Is Spinal
Tap.
That Obscure Object of
Desire (1977)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Luis Bunuel's last movie,
derived from Pierre Louys'

novel The Woman and the Pup
pet (Bunuel and Jean-Claude
Carriere wrote the script), con
cerns a middle-aged man the ob
ject of whose desire tempts and
taunts him with unfulfilled
promises of sexual delight. Per
petually delayed sex is supposed
to function in this movie like
perpetually delayed food did in
The Discreet Charm ofthe Bour
geoisie: to satirize the depen
dency of those who are denied it.
As an example of technique, this
film displays dazzling sleight of
hand, but Bunuel gives so little
away — like why he cast two wo
men (Carole Bouquet and An
gela Molina) in the central
female role — that we end up
more frustrated than the hero
(Fernando Rey).
Plays Thursday with The Dis
creet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.

Chariots of Fire (1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Many people find this drama
about a pair of English runners
in the 1924 Paris Olympics in
spirational — taking their cue,
no doubt, from Colin Welland's
achingly preachy script and the
cautiously arranged period detail
with which the director, Hugh
Hudson, has loaded everything
down. The heroes are Eric Lid
dell (lan Charleson), who runs
for the glory of God, and Harold
Abrahams (Ben Cross), who
runs to prove that Jews are just
as good as Christians; the movie
seems to be saying that you can
be a champion if your cause is
pure enough. The film works
best when it shuts its big mouth
and we watch the athletes'
preparations and the Olympic
events (though the sports scenes
in Personal Best are much better
shot). As Abrahams' sweetheart,
actress Sybil Gordon, Alice
Krige wears amazing showpiece
gowns and gives a delightfully
preposterous performance. With
an immense, expensive cast that
includes John Gielgud, lan
Holm, Patrick Magee, Lindsay
Anderson, Dennis Christopher,
Nigel Davenport and Brad
Davis.
Plays Monday.
Streets of Fire (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Walter Hill stylizes urban
paranoia by converting a city
drama about street gangs and a
heroic ghetto bad boy who fights
for the woman he loves into pure
pop mythology, incorporating all
three classic American genres:
the western, the gangster picture
and the musical. His "rock and

roll fable" is superbly crafted, (it
has one of the best credits se
quences ever filmed) but the
songs have to be electrifying for
the film to work, and they aren't.
Diane Lane, who plays the rock
singer abducted by the evil
motorcycle gang chief (Willem
Dafoe), is synthetic-sexy — a
queen of lipstick rock, like Pat
Benatar or Bonnie Tyler. This
companion piece to Hill's mar
velous 1979 The Warriors is the
work of a master technician and
a born entertainer, but it lacks
purpose (and it seems to end
prematurely). With Michael
Pare, Amy Madigan, Rick
Moranis and Deborah Van
Valkenburgh; shot by Andrew
Laszlo.
Plays Wednesday with Blade
Runner.
Manhattan (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In a Chaplinesque display of
ego, Woody Allen makes the
schlemiel hero he's made us
identify as himself pitifully tor
mented: he is trying so hard to
be true to himself and fair to his
lovers, but they keep victimizing
him. His character, Isaac Davis,
is involved with three women.
His wife Jill (Meryl Streep)
throws him over for another wo
man, writes a book exposing the
dark underside of their mar
riage, and retains custody of
their little boy, who is glimpsed
in montages with Isaac that sig
nal us that he is the most loving

of fathers. Mary (Diane Keaton)
returns to her old boyfriend,
Isaac's best friend, Yale
(Michael Murphy). Tracy
(Mariel Hemingway) commits
the unpardonable crime of being
too young — she is 17, and in
this movie's cockeyed terms, the
indiscretion is all on her side.
Ironically, the redeeming grace
of this infuriating movie is the
performances of the three
actresses cast in these roles.
Gordon Willis did the striking
black and white photography;
the music is by George
Gershwin.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Moscow on the Hudson.
Moscow on the Hudson
(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Or You Can't Go Home
Again. Robin Williams gives a
brilliant performance as a saxo
phonist with a Moscow circus
playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to
defect. On one level Paul
Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos)
deals with the movement from
repression to freedom, what
freedom implies and what its
constraints and contradictions
are; on another level it's a com
edy about the seductive appeal
of American decadence for Rus
sians (like Ninotchka was); cen
trally, though, it's about what
happens to a man who makes the
choice to cut himself off from
home and family forever. When
Mazursky's in high gear, few
directors can touch him: The
whole cast (Cleavant Derricks,
Maria Conchita Alonso, Tiger
Haynes, Savely Kramarov, Elya
Baskin, Alexander Beniaminov)
is marvelous, and sometimes
Mazursky engages so many emo
tional tracks simultaneously that
you can't analyze exactly which
element is affecting you most
profoundly.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Every family has its ups and
downs," admits Eleanor of
Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn)
after a colossal Christmas row
with her husband, King Henry II
(Peter O'Toole), who keeps her
imprisoned in a castle far from
his own the rest of the year and
only tolerates her presence —
for the sake of appearances — at
Yuletide. Medieval England has
never seemed so drab and dirty
as in this pointlessly cynical,
reductionist historical

melodrama by James Goldman
(adapting his own Broadway
play), directed by Anthony Har
vey with excessive attention to
uninteresting detail. If it weren't
for the sour tone and the taste
fully boring style of the produc
tion, Goldman's depiction of the
royal family as petty, squabbling
egotists might be amusing. Kath
arine Hepburn's power is
diminished by a slightly depress
ing sentimentality (as it has been
in almost ail of her subsequent
appearances, too), but Peter
O'Toole gives a near-great per
formance as King Henry. (He
had played a much younger, ran
dier Henry in Becket four years
earlier.) Anthony Hopkins,
Nigel Terry and Timothy Dalton
play the sibling princes.
Plays Thursday with The
Dresser.

Get Crazy (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This offbeat film is a tribute to
Bill Graham's Fillmore East in
New York, where the director,
Allan Arkush, and one of the
screenwriters, Danny Opatoshu
(the others are Henry Rosen
baum and David Taylor),
worked in the late 1960s and
early '70s. Arkush doesn't have
the talent to pull off the weird
melange of pop music parody
and revue sketch fantasy he and
the writers have cooked up; you
keep wishing that the Brian De
Palma of Phantom of the
Paradise would step in and pare
down the cramped, overkill
crowd scenes, shape the satirical
numbers, record them properly,
and show Arkush where to place
his camera. But while you are
reshooting the damn thing in
your head, the most amazing
people show up — Allen Goor
witz, Daniel Stern, Ed Begley,
Jr., Franklyn Ajaye, Mary
Woronov, Paul Bartel, Lou
Reed, Howard Kaylan, Fabian
Forte, Bobby Sherman, Lee
Ving, Bill Henderson, Lori
Eastside, and, parodying Mick
Jagger, Malcolm McDowell.
Plays today with This Is Spinal
Tap.
That Obscure Object of
Desire (1977)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Luis Bunuel's last movie,
derived from Pierre Louys'

novel The Woman and the Pup
pet (Bunuel and Jean-Claude
Carriere wrote the script), con
cerns a middle-aged man the ob
ject of whose desire tempts and
taunts him with unfulfilled
promises of sexual delight. Per
petually delayed sex is supposed
to function in this movie like
perpetually delayed food did in
The Discreet Charm ofthe Bour
geoisie: to satirize the depen
dency of those who are denied it.
As an example of technique, this
film displays dazzling sleight of
hand, but Bunuel gives so little
away — like why he cast two wo
men (Carole Bouquet and An
gela Molina) in the central
female role — that we end up
more frustrated than the hero
(Fernando Rey).
Plays Thursday with The Dis
creet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.

Chariots of Fire (1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Many people find this drama
about a pair of English runners
in the 1924 Paris Olympics in
spirational — taking their cue,
no doubt, from Colin Welland's
achingly preachy script and the
cautiously arranged period detail
with which the director, Hugh
Hudson, has loaded everything
down. The heroes are Eric Lid
dell (lan Charleson), who runs
for the glory of God, and Harold
Abrahams (Ben Cross), who
runs to prove that Jews are just
as good as Christians; the movie
seems to be saying that you can
be a champion if your cause is
pure enough. The film works
best when it shuts its big mouth
and we watch the athletes'
preparations and the Olympic
events (though the sports scenes
in Personal Best are much better
shot). As Abrahams' sweetheart,
actress Sybil Gordon, Alice
Krige wears amazing showpiece
gowns and gives a delightfully
preposterous performance. With
an immense, expensive cast that
includes John Gielgud, lan
Holm, Patrick Magee, Lindsay
Anderson, Dennis Christopher,
Nigel Davenport and Brad
Davis.
Plays Monday.
Streets of Fire (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Walter Hill stylizes urban
paranoia by converting a city
drama about street gangs and a
heroic ghetto bad boy who fights
for the woman he loves into pure
pop mythology, incorporating all
three classic American genres:
the western, the gangster picture
and the musical. His "rock and

roll fable" is superbly crafted, (it
has one of the best credits se
quences ever filmed) but the
songs have to be electrifying for
the film to work, and they aren't.
Diane Lane, who plays the rock
singer abducted by the evil
motorcycle gang chief (Willem
Dafoe), is synthetic-sexy — a
queen of lipstick rock, like Pat
Benatar or Bonnie Tyler. This
companion piece to Hill's mar
velous 1979 The Warriors is the
work of a master technician and
a born entertainer, but it lacks
purpose (and it seems to end
prematurely). With Michael
Pare, Amy Madigan, Rick
Moranis and Deborah Van
Valkenburgh; shot by Andrew
Laszlo.
Plays Wednesday with Blade
Runner.
Manhattan (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In a Chaplinesque display of
ego, Woody Allen makes the
schlemiel hero he's made us
identify as himself pitifully tor
mented: he is trying so hard to
be true to himself and fair to his
lovers, but they keep victimizing
him. His character, Isaac Davis,
is involved with three women.
His wife Jill (Meryl Streep)
throws him over for another wo
man, writes a book exposing the
dark underside of their mar
riage, and retains custody of
their little boy, who is glimpsed
in montages with Isaac that sig
nal us that he is the most loving

of fathers. Mary (Diane Keaton)
returns to her old boyfriend,
Isaac's best friend, Yale
(Michael Murphy). Tracy
(Mariel Hemingway) commits
the unpardonable crime of being
too young — she is 17, and in
this movie's cockeyed terms, the
indiscretion is all on her side.
Ironically, the redeeming grace
of this infuriating movie is the
performances of the three
actresses cast in these roles.
Gordon Willis did the striking
black and white photography;
the music is by George
Gershwin.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Moscow on the Hudson.
Moscow on the Hudson
(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Or You Can't Go Home
Again. Robin Williams gives a
brilliant performance as a saxo
phonist with a Moscow circus
playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to
defect. On one level Paul
Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos)
deals with the movement from
repression to freedom, what
freedom implies and what its
constraints and contradictions
are; on another level it's a com
edy about the seductive appeal
of American decadence for Rus
sians (like Ninotchka was); cen
trally, though, it's about what
happens to a man who makes the
choice to cut himself off from
home and family forever. When
Mazursky's in high gear, few
directors can touch him: The
whole cast (Cleavant Derricks,
Maria Conchita Alonso, Tiger
Haynes, Savely Kramarov, Elya
Baskin, Alexander Beniaminov)
is marvelous, and sometimes
Mazursky engages so many emo
tional tracks simultaneously that
you can't analyze exactly which
element is affecting you most
profoundly.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Manhattan.

The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie (1972)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Luis Bunuel whips up a
wickedly amusing comedy out of
a single joke: the characters
keep trying to eat a meal and for
some reason they never can. It's
not much of a movie, but you'll
be amazed at how graceful it is.
(Bunuel wrote it with Jean-
Claude Carriere.) With a daz
zling cast, used mostly for their
elegance and panache: Stephane
Audran, Julien Bertheau', Fer
nando Rey, Delphine Seyrig,
Jean-Pierre Cassel, Bulle Ogier,
Michel Piccoli.
Plays Thursday with That
Obscure Object of Desire.
The Buddy Holly Story
Memorial Auditorium
The continuity is drab, but
Gary Busey gives a remarkable
performance as the great rock 'n'
roller; he does his own singing
and playing, and there isn't a
fake moment in his acting. Aside
from him and the songs, there
isn't much to the movie, but it
does have the virtue of un
pretentiousness.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.

Los Olvidados (1950)
Cubberley Auditorium
Luis Bunuel's study of slum
children in Mexico City is so
fierce, graphic and unsentimen
tal that it cleanses an audience;
its power, passion and stark
beauty are roughly comparable
to Picasso's Guernica — al
though the characters are
defeated in a different kind of
war. The boys are played by Al
fonso Mejia (Pedro), Roberto
Cobo (Jaibo), Mario Ramirez
("Little Eyes") and Javier
Amezcua (as the luckless
Julian). Estela Inda gives a
forceful, complex performance
as Pedro's mother, who loves
him but denies it until too late.
In the most terrifying sequence,
Pedro dreams of his mother of
fering him freshly killed meat; in
his imagination, she turns into a
vampire. Screenplay by Bunuel
and Luis Alcoriza; Gabriel
Figueroa photographed.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Petrified Forest (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
Robert E. Sherwood's hit
play, in which a group of dis
parate people thrown together at
a restaurant in rural Arizona
represent a cross-section of
America, presaged his Idiot's
Delight, in which the characters
added up to a microcosm of the
world on the verge of World
War 11. The ironies fall like
bricks in this Archie Mayo film
version (adapted by Charles and
Delmer Daves), and the
dialogue is awfully high-toned —
the hero, the terribly romantic
fatalist Alan Squier (played by
Leslie Howard), says he is in
search of "something to believe
in — something to live for and
die for." What he finds is
Gabrielle Maple, the daughter of
the restaurant owner, who likes
to read Francois Villon; Bette
Davis is a bit old for this
moonstruck ingenue role, but
she brings vitality and genuine
emotion to it. And, in his first
important screen role,
Humphrey Bogart plays Duke
Mantee, the gangster who holds
the rest of the cast (including
Dick Foran, Genevieve Tobin,
Porter Hall and Charley
Grapewin) at bay. Howard, who
played opposite him in the stage

version, apparently insisted that
Bogart be asked to repeat his
performance, and luckily the
studio gave in: He's definitely
the best thing in the picture.
Plays through Wednesday

This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often
hilarious parody of heavy metal
rock, featuring Christopher
Guest, Michael McKean and
Harry Shearer (in a walrus
moustache) as the main mem
bers of the group whose descent
from fame is chronicled by the
mock documentary. (They also
collaborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical num
bers aren't as witty as they might
be, except for an imitation
British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays today with Get Crazy.

Key Largo (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
This is often referred to as a
Bogart classic, but actually he is
upstaged by Edward G. Robin
son, playing a sadistic hood, and
by the abrasive theatrics of
Claire Trevor in the role of his
alcoholic mistress. She is so
revved up that you can feel her
just pleading for the Oscar that,
of course, she received; the
scene in which she sings
"Moanin' Low" in a woozy
tremolo in order to earn a drink
from Robinson is memorably
bad. The cast also includes
Lauren Bacall, Lionel Bar
rymore and Thomas Gomez.
John Huston directed, with so
much energy that he successfully
disguised some of the hokum in
the script that he and Richard
Brooks worked up (from a best
forgotten play by Maxwell An
derson).

quences ever filmed) but the
songs have to be electrifying for
the film to work, and they aren't.
Diane Lane, who plays the rock
singer abducted by the evil
motorcycle gang chief (Willem
Dafoe), is synthetic-sexy — a
queen of lipstick rock, like Pat
Benatar or Bonnie Tyler. This
companion piece to Hill's mar
velous 1979 The Warriors is the
work of a master technician and
a born entertainer, but it lacks
purpose (and it seems to end
prematurely). With Michael
Pare, Amy Madigan, Rick
Moranis and Deborah Van
Valkenburgh; shot by Andrew
Laszlo.
Plays Wednesday with Blade
Runner.
Manhattan (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In a Chaplinesque display of
ego, Woody Allen makes the
schlemiel hero he's made us
identify as himself pitifully tor
mented: he is trying so hard to
be true to himself and fair to his
lovers, but they keep victimizing
him. His character, Isaac Davis,
is involved with three women.
His wife Jill (Meryl Streep)
throws him over for another wo
man, writes a book exposing the
dark underside of their mar
riage, and retains custody of
their little boy, who is glimpsed
in montages with Isaac that sig
nal us that he is the most loving

of fathers. Mary (Diane Keaton)
returns to her old boyfriend,
Isaac's best friend, Yale
(Michael Murphy). Tracy
(Mariel Hemingway) commits
the unpardonable crime of being
too young — she is 17, and in
this movie's cockeyed terms, the
indiscretion is all on her side.
Ironically, the redeeming grace
of this infuriating movie is the
performances of the three
actresses cast in these roles.
Gordon Willis did the striking
black and white photography;
the music is by George
Gershwin.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Moscow on the Hudson.
Moscow on the Hudson
(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Or You Can't Go Home
Again. Robin Williams gives a
brilliant performance as a saxo
phonist with a Moscow circus
playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to
defect. On one level Paul
Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos)
deals with the movement from
repression to freedom, what
freedom implies and what its
constraints and contradictions
are; on another level it's a com
edy about the seductive appeal
of American decadence for Rus
sians (like Ninotchka was); cen
trally, though, it's about what
happens to a man who makes the
choice to cut himself off from
home and family forever. When
Mazursky's in high gear, few
directors can touch him: The
whole cast (Cleavant Derricks,
Maria Conchita Alonso, Tiger
Haynes, Savely Kramarov, Elya
Baskin, Alexander Beniaminov)
is marvelous, and sometimes
Mazursky engages so many emo
tional tracks simultaneously that
you can't analyze exactly which
element is affecting you most
profoundly.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Manhattan.

The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie (1972)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Luis Bunuel whips up a
wickedly amusing comedy out of
a single joke: the characters
keep trying to eat a meal and for
some reason they never can. It's
not much of a movie, but you'll
be amazed at how graceful it is.
(Bunuel wrote it with Jean-
Claude Carriere.) With a daz
zling cast, used mostly for their
elegance and panache: Stephane
Audran, Julien Bertheau', Fer
nando Rey, Delphine Seyrig,
Jean-Pierre Cassel, Bulle Ogier,
Michel Piccoli.
Plays Thursday with That
Obscure Object of Desire.
The Buddy Holly Story
Memorial Auditorium
The continuity is drab, but
Gary Busey gives a remarkable
performance as the great rock 'n'
roller; he does his own singing
and playing, and there isn't a
fake moment in his acting. Aside
from him and the songs, there
isn't much to the movie, but it
does have the virtue of un
pretentiousness.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.

Los Olvidados (1950)
Cubberley Auditorium
Luis Bunuel's study of slum
children in Mexico City is so
fierce, graphic and unsentimen
tal that it cleanses an audience;
its power, passion and stark
beauty are roughly comparable
to Picasso's Guernica — al
though the characters are
defeated in a different kind of
war. The boys are played by Al
fonso Mejia (Pedro), Roberto
Cobo (Jaibo), Mario Ramirez
("Little Eyes") and Javier
Amezcua (as the luckless
Julian). Estela Inda gives a
forceful, complex performance
as Pedro's mother, who loves
him but denies it until too late.
In the most terrifying sequence,
Pedro dreams of his mother of
fering him freshly killed meat; in
his imagination, she turns into a
vampire. Screenplay by Bunuel
and Luis Alcoriza; Gabriel
Figueroa photographed.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Petrified Forest (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
Robert E. Sherwood's hit
play, in which a group of dis
parate people thrown together at
a restaurant in rural Arizona
represent a cross-section of
America, presaged his Idiot's
Delight, in which the characters
added up to a microcosm of the
world on the verge of World
War 11. The ironies fall like
bricks in this Archie Mayo film
version (adapted by Charles and
Delmer Daves), and the
dialogue is awfully high-toned —
the hero, the terribly romantic
fatalist Alan Squier (played by
Leslie Howard), says he is in
search of "something to believe
in — something to live for and
die for." What he finds is
Gabrielle Maple, the daughter of
the restaurant owner, who likes
to read Francois Villon; Bette
Davis is a bit old for this
moonstruck ingenue role, but
she brings vitality and genuine
emotion to it. And, in his first
important screen role,
Humphrey Bogart plays Duke
Mantee, the gangster who holds
the rest of the cast (including
Dick Foran, Genevieve Tobin,
Porter Hall and Charley
Grapewin) at bay. Howard, who
played opposite him in the stage

version, apparently insisted that
Bogart be asked to repeat his
performance, and luckily the
studio gave in: He's definitely
the best thing in the picture.
Plays through Wednesday
with Key Largo.
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often
hilarious parody of heavy metal
rock, featuring Christopher
Guest, Michael McKean and
Harry Shearer (in a walrus
moustache) as the main mem
bers of the group whose descent
from fame is chronicled by the
mock documentary. (They also
collaborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical num
bers aren't as witty as they might
be, except for an imitation
British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays today with Get Crazy.

Key Largo (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
This is often referred to as a
Bogart classic, but actually he is
upstaged by Edward G. Robin
son, playing a sadistic hood, and
by the abrasive theatrics of
Claire Trevor in the role of his
alcoholic mistress. She is so
revved up that you can feel her
just pleading for the Oscar that,
of course, she received; the
scene in which she sings
"Moanin' Low" in a woozy
tremolo in order to earn a drink
from Robinson is memorably
bad. The cast also includes
Lauren Bacall, Lionel Bar
rymore and Thomas Gomez.
John Huston directed, with so
much energy that he successfully
disguised some of the hokum in
the script that he and Richard
Brooks worked up (from a best
forgotten play by Maxwell An
derson).
Plays through Wednesday
with The Petrified Forest.
The Lion in Winter (1968)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Every family has its ups and
downs," admits Eleanor of
Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn)
after a colossal Christmas row
with her husband, King Henry II
(Peter O'Toole), who keeps her
imprisoned in a castle far from
his own the rest of the year and
only tolerates her presence —
for the sake of appearances — at
Yuletide. Medieval England has
never seemed so drab and dirty
as in this pointlessly cynical,
reductionist historical

melodrama by James Goldman
(adapting his own Broadway
play), directed by Anthony Har
vey with excessive attention to
uninteresting detail. If it weren't
for the sour tone and the taste
fully boring style of the produc
tion, Goldman's depiction of the
royal family as petty, squabbling
egotists might be amusing. Kath
arine Hepburn's power is
diminished by a slightly depress
ing sentimentality (as it has been
in almost ail of her subsequent
appearances, too), but Peter
O'Toole gives a near-great per
formance as King Henry. (He
had played a much younger, ran
dier Henry in Becket four years
earlier.) Anthony Hopkins,
Nigel Terry and Timothy Dalton
play the sibling princes.
Plays Thursday with The
Dresser.

Get Crazy (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This offbeat film is a tribute to
Bill Graham's Fillmore East in
New York, where the director,
Allan Arkush, and one of the
screenwriters, Danny Opatoshu
(the others are Henry Rosen
baum and David Taylor),
worked in the late 1960s and
early '70s. Arkush doesn't have
the talent to pull off the weird
melange of pop music parody
and revue sketch fantasy he and
the writers have cooked up; you
keep wishing that the Brian De
Palma of Phantom of the
Paradise would step in and pare
down the cramped, overkill
crowd scenes, shape the satirical
numbers, record them properly,
and show Arkush where to place
his camera. But while you are
reshooting the damn thing in
your head, the most amazing
people show up — Allen Goor
witz, Daniel Stern, Ed Begley,
Jr., Franklyn Ajaye, Mary
Woronov, Paul Bartel, Lou
Reed, Howard Kaylan, Fabian
Forte, Bobby Sherman, Lee
Ving, Bill Henderson, Lori
Eastside, and, parodying Mick
Jagger, Malcolm McDowell.
Plays today with This Is Spinal

That Obscure Object of
Desire (1977)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Luis Bunuel's last movie,
derived from Pierre Louys'

novel The Woman and the Pup
pet (Bunuel and Jean-Claude
Carriere wrote the script), con
cerns a middle-aged man the ob
ject of whose desire tempts and
taunts him with unfulfilled
promises of sexual delight. Per
petually delayed sex is supposed
to function in this movie like
perpetually delayed food did in
The Discreet Charm ofthe Bour
geoisie: to satirize the depen
dency of those who are denied it.
As an example of technique, this
film displays dazzling sleight of
hand, but Bunuel gives so little
away — like why he cast two wo
men (Carole Bouquet and An
gela Molina) in the central
female role — that we end up
more frustrated than the hero
(Fernando Rey).
Plays Thursday with The Dis
creet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.

Chariots of Fire (1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Many people find this drama
about a pair of English runners
in the 1924 Paris Olympics in
spirational — taking their cue,
no doubt, from Colin Welland's
achingly preachy script and the
cautiously arranged period detail
with which the director, Hugh
Hudson, has loaded everything
down. The heroes are Eric Lid
dell (lan Charleson), who runs
for the glory of God, and Harold
Abrahams (Ben Cross), who
runs to prove that Jews are just
as good as Christians; the movie
seems to be saying that you can
be a champion if your cause is
pure enough. The film works
best when it shuts its big mouth
and we watch the athletes'
preparations and the Olympic
events (though the sports scenes
in Personal Best are much better
shot). As Abrahams' sweetheart,
actress Sybil Gordon, Alice
Krige wears amazing showpiece
gowns and gives a delightfully
preposterous performance. With
an immense, expensive cast that
includes John Gielgud, lan
Holm, Patrick Magee, Lindsay
Anderson, Dennis Christopher,
Nigel Davenport and Brad
Davis.
Plays Monday.
Streets of Fire (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Walter Hill stylizes urban
paranoia by converting a city
drama about street gangs and a
heroic ghetto bad boy who fights
for the woman he loves into pure
pop mythology, incorporating all
three classic American genres:
the western, the gangster picture
and the musical. His "rock and

roll fable" is superbly crafted, (it
has one of the best credits se
quences ever filmed) but the
songs have to be electrifying for
the film to work, and they aren't.
Diane Lane, who plays the rock
