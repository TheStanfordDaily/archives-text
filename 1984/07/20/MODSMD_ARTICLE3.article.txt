# Mondale urged to take risks

San Francisco â€” Democratic Party activists at
the national convention seemed less than
enthralled by Walter Mondale's charisma or lack
thereof, but were cautiously optimistic that the
former vice president can gain enough support to
defeat President Reagan in November.

Analysis

While some believe Mondale must muderate
his policy positions in order to capture support
from the political center, the more popular view at
the convention was that the former vice president
must take bold progressive stands which will
create excitement and stimulate increased voter
participation among women, minorities and the
poor.
By taking more risks, Mondale can counter his
image as a bland and indecisive candidate and

reverse a longstanding trend toward decreased
voter turnouts, they said.
Barry Commoner, who was the Citizens' Party's
1980 presidential candidate, now advises Rev.
Jesse Jackson. Commoner believes Jackson's stir
ring speech at the convention outlined a strategy
Mondale can use to win the presidency.
"Jesse's program is now the conscience of the
Democratic Party," Commoner said. "My sense is
that the delegates are to the left of Mondale. They
know we're not going to beat Reagan unless we
move in the direction Jackson described and send
a signal that this is still the party of peace and so
cial justice."
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley didn't share
Commoner's view that Mondale must move to the
left, but he agreed that the Democratic nominee
must take risks if he is to defeat Reagan in No
