# Mondale urged to take risks

### SAM DELSON 
San Francisco — Democratic Party activists at
the national convention seemed less than
enthralled by Walter Mondale's charisma or lack
thereof, but were cautiously optimistic that the
former vice president can gain enough support to
defeat President Reagan in November.

Analysis

While some believe Mondale must muderate
his policy positions in order to capture support
from the political center, the more popular view at
the convention was that the former vice president
must take bold progressive stands which will
create excitement and stimulate increased voter
participation among women, minorities and the
poor.
By taking more risks, Mondale can counter his
image as a bland and indecisive candidate and

reverse a longstanding trend toward decreased
voter turnouts, they said.
Barry Commoner, who was the Citizens' Party's
1980 presidential candidate, now advises Rev.
Jesse Jackson. Commoner believes Jackson's stir
ring speech at the convention outlined a strategy
Mondale can use to win the presidency.
"Jesse's program is now the conscience of the
Democratic Party," Commoner said. "My sense is
that the delegates are to the left of Mondale. They
know we're not going to beat Reagan unless we
move in the direction Jackson described and send
a signal that this is still the party of peace and so
cial justice."
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley didn't share
Commoner's view that Mondale must move to the
left, but he agreed that the Democratic nominee
must take risks if he is to defeat Reagan in No
vember. "His selection of Geraldine Ferraro indicated
that he has the courage to try new things," said Brad
ley. "She brings a special element of excitement and I
believe she'll energize the party."
Paul Wellstone, a member of the Democratic Na
tional Committee from Minnesota, drew a parallel to
the 1968 election in order to illustrate the need for
Mondale to take more controversial stands.
Wellstone noted that Mondale's mentor, Hubert
Humphrey, began the 68 campaign trailing Richard
Nixon in the polls by a significant margin. "Millions of
people felt Humphrey was better than Nixon, but as
long as he ran a cautious campaign, they found it diffi
cult to enthusiastically support him, and many didn't
bother to vote. As soon as Humphrey broke with
Johnson on the war, he made a spectacular rise in the
polls. If he'd done it a week or two earlier, he would

have won the election," Wellstone said.
"I talked to Mondale last week, and I told him he has
to take risks early or he'll make the same mistake
Humphrey did," Wellstone said.
More support for the same strategy came from David
Orr, a Chicago alderman who is allied with Mayor
Harold Washington.
Orr noted that Reagan's 1980 margin of victory in
many states was significantly smaller than the number
of unregistered black voters.
"If he can register enough new voters, it can make
the difference in states like North Carolina where
Reagan won by 38,000 votes and more than 500,000
blacks weren't registered," Orr said.
Although many delegates seemed resigned to seeing
Mondale go down to defeat this fall, there were pockets
of enthusiasm for the former vice president on the con
vention floor. Nowhere was there more excitement
about the nominee than among the delegates from
Mondale's home state of Minnesota.

When New Jersey's 115 votes clinched Mondale's
nomination, the Minnesota delegates erupted in a
spontaneous display of euphoria.
The most enthusiastic celebrant of all was Hubert H
"Skip" Humphrey 111, a small and amiable fellow who
is the attorney general of Minnesota — the same posi
tion which launched Mondale's political career.
When a television reporter asked him if the conven
tion was fun, Humphrey's response was swift and un
equivocal.
"You're darn tootin' it is," he replied.
"Maybe it was a little better when Dad got it in '68,"
Humphrey said. "But this is just marvelous."
Among the Minnesota delegation, at least, there
were no doomsayers, no doubters, and no one who con
sidered Mondale boring.
"Did you ever doubt Mondale would make it?" a
reporter asked Humphrey.
"Not for even a moment," was his immediate reply.
"We've got a lot of work to do between now and No
vember," he added, "but we also had a lot of work to
do in January."
