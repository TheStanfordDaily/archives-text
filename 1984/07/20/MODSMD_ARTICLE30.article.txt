# Postal workers negotiate

Washington — Facing a midnight deadline today,
the U.S. Postal Service and the unions representing
600,000 postal employees agreed late yesterday to
resume contract talks that have been deadlocked
since the two major unions walked out of negotia
tions Monday. The negotiating session, scheduled
for 7 a.m. PDT today, was arranged by the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service, which has been
in touch with both sides since the stalemate.
If no settlement is reached by midnight tonight,
the nation's largest labor contract may for the first
time be settled by a three-member arbitration panel,
whose decision would be binding. Strikes by postal
employees are illegal, but union officials said yester
day no decision would be made on whether to call a
nationwide strike until the national union conven
tions next month in Las Vegas.
