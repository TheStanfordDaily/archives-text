# Soviets may violate SALT
## 
### 
Washington — Intelligence photographs are
prompting suspicions within the Reagan administra
tion that the Soviet Union may be preparing to test a
new strategic missile in contravention of existing
arms accords, but some U.S. officials consider the
evidence inconclusive.
From the reconnaissance photographs of silos at
Plesetsk, beyond the Arctic Circle near Archan
gelsk, "it's safe to assume they are" getting ready to
test a new SSX-26 missile, a U.S. official said, on
condition he not be identified.
But two other officials said the intelligence was in
sufficient to accuse the Soviets of violating the un
ratified 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
(SALT II). One doubted the Soviets planned to test
a new intercontinental ballistic missile and the other
said while there were some "components" available,
development of an SSX-26 was unlikely.
