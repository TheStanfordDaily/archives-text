## Mondale vows presidency of 'new realism' 
### 
San Francisco — Walter Mondale,
wrapping upVi Democratic National
Convention that struggled to heal the
wounds of a divisive primary cam
paign and reach out to new voters,
last night promised a presidency of
'new realism," dedicated to tough
minded economic policies and a
strong but conciliatory posture
abroad.
Mondale's speech accepting the
presidential nomination muted the
liberalism that has marked his politi
cal career and, acknowledging
mistakes that led the party to defeat
in 1980, sought to make the general
election campaign against President
Reagan "a referendum on (the)
future."
"Tonight, we come to you with a
new realism," Mondale said, "ready
for the future and recapturing the best
in our tradition. We know that
America must have a strong defense
and a sober view of the Soviets. We
know that government must be as
well-managed as it is well-meaning.
We know that a healthy, growing
private economy is the key to our
future."
Admitting that "Ronald Reagan
beat the pants off us" in 1980,
Mondale told voters in his nationally
televised speech: "1 heard you. And
our party heard you."
But the nominee also sharply at
tacked the Reagan administration in
familiar Democratic ways, on both
defense and the important "fairness"
issue.
"You did not vote for a $200 bil
lion deficit, he told those who sup
ported Reagan in 1980. "You did not
vote for an arms race. You did not
vote to turn the heavens into a bat
tleground. You did not vote to savage

Social Security and Medicare. You
did not vote to trash the civil rights
laws. You did not vote to assault the
poor, the sick and the disabled."
He warned that a re-elected
Reagan would "sock it to average
income families again, and leave his
rich friends alone."
"I won't," Mondale promised.
He emphasized the selection of
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.), as
the first woman vice-presidential can
didate on a major-party ticket.
"Tonight, we open a new door to the
future," Mondale said. "Mr. Reagan
calls that 'tokenism.' We call it
America."
Mondale also reached out to his
defeated rivals, Sen. Gary Hart (D-
Colo.) and Jesse Jackson, in an effort
to bring unity to a party that has just
experienced one of its most difficult
nomination fights in recent history.
But Democrats gathered here
largely avoided the divisiveness
feared by some party officials, and
delegates expressed unity in their
desire to dislodge Reagan from the
White House but pessimism that the
ticket will do so.
The evening program included a
speech by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.), whose 1980 campaign to
defeat then-President Jimmy Carter
for the nomination left the party
divided and dispirited. Last night,
Kennedy introduced Mondale,
praised his choice of Ferraro as a run
ning mate and predicted victory in
November.
"With the leadership of Walter
Mondale, we will free ourselves to
find the future," Kennedy said, "but
we will never flee from responsibility
lor those who have been left out or
left behind.

"We will never turn aside from in
justice and pain and pretend that we
do not see. We will restore the
guiding value of American progress
— that we must advance not by climb
ing over each other, but by bringing
everyone along."
Mondale's acceptance speech, six
weeks in the drafting, was a personal
statement about himself and a series
of promises designed to open the at
tack against Reagan by contrasting a
prospective Mondale administration
with the Republican record of the last
four years.
Playing down liberal programs that
marked his political maturation, the
former vice president made his case to
the nation last night as a leader who
has learned and changed in his four
years out of public office.
"We are wiser, stronger and
focused on the future," Mondale said.
"If Mr. Reagan wants to rerun the
1980 campaign, fine. Let them fight
over the past. We're fighting for the
American future, and that's why
we're going to win."
Mondale charged that Reagan has
misled Americans and said Republi
can policies have left the country in
trouble.
"Here is the truth about the
future," Mondale said. "We are living
on borrowed money and borrowed
time. These (federal budget) deficits
hike interest rates, clobber exports,
stunt investment, kill jobs, undermine
growth, cheat our kids and shrink our
future."
Mondale promised to cut the deficit
by two-thirds during his first term. He
also pledged to raise taxes "fairly"
without "socking it to average
income families," and warned that,
during a second term, Reagan will

raise taxes. He challenged the presi
dent to say before the Nov. 6 election
how he would increase taxes to trim
the deficit.
"I challenge Mr. Reagan to put his
plan on the table next to mine and
debate it with me on national televi
sion," Mondale said. "Americans
want the truth about the future, not
after the election, but now."
Playing off Reagan's well-known
line from his 1980 debate with Carter,
Mondale said, "Four years ago, many
of you voted for Mr. Reagan because
he promised you'd be better off. And
today, the rich are better off. But
working Americans are worse off, and
the middle class is standing on a tran
door." F
Mondale warned that the effect of
Reagan's policies will be felt next
year, regardless of who is elected.
"Whoever is inaugurated in Janu
ary, the American people will have to
pay Mr. Reagan's bills," he said. "The
budget will be squeezed. Taxes will go
up. And anyone who says they won't
is not telling the truth."
On foreign policy, Mondale
combined peace and power. "Lately,
as we've neared the election, this ad
ministration has been talking about a
safer world," he said. "There's a dif
ference. As president, I will work for
peace and strength from my first day
in office, not from my first day cam
paigning for re-election."
Mondale committed himself to
reduce the risk of nuclear war through
a more vigorous effort at negotiating
with the Soviet Union and restoration
of the emphasis on human rights in
foreign policy that marked the Carter
administration.
