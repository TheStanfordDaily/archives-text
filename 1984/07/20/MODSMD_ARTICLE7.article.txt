# Ferraro says she will transcend tradition

San Francisco — Geraldine
Ferraro, an immigrant's
daughter from Archie Bunker's
district in Queens, last night told
a cheering Democratic National
Convention that her selection as
the first woman on the presiden
tial ticket of a major party
proved that, "America is the
land where dreams can come
true for all our citizens."
"Occasionally in life there
were moments which cannot be
completely explained by
words," she said, quoting from

the late Martin Luther King Jr.,
her voice quavering with emo
tion. "Their meaning can only
be articulated by the inaudible
language of the heart."
"Tonight is such a moment
for me," the 48-year-old con
gresswoman said in her first na
tionally televised speech after
being nominated by acclamation
last night as the party's vice
presidential candidate. "My
heart is filled with pride."
A sea of blue Mondale-
Ferraro placards waved below

the convention podium and the
crowd interrupted her to chant,
"Ger-ry, Ger-ry, Gerry!"
"By choosing an American
woman to run for our nation's
second-highest office, you send
a powerful signal to all
Americans," she added later.
"There are no doors we cannot
unlock. We will place no limits
on achievement.
Ferraro demonstrated that
she can forcefully challenge
Republicans on the basic, fun
damental values that Reagan

has used to his political advan
tage during the last four years.
She then launched a tough,
partisan attack on the Reagan
administration, charging that
under it"the rules are rigged
against too many of our
people."
Her experience clearly will be
at issue. But last night, Ferraro
concentrated on her roots and
values, not her experience.
"To those who understand
that our country cannot prosper
unless we draw on the talents of

all Americans, we say: We will
pass the Equal Rights Amend
ment," she said. "The issue is
not what America can do for
women, but what women can do
for America."
"To those concerned about
the strength of family values, as
I am, I say: we are going to
restore those values — love,
caring, partnership — by includ
ing, not excluding, those whose
beliefs differ from our own."
