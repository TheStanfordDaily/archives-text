# Mondale theme: rescue U.S. from Reagan
## 
### 
San Francisco — In the most impor
tant moment of his 36 years in politics,
Walter Mondale presented himself last
night as a tough, chastened political
realist who is prepared to lead a rescue
mission to save a nation living "on
borrowed time."
Accepting the Democratic Party nom
ination for president from a convention
whose delegates are measurably more
liberal than most in the watching televi-

sion audience, Mondale offered no New
Deal or New Frontier agenda of social
legislation but "a new realism" for a na
tion facing massive deficits and a
nuclear-armed world.
The former vice president spoke as a
man who had learned more from having
"Ronald Reagan beat the pants off us"
in 1980 than any lessons he had ab
sorbed from his liberal mentor, Hubert
Humphrey.
With his pollsters and advisers telling
him that 20 years in national politics had
not produced more than a hazy image in
the minds of most voters, Mondale took

the opportunity to draw a self-portrait of
a man embodying all the traditional,
middle-class values of the rural Midwest.
His running-mate, Geraldine Ferraro,
was presented, with equal care, not as a
precedent-shattering feminist but as an
immigrant daughter of New York, who
had come up by applying the old rules:
"Doing your work, earning your way,
paying your dues (and) rising on merit."
The audience for this speech was not
the liberal delegates in Moscone Center,
the men and women who had debated
how far to go in strengthening
affirmative-action rules and whether to
bar American "first-use" of nuclear
weapons.
It was Mr. and Mrs. Middle American
to whom Mondale appealed. "Look at
our platform," he asked. "There are no
defense cuts that weaken our security; no
business taxes that weaken our economy;
no laundry lists that raid our treasury."
Just as Ronald Reagan in Detroit in
1980 talked over the heads of the con
servative delegates in Joe Louis Arena,
so Mondale aimed his rhetoric at the
"soft Democrats" and ticket-splitters
who deserted in droves in 1980 and pun
ished Jimmy Carter and Mondale for

what he acknowledged last night were
"our mistakes."
In talking to those "soft Democrats,"
he used words like "strength," "fight"
and "challenge" more than 17 times to
show that he had emerged from the 1980
loss and from the lengthy battle for this
nomination as a man determined that
America "will not be pushed around any
more."
Ferraro, in her acceptance speech,
showed an equal degree of rhetorical
toughness, playing the traditional
"attack role" of the running-mate with
zest as she asserted that policy after
policy of the Reagan administration
"isn't right."
The tone of both speeches was a pre
emptive strike against what the Mondale
campaign expects from Reagan and the
Republicans at their convention in Dal
las next month: an effort to convict
Mondale of being what one aide called
"a wimp by association" with Carter.
"If Mr. Reagan wants to rerun the
1980 campaign, fine," Mondale said, dis
playing a bravado greater than many of
the delegates have expressed about that
prospect. "Let them fight over the past.
We're fighting for the American future,

and that's why we're going to win."
To win, Mondale aides believe, they
have to shift the debate to the future —
and convince the voters in a nation now
enjoying both prosperity and peace that
there is terrible peril in allowing Reagan
a second term.
This was the part of the Mondale
message that perhaps went over better in
the convention hall than in the living
rooms of the nation.
Opposition to Reagan — far more
than enthusiasm for Mondale — has
been the glue that brought the backers of
Jesse Jackson, and Hart into a
reasonable facsimile of unity behind the
Mondale-Ferraro ticket yestrday. "A
Reagan victory in November is the
shadow that hangs over this whole
place," said Rep. Leon Panetta of Cali
fornia.
Last night, the message was the man
and his sense of his own mission — and
the public reaction to it may well deter
mine whether Mondale can mount a
serious challenge to Reagan s policies in
the weeks ahead, or whether it is his own
candidacy that is living "on borrowed
time."
