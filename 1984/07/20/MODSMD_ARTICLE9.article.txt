## Gerard Koskovich Ignored by Daily, gay marcher tells story 
### 
The Stanford Daily headline writer no
doubt intended no irony last week when
he or she titled my column on the Na
tional March for Lesbian/Gay Rights
"Media can't ignore gay and lesbian
march." The irony only became evident
when I read The Daily Tuesday morning
and found to my astonishment not a
word about the gathering of 100,000
supporters of lesbian and gay rights in
San Francisco the previous Sunday.
I likewise searched with no success for
any mention of the struggle for equality
by gay men and lesbians in The Daily
story on the arrival of the Olympic torch
at Stanford. The reporter let us know
how much he enjoyed the beer that
Olympic officials had provided for the
Stanford band; he failed to take note of
the group of lesbians, gay men and non
gay friends with flyers and large signs
protesting recent homophobic actions of
the United States Olympic Committee
(USOC).
For readers who had expected more
responsible reporting than The Daily
managed to provide this time out, I
would like to record a few personal ob

servations on the march in the City and
the demonstrations at Stanford. Here,
then, are some notes from my gay
"Reporter's Notebook":
When I arrive at Castro and Market
Streets in San Francisco Sunday at noon,
groups are already gathering outside the
Twin Peaks and the Elephant Walk, two
of the most popular bars on Castro.
The street is still fairly quiet, but the
crowd around the Elephant Walk makes
me recall the night five years before
when police trashed the bar and its pa
trons in an unprovoked homophobic at
tack shortly after the "White Night" riot
at San Francisco City Hall. Few uni
formed officers are in evidence today; in
their place, friendly lesbian and gay vol
unteers in bright orange National March
T-shirts stroll about, walkie-talkies in
one hand, pink march order sheets in the
other.
I take up a spot on the corner at Har
vey Milk Plaza (the supposed destination
of the Stanford cast of George Segal's
"Gay Liberation"). A dozen kids from
the San Jose Slightly Younger Lesbians
and Gays support group ascend from the

Muni-Metro station. I dispense hellos,
hugs, handshakes and kisses, even a
punch in the shoulder or two. This gets a
laugh — butch behavior is clearly noth
ing more than teasing in my case.
Friends wander by. "Hey, aren't you
marching?" they ask. I reassure them.
"Well, where's Stanford, then?" I point
them toward Dolores Park, where the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) contingent is meeting and add
that I'm waiting for GLAS to come past
the corner; they're near the end of the
march, and I want to photograph the
preceding groups.
Castro Street has been filling with
marchers for an hour. I climb atop a
newspaper rack and look up the strip:
For two long blocks, from storefront to
storefront, an unbroken crowd jostles
politely for position behind banners
representing the 12 demands of the
march, as well as geographical regions.
Around the corner on 19th Street, Cali
fornia contingents are gathering.
At 10 minutes to 2:00, police remove
the barricade at Market and the mar
chers surge forward with a cheer and

wild clapping. The sound passes up
Castro. The lead contingent — including
numerous lesbian and gay delegates from
the Democratic National Convention,
lesbian and gay elected officials, march
organizers and speakers invited for the
closing rally at Moscone Center — turns
down Market past banks of television
cameras and dozens of reporters.
Marchers continue by for over 45
minutes before the GLAS contingent ap
pears. I have already greeted Stanford
friends in the "Pass the ERA" group,
shouted 'Que vive nos amours/" when
Parisians from the Comite d'urgence anti
repression homosexuelle marched past,
and spotted signs identifying gay Ameri
can Indians, gay Texans, lesbian and gay
New Yorkers, gay fathers, parents of les
bians and gays, all demanding justice and
equality for every American, regardless
of sexual orientation.
The GLAS group includes over 35
people by the time we reach the
Moscone Center. Among our number is
Stanford's most distinguished gay
alumnus, Harry Hay, who came out as a
sophomore at Stanford in 1931; Harry
went on, in 1950, to found the Mattachine Soci
ety, the first successful homosexual rights organi
zation in the nation. Harry's politics are as
progressive as ever: his ribbon-bedecked, pink tri
angular sign reads "Gays against U.S. interven
tion in centra . . . ANYWHERE!"
The march in San Francisco Sunday was
essentially a festive show of the lesbian and gay

community's strength and confidence. By con
trast, the events of Monday evening reminded gay
men and lesbians here at Stanford how far we
have to go before we achieve our rightful position
of equality and respect in American society.
Upon discovering that the Olympic torch would
be stopping at Stanford that evening, a network of
individuals involved with the mid-Peninsula les
bian and gay community organized a demonstra
tion against U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC)
homophobia in less than two and one-half hours.
Few non-gay people realize that the USOC has

been squandering its time, energy and resources
for over two years in vindictive court actions
against the organizers of the Gay Games, a San
Francisco-based group that sponsors a quadren
nial international athletic competition for les
bians, gay men and our friends.
The Gay Games had originally been billed as
the Gay Olympic Games, leading the USOC to
sue for infringement of license. Given the fact that
no other non-profit group using the term
"Olympics" (among them police Olympics, chili
cooking Olympics, and frog-jumping Olympics)
has been pursued in court, the homophobia of the
USOC actions is unmistakable.
The most enlightening aspect of the demonstra
tion Monday was the reaction of the famed liberal
populace of Palo Alto, which had gathered to
greet the Olympic torch. We crossed from Town
and Country Shopping Center to shouts of
"faggot"; as we carried our signs to the
grandstand near Stanford Stadium, various mem
bers of the public wished us speedy deaths from
AIDS. A teenage boy wrenched the sign from one
demonstrator's hands and ripped it in two.
Clearly, we have work to do on the Peninsula
before the splendid promise of the National
March is realized here. I have no doubt that Stan
ford's lesbian and gay community stands ready
and committed to continue with our struggle:
Indeed, plans for the opening of the Olympic soc
cer trials at the end of the month are already un
derway.
