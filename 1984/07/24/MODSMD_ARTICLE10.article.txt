## Burned by the Olympic torch 
### 
It seemed simple enough. Go
to the store, grab a six-pack of
drinks and head home. A 20-
minute trip tops. But not tonight
. . . tonight a trip to Safeway
turned into a trip into the Olym
pic Zone — dudu-dudu. (I'll
forego the usual Rod Sterling
impression that begins,
"imagine if you will ..." be
cause frankly, I do a lousy Ster
ling — I'm too short.)
Last night around 10 o'clock,
my friend (let's call him Mr. Y
to protect the innocent —
namely me — from embarrass
ment) and I decided we would
write a book entitled, "The Best
Times to Go Shopping." It was
the night the Olympic Torch
went running down El Camino,
zipped into Stanford and contin
ued toward Los Angeles. Mr. Y
and I didn't know this — we
were just thirsty. "Whaddya say
we go to the store and get some
drinks?" Y asked. "If you want
to go, great — I'm too tired."
Y's roommate (who will be
referred to as S from now on)
muttered.
So Y and I left (dudu-dudu).
Two things are vital to men
tion here. One, the car we were
in was old, rather run-down and
owned by someone in Colorado.
Two, Y doesn't have a license
and insisted on driving.
We didn't notice trouble until
we hit Palm Drive. "That's
odd," said Y. "Why are all these
people standing around in the
dark?" A feeling of terror came
over us. "The torch," we
whispered. "What are we going
to do?"
Y panicked. "All these
people, all these cars!"
"All these cops — Y, it's a red
light." Y slammed on the brakes
and realized it was going to be
long shopping trip.
Safeway was empty even
though the parking lot was full.
As we watched the crowd form
on El Camino, an escape plan
was formed — shop fast and get
out before it hit. But, even as we
realized with growing horror
that'the "star-in-motion" on the
half-jmelted ice cream on sale
wasn't just mere decoration, but

an omen, the first police car
siren could be heard outside.
"They're here," Y squeaked.
Left with no other choice, we,
with two other customers and all
the checkers, went outside
where the crowd was yelling and
the cops were piling up. As I
watched the torch go by, on the
balcony of the official super
market of the Olympics, my
hands still sticky from the offi
cial ice cream that leaked, I
tried to work up a feeling of
fate, a feeling of spiritual one
ness with the world, with my
country. What did surge up
from the pit of my being was the
realization that there was going
to be a lot of traffic. "Maybe we
can beat it home," I said.
It took Y only fifteen minutes
to make it out of the parking lot
— five of which were spent
starting the car. For a couple of
seconds we were on a clear El
Camino. I turned up the radio
and Y's death-grip on the steer
ing wheel loosened. Life was
good. Our fatal mistake would
be not taking the first Stanford
exit, Palm Drive. We figured it
would still be packed, but as we
whizzed by, not a car was in
sight on Palm. A moment later
we knew why — they were all in
front of us.
Then the car stalled. "Idiots,"
Y barked. People everywhere
were risking their lives by cross
ing the jammed street to get a
better view of the approaching
torch. Patriotism swelled. Three
particularly caught-up young
men were yelling, "We'll show
those foreigners. We'll kick
butt. We'll show those Japanese
..." from the window of their
Toyota. Y gunned the motor
and the sweet smell of gasoline
filled the car.
"In a bizarre way this is kinda
fun, isn't it," I said to Y. He
glared past me looking for an
opening to change lanes. "God,
I wish S was here," he muttered.
"I guess I shouldn't complain —
I was able to see the Olympic
Torch — twice — and someday
I'll get to tell my grandchildren
about . . . grandma, what's an
Olympic?"
"Oh sweetheart, they were
sports games that different
countries from all over the
world played in — that's before
the 1992 games in Iran when
nobody showed up "
