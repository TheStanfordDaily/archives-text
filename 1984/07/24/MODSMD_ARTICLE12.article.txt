Fetter cartoon
was insensitive
Insensitive. If the Stanford
Daily was applying for admis
sion, this would be its adjective
of self-description! The cartoon
in the July 20th Daily depicts
Dean Jean Fetter, new dean of
undergraduate admissions, at
tempting to "fill the shoes"
(extremely large ones) of
former Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon. Dean Jean is
saying, "I was looking for some
thing a little more sensible."
Hardly a warm welcome for our
week-old dean!
By printing this cartoon, The
Daily has subscribed to
chauvinistic attitudes toward
women which are inappropriate
for the times (Do Daily editors
read national newspaper
headlines?) and possibly insult
ing to Dean Jean Fetter. Our
new dean was chosen for her
scholastic and administrative
achievements as well as her en
thusiasm and love for students.
Dean Jean is coming to the old
union to fill a position — not to
replace Dean Fred. She brings a
new and exciting dimension to
the admissions office. The Daily
should welcome her for who and
what she is. Fortunately, the
cartoon was printed in summer
and the new frosh (and return
ing students) will not develop
unfair notions of her attitudes.
If Dean Jean Fetter was
looking for something "a little
more sensible," dean of admis
sions is hardly the position to
find it at. It is a challenging job.
The Daily owes the new dean
"half a chance" . . . Who
knows? The Daily may find it
self at the beginning of a new
romance!

Manley's advice
As a Reagan supporter, I
agree wholeheartedly with Prof.
John Manley's advice to Walter
Mondale (issue of July 10, front
page) to take a more leftist posi
tion in the presidential cam
paign and to "hit hard." By
taking that advice, Mondale
could turn a Reagan victory into
a Reagan landslide. It is self
evident that those who would be

favorably influenced by a
stronger left-wing strategy will
vote against Ronald Reagan
anyway, no matter what Mr.
Mondale does. But many others
"in between" will then fear, for
good reasons, that a Mondale
victory would bring about a re
sumption of soaring government
spending, runaway inflation, of
increased redistribution of earn
ings from the productive to the
nonproductive sectors of society
and of less industrial invest
ment, lower productivity, fur
ther diminished American
ability to compete with foreign
countries and consequently
higher unemployment, besides a
weakened national security. So,
from this side it's cheers for
Prof. Manley's advice to Mr.
Mondale.

Israeli policies
are not racist
Many misconceptions about
Jews and Israel find their way
into statements about the Arab-
Israeli conflict. We shall com
ment on several of the more
serious ones that appear in
Jamil Talhouk's Viewpoint

(Daily, June 29), since clarifica
tion of these points is essential
to constructive discussion.
The Jews are not a race, nor
are they simply a group with a
common faith. They are more
properly called a "people" or a
"nation" (in Hebrew, Am),
bound together by a complex
web of culture, history and reli
gion. Judaism, in fact, has no
concept of "race."
Zionism, as the national
liberation movement of the
Jewish people, also has no con
cept of "race." Zionism is the
organized struggle of this nation
to return to its homeland and
build an independent Jewish
state.
The Law of Return, which al
lows Jews to become citizens of
the State of Israel immediately
upon arrival, is not racist be
cause it does not discriminate on
the basis of race. It does dis
criminate (that is, make distinc
tions) on the basis of national
group; so do the immigration
laws of every modern state. For
example, Norwegian law awards
citizenship to the children of
Norwegians living abroad; this
discriminates in favor of Nor
wegians, but such
"discrimination" is the right of
the Norwegian government.

In addition, the Law of
Return is not the only way to
become a citizen of the Jewish
state. Israel grants citizenship to
both Jews and non-Jews who
meet certain standard require
ments.
The Jews are not a race, but
those who attack Israel often
rely, inappropriately, on racial
arguments. Talhouk in his
Viewpoint mentions the theory
of the Khazars to impugn the ra
cial authenticity of Ashkenazic
(European) Jews. This theory is
highly speculative and is unsub
stantiated. More importantly,
however, the Jews do not claim
racial unity, but rather continu
ity of nationhood and a contin
uous connection with the land of
Israel.
The Jewish people are in
digenous to the Middle East. It
was there that they were
formed, there, in the Land of Is
rael, that they lived an indepen
dent political life, and from
there that they were dispersed.
Most Jews continued to live in
the Middle East even after
being exiled from the land of Is
rael; this Middle Eastern branch
of the Jews today makes up the
majority of the state of Israel's
citizens. And Jews have lived in
the land of Israel continuously

for over three millennia, even
during the period of exile.
The Jews have not returned in
large numbers to their
homeland. Many of the conflicts
between Jew and Arab are,
indeed, "a clash of two rights" (
as Dean Hamerton-Kelly wrote
in the Daily, July 13). Talhouk,
however, says regarding the
Jews and the Land of Israel,
"What rights and what his
tory?" Such attitudes throw up
an almost insurmountable bar
rier to a just and peaceful
resolution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.

unfair notions of her attitudes.
If Dean Jean Fetter was
looking for something "a little
more sensible," dean of admis
sions is hardly the position to
find it at. It is a challenging job.
The Daily owes the new dean
"half a chance" . . . Who
knows? The Daily may find it
self at the beginning of a new
romance!

Manley's advice
As a Reagan supporter, I
agree wholeheartedly with Prof.
John Manley's advice to Walter
Mondale (issue of July 10, front
page) to take a more leftist posi
tion in the presidential cam
paign and to "hit hard." By
taking that advice, Mondale
could turn a Reagan victory into
a Reagan landslide. It is self
evident that those who would be

favorably influenced by a
stronger left-wing strategy will
vote against Ronald Reagan
anyway, no matter what Mr.
Mondale does. But many others
"in between" will then fear, for
good reasons, that a Mondale
victory would bring about a re
sumption of soaring government
spending, runaway inflation, of
increased redistribution of earn
ings from the productive to the
nonproductive sectors of society
and of less industrial invest
ment, lower productivity, fur
ther diminished American
ability to compete with foreign
countries and consequently
higher unemployment, besides a
weakened national security. So,
from this side it's cheers for
Prof. Manley's advice to Mr.
Mondale.

Israeli policies
are not racist
Many misconceptions about
Jews and Israel find their way
into statements about the Arab-
Israeli conflict. We shall com
ment on several of the more
serious ones that appear in
Jamil Talhouk's Viewpoint

(Daily, June 29), since clarifica
tion of these points is essential
to constructive discussion.
The Jews are not a race, nor
are they simply a group with a
common faith. They are more
properly called a "people" or a
"nation" (in Hebrew, Am),
bound together by a complex
web of culture, history and reli
gion. Judaism, in fact, has no
concept of "race."
Zionism, as the national
liberation movement of the
Jewish people, also has no con
cept of "race." Zionism is the
organized struggle of this nation
to return to its homeland and
build an independent Jewish
state.
The Law of Return, which al
lows Jews to become citizens of
the State of Israel immediately
upon arrival, is not racist be
cause it does not discriminate on
the basis of race. It does dis
criminate (that is, make distinc
tions) on the basis of national
group; so do the immigration
laws of every modern state. For
example, Norwegian law awards
citizenship to the children of
Norwegians living abroad; this
discriminates in favor of Nor
wegians, but such
"discrimination" is the right of
the Norwegian government.

In addition, the Law of
Return is not the only way to
become a citizen of the Jewish
state. Israel grants citizenship to
both Jews and non-Jews who
meet certain standard require
ments.
The Jews are not a race, but
those who attack Israel often
rely, inappropriately, on racial
arguments. Talhouk in his
Viewpoint mentions the theory
of the Khazars to impugn the ra
cial authenticity of Ashkenazic
(European) Jews. This theory is
highly speculative and is unsub
stantiated. More importantly,
however, the Jews do not claim
racial unity, but rather continu
ity of nationhood and a contin
uous connection with the land of
Israel.
The Jewish people are in
digenous to the Middle East. It
was there that they were
formed, there, in the Land of Is
rael, that they lived an indepen
dent political life, and from
there that they were dispersed.
Most Jews continued to live in
the Middle East even after
being exiled from the land of Is
rael; this Middle Eastern branch
of the Jews today makes up the
majority of the state of Israel's
citizens. And Jews have lived in
the land of Israel continuously

for over three millennia, even
during the period of exile.
The Jews have not returned in
large numbers to their
homeland. Many of the conflicts
between Jew and Arab are,
indeed, "a clash of two rights" (
as Dean Hamerton-Kelly wrote
in the Daily, July 13). Talhouk,
however, says regarding the
Jews and the Land of Israel,
"What rights and what his
tory?" Such attitudes throw up
an almost insurmountable bar
rier to a just and peaceful
resolution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.

Fetter cartoon
was insensitive
Insensitive. If the Stanford
Daily was applying for admis
sion, this would be its adjective
of self-description! The cartoon
in the July 20th Daily depicts
Dean Jean Fetter, new dean of
undergraduate admissions, at
tempting to "fill the shoes"
(extremely large ones) of
former Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon. Dean Jean is
saying, "I was looking for some
thing a little more sensible."
Hardly a warm welcome for our
week-old dean!
By printing this cartoon, The
Daily has subscribed to
chauvinistic attitudes toward
women which are inappropriate
for the times (Do Daily editors
read national newspaper
headlines?) and possibly insult
ing to Dean Jean Fetter. Our
new dean was chosen for her
scholastic and administrative
achievements as well as her en
thusiasm and love for students.
Dean Jean is coming to the old
union to fill a position — not to
replace Dean Fred. She brings a
new and exciting dimension to
the admissions office. The Daily
should welcome her for who and
what she is. Fortunately, the
cartoon was printed in summer
and the new frosh (and return
ing students) will not develop
unfair notions of her attitudes.
If Dean Jean Fetter was
looking for something "a little
more sensible," dean of admis
sions is hardly the position to
find it at. It is a challenging job.
The Daily owes the new dean
"half a chance" . . . Who
knows? The Daily may find it
