## Stanford Overseas Program; giving 
### CAROLYN MANN 
For many Stanford students,
the green light at the end of the
dock lies in Europe, Africa,
South America, or the Middle
East. Officials of the Overseas
Studies Program estimate that
up to 40 percent of the campus
population has spent one quar
ter or more studying in a foreign
country.
Most students go abroad be
cause they have friends there, or
they're curious about their an
cestry. Some just need time to
sort things out. A few even have
serious academic reasons.
But almost all come back with
an eye-opening experience that
changes their lives and may help
to change the course of history.
At least, that's what University
dons hope.
The University's commitment
to sending its students overseas
is strong; its goals, compelling.
They're squarely rooted in the

University's concept of inter
nationality and its humanistic
philosophy of education.
Tolerance and understanding
of another society, program of
ficials stress, is acquired through
an appreciation of that country's
language, art, history and cul
ture. And it is only through
tolerance and understanding
that the world's future leaders
and citizens, which Stanford is
helping to train, can govern the
planet creatively.
Last year, 430 of Stanford's
future leaders and citizens were
placed in 14 study centers and
universities around the world.
For the 1984-85 school year,
another $2.3 million has been
budgeted for the program.
But when asked, most stu
dents who have been overseas
will admit that their reasons for
applying to the program were
less altruistic than the Univer
sity's reasons for sending them.
Senior Rick Hoch, for exam
ple, decided while still in high
school that he would spend his
junior year of college living in
Israel.
"Israel was always a place I
wanted to go to," he said in an
interview. "There's all this his
tory going on there."
Hoch heard about the Over
seas Studies program just after
entering Stanford as a freshman.
It seemed to him the perfect
way to realize a childhood
dream. In July 1982, two years
later, he was in Haifa for "the
best year of my life."
Nancy Raff and Bob Pettit,
also seniors, applied to the

Overseas Studies Program be
cause their international rela
tions major required them to
study abroad.
But senior John Kenagy ad
mits that he wanted to go to
Italy because "I'm Italian."
All of these reasons for wan
ting to study in a foreign country
are valid, said Student Services
Coordinator Beth Soltis. Pro
gram officials believe that
mutual understanding requires
self-knowledge as much as
knowledge of others.
Because placement is limited,
however, how the student will
profit academically from the ex
perience is the bottom line in
the selection process.
"While reasons like 'getting a
new perspective on myself or
'seeing how another part of the
world lives' are legitimate and
laudable motives for going over
seas," officials state, "they do
not assist in distinguishing one
applicant from another. The
best (application) essays are
those which display careful
thought and specific informa
tion on the academic benefits
offered by study overseas to the
particular applicant."
Clear and simple advice, ex
cept for those staring at a blank
application.
When asked specifically what
qualities in an application catch
and hold their attention, pro
gram officials were even more
vague.
Being able to express yourself
sincerely and articulately on
paper helps. "But others can do
well too," Soltis said.

"Motivation" and "energy"
were other qualities she said are
valued.
Students who have studied
abroad were a bit more helpful.
After talking with four of tjiem,

it became clear that students
whose major requires study
overseas have a distinct advan
tage.
For example, Pettit, who was
in Salamanca, Spain, two quar
ters of last year, carries a dual
major in Spanish and interna
tional relations. His reason for
wanting to study in a Spanish
speaking country is self-evident.
His IR major also required
study abroad.
"I had gone as far as I could
in Spanish studies in America,"
Pettit said. "I had to be in an
other country to go further."
His decision to apply for the
program in Spain, instead of
South America, was more per

sonal, however. Pettit had been
in Barcelona in 1980 and still
had friends there.
"I wanted to be in the same
country with them," he added
and says he listed this motive on
his application form. "I was real
honest."
Kenagy's academic reasons
for wanting to study in Italy
were not as straightforward.
What could studying in Florence
offer an electrical engineering
major whose second language is
French?
But Kenagy is creative and he
thought of a benefit University
officials could swallow easily:
He wrote that he wanted to
diversify his education.
Studying abroad, he felt,
would add a more humanistic
element to the 117 units of
math, science and engineering
his major required. Also, he
already knew Piedmontese, an
Italian dialect close to French,
from his mother.
Hoch, who was then a math
major, noted his long-term in
terest in foreign affairs and
foreign policy.
For example, Kenagy realized
that Italians regard the United
States with a sisterhood feeling.
Raff found that contrary to
popular myth, the French are a
warm, witty people, who know
more about the dates and facts
of history than Americans do.
And Hoch saw there are move
ments within Israel to bring
Jewish and Arab groups to
gether.

ting to study in a foreign country
are valid, said Student Services
Coordinator Beth Soltis. Pro
gram officials believe that
mutual understanding requires
self-knowledge as much as
knowledge of others.
Because placement is limited,
however, how the student will
profit academically from the ex
perience is the bottom line in
the selection process.
"While reasons like 'getting a
new perspective on myself or
'seeing how another part of the
world lives' are legitimate and
laudable motives for going over
seas," officials state, "they do
not assist in distinguishing one
applicant from another. The
best (application) essays are
those which display careful
thought and specific informa
tion on the academic benefits
offered by study overseas to the
particular applicant."
Clear and simple advice, ex
cept for those staring at a blank
application.
When asked specifically what
qualities in an application catch
and hold their attention, pro
gram officials were even more
vague.
Being able to express yourself
sincerely and articulately on
paper helps. "But others can do
well too," Soltis said.

"Motivation" and "energy"
were other qualities she said are
valued.
Students who have studied
abroad were a bit more helpful.
After talking with four of tjiem,

it became clear that students
whose major requires study
overseas have a distinct advan
tage.
For example, Pettit, who was
in Salamanca, Spain, two quar
ters of last year, carries a dual
major in Spanish and interna
tional relations. His reason for
wanting to study in a Spanish
speaking country is self-evident.
His IR major also required
study abroad.
"I had gone as far as I could
in Spanish studies in America,"
Pettit said. "I had to be in an
other country to go further."
His decision to apply for the
program in Spain, instead of
South America, was more per

sonal, however. Pettit had been
in Barcelona in 1980 and still
had friends there.
"I wanted to be in the same
country with them," he added
and says he listed this motive on
his application form. "I was real
honest."
Kenagy's academic reasons
for wanting to study in Italy
were not as straightforward.
What could studying in Florence
offer an electrical engineering
major whose second language is
French?
But Kenagy is creative and he
thought of a benefit University
officials could swallow easily:
He wrote that he wanted to
diversify his education.
Studying abroad, he felt,
would add a more humanistic
element to the 117 units of
math, science and engineering
his major required. Also, he
already knew Piedmontese, an
Italian dialect close to French,
from his mother.
Hoch, who was then a math
major, noted his long-term in
terest in foreign affairs and
foreign policy.
For example, Kenagy realized
that Italians regard the United
States with a sisterhood feeling.
Raff found that contrary to
popular myth, the French are a
warm, witty people, who know
more about the dates and facts
of history than Americans do.
And Hoch saw there are move
ments within Israel to bring
Jewish and Arab groups to
gether.
Most students, in fact, come
back with a deep appreciation of


For many Stanford students,
the green light at the end of the
dock lies in Europe, Africa,
South America, or the Middle
East. Officials of the Overseas
Studies Program estimate that
up to 40 percent of the campus
population has spent one quar
ter or more studying in a foreign
country.
Most students go abroad be
cause they have friends there, or
they're curious about their an
cestry. Some just need time to
sort things out. A few even have
serious academic reasons.
But almost all come back with
an eye-opening experience that
changes their lives and may help
to change the course of history.
At least, that's what University
dons hope.
The University's commitment
to sending its students overseas
is strong; its goals, compelling.
They're squarely rooted in the

University's concept of inter
nationality and its humanistic
philosophy of education.
Tolerance and understanding
of another society, program of
ficials stress, is acquired through
an appreciation of that country's
language, art, history and cul
ture. And it is only through
tolerance and understanding
that the world's future leaders
and citizens, which Stanford is
helping to train, can govern the
planet creatively.
Last year, 430 of Stanford's
future leaders and citizens were
placed in 14 study centers and
universities around the world.
For the 1984-85 school year,
another $2.3 million has been
budgeted for the program.
But when asked, most stu
dents who have been overseas
will admit that their reasons for
applying to the program were
less altruistic than the Univer
sity's reasons for sending them.
Senior Rick Hoch, for exam
ple, decided while still in high
school that he would spend his
junior year of college living in
Israel.
"Israel was always a place I
wanted to go to," he said in an
interview. "There's all this his
tory going on there."
Hoch heard about the Over
seas Studies program just after
entering Stanford as a freshman.
It seemed to him the perfect
way to realize a childhood
dream. In July 1982, two years
later, he was in Haifa for "the
best year of my life."
Nancy Raff and Bob Pettit,
also seniors, applied to the

Overseas Studies Program be
cause their international rela
tions major required them to
study abroad.
But senior John Kenagy ad
mits that he wanted to go to
Italy because "I'm Italian."
