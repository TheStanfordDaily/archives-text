# students 'broad and fresh horizons'

the culture in which they lived
for several weeks or months.
But more important is their
heightened awareness of how
we "Yankees" are perceived
abroad.
Raff, who spent last spring
quarter in Tours, France,
recounted how she nearly went
insane the first week she was
there, because everything she
attempted to do, "they didn't do
that way." She could not find
the graph paper she needed.
When she instinctively tilted her
head to the right in order to
read the spines of books on a
shelf, she found the French
printed them to the left.
But after a few days she ad
justed and came face to face
with a stereotype — the Ugly
American. She was greatly sad
dened, she said, by all the "Bert
and Ethels" who breeze through
French museums and galleries
criticizing the artifacts of a cul
ture they had not taken the time
to understand.
Kenagy, on the other hand,
discovered that ethnocentrism
goes both ways.
He told of attending a rally in
Vermo one afternoon with a
friend and overhearing some
nearby Italians talk about the
horrible Germans and their
ugly, guttural language. He sud
denly realized they were talking
about him and his friend, who

were both tall and blond and
speaking in English!
Language facility is probably
the greatest aid in optimizing
the student's study abroad.
Those students proficient in the
country's language can often en
roll in the local university and
attend classes with foreign stu
dents.
Though language require
ments for the different pro
grams vary from none at Oxford
to two years at Salamanca,
several only require two quar
ters.
The programs vary greatly in
both the type of lifestyle offered
and the amount of interaction
the student has with local resi
dents.

On the one hand, the pro
gram at Florence is completely
self-contained in a "plush villa"
set in serene gardens and
woods, 20 minutes from the
city. Kenagy described it as "the
Disneyland of Europe."
Students who are less inde
pendent often become so com
fortable at the villa, according to
Kenagy and others, that they
never leave it. One can even buy
postcards and stamps there.
The program in Salamanca,
on the other hand, requires
greater self-reliance. Students
there attend the University of
Salamanca and live in
residences with foreign students
or families. Pettit described his
dorm as drafty and cold, and the
food as dull — not bad, but the
same day in and day out.
Finally, the course work at
the different centers can be
heavy or light, depending on the
program director.
All those interviewed des
cribed the amount of work re
quired as less than at Stanford,
with the exception of Pettit, who
said his was equivalent. But he
also was the only student who
offered high praise for the pro
gram director, in this case Isabel
Criado Miguel.
"The program wouldn't be
the same without her," he
noted, adding that his course
work there satisfied almost half

of the units he needed for his
Spanish major.
Other students complained
that few of the courses they took
overseas applied to their
majors.
Raff admitted she was disap
pointed that she received so few
credits toward her international
relations major, even though
she was required to go overseas.
When Hoch found himself in
a similar predicament, he
decided to change his major
from math to Jewish studies.
Through this ploy, he didn't lose
any credits.
Changing one's major is per
haps the most dramatic example
of how studying abroad can
change a student's life.
Kenagy already has plans to
move to Italy after graduation
and to incorporate his electrical
engineering expertise with his
new-found interest in foreign
relations.
Pettit speaks fondly of the
friends he made in Spain and of
the vibrant, middle-sized city of
Salamanca, where the locals
gather in the afternoons at
downtown bars, or at midday
for coffee.
And Raff said by going over
seas in her sophomore year, she
avoided "sophomore slump"
and became more focused con
cerning her education.
Whether Hoch's picking

avocados and grapefruit on an
Israeli kibbutz, or Raffs sharing
pastry and conversation with
French restaurant-goers, will
change the course of history has
yet to be seen.
Program officials report,
however, that the number of
students applying to the pro
gram has decreased in the past
five years.
Soltis attributes this to stu
dents being "more goal
oriented, attending more to ful
filling requirements rather than
pursuing a general education."
She hopes this re-focusing on
the immediate future doesn't
cause tomorrow's leaders and
citizens to become like "boats
against the current, borne back
ceaselessly into the past."
