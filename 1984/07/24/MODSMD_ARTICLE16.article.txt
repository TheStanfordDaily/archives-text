# Jasper Ridge-a nearby natural showcase

### DAN CORAN 
West of the main campus and
within a stone's throw of the
Linear Accelerator Center lie
2300 acres of thriving animal
and plant life. The Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve has pro
vided an undisturbed natural
showcase for both scholars and
students since the opening of
the University in 1891.
Primarily a research preserve,
the ridge is a microcosm of the
central coast ranges of Califor
nia. Within its boundaries a
sampling of seven of the ten
plant communities native to the
entire coast range can be found:
chaparral, mixed evergreen for
est, oak woodlands, freshwater
marsh, steam bank vegetation,
grasslands and redwood forest.
Only saltwater marsh, coast
strand and ocean front plant
communities are missing.
This great diversity in
landscape provides a home for
such animals as coyotes, bob
cats, rodents, reptiles, but
terflies and a vast variety of
birds. According to Alan
Grundmann, the ridge's admin
istrative director, "It is unusual
to find so many kinds of living
things in one small area. It is vir
tually unheard of to find such an
area on a university campus â€”
subject to constant study." The
geology of the ridge also allows
for the growth in certain areas
of scarce native "bunch grasses"
and an impressive array of Cali
fornia wildflowers. Grundmann
said Jasper Ridge is the only
such grassland area preserved
for research in California.
This treasurehouse of natural

history has been used ex
tensively by members of the
Stanford faculty doing research
in such fields as population biol
ogy, physiological ecology and
the behavior of herbivorous in
sects. Since the first Ph.D thesis
using Jasper Ridge was com
pleted in 1897, over 100 stu
dents have used the preserve in
working toward their doc
torates. This history of scholar
ship is one of the things which
helps distinguish Jasper Ridge
from other field study areas. Its
proximity to the main campus
and its variety of plant commun
ities are two others.
Numerous undergraduate bi
ology courses make use of
Jasper Ridge, and advanced un
dergraduates as well as graduate
students are allowed to pursue
independent study on the
preserve. In addition to these
small thesis projects, the ridge
supports the joint, large-scale
research program of professors
Harold Mooney, Paul Ehrlich
and Jonathan Roughgarden.
Their work investigates whether
or not a given plant community
will evolve in such a way as to
allow for the maximum possible
utilization of the solar energy
which falls on it.
Ehrlich's work on the popula
tion biology of the checkerspot
butterfly, conducted on Jasper
Ridge since 1960, has produced
important insights into the rela
tionship between herbivorous
insects and their food plants, as
well as into the causes of popu
lation fluctuations of such in
sects. Because Jasper Ridge is
protected from any kind of

outside disturbances, long-term
research projects such as these
are made feasible.
Jasper Ridge's secure re
search environment has not al
ways been so safeguarded.
Before the University existed,
the ridge area was used mostly
for light grazing and some minor
mineral exploration. One such
miner, Domingo Grosso (the
Hermit) lived on the ridge from
1891 to 1915. Before him, John
Murray built a grain mill on San
Francisquito Creek in 1852.
Around 1940, a Boy Scout
camp was set up in a ravine, and
soldiers during World War I
may have used the ridge for
maneuvers.
Formal designation of the
ridge as a preserve in 1973 put

an end to the threatening effects
of Searsville Lake users, neigh
boring horse riders and spring
wildflower watchers. Not until
1975, however, when the Uni
versity's board of trustees ex
panded the biological preserve
to 1200 acres, was the security
of Searsville Lake included with
that of the rest of Jasper Ridge.
Although Jasper Ridge is
primarily reserved for research
and experimental fieldwork, a
well-developed program of
public tours has made the
preserve accessible to anyone
interested in finding out about
it. A program of training
docents to lead tours through
the ridge began in 1975, and as
training became more formal it
was finally structured as an un
dergraduate course.

Students who wish to become
docents must take a two
quarter, two unit per quarter se
quence entitled Biology 195: Ap
plied Ecology. Given during the
winter and spring quarters, ap
plication must be made to the
Jasper Ridge office (Biological
Science Bldg., rm. 211) during
the fall quarter, and candidates
are chosen in December. There
are currently sixty docents, one
third of whom are students.
Approximately 3500 people
visited Jasper Ridge last year,
most of whom came during the
spring to witness the impressive
grassland wildflower display. No
tours are offered during the
summer, however, because
demand is too low.
Tours are arrranged by the
Jasper Ridge Tour Service
(327-2277) according to
demand, and there are no regu
larly scheduled tour times. In
terested people should call the
tour service to arrange a visit to
the ridge.
"We like the people to come
away with an educational exper
ience,"says Grundman,"so we
keep the tours down to the
people per group."
Six or seven gates provide en
trance into Jasper Ridge, and
specific instructions on how to
get there are provided when one
signs up for a tour. Without a
permit, no one is allowed on
Jasper Ridge apart from a tour.
For additional information,
Alan Grundman in room 211 of
the Biological Science Building
is eager to talk with anyone con
cerning this unique resource on
Stanford's doorstep.
