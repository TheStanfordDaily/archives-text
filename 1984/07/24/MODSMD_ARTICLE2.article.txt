# Stanford bursar to retire
## 
### LYDIA ROBINSON 
Since 1960, Joseph Jedd has
worked with students in finan
cial need, advising them on
credit payments and investigat
ing alumni who reneged on their
promises to pay.
Jedd will retire August 31 as
the University's bursar.
Although he has riot yet
reached the official retirement

age of 70, Jedd felt it was diffi
cult for him to keep up with all
the new changes in technology.
"I feel someone else should step
in and continue pushing Stan
ford to greatness," he said.
Every year Jedd gives out $5
million in loans to students.
Most loans are repayable after
six months when the student has
left the University and begun

work, but some evade their re
sponsibilities.
"I see many students with fi
nancial problems," he said. "I get
lots of opportunities to help
people. Students are inexperi
enced, they're not used to hand
ling money. But if someone
helps them, it can be good for
the university and the student."
During Jedd's 24 years as
bursar, the frequency of delin
quent loans dropped from 10
percent to 3 percent. Jedd's
strategy is simple — he listens to
people.
Letters to delinquents convey
his kindness and patience.
Through the years Jedd found
that "while one kind of letter
works for one person, the same
letter wouldn't work for an
other. But the best letter is writ
ten pretty much like I'd talk to
someone — the winning strat
egy is warm but businesslike,"
Jedd said.
More often than not, Jedd
receives letters of thanks for his
kindness. As he rifled through
his letter files, he read excerpts
like this one: "I will always be
grateful to you during those


Joseph Jedd
hard years. You're becoming an
old friend as we shuffle paper
back and forth across the con
tinent."
Jedd reminisced about an es
tablished doctor who didn't pay
his bill. "He marked up my let
ter and told me what was wrong
with it. I invited him out to
lunch and although we never
met, he paid the whole thing.
"I have had people say four
letter words at me and reach for
my throat, but I never recip
rocated their anger. I hid my
pride and did my best. Most
people know when they've of
fended you and come back to
apologize."
In September Jedd plans to

organize his papers and write his
memoirs, "not for publication
but my own use." He is cur
rently the president of the Palo
Alto Rotary Club and Stanford
Faculty Club. After his duties
end with these organizations,
Jedd plans to visit India and
study religious philosphies.
Jedd left after Poland was
invaded by Germany in 1939.
He served in the Polish and
French Armies, and later the
French underground, and was
awarded 14 decorations from
four governments.
He met his wife Maria Kar
pinska in England. They were
marrried in 1946.
In 1948, the Jedds emigrated
to Chicago where he secured a
job as an auditor for Sears,
Roebuck, and Co. for four
years.
The couple decided to uproot

again, sold what they had and
drove to California. Jedd then
began work as a food and bever
age controller for the Matson
Navigation Co. For three years
he traveled through the South
Pacific on ocean liners.
"I began to tire of my life on
the ships, it was like a luxurious
prison. It wasn't conducive to a
happily married life either,"
Jedd added.
Jedd began the search for an
other job. "I received three job
offers but decided to take the
accountant job at Stanford be
cause I wanted to help this uni
versity."
"When you get to be 65, you
tend to look back and try to fig
ure out what life is all about. At
least we spent our life giving to
some great cause; mine was
helping a great institution like
Stanford."
