# Stanford bursar to retire
## 
### LYDIA ROBINSON 
Since 1960, Joseph Jedd has
worked with students in finan
cial need, advising them on
credit payments and investigat
ing alumni who reneged on their
promises to pay.
Jedd will retire August 31 as
the University's bursar.
Although he has riot yet
reached the official retirement

age of 70, Jedd felt it was diffi
cult for him to keep up with all
the new changes in technology.
"I feel someone else should step
in and continue pushing Stan
ford to greatness," he said.
Every year Jedd gives out $5
million in loans to students.
Most loans are repayable after
six months when the student has
left the University and begun

work, but some evade their re
sponsibilities.
"I see many students with fi
nancial problems," he said. "I get
lots of opportunities to help
people. Students are inexperi
enced, they're not used to hand
ling money. But if someone
helps them, it can be good for
the university and the student."
During Jedd's 24 years as
bursar, the frequency of delin
quent loans dropped from 10
percent to 3 percent. Jedd's
strategy is simple — he listens to
people.
Letters to delinquents convey
his kindness and patience.
Through the years Jedd found
that "while one kind of letter
works for one person, the same
letter wouldn't work for an
other. But the best letter is writ
ten pretty much like I'd talk to
someone — the winning strat
egy is warm but businesslike,"
Jedd said.
More often than not, Jedd
receives letters of thanks for his
kindness. As he rifled through
his letter files, he read excerpts
like this one: "I will always be
grateful to you during those
