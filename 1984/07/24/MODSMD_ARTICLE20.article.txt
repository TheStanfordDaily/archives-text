## Pac-10 contract with CBS clears TV picture 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff With wire reports 
The question of who is going to be
televising Stanford football games was
cleared up last week when the Pacific 10
and Big Ten conferences signed an $8
million contract with CBS to televise 14
of the two conferences' games on 10 Sat
urdays.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said the exact schedule of games
has not yet been worked out. Geiger will
leave this morning for Chicago to meet
with representatives from other Pac-10
and Big Ten schools to iron out the
schedule, and also to discuss a cable tele
vision deal.
Geiger said the conferences were
talking with the ESPN network about
live broadcast rights in addition to the
CBS contract.

The Pac-10 also has a pact with the
Metrosports network that will allow
Metrosports to broadcast one or two se
lected Pac-10 games per week.
Metrosports will sell these broadcasts to
local stations in the Pac-10 region
through syndication.
Metrosports also has a similar arrange
ment with the Pac-10 in basketball. The
football contract is a three-year agree
ment.
Although the University is technically
allowed to sell television rights to its own
games since the Supreme Court threw
out the NCAA contract and permitted
colleges to negotiate their own deals,
Geiger said, "We will not make a local
television deal."
Stanford is committed to the
Metrosports contract for the next three
years, and Geiger expressed concern that
too much Stanford football on television

might have a negative effect on atten
dance at games.
Asked about the overall effect of the
new contracts on Stanford, Geiger
replied, "I think it's going to help us. Our
main problem will be overexposure."
This is a fear that many in college foot
ball have expressed since the Supreme
Court ruling. With network contracts,
cable contracts and syndication con
tracts, along with some schools negotiat
ing local contracts, there may be more
football on the air than viewers will
watch.
The ruling will also enable (JSC to ap
pear on television this year, Geiger said.
The Trojans had been barred from tele
vision appearances by the NCAA be
cause of recruiting violations. Geiger
added, however, "I think that there will
be additional penalties imposed."
Geiger hinted that the Trojans' proba

tion may be reinstated for next year. He
said it is likely that Arizona will serve out
its final year of probation this season to
free itself for appearing next season.
While allowing that Stanford might
move the starting time of a game to 4
p.m. — prime time in the Eastern time
zone — to accomodate an ESPN cable
broadcast, Geiger said the date and time
of Big Game with UC-Berkeley would
almost certainly not be changed.
The Chicago Tribune reported Friday
that with the lifting of USCs probation,
CBS will telecast the Ohio State-
Michigan and USC-UCLA games Nov.
17, which would mean that Big Game
would not be nationally televised.
During the weekend, the Associated
Press in New York reported that ABC
TV said Saturday it had reached an
agreement with the 63-member Col
lege Football Association, giving the
network exclusive rights to broadcast
games played by most of the major
football powers this season.
The agreement with the CFA calls
for 20 games to be televised between
Sept. 8 and Dec. 1, a total of 13
weeks.
Jim Spence, vice president in
charge of ABC Sports, said ABC also
had a "position" with the CFA that
presumably would give it the right to
extend the contract beyond this
season.
The contract with the CFA does
not permit any "crossover" games —
contests between CFA schools and
those from the Pac-10-Big Ten group
— to be shown on another network
during the late-afternoon time period.
Geiger said he thought such con
flicts would be decided by the home
team "as has always been the case in
college football", but Spence said
ABC has the right to negotiate sepa
rately for such games, such as the

traditional Notre Dame-Southern
California contest that has usually
been televised nationwide.
The price for the CFA package was
reported to be approximately $15
million, less than half the $34.5 mil
lion each network was paying the
NCAA for the rights to the contract
that was thrown out by the courts.
The CFA is composed of five major
conferences — Southeastern, South
west, Atlantic Coast, Big Eight and
Western Athletic — as well as major
independents such as Notre Dame,
Pitt, Penn State, Miami and Boston
College.
ABC's announcement finally
clarified the TV football picture after
two weeks of confusion following the
Supreme Court decision.
It means that in the television
"window" allocated to the networks
— from 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. Pacific
Time each Saturday — ABC will
televise CFA games.
There will also be two other televi
sion windows — from 9 a.m. until
12:30 p.m., when local stations may
carry games sold to them by individ
ual schools and conferences; and from
4 p.m. on, when college games can be
carried on cable television.

Although the University is technically
allowed to sell television rights to its own
games since the Supreme Court threw
out the NCAA contract and permitted
colleges to negotiate their own deals,
Geiger said, "We will not make a local
television deal."
Stanford is committed to the
Metrosports contract for the next three
years, and Geiger expressed concern that
too much Stanford football on television

might have a negative effect on atten
dance at games.
Asked about the overall effect of the
new contracts on Stanford, Geiger
replied, "I think it's going to help us. Our
main problem will be overexposure."
This is a fear that many in college foot
ball have expressed since the Supreme
Court ruling. With network contracts,
cable contracts and syndication con
tracts, along with some schools negotiat
ing local contracts, there may be more
football on the air than viewers will
watch.
The ruling will also enable (JSC to ap
pear on television this year, Geiger said.
The Trojans had been barred from tele
vision appearances by the NCAA be
cause of recruiting violations. Geiger
added, however, "I think that there will
be additional penalties imposed."
Geiger hinted that the Trojans' proba

tion may be reinstated for next year. He
said it is likely that Arizona will serve out
its final year of probation this season to
free itself for appearing next season.
While allowing that Stanford might
move the starting time of a game to 4
p.m. — prime time in the Eastern time
zone — to accomodate an ESPN cable
broadcast, Geiger said the date and time
of Big Game with UC-Berkeley would
almost certainly not be changed.
The Chicago Tribune reported Friday
that with the lifting of USCs probation,
CBS will telecast the Ohio State-
Michigan and USC-UCLA games Nov.
17, which would mean that Big Game
would not be nationally televised.
During the weekend, the Associated
Press in New York reported that ABC
TV said Saturday it had reached an
agreement with the 63-member Col
lege Football Association, giving the
network exclusive rights to broadcast
games played by most of the major
football powers this season.
The agreement with the CFA calls
for 20 games to be televised between
Sept. 8 and Dec. 1, a total of 13
weeks.
Jim Spence, vice president in
charge of ABC Sports, said ABC also
had a "position" with the CFA that
presumably would give it the right to
extend the contract beyond this
season.
The contract with the CFA does
not permit any "crossover" games —
contests between CFA schools and
those from the Pac-10-Big Ten group
— to be shown on another network
during the late-afternoon time period.
Geiger said he thought such con
flicts would be decided by the home
team "as has always been the case in
college football", but Spence said
ABC has the right to negotiate sepa
rately for such games, such as the

traditional Notre Dame-Southern
California contest that has usually
been televised nationwide.
The price for the CFA package was
reported to be approximately $15
million, less than half the $34.5 mil
lion each network was paying the
NCAA for the rights to the contract
that was thrown out by the courts.
The CFA is composed of five major
conferences — Southeastern, South
west, Atlantic Coast, Big Eight and
Western Athletic — as well as major
independents such as Notre Dame,
Pitt, Penn State, Miami and Boston
College.
ABC's announcement finally
clarified the TV football picture after
two weeks of confusion following the
Supreme Court decision.
It means that in the television
"window" allocated to the networks
— from 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. Pacific
Time each Saturday — ABC will
televise CFA games.
There will also be two other televi
sion windows — from 9 a.m. until
12:30 p.m., when local stations may
carry games sold to them by individ
ual schools and conferences; and from
4 p.m. on, when college games can be
carried on cable television.
