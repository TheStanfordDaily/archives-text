## Pac-10 contract with CBS clears TV picture 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff With wire reports 
The question of who is going to be
televising Stanford football games was
cleared up last week when the Pacific 10
and Big Ten conferences signed an $8
million contract with CBS to televise 14
of the two conferences' games on 10 Sat
urdays.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said the exact schedule of games
has not yet been worked out. Geiger will
leave this morning for Chicago to meet
with representatives from other Pac-10
and Big Ten schools to iron out the
schedule, and also to discuss a cable tele
vision deal.
Geiger said the conferences were
talking with the ESPN network about
live broadcast rights in addition to the
CBS contract.

The Pac-10 also has a pact with the
Metrosports network that will allow
Metrosports to broadcast one or two se
lected Pac-10 games per week.
Metrosports will sell these broadcasts to
local stations in the Pac-10 region
through syndication.
Metrosports also has a similar arrange
ment with the Pac-10 in basketball. The
football contract is a three-year agree
ment.
Although the University is technically
allowed to sell television rights to its own
games since the Supreme Court threw
out the NCAA contract and permitted
colleges to negotiate their own deals,
Geiger said, "We will not make a local
television deal."
Stanford is committed to the
Metrosports contract for the next three
years, and Geiger expressed concern that
too much Stanford football on television

might have a negative effect on atten
dance at games.
Asked about the overall effect of the
new contracts on Stanford, Geiger
replied, "I think it's going to help us. Our
main problem will be overexposure."
This is a fear that many in college foot
ball have expressed since the Supreme
Court ruling. With network contracts,
cable contracts and syndication con
tracts, along with some schools negotiat
ing local contracts, there may be more
football on the air than viewers will
watch.
The ruling will also enable (JSC to ap
pear on television this year, Geiger said.
The Trojans had been barred from tele
vision appearances by the NCAA be
cause of recruiting violations. Geiger
added, however, "I think that there will
be additional penalties imposed."
Geiger hinted that the Trojans' proba

tion may be reinstated for next year. He
said it is likely that Arizona will serve out
its final year of probation this season to
free itself for appearing next season.
While allowing that Stanford might
move the starting time of a game to 4
p.m. — prime time in the Eastern time
zone — to accomodate an ESPN cable
broadcast, Geiger said the date and time
of Big Game with UC-Berkeley would
almost certainly not be changed.
The Chicago Tribune reported Friday
that with the lifting of USCs probation,
CBS will telecast the Ohio State-
Michigan and USC-UCLA games Nov.
17, which would mean that Big Game
would not be nationally televised.
During the weekend, the Associated
Press in New York reported that ABC
TV said Saturday it had reached an
