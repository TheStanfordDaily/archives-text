# Palo Alto prepares to host Olympic soccer
## 
### VINCE LARKIN 
A colorful parade, Olympic athletes,
athletic demonstrations and some in
tense soccer highlighted pre-Olympic ac
tivites Sunday at Rinconada Park in Palo
Alto.
The event was sponsored by the Olym
pic Neighbor Committee and was de
signed to welcome the various interna
tional teams to the community. It was
also an attempt to engender enthusiasm
for the upcoming Olympic soccer
matches which begin Sunday at Stanford
Stadium.
A parade which included representa
tives of consulates from many of the
countries which will play in the Olympic
tournament kicked off the day at 11:30
a.m. Numerous flags added to the
pageantry of the day. The parade had a
police escort and an Air Force color
guard, and a decorated, old-fashioned
fire engine carried members of the U.S.
soccer team.
The official mascot of the 1984 Olym
pic Games, Sam, the Olympic Eagle, was
on hand. Sam shook hands and was a
popular subject for photographers.
The parade made its way down Em
barcadero from Town and Country Vil
lage. It arrived at Rinconada to the
sounds of the incomparable Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching Band.
Its repertoire included the Olympic
Hymm and the übiquitous "All Right
Now."
Other entertainment took on an inter
national flavor. This included Costa
Rican dancing, international food, and
the Brazilian music of the Escola De
Samba Band. Some local break dancers
and the Los Trancos Woods Marching
Band added spice to the activities.
Professional soccer was represented by
members of the San Jose Earthquakes
who gave demonstrations and sponsored

a "Kick to Win" contest for the kids.
The day, though, belonged to Olym
pians both past and present. Demonstra
tions of 11 Olympic events were spon
sored by the Northern California Olym
pians. These included swimming, diving,
synchronized swimming, gymnastics,
weightlifting, judo, wrestling, shooting,
rowing, track and field and yachting.
The University was represented in
many of the demonstrations. In wres
tling, Stanford coach Chris Harpel and
Stanford wrestler Jeff Hazard were on
hand. They gave demontrations with the
West German Wrestling Team. Stanford
Judo coach Willie Cahill also gave a
demonstration. He will be an assistant
coach for the U.S. team in Los Angeles.
Northern California Olympians Presi
dent Kim Carlisle described the purpose
of her organization, saying, "The pur
pose of our work is to help local athletes
achieve their competitive goals." Carlisle
was a member of the 1980 Olympic
swimming team and graduated from
Stanford last year.
The master of ceremonies for the
event was an Olympic gold medalist in
track and field, Dr. George Rhoden. A
former world record holder, he won two
gold medals for Jamaica in the 1952 Hel
sinki Games. He will be one of the four
Olympians from past Games who will
carry the Olympic flame into Stanford
Stadium for the start of the Olympic soc
cer competition Sunday.
Rhoden is enthusiastic about the com
munity involvement in the Olympic com
petition at Stanford. "To have such a fine
site for this event is wonderful," he said.
"A pillar of higher learning coupled with
the attraction of an international event
has the ability to bring many people of
different cultures together."
It was a day for the whole family. One
graduate student who brought his

children said he was impressed with the
festivities. "The kids really enjoyed it,"
he said. "I'm very happy to see
Dr. Rhoden because he's from the Carib
bean like I am."
The day included exhibitions in ul
timate frisbee and soccer. The national
champion ultimate frisbee team from
Stanford was featured, playing a local
Palo Alto team.
The soccer match of the day pitted the
Broadcast Media against Print Media in

a controversial game. The Broadcast
Media — led by Jeff Richmond of Chan
nel 11 and Lloyd LaCuesta of Channel 2
— defeated the Print Media, led by Bob
Heinen of the Palo Alto Weekly.
The game was not without contro
versy. The broadcast team used two
ringers from the Earthquakes, including
Tim Schulz, who scored three goals to
defeat the Print journalists 4-3, nearly
removing Daily sports editor and Print
goalie John Lis' head in the process.
