# A
						world where color and sex aren't important

Spending last week in the Bay
Area, one couldn't help but
notice that the Democratic
Party was having its convention
up in San Francisco. The local
papers, including this one, ran
pages and pages of convention
stories — one going so far as to

Not Just
a Game

run 144-point, bold-red-type,
make-your-eyes-hurt headlines
— and local newscasts ran so
much convention coverage that
they even — sacrilege of
sacrileges — pre-empted the
Tonight Show.
For some reason, though,
whenever I picked up a morning
paper, I always pulled out the
sports section and looked for a
Cleveland Indians' boxscore.
Talk about irrational. Thirty
miles up the road decisions were
being made that might have a
profound effect on this country
for the next four years, and I'm
trying to find out about a last
place ballclub that is going

nowhere.
I didn't get to watch much of
the convention, either, since I
work evenings. I missed Mario
Cuomo, I missed Jesse Jackson,
I missed Walter Mondale, and I
missed Geraldine Ferraro. I did
get around to reading the papers
though, getting to the conven
tion stories somewhere between
Ann Landers and Bloom
County.
And I noticed something
about those stories. They were
freely filled with terms such as
"woman," "black" and
"Hispanic". Ferraro is the
"woman" vice-presidential can
didate, Jackson is the "black*
presidential candidate, Henry
Cisneros is the "Hispanic"
mayor of San Antonio, Texas.
I realize it's about time that
these groups were involved in
our political system. White,
Protestant males of northern
European descent are not the
only people qualified to run this
country. America needs any
qualified people, regardless of
color, religion, sex or ethnic
background.
Somewhere in all this, it
seems sports are really not that
important. But look again.
When's the last time you saw

Manny Trillo called "Hispanic
second baseman" or Jeff
Leonard "black outfielder"?
Somehow, over the years, talent
has become the sole measure of
a player.
Granted it hasn't always been
this way. We all know about

Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby
and the others who broke the
"color barrier." That certainly
was not easy, and it took a great
deal of courage on their part to
begin to integrate baseball. But
it happened, and it happened
more than 35 years ago.
Somehow I look at Jackson, a

man who has never held elective
office, and wonder how some
one can say he is more qualified
to run this country than
Mondale. I look at Ferraro and
wonder, should Mondale be
elected and then become in
capacitated, if she is ready to be

President. It seems that color
and sex, respectively, are the
only reasons they enjoy the stat
ure they do.
In Cleveland a few years ago,
a federal judge implementing a
desegration plan for the city
schools instituted racial quotas
for extracurricular activities as

well, including high school
sports. He immediately drew
fire from all over the country
and quickly rescinded the order.
Imagine a basketball player
being told he cannot be on the
team because he is black and the
team must have two whites. It
doesn't happen. A player's abil
ity to contribute to the team is
the only criterion used. Which is
the way it should be.
Some day the criteria of sex,
race, ethnic backround and reli
gion will be irrelevent in decid
ing whether a man or woman is
qualified to hold political office.
Unfortunately, today this is not
the case. Hopefully, people like
Ferraro and Jackson have
helped bring us closer to that
day.
Somehow, I don't feel bad
about caring about the Indians.
They have white players, black
players and Hispanic players.
Whether or not these players
start depends solely on what is
best for the team. They prove
that race has absolutely no
bearing on how very bad a team
can be.
I hope that when the same is
true in politics, the Democrats
can select better candidates than
the Indians have players.
