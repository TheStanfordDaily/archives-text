## Used recordsâ€”a flexible source of income 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
While many people look at used record stores as
sources of inexpensive entertainment, others see them
as sources of income.
Used stores can't get their merchandise from
wholesalers, after all. They buy their wares from collec
tors, underpaid music critics, and from impoverished
students and other average folks who come in off the
street.
Just as the stores have widely varying sales policies,
they also diverge significantly on purchasing policies.
Some are more selective in terms of either record
condition or the market value of the music itself.
Others differ on the relative value they offer for cash
versus credit.
Many stores will offer higher prices for package deals
than for individual albums, but keep in mind that you
won't get any money for "Frampton Comes Alive," or
Pia Zadora's "Rock It Out" no matter how attractive
the other albums you offer are.
While investigating the local market, I assembled a
selection of 10 albums which I brought to stores for
pricing. The sample was eclectic, ranging from John
Coltrane to Prince, and from new albums in good con
dition to old discs more useful as frisbees than as music.
One album, a Portuguese version of Elvis Costello's
"My Aim Is True" with a green cover, provoked widely
varying responses. Some stores didn't notice it was im
ported, others offered a premium for it, and one
refused to buy it.
Only one of the albums, John Lennon's "Double
Fantasy," skips on my turntable, but only one of the
stores tested, World Records in Redwood City, de
tected the problem. Almost all of the stores rejected
other records because of poor condition, but none of
them detected the defect on "Double Fantasy," which
rendered the first song, "(Just Like) Starting Over,"
unlistenable.
The stores and their policies:
Chimaera Books and Records
327-1122
Chimaera charges a bit more than many used record
stores, but the other side of the story is that it is willing
to pay higher prices for records. Chimaera was willing
to buy only five of the ten albums that I brought in, but
it offered almost as much in credit for those five as its
Cowper Street competitor, Recycled Records, offered
for all ten.
My copy of Prince's "1999," for example, would

have fetched only $3 in credit at Recycled, but
Chimaera offered $5.25.
The prices Chimaera pays are pegged to the amount
it plans to charge when it sells the record. The store
pays 50 percent of resale value in cash, or 75 percent in
credit.
I sold several records to Chimaera a few months ago,
and the prices were all generous. They even gave me $2
for a 12" single I'd purchased for 25 cents at another
used store. Total amount offered for my sample:
$10.35 cash or $15.40 credit for five albums.

Used stores can't get their mer
chandise from wholesalers, after
all. They buy their wares from
collectors, underpaid music critics,
and from impoverished students
and other average folks who come
in off the street.

Coyote Record Exchange
941-8022
Charles Emerson, Coyote's owner, is a discriminat
ing buyer who knows the business inside and out and
can talk knowledgeably about a variety of arcane sub
jects.
For example, while some stores didn't notice my
Elvis Costello album was a Portuguese import and
others offered a premium for it, Emerson rejected it
outright because he said Portuguese pressings are in
ferior.
He only buys records in good to excellent condition,
but he sometimes makes exceptions to this policy for
older pressings, which are of higher quality and more
durable.
Total amount offered: $10 cash or $13 credit for five
albums.
Record Exchange
345-5945
This store is selective on types of music, but not on
quality of records. Its pricing policy is relatively infor
mal, and it offers high amounts of credit, but relatively
low amounts of cash. Record Exchange offered $8 cash
or $15 credit for seven albums, rejecting the three jazz
albums in the sample.
Recycle Books and Records

321-2846
Record buyer Mike Papuga is a devoted music fan
who lives in San Francisco and canvasses the stores
there in search of bargains. Papuga is in the Palo Alto
store only three days each week. He pays 50 percent of
the record's retail price in cash or 75 percent in credit.
Recycled Records
321-3806
Recycled was the only store that offered to buy all
ten of my albums, but the trade-in prices it offered per
album were toward the low end of the range.
The store pays up to $2 cash per disc and up to $3 for
imports. Recycled offered the best deal on my Elvis
Costello import ($3 or $3.60), but other stores made
better offers for most of the domestic albums.
Recycled is a good place to go if you want straight
cash instead of just credit, however. While most stores
offer only two-thirds in cash of what they'll give in
credit, Recycled gives five-sixths in cash.
Total amount offered: $14 cash or $16.80 credit for
10 albums.
Rod's Used Records & Tapes
571-0440
Not especially selective, Rod's offered $10.50 cash
or $14.50 credit for eight albums. When asked about
the two albums he rejected, the proprietor offered an
extra 60 cents for them.
Wessex Used Books & Records
321-1333
Wessex is liquidating its small stock of rock records
and now buys only jazz, classical and blues albums. Al
though most of its records are bought from collectors,
Wessex does purchase discs from people who come in
off the street. Assistant Manager Suzanne Flint said the
store offers 50 percent of what it will charge in cash or
75 percent in credit.
World Records
365-1237
The counterman here seemed friendly and
knowledgeable. He was the only buyer who spotted the
skip on my copy of "Double Fantasy."
World offered $10.50 cash for six albums, or $13.65
(30 percent more) in credit, and seemed to place a
premium on new albums, offering $3 for Prince's
"1999." All prices are negotiable. When I declined to
sell the Prince album, I was asked to name a higher
price.
