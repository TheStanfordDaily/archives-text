# 'Les Comperes'-wholesale sentimentality
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Francis Veber worked on the
screen adaptation of the Jean
Poiret play La Cage aux Folles,
and his new movie Les Com
peres (which he wrote and di
rected) is also a comic view of
the vicissitudes of parenting.
Anny Duperey (she was the
white-gowned beauty in Res
nais' Stavisky) plays a Parisian
woman whose teenage son has
disappeared, probably with the
daughter of a Nice hotelkeeper;
when she receives no satisfac
tion from the police, or from the
surly hotelier, and she feels that
her husband isn't aggressive
enough to carry out the investi
gation on his own, she calls up
an old flame (Gerard Depar
dieu), informs him that the boy
is his child, and enlists his aid.
He turns her down, so she tries
the same ruse on another old
lover (Pierre Richard), a would
be suicide who sees this bizarre
assignment as his re-entry into
the mainsteam of life and grabs
hold of it with both hands.
Meanwhile, the journalist has
reconsidered, and using a news
story about Mafia-backed
casinos in Nice as a pretext for

going there, he too begins track
ing down the wayward adoles
cent.

The setup of this comedy re
quires that almost everything in
it occur three times: We see how

Depardieu handles a reluctant
informant, then how Richard
copes with him, and then the
hoods in sharp pursuit of
Depardieu (whose exposes have
caused them considerable trou
ble in the past) move in, on the
assumption that all of Depar
dieu's activities connect up with
the story he's writing. Perhaps
I'm too impatient a viewer, but
the repetition wore me down in
the first half-hour of the film, so
by the time (three-quarters of
the way through) Veber obliged
us to watch three men step on
an unfortunate room service
waiter who unwittingly pre
sented an obstacle to them, I felt
as if I'd been force-fed Saturday
morning cartoons for 90
minutes. Wearying, too, is the
continual contrast between the
rugged, macho journalist and
the soft-hearted, liberal neu
rotic, who join forces before
very long (to keep them on the
chase, Duperey claims she
doesn't know which one really
fathered her son) and compete
for the teenager's affections
once they have managed to lo
cate him. And Pierre Richard,
who played the hero in the Tall
Blond Man with One Black
Shoe movies, can exhaust you
all by himself; he mugs so fero
ciously, and he works so hard at
being endearing, that at times

you simply close your eyes to
get a rest from his antics. (I
suspect he's an acquired taste,
like Red Skelton or the Danny
Kaye of the 1960s and '70s, and
he leaves my palate cold.)
What set me on edge during
Les Comperes, however, was its
wholesale sentimentality. Veber
has made one of those slightly
sickening reconciliation movies,
in which a runaway child learns
the value of parents, and the
adults learn how incomplete
their lives have been without the
joys of fatherhood. The new
sensitive American father, as
personified by Dustin Hoffman
in Kramer Kramer, Donald
Sutherland in Ordinary People,
A 1 Pacino in Author! Author,
etc., etc., has now migrated
across the Atlantic. No wonder
American distributors thought
fit to buy the rights to Les Com
peres â€” there isn't really any
thing French about it, except for
Anny Duperey's cavalier atti
tude toward her child's origins
and Gerard Depardieu (whose
presence grounds at least a few
moments of it in reality). But I
wouldn't say the picture
represents the noblest impulse
of American filmmakers. Les
Comperes is the sort of movie
that sticks to the heel of your
shoe.
