Washington — The economy spurted at a surpris
ingly strong 7.5 percent annual clip during the
second quarter of 1984, with inflation remaining un
der control, the government reported yesterday.
The White House called this "exceptionally good
news," but private economists predicted the contin
ued boom would lead to a bust, and stock prices
dropped amid investor fears that interest rates will
be driven higher. The Dow Industrials closed off
4.75 points after a double-digit dip through much of
the day.
The growth figure released by the Commerce De
partment for economic activity from April through
June was sharply higher than the preliminary esti
mate last month of 5.7 percent.
While the economy grew at twice the rate analysts
had predicted for the first half of the year, inflation
even declined somewhat in the spring, the govern
ment said.
As measured by an index tied to the GNP, prices
rose at an annual rate of 3.2 percent from April
through June, down from 4.4 percent in the first
three months of the year. The decrease was attrib
uted to a drop in food prices.
Consumer spending, a major component of sales,
increased at an annual rate of 6.9 percent in the
spring, compared to 4.6 percent from January
through March.
