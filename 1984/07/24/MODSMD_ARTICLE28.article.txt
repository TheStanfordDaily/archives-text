# Soviets reiterate offer

### 
Moscow — The Soviet Union yesterday publicly
challenged the Reagan administration to join a for
mal statement that would commit both sides to start
negotiations on a treaty banning antisatellite and an
tiballistic space missile systems.
The Soviet proposal was relayed through
diplomatic channels to Washington recently and was
made public yesterday by the government news
agency Tass.
It appeared to be a tactical effort to obtain an un
equivocal American acceptance of Moscow's pro
posal to begin the talks in Vienna in September and
Washington's acceptance of the statement's call for
a moratorium on the testing and deployment of
space weapons as soon as the talks begin.
(In Washington, White House press secretary
Larry Speakes said the administration was "pleased
that the Soviets have now responded to our sugges
tion that we work out the joint statement. We will
respond promptly in diplomatic channels."
(The United States has accepted the Soviet
proposals "without preconditions," Speakes said,
"and we look forward to beginning those talks in
September on the assumption that the Soviet Union
will also avoid preconditions.")
