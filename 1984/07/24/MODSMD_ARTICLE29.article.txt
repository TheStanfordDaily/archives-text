# Rosenkranz kidnap fails
## 
### 
Washington â€” Edith Rosenkranz, the wealthy
60-year-old bridge player abducted at gunpoint
from a Washington hotel last Thursday, spent most
of her two-day ordeal held in the back seat of a van,
blindfolded and under threat of possible death. She
was released unharmed near the Washington Monu
ment late Saturday.
Rosenkranz's abduction had been carefully plot
ted over several months by three men who knew
that she would be attending an international bridge
tournament here, authorities said.
And a top law enforcement official said the
scheme was allegedly masterminded by a 42-year
old Houston bridge player, identified as Glenn
Wright.
But the plot failed, police said, when Wright and
two other alleged accomplices were arrested follow
ing Rosenkranz's release and the recovery by auth
orities of a ransom reported to be $1 million, nearly

48 hours after she was seized at gunpoint in a garage
at the Sheraton Washington Hotel. Rosenkranz's
husband, George, is the multimillionaire founder of
Syntex Corp., a West Coast pharmaceutical com
pany; their three sons attended Stanford.
