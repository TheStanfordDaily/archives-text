# USW defends dues collection
## 
### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
Local 680 has asked that the
National Labor Relations Board
throw out charges levied last
week by Stanford lawyers,
which claimed that 680 was the
unlawful and covert recipient of
union dues from Feb. 1 to
March 30, according to United
Stanford Workers Counsel Jim
Eggleston.
"We have asked the board to
dismiss the charges, and we're
positive they will . . . these are
entirely frivolous charges," he
said. "It's just another effort to
confuse the issue."
Eggleston said the basis of the
Stanford charges, which his of
fice learned about July 13, is
that Stanford was operating
without a union during that time
period. "This is just not the
case," he said. "According to
the complaint filed by the
NLRB, Local 715 was the effec
tive bargaining unit for Stanford
workers from July of 1980 to

April of 1984. There was no
hiatus of non-representation
during this period — of course
dues were collected."
The University was dealing
with local 715, Eggleston said,
but Local 680 was acting in "a
representative capacity."
"It's entirely an internal
union matter," he said. "The
University can't object to what
staff we have ..."
According to Eggleston, the
charge that the University was
unaware that 680 was collecting
dues "intended for 715" is an
"absolute lie."
"The checks were endorsed
over to 680," he said. "How
could they not know?"
Last week, University Associ
ate Counsel Susan de Jongh-
Kearl said that instead of en
dorsing checks over to Local
680, Local 715 had cashed the
checks and then given 680 the
money, so that Stanford was un
aware that 680 was getting the
money. She acknowledged yes
terday that her office had just
gotten copies of checks that
were indeed endorsed over to
680, but that this was the first
she had heard of their existence.
Instead of proof that Stanford
was aware of the situation, she
said, the checks are a "serious
confession" on the part of 680.
"In early February, 680 asked
for direct payment of dues. The
University refused . . . 680 was
aware that we were disagreeable
to paying them dues; of course,
we had no idea that they were
doing this. It was certainly kept
secret from us." she said.
Not only was Stanford un

aware of the situation, de
Jongh-Kearl said, but, "there is
no proof that the employees
were informed."
The original issue — whether
or not 680 was, and is, a legal
representative of Stanford
workers — remains at the heart
of the Stanford complaint, de
Jongh-Kearl said. "We won't
know the answer to this until the
Sept. 17 NLRB hearing." she
added. According to the Uni
versity's position, no portions of
the complaint made against
Stanford by the NLRB can be
taken as findings or fact until
after the hearing. "Mr. Eggles
ton repeatedly cites findings
that are not findings . . she
said. "The material in a com
plaint is not the same as a fin
ding; a complaint doesn't con
tain any findings or facts of
law."
