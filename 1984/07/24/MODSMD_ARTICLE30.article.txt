### 
Washington Retired members of Congress are
drawing an average pension of $35,386 a year, with
138 former senators and representatives collecting
more now than they earned as lawmakers, the Na
tional Taxpayers Union said yesterday.
The congressional figure was nearly three times
the average $12,988 that the U.S. Census Bureau
says was earned from all sources in 1982 by Ameri
can men over age 65. Women over 65 drew an
average $7,435.
The NTU's study said pension benefits for 374
former congressmen totaled $13 million last year,
compared to the $36.8 million annual cost of
salaries for the 535 current members of Congress.
Democratic presidential nominee Walter
Mondale gets $32,616 a year for the 12 years he
represented Minnesota in the Senate. Two former
presidents, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, are earn
ing more in congressional pensions than they did in
Congress.
The largest yearly congressional stipend goes to
Carl Albert, the Oklahoma Democrat who served in
the House for 30 years and retired as its speaker in
1977 at a salary of $65,600 a year. Albert's $87,864
pension exceeds the present congressional pay level
of $72,600, the NTU said.
