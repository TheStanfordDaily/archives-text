## 
### 
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
Likud bloc and the opposition Labor Party were
running neck-and-neck yesterday in early returns
from Israel's general election. It appeared that nei
ther party would have an easy time fashioning a
majority coalition.
The clearest trend was away from both of the
major parties to an array of minor parties ranging
from the Communists to the far right-wing grouping
that follows U.S.-born firebrand Rabbi Meir
Kahane, who hopes to expel all non-Jews from Is
rael and the occupied territories. It appeared that
representatives of 13 minor parties would be joining
Likud and Labor in the next Knesset (Parliament),
which has 120 seats.
With about 54 percent of the vote counted early
today, Labor was leading in races for 46 seats
compared with 42 for Likud. At least 61 seats are
needed to form a government.
