# City Cable, Cable Co-op compete for P.A. contract
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
The Palo Alto City Council has
narrowed the list of possible cable televi
sion firms down to two and will make a
final decision in January, pending the
report of the Joint Cable Working
Group.
The Joint Cable Working Group con
sists of representatives from area com
munities who will be subject to the coun
cil's decision. Mary Lou Allen of Stan
ford's Instructional Television Network
will represent the University.
Cable Co-op and City Cable Partners
have both been chosen to negotiate final
contracts with the group and to present
the final drafts to the council for a deci
sion.
The process has already eliminated
proposals presented by Pacific Bell and
Marsh Media, but Bell has been asked to
undergo separate negotiations with the
cable companies concerning the con
struction of the system.
These separate offers could result in
Pacific Bell constructing the network and
then leasing it to whichever company

reaches the final contract.
"They have a great deal of expertise,"
explained William Zaner, Palo Alto city
manager. "They will talk with the two
companies to see if Pacific Bell and one,
or both, of the companies could hook up
together."
The resulting system should be
modern and future-oriented, according
to Zaner, and have features including in
teractive capability.
Allen will be the key to Stanford's role
in the decision process and the look of
the final system.
"The process will be to draft a fran
chise agreement," she said, " and then
submit it to the two cable companies. We
just started drafting it last week."
In the meantime, Pacific Bell finds it
self in the middle of a controversy con
cerning its construction proposal, filed
with the FCC before the decision was
made.
The California Cable Television Asso
ciation (CCTA) has insisted that Bell's
proposal be denied for five specific
reasons and a host of more general prin

ciples outlined in a document sent to the
FCC on July 2.
"Pacific filed an application under 214
to construct a system," explained Jerry
Yanowitz of CCTA. Section 214 of the
Communications Act of 1934 requires
cable companies to apply for permission
from the FCC to build a cable system.
"The application is still there," he
went on. "It still stands in order to build
a cable network. They have not amended
or withdrawn it (since Palo Alto rejected
their proposal)."
"We are acting on the assumption that
their plans to build a system are still in
effect."
"They claim that they already have a
franchise agreement," explained
Yanowitz, referring to Pacific Bell's
agreement to provide telephone commu
nications. "If that is so, then they are just
performing social graces by giving Palo
Alto the proposal."
"This is a precedent," he said of
CCTA's actions. "We don't usually have
advocacy on the local level. Only on the
state and national levels."

Richard Sargent of Pacific Bell told
the Daily that Bell will respond by the
end of the month.
"You need to be ahead when you are
in a regulatory environment," he ex
plained when asked why the application
was filed early.
He expects that one of the two com
panies will enter into an agreement with
Bell claiming that "the key ingredient is
the ability to handle future two-way data
services." He believes Bell's experience
here will help the cable companies.
The future system will include some of
these basic ingredients in any case, ac
cording to Zaner. Palo Alto submitted a
long list of what was expected in a future
cable system long ago, and some of the
features include 108 channels and an
interactive system able to work with a
future institutional network.
The FCC, already late with its accep
tance or rejection of the proposal, will
probably make a decision under CCTA
pressure next month. Zaner expects the
system to be under construction within
the year.
