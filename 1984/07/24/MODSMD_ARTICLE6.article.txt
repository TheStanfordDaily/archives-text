## Williams relinquishes Miss America crown 
### 
New York — Vanessa Williams,
smiling and composed, relinquished her
Miss America crown yesterday, saying
she wanted to spare the beauty pageant
"potential harm" and "deep division"
over the public furor ignited by the
sexually explicit photographs of her that
have appeared in Penthouse magazine.
"I am not a person who gives up when
the going gets rough — I am a fighter,"
she told a jammed news conference here.
But the publication of nude photographs
of herself in intimate poses with another
woman would make it "difficult" for her
to finish her reign as Miss America, she
said.
Williams, 21, the first black woman to
hold the title, said she had never agreed
to have the pictures published and did
not realize how explicit they were until
she saw them in the magazine.
Pageant officials in Atlantic City, N.J.,
on Friday had demanded Williams' resig
nation within 72 hours. The first Miss
America in the pageant's 63-year history
to be forced out, Williams met the
deadline yesterday afternoon but
declared herself "shocked and deeply
hurt" by the abrupt demand for her ab
dication.
After Williams resigned, the title was
transferred to Suzette Charles, Miss New
Jersey, the first runner-up when Wil
liams was selected last September.
Charles, who also is black, took the oath
as Miss America 1984 in a private cere
mony at pageant headquarters in Atlan
tic City and will wear the crown until her
successor is chosen Sept. 15.
Despite her resignation, Williams said
she remains a staunch supporter of the
Miss America pageant and"the opportu
nities it has provided to millions of aspir
ing young women."
Williams spoke calmly, in a firm voice,
and smiled while delivering her prepared
statement to a room crowded with more
than 200 reporters, photographers and a

number of her fans, who groaned and
yelled "no, no" when she said she was
relinquishing the crown.
Williams said she posed for the
pictures in the summer of 1982, when
she worked at a modeling agency after
her freshman year at college. She said
the photographer, Tom Chiapel, told her
the pictures would be shot in silhouette,
that neither she nor the other woman
would be recognized and that the
pictures would never be published.
Chiapel, the photographer, "directed
both of us to assume different poses,"
Williams noted. "Each pose was set up.
At no time was there any spontaneous or
ongoing activity between myself and the
other model."
Williams also said she had never con
sented to the publication or use of the
photographs "in any manner." She said
she could remember signing only an ap
plication to join a model registry, not a

release for the photos to be published.
After seeing the pictures for the first
time Sunday in a copy of Penthouse, "I
was enraged and I felt a deep sense of
embarrassment," Williams said. "It is
one thing to face up to a mistake that one
makes in youth. But it is almost totally
devastating to have to share it with the
American public and the world at large,
as both a human being and as Miss
America."
Robert Guccione, publisher of Pen
thouse, insisted that the magazine has a
release signed by Williams and authen
ticated by handwriting experts, legally
entitling it to reprint the pictures. "She
should remember, and I'm sure in her
heart she does remember that she signed
the release," Guccione said in an inter
view with The Associated Press. "This is
not the sort of thing a girl does every
day."
Guccione also said he was sorry Wil

liams resigned but does not feel his mag
azine is to blame. "I don't feel I'm re
sponsible," he said. "My obligation was
to my readers. This was an interesting bit
of highly newsworthy information and
photographs."
Attorneys for Penthouse said they
were threatened with a lawsuit by Wil
liams' lawyers during a heated meeting
here yesterday. But there was no con
firmation from her or her lawyers that
she is contemplating suing the magazine.
Williams could have defied the
pageant officials and insisted on keeping
her crown, possibly touching off a legal
battle. She said, however, that "the po
tential harm to the pageant and the deep
division that a bitter fight may cause has
convinced me that I must relinquish my
title."
She said, "It has never been and it is
not my desire in any way to injure the
Miss America title."
Watching from the audience was
Judith Keithley, the master of
ceremonies when Vanessa Williams won
the Miss New York title last year before
taking the Miss America crown. Keith
ley, Miss New York of 1972, said she at
tended the news conference "to support
and show love and affection" for
Vanessa Williams. "She is by far one of
the classiest Miss Americas we have had
in many years," said Keithley.
A group of six Williams supporters
marched in front of the Sheraton Center
Hotel, site of the news conference,
chanting "long live the queen" and "we
want Vanessa. Several of the group
carried signs with messages such as "Let
Those Without Sin Cast the First Stone,"
and "Vanessa, We Love You."
Copies of the issue of Penthouse with
the 10-page photo layout of Wjlliams
were sold out at newstands here and in
other cities almost immediately after
their delivery yesterday morning.

release signed by Williams and authen
ticated by handwriting experts, legally
entitling it to reprint the pictures. "She
should remember, and I'm sure in her
heart she does remember that she signed
the release," Guccione said in an inter
view with The Associated Press. "This is
not the sort of thing a girl does every
day."
Guccione also said he was sorry Wil

liams resigned but does not feel his mag
azine is to blame. "I don't feel I'm re
sponsible," he said. "My obligation was
to my readers. This was an interesting bit
of highly newsworthy information and
photographs."
Attorneys for Penthouse said they
were threatened with a lawsuit by Wil
liams' lawyers during a heated meeting
here yesterday. But there was no con
firmation from her or her lawyers that
she is contemplating suing the magazine.
Williams could have defied the
pageant officials and insisted on keeping
her crown, possibly touching off a legal
battle. She said, however, that "the po
tential harm to the pageant and the deep
division that a bitter fight may cause has
convinced me that I must relinquish my
title."
She said, "It has never been and it is
not my desire in any way to injure the
Miss America title."
Watching from the audience was
Judith Keithley, the master of
ceremonies when Vanessa Williams won
the Miss New York title last year before
taking the Miss America crown. Keith
ley, Miss New York of 1972, said she at
tended the news conference "to support
and show love and affection" for
Vanessa Williams. "She is by far one of
the classiest Miss Americas we have had
in many years," said Keithley.
A group of six Williams supporters
marched in front of the Sheraton Center
Hotel, site of the news conference,
chanting "long live the queen" and "we
want Vanessa. Several of the group
carried signs with messages such as "Let
Those Without Sin Cast the First Stone,"
and "Vanessa, We Love You."
Copies of the issue of Penthouse with
the 10-page photo layout of Wjlliams
were sold out at newstands here and in
other cities almost immediately after
their delivery yesterday morning.

Former Miss
America 1984,
Vanessa Wil
liams, left, gave
up her title to
runner-up Miss
New Jersey,
Suzette Charles,
yesterday after
Penthouse maga
zine published
nude photo
graphs of'
Williams in its
September issue.
New York — Vanessa Williams,
smiling and composed, relinquished her
Miss America crown yesterday, saying
she wanted to spare the beauty pageant
"potential harm" and "deep division"
over the public furor ignited by the
sexually explicit photographs of her that
have appeared in Penthouse magazine.
"I am not a person who gives up when
the going gets rough — I am a fighter,"
she told a jammed news conference here.
But the publication of nude photographs
of herself in intimate poses with another
woman would make it "difficult" for her
to finish her reign as Miss America, she
said.
Williams, 21, the first black woman to
hold the title, said she had never agreed
to have the pictures published and did
not realize how explicit they were until
she saw them in the magazine.
Pageant officials in Atlantic City, N.J.,
on Friday had demanded Williams' resig
nation within 72 hours. The first Miss
America in the pageant's 63-year history
to be forced out, Williams met the
deadline yesterday afternoon but
declared herself "shocked and deeply
hurt" by the abrupt demand for her ab
dication.
After Williams resigned, the title was
transferred to Suzette Charles, Miss New
Jersey, the first runner-up when Wil
liams was selected last September.
Charles, who also is black, took the oath
as Miss America 1984 in a private cere
mony at pageant headquarters in Atlan
tic City and will wear the crown until her
successor is chosen Sept. 15.
Despite her resignation, Williams said
she remains a staunch supporter of the
Miss America pageant and"the opportu
nities it has provided to millions of aspir
ing young women."
Williams spoke calmly, in a firm voice,
and smiled while delivering her prepared
statement to a room crowded with more
than 200 reporters, photographers and a

number of her fans, who groaned and
yelled "no, no" when she said she was
relinquishing the crown.
Williams said she posed for the
pictures in the summer of 1982, when
she worked at a modeling agency after
her freshman year at college. She said
the photographer, Tom Chiapel, told her
the pictures would be shot in silhouette,
that neither she nor the other woman
would be recognized and that the
pictures would never be published.
Chiapel, the photographer, "directed
both of us to assume different poses,"
Williams noted. "Each pose was set up.
At no time was there any spontaneous or
ongoing activity between myself and the
other model."
Williams also said she had never con
sented to the publication or use of the
photographs "in any manner." She said
she could remember signing only an ap
plication to join a model registry, not a

release for the photos to be published.
After seeing the pictures for the first
time Sunday in a copy of Penthouse, "I
was enraged and I felt a deep sense of
embarrassment," Williams said. "It is
one thing to face up to a mistake that one
makes in youth. But it is almost totally
devastating to have to share it with the
American public and the world at large,
as both a human being and as Miss
America."
Robert Guccione, publisher of Pen
thouse, insisted that the magazine has a
release signed by Williams and authen
ticated by handwriting experts, legally
entitling it to reprint the pictures. "She
should remember, and I'm sure in her
heart she does remember that she signed
the release," Guccione said in an inter
view with The Associated Press. "This is
not the sort of thing a girl does every
day."

liams resigned but does not feel his mag
