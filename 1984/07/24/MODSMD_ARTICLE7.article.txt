Romeoville, 111. (AP) — An
explosion rocked a Union Oil
Co. refinery yesterday evening,
killing at least eight people and
injuring 22 others as it knocked
out power, shattered windows
for miles and ignited a fire that
raged out of control, authorities
said.
Fifteen employees were mis
sing after the blast, the county
coroner said.
The 4 p.m. PDT blast at the
sprawling refinery that straddles
Romeoville and Lemont
knocked out a 138,000-volt
transmission tower and up to
10,000 homes in the area lost
power, according to a Common
wealth Edison spokesman.
Power was restored to nearly all
the homes within two hours, he
said.
Will County Coroner Robert
Tezak confirmed that eight
people were killed in the blast
and said he feared the death toll
could rise. He said 15
employees were unaccounted
for, but he did not know if any
of them were among the dead.
Four charred bodies were

lying near the entrance to the
plant, but rescue workers could
not reach them because of the
intense heat.
"We just can't get in there,"
said Tezak.
Twenty-one people were
injured — two of them critically,
officials at three hospitals said.
"We're about 15 miles away
here and we thought it was an
earthquake," said Sgt. Paul
Dixon of the Will County
sheriffs office in Joliet. "There
was a loud explosion with it, a
loud rumbling."
The explosion occurred in the
refinery's coke plant, said Step
hen Clancy, assistant fire chief
at Romeoville, a town of 15,000
people about 25 miles south
west of Chicago.
"To the best of our knowl
edge we felt one explosion,"
Clancy said. "But there could
have been two, one inside the
other."
The explosion blew out win
dows within a five-mile radius
and cracked building founda
tions, Dixon said.
