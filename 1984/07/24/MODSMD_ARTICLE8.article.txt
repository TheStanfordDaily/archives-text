# Poles wary of amnesty

Warsaw, Poland (AP) â€” A Solidarity leader,
one of hundreds of political prisoners granted am
nesty by the Communist government, says the
move was made only to woo Western nations into
easing economic sanctions.
Justice Ministry officials said the first of the 652
political prisoners covered by the amnesty bill
could be released yesterday and that all of those
eligible for freedom would be out of prison within
30 days. They said women and young people
would be among the first to leave prison.
An adviser to Cardinal Jozef Glemp, leader of
Poland's powerful Roman Catholic Church, said
the primate viewed the amnesty with "great satis
faction" but wrote a letter to Parliament express
ing certain reservations.
Other church sources, who like the adviser
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the church
indicated that authorities should allow the return
of free trade unions, in the style of Solidarity, and
reinstate those dismissed from jobs or schools for
political reasons.
One of those criticizing the amnesty was
Andrzej Gwiazda, one of the seven senior
Solidarity leaders freed under the amnesty. He
was given a three-day prison furlough Sunday to
visit his ailing 77-year-old mother in a hospital.
In a telephone interview, Gwiazda said authori
ties arrested some of the people in the crowd who
gathered to greet him outside his home in
Gdansk, the Baltic port where the outlawed labor
movement was born.
The amnesty, he said in the interview, "is a
gesture of conciliation, but not with us nor with

society, said the 49-year-old engineer."This am
nesty is only to get some dollars," he said, refer
ring to the possibility the West would ease sanc
tions.
The United States led other Western nations in
imposing the sanctions to protest Poland's
declaration of martial law in December 1981 to
suppress the Solidarity movement.
Parliament, which approved the amnesty in a
special session Saturday, also voted to free as
many as 35,000 common criminals, almost half
the nation's prison population, but not those held
in connection with acts of high treason, espionage
and sabotage.
Fifty-one of the political prisoners have already
been sentenced and the rest are awaiting trial.
A U.S. State Department statement called the
amnesty a "positive move" but added; "Lasting
political, economic and social stability in Poland
can only be achieved through genuine dialogue
between government and people."
Lech Walesa, who founded Solidarity as the So
viet bloc s only free trade union four years ago,
said that without independent labor movements,
the amnesty would be meaningless.
The news of the amnesty coincided with the
40th anniversary of the Communist takeover of
areas of Poland liberated from Nazi occupation by
the Soviet army during World War 11.
Among the Soviet bloc dignitaries at anniver
sary ceremonies was Soviet Premier Nikolai Tik
honov, the highest-ranking Kremlin leader to visit
Poland since the birth of Solidarity in August
1980.
