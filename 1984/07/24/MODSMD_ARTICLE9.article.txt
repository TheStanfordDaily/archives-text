# COMMENTARY
## Todd Pilch Official columnist of the 1984 Olympics 
### 
Enough is enough! Let us get rid of the
Olympics. They are overcommercialized
and overpoliticized, leaving one to
wonder whether the current Los Angeles
Olympics can even remotely resemble
the original Greek concept of an Olym
pic games. The political strife that casts a
shadow over these proceedings is finally
snuffing them out of existence. It is time
to rethink the objectives of the Olympic
games.
An important element that most fail to
understand is that the Olympics as they
now exist are merely a forum for
countries to show off their finest athletes,
as well as for the host country to show off
itselt. Many spectators and athletes were
upset at the U.S. boycott of the 1980
Olympics and feel the same way about
the Eastern bloc boycott of the '84
Games. A popular argument being trum
peted says,"The Olympics should be
separate from politics." Unfortunately,
however, this is an impossibility.
Athletes are not individuals at the
Olympics, but merely representatives of
their countries. They wear national
colors and listen to national anthems.
Countries are political entities, formed of
political constitutions and ideals. If A
equals Band B equals C, then A equals

C. The Olympics are thus undeniably
tied to politics.
As long as we root for a nation's best
athlete instead of the world's best ath
letes, politics are bound to the competi
tion. The Greeks designed the Olympics
as a forum for athletes, not countries.
How can we address these issues? Let
us create a permanent site for the Olym
pics (ending unduly lavish Olympiads)
and send the best athletes, regardless of
country. After an athlete wins an event
(in a generic uniform of course), give
him/her a wreath, and send them home.
No politics and no controversy. Keep the
countries out of it.
There can still be national heroes once
an athlete returns to his/her native
country, but save nationalism for home.
The national anthem bit is only interest
ing for the country whose anthem is
being played. Besides, I always get En
gland's anthem mixed up with Canada's.
Additionally, nations will not have to
spend idiotic amounts of money on train
ing facilities and coaches, because there
is no national pride at stake in a generic
Olympics.
Until these problems are addressed,
we can expect more of the foolishness
that surrounds the L.A. games, such as:

Hoopla, hoopla and more hoopla —
Why must the Olympics be an endeavor
where the host country tries to make
everything so lavish, yet always fails
miserably. One merely has to walk by
Branner Hall and take a gander at the
Olympic security uniforms — a strange
combination of khaki slacks, shirt and
"hot" royal blue berets. There is another
breed of Olympic uniform that is a crazy
blend of bright orange and green. Is
Levi's serious with this stuff?
Official everything of the Olympics —
Talk about overcommercializing an
event. This Olympics is a sad commen
tary on capitalism. We have the official
camera, film, snack food and rent-a-car.
What is next? How about the official
laxative — for athletes on the move.
Since everyone else is jumping on the
bandwagon, I might as well declare
myself the official columnist of the
Olympics. What a thrill!
Is it really necessary to have Sam the
Eagle (1984) or Misha the Bear (1980)?
This is another national treasure that
should be removed from the Olympics.
Professionalism — I am no expert on
this subject, but there seem to be in
herent problems with non-uniform rules
pertaining to amateur status. The Olym
pics have always stood for amateur com

petition, yet the top Olympic track stars
are building up healthy bank accounts
from endorsements. This is just an indi
rect way of becoming a professional.
Olympic followers are always pointing
out that Eastern bloc athletes are profes
sionals. Unfortunately this does not jus
tify the professional status of many
American athletes. The U.S. soccer team
is made up of many players from the
North American Soccer League. These
guys have professional contracts. Mean
while, Brian Oldfield, a member of the
short-lived professional track and field
circuit 10 years ago, is being denied
amateur status for the 1984 Olympics.
This clearly points out the inconsis
tencies in defining amateur status. The
whole business is a farce.
Either get rid of the Olympics or to
tally revamp them. There was a very long
layoff from the time the Greeks ended
the Olympic games to the start of the
modern Olympics in 1896. Perhaps now
is the time for another rest period. Given
the opportunity to redefine objectives,
the Olympics can once again return to
glory.
