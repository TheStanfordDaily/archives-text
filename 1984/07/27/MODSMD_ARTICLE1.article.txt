### VINCE LARKIN 
The day after the world watches the Opening
Ceremonies of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los
Angeles, Stanford will have its own Opening
Ceremonies with color and pageantry that prom-

ises to leave no one disappointed.
The Opening Ceremonies of
the 1984 Olympic Soccer Tourna-

ment at Stanford Stadium Sunday

evening promise to be the largest and most
colorful field show ever produced in Northern
California.

Director of Ceremonies Michael Olmstead
has gathered more than 1200 performers, in
cluding students representing 50 Northern Cali
fornia high schools. The sounds of dynamic vo
cal talent will be displayed by the 150-voice
Master Works Choir from San Mateo.
Northern California Olympians — an organi
zation of past Olympians who help Bay Area
athletes achieve their competitive goals — will
also be on hand.

Drill teams and dancers representing 15 Bay
Area high schools will perform various routines.
Skydivers will grace the stadium in different
formations.
In addition, the official mascot of the '84 Olym
pic Games, Sam the Olympic Eagle, will appear.

Athletes from the 16 nations participating in the
Olympic soccer tournament will march into the
stadium carrying placards and their national
colors — a smaller version of the parade of ath
letes that will take place in Los Angeles.
After the parade, fans in the 84,000-seat
stadium will watch the opening game of the Olym
pic Soccer competition as the United States faces
Costa Rica. The Opening Ceremonies start at 7

p.m. with the match slated for 7:45.

Olmstead has also assembled the largest bal
loon drop in Northern California, and a flock
of 2000 cloves will be released.
One of the highlights of the evening will be

the entrance of the Olympic Torch. The torch
will be carried into the stadium by a relay team
of former Olympians.
The flame that will be used to light the
cauldron here was delivered by the official
Olympic torch relay from Greece. The flame
has been stored here since July 16, when the
torch relay passed through Stanford on its way
to Los Angeles. The cauldron at Stanford stands

seven feet high above the stadium walls.
The San Mateo County Transit District
(SamTrans) has announced that it will provide

night on Maloney Field.
