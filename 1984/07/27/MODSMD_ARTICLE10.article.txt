# COMMENTARY
## Ed Gresser and George Chapman On the fringes of the Democratic Convention 
### 
To the eye of the television camera,
the Democratic Convention was a love
fest, a celebration of togetherness, party
unity and good feeling. But to those shut
outside, it was different — in the words
of one traffic policeman, "It's gone
beyond brutal out there." An assortment
of pathetic freaks, fringe candidates and
hawkers of buttons and Reagan voodoo
dolls sweated in the heat around heavily
guarded Moscone Center on Wednes
day, while inside, the delegates blithely
snored through documentaries about
Eleanor Roosevelt and speeches by
pasty-faced party hacks.
Perhaps the most succinct view of the
convention was expressed by two young
men lying in the shade of a flatbed truck
in the parking lot in front of the center.
One, dressed in vaguely punk costume,
stated that the convention was a "crock"
and that its only value was to provide
him with "a half-assed source of shade
(the truck)." The other, a hippie-type
wearing a bandana with a rose stuck
through it, was somewhat less cynical,
saying that he could support Jesse Jack
son, or possibly Mondale if Jackson sup
ported him. Their conversation then
moved to a man they could both support
wholeheartedly, a certain "Caesar," who
had given them three flags on the previ
ous day.
While our two sources could provide
no further information about "Caesar,"
there were a host of other candidates
who had been barred from Moscone
Center by the repressive tactics of the so
called "people's party," and who were
forced to wander the streets as abject
displays of political pauperism. One of
the more interesting of these was Hugh
Bagley, the man who would annex
Mexico. The addition of 28 states to the
South would provide us with "peace,

power, oil and employment, " he said —
an undeniably attractive platform.
But Bagley was no ill-mannered goon,
out to seize what he did not have. He has
talked to quite a few Mexicans, most of
whom agree with his ideas. His interview
subjects were apparently quite happy
with the idea of U.S. annexation of
Mexico, although he has found that the
Canadians are not nearly so amenable.
Bagley and his wife have been campaign
ing since January, having traveled the
entire primary route — from New
Hampshire to San Francisco — in
Bagley's red, white and blue pickup. This
unique conveyance is decorated with the
slogan "Bagley for President — Annex
Mexico," and has two American flags
flying from the roof. He has financed this
effort by the sale of "51-dollar bills" for
a dollar each. These prominently display
Bagley's picture and signature, along
with a picture of the new United States,
including Mexico, and the legend, "I
have more to offer than any other candi
date." An affable man, Bagley was un
dismayed by his current lack of support,
and plans to continue his campaign all
the way to the White House.
A candidate with marginally greater
support, but far more visible frustration,
is Lyndon Laßouche. This darling of the
lunatic fringe, whose major policy is to
rid the government of Soviet agents
(notably Henry Kissinger) encountered
severe setbacks at the convention. An
ex-Trotskyite, Laßouche now appears to
be an extreme right-winger, if his some
what amorphous ideology must be
labeled either "right" or "left."
Laßouche was unable to break through
the self-satisfied throes of unity that
swept over the delegates like some sort
of LSD-induced trance, because of the
backroom deals of that notorious tool of

organized crime, Charles Manatt. For his
own utterly inexplicable reasons, Manatt
refused to break the rules to allow
Laßouche to speak. The Laßouche staf
fers we met were undismayed by these
undemocratic tactics (which extended
even to a conspiracy to keep the button
sellers from satisfying the overwhelming
demand for Laßouche pins), claiming
that "we are history, they (the rest of the
Democrats) are only the footnotes." His
filmy-eyed fanatics stood for hours on
street corners, accusing Manatt of
"acting like King Canute" in his preven
tion of a Laßouche speech. The
Laßouche workers warned of
catastrophe overtaking the party; by
alienating the enormous bloc of
Laßouche supporters, they believe, the
party has effectively committed suicide.
The demise of the Democratic Party
could only give more power to the as
sorted gangs of freaks and weirdos in
habiting the outskirts of the convention.
The Hare Krishnas made interminable
circumnavigations of the Moscone Cen
ter, shaking their horrible tambourines
and passing out fliers claiming the body
"is a bag of skin that contains blood, pus,
bone, muscle, urine, fat and mucus," and
that "all these are abominable." Rain
bow Man, a familiar face and head from
Monday Night Football, stalked around
in his bizarre multicolored wig and "John
3:16" T-shirt, announcing that he has
become so omnipresent that "people
now subliminally see (him) under the
bed." A man with a hand-lettered "End
the War of Illusions" sign played the
bongos and droned out old Supremes
songs. Another maniac with a slightly
grown-out Mohawk carried a banner
proclaiming that "Jesus Was An Anar
chist." In a more touching spectacle, a
bearded man who walked from Van
couver to the convention as the

"Children's Delegate for Peace" sat for
lornly behind the Hare Krishna bench
with a peace scroll, hoping to find his
way inside.
Meanwhile, several blocks down the
street, business in the Tenderloin went
on as usual — much to the disappoint
ment of the three shop-owners we talked
to. At the Army-Navy surplus store on
Mission Street, the complaint was that
the delegates had virtually no time for
non-convention related activities. Unlike
previous conventioneers — the Lions
Convention was mentioned as an exam
ple — the Democratic delegates did not
take advantage of the opportunities af
forded for buying carbine belts, defective
parachutes, and camouflaged cigarette
packs. Down the street at the Golden
Gate Adult Book Store, the manager
agreed that the delegates had nowhere
near enough free time, citing reliable
local prostitutes as complaining that the
delegates "don't even have 15 minutes
off.'' Dvorson's Restaurant Supply,
somewhat closer to the convention cen
ter, also received little or no benefit from
the activities.
As afternoon faded into evening, we
repaired to a small bar by the waterfront,
peopled only by darkly glowering locals.
Gary Hart's pitiful swan song flickered
dimly on the TV, so we attempted to
strike up a conversation about what it all
meant. Unfortunately, they spoke only
Spanish, and as neither of us do, we soon
lapsed into a silence broken only by the
sound of America weeping. Hart dele
gate and Vowel Caucus member Marcel
lus Wauahdooah remained unavailable
for comment.
(Ed Gresser and Greg Chapman both
graduated in June. Gresser majored in
political science and Chapman was an
economics major.)

even to a conspiracy to keep the button
sellers from satisfying the overwhelming
demand for Laßouche pins), claiming
that "we are history, they (the rest of the
Democrats) are only the footnotes." His
filmy-eyed fanatics stood for hours on
street corners, accusing Manatt of
"acting like King Canute" in his preven
tion of a Laßouche speech. The
Laßouche workers warned of
catastrophe overtaking the party; by
alienating the enormous bloc of
Laßouche supporters, they believe, the
party has effectively committed suicide.
The demise of the Democratic Party
could only give more power to the as
sorted gangs of freaks and weirdos in
habiting the outskirts of the convention.
The Hare Krishnas made interminable
circumnavigations of the Moscone Cen
ter, shaking their horrible tambourines
and passing out fliers claiming the body
"is a bag of skin that contains blood, pus,
bone, muscle, urine, fat and mucus," and
that "all these are abominable." Rain
bow Man, a familiar face and head from
Monday Night Football, stalked around
in his bizarre multicolored wig and "John
3:16" T-shirt, announcing that he has
become so omnipresent that "people
now subliminally see (him) under the
bed." A man with a hand-lettered "End
the War of Illusions" sign played the
bongos and droned out old Supremes
songs. Another maniac with a slightly
grown-out Mohawk carried a banner
proclaiming that "Jesus Was An Anar
chist." In a more touching spectacle, a
bearded man who walked from Van
couver to the convention as the

"Children's Delegate for Peace" sat for
lornly behind the Hare Krishna bench
with a peace scroll, hoping to find his
way inside.
Meanwhile, several blocks down the
street, business in the Tenderloin went
on as usual — much to the disappoint
ment of the three shop-owners we talked
to. At the Army-Navy surplus store on
Mission Street, the complaint was that
the delegates had virtually no time for
non-convention related activities. Unlike
previous conventioneers — the Lions
Convention was mentioned as an exam
ple — the Democratic delegates did not
take advantage of the opportunities af
forded for buying carbine belts, defective
parachutes, and camouflaged cigarette
packs. Down the street at the Golden
Gate Adult Book Store, the manager
agreed that the delegates had nowhere
near enough free time, citing reliable
local prostitutes as complaining that the
delegates "don't even have 15 minutes
off.'' Dvorson's Restaurant Supply,
somewhat closer to the convention cen
ter, also received little or no benefit from
the activities.
As afternoon faded into evening, we
repaired to a small bar by the waterfront,
peopled only by darkly glowering locals.
Gary Hart's pitiful swan song flickered
dimly on the TV, so we attempted to
strike up a conversation about what it all
meant. Unfortunately, they spoke only
Spanish, and as neither of us do, we soon
lapsed into a silence broken only by the
sound of America weeping. Hart dele
gate and Vowel Caucus member Marcel
lus Wauahdooah remained unavailable
for comment.

To the eye of the television camera,
the Democratic Convention was a love
fest, a celebration of togetherness, party
unity and good feeling. But to those shut
outside, it was different — in the words
of one traffic policeman, "It's gone
beyond brutal out there." An assortment
of pathetic freaks, fringe candidates and
hawkers of buttons and Reagan voodoo
dolls sweated in the heat around heavily
guarded Moscone Center on Wednes
day, while inside, the delegates blithely
snored through documentaries about
Eleanor Roosevelt and speeches by
pasty-faced party hacks.
Perhaps the most succinct view of the
convention was expressed by two young
men lying in the shade of a flatbed truck
in the parking lot in front of the center.
One, dressed in vaguely punk costume,
stated that the convention was a "crock"
and that its only value was to provide
him with "a half-assed source of shade
(the truck)." The other, a hippie-type
wearing a bandana with a rose stuck
through it, was somewhat less cynical,
saying that he could support Jesse Jack
son, or possibly Mondale if Jackson sup
ported him. Their conversation then
moved to a man they could both support
wholeheartedly, a certain "Caesar," who
had given them three flags on the previ
ous day.
While our two sources could provide
no further information about "Caesar,"
there were a host of other candidates
who had been barred from Moscone
Center by the repressive tactics of the so
called "people's party," and who were
forced to wander the streets as abject
displays of political pauperism. One of
the more interesting of these was Hugh
Bagley, the man who would annex
Mexico. The addition of 28 states to the
South would provide us with "peace,

power, oil and employment, " he said —
an undeniably attractive platform.
But Bagley was no ill-mannered goon,
out to seize what he did not have. He has
talked to quite a few Mexicans, most of
whom agree with his ideas. His interview
subjects were apparently quite happy
with the idea of U.S. annexation of
Mexico, although he has found that the
Canadians are not nearly so amenable.
Bagley and his wife have been campaign
ing since January, having traveled the
entire primary route — from New
Hampshire to San Francisco — in
Bagley's red, white and blue pickup. This
unique conveyance is decorated with the
slogan "Bagley for President — Annex
Mexico," and has two American flags
flying from the roof. He has financed this
effort by the sale of "51-dollar bills" for
a dollar each. These prominently display
Bagley's picture and signature, along
with a picture of the new United States,
including Mexico, and the legend, "I
have more to offer than any other candi
date." An affable man, Bagley was un
dismayed by his current lack of support,
and plans to continue his campaign all
the way to the White House.
A candidate with marginally greater
support, but far more visible frustration,
is Lyndon Laßouche. This darling of the
lunatic fringe, whose major policy is to
rid the government of Soviet agents
(notably Henry Kissinger) encountered
severe setbacks at the convention. An
ex-Trotskyite, Laßouche now appears to
be an extreme right-winger, if his some
what amorphous ideology must be
labeled either "right" or "left."
Laßouche was unable to break through
the self-satisfied throes of unity that
swept over the delegates like some sort
of LSD-induced trance, because of the
backroom deals of that notorious tool of

organized crime, Charles Manatt. For his
own utterly inexplicable reasons, Manatt
refused to break the rules to allow
Laßouche to speak. The Laßouche staf
fers we met were undismayed by these
undemocratic tactics (which extended
even to a conspiracy to keep the button
sellers from satisfying the overwhelming
demand for Laßouche pins), claiming
that "we are history, they (the rest of the
Democrats) are only the footnotes." His
