## Italian sauces: a cooking and moral lesson 
### 
Next to the issues surround
ing nuclear disarmament, I
don't think there are any as
misunderstood as what are the
authentic ingredients in an Ital
ian tomato sauce. The sugges
tions that my seemingly closest
friends have put forward never
cease to amaze me.
For example, last Christmas I
caught someone who I consid
ered an old, close friend empty
ing a whole can of cinnamon
into his sauce. I probed why. He
could only offer that he thought
that was the way all sauces were

friendship made it through this
test, barely.
Putting the extreme case of
cinammon aside, what is the
conventional belief about
tomato sauce ingredients?

spices: usually so-called "Italian
herbs" and garlic. Let's consider

plants, typical of what grows in
grassy areas with Mediterranean
climates, like California. Most

notable of these is oregano, a
strong-scented, peppery
smelling bush with small leaves
coming off a straight stalk. It is a
vervian (of the family ber
beeaceae, as my dictionary
pedantically informs me.) You
may associate it with the small
green flakes that assault your
nostrils when you bite a piece of
pizza.
Garlic is a drug whose
popularity is growing by leaps
and bounds as it is being dis
covered by non-ethnic Ameri
can culture. What else can ex
plain why there will be four
hour backups this weekend on

the road to Gilroy as people
wait to get to the annual garlic
festival? As with any mind
altering substance for which cul
tural mores have not been es
tablished, garlic has various, of

ten contradictory effects
ascribed to it. Overuse has been
