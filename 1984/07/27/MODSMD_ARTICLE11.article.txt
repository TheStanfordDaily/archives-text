## Italian sauces: a cooking and moral lesson 
### 
Next to the issues surround
ing nuclear disarmament, I
don't think there are any as
misunderstood as what are the
authentic ingredients in an Ital
ian tomato sauce. The sugges
tions that my seemingly closest
friends have put forward never
cease to amaze me.
For example, last Christmas I
caught someone who I consid
ered an old, close friend empty
ing a whole can of cinnamon
into his sauce. I probed why. He
could only offer that he thought
that was the way all sauces were
made. He who has shared ex
perience and thought with me

through good and bad times,
how could he know me so well
and be so mistaken? Our
friendship made it through this
test, barely.
Putting the extreme case of
cinammon aside, what is the
conventional belief about
tomato sauce ingredients?
Tomatoes: yes, of course. Then
spices: usually so-called "Italian
herbs" and garlic. Let's consider
these individually.
Italian herbs are a mixture of
mint-related and "vervian"
plants, typical of what grows in
grassy areas with Mediterranean
climates, like California. Most

notable of these is oregano, a
strong-scented, peppery
smelling bush with small leaves
coming off a straight stalk. It is a
vervian (of the family ber
beeaceae, as my dictionary
pedantically informs me.) You
may associate it with the small
green flakes that assault your
nostrils when you bite a piece of
pizza.
Garlic is a drug whose
popularity is growing by leaps
and bounds as it is being dis
covered by non-ethnic Ameri
can culture. What else can ex
plain why there will be four
hour backups this weekend on

the road to Gilroy as people
wait to get to the annual garlic
festival? As with any mind
altering substance for which cul
tural mores have not been es
tablished, garlic has various, of

ten contradictory effects
ascribed to it. Overuse has been
indicated to bring on an ag
gressive New York cynical per

sonality and tendency to stroll in
late evening, offering serenades
from beneath open windows.
Both oregano and garlic are
prevalent in Italian cooking.
Perhaps a more descriptive way
of putting it is that many people
were initiated to Italian cooking
by the painful process of acquir
ing a taste for oregano and gar
lic. People expect to find both in
tomato sauce. Read the in
gredients of any jar of prepared
tomato sauce. You know, the
kind foisted upon you, the
young yuppie, by ads featuring a
smiling old man or woman who
can't finish a word without put
ting a vowel at the end. You'll
find both ingredients featured
prominently.
As nature follows art so does
popular opinion follow Madison
Avenue's. How many acquain
tances have I had who have
tried to ingratiate themselves
with me by boasting of the
quantity of garlic and "Italian
herbs" in their sauce! I worked
at a summer camp where the
cooks hailed from Eolia, Mo.
Every time they tested their
sauce, they increased the load of
garlic, hoping at some point I
would give a nod to its
"authenticity." In their final at
tempt they diced two heads
(mistaking them for cloves) of
raw garlic and added them to
the sauce as they warmed it. The

effect was equivalent to a
gastronomic "scorched earth"
policy.
Dear reader, let me save you
from such excesses by giving
you a recipe for tomato sauce. If

I'm not writing to
tell you the cor
rect way to cook
tomatoes, but
rather to make a
point about
stereotypes.

you intend to live with someone
of Italian background, you
might be wise to copy this over:
consider it a contribution to
your domestic bliss:
The ritual of a simple
marinara sauce begins by war
ming a few tablespoons of olive
oil in a pan. Add to this a finely
sliced onion and saute (gently
fry) until translucent. If you can
get sweet Videlian onions, use
them. The purpose of onions is
to sweeten the sauce. Add a ta
blespoon (at least) of basil,
before a large can of tomatoes
that you've broken up with your
fingers, then a small can of
tomato paste. Simmer this at
least twenty minutes, or until
the last guest arrives, which is
when you put the macaroni in
the water.

That's right — no garlic or
oregano! I have seen relatives
and friends in Italy repeat this
with many variations, but the
rules remain the same. Use as
much tomato as possible. That's
the purpose of canned
tomatoes, then tomato paste.
There are eight great tomatoes
in the large can, and eight more
in the itty-bitty one, more to
gether than in an entire jar of
tomato sauce. Bring out the
tomato's freshness with minty
basil and sweet onions, but save
the garlic and harsher spices for
the meat dish. You don't have
to take my word for it. Look it
up in The Joy of Cooking, if you
don't believe me.
Now you know. So what?
You'll eat better. In fact, now
you can have it both ways, the
sweet "Italian style," or the gar
licky "Italio-American" style. I
enjoy both. That's the aesthetic
side.
I'm not not writing to tell you
the correct way to cook
tomatoes, but rather to make a
point about stereotypes. The
point is that you can't apply
them without doing violence to
other people's intentions.
Recipes are like words.
"Tomato sauce" means some
thing to me. And you won't un
derstand what I mean if you
think you know what I mean
without listening to what I mean
. . . You know what I mean?
And you can't have this both
ways. It's either/or. Either you
cling to your beliefs dogmati
cally or stand apart from them

and recognize that they are con
jectures — tentative and free to
become something else as some
one reveals the plain fact to you.
You can't have it both ways.
Least of all with tomatoes.
Enough philosophizing. An
other example may make this
clearer. Within Italian society
the Tuscans have a reputation
for a gentle, artistic, and person
able culture; in short, being an
"Italian's Italian." Here's a Tus-

can sauce recipe different from
the marinara that I offer for
comparison:
Heat enough oil to cover the
bottom of a pan. Saute two
crushed cloves of garlic together
with a sprinkling of oregano.
Before the garlic has browned,
throw in (stand back!) a couple
ripe, sweet-quartered fresh
tomatoes. The tomatoes must
be sweet, like fresh peaches.
Fish out the remains of the gar
lic and serve.
The result is exquisite, but it
offers a dilemma: Doesn't this
violate all the rules about sauce
that I gave before?
Is this a good sauce? If you

accept it, you have completely
deconstructed sauce recipe
rules. Is there a right choice? Or
is this like the stories they gave
you to ponder in high school sex
education courses where the
point is that you have to make
up your own mind? Not quite.
What they didn't tell you was
that the choice depends on the
character of the individuals in
volved. Recall that the Tuscan's
character is impeccable in mat-

it a try.

ters of Italian culture. Obviously
there is no "Italian sauce" per
se, just people with differing
backgrounds and experiences
about what sauce means to
them.
Confused? If I tell you what
got me thinking about writing
this piece in the first place, it
may clear things up. These ideas
came together for me when a
few days ago a Tuscan recom
mended to me that I try flavor
ing my sauce with cinnamon.
And I'm going to give it a try.
