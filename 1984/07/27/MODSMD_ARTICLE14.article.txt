# Jasper Ridge suit settled
## 
### ELAINE WANG Daily staff 
After two-and-a-half years of haggling over
felled trees, a torn-down fence and charges of
trespassing, the case between Edward Mendell
and the University has been settled — Men
dell's insurance company will pay $5000 to
Stanford for trimming several blue oak trees
lining his property next to Jasper Ridge.
But except for the fact of the settlement, the
incidents of the period since Feb. 4, 1982, are
still murky to the public.
Jasper Ridge is the 1200-acre wilderness
area located on Stanford land in the foothills
west of Interstate 280. Used by generations of
Stanford biology faculty and students to study
California flora and fauna, it is a valuable and

much-protected reserve.
When Mendell climbed over the fence on
the preserve's border and pruned the branches
along his property, Stanford claimed he
trespassed and damaged Jasper Ridge prop
erty. Mendell doesn't deny this, but he claims
to have had permission from grounds manager
Herb Fong to trim the limbs.
Fong, however, maintains he did no such
thing; Stanford says he didn't have that kind of
authority
Jasper Ridge Administrative Director Alan
Grundmann said the situation began in Feb.
1981, when one of the oaks lining Mendell's

place was cut down. "We didn't contest that;
we chose not to make an issue of that one, but
we did choose to make an issue of the fence,"
he said, referring to the eight-foot fence — sur
rounding the preserve — which Stanford
charges Mendell with tearing down to five feet.
Mendell said the '81 oak-felling was due to
overhanging branches being snagged by a truck
and dragging the old tree down. It took down
the top part of the fence, too, he claims.
He added, "Just before we broke ground (to
build his house in 1980), Stanford workers
were on my property making an extension of
the fence — a flimsy attachment." He consid
ered this obstructive and illegal, because they
trespassed on his land, but at that time did
nothing about it.
A year later, Grundmann said, a class saw
Mendell sawing off 10-12 limbs from eight
blue oaks inside the preserve, near his property
line. "A blue oak divides and subdivides into
multiple trunks, so cutting off (one) 'fan'
means an uncounted number of other cut
tings," says Grundmann.
He also said that was when they found an
other tree trunk with black paint over the
stump and "piled debris around it so it wasn't
discovered at first."
Mendell said, "I cut down no trees . . . the
giant tree which toppled tore up the under
brush and maybe knocked down the smaller
tree. Workers cleaning up on the Stanford side
must have made the piles."
Mendell disclaims any fault for the felled
oaks, but admits that he did use black tar —
pruning seal — "as I trimmed the branches,
partially for aesthetics and partially for the
health of the tree ... I do it to my trees."
For his part, Mendell is angry about Stan
ford's activities during the dispute. He claims
Stanford conducted search parties on his place
when the University suspected the new wood
cuttings on his woodpile were from Jasper
Ridge trees. "They interrogated our 13-year
old daughter," he said, "How paranoid can
you get? We were trimming our own trees."
