# Osborne plugs 'Hypergrowth'

### LARRY BOSCHE 
The man who first
popularized the portable
computer told a group of 50
people at Kepler's Books
yesterday that the smaller,
trendsetting computer com
panies stand little chance of
survival against competition
from large computer com
panies.
In an effort to promote his
new book "Hypergrowth,"
Adam Osborne, the founder
of Osborne Computer Com
pany, talked about the cut
throat competition in the
computer industry.
Rather than lecturing the
audience, Osborne gave in
formal responses to ques

about 50 people who
crowded a small corner of
the bookstore. Speaking in a
British accent, he gave few
details of his new book and

company's first product, the
Osborne 1, was the first fully
portable computer designed
for the layman. In less than

established the reputation of
the company. Small enough
to be carried around like a
briefcase, the Osborne 1 was
soon a common sight under
airplane seats and in the laps
of passengers on other con
veyances. In 1981, the com
pany's annual sales were
$5.8 million and in 1982,
sales soared to $68.8 million.
Then in 1983, sales went
down and by September Os
borne had filed for bank

ruptcy after accumulating a
$4.5 million debt.
Since then, controversy
surrounding the company's
fall has been heated. In yes
terday's presentation, Os
borne attributed the
company's fall to the big
business nature of the com
puter industry.

IBM would catch up with the
