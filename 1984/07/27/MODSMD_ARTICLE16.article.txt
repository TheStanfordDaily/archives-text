# Osborne plugs 'Hypergrowth'
## 
### LARRY BOSCHE 
The man who first
popularized the portable
computer told a group of 50
people at Kepler's Books
yesterday that the smaller,
trendsetting computer com
panies stand little chance of
survival against competition
from large computer com
panies.
In an effort to promote his
new book "Hypergrowth,"
Adam Osborne, the founder
of Osborne Computer Com
pany, talked about the cut
throat competition in the
computer industry.
Rather than lecturing the
audience, Osborne gave in
formal responses to ques
tions from an audience of
about 50 people who
crowded a small corner of
the bookstore. Speaking in a
British accent, he gave few
details of his new book and
talked mostly about the com
puter industry. The question
and-answer session lasted 46
minutes.
Osborne piloted the first
computer company to mar
ket the portable computer on
a large scale and at an affor
dable price. He started the
company in 1981 with the
notion that people want to
use a computer for a number
of "basic functions." The
company's first product, the
Osborne 1, was the first fully
portable computer designed
for the layman. In less than
two years the Osborne 1 had

established the reputation of
the company. Small enough
to be carried around like a
briefcase, the Osborne 1 was
soon a common sight under
airplane seats and in the laps
of passengers on other con
veyances. In 1981, the com
pany's annual sales were
$5.8 million and in 1982,
sales soared to $68.8 million.
Then in 1983, sales went
down and by September Os
borne had filed for bank

ruptcy after accumulating a
$4.5 million debt.
Since then, controversy
surrounding the company's
fall has been heated. In yes
terday's presentation, Os
borne attributed the
company's fall to the big
business nature of the com
puter industry.
Even though he predicted
IBM would catch up with the

Osborne 1 and eventually force it out of
the market, Osborne said he was
surprised by how fast the huge con
glomerate acted. "1 did not accurately
judge the speed with which IBM would
catch up," said Osborne.
He used the current software industry
to illustrate the type of competition that
exists in the field. "You can't get any
money from software, not because of the
software; but because of a lack of an eco
nomic base." According to Osborne the
lack of an economic base is a problem
common to all small companies.
"The micro-computer business has
radically changed," said Osborne.
"Nowadays, the smaller computer com
panies have the option of finding a niche
or going into some other business."

But "finding a niche" has its own
problems. Eventually the larger compan
ies will catch up, he said. Osborne ex
plained the problem by means of
analogy. "Don't look at software," he
said, "look at pots and pans," he said. "If
you specialize in one type of pan eventu
ally you are doomed."
In a reference aimed at the smaller
computer companies, Osborne said,
"Most of the players can't make it be
cause the economic stack is against
them."
Despite Osborne's version of the col
lapse of his company, the media and his
creditors see his fall in a different light.
When the company went bankrupt,
creditors brought suit against him for
what they claimed were fraudulent and
misleading financial statements.
When asked about the litigation, Os
borne said he could not take it seriously.
"Some of the litigation brought against
Osborne is hilarious," he joked.
