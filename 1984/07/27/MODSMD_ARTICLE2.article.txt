# Gays, lesbians to protest Stanford Olympics

### BILL MARTIN 
The Coalition against Olympic
Homophobia will hold an informational
demonstration outside Stanford Stadium
Sunday before the opening ceremonies
of Olympic soccer at Stanford, scheduled
for 5 p.m.
Gerard Koskovich and Noel Han
rahan, members of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS), are
working together to organize the protest.
They emphasize that it will be a peaceful
protest and will not interfere with or in
dicate a boycott of the games.

Olympic homophobia refers specifi
cally to the lawsuit the United States
Olympic Committee brought against the
Gay Olympic Games in 1982 for using
the word "Olympic" in its title. The
USOC won the case, but the Games have
appealed the decision to a superior court.
The win wasn't enough for the USOC,
though, and they filed another suit this
year demanding that the Gay Games pay
their legal expenses for the two suits.
This last demand will turn into more
than a fight on principle for Game or
ganizers. The USOC employed three of

San Francisco's best firms in the case,
and legal fees surpassed $96,000.
According to Hanrahan, this could
jeopardize the future of the Gay Games,
presently planning a repeat performance
for 1986. The sponsoring San Francisco
Arts and Athletics Committee is barely
working in the black now, and an addi
tional $100,000 debt could be a death
blow.
"We're just trying to inform the public
of what they're doing," explained Han
rahan. "We want them to come to our
aid by writing letters and/or by support

ing the Gay Games."
According to Koskovich, the coalition
has distributed flyers in San Jose, San
Francisco, and all over the Peninsula.
The flyers read:
"For two years, the United States
Olympic committee has hounded the or
ganizers of the Gay Games, a San
Francisco-based quadrennial interna
tional athletic competition for lesbians,
gay men and our friends, because it was
originally billed as the "Gay Olympic
