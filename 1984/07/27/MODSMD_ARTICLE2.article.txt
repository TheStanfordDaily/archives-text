# Gays, lesbians to protest Stanford Olympics
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
The Coalition against Olympic
Homophobia will hold an informational
demonstration outside Stanford Stadium
Sunday before the opening ceremonies
of Olympic soccer at Stanford, scheduled
for 5 p.m.
Gerard Koskovich and Noel Han
rahan, members of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS), are
working together to organize the protest.
They emphasize that it will be a peaceful
protest and will not interfere with or in
dicate a boycott of the games.

Olympic homophobia refers specifi
cally to the lawsuit the United States
Olympic Committee brought against the
Gay Olympic Games in 1982 for using
the word "Olympic" in its title. The
USOC won the case, but the Games have
appealed the decision to a superior court.
The win wasn't enough for the USOC,
though, and they filed another suit this
year demanding that the Gay Games pay
their legal expenses for the two suits.
This last demand will turn into more
than a fight on principle for Game or
ganizers. The USOC employed three of

San Francisco's best firms in the case,
and legal fees surpassed $96,000.
According to Hanrahan, this could
jeopardize the future of the Gay Games,
presently planning a repeat performance
for 1986. The sponsoring San Francisco
Arts and Athletics Committee is barely
working in the black now, and an addi
tional $100,000 debt could be a death
blow.
"We're just trying to inform the public
of what they're doing," explained Han
rahan. "We want them to come to our
aid by writing letters and/or by support

ing the Gay Games."
According to Koskovich, the coalition
has distributed flyers in San Jose, San
Francisco, and all over the Peninsula.
The flyers read:
"For two years, the United States
Olympic committee has hounded the or
ganizers of the Gay Games, a San
Francisco-based quadrennial interna
tional athletic competition for lesbians,
gay men and our friends, because it was
originally billed as the "Gay Olympic
Games."
"Given the fact that the USOC has
never brought suit against any other of
the hundreds of non-profit organizations
using the term 'Olympic' to promote
their events, the court actions against the
Gay Games are unmistakable evidence
of homophobia."
Dr. Tom Waddell, a 1968 Olympian
and San Francisco physician, organized
the first Gay Games in San Francisco in
1982. By the opening ceremonies, 1300
participants had signed up from 22
countries in 15 events lasting eight days.
The spirit and emotions evoked by the
competition inspired the organizers to go
all out in planning the 1986 Games, but
the lawsuit has left somewhat of a sore
mark in the minds of many organizers.

"Gay Games II is more than just a
week of games," wrote Shawn Kell, a
chief organizer in an article for the New
York Native this week. "It uses the
medium of sports to alter the way society
at large sees lesbians and gay men and
the way gay people see themselves. The
Games try to present a new model of
what sports should be: A way to meet
each other, despite our differences, in a
spirit of friendly competition.
"The Games aspire to fight ageism
(through events for all ages), racism (we
have an extensive outreach program to
minorities), sexism (equal participation
has been an exemplary part of the
Games), and nationalism (nobody is
boycotting us!)," he wrote.
"We will be lining up with placards
and informational handouts," said Han
rahan. "We will be in front of the main
entrance and ticket windows."
