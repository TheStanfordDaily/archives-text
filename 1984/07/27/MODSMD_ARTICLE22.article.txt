# Questions to ponder on eve of Olympics
## 
### 
I'm convinced that the Olym
pics are an event dreaded by the
nation's trees and beloved by
the nation's paper producers.
The volume of articles, com
mentaries and sports editor
opinion pieces written on the

Not Just
a Game
John Lis

subject is, to grossly understate
it, large. It seems every newspa
per, magazine and
mimeographed office memo has
felt compelled to produce a spe
cial section, issue, feature or
three-volume, hardbound ency
clopedia on the Olympics.
Somewhere buried in this
mass of information, I keep
noticing articles on how the
Soviets and East Germans
would have killed us in Los An
geles if they hadn't felt corn

pelled to retaliate for 1980.
These writers warn us of the tre
mendous advantages the Eas
tern Bloc nations have over us
in such areas as diet, training
and psychology. They warn that
unless we try to copy these
methods, our athletes are
doomed to failure.
I'm really tempted to ask, "So
what?" Let's think about these
things for a moment. Why are
we supposed to have the Olym
pic Games? Just maybe for the
athletes?
Then why must we emulate
nations that use the Games for
political propaganda? Who
cares what country "wins" the
Games? It seems that the whole
situation has gotten slightly out
of hand.
We've heard the stories about
the Romanian gymnastics coach
who spotted little Nadia Com
eneci tumbling around with her
grade-school friends and how
Nadia was picked to live and
train at a special gymnastics
center. Hey, the girl was good
(remember, she was 14 when
she won her medals). But
should we copy their system be
cause it produces gold medals?
Somehow I have this ideal of

sports where you go out after
school and work your butt off in
practice for a couple of hours.
During the summer you run and

Do we need to feel
compelled to use
steroids, other
hormones and drugs
to compete?
If so / why? Are we
doing this out of
some great
philanthropic desire
to help our athletes
because we care
about them so
much, or do we just
want to 'beat the
Russians?'

lift weights to get in shape. If
you're really dedicated, you get
up early and practice before
school as well.

Do we need a psychologist to
tell a coach what to say before a
game? Do we need a diet expert
to regulate what an athlete eats?
Do we need to feel compelled to
use steroids, other hormones
and drugs to compete?
If so, why? Are we doing this
out of some great philanthropic
desire to help our athletes be
cause we care about them so
much, or do we just want to
"beat the Russians".
Remember 1980 at Lake
Placid? You betteY believe I had
tears in my eyes when the U.S.
hockey team knocked off the
Soviets, and I had a very large
lump in my throat when Mike
Eruzione sang the national an
them on that victory stand and
called the team up with him.
Those players worked their
butts off, and I'll take Coach
Herb Brooks for motivation
over any psychologist.
When we win that way, with
people who work hard to earn
victory, I love it. But if we start
cranking out robots whose only
mission is to win medals for the
glory of the American
propaganda machine, then I'll
begin to wonder if it's all worth
it.
