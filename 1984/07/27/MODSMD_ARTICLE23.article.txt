## 'Another Country' is polished, but sedate 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
"For those who like that sort
of thing," Miss Jean Brodie says
of The Girl Guides, "that is the
sort of thing they like" — and
that is roughly how I feel about
Another Country, Marek
Kanievska's film version of the
Julian Mitchell play about how
Guy Burgess (here named Guy
Bennett) came to be a famous
Soviet agent. It's an intelligent
piece of dramatic writing,
plausibly built on a well-made
play structure, with reasonably
rounded characters for the most
part; Mitchell has translated the
work to the screen gracefully,
and Kanievska has directed a
skilled cast in a clear, steady,
unhysterical fashion. Consider
ing the potentially sensationalist
nature of the material, which is
set at Eton (though the school is
never named) and deals with
homosexual relationships, one
can easily see the merit in this
thoughtful, modulated kind of
filmmaking. But I found
Another Country awfully sedate,
and though I was fairly ab
sorbed in the story, I was
unmoved by it. Perhaps if it
weren't all of a piece — if the
dialogue had some unresolved
tension instead of just polish
and an acceptable level of wit, if
Rupert Everett in the central
role or one of the supporting ac
tors had really broken through
with a performance of shatter
ing intensity — Kanievska's
restraint would be a greater
virtue. As it is, he appears to
hold in check what is already
self-controlled, placing the
movie in a double bind.
Mitchell and Kanievska em
ploy a framing device, an inter

view with the aging Bennett in
Moscow nearly 30 years after
his defection, that encloses a
revelatory flashback. The inter
viewer, an exhaustingly zealous
young American woman,
queries Bennett about his
motives for betraying his
country — "a man of your class
and background" — and the
film turns back to Eton in the
19305. (The title derives from a
line in a hymn the students sing
in chapel.) There Rupert
Everett loses the dreadful age
make-up that gives him a
vaguely extra-terrestrial look
and plays a schoolboy caught up
in the passion of his first
"committed" love affair with
another boy and in a (typically)
contradictory set of impulses:

He hates his school, rebels
against it in a thousand small
ways, yet dreams of becoming a
"god", i.e., a member of the
senior elite who for all intents
and purposes run the institution.
Another Country provides a
glimpse into the horrors, petty
and extreme, of life in a British
"public" school, and into its use
as a training ground for English
professional life. But mostly it is
a psychosexual explanation of a
man's political choices: Guy
Bennett elects to join another
society because the one he was
born into brands him for his
sexual preferences, denying him
the chance to join the upper ec
helon when he is caught arrang
ing a tryst with another boy.
Everett gives Bennett some

panache, only stooping to queen
it up in one or two places. (He's
at his worst in two scenes with
his mother, where his little-boy
pouting flashes old Freudian
signals at us about what made
Guy gay.) But though one can
imagine being persuaded by a
case study that one of the most
infamous Soviet agents in the
western world took his unusual
political course beause he never
got over a high school disap
pointment, as drama it's not
convincing — or at least, it's not
convincing in this picture.
Part of the problem is that,
even given the careful build of
Mitchell's narrative, Guy's fate
at the hands of a shrewd older
boy (Frederick Alexander) ap
pears disproportionate to his
behavior, even by conservative
boy's school standards. It's not
just that half the students at the
Eton of Another Country have
participated in homosexual ac
tivity on some level; Mitchell
distinguishes between the
"games" the boys play with
each other and Guy's convic
tion, arrived at when he falls in
love with a fair-haired young
man with an ingenuous face
(Cary Elves), that he will never
love women. And it's not just
that Harcourt, his inamorata, is
attractive in a conventional
manner and has no personality
to speak of (Cary Elves' terribly
earnest acting doesn't do any
thing to expand the limits of the
role), since greater intellectuals
than Bennett have probably
found bliss in the arms of even
less interesting partners. But the
love play between these two is
decidedly more romantic than

physical: They eat dinner at an
expensive restaurant and get
drunk, they spend hours out at
night in a rowboat in a chaste
embrace. Even the boy whose
expulsion and subsequent
suicide prepares the scene for
Guy's failure to ascend the Eton
ranks — the boy whom a
headmaster caught with another
student in a gym changing room
— seems, according to the
evidence of the film, guilty only
of some awkward, unspecified
and almost fully clothed activity
in a position that certainly
doesn't fit into either of the
usual categories of homosexual
congress. Either Kanievska is
trying to make a point about the
fatuousness of the prejudice
against gay schoolboy sex — a
prejudice especially ridiculous
because every alumnus of a
boys' school knows from experi
ence how rampant it is — or else
he is being bewilderingly coy
about the sex that goes on. Since
Bennett makes the point
repeatedly that he has engaged
in sexual intercourse with a
number of his fellow students, I
would say that Kanievska is
skirting the facts by showing us
only these tame embraces. And
though I may sound as if I'm
suggesting, after all, that I'd
prefer sensationalism to drama,
surely a movie audience in 1984
would not be shocked by a
stronger hint of passion in a film
that claims to deal with
homosexuality. If Another
Country gives off a slightly
musty odor, we can blame its in
sistence on remaining safely
within the restrictions of yester
day's theater and yesterday's
film.
