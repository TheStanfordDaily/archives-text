### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"Italy: The Places in Be
tween"
By Kate Simon
Revised and expanded ver
sion, Harper & Row, $9.95
paper, 384 pp., indexed.

Kate Simon's guide to some
of the less well-traveled cities of
Italy adopts the form of a book
of walks, presented as if one
could follow them like those in a
"Guide Michelm." But instead
of dry commentary and clear in

structions, Simon's text sounds
like a seasoned traveler's run
ning description of sights and
impressions to her blind and
deaf companion. Though I
wouldn't take this book along
with me, Simon recounts the or
dinary incidents of tourism ac
curately and sensitively; reading
it might stir pleasant memories
of your own trips, or alert you to
the nuances that need attention
if a hurried tour is not to
become monotonous and ex
hausting.
Though she observes every
and any sort of thing, Simon
writes as if she travels in a style
beyond the comprehension of
most tourists under 30, who
probably went through Europe
during or shortly after their col
lege years. I was not amused by
her remark that the best way to
arrive in Orvieto "is by helicop
ter, possibly borrowed by a
Milanese magnate friend."
Though I assume this was meant
as a spirited fancy, it brought
into greater prominence the fre
quent advice about taxis,
porters, and higher-priced
hotels. Though the youth
hostel/backpacking route can
often be as numbing as any
package tour, and seems indis
tinguishable from a giant pub
crawl for many young travelers,
I wish someone would write a
descriptive guidebook like
Simon's from that perspective;
it seems truer to the experience
of most Americans these days.
But these objections are
based on comparisons of my
own experiences against what
Simon's format suggests are ex
periences possible for any
visitor. Once you accept the

book as an account of her own
walks, the felicity of her descrip
tions allows you to identify with
her impressions and enjoy the
places she has visited in the
same way she did.
Simon is thorough in her
coverage, and in Ferrara she
made a point of going to the
university's old anatomy
theater. Tourists are given a
typewritten English description
to consult as they look, and are
encouraged to correct it. "Since
no one can resist being an
editor, the sheet may by now
have undergone sufficient
changes to make it more garbled
than the original version."
Though someone else's descrip
tion may not be informative or
in agreement with your own,
those same divergences may
suggest new ways of seeing that
you might otherwise neglect.
That is especially true when the
other's account is accented with
an observant affection like Kate
Simon's.
"Bartleby in Manhattan and
Other Essays"
By Elizabeth Hardwick
Vintage Books, $6.95 paper,
291 pp.
What I found most surprising
about the essays and reviews
collected in Elizabeth
Hardwick's new book was the
range of publication dates. The
inclusion of pieces from a long
span of time is the strength of
this collection. However good
the individual articles in books
like this may be, they often
seem monotonous and uniform.
The author or his publishers

turn out a new collection as
soon as there are enough pieces
on hand, so the product covers a
short period of time in which the
same'preoccupations and topics
keep returning. Hardwick's
book includes some reviews that
are recent enough to be recalled
from The New York Times
Book Review, but several date
from a time before I could read.
Harwick is knowledgeable
and intelligent, and her reviews
are consistently interesting, but
the quality of the recent ones is
not so striking as that of the
older work. Her pieces on
"Gimme Shelter" and "Trash,"
on the Warren report's descrip
tion of Oswald, and on the
marches immediately following
the assasination of Martin Lut
her King pick out themes and
draw conclusions that retrospect
shows to have been unusually
observant. The style, detached
and undramatic, does not ad
vertise the keen mind behind
