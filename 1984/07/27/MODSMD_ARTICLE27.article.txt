## Florentine surprise on Castro Street 
### 
Florentine Restaurant
118 Castro Street
Mountain View
%1-6543
Walking along the main drag in Mountain View, the
human animal in a hungry state can hardly resist the
aromas of oriental cooking. To Stanford people, Castro
Street is synonymous with stir-fried veggies and bean
cake, so its understandable that many infrequent
visitors to downtown Mountain View have come to ex
pect little else there. That kind of thinking is a mistake.
Nestled amid the string of oriental restaurants on
Castro Street lies a delight from another continent. Past
the dragons and other Far Eastern ornamentation, the
Florentine Restaurant is easy to spot, with its bright
red-and-white checkered curtains on the windows. But
the real surprise lies inside.
Because there are two completely separate dining
rooms for smokers and non-smokers, the smoker need
not face the snarls of the non-smoker, and the non
smoker need not be assaulted by any smells except
those from the kitchen. If only every restaurant were
that way!
You may be put off initially by the noise of the place.
No, obnoxious music is not piped in, and no, the
kitchen help and servers don't beat on pots and yell
across the room, but yes, the place can bustle with
people having a good time and, though the rooms are
unusually large, the tables are tightly spaced, making
for a constant din you would not expect in a more ele
gant setting.
However, once you settle into the festive mood of the
place and once the food begins to arrive at your table,
your hearing recesses into the background and your
sense of taste takes over.
Food is what makes a restaurant and food is what
makes the Florentine. The menu may overwhelm you
at first. Five categories of dinners are offered, with veal
and seafood dishes predominating. Entrees arc served
with soups or salad, pasta, vegetable and coffee. While
prices ranged from $8.25 to $10.45, most of the dinners
were approximately $9.
Served with all meals is a fresh, warm, soft and moist
pizza bread, a white fluffy loaf lightly toasted with the
delicate taste of dill and parsley, cut into finger sticks
and quite addicting.
Our entrees came with green beans that were truly
exquisite, lightly seasoned and garnished with almond

slivers, as fresh and firm and tasty as any I have eaten in
a restaurant. Corkscrew macaroni, aiso prepared al
dente and seasoned lightly, complemented our main
dishes.
The veal scallopini ($8.95) should not be confused
with Mike's veal scallopini ($9.65), which includes not
only mushroom slices but a sherry wine and lemon
sauce as well. The higher-priced dish proved to be an
excellent choice: My fear whenever I order veal scal
lopini, that the veal might be dry or tough, was van
quished with my first tender forkful. The thick and
ample sauce was equally exceptional: Once I had
devoured the veal, the large supply of pizza bread made
a great sponge for leftover sauce.
The eggplant parmigiana ($8.25) came heavily
capped with a thick tomato sauce and cheese. Although
a tad too watery and soft for my taste, my companion
had no complaints other than a desire for more of it.
For the price, I agreed that the servings could have
been a bit larger. We regretted not having ordered an
antipasto ($6) or an appetizer (nine possibilities ran
ging from $4.30 for deep-fried ravioli or tortellini to
$6.50 for shrimp cocktail).
The dinner salad was standard fare, nothing to write
home to Mama about, but the minestrone soup was un
usual — hearty, with a heavy, almost overwhelming
taste of beans, and not as spicy as most minestrones.
Other interesting items on the dinner menu included
veal florentine saute ($8.95), made with artichoke
hearts, olives and mushrooms; veal cutlets; prawns
Florentine ($9.75), made with mushrooms and lemon
sauce; and a couple of squid and clam dishes.
In addition to full dinners, the menu included a score
of pasta a la carte dishes, which could be ordered as a
dinner for $2 extra. These ranged from $4.85 to $8.50,
with most in the $6 range.
The Florentine Restaurant prides itself on its ravioli,
made fresh daily at its own Florentine Pasta Factory in
Saratoga. You can get the ravioli with meat sauce
($6.45) or alfredo ($5.50). I tasted the former and can
understand the restaurant's pride in its handiwork.
Stuffed with veal and spinach, the meal is topped with a
massive tomato sauce and served with two Italian
cheese, ricotta and parmesan. The restaurant claims all
its food is prepared fresh daily in its kitchen and that no
preservatives or additives are used.
I also sampled another a la carte dish, the seafood
cannelloni ($6.45), served in a creamy white sauce and

covered with cheese. Made with whole shrimp and crab
meat, it tasted wonderful and, to my mind, deserves a
more prestigious name than "seafood cannelloni."
Nearly a dozen types of appetizers, four salads and a
handful of side orders (mostly meatballs and sausages)
can make the ordering process an arduous one.
The restaurant's wine list is as impressive as its din
ner menu, though a bit too predictable for my taste.
The choicer Italian imports were admirable, but among
the domestics, the list was top-heavy with the larger
California wineries. I would have liked to have seen a
surprising entry or two from some of the smaller, excel
lent Napa and Sonoma wineries.
Some of the wines were available by the glass and
half-bottle, as well as full bottle, another practice
worthy of praise. Prices were reasonable, with many
half-bottles in the $5 range and full bottles in the $9
range. We chose the "wine special of the month,"
Granduca Barbera d'Asti, $1.75 per glass, $8.50 per
bottle. We weren't disappointed.
Beer ranged from $1 to $1.50. Aperitifs were a bit
higher — Dubonnet red or blanc was $1.50, for in
stance, and a champagne cordial was $2.
In addition to the usual array of beverages, the res
taurant offers some stylish coffees and desserts. Of
course, there's plain cappuccino and espresso, but have
you ever tried cafe borgia — espresso made with
steamed chocolate, whipped cream and orange peel?
Some of the more interesting desserts included a coffee
ice cream and espresso concoction called cafe
florentine (1.95); Sicilian cannoli ($1.75); mud pie
($1.75), and caramel custard ($1.50).
The Florentine Restaurant is open every weekday 11
a.m. to 10 p.m. and on weekends from 4 p.m. to 11
p.m. in summer and 10 p.m. in winter. The restaurant
also makes pizza and other food to go. Childrens' plates
are also available.
Because of its large size, reservations usually are not
essential, but for larger parties and during premium
hours you might consider reserving a table.
For a good, honest Italian meal, check this place out.
You're almost sure to find something you like on the
menu and, while it will cost you more than Wilbur Hall
or McDonald's, the memory of an exceptional meal will
stick to you r ribs. As the menu says, "Enjoy and Buon
Appetito!"
