When first asked to review the Gypsy
Cellar. 1 was looking forward to it with a
great deal of enthusiasm. It is a "Central
European" restaurant, meaning
Rumanian, Hungarian, Czechoslovakiar
and Viennese, and I am married to both
a Hungarian and his cuisine. We went or
a Tuesday evening.
On entrance, my first impression was
that this is a fun place. Looking bigger on
the inside than from outside, it is
decorated like a gypsy tent with fabric
arching from a peaked ceiling. There is
live music provided by a violinist and
pianist, with nice, embroidered vests.
One side of the room is dominated by a
large and very complete bar. A large
party was sitting around a table, obvi
ously having a jolly time.
We were a party of four and had a
chance to try a large sampling of the of
ferings. We started with the wine list.
Besides two Hungarian and three
Rumanian labels, there was a modest se
lection of California wines. We ordered a
Badacsonyi Szurkebarat, a solid Hun
garian white, priced reasonably. I would
recommend it.
We tried two of the three appetizers —
the chicken liver pate and the steak
tartare. The latter comes pre-mixed,
which I consider a pity, with only the
anchovy paste on the side, should you
care to add it. It was quite well spiced.
The chicken liver was not a pate, but
rather chopped and sort of bland.
All the entrees come as full dinners,
with soup or salad. Prices range from
$9.95 to $16.95. The eight or nine main
dishes all have very ethnic-sounding
names. We all had the goufash soup

rather than cream of mushroom. It was
the right choice: It looked, as well as
tasted, authentic and excellent.
We ordered four main courses. Saslik

It is a place to go with a
group for a few drinks,
and perhaps appetizers or
desserts (stick to the
tortes). Looking back, that
is what the party in prog
ress when we got there
was doing.

Enesco is a shish-kebab, named after a
Rumanian composer. Bohemian pork
chops come with onions, caraway and
braised cabbage. The segediner goulash
is a beef and sauerkraut dish with sour
cream, a Hungarian favorite. Finally the
Juliska paprikas chicken probably needs
no introduction. (That threatening first
word is just Hungarian for Julie.) All the
entrees came with a choice of spaetzl or
Bohemian dumplings. Spaetzl is a
homemade egg noodle, which can be ex
quisite. The dumplings were new to us,
they looked rather like English muffins.
This is the end of the good news. The
bad news is that none of the entrees lived
up to the soup, or even the appetizers.
Perhaps the soup was too good; we all
expected a lot of the entrees as well.
Alas, they failed us.
The saslik had been marinated in
vinegar, and was still sour enough to
pucker your mouth. The pork chops

were overcooked to the point of shrivel
ing, and either the meat or the sauce had
a distinctly unpleasant flavor. The bed of
cabbage they were served on was quite
tasty, however. The segediner beef
sauerkraut was a mystery. The meat was
quite fine, the sauerkraut had a
pronounced and unacceptable aftertaste.
Considering that they are to be cooked
together for a long time, this is difficult
to understand. Of the four entrees, the
chicken was the best. It was bland and in
a white sauce that clearly had little or no
paprika in it, despite the name. It was the
only dish that was not actually un
palatable.
Two of us had spaetzl and found it was
in keeping with the rest of the cuisine:

not be. The dumplings, on the other
hand, looked rather large and heavy, but
weren't. They were surprisingly good.
The waitress asked with concern,
clearing our unfinished plates, whether
all was well. We chatted with her and
found that the violinist, just then launch

ing into a spirited waltz from a Strauss
operetta, is the owner and comes from
Prague. The chef is his New Zealander
wife.
The waitress brought a platter of cakes
and tarts to show us a sampling of
desserts. The display looked very good.
We ordered a Sachertorte (a Viennese
chocolate cake), a Dobosch torte
(Hungarian many-layered cream torte)
and Palacinka (dessert crepes) with
cottage cheese filling. We passed them
all around so each could have a taste of
everything. The Sachertorte was the
best, a fine, very chocolaty cake. The
Dobosch was all right, the Palacinka was
inedible. No more than the first bite
could be consumed. The waitress took
the remains, looking quite alarmed. She
was back a minute later saying that she
checked the crepes and agreed they
tasted like soap and she would not
charge us for it. I thought she put her
finger right on it.
The check came to $91 for the four of
us, including the two bottles of wine and
tax. Certainly very high, considering the
quality of the food.
We left the Gypsy Cellar feeling that
the ambience of the place is very pleas
ant, friendly and good-natured. It is a
place to go with a group for a few drinks,
and perhaps appetizers or desserts (stick
to the tortes). Looking back, that is what
the party in progress when we got there
was doing. They never ordered food,
only drinks, beer and snacks. A second
party, arriving later, also obviously
European, did the same.
If you are in the mood for a place to
sing along and exchange jokes with the
musicians or the bartender, the Gypsy
Cellar might well be it, but I am afraid,
not for the food. Unless, of course, the
chef had a particularly difficult day last
Tuesday . ..

great deal of enthusiasm. It is a "Central
European" restaurant, meaning
Rumanian, Hungarian, Czechoslovakiar
and Viennese, and I am married to both
a Hungarian and his cuisine. We went or
a Tuesday evening.
On entrance, my first impression was
that this is a fun place. Looking bigger on
the inside than from outside, it is
decorated like a gypsy tent with fabric
arching from a peaked ceiling. There is
live music provided by a violinist and
pianist, with nice, embroidered vests.
One side of the room is dominated by a
large and very complete bar. A large
party was sitting around a table, obvi
ously having a jolly time.
We were a party of four and had a
chance to try a large sampling of the of
ferings. We started with the wine list.
Besides two Hungarian and three
Rumanian labels, there was a modest se
lection of California wines. We ordered a
Badacsonyi Szurkebarat, a solid Hun
garian white, priced reasonably. I would
recommend it.
We tried two of the three appetizers —
the chicken liver pate and the steak
tartare. The latter comes pre-mixed,
which I consider a pity, with only the
anchovy paste on the side, should you
care to add it. It was quite well spiced.
The chicken liver was not a pate, but
rather chopped and sort of bland.
All the entrees come as full dinners,
with soup or salad. Prices range from
$9.95 to $16.95. The eight or nine main
dishes all have very ethnic-sounding
names. We all had the goufash soup

rather than cream of mushroom. It was
the right choice: It looked, as well as
tasted, authentic and excellent.
We ordered four main courses. Saslik

It is a place to go with a
group for a few drinks,
and perhaps appetizers or
desserts (stick to the
tortes). Looking back, that
is what the party in prog
ress when we got there
was doing.

Enesco is a shish-kebab, named after a
Rumanian composer. Bohemian pork
chops come with onions, caraway and
braised cabbage. The segediner goulash
is a beef and sauerkraut dish with sour
cream, a Hungarian favorite. Finally the
Juliska paprikas chicken probably needs
no introduction. (That threatening first
word is just Hungarian for Julie.) All the
entrees came with a choice of spaetzl or
Bohemian dumplings. Spaetzl is a
homemade egg noodle, which can be ex
quisite. The dumplings were new to us,
they looked rather like English muffins.
This is the end of the good news. The
bad news is that none of the entrees lived
up to the soup, or even the appetizers.
Perhaps the soup was too good; we all
expected a lot of the entrees as well.
Alas, they failed us.
The saslik had been marinated in
vinegar, and was still sour enough to
pucker your mouth. The pork chops

were overcooked to the point of shrivel
ing, and either the meat or the sauce had
a distinctly unpleasant flavor. The bed of
cabbage they were served on was quite
tasty, however. The segediner beef
sauerkraut was a mystery. The meat was
quite fine, the sauerkraut had a
pronounced and unacceptable aftertaste.
Considering that they are to be cooked
together for a long time, this is difficult
to understand. Of the four entrees, the
chicken was the best. It was bland and in
a white sauce that clearly had little or no
paprika in it, despite the name. It was the
only dish that was not actually un
palatable.
Two of us had spaetzl and found it was
in keeping with the rest of the cuisine:
rather unsavory and badly cooked. It was
doughy and sticky, everything it should

not be. The dumplings, on the other
hand, looked rather large and heavy, but
weren't. They were surprisingly good.
The waitress asked with concern,
clearing our unfinished plates, whether
all was well. We chatted with her and
found that the violinist, just then launch

ing into a spirited waltz from a Strauss
operetta, is the owner and comes from
Prague. The chef is his New Zealander
wife.
The waitress brought a platter of cakes
and tarts to show us a sampling of
desserts. The display looked very good.
We ordered a Sachertorte (a Viennese
chocolate cake), a Dobosch torte
(Hungarian many-layered cream torte)
and Palacinka (dessert crepes) with
cottage cheese filling. We passed them
all around so each could have a taste of
everything. The Sachertorte was the
best, a fine, very chocolaty cake. The
Dobosch was all right, the Palacinka was
inedible. No more than the first bite
could be consumed. The waitress took
the remains, looking quite alarmed. She
was back a minute later saying that she
checked the crepes and agreed they
tasted like soap and she would not
charge us for it. I thought she put her
finger right on it.
The check came to $91 for the four of
us, including the two bottles of wine and
tax. Certainly very high, considering the
quality of the food.
We left the Gypsy Cellar feeling that
the ambience of the place is very pleas
ant, friendly and good-natured. It is a
place to go with a group for a few drinks,
and perhaps appetizers or desserts (stick
to the tortes). Looking back, that is what
the party in progress when we got there
was doing. They never ordered food,
only drinks, beer and snacks. A second
party, arriving later, also obviously
European, did the same.
If you are in the mood for a place to
sing along and exchange jokes with the
musicians or the bartender, the Gypsy
Cellar might well be it, but I am afraid,
not for the food. Unless, of course, the
chef had a particularly difficult day last
Tuesday . ..
