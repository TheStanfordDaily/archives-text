# CINEMA SCOPE
## 
### 
Apocalypse Now (1979)
Memorial Auditorium
Francis Ford Coppola's ver
sion of //earf of Darkness, set in
the jungles of Vietnam. Vittorio
Storaro shot the film in Conrad's
colors — deep greens with a
heavy white mist — and the
sound recording, designed by
Walter Murch and executed in
Dolby stereo, is awesome; the
best sequences are surreal,
nightmarish. Unfortunately,
during the three years of shoot
ing Coppola must have lost his
hold on his ideas. The movie
lacks focus, and its hero, Capt.
Willard (inexpressively played
by Martin Sheen), is such a
zombie from the beginning that
there's nowhere for him to go.
Kurtz is played by Marlon
Brando, who reads "The Hollow
Men" aloud and gives an opaque
performance. If crazy Lt.
Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who
bombs islands so he can surf off
them, had been used as the sym
bol for this war rather than
Kurtz, the movie might have
made more sense. However, the
helicopter attack sequence is
worth seeing th£ movie for: It is
just about the best war footage
ever put on film.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.
The Trial (1963)
Cubberley Auditorium
Franz Kafka's famous novel
was an odd choice for Orson
Welles to film, and his movie has
a number of dreadful mistakes in
it (like an inappropriate jazz
score). But it's fascinating, too:
Shot against a bleak, post-T.S.
Eliot landscape of concrete
apartment buildings and rows of
lampposts piercing a foggy gray
sky, it's full of visual coups and
scenes that don't quite work but
are intriguing anyway. In the
best sequence, Anthony Perkins
runs through corridors illumi
nated by bars of light thrown in
through chinks in the walls.
Perkins gives Joseph K. too
many nervous tics, but by the
middle of the film his perfor
mance begins to make some
sense. The real stars are Welles'
camera and Edmond Rich
mond's lighting. Welles turns up
in person as the Advocate (it's
not one of his better perfor
mances), as do Jeanne Moreau,
Elsa Martinelli, Romy Schneider
and Akim Tamiroff.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Awful Truth (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
This comedy about divorce is
one of the funniest films of the
Depression years, though it isn't
often revived. Cary Grant and
Irene Dunne, whose shrillness
has been toned down by the
director, Leo McCarey, play the
quarreling couple, and Ralph
Bellamy (who first appears sing
ing "Home on the Range" to
himself) and Cecil Cunningham
play the second fiddles. Dunne's
costumes are terrific, especially
the hat she wears in court.(It
resembles a crushed vase.) Vina
Delmar's screenplay, based on
an Arthur Richman play, has a
beautiful, symmetrical structure.
Plays through Wednesday
with Holiday.
The Yearling (1946)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Parts of this extraordinary
children's film, adapted by Paul
Osborn from the Marjorie Kin
nan Rawlings novel and directed
by Clarence Brown, are reminis
cent of The Wizard of Oz (the
phantasmagorical tone), parts of
the 1940 Thief of Baghdad (the
rich storybook color), and parts
of Our Town (the stylized set
pieces, especially the death and
funeral of the neighbor child);
some scenes, shot with a red fil
ter, look astonishingly like
woodcuts. But the movie has a
sensibility all its own, and se
quences in it are utterly unlike
anything seen in any film before

The Black Stallion. (Carroll Bal
lard must have known the scene
in which the boy hero, Jody, runs
through the forest with his pet
fawn, Flag, and deer leap all
around them — a woodland bal
let.) Jane Wyman gives an un
conventionally sensitive
performance as Jody's practical,
earth-bound mother, and the
cast also benefits from the pres
ence of Margaret Wycherly,
Chill Wills, and Donn Gift as
Jody's crippled companion, Fod
derwing. (Their scenes together
are among the movie's high
points.) Unfortunately, if you've
seen Rip Torn and Dana Hill
play the real-life characters
Rawlings based Penny Baxter
and his son Jody on in Cross
Creek, you can't help but feel
some disappointment at the way
Gregory Peck and Claude Jar
man, Jr. perform the crucial
scene in which Baxter tells Jody
he has to shoot his pet.
Photographed by Charles Ros
her and Leonard Smith.
Plays tomorrow, Sunday,
Wednesday and Thursday.
Nosferatu the Vampyre
(1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In making his version of
Dracula, Werner Herzog was in
spired by Murnau's 1922 classic
Nosferatu. Herzog's imagery
echoes Murnau's and in some in
stances expands on it — as in the
creepy sequence where the
streets of Bremen fill up with
coffins. Klaus Kinski gives a fas
cinating performance as the
vampire; the scene in which he
stays all night with Lucy (eerily
beautiful Isabelle Adjani) may
be the most unusual piece of
erotica in the history of movies.
Lumpy and unevenly acted as it
is (Bruno Ganz makes a vacant
Jonathan Harker), this film con
tains flashes of brilliance.
Plays Tuesday with Aguirre,
the Wrath of God.
Heart Like a Wheel (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Friedman's script about
Shirley Muldowney, the only
driver ever to win the National
Hot Rod Association World
Championship three times, has
clarity, narrative logic and even
polish, and the director, Jonat
han Kaplan, demonstrates intel
ligence and an unfussy control of
the actors and the material. The
cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto,
has given the film a clean, classi
cally small-town American look,
and the major emotional
encounters are staged shrewdly
and economically. But the
filmmakers show a worse
deficiency than sloppy
craftsmanship or histrionic ex
cessiveness; They have ordinary
eyes. They take a predictable,
non-exploratory approach to
their subject, and Bonnie
Bedelia's competent but un
imaginative performance in the
central role doesn't help. The
warm, big-old-bear presences of
Beau Bridges (as Shirley's
partner/lover Connie Kalitta)
and Hoyt Axton (in a much-too
brief bit as Shirlev's father Tex

Roque) dominate the movie.
Plays Tuesday with Silkwood.
El Topo (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Alexandro Jodorowsky made
this heavily symbol-laden im
agist fable in Mexico, and it had
some success as a head film
when it was released in this
country. Amid all the other
garishly violent pictures in 1971
(Straw Dogs, Dirty Harry, A
Clockwork Orange, The Cow
boys, Polanski's Macbeth), the
stoned audiences barely regis
tered the carnage, the lakes of
blood, etc., that Jodorowsky of
fered for their delectation. It's a
deeply offensive movie, though,
and it lacks any genuine visual
poetry or invention or power —
without the interminable footage
of human and animal corpses
there would be no movie at all.
(The dead animals are real; the
SPCA has no branches in
Mexico.) Jodorowsky stars as
the mystical hero.
Plays Monday with The Holy
Mountain.
Holiday (1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
This was the second film ver
sion of Philip Barry's hit comedy
of the late 19205; the first, in
1930, starred Ann Harding,
Robert Ames and Mary Astor.
This one, directed by George
Cukor, features Cary Grant as
Johnny Case, who wants ad
venture, and Katharine Hepburn
as Linda Seton, the rebellious
kid sister of Johnny's stuffy fian
cee (Doris Nolan) — and it may
well be the warmest of all the
comedies of this epoch. Donald
Ogden Stewart's screenplay im
proved on the elegant stage
dialogue, and although one
keeps wondering how Grant
could ever have settled on Doris
Nolan, even for an instant (it's
the central question — the flaw
— of most comedies in this
genre), the rest of the acting is
superlative. Lew Ayres, as Hep
burn's i icoholic brother, prob
ably never got to be this sensitive
and touching again, and Edward
Everett Horton and Jean Dixon
are grand as Grant's best friends.
Grant is wonderful, and as for
Katharine Hepburn, she sur
passes one's greatest expecta
tions. Has any American actress
ever given a more complex and
affecting comic performance?
Plays through Wednesday
with The Awful Truth.
Never Cry Wolf (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Full of glorious footage, Car
roll Ballard's second commercial
film is nonetheless a disappoint
ment. Perhaps if the Farley
Mowat book that was its source
— the report of a man sent by
the Canadian government to
confirm the widely held belief
that wolves are causing the
gradual elimination of caribou in
the far north — had provided a
more compelling story, the
movie would have a sense of
movement, of urgency. As it is,
the picture as a whole seems
peculiarly passive. It has a

strange, arbitrary quality, as if
no one had devised a strategy for
linking its generally magnificent
scenes. It's a wonderful collec
tion of observations without a
point. (Even Mowat's obvious,
ironic message — that men, not
wolves, are responsible for the
devastation of the caribou —
hasn't made it into the final
print.) With Charles Martin
Smith, miscast as the hero,
Tyler, and two amazing-looking
Inuit actors, Zachary It
timangnaq and Samson Jorah.
Put together by half a dozen
writers (credited), and shot, su
perbly, by Hiro Narita.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Grey Fox.
Entre Nous (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Diane Kurys made this solidly
bourgeois comedy-drama about
a bond between two women,
Lena (Isabelle Huppert, in a
proficient, nicely detailed and
unexciting performance) and
Madeleine (Miou-Miou, whose
acting is enclosed and
restrained). The prospect of a
film about women in a relation
ship told from a woman's point
of view is a promising one, but
Kurys can't manage to shake her
ties to the Hollywood of the big
studio era or transcend her
situation-comedy sensibility.
The two protagonists talk about
sex, they admire each other's
breasts, they even share a bed at
one point — but in each case
Kurys cuts away before we have
an opportunity to see any sen
sual stirrings in either of them.
Kurys wants us to understand
how close two women can be,
yet she never indicates what
might make them close, and she
shuts off the one dramatic possi
bility she has to provide an ex
planation. Written by Kurys and
Alain Le Henry; with Guy Mar
chand and Jean-Pierre Bacri as
the women's husbands.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with The Woman Next
Door.
The Woman Next Door
(1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A pair of former lovers
(Gerard Depardieu and Fanny
Ardant), both now married,
resume their former passion
when fate moves her to a house
next door to his. It's Noel
Coward's Private Lives with an
extra comic-romantic kicker:
These two are so completely
engrossed in their desire for each
other that they destroy them
selves with it. Francois Truf
faut's film keeps threatening to
turn into a first-rate treatise on
romantic love (like his Story of
Adele H.), but the dialogue (by
Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman
and Jean Aurel) is frustratingly
earth-bound, and the direction
rarely moves far beyond
banality. Fanny Ardant's unus
ual looks hold the camera, and
so does the intensity of her act
ing, which is full of high spots
and yet never quite clinches —
it's more the promise of a won
derful performance. And Truf
faut doesn't seem to.realize how
exciting she could be: He doesn't
shape the movie around her.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with Entre Nous.
Silkwood (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As Karen Silkwood, the young
woman employed by Kerr-
Mcgee's nuclear plant in Okla
homa who became more and
more convinced that her bosses
were guilty of criminal
negligence, Meryl Streep gives a
fairly compelling, rhythmed per
formance, studied and beauti
fully modulated, with flashes of
humor. But though Streep's gor
geous, ravaged face tells us she's
deep in thought, we never know
what she's thinking. Both Cher
(as Karen's best friend, Dolly)
and Kurt Russell (as her live-in

boy friend, Drew) are more elo
quent than she is, and they don't
have to work as hard for their ef
fects; they're both naturals.
Mike Nichols' movie, written by
Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen,
lopes along — it could use trim
ming and zippier pacing and
editing, as well as a consistent,
narrative line. Most of the emo
tional contact it makes with the
audience can be traced to the ex
ceptional cast (which also in
cludes Craig T. Nelson, Fred
Ward, Diana Scarwid, Ron Sil
ver and Josef Sommer) and the
incendiary subject matter. The
film's point of view is more
deeply depressive and defeatist
than that of most "problem"
pictures; its theme song is
"Amazing grace/How sweet the
sound/That saved a wretch like
me" — with the accent on
"wretch".
Plays Tuesday with Heart Like
a Wheel.
The Grey Fox (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This exquisitely shot, frustrat
ingly static Canadian feature by
Phillip Borsos traces the career
of stagecoach robber Bill Miner
(Richard Farnsworth), known as
the "Gentleman Bandit," after
his release from San Quentin in
1901 and his re-entry into a life
of crime, this time as a train rob
ber. Borsos clearly has talent,
but it's a painter's talent (at least
at this stage); he doesn't know
how to pace a scene or how to
direct his actors so that dialogue
sounds like something more than
dead air. (John Hunter's script
doesn't help.) Still, Frank Tidy's
magnificent cinematography is a
good enough reason to see the
movie. There are magical
images: a locomotive stretching
across a mountain-laid line of
track, the billowing white smoke
proliferating as it approaches;
another train gathering steam,
seemingly borne upon its smoke
like a huge mechanical dragon
on a pair of delicate white wings;
boats drifting across a lake
washed with the mauve glow of
early evening. With Jackie Bur
roughs.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Never Cry Wolf.
Under Fire (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Nicaragua in 1979, where
the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full
appreciation of its implications.
Among the many virtues of this
shamefully ignored movie are
the fine performances of Nolte,
Joanna Cassidy and Gene Hack
man in the central roles. (All
play reporters.) With Jean-Louis
Trintignant, Ed Harris and Rene
Enriquez as Somoza. Jerry
Goldsmith wrote the haunting
musical score (and Pat Metheny
plays on it).
Plays Monday with The Year
of Living Dangerously.

Apocalypse Now (1979)
Memorial Auditorium
Francis Ford Coppola's ver
sion of //earf of Darkness, set in
the jungles of Vietnam. Vittorio
Storaro shot the film in Conrad's
colors — deep greens with a
heavy white mist — and the

nightmarish. Unfortunately,
during the three years of shoot
ing Coppola must have lost his

The Trial (1963)
Cubberley Auditorium
Franz Kafka's famous novel
was an odd choice for Orson

a number of dreadful mistakes in
it (like an inappropriate jazz

Shot against a bleak, post-T.S.

lampposts piercing a foggy gray
sky, it's full of visual coups and
scenes that don't quite work but
are intriguing anyway. In the
best sequence, Anthony Perkins
runs through corridors illumi
nated by bars of light thrown in
through chinks in the walls.
Perkins gives Joseph K. too
many nervous tics, but by the
middle of the film his perfor
mance begins to make some
sense. The real stars are Welles'
camera and Edmond Rich

in person as the Advocate (it's

magnificent cinematography is a
good enough reason to see the
movie. There are magical
images: a locomotive stretching
across a mountain-laid line of
track, the billowing white smoke
proliferating as it approaches;
another train gathering steam,
seemingly borne upon its smoke
like a huge mechanical dragon
on a pair of delicate white wings;
boats drifting across a lake
washed with the mauve glow of
early evening. With Jackie Bur
roughs.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Never Cry Wolf.
Under Fire (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Nicaragua in 1979, where
the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full
appreciation of its implications.
Among the many virtues of this
shamefully ignored movie are
the fine performances of Nolte,
Joanna Cassidy and Gene Hack
man in the central roles. (All
play reporters.) With Jean-Louis
Trintignant, Ed Harris and Rene
Enriquez as Somoza. Jerry
Goldsmith wrote the haunting
musical score (and Pat Metheny
plays on it).
Plays Monday with The Year
of Living Dangerously.

Apocalypse Now (1979)
Memorial Auditorium
Francis Ford Coppola's ver
sion of //earf of Darkness, set in
the jungles of Vietnam. Vittorio
Storaro shot the film in Conrad's
colors — deep greens with a
heavy white mist — and the
sound recording, designed by
Walter Murch and executed in
Dolby stereo, is awesome; the
best sequences are surreal,
nightmarish. Unfortunately,
during the three years of shoot
ing Coppola must have lost his
hold on his ideas. The movie
lacks focus, and its hero, Capt.
Willard (inexpressively played
by Martin Sheen), is such a
zombie from the beginning that
there's nowhere for him to go.
Kurtz is played by Marlon
Brando, who reads "The Hollow
Men" aloud and gives an opaque
performance. If crazy Lt.
Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who
bombs islands so he can surf off
them, had been used as the sym
bol for this war rather than
Kurtz, the movie might have
made more sense. However, the
helicopter attack sequence is
worth seeing th£ movie for: It is
just about the best war footage
ever put on film.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.
The Trial (1963)
Cubberley Auditorium
Franz Kafka's famous novel
was an odd choice for Orson
Welles to film, and his movie has
a number of dreadful mistakes in
it (like an inappropriate jazz
score). But it's fascinating, too:
Shot against a bleak, post-T.S.
Eliot landscape of concrete
apartment buildings and rows of
lampposts piercing a foggy gray
sky, it's full of visual coups and
scenes that don't quite work but
are intriguing anyway. In the
best sequence, Anthony Perkins
runs through corridors illumi
nated by bars of light thrown in
through chinks in the walls.
Perkins gives Joseph K. too
many nervous tics, but by the
middle of the film his perfor
mance begins to make some
sense. The real stars are Welles'
camera and Edmond Rich
mond's lighting. Welles turns up
in person as the Advocate (it's
not one of his better perfor
mances), as do Jeanne Moreau,
Elsa Martinelli, Romy Schneider
and Akim Tamiroff.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Awful Truth (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
This comedy about divorce is
one of the funniest films of the
Depression years, though it isn't
often revived. Cary Grant and
Irene Dunne, whose shrillness
has been toned down by the
director, Leo McCarey, play the
quarreling couple, and Ralph
Bellamy (who first appears sing
ing "Home on the Range" to
himself) and Cecil Cunningham
play the second fiddles. Dunne's
costumes are terrific, especially
the hat she wears in court.(It
resembles a crushed vase.) Vina
Delmar's screenplay, based on
an Arthur Richman play, has a
beautiful, symmetrical structure.
Plays through Wednesday
with Holiday.
The Yearling (1946)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Parts of this extraordinary
children's film, adapted by Paul
Osborn from the Marjorie Kin
nan Rawlings novel and directed
by Clarence Brown, are reminis
cent of The Wizard of Oz (the
phantasmagorical tone), parts of
the 1940 Thief of Baghdad (the
rich storybook color), and parts
of Our Town (the stylized set
pieces, especially the death and
funeral of the neighbor child);
some scenes, shot with a red fil
ter, look astonishingly like
woodcuts. But the movie has a
sensibility all its own, and se
quences in it are utterly unlike
anything seen in any film before

The Black Stallion. (Carroll Bal
lard must have known the scene
in which the boy hero, Jody, runs
through the forest with his pet
fawn, Flag, and deer leap all
around them — a woodland bal
let.) Jane Wyman gives an un
conventionally sensitive
performance as Jody's practical,
earth-bound mother, and the
cast also benefits from the pres
ence of Margaret Wycherly,
Chill Wills, and Donn Gift as
Jody's crippled companion, Fod
derwing. (Their scenes together
are among the movie's high
points.) Unfortunately, if you've
seen Rip Torn and Dana Hill
play the real-life characters
Rawlings based Penny Baxter
and his son Jody on in Cross
Creek, you can't help but feel
some disappointment at the way
Gregory Peck and Claude Jar
man, Jr. perform the crucial
scene in which Baxter tells Jody
he has to shoot his pet.
Photographed by Charles Ros
her and Leonard Smith.
Plays tomorrow, Sunday,
Wednesday and Thursday.
Nosferatu the Vampyre
(1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In making his version of
Dracula, Werner Herzog was in
spired by Murnau's 1922 classic
Nosferatu. Herzog's imagery
echoes Murnau's and in some in
stances expands on it — as in the
creepy sequence where the
streets of Bremen fill up with
coffins. Klaus Kinski gives a fas
cinating performance as the
vampire; the scene in which he
stays all night with Lucy (eerily
beautiful Isabelle Adjani) may
be the most unusual piece of
erotica in the history of movies.
Lumpy and unevenly acted as it
is (Bruno Ganz makes a vacant
Jonathan Harker), this film con
tains flashes of brilliance.
Plays Tuesday with Aguirre,
the Wrath of God.
Heart Like a Wheel (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Friedman's script about
Shirley Muldowney, the only
driver ever to win the National
Hot Rod Association World
Championship three times, has
clarity, narrative logic and even
polish, and the director, Jonat
han Kaplan, demonstrates intel
ligence and an unfussy control of
the actors and the material. The
cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto,
has given the film a clean, classi
cally small-town American look,
and the major emotional
encounters are staged shrewdly
and economically. But the
filmmakers show a worse
deficiency than sloppy
craftsmanship or histrionic ex
cessiveness; They have ordinary
eyes. They take a predictable,
non-exploratory approach to
their subject, and Bonnie
Bedelia's competent but un
imaginative performance in the
central role doesn't help. The
warm, big-old-bear presences of
Beau Bridges (as Shirley's
partner/lover Connie Kalitta)
and Hoyt Axton (in a much-too
brief bit as Shirlev's father Tex

Roque) dominate the movie.
Plays Tuesday with Silkwood.
El Topo (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Alexandro Jodorowsky made
this heavily symbol-laden im
agist fable in Mexico, and it had
some success as a head film
when it was released in this
country. Amid all the other
garishly violent pictures in 1971
(Straw Dogs, Dirty Harry, A
Clockwork Orange, The Cow
boys, Polanski's Macbeth), the
stoned audiences barely regis
tered the carnage, the lakes of
blood, etc., that Jodorowsky of
fered for their delectation. It's a
deeply offensive movie, though,
and it lacks any genuine visual
poetry or invention or power —
without the interminable footage
of human and animal corpses
there would be no movie at all.
(The dead animals are real; the
SPCA has no branches in
Mexico.) Jodorowsky stars as
the mystical hero.
Plays Monday with The Holy
Mountain.
Holiday (1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
This was the second film ver
sion of Philip Barry's hit comedy
of the late 19205; the first, in
1930, starred Ann Harding,
Robert Ames and Mary Astor.
This one, directed by George
Cukor, features Cary Grant as
Johnny Case, who wants ad
venture, and Katharine Hepburn
as Linda Seton, the rebellious
kid sister of Johnny's stuffy fian
cee (Doris Nolan) — and it may
well be the warmest of all the
comedies of this epoch. Donald
Ogden Stewart's screenplay im
proved on the elegant stage
dialogue, and although one
keeps wondering how Grant
could ever have settled on Doris
Nolan, even for an instant (it's
the central question — the flaw
— of most comedies in this
genre), the rest of the acting is
superlative. Lew Ayres, as Hep
burn's i icoholic brother, prob
ably never got to be this sensitive
and touching again, and Edward
Everett Horton and Jean Dixon
are grand as Grant's best friends.
Grant is wonderful, and as for
Katharine Hepburn, she sur
passes one's greatest expecta
tions. Has any American actress
ever given a more complex and
affecting comic performance?
Plays through Wednesday
with The Awful Truth.
Never Cry Wolf (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Full of glorious footage, Car
roll Ballard's second commercial
film is nonetheless a disappoint
ment. Perhaps if the Farley
Mowat book that was its source
— the report of a man sent by
the Canadian government to
confirm the widely held belief
that wolves are causing the
gradual elimination of caribou in
the far north — had provided a
more compelling story, the
movie would have a sense of
movement, of urgency. As it is,
the picture as a whole seems
peculiarly passive. It has a

strange, arbitrary quality, as if
no one had devised a strategy for
linking its generally magnificent
scenes. It's a wonderful collec
tion of observations without a
point. (Even Mowat's obvious,
ironic message — that men, not
wolves, are responsible for the
devastation of the caribou —
hasn't made it into the final
print.) With Charles Martin
Smith, miscast as the hero,
Tyler, and two amazing-looking
Inuit actors, Zachary It
timangnaq and Samson Jorah.
Put together by half a dozen
writers (credited), and shot, su
perbly, by Hiro Narita.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Grey Fox.
Entre Nous (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Diane Kurys made this solidly
bourgeois comedy-drama about
a bond between two women,
Lena (Isabelle Huppert, in a
proficient, nicely detailed and
unexciting performance) and
Madeleine (Miou-Miou, whose
acting is enclosed and
restrained). The prospect of a
film about women in a relation
ship told from a woman's point
of view is a promising one, but
Kurys can't manage to shake her
ties to the Hollywood of the big
studio era or transcend her
situation-comedy sensibility.
The two protagonists talk about
sex, they admire each other's
breasts, they even share a bed at
one point — but in each case
Kurys cuts away before we have
an opportunity to see any sen
sual stirrings in either of them.
Kurys wants us to understand
how close two women can be,
yet she never indicates what
might make them close, and she
shuts off the one dramatic possi
bility she has to provide an ex
planation. Written by Kurys and
Alain Le Henry; with Guy Mar
chand and Jean-Pierre Bacri as
the women's husbands.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with The Woman Next
Door.
The Woman Next Door
(1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A pair of former lovers
(Gerard Depardieu and Fanny
Ardant), both now married,
resume their former passion
when fate moves her to a house
next door to his. It's Noel
Coward's Private Lives with an
extra comic-romantic kicker:
These two are so completely
engrossed in their desire for each
other that they destroy them
selves with it. Francois Truf
faut's film keeps threatening to
turn into a first-rate treatise on
romantic love (like his Story of
Adele H.), but the dialogue (by
Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman
and Jean Aurel) is frustratingly
earth-bound, and the direction
rarely moves far beyond
banality. Fanny Ardant's unus
ual looks hold the camera, and
so does the intensity of her act
ing, which is full of high spots
and yet never quite clinches —
it's more the promise of a won
derful performance. And Truf
faut doesn't seem to.realize how
exciting she could be: He doesn't
shape the movie around her.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with Entre Nous.
Silkwood (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As Karen Silkwood, the young
woman employed by Kerr-
Mcgee's nuclear plant in Okla
homa who became more and
more convinced that her bosses
were guilty of criminal
negligence, Meryl Streep gives a
fairly compelling, rhythmed per
formance, studied and beauti
fully modulated, with flashes of
humor. But though Streep's gor
geous, ravaged face tells us she's
deep in thought, we never know
what she's thinking. Both Cher
(as Karen's best friend, Dolly)
and Kurt Russell (as her live-in

boy friend, Drew) are more elo
quent than she is, and they don't
have to work as hard for their ef
fects; they're both naturals.
Mike Nichols' movie, written by
Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen,
lopes along — it could use trim
ming and zippier pacing and
editing, as well as a consistent,
narrative line. Most of the emo
tional contact it makes with the
audience can be traced to the ex
ceptional cast (which also in
cludes Craig T. Nelson, Fred
Ward, Diana Scarwid, Ron Sil
ver and Josef Sommer) and the
incendiary subject matter. The
film's point of view is more
deeply depressive and defeatist
than that of most "problem"
pictures; its theme song is
"Amazing grace/How sweet the
sound/That saved a wretch like
me" — with the accent on
"wretch".
Plays Tuesday with Heart Like
a Wheel.
The Grey Fox (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This exquisitely shot, frustrat
ingly static Canadian feature by
Phillip Borsos traces the career
of stagecoach robber Bill Miner
(Richard Farnsworth), known as
the "Gentleman Bandit," after
his release from San Quentin in
1901 and his re-entry into a life
of crime, this time as a train rob
ber. Borsos clearly has talent,
but it's a painter's talent (at least
at this stage); he doesn't know
how to pace a scene or how to
direct his actors so that dialogue
sounds like something more than
dead air. (John Hunter's script
doesn't help.) Still, Frank Tidy's
magnificent cinematography is a
good enough reason to see the
movie. There are magical
images: a locomotive stretching
across a mountain-laid line of
track, the billowing white smoke
proliferating as it approaches;
another train gathering steam,
seemingly borne upon its smoke
like a huge mechanical dragon
on a pair of delicate white wings;
boats drifting across a lake
washed with the mauve glow of
early evening. With Jackie Bur
roughs.

the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers

formance, studied and beauti
fully modulated, with flashes of
humor. But though Streep's gor
geous, ravaged face tells us she's
deep in thought, we never know
what she's thinking. Both Cher
(as Karen's best friend, Dolly)
and Kurt Russell (as her live-in

boy friend, Drew) are more elo
quent than she is, and they don't
have to work as hard for their ef
fects; they're both naturals.
Mike Nichols' movie, written by
Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen,
lopes along — it could use trim
ming and zippier pacing and
editing, as well as a consistent,
narrative line. Most of the emo
tional contact it makes with the
audience can be traced to the ex
ceptional cast (which also in
cludes Craig T. Nelson, Fred
Ward, Diana Scarwid, Ron Sil
ver and Josef Sommer) and the
incendiary subject matter. The
film's point of view is more
deeply depressive and defeatist
than that of most "problem"
pictures; its theme song is
"Amazing grace/How sweet the
sound/That saved a wretch like
me" — with the accent on
"wretch".
Plays Tuesday with Heart Like
a Wheel.
The Grey Fox (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This exquisitely shot, frustrat
ingly static Canadian feature by
Phillip Borsos traces the career
of stagecoach robber Bill Miner
(Richard Farnsworth), known as
the "Gentleman Bandit," after
his release from San Quentin in
1901 and his re-entry into a life
of crime, this time as a train rob
ber. Borsos clearly has talent,
but it's a painter's talent (at least
at this stage); he doesn't know
how to pace a scene or how to
direct his actors so that dialogue
sounds like something more than
dead air. (John Hunter's script
doesn't help.) Still, Frank Tidy's
magnificent cinematography is a
good enough reason to see the
movie. There are magical
images: a locomotive stretching
across a mountain-laid line of
track, the billowing white smoke
proliferating as it approaches;
another train gathering steam,
seemingly borne upon its smoke
like a huge mechanical dragon
on a pair of delicate white wings;
boats drifting across a lake
washed with the mauve glow of
early evening. With Jackie Bur
roughs.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Never Cry Wolf.
Under Fire (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Nicaragua in 1979, where
the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full
appreciation of its implications.
Among the many virtues of this
shamefully ignored movie are
the fine performances of Nolte,
Joanna Cassidy and Gene Hack
man in the central roles. (All
play reporters.) With Jean-Louis
Trintignant, Ed Harris and Rene
Enriquez as Somoza. Jerry
Goldsmith wrote the haunting
musical score (and Pat Metheny
plays on it).
Plays Monday with The Year
of Living Dangerously.

Apocalypse Now (1979)
Memorial Auditorium
Francis Ford Coppola's ver
sion of //earf of Darkness, set in
the jungles of Vietnam. Vittorio
Storaro shot the film in Conrad's
colors — deep greens with a
heavy white mist — and the
sound recording, designed by
Walter Murch and executed in
Dolby stereo, is awesome; the
best sequences are surreal,
nightmarish. Unfortunately,
during the three years of shoot
ing Coppola must have lost his
hold on his ideas. The movie
lacks focus, and its hero, Capt.
Willard (inexpressively played
by Martin Sheen), is such a
zombie from the beginning that
there's nowhere for him to go.
Kurtz is played by Marlon
Brando, who reads "The Hollow
Men" aloud and gives an opaque
performance. If crazy Lt.
Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who
bombs islands so he can surf off
them, had been used as the sym
bol for this war rather than
Kurtz, the movie might have
made more sense. However, the
helicopter attack sequence is
worth seeing th£ movie for: It is
just about the best war footage
ever put on film.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.
The Trial (1963)
Cubberley Auditorium
Franz Kafka's famous novel
was an odd choice for Orson
Welles to film, and his movie has
a number of dreadful mistakes in
it (like an inappropriate jazz
score). But it's fascinating, too:
Shot against a bleak, post-T.S.
Eliot landscape of concrete
apartment buildings and rows of
lampposts piercing a foggy gray
sky, it's full of visual coups and
scenes that don't quite work but
are intriguing anyway. In the
best sequence, Anthony Perkins
runs through corridors illumi
nated by bars of light thrown in
through chinks in the walls.
Perkins gives Joseph K. too
many nervous tics, but by the
middle of the film his perfor
mance begins to make some
sense. The real stars are Welles'
camera and Edmond Rich
mond's lighting. Welles turns up
in person as the Advocate (it's
not one of his better perfor
mances), as do Jeanne Moreau,
Elsa Martinelli, Romy Schneider
and Akim Tamiroff.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Awful Truth (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
This comedy about divorce is
one of the funniest films of the
Depression years, though it isn't
often revived. Cary Grant and
Irene Dunne, whose shrillness
has been toned down by the
director, Leo McCarey, play the
quarreling couple, and Ralph
Bellamy (who first appears sing
ing "Home on the Range" to
himself) and Cecil Cunningham
play the second fiddles. Dunne's
costumes are terrific, especially
the hat she wears in court.(It
resembles a crushed vase.) Vina
Delmar's screenplay, based on
an Arthur Richman play, has a
beautiful, symmetrical structure.
Plays through Wednesday
with Holiday.
The Yearling (1946)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Parts of this extraordinary
children's film, adapted by Paul
Osborn from the Marjorie Kin
nan Rawlings novel and directed
by Clarence Brown, are reminis
cent of The Wizard of Oz (the
phantasmagorical tone), parts of
the 1940 Thief of Baghdad (the
rich storybook color), and parts
of Our Town (the stylized set
pieces, especially the death and
funeral of the neighbor child);
some scenes, shot with a red fil
ter, look astonishingly like
woodcuts. But the movie has a
sensibility all its own, and se
quences in it are utterly unlike
anything seen in any film before

The Black Stallion. (Carroll Bal
lard must have known the scene
in which the boy hero, Jody, runs
through the forest with his pet
fawn, Flag, and deer leap all
around them — a woodland bal
let.) Jane Wyman gives an un
conventionally sensitive
performance as Jody's practical,
earth-bound mother, and the
cast also benefits from the pres
ence of Margaret Wycherly,
Chill Wills, and Donn Gift as
Jody's crippled companion, Fod
derwing. (Their scenes together
are among the movie's high
points.) Unfortunately, if you've
seen Rip Torn and Dana Hill
play the real-life characters
Rawlings based Penny Baxter
and his son Jody on in Cross
Creek, you can't help but feel
some disappointment at the way
Gregory Peck and Claude Jar
man, Jr. perform the crucial
scene in which Baxter tells Jody
he has to shoot his pet.
Photographed by Charles Ros
her and Leonard Smith.
Plays tomorrow, Sunday,
Wednesday and Thursday.
Nosferatu the Vampyre
(1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In making his version of
Dracula, Werner Herzog was in
spired by Murnau's 1922 classic
Nosferatu. Herzog's imagery
echoes Murnau's and in some in
stances expands on it — as in the
creepy sequence where the
streets of Bremen fill up with
coffins. Klaus Kinski gives a fas
cinating performance as the
vampire; the scene in which he
stays all night with Lucy (eerily
beautiful Isabelle Adjani) may
be the most unusual piece of
erotica in the history of movies.
Lumpy and unevenly acted as it
is (Bruno Ganz makes a vacant
Jonathan Harker), this film con
tains flashes of brilliance.
Plays Tuesday with Aguirre,
the Wrath of God.
Heart Like a Wheel (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Friedman's script about
Shirley Muldowney, the only
driver ever to win the National
Hot Rod Association World
Championship three times, has
clarity, narrative logic and even
polish, and the director, Jonat
han Kaplan, demonstrates intel
ligence and an unfussy control of
the actors and the material. The
cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto,
has given the film a clean, classi
cally small-town American look,
and the major emotional
encounters are staged shrewdly
and economically. But the
filmmakers show a worse
deficiency than sloppy
craftsmanship or histrionic ex
cessiveness; They have ordinary
eyes. They take a predictable,
non-exploratory approach to
their subject, and Bonnie
Bedelia's competent but un
imaginative performance in the
central role doesn't help. The
warm, big-old-bear presences of
Beau Bridges (as Shirley's
partner/lover Connie Kalitta)
and Hoyt Axton (in a much-too
brief bit as Shirlev's father Tex

Roque) dominate the movie.
Plays Tuesday with Silkwood.
El Topo (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Alexandro Jodorowsky made
this heavily symbol-laden im
agist fable in Mexico, and it had
some success as a head film
when it was released in this
country. Amid all the other
garishly violent pictures in 1971
(Straw Dogs, Dirty Harry, A
Clockwork Orange, The Cow
boys, Polanski's Macbeth), the
stoned audiences barely regis
tered the carnage, the lakes of
blood, etc., that Jodorowsky of
fered for their delectation. It's a
deeply offensive movie, though,
and it lacks any genuine visual
poetry or invention or power —
without the interminable footage
of human and animal corpses
there would be no movie at all.
(The dead animals are real; the
SPCA has no branches in
Mexico.) Jodorowsky stars as
the mystical hero.
Plays Monday with The Holy
Mountain.
Holiday (1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
This was the second film ver
sion of Philip Barry's hit comedy
of the late 19205; the first, in
1930, starred Ann Harding,
Robert Ames and Mary Astor.
This one, directed by George
Cukor, features Cary Grant as
Johnny Case, who wants ad
venture, and Katharine Hepburn
as Linda Seton, the rebellious
kid sister of Johnny's stuffy fian
cee (Doris Nolan) — and it may
well be the warmest of all the
comedies of this epoch. Donald
Ogden Stewart's screenplay im
proved on the elegant stage
dialogue, and although one
keeps wondering how Grant
could ever have settled on Doris
Nolan, even for an instant (it's
the central question — the flaw
— of most comedies in this
genre), the rest of the acting is
superlative. Lew Ayres, as Hep
burn's i icoholic brother, prob
ably never got to be this sensitive
and touching again, and Edward
Everett Horton and Jean Dixon
are grand as Grant's best friends.
Grant is wonderful, and as for
Katharine Hepburn, she sur
passes one's greatest expecta
tions. Has any American actress
ever given a more complex and
affecting comic performance?
Plays through Wednesday
with The Awful Truth.
Never Cry Wolf (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Full of glorious footage, Car
roll Ballard's second commercial
film is nonetheless a disappoint
ment. Perhaps if the Farley
Mowat book that was its source
— the report of a man sent by
the Canadian government to
confirm the widely held belief
that wolves are causing the
gradual elimination of caribou in
the far north — had provided a
more compelling story, the
movie would have a sense of
movement, of urgency. As it is,
the picture as a whole seems
peculiarly passive. It has a

strange, arbitrary quality, as if
no one had devised a strategy for
linking its generally magnificent
scenes. It's a wonderful collec
tion of observations without a
point. (Even Mowat's obvious,
ironic message — that men, not
wolves, are responsible for the
devastation of the caribou —
hasn't made it into the final
print.) With Charles Martin
Smith, miscast as the hero,
Tyler, and two amazing-looking
Inuit actors, Zachary It
timangnaq and Samson Jorah.
Put together by half a dozen
writers (credited), and shot, su
perbly, by Hiro Narita.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Grey Fox.
Entre Nous (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Diane Kurys made this solidly
bourgeois comedy-drama about
a bond between two women,
Lena (Isabelle Huppert, in a
proficient, nicely detailed and
unexciting performance) and
Madeleine (Miou-Miou, whose
acting is enclosed and
restrained). The prospect of a
film about women in a relation
ship told from a woman's point
of view is a promising one, but
Kurys can't manage to shake her
ties to the Hollywood of the big
studio era or transcend her
situation-comedy sensibility.
The two protagonists talk about
sex, they admire each other's
breasts, they even share a bed at
one point — but in each case
Kurys cuts away before we have
an opportunity to see any sen
sual stirrings in either of them.
Kurys wants us to understand
how close two women can be,
yet she never indicates what
might make them close, and she
shuts off the one dramatic possi
bility she has to provide an ex
planation. Written by Kurys and
Alain Le Henry; with Guy Mar
chand and Jean-Pierre Bacri as
the women's husbands.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with The Woman Next
Door.
The Woman Next Door
(1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A pair of former lovers
(Gerard Depardieu and Fanny
Ardant), both now married,
resume their former passion
when fate moves her to a house
next door to his. It's Noel
Coward's Private Lives with an
extra comic-romantic kicker:
These two are so completely
engrossed in their desire for each
other that they destroy them
selves with it. Francois Truf
faut's film keeps threatening to
turn into a first-rate treatise on
romantic love (like his Story of
Adele H.), but the dialogue (by
Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman
and Jean Aurel) is frustratingly
earth-bound, and the direction
rarely moves far beyond
banality. Fanny Ardant's unus
ual looks hold the camera, and
so does the intensity of her act
ing, which is full of high spots
and yet never quite clinches —
it's more the promise of a won
derful performance. And Truf
faut doesn't seem to.realize how
exciting she could be: He doesn't
shape the movie around her.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with Entre Nous.
Silkwood (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As Karen Silkwood, the young
woman employed by Kerr-
Mcgee's nuclear plant in Okla
homa who became more and
more convinced that her bosses
were guilty of criminal
negligence, Meryl Streep gives a
fairly compelling, rhythmed per
formance, studied and beauti
fully modulated, with flashes of
humor. But though Streep's gor
geous, ravaged face tells us she's
deep in thought, we never know
what she's thinking. Both Cher
(as Karen's best friend, Dolly)
and Kurt Russell (as her live-in

boy friend, Drew) are more elo
quent than she is, and they don't
have to work as hard for their ef
fects; they're both naturals.
Mike Nichols' movie, written by
Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen,
lopes along — it could use trim
ming and zippier pacing and
editing, as well as a consistent,
narrative line. Most of the emo
tional contact it makes with the
audience can be traced to the ex
ceptional cast (which also in
cludes Craig T. Nelson, Fred
Ward, Diana Scarwid, Ron Sil
ver and Josef Sommer) and the
incendiary subject matter. The
film's point of view is more
deeply depressive and defeatist
than that of most "problem"
pictures; its theme song is
"Amazing grace/How sweet the
sound/That saved a wretch like
me" — with the accent on
"wretch".

sual stirrings in either of them.
Kurys wants us to understand
how close two women can be,
yet she never indicates what
might make them close, and she
shuts off the one dramatic possi
bility she has to provide an ex
planation. Written by Kurys and
Alain Le Henry; with Guy Mar
chand and Jean-Pierre Bacri as
the women's husbands.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with The Woman Next
Door.
The Woman Next Door
(1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A pair of former lovers
(Gerard Depardieu and Fanny
Ardant), both now married,
resume their former passion
when fate moves her to a house
next door to his. It's Noel
Coward's Private Lives with an
extra comic-romantic kicker:
These two are so completely
engrossed in their desire for each
other that they destroy them
selves with it. Francois Truf
faut's film keeps threatening to
turn into a first-rate treatise on
romantic love (like his Story of
Adele H.), but the dialogue (by
Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman
and Jean Aurel) is frustratingly
earth-bound, and the direction
rarely moves far beyond
banality. Fanny Ardant's unus
ual looks hold the camera, and
so does the intensity of her act
ing, which is full of high spots
and yet never quite clinches —
it's more the promise of a won
derful performance. And Truf
faut doesn't seem to.realize how
exciting she could be: He doesn't
shape the movie around her.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with Entre Nous.
Silkwood (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As Karen Silkwood, the young
woman employed by Kerr-
Mcgee's nuclear plant in Okla
homa who became more and
more convinced that her bosses
were guilty of criminal
negligence, Meryl Streep gives a
fairly compelling, rhythmed per
formance, studied and beauti
fully modulated, with flashes of
humor. But though Streep's gor
geous, ravaged face tells us she's
deep in thought, we never know
what she's thinking. Both Cher
(as Karen's best friend, Dolly)
and Kurt Russell (as her live-in

boy friend, Drew) are more elo
quent than she is, and they don't
have to work as hard for their ef
fects; they're both naturals.
Mike Nichols' movie, written by
Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen,
lopes along — it could use trim
ming and zippier pacing and
editing, as well as a consistent,
narrative line. Most of the emo
tional contact it makes with the
audience can be traced to the ex
ceptional cast (which also in
cludes Craig T. Nelson, Fred
Ward, Diana Scarwid, Ron Sil
ver and Josef Sommer) and the
incendiary subject matter. The
film's point of view is more
deeply depressive and defeatist
than that of most "problem"
pictures; its theme song is
"Amazing grace/How sweet the
sound/That saved a wretch like
me" — with the accent on
"wretch".
Plays Tuesday with Heart Like
a Wheel.
The Grey Fox (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This exquisitely shot, frustrat
ingly static Canadian feature by
Phillip Borsos traces the career
of stagecoach robber Bill Miner
(Richard Farnsworth), known as
the "Gentleman Bandit," after
his release from San Quentin in
1901 and his re-entry into a life
of crime, this time as a train rob
ber. Borsos clearly has talent,
but it's a painter's talent (at least
at this stage); he doesn't know
how to pace a scene or how to
direct his actors so that dialogue
sounds like something more than
dead air. (John Hunter's script
doesn't help.) Still, Frank Tidy's
magnificent cinematography is a
good enough reason to see the
movie. There are magical
images: a locomotive stretching
across a mountain-laid line of
track, the billowing white smoke
proliferating as it approaches;
another train gathering steam,
seemingly borne upon its smoke
like a huge mechanical dragon
on a pair of delicate white wings;
boats drifting across a lake
washed with the mauve glow of
early evening. With Jackie Bur
roughs.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Never Cry Wolf.
Under Fire (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Nicaragua in 1979, where
the activities of the Sandinistas
threaten the American
supported regime of General
Anastasio Somoza, a photojour
nalist (Nick Nolte) falls in love
with the rebels' cause and they
ask him to photograph the
corpse of their fallen leader to
look like he's still alive — to
convince the world (and the
Nicaraguan people) that they
have an excellent chance of
defeating Somoza. Roger Spot
tiswoode's film has a leftist bias,
but it doesn't reduce the political
content to cartoon — it forces us
to respond intellectually as well
as emotionally. And the script
(by Ron Shelton and Clayton
Frohman) is beautifully
structured so that as the movie
goes on, the ironies layer around
the core of the focal object —
the photograph. The filmmakers
present the loaded issue of jour
nalistic ethics versus moral re
sponsibility with a full
appreciation of its implications.
Among the many virtues of this
shamefully ignored movie are
the fine performances of Nolte,
Joanna Cassidy and Gene Hack
man in the central roles. (All
play reporters.) With Jean-Louis
Trintignant, Ed Harris and Rene
Enriquez as Somoza. Jerry
Goldsmith wrote the haunting
musical score (and Pat Metheny
plays on it).
Plays Monday with The Year
of Living Dangerously.

Apocalypse Now (1979)
Memorial Auditorium
Francis Ford Coppola's ver
sion of //earf of Darkness, set in
the jungles of Vietnam. Vittorio
Storaro shot the film in Conrad's
colors — deep greens with a
heavy white mist — and the
sound recording, designed by
Walter Murch and executed in
Dolby stereo, is awesome; the
best sequences are surreal,
nightmarish. Unfortunately,
during the three years of shoot
ing Coppola must have lost his
hold on his ideas. The movie
lacks focus, and its hero, Capt.
Willard (inexpressively played
by Martin Sheen), is such a
zombie from the beginning that
there's nowhere for him to go.
Kurtz is played by Marlon
Brando, who reads "The Hollow
Men" aloud and gives an opaque
performance. If crazy Lt.
Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who
bombs islands so he can surf off
them, had been used as the sym
bol for this war rather than
Kurtz, the movie might have
made more sense. However, the
helicopter attack sequence is
worth seeing th£ movie for: It is
just about the best war footage
ever put on film.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.
The Trial (1963)
Cubberley Auditorium
Franz Kafka's famous novel
was an odd choice for Orson
Welles to film, and his movie has
a number of dreadful mistakes in
it (like an inappropriate jazz
score). But it's fascinating, too:
Shot against a bleak, post-T.S.
Eliot landscape of concrete
apartment buildings and rows of
lampposts piercing a foggy gray
sky, it's full of visual coups and
scenes that don't quite work but
are intriguing anyway. In the
best sequence, Anthony Perkins
runs through corridors illumi
nated by bars of light thrown in
through chinks in the walls.
Perkins gives Joseph K. too
many nervous tics, but by the
middle of the film his perfor
mance begins to make some
sense. The real stars are Welles'
camera and Edmond Rich
mond's lighting. Welles turns up
in person as the Advocate (it's
not one of his better perfor
mances), as do Jeanne Moreau,
Elsa Martinelli, Romy Schneider
and Akim Tamiroff.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Awful Truth (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
This comedy about divorce is
one of the funniest films of the
Depression years, though it isn't
often revived. Cary Grant and
Irene Dunne, whose shrillness
has been toned down by the
director, Leo McCarey, play the
quarreling couple, and Ralph
Bellamy (who first appears sing
ing "Home on the Range" to
himself) and Cecil Cunningham
play the second fiddles. Dunne's
costumes are terrific, especially
the hat she wears in court.(It
resembles a crushed vase.) Vina
Delmar's screenplay, based on
an Arthur Richman play, has a
beautiful, symmetrical structure.
Plays through Wednesday
with Holiday.
The Yearling (1946)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Parts of this extraordinary
children's film, adapted by Paul
Osborn from the Marjorie Kin
nan Rawlings novel and directed
by Clarence Brown, are reminis
cent of The Wizard of Oz (the
phantasmagorical tone), parts of
the 1940 Thief of Baghdad (the
rich storybook color), and parts
of Our Town (the stylized set
pieces, especially the death and
funeral of the neighbor child);
some scenes, shot with a red fil
ter, look astonishingly like
woodcuts. But the movie has a
sensibility all its own, and se
quences in it are utterly unlike
anything seen in any film before

The Black Stallion. (Carroll Bal
lard must have known the scene
in which the boy hero, Jody, runs
through the forest with his pet
fawn, Flag, and deer leap all
around them — a woodland bal
let.) Jane Wyman gives an un
conventionally sensitive
performance as Jody's practical,
earth-bound mother, and the
cast also benefits from the pres
ence of Margaret Wycherly,
Chill Wills, and Donn Gift as
Jody's crippled companion, Fod
derwing. (Their scenes together
are among the movie's high
points.) Unfortunately, if you've
seen Rip Torn and Dana Hill
play the real-life characters
Rawlings based Penny Baxter
and his son Jody on in Cross
Creek, you can't help but feel
some disappointment at the way
Gregory Peck and Claude Jar
man, Jr. perform the crucial
scene in which Baxter tells Jody
he has to shoot his pet.
Photographed by Charles Ros
her and Leonard Smith.
Plays tomorrow, Sunday,
Wednesday and Thursday.
Nosferatu the Vampyre
(1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In making his version of
Dracula, Werner Herzog was in
spired by Murnau's 1922 classic
Nosferatu. Herzog's imagery
echoes Murnau's and in some in
stances expands on it — as in the
creepy sequence where the
streets of Bremen fill up with
coffins. Klaus Kinski gives a fas
cinating performance as the
vampire; the scene in which he
stays all night with Lucy (eerily
beautiful Isabelle Adjani) may
be the most unusual piece of
erotica in the history of movies.
Lumpy and unevenly acted as it
is (Bruno Ganz makes a vacant
Jonathan Harker), this film con
tains flashes of brilliance.
Plays Tuesday with Aguirre,
the Wrath of God.
Heart Like a Wheel (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Friedman's script about
Shirley Muldowney, the only
driver ever to win the National
Hot Rod Association World
Championship three times, has
clarity, narrative logic and even
polish, and the director, Jonat
han Kaplan, demonstrates intel
ligence and an unfussy control of
the actors and the material. The
cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto,
has given the film a clean, classi
cally small-town American look,
and the major emotional
encounters are staged shrewdly
and economically. But the
filmmakers show a worse
deficiency than sloppy
craftsmanship or histrionic ex
cessiveness; They have ordinary
eyes. They take a predictable,
non-exploratory approach to
their subject, and Bonnie
Bedelia's competent but un
imaginative performance in the
central role doesn't help. The
warm, big-old-bear presences of
Beau Bridges (as Shirley's
partner/lover Connie Kalitta)
and Hoyt Axton (in a much-too
brief bit as Shirlev's father Tex

Roque) dominate the movie.
Plays Tuesday with Silkwood.
El Topo (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Alexandro Jodorowsky made
this heavily symbol-laden im
agist fable in Mexico, and it had
some success as a head film
when it was released in this
country. Amid all the other
garishly violent pictures in 1971
(Straw Dogs, Dirty Harry, A
Clockwork Orange, The Cow
boys, Polanski's Macbeth), the
stoned audiences barely regis
tered the carnage, the lakes of
blood, etc., that Jodorowsky of
fered for their delectation. It's a
deeply offensive movie, though,
and it lacks any genuine visual
poetry or invention or power —
without the interminable footage
of human and animal corpses
there would be no movie at all.
(The dead animals are real; the
SPCA has no branches in
Mexico.) Jodorowsky stars as
the mystical hero.
Plays Monday with The Holy
Mountain.
Holiday (1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
This was the second film ver
sion of Philip Barry's hit comedy
of the late 19205; the first, in
1930, starred Ann Harding,
Robert Ames and Mary Astor.
This one, directed by George
Cukor, features Cary Grant as
Johnny Case, who wants ad
venture, and Katharine Hepburn
as Linda Seton, the rebellious
kid sister of Johnny's stuffy fian
cee (Doris Nolan) — and it may
well be the warmest of all the
comedies of this epoch. Donald
Ogden Stewart's screenplay im
proved on the elegant stage
dialogue, and although one
keeps wondering how Grant
could ever have settled on Doris
Nolan, even for an instant (it's
the central question — the flaw
— of most comedies in this
genre), the rest of the acting is
superlative. Lew Ayres, as Hep
burn's i icoholic brother, prob
ably never got to be this sensitive
and touching again, and Edward
Everett Horton and Jean Dixon
are grand as Grant's best friends.
Grant is wonderful, and as for
Katharine Hepburn, she sur
passes one's greatest expecta
tions. Has any American actress
ever given a more complex and
affecting comic performance?
Plays through Wednesday
with The Awful Truth.
Never Cry Wolf (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Full of glorious footage, Car
roll Ballard's second commercial
film is nonetheless a disappoint
ment. Perhaps if the Farley
Mowat book that was its source
— the report of a man sent by
the Canadian government to
confirm the widely held belief
that wolves are causing the
gradual elimination of caribou in
the far north — had provided a
more compelling story, the
movie would have a sense of
movement, of urgency. As it is,
the picture as a whole seems
peculiarly passive. It has a

strange, arbitrary quality, as if
no one had devised a strategy for
linking its generally magnificent
scenes. It's a wonderful collec
tion of observations without a
point. (Even Mowat's obvious,
ironic message — that men, not
wolves, are responsible for the
devastation of the caribou —
hasn't made it into the final
print.) With Charles Martin
Smith, miscast as the hero,
Tyler, and two amazing-looking
Inuit actors, Zachary It
timangnaq and Samson Jorah.
Put together by half a dozen
writers (credited), and shot, su
perbly, by Hiro Narita.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Grey Fox.
Entre Nous (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Diane Kurys made this solidly
bourgeois comedy-drama about
a bond between two women,
Lena (Isabelle Huppert, in a
proficient, nicely detailed and
unexciting performance) and
Madeleine (Miou-Miou, whose
acting is enclosed and
restrained). The prospect of a
film about women in a relation
ship told from a woman's point
of view is a promising one, but
Kurys can't manage to shake her
ties to the Hollywood of the big
studio era or transcend her
situation-comedy sensibility.
The two protagonists talk about
sex, they admire each other's
breasts, they even share a bed at
one point — but in each case
Kurys cuts away before we have
an opportunity to see any sen
sual stirrings in either of them.
Kurys wants us to understand
how close two women can be,
yet she never indicates what
might make them close, and she
shuts off the one dramatic possi
bility she has to provide an ex
planation. Written by Kurys and
Alain Le Henry; with Guy Mar
chand and Jean-Pierre Bacri as
the women's husbands.
Plays Wednesday and
Thursday with The Woman Next
Door.
The Woman Next Door
(1981)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A pair of former lovers
(Gerard Depardieu and Fanny
Ardant), both now married,
resume their former passion
when fate moves her to a house
next door to his. It's Noel
Coward's Private Lives with an
extra comic-romantic kicker:
These two are so completely
engrossed in their desire for each
other that they destroy them
selves with it. Francois Truf
faut's film keeps threatening to
turn into a first-rate treatise on
romantic love (like his Story of
Adele H.), but the dialogue (by
Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman
and Jean Aurel) is frustratingly
earth-bound, and the direction
rarely moves far beyond
banality. Fanny Ardant's unus
ual looks hold the camera, and
so does the intensity of her act
ing, which is full of high spots
and yet never quite clinches —
it's more the promise of a won

Silkwood (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As Karen Silkwood, the young
woman employed by Kerr-
Mcgee's nuclear plant in Okla
homa who became more and

fairly compelling, rhythmed per

and Kurt Russell (as her live-in

boy friend, Drew) are more elo
quent than she is, and they don't
have to work as hard for their ef
fects; they're both naturals.
Mike Nichols' movie, written by
Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen,
lopes along — it could use trim
ming and zippier pacing and
editing, as well as a consistent,
narrative line. Most of the emo
tional contact it makes with the
audience can be traced to the ex
ceptional cast (which also in
cludes Craig T. Nelson, Fred

incendiary subject matter. The
