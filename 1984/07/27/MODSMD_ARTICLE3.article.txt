# Sweeney appointed policy center head
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
Professor James Sweeney of
Engineering-Economic Systems
has been chosen to direct the
Center for Economic Policy Re
search (CEPR). One of the
founders of the relatively new
policy-evaluating organization,
Sweeney replaces James Rosse
who leaves the position to be
vice president and provost of
the University starting on the
first of September.

Carolyn Sherwood, the assis
tant director of CEPR, said
Sweeney's experience made him
the logical choice to succeed
Rosse.
The director of CEPR is re
sponsible for the organization's
administrative duties and gener
ally overseeing its activities.
He works with a steering com
mittee which chooses the proj
ects and activities that the group
funds and works with.
"CEPR is in the business of
funding research of economic

nature," said Sherwood. "They
usually have a fairly direct
policy relevancy."
In the past, CEPR has funded
programs such as study by Mi
chael Boskin on Social Security
and the structure of the federal
budget. Members of the com
mittee include William Perry,
Nathan Rosenberg, Kenneth
Arrow, Pitch Johnson, Ralph
Landau, Bert Hickman, John
Shoven, and Timothy Bres
nahan.
Sweeney was picked, accor
ding to Sherwood, because he
was a member and familiar with
the organization of the center.
He has already accepted the po
sition, though he is presently on
vacation and unavailable for
comment.
The appointment, announced
by Vice Provost Gerald Lieber
man on Monday, will be effec
tive when Rosse leaves office
the first of next month.
Sweeney's term will last three
years.
He holds a bachelor's degree
in electrical engineering from
MIT and a Ph.D. from Stanford
in studies of engineering
economic systems.
Sweeney has published
numerous articles on subjects
ranging from housing markets
to gasoline consumption and has
contributed to more than 100
papers, books, and articles ap
pearing in The Energy Journal
and the Journal of Economic
