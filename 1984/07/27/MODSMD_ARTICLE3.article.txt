# Sweeney appointed policy center head
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
Professor James Sweeney of
Engineering-Economic Systems
has been chosen to direct the
Center for Economic Policy Re
search (CEPR). One of the
founders of the relatively new
policy-evaluating organization,
Sweeney replaces James Rosse
who leaves the position to be
vice president and provost of
the University starting on the
first of September.

Carolyn Sherwood, the assis
tant director of CEPR, said
Sweeney's experience made him
the logical choice to succeed
Rosse.
The director of CEPR is re
sponsible for the organization's
administrative duties and gener
ally overseeing its activities.
He works with a steering com
mittee which chooses the proj
ects and activities that the group
funds and works with.
"CEPR is in the business of
funding research of economic

nature," said Sherwood. "They
usually have a fairly direct
policy relevancy."
In the past, CEPR has funded
programs such as study by Mi
chael Boskin on Social Security
and the structure of the federal
budget. Members of the com
mittee include William Perry,
Nathan Rosenberg, Kenneth
Arrow, Pitch Johnson, Ralph
Landau, Bert Hickman, John
Shoven, and Timothy Bres
nahan.
Sweeney was picked, accor
ding to Sherwood, because he
was a member and familiar with
the organization of the center.
He has already accepted the po
sition, though he is presently on
vacation and unavailable for
comment.
The appointment, announced
by Vice Provost Gerald Lieber
man on Monday, will be effec
tive when Rosse leaves office
the first of next month.
Sweeney's term will last three
years.
He holds a bachelor's degree
in electrical engineering from
MIT and a Ph.D. from Stanford
in studies of engineering
economic systems.
Sweeney has published
numerous articles on subjects
ranging from housing markets
to gasoline consumption and has
contributed to more than 100
papers, books, and articles ap
pearing in The Energy Journal
and the Journal of Economic


James Sweeney
Theory.
The largest amount of his
time has been devoted to the
application of economic meth
ods and mathematical modeling.
Both of these fields are central
to the work of the CEPR, par
ticularly in policy analysis.
"The economy, like the wea
ther, is a set of problems people
complain about but feel helpless
to change," reads CEPR's
description of itself. "Stanford
has a reasearch center dedicated
to the proposition that the eco
nomy, unlike the weather, can
be improved . . . and there is no
place quite like it anywhere
else."
Lieberman's announcement
was the result of a long process
beginning with the announce
ment that Rosse was moving to
the post of provost this spring.
CEPR's steering committee,
chaired by Boskin and including
Arrow, Business School Prof.
Alain Enthoven, Prof, of Law
and Economics Mitchell
Polinsky, Rosenberg, Rosse,
and Sweeney, looked at candi
dates and recommended the re
placement to the provost's of

fice.
Lieberman then sought ap
proval for the recommendation
and announced the decision ear
lier this week.
Although the position in
volves only a medium amount of
administrative work, Sweeney
already is involved as chairman
of the Stanford Institute for En
ergy Studies, and is also a
cooperative professor at the
School of Law, an affiliated pro
fessor at the Department of
Economics, the director of the
Energy Modeling Forum and
chairman of the Institute for
Energy Studies.
In the past, however, he has
found enough additional energy
to chair the Office of Energy
Systems in the Federal Energy
Administration in Washington
and direct the Office of Quan
titative Methods and the Office
of Energy Systems Modeling
and Forecasting.
His predecessor was chosen
for the job of provost of the
University, a position many ad
ministrators describe as
"running the Farm." Both Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy and his predecessor, Rich
ard Lyman, served as provost
immediately before being selec
ted for the presidency.
