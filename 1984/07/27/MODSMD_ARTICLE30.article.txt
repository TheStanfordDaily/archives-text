House passes prayer bill
Washington — Public schools will not be able to
deny students the opportunity for individual silent
prayer during school hours under compromise legis
lation approved overwhelmingly yesterday by the
House.
The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Steven Gunder
son (R-Wis.), was passed 356 to 50 as an amend
ment to an omnibus education bill still under consid
eration by the House.
Gunderson said his amendment was designed as a
compromise to a proposal by Rep. Daniel Coats (R-
Ind.) that would have cut off federal funds to any
school preventing prayers by individuals on a volun
tary basis.
But Coats, who reluctantly voted for the compro
mise, said it is "probably of no real significance."
Under the compromise bill, schools failing to
comply could be sued by students. It also forbids
schools to compel students to participate in silent
prayer or to dictate the form or content of any such
prayer.
Senate votes to guarantee
security payment increase
Washington — The Republican-controlled Sen
ate, taking a cue from President Reagan, voted 86-3
last night to guarantee cost-of-living increases on
New Year's Day 1985 to all Social Security
recipients no matter what the inflation rate is.

The unexpected Senate vote was initiated by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), who said the in
crease would go mostly to people "who don't have
much."
Moynihan aides portrayed the move as an effort
to jump the gun on the president, who told his news
conference Tuesday night he would ask Congress for
such a measure.
Current law blocks cost-of-living increases if in
flation falls below 3 percent.
Those who receive supplemental security pay
ments will also be included in the increase approved
by the Senate.
Uncle Sam rescues a bank
Washington — The government yesterday forged
a record $4.5 billion bail-out of Continental Illinois
National Bank & Trust Co., whose high-flying len
ding practices left it teetering with a huge portfolio
of bad loans.
The deal, which has some of the appearances of
nationalization, immediately drew some complaints
in Congress that federal regulators had fashioned
the arrangement behind the public's back.
But the regulators defended their action, contend
ing it was the best way to bolster the ailing Chicago
giant and maintain stability in the banking system.
The scheme will leave the bank holding company
with about $30 billion in assets, one-quarter less
than the $41 billion it had in March. Its nationwide
standing will slip from No. 8 to somewhere in the
range of 10 to 20, bank officials said.
The arrangement must still be voted upon by the
bank's shareholders at a meeting, likely in Septem
ber. If they reject the deal, the agency said it will
withdraw its aid and the bank will be declared insol
vent.

Amtrak tower operator
failed to throw switch
Washington — Two passenger trains crashed
head-on in New York City because a signal tower
operator mistakenly allowed the northbound train
onto the same track as the southbound train, the
head of Amtrak said yesterday.
The operator was suspended and charged with
violating Amtrak rules, and a urine test found traces
of cocaine and "a cannabis derivative" in his
bloodstream, according to John Riley, head of the
Federal Railroad Administration. Cannabis is an
other name for marijuana.
But Riley said there was no proof drugs played
any role in Monday's accident, which killed one man
and injured 115 people.
Riley told a Senate subcommittee the drug traces
found in the operator's urine were so small as to
raise "serious doubts" that drugs had any effect on
the accident.
FCC lifts ownership limits
Washington — The Federal Communications
Commission, overturning a 31-year-old policy
aimed at promoting media diversity, yesterday eased
the limits on the number of television and radio sta
tions any one owner can hold and voted to abolish
them completely by 1990.
As a result of the FCC's action, the networks and
other media groups will be able immediately to
begin buying up more local television and radio sta
tions, increasing the number of outlets per owner
from seven television and 14 radio stations to 12
television and 24 radio stations.
