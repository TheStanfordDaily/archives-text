# Purpura to lead NY med school
## 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
Medical School Dean Dominick Purpura will
leave Stanford at the end of the summer to
become dean of Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in New York City.
Purpura resigned as dean of Stanford Medical
School in June, but had planned to remain on the
University's faculty as an associate vice president
for research. In announcing his resignation June
9, Purpura said he wanted to devote more time to
his research.
His resignation. Purpura said, was due to his
"desire to return to neuroscience research and
educational programs in basic neurology."
Purpura said he wanted to develop "research
on fundamental mechanisms of brain function."'

In announcing Purpura's appointment, Yeshiva
University President Norman Lamm said the
search committee at Einstein was "electrified"
when it learned of Purpura's resignation at Stan
ford. "They know him as a brilliant scientist, a
skillful administrator and a charismatic educator
whose talents enriched Einstein for 15 years,"
Lamm said.
Purpura had served as a consultant to Einstein's
dean selection committee for several months
before he knew he might be available for the posi
tion.
He said his priorities for his new job will be en
hancing Einstein's research programs in biomedi
cal and behavioral sciences, and promoting pa-
tient care and research pro
grams at the Bronx Municipal
Hospital Center and Montefiore
Medical Center.
Purpura, 57, was selected
from a field of 300 candidates
for the deanship at Stanford in
1981. He continued to teach
throughout his three years at the
University, and also served as
editor of three medical journals,
"Brain Research," "Devel
opmental Brain Research" and
"Brain Research Reviews,"
while serving as dean.
During his 26 months at Stan
ford, Purpura was responsible
for conceiving the University's
proposed Center for Molecular
and Genetic Medicine and the
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Center. His other major
achievements at Stanford in

eluded the creation of a new Of
fice of Education, construction
of the first $12-million phase of
a new animal medicine facility
and setting up the Kaiser Foun
dation Chair in Health Policy
Research.
Before coming to Stanford,
he spent 15 years at Einstein,
where he was chairman of the
neuroscience department and
director of the Rose Kennedy
Center for Research in Mental
Retardation and Human Devel
opment.
A graduate of Harvard Medi
cal School, Purpura taught at
Columbia University's College
of Physicians and Surgeons from
1956 to 1967.
Albert Einstein Medical
School, located in the Bronx, is
part of Yeshiva University.
Since its founding in 1955,
Einstein has consistently ranked
among the top 10 institutions in
the United States in funding for
biomedical research.
