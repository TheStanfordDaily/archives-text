## Reagan courts blue-collar Catholic voters 
### 
Hoboken, N.J. â€” President Reagan yesterday used
Frank Sinatra, Pope John Paul II and the patron saint
of women to appeal to blue-collar Roman Catholic
voters, asking a church festival in this working-class city
"to give a kid a chance."
On a day of ethnic politicking intended to offset the
Democrats' choice of Geraldine Ferraro as their vice
presidential candidate, Reagan was accompanied by
the entertainer, invoked the support of the pope against
"totalitarian thugs" in Nicaragua, and paid tribute to
St. Ann.
Speaking to a crowd at a spaghetti dinner at St. Ann's
Catholic Church here, Reagan attacked Ferraro and
Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale on
the highly charged issues of abortion, tuition tax
credits, school prayer and Central America.
"We are for life and against abortion, we are for
prayer in the schools, we are for tuition tax credits and,
in Central America, we are rather more inclined to lis
ten to the testimony of the pope than the claims of a
communist clique," Reagan told the church audience.
Reagan yesterday also went to unusual lengths to
showcase Republican women. At an earlier campaign
rally in suburban Atlanta, Sen. Paula Hawkins (R-
Fla.), one of two GOP women senators, introduced the
president, and in Elizabeth, N.J., Reagan was intro

duced by GOP Senate candidate Mary Mochary.
He told the Atlanta audience that "the other party
apparently thinks the South just isn't important this
year, the South just doesn't deserve much attention . . .
We won't write it off, kiss it off, or try to buy it off. We
won't turn our backs and walk away."
Departing from his prepared text in Atlanta, Reagan
accused Mondale of having "never missed a vote on
raising taxes." The president then emphasized his
qualified pledge earlier this week not to raise taxes if he
is re-elected Nov. 6. But he again left the door open for
a tax increase if deeper spending cuts are not sufficient
to eliminate the federal deficit.
The president said inflation was a "Democratic
disease," blamed congressional Democrats for deficit
spending, and said Democrats "went so far left" at their
national convention in San Francisco that "they have
left the mainstream."
He recited a litany of what he called "the plain truth"
about his record and concluded, "the plain truth is
things are better" than in 1980 when "a tyrant held our
diplomats hostage" and "our government was talking
about a malaise."
Reagan scornfully quoted Mondale as saying in 1981
that "it just baffles me why the Soviets these last few
years have behaved as they have." Reagan added, "He

didn't understand. But the American people did."
"In the past four years, not a single country has fallen
to communism," Reagan said, adding to cheers that the
eastern Caribbean island of Grenada was "set free from
the clutches of Fidel Castro."
Courting blue-collar Democrats, the president
picked up the endorsement of Elizabeth's Democratic
mayor, Thomas Dunn, who decried the "silver
throated liberal extremists in our country today."
The president shifted from a partisan, sermon-like
cadence in Atlanta to a more humble, folksy delivery at
St. Ann's Church here. He said he was "throwing my
candidacy on the mercies of the good people" of the
church "and asking them to give a kid a chance."
Reagan reserved his most impassioned rhetoric yes
terday to criticize the Democrats on Central America.
"Why do those who claim to represent the most en
lightened thought on Central America refuse to listen
to the testimony of one of the great moral leaders of
our time, Pope John Paul II?" he asked.
"Why can't those who claim to represent the most
enlightened opinion on Central America come to grips
with what is happening there?" he asked. "Why can't
they admit that the Sandinistas are only totalitarian
thugs who are squelching freedom in their country, in
cluding freedom Of religion?" The Washington Post
