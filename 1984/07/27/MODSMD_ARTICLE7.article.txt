Cienfuegos, Cuba (AP) —
President Fidel Castro declared
yesterday that he sincerely
wants better relations with the
United States, but recited a
litany of complaints against it
and added that any U.S. military
action against Cuba would come
at "very high cost."
In a three-hour speech to a
crowd of more than 100,000

people marking the 31st an
niversary of a 1953 attack that
launched his revolution, Castro
charged that the U.S. was fun
ding its economic recovery and
arms buildup at the expense of
the rest of the world.
He blamed it for increased
suffering in Latin America, and
referred to the history of U.S.
hostility toward Cuba.

Castro's speech was devoid of
any personal references to Pres
ident Reagan, who he has stri
dently criticized in past
speeches. Instead, he focused on
the visit last month of the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and noted that as
a result of Jackson's visit, U.S.
and Cuban negotiators two
weeks ago began talks on im
migration issues.

"We are, on our part, willing
to continue those talks with
maturity, seriousness, courage
and the conviction of our revo
lution. Those who know Cuba
know we are serious, we do not
use lies, we are not using tricks.
By force, no one will get any
thing from us. But with gestures
of peace, we can discuss things."
Castro said he was willing to

discuss solutions to the current
guerrilla wars in El Salvador
and Nicaragua, and in southern
Africa.
"We will not reject any
gesture that might reduce any
tension in our area," he said.
He noted that since the early
19605, U.S. administrations
have refused to normalize rela
tions with Cuba.
