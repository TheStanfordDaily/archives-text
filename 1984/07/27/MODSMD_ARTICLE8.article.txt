# Diablo inspector quits over plant quality control
## 
### 
Washington — A quality
control inspector at a California
nuclear power plant has
resigned, protesting working
conditions and charging that
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. cov
ered up design problems and
ignored his complaints of har
assment by construction
workers.
"My personal safety has been
compromised," the inspector,
Timothy O'Neill, said in a letter
of resignation to the Pullman
Power Products Co., the piping
contractor at the Diablo Canyon
plant. He quit Tuesday, after a
year on the job.
O'Neill, who said he was an
informant for the Nuclear
Regulatory Agency while at the
plant, plans to file an affidavit
today with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission asking
for an investigation. "Licensing
the plant in this atmosphere
would reward management for
inciting criminal harassment and
for ordering a criminal cover
up," the affidavit says.
The commission previously
scheduled a meeting Aug. 2 to
decide whether to allow Diablo
Canyon to operate at full power.
PG&E, owner of the plant, near

San Luis Obispo, Calif., is now
permitted to operate the plant
at up to 5 percent of capacity.
O'Neill said in his affidavit
that the Diablo project uses
poor welding procedures and
materials of dubious quality and
that workers have insufficient
training.
Many welded metal studs
holding up pipe supports have
an excessive carbon content and
could become brittle, O'Neill
said. The supports buttress
pipes carrying water to cool the
reactor during an emergency, he
said.
O'Neill said that his com
plaints that steel used in welding
was of insufficient quality were
ignored and that he had been
criticized as a "nit-picker" for
enforcing quality standards.
"Every step along the way I was
told there wasn't a problem," he
said.
PG&E insisted its personnel
had responded to O'Neill's
complaints with careful in
quiries but found his charges in
valid.
