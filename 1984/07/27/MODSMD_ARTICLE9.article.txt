# 'Norman Bates' dies
## Ed Gein's macabre killings inspired book, film 
### 
Ed Gein, the soft-spoken farmhand whose
macabre exploits even Alfred Hitchcock had to
minimize when he made the film "Psycho,"
died yesterday in one of the Wisconsin mental
institutions that had been his home for nearly
30 years.
The small-town handyman with a bizarre
fascination for his dead mother was 77. He had
been found innocent by reason of insanity the
only time he was tried, on a single murder
count.
It was a finding that no one could dispute.
Gein was 51 in 1957 when his battered
pickup truck was seen near the Plainfield, Wis.,
hardware store operated by a missing 58-year
old widow.
A deputy sheriff drove to Gein's small farm
to question him but found no one at home.
When the deputy returned later and still got no
answer, he looked into a shed at the side of the
house. There he saw the missing woman,
Bernice Worden, hanging by her heels. She
had been decapitated and her body "dressed
out like a deer," the officer said.
Her heart was found in a coffee can on a
stove in the house.
As police moved through the house, they
found nine death masks, all covered with
human skin. Strips of human skin had been
used tc cover chairs and flesh had been used as
the head of a drum. There was even a bowl fas
hioned from a human skull.
In all, Gein had collected pieces of 15
bodies, all of them women. He had killed two
of the women (the second was a tavern owner
named Mary Hogan); the others came from
freshly dug graves he had violated.

All of the women, like Gein's mother, who
died in 1945, were middle-aged.
Gein's trial proved a psychiatric field day.
Doctors testified, generally, that the slight bac
helor, who often served as a baby-sitter for
townspeople, had secretly wanted to be a wo
man. After his mother's death, he tried to turn
into one. He was committed to Central State
Hospital as incurably insane.
But in 1974 Gein sought a sanity hearing
and asked for his freedom. Circuit Judge
Robert Gollmar denied the petition and sent
Gein back to Central State. In 1978, he was
transferred to the Mendota Mental Institute,
where he died of cancer.
Authorities testified at the 1974 hearing that
Gein was never a problem in prison, although
he reacted poorly to other inmates. He worked
as a carpenter, mason and hospital attendant
while at Central State.
In the film, based on the book by Robert
Bloch, Hitchcock had "Norman Bates"
(portrayed by Anthony Perkins), Gein's film
counterpart, wearing his mother's clothes.
Gein admitted to not only wearing women's
clothes but their skins.
Most people, Bloch said, were not aware
that "Psycho" was based on a book. When
they find that the film, in which the co-star
(Janet Leigh) is hacked to death in a bloody
shower, was adapted from Bloch's words,
many tell him after seeing the picture that they
were unable to take a shower for many years.
"I tell people," he said, "they're lucky I
didn't kill her on the toilet."
