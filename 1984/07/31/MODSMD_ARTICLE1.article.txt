# Stanford swimmers yield silvers

The first two days of Olympic swimming com
petition in Los Angeles saw Stanford sophomores
Susan Rapp and Pablo Morales both win silver
medals, but also 'saw Cardinals
John Moffet and Jeff Kostoff come
up empty.
Moffet and Morales both entered the
Olympics as world record-holders, but while
Morales bettered his previous world mark and ■■
Moffet briefly set a new Olympic record, both I
were surpassed by other swimmers who shat- '
tered the world records in their events.
Moffet's groin injury and fifth-place finish in
the 100-meter breaststroke made Sunday a
down day for Stanford fans, but yesterday
proved to be brighter. Rapp, who had set an
American record in winning the Olympic Trials
in Indianapolis last month, broke that American '
record last night with a time of 2:31.15 to finish
second in the 200-meter breaststroke.
Anne Ottenbritene of Canada won the race
with a time of 2:30.38.
Rapp was well behind through the first 100
meters, but after the second turn she began to
make her move up toward the leaders. She passed
Belgium's Ingrid Lempereur in the last 25 meters,

but ran out of pool in her bid to catch Ottenbrite.
Rapp had been picked to finish third, with Ot
tenbrite second, but pre-race favorite Hiroko
Nagasaki of Japan swam a poor race and finished
out of the money.
Some might call Morales' silver in the 100-
meter butterfly yesterday a disappointment. He
had been the world record-holder coming into the
Games, based on his 53.38 time at the U.S. Olym
i pic trials last month, but West German Michael
I Gross shattered that mark with a 53.08 clock-
Iing to take the gold.
Gross took an early lead on the first of the
two laps, but Morales came off the wall
strong and caught him midway through the
final 50. After taking a slight lead, Morales
tried to move to the right side of his lane in an
effort to "draft" the 6-7 West German — have
Gross help "break" the water over the last 20
meters.
The strategic move failed. Gross was swim
j ming on the right side of his lane, making draft-
J ing impossible, and the move may have cost
Morales the fraction of a second that he lost by.
He finished in 53.23, also under his previous
record.
"I swam my best time and got beat by a great


ne^ r " ca P ac crowd of 78,265, the largest ever to attend a soccer game in
North America, jammed Stanford Stadium Sunday night for the opening

ceremonies of the Olympic Soccer Tournament and the U.S.-Costa Rica game.

athlete," Morales said.
Moffet swam a 1:02.16 clock
ing in the preliminaries of the
100 breaststroke, setting a new
Olympic record and falling only
three-hundredths of a second
off the world record he set at the
trials, but he reinjured his leg
when he pushed off the wall at
the halfway point of the race.
"As the day went on," he said
afterward, "I could hardly even
walk."

He made a game attempt in
the finals, but was slowed con
siderably by the injury. Moffet
finished fifth in 1:03.29, far be
hind American teammate Steve
Lundquist, whose 1:01.65
clocking enabled him to
recapture the world record.
.The injury was particularly
disappointing for the Stanford
junior. In 1980 Moffet was the
youngest member of the U.S.
team at 16, but the boycott that
year prevented him from
gaining a medal in Moscow.
Moffet also qualified for the
200 breaststroke, but it is ques

tionable whether he will be
recovered in time for the race
on Thursday.
•
"I kind of feel like nine years
of training has gone, down the
drain," he said. "This is what I
had been training for and I was
ready. I'll just have to put it to
gether and look forward to '88.
Right now I feel like I'm in
limbo, but hopefully I can
bounce back and have a good
swim on Thursday."
Kostoff s sixth-place finish in
the 400-meter individual med
ley was the biggest in a series of

disappointments for the sopho
more in 1984. He was expected
to be a triple threat in the 400
and 1500-meter freestyle events
as well, but failed to qualify in
the trials.
In addition to Moffet's bid for
a medal in the 200 breaststroke
Thursday, Rapp will go for her
second medal in the 100
breaststroke the same day.
Morales will try for a gold in the
200 butterfly Friday and will
swim the 200 IM Saturday, the
last day of swimming competi
tion.
