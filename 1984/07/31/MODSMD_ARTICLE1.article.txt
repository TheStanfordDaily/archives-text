# Stanford swimmers yield silvers

The first two days of Olympic swimming com
petition in Los Angeles saw Stanford sophomores
Susan Rapp and Pablo Morales both win silver
medals, but also 'saw Cardinals
John Moffet and Jeff Kostoff come
up empty.
Moffet and Morales both entered the
Olympics as world record-holders, but while
Morales bettered his previous world mark and ■■
Moffet briefly set a new Olympic record, both I
were surpassed by other swimmers who shat- '
tered the world records in their events.
Moffet's groin injury and fifth-place finish in
the 100-meter breaststroke made Sunday a
down day for Stanford fans, but yesterday
proved to be brighter. Rapp, who had set an
American record in winning the Olympic Trials
in Indianapolis last month, broke that American '
record last night with a time of 2:31.15 to finish
second in the 200-meter breaststroke.
Anne Ottenbritene of Canada won the race
with a time of 2:30.38.
Rapp was well behind through the first 100
meters, but after the second turn she began to
make her move up toward the leaders. She passed
Belgium's Ingrid Lempereur in the last 25 meters,

but ran out of pool in her bid to catch Ottenbrite.
Rapp had been picked to finish third, with Ot
tenbrite second, but pre-race favorite Hiroko
Nagasaki of Japan swam a poor race and finished
out of the money.
Some might call Morales' silver in the 100-
meter butterfly yesterday a disappointment. He
had been the world record-holder coming into the
Games, based on his 53.38 time at the U.S. Olym
i pic trials last month, but West German Michael
I Gross shattered that mark with a 53.08 clock-
Iing to take the gold.
Gross took an early lead on the first of the
two laps, but Morales came off the wall
strong and caught him midway through the
final 50. After taking a slight lead, Morales
tried to move to the right side of his lane in an
effort to "draft" the 6-7 West German — have
Gross help "break" the water over the last 20
meters.
The strategic move failed. Gross was swim
j ming on the right side of his lane, making draft-
J ing impossible, and the move may have cost
Morales the fraction of a second that he lost by.
He finished in 53.23, also under his previous
record.
"I swam my best time and got beat by a great

North America, jammed Stanford Stadium Sunday night for the opening
