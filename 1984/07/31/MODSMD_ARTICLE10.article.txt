# Walesa to meet with freed Solidarity leaders
## 
### 
Warsaw, Poland (AP) â€” Lech Walesa
founder of the outlawed Solidarity labor
federation, said yesterday he will orga
nize meetings of members being freed
liom prison under a week-old general
amnesty.
The official news agency PAP said yes
terday that 14,488 prisoners had been
set free around the country, including
450 of the 652 political prisoners cov
ered by the amnesty.
Walesa said of the amnesty yesterday
that "it would be like a spoon of tar
poured into a jar of honey'' if under
ground Solidarity figure Bogdan Lis
were not also freed.
Lis, arrested in June, is under investi
gation for treason, a crime not covered
under the amnesty. Lis was a founder of
the underground Solidarity organizing
body known as the Temporary Coordi
nating Commission, formed after the
December 1981 military crackdown that
suppressed the free labor movement.
Another founder, Wladyslaw
Frasyniuk, one of the leading Solidarity
figures released from prison thus far, was
reported missing by his wife yesterday
and reportedly was the subject of a po
lice search in his home city of Wroclaw.

An assistant in the government
spokesman's office, Ryszard Strauss, said
the government had learned Frasvniuk
had gone to a monastery.
Walesa, winner of the 1983 Nobel
Peace Prize, was interviewed by tele
phone from his apartment in the Baltic
port of Gdansk.
He said he was obliged as Solidarity
chairman to organize meetings of the
former internees. Solidarity members
have said privately that several strategy
planning meetings among the former
prisoners had been held since authorities
started releasing them from jail.
Walesa called the amnesty "a step in
the right direction" by the Communist
government, adding:
"If it is followed by the next steps,
mainly union pluralism, we won't have
prisoners after August. If not, we'll have
even more prisoners after August, it will
depend only on the capacity of the police
vans."
August marks the fourth anniversary
of the signing of the Gdansk accords that
ended paralyzing labor strikes around
Poland and legitimized Solidarity, the
only free trade union movement in the
Soviet bloc.
