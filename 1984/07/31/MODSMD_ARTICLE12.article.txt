# COMMENTARY
## Dan Turner Pornography not evil, but not good either 
### 
Like every free-thinking American, I
feel awfully sorry for Vanessa Williams.
However, like most red-blooded males
whose curiosity is slightly more powerful
than their values, I have also seen her
pictures (er, my roommate bought the
magazine . . .)
1 feel sorry for the ex-Miss America
because her career is at an end, and she
will have to deal with the consequences
of this scandal for the rest of her life. 1
don't, however, fall to the temptation of
calling Ms. Williams a "victim." She
rode the seesaw of public opinion of her
own free will, and it brought her down as
low as it had previously raised her up.
Besides, anybody who trusts a guy who
peddles pornographic photos probably
doesn't qualify for the Nobel.
Still, she certainly doesn't deserve the
torment she's going through, and neither
does her family. 1 got a letter the other
day from a friend of mine who lives in
Chappaqua, N.Y. — Vanessa's home
town. It seems the Williams' are being
swamped by reporters. Their phone
never stops ringing, and the police have
set a 24-hour guard on their house. To
make matters worse, some eloquent
humanitarian has spraypainted "Vanessa

Williams is a lesbian slut" all over the
town.
I'm also sorry that this had to happen
to the first black Miss America. As my
friend said in his letter, this situation
"gives all the bigots in America some
thing to be happy about."
Anyway, all of this brings us to the real
subject of this column, which (believe it

/ don't, however, fall to the temptation of calling Ms.
Williams a 'victim/ She rode the seesaw of public
opinion of her own free will, and it brought her down

or not) is pornography. This is the kind
of thing that smart men don't talk about,
because if they say they're for it they get
hate mail from feminists, and if they say
they're against it they're probably lying.
Let's face it, most men don't mind
looking at naked women. Obviously,
though, the issue is not quite as simple as
this. That's where the argument of the
feminists comes in, and it's a good one.

Are women merely to be treated as
sexual playthings? The women plastered
on the pages of Penthouse might as well
be slabs of meat, not living human
beings. When someone admires a
Playboy centerfold, he does not stop to
consider the depths of her personality.
This argument, while certainly true, is
not really very effective. I don't think

anyone judges all of womankind in the
context of a few dirty pictures. The wo
men in pornographic are
definitely portr tyt sex objects, but
sexuality is simply one aspect which all
human beings share — men as well as
women. Pornography is only a way of ex
pressing that sexuality, just as debate is a
way to express intellectual prowess.
Furthermore, the arguments of

feminists on another subject can be used
against them on this one. On the issue of
abortion, it is the contention of most
feminists that a woman has a right to do
whatever she wills with her own body. I
happen to agree. So, if a woman wishes
to pose nude before a camera, isn't that
her right?
Ihroughout this argument I have been
making a pretty big assumption. I assume
it will be understood that what I am
talking about is legal, "non-obscene"
pornography. There is another kind
Child oornography, forced compliance'
brutality in pornography — these are as
offensive as any rape. The people who
buy and sell this kind of filth are sick.
Now that I have finished arguing that
pornography is not "evil," I should have
a more difficult -ne arguir that it is
good, or even necessary.
It isn t. It creates new problems with
out solving old ones. How does one ef
fectively keep it out of the hands of
children? Where does one draw the line
between the acceptable and the obscene?
People who make a living from por
nography are quick to claim that the
percentage of rapes and other sexual of-

fenses has decreased in places where pornography
has been introduced. This claim is plainly false;
for every place where this phenomenon has oc
curred there is another where it has not, and sci
entific evidence has shown that there is no direct
correlation. At best pornography increases mas
turbation, and this can be seen as a sort of "opiate
of the people," since the sexually frustrated can
turn to it for relief. But a sexual dysfunction is a
sexual dysfunction, and it is not cured by pornog
raphy.
I'm leaving you with a very wishy-washy state

ment that pornography isn't bad, but it isn't good
either. Sorry about that.
I will, however, try to say one meaningful thing
before this column ends: I'm a little worried about
the direction that relatively "respectable" girly
magazines like Penthouse seem to be taking. I
hadn't seen a copy of that magazine for about four
years before I looked through the recent Vanessa
Williams issue. I was very surprised at how much
more explicit the magazine has become in that
length of time. Apparently it has become more
profitable to be more explicit, bringing these
magazines quite a bit closer to that line of
obscenity, which none can condone.

sexual dysfunction, and it is not cured by pornog

I'm leaving you with a very wishy-washy state

ment that pornography isn't bad, but it isn't good
either. Sorry about that.
I will, however, try to say one meaningful thing
before this column ends: I'm a little worried about
the direction that relatively "respectable" girly
magazines like Penthouse seem to be taking. I
hadn't seen a copy of that magazine for about four
years before I looked through the recent Vanessa
Williams issue. I was very surprised at how much
more explicit the magazine has become in that
length of time. Apparently it has become more
profitable to be more explicit, bringing these
magazines quite a bit closer to that line of
obscenity, which none can condone.

Like every free-thinking American, I
feel awfully sorry for Vanessa Williams.
However, like most red-blooded males
whose curiosity is slightly more powerful
than their values, I have also seen her
pictures (er, my roommate bought the
magazine . . .)
1 feel sorry for the ex-Miss America
because her career is at an end, and she
will have to deal with the consequences
of this scandal for the rest of her life. 1
don't, however, fall to the temptation of
calling Ms. Williams a "victim." She
rode the seesaw of public opinion of her
own free will, and it brought her down as
low as it had previously raised her up.
Besides, anybody who trusts a guy who
peddles pornographic photos probably
doesn't qualify for the Nobel.
Still, she certainly doesn't deserve the
torment she's going through, and neither
does her family. 1 got a letter the other
day from a friend of mine who lives in
Chappaqua, N.Y. — Vanessa's home
town. It seems the Williams' are being
swamped by reporters. Their phone
never stops ringing, and the police have
set a 24-hour guard on their house. To
make matters worse, some eloquent
humanitarian has spraypainted "Vanessa

Williams is a lesbian slut" all over the
town.
I'm also sorry that this had to happen
to the first black Miss America. As my
friend said in his letter, this situation
"gives all the bigots in America some
thing to be happy about."
Anyway, all of this brings us to the real
subject of this column, which (believe it

/ don't, however, fall to the temptation of calling Ms.
Williams a 'victim/ She rode the seesaw of public

or not) is pornography. This is the kind
of thing that smart men don't talk about,
because if they say they're for it they get
hate mail from feminists, and if they say
they're against it they're probably lying.
Let's face it, most men don't mind
looking at naked women. Obviously,
though, the issue is not quite as simple as
this. That's where the argument of the
feminists comes in, and it's a good one.

Are women merely to be treated as
sexual playthings? The women plastered
on the pages of Penthouse might as well
be slabs of meat, not living human
beings. When someone admires a
Playboy centerfold, he does not stop to
consider the depths of her personality.
This argument, while certainly true, is
not really very effective. I don't think

anyone judges all of womankind in the
context of a few dirty pictures. The wo
men in pornographic are
definitely portr tyt sex objects, but
sexuality is simply one aspect which all
human beings share — men as well as
women. Pornography is only a way of ex
pressing that sexuality, just as debate is a
way to express intellectual prowess.
Furthermore, the arguments of

feminists on another subject can be used
against them on this one. On the issue of
abortion, it is the contention of most
feminists that a woman has a right to do
whatever she wills with her own body. I
happen to agree. So, if a woman wishes
to pose nude before a camera, isn't that
her right?
Ihroughout this argument I have been
making a pretty big assumption. I assume
it will be understood that what I am
talking about is legal, "non-obscene"
pornography. There is another kind
Child oornography, forced compliance'
brutality in pornography — these are as
offensive as any rape. The people who
buy and sell this kind of filth are sick.
Now that I have finished arguing that
pornography is not "evil," I should have
a more difficult -ne arguir that it is
good, or even necessary.
It isn t. It creates new problems with
out solving old ones. How does one ef
fectively keep it out of the hands of
children? Where does one draw the line
between the acceptable and the obscene?
People who make a living from por
nography are quick to claim that the
percentage of rapes and other sexual of-

fenses has decreased in places where pornography
has been introduced. This claim is plainly false;
for every place where this phenomenon has oc
curred there is another where it has not, and sci
entific evidence has shown that there is no direct
correlation. At best pornography increases mas
turbation, and this can be seen as a sort of "opiate
of the people," since the sexually frustrated can
turn to it for relief. But a sexual dysfunction is a
sexual dysfunction, and it is not cured by pornog
raphy.
I'm leaving you with a very wishy-washy state

ment that pornography isn't bad, but it isn't good
either. Sorry about that.
