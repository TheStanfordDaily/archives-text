Turner ignored
his own statement
Dan Turner, in his last
column, "Create a religion,"
was right in one statement —
"It's awfully tempting to adopt a
religion simply because a lot of
other people are following it."
Unfortunately, he seems to have
ignored his own statement, and
accepted the current fad
religion that "there is no such
thing as religious truth . . . truth
is whatever you want it to be."
This seems to me patently ab
surd. Wouldn't it be silly if a
budding young physicist decided
to reject quantum mechanical
theory because "it makes things
too hard and messy for me — I
don't like it"? To be able to
reject it and still maintain his
scientific integrity, he would
have to do exhaustive research
in the field to prove that it
wasn't true. This applies to the
Bible as well — it needs to be
examined closely before one
rejects what it teaches.
For instance, take a look at
the statement about the
paradoxes in Christianity, "How
can a merciful God condemn a
soul to hell for all eternity for
making human mistakes?" First
of all, it is not God's idea to
"zap" anyone and everyone He
can. Instead, his plan was to
forgive each individual for the
sins (or "human mistakes") they
have committed. That was the
reason for the death of his son,
Jesus. (See John 3:16.)
However, man was also given
free choice by God. He should
naturally want to listen to God,
for the God who created him
also knows how his life here can
be most happy. (Note that
"good" and "happy" are not
mutually exclusive!) However,
if a man wants to reject God's
proper place and make himself
god of his own life, God will al
low that — he will not take away
his right to free choice. Thus,
the man condemns himself to
hell, not God. He wouldn't even
want to go to heaven! He has
committed the sin of Satan —
setting himself up as God.
There are several other points
which could be argued, but,
even better, read the Bible it
self. There are boggling
paradoxes — try, "For whoever
wishes to save his life shall lose
it, but whoever loses his life for

my sake, he is the one who will
save it"! (Luke 9:24) If one is
going to reject Christianity, at
least do so truly knowing what it
is that is being rejected. One
may be surprised to find that it
is historically and philosophi
cally true even if it doesn't an
swer "all the questions for you."

Case biased
against Gokcek
This letter is being written in
support of Elmas Gokcek, a
clerical worker formerly
employed in the controller's of
fice. Elmas was a part-time ac
counting assistant who worked
for Stanford for two years.
In October 1983, Elmas
volunteered to testify for a fel
low worker in a grievance
hearing. Within the same month
Elmas was asked to resign her
position despite her good work
record. Suddenly overtime
hours were eliminated. Even
with the threat of departmental
reprimands, Elmas testified.
The hearing officer promised
there would be no retaliation
In January and February,
Elmas requested vacation and
received no response. A regu
larly scheduled performance
evaluation was denied by the
department in March. In April,
with no warning, she was in
formed that her position was
being eliminated due to work
reduction. Elmas, who had
seniority, was laid off in viola
tion of Guide Memo 22.8 Sec
tion 7, Article (a); Article (b)
paragraph (2); Article (c) para
graph (1); Article (d) paragraph
(2). Based on these violations of
University policy, Elmas filed a
grievance. As is the case with
most clerical grievances, where
the University pays for the ar
bitration, this procedure is
biased against her. Clerical
workers are among the un
represented. We have no union
contract. Our positions are un
certain, at best. If one is for
tunate enough to work for an
individual who, based on his
own ethics, is a humanitarian
and practices fair judgment, cer
tain contract benefits are not as
important. But should you work
for those who cater strictly to
the ethics prescribed by Univer
sity management, benefits (like
the union's grievance proce
dure), which include outside ar
bitration, become indispen
sible.
Have you ever heard of a
clerical grievance being won?
The Stanford community must
support Elmas and other un
represented workers in their
struggle for justice. Not only are
they fighting for their survival
within a system stacked against
them, they are also fighting for
the survival of all the un
represented.

Put missiles
out to sea
President Reagan has pro
posed a multibillion dollar effort
to defend the American
homeland against nuclear
missiles. Such a defense is a goal
everyone must desire. However,
my own work in the develop
ment of missiles and ABM sys
tems convinces me that such
defense has, unfortunately, little
prospect of success.
Fortunately there exists a
simple, inexpensive way to
protect the United States from
nuclear attack. Move the land
based missiles, the likely target
of such an attack, out to sea,
away from the population.
Do we need the land-based
missiles to make deterrence

credible? The answer is surely
no. Now that missile accuracy
has reached the point where
silos can be hit, the role of land
based missiles becomes that of a
tempting target, and indeed a
kind of doomsday machine,
since when under attack the
missiles must be launched in or
der to "save" them.
In tact, with the land-based
missiles on the target list, our
only reliable deterrent is the
submarine force. According to
British Admiral Sir James
Eberle, even if the Soviets
launched a first strike, taking
out every U.S. land-based
missile, every airfield, and every
submarine in port, there would
still be enough American war
heads at sea to fire one every 30
seconds for 24 hours. Each of
these warheads is about 10
times as powerful as the Hiro
shima bomb.
A single Trident submarine
carries seven times the total
firepower expended during the
six years of World War 11,
firepower which resulted in the
death of 30 million people.
Clearly, the submarine force we
now have is more than adequate
to serve as a deterrent. Even if
the United States and the Soviet
Union increased their already
bulging nuclear stockpiles 10
times, they could not become
superior to France. France has
seven submarines and could
destroy all the major cities in
both the United States and the
Soviet Union in a single after
noon.
With our land-based missiles
gone and our submarine-based
deterrent secure, no enemy
could limit the damage to his
own territory by attacking us.
