## Journalist to teach here 
### BILL MARTIN 
Former New York Times labor writer A.H.
Raskin will teach a course on labor issues here this
tall under the sponsorship of the Guest Professor
ship Bureau (GPB) and the economics depart
ment.
Raskin s contract will be drawn up this month.
The syllabus and teaching agreement will be ap
proved by the Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
the economics department, the ASSU Senate and
University extradepartmental programs.
Raskin is the first guest professor to visit Stan
ford since the GPB became the subject of a con
troversy during the spring of 1982. The dispute
concerned then-Congressman Paul "Pete" Mc-
Closkey's course on government, which was
criticized by Jewish community leaders and the
ASSU Senate because of McCloskey's alleged
pro-Arab bias.
A moratorium was called on future guest
professorship approvals until the system of invita
tion and course planning could be reviewed.
Apparently, after a year without any guest pro
fessor approvals, the "unofficial moratorium" is
over and Raskin has made it through the prelimi
nary processes necessary to teach here this fall.
Raskin is currently in retirement in Massachu
setts and looking forward to his trip to Stanford.
According to Todd Kerr of the ASSU, Raskin
"is very psyched about coming here."
His course will deal with current labor issues
and will take place during a critical period in the

University's dispute with United Stanford
Workers. The National Labor Relations Board is
expected to rule on the Stanford-USW conflict
this fall, and Raskin's class may gain an interesting
perspective on the University's labor policies.
Course plans are being reviewed by the eco
nomics department.
"We're letting the economics department take
the bull by the horns," Kerr said.
"We've been pursuing Raskin for about a year
and a half," said Kerr. "He is the first one who has
made it through since McCloskey."
Kerr oversees the GPB as ASSU President.
Reid Sherline will be the director of the GPB for
the coming academic year.
According to Kerr, Raskin will receive $12,000
and free housing and will make at least five public
appearances on campus. "He feels this is a
nominal amount," said Kerr.
The class will be offered for four units in eco
nomics and will be open to the entire Stanford
community.
Raskin's fame stems from writing for The New
York Times on labor issues during the 19305. He
joined the Times' staff in 1934 and later became a
member of the newspaper's editorial board.
His work was especially noted during the strikes
of 1934-38, including the "War in the West"
when longshoremen were joined by hundreds of
thousands of union workers in a solidarity move
ment based in San Francisco 50 years ago.
