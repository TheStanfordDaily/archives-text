# Cable system to be upgraded
## 
### LYDIA ROBINSON 
A major conduit project that
will upgrade Stanford's signal
cable system began this week.
Various signal cables in the
conduits — four-inch hollow
plastic pipes where signal cables
are housed — will carry the Re
placement Telephone System,
Stanford University Network
(SUNet), and the Energy Man
agement Control System.
"The installation will create
four to five miles of trench
throughout the University over
a period of time," said Mark
Roberts, acting director of tele
communications.
The pipes will be run from the
Main Quad to Panama Street,
Forsythe Hall to Stanford Press,
and Stern Hall to Terman Engi
neering.
The process of laying conduits
entails digging a six-foot trench
and placing the pipes in the
ground. The pipes are then cov
ered with sand, followed by a

layer of concrete over the top,
and then dirt.
Forty new manholes will dot
the campus along the conduit
alignment. These will allow
access to the cables when
placing the new cable in the
pipes.
"We hope to have part of the
project completed before stu
dents return, but there hasn't
been a fall when some contrac
tor hasn't screwed up," Roberts
said.
The contractor will take as
many precautions as possible to
safeguard pedestrians.
The projected cost of the
project is $4 million. Funding
for the installation, which has
been approved by the Board of
Trustees, will come from the
operating budget.
"Stanford's existing cable is in
total obsolescence. We're going
to spend the money intelligently
now so the system will work
right," Roberts said.
