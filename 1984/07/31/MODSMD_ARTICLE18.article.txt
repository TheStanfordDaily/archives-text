# KZSU — more than just another pretty station

The challenge of radio is to get the audience to sit
down and listen, says Linda Christie, program director
of KZSU.
Very few people listen to the radio," she said.
Its important to think about your audience. "Radio
has a high tune-out rate," said Daryn Kagan, former
news director. "As a reporter you have to know how to
write and you must understand the subject you are
writing about," Kagan explained.
Broadcast writing, she explained, is "like.talking to a
friend."
You can break some of the rules you have learned
in your English classes. Reporters in this medium can
use sentence fragments and clever phrases," Kagan
said.
KZSU is called the "Zoo" because of the variety and
diversity of music its disc jockeys play. In addition, the
station operates on "Zoo time" — things get done
when they get done.
'We try to be on time," Kagan and Christie said.
"Meeting deadlines is one of the most difficult things
about working in a broadcast station," Kagan added.
"Some students feel that we play music to satisfy our
own taste, but I don't think that's true," said Christie.
We try to cater to students' taste. If we do not have a
classical DJ to play classical music, then it is recorded to
meet the needs of that audience," she said.
According to Christie, KZSU is a non-commercial,
educational station. The station's objectives are to pro
vide the foundation for continuous and consistent edu
cational development, staff training and effective man
agement.
During the summer the station operates ) 9 hours per
day, from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. During the regular year, it

broadcasts 24 hours a day, Christie said.
The station's history began in 1944, when Stanford
students established KSU, an AM station for campus
residents. In 1963, the station was converted into
KZSU-FM, with 40 watts of power.
The station now broadcasts 500 watts at 90.1 on the
F-M dial. Its signal reaches as far north as Berkeley and
as far south as San Jose.
Over the years KZSU has won awards from the Na
tional Association of Broadcasters for its public service
coverage.
Most of the DJs at K/.SU are licensed. Licenses are
obtained from the Federal Communication Commis
sion (FCC) by filling out an application form. It takes
four to six weeks to get the official licenses, but a tem
porary one is issued within a shorter period of time.
There is no charge or fee and no test or examination is
required, Kagan and Christie explained.
"It's a real college environment," said Kagan. Radio is
fun and the music sets the mood, she added. The "Zoo"
attracts a different breed from the typical Stanford stu
dent, said Kagan. Few of the students working at the
station are broadcast majors. "The variety makes it in
teresting," she remarked.
There is an opportunity to move up quickly at
KZSU. "We teach interested students how to write
stories and edit news," Kagan said. Ten-week training
sessions teach editing news from the wire service,
recording programs, playing records on the air, DJ
training, and presenting public service announcements.
Skills developed at KZSU can lead to professional
careers in broadcasting because of the "real world" ex
perience the atmosphere provides. "We are trying to

build up local reporting and international affairs,"
Kagan said.
Public atfairs broadcasts and the information services
provide news about consumer affairs, ecology, science,
health, sports events and items from the community
calendar. "The news and sports departments try to
coordinate their programs twice a day," said Kagan.
Students willing to commit themselves to work for
K/.SU must be able to work for the whole quarter and
during midterms and finals, because the radio work
must be done, Christie said.
"Working at K.ZSU is a big responsibility." said
Kagan. "The Daily has a better reputation because it
pays and we don't," she said. "We are a volunteer or
ganization and we cannot make people work or fire
them if they don't. There are a few individuals who are
dedicated — these people are the cream of the crop,"
Kagan said.
Students with technical skills are needed to repair
microphones, lights, headphones and tape decks. The
station invites Stanford students to join the various de
partments.
"In three years we will be competing with The
Daily,'' said Danny Pearl, KZSU's news director. The
station is planning to secure new office equipment and
a computer terminal to help expedite its news reports
and general office procedures. "Mark Lawerence, our
chief manager, is working on getting a computer termi
nal right now," said Christie.
In broadcasting "there is a certain amount of
power," she said. It is possible for the people involved
to gain a lot of prestige. KZSU is a diversified radio sta
tion concerned about informing, enlightening and en
tertaining its listeners and expanding its audience.
