# Summer attracts conventioneers, campers

### VINCE LARKIN 
It's unlikely that you'll see
Olympic soccer players on line
tor fro yo at the Co Po, but you
may bump into a computer
tutor, an incognito executive, or
a cheerleader. These and others
will be at Stanford this summer,
attending some of the myriad
camps and conferences the Uni
versity hosts.
Lois Fariello, Director of
Conferences at Stanford, ex
plained that this summer is es
pecially busy. The University
will welcome 14,000 summer
visitors to 158 different pro
grams. The guests will stay for
periods ranging from one night
to 12 weeks.
Financially, the University
gains. The conferences bring in
$3,365,000 in revenue during
the two-and-one-half-month
summer period.
Summer programs are
profitable enough to subsidize
some ot the administrative costs
for the regular academic year.
Summer programs also provide
jobs for the housekeeping and
food service staffs and for fac
ulty children and students.
Faculty members also benefit.
Many teach in the programs.
1 hrough conferences and semi
nars, others have the opportu
nity to share ideas with
educators and professionals in
related fields. Some of these
programs are the Stanford Ex
ecutive Program, the Micro
computer Institute for
Educators, and the Computer

Tutor Camp.
The program has wide
ranging benefits to the Univer
sity, even in terms of recruit
ment. Fariello sees the program
as a recruitment tool for many
future students. "Some of the
students whom I've hired were
asked: Why did you come to
Stanford? They replied that
their fathers attended profes
sional programs on campus.
They liked what they saw and
encouraged their children to ap
ply,"she said.
Another advantage is good
public relations. Many of the
conferences are well-publicized
within industrial and profes
sional circles.
The best example of good
P R. is this year's Olympic activ
ity on campus. The University
housed the entire Norwegian
Olympic team and the
Australian swimming team.
Branner Hall is home of the
Olympic Soccer teams that are
competing in the Olympic
Tournament which started Sun
day.
Fariello said the University
will not gain financially from the
Olympic competition. "We're
really not going to make any
money off Branner because
we've had to set it aside for too
long a time without enough par
ticipants," she said.
"There are some days when
we re only feeding 11 people for
lunch and dinner in a large
residence hall. We know it's not
going to be a profit-making en-

terprise,"she explained.
Nevertheless, the notoriety
and publicity from playing host
to an Olympic Village has
benefits that far outweigh
finances. "The glory and experi
ence of having the groups here
is indeed worthwhile,"she said.
She hopes that the athletic de-

partment will gain from the
Olympic experience in terms of
income and facility improve
ments.
Money may be important in
dealing with programs but the
truth is that programs must be
academically related. They must
have a sponsorship from a cer
tain department. In many cases
the departments set up certain
criteria for approval of sponsor
ships. The departments them
selves can gain income by charg
ing registration fees and keeping

it in the University accounts.
This helps in research, materials
and aid to students.
The conference office ar
ranges fees, banquets and tours.
"We can help them with the an
swer they need to make their
program a success/'said
Fariello.
Stanford is not new to the
summer program business. "We
can trace this back to 1947,"
said Fariello. She said the Uni
versity hosted only a few confer
ences each summer until the
mid-19605, when the size of the
summer program began to in
crease.
Today summer conferences
are big business throughout
higher education. They are not,
however, without their risks.
Fariello said the University of
Southern Oregon has faced a
lawsuit over its summer activi
ties because the motels and
hotels in its area became upset
with its elderhostel program and
the role the school was playing
in the Ashland Shakespeare
Festival.
Fariello said Stanford has
been very careful and fortunate
in building its clientele through
the years. "It's a fine line you
walk and you have to be
sensitive to the groups you ad
mit,"she said.
The University has to main
tain a strictly academic interest.
Fariello noted that some col
leges have ventured into the
tour business. "Some univer
sities depend on that kind of ac

tivity for a whole summer. This
is true of colleges near air
ports," she said.
Fariello does not want Stan
ford to venture into that kind of
activity. "We don't want to be
classified as an inkeeper," she
said. "Unrelated income would
result, and the University would
have to pay taxes on its
facilities. This would defeat our
purpose," she said.
Many companies want to con
duct training sessions on
campus. But the University
denies many of these requests.
"There has to be some input by
a department and some ap
proval of the subject matter,"
said Fariello.
Although Stanford is a
respected role model for many
other colleges in this business, it
does not stand alone. "It's
definitely a buyer's market,"
Fariello said, referring to the
competition among educational
institutions.
In the local area, Stanford
faces stiff competition from
Santa Clara and the two Univer
sity of California campuses in
Berkeley and Santa Cruz.
But Fariello is confident that
Stanford will continue to attract
more summer conferences,
despite the competition.
She believes the University's
location, climate, history, exper
ience and proximity to the City,
the Wine Country and Carmel
contribute to its appeal. In her
words, "Everybody just loves
to come to Stanford."

1 hrough conferences and semi
nars, others have the opportu
nity to share ideas with
educators and professionals in
related fields. Some of these
programs are the Stanford Ex
ecutive Program, the Micro
computer Institute for
Educators, and the Computer

Tutor Camp.
The program has wide
ranging benefits to the Univer
sity, even in terms of recruit
ment. Fariello sees the program
as a recruitment tool for many
future students. "Some of the
students whom I've hired were
asked: Why did you come to
Stanford? They replied that
their fathers attended profes
sional programs on campus.
They liked what they saw and
encouraged their children to ap
ply,"she said.
Another advantage is good
public relations. Many of the
conferences are well-publicized
within industrial and profes
sional circles.
The best example of good
P R. is this year's Olympic activ
ity on campus. The University
housed the entire Norwegian
Olympic team and the
Australian swimming team.
Branner Hall is home of the
Olympic Soccer teams that are
competing in the Olympic
Tournament which started Sun
day.
Fariello said the University
will not gain financially from the
Olympic competition. "We're
really not going to make any
money off Branner because
we've had to set it aside for too
long a time without enough par
ticipants," she said.
"There are some days when
we re only feeding 11 people for
lunch and dinner in a large
residence hall. We know it's not
going to be a profit-making en-

terprise,"she explained.
Nevertheless, the notoriety
and publicity from playing host
to an Olympic Village has
benefits that far outweigh
finances. "The glory and experi
ence of having the groups here
is indeed worthwhile,"she said.
She hopes that the athletic de-

partment will gain from the
Olympic experience in terms of
income and facility improve
ments.
Money may be important in
dealing with programs but the
truth is that programs must be
academically related. They must
have a sponsorship from a cer
tain department. In many cases
the departments set up certain
criteria for approval of sponsor
ships. The departments them
selves can gain income by charg
ing registration fees and keeping

it in the University accounts.
This helps in research, materials
and aid to students.
The conference office ar
ranges fees, banquets and tours.
"We can help them with the an
swer they need to make their
program a success/'said
Fariello.
Stanford is not new to the
summer program business. "We
can trace this back to 1947,"
said Fariello. She said the Uni
versity hosted only a few confer
ences each summer until the
mid-19605, when the size of the
summer program began to in
crease.
Today summer conferences
are big business throughout
higher education. They are not,
however, without their risks.
Fariello said the University of
Southern Oregon has faced a
lawsuit over its summer activi
ties because the motels and
hotels in its area became upset
with its elderhostel program and
the role the school was playing
in the Ashland Shakespeare
Festival.
Fariello said Stanford has
been very careful and fortunate
in building its clientele through
the years. "It's a fine line you
walk and you have to be
sensitive to the groups you ad
mit,"she said.
The University has to main
tain a strictly academic interest.
Fariello noted that some col
leges have ventured into the
tour business. "Some univer
sities depend on that kind of ac

tivity for a whole summer. This
is true of colleges near air
ports," she said.
Fariello does not want Stan
ford to venture into that kind of
activity. "We don't want to be
classified as an inkeeper," she
said. "Unrelated income would
result, and the University would
have to pay taxes on its
facilities. This would defeat our
purpose," she said.
Many companies want to con
duct training sessions on
campus. But the University
denies many of these requests.
"There has to be some input by
a department and some ap
proval of the subject matter,"
said Fariello.
Although Stanford is a
respected role model for many
other colleges in this business, it
does not stand alone. "It's
definitely a buyer's market,"
Fariello said, referring to the
competition among educational
institutions.
In the local area, Stanford
faces stiff competition from
Santa Clara and the two Univer
sity of California campuses in
Berkeley and Santa Cruz.
But Fariello is confident that
Stanford will continue to attract
more summer conferences,
despite the competition.
She believes the University's
location, climate, history, exper
ience and proximity to the City,
the Wine Country and Carmel
contribute to its appeal. In her
words, "Everybody just loves
to come to Stanford."

It's unlikely that you'll see
Olympic soccer players on line
tor fro yo at the Co Po, but you
may bump into a computer
tutor, an incognito executive, or
a cheerleader. These and others
will be at Stanford this summer,
attending some of the myriad
camps and conferences the Uni
versity hosts.
Lois Fariello, Director of
Conferences at Stanford, ex
plained that this summer is es
pecially busy. The University
will welcome 14,000 summer
visitors to 158 different pro
grams. The guests will stay for
periods ranging from one night
to 12 weeks.
Financially, the University
gains. The conferences bring in
$3,365,000 in revenue during
the two-and-one-half-month
summer period.
Summer programs are
profitable enough to subsidize
some ot the administrative costs
for the regular academic year.
Summer programs also provide
jobs for the housekeeping and
food service staffs and for fac
ulty children and students.
Faculty members also benefit.
Many teach in the programs.
