The University filed a lawsuit against Niven's
International Foods last week, attempting to
prevent the only supermarket at Stanford Shop
ping Center from sub-leasing some of its space to
other vendors.
Niven's is planning to open a Mrs. Fields
Cookies store and a Cone-a-Copia ice cream shop
in order to attract extra customers to its grocery
store.
The University contends that this will violate
the terms of its lease, and is asking for an injunc
tion barring Niven's from opening the cookie and
ice cream shops. Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Eugene Premo last week rejected the
University's request for a temporary restraining
order, but set a preliminary hearing on the re
quested injunction for Aug. 13.
In a memorandum filed in court last week, the
University contended "Niven's intends to breach
its lease," and said "Stanford will be 'irreparably
injured' if an injunction" is not issued.
"Stanford has a very large investment in its
shopping center," the documents contended, add
ing that Niven's actions "jeopardize Stanford's in

vestment."
The University argued, "A center like Stan
ford's must have a carefully planned, balanced
mix of diverse merchants to survive and prosper.
An unbalanced tenant mix will adversely affect
the center's competitive relation to other shop
ping centers in the Bay Area."
The memo also noted that Stanford rents space
to two other cookie stores â€” a branch of the na
tional David's Cookies chain, and a local opera
tion called Cookie Habit. A statement by Frank
Morrow, the director of real estate for the Univer
sity's investment management organization, said,
"If the defendants proceed, one or both of Stan
ford's current cookie vendor lessees may be
driven out of business."
Jay Barton, the manager of Niven's, said
"There is no violation. Our lease specifically
states that we're entitled to lease space to other
vendors."
Barton said, "Stanford agrees that we can lease
space, but they claim it's not proper usage to lease
to Mrs. Field's."
