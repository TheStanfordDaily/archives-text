# Back to school via Stanford TV network

Mary Lou Allen believes video will
become increasingly important to the
University and its educational programs.
As director of SITN (Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network) and assistant
dean of the School of Engineering, she is
an ardent proponent of increased use of
TV and videotape in education.
According to Allen, "When we talk
about video, we aren't talking about tele
vision in the traditional sense, that is, TV
as entertainment. . . When we talk about
video we are talking about TV in the age
of information, TV as a tool for educa
tion."
SITN broadcasts classes to students in
"TV Land," usually employees of large
corporations who want to get their
masters degree and stay on the job at the
same time.The organizations receiving
SITN range from such corporations as
Hewlett-Packard and Apple Computer
to government agencies, including
NASA-Ames Research Center and
Lawrence Livermore Laboratories.
Allen explained that SITN began
broadcasting instruction to local com
panies in 1969, after the Federal Com
munications Commission gave it
permission to operate four channels.
SITN is a non-academic department of
the School of Engineering and provides

graduate education to several thousand
professional engineers, managers and
staff from 100 Bay Area companies. Stu
dents view classes through a one-way
video and two-way audio system — en
abling students to ask the professor ques
tions.
Signals are relayed from Stanford via
microwave link to a transmitter atop
Black Mountain. The signals are first
converted to ITFS (Instructional Televi
sion Fixed Service) band, then to stan
dard VHF (Very High Frequency). Once
the signals are converted, cable video
\ distribution is used for routing signals to

as many receivers as desired at company\
facilities. Participating organizations
bear the cost of their own receiving class
rooms.
Members of SITN benefit from ex
changes between a great university with
strong programs in engineering and sci
ence. According to Allen, they also "get
professional development, minimizing
commute time and maximizing flexible
integration of work and study." In addi
tion, the School of Engineering receives
enough revenue to pay the equivalent of
30 faculty salaries.
The companies within the 50-mile
broadcast range of Stanford receive up to
four classes per hour transmitted simul
taneously from on-campus classrooms to
the organization sites — SITN provides
150 Stanford courses per year in all fields
of engineering and science.
For local companies which have offices
or divisions beyond the broadcast range,
the University also offers the Tutored
Videotape Instruction (TVI) program.
TVI students at 30 locations are consid-

erea tully participating members of the
campus classes, performing the same
homework assignments and examina
tions, and graded in comparison with the
on-campus students. The TVI program
requires that each company provide a
tutor, approved by the course instructor.
"The tutor attends video-playback
sessions to answer questions and encour
age student discussion," Allen said.
This unique opportunity enables the
employees to "go back to school" with
out giving up their jobs and salaries and
without ever leaving the company
premises. The corporations get
employees who are better qualified for
upper-level jobs and more capable of
serving their company. An added benefit
to the in-class students stems from the
industry expertise and practical applica
tions the professionals are able to infuse
into a lecture of otherwise purely theo
retical value.
Three types of programs are available

to companies which pay tuition
equal to the University's standard fees:
the fully matriculated graduate students
program, the non-registered graduate
student option, or just auditing. The first
two of these programs are available ex
clusively through the television network.
Allen believes SITN's present capa
bilities may be expanded into a center for
more widely distributed coursework, a
more widely varied range of courses
available through television, and perhaps
even into archives.
She admits, however, that faculty
members see expansion as a threat to
replace them. Allen believes this is one

of the main stumbling blocks to the
future of SITN, and also considers the
notion to be unfounded. "Video should
be viewed as a tool for providing a better
educational experience, rather than as an
obstacle," Allen said. "Faculty should
see it as a way to enhance effectiveness
and increase productivity."
Even though there are barriers to
broadening the scope of SITN, plans are
being made to expand the television net
work to cable. Although the final deci
sion has yet to be reached, Allen
explained that, "Stanford is part of a
group of communities . . . seeking cable
services. We have been involved in a
franchising process. Four potential ven
dors have submitted proposals . . . Stan
ford has analyzed all the bids . . . and is
part of a working group with other com
munities, whose ultimate purpose is to
recommend a vendor."
Allen believes that ultimately "video
and computers will affect our community
(Stanford) by overcoming the inconveni
ence of time and space. We will increase
our access to information. We will im
prove our ability to observe the world, to
communicate, and preserve informa
tion."

Signals are relayed from Stanford via
microwave link to a transmitter atop
Black Mountain. The signals are first
converted to ITFS (Instructional Televi
sion Fixed Service) band, then to stan
dard VHF (Very High Frequency). Once
the signals are converted, cable video
\ distribution is used for routing signals to

as many receivers as desired at company\
facilities. Participating organizations
bear the cost of their own receiving class
rooms.
Members of SITN benefit from ex
changes between a great university with
strong programs in engineering and sci
ence. According to Allen, they also "get
professional development, minimizing
commute time and maximizing flexible
integration of work and study." In addi
tion, the School of Engineering receives
enough revenue to pay the equivalent of
30 faculty salaries.
The companies within the 50-mile
broadcast range of Stanford receive up to
four classes per hour transmitted simul
taneously from on-campus classrooms to
the organization sites — SITN provides
150 Stanford courses per year in all fields
of engineering and science.
For local companies which have offices
or divisions beyond the broadcast range,
the University also offers the Tutored
Videotape Instruction (TVI) program.
TVI students at 30 locations are consid-

erea tully participating members of the
campus classes, performing the same
homework assignments and examina
tions, and graded in comparison with the
on-campus students. The TVI program
requires that each company provide a
tutor, approved by the course instructor.
"The tutor attends video-playback
sessions to answer questions and encour
age student discussion," Allen said.
This unique opportunity enables the
employees to "go back to school" with
out giving up their jobs and salaries and
without ever leaving the company
premises. The corporations get
employees who are better qualified for
upper-level jobs and more capable of
serving their company. An added benefit
to the in-class students stems from the
industry expertise and practical applica
tions the professionals are able to infuse
into a lecture of otherwise purely theo
retical value.
Three types of programs are available

to companies which pay tuition
equal to the University's standard fees:
the fully matriculated graduate students
program, the non-registered graduate
student option, or just auditing. The first
two of these programs are available ex
clusively through the television network.
Allen believes SITN's present capa
bilities may be expanded into a center for
more widely distributed coursework, a
more widely varied range of courses
available through television, and perhaps
even into archives.
She admits, however, that faculty
members see expansion as a threat to
replace them. Allen believes this is one

of the main stumbling blocks to the
future of SITN, and also considers the
notion to be unfounded. "Video should
be viewed as a tool for providing a better
educational experience, rather than as an
obstacle," Allen said. "Faculty should
see it as a way to enhance effectiveness
and increase productivity."
Even though there are barriers to
broadening the scope of SITN, plans are
being made to expand the television net
work to cable. Although the final deci
sion has yet to be reached, Allen
explained that, "Stanford is part of a
group of communities . . . seeking cable
services. We have been involved in a
franchising process. Four potential ven
dors have submitted proposals . . . Stan
ford has analyzed all the bids . . . and is
part of a working group with other com
munities, whose ultimate purpose is to
recommend a vendor."
Allen believes that ultimately "video
and computers will affect our community
(Stanford) by overcoming the inconveni
ence of time and space. We will increase
our access to information. We will im
prove our ability to observe the world, to
communicate, and preserve informa
tion."
