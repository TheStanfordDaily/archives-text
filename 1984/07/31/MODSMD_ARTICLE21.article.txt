## Milton Friedman analyzes current deficit, economy 
### VINCE LARKIN 
San Francisco — Reduction
of the deficit, control of infla
tion, and the eventual abolish
ment ot the Federal Reserve
System are all attainable goals,
said Nobel laureate economist
Milton Friedman Friday after
noon.
Friedman, a popular author,
lecturer and Senior Fellow at
the Hoover Institute, told a
capacity crowd at the Common
wealth Club that the actual rate
of monetary growth for the past
eight months has been at about
the right level and has been
relatively steady. Although he is
normally very critical of the
Federal Reserve and its policies,
Friedman approves of its cur
rent policies. "It's been a very
unusual period for the Fed," he
proclaimed, to his audience's
amusement.
"If you look at the record,
you will find that monetary
urowth for the last seven or

eight months has been relatively
stable and at about the right rate
for this stage of the disinflation
process," Friedman said. "It has
been somewhere around 7 per-

cent. That's too high for the
long run. We must keep it there.
If money growth were to be
kept at 7 percent, we would he
heading for a long-term infla
tion rate of about the same

level, of about 7 or 8 percent,"
he added.
"That's much too high,"
Friedman said. "However, if
you take into account that we
are coming down from an infla
tion rate of 14 or 15 percent, it's
not inappropriate for the mo
ment."
Friedman would prefer a
long, steady decline in the infla
tion rate instead of a sudden,
sharp reduction. "What we
would really like to see is 7 per
cent this year, 6 percent next
year, 5 percent the following
year. 4 percent the year after
that, 3 percent the following
year, until you get it down to 2
percent and hold it there. At
which point abolish the Federal
Reserve." he said.
To the delight of his audience,
Friedman proclaimed, "Replace
it with a computer."
Friedman tends to shy away
from predictions. But he ad
mitted he is much better at

predicting the consequences of
what the Federal Reserve does
than what it will do.
The Nobel prize-winner also
discussed the federal budget. He
did not hesitate to place blame
for the nation's deficit. "The
real cost of government is what
government spends," he said.
He is opposed to an increase
in taxes as an answer to the
problem. "If imposing taxes
were the way to treat the deficit,
we wouldn't have a deficit," he
said.
"What have we been doing
for the past 30 years? We've
been imposing higher and
higher taxes, and that hasn't
kept us from having a deficit,"
Friedman said. He argued that
the only way to limit the deficit
effectively is to cut overall gov
ernment spending.
Friedman said he is con
cerned that many Americans
believe inflation is endemic to
our economic character. He sees

a need to refute this belief.
Friedman also tried to refute
the idea that all economists are
pessimistic. He quoted his
friend Arthur Burns, a former
chairman of the Fed who is cur
rently ambassador to Germany,
who told Friedman that
Americans worry about their
economy, and reasonably, but in
comparison to European prob
lems our economy is vibrant and
has the potential for many great
things.
Friedman said the U.S. has
added 17 million jobs, during
the past 10 years, while Europe
has no more people employed
today than it did ten years ago.
He closed with a quote from
Burns: "If we can hold down
government spending and let
the energy and initiative of the
American people exercise its
full potential, we should have no
reason to be concerned about
the long-term future we are be
queathing to our children."
