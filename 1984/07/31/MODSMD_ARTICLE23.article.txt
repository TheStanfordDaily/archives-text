# Davis scores twice in 3-0 U.S. victory
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
For the past 10 days, United States
soccer coach Alkis Panagoulias has been
telling anyone willing to listen that the
U.S. must start learning to appreciate the
game of soccer, the world's most popular
game, and he has presented the U.S.
Olympic Team as the men who will
spread the word.
Sunday night Panagoulias' team made
a lot of converts. A crowd of 78,265 —
the largest ever to watch a soccer game in
the United States — packed Stanford
Stadium and saw the Americans ab
solutely dominate Costa Rica, shutting
out the Central Americans, 3-0.
For anyone who is looking for an indi
vidual personality for Americans to iden
tify with, midfielder Ricky Davis may
just be the man. Davis scored the
Americans' first goal 23 minutes into the
first half and then ended any doubt about
the outcome with his second tally of the
night with less than four minutes left in
the contest.
Davis may be the right person for the
task. He's a clean-cut, All-American
looking guy, maybe a little on the small
side at 5-8 and 155 pounds, but size
aside, Davis sounds like an Olympic star
should.
'There's no greater honor than
representing your country," he said after
the game. "I'd be just as happy if some
one else scored the goals. My goals were
the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of
guys. Sure our offense was good, but
don't forget that their score was zero. We
have to congratulate the whole team. It's

red, white and blue all the way, baby."
Davis' first goal came off a direct free
kick following a tripping call against
Costa Rican midfielder Alvaro Solano.
U.S. forward Steve Moyers was injured
on the play, and the game was halted for
a few minutes as trainers tended to
Moyers.
When play resumed, the ball was
placed approximately one yard away
from the left top corner of the penalty
area. The Costa Ricans formed a wall in
front of the goal to try to prevent a direct
shot, but Davis foiled that strategy. The
San Clemente native drilled a left-footed

shot over the wall and into the upper
right corner of the net to make it 1-0.
Davis said afterward, "I aimed for the
right corner, but I didn't really see it.
When I heard the crowd start celebrat
ing, then 1 figured it was my turn."
The crowd was certainly an important
participant in the evening's events. When
Davis' shot found the nylon netting be
hind Costa Rican goalkeeper Marco An
tonio Rojas, they rose to their feet and
began waving hundreds of American
flags of all sizes.
"In the seven years I've played for na
tional teams, I've never played in front of

such a noisy, supportive crowd in the
United States," Davis said. "We've had
big, noisy crowds, but they were always
the opponents'."
The U.S. coach agreed. "As Ricky
said, I think that this must be the first
time that the U.S. has played in front of a
crowd this big of its own," Panagoulias
remarked. "It's the first really enthusias
tic American international soccer
crowd."
The crowd became even more enthusi
astic 12 minutes later at the 35-minute
