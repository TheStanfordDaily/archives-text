# Davis scores twice in 3-0 U.S. victory
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
For the past 10 days, United States
soccer coach Alkis Panagoulias has been
telling anyone willing to listen that the
U.S. must start learning to appreciate the
game of soccer, the world's most popular
game, and he has presented the U.S.
Olympic Team as the men who will
spread the word.
Sunday night Panagoulias' team made
a lot of converts. A crowd of 78,265 —
the largest ever to watch a soccer game in
the United States — packed Stanford
Stadium and saw the Americans ab
solutely dominate Costa Rica, shutting
out the Central Americans, 3-0.
For anyone who is looking for an indi
vidual personality for Americans to iden
tify with, midfielder Ricky Davis may
just be the man. Davis scored the
Americans' first goal 23 minutes into the
first half and then ended any doubt about
the outcome with his second tally of the
night with less than four minutes left in
the contest.
Davis may be the right person for the
task. He's a clean-cut, All-American
looking guy, maybe a little on the small
side at 5-8 and 155 pounds, but size
aside, Davis sounds like an Olympic star
should.
'There's no greater honor than
representing your country," he said after
the game. "I'd be just as happy if some
one else scored the goals. My goals were
the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of
guys. Sure our offense was good, but
don't forget that their score was zero. We
have to congratulate the whole team. It's

red, white and blue all the way, baby."
Davis' first goal came off a direct free
kick following a tripping call against
Costa Rican midfielder Alvaro Solano.
U.S. forward Steve Moyers was injured
on the play, and the game was halted for
a few minutes as trainers tended to
Moyers.
When play resumed, the ball was
placed approximately one yard away
from the left top corner of the penalty
area. The Costa Ricans formed a wall in
front of the goal to try to prevent a direct
shot, but Davis foiled that strategy. The
San Clemente native drilled a left-footed

shot over the wall and into the upper
right corner of the net to make it 1-0.
Davis said afterward, "I aimed for the
right corner, but I didn't really see it.
When I heard the crowd start celebrat
ing, then 1 figured it was my turn."
The crowd was certainly an important
participant in the evening's events. When
Davis' shot found the nylon netting be
hind Costa Rican goalkeeper Marco An
tonio Rojas, they rose to their feet and
began waving hundreds of American
flags of all sizes.
"In the seven years I've played for na
tional teams, I've never played in front of

such a noisy, supportive crowd in the
United States," Davis said. "We've had
big, noisy crowds, but they were always
the opponents'."
The U.S. coach agreed. "As Ricky
said, I think that this must be the first
time that the U.S. has played in front of a
crowd this big of its own," Panagoulias
remarked. "It's the first really enthusias
tic American international soccer
crowd."

mark when forward Jean Willrich
received a perfect feed from midfielder
Chico Borja, got behind the Costa Rican
defense, and drilled a low shot past
Rojas into the lower right corner of the
goal. Willrich's tally came from about 20
yards out inside the penalty area.
With a 2-0 halftime lead, the
Americans came out in the second half
knowing all they had to do was keep the
Costa Ricans away from goalkeeper
David Brcic. They responded with a solid
defensive performance. Brcic stopped 11
shots in recording the shutout.
The Americans' first priority was to
prevent Costa Rica from getting a clean
shot, clearing the ball whenever they
gained possession near their net. Setting
up scoring opportunities seemed second
ary.

The result may have been slightly on
the boring side for the novice fan, but,
simply put, the strategy worked. Be
tween the 66-minute mark and the 88-
minute mark, Costa Rica did not have a
shot on goal.
Then there was Davis' goal. For a
novice fan wondering why the game was
so low-scoring or for an experienced on
looker noting the outstanding defense, it
was a beautiful play that anyone could
appreciate.
Midfielder Michael Fox, Davis'
brother-in-law, threaded a pass past the
Costa Rican defense to Davis, who out
ran the last defender to get an open shot.
From 12 yards away on the left side, he
fired. The shot landed barely inside the
right post, and the celebration was about
to begin.
If two assists were awarded in soccer
as in hockey, forward Jeff Hooker would
have gotten one as well, as he gained
control of the ball at midfield and head
manned it up to Fox.

Costa Rica did manage two shots in
the last two minutes, but Brcic was equal
to the task, and the U.S. team moved
into a first-place tie with Italy in the D
Group. Italy defeated Egypt in the Rose
Bowl by a 1-0 score, and the Italians will
provide the Americans' next challenge,
as the two teams collide tonight in
Pasadena.
Kevin Crowe, one of the American
defenders who shut down Costa Rica,
said of the Italians, "They're the best in
the world. They'll be coming at us with
more experience and more composure.
We'll have to play to control it more.
We've got to play a straight, simple soc
cer game — and go at them with our
strengths."
Aggressiveness is certainly one of
those strengths. When asked whether the
American team would play the same ag
gressive game against Italy, Panagoulias
replied, "Yes. No matter what I said, the
team would play that way anyway. That's
just the way they play. We will try to be

more conservative against the more ex
perienced teams — like the world
champion Italians."
The winner of tonight's game in
Pasadena will in all likelihood be one of
the two Group D teams to advance lo the
quarterfinals. Though it is possible for
three teams to finish with two victories,
in all probability two wins should be
enough for at least the runner-up spot.
The American team's only other defi
nite game at Stanford will be Thursday
night against Egypt. Should the
Americans manage to win the group,
they would play a quarterfinal match
here Sunday and possibly a semifinal
contest next Tuesday as well.
In the meantime, there are the
memories of an outstanding game before
the largest soccer crowd in American his
tory. As Panagoulias said, "To play in
front of almost 80,000 was a real thrill. I
tell you, I think I'll move to Palo Alto."
Wait till Thursday, Alkis, wait till
Thursday.

said, I think that this must be the first
time that the U.S. has played in front of a
crowd this big of its own," Panagoulias
remarked. "It's the first really enthusias

Rick Davis and some of the 78,265 fans at Stanford Stadium celebrate following Davis' second goal of Sunday's game.
mark when forward Jean Willrich
received a perfect feed from midfielder
Chico Borja, got behind the Costa Rican
defense, and drilled a low shot past
Rojas into the lower right corner of the
goal. Willrich's tally came from about 20
yards out inside the penalty area.
With a 2-0 halftime lead, the
Americans came out in the second half
knowing all they had to do was keep the
Costa Ricans away from goalkeeper
David Brcic. They responded with a solid
defensive performance. Brcic stopped 11
shots in recording the shutout.
The Americans' first priority was to
prevent Costa Rica from getting a clean
shot, clearing the ball whenever they
gained possession near their net. Setting
up scoring opportunities seemed second
ary.

The result may have been slightly on
the boring side for the novice fan, but,
simply put, the strategy worked. Be
tween the 66-minute mark and the 88-
minute mark, Costa Rica did not have a
shot on goal.
Then there was Davis' goal. For a
novice fan wondering why the game was
so low-scoring or for an experienced on
looker noting the outstanding defense, it
was a beautiful play that anyone could
appreciate.
Midfielder Michael Fox, Davis'
brother-in-law, threaded a pass past the
Costa Rican defense to Davis, who out
ran the last defender to get an open shot.
From 12 yards away on the left side, he
fired. The shot landed barely inside the
right post, and the celebration was about
to begin.
If two assists were awarded in soccer
as in hockey, forward Jeff Hooker would
have gotten one as well, as he gained
control of the ball at midfield and head
manned it up to Fox.

Costa Rica did manage two shots in
the last two minutes, but Brcic was equal
to the task, and the U.S. team moved
into a first-place tie with Italy in the D
Group. Italy defeated Egypt in the Rose
Bowl by a 1-0 score, and the Italians will
provide the Americans' next challenge,
as the two teams collide tonight in
Pasadena.
Kevin Crowe, one of the American
defenders who shut down Costa Rica,
said of the Italians, "They're the best in
the world. They'll be coming at us with
more experience and more composure.
We'll have to play to control it more.
We've got to play a straight, simple soc
cer game — and go at them with our
strengths."
Aggressiveness is certainly one of
those strengths. When asked whether the
American team would play the same ag
gressive game against Italy, Panagoulias
replied, "Yes. No matter what I said, the
team would play that way anyway. That's
just the way they play. We will try to be

more conservative against the more ex
perienced teams — like the world
champion Italians."
The winner of tonight's game in
Pasadena will in all likelihood be one of
the two Group D teams to advance lo the
quarterfinals. Though it is possible for
three teams to finish with two victories,
in all probability two wins should be
enough for at least the runner-up spot.
The American team's only other defi
nite game at Stanford will be Thursday
night against Egypt. Should the
Americans manage to win the group,
they would play a quarterfinal match
here Sunday and possibly a semifinal
contest next Tuesday as well.
In the meantime, there are the
memories of an outstanding game before
the largest soccer crowd in American his
tory. As Panagoulias said, "To play in
front of almost 80,000 was a real thrill. I
tell you, I think I'll move to Palo Alto."
Wait till Thursday, Alkis, wait till
Thursday.
For the past 10 days, United States
soccer coach Alkis Panagoulias has been
telling anyone willing to listen that the
U.S. must start learning to appreciate the
game of soccer, the world's most popular
game, and he has presented the U.S.
Olympic Team as the men who will
spread the word.
Sunday night Panagoulias' team made
a lot of converts. A crowd of 78,265 —
the largest ever to watch a soccer game in
the United States — packed Stanford
Stadium and saw the Americans ab
solutely dominate Costa Rica, shutting
out the Central Americans, 3-0.
For anyone who is looking for an indi
vidual personality for Americans to iden
tify with, midfielder Ricky Davis may
just be the man. Davis scored the
Americans' first goal 23 minutes into the
first half and then ended any doubt about
the outcome with his second tally of the
night with less than four minutes left in
the contest.
Davis may be the right person for the
task. He's a clean-cut, All-American
looking guy, maybe a little on the small
side at 5-8 and 155 pounds, but size
aside, Davis sounds like an Olympic star
should.
'There's no greater honor than
representing your country," he said after
the game. "I'd be just as happy if some
one else scored the goals. My goals were
the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of
guys. Sure our offense was good, but
don't forget that their score was zero. We
have to congratulate the whole team. It's

red, white and blue all the way, baby."
Davis' first goal came off a direct free
kick following a tripping call against
Costa Rican midfielder Alvaro Solano.
U.S. forward Steve Moyers was injured
on the play, and the game was halted for
a few minutes as trainers tended to
Moyers.
When play resumed, the ball was
placed approximately one yard away
from the left top corner of the penalty
area. The Costa Ricans formed a wall in
front of the goal to try to prevent a direct
shot, but Davis foiled that strategy. The
San Clemente native drilled a left-footed

shot over the wall and into the upper
right corner of the net to make it 1-0.
Davis said afterward, "I aimed for the
right corner, but I didn't really see it.
When I heard the crowd start celebrat
ing, then 1 figured it was my turn."
The crowd was certainly an important
participant in the evening's events. When
Davis' shot found the nylon netting be
hind Costa Rican goalkeeper Marco An
tonio Rojas, they rose to their feet and
began waving hundreds of American
flags of all sizes.
"In the seven years I've played for na
tional teams, I've never played in front of

such a noisy, supportive crowd in the
United States," Davis said. "We've had
big, noisy crowds, but they were always
the opponents'."
The U.S. coach agreed. "As Ricky
said, I think that this must be the first
time that the U.S. has played in front of a
crowd this big of its own," Panagoulias
remarked. "It's the first really enthusias
