Led by goal-scorers Uwe
Rahn and Andreas Brehme, the
West German Olympic Soccer
Team won its opening contest of
the Olympic tournament by
shutting out Morocco 2-0 last
night, in front of 23,228 fans at
Stanford Stadium.
The Germans' first goal came
with just over a minute remain
ing in the first half. Rudolf
Brommer fed Rahn directly in
front of the net, and Rahn
responded by putting the ball
home from only six yards out.
Bommer commented on the
goal, "There was a cross. I tried
to kick it in the goal, but it went
over to Rahn, who put it in."
The West Germans' second
goal was slightly easier. Moroc
can goalkeeper Badou Ezzaki
was whistled for a foul in front
of the net against Dieter
Schatzschneider. A penalty kick
was awarded, and Brehme came
through by drilling the ball into
the right side of the net at
52:10.
"It was a very justified
penalty kick," Brehme said af
terward. "There should have
been more penalty kicks before

that. I'm very glad I scored.''
Seven minutes later Brehme
had another scoring opportu
nity, but this time hit the cross
bar with the shot.
The only other fireworks
came just 35 seconds from the
end of the contest, when
Morocco's Mostafa El Biyaz
was sent off with a red card for
unsportsmanlike conduct.
The West Germans outshot
the Moroccans, 15-8. Morocco
committed 21 fouls in the con
test, while West Germany com
mitted only four.
West German goalie Bernd
Franke was untested in record
ing the shutout, having to make
only two stops all night. His
Moroccan counterpart, Ezzaki,
stopped nine shots on the eve
ning.
West German Coach Erich
Ribbeck commented afterward,
"The first game is always diffi
cult. The two teams must get a
feeling for each other, but I feel
we deserved to win and that we
had more chances to win."
West Germany plays Brazil
tomorrow here in what looks to
be the key game in Group C. "I
personally have not seen the
Brazilian team," Ribbeck said.
