# Kennedy speaks at GOP hearings
## 
### BILL MARTIN with wire reports 
University President
Donald Kennedy testified at
controversial unofficial Re
publican platform hearings
yesterday in Washington, on
behalf of the Association of
American Universities and
the National Association of
State Universities and Land-
Grant Colleges.
The hearings, put together
by six liberal Republican
senators, are being held out
of concern that the Republi
can National Committee's
decision not to hold official
platform hearings this year
would alienate a large num
ber of voters.
The Republican platform
is being written in private by
GOP leaders and White
House aides. Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.) claimed
this could cost the party
votes and organized the
group which held the
hearings.
Conservative groups
within the party criticized
Weicker's effort to hold his
own hearings. Weicker was
accused of leading the unaut
horized sessions as a "cheap
media stunt" by GOP activist
John Dolan, the chairman of
the National Conservative
Political Action Committee.
"Help the Republican

Party by leaving it," Dolan
urged the sponsors of the
hearings.
Weicker responded to the
attack by saying, "Well,
Merry Christmas to you,
too."
Kennedy, meanwhile,
ignored the objections and
took the opportunity to ex
press his views to representa
tives of the party widely ex
pected to win in November.
He lauded the administra
tion's general support for the
physical sciences, but went
on to criticize its view of the
future. He called for a new
commitment to aid in build
ing modern research
facilities, buying research in
strumentation, funding
graduate education, and pro
viding support for young fac
ulty.
"I regret that much of
what I have to say today is
worrisome," he told the
committee. "(We) are ap
proaching a crisis in our abil
ity to perform increasingly
sophisticated and costly re
search and to train the next
generation of scientists," he
said.
"How, one might ask, can
a nation which just swept the
Nobel research awards — a
nation whose scientific
supremacy is conceded everywhere —
be in such a predicament? The short
answer is that we are undercapi
talized.
"The great achievements of the
moment we owe largely to the pru
dent investments of the past; but for
too long, we have not replenished that
depleting scientific base."
"As a nation, Kennedy explained,
"we have temproarily lost sight of the
distinction between operating and
capital support. Thus, we have failed
to commit ourselves to a continuing
investment in the raw materials of re
search and education."
"Unless we make that commitment
... a research enterprise that is une
qualled in the world may soon court
mediocrity.'"
Kennedy blamed the problems on
the Ford administration, saying they
are symptomatic of a country that
keeps a strong industrial base, but
neglects to improve it.
He then outlined a four-point set of
propositions emphasizing advance re
search training through academic re
search, federal responsibility for
university-based research, an inno

vative reserch enterprise "at the high
est levels of creativity, imagination,
and intellectual strength," and sup
port for the "quality of the scholars
who do the work and of the students
who are educated by them."
"What 1 have been talking to you
about amounts to nothing less than
the re-endowment of basic science in
this country," he concluded. "If you
believe that the two-thirds of our na
tion s basic research that is done in
these places is essential to this soci
ety's innovative potential and growth
. . . then you should adopt this re
endowment as a fundamental goal."
Kennedy served in the Carter Ad
ministration as head of the Food and
Drug Administration.
The hearings were described as
"well-attended, but fiery."
Weicker, saying it was the intention
of party leaders to see a platform en
tirely supportive of the president
"slipped through in Dallas," said:
"The day of one voicfe being able to
speak for all is long gone in light of
today s diverse, informed electorate."
Weicker was joined in sponsoring
the hearings by Senators Charles
McC. Mathias of Maryland, John
Chafee of Rhode Island. Robert Staf
ford of Vermont, Mark Hatfield of
Oregon and Mark Andrews of North
Dakota.
