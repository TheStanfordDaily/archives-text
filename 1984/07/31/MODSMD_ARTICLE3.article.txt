# Kennedy speaks at GOP hearings

### BILL MARTIN with wire reports 
University President
Donald Kennedy testified at
controversial unofficial Re
publican platform hearings
yesterday in Washington, on
behalf of the Association of
American Universities and
the National Association of
State Universities and Land-
Grant Colleges.
The hearings, put together
by six liberal Republican
senators, are being held out
of concern that the Republi
can National Committee's
decision not to hold official
platform hearings this year
would alienate a large num

The Republican platform
is being written in private by
GOP leaders and White
House aides. Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.) claimed
this could cost the party
votes and organized the
group which held the
hearings.
Conservative groups
within the party criticized
Weicker's effort to hold his
own hearings. Weicker was
accused of leading the unaut

media stunt" by GOP activist
John Dolan, the chairman of
the National Conservative
Political Action Committee.
"Help the Republican

Party by leaving it," Dolan
urged the sponsors of the
hearings.
Weicker responded to the
attack by saying, "Well,
Merry Christmas to you,
too."
Kennedy, meanwhile,
ignored the objections and
took the opportunity to ex
press his views to representa
tives of the party widely ex
pected to win in November.
He lauded the administra
tion's general support for the
physical sciences, but went
on to criticize its view of the
future. He called for a new
commitment to aid in build
ing modern research
facilities, buying research in
strumentation, funding
graduate education, and pro
viding support for young fac
ulty.
"I regret that much of
what I have to say today is
worrisome," he told the
committee. "(We) are ap
proaching a crisis in our abil
ity to perform increasingly
sophisticated and costly re
search and to train the next
generation of scientists," he
said.
"How, one might ask, can
a nation which just swept the
Nobel research awards â€” a
nation whose scientific
