# Stanford Opening Ceremonies thrill 78,000
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
For those who were not fortunate
enough to be able to be in the Los An
geles Memorial Coliseum for Saturday
evening's opening ceremonies, Stanford
put on its own version the following even
ing, and the result, though perhaps not
as grandiose, produced a similar number
of goosebumps.
It was not a Hollywood-scale show,
and the nearly 7000 athletes in Los An
geles weren't here, but Michael
Olmstead and the United Spirit Associa
tion put on a show that had enough
color, pageantry and drama for anyone.
The show opened with more than 500
performers from 55 area high schools fil
ling the field. The dancers were in the
middle, flanked on both sides by flag
corps, with 120 ballboys and ballgirls
holding soccer balls on both sidelines.
The performers than did a
choreographed routine to "Reach Out,"
a song Giorgio Moroder composed espe
cially for the Games.
Five large rings of balloons represent
ing the rings of the Olympic flag were
held by 20 dancers, who did a routine ac
companied by "Olympic Fanfare and
Theme", the official anthem of the Los
Angeles Olympics, before setting the
rings at midfield.
The U.S. Skydiving Team then made a
dramatic entrance into the stadium. Each
of the five parachutists wore a color cor
responding to the ring they were to land
on. The red and blue divers missed the
10-foot diameter rings, but the next
three made perfect landings to the
delight of the 78,265 in attendance.
California Secretary of Business
Transportation and Housing Kirk West
then welcomed the Olympics on behalf
of the state.
The Boy Scouts of America presented
the colors as the Materworks Chorale
gave a harmonized rendition of the na
tional anthem.

Because almost all the athletes were in
Lqs Angeles, the organizers had youth
soccer teams from around the Bay Area
represent the 16 nations that qualified
teams for the Olympic Soccer competi
tion.
The teams marched in behind the flags
of the nations, and they stood on the in
field as U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz proclaimed, "I declare open the
Games of Stanford, celebrating the
XXIIIrd Olympiad of the Modern Era,"
a speech differing only in location from
that delivered by President Reagan the
day before in Los Angeles.
Shultz is on leave from his position as a
Business School professor at Stanford.
Eight former U.S. Olympians then en
tered the stadium with the Olympic flag
and raised it to the "Olympic Hymn".
The climax of the ceremonies came
when Hector Dyer, a member of the
1932 Olympic Team, entered carrying
the Olympic Torch. He handed the torch
to George Rhoden, a member of the
1952 Jamaican team, who in turn passed
off to 1960 Olympian Paul Hait. Sharon
Stouder Clark, a member of the 1964
team, finished the relay by ascending the
Stadium steps to light the flame, which
will burn at Stanford Stadium for the
duration of the competition.
Jeff Durgan, a defender on the U.S.
Soccer Team, took the Olympic Oath on
behalf of the competitors. Durgan was
unable to play Sunday night because of a
calf injury.
Thousands of balloons were released
to Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," and the
participants left the field to the music of
John Philip Sousa.
The Opening Ceremonies lasted a bit
more than 33 minutes, a trifle compared
to the nearly four-hour pageant of L.A.,
but provided enough chills of their own
for those who were fortunate enough to
attend. The U.S. Soccer Team's ensuing
3-0 win over Costa Rica served to com
plete a memorable evening.
