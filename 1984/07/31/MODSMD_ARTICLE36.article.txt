## Pynchon's first stories make his talents clear 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"Slow Learner: Early
iStories"
by Thomas Pynchon
Little, Brown, $14.95, 194
pp.
Thomas Pynchon's collection
of some of his early stories
should appeal to readers already
acquainted with his work, but it
might put off someone un
familiar with his novels.
Pynchon can be a difficult
writer, and this is not his best
work. But "Slow Learner" is
saved by two of its stories,
"Under the Rose" and"The Se
cret Integration." They should
persuade new readers to give
Pynchon's novels a try, and can
help define his strengths and
weaknesses for those who've
already read "V." or "Gravity's
Rainbow."
Pynchon's work has attracted
enough fancy critical interpreta
tions to make you think it was
printed on flypaper. Scholars
and well-read critics have been
eager to gloss the learned trivia
that fills much of Pynchon's
writing. The work does solicit
puzzle-solving, for it often ties
disparate strands of narrative
together with obscure cross
references. The novels also in
f elude numerous allusions and
inclusions that reach outside the
works themselves. The breadth
and minuteness of Pynchon's

knowledge contribute much of
the fun that is so plentiful in his
novels, but add little to the sub
stance of his concerns. His
recurrent invocations of certain
concepts from science may help
highlight and clarify his social
and human themes, but they are
too often mistaken for the focus
of his work. The concept of
entropy is the perfect example
of this misunderstanding.
"Slow Learner" includes the
story that seems to have gotten
the entropy catchword going in
Pynchon criticism. In his intro
duction, Pynchon remarks that
the story "Entropy" has been
anthologized "a couple-three
times." This is amazing, because
the piece is almost unreadably
bad. The idea that no system
works at 100 percent efficiency,
so that a closed system will run
down to exhaustion if no energy
is introduced, can be used to
talk about interpersonal rela
tions or about social problems.
But if you try to illustrate an ill
digested technical term with fic
tional characters, the characters
just won't come across as fic
tions. They'll be false and un
sympathetic, and the attempt to
hang a story on a neat concept
will just obscure your display of
intellectual agility.
Some critics have argued that

Pynchon's works are not meant
to present characters the same
way ordinary fiction does. If
that were the case, someone as
smart as Pynchon would know
enough never to give the im
pression that he wants you to
relate to his characters and their
stories as you might to those in a
regular novel. 1 agree that
Pynchon frequently plays
around with what fiction can do,
but because he retains many of
the conventions of standard fic
tion, he is committed to giving
us characters and situations we
can relate to as people, even if
they are pretend people.

Pynchon's introduction, per
haps the collection's greatest as
set, indicates his awareness of
the constraints of fiction. The
problems 1 have noted are
similar to those he himself sees
in some of the stories. It comes
down to giving cleverness and
'literariness' priority over com
ing to terms with one's charac
ters and their problems. Though
many of Pynchon's most persis
tent thematic concerns —
paranoia, conspiracy, class con
flicts, the unresponsiveness of
government to its citizens and
its fealty to the military
industrial complex — can be il
lustrated by concepts like
entropy, Gaussian bell curves,
or ballistic parabolas, those
stories and novels that make

their characters puppets of these
ideas are failures as pieces of
fiction.
This particular weakness is
not the only one that handicaps
some of the pieces in "Slow
Learner." They are, after all,
apprentice stories, and they
sometimes show Pynchon's im
maturity even when he does try
to treat his characters with
respect. The change between
these pieces and his novels is in
triguing. The first four of the
five stories in the collection
were all published before the
novel "V.,"and they introduce
characters and situations that
were later worked into it.
"Under the Rose" focuses on
Porpentine, a British agent in

Alexandria at the turn of the
century, whose adventures bring
him in touch with Victoria
Wren. Both turn up later in
"V.," Porpentine under the
name of Stencil. The sections of
"V." about Stencil and his son
are some of the best in that
novel, expressing a tenderness
that is rare in Pynchon's work.
A similar feeling is evident in
"The Secret Integration," a
story that was not grist for the
mill of a later novel. Though it is
occasionally clumsy and verges
on sentimentality, this story is
refreshing because its child
characters are free of the mania
and despair that are so common
in Pynchon's adults. Their
responses to social and human
problems — racism and al

coholism — are earnest, and the
humor they generate is not as
grim as that of the other stories.
"The Secret Integration" is
worth reading, period. Even if
you've read "V.,"the other
pieces will not seem stale, and
they may please those who have
not read even Pynchon's
novella, "The Crying of Lot
49." Pynchon's introduction is
genial and informative, and
points out the really important
issues about the writing in his
novels as well as in these stories.
For a reader willing to make his
own connections and do some
thinking, this collection will
prove a better introduction to
all of Pynchon's work than most
of the critical studies I have
seen.
