## Pynchon's first stories make his talents clear 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"Slow Learner: Early
iStories"
by Thomas Pynchon
Little, Brown, $14.95, 194
pp.
Thomas Pynchon's collection
of some of his early stories
should appeal to readers already
acquainted with his work, but it
might put off someone un
familiar with his novels.
Pynchon can be a difficult
writer, and this is not his best
work. But "Slow Learner" is
saved by two of its stories,
"Under the Rose" and"The Se
cret Integration." They should
persuade new readers to give
Pynchon's novels a try, and can
help define his strengths and
weaknesses for those who've
already read "V." or "Gravity's
Rainbow."
Pynchon's work has attracted
enough fancy critical interpreta
tions to make you think it was
printed on flypaper. Scholars
and well-read critics have been
eager to gloss the learned trivia
that fills much of Pynchon's
writing. The work does solicit
puzzle-solving, for it often ties
disparate strands of narrative
together with obscure cross
references. The novels also in
f elude numerous allusions and
inclusions that reach outside the
works themselves. The breadth
and minuteness of Pynchon's

knowledge contribute much of
the fun that is so plentiful in his
novels, but add little to the sub
stance of his concerns. His
recurrent invocations of certain
concepts from science may help
highlight and clarify his social
and human themes, but they are
too often mistaken for the focus
of his work. The concept of
entropy is the perfect example
of this misunderstanding.
"Slow Learner" includes the
story that seems to have gotten
the entropy catchword going in
Pynchon criticism. In his intro
duction, Pynchon remarks that
the story "Entropy" has been
anthologized "a couple-three
times." This is amazing, because
the piece is almost unreadably
bad. The idea that no system
works at 100 percent efficiency,
so that a closed system will run
down to exhaustion if no energy
is introduced, can be used to
talk about interpersonal rela
tions or about social problems.
But if you try to illustrate an ill
digested technical term with fic
tional characters, the characters
just won't come across as fic
tions. They'll be false and un
sympathetic, and the attempt to
hang a story on a neat concept
will just obscure your display of
intellectual agility.
Some critics have argued that
