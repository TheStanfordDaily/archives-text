## Summer flicks include comedy, fantasies 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Bachelor Party: The premise of this comedy — a
young woman's concern that her fiance may cheat on
her at his bachelor party — seems somehow
anachronistic, but at least it gives the star, Tom Hanks
(the hero of Splash), an opportunity to reveal his sweet,
affectionate side at odd moments. When Hanks clowns,
he comes up with some funny bits, K ; lie runs the risk
of appearing to be a poor man s Bill Murray; it's his
childlike earnestness and ingenuousness that distin
guish him (and that made him so appealing in Splash).
Bachelor Party, which was written by Neal Israel and
Pat Proft and directed by Israel, isn't worth seeing for
Hanks alone, however, and there's no other con
ceivable reason for sitting through it. The junior high
school level of the humor so drains vou that you can't
call up energy to get offended by air, of it. (If you did,
you'd probably walk out very early in the pictu e, when
Israel tries to make a joke of the fact that one of Hanks'
friends can't read.)
The supporting cast includes George Grizzard in an
embarrassing performance as Hanks' prospective
father-in-law, who campaigns viciously against the
young man's marriage to his daughter (Tawny Kitaen,
whose name far outshines her talents), and William
Tepper as Hanks' married brother, who gives him a
little talk on the marital state that rips off Diner. Al
most 15 years ago, Tepper played a restless college bas
ketball star in his first picture, Drive, He Said (directed
by Jack Nicholson — also a debut), and though the
movie was a flop, I can still remember the way Tepper
sat at the kitchen table in one scene and bounced an or
ange off the tips of his fingers; it was one of the few

times in a movie that I believed I was watching a real
athlete, because lepper had managed to find an in
digenous expression of tension for his character. And I
can t recall seeing him in any movie since — until
Bachelor Party, in which he's asked to chase Tom
Hanks around a doctor's waiting room and howl over
the carnal delights of an overripe hooker. It's unjust to
blame an actor who's never won any recognition for
taking an insulting role, since actors, like the rest of us,
have to eat. Still, watching this kind of forced joking
around from an actor I know is talented turned out to
be the most depressing part of Bachelor Party.

In 'Beat Street/ we're forced to
see the teenage heroes' obsessions
- break dancing, graffiti art, even
disc jockeying - as expressions of
their fierce individjxlit",

Beat Street: Someone (like Walter Hill) could prob
ably weld the various subversive elements of this movie
— break dancing, rap songs, graffiti art — into a swing
ing, energized pop musical, but Stan Lathan isn't the
director for the job. It's a clumsy, redundant little
picture, acted at a fairly consistent level of ineptitude
(only two women in the cast — Rae Dawn Chong and
Mary Alice Smith — display any poise or self

assurance) and only intermittently redeemed by musi
cal numbers. And even the numbers lack shape: 17
break dancers, many of them mesmerizing,-participate
in one marathon that doesn't appear to have undergone
any choreographic supervision at all, and though the
finale includes a nifty appearance by the rap king,
Grand Master Melle Mel (Melvin Glover), the number
itself is monstrously overpopulated and overstaged.
Andy Davis, David Gilbert and Paul Golding wrote the
script, but you can discern co-producer Harry
Belafonte s mark: We're forced to see the teenage
heroes' obsessions — break dancing, graffiti art, even
disc jockeying — as expressions of their fierce in
dividuality and creative rebellion against the oppres
sions of the ghetto. (As far as I could see, the would-be
D.J., played by Guy Davis — son of Ossie Davis and
Ruby Dee — is wasting his time trying to turn record
scratching into art.) Who wants to watch a self
righteous musical about break dancing? Beat Street has
galloping Fame's disease.
The Last Starfighten This latest video game-inspired
adventure is like a cross between Tron and Close
Encounters of the Third Kind. Alex (Lance Guest), a
teenager whose family operates a trailer park, breaks
all records playing a video amusement called
"Starfighter," then finds that the simulated combat he's
mastered represents the real war being waged
in another solar system, and that he's been
recruited to fight in it. The entire movie, written
by Jonathan Betuel and directed by Nick
Castle, leads up to the scene
that pits Alex against the entire
enemy armada, and it turns out
to be a fourth-rate battle, after
all (the special effects, by Digi
tal Productions, aren't very spe
cial), but The Last Star fighter is
an inoffensive bad picture. And
it does have one deluxe perfor
mance: Under a mask that
makes him look like an armored
phallus, Dan O'Herlihy plays
Grig, the alien who coaches
Alex and co-pilots his spaceship
(or "gunstar"), as a gung-ho
British colonial military man,
yelling "Interstellar!" with
gamesman's glee when Alex hits
his target. And Robert Preston,
as the seasoned con man who
recruits starfighters for the army
of the good Planet Rylos, lends
his vaudevillian skills to a
couple of scenes.
The Neverending Story: The
director, Wolfgang Petersen,
wants to enchant us with this

fairy tale (out of a Michael Ende
novel that sold big in Germany),
but this eccentric production, a
German-American-British-
Italian collaboration, has an
eerily discomfiting effect. Bas
tian (Barret Oliver), a misun
derstood dreamer of a school
boy, takes refuge from an un
pleasant math class and a trio of
bullies in the school attic, where
he pores over a book called
"The Neverending Story"; in it,
a boy named Atreyu (Noah
Hathaway) strives to rescue his
land, Fantasia, from the advanc
ing destruction of The Nothing,
and in a way not specified until
the last few minutes of the film,
Bastian himself becomes part of
the adventure. The script by
Petersen and Herman Weigel
contains elements of the Ar
thurian legend and of the
Tolkien trilogy, and some of it
reminded me of my childhood
favorites, C.S. Lewis' "Narnia"
stories and"The Fair to Mid
dling" by Arthur Calder Mar
shall, but the heavy visual style
wrecks the magic. The weird

creatures Bastian encounters
move before poorly drawn
mattes, so that they look like
cardboard cut-outs (even when
the characters themselves are
inventively designed, as many of
them are); and the resulting dis
placement is so unattractive to
the eye that even the benevolent
figures, like The Rock Biter and
Falcor the Luck Dragon, always
seem vaguely creepy. Petersen's
last film, Das Boot, set almost
entirely in a submarine, was ef
fectively claustrophobic, but I
don't think he can have wished
to trap his audiences inside The
Neverending Story, too — yet
that's exactly how the movie
makes you feel.

Grand Master Melle Mel (Melvin Glover), the number
itself is monstrously overpopulated and overstaged.
Andy Davis, David Gilbert and Paul Golding wrote the
script, but you can discern co-producer Harry
Belafonte s mark: We're forced to see the teenage
heroes' obsessions — break dancing, graffiti art, even
disc jockeying — as expressions of their fierce in
dividuality and creative rebellion against the oppres
sions of the ghetto. (As far as I could see, the would-be
D.J., played by Guy Davis — son of Ossie Davis and
Ruby Dee — is wasting his time trying to turn record
scratching into art.) Who wants to watch a self
righteous musical about break dancing? Beat Street has
galloping Fame's disease.
The Last Starfighten This latest video game-inspired
adventure is like a cross between Tron and Close
Encounters of the Third Kind. Alex (Lance Guest), a
teenager whose family operates a trailer park, breaks
all records playing a video amusement called
"Starfighter," then finds that the simulated combat he's
mastered represents the real war being waged
in another solar system, and that he's been
recruited to fight in it. The entire movie, written
by Jonathan Betuel and directed by Nick
Castle, leads up to the scene
that pits Alex against the entire
enemy armada, and it turns out
to be a fourth-rate battle, after
all (the special effects, by Digi
tal Productions, aren't very spe
cial), but The Last Star fighter is
an inoffensive bad picture. And
it does have one deluxe perfor
mance: Under a mask that
makes him look like an armored
phallus, Dan O'Herlihy plays
Grig, the alien who coaches
Alex and co-pilots his spaceship
(or "gunstar"), as a gung-ho
British colonial military man,
yelling "Interstellar!" with
gamesman's glee when Alex hits
his target. And Robert Preston,
as the seasoned con man who
recruits starfighters for the army
of the good Planet Rylos, lends
his vaudevillian skills to a
couple of scenes.
The Neverending Story: The
director, Wolfgang Petersen,
wants to enchant us with this

fairy tale (out of a Michael Ende
novel that sold big in Germany),
but this eccentric production, a
German-American-British-
Italian collaboration, has an
eerily discomfiting effect. Bas
tian (Barret Oliver), a misun
derstood dreamer of a school
boy, takes refuge from an un
pleasant math class and a trio of
bullies in the school attic, where
he pores over a book called
"The Neverending Story"; in it,
a boy named Atreyu (Noah
Hathaway) strives to rescue his
land, Fantasia, from the advanc
ing destruction of The Nothing,
and in a way not specified until
the last few minutes of the film,
Bastian himself becomes part of
the adventure. The script by
Petersen and Herman Weigel
contains elements of the Ar
thurian legend and of the
Tolkien trilogy, and some of it
reminded me of my childhood
favorites, C.S. Lewis' "Narnia"
stories and"The Fair to Mid
dling" by Arthur Calder Mar
shall, but the heavy visual style
wrecks the magic. The weird

creatures Bastian encounters
move before poorly drawn
mattes, so that they look like
cardboard cut-outs (even when
the characters themselves are
inventively designed, as many of
them are); and the resulting dis
placement is so unattractive to
the eye that even the benevolent
figures, like The Rock Biter and
Falcor the Luck Dragon, always
seem vaguely creepy. Petersen's
last film, Das Boot, set almost
entirely in a submarine, was ef
fectively claustrophobic, but I
don't think he can have wished
to trap his audiences inside The
Neverending Story, too — yet
that's exactly how the movie
makes you feel.
Bachelor Party: The premise of this comedy — a
young woman's concern that her fiance may cheat on
her at his bachelor party — seems somehow
anachronistic, but at least it gives the star, Tom Hanks
(the hero of Splash), an opportunity to reveal his sweet,
affectionate side at odd moments. When Hanks clowns,
he comes up with some funny bits, K ; lie runs the risk
of appearing to be a poor man s Bill Murray; it's his
childlike earnestness and ingenuousness that distin
guish him (and that made him so appealing in Splash).
Bachelor Party, which was written by Neal Israel and
Pat Proft and directed by Israel, isn't worth seeing for
Hanks alone, however, and there's no other con
ceivable reason for sitting through it. The junior high
school level of the humor so drains vou that you can't
call up energy to get offended by air, of it. (If you did,
you'd probably walk out very early in the pictu e, when
Israel tries to make a joke of the fact that one of Hanks'
friends can't read.)
The supporting cast includes George Grizzard in an
embarrassing performance as Hanks' prospective
father-in-law, who campaigns viciously against the
young man's marriage to his daughter (Tawny Kitaen,
whose name far outshines her talents), and William
Tepper as Hanks' married brother, who gives him a
little talk on the marital state that rips off Diner. Al
most 15 years ago, Tepper played a restless college bas
ketball star in his first picture, Drive, He Said (directed
by Jack Nicholson — also a debut), and though the
movie was a flop, I can still remember the way Tepper
sat at the kitchen table in one scene and bounced an or
ange off the tips of his fingers; it was one of the few

times in a movie that I believed I was watching a real
athlete, because lepper had managed to find an in
digenous expression of tension for his character. And I
can t recall seeing him in any movie since — until
Bachelor Party, in which he's asked to chase Tom
Hanks around a doctor's waiting room and howl over
the carnal delights of an overripe hooker. It's unjust to
blame an actor who's never won any recognition for
taking an insulting role, since actors, like the rest of us,
have to eat. Still, watching this kind of forced joking
around from an actor I know is talented turned out to
be the most depressing part of Bachelor Party.

Beat Street: Someone (like Walter Hill) could prob
ably weld the various subversive elements of this movie
— break dancing, rap songs, graffiti art — into a swing
ing, energized pop musical, but Stan Lathan isn't the
director for the job. It's a clumsy, redundant little
picture, acted at a fairly consistent level of ineptitude
(only two women in the cast — Rae Dawn Chong and
Mary Alice Smith — display any poise or self

assurance) and only intermittently redeemed by musi
cal numbers. And even the numbers lack shape: 17
break dancers, many of them mesmerizing,-participate
in one marathon that doesn't appear to have undergone
any choreographic supervision at all, and though the
finale includes a nifty appearance by the rap king,
Grand Master Melle Mel (Melvin Glover), the number
itself is monstrously overpopulated and overstaged.
