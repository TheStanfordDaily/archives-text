# 'Purple Rain' shows off Prince's virtuosity

The rock singer Prince has a
bizarre seductiveness: With the
full head of curls of a proud,
spoiled youngster in an 18th
century family portrait, a ward
robe — fancy-dress military
jackets with epaulettes and
braid, lacy white gloves —
filched from a historical
costume shop for androgynes,
and just the shadow of a mous
tache, he's like a sexy child. A
shy, melting smile tells us that
he's all warmth and vul
nerability underneath those
grown-up ballroom digs, but
then he shifts into the con
temptuous smirk of a teenager
who knows he's gotten away
with murder, and the potent soft
intensity of his gaze grows dan
gerous. He's not the first per
former to investigate the sexual
potential of feyness and mock
ery (Mick Jagger was), but his
meticulously controlled chil
dishness is shocking, and I've
never seen a singer shed his ar
tifice so easily and slide so
quickly from insinuating put-on
to naked emotional fervor. At
the high point of a number
called "The Beautiful Ones," he
does an amazing, stripped-voice
scorched blues that evokes Janis
Joplin, finishes off the song, and
lies down on the stage, eyes
closed, a relaxed, post-orgasmic
smile on his face.
One surmises, from the num
bers and from a few quiet mo
ments in the non-musical sec
tions of Purple Rain, that Prince
could be a fascinating movie ac
tor (he's certainly a prize
camera subject), but his role
consists almost entirely of emo

tional pitches, and he needs a
better director than Albert
Magnoli. Magnoli has an indis
criminate eye — like a first
time-out amateur photog
rapher, he becomes distracted
by any flashy detail; if Purple
Rain has a unifying visual style,
the cinematographer, Donald
Thorin, who has a gift for flash,
has provided it. (Thorin is cer
tainly the right choice to light a
rock musical.) And it's a very
dumb movie. The publicity
stresses its innovative approach
to rock filmmaking, but the
story couldn't be more basic —
or unoriginal: A tough young
singer from an unhappy home
abuses his friends, mistreats the
woman who loves him, but
tragedy causes him to reassess
his life and come to the conclu
sion that nice is better. Prince
and his co-star, Apollonia
Kotero (whose talent, if any, is
not conspicuous in this movie),
wear studded leather in their
scenes together and engage in
some wet-lipped, crotch
grabbing foreplay, but all that is
merely window dressing for the
old-style romance at the heart
of the picture.
Magnoli does even worse with
the other characters. As the fa
ther of The Kid (Prince),
Francis L., a one-time musician
songwriter who vents his crea
tive frustration on his long
suffering wife (Olga Karlatos),
Clarence Williams 111 seems to
be caught in a John Cassavetes
psychodrama. And the most or
dinary conversations between
The Kid's rival, Morris (Morris
Day) and the manager of the
club where they both work,

Billy (Billy Sparks), seem to be
way beyond Magnoli's reach —
they play like badly rehearsed
filler at a summer camp variety
night. Day's performance is
saved, luckily, by his onstage
charm and his comic rapport
with Jerome Benton, who plays
his all-purpose right-hand man.
(At one point these two do a
funny variation on the old Ab
bott & Costello "Who's On
First" routine — just about the

last thing you'd expect to hear in
a movie like Purple Rain.)
The obvious reason to watch
the film is to see Prince perform
his songs — not only because of
his presence and his emotional
range and the feline, balletic
tension of his movement on
stage, but also because the
music itself is terrific. But the
script, which Magnoli wrote
with William Blinn and which is
rumored to be "inspired" by

Prince's true story, insists on
furnishing a pseudo
psychological explanation for
The Kid's music as well as for
his egotistical, anti-social be
havior. We're intended to see
that Francis L.'s inability to ex
press his love for his wife except
through violence has found its
way into The Kid's act, in which
a female band member sim-
