### 
Willemstad, Curacao (AP) — U.S.,
Venezuelan and Netherland Antilles se
curity agents stormed a hijacked
Venezuelan jetliner early today, killing
the two hijackers and rescuing the 79
people held hostage on board, govern
ment officials said.
The plane had been hijacked Sunday
after it left Caracas, the Venezuelan cap
ital, for a flight to Curacao, but the gun
men forced it to land in Trinidad and
Aruba before it arrived here yesterday
morning.
Officials said the sky pirates were a
former Haitian army captain opposed to
Haiti's President-for-life Jean-Claude
Duvalier and a man with a passport from
the Dominican Republic.
Two hours before the assault, the two
gunmen ordered the pilot to take off
from this Dutch Caribbean island, the

third stop since the plane was hijacked
just out of Caracas, Venezuala, on Sun
day afternoon.
They had earlier set a deadline for this
morning, threatening to blow up the
piane unless they received an escape
helicopter, $5 million in cash and if pos
sible, weapons.
They later became angry at authorities
and ordered the pilot to take off just
before midnight.
As the plane taxied down the runway,
authorities told the pilot security agents
had earlier let the air out of the plane's
front tire and that the runway was
blocked by firetrucks.
The gunmen told the pilot to stop,
then told authorities to remove the
firetrucks. But the authorities, negotiat
ing over the radio at the airport control
tower, delayed their takeoff until the ar

rival from Venezuela of the wife of one
of the gunmen, Haitian exile Hiltertaut
Dominique.
In Port-au-Prince, Haitian Foreign
Minister Jean-Robert Estime said
Dominique was a terrorist caught in
December 1982 at the airport in the
Dominican Republic trying to smuggle
machine guns to Haiti for an apparent at
tempt to overthrow the authoritarian
Duvalier regime. The Dominican gov
ernment exiled Dominique to
Venezuela.
Armed men could be seen fanned out
along the runway here. Venezuela and
the United States sent anti-terrorist
operatives here early yesterday.
In Santa Barbara, Calif., where Presi
dent Reagan is vacationing, assistant
press secretary Mark Weinberg said the
administration made "technical ad

visers" available because the hijacking
"potentially involves the safety of a
sizable number of people."
The hijackers released six passengers
yesterday, but became frustrated late
yesterday when Gilberto Thomas, Mini
ster of Economic Affairs for The Nether
lands Antilles, told them to release more
passengers in return for a generator.
Authorities had warned the hijackers
that the plane could lose electricity and
communications.
Arturo Reina, the pilot, reported that
an Argentine woman aboard was in dan
ger of miscarrying. The gunmen
threatened to shoot her yesterday after
noon when her husband Roman Puertas,
one of those released, failed to return
with $1 million cash, he said.
