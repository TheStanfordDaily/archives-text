Lxmdon â€” Doctors gave a new heart yesterday to
nine-day-old Hollie Roffey, the world s youngest
heart transplant patient, after her surgeon made a
switt flight to Holland for the tiny donated heart of a
newborn baby.
Born with the left side of her heart missing, the 6-
pound, 8-ounce Hollie had only a few days to live
until she came under the care of Dr. Magdi Yacoub,
an Egyptian surgeon who does 300-400 heart
operations a year.
Yacoub flew to the Netherlands Sunday night to
pick up the heart of a three-day-old Dutch baby who
had died of brain damage. He was back at London's
National Heart Hospital in time to start the opera
tion on Hollie at midnight, said Tom Cosgrove, the
hospital's chief administrator.
The surgery, performed by a 10-member team,
took five hours. Yesterday afternoon, Cosgrove an

nounced Hollie was in stable condition.
Cosgrove said it would be several days before
Hollie's chances of survival became clear.
The Roffey family paid nothing for the surgery
because of Britain's free National Health Service.
