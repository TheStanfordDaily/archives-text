San Ysidro — Some families whose members died
or were injured during a bloody massacre at a
McDonald's restaurant here are afraid of losing
state welfare if they accept help from a private fund
set up to aid the families of victims, Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy said yesterday.
Members of an advisory committee overseeing a
$1.6 million recovery fund told McCarthy that some
people were wary of accepting assistance from the
pool started with $100,000 by Joan Kroc, the widow
of McDonald's Corp. founder Ray Kroc.
McDonald's Corp. added $1 million and individ
ual contributions from across the nation have con

tinued to pour in daily.
McCarthy said he would do everything possible to
"work through the bureaucracy" to see that welfare
families were not penalized for taking private aid.
