Polmont, Scotland â€” A high-speed express train
packed with commuters and tourists jumped the
track near this southeast Scottish village yesterday

The train crashed about a mile from here 30
minutes after leaving Edinburgh on a 35-mile run to
Glasgow, said Donald McTeggert, a spokesman for
the state-run railroad in Edinburgh.
Press Association, the domestic news agency,
quoted a police spokesman in Edinburgh as saying
that the train may have hit a cow on the line.
