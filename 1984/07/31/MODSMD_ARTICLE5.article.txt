# Beached tanker leaks oil sheen

### 
Lake Charles, La. (AP) — A
690-foot tanker loaded with
14.7 million gallons of oil ran
aground yesterday near two
wildlife refuges, crumpling its
bow and leaking a one-square
mile sheen of crude oil, authori
ties said.
No injuries were reported to
the crew of the British tanker
Alvenus, which ran aground
around 10 a.m. PDT along a
dredged channel from the Gulf
of Mexico about 40 miles south
of Lake Charles, said Coast
Guard spokesman Mark Ken
nedy.
Although it was not known
how much oil had leaked, Ken
nedy said there was potential for
environmental disaster and offi
cials were "treating it as if it is a
spill of the highest magnitude."
"It originally was reported as
a sheen and a sheen can spread
a long way without being a lot of
oil," Kennedy said.
The accident happened about
40 miles west-southwest of the
Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge
and about 25 miles southeast of
the Sabine Migratory Wild Fowl
Refuge.

Earlier, Lt. David Ealey of
the Coast Guard in Port Arthur,
Texas, had said "pollution is
substantial at this time with the
potential for major pollution."
John Helbert, a commercial
helicopter pilot who flew over
the damaged ship, said the spill
was about one square mile
across and drifting southwest
when he flew over it at 11 a.m.
Fourteen crew members were
taken from the ship, with the
remaining 21 planning to stay
aboard all night, Kennedy said.
The impact crumpled a 115-
foot-long seam up one side of
the ship, across its deck and
down toward the waterline on
the other side, said Lt. Kathleen
Donohoe, a Coast Guard
spokeswoman.
Initial reports indicated the
ship's bow had come off, but a
Coast Guard helicopter that got
there 90 minutes after the acci
dent found it was only cracked,
said Kennedy.
The tanker first ran into the
side of the ship channel, then
drifted outside of the dredged
channel and stuck on the bot
tom, Kennedy said.
