# EPA wants less lead in gas

### 
Washington (AP) — The Environmental
Protection Agency yesterday proposed a 91
percent reduction of lead from gasoline by
1986 under a plan officials said could save
50,000 children from brain damage in just two
years.
"The fact is that our past programs to reduce
lead in gasoline haven't worked as expected,"
EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus said.
"The evidence is overwhelming that lead from
all sources is a threat to public health . . . espe
cially for pregnant women and young
children."
Leaded gasoline now accounts for about 45
percent of all the gas sold nationwide, despite
the mandated use of catalytic converters re
quiring unleaded fuel on all American cars
built since 1975.
In addition to the health issue, Ruckelshaus
also cited evidence of widespread cheating by
motorists who use leaded fuel in cars not built
for it.
It would cost refiners about $575 million to
meet the new standards, Ruckelshaus said.
"But, from a social point of view this ex
pense is more than offset by the $1.8 billion
that will be saved during 1986 alone from
lower costs for medical treatment and
rehabilitation, reduced vehicle maintenance
bills and improved fuel efficiency, not to men
tion a higher quality environment," he said.
The new regulations, if adopted following a
60-day comment period, would require
refiners to limit the concentration of lead in

gasoline to 0.1 gram per gallon beginning in
January 1986. That is 11 times more stringent
than the current standard of 1.1 grams per gal
lon, set in 1982.
But in announcing the proposal, the EPA
said it might instead order a reduction to only
one-half gram per gallon in July 1985 and
"phase down" gradually to the 0.1 level by
1988 if refiners can show that the standard
could not be met by 1986.
Ruckelshaus, however, indicated he favors
the earlier deadline.
"We estimate that by 1988, absent this stan
dard, there would still be some 97,000 children
in the country who would have blood-lead
levels in excess of 30 micrograms per
deciliter," he said.
The government's Centers for Disease Con
trol now use the 30 micrograms per deciliter
concentration of lead in blood as a guideline
for requiring medical attention.
EPA officials said brain-wave changes have
been detected in children with blood-lead
levels as low as 15 micrograms per deciliter.
Concentrations of 40 to 60 micrograms have
produced retardation, lower IQs and altered
behavior in pre-school children.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group that has spearheaded the
fight for removing lead from gasoline, praised
the proposed cutbacks as a "well-reasoned ap
proach" but expressed concern that the
deadline might be moved back to 1988.
