## Crime statistics lower in Olympic games area 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The
bomb squad has been "very ac
tive" since the Summer Olym
pics began, but no explosives
have been found, and authori
ties said yesterday that many
calls were due to extreme cau
tion on the part of officers.
Police also said the high se
curity profile during the Games
has caused a sharp drop in rob
beries and burglaries near the
Memorial Coliseum and adja
cent USC campus, site of an
Olympic Village.
Assistant Police Chief Marvin
lannone also said in a news con
ference that the "bomb squad
has been very active during this
period" of the Olympics, but
that no explosives have been
found.

He refused to disclose how
many bomb calls police have an
swered, saying it would be
"inappropriate" to discuss such
a sensitive matter.
He attributed the number of
calls to the bomb squad to
security-conscious officers who
have been encouraged to call if
they spot anything amiss or any
unidentified packages.
"Things are continuing to go
unbelievably smoothly,"
lannone said.
In the University of Southern
California-Coliseum area, a cat
egory known as "repressible
crime" — including robbery,
burglary and auto theft — is
"down very significantly," he
said.
"The predators are quick to

flee the area when they see all
the blue suits around," lannone
said.
The most striking statistic was
the one robbery reported for the
week of July 22-29, compared
to 26 reported for the same per
iod last year, he said.
There has been an overall 63
percent reduction from in the
general category of repressible
crime for the area, he said.
Arrests in one area are up
citywide, he said: 17 people
have been taken into custody
for scalping Olympic tickets.
Beverly Hills police Capt.
Merv Pederson said two people
were arrested at the University
of California at Los Angeles on
Sunday for selling tickets stolen
from a Beverly Hills home.
