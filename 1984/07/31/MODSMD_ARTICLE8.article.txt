# Long distance rates to drop
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Californians paid less
yesterday for most intrastate long-distance calls as
a result of a new rate structure ordered by the
state's Public Utilities Commission.
The new rates reduce charges for longer dis
tance calls within the state while increasing the
cost of some shorter distance calls.
For example, a 10-minute direct-dialed call be
tween San Francisco and Los Angeles dropped
from $5.15 to $3.94, while the same call between
Sacramento and Stockton rose to $2.92 from
$2.86.
Rates for calls within the San Francisco Bay
area and North Coast counties, as well as inter
state rates, are not affected.
The change is the third ordered by the PUC
since July 1 as it grapples with the effects of Janu
ary's breakup of the Bell system. The commission

had ordered a $73 million rate decrease, effective
yesterday, for AT&T Communications, but
meanwhile granted a 4 percent surcharge to stay
the effect of the rate order while it holds hearings
on AT&Ts objections.
AT&T officials told the PUC they expect to
lose $33.7 million on California operations this
year, mainly because low-cost competitors are
taking away much of their long-distance business.
John Dennis, AT&T's vice president for
regulatory relations, said the company pays 88
cents of every dollar it receives in California to
Pacific Bell and other operators for access to their
lines and fees for directory assistance.
The PUC's final decision on the rate structure
and access fees it pays to operating companies
could lead to another round of rate changes by the
end of the year.
