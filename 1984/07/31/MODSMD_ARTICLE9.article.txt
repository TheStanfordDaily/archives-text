# Education report charts schools' reform progress
## 
### 
Nashville, Tenn. (AP) —
A year after a stream of
reports warned of mediocrity
in American classrooms, a
study released yesterday by a
task force of governors,
educators and businessmen
has found that educational
renewal is "well under way"
in nearly every state.
The report, "Action in the
States," charts the progress
of all 50 states in implement
ing various education
reforms. It found that 46
states are working on com
prehensive plans to improve
public schools. Twenty-seven
initiated such plans in the last
year alone.
The report noted these
steps:
• 16 states have hiked
teacher pay by at least 8 per
cent since 1983.
• 19 states have passed
master teacher, career ladder
or merit pay initiatives to en
courage better teaching.
Forty-five states have imple
mented tougher teacher cer
tification requirements.
• 39 states have reformed
curricula in the last three
years.
• 27 states have lengthened
the school day or school
year, reduced class size, or
provided state funding to in

crease instructional time.
• 44 states have stiffened
high school graduation re
quirements to require more
math, science, foreign lan
guages, English, social sci
ence and computer educa
tion.
• 20 states have adopted new
student discipline policies.
Spending on public educa
tion is on the upswing, said
the report. State legislatures
introduced more than 7,000
education-related bills in
1984, and the public seems
more willing to accept
education-related taxes.
But the report, released at
the summer meeting of the
National Governors' Confer
ence here, warned that the
progress of the past year
could be lost unless states
build on the current momen
tum. Specifically, it urged
that states must do more to
enlist teachers and principals
in the school reform effort.
"The message of this
report is simple," said Dela
ware Gov. Pierre du Pont,
chairman of the Task Force
on Education for Economic
Growth, which produced the
report. "We've made prog
ress, but if we stop here, we'll
quickly find ourselves falling
behind again."
