# Egyptian win sets stage for U.S. showdown
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
While the United States' 1-1 tie with
Egypt last night eliminated the U.S.
squad from Olympic competition, two
contests on Tuesday were responsible for
placing the American team in a must-win
situation. Egypt defeated Costa Rica, 4-
1, here, while Italy edged the U.S. squad,
1-0, in Pasadena.
The Italians got a goal from Pietro
Fanna in the 54th minute to end the
Americans' dream of winning the group.
The goal was set up by Ricardo Ferri,
who crossed a pass to the left side of the
goal, where Aldo Serena headed it down
to the foot of Fanna, who put it home be
hind U.S. goalkeeper David Brcic. It was
the first goal Brcic allowed in the tourna
ment.
On the game, Italy outshot the U.S. by
the lopsided margin of 19-5. Angelo
Dißernardo had the only shot that Ital
ian keeper Franco Tancredi needed to
save, while Rick Davis, the two-goal
hero of Sunday's opening win over Costa
Rica, was held to only one shot, which
was blocked by the Italian defense. The
other three American shots went wide as
63,624 looked on.
Before 20,645 at Stanford Stadium,
Egypt dominated Costa Rica in the same
manner as the U.S. had two nights ear
lier. Egypt kept the play in the Costa
Rican end and scored twice in both

halves before Costa Rica got its first goal
of the Olympics just 2 1/2 minutes from
the end.
Mahmoud El Khatib started the Egyp
tian onslaught, taking a pass from
Showki Gharib 15 yards out on the right
side and putting it into the left corner of
the net in the 32nd minute.
Three minutes later, Magdi Sayed
made it 2-0 by knocking a header past
Rojas following a free kick.
Costa Rica's offense began to gear up
following Sayed's goal, but the Egyptian
defense held firm and took the two-goal
lead into the locker room at halftime.
The third Egyptian goal was the result
of a pressuring attack. Mohamed Mah
moud took a shot from the left side that
got past the diving Rojas, but hit the left
post. It rebouded out to Emad Suleiman,
though, who knocked it into the open net
at 62:30.
Ali Gadalla finished the Egyptian
scoring, taking a short pass from
Suleiman, who had been dribbling in
front, and putting a shot off Rojas' fin
gertips from 18 yards out on the right
side at 71:10.
Evaristo Coronado ended Egyptian
keeper Adil El Maamour's bid for a
shutout at the 87:30 mark when he took
a rebound of a save by El Maamour and
buried it into the left side of the net from
12 yards out.
