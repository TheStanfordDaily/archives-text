# Mama Nina's is reward for long drive to Napa

Mama Nina's
6772 Washington
Yountville
944-2112
Everyone knows the Napa Valley is a great place to
drink wine. But at 4:30 or 5:00 p.m., when the tasting
rooms close, everyone also knows you have to weave
your way carefully back home, because there just isn't
anything else to do in Napa. *
At least this is what I thought before visiting Mama
Nina's. (Turn right on Madison off Route 29 about
halfway up the valley, just after the Yountville turnoff,
then right on Washington Street. Mama Nina's is on the
right, just before the Vintage 1870 Shopping Mall.) 1
was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant that more
than rewarded both the two-hour drive up to Napa, and
the wait until dinner time. The first indication that this
was going to be a very enjoyable dining experience
came from the fresh flowers and basil in the garden out
back, next to the small parking lot. (Both ended up on
the table.)
The restaurant itself is surrounded by a thicket of
flowers and shrubs, giving almost a jungle-like atmo
sphere. Tables in the room to the right of the entrance
have a lovely view of the garden. There are even a few
outside tables, also next to the garden. The bar serves
premium wine by the glass. The main dining room, to
the left, is very pleasant, though less scenic. Blue and
white checked tablecloths and art prints on the walls
give an air of slightly dressed-up informality. Patrons
seemed to feel comfortable in anything from shorts to
evening attire.
Service was excellent throughout the meal, and our
waitress delivered menus and wine list promptly. A
wide selection of California wines ranged from $10 to
$20 a bottle. The house white, available by the glass,
was much better than standard restaurant fare, and
very drinkable.
Even before ordering, we were delivered a small
complimentary appetizer of hot chicken-liver pate on a
round of toasted bread.
A folder on the table expanded on the menu and ex
plained Mama Nina's philosopy. The restaurant is a
pasta-lover's dream. Fresh pasta is homemade at the
restaurant daily, and is understandably the speciality.
The dough is fashioned into spaghetti, fettucine,
tagUarini, tortellini and linguine. Spaghetti is $6.50 a la
car:, the others are $7.75. Non-pasta entrees are veal
piccnta ($11.95), chicken with wine and mushrooms

($9.75), scampi ($13.25) and lobster tail ($15.25).
All dinners can be ordered in three sizes; a la carte,
small dinner (including soup or salad and beverage), or
full dinner (with antipasto tray, soup, salad and bever
age.) Prices listed above are a la carte; add $2.00 for
small and $6.00 for full dinner. The antipasta is a nice
appetizer. It contains vegetable, both fresh and lightly

marinated, salami, cheese, and peppers. While it is a
pleasant prelude to the meal, those who choose the a la
carte or small dinner options do not miss out on any
thing unusual.
The soup, on the other hand, should not be skipped.
We had the minestrone (something of a house
speciality) and cream of potato with green onion. Both
were rich, full-bodied, and wonderfully flavorful. The
salad was a normal portion, with homemade croutons
and a cherry tomato on red leaf and escarole.
The heart of the meal, of course, was the pasta, and it
more than lived up to our expectations. We chose gnoc
chi Maria (described as "light dumplings in a tomato
and basil sauce, with fresh grated parmesan cheese")
and tortellini Nina ("small circles of pasta filled with
ground veal, parmesan cheese and spices served in a
sauce of heavy cream, finely minced chicken breast and
parmesan cheese.") The sauce on the gnocchi was
"country style," with large chunks of tomato and onion,
and was redolent of fresh basil. It was strong and un
complicated (few flavors other than those mentioned
came through), with a bold tomato-and-basil taste
without much subtlety. The gnocchi themselves were
perfectly cooked; light and fluffy without being doughy.
The tortellini had a fuller, more complex flavor. This
was a truly outstanding pasta dish; rich and savory with
a skillful blend of flavors. The unusual touch of minced
chicken in the sauce did not detract from the smooth
consistency, but added fullness to the taste.
By this time, we were understandably pretty stuffed,
but decided to order dessert ($2.25) anyway. Mama
Nina's serves mud pie, "sand pie," (their own creation,
like mud pie but with an oatmeal cookie crust, vanilla
ice cream, hot fudge sauce and peanuts,) and crostatta
di ricotta, described as being "like a torte, with a deli
cious lemon-flavored crust and a souffle-like filling of
ricotta cheese and beaten egg." We had the crotatta,
and their description sums it up. It was pleasant and
lighter-tasting than one would imagine. The coffee was
good.
Mama Nina's, then, is a great way to end a day in the
Napa Valley. Prices are a bit high for the full dinner,
but the a la carte and small pasta dinners are good
values. Salads on the side range from $3.00 to $3.75.
Minimum service is $5.50, and corkage is $4.00 if you
bring your own wine. The hours are 11:30-2:30 for
lunch, and 5-10 for dinner. (The bar stays open in be
tween.) Mama Nina's is closed Wednesday for lunch.

and was redolent of fresh basil. It was strong and un
complicated (few flavors other than those mentioned
came through), with a bold tomato-and-basil taste
without much subtlety. The gnocchi themselves were
perfectly cooked; light and fluffy without being doughy.
The tortellini had a fuller, more complex flavor. This
was a truly outstanding pasta dish; rich and savory with
a skillful blend of flavors. The unusual touch of minced
chicken in the sauce did not detract from the smooth
consistency, but added fullness to the taste.
By this time, we were understandably pretty stuffed,
but decided to order dessert ($2.25) anyway. Mama
Nina's serves mud pie, "sand pie," (their own creation,
like mud pie but with an oatmeal cookie crust, vanilla
ice cream, hot fudge sauce and peanuts,) and crostatta
di ricotta, described as being "like a torte, with a deli
cious lemon-flavored crust and a souffle-like filling of
ricotta cheese and beaten egg." We had the crotatta,
and their description sums it up. It was pleasant and
lighter-tasting than one would imagine. The coffee was
good.
Mama Nina's, then, is a great way to end a day in the
Napa Valley. Prices are a bit high for the full dinner,
but the a la carte and small pasta dinners are good
values. Salads on the side range from $3.00 to $3.75.
Minimum service is $5.50, and corkage is $4.00 if you
bring your own wine. The hours are 11:30-2:30 for
lunch, and 5-10 for dinner. (The bar stays open in be
tween.) Mama Nina's is closed Wednesday for lunch.

Mama Nina's
6772 Washington
Yountville
944-2112
Everyone knows the Napa Valley is a great place to
drink wine. But at 4:30 or 5:00 p.m., when the tasting
rooms close, everyone also knows you have to weave
your way carefully back home, because there just isn't
anything else to do in Napa. *
At least this is what I thought before visiting Mama
Nina's. (Turn right on Madison off Route 29 about
halfway up the valley, just after the Yountville turnoff,
then right on Washington Street. Mama Nina's is on the
right, just before the Vintage 1870 Shopping Mall.) 1
was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant that more
than rewarded both the two-hour drive up to Napa, and
the wait until dinner time. The first indication that this
was going to be a very enjoyable dining experience
came from the fresh flowers and basil in the garden out
back, next to the small parking lot. (Both ended up on
the table.)
The restaurant itself is surrounded by a thicket of
flowers and shrubs, giving almost a jungle-like atmo
sphere. Tables in the room to the right of the entrance
have a lovely view of the garden. There are even a few
outside tables, also next to the garden. The bar serves
premium wine by the glass. The main dining room, to
the left, is very pleasant, though less scenic. Blue and
white checked tablecloths and art prints on the walls
give an air of slightly dressed-up informality. Patrons
seemed to feel comfortable in anything from shorts to
evening attire.
Service was excellent throughout the meal, and our
waitress delivered menus and wine list promptly. A
wide selection of California wines ranged from $10 to
$20 a bottle. The house white, available by the glass,
was much better than standard restaurant fare, and
very drinkable.
Even before ordering, we were delivered a small
complimentary appetizer of hot chicken-liver pate on a
round of toasted bread.
A folder on the table expanded on the menu and ex
plained Mama Nina's philosopy. The restaurant is a
pasta-lover's dream. Fresh pasta is homemade at the
restaurant daily, and is understandably the speciality.
The dough is fashioned into spaghetti, fettucine,
tagUarini, tortellini and linguine. Spaghetti is $6.50 a la
car:, the others are $7.75. Non-pasta entrees are veal
piccnta ($11.95), chicken with wine and mushrooms

($9.75), scampi ($13.25) and lobster tail ($15.25).
All dinners can be ordered in three sizes; a la carte,
small dinner (including soup or salad and beverage), or
full dinner (with antipasto tray, soup, salad and bever
age.) Prices listed above are a la carte; add $2.00 for
small and $6.00 for full dinner. The antipasta is a nice
appetizer. It contains vegetable, both fresh and lightly

marinated, salami, cheese, and peppers. While it is a
pleasant prelude to the meal, those who choose the a la
carte or small dinner options do not miss out on any
thing unusual.
The soup, on the other hand, should not be skipped.
We had the minestrone (something of a house
speciality) and cream of potato with green onion. Both
were rich, full-bodied, and wonderfully flavorful. The
salad was a normal portion, with homemade croutons
and a cherry tomato on red leaf and escarole.
The heart of the meal, of course, was the pasta, and it
more than lived up to our expectations. We chose gnoc
chi Maria (described as "light dumplings in a tomato
and basil sauce, with fresh grated parmesan cheese")
and tortellini Nina ("small circles of pasta filled with
ground veal, parmesan cheese and spices served in a
sauce of heavy cream, finely minced chicken breast and
parmesan cheese.") The sauce on the gnocchi was
"country style," with large chunks of tomato and onion,
and was redolent of fresh basil. It was strong and un
complicated (few flavors other than those mentioned
came through), with a bold tomato-and-basil taste
without much subtlety. The gnocchi themselves were
perfectly cooked; light and fluffy without being doughy.
The tortellini had a fuller, more complex flavor. This
was a truly outstanding pasta dish; rich and savory with
a skillful blend of flavors. The unusual touch of minced
chicken in the sauce did not detract from the smooth
consistency, but added fullness to the taste.
