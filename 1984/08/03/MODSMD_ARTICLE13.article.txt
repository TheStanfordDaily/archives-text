### 
La Residence Country Inn
4066 St. Helena Highway
707-253-0337
La Residence's main house is
an 1870 three-story Gothic
Revival built by a New Orleans
riverboat pilot seeking his
fortune during the gold rush.
Painstakingly restored by
proprietor Barbara Littenberg,
it provides a warm and elegant
setting for guests.
The house has four bedrooms
with private baths and
fireplaces. The top floor has
three charming bedrooms
sharing two baths. The antique
filled house has a marvelous
Victorian parlor and a kitchen
available for limited use. A
jacuzzi is located just behind the
house, giving visitors a pleasant
place to chat and drink a glass of
complimentary wine.
Recently finished next to the
main house is a new building in
the style and scale of a fine
country inn. Each guest room
includes a private entry, private
bath and fireplace. All rooms
are impeccably decorated with
coordinated wallpapers, cur

tains and linens; each includes
fine period antiques.
Guests of La Residence are
offered old world charm with
new world comforts — the best
of two worlds.
Continental breakfast is
served in a large, airy eating hall
in the new building where, Bar
bara reports, full dinners will
soon be served as well.
The 15 guest rooms of La
Residence make it larger than
most bed-and-breakfast inns,
but despite its size, Barbara of
fers warm hospitality. I highly
recommend it for those who
have a bit of money and the
taste to appreciate the quality
and beauty offered at La
Residence.
Located close to the city of
Napa, this county-style inn
brings the entire wine country
close at hand. If you are looking
for a perfect place to spend a
romantic holiday, this could be
it.
Rates vary from $60 to $115
in season.
