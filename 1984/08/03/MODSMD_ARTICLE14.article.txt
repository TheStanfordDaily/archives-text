As its name implies, Califor
nia Cafe stresses fare of the
Golden State. Mesquite
charcoal-broiled fish, blackened
prime rib and snapper, light
sauces, steamed mussels and
clams are its specialties.
Open for only nine months,
California Cafe is part of a res
taurant chain. Two others, one
in Mill Valley and one in Wal
nut Creek, bear the same name.

Each of the four people
dining in our party tried a differ
ent first course and main course.
Steamed Manila clams
($5.25) were prepared with
white wine, garlic, marjoram
and sweet butter, and were
served on a bed of spinach fet
tuccini. Perhaps a clam or two
more — or else a bit less fettuc
cini — would have improved
this otherwise scrumptious dish.
Steamed mussels ($5.45),
prepared in the classic manner,
were served mixed with
Julienne vegetables. The

vegetables, lost amongst the
shells, would have been better
on the side — or left off altoget
her. Otherwise, a triumph!
The fresh scallop ceviche
($5.25) was prepared with red
onions, peppers and cilantro.
The poignancy of the vegetables
gave a boost to the scallops
without enveloping them.
The seafood chowder ($2.50
for a bowl) didn't spare the
seafood; it was surprisingly
ample for the price.
For main courses we tried
grilled Hawaiian ahi (sweet fish)
with a roasted red pepper butter
($13.25), grilled Hawaiian ono
(fresh tuna) with lemon beurre
blanc ($13.95), grilled
blackened prime rib of beef
Cajun style ($13.95) and, from
the restaurant's wood burning
brick oven, a pizza with roasted
summer vegetables, fresh herbs
and mozzarella ($7.50).
The tuna was the least suc
cessful of the main dishes. The
butter sauce was not interesting
enough to distract attention
from the somewhat tough fish.
The prime rib, on the other
hand, was succulent. The meat,
seared by the liberal use of an
olive oil coating over the
mesquite grill, was burned
pitch-black on the outside,
while the inside remained rare
and juicy.
The ahi was a delightful new
"find." The fish didn't really

display the sweetness suggested
by the Hawaiian name, but that
didn't detract from its overall
quality.
The pizza was beautiful with
its peppers, yellow squash,
tomatoes and green beans, but
we felt it might have improved
from a more liberal use of
seasoning. It was also a bit
mushy.
California Cafe offers an ex
cellent choice of wines at a
reasonable markup. If you'd
rather bring your own bottle,
corkage fee is $5. Desserts and
different fresh breads are made
on the premises each morning.
Many of the entrees we or
dered were from the unusually
long list of daily specials. The
menu changes constantly based
upon the availability of in
gredients, said manager Jim
Zimmer.
Other entrees included many
grilled meats, from hamburger
($5.95) to loin lamb chops
($13.50).
