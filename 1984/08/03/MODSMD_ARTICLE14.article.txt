As its name implies, Califor
nia Cafe stresses fare of the
Golden State. Mesquite
charcoal-broiled fish, blackened
prime rib and snapper, light
sauces, steamed mussels and
clams are its specialties.
Open for only nine months,
California Cafe is part of a res
taurant chain. Two others, one
in Mill Valley and one in Wal
nut Creek, bear the same name.

Each of the four people
dining in our party tried a differ
ent first course and main course.
Steamed Manila clams
($5.25) were prepared with
white wine, garlic, marjoram
and sweet butter, and were
served on a bed of spinach fet
tuccini. Perhaps a clam or two
more — or else a bit less fettuc
cini — would have improved
this otherwise scrumptious dish.
Steamed mussels ($5.45),
prepared in the classic manner,
were served mixed with
Julienne vegetables. The

vegetables, lost amongst the
shells, would have been better
on the side — or left off altoget
her. Otherwise, a triumph!
The fresh scallop ceviche
($5.25) was prepared with red
onions, peppers and cilantro.
The poignancy of the vegetables
gave a boost to the scallops
without enveloping them.
The seafood chowder ($2.50
for a bowl) didn't spare the
seafood; it was surprisingly
ample for the price.
