# Winery tours range from educational to blah
## 
### NICK LASORSA 
There are three types of wine trippers
— those who overplan, those who under
plan and those who have a good time.
Some people plan trips to the wine
country with all the rigorous detail of an
overseas military expedition. You could
run out and buy a hefty wine touring
guide, for instance, and diligently read
about the hundreds of wineries in the
area, select the ones that sound most in
teresting to you. and set a time for each
visit. While this sounds eminently sen
sible, it's very easy to get carried away
with all that planning. You usually try to
do too much and end up not enjoying
nearly enough.
Other wine tourers go to the other ex
treme, take the come-what-may ap
proach, hop into the car and head north.
You could cruise the valleys hap
hazardly. for instance, stopping at which
ever wineries catch your fancy and hap
pen to be open.
The key to a memorable wine country
tour, however, lies somewhere in be
tween. Do a little planning, but don't let
your plans stifle the relaxing joy that a
wine country trip can bring.
While most visitors to the wire
country north of San Francisco make it a
one-day trip, a two-day excursion has
much to recommend it. Obviously, it al
lows you to visit more wineries but, in
addition, the longer visit lets you steep
yourself in fine foods and sleep content
edly after enjoying a variety of fine
grapes.
Don't expect to be able to handle
more than four wine tours in one day,
and think seriously about limiting your
self to three, with a couple of non-tour
tastings along the way.

The most difficult decision will be
which few wineries to visit. It is usually
while trying to resolve this question that
many people decide a two-day trip is in
order or, if that's not feasible, that more
trips will have to be made in the future.
Assuming you have never been to the
Napa Valley before and are going for
one day only, what do you do? Nearly
everyone makes a pilgrimage to the
Robert Mondavi Winery, so why not
you? The tour of the modern Mondavi
facility is more educational than most
and is praised for beginning at the begin
ning — with a visit to the grapes on the
vines.
The next few months are especially
good ones to visit the wineries because
its nearly time for "the crush." Because
ol the lack of rain this season, an early
harvest is coming to Napa and Sonoma
and soon, within the next few weeks, the
wineries will begin doing what they do
best, making wine. That's the best time
to visit. It you visit Mondavi now. you
will see the early grapes turning purple
right before your eves.
While the Mondavi tour is exceptional,
I personally don't care very much for its
tasting. Because of the huge crowds that
converge on the place each day, espe
cially on weekends, the tastings often are
rushed affairs with scores of people
crowded together like cattle. If this is
your only opportunity to compare Mon
davi wines, however, put up with it —
Mondavi makes some of the valley's best
wines.
A good contrast to the modern Mon
davi facility is the Christian Brothers'
venerable old winery but. unfortunately.
