# Winery tours range from educational to blah
## 
### NICK LASORSA 
There are three types of wine trippers
— those who overplan, those who under
plan and those who have a good time.
Some people plan trips to the wine
country with all the rigorous detail of an
overseas military expedition. You could
run out and buy a hefty wine touring
guide, for instance, and diligently read
about the hundreds of wineries in the
area, select the ones that sound most in
teresting to you. and set a time for each
visit. While this sounds eminently sen
sible, it's very easy to get carried away
with all that planning. You usually try to
do too much and end up not enjoying
nearly enough.
Other wine tourers go to the other ex
treme, take the come-what-may ap
proach, hop into the car and head north.
You could cruise the valleys hap
hazardly. for instance, stopping at which
ever wineries catch your fancy and hap
pen to be open.
The key to a memorable wine country
tour, however, lies somewhere in be
tween. Do a little planning, but don't let
your plans stifle the relaxing joy that a
wine country trip can bring.
While most visitors to the wire
country north of San Francisco make it a
one-day trip, a two-day excursion has
much to recommend it. Obviously, it al
lows you to visit more wineries but, in
addition, the longer visit lets you steep
yourself in fine foods and sleep content
edly after enjoying a variety of fine
grapes.
Don't expect to be able to handle
more than four wine tours in one day,
and think seriously about limiting your
self to three, with a couple of non-tour
tastings along the way.

The most difficult decision will be
which few wineries to visit. It is usually
while trying to resolve this question that
many people decide a two-day trip is in
order or, if that's not feasible, that more
trips will have to be made in the future.
Assuming you have never been to the
Napa Valley before and are going for
one day only, what do you do? Nearly
everyone makes a pilgrimage to the
Robert Mondavi Winery, so why not
you? The tour of the modern Mondavi
facility is more educational than most
and is praised for beginning at the begin
ning — with a visit to the grapes on the
vines.
The next few months are especially
good ones to visit the wineries because
its nearly time for "the crush." Because
ol the lack of rain this season, an early
harvest is coming to Napa and Sonoma
and soon, within the next few weeks, the
wineries will begin doing what they do
best, making wine. That's the best time
to visit. It you visit Mondavi now. you
will see the early grapes turning purple
right before your eves.
While the Mondavi tour is exceptional,
I personally don't care very much for its
tasting. Because of the huge crowds that
converge on the place each day, espe
cially on weekends, the tastings often are
rushed affairs with scores of people
crowded together like cattle. If this is
your only opportunity to compare Mon
davi wines, however, put up with it —
Mondavi makes some of the valley's best
wines.
A good contrast to the modern Mon
davi facility is the Christian Brothers'
venerable old winery but. unfortunately.


Sterling Winery
the place remains closed be
cause of structural problems. If
and when it opens again, that
would be another recommended
pilgrimage site for novice Napa
visitors.
Until then, a good substitute
would be Beringer Winery
which, when it comes to the
Napa Valley, is synonymous
with "old." Even if Christian
Brothers reopens, the Beringer
facility is worth the trip for its
architectural beauty alone.
Beaulieu Vineyards' tasting
may be as close to a "typical"
tasting as one can get, except for
the fact that you may be met at
the door and handed a glass of
Chablis, something you will not
experience at most tastings.
At a recent BV tasting, four
wines were poured, including
the Chablis and something
called "Beaurose," an '83 rose
that, like the Chablis, may
mercifully be described as life
less. But, as is normal at typical
wine tastings, you get the chaff
with the wheat. Just stand near
the dump bucket.
The BV tasting also included
two fine wines, the elegantly
dry, unusual '82 Johannisberg
Riesling and the '80 Rutherford
Cabernet Sauvignon, with its
exceptional nose and color that
match its taste.
Apparently noticing the
flourish with which we dumped
the Beaurose and savored the
Cabernet, our server went to the
back room and returned with a
glass of red. Asked what it was,
she replied, "You tell me." Of
course, it was the '79 Georges
de Latour Private Reserve
Cabernet Sauvignon, a great
wine with a long finish worthy of
completing any tour.
So, even a "typical" tour can
turn into an especially
memorable one, and that's one
«j*l. ,

of the special treats of a trip to
the wine country — its un
predictableness.
Many first-time visitors also
gravitate to Domaine Chandon,
where the classic method of
making champagne is fascinat
ingly demonstrated. There's a
fine restaurant there, too.
If you're interested in cham
pagne, you might also visit the
Hanns Kornell Champagne Cel
lars, a more intimate, family
oriented winery. Don't be
surprised if during your tasting
you see Hanns Kornell himself
in a corner of the tasting roon,
working his wines and looking
like an alchemist.
Another very popular tour is
given by Sterling Vineyards, at
the top of the valley. It costs
$3.50 per person to take the
tram ride up the hill to the im
posing white structure. There
you can take one of the valley's
few self-guided winery tours.
The wine tastings here tend to
be unspectacular. At a visit
during the last week in July, the
three wines poured were the '82
Sauvignon Blanc, the '82 house
Chardonnay and the '79 Caber
net Sauvignon.
Only the last one was as im
pressive as the view from atop
the hill. If they're going to pour
only three wines, the least they
can do is make one of them the
'81 Merlot!
Sterling cuts $2 from the price
of one bottle purchased on the
spot, excepting the very cheap
house red and white.
There are a score of other
popular tours, among them
Freemark Abbey, Inglenook,
and Louis Martini. There are
plenty of wine guides on the
market and most will do nicely.
The best for the money is Wine
Maps, put out by the Wine
Spectator once a year. The
latest edition just came out. It
costs $2 and covers the entire
state.
Be sure to save some time to
visit the home of a personal fa
utn lo'fiif* >

vorite, if you have any, but this
is where a little planning may
come in handy.
For instance, if you like
Joseph Phelps wines, as I do, be
forewarned that you cannot
taste without a tour and you
cannot tour without an appoint
ment. The Phelps winery sits on
a hill overlooking acres of fine
rolling hills that not long ago
grew grass, not vines. The
quickness with which the Phelps
wines have risen to fame is as
impressive as the views the
winery affords its visitors.
The Phelps tour, perhaps
taking a cue from Mondavi,
begins with a trip to the grapes,
in this case the Cabernet vines
that grow within a few feet of
the modern facility. The tour is
not exceptional, but it's the only
way to get to the wines. Our
guide, who also hosted the tas
ting, spent considerable time
telling us about how much faster
Mexican laborers pick than do
whites and how Phelps' pickers,
unlike those at some other
wineries, are "locals" because
Phelps uses them so many
months out of the year.
In fact, if you cannot make it
to Napa within the next few
months, that may be the reason
to go to Phelps for a tour. While
many wineries are beginning to
cut back on the types of wines

they produce, concentrating on
a few they do exceptionally well,
Phelps is bucking that trend
with a vengeance.
Having made a reputation
with its outstanding whites
during the last few years, Phelps
is now trying to make a name
for itself with its reds. This
means the winery probably will
be harvesting as long as any in
the valley, long into November,
for instance, for its famous
sweet Johannisberg Riesling
dessert wines.
Unfortunately. because
Phe/ps is focusing on its reds so
much these days, during a
recent visit its tasting also did
the same. Although we got to
taste the fat, buttery worth-the
trip '82 Sangiacomo Vineyard
Chardonnay and the novel '83
Late Harvest Scheurebe, for the
rest of the time we were seeing
red.
The zippy '80 Cabernet
Sauvignon may indeed demand
some attention in a few years
but it's simply too young now.
As for the '83 Napa Valley Zin
fandel, it admittedly departs in a
refreshing way from the heavy
style of most Zinfandels. One
can understand why wineries
might be pushing their Zinfs at a
time when most buyers (or, to
be more precise, non-buyers)
are pushing them right back.

When, however, someone
goes to the trouble of making an
appointment and taking a tour
at Phelps just to taste its wines,
they should be given the oppor
tunity to taste at least one of the
wines Phelps is justly famous for
today, the Gewurztraminer and
the various wonderful shades of
Johannisberg Riesling.
The Phelps tasting I took was
irritatingly hurried and in some
cases appallingly stingy. It ap
peared that some type of recep
tion was being held in the main
tasting room that day and this
may have contributed to the
brusque tour.
At Grgich Hills anything you
taste is likely to be worth the
trip. But there I go again, letting
my favorites get the best of me.
Of course, that's what wine
touring is all about. Once it's
over, you can come home and
boast to everyone about how
you found the best little wine in
California. There will be plenty
of folks around to argue with
you. Bring home a bottle or two
to argue your case. If you're
lucky, your opponents will
return the favor, bringing out
their little (or big) favorite.
If the evidence fails to work,
don't fret. Use it to whet your
memory of what a good time
you had, and to whet your appe
tite for another trip to the wine
country.

Napa Valley oak trees blend in with the architecture at Joseph Phelps Winery. Phelps' reputation
is built on red wines such as the Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel varieties.
