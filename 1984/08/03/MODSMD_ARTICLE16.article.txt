For trendy California
lunch—type fare, try the
Cuisine Renaissance.
This Napa-based restaurant
serves a limited menu of "now"
luncheon dishes — croissant
sandwiches, pasta al pesto with
bay shrimp, smoked salmon
with capers, pate and brie plates
— you get the picture.
We tried the pasta, the
"Special of the Day," which was
marvelous and ample. The com
bination of bay shrimp with
pesto was as unexpected as it
was pleasing. Both bay shrimp
and pasta al pesto are currently
popular entrees all over the
state but we had not previously

seen them combined into one
dish. It worked.
The cold salmon and capers,
served with cream cheese,
chopped onion and lemon, also
worked well together. The ser
ving was a bit skimpy, however.
We also tried the soup and
salad. The broccoli and sour
cream soup won us over with its
slightly raw, cuisinart texture.
I he salad of lettuce, mushroom
and feta would have seemed or
dinary had it not been for the
addition of celery root, some
thing we'd like to see more of.
The house-prepared vinaigrette
was tasty.
A good choice of wines was
available. The house wine, a
Round Hill chablis, cost $3 for a
half-carafe, and was a fine ac
companiment to our luncheon.

Although Cuisine Renais
sance offers a nice light lunch,
be prepared for less than at
tentive service. Although there
were only five tables in the res
taurant, plus a couple outside,
one waitress was not enough for
the noontime traffic.
Fortunately, no one wanted
to buy anything from the at
tached gourmet accessory store
during the lunch hour, since it
appeared that our waitress —
the only waitress — would have
been forced to deal with that as
well.
While we were there, the res
taurant seemed to be fre
quented mainJy by local resi
dents who monopolized the at
tention of the waitress.
Luncheon entrees ranged
from about $4 to $6.
