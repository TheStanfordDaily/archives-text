[The Goodman House

The owners of the Goodman
House spend a good part of
their time showing newcomers
that their bed and breakfast es
tablishment is a place worth re
turning to. Art and June Bowen
believe thev have done their job
well when the people who arrive
on Friday night with unsure,
even nervous looks on their
faces,Jeave on Sunday with
broad, relaxed smiles and a vow
to come back as soon as time
and money allow.
Having never stayed at an
American B&B. 1 was like at
ieast half of the people who ring
ihe door at 1225 Division Street
in downtown Napa.
1 am used to a private, paper
strip-around-the-to i let-set
bathroom, the kind that tries to
suggest it has never been
touched by human hands (but
you know it has.)
I am used to common
denominator motel walls de

signed to offend (and therefore
please) no one — nondescript,
uninteresting, predictable,
boring.
! am used to getting in and
getting out fast, spending as
little time as possible in these
confines. And. alter rereading
the above few sentences, now 1
think I know why 1 take that hit
and-run approach: motel living,
all in all, is none too pleasant.
I hat, basically, is the Ameri
can way of temporary lougine.
At least, that was the way
before bed and breakfast began
to catch on a few years ago.
B&Bs nave long been popular
in Britain, but the European
version is somewhat different
from ours. There, a ned and
breakfast usuailv means a cheap
wav to get by, something a step
above a youtn hostel but a step
below a standard hotel.
The American B&Bs tend to
be on a par with better hotels,
although prices can vary con
siderably between establish
ments and within establish
ments.

Ihe Goodman House, for in
stance. has accommodations
ranging from $55 to $75 per
night. There are four bedrooms.
The smallest room contains a
bed tor two. Two mid-size
rooms rent for $65 each. All of
these share a bath.
Ihe most luxurious accom
modations include an enormous
room (about as big as two large
bedrooms) with both a king-size
bed and a full-size brass bed.
With fireplace and private bath,
this room is> designed for one or
two couples.
Other B&Bs. however, cost
more or less, some considerably
more (see separate article on La
Residence.) The character of
American B&Bs also varies
greatly, and that s part of 'he
charm ot staying at them.
The Goodman House
bedrooms, all located on the
second floor, snare a small
kitchen where you can chill a
bottle of wine, store perishables,
or make a sandwich. The


Bottling wine


The Goodman House
refrigerator is stocked with cheeses,
meats, wines and other goodies. Coffee
and other beverages are also available.
Also sitting on the kitchen table was
June's own cake, a scrumptious
poundcake 1 could hardly resist.
The downstairs living room exudes the
atmosphere of a bygone era, from the
handsome parquet floors to the ornately
appointed fireplace to the velvety red
wallpaper, all reminiscent of a Victorian
parlor.
The dining room, where breakfast is
served family style in the morning,
makes an elegant backdrop for the
simple Continental fare of coffee and
tea, juices, fresh fruits and breakfast
rolls. We enjoyed honeydew melons,
cantaloupes, peaches, croissants and
m uffins.
Art and June say a good part of their
job is figuring out what their varied
guests want and giving it to them. "Some
come to get away from it all. and just
want us to leave them alone," Art said.

Art. who was born in the Napa Valley
and has lived with June in the Goodman
I louse for 16 years, w ill tell you anything
you want to know about the area — a
great reason for staying at a place like
this. Motel managers may hand you a
pamphlet, but Art and June will insist on
going way beyond that sort of impersonal
help.
The Goodman House is one of about a
dozen B&Bs in the city of Napa alone
and many others dot the valley.
There are a number of publications
that can help you decide on the type of
accommodaions you want. The Bed &
Breakfast Association of Napa Valley
puts out an Inn Guide & Directory. The
California Office of Tourism (1030 13th
Street, Suite 22, Sacramento, CA 95814)
puts out "California B&B Inns," an ex
cellent source for further information,
including lists of local B&B associations,
reservation services and referral services.
Since "bootleg" operations are apt to
spring up like weeds, be careful to find a
licensed B&B, which must meet all
safety and health standards. Or simply
take my advice and call Art and June.
The number's 707-257-1166. Tell them
