# Critic dislikes winery

The Charles Krug winery at St Helena
is the oldest winery established in Napa
Valley. Unfortunately, neither its build
ings nor the vineyards retain the same
ma jesty as other wine regions around the
world, of more ancient fame, do. The
cellars evoke those in European regions
devoted mainly to mass production, such
as Northern Italy, Languedoc or some
parts of Spain, rather than the august and
dark vaults in Burgundy or the classical
elegance of most of the Bordeaux
chateaux. l am not really sure that the
aristocratic art of wine-growing
combines very well with the frontier
spirit. Pioneers drink beer.
We were guided around the winer\ b\

a healthy and enthusiastic woman. There
is not too much to be expected from a
tour given mainly to people who hardly
know what wine is made with; so the
main asset of this visit was its shortness,
and that we quickly got to our goal â€” the
tasting.
The first white wine presented to us was
an honest and plain Grey Reisling, a
young, fruity, light wine; slightly too
sweet to my taste, but pleasant enough;
we say in French of those wines that they
"gouleyent," a word that evokes an en
joyable little singing of the wine between
your tongue and your palate.
