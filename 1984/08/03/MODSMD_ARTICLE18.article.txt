# Critic dislikes winery

### 
The Charles Krug winery at St Helena
is the oldest winery established in Napa
Valley. Unfortunately, neither its build
ings nor the vineyards retain the same
ma jesty as other wine regions around the
world, of more ancient fame, do. The
cellars evoke those in European regions
devoted mainly to mass production, such
as Northern Italy, Languedoc or some
parts of Spain, rather than the august and
dark vaults in Burgundy or the classical
elegance of most of the Bordeaux
chateaux. l am not really sure that the
aristocratic art of wine-growing
combines very well with the frontier
spirit. Pioneers drink beer.
We were guided around the winer\ b\

a healthy and enthusiastic woman. There
is not too much to be expected from a
tour given mainly to people who hardly
know what wine is made with; so the
main asset of this visit was its shortness,
and that we quickly got to our goal — the
tasting.
The first white wine presented to us was
an honest and plain Grey Reisling, a
young, fruity, light wine; slightly too
sweet to my taste, but pleasant enough;
we say in French of those wines that they
"gouleyent," a word that evokes an en
joyable little singing of the wine between
your tongue and your palate.
Next came a truly characteristic and
elegant Gewurztraminer. Gewurz
traminer is a grape variety from
Alsace (France), where the wines are
named (unlike in most other French
regions) after the variety of grape they
are made from. It is mellow and well
balanced, does not suffer from the excess
sweetness of the Riesling, and would be a
good accompaniment for oysters or Foie

gras.
The Zinfandel rose does not deserve
much comment. 1 don't like German
roses in general, and this one had all
their faults. It smelled like grape juice,
and gave an unpleasant impression of a
sparkling, acid and sugary liquid, which
the prospectus describes as a "gay (for
bubbly) pink wine, delicate and fruity."
The red Cabernet Sauvignon could
compare with a good average Medoc,
from a "petit Chateau." It has a nice
bouquet, not quite subtle enough for
"grand" Medoc (Medoc are the Bor
deaux wines grown west of the Gironde,

made mostly from Cabernet grapes
unlike the St. Emilions that need more of
the richer, nobler Merlot grapes). Its

The aristocratic art of
wine-growing doesn't
combine with the frontier
spirit. Pioneers drink beer.

"robe" is purple and deep. It lacks a bit
of the discreet and very British, elegant
wit a Chateau Margaux or a Mouton

Rothschild would have. Its smooth, nice
velvet taste reminded me of certain
Graves Bordeaux. I guess the decisive
factor on whether to choose this or a
Bordeaux "petit chateau" would be the
price. I suspect the final choice would be
made in favor of the latter.
At last, hardly worth mentioning, was
a Muscat, only for sale at the winery. It is
very sweet, to the point of masking any
other flavor. This syrupy liquid was not
my idea of anything enjoyable to drink;
but as Cicero put it,"De gustibus . . .
non disputandum."
