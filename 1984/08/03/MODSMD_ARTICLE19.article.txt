When you drive by Mustard's, the cool
gray and yellow graphic sign catches your
eye. When you see the crowd in the
parking lot, you'll realize you're not
alone. In an area laden with restaurants
trying to catch the tourists' eye and dol
lars, what makes this one stand out?
The guys who opened Mustard's
recently apparently know what they're
doing. Both of them worked for the res
taurant company that runs the successful
Mac Arthur Park chain, Prego's, and
Ciao. They've captured, for example, the
crisp graphic look of the 1980s that
everyone (even the designers of the
Olympic socctr signs) is trying to use,
some more successfully than others. And
more to the point, the "new California"
type food is very good also.
On a weekend you'll have to wait if
you don't make reservations. While you
do, you may as well sit at the attractive
bar and order some onion rings and
wine. Mustard's doesn't ignore the fact
that it lies in the heart of the wine
country. It offers a large variety of
premium wines by the glass and the wine
menu changes every couple of weeks just
to make life interesting.
The food offers a large enough variety
and high enough quality to please just
about anyone. The price range is also
wide, though since the menu is the same
for lunch and dinner some might find it a
little steep at noon. An inexpensive meal
might include a cheeseburger ($5.50) or
a Chinese chicken salad ($6.95). But we
didn't try any of these dishes, so you're
on your own.
There were four in our party and we
ate in the Chinese restaurant style so we
all got to try a variety of dishes.
We started off with the cornmeal
pancake with homemade sour cream and
caviar ($4.80), which we ordered

primarily because it sounded so bad that
we wanted to try it. After all, it's a lot
more fun to pan the tood than to praise
it. But to our culinary fortune and
literary misfortunes, the combination
was actually pleasant. The cornmeal
"pancake" was more like a crepe than a
pancake. There was a fairly large pile of
caviar on top. The cream sauce was thin,
but cut the strong caviar taste nicely .
We also had the fresh mussels, which
were in a very light herb sauce. The chef
seems to have a good knowledge of herbs
— many of the dishes were clearly en
hanced by them. Our third choice was
made to appease a member of our party
who claimed her family is hooked on
goat cheese. The warm goat cheese,
almond-coated with sun-dried tomatoes
and chives ($4.30) was deemed a bit
mild, but the rest of us thought it was
fine.
The menu contains items "from the
wood-burning oven," such as barbecued
baby back ribs ($8.65), and grilled quail
with mango, cilantro and almond
vinaigrette ($9.20). From this section we
tried the lightly smoked prawns, pan
fried in lemon garlic butter ($9.95). The
smoke taste was scarcely distinguishable
and the lemon flavor also did not come
through very well.
Another section on the menu is "from
the grill," which includes a good selec
tion of fresh fish. Two of us had the sal
mon steak, grilled and served with herb
butter. The steak itself was fresh and
flavorful and the herb butter was served
so that it could be enjoyed or pushed
aside. We also tried the grouper, which
was very mild-tasting. Grouper is a large
rock fish that isn't too attractive when it's
alive and doesn't gain any attractiveness
when it's served.
For light new California cuisine, Mus
tard's is a good choice. By the way I for
got to ask about the name. Ask when
you go and let me know.
