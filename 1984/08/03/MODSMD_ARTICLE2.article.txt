# Tie with Egypt ends U.S. medal hopes
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Call it the goal that never came. It was
the goal that would give the United
States a victory over Egypt last night. It
was the goal that would allow the U.S. to
advance to the quarterfinals of the
Olympic soccer tournament. It was the
goal that would allow the U.S. to play at
Stanford Stadium once again as the
Group D champion in the wake of Italy's
1-0 upset loss to Costa Rica. But it was
the goal that never came.
And so, because it was the goal that
didn't come, the United States Olympic
Soccer team walked away with a 1-1 tie
with an Egyptian team that will advance
to the quarterfinal round. The two teams
tied in the standings, but Egypt edged
out the U.S. on the slimmest of criteria.
Both teams had 1-1-1 records for
three points — two for a win, one for a
tie. Both teams scored two more goals
than they gave up. It came down to the
final tiebreaker — goals scored. I he
Egyptian team scored five in its three
games, the U.S. scored tour. Egypt ad
vances to the the quarterfinals, the
Americans go home to think about the
World Cup two years away.
"We had three or four good chances,"
American Coach AI k is Panagoulias said
afterward, "but none went in. That was
the game."
U.S. Captain Rick Davis, the star of
Sunday s 3-0 win over Costa Rica with
two goals, commented on the tie. "Sure
we're disappointed. But I suppose it we
were Egypt we would say 'terrific*. We
knew we had to win. This teaches us that
each game is important. We can count
back to earlier mistakes — a tie with
Italy would have enabled us to advance
with the tie tonight."
The U.S. struck early, scoring at the
7:45 mark on the most bizarre play of
the tournament thus far. Chico Horja

sent a crossing pass from the left side to
the right, where Gregg Thompson at
tempted to head the ball into the goal.
Thompson just missed, hitting the cros
sbar.
That's when the fun began. Badr Mah
moud. an Egyptian defender, was stand
ing in front of his goal, and he turned as
Thompson's shot hit the crossbar. He
shouldn't have. The ball bounced down,
carommed off Mahmoud's chest, and

went into the net for an "own goal."
It may not have been the prettiest way
to get ahead, but the Americans,
knowing they needed to win, were cer
tainly happy to take it.
That score seemed to wake up the
Egyptians, however. As Coach Abdou
Selah said, kk We played a much more ef
fective game after the United States
scored. Before the goal, it was in our
players' minds to tie — we were playing

to tie. After the goal, we started to play
our real football game."
They came back to forge the tie 20
minutes later. Emad Suleiman got the
tying goal on a pretty crossing pass from
teammate Mahmoud El Khatib. The pass
came from the right side of the net, just
in front of the end line, and Suleiman
lunged for the waist-high shot with his
head, and knocked it past U.S.
goalkeeper David Brcic, who had no
chance on the play.
The U.S. received a break when Adel
El Maamour, the Egyptian keeper, was
whistled by referee Jorge Romero of Ar
gentina for taking more than four steps
with the ball after a save. The Americans
received a free kick, but Davis' direct
kick from 20 yards out was blocked by
the Egyptian wall.
Two minutes later the U.S. received a
bad break when defender Jeff Durgan
pulled up lame with the same calf injury
that kept him sidelined for the first two
games. He was replaced by Hector
Perez.
Taher Abouzeid almost broke the tie
in the 37th minute, but he put the shot
over the crossbar, and so it remained 1-1
at the half. After their initial conser
vatism, the Egyptians came back to out
shoot the Americans, 12-7, in the first
half.
The second half was a 45-minute quest
for the goal that never came. At the 70-
minute mark, Davis was tripped up only
18 yards from the goal. Had he been
inside the 18-yard line of the penalty
area, a penalty kick — an uncontested
shot on the goalkeeper from 12 yards out
— would have been awarded, a kick that
most likely would have put the U.S.
ahead.
The referee, however, ruled that Davis
had been tripped outside the area. A
direct free kick was awarded from 18

yards away. Angelo Dißernardo took
the shot, but put it over the Egyptian
wall and over ine crossbar.
In the 74th minute, Steve Moyers took
his turn looking for the goal that never
came. Borja headed a pass to Moyers
only 15 yards out, but Moyers fired his
shot wide right.
The U.S. got a corner kick at 75
minutes. No goal. The Americans got an
other corner at 81 minutes. Again, no
dice. The quest continued.

In the 82nd minute, the referee
warned EI Maamour for taking too much
time holding onto the ball after a save,
pulling out the yellow card. Still no goal.
In the 87th minute, Perez took a shot
from 10 yards inside the penalty area. El
Maamour was equal to the task.
The tension grew. The Americans
needed a goal to prolong their Olympic
dreams. In the 88th minute, a group of
blue-clad players got behind the Egyp
tian defense, but were called offside.
By this time there were 21 players in
the Egyptian end. Only Brcic remained
on the U.S. half, and he was 35 yards out
of the goal. Everyone was waiting for the
goal.

It didn't come. In the 89th minute,
Showki Gharib broke into the American
end and fired a shot over the crossbar.
Brcic hurried the ball back into play.
The upward-ticking clock read
45:00.0. The referee allowed the match
to continue to make up for injury and
substitution time. No one but he knew
how much time remained, but it wasn't
much.
The Americans pressed for the goal.
But it didn't come. The whistle blew, and
the dream of making the quarterfinals,
the dream of winning a medal, was ended
— ended by the margin of one goal on
the third criterion.
"I thought we'd have at least four or

five minutes of injury time at the end of
the game," Davis said. "It was part of the
Egyptians' strategy to take a long time
with injuries or substitutions. But that
was not the reason we lost."
Panagoulias was looking toward the
future already. "This is the team that will
begin the quest for the World Cup in
September," he said, "As I said before,
our main target is the World Cup."
In the meantime, Egypt moves on to a
quarterfinal showdown Sunday with
Group A champion France at 7 p.m. at
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Italy, which
won Group D despite last night's loss,
will face Chile here at 3 p.m. that after
noon.

American Coach AI k is Panagoulias said
afterward, "but none went in. That was
the game."
U.S. Captain Rick Davis, the star of
Sunday s 3-0 win over Costa Rica with
two goals, commented on the tie. "Sure
we're disappointed. But I suppose it we
were Egypt we would say 'terrific*. We
knew we had to win. This teaches us that
each game is important. We can count
back to earlier mistakes — a tie with
Italy would have enabled us to advance
with the tie tonight."
The U.S. struck early, scoring at the
7:45 mark on the most bizarre play of
the tournament thus far. Chico Horja

sent a crossing pass from the left side to
the right, where Gregg Thompson at
tempted to head the ball into the goal.
Thompson just missed, hitting the cros
sbar.
That's when the fun began. Badr Mah
moud. an Egyptian defender, was stand
ing in front of his goal, and he turned as
Thompson's shot hit the crossbar. He
shouldn't have. The ball bounced down,
carommed off Mahmoud's chest, and

went into the net for an "own goal."
It may not have been the prettiest way
to get ahead, but the Americans,
knowing they needed to win, were cer
tainly happy to take it.
That score seemed to wake up the
Egyptians, however. As Coach Abdou
Selah said, kk We played a much more ef
fective game after the United States
scored. Before the goal, it was in our
players' minds to tie — we were playing

to tie. After the goal, we started to play
our real football game."
They came back to forge the tie 20
minutes later. Emad Suleiman got the
tying goal on a pretty crossing pass from
teammate Mahmoud El Khatib. The pass
came from the right side of the net, just
in front of the end line, and Suleiman
lunged for the waist-high shot with his
head, and knocked it past U.S.
goalkeeper David Brcic, who had no
chance on the play.
The U.S. received a break when Adel
El Maamour, the Egyptian keeper, was
whistled by referee Jorge Romero of Ar
gentina for taking more than four steps
with the ball after a save. The Americans
received a free kick, but Davis' direct
kick from 20 yards out was blocked by
the Egyptian wall.
Two minutes later the U.S. received a
bad break when defender Jeff Durgan
pulled up lame with the same calf injury
that kept him sidelined for the first two
games. He was replaced by Hector
Perez.
Taher Abouzeid almost broke the tie
in the 37th minute, but he put the shot
over the crossbar, and so it remained 1-1
at the half. After their initial conser
vatism, the Egyptians came back to out
shoot the Americans, 12-7, in the first
half.
The second half was a 45-minute quest
for the goal that never came. At the 70-
minute mark, Davis was tripped up only
18 yards from the goal. Had he been
inside the 18-yard line of the penalty
area, a penalty kick — an uncontested
shot on the goalkeeper from 12 yards out
— would have been awarded, a kick that
most likely would have put the U.S.
ahead.
The referee, however, ruled that Davis
had been tripped outside the area. A
direct free kick was awarded from 18

yards away. Angelo Dißernardo took
the shot, but put it over the Egyptian
wall and over ine crossbar.
In the 74th minute, Steve Moyers took
his turn looking for the goal that never
came. Borja headed a pass to Moyers
only 15 yards out, but Moyers fired his
shot wide right.
The U.S. got a corner kick at 75
minutes. No goal. The Americans got an
other corner at 81 minutes. Again, no
dice. The quest continued.

In the 82nd minute, the referee
warned EI Maamour for taking too much
time holding onto the ball after a save,
pulling out the yellow card. Still no goal.
In the 87th minute, Perez took a shot
from 10 yards inside the penalty area. El
Maamour was equal to the task.
The tension grew. The Americans
needed a goal to prolong their Olympic
dreams. In the 88th minute, a group of
blue-clad players got behind the Egyp
tian defense, but were called offside.
By this time there were 21 players in
the Egyptian end. Only Brcic remained
on the U.S. half, and he was 35 yards out
of the goal. Everyone was waiting for the
goal.

It didn't come. In the 89th minute,
Showki Gharib broke into the American
end and fired a shot over the crossbar.
Brcic hurried the ball back into play.
The upward-ticking clock read
45:00.0. The referee allowed the match
to continue to make up for injury and
substitution time. No one but he knew
how much time remained, but it wasn't
much.
The Americans pressed for the goal.
But it didn't come. The whistle blew, and
the dream of making the quarterfinals,
the dream of winning a medal, was ended
— ended by the margin of one goal on
the third criterion.
"I thought we'd have at least four or

five minutes of injury time at the end of
the game," Davis said. "It was part of the
Egyptians' strategy to take a long time
with injuries or substitutions. But that
was not the reason we lost."
Panagoulias was looking toward the
future already. "This is the team that will
begin the quest for the World Cup in
September," he said, "As I said before,
our main target is the World Cup."
In the meantime, Egypt moves on to a
quarterfinal showdown Sunday with
Group A champion France at 7 p.m. at
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Italy, which
won Group D despite last night's loss,
will face Chile here at 3 p.m. that after
noon.
Call it the goal that never came. It was
the goal that would give the United
States a victory over Egypt last night. It
was the goal that would allow the U.S. to
advance to the quarterfinals of the
Olympic soccer tournament. It was the
goal that would allow the U.S. to play at
Stanford Stadium once again as the
Group D champion in the wake of Italy's
1-0 upset loss to Costa Rica. But it was
the goal that never came.
And so, because it was the goal that
didn't come, the United States Olympic
Soccer team walked away with a 1-1 tie
with an Egyptian team that will advance
to the quarterfinal round. The two teams
tied in the standings, but Egypt edged
out the U.S. on the slimmest of criteria.
Both teams had 1-1-1 records for
three points — two for a win, one for a
tie. Both teams scored two more goals
than they gave up. It came down to the
final tiebreaker — goals scored. I he
Egyptian team scored five in its three
games, the U.S. scored tour. Egypt ad

Americans go home to think about the
