Chutney Kitchen
Vintage 1870 Mall
Yountville
707-974-2788
On your way to an afternoon of wine tasting in Napa
Valley, the Chutney Kitchen in the Vintage 1870 Mall
is a delightful place to stop off for a relaxing lunch. The
mall and restaurant are easy to find by taking the
Yountville exit off Highway 121 toward Napa.
Though the mall itself is chock-full of knick-knack
touristy boutiques, one can escape from all this and en
joy the country atmosphere by taking lunch on the
Chutney Kitchen patio. The patio is highly recom
mended over the interior rooms which open onto the
mall.

The menu is limited to a handful of salads, sand
wiches, specials and a couple of homemade desserts,
yet all are tempting for a light lunch. Particularly attrac
tive was the cheese, fruit and meat platter, which could
easily serve as either a healthy lunch for one or a snack
ing platter for four.
For lunch, we chose the shrimp salad and the t'T.a
salad, with the soup of the day, cream of zucchini, as a
starter, and fresh cheesecake for dessert. We also took
a bottle of the house white wine, which was an un
labeled Inglenook table wine.
The meal was simple but satisfying. The cream of
zucchini soup was tasty as well as warming, because the
weather was a bit chilly. Our salads were tossed in large
bowls, accompanied by warm rolls and soft butter. We
chose the oil and vinegar dressing, which was rpixed

with a nice blend of herbs. There was nothing ex
traordinary about our lunches, but the atmosphere, at
tentive service and escape from the touristy boutiques
made the stop more than worthwhile.
As I'm never one to pass on desserts, I insisted on
trying a piece of fresh cheesecake topped with thinly
sliced strawberries. It was not the best cheesecake I've
ever had, but it was adequate and rounded off the meal
nicely.
The patio's atmosphere and the restaurant's
reasonable prices are The Chutney Kitchen's strongest
points. Specials are priced from $4.25 to $5.25, salads
from $3.25 to $5.25 and sandwiches from $4.25 to
$4.95. The Kitchen is open for lunch every day.
