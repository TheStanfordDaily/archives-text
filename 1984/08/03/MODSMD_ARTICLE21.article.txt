## A 						tribute to Mason's consistent career 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
More than the rich, meticulously controlled voice ca
pable of amphitheatrical strength and subtle gradations
of emotion, more than the uncanny gift for conveying
intellectual depth in a scene, more than the celebrated
witty line readings, I think what I most admired in
James Mason was the economy of his acting. Drama
teachers instruct young actors and actresses in audition
classes how to approach a scene so that, from the very
beginning, they have seized the vital qualities of the
character they are playing; Mason, who died last week
at the age of 75, was always completely astonishingly
"there" from the moment he appeared in a movie — he
never had to work into a part. And so in the first two or
three minutes of a James Mason performance you un-

In the first two or three minutes of
a James Mason performance you

character than most actors express

vampirism and the potential for

derstood more about the character than most actors ex
press in two hours — the aggressive self-assurance, the
sexual vampirism and the potential for evil of the lecher
in The Pumpkin Eater, the charm and adolescent care
lessness and capacity for self-destruction of Norman
Maine, the alcoholic falling star in A Star Is Born.
Mason held a bachelor's degree in architecture from
Cambridge, earned in 1931, but went on the stage as
soon as he left college and into films in England four
years later. His first movie was called Late Extra, and
he made 18 more (including The Mill on the Floss, in
which he played George Eliot's Tom Tulliver opposite
Geraldine Fitzgerald) before the 1943 The Man in

Grey introduced the Mason prototype audiences would
devour for the next few years — a dashing sadist, best
portrayed, perhaps, in The Seventh Veil (1945), where
he played a repressed man whose love for his ward, a
gifted pianist (Ann Todd), is perverted into tyrannical
jealousy and posessiveness. When his portrayal of
Johnny Mac Queen, the Irish rebel, in Carol Reed's
1947 Odd Man Out established him as an actor of the
first rank, Mason left for Hollywood, where he ap
peared in two films by another European emigre. Max
Ophuls (Caught and The Reckless Moment), as Gustave
Flaubert in the preposterous framing story of the Vin
cente Minnelli Madame Bovary , as Rommel in the The
Desert Fox, as Brutus in Julius Caesar (to John Giel
gud's Cassius and Marlon Brando's Mark Antony), and
finally, in 1954, as Norman Maine in the second version
of A Star Is Born. The George Cukor musical
was Judy Garland's comeback vehicle after four years'
absence from movies, but though her naked acting —
closer to psychodrama than drama — was undeniably
effective and won her considerable praise, it was James
Mason's brilliant performance (ironicallly in the role of
the has-been who marries the blossoming star, Judy
Garland) that commanded the picture.
In nearly 50 years of motion picture acting. Mason
appeared in only a handful of really memorable films
(Odd Man Out, A Star Is Born, North by Northwest,
The Pumpkin Eater, The Deadly Affair, Lolita and one
or two others) but he gave remarkable performances in
many undistinguished ones. Though I only saw his
Trigorin in The Sea Gull (1968) once, during my fresh
man year at college, I remember his gentleness and
self-deprecation; with Vanessa Redgrave as a smashing
Nina (in an otherwise pretty dismal attempt at filming
Chekhov), this may have been one of the few Sea Gulls
in which one could find the heroine's fate heartbreak
ing without losing sympathy for her seducer. Mason's
Dr. Watson in the 1979 Murder by Decree stole Sher
lock Holmes' thunder (Christopher Plummer was
Holmes): He made Watson's gentility and conservatism
both humorous and touching. It was a bravura piece of
acting — like his work in the 1972 Child's Play, in
which he played a harassed schoolmaster teetering on
the edge of a breakdown. Even his small performances
tended to provide considerable pleasure in pictures like
Autobiography of a Princess and the Agatha Christie
adaptation Evil Under the Sun, and in his last major

film, The Verdict, where he played Paui Newmai. s ad

to precase preparation in his sizable firm bore an
amusing resemblance to football coaching.
What was Mason's finest " 112 tend to

the Stanley Kubrick Lolita (1962); certainly he was
never wittier or more enchantingly devious. It turned
out to be one of his last"big" roles, especially as> no one
came to see him in The Sea Gull or Child's Play, but for
the two decades that followed he continued to work,
and was often brilliant. His biography Lpiiraim
Katz's "The Film Encyclopedia," complete through
1979, shows that 1948 and 1955 were the only years in
which he did not make a movie — an impressive record
in an industry that had cut its output by more than half

The keynote of Mason's career was

Mason held a bachelor's degree in architecture from
Cambridge, earned in 1931, but went on the stage as
soon as he left college and into films in England four
years later. His first movie was called Late Extra, and
he made 18 more (including The Mill on the Floss, in
which he played George Eliot's Tom Tulliver opposite
Geraldine Fitzgerald) before the 1943 The Man in

Grey introduced the Mason prototype audiences would
devour for the next few years — a dashing sadist, best
portrayed, perhaps, in The Seventh Veil (1945), where
he played a repressed man whose love for his ward, a
gifted pianist (Ann Todd), is perverted into tyrannical
jealousy and posessiveness. When his portrayal of
Johnny Mac Queen, the Irish rebel, in Carol Reed's
1947 Odd Man Out established him as an actor of the
first rank, Mason left for Hollywood, where he ap
peared in two films by another European emigre. Max
Ophuls (Caught and The Reckless Moment), as Gustave
Flaubert in the preposterous framing story of the Vin
cente Minnelli Madame Bovary , as Rommel in the The
Desert Fox, as Brutus in Julius Caesar (to John Giel

finally, in 1954, as Norman Maine in the second version
of A Star Is Born. The George Cukor musical
was Judy Garland's comeback vehicle after four years'
absence from movies, but though her naked acting —
closer to psychodrama than drama — was undeniably
effective and won her considerable praise, it was James
Mason's brilliant performance (ironicallly in the role of
the has-been who marries the blossoming star, Judy
Garland) that commanded the picture.
In nearly 50 years of motion picture acting. Mason
appeared in only a handful of really memorable films
(Odd Man Out, A Star Is Born, North by Northwest,
The Pumpkin Eater, The Deadly Affair, Lolita and one
or two others) but he gave remarkable performances in
many undistinguished ones. Though I only saw his
Trigorin in The Sea Gull (1968) once, during my fresh
man year at college, I remember his gentleness and
self-deprecation; with Vanessa Redgrave as a smashing
Nina (in an otherwise pretty dismal attempt at filming
Chekhov), this may have been one of the few Sea Gulls
in which one could find the heroine's fate heartbreak
ing without losing sympathy for her seducer. Mason's
Dr. Watson in the 1979 Murder by Decree stole Sher
lock Holmes' thunder (Christopher Plummer was
Holmes): He made Watson's gentility and conservatism
both humorous and touching. It was a bravura piece of
acting — like his work in the 1972 Child's Play, in
which he played a harassed schoolmaster teetering on
the edge of a breakdown. Even his small performances
tended to provide considerable pleasure in pictures like
Autobiography of a Princess and the Agatha Christie
adaptation Evil Under the Sun, and in his last major

film, The Verdict, where he played Paui Newmai. s ad
versary, a brilliantly succesful lawyer whose approach
to precase preparation in his sizable firm bore an
amusing resemblance to football coaching.
What was Mason's finest " 112 tend to
think he was never better than as Humbert Humbert in
the Stanley Kubrick Lolita (1962); certainly he was
never wittier or more enchantingly devious. It turned
out to be one of his last"big" roles, especially as> no one
came to see him in The Sea Gull or Child's Play, but for
the two decades that followed he continued to work,

More than the rich, meticulously controlled voice ca
pable of amphitheatrical strength and subtle gradations
of emotion, more than the uncanny gift for conveying
intellectual depth in a scene, more than the celebrated
witty line readings, I think what I most admired in
James Mason was the economy of his acting. Drama
teachers instruct young actors and actresses in audition
classes how to approach a scene so that, from the very
beginning, they have seized the vital qualities of the
character they are playing; Mason, who died last week
at the age of 75, was always completely astonishingly
"there" from the moment he appeared in a movie — he
never had to work into a part. And so in the first two or
three minutes of a James Mason performance you un-
