wall of the building in red paint.
The force of the blast shattered windows of build
ings around the space agency headquarters and
damaged about a dozen cars parked along the street.
Police said six people were slightly injured by flying
glass when windows of their nearby homes were
blown out. Four were reported hospitalized.
The slogan "War against War" was daubed on the
building, along with the signature "Action Directe,'
or Direct Action.
The European Space Agency directs the
combined space program of several West European
