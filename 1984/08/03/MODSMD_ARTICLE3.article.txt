# Brazil wins outstanding match over FRG
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
One argument against soccer
ever being a popular sport in
this country is that it is too
boring. Critics say Americans
will not pay to watch a 1-0
game, no matter how well
played.
Wednesday night the
Brazilian and West German
Olympic soccer teams laid that
argument to rest. The teams
played nearly 87 scoreless
minutes before Augilmar
Oliveira ended the deadlock
and gave Brazil the 1-0 victory,
but the contest was likely the
finest soccer match that most of
the 75,239 fans here had ever
seen.
Well-played is one adjective
that could be used, but this was
not a game for adjectives. It was
a game to be watched, to be
savored. There were scoring op
portunities, but each time either
the defenses or the goalkeepers
were equal to the task before
Oliveira placed a free kick from
30 yards out into the upper left
corner of the net.
West German keeper Bernd
Franke made a valiant effort for
the shot, but came up empty for
the only time all night. Franke
was brilliant all night, finishing
with four official saves, but
having broken up several other
plays before a shot could be
taken.
The same could be said for
Franke's Brazilian counterpart,
Gilmar Rinaldi, who was also
credited with four saves, and
also broke up a few plays before
they developed.
The two teams had shown
contrasting styles all night. The

Brazilians played a wide-open
game, hoping to have a forward
break free behind the West
German line. The Germans, on
the other hand, played a
deliberate offense, setting up
and working the ball around for
an open shot in close.
The closest anyone came to
scoring before the deciding goal
was in the 72nd minute, when
Oliveira took a free kick from
35 yards out. "Gilmar," as he is
also known, fired a high shot at
the right side of the net. Franke
made a leaping effort, but had
no chance on the shot.
However, the attempt hit the
inside of the right post and
carommed off to the left, where
the German defense cleared it.
Three minutes later, Rahn
came back for West Germany,
taking an open shot from 10
yards out in front, but Rinaldi
was equal to the task.
Then, just as everyone was
expecting to leave a 0-0 dead
lock, Gilmar placed his shot into
the nylon cord behind Franke,
and the green-and-yellow-clad
Brazilian fans, waving dozens of
their country's flags, began to
celebrate their team's move into
the quarterfinals.
With 30 seconds left, Frank
Mill had one last chance to tie it
from only eight yards out. He
misfired on the shot, though,
which sailed harmlessly over the
goal, and the Brazilian celebra
tion was about to begin.
As the West German fans
carried their black, red and yel
low banners out of the stadium,
the Brazilians began a half-hour
of singing and flag waving as
their team left the field vic
torious.

West German Coach Erich
Ribbeck was dismayed by the
result, but not bitter. "My
feeling would be better if we
had tied and not lost," he said.
"It is very unfortunate to lose in
the final moments of a game
which you have in part
dominated."
Brazilian Coach Jair Pecerni
said his team didn't play for the
tie."I think that in Brazil we
play to win," he said. "This was a
game of good midfield play.
Soccer is a 90-minute game. and

we did score at the last minute,
and we did play to win. If you
play to tie, you are bound to
lose."
Gilmar commented on the
kick that won it, "To score on a
free kick takes practice more
than anything. I always practice
free kicks, even since I have
been in Los Angeles. I think I
have good success on free kicks.
"As 1 was about to take the
kick, 1 looked up and saw the
score and saw that we had only
two minutes left. / knew / had

been practicing a lot of free
kicks. I knew I had in my foot
the key for Brazil to win tonight.
I knew I could do it. I was trust
ing myself, anxious for the kick
to come, secure in myself and
very calm."
And so Brazil all but put a
lock on first place in Group C,
needing only to defeat Morocco
tonight, while West Germany
faces winless Saudi Arabia
needing a win or a Moroccan
loss to advance to the quarter
finuls.

misfired on the shot, though,
which sailed harmlessly over the
goal, and the Brazilian celebra
tion was about to begin.
As the West German fans
carried their black, red and yel
low banners out of the stadium,
the Brazilians began a half-hour
of singing and flag waving as
their team left the field vic
torious.

West German Coach Erich
Ribbeck was dismayed by the
result, but not bitter. "My
feeling would be better if we
had tied and not lost," he said.
"It is very unfortunate to lose in
the final moments of a game
which you have in part
dominated."
Brazilian Coach Jair Pecerni
said his team didn't play for the
tie."I think that in Brazil we
play to win," he said. "This was a
game of good midfield play.
Soccer is a 90-minute game. and

we did score at the last minute,
and we did play to win. If you
play to tie, you are bound to
lose."
Gilmar commented on the
kick that won it, "To score on a
free kick takes practice more
than anything. I always practice
free kicks, even since I have
been in Los Angeles. I think I
have good success on free kicks.
"As 1 was about to take the
kick, 1 looked up and saw the
score and saw that we had only
two minutes left. / knew / had

been practicing a lot of free
kicks. I knew I had in my foot
the key for Brazil to win tonight.
I knew I could do it. I was trust
ing myself, anxious for the kick
to come, secure in myself and
very calm."
And so Brazil all but put a
lock on first place in Group C,
needing only to defeat Morocco
tonight, while West Germany
faces winless Saudi Arabia
needing a win or a Moroccan
loss to advance to the quarter
finuls.
