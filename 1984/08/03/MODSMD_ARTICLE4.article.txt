Total goals scored. 4. Coin flip.
Group A
France — Won group with 1-0-2 record, 4 points.
Tied with Chile in standings, but scored five total goals
to Chile's two. Will face Egypt Sunday in quarterfinal
game at Pasadena.
Chile — Tied with France for group lead, but
finished second on basis of total goals scored. Will face
Italy here Sunday in quarterfinal match.
Norway — 2-0 win over Qatar assured 1-1-1 finish,
3 points, good for third place.
Qatar — Forged 2-2 draw with France, but lost next
two games to finish fourth.
Group B
Yugoslavia — Has clinched quarterfinal berth by
winning first two games. Will win group unless upset by
Iraq and Cameroon defeats Canada. Has +2 differen
tial, three goals scored.
Cameroon — Can clinch quarterfinal spot with vic
tory over Canada. A draw would probably suffice, but
Iraq could then tie for second with win over Yugos
lavia. Has 0 diffential, two goals scored.
Canada — Win over Cameroon would probably be
good for quarterfinal berth, but Iraq could still tie for
second with upset tonight. Has -1 differential, one goal
