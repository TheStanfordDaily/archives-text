## Todd Pilch A 						frustrated jock's Olympic observations 
### 
There was a time in my life when I
dreamed of signing a big contract with
the N.Y. Mets or standing on an Olympic
pedestal receiving a gold medal. It was
easy when I was an adolescent and had
my whole future lying ahead. Back then I
had role models like Johnny Bench (45
homers in 1970), Mark Spitz (seven gold
medals in 1972), or Joe Namath (Super
Bowl champion quarterback in 1969).
Every time I hit a baseball or avoided
schoolwork to go for a run, there was the
justification that I was just preparing for
mv life as an athlete.
Cold reality began to set in during high
school, when 1 realized that my legs did
not have the spring of Carl Lewis and my
jump shot did not have the Walt Frazier
radar. I would never be able to head-slap
Kyle Alzado or tackle O.J. Simpson. The
reality of the situation hurt quite a bit,
but I was able to take it in stride. Not
blessed with an athlete s genes, nor a
sports-oriented household, 1 was
destined for amateur/leisure sports —
crew, tennis, rugby. There must be many
others like me out there; frustrated, hurt
and rejected ex-jocks who know every
statistic of every professional and
amateur athlete.
Propped in front of a television with a
beer always in hand (my favorite Olym
pic venue is the living room), the ex-jock
is transfixed to the tube. Oftentimes I
watch two or three television sets at

once, betting on all the games. Many
people don't understand, but for the ex
jock, sports watching becomes more than
a passion. It is a compulsion — like
drinking and gambling. We need our fix.
Nowhere else but in sports can a person
experience the full range of emotions,
the spectrum of highs and lows.
So during these Olympic weeks, there
are few people that can offer more in
sightful comments about the games than

Carl Lewis is terribly annoying ... he's too cocky, too
wealthy, and now he gets a haircut that makes him
look like Grace Jones.

myself (or any other ex-jock for that
matter). We watch and study sport as a
religion and the Olympics to me are an
other good excuse to grab a couple beers
and vegetate in front of the television.
Now for the insights.
Carl Lewis is terribly annoying and I
am sure most people are rooting against
his quest for four gold medals. The guy is
too cocky, too wealthy, and now he gets
a haircut that makes him look like Grace
Jones. Also why does ABC keep on
talking about Carl's crystal collection?
Who cares?
Cathy Rigby has said Mary Lou Ret

ton is "Pete Rose in a leotard" no less
than five times. Please stop.
Why no soccer? The viewers of this
Olympics have had to watch boring
reports on LA nightlife. Rodeo Drive,
and skeet shooting. ABC has snubbed
soccer, never showing more than a two
minute clip of any U.S. game highlights.
What the hell is dressage and who
really cares what a horse looks like
prancing about in top hat and tails? The

only good horse is a betting horse. Send
these horses to the glue factory.
Jim McKay has offered wonderful in
formation for the viewer. Each night he
tells us the latest pronunciation for
Romania's newest gymnast, Ecaterina
Szabo.
Far too many reports on the Los An
geles freeways and the incredible lack of
traffic.
Curt Gowdy knows nothing about
rowing.
There is too much talk about Bobby
Knight being a genius for putting to
gether the awesome U.S. basketball

team. My mother could have done the
same job with the talent pool Knight had
to choose from.
Does Edwin Moses really need a home
computer to chart his workouts?
ABC insists on only showing events
where the U.S. dominates. The public is
more sophisticated than this. We would
like to see a little weightlifting, judo,
team handball, and yachting.
The five-ringed symbol of the Olym
pics has been vandalized. The network
has redesigned the top three rings to
form an ABC (blasphemy). This is al
most as annoying as Vidal Sassoon's
haircutting sessions or Jim McKay's in
credibly wide red tie. "Speak louder. I
can't hear you over that tie."
The list goes on and on, but I have no
more time to attack the Games. Time to
buy more beer and turn the television on.
No matter how bad coverage of the
Games gets, somehow I will always be
back for more punishment. Perhaps I
deserve a medal for this, or at least one
of ABC's wonderful "up close and per
sonal" reports. "Here sits Todd Pilch in
his living room. He is a champion at what
he does and takes Olympic viewing very
seriously . . .
When does the coverage for the Seoul,
South Korean Olympics (1988) start?
(Todd Pilch is a Brown graduate who will
start medical school in the fall. His
column appears every other Tuesday.)
