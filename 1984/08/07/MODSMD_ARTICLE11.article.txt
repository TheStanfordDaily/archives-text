## Irrigation wasteful 
### 
Besng • ... ... Stanford, i am
willing [•) pi,'iv ai.ri.g with the
bureaucracy re. k: owing that
large systc often do a good
job if you accord them plenty of
time and that the people who
choose to work in these systems
usually are genuinely interested
in doing good work.
Nevertheless, there is a group
of workers on campus with
whom I have little familiarity
except with their less than pro
fessional efforts. These are the

Viewpoint

groundspeople, the modern
farmers who keep this place so
lush, green and symmetrical.
Although I find the landscaping
here attractive, if not terribly
strident or exciting, there seems
to be a fair amount of wasteful
and careless practice in
evidence. Observation of the
work of the groundskeepers of
ten instills much the same
feeling which results from notic
ing the amount of recyclable
material thrown away here in
apparent disregard for the
highly visible and efficient recy
cling service.
A couple of examples illus
trate this point. First, the sprin
kling system: on several occa
sions I have passed through
(landed in) sod absolutely
saturated with water. Although
there is an obvious leak nearby,
the problem hasn't been fixed
for several weeks, and the
quagmire worsens. On at least
two occasions, a broken irriga
tion line has resulted in an im
pressive "geyser" near CERAS
(maybe someone should just
donate another fountain and the
problem would easily be solved)
which pours hundreds or
thousands of gallons of water
right back into the storm sewers.
Several flower and shrub beds
are consistently so saturated
that it's a wonder plants can
grow there (look around Green
or the Physics Tank). And the
regular sprinkling system is ter
ribly inefficient: think for a mo
ment how many times you have
walked or ridden your bike
around or through the sheets of
water which run over or accum

ulate on the asphalt walkways
and trails. The fine spray of the
sprinklers might be pretty to
look at, but it means at least two
other things right off: a good
deal of that finely aerated water
is lost to evaporation; and those
sprinkler heads plug up easily,
requiring a disproportionate
amount of time to keep clear. It
seems the same pipeline systems
could be left intact and con
verted into a more efficient ir
rigation system. Consider the
savings in water and cash. After
all, people here shouldn't take
the reservoirs in the Sierra for
granted, just as the Los Angeles
horde shouldn't take the Owens
Valley drainage (including the
Mono Lake drainage) for
granted.
The second point is about
general groundskeeping. Specif
ically, I have no patience with
those gasoline-powered air
blowers which are used to clear
debris from the asphalt on
campus. Although I grant there
might be some advantage to
these devices, I object to their
use on three grounds: they are
extremely noisy, unnecessarily
so (mornings are often filled
with a chorus of their voices);
they require a good deal of fuel
and maintenance, like any
troublesome machine does, and
they (ironically) stir up dust and
redeposit it in lungs and build
ings where it isn't appreciated,
especially the engineering build
ings, which contain a good
deal of sensitive equipment.
Whatever happened to the
"old-fashioned" 1 yet effective
broom? It strikes me that this is
another case of overkill, just as
some aspects of the irrigation
system are. There's nothing
wrong with using the tools you
need, but anyone would agree
that, especially if you're spend
ing other peoples' money, waste
is not only unethical, it's just
plain stupid.
As Thoreau wrote:
"Economy is a subject which
admits of being treated with
levity, but it cannot be so
disposed of."
