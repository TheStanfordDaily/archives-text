Balanced faith
is our best bet
Since the psyche is by defini
tion a universal phenomenon,
infinite, it cannot be demon
strated by the finite methods of
science. It is intuited in
"instants" (Kierkegaard),
"lightning moments"
(Mallarme), "privileged mo
ments . . . out of time" (Proust),
"epiphanies" (Joyce) and
"oceanic experience" (Jung).
Since practically all the great
writers and artists have ex
pressed the experience of spirit,
right up to our time (Camus,
Solzhenitzyn, Bellow, Wilbur,
Malamud, Updike), as well as
our most visionary scientists
(Einstein: "Science without reli
gion is lame"), to lack it is
clearly an incapacitating mis
fortune, like being tone deaf.
On the other hand, a spell as
associate editor of a journal of
occultism and parapsychology
(Tomorrow) cured me of any
hope in that direction, many
years ago.
There is no point in being
dogmatic in one's rejection: The
sufficient point is that there is
no need for these quirky
demonstrations which go
against the essential disin
terestedness or grace in the
deep experience of the beauty
of the world.
They are the sort of sensa
tional stuff one sees headlined
in those magazines dangling
next to the checkout counters in
supermarkets. One glances
curiously, a bit shamefacedly,
and passes on.
But even that glance is a more
promising attitude than the
blinkered rejection of the dog
matic materialists.
A corollary truism explains
why great writers have almost
never been liberals (Sidney

Hook was bemused by this fact
in his Jefferson address): They
sometimes appear as con
servatives (relatively
provocatively) but their
profoundest impulse is centrist.
Which is to say that they trea
sure whatever purchase they
have on totality, or a down-the
middle approach to that in this
life. They could see that at
tempts to impose neat schemes
on the complexity of reality, es
pecially social reality, have al
ways backfired in time. An
inspired "muddling through," a
balanced intuitivism (which
does not exclude rationality, but
merely knows its limits) is, they
knew, our best bet for improv
ing our lot collectively.
