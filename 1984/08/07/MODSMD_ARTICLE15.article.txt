## Olympic workers get a close look at Games 
### VINCE LARKIN 
Most Americans watch the Olympics on televi
sion. A lucky few get to see the Games up close.
But many Stanford students who stayed around
for the summer are part of the Olympics — not as
soccer players, but as Olympic workers and volun
teers.
There are more than 700 Olympic staff mem
bers working at Stanford — 600 volunteers and
100 employees — driving athletes around, ticket
ing, serving at concession stands, maintaining se
curity and ushering. Staff includes not only stu
dents, but volunteers and employees from both
inside and outside of the University. LAOOC or
ganizers in Palo Alto are proud that the volun
teers span all ages and occupations.
Volunteer Jon McPearson is a schoolteacher in
West Valley Grammar School and the soccer
coach tor Homestead High. All the members of
his soccer team are volunteers.
Kristen Jones, one of the team members, said
she learns a lot from watching the games. "I really
pick up a lot from watching these matches," she
said. " I hey have a lot of different styles of soccer
out there."
Her mother, optometrist Sheila Jones, is also a
volunteer. "1 would normally not get to see all
these matches but I'm really finding it excit
ing,"she said.
Many of the volunteers find the crowds are
more interesting than the games. Every night
thousands of tans trom the various countries pour
into the stadium with banners, flags, and their
own bands.
I work at a travel agency, and the reason 1 en
joy working these matches is the international
feeling of these events," commented usher cap
tain Robin Smith. "1 enjoy meeting people from
different lands — that's why I'm in the travel busi
ness."
Transportation volunteer Thomas D'Arezzo
also noted the international atmosphere. As a
Stanford employee, he works as an office assistant
all day; but at night he is in charge of driving the
German team to and from the matches. D'Arezzo
speaks fluent German and finds his whole Olym
pic experience to be a great opportunity. "In col
lege days I studied in Germany, and this really
gives me a great chance to meet people," he said.

"All of the players are really nice," he added.
LAOOC coordinator Brenda Pascoe explained
the dress code for the hundreds of Olympic volun
teers at the Stanford soccer matches.
Their uniforms are different colors. Ushers
wear blue and gold, with matching hats; transpor
tation workers wear green and white attire with
matching hats. The concession workers wear pink
and white uniforms with pink hats; vendors wear a
similar suit. Security people wear gray suits with
blue berets.
Most volunteers like their uniforms, and many
of them get to keep the uniforms when the games
are over.
"I really like these uniforms," said one usher,
"but these shoes have got to go." Most of the ush
ers and drivers agree that the official pink and
white shoes clash with their uniforms. Many admit
to getting strange looks from some fans, as well as
many of their friends and relatives.
i hope we get a large crowd tonight," usher
Greg Laurich exclaimed early Wednesday even
ing. "Last night it looked like we outnumbered
the fans."
The more people there are, the more work
there is for these volunteers. But the enjoyment is
in the excitement of the fans. "I couldn't believe
the fans Sunday night,"security guard Jesse Fann
exclaimed, "That wave wouldn't stop."
All volunteers have gone through orientations
to help them prepare for emergencies. The most
highly trained of the volunteer participants are
from the Palo Alto chapter of the American Red
Cross. These are all first aid instructors and emer
gency medical technicians. The majority of them
are members of the National Ski Patrol. They
wear white suits with walkie-talkies and carry
medical packs. Split into six teams of two persons
each, they patrol up and down the stadium. They
remain in radio contact with first aid stations in
the stadium and with all the medical personnel.
Although there have been reports from Los
Angeles that many of the volunteers are over
worked, poorly fed, and are growing resentful of
the way they've been treated, Palo Alto LAOOC
personnel coordinator Pat Hendry said there have
been no drop-outs among the volunteers here. "In
tact, I'm still getting calls from people wanting to
volunteer,"she said.
