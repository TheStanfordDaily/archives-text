# New implant fights common deafness

### LYDIA ROBINSON 
Stanford researchers have begun clinical trials on
cochlear implants. The multichannel device, designed
by Prof, of Surgery F. Blair Simmons and associates in
the medical center and department of engineering, will
help deaf persons with damaged cochleas .to partially
hear.
Normally, 30,000 hair cells, each sensitive to a differ
ent range of sound, line the cochlea, a snail-shaped or
gan that plays a vital role in hearing. These hairs con
vert sound transmitted from the middle ear to electrical
pulses passed on to the auditory nerves and brain.
When the cochlea fails, sensorineural deafness results.
You re not going to be able to duplicate the normal
ear and put 30,000 wires in," said Simmons, a professor
of otolaryngology who has implanted two of the
devices. But sound can be chopped — or coded — into
frequency segments, each of which will be carried by a
different electrode.
In true neural deafness, the auditory nerves fail and
the crucial link to the brain is cut, Simmons explained.
Even a cochlear implant is useless. The implant is also
no use to people with conductive deafness, whose
damaged outer or middle ears prevent sound from
reaching the cochleas, he added.
All I can say is it's the difference between hearing
and not hearing, said Amy Sullivan, 68. Sullivan has
been deaf for more than 40 years and is one of Stan
ford's two implant patients.
Only one of the eight electrodes is hooked to Sul

livan s device because the Food and Drug Administra
tion has yet to approve multichannel electrode use.
To produce hearing, the model picks up sound via a
microphone resembling a tie clip. The sounds are con
verted to electrical impulses by a processor worn in a
pocket or attached to clothing. The electrical impulses
travel up a wire to the receiver which is connected be
hind the ear to one of the eight electrodes implanted in
the person's cochlea, an inner ear organ vital to
hearing. In turn, the electrodes transmit pulses to the
brain via the auditory nerve.
Although wearers cannot hear normally, the implant
helps in several ways.
"First, some deaf people can't modulate their own
voices, and end up speaking too loud or soft; second,
its nice to know the car behind you is honking or a
semi-truck is about to pass; and finally, the implant aids
lip reading," Simmons said.
So far, no sound heard by wearers, even in laboratory
tests using all eight electrodes, is exactly what it would
be to a normal ear.
Low-trequency sounds like a dog's bark or knock at
the door, are relatively easy to code, explained Sim
mons. But high-frequency sounds, like human voices,
are another story. They sound electronic.
"It's like somebody talking under water," said Linda
Jansen, the other implant recipient. The 36-year-old
Jansen lost her hearing two years ago and says she is

more frustrated than helped by
the sound from the single chan
nel.
"Everything sounds the
same," she said. But Jansen has
high hopes for the multichannel
approach, once it is approved.
The range a given person can
hear cannot be predicted before
the implant is in place, Simmons
said, and laboratory tests show
that hearing improves as a pa
tient gains experience with the

implant.
Despite possible benefits, vol
unteers for implants are rare.
"Deaf pride is an incredible ob
stacle," Simmons said. "People
who have been deaf a long time
have made adjustments. The
people we see here have chosen
to stay in the hearing world."
