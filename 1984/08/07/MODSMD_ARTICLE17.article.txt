## Student campaigns for peace, justice 
### SUSAN PINZA 
Few students become truly politically
active during their four years here.
Fewer still take their commitments to
political issues and decide, unreservedly,
to turn them into a vocation.
Brad Barham is one of those few. A
Ph.D. candidate in economics, Barham
stopped out of Stanford this year to
spend more time on social issues. "I ap
proach problems on the social level and
work to change society," he said. "Peace
and justice are the two issues that are
most important to me. These are inex
tricably linked,"
Barham is the newly elected chair of
the board of the Mid-Peninsula Peace
Center, a peace coalition with 31 mem
ber groups. It is Barham's aim to see
these groups develop the issue of peace
and justice in the 1984 elections in two
ways.
"The first way," he said, is to bring the
issues of peace and justice into the fore
front of the debates, particularly in the
congressional race between Economics
Prof. Martin Carnoy and Rep. Ed
Zschau (R-Los Altos).
"The second is to bring it to the people
through voter participation. Issues must
come to the forefront rather than who
has the best TV commercials," he said.
Barham is also coordinator of the non
profit, non-partisan Valley Oak Institute

for Voter Participation, and is a member
of Stanford's Central America Action
Network (SCAAN).
Part of Barham's year off has been
spent in Nicaragua, after Barham
received a grant from the Latin Ameri
can Studies Department to study
Nicaragua's creation of its own market
for the banana industry. "Nicaragua will
sustain it if the CIA and Reagan don't
put an embargo on the country. They are
the most sufficient of the West Coast
producers." Barham said.
He sees the main flow of information
from the White House as a propaganda
campaign to justify the Reagan adminis
tration's policy rather than to tell the
truth about what is happening in Central
America."The vision is of Nicaragua as
an evil place, so it's okay to destroy the
country . . ." he said.
Barham believes Reagan's interests in
Nicaragua are twofold. "The first is
geopolitics, with its control of the
'backyard,' " he said. "Reagan is afraid
that if he can't control these 'backyard'
countries, our credibility as a world
power is diminished. The second is the
idea of the empire. Reagan is not willing
to let go of this. In my opinion, it would
serve us best to try to help them live in
peace. Poverty and structural inequality
should be concentrated on."
From his experience in Nicaragua,

Barham maintains that the Central
Americans hold nothing against the
American people, only against the U.S.
government, which they see as an
"enemy of humanity."
Barham said his interest in peace and
justice stems from his education and
background. He grew up in Berkeley and
attended the Walden School. "The
school was founded on the principles of
Thoreau, and justice and peace were
stressed," he said. "I became interested
in such issues and by the end of the third
grade, I had read most of Martin Luther
King's books." He attended an integra
ted high school and became concerned
with issues facing blacks. He graduated
from UC-San Diego in 1981, and came
to Stanford in the fall of that year.
The resources available at Stanford
are one of the most positive aspects of
the University, according to Barham.
SCAAN's anthology of the situation in
Central America, entitled "Revolution
in Central America," is an important
resource, he said.
Published in 1983, it was the first
major work that dealt with the entire
region and has drawn attention to
SCAAN as a major organization.
Barham also emphasizes that at Stan
ford, "we have some levers on U.S.
policy and we must use them." He cited
as an example a vote in spring 1983 in

the House Foreign Affairs Committee on
whether or not to send $100 million in
aid to El Salvador.
The outcome was 16 to 14 against and
SCAAN takes some of the credit for this
Two of those against were Congressmen
Tom Lantos (D-Hillsborough) and Ed
Zschau, and both of these men had been
approached by SCAAN.
Barham is encouraged, though, that "a
general sense has been produced that the
80s will be a decade of public service. 1
would urge (University) President Ken
nedy to continue his efforts on emphasiz
ing public service. I would urge him to be
even more explicit."
Groups that go out on voter registra
tion campaigns are urged by Barham to
do as much listening to the registrant as
they do talking. They also try to get the
person to connect with the issue in which
he has the most interest. "I steer the per
son to a group that addresses his con
cerns."
What will the peace movement focus
on in the November election? "Peace
and justice! We will push Zschau and
Carnoy to address peace and justice in
the context of civil rights, women's
rights, foreign policy, defense and eco
nomics. We will make this an election of
issues and frame it around peace and
justice," Barham asserted.

Brad Barham is one of those few. A
Ph.D. candidate in economics, Barham
stopped out of Stanford this year to
spend more time on social issues. "I ap
proach problems on the social level and
work to change society," he said. "Peace
and justice are the two issues that are
most important to me. These are inex
tricably linked,"
Barham is the newly elected chair of
the board of the Mid-Peninsula Peace
Center, a peace coalition with 31 mem
ber groups. It is Barham's aim to see
these groups develop the issue of peace
and justice in the 1984 elections in two
ways.
"The first way," he said, is to bring the
issues of peace and justice into the fore
front of the debates, particularly in the
congressional race between Economics
Prof. Martin Carnoy and Rep. Ed
Zschau (R-Los Altos).
"The second is to bring it to the people
through voter participation. Issues must
come to the forefront rather than who
has the best TV commercials," he said.
Barham is also coordinator of the non
profit, non-partisan Valley Oak Institute

for Voter Participation, and is a member
of Stanford's Central America Action
Network (SCAAN).
Part of Barham's year off has been
spent in Nicaragua, after Barham
received a grant from the Latin Ameri
can Studies Department to study
Nicaragua's creation of its own market
for the banana industry. "Nicaragua will
sustain it if the CIA and Reagan don't
put an embargo on the country. They are
the most sufficient of the West Coast
producers." Barham said.
He sees the main flow of information
from the White House as a propaganda
campaign to justify the Reagan adminis
tration's policy rather than to tell the
truth about what is happening in Central
America."The vision is of Nicaragua as
an evil place, so it's okay to destroy the
country . . ." he said.
Barham believes Reagan's interests in
Nicaragua are twofold. "The first is
geopolitics, with its control of the
'backyard,' " he said. "Reagan is afraid
that if he can't control these 'backyard'
countries, our credibility as a world
power is diminished. The second is the
idea of the empire. Reagan is not willing
to let go of this. In my opinion, it would
serve us best to try to help them live in
peace. Poverty and structural inequality
should be concentrated on."
From his experience in Nicaragua,

Barham maintains that the Central
Americans hold nothing against the
American people, only against the U.S.
government, which they see as an
"enemy of humanity."
Barham said his interest in peace and
justice stems from his education and
background. He grew up in Berkeley and
attended the Walden School. "The
school was founded on the principles of
Thoreau, and justice and peace were
stressed," he said. "I became interested
in such issues and by the end of the third
grade, I had read most of Martin Luther
King's books." He attended an integra
ted high school and became concerned
with issues facing blacks. He graduated
from UC-San Diego in 1981, and came
to Stanford in the fall of that year.
The resources available at Stanford
are one of the most positive aspects of
the University, according to Barham.
SCAAN's anthology of the situation in
Central America, entitled "Revolution
in Central America," is an important
resource, he said.
Published in 1983, it was the first
major work that dealt with the entire
region and has drawn attention to
SCAAN as a major organization.
Barham also emphasizes that at Stan
ford, "we have some levers on U.S.
policy and we must use them." He cited
as an example a vote in spring 1983 in

the House Foreign Affairs Committee on
whether or not to send $100 million in
aid to El Salvador.
The outcome was 16 to 14 against and
SCAAN takes some of the credit for this
Two of those against were Congressmen
Tom Lantos (D-Hillsborough) and Ed
Zschau, and both of these men had been
approached by SCAAN.
Barham is encouraged, though, that "a
general sense has been produced that the
80s will be a decade of public service. 1
would urge (University) President Ken
nedy to continue his efforts on emphasiz
ing public service. I would urge him to be
even more explicit."
Groups that go out on voter registra
tion campaigns are urged by Barham to
do as much listening to the registrant as
they do talking. They also try to get the
person to connect with the issue in which
he has the most interest. "I steer the per
son to a group that addresses his con
cerns."
What will the peace movement focus
on in the November election? "Peace
and justice! We will push Zschau and
Carnoy to address peace and justice in
the context of civil rights, women's
rights, foreign policy, defense and eco
nomics. We will make this an election of
issues and frame it around peace and
justice," Barham asserted.
