# National report suggests new radiation facility
## 
### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
The University is one of
several p<j»sjL.c sites for a new
$160 million high-energy
synchrotron radiation facility,
according to a recent report by a
National Research Council
panel.
The facility, which is unlikely
to begin construction before
1987, would be an important
addition to the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL), said SSRL Direc
tor Arthur Bienenstock.
With the new equipment, "we
would be better able to look at
how atoms arrange them
selves," said Bienenstock. "It
would change the way we're
able to look at things like how
atoms vibrate and would enable
us to do X-ray microprobes."
The facility would cost $125
million to build and an extra
$35 million to supply with
equipment. Annual operating
expenses would be $20-$25 mil
lion.
"We intend to compete for
construction of the six billion
electron volt facility," said
Bienenstock.

He said Cornell University,
Brookhaven National Labora
tory in New York and Argonne
National Laboratory near
Chicago are likely to be Stan
ford's principal competitors for
the project.

But Bienenstock said Stan
ford has an edge, because
"SSRL has more experience in
the design of such storage rings
and their effects than any other
laboratory in the United
States."
He noted that the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SI.AC) has already built three
similar storage rings. Brook

haven and several other re
search centers have not been as
successful with their attempts to
build storage rings, Bienenstock
said.
The recommendation for con
struction of the new facility was
part of a 78-page report issued
by a 22-member group which
studied national priorities for
materials research during the
next ten years.
Two Stanford scientists, Prof,
of Materials Science Engineer
ing William Nix and Prof, of
Clinical Medicine Edward
Rubenstein, served on the
panel.
"I couldn't speculate on the
likelihood of the facility coming
to Stanford," said Nix. "This is
only a recommendation of
priorities."
But if the project is approved,
"Stanford is certainly one of the
strongest contenders," Nix said.
Nix emphasized that while the
report concentrated on
priorities for major facilities,
there is also a great need for
graduate student fellowships
and other small-scale research.
