## Olympic Coach Johnson candid about Games 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
When the University's athletic depart
ment published the 1984 press guide for
its track and field teams, it's unlikely
anybody thought twice about listing the
U.S. Olympic trials as the final event of
Stanford's season.
Going into the trials last month, a half
dozen Stanford athletes had a good shot
at making the U.S. Olympic track and
field team, and their coach was already
there.
Injuries and upsets left shot putter
Carol Cady as the only Stanford member
of the U.S. track team, but Johnson is at
the Olympics anyway, coaching a U.S.
squad that includes world record holders
Mary Decker and Joan Benoit and star
sprinters Evelyn Ashford and Valerie
Brisco-Hooks.
As the U.S. Olympic women's track
coach, Johnson is now in Los Angeles to
lead some of America's finest female
athletes into competition, a position to
which he s grown accustomed during his
first five years as Stanford's track and
field coach.
Training the likes of NCAA'Cham
pions Ceci Hopp (3000 meters — '82 in
doors), PattiSue Plumer (2-mile — '83
indoors, 5000 meters — '84 outdoors)

and Cady (shot put — *83 outdoors, dis
cus — '84 outdoors), it would be easy to
rest on your reputation. But Brooks
Johnson has a lot more than Stanford
athletes'going for him.
An alumnus of Tufts University and
the University of Chicago, Johnson is a
former world record holder in the indoor
60-yard dash, the founder of Sports In
ternational Track Cluh, a track and field
technical adviser and guest commentator
for CBS Sports, a contributor to Sports
Illustrated and Track and Field News, a
former head coach of the U.S. National
Team, the U.S. Pan American Team and
the U.S. National Indoor Team, Running
World magazine's 1982 Coach of the
Year, and Stanford's first first-ever black
head coach in any sport.
Johnson has led Stanford's women's
cross country team to three consecutive
top-three finishes at the NCAA Cham
pionships and the women's track team to
consistent top-10 national showings.
But for Brooks Johnson, principles are
more important than accomplishments.
"Brooks is a sweetheart," said one of
Johnson's charges. "It's just his damn
principles. If he'd put them aside, he'd be
better off emotionally, he'd be better off

physically, and he'd be better off finan
cially. But he won't do that. He's the
only man in the world who is un
bribable."
It doesn't take long to discover what
must be the key principle for Brooks
Johnson: Don't bullshit yourself.
Whether he's describing an athlete's
motivations or the Soviet Union's Olym
pic boycott, Johnson is honest. Brutally
honest.
"That's not harsh, that's real," he says
repeatedly of his views, which strike
away at many of our romanticized no
tions about athletics and athletes. "It's
not harsh to say Mt. St. Helen's erupted.
It's real."
So Johnson leaves the "thrill of victory
and agony of defeat" Olympic pontificat
ing to Howard Cosell and Jim McKay
and the other hounds of hype who make
up the sports media, a group Johnson
calls "probably one of the most
destructive things of all" facing the
modern Olympics.
"They've taken something that was
called the 'Olympic Games,' with a cer
tain amount of emphasis on both
'Olympic' and 'Games,' and taken the
emphasis completely out of 'Games' and
put it on 'Olympics,' " Johnson says.
"They've romanticized and idealized
and waxed poetic about the Olympics to
make it something that it never was and
never will be."
The media, Johnson says, have made

the Games out to be an "exercise in the
romance of sports and athletics and ath
letes, something the Olympics simply
aren't.
"From the very inception, the idea was
to provide entertainment for the war
lords and the landowners," Johnson ex
plains. "The athletes were just the
pawns. It hasn't changed.
"The idea that athletes could come up
with superior, superb performances is
one thing, but that people have been
made to believe it's for the athletes is a
crock of shit. During the Games, the ath
letes stay in the worst housing, they're
cramped, and the warlords, the lOC and
the USOC, they have the best condi
tions."
And Johnson says the preference
given the corporate sponsors and the In
ternational and United States Olympic
Committees doesn't end at housing,
either.
"If you go down to L.A., I'm willing to
bet you, you'll be able to tell what venues
the stewardesses work by what they look
like. The best-looking stewardesses are
going to work for the damn press venue
and the lOC. The worst-looking ones
will be the interpreters for the Olympic
athletes.'"
In order for the Olympics to survive,
Johnson says, the warlords must be
pleased. And in a capitalist society, that's
not necessarily bad. But it's the truth,
and nobody should fool himself into
thinking otherwise.
"The Olympics is a billion dollar
proposition, at the minimum. Where do
you get that kind of money? You get it
through media support." Johnson says.

"I'm realistic enough to know that's
what's happening, and that's fine. But I
don't think anybody should kid anybody
what the hell's going on."
For Johnson, the bottom line of sports
is "putting asses on numbers." During a
late afternoon workout session, he gazed
out from under his trademark panama
hat to look at the empty bleachers in
Stanford's 85,000-seat stadium. "We've
got all these numbers, all these seats are
numbered, and we're putting asses on
them. If you're not putting asses on
them, that's it. Over and out. The Olym
pics are just another jive-ass event."
How, then, can this "jive-ass event"
draw hundreds of the world's best ath
letes every four years? The answer,
Johnson says, is money. Shoe companies'
incentive contracts make the Olympics a
big-bucks enterprise for the nation's top
runners.
"Supposedly, the gold medal in the
100 meters alone is worth a quarter of
million dollars," Johnson says. "If Car!
Lewis ends up getting four gold medals,
which would equal Jesse Owens, then I
think he'd be in a position to get a mil
lion dollars or more. It'll be worth a mil
lion dollars to him one way or another."
And with shoe companies
"sponsoring" athletes — Puma outfits
Stanford's track and field teams in shoes
and clothing and pays Johnson for con
sulting services — Johnson says it's
hypocritical to keep America's openly
professional athletes out of the Games.
"There's no" Olympic athlete that, by
somebody's definition, isn't profes
sional," Johnson says. "Take a college
athlete. A college athlete at Stanford

gets a stipend that's worth, up front,
$13,500 a year. In terms of what it costs
to educate him, you're talking about an
other fifteen or twenty thousand. So
you're talking about $36,000 a year for
an athlete that's being attracted to Stan
ford. That's a hell of a lot of money. You
multiply that over four years, and you're
talking about a shitpot of money. So
who's to say who's an amateur and who
isn't? It's just some silly-ass arbitrary de
termination."
Besides, Johnson says, if the Olympics
are a way to prove the superiority of na
tions and their political systems,
capitalist countries should be
represented by professionals — the
products of the capitalist system.
"The people in the first Olympics were
paid warriors and soldiers, so where did
all this bullshit about amateurism come
in? And why, if you're a democratic
capitalist, why is it such a bad idea, and
why do you have to be ashamed, to take
the money?" Johnson asks.
And because higher Olympic finishes
mean higher shoe company bonuses for
athletes during those nine days in Los
Angeles, Johnson says he isn't disap
pointed that the Soviets are cutting down
on the competition by boycotting this
summer's Games.
"All the bullshit about the Russians
not being here is a crock of shit,"
Johnson says."I can't imagine any ath
lete of consequence who should be upset
the Russians aren't going to be there.
Shoe contracts play a big part, so a lot of
them will make a lot more money."
A week before the boycott
was announced, Johnson told a
group of students that the
Soviets were "between a rock
and a hard place" in deciding
whether to come to the Games.
"If they go, the East Germans
are gonna whip their ass,"
Johnson told the students. "And
if they stay home, (Soviet Bloc)
countries will go anyway. And
what will that do? Embarrass
the leader of the Soviet Bloc."
But Johnson isn't willing to
guess about the Soviets' motives
anymore.
The day the Soviets an
nounced they would boycott the
Games, dozens of reporters ap
peared at Stanford's DeGuerre
Pool to interview Johnson,
Stanford Women's Swimming
Coach George Haines, who
helped coach the U.S. Olympic
team, and a handful of Stan

ford's Olympic hopefuls.
Johnson gave the reporters their
quotes, but now he says he's
tired of talking about the
boycott.
"I don't give a damn, and 1
really don't see why anybody
else gives a damn. If a gorilla
and 12 chimpanzees left the San
Diego Zoo, nobody would close
down the zoo. There were
Olympic Games before the Rus
sians, and there will be Olympic
Games after."
And there will be Brooks
Johnson, with his cut-to-the
bone comments that must make
Olympic organizers wince. But
he says they've never tried to
stop him.
"I'm an American citizen and
I went to war for my country,"
Johnson says."The lOC. the
USOC, they're not going to take
anything away from me. A
bunch of white-ass crackers
couldn't do it with shotguns, so
how the hell are they going to
do it with words?"

Stanford Track Coach Brooks Johnson points out several flaws
in the current structure of the Olympic Games.
When the University's athletic depart
ment published the 1984 press guide for
its track and field teams, it's unlikely
anybody thought twice about listing the
U.S. Olympic trials as the final event of
Stanford's season.
Going into the trials last month, a half
dozen Stanford athletes had a good shot
at making the U.S. Olympic track and
field team, and their coach was already
there.
Injuries and upsets left shot putter
Carol Cady as the only Stanford member
of the U.S. track team, but Johnson is at
the Olympics anyway, coaching a U.S.
squad that includes world record holders
Mary Decker and Joan Benoit and star
sprinters Evelyn Ashford and Valerie
Brisco-Hooks.
As the U.S. Olympic women's track
coach, Johnson is now in Los Angeles to
lead some of America's finest female
athletes into competition, a position to
which he s grown accustomed during his
first five years as Stanford's track and
field coach.
Training the likes of NCAA'Cham
pions Ceci Hopp (3000 meters — '82 in
doors), PattiSue Plumer (2-mile — '83
indoors, 5000 meters — '84 outdoors)

and Cady (shot put — *83 outdoors, dis
cus — '84 outdoors), it would be easy to
rest on your reputation. But Brooks
Johnson has a lot more than Stanford
athletes'going for him.
An alumnus of Tufts University and
the University of Chicago, Johnson is a
former world record holder in the indoor
60-yard dash, the founder of Sports In
ternational Track Cluh, a track and field
technical adviser and guest commentator
for CBS Sports, a contributor to Sports
Illustrated and Track and Field News, a
former head coach of the U.S. National
Team, the U.S. Pan American Team and
the U.S. National Indoor Team, Running
World magazine's 1982 Coach of the
Year, and Stanford's first first-ever black
head coach in any sport.
Johnson has led Stanford's women's
cross country team to three consecutive
top-three finishes at the NCAA Cham
pionships and the women's track team to
consistent top-10 national showings.
But for Brooks Johnson, principles are
more important than accomplishments.
"Brooks is a sweetheart," said one of
Johnson's charges. "It's just his damn
principles. If he'd put them aside, he'd be
better off emotionally, he'd be better off

physically, and he'd be better off finan
cially. But he won't do that. He's the
only man in the world who is un
bribable."
It doesn't take long to discover what
must be the key principle for Brooks
Johnson: Don't bullshit yourself.
Whether he's describing an athlete's
motivations or the Soviet Union's Olym
pic boycott, Johnson is honest. Brutally
honest.
"That's not harsh, that's real," he says
repeatedly of his views, which strike
away at many of our romanticized no
tions about athletics and athletes. "It's
not harsh to say Mt. St. Helen's erupted.
It's real."
So Johnson leaves the "thrill of victory
and agony of defeat" Olympic pontificat
ing to Howard Cosell and Jim McKay
and the other hounds of hype who make
up the sports media, a group Johnson
calls "probably one of the most
destructive things of all" facing the
modern Olympics.
"They've taken something that was
called the 'Olympic Games,' with a cer
tain amount of emphasis on both
'Olympic' and 'Games,' and taken the
emphasis completely out of 'Games' and
put it on 'Olympics,' " Johnson says.
"They've romanticized and idealized
and waxed poetic about the Olympics to
make it something that it never was and
never will be."
The media, Johnson says, have made

the Games out to be an "exercise in the
romance of sports and athletics and ath
letes, something the Olympics simply
aren't.
"From the very inception, the idea was
to provide entertainment for the war
lords and the landowners," Johnson ex
plains. "The athletes were just the
pawns. It hasn't changed.
"The idea that athletes could come up
with superior, superb performances is
one thing, but that people have been
made to believe it's for the athletes is a
crock of shit. During the Games, the ath
letes stay in the worst housing, they're
cramped, and the warlords, the lOC and
the USOC, they have the best condi
tions."
And Johnson says the preference
given the corporate sponsors and the In
ternational and United States Olympic
Committees doesn't end at housing,
either.
"If you go down to L.A., I'm willing to
bet you, you'll be able to tell what venues
the stewardesses work by what they look
like. The best-looking stewardesses are
going to work for the damn press venue
and the lOC. The worst-looking ones
will be the interpreters for the Olympic
athletes.'"
In order for the Olympics to survive,
Johnson says, the warlords must be
pleased. And in a capitalist society, that's
not necessarily bad. But it's the truth,
and nobody should fool himself into
thinking otherwise.
"The Olympics is a billion dollar
proposition, at the minimum. Where do
you get that kind of money? You get it
through media support." Johnson says.

"I'm realistic enough to know that's
what's happening, and that's fine. But I
don't think anybody should kid anybody
what the hell's going on."
For Johnson, the bottom line of sports
is "putting asses on numbers." During a
late afternoon workout session, he gazed
out from under his trademark panama
hat to look at the empty bleachers in
Stanford's 85,000-seat stadium. "We've
got all these numbers, all these seats are
numbered, and we're putting asses on
them. If you're not putting asses on
them, that's it. Over and out. The Olym
pics are just another jive-ass event."
How, then, can this "jive-ass event"
draw hundreds of the world's best ath
letes every four years? The answer,
Johnson says, is money. Shoe companies'
incentive contracts make the Olympics a
big-bucks enterprise for the nation's top
runners.
"Supposedly, the gold medal in the
100 meters alone is worth a quarter of
million dollars," Johnson says. "If Car!
Lewis ends up getting four gold medals,
which would equal Jesse Owens, then I
think he'd be in a position to get a mil
lion dollars or more. It'll be worth a mil
lion dollars to him one way or another."
And with shoe companies
"sponsoring" athletes — Puma outfits
Stanford's track and field teams in shoes
and clothing and pays Johnson for con
sulting services — Johnson says it's
hypocritical to keep America's openly
professional athletes out of the Games.
"There's no" Olympic athlete that, by
somebody's definition, isn't profes
sional," Johnson says. "Take a college
athlete. A college athlete at Stanford

gets a stipend that's worth, up front,
$13,500 a year. In terms of what it costs
to educate him, you're talking about an
other fifteen or twenty thousand. So
you're talking about $36,000 a year for
an athlete that's being attracted to Stan
ford. That's a hell of a lot of money. You
multiply that over four years, and you're
talking about a shitpot of money. So
who's to say who's an amateur and who
isn't? It's just some silly-ass arbitrary de
termination."
Besides, Johnson says, if the Olympics
are a way to prove the superiority of na
tions and their political systems,
capitalist countries should be
represented by professionals — the
products of the capitalist system.
"The people in the first Olympics were
paid warriors and soldiers, so where did
all this bullshit about amateurism come
in? And why, if you're a democratic
capitalist, why is it such a bad idea, and
why do you have to be ashamed, to take
the money?" Johnson asks.
And because higher Olympic finishes
mean higher shoe company bonuses for
athletes during those nine days in Los
Angeles, Johnson says he isn't disap
pointed that the Soviets are cutting down
on the competition by boycotting this
summer's Games.
"All the bullshit about the Russians
not being here is a crock of shit,"
Johnson says."I can't imagine any ath
lete of consequence who should be upset
the Russians aren't going to be there.
Shoe contracts play a big part, so a lot of
them will make a lot more money."
A week before the boycott
was announced, Johnson told a
group of students that the
Soviets were "between a rock
and a hard place" in deciding
whether to come to the Games.
"If they go, the East Germans
are gonna whip their ass,"
Johnson told the students. "And
if they stay home, (Soviet Bloc)
countries will go anyway. And
what will that do? Embarrass
the leader of the Soviet Bloc."
But Johnson isn't willing to
guess about the Soviets' motives
anymore.
The day the Soviets an
nounced they would boycott the
Games, dozens of reporters ap
peared at Stanford's DeGuerre
Pool to interview Johnson,
Stanford Women's Swimming
Coach George Haines, who
helped coach the U.S. Olympic
team, and a handful of Stan

ford's Olympic hopefuls.
Johnson gave the reporters their
quotes, but now he says he's
tired of talking about the
boycott.
"I don't give a damn, and 1
really don't see why anybody
else gives a damn. If a gorilla
and 12 chimpanzees left the San

Soviets were "between a rock
and a hard place" in deciding
whether to come to the Games.
"If they go, the East Germans
are gonna whip their ass,"
Johnson told the students. "And
if they stay home, (Soviet Bloc)
countries will go anyway. And
what will that do? Embarrass
the leader of the Soviet Bloc."
But Johnson isn't willing to
guess about the Soviets' motives
anymore.
The day the Soviets an
nounced they would boycott the
Games, dozens of reporters ap
peared at Stanford's DeGuerre
Pool to interview Johnson,
Stanford Women's Swimming
Coach George Haines, who
helped coach the U.S. Olympic
team, and a handful of Stan

ford's Olympic hopefuls.
Johnson gave the reporters their
quotes, but now he says he's
tired of talking about the
boycott.
"I don't give a damn, and 1
really don't see why anybody
else gives a damn. If a gorilla
and 12 chimpanzees left the San
Diego Zoo, nobody would close
down the zoo. There were
Olympic Games before the Rus
sians, and there will be Olympic
Games after."
And there will be Brooks
Johnson, with his cut-to-the
bone comments that must make
Olympic organizers wince. But
he says they've never tried to
stop him.
"I'm an American citizen and
I went to war for my country,"
Johnson says."The lOC. the
USOC, they're not going to take
anything away from me. A
bunch of white-ass crackers
couldn't do it with shotguns, so
how the hell are they going to
do it with words?"

Stanford Track Coach Brooks Johnson points out several flaws
in the current structure of the Olympic Games.
When the University's athletic depart
ment published the 1984 press guide for
its track and field teams, it's unlikely
anybody thought twice about listing the
U.S. Olympic trials as the final event of
Stanford's season.
Going into the trials last month, a half
dozen Stanford athletes had a good shot
at making the U.S. Olympic track and
field team, and their coach was already
there.
Injuries and upsets left shot putter
Carol Cady as the only Stanford member
of the U.S. track team, but Johnson is at
the Olympics anyway, coaching a U.S.
squad that includes world record holders
Mary Decker and Joan Benoit and star
sprinters Evelyn Ashford and Valerie
Brisco-Hooks.
As the U.S. Olympic women's track
coach, Johnson is now in Los Angeles to
lead some of America's finest female
athletes into competition, a position to
which he s grown accustomed during his
first five years as Stanford's track and
field coach.
Training the likes of NCAA'Cham
pions Ceci Hopp (3000 meters — '82 in
doors), PattiSue Plumer (2-mile — '83
indoors, 5000 meters — '84 outdoors)

and Cady (shot put — *83 outdoors, dis
cus — '84 outdoors), it would be easy to
rest on your reputation. But Brooks
Johnson has a lot more than Stanford
athletes'going for him.
An alumnus of Tufts University and
the University of Chicago, Johnson is a
former world record holder in the indoor
60-yard dash, the founder of Sports In
ternational Track Cluh, a track and field
technical adviser and guest commentator
for CBS Sports, a contributor to Sports
Illustrated and Track and Field News, a
former head coach of the U.S. National
Team, the U.S. Pan American Team and
the U.S. National Indoor Team, Running
World magazine's 1982 Coach of the
Year, and Stanford's first first-ever black
head coach in any sport.
Johnson has led Stanford's women's
cross country team to three consecutive
top-three finishes at the NCAA Cham
pionships and the women's track team to
consistent top-10 national showings.
But for Brooks Johnson, principles are
more important than accomplishments.
"Brooks is a sweetheart," said one of
Johnson's charges. "It's just his damn
principles. If he'd put them aside, he'd be
better off emotionally, he'd be better off

physically, and he'd be better off finan
cially. But he won't do that. He's the
only man in the world who is un
bribable."
It doesn't take long to discover what
must be the key principle for Brooks
Johnson: Don't bullshit yourself.
Whether he's describing an athlete's
motivations or the Soviet Union's Olym
pic boycott, Johnson is honest. Brutally
honest.
"That's not harsh, that's real," he says
repeatedly of his views, which strike
away at many of our romanticized no
tions about athletics and athletes. "It's
not harsh to say Mt. St. Helen's erupted.
It's real."
So Johnson leaves the "thrill of victory
and agony of defeat" Olympic pontificat
ing to Howard Cosell and Jim McKay
and the other hounds of hype who make
up the sports media, a group Johnson
calls "probably one of the most
destructive things of all" facing the
modern Olympics.
"They've taken something that was
called the 'Olympic Games,' with a cer
tain amount of emphasis on both
'Olympic' and 'Games,' and taken the
emphasis completely out of 'Games' and
put it on 'Olympics,' " Johnson says.
"They've romanticized and idealized
and waxed poetic about the Olympics to
make it something that it never was and
never will be."
The media, Johnson says, have made

the Games out to be an "exercise in the
romance of sports and athletics and ath
letes, something the Olympics simply
aren't.
"From the very inception, the idea was
to provide entertainment for the war
lords and the landowners," Johnson ex
plains. "The athletes were just the
pawns. It hasn't changed.
"The idea that athletes could come up
with superior, superb performances is
one thing, but that people have been
made to believe it's for the athletes is a
crock of shit. During the Games, the ath
letes stay in the worst housing, they're
cramped, and the warlords, the lOC and
the USOC, they have the best condi
tions."
And Johnson says the preference
given the corporate sponsors and the In
ternational and United States Olympic
Committees doesn't end at housing,
either.
"If you go down to L.A., I'm willing to
bet you, you'll be able to tell what venues
the stewardesses work by what they look
like. The best-looking stewardesses are
going to work for the damn press venue
and the lOC. The worst-looking ones
will be the interpreters for the Olympic
athletes.'"
In order for the Olympics to survive,
Johnson says, the warlords must be
pleased. And in a capitalist society, that's
not necessarily bad. But it's the truth,
and nobody should fool himself into
thinking otherwise.
"The Olympics is a billion dollar
proposition, at the minimum. Where do
you get that kind of money? You get it
through media support." Johnson says.

"I'm realistic enough to know that's
what's happening, and that's fine. But I
don't think anybody should kid anybody
what the hell's going on."
For Johnson, the bottom line of sports
is "putting asses on numbers." During a
late afternoon workout session, he gazed
out from under his trademark panama
hat to look at the empty bleachers in
Stanford's 85,000-seat stadium. "We've
got all these numbers, all these seats are
numbered, and we're putting asses on
them. If you're not putting asses on
them, that's it. Over and out. The Olym
pics are just another jive-ass event."
How, then, can this "jive-ass event"
draw hundreds of the world's best ath
letes every four years? The answer,
Johnson says, is money. Shoe companies'
incentive contracts make the Olympics a
big-bucks enterprise for the nation's top
runners.
"Supposedly, the gold medal in the
100 meters alone is worth a quarter of
million dollars," Johnson says. "If Car!
Lewis ends up getting four gold medals,
which would equal Jesse Owens, then I
think he'd be in a position to get a mil
lion dollars or more. It'll be worth a mil
lion dollars to him one way or another."
And with shoe companies
"sponsoring" athletes — Puma outfits
Stanford's track and field teams in shoes
and clothing and pays Johnson for con
sulting services — Johnson says it's
hypocritical to keep America's openly
professional athletes out of the Games.
"There's no" Olympic athlete that, by
somebody's definition, isn't profes
sional," Johnson says. "Take a college
athlete. A college athlete at Stanford

gets a stipend that's worth, up front,
$13,500 a year. In terms of what it costs
to educate him, you're talking about an
other fifteen or twenty thousand. So
you're talking about $36,000 a year for
an athlete that's being attracted to Stan
ford. That's a hell of a lot of money. You
multiply that over four years, and you're
talking about a shitpot of money. So
who's to say who's an amateur and who
isn't? It's just some silly-ass arbitrary de
termination."
Besides, Johnson says, if the Olympics
are a way to prove the superiority of na
tions and their political systems,
capitalist countries should be
represented by professionals — the
products of the capitalist system.
"The people in the first Olympics were
paid warriors and soldiers, so where did
all this bullshit about amateurism come
in? And why, if you're a democratic
capitalist, why is it such a bad idea, and
why do you have to be ashamed, to take
the money?" Johnson asks.
And because higher Olympic finishes
mean higher shoe company bonuses for
athletes during those nine days in Los
Angeles, Johnson says he isn't disap
pointed that the Soviets are cutting down
on the competition by boycotting this
summer's Games.
"All the bullshit about the Russians
not being here is a crock of shit,"
Johnson says."I can't imagine any ath
lete of consequence who should be upset
the Russians aren't going to be there.
Shoe contracts play a big part, so a lot of
them will make a lot more money."
A week before the boycott
was announced, Johnson told a
group of students that the
Soviets were "between a rock
and a hard place" in deciding
whether to come to the Games.
"If they go, the East Germans
are gonna whip their ass,"
Johnson told the students. "And
if they stay home, (Soviet Bloc)
countries will go anyway. And
what will that do? Embarrass
the leader of the Soviet Bloc."
But Johnson isn't willing to

anymore.
