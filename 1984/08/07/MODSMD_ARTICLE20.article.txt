## Olympic Coach Johnson candid about Games 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
When the University's athletic depart
ment published the 1984 press guide for
its track and field teams, it's unlikely
anybody thought twice about listing the
U.S. Olympic trials as the final event of
Stanford's season.
Going into the trials last month, a half
dozen Stanford athletes had a good shot
at making the U.S. Olympic track and
field team, and their coach was already
there.
Injuries and upsets left shot putter
Carol Cady as the only Stanford member
of the U.S. track team, but Johnson is at
the Olympics anyway, coaching a U.S.
squad that includes world record holders
Mary Decker and Joan Benoit and star
sprinters Evelyn Ashford and Valerie
Brisco-Hooks.
As the U.S. Olympic women's track
coach, Johnson is now in Los Angeles to
lead some of America's finest female
athletes into competition, a position to
which he s grown accustomed during his
first five years as Stanford's track and
field coach.
Training the likes of NCAA'Cham
pions Ceci Hopp (3000 meters — '82 in
doors), PattiSue Plumer (2-mile — '83
indoors, 5000 meters — '84 outdoors)

and Cady (shot put — *83 outdoors, dis
cus — '84 outdoors), it would be easy to
rest on your reputation. But Brooks
Johnson has a lot more than Stanford
athletes'going for him.
An alumnus of Tufts University and
the University of Chicago, Johnson is a
former world record holder in the indoor
60-yard dash, the founder of Sports In
ternational Track Cluh, a track and field
technical adviser and guest commentator
for CBS Sports, a contributor to Sports
Illustrated and Track and Field News, a
former head coach of the U.S. National
Team, the U.S. Pan American Team and
the U.S. National Indoor Team, Running
World magazine's 1982 Coach of the
Year, and Stanford's first first-ever black
head coach in any sport.
Johnson has led Stanford's women's
cross country team to three consecutive
top-three finishes at the NCAA Cham
pionships and the women's track team to
consistent top-10 national showings.
But for Brooks Johnson, principles are
more important than accomplishments.
"Brooks is a sweetheart," said one of
Johnson's charges. "It's just his damn
principles. If he'd put them aside, he'd be
better off emotionally, he'd be better off
