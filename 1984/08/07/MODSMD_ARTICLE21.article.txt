Something else is going on in the
river
More vital than death - death
here seems a superficiality
Of small scaly limbs, parasitical.
More grave than life
Whose reflex jaws and famished
crystals
Seem incidental
Tc this telling -
Something else indeed is
going on in "River," Ted
Hughes' new collection of
poems. The frequent violence of
his past work alienated many
readers, and seemed to bespeak
an obsession, instead of growing
out of a comprehensive vision
that might include other themes.
"River" does not turn away
from the casualties of nature,
but in it Hughes displays more
clearly his broad concern with
life in a world whose creatures
must fight to survive. Violent
death is an inescapable part of
such subject matter, but this new
collection gives more attention
to the entire life cycle, stressing
the importance of reproduction
and birth.
This reorientation is apparent

in the arrangement of the
poems. Starting just before
Christmas, Hughes follows the
seasons in a sequence of poems
that describe various rivers and
events around them during the
year. The recurrent motif in
these descriptions is the spawn
ing of fish, especially of salmon,
and the viewpoint from which
they are seen is often that of a
fisherman.
Hughes' interest in anthro
pology and primitive mythology
was apparent in his previous
books, but the kind of culture
influencing him seemed one of
nomadic hunters. Naturally, the
attitude as well as the subject
matter developing from such a
background would be relatively
savage, centering on the
struggle between predator and
prey. In "River" Hughes often
specifies an observing persona,
and thus presents an interpreta
tion of the material described
that puts the particulars into a
broader perspective. And be
cause the observer is a fisher
man, he can also introduce more
events from the lives of the
animals. A fisherman's attitude
is more agricultural than
predatory, and he can more
actively observe and even par
ticipate in the reproductive
cycles of the animals. In"The
Morning Before Christmas,"
Hughes depicts men catching

salmon and milking them for
eggs and sperm, to raise young
fish in a hatchery.
In this and in other poems
about fishing in England and
abroad there is a gladness and
pleasure in the natural world
that again marks a change from
the harsher, more pessimistic
poems of "Crow" or
"Gaudete," Hughes' last major
books. But the choice of salmon
as the "heroes" of this new
book is not untrue to Hughes'
old preoccupations. For the cul
minating event of their lives —
the return to their birthplace to
spawn — is intimately linked to
their death.
In the poem "New year,"
Hughes suggests why he has so
frequently been led to concen
trate on death rather than birth.
He introduces the metaphor of a
Caesarian section to evoke his
imagination of the spawning
grounds on a freezing night. He
lingers over the gruesome
details of the operation, but his
conclusion undercuts this em
phasis:
And walking in the morning in
the blue glare of the ward
1 shall feel in my head the
anaesthetic,
The stiff gauze, the congeal
ments. I shall see
The gouged patient sunk in her

trough of coma -
The lank, dying fish. But not the
ticking egg.
This poem makes its ideas
more explicit than some of the
others do, but it is not one of the
better pieces in this collection. It
reminds me of "Crow," Hughes'
most important book so far. In
"Crow," Hughes was trying to
provides pieces of a whole myth

ology about a sin Je character.
The individual poems present
Crow's various cosmic ad
ventures. Though they make
their points clear, the poems of
ten lack conclusiveness, and the
whole collection's arrangement
is much more random than that
of "River." "Crow" is still an
outstanding book, with plenty of
fine lines as well as an ambitious
conception, but in it Hughes'
characteristically shocking

themes lose their impact by
being abstracted, as well as too
often repeated. Without suffici
ent particulars, "blood"
becomes just another word, and
is no more striking than the
word "love" on a Valentine.
"River" is free of these draw
backs. Hughes has written his
vivid metaphors into poems that
are cohesive wholes. They do
not simply recall primitive song
and folktale, but also give an

immediate sense of the natural
world that inspires such crea
tions. The allusions and refer
ences of the poems are more
subtle and richer than those of
"Crow." A few particularly fine
lines can be excerpted, such as
"the slow claim / Of the buz
zard's hand," or "The parochial
downdrag / Of the pool's long
diphthong." A line describing
the river "hung by the heels
down the door of a dam"
reminds one of Hughes' interest
in Anglo-Saxon myth and its al
literative poetry.
The keen intensity of Hughes'
observation has kept its edge
over the years, but the response
to the savage world that his vis
ion discovers has been tempered.
He now seems to notice a
greater variety in the events of
nature, and records each with a
greater sensitiv < to the whole
range on which narks a point.
The poems in * W er" seem the
products of a le s compulsive
personality than ne felt in his
past work, and-1 < moderation
of this new colic (ion may put
his other poems i a perspective
that could broack: their appeal.
Whether or not it is read with a
knowledge of his other work,
Ted Hughes' "River" can only
confirm the reputation he has
gained as one of Britain's finest
poets.
