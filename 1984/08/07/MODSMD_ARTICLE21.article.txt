Something else is going on in the
river
More vital than death - death
here seems a superficiality
Of small scaly limbs, parasitical.
More grave than life
Whose reflex jaws and famished
crystals
Seem incidental
Tc this telling -
Something else indeed is
going on in "River," Ted
Hughes' new collection of
poems. The frequent violence of
his past work alienated many
readers, and seemed to bespeak
an obsession, instead of growing
out of a comprehensive vision
that might include other themes.
"River" does not turn away
from the casualties of nature,
but in it Hughes displays more
clearly his broad concern with
life in a world whose creatures
must fight to survive. Violent
death is an inescapable part of
such subject matter, but this new
collection gives more attention
to the entire life cycle, stressing
the importance of reproduction
and birth.
This reorientation is apparent

in the arrangement of the
poems. Starting just before
Christmas, Hughes follows the
seasons in a sequence of poems
that describe various rivers and
events around them during the
year. The recurrent motif in
these descriptions is the spawn
ing of fish, especially of salmon,
and the viewpoint from which
they are seen is often that of a
fisherman.
Hughes' interest in anthro
pology and primitive mythology
was apparent in his previous
books, but the kind of culture
influencing him seemed one of
nomadic hunters. Naturally, the
attitude as well as the subject
matter developing from such a
background would be relatively
savage, centering on the
struggle between predator and
prey. In "River" Hughes often
specifies an observing persona,
and thus presents an interpreta
tion of the material described
that puts the particulars into a
broader perspective. And be
cause the observer is a fisher
man, he can also introduce more
events from the lives of the
animals. A fisherman's attitude
is more agricultural than
predatory, and he can more
actively observe and even par
ticipate in the reproductive
cycles of the animals. In"The
Morning Before Christmas,"
Hughes depicts men catching


Ted Hughes' new book of poems marks a shift in the tenor of his work.
