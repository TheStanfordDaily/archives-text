# After Moonless Midnight

I waded, deepening, and the fish
Listened for me. They watched my each move
Through their magical skins. In the stillness *
Their eyes waited, furious with gold brightness,
Their gills moved. And in their thick sides
The power waited. And in their torpedo
Concentration, their mouth-aimed intent,
Their savagery waited, and their explosion.
They waited for me. The whole river
Listened to me, and, blind,
Invisibly watched me. And held me deeper
With its blind, invisible hands.
"We've got him," it whispered, "We've got him."
