## 'Narayama' shows rigidity, private hell 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Set in northern Japan a cen
tury ago, Shohei Imamura's The
Ballad of Narayama presents a
harsh vision of life on the edge
of poverty, and pursues it
relentlessly — almost merci
lessly. For those who make their
home in a village on the slope of
Mount Shinshy, farming and
fishing provide the only
livelihood, but the land is stub
born and yields crops reluc
tantly, and there is always some
doubt about surviving the win
ter. So the society is an elemen
tal one, centered on food and
sex, and the necessity of subor
dinating the more luxurious
human emotions, like tender
ness and pity, to the practical
considerations of feeding a fam
ily has given rise to two im
mutable laws; Those who steal
food must be punished in a way
that prevents any further threat
to the supply, and when a man
or woman grows too old to con
tribute to the family, the eldest
son must carry him or her on his
back to "Narayama" — to the
mountain, to die alone.
Imamura, who adapted the
screenplay from a novel by Shi
chiro Fukazawa, offers us brief
glimpses of the lives of several
of the villagers — brusque in
terludes, some of them
humorous in the rough, heavy
style of folk fables, that under
score the cruelty and violence of
their existence. But he focuses
on a single family. Orin is 69
and lives with her two sons, Tat
suhei, a widower with two sons
of his own, and Risuke, a
shaggy, filthy man nicknamed
"Stinker" bv his neighbors and

denied the sexual attentions of
the women in the village. The
traveling salt dealer, who
operates a matchmaking busi
ness as a sideline, "sells" Tat
suhei a strong young woman,
Tama, and during the same per
iod his son Kesa impregnates a
local girl, Matsu, who comes to
live with them. The addition of

new mouths to feed, and the
promise of more to come, worry
Orin as winter approaches, and
since Tama appears clearly ca
pable of taking over her
household du'ies, she decides to
go to Narayama — first break
ing her front teeth off to show
that her body has begun to
deterioriate and she has thus

become a burden to her family.
For Orin, this painful action is a
matter of honor: It is a disgrace
to be so healthy at such an ad
vanced age, because longevity
imperils the survival of the fam
ily — honor being always bound
up with the urgency of providing
the best possible chance for the
family to continue. And Orin

has never forgotten the dis
honor that visited her clan when
her husband, Rihei, chose to run
away rather than deliver his
mother to Narayama.
For a long while the movie,
which won the Prix d'Or at
Cannes last year, is tough going.
You can admire Imamura's
craftsmanship and his unswerv
ing commitment to his subject,
you can appreciate his handling
of visual contrasts and parallels,
you can even admit that his vi
sion has its own austere beauty
(and that the photographer,
Masao Tochizawa, has captured
it) — but resist the finality of
that vision, its purity that omits
the possibility of rebellion or
hope or humanistic progress.
But then Ameya, Matsu's fa
ther, is discovered to be a thief,
and he and his whole family —
including Matsu, whom Orin
sends back to her family to take
her share in the punishment —
are hurled into a ravine and
buried alive. And in the after
math of that horrendous scene,
when the mounded earth has
stopped up their cries and the
neighbors continue to heap
more earth on top, burying the
crime and all memory of it, the
combination of the strange
silence and the distance of Im
amura's camera from the toiling
villagers creates, for the first
time, a sense of authentic
tragedy. Imamura, we begin to
learn, is interested in the very
emotions that the laws of sur
vival in this brutal society work
to suppress — in the filial devo
tion that caused Rihei to balk at
carrying his mother to her
death, and that Orin fears her
