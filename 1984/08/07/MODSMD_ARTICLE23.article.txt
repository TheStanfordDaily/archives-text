## 'Narayama' shows rigidity, private hell 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Set in northern Japan a cen
tury ago, Shohei Imamura's The
Ballad of Narayama presents a
harsh vision of life on the edge
of poverty, and pursues it
relentlessly — almost merci
lessly. For those who make their
home in a village on the slope of
Mount Shinshy, farming and
fishing provide the only
livelihood, but the land is stub
born and yields crops reluc
tantly, and there is always some
doubt about surviving the win
ter. So the society is an elemen
tal one, centered on food and
sex, and the necessity of subor
dinating the more luxurious
human emotions, like tender
ness and pity, to the practical
considerations of feeding a fam
ily has given rise to two im
mutable laws; Those who steal
food must be punished in a way
that prevents any further threat
to the supply, and when a man
or woman grows too old to con
tribute to the family, the eldest
son must carry him or her on his
back to "Narayama" — to the
mountain, to die alone.
Imamura, who adapted the
screenplay from a novel by Shi
chiro Fukazawa, offers us brief
glimpses of the lives of several
of the villagers — brusque in
terludes, some of them
humorous in the rough, heavy
style of folk fables, that under
score the cruelty and violence of
their existence. But he focuses
on a single family. Orin is 69
and lives with her two sons, Tat
suhei, a widower with two sons
of his own, and Risuke, a
shaggy, filthy man nicknamed
"Stinker" bv his neighbors and

denied the sexual attentions of
the women in the village. The
traveling salt dealer, who
operates a matchmaking busi
ness as a sideline, "sells" Tat
suhei a strong young woman,
Tama, and during the same per
iod his son Kesa impregnates a
local girl, Matsu, who comes to
live with them. The addition of

new mouths to feed, and the
promise of more to come, worry
Orin as winter approaches, and
since Tama appears clearly ca
pable of taking over her
household du'ies, she decides to
go to Narayama — first break
ing her front teeth off to show
that her body has begun to
deterioriate and she has thus

become a burden to her family.
For Orin, this painful action is a
matter of honor: It is a disgrace
to be so healthy at such an ad
vanced age, because longevity
imperils the survival of the fam
ily — honor being always bound
up with the urgency of providing
the best possible chance for the
family to continue. And Orin

has never forgotten the dis
honor that visited her clan when
her husband, Rihei, chose to run
away rather than deliver his
mother to Narayama.
For a long while the movie,
which won the Prix d'Or at
Cannes last year, is tough going.
You can admire Imamura's
craftsmanship and his unswerv
ing commitment to his subject,
you can appreciate his handling
of visual contrasts and parallels,
you can even admit that his vi
sion has its own austere beauty
(and that the photographer,
Masao Tochizawa, has captured
it) — but resist the finality of
that vision, its purity that omits
the possibility of rebellion or
hope or humanistic progress.
But then Ameya, Matsu's fa
ther, is discovered to be a thief,
and he and his whole family —
including Matsu, whom Orin
sends back to her family to take
her share in the punishment —
are hurled into a ravine and
buried alive. And in the after
math of that horrendous scene,
when the mounded earth has
stopped up their cries and the
neighbors continue to heap
more earth on top, burying the
crime and all memory of it, the
combination of the strange
silence and the distance of Im
amura's camera from the toiling
villagers creates, for the first
time, a sense of authentic
tragedy. Imamura, we begin to
learn, is interested in the very
emotions that the laws of sur
vival in this brutal society work
to suppress — in the filial devo
tion that caused Rihei to balk at
carrying his mother to her
death, and that Orin fears her

son has inherited (she calls it
"cowardice'' and claims —
though we are never convinced
of it — that when it surfaced in
her husband, she ceased to love
him), in Tatsuhei's fury at his
younger son's ingratitude when
the boy makes his grandmother
the subject of a taunting song, in
Kesa's pleas to his neighbors at
the edge of the ravine to spare
Matsu the punishment doled out
to her family.
Imamura really is a terrific
director. Throughout the film he
reminds us that, when their lives
are stripped down to the essen
tials, men and women rely on
their animal instincts — while
Kesa and Matsu wrestle in the
dirt, snakes couple nearby,
leaping and twitching. Later we
see a snake preying on a mouse,
and still later the snake's dis
carded skin: The cycle contin
ues, and Orin and her family are
part of it, trapped in it. Yet
there is something else present
in the movie — a supernatural
element that brings the earthy
folk fable in its second hour al
most, at several moments, into
the realm of Hans Christian An
dersen, like parts of Kurosawa's
Dodes 'Ka-Den and Dersu
Uzala. Neighbors inform Orin
that they have seen Rihei wan
dering in the northern forest,
and the brief sequence that fol

lows, shot partly in slow motion
with the color bled out, has the
logic of a dream, so that after
ward you're not sure exactly
what you saw. When Orin
arrives on the spot where Rihei
is supposed to have appeared,
she finds Tatsuhei already
there; ashamed of his father's
"cowardice," he says, he shot
him in that very clearing years
ago, and so it must be his spirit
that has returned. What we see
is a tree possessed with an
other-worldly shudder; when
Tatsuhei raises his gun and
shoots into the tree, it seems to
implode. Tatsuhei tries to kill
his father once more so that he
can be at peace and forget what
happened years earlier — just as
the villagers have to bury
Ameya and his family, to lose
the reminder that there are
other battles besides the physi
cal ones that make up their day
to-day lives. If they did not, they
would have to fly in the face of
the life cycle — they would try
to hold onto their old skins. And
so Kesa takes a new lover as
soon as Matsu is gone, and Tat
suhei shoots at his father's
ghost.
What is remarkable about
The Ballad of Narayama is how
comprehensive it is — that Im
amura has made this life both
severe and beautiful, and has

suggested the psychological and
spiritual struggles beneath the
war against starvation and cold.

What is remarkable about '\arayama' is
how comprehensive it is - that Imamura
has made this life both severe and beautiful,
and has suggested the psychological and
spiritual struggle beneath the war against
starvation and coldness. Only late in the
film do we understand how complex the
society is - that Narayama is more than just
a convenient means of disposing of the
aged. Narayama finally is not only a place
of death but everyone's private hell.

disposing of the aged. When
Orin elects to go there, she sum
mons the elders of the village to
receive instructions on the rules
for making her journey, for this
death trip has the form of a

rituai It is a hard task to go to
Narayama/' they tell Tatsuhei
— not Orin, who has come to
terms with her fate, but Tat
suhei, for whom the journey
becomes a rite of passage.

Narayama, finally, is not only a
place of death, but everyone's
private hell — the forest where
Tatsuhei killed his father, the
ravine where Matsu was taken
from Kesa. (When the village
goes after Ameya, the cry that

calls them out is "Narayama's
punishment!") Orin meets her
death on the mountain, but Tat
suhei, who says as they climb, "I
killed father no- T '~- killing
mother, must live past
Narayama. So though hns
the central role in this drama
(and Sukimoto Sakomo* gives
a si, .1. .rs c), in a
sense the pivotal character is
Tatsuhei.
What awaits us a f summit
of the mountain is the most hor
rific sight in the film — the ac
cumulated bones of hundreds of
men and woinv... *vho have
ended their days in this place,
with vultures hovering over
head, eager for their next meal.
Imamura spares us nothing —
but it is because of his relent
lessness that he is able to go as
far as he does, to climax his film
with an image not much less
powerful than the apocalyptic
final shot of Bergman's Shame
(the war survivors pushing their
rowboat away from the corpse
clogged shallows). And the
harshness of all we have seen
makes possible the surge of
emotion we feel when, at last,
mother and son embrace. Two
lone figures, their arms around
each other, amid an expanse of
bones — Imamura might have
intended this moment as an act
of homage to Samuel Beckett.

her husband, Rihei, chose to run
away rather than deliver his
mother to Narayama.
For a long while the movie,
which won the Prix d'Or at
Cannes last year, is tough going.
You can admire Imamura's
craftsmanship and his unswerv
ing commitment to his subject,
you can appreciate his handling
of visual contrasts and parallels,
you can even admit that his vi
sion has its own austere beauty
(and that the photographer,
Masao Tochizawa, has captured
it) — but resist the finality of
that vision, its purity that omits
the possibility of rebellion or
hope or humanistic progress.
But then Ameya, Matsu's fa
ther, is discovered to be a thief,
and he and his whole family —
including Matsu, whom Orin
sends back to her family to take
her share in the punishment —
are hurled into a ravine and
buried alive. And in the after
math of that horrendous scene,
when the mounded earth has
stopped up their cries and the
neighbors continue to heap
more earth on top, burying the
crime and all memory of it, the
combination of the strange
silence and the distance of Im
amura's camera from the toiling
villagers creates, for the first
time, a sense of authentic
tragedy. Imamura, we begin to
learn, is interested in the very
emotions that the laws of sur
vival in this brutal society work
to suppress — in the filial devo
tion that caused Rihei to balk at
carrying his mother to her
death, and that Orin fears her

son has inherited (she calls it
"cowardice'' and claims —
though we are never convinced
of it — that when it surfaced in
her husband, she ceased to love
him), in Tatsuhei's fury at his
younger son's ingratitude when
the boy makes his grandmother
the subject of a taunting song, in
Kesa's pleas to his neighbors at
the edge of the ravine to spare
Matsu the punishment doled out
to her family.
Imamura really is a terrific
director. Throughout the film he
reminds us that, when their lives
are stripped down to the essen
tials, men and women rely on
their animal instincts — while
Kesa and Matsu wrestle in the
dirt, snakes couple nearby,
leaping and twitching. Later we
see a snake preying on a mouse,
and still later the snake's dis
carded skin: The cycle contin
ues, and Orin and her family are
part of it, trapped in it. Yet
there is something else present
in the movie — a supernatural
element that brings the earthy
folk fable in its second hour al
most, at several moments, into
the realm of Hans Christian An
dersen, like parts of Kurosawa's
Dodes 'Ka-Den and Dersu
Uzala. Neighbors inform Orin
that they have seen Rihei wan
dering in the northern forest,
and the brief sequence that fol

lows, shot partly in slow motion
with the color bled out, has the
logic of a dream, so that after
ward you're not sure exactly
what you saw. When Orin
arrives on the spot where Rihei
is supposed to have appeared,
she finds Tatsuhei already
there; ashamed of his father's
"cowardice," he says, he shot
him in that very clearing years
ago, and so it must be his spirit
that has returned. What we see
is a tree possessed with an
other-worldly shudder; when
Tatsuhei raises his gun and
shoots into the tree, it seems to
implode. Tatsuhei tries to kill
his father once more so that he
can be at peace and forget what
happened years earlier — just as
the villagers have to bury
Ameya and his family, to lose
the reminder that there are
other battles besides the physi
cal ones that make up their day
to-day lives. If they did not, they
would have to fly in the face of
the life cycle — they would try
to hold onto their old skins. And
so Kesa takes a new lover as
soon as Matsu is gone, and Tat
suhei shoots at his father's
ghost.

What is remarkable about '\arayama' is
how comprehensive it is - that Imamura
has made this life both severe and beautiful,
and has suggested the psychological and
spiritual struggle beneath the war against
starvation and coldness. Only late in the
film do we understand how complex the
society is - that Narayama is more than just
a convenient means of disposing of the
aged. Narayama finally is not only a place
of death but everyone's private hell.

than just a convenient means of
disposing of the aged. When
Orin elects to go there, she sum

receive instructions on the rules
for making her journey, for this
death trip has the form of a

rituai It is a hard task to go to
Narayama/' they tell Tatsuhei
— not Orin, who has come to
terms with her fate, but Tat
suhei, for whom the journey
becomes a rite of passage.

Narayama, finally, is not only a
place of death, but everyone's
private hell — the forest where
Tatsuhei killed his father, the
ravine where Matsu was taken
from Kesa. (When the village
goes after Ameya, the cry that

calls them out is "Narayama's
punishment!") Orin meets her
death on the mountain, but Tat
suhei, who says as they climb, "I
killed father no- T '~- killing
mother, must live past
Narayama. So though hns
the central role in this drama
(and Sukimoto Sakomo* gives
a si, .1. .rs c), in a
sense the pivotal character is
Tatsuhei.
What awaits us a f summit
of the mountain is the most hor
rific sight in the film — the ac
cumulated bones of hundreds of
men and woinv... *vho have
ended their days in this place,
with vultures hovering over
head, eager for their next meal.
Imamura spares us nothing —
but it is because of his relent
lessness that he is able to go as
far as he does, to climax his film
with an image not much less
powerful than the apocalyptic
final shot of Bergman's Shame
(the war survivors pushing their
rowboat away from the corpse
clogged shallows). And the
harshness of all we have seen
makes possible the surge of
emotion we feel when, at last,
mother and son embrace. Two
lone figures, their arms around
each other, amid an expanse of
bones — Imamura might have
intended this moment as an act
of homage to Samuel Beckett.
Set in northern Japan a cen
tury ago, Shohei Imamura's The
Ballad of Narayama presents a
harsh vision of life on the edge
of poverty, and pursues it
relentlessly — almost merci
lessly. For those who make their
home in a village on the slope of
Mount Shinshy, farming and
fishing provide the only
livelihood, but the land is stub
born and yields crops reluc
tantly, and there is always some
doubt about surviving the win
ter. So the society is an elemen
tal one, centered on food and
sex, and the necessity of subor
dinating the more luxurious
human emotions, like tender
ness and pity, to the practical
considerations of feeding a fam
ily has given rise to two im
mutable laws; Those who steal
food must be punished in a way
that prevents any further threat
to the supply, and when a man
or woman grows too old to con
tribute to the family, the eldest
son must carry him or her on his
back to "Narayama" — to the
mountain, to die alone.
Imamura, who adapted the
screenplay from a novel by Shi
chiro Fukazawa, offers us brief
glimpses of the lives of several
of the villagers — brusque in
terludes, some of them
humorous in the rough, heavy
style of folk fables, that under
score the cruelty and violence of
their existence. But he focuses
on a single family. Orin is 69
and lives with her two sons, Tat
suhei, a widower with two sons
of his own, and Risuke, a
shaggy, filthy man nicknamed
"Stinker" bv his neighbors and

denied the sexual attentions of
the women in the village. The
traveling salt dealer, who
operates a matchmaking busi
ness as a sideline, "sells" Tat
suhei a strong young woman,
Tama, and during the same per
iod his son Kesa impregnates a
local girl, Matsu, who comes to
live with them. The addition of

new mouths to feed, and the
promise of more to come, worry
Orin as winter approaches, and
since Tama appears clearly ca
pable of taking over her
household du'ies, she decides to
go to Narayama — first break
ing her front teeth off to show
that her body has begun to
deterioriate and she has thus

become a burden to her family.
For Orin, this painful action is a
matter of honor: It is a disgrace
to be so healthy at such an ad
vanced age, because longevity
imperils the survival of the fam
ily — honor being always bound
up with the urgency of providing
the best possible chance for the
family to continue. And Orin

has never forgotten the dis
honor that visited her clan when
her husband, Rihei, chose to run
away rather than deliver his
mother to Narayama.
For a long while the movie,

Cannes last year, is tough going.

Dodes 'Ka-Den and Dersu
Uzala. Neighbors inform Orin
that they have seen Rihei wan
dering in the northern forest,
and the brief sequence that fol

lows, shot partly in slow motion
with the color bled out, has the
logic of a dream, so that after
ward you're not sure exactly
what you saw. When Orin
arrives on the spot where Rihei
is supposed to have appeared,
she finds Tatsuhei already
there; ashamed of his father's
"cowardice," he says, he shot
him in that very clearing years
ago, and so it must be his spirit
that has returned. What we see
is a tree possessed with an
other-worldly shudder; when
Tatsuhei raises his gun and
shoots into the tree, it seems to
implode. Tatsuhei tries to kill
his father once more so that he
can be at peace and forget what
happened years earlier — just as
the villagers have to bury
Ameya and his family, to lose
the reminder that there are
other battles besides the physi
cal ones that make up their day
to-day lives. If they did not, they
would have to fly in the face of
the life cycle — they would try
to hold onto their old skins. And
so Kesa takes a new lover as
soon as Matsu is gone, and Tat
suhei shoots at his father's
ghost.

What is remarkable about '\arayama' is
how comprehensive it is - that Imamura
has made this life both severe and beautiful,
and has suggested the psychological and
spiritual struggle beneath the war against
starvation and coldness. Only late in the
film do we understand how complex the
society is - that Narayama is more than just
a convenient means of disposing of the
aged. Narayama finally is not only a place
of death but everyone's private hell.

Narayama, finally, is not only a
place of death, but everyone's
private hell — the forest where
Tatsuhei killed his father, the
ravine where Matsu was taken
from Kesa. (When the village
goes after Ameya, the cry that

calls them out is "Narayama's
punishment!") Orin meets her

Imamura spares us nothing —
but it is because of his relent
lessness that he is able to go as
far as he does, to climax his film
with an image not much less
powerful than the apocalyptic
final shot of Bergman's Shame
(the war survivors pushing their
rowboat away from the corpse
clogged shallows). And the
harshness of all we have seen
makes possible the surge of
emotion we feel when, at last,
mother and son embrace. Two
lone figures, their arms around
each other, amid an expanse of
bones — Imamura might have
intended this moment as an act
of homage to Samuel Beckett.
