# Brazil, Italy to meet in semifinal here
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
The semifinal match between
Italy and Brazil will pit two
teams with extremely stingy
defenses and economical offen
ses, but should also provide the
usual contrast between
European and South American
soccer.
Italy reached the quarter
finals by winning Group D with
a 2-1-0 record. The Italians
opened with a 1-0 victory over
Egypt back on July 29. There
were tempers that flared in that
one, as one Italian — Sebas

tiano Nela — and three Egyp
tians received red cards, and
there were a total of eight yel
low cards. Aldo Serena scored
the only goal of that game for
Italy at the 63:03 mark of the
second half.
Italy repeated the perfor
mance with a 1-0 win over the
United States two days later
before a crowd of 63,624 at the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena. This
time it was Pietro Fanna who
scored the lone Italian goal,
scoring in the 54th minute.
Italy had clinched a quarter
final berth bv winning those first

two games, and so the Italians
went into their final first round
game against Costa Rica
knowing they could afford to
lose. They lost, by the now
familiar score of 1 -0, as Evaristo
Coronado of Costa Rica tallied
the game's lone goal.
Italy entered Sunday's quar
terfinal match with Chile having
scored only two goals. Chile had
also scored only two goals. The
result was predictable — a 0-0
tie through regulation that
Beniamino Vighola managed to
break on a penalty kick in the
first overtime.
Italy is the lowest-scoring
team in the semifinals, having
scored only three goals in four
games, but is also the stingiest,
having given up just one.
Brazil has scored 1 1 goals,
second to Yugoslavia's 12, but
that is deceiving because four
came on penalty kicks after the
Brazilians had played Canada to
a 1-1 tie through two overtimes
before winning, 5-3. Brazil has
given up just four goals, and two
of those were penalty kicks.
Brazil opened with a 3-1 win
over Saudi Arabia July 30.
Dunga, Silvinho and Gilmar all
scored in the opening win.
The Brazilians then followed
by winning the best first-round
game played at Stanford,
beating West Germany, 1-0.
The game was well-played
throughout, and the 75,239 in
attendence seemed to enjoy it.
Gilmar broke what looked to be
a scoreless tie by drilling a free
kick from 20 yards out into the
right corner of the net and gave
Brazil the win.
Brazil kept its record perfect

by shutting out Morocco last
Friday in Pasadena, 2-0. Kito
and Dunga scored in that one.
The Brazilians did get a scare
in the quarterfinals, as Canada
clung to a 1-1 through 120
minutes before the Brazilians
fired home four penalty kicks
for the 5-3 win.
The semifinal match should
be another tight-played, low
scoring game. Italy's defense is
extremely tough, while its of
fense is very deliberate. Brazil

tends to employ a more wide
open offense, but will be hard
pressed to get through the Ital
ian lines. Their own defense is
nearly as stingy.
If you want to guess a score,
1-0 seems a good bet. Which
ever team scores first will likely
retreat into its own zone and
make a second goal that much
more difficult. But that first goal
won t be easy, either. Overtime
and penalty kicks are certainly
not to be ruled out.
