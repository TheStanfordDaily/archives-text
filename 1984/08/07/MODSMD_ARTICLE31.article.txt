# Overtime goals determine quarterfinal games
## Brazil downs Canada on kicks 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
You really had to wonder how bad of a
rout it would be. Brazil, a recognized
world soccer power, was facing Canada
in a quarterfinal match yesterday at
Stanford Stadium.
Think of sports in Brazil. Soccer,
right? Pele, World Cup championship
teams, great individual players.
Think of sports in Canada. Hockey,
Wayne Gretzky, the Montreal
Canadiens, the Maple Leaf Gardens,
CBC Hockey Night in Canada, with
maybe the Toronto Blue Jays and foot
ball with three downs, 12 players and a
110-yard field thrown in.
So what do you get when you put a
team of Brazilians with one-word, Pele
like nicknames like Gilmar, Dunga,
Tonho and Silvinho against a team of
Canadians from established soccer
powers like the Toronto Blizzard, the
Vancouver Whitecaps and the Golden
Bay Earthquakes. A blowout, right?
Wrong. You get the closest game im
aginable, a contest that went right down
through two overtimes to the penalty
kick stage.
Yes, Brazil won it 5-3, outscoring
Canada 4-2 on the penalty kicks after
120 minutes of dead-even soccer. But

the Brazilians were lucky to escape, and
Coach Jair Picerni admitted, "The
players felt a little insecure for a while."
The fact is that Canada scored first,
and then came right back to score again.
Or so it appeared, but the linesman
called the play offsides, the Brazilians
tied it 14 minutes later, and no one else
could put the ball in the net until the
penalty kicks.
Under normal circumstances it would
have gone down as a 1-1 tie. Since it was
a quarterfinal match, however, a winner
to advance to tomorrow night's semifinal
match against Italy was needed. The
rules call for two 15-minute overtimes to
be played, without sudden-death,
though.
So, having played 90 minutes without
a verdict, the teams took a five-minute
break and battled for another 30
minutes. No score.
The rules then call for the game to be
decided by penalty kicks. "Penalty kicks
are 10116068," Canadian Coach Tony
Waiters said after the game. "You may
as well flip a coin when it gets to that
point."
In fact, that's how it used to be done,
but now a set of five penalty kicks by
each team are taken. Whoever
scores the most, wins.
It's a goalkeeper's nightmare.
The ball is put 12 yards from the
goal, and a player blasts away
with only the keeper between
him and the goal. "You have to
have luck as well as skill,"
Brazilian keeper Gilmar Rinaldi
said. "It's kind of a guessing
game."
The keeper has to decide
before the kick which way to
move if he is to have any chance
of stopping the shot. If he's cor
rect, he may stand a chance. If
he's wrong, the ball is behind
him.
Canada's Bruce Wilson
started off by putting his shot
into the lower left corner of the
net as Rinaldi dove the wrong
way, but Gilmar came back for
Brazil by placing his effort just
under the crossbar as Canadian
goalkeeper Tino Lettieri dove
low.
Then Rinaldi guessed right.
Dale Mitchell sent his shot
toward the lower left corner, but
Rinaldi was there to make the
stop. Kita then knocked one

over Lettieri*s outstretched
body to give Brazil a 2-1 lead.
Lan Bridge of Canada then
sent a shot to the left side, but
Rinaldi guessed correctly again
and gave Ademir Kaeser the
opportunity to make it 3-1.
Brazil would win it with either
a Canadian miss or a Brazilian
goal. Canada's Gerry Gray kept
his team's hopes alive as Rinaldi
guessed wrong and Gray's shot
to the left side closed it to 3-2.
Andre Luiz Ferreira ended
those hopes, though, by knock
ing a shot into the upper right
corner to win the shootout, 4-2,
and the game 5-3.
It was a disappointing ending
for a Canadian team that had al
most pulled off the upset of the
tournament. The first half had
been scoreless, but Mitchell
broke the ice with his third goal
of the Olympics at 57:55.
An attempt by Brazil to clear
the area went awry, and
Canada's Mike Sweeney gained
control on the left side. He sent
a pass to Mitchell, whose initial
shot from 10 yards out was
barely deflected by Rinaldi, but
Mitchell got his own rebound
ana practically walked into the
net in scoring.
Two minutes later it appeared
that Canada had made it 2-0.

Mitchell took a free kick after a
foul was called just 20 yards
from the goal. Mitchell just hit
the right post with the kick, hut
the rebound came right out to
Gray, who drilled it home to
give Canada a two-goal lead.
The linesman, however, ruled
that two Canadiah players had
been offside, the goal was dis
allowed, and Brazil had a
second chance.
Brazil capitalized at 72:10,
when Gilmar gained control of a
loose ball on the right side and
put it past Lettieri to tie things
at 1-1.
That's the way it stood for 18
more minutes of regulation and
two overtimes. Brazil's Kaeser,
Silvinho and Kita all had good
chances in the first extra stanza,
but Lettieri was brilliant in
making the stops.
Mitchell had the best chance
to score in overtime when he
took another free kick from 20
yards out at the 100-minute
mark, but he hit the crossbar
with it.
And so it came down to which
team could shoot penalty kicks
better. As a result, Brazil faces
Italy here in a semifinal match,
while the Canadians go home
with stories about what might
have been.
