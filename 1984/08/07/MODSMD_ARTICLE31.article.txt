# Overtime goals determine quarterfinal games
## Brazil downs Canada on kicks 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
You really had to wonder how bad of a
rout it would be. Brazil, a recognized
world soccer power, was facing Canada
in a quarterfinal match yesterday at
Stanford Stadium.
Think of sports in Brazil. Soccer,
right? Pele, World Cup championship
teams, great individual players.
Think of sports in Canada. Hockey,
Wayne Gretzky, the Montreal
Canadiens, the Maple Leaf Gardens,
CBC Hockey Night in Canada, with
maybe the Toronto Blue Jays and foot
ball with three downs, 12 players and a
110-yard field thrown in.
So what do you get when you put a
team of Brazilians with one-word, Pele
like nicknames like Gilmar, Dunga,
Tonho and Silvinho against a team of
Canadians from established soccer
powers like the Toronto Blizzard, the
Vancouver Whitecaps and the Golden
Bay Earthquakes. A blowout, right?
Wrong. You get the closest game im
aginable, a contest that went right down
through two overtimes to the penalty
kick stage.
Yes, Brazil won it 5-3, outscoring
Canada 4-2 on the penalty kicks after
120 minutes of dead-even soccer. But

the Brazilians were lucky to escape, and
Coach Jair Picerni admitted, "The
players felt a little insecure for a while."
The fact is that Canada scored first,
and then came right back to score again.
Or so it appeared, but the linesman
called the play offsides, the Brazilians
tied it 14 minutes later, and no one else
could put the ball in the net until the
penalty kicks.
Under normal circumstances it would
have gone down as a 1-1 tie. Since it was
a quarterfinal match, however, a winner
to advance to tomorrow night's semifinal
match against Italy was needed. The
rules call for two 15-minute overtimes to
be played, without sudden-death,
though.
So, having played 90 minutes without
a verdict, the teams took a five-minute
break and battled for another 30
minutes. No score.
The rules then call for the game to be
decided by penalty kicks. "Penalty kicks
are 10116068," Canadian Coach Tony
Waiters said after the game. "You may
as well flip a coin when it gets to that
point."
In fact, that's how it used to be done,
but now a set of five penalty kicks by
