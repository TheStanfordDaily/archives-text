# Italians score once, beat Chile
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
It you like tough, physical, intimidat
ing soccer with lots of yellow caution
cards and very little offense, you prob
ably loved Italy's 1-0 overtime win over
Chile in Sunday afternoon's quarterfinal
match.
If you don't like that kind of game, you
could have worked on your tan. 67,039
fans drifted into Stanford Stadium on a
perfect August afternoon to see which of
the two teams would advance into to
morrow's semifinal against Brazil.
They saw enough contact to make Jack
Elway proud. There were four yellow
cards given out to each team and a total
of 86 fouls. That's right, 86 fouls. If you
want something to compare, there were
only 21 in the United States-Egypt game
last Thursday.
It seemed fitting, then, that the game
was decided on a penalty kick. At the
96:50 mark, in the first overtime, Chile's
Daniel Ahumda fouled Italy's Daniele
Massaro. So what else is new. It seems,
however, that Massaro was in the penalty
area at the time.
In this situation, the ball is put 12
yards from the goal and an Italian player
gets one shot, one-on-one with the
goalkeeper. The Italians picked

Beniamino Vighola to take the shot, and
he came through.
Vighola put his original shot off the
hand of Chilean keeper Eduardo Four
nier and into the net, hut the referee
ruled that an Italian player had moved
into the penalty area before the shot,
which caused the goal to be disallowed
and forced Vighola to rekick.
He did so, and again put it in, hitting
the bottom of the crossbar and watching
the shot bounce down over the goal line.
Chile had one final chance to score in
the second overtime in the 117 th minute,
but Sergio Marchant put his shot from 15
yards over the goal following a blocked
free kick.
The two teams had come into the
game with little scoring — both had
scored two goals in their first three
games — and a legacy of physical play —
Italy had three players suspended in their
first game against Egypt.
In fact, it appears that two more
Italians will be suspended for tomorrow's
game. Riccardo Ferri and Vighola both
picked up their second yellow cards of
the tournament. Because of this, both
will be suspended for one game, accor
ding to the rules of the Federation Inter
nationale de Football Association, the
sport's governing body.
