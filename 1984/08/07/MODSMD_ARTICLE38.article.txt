# Saudis' fan support not enough against FRG
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
The final first-round game of
Olympic soccer competition at
Stanford proved to be the big
gest mismatch of the tourna
ment, as West Germany blasted
Saudi Arabia, 6-0.
The Saudis had excellent
crowd support, but that was
about all you could say for a
team that finished the Olympics
with an 0-3 record and one goal
scored against 10 given up.
There were at least 1000
Saudi fans among the 26,242 in
attendance, and they made their
presence felt. One individual
brought a bullhorn into the
stadium and led his countrymen
in continual chanting through
out the contest. Some waved
green Saudi flags, while others
held aloft pictures of their team
or of their king.
The Saudis were just happy to
be here. Their government has
taken out ads in national
newspapers and magazines as
well as one-minute spots on
ABC during the Games to tell
America that their team is one
of only 16 from around the
world to make the Olympic

tournament.
But making the Olympics and
doing well in them are often two
entirely different things. The
West Germans were quick to
drive this point home. Christian
Schreier scored just over eight
minutes into the game to begin
the onslaught, and the rout was
on.
Rudolf Bommer, Uwe Rahn
and Frank Mill all added first
half goals — Rahn scoring just
1:40 after Bommer — to make
the halftime score 4-0. Schreier
and Bommer scored their
second goals in the final 45
minutes to drive the point
home.
With the win, the West Ger
mans advanced into yesterday's
quarterfinal match, which they
lost to Yugoslavia 5-2 at the
Rose Bowl. West Germany
finished with a 2-2 record and
captured second place in Group
C, behind Brazil.
As for the Saudis, the loss
didn't seem to bother them
much. Like the ads say, "Twelve
years ago, he didn't have a patch
of grass to play on." They've
come a long way to make the
Olympics,

Despite vocal fan support and occasional open breaks like this, Saudi Arabia was overwhelmed
by West Germany, 6-0.
