Los Angeles Coliseum —
At a Stanford football game,
a seat in the eighth row on
the 30-yard line would be
considered poor, if not
downright crummy.

But at the L.A. Coliseum,
which has been turned into
the glorious outdoor Olym
pic arena, those seats
couldn't be better.
The finish line for the run
ning events is marked at the
20-yard line. The long, thin
pit of sand where the long
jump competitors land is
right there.
Even the expression on
Carl Lewis' face could be
seen after he fouled by step

ping over the line on his
second jump last night and
had to wait until other con
testants had their turns.
But Lewis Viad a\ieady
jumped a foot farther than
any of his competitors,
leaping 28 feet, 1/4 inch on
his first attempt. The mark
held up and gave Lewis his
second gold medal of the
Games, putting him halfway
to his goal of duplicating
Jesse Owens' four golds at
the 1936 Olympics.
Lewis and fellow gold
medalists Joaquim Cruz of
Brazil (800 meters) and
Americans Valerie Brisco-
Hooks (women's 400) and
Roger Kingdom (110-meter
hurdles) ran impressive races
yesterday.
In a spontaneous show of
emotion, Brisco-Hooks ran
to her boyfriend and they lay
on the ground embracing
after her Olympic-record
performance.
Sitting behind me was a
charming three or four-year
old black girl, Ruth Musyok,
who was waiting patiently for

her father, Michael, a Kenyan
runner in the 10,000 meters.
She was quite excited to tell me
that her father takes her on
walks to talk and buy Milky
Way bars.
Another child — a boy of five
or six years — complained that
his father's television should
have been brought along.
Spectators commented on the
fact that the sun was still strong
and hot at five p.m. and were
grateful for an occasional cool

breeze.
A Beverly Hills woman who
has attended the Olympics al
most every day said the Games
have all been exciting, but the
spectacular opening ceremonies
remain her favorite part.
It was stirring to see how
everyone in the stadium, includ
ing the athletes and officials,
stopped whatever they were
doing and stood at attention
whenever a national anthem
was played and medals were
presented.
Six more days of Olympic
competition remain and they
will bring more excitement,
more surprises and more thrills.
