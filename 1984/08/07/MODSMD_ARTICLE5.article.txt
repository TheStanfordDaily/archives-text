# Stanford to resume fluoridation of water
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
After being urged by University President Donald
Kennedy to reinstate fluoridation as soon as possible,
Utility Systems has replaced the chemical in Stanford's
water this spring and summer.
According to Cheryl Jensen, manager of civil engi
neering services here, Escondido's treatment system
was rebuilt using parts from the other two fluoridation
plants on campus and reinstated immediately in mid-
March when Kennedy announced he was embarrassed
by the unannounced lack of fluoridation in the system
in February.
The residential system was replaced with new
fluoride saturation equipment and went into operation
on July 1. The central campus system will be
refluoridated immediately after the Olympics are
finished at Stanford Stadium.
The lack of fluoride, a common additive in drinking
water which is necessary for healthy teeth, was brought
out in a housing services memo in February when a
nurse at Cowell Student Health Center discovered that
the ingredient was missing and could not find out why.
According to Jensen, old dissolving tank systems of
inserting fluoride in the water had been eaten up by the
chemical and the department had delayed replacing

them until it could be determined whether the replace
ment justified its cost.
Dissolving systems use powdered fluoride which eats
at pipes and tanks and can wear out parts within a year
of its installation.
Palo Alto uses such a system, and apparently has
constant maintenance problems with it. Stanford
abandoned its system in the winter of 1983.
When newspaper reports revealed the lack of
fluoridation, Kennedy immediately told Utility Systems
to put the system back into operation.
Reluctant to go back to the old problem-bound sys
tem. the Water Department discovered that a new
saturation system had been put on the market.
"We were lucky the technology was there," said Jen
sen. "It was a case of good timing."
According to Jensen, her department made do with
parts from all three systems to get Escondido running,
then purchased a saturation system for the three pro
cessing areas. The residential system, which includes
the faculty ghetto, went into operation in early July and
the Escondido system was replaced with the saturation
method this spring.
In order not to interrupt Olympic operations at Stan
ford Stadium, the third and last svstem, which includes

the central campus and dormitories, will be installed
immediately after the semi-final match tomorrow.
"Kennedy had decided we should get it up as soon as
possible," said Jensen. "We were lucky there was a sys
tem on the market."
"We just paid for it out of the water budget. It's
being spread out over a few years."
It took workers from all parts of the Water Depart
ment to end the delay and install the new saturators.
Compared to the old acid system, the new liquid system
is expected to be trouble-free. The same
mistake is unlikely to happen again.
Interestingly, while Palo Alto continues to
battle the high costs of inserting a milligram
per liter of fluoride into the water by powder
dissolving tanks, San Jose switched to the liq
uid saturations system long ago. Yet, in spite of
the advantages, Palo Alto water officials con
tinue to recommend the powder system. Ap
parently, their large-scale operation finds it

less costly than Stanford's mini-operation.
Jensen also said the University laboratories'
acid dumping has come to a halt, although it
never posed any danger to water systems here.
A lab technician reported the dumping a
month ago and a moratorium on acid use
closed the lab for two days. The lab is now
back to normal operation using an acid pick-up
system operated by the Health and Safety De
partment.
Jensen said the new system may pose more
threats than the old at McCullough because
acid must now be handled by hand, with the
threat of burning spills and dangerous non
dilution of powerful acids.
