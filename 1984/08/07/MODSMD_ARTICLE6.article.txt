## FAA announces plans to avoid traffic delays 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), trying
to blunt criticism that it isn't doing
enough to reduce airway congestion and
flight delays, announced plans yesterday
for new computer equipment and said it
is reviewing whether more controllers
might he needed to direct traffic.
But FAA Administrator Donald En
gen cautioned that flight delays are not
expected to ease soon in parts of the
country such as the Northeast where the
airways are heavily traveled.
He gave no indication that the FAA
had made progress in persuading airlines
that they should change their scheduling
to reduce delays. Likewise, he said the
f'AA has no plans to allow more air
borne "holding" of aircraft, which the in
dustry says is needed to ease the delays.
Engen said he has planned meetings
with the chief executive officers of most
of the airlines later this month in Dallas
and Atlanta to discuss FAA air traffic
control plans, the flight delay problem
and whether airlines can shift schedules
to ease congestions.
The FAA has acknowledged that the
number of delays has increased sharply
since the first of the year and over com

parative periods a year ago because of
greater demand for air travel, a concen
tration of flights during peak hours and
continued restrictions on the aircraft
flow.
While Engen said the airlines have
been "very cooperative" on the delay
issue, other FAA officials have com
plained that the industry is most at fault
for the delays because they try to crowd
too many flights into popular travel peri
ods and into busy airports.
Engen in the past has said the airlines
should re-schedule some of their flights,
but he acknowledged yesterday that the
carriers face possible antitrust problems
if they attempt to do so.
The air carriers have said they are
prohibited from shifting schedules with
out antitrust immunity. Airline officials
also have made clear that they are reluc
tant to move flights away from peak peri
ods unilaterally for fear of losing busi
ness.
Meanwhile, the FAA announced it
had taken 20 new initiatives aimed at
easing the flow of air traffic, including
the installation of new computer equip
ment and software to allow controllers to
manage aircraft more efficiently.
