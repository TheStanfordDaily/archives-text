### 
Washington (AP) — A teen-ager
who fell HO feet from a thrill ride and
a man whose wife was thrown to her
death from a roller coaster yesterday
called for an end to what an one offi
cial termed "amusement ride
roulette."
James Shaughnessy, 15, of LaSalle,
111., described in congressional tes
timony how he and two friends were
injured in a May 22 accident on "The
Edge," a thrill ride at the Great
America Park in Gurnee, 111.
Cars are pulled backward and up
90 feei off the ground before they are
released down a track. But the car in
which Shaughnessy and his friends
were seated became stranded for 10
minutes high above the ground.
"It was at that point that we knew
we were in real trouble and became
frightened. We began to pray to
gether. All our fears were realized
when we heard a single click and our
car suddenly plunged downward with
great speed and force onto the ride's
loading platform," he said.
"The seats of the car we were in
buckled around us like papier

mache," he said. "All I felt was pain,
there was blood all over me. I blacked
out."
Carl Holcomb, of Indianapolis,
described how his wife fell to her
death from a standing roller coaster in
Eureka, Mo., on July 7.
"I went to pieces right then," Hol
comb said, recalling how he called to
his daughter and her boyfriend in the
next car. They yelled for the
operators to stop the ride.
The panel also heard testimony
from Nancy Steorts, chairman of the
Consumer Product Safety Commis
sion, who said the"the American
consumer has no way of knowing the
level of safety on a particular ride at a
particular location."
In 1981, Congress stripped the
commission of its power to regulate
amusement parks, except for some
portable rides.
The hearing focused on three bills
proposed in the wake of the Illinois
accident and a recent fire that killed
eight teen-agers in an amusement
park haunted house in New Jersey.
