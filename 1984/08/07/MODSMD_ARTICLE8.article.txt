San Francisco (AP) — 'Type A' people — those
supercharged superachievers who reportedly have
a higher risk of heart attacks than their more
easygoing brethren — can change their ways to
reduce the risk, scientists reported yesterday.
"Your behavior— how you react to your envi
ronment and its challenges — plays as important,
or perhaps a far more important, part in bringing
on a heart attack than what you eat, inhale or how
you exercise your muscles," said Dr. Meyer Fried
man, director of the Recurrent Coronary Preven
tion Project at Mount Zion Hospital.
At a news conference, Friedman and Dr. Carl
Thoresen, professor of education at Stanford Uni
versity, presented findings of a three-year study
showing that heart attack victims who received
"Type A counseling" — on how to reduce stress

— had more than 50 percent fewer recurring
heart attacks than those who were not counseled.
Friedman, the first scientist to link Type A be
havior with heart disease, said 75 percent of the
adult, urban population in the United States can
be described as having a Type A personality.
Type A people are easily irritated or angered,
always in a hurry, aggressive, competitive yet in
secure and have low self-esteem.
Friedman showed a videotape of John Vaccar
rello, 55, a superintendent at Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., when he first entered the program
and then three years later after his Type A coun
seling.
"Prior to this study I felt hassled all the time. I
don't feel hassled now," he told reporters.
