Sacramento (AP) â€” Gov.
George Deukmejian's con
troversial Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta water pro
posal is dead for 1984, the
senator sponsoring the bill
for Deukmejian said yester
day.
Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-
Chino) announced he was
dropping the bill after oppo
nents scored two tactical vic
tories in parliamentary in
fighting before the Assembly
Rules Committee.

Ayala said the Republican
governor and his aides
wanted him to go ahead and
push for an Assembly show
down on the bill, but that he
didn't have the votes to pass
it and that any further
hearings would be
"superfluous."
In a telephone interview
yesterday evening, Ayala,
calling this year's proposal
"the governor's plan," said
he would push the bill again
next year.
