SOME OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
WORK FOR
CANCER IS
BEING DONE
OUTSIDE
THE LAB.
It's being done in
automobiles and living
rooms. Over coffee
and cake. By people
like Madeline Mitza and
Theresa Barbieri.
They met when
Madeline was in treat
ment for breast cancer
and Theresa was the
volunteer who drove
her to her therapy ap
pointments. Now like
Theresa, Madeline is
bringing help and
hope to other women
as a Reach to Recovery
volunteer.
Madeline and Ther
esa are living proof
that it's people who
give people the will to
live. The work in the lab
must continue. And so
must the work outside.
We need your help.
