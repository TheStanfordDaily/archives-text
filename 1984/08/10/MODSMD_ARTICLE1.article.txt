# Court rules Stanford didn't violate labor code
## 
### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
Following a July 1 1 State
Labor Commission hearing,
Deputy Labor Commissioner
Phillip Galvez of San Jose ruled
that Stanford did not violate the
State Labor Code when it
refused to collect and remit
members' dues to Union repre
sentatives last May.

The hearing, a result of
charges by United Stanford
Workers (USW), was held even
though Stanford did not attend,
but rather sent a hand-delivered
letter explaining the University
felt the State Labor Commission
hearing was preempted by the
Sept. 17 National Labor Rela
tions Board (NLRB) hearing.
The University stopped

deducting dues from about 1300
technical, maintenance and ser
vice workers in early May, fol
lowing a regional NLRB ruling
that Local 715 had "effectively
disclaimed interest" in
representing the group in early
February. USW charged that
this violated section 227 of the
State Labor code, which re
quires that an employer contrib

ute funds for certain employee
benefits. Union dues are not ex
plicitly listed among those
benefits.
Galvez's decision came as a
suprise to neither party. Stan
ford Staff Counsel Susan de
Jongh-Kearl said that she felt
Galvez had made the "legally
correct decision/' and added
that she had been "confident

that if Galvez analyzed the is
sues correctly, he would have
come up with that answer."
Eggleston expected Gaivez's
answer for a different reason.
"This is a tentative ruling at
best," he said. 'Tt's actually a
departure from normal proce
dure. Normally, the Labor
Commissioner makes a decision
about the charge, and then
passes his decision to the Dis
trict Attorne\. who then decides
whether or not to prosecute.
This decision was reached in
conjunction with the DA. Gai
ez did not make a separate
ruling." Eggieston said USW
had hoped the hearing would
follow standard procedure,
recuse the union had wanted
Galvez to "set a precedent"' by
ruling against the University.
"We didn't expect the case to
be prosecuted," he said, ex
plaining that the District Attor
ney has to concentrate on
prosecuting "high visibilty"
crimes such as homicide, rather
than long, involved cases such as
this.
"Basically, the DA just
wasn't able to take a courageous
stand," Eggieston said. I guess
you could say he backed down."
Both de Jongh-Kearl and Eg

gleston said this decision will
have little or no effect on the
Sept. 17 NLRB hearing. "These
are entirely separate matters,"
de Jongh-Kearl said. "The ap
plicability of state law has no
bearing on the NLRB."

"We didn't lose anything,"
said Eggleston. "We were trying
to set a precedent for other uni
ons, and, as such, this decision
represents a setback to all uni
ons. But this in no way settles
the primary dispute."
