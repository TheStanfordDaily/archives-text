# COMMENTARY
## John Mark Agosta Refusing defense research funds is ineffective 
### 
Should Congress take away scarce tax
payers' dollars from the urgent needs of
human welfare and national defense and
give them to researchers who will basi
cally do what they want with them?
This is not a real concern: Congress
never actually does such a thing, at least
not intentionally.
When the Reagan budget changes
rubbed up against research priorites, a
lot of old wounds were reopened, and
the discussion about why the government
funds research, especially military re
search, bled again.
The arguments I have heard about
how and why the government actually
funds research sound politically naive.
Most of the discussion centers around
the question, "should the university ac
cept defense money or not?" This topic
was the subject of a spate of "flames"
(long winded diatribes) on the Computer
Science electronic bulletin board earlier
this year.
Some professors at Stanford refuse to
solicit research money from military
sources. As long as they can get funding
for their graduate students and research
ers, this is fine: Researchers should not
have to justify their work as supporting
national goals. Requiring the "political
correctness of science" would destroy
pure science. However if these folks
want to have a say in the uses of their
work, as they claim they do, being a
"funding holdout" is a rather back
handed. ineffectual approach.
In a similar vein, the applicants I spoke
to for the University Commitee on Re
search said they simply wanted Univer
sity researchers to know how much of
their work is defense-funded. Yet I
believe these applicants believed that if
people realized the source of their payc
hecks they would rise in indignation, de
manding that the university purify itself
of such loathsome activities. This is a
vain hope.
First, let me give some facts before 1
begin my flame in response to theirs.
What are government trends in funding?
In round numbers, basic and applied re
search together received $1.3 billion in
1982, a little more than a third of that for
basic. Of the total, roughly half was via
the defense budget. On the civilian side
the largest and most visible chunk is
funded by the National Science Founda
tion. This is largely basic university re
search. The NSF budget just passed one
billion, about the same sum that
Congress sets aside for its own opera

tions. (These numbers are from back is
sues of Science magazine.)
Since President Reagan entered office,
total R&D (including development, the
larger share of R&D) has increased 17
percent. This obscures a 35 percent
decline in civilian R&D and a 60 percent
increase for the military. These numbers
reflect changes in large systems develop
ment projects, e.g. MX missies in place
of energy development, more than
changes in academic research.
Mathematics?! Queen of the well
endowed physical sciences? Flash! New
sheadline: National Research Council
committee reports math grossly under
funded. "In a special report released this
June, the committee said, the problems
are now near boiling point. This past
year, only 60 mathematicians were re
ceiving federal support. In contrast, 1200
physics students and 2500 chemistry
post-doctoral students were supported
by government funds." (Science, Aug. 3,
page 485)
Continuing: "The problems with
mathematics funding began in the mid
'6os, when the Defense Department
began cutting off research support for
projects that had no immediate applica
tions . . . The sharp decline in mathema
tics funding did not show up in federal
budget reports because math and com
puter science totals have traditionally
been combined in reports."
The amazing part of this story is that
the research community remained so
complacent as it occurred. Imagine if the
"erosion" had happened to the support
received by U.S. dairy farmers. Even a
politically active recipient would have
raised Cain if his family support
dwindled to $2000 for the summer, typi
cal of the sum received for a mathematics
summer grant.
So how are funding distributions made
in science, "the endless frontier?" To
fracture the idiom, the new American
frontier is populated by cowboys, just as
the old one was. Here I can relate some
personal experience from working for a
small civilian federal agency's R&D of
fice. We were deluged with funding
proposals conveyed by mail and in per
son. When my boss was sold on some
one's proposal, he would call me into his
office. An ex-Navy pilot, he still had
some of the right stuff in his gaze, as he
fixed it on me:
"John," he'd begin, "Let me introduce
Dr. So-and-so. I'd like you to take him
down to the grants office and get the

wheels turning. We're going to shake
loose a quarter million dollars from the
agency budget for him. Anything less
would be wasting our time, don't you
agree?"
Who did we fund? People who we
trusted would advance our program
goals, inure us to the Congressmen who
were sticking their necks out to vote us a
budget, and who would not be reckless
enough to get caught doing something
like flying with their secretaries to
Hawaii on government funds.
"Advancing program goals" is a eup
hemism for providing ammunition to
fight power bathes within the ar
We took our program mission seriously,
perhaps too much so.
In the midst of this there was a place
for academic excellence in proposal se
lection. Each proposal went out for two
independent reviews for scientific merit.
But this was after the fact. It was one of a
myriad of hurdles spanning several
months that I had to see to, so the pro
posal would get funded.
It our activitv had a purpose, it was to
free researchers from the political wiles
that infected the money we gave them.
The sad part of this story is that we didn't
succeed in pulling this off. We were in
the precarious state of having promises
extracted from us on 1000 percent of the
use of our funds. We reported to several
different Congressional committees, and
in addition had to satisfy the president's
Office of Management and Budget that
we were spending money on the right
things. As you may guess, many of the
demands placed on us were inconsistent.
Yet this was hardly, something to phase
us. We simply rewrote and rearranged
our program descriptions to satisfy each
master we had to serve. This was a full
time job for most of the agency staff in
Washington.
Do you wonder why government
procurements have such marvelously
obscure titles? Imagine this exchange
among two budget gnomes:
"Gwynedd, where did we spend the
ten million we promised the Senator for
aquatic weed control in Florida?"
"Llywarch, why don't you just put
down the 'Assessment of the ecological
impact of alternative technologies' proj
ect for that one."
Then what might be the Senator's
response? "I'm just a poo-war country
law-ya, lookin' out fer the well-being of
my consti-too-ents, who wouldn' be ex
pected to unnar-stan' this high-falutin'

so-called science, much less can I;
nevaar-the-less I'd truly like to be able
vote for you-all's up- coming budget, so
why don you confer with my staff and
see if you can work somethin' out?"
I think you get the point.
When the last presidential election
came, we lost out. The agency was politi
cally vulnerable, and our research fun
ding program was lost in the wave of so
cial budget cuts. When it came to re
search funding, we were bureaucratic
lightweights.
In comparison, the Defense Depart
ment and the services within it have con
sistently been able to guarantee security
to the researchers they fund. They do
this by keeping political forces at bay.
The whole department reports to only
one Congressional committee in each
chamber. It is under no legislative re
quirement to ai. nge the proposals it
funds in a geographically "fair" manner.
The Mansfield Amendment did not re
quire them to fund only projects relevant
to their mission. Neither has this put a
crimp in their style of funding basic re
search.
My point is that our government funds
research when it can be ostensibly justif
ied by a national program goal. And for
basically historical reasons arising during
World War 11, the military has taken this
role. It has been successful because of
the bureaucratic reasons I just made fun
of. There is no scientific Santa Claus.
And the opinions of those scientists who
carry out the work have until now
counted for not a wit.
So when scientists or engineers form a
group to withold their efforts or
"convert" activities to non-military uses,
they are pushing on a string. The deci
sions are being made elsewhere. This ac
tivity is self-congratulatory at best, and a
delusion if it is mistaken for political ac
tion. Imagine General Motors protesting
the environmental regulation it faces by
refusing to build tanks and other vehicles
for the Army! When they want some
thing changed, they lobby Congress for
it, and work through their "political ac
tion committees." Universities as a
group are beginning to do the same. Sci
entists and engineers should take note.
(John Mark Agosta receives a fellowship
in the Computer Science department from
private sources. This is by accident, not
choice, and he would not refuse military
funding. His column has appeared every
other Thursday.)

tions . . . The sharp decline in mathema
tics funding did not show up in federal
budget reports because math and com
puter science totals have traditionally
been combined in reports."
The amazing part of this story is that
the research community remained so
complacent as it occurred. Imagine if the
"erosion" had happened to the support
received by U.S. dairy farmers. Even a
politically active recipient would have
raised Cain if his family support
dwindled to $2000 for the summer, typi
cal of the sum received for a mathematics
summer grant.
So how are funding distributions made
in science, "the endless frontier?" To
fracture the idiom, the new American
frontier is populated by cowboys, just as
the old one was. Here I can relate some
personal experience from working for a
small civilian federal agency's R&D of
fice. We were deluged with funding
proposals conveyed by mail and in per
son. When my boss was sold on some
one's proposal, he would call me into his
office. An ex-Navy pilot, he still had
some of the right stuff in his gaze, as he
fixed it on me:
"John," he'd begin, "Let me introduce
Dr. So-and-so. I'd like you to take him
down to the grants office and get the

wheels turning. We're going to shake
loose a quarter million dollars from the
agency budget for him. Anything less
would be wasting our time, don't you
agree?"
Who did we fund? People who we
trusted would advance our program
goals, inure us to the Congressmen who
were sticking their necks out to vote us a
budget, and who would not be reckless
enough to get caught doing something
like flying with their secretaries to
Hawaii on government funds.
"Advancing program goals" is a eup
hemism for providing ammunition to
fight power bathes within the ar
We took our program mission seriously,
perhaps too much so.
In the midst of this there was a place
for academic excellence in proposal se
lection. Each proposal went out for two
independent reviews for scientific merit.
But this was after the fact. It was one of a
myriad of hurdles spanning several
months that I had to see to, so the pro
posal would get funded.
It our activitv had a purpose, it was to
free researchers from the political wiles
that infected the money we gave them.
The sad part of this story is that we didn't
succeed in pulling this off. We were in
the precarious state of having promises
extracted from us on 1000 percent of the
use of our funds. We reported to several
different Congressional committees, and
in addition had to satisfy the president's
Office of Management and Budget that
we were spending money on the right
things. As you may guess, many of the
demands placed on us were inconsistent.
Yet this was hardly, something to phase
us. We simply rewrote and rearranged
our program descriptions to satisfy each
master we had to serve. This was a full
time job for most of the agency staff in
Washington.
Do you wonder why government
procurements have such marvelously
obscure titles? Imagine this exchange
among two budget gnomes:
"Gwynedd, where did we spend the
ten million we promised the Senator for
aquatic weed control in Florida?"
"Llywarch, why don't you just put
down the 'Assessment of the ecological
impact of alternative technologies' proj
ect for that one."
Then what might be the Senator's
response? "I'm just a poo-war country
law-ya, lookin' out fer the well-being of
my consti-too-ents, who wouldn' be ex
pected to unnar-stan' this high-falutin'

so-called science, much less can I;
nevaar-the-less I'd truly like to be able
vote for you-all's up- coming budget, so
why don you confer with my staff and
see if you can work somethin' out?"
I think you get the point.
When the last presidential election
came, we lost out. The agency was politi
cally vulnerable, and our research fun
ding program was lost in the wave of so
cial budget cuts. When it came to re
search funding, we were bureaucratic
lightweights.
In comparison, the Defense Depart
ment and the services within it have con
sistently been able to guarantee security
to the researchers they fund. They do
this by keeping political forces at bay.
The whole department reports to only
one Congressional committee in each
chamber. It is under no legislative re
quirement to ai. nge the proposals it
funds in a geographically "fair" manner.
The Mansfield Amendment did not re
quire them to fund only projects relevant
to their mission. Neither has this put a
crimp in their style of funding basic re
search.
My point is that our government funds
research when it can be ostensibly justif
ied by a national program goal. And for
basically historical reasons arising during
World War 11, the military has taken this
role. It has been successful because of
the bureaucratic reasons I just made fun
of. There is no scientific Santa Claus.
And the opinions of those scientists who
carry out the work have until now
counted for not a wit.
So when scientists or engineers form a
group to withold their efforts or
"convert" activities to non-military uses,
they are pushing on a string. The deci
sions are being made elsewhere. This ac
tivity is self-congratulatory at best, and a
delusion if it is mistaken for political ac
tion. Imagine General Motors protesting
the environmental regulation it faces by
refusing to build tanks and other vehicles
for the Army! When they want some
thing changed, they lobby Congress for
it, and work through their "political ac
tion committees." Universities as a
group are beginning to do the same. Sci
entists and engineers should take note.
(John Mark Agosta receives a fellowship
in the Computer Science department from
private sources. This is by accident, not
choice, and he would not refuse military
funding. His column has appeared every
other Thursday.)
Should Congress take away scarce tax
payers' dollars from the urgent needs of
human welfare and national defense and
give them to researchers who will basi
cally do what they want with them?
This is not a real concern: Congress
never actually does such a thing, at least
not intentionally.
When the Reagan budget changes
rubbed up against research priorites, a
lot of old wounds were reopened, and
the discussion about why the government
funds research, especially military re
search, bled again.
The arguments I have heard about
how and why the government actually
funds research sound politically naive.
Most of the discussion centers around
the question, "should the university ac
cept defense money or not?" This topic
was the subject of a spate of "flames"
(long winded diatribes) on the Computer
Science electronic bulletin board earlier
this year.
Some professors at Stanford refuse to
solicit research money from military
sources. As long as they can get funding
for their graduate students and research
ers, this is fine: Researchers should not
have to justify their work as supporting
national goals. Requiring the "political
correctness of science" would destroy
pure science. However if these folks
want to have a say in the uses of their
work, as they claim they do, being a
"funding holdout" is a rather back
handed. ineffectual approach.
In a similar vein, the applicants I spoke
to for the University Commitee on Re
search said they simply wanted Univer
sity researchers to know how much of
their work is defense-funded. Yet I
believe these applicants believed that if
people realized the source of their payc
hecks they would rise in indignation, de
manding that the university purify itself
of such loathsome activities. This is a
vain hope.
First, let me give some facts before 1
begin my flame in response to theirs.
What are government trends in funding?
In round numbers, basic and applied re
search together received $1.3 billion in
1982, a little more than a third of that for
basic. Of the total, roughly half was via
the defense budget. On the civilian side
the largest and most visible chunk is
funded by the National Science Founda
tion. This is largely basic university re
search. The NSF budget just passed one
billion, about the same sum that
Congress sets aside for its own opera

tions. (These numbers are from back is
sues of Science magazine.)
Since President Reagan entered office,
total R&D (including development, the
larger share of R&D) has increased 17
percent. This obscures a 35 percent
decline in civilian R&D and a 60 percent
increase for the military. These numbers
reflect changes in large systems develop
ment projects, e.g. MX missies in place
of energy development, more than
changes in academic research.
Mathematics?! Queen of the well
endowed physical sciences? Flash! New
sheadline: National Research Council
committee reports math grossly under
funded. "In a special report released this
June, the committee said, the problems
are now near boiling point. This past
year, only 60 mathematicians were re
ceiving federal support. In contrast, 1200
physics students and 2500 chemistry
post-doctoral students were supported
by government funds." (Science, Aug. 3,
page 485)
Continuing: "The problems with
mathematics funding began in the mid
'6os, when the Defense Department
began cutting off research support for
projects that had no immediate applica
tions . . . The sharp decline in mathema
tics funding did not show up in federal

law-ya, lookin' out fer the well-being of
my consti-too-ents, who wouldn' be ex
pected to unnar-stan' this high-falutin'

so-called science, much less can I;
nevaar-the-less I'd truly like to be able
vote for you-all's up- coming budget, so
why don you confer with my staff and
see if you can work somethin' out?"
I think you get the point.
When the last presidential election
came, we lost out. The agency was politi
cally vulnerable, and our research fun
ding program was lost in the wave of so
cial budget cuts. When it came to re
search funding, we were bureaucratic
lightweights.
In comparison, the Defense Depart
ment and the services within it have con
sistently been able to guarantee security
to the researchers they fund. They do
this by keeping political forces at bay.
The whole department reports to only
one Congressional committee in each
chamber. It is under no legislative re
quirement to ai. nge the proposals it
funds in a geographically "fair" manner.
The Mansfield Amendment did not re
quire them to fund only projects relevant
to their mission. Neither has this put a
crimp in their style of funding basic re
search.
My point is that our government funds
research when it can be ostensibly justif
ied by a national program goal. And for
basically historical reasons arising during
World War 11, the military has taken this
role. It has been successful because of
the bureaucratic reasons I just made fun
of. There is no scientific Santa Claus.
And the opinions of those scientists who
carry out the work have until now
counted for not a wit.
So when scientists or engineers form a
group to withold their efforts or
"convert" activities to non-military uses,
they are pushing on a string. The deci
sions are being made elsewhere. This ac
tivity is self-congratulatory at best, and a
delusion if it is mistaken for political ac
tion. Imagine General Motors protesting
the environmental regulation it faces by
refusing to build tanks and other vehicles
for the Army! When they want some
thing changed, they lobby Congress for
it, and work through their "political ac
tion committees." Universities as a
group are beginning to do the same. Sci
entists and engineers should take note.
(John Mark Agosta receives a fellowship
in the Computer Science department from
private sources. This is by accident, not
choice, and he would not refuse military
funding. His column has appeared every
other Thursday.)
