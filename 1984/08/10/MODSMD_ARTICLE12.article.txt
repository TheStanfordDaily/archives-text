## Local 680 wants autonomy 
### 
I am a recent newcomer to the Bay Area and as
such have been reading with some surprise, some
concern and some alarm about events taking place
at Stanford over the past year.
Last fall, there was a big brouhaha between the
University, the Hoover Institute and the White
House concerning the infamous Reagan Library
complex. I was pleasantly surpised with the Uni
versity's position and admired your courage, Mr.
Kennedy, in "sticking to your guns' 1 against those

who would secure Stanford property for question
able purposes and expect Stanford to relinquish
all control — it was a matter of non-negotiable
autonomy.
My concern has been growing since this spring
over the matter of union representation at the
University. Union members here expressed their
dissatisfaction with Local 715 and desired changes
in leadership. With unions, it happens a lot. Local
715 then expressed its desire to step aside and.
having thus reached a mutual consensus, an elec
tion was scheduled to endorse such a change. The
result was clear; if it had been this November's
election, it would have been termed a huge
landslide. Union voters expressed an inarguable

wish to have Local 680 represent them at Stan
ford. My alarm was triggered when you, Mr. Ken
nedy, after rising to a new level of community
respect for your stand against the Potomac River
Bullies, showed your true colors, revealing, I
believe, not a principled man but the lowest of op
portunists. Logic cancelled the university's obliga
tion to deduct dues and turn those funds over to
the union.
This issue, too, is clear to me: it is a matter of
non-negotiable autonomy. But what outrages me
the most is that the chief of this highly respected
educational institution subscribes to a set of rub
berized principles which appear to expand or con
tract depending upon the political and/or financial
advantage to be realized.
Mr. Kennedy, you claim you have our best in
terests at heart. Well, why do I never see you
around this "neck of the woods?" I see that
"irresponsible" — your label, not mine — Linda
Crouse, with the members, listening to their
gripes and suggestions and sitting in on their
grievance hearings. Where are you? Sitting all
nice and cozy in your presidential mansion or
flying all over the country to attend your fair share
of gala functions?
Mr. Kennedy, as evident from our election in
April, the members of Local 680 demand that our
autonomy be respected, just as you inferred to
Edwin Meese last fall. As a personal note, I advise
you drop the "legal" stall tactics and recognize
Local 680 immediately, before both you and the
University suffer irreparable harm in the public
arena.
