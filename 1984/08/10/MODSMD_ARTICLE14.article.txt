# Students leap forward with Upward Bound
## 
### LYDIA ROBINSON 
Some struggle with the English lan
guage, having recently arrived in the
United States. Others have financial dif
ficulties. All want to be given the oppor
tunity to learn, grow and succeed.
To give these children a chance to
realize their full potential, a federally
funded program known as Upward
Bound was established in the mid-1960s
during the Great Society years of Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson.
Today, Upward Bound helps 35-
40,000 financially disadvantaged high
school students nationally per year. The
program is run by the Department of
Education at an annual cost of $68.3 mil
lion. Funding for the program has
remained fairly steady, despite budget
cuts in other areas.
To be eligible for Upward Bound, a
high school student must be the first gen
eration in his or her family that is plan
ning to go to college. The student's par
ents must also demonstrate financial
need. For example, the maximum per
missible income for a family of four is
$14,850 per year.
Furthermore, a student must demon
strate a high degree of motivation or ap
titude for college preparatory subjects.
According to Walter Lewis, chief of
the Education Outreach Branch of the
Department of Education, Upward
Bound has been fairly successful in ac

hieving its goals.
"Past figures show a high success rate
for the Upward Bound students, based
on the number of students who enroll in
post-secondary education," he said, "as
many as 60-75 percent of the students go
on to college."
Stanford's Upward Bound program
consists of two tutoring centers in the
Peninsula's Sequoia Union High School
District where students may stop to get
help with their assignments and informa
tion about applying for college. It is run
by the Stanford School of Education in
collaboration with counselors in the
school district.
"The counselors have a sense of which
kids are eligible and identify them for
us," said Nel Noddings, Stanford profes
sor of education who runs the program.
Forms are sent home to the parents,
who must be willing to share some infor
mation about their background. The
counselors then gather the information
and give the student an endorsement.
Most of the students involved with the
Stanford program are black, Hispanic, or
Asian because of the school district in
volved, Noddings said.
"There are a lot of Vietnamese too,
many of whom have been here a very
short time. Some kids have only been in
American schools a couple of months,
and they're really struggling with the lan
guage," she said.

The highlight of the University's pro
gram is a six-week summer session,
where students live on the Stanford
campus and take college preparatory
courses taught by Noddings, Sequoia
school district faculty and Stanford doc
toral students in education.
The 60 students in the program this
year spend their morning hours in
classes, while the afternoons are spent on
jobs provided by the Santa Clara County
Summer Youth Employment Program.
In the evenings, the students work in
structured study halls under the supervi
sion of tutors.
"We put an emphasis on language in
all our classes. Even in algebra, I concen
trate on word problems," Noddings said.
The 10 morning classes include study
skills, world studies, geometry, introduc
tion to computers, English as a second
language and career exploration.
Many students who have gone on to
college from Upward Bound praise the
program for its contribution to their
lives.
"Upward Bound helped me out. It
focused my attention on college life,
taught me about dorm life. I think the
schools that I applied to saw the Stanford
Upward Bound program as valuable,"
said Dan Jimenez, from East Palo Alto.
Jimenez is planning to go to Harvard
next fall.
Felecia Cullen, an 11th grader from

East Palo Alto, also has words of praise
for Upward Bound.
"Before I came here, I didn't even
know how to write a resume. I've also
learned to be responsible for my key and
my own room, and to have a lot of
responsibilties like going to school and
work." Cullen's ambition is to be a
pediatrician or physical therapist.
A significant drawback to the program
is the government paperwork which
keeps Noddings busy. Tutors also note
variations in the motivation of students,
saying that while most students take the
program seriously, others view their six
weeks on campus as a party time.
Nodding admits the "dorm counselors
are frazzled, hearing the thunder of
adolescent feet. They like to try things
out, so we have to monitor them quite
closely. But by and large, these are good
kids. They're better behaved than some
of our fraternities.
The Upward Bound will come up for
federal reauthorization in 1985. The
Senate Appropriations Committee has
recommended a $10 million per year in
crease for the program, but the House
has not held public hearings on the mat
ter.
"In California it is super important
that the outcome will be favorable, be
cause all the schools are financially con
strained. That makes a program like this
even more important," Noddings said.

To be eligible for Upward Bound, a
high school student must be the first gen
eration in his or her family that is plan
ning to go to college. The student's par
ents must also demonstrate financial
need. For example, the maximum per
missible income for a family of four is
$14,850 per year.
Furthermore, a student must demon
strate a high degree of motivation or ap
titude for college preparatory subjects.
According to Walter Lewis, chief of
the Education Outreach Branch of the
Department of Education, Upward
Bound has been fairly successful in ac

hieving its goals.
"Past figures show a high success rate
for the Upward Bound students, based
on the number of students who enroll in
post-secondary education," he said, "as
many as 60-75 percent of the students go
on to college."
Stanford's Upward Bound program
consists of two tutoring centers in the
Peninsula's Sequoia Union High School
District where students may stop to get
help with their assignments and informa
tion about applying for college. It is run
by the Stanford School of Education in
collaboration with counselors in the
school district.
"The counselors have a sense of which
kids are eligible and identify them for
us," said Nel Noddings, Stanford profes
sor of education who runs the program.
Forms are sent home to the parents,
who must be willing to share some infor
mation about their background. The
counselors then gather the information
and give the student an endorsement.
Most of the students involved with the
Stanford program are black, Hispanic, or
Asian because of the school district in
volved, Noddings said.
"There are a lot of Vietnamese too,
many of whom have been here a very
short time. Some kids have only been in
American schools a couple of months,
and they're really struggling with the lan
guage," she said.

The highlight of the University's pro
gram is a six-week summer session,
where students live on the Stanford
campus and take college preparatory
courses taught by Noddings, Sequoia
school district faculty and Stanford doc
toral students in education.
The 60 students in the program this
year spend their morning hours in
classes, while the afternoons are spent on
jobs provided by the Santa Clara County
Summer Youth Employment Program.
In the evenings, the students work in
structured study halls under the supervi
sion of tutors.
"We put an emphasis on language in
all our classes. Even in algebra, I concen
trate on word problems," Noddings said.
The 10 morning classes include study
skills, world studies, geometry, introduc
tion to computers, English as a second
language and career exploration.
Many students who have gone on to
college from Upward Bound praise the
program for its contribution to their
lives.
"Upward Bound helped me out. It
focused my attention on college life,
taught me about dorm life. I think the
schools that I applied to saw the Stanford
Upward Bound program as valuable,"
said Dan Jimenez, from East Palo Alto.
Jimenez is planning to go to Harvard
next fall.
Felecia Cullen, an 11th grader from

East Palo Alto, also has words of praise
for Upward Bound.
"Before I came here, I didn't even
know how to write a resume. I've also
learned to be responsible for my key and
my own room, and to have a lot of
responsibilties like going to school and
work." Cullen's ambition is to be a
pediatrician or physical therapist.
A significant drawback to the program
is the government paperwork which
keeps Noddings busy. Tutors also note
variations in the motivation of students,
saying that while most students take the
program seriously, others view their six
weeks on campus as a party time.
Nodding admits the "dorm counselors
are frazzled, hearing the thunder of
adolescent feet. They like to try things
out, so we have to monitor them quite
closely. But by and large, these are good
kids. They're better behaved than some
of our fraternities.
The Upward Bound will come up for
federal reauthorization in 1985. The
Senate Appropriations Committee has
recommended a $10 million per year in
crease for the program, but the House
has not held public hearings on the mat
ter.
"In California it is super important
that the outcome will be favorable, be
cause all the schools are financially con
strained. That makes a program like this
even more important," Noddings said.
