## Brazil advances to final with OT win 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Sometimes in sports it's better
to be lucky than good. If you're
lucky and good, though, the
combination can be unstop
pable. A very good Brazilian
team reaffirmed this Tuesday
night, as fate smiled on them in
their 2-1 overtime victory over
Italy in a semifinal match here
before 83,642.
The good fortune came at the
95:22 mark, during the first
overtime. Tanho controlled the
ball on the right wing for Brazil.
He was closely marked by an
Italian defender and tried to
center the ball from about 15
yards out. He missed the ball,
though, and it rolled to his left.
Standing there, however, was
Brazil's Ronaldo Silva. He
trapped it and fired a low shot
from the right side about eight
yards out. The shot hugged the
ground as Italian goalkeeper
Franco Tancredi dove to his
right, but the ball slid beneath
Tancredi and into the net.
Tonho said of the goal,
"What I had in mind was differ
ent from what happened. I
wanted to get the ball into the
box for an attacker, but the ball
went differently and onto
Ronaldo's foot."
Silva said, "It was a very for
tunate goal in the game, a very
fortunate goal in the game that
caused us to go into the final.
The ball just came to me and I
was fortunate enough to put it
in."
The Brazilian side began to
celebrate. Though there were
still 25 minutes of overtime
remaining, they were confident
that they would hold Italy score

less. They did. Italy got only
four shots on goal in both
overtime periods â€” two were
stopped by the Brazilian
defense, two went wide.
As a result, Brazil moves into
tomorrow night's gold medal

game at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena against France, which
beat Yugoslavia 4-2 in the other
semifinal game in Pasadena.
Italy faces the Yugoslavs tonight
at the Rose Bowl for the bronze.
Those who were expecting a

defensive game weren't
surprised by the scoreless first
half. The Italian team came into
the game as the toughest defen
sive squad in the tournament,
allowing only one goal in its first
four games, while Brazil had

permitted only two except for
those scored on penalty kicks,
kicks. Brazil had scored seven
outside of penalty kicks, while
Italy showed an anemic offense,
with just three goals in four
games.
The best chance in the first
half came on an Italian defen
sive mistake. Gilmar, Brazil's
top scorer, was even with an
Italian defender as a teammate
sent a pass into the Italian zone.
The defender slipped, though,
and allowed Gilmar to receive
the pass and move in alone on
Tancredi. The Italian keeper
came up with a diving stop on
the play to rob Gilmar near the
20-minute mark.
Italy almost got a goal itself
nine minutes later. Sebastiano
Nela, back with the team after a
three-game suspension stem
ming from the opening match
with Egypt, sent a crossing pass
into the middle from the left
side. Andre Ferreira stopped it
for Brazil, but in clearing it he
somehow sent it toward his own
goal, just barely putting it over
the crossbar.
The second half saw a little
more offense. Brazil struck first,
as Gilmar broke the ice at
52:50. Tonho assisted on this
one as well, sending a pass to
Gilmar inside the penalty area
just eight yards out. Tancredi
came out to play the ball, but
Gilmar managed to deflect it
past him into the net.
"That particular tactic is one
we practice," Tonho said after
ward. "It consists of me moving
to midfield, getting the ball,
then sending into the box for
