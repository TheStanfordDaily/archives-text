The "Star Wars' 1 space
defense system proposed by
President Reagan is a
"dangerous and destabilizing"
idea, according to three Stan
ford arms control experts.
Sidney Drell, Philip Farley
and David Hollowav analyzed
the flaws in the "Star Wars"
proposal in a new study entitled
"The Reagan Strategic Defense
Initiative: A Technical, Political
and Arms Control Assess
ment," published this summer
by the Stanford Center for In
ternational Security and Arms
Control.
The 142-page report is a

response to a speech Reagan
made in March 1983 which
called for a major long-term ef
fort to provide an American
defense against ballistic missiles.
The report concludes that a
defensive system such as the one
the president proposed is both
technically unfeasible and
politically unwise.
In the absence of meaningful
arms control agreements be
tween the two major super
powers, such a defense system
would provide only an illusion
of security, while giving the So
viet Union an incentive to ex
pand its own nuclear arsenal.
