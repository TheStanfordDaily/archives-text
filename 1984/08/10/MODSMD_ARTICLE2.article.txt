# Drell study opposes 'Star Wars' defense

### SAM DELSON Daily staff 
The "Star Wars' 1 space
defense system proposed by
President Reagan is a
"dangerous and destabilizing"
idea, according to three Stan
ford arms control experts.
Sidney Drell, Philip Farley
and David Hollowav analyzed
the flaws in the "Star Wars"
proposal in a new study entitled
"The Reagan Strategic Defense
Initiative: A Technical, Political
and Arms Control Assess
ment," published this summer
by the Stanford Center for In
ternational Security and Arms
Control.
The 142-page report is a

response to a speech Reagan
made in March 1983 which
called for a major long-term ef
fort to provide an American
defense against ballistic missiles.
The report concludes that a
defensive system such as the one
the president proposed is both
technically unfeasible and
politically unwise.
In the absence of meaningful
arms control agreements be
tween the two major super
powers, such a defense system
would provide only an illusion
of security, while giving the So
viet Union an incentive to ex
pand its own nuclear arsenal.
the report said.
At a news conference yester
day, Drell listed several policy
recommendations intended to
restrain the arms race.
They included cutting the ad
ministration's current request of
$26 billion over the next five
years for the strategic defense
system to $10 billion.
The scholars also asked that
the strategic system be limited
to theoretical research instead

of actual testing and deploy
ment of anti-ballistic missiles
(ABMs) in order to avoid
violating the U.S.-Soviet ABM
treaty.
Other recommendations
called for creation of a non
partisan advisory panel to moni
tor the program and consulta
tion with the Soviets and with
the United States' NATO allies
before the system is deployed or
tested.
The study includes excerpts
from a previously unpublished
interview with Soviet dissident
Andrei Sakharov, conducted by
Ernst Henry in 1967.

Sakharov, a Nobel laureate
and friend of Drell, said con
struction of antimissile defense
systems would "create the illu
sion of invulnerability" which
could cause "hawks and mad
men" to "strengthen their at
traction to the idea of a
'preventive' thermonuclear
strike."
Drell is the deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and the co
director of the University's Cen
ter for International Security
and Arms Control, where both
Farley and Holloway are senior
research associates.
