# Olympians comment on soccer, Stanford
## 
### STACFY KIVEL 
Jeff Durgan, a defender on the U.S.
Olympic Soccer Team, had said at the
beginning of the Games here that the
American players were out to sell this
country on soccer. But a combination of
nationwide disinterest by both sports
fans and ABC Television caused them to
come up short of their goal.
"People treated our victory against
Costa Rica as a 'So what?' They failed to
realize that the 1 Inited States hadn't won
an Olympic soccer game in 60 years,"
said Durgan. Though impressed by the
turnout at S T inford Siadium, he was dis
appointe i by the lack of television
coverage. "ABC doesn't realize we're
U.S. Olympians," he said.
Durgan, a 22-year-old native of
Tacoma, Wash., has been playing soccer
since he was eight He was drafted by the
New York Cosmos of the North Ameri
can Soccer League straight out of high
school.
Ail but four of the 17 players on the
American team are professionals, a
result of a rule change by the Federation
Internationale de Football Association,
the sport's governing body, allowing
anyone except players with World Cup
experience to play in the Olympics.
Asked how he related to players from
the other teams living in Branner Hall
during the Games here, Durgan replied,
"Soccer is not a sport like gymnastics

where you're just competing against a
judge. It involves a lot of brutality be
tween the players. It's hard to kick a man
one minute and then eat dinner with him
the next."
Durgan added that his priority with
the other American team members was
to act as hosts to the foreign teams and
make them feel as much at home as pos
sible. Though he did not go out of his
way to converse with the members of the
other teams, he says he was polite and
hospitable.
The U.S. Olympic Soccer Team is
made up of players from around the
country. "Guys I used to play against
with the Cosmos are now on the same
team as I am," Durgan said. Overall, the
members of the team seemed to get
along really well, even though they had
only been playing together for three
weeks before the Games.
As he waved to the security helicopter
circling overhead, Durgan commented
that he didn't mind the tight security —
in fact he largely approved of it.
The American team had an early 10
p.m. curfew. Durgan, however, said he
sometimes stayed out later, since playing
pingpong and Atari games in Branner
could get boring. "I know my own limita
tions, and since I'm a professional, I
would never do anything that I feel
would hurt my performance on the field,
like staying out until three in the morn

ing," Durgan said. He said walking
around the campus at night was his usual
activity.
Durgan took the Olympic Oath on be
half of all the players during the Opening
Ceremonies here. He said it was merely a
case of someone being needed and he
being in the right place. "I'm just glad I
did better than Edwin Moses," he said,
laughing, in reference to the American
gold medal hurdler who forgot the Oath
in Los Angeles the day before.
When the Olympics finish Sunday,
Durgan plans to return to his home in
New Jersey with his wife and continue
his career with the Cosmos. Durgan said
that he does not want to be a profes
sional coach when he retires. He thinks
the way to make soccer popular in this
country is through children, and he
would like to work with them. Before
that, though, he is planning on playing on
the U.S. National Team that will try to
qualify for the 1986 World Cup.
Durgan, unfortunately didn't get much
of a chance to play in the Olympics. He
missed the first two games against Costa
Rica and Italy with a pulled calf muscle,
and he reinjured it just 34 minutes into
the game with Egypt and was forced to
leave the match.
The team also failed in its bid to win a
medal. The Americans tied with Egypt
for the second quarterfinal berth in
Group D, but Egypt got the nod by

scoring one more goal overall than the
U.S. The Americans finished with a 1-1-
1 record.
Unlike Durgan, who hopes to make
soccer a more popular sport in the U.S.,
Manfred Bockenfeld of the West Ger
man team is playing the most popular
sport in his country. The 24-year-old
native of Dusseldorf has been playing the
game for 16 of those years, four of them
as a professional.
Asked what he liked best about the
United States, Bockenfeld replied, "The
girls," but he hasn't seen much more
than the Stanford campus. He said he
dislikes the security, but understands the
need for it.
Because of the language barrier,
Bockenfeld said he rarely spoke to
players from other teams. He also
echoed Durgan, saying, "It's hard to be
friends and play against each other."
The West German team curfew was
not as strict as the Americans', being as
late as 1 a.m. on the night after a game.
The West Germans also got into the
community, roadtripping to Marine
World, for example, last Thursday. The
excursion may have helped the team's
on-field performance, as the West Ger
mans rebounded from a 1-0 loss to Brazil
by blasting Saudi Arabia last Friday, 6-0.
Though Bockenfeld is a star in West
Germany, he said, "This is the high point
of my career, to play in the Olympics."

missed the first two games against Costa
Rica and Italy with a pulled calf muscle,
and he reinjured it just 34 minutes into
the game with Egypt and was forced to
leave the match.
The team also failed in its bid to win a
medal. The Americans tied with Egypt
for the second quarterfinal berth in
Group D, but Egypt got the nod by

scoring one more goal overall than the
U.S. The Americans finished with a 1-1-
1 record.
Unlike Durgan, who hopes to make
soccer a more popular sport in the U.S.,
Manfred Bockenfeld of the West Ger
man team is playing the most popular
sport in his country. The 24-year-old
native of Dusseldorf has been playing the
game for 16 of those years, four of them
as a professional.
Asked what he liked best about the
United States, Bockenfeld replied, "The
girls," but he hasn't seen much more
than the Stanford campus. He said he
dislikes the security, but understands the
need for it.
Because of the language barrier,
Bockenfeld said he rarely spoke to
players from other teams. He also
echoed Durgan, saying, "It's hard to be
friends and play against each other."
The West German team curfew was
not as strict as the Americans', being as
late as 1 a.m. on the night after a game.
The West Germans also got into the
community, roadtripping to Marine
World, for example, last Thursday. The
excursion may have helped the team's
on-field performance, as the West Ger
mans rebounded from a 1-0 loss to Brazil
by blasting Saudi Arabia last Friday, 6-0.
Though Bockenfeld is a star in West
Germany, he said, "This is the high point
of my career, to play in the Olympics."
Jeff Durgan, a defender on the U.S.
Olympic Soccer Team, had said at the
beginning of the Games here that the
American players were out to sell this
country on soccer. But a combination of
nationwide disinterest by both sports
fans and ABC Television caused them to
come up short of their goal.
"People treated our victory against
Costa Rica as a 'So what?' They failed to
realize that the 1 Inited States hadn't won
an Olympic soccer game in 60 years,"
said Durgan. Though impressed by the
turnout at S T inford Siadium, he was dis
appointe i by the lack of television
coverage. "ABC doesn't realize we're
U.S. Olympians," he said.
Durgan, a 22-year-old native of
Tacoma, Wash., has been playing soccer
since he was eight He was drafted by the
New York Cosmos of the North Ameri
can Soccer League straight out of high
school.
Ail but four of the 17 players on the
American team are professionals, a
result of a rule change by the Federation
Internationale de Football Association,
the sport's governing body, allowing
anyone except players with World Cup
experience to play in the Olympics.
Asked how he related to players from
the other teams living in Branner Hall
during the Games here, Durgan replied,
"Soccer is not a sport like gymnastics

where you're just competing against a
judge. It involves a lot of brutality be
tween the players. It's hard to kick a man
one minute and then eat dinner with him
the next."
Durgan added that his priority with
the other American team members was
to act as hosts to the foreign teams and
make them feel as much at home as pos
sible. Though he did not go out of his
way to converse with the members of the
other teams, he says he was polite and
hospitable.
The U.S. Olympic Soccer Team is
made up of players from around the
country. "Guys I used to play against
with the Cosmos are now on the same
team as I am," Durgan said. Overall, the
members of the team seemed to get
along really well, even though they had
only been playing together for three
weeks before the Games.
As he waved to the security helicopter
circling overhead, Durgan commented
that he didn't mind the tight security —
in fact he largely approved of it.
The American team had an early 10
p.m. curfew. Durgan, however, said he
sometimes stayed out later, since playing
pingpong and Atari games in Branner
could get boring. "I know my own limita
tions, and since I'm a professional, I
would never do anything that I feel
would hurt my performance on the field,
like staying out until three in the morn

ing," Durgan said. He said walking
around the campus at night was his usual
activity.
Durgan took the Olympic Oath on be
half of all the players during the Opening
Ceremonies here. He said it was merely a
case of someone being needed and he
being in the right place. "I'm just glad I
did better than Edwin Moses," he said,
laughing, in reference to the American
gold medal hurdler who forgot the Oath
in Los Angeles the day before.
When the Olympics finish Sunday,
Durgan plans to return to his home in
New Jersey with his wife and continue
his career with the Cosmos. Durgan said
that he does not want to be a profes
sional coach when he retires. He thinks
the way to make soccer popular in this
country is through children, and he
would like to work with them. Before
that, though, he is planning on playing on
the U.S. National Team that will try to
qualify for the 1986 World Cup.
