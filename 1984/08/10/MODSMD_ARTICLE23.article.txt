There are two types of people
who dine at expensive restau
rants: those who can afford it
and those who really can't. The
who can are the ones who
should probably think about La
Tour.
The food is top quality classic
and nouvelle French cuisine thai
is beautifully presented. But
though the restaurant enjoys the
honor of being located on the
third floor of Palo Alto's only
highrise, the restaurant lacks the
kind of personality that would
make it memorable enough for
the once in a blue moon splurge.
Perhaps this will change soon.
The maitre d' is brand new and
may try to make a strong mark.
The restaurant serves about 40
dinners on a weekend night in a
very elegant manner, but the
personal attention was not the
kind you might expect. No one
came through to discuss your
meal or to meet the patrons.
Enough on the weaker points.
The food is definitely first-rate
at La Tour. Not only are the
sauces correct and the quality
high, but the arrangement and
the range of selections on the
menu show a lot of finesse.
A famous restaurant with a
similar name is La Tour
d'Argent which also has a view
over a city. To its advantage, the
city is Paris and maybe Palo
Alto could never recreate that
kind of elegance. But to some
extent "the tower" in Palo Alto

does try. The large windows of
fer a nice backdrop as the sun
sets.
The first very French detail is
the bottle of imported French
water that sits on every table.
Our waiter never asked if we
wanted it, but I'm sure we
would have been charged if we
did. It's the same in France.
The menu is a huge leather
bound work featuring more
than 50 a la carte selections.
Though the restaurant is very
francais, small allowances are
made for ignorant Americans.
For example, the salad comes
before the main dish; and so you
don't get confused the main
dishes are labelled entrees,
despite the fact that this means
the first course on a true French
menu.
For hors d'oeuvres we chose
the Moules, Crevettes au Gratin
($5.50) and Truite Fumee Gav
roche ($5.50). The mussels and
shrimp were served in a cream
and white wine sauce that was
delicious with just a light touch
of cheese flavor. This is a rather
rich first course that makes a
perfect prelude to a lighter
meal. The trout was firm and
very lightly smoked. It was not
salty like you might expect, and
was served with walnuts.
From the salades section, we
chose the limestone lettuce
salad ($3.50) and the Coeur
d'Artichaut aux Crevettes
($6.50). The second salad was a
standout primarily because of
the creativity and freshness of
its presentation. The shrimp and
artichoke hearts were served in
a light dressing and surrounded

by blueberries. The blueberries
are the type of pleasant surprise
that marks the chefs prepara
tion.
Perhaps we should have
asked to come back for the main
course the next night, but we
forged on. The entree section
featured choices such as duck
ling with kumquat sauce and
green peppers ($14.00), steak
tartare ($14.00), and seasonal
fresh vegetables ($9.50). The
poissons selections include
broiled prawns with tomatoes
($16.00), and lobster (market
price).
We chose Tournedos
Perigourdine ($16.00) and
Cuisses de Grenouilles,
Provencale ($14.75). The steak

was thick and tender and the
truffle sauce was good. Still, you
may regret ordering something
even this conventional when the
other choices are so numerous.
The frog legs were piled fairly
high and the combination of
herbs and garlic added just the
right amount of flavor.
Maxime, the chef at La Tour,
was obviously well-trained. Un
fortunately, we didn't notice
that to sample one of his dessert
specialties, souffle, one has to
order it 45 minutes in advance.
We had chocolate mousse in
stead. Though we were going to
split it, the waiter brought two.
It was a nice touch and he said
he tries to make dinners at La
Tour special. The mousse was
rich and a liqueur flavor could

be detected over the chocolate.
During all this feasting we
watched the sun setting over the
hills behind Stanford and could
see the flow of traffic on Uni
versity Avenue. Inside the res
taurant a beautiful wood bar
with green plants on top set a
light but elegant tone. Several
other plants and a huge antique
grandfather clock which dates
back over a hundred years from
Germany are also nice. The
overall effect is very impressive.
If you want a second opinion
about the place, get ahold of a
U.S. Olympic soccer player.
Apparently the whole team ate
at La Tour recently, and it was a
big success.
