# Napa wines blend tradition and technology
## 
### 
A modern Californian winery with computer tech
nology and a vast array of sophisticated machines can
make wine-making look like a complicated affair better
left to the winery technicians.
Despite the high technology currently in vogue,
making wine remains a simple operation. The science
of wine-making is a recent development in the long his
tory of wine. And whatever the technology that has
evolved, producing premium wines is more art than sci
ence.
The quality of wine grapes is what determines the
quality of the wine to a large extent. The Napa Valley
among other areas in California has an excellent
climate and soil for raising wine grapes. But even within
Napa there is big difference between good vineyards
and exceptional vineyards. The best wines (often
marked 'reserve') come from a small number of select
vineyards within Napa.
A potentially classic year for wine can easily be
ruined by picking grapes at the wrong time. The key
factor in determining if the grapes are ready for picking
is the sugar-level. Around harvest time, grapes are sub
ject to unexpected rises in sugar-levels. Most reputable
wineries send out staff members to check the grapes on
a daily basis.
"Harvest is a tricky time," said Ted Edwards, assis
tant wine master at Rutherford Hill Winery. "If the
grapes aren't picked at the right time, the quality of the
wine will suffer."
To complicate matters further, each variety of wine
ripens differently , according to Edwards. Merlot, a va
riety most commonly used in the blending of Cabernet
Sauvignon, is temperamental. "Merlot tends to stay at
one "level of ripeness and then suddenly shoot up." In
addition, different sections of the vineyard may ripen
more quickly than others, said Edwards.
Besides the sugar, the overall ripeness of the grape is
an important consideration, according to Tony Bell,
Director of Operations for Beaulieu Vineryards.
Grapes are usually picked before the peak sugar level is
attained, said Bell. This ensures an "optimally ripe"
fruit which contains the right sugar/acid ratio.
After picking, the grapes are brought in huge gon
dolas to the wineries. The gondolas should be cleaned
after delivering each load of grapes, Bell said. Such
precautions prevent oxidation and browning of the
grapes.
; port arrival at the winery, the grapes are placed in
Initio crushers which separate the seeds from the juice.

At this point the grape juice destined to produce red
wine undergoes a different process from the juice which
will produce white wine. It's a little-known fact that the
color of a wine is not controlled by the color of the
grape. The juice from both white grapes and from red
grapes is colorless.
The length of time that the skins are left to sit with
the juice determines the color of the wine. The juice of
a white grape can turn red if left with the skins long
enough. Rose wines are usually created by allowing
white grapes to sit with the skins for a short period of
time. Conversely, the juice of a red grape can be used
to produce a white wine like Sauvignon Blanc.
With red wines, fermentation begins when the juice is
exposed to the skins. Grape bunches, fresh off the vine,

appear to be covered with a film of dust. This is actually
a coating of must. The must contains a natural yeast
which initiates fermentation. The alcohol generated by
fermentation is the substance that leaches the blood
red color from the stems and the skins. The tartness of
red wine is a quality it picks up from the stems. In most
modern wineries, fermentation is started by the man
made yeasts which are added to the grapes. "In gen
eral, reds are fermented for periods of between four to
seven days, and the juice is left with the skins for a
week," said Thomas Hobbs, an oenologist (winemaker)
for the Robert Mondavi Winery. After allowing the fer
mented wine to drain, "They press the skins to release
any juices that may have been absorbed."
The wine is then transferred to huge vats in which the
dead yeast and other sediment settles at the bottom.
This process is known as racking. "We perform a series
of rackings to get rid of most of the sediment," said
Hobbs.
To make white wine the juice is separated from the
skins after crushing. Before fermentation starts the
skins are pressed. Whites also undergo a process of
filtration to ensure a totally clear and sediment-free
finished product. "To get the heavier solids out racking
is used," Hobbs said.
Finally, the wine is yeasted and fermentation begins.
"A dry white wine is done at cooler temperature and a

sweet wine is made at a warmer temperature," Bell
stated. For whites, the average period of fermentation
lasts between 10 and 20 days.
The racking process removes only part of the
"rougher edges" of a wine. The harsh substances that
remain are removed by a process known as fining.
Fining eliminates overly strong tastes created by tan
nins and other proteins. "It gives you the opportunity
to fine-tune the wine," said Bell. There are many dif
ferent ways of fining and one of the more common
methods involves the use of eggs. "The egg is put in
with the fermented juice and is left there until it has
removed the right amount of tannic acid," he said.
Fining is performed two or three times.
Fining is an art which is gauged by the wine master's
palate rather than any instruments. Periodic tastings
prevent disastrous consequences that can ruin a wine.
"You can over-fine a wine and strip it of its body."
After racking, the wine is ready to sit in a vat or a bar
rel. Wineries that deal in premium wines age their best
wines in oak barrels. They will not settle for any old
barrel, but insist on French oak barrels. Rutherford
Hill's winemaker Phil Baxter is adamant about them.
"There is no way to counterfeit the beautifully subtle
complexities that develop in wine during traditional
barrel aging," he declared.
During oak-barrel aging, the wine takes on the oak
flavor of the barrel. This balances the fruity flavor of
the grape with the oak of the barrel.
It also gives a strong-bodied young wine a chance to
mellow. The best wines are aged for a considerable per
iod of time before bottling. Just how long they are aged
depends on the tastings conducted by the winemaster
and the standards of the winery.
After the initial aging, the wine is ready for bottling.
The better wineries age their wines in the bottle before
releasing them to the public.
Throughout the process, the winemaster is solely re
sponsible for creating the style of wine he desires. He
relies on chemical analysis of the wine as well as tas
tings at every stage of production to determine how far
along the wine has come and what, if anything, needs to
be done to achieve "bottled gold." Ultimately, "the
tastings are more important than the chemical analy
sis," said Edwards of Rutherford Hill. "We try to
create a nice balance with no rough edges. We are al
ways looking for continuity of style, but this is difficult
because it depends on the grapes."
