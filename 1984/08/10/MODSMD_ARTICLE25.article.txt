On the way to the restaurant
Larry: Hey there's the Palo Alto Hyatt
up ahead on the right. We better figure
out what "ecco" means. I bet people are
going to want to know about this place.
Do you know what it means?
Alex: "Here it is."
L: No, I already know where we are;
don't worry, I won't miss the entrance to
the Hyatt. I want to know what "ecco"
means in Italian.
A: I just told you. Roughly translated,
ecco means "here it is" in Italian. Do you
understand?
L: Never mind. Let's go eat.
At the restaurant
L: I bet this place is going to be very
crowded when the Olympic soccer games
start at Stanford. Who knows, maybe the
Italian team will eat here after training.
A: I don't think they'll go to any restau
rants after they taste the gourmet cuisine
of University Food Services.
L: Hey, look at the Italian flag over
there.
A: What you are pointing at appears to
be nothing more than a large batch of
homemade tagliatelle pasta heaped on

top of a counter.
L: But the colors of the pasta are red,
white and green; exactly like that flag I
saw in the Fellini movie we saw the other
night. That's Italian!
A: Hmmm. Well, let's be seated.
They are shown to their table
A: I like our table. It's cozy, secluded,
elegant and appealing. It would be a
great place to bring a date. Although, in
your case that would be almost
impossible.
L: Hu, hu, hu, funny. Well, I don't agree.
A: Come on, Larry. Last time you went
out was after winning that Win A Date
for charity raffle.
L: No, I'm talking about our table. This
place is a bit hotelish — just take a look
at the green rug, the bland decor and all
those people sitting around the piano.
These padded seats look like the inside
of a van. Besides I can't stand that song.
A: Well, maybe "As Time Goes By" is not
as popular as "Sapore di sale" is in Italy,
but as far as the sofas are concerned, I
think they are comfortable and add to
the cozy atmosphere.
Waiter: Good evening gentlemen.
L: We'd like to order some appetizers.
A: Italian dinners start with antipasto, so
that's what I'll have.
L: The fried calamari ($2.95) sounds
good. I'll have that.
(Food arrives)

A: The antipasto ($2.95) looks great. It's
got salami, olives, cheese, peppers, pros
ciutto and coppa.
L: The calamari I ordered are excellent.
The squid are tender, but perhaps the
chef should have used a little less batter
when frying them.
A: Well, my dish is better than I ex
pected. The salami and the prosciutto
remind me of the time I spent in Parma.
L: What the heck is in Parma?
A: Besides prosciutto and cheese, Parma
is famous for its bellissime ragazze.
L: Oh, of course. Well, uh, why don't we
order the next dish.
Should we order a pasta or a meat dish?
A: Let's get both. First a pasta dish, what
the Italians call primo. After that, a main
course for a secundo.
L: But pasta is a main dish here. If we eat
two main courses we won't fit into the
VW. Maybe we can share a dish of pasta.
A: Yeah, let's split an order of pasta car
bonara ($7.50).
The pasta carbonara arrives
L: You're right, Alex. This is a beauti
fully prepared dish. The home-made
noodles, the ham and the creamy sauce
make a great combination. I bet the
other pastas are just as delicious.
A. Will a bottle of Frascati ($10.50)
satisfy Your Excellency's demanding
taste?
L: Yes, in fact a white Italian wine will go

nicely with the petrali sole I plan to or
der. I must admit the wine list has a wide
selection.
A: I think I'll have the veal scallopini.
The main course arrives
L: Eccoli\ My petrali sole sauteed in
butter, steamed veggies and fresh
lemons.
L: Here comes your veal. I have to say
I'm impressed by the service in this
place.
A: At times, we have had three waiters
serving us simultaneously. If only the one
with the pony tail would stay long
enough to . . . naaaa.
L: Look! It's Mr. Garlic Bread. There,
hiding in the basket.
A: Strange that we did not notice it
before. It has this wounderful red stuff
that looks like paprika, and it's delicious.
L: The fish is divine.
A: Just like the wine and my veal
scallopini. This nice thick cut of veal
would cost you a bag full of lire in Italy.
L: You know, I like this place: The food
is superb, the prices are reasonable and
the joint is OK.
A: 00000 here she comes . . .
The check arrives
A: She is a — let's see . . . the check
comes to around $50 — not bad for a
four-course banquet with wine, coffee
and the works.

course for a secundo.
L: But pasta is a main dish here. If we eat
two main courses we won't fit into the
VW. Maybe we can share a dish of pasta.
A: Yeah, let's split an order of pasta car
bonara ($7.50).
The pasta carbonara arrives
L: You're right, Alex. This is a beauti
fully prepared dish. The home-made
noodles, the ham and the creamy sauce
make a great combination. I bet the
other pastas are just as delicious.
A. Will a bottle of Frascati ($10.50)
satisfy Your Excellency's demanding
taste?
L: Yes, in fact a white Italian wine will go

nicely with the petrali sole I plan to or
der. I must admit the wine list has a wide
selection.
A: I think I'll have the veal scallopini.
The main course arrives
L: Eccoli\ My petrali sole sauteed in
butter, steamed veggies and fresh
lemons.
L: Here comes your veal. I have to say
I'm impressed by the service in this
place.
A: At times, we have had three waiters
serving us simultaneously. If only the one
with the pony tail would stay long
enough to . . . naaaa.
L: Look! It's Mr. Garlic Bread. There,
hiding in the basket.
A: Strange that we did not notice it
before. It has this wounderful red stuff
that looks like paprika, and it's delicious.
L: The fish is divine.
A: Just like the wine and my veal
scallopini. This nice thick cut of veal
would cost you a bag full of lire in Italy.
L: You know, I like this place: The food
is superb, the prices are reasonable and
the joint is OK.
A: 00000 here she comes . . .
The check arrives
A: She is a — let's see . . . the check
comes to around $50 — not bad for a
four-course banquet with wine, coffee
and the works.

On the way to the restaurant
Larry: Hey there's the Palo Alto Hyatt
up ahead on the right. We better figure
out what "ecco" means. I bet people are
going to want to know about this place.
Do you know what it means?
Alex: "Here it is."
L: No, I already know where we are;
don't worry, I won't miss the entrance to
the Hyatt. I want to know what "ecco"
means in Italian.
A: I just told you. Roughly translated,
ecco means "here it is" in Italian. Do you
understand?
L: Never mind. Let's go eat.
At the restaurant
L: I bet this place is going to be very
crowded when the Olympic soccer games
start at Stanford. Who knows, maybe the
Italian team will eat here after training.
A: I don't think they'll go to any restau
rants after they taste the gourmet cuisine
of University Food Services.
L: Hey, look at the Italian flag over
there.
A: What you are pointing at appears to
be nothing more than a large batch of
homemade tagliatelle pasta heaped on

top of a counter.
L: But the colors of the pasta are red,
white and green; exactly like that flag I
saw in the Fellini movie we saw the other
night. That's Italian!
A: Hmmm. Well, let's be seated.
They are shown to their table
A: I like our table. It's cozy, secluded,
elegant and appealing. It would be a
great place to bring a date. Although, in
your case that would be almost
impossible.
L: Hu, hu, hu, funny. Well, I don't agree.
A: Come on, Larry. Last time you went
out was after winning that Win A Date
for charity raffle.
L: No, I'm talking about our table. This
place is a bit hotelish — just take a look
at the green rug, the bland decor and all
those people sitting around the piano.
These padded seats look like the inside
of a van. Besides I can't stand that song.
A: Well, maybe "As Time Goes By" is not
as popular as "Sapore di sale" is in Italy,
but as far as the sofas are concerned, I
think they are comfortable and add to
the cozy atmosphere.
Waiter: Good evening gentlemen.
L: We'd like to order some appetizers.
A: Italian dinners start with antipasto, so
that's what I'll have.
L: The fried calamari ($2.95) sounds
good. I'll have that.
(Food arrives)

A: The antipasto ($2.95) looks great. It's
got salami, olives, cheese, peppers, pros
ciutto and coppa.
L: The calamari I ordered are excellent.
The squid are tender, but perhaps the
chef should have used a little less batter
when frying them.
A: Well, my dish is better than I ex
pected. The salami and the prosciutto
remind me of the time I spent in Parma.
L: What the heck is in Parma?
A: Besides prosciutto and cheese, Parma
is famous for its bellissime ragazze.
L: Oh, of course. Well, uh, why don't we
order the next dish.
Should we order a pasta or a meat dish?
A: Let's get both. First a pasta dish, what
the Italians call primo. After that, a main
course for a secundo.
L: But pasta is a main dish here. If we eat
two main courses we won't fit into the
VW. Maybe we can share a dish of pasta.
A: Yeah, let's split an order of pasta car
bonara ($7.50).
