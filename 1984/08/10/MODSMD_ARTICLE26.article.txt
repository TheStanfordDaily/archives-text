## Theater workshop presents quality, variety 
### BILL MARTIN 
Just before the 5 p.m. rush, as
the sandstone reaches its highest
temperature, you can walk be
hind Mem. Aud. and relax.
A warm wind blows between
Frost Amphitheater and the
solid walls of the Business
School. If you sit back and enjoy
it on the steps behind Mem.
Aud., you can also hear faint
voices dancing on the wind . . .
"Come sweet death, strike
your final blow . .
"Sound excited: this is the
first time he has said anything
that you've really wanted to
hear . .
"How peculiar, how bizarre
and how very strange, he has a
daughter that lives at . .
"I think it is quite possible
that we have the same daughter
"But I don't recall it sir . .
"Scream it. loud! . .
"You stand over stage left
and look right at him . .
"O.K. Let s try it again . .
"Camden. We're here . .
"Arthur, where is your hat
"How are you Beulah. Last
time 1 saw you . .
"Great. We'll rehearse it all
together next time at . . ."
The Drama Department
hides behind its central
showcase at Memorial
Auditorium as if to show the
University first what its purpose
is, and then who the people
working toward it are.
This summer one can hear the
sounds of the Stanford Summer
Theater Workshop, instead of
the sounds of rehearsing
gaieties, rewriting one-acts or
memorizing Shakespeare's
Hamlet. Like the offices of the

Drama Department, it is one of
Stanford's best-hidden theatri
cal treasures.
It is 12:10 on a Thursday af
ternoon and a chatting crowd
sits on risers in a seating area
smaller than the stage below, as
they munch on their brown bag

lunches, and study the newest
set before them. Some have
sped from Foothill College on
their lunch break and some have
wandered in from their Palo
Alto businesses. But most who
have gathered in the Nitery this
noon hour are part of Stanford's

regular staff of clerical workers
and administrators who spend
the summer months preparing
for the onslaught of a new
school year. They have come to
see their old summer lunchtime
friends, a troupe of players
ready to present their work of

the week.
The lights dim. All chatter
dies, and people lean forward in
their folding chairs in an at
tempt to see whafs in the dark
ness before them. Wondering
how the actors ever found their
way on stage, they watch the
lights go up to expose an expert
mood, set by the workshop's
lighting designer.
A woman chatters aimlessly
and irrelevantly. The audience
tries to understand what she is
saying as she cocks her head to
the random ringing of a broken
grandfather clock. Something
seems to be missing from the
dialogue.
An energetic maid dramati
cally pops in to interpret the
play for the audience, but fails
to make any more sense than
the couple on the couch. The
maid yells at two visitors at the
door as the couple abandons the
room, and a new pair — a late
visiting couple enter. They take
10 minutes to rediscover that
they are married.
The original couple re-enters
and the conversation turns from
total nonsense to philosophical
nonsense. A random fireman
enters, shows that he is having
an affair with the maid, then
proceeds to tell plotless stories.
Finally, the frustrated audi
ence is left to try and figure out
a sensible story from the wide
range of emotions coming from
the players. They realize the
missing element from the
dialogue is meaning — some
thing lonesco's "Bald Soprano"
proves to be vital in even the
most nonsensical world.
Dawn McMahan's wonderful
performance as the maid was
only an overture to her perfor
