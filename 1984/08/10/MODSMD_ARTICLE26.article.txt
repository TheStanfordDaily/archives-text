## Theater workshop presents quality, variety 
### BILL MARTIN 
Just before the 5 p.m. rush, as
the sandstone reaches its highest
temperature, you can walk be
hind Mem. Aud. and relax.
A warm wind blows between
Frost Amphitheater and the
solid walls of the Business
School. If you sit back and enjoy
it on the steps behind Mem.
Aud., you can also hear faint
voices dancing on the wind . . .
"Come sweet death, strike
your final blow . .
"Sound excited: this is the
first time he has said anything
that you've really wanted to
hear . .
"How peculiar, how bizarre
and how very strange, he has a
daughter that lives at . .
"I think it is quite possible
that we have the same daughter
"But I don't recall it sir . .
"Scream it. loud! . .
"You stand over stage left
and look right at him . .
"O.K. Let s try it again . .
"Camden. We're here . .
"Arthur, where is your hat
"How are you Beulah. Last
time 1 saw you . .
"Great. We'll rehearse it all
together next time at . . ."
The Drama Department
hides behind its central
showcase at Memorial
Auditorium as if to show the
University first what its purpose
is, and then who the people
working toward it are.
This summer one can hear the
sounds of the Stanford Summer
Theater Workshop, instead of
the sounds of rehearsing
gaieties, rewriting one-acts or
memorizing Shakespeare's
Hamlet. Like the offices of the

Drama Department, it is one of
Stanford's best-hidden theatri
cal treasures.
It is 12:10 on a Thursday af
ternoon and a chatting crowd
sits on risers in a seating area
smaller than the stage below, as
they munch on their brown bag

lunches, and study the newest
set before them. Some have
sped from Foothill College on
their lunch break and some have
wandered in from their Palo
Alto businesses. But most who
have gathered in the Nitery this
noon hour are part of Stanford's

regular staff of clerical workers
and administrators who spend
the summer months preparing
for the onslaught of a new
school year. They have come to
see their old summer lunchtime
friends, a troupe of players
ready to present their work of

the week.
The lights dim. All chatter
dies, and people lean forward in
their folding chairs in an at
tempt to see whafs in the dark
ness before them. Wondering
how the actors ever found their
way on stage, they watch the
lights go up to expose an expert
mood, set by the workshop's
lighting designer.
A woman chatters aimlessly
and irrelevantly. The audience
tries to understand what she is
saying as she cocks her head to
the random ringing of a broken
grandfather clock. Something
seems to be missing from the
dialogue.
An energetic maid dramati
cally pops in to interpret the
play for the audience, but fails
to make any more sense than
the couple on the couch. The
maid yells at two visitors at the
door as the couple abandons the
room, and a new pair — a late
visiting couple enter. They take
10 minutes to rediscover that
they are married.
The original couple re-enters
and the conversation turns from
total nonsense to philosophical
nonsense. A random fireman
enters, shows that he is having
an affair with the maid, then
proceeds to tell plotless stories.
Finally, the frustrated audi
ence is left to try and figure out
a sensible story from the wide
range of emotions coming from
the players. They realize the
missing element from the
dialogue is meaning — some
thing lonesco's "Bald Soprano"
proves to be vital in even the
most nonsensical world.

The summer theater workshop is one of the University's best-hidden theatrical treasures.
mance the following week in the
Workshop's 40-minute adapta
tion of Shakespeare's 150-
minute "A Midsummer's Night
Dream." Although the most
amazing aspect of the show was
Johanna Dickey's expert editing
and staging of the
Shakespearean classic, the
seven dancing actors switching
from part to part stole the scene.
McMahan is joined by Keenen
Brown and five others who
dance, sing and chase each other
around the stage.They speak
complicated verse easily, bounc
ing a comedy of misplaced love
potions, malicious spells and
muffed skits off a fully involved
and roaring audience.
Drama Professor Doug Rus
sell oversees the productions,
which were originally created to
provide serious actors and stage
technicians with a chance to
perform some of the more inno
vative and modern plays of our
time. Most are short enough to
be presented over 'imch while
Stanford closes down to eat.
This summer, however, the
18 performers and their crew
are presenting innovative
theater drawn from established
works. The directors — a differ
ent graduate student for each
presentation — have taken on

each individual performance as
an academic project. Some have
written classics, including
Wilder and Marlowe, and some
have adapted full-length
productions from Shakespeare
and lonesco.
The actors' devotion insures a
successful performance. Each
weekday is spent making stage
movement exercises and then
learning the basics of play act
ing in class. The afternoon is
spent rehearsing for the next
performance. Four plays will be
presented this summer at noon
from Wednesday to Friday and
at 8 p.m. on Friday and Satur
day in the Nitery at Old Union.
This week, Director Todd
Salovey has asked the actors to
create a scene which brings the
audience back to the informal
relaxed days of the '20s in
Wilder's "Journey to Trenton
and Camden."
Ma Kirby, who is played con
vincingly by Bea Schmid, says
goodbye to the the audience
through an imaginary window.
Arthur, another star from the
first show, pulls up his trousers
and leans on the floor playing
marbles rather than finding his
hat for the motor car trip.
Caroline (Betsy Wertheimer,
who crossed sexes to become
the random fireman in the first

show) is a sweet young daughter
in this play, insisting on keeping
up with her New Jersey
girlfriends who rub their cheeks
to look good and rouged in
public. Her sheepish smiles at
her father Elmer (Gregory Hoff
man) seem to give the audience
a particular fondness for her,
though she has few lines sitting
in the front seat of the bouncing
car on its way to Camden.
In Camden, Sabrina Saint-
Denis plays sister Beulah, who
is recovering from an illness.
By the time you leave this
play, the '20s are yesterday, and
the feelings of being eight years
old, with a mom who lives
forever, are right inside your
heart.
Next week, Marlowe's
"Doctor Faustus" will be pre
sented by the Workshop as a
finale to a summer of hard
work. All 18 actors and a full
crew will appe-i r n the final ef
fort.
Until then, if you want to lean
back and rest, tc the shade of
the area back behind Mem.
Aud. If the warm wind and
swaying leaves of the Drama
Department's hidden center
doesn't relax you, the floating
rehearsal lines of Doctor
Faustus will.

It is 12:10 on a Thursday af
ternoon and a chatting crowd
sits on risers in a seating area
smaller than the stage below, as
they munch on their brown bag

lunches, and study the newest
set before them. Some have
sped from Foothill College on
their lunch break and some have
wandered in from their Palo
Alto businesses. But most who
have gathered in the Nitery this
noon hour are part of Stanford's

regular staff of clerical workers
and administrators who spend
the summer months preparing
for the onslaught of a new
school year. They have come to
see their old summer lunchtime
friends, a troupe of players
ready to present their work of

the week.
The lights dim. All chatter
dies, and people lean forward in
their folding chairs in an at
tempt to see whafs in the dark
ness before them. Wondering
how the actors ever found their
way on stage, they watch the
lights go up to expose an expert
mood, set by the workshop's
lighting designer.
A woman chatters aimlessly
and irrelevantly. The audience
tries to understand what she is
saying as she cocks her head to
the random ringing of a broken
grandfather clock. Something
seems to be missing from the
dialogue.
An energetic maid dramati
cally pops in to interpret the
play for the audience, but fails
to make any more sense than
the couple on the couch. The
maid yells at two visitors at the
door as the couple abandons the
room, and a new pair — a late
visiting couple enter. They take
10 minutes to rediscover that
they are married.
The original couple re-enters
and the conversation turns from
total nonsense to philosophical
nonsense. A random fireman
enters, shows that he is having
an affair with the maid, then
proceeds to tell plotless stories.
Finally, the frustrated audi
ence is left to try and figure out
a sensible story from the wide
range of emotions coming from
the players. They realize the
missing element from the
dialogue is meaning — some
thing lonesco's "Bald Soprano"
proves to be vital in even the
most nonsensical world.

The summer theater workshop is one of the University's best-hidden theatrical treasures.
mance the following week in the
Workshop's 40-minute adapta
tion of Shakespeare's 150-
minute "A Midsummer's Night
Dream." Although the most
amazing aspect of the show was
Johanna Dickey's expert editing
and staging of the
Shakespearean classic, the
seven dancing actors switching
from part to part stole the scene.
McMahan is joined by Keenen
Brown and five others who
dance, sing and chase each other
around the stage.They speak
complicated verse easily, bounc
ing a comedy of misplaced love
potions, malicious spells and
muffed skits off a fully involved
and roaring audience.
Drama Professor Doug Rus
sell oversees the productions,
which were originally created to
provide serious actors and stage
technicians with a chance to
perform some of the more inno
vative and modern plays of our
time. Most are short enough to
be presented over 'imch while
Stanford closes down to eat.
This summer, however, the
18 performers and their crew
are presenting innovative
theater drawn from established
works. The directors — a differ
ent graduate student for each
presentation — have taken on

each individual performance as
an academic project. Some have
written classics, including
Wilder and Marlowe, and some
have adapted full-length
productions from Shakespeare
and lonesco.
The actors' devotion insures a
successful performance. Each
weekday is spent making stage
movement exercises and then
learning the basics of play act
ing in class. The afternoon is
spent rehearsing for the next
performance. Four plays will be
presented this summer at noon
from Wednesday to Friday and
at 8 p.m. on Friday and Satur
day in the Nitery at Old Union.
This week, Director Todd
Salovey has asked the actors to
create a scene which brings the
audience back to the informal
relaxed days of the '20s in
Wilder's "Journey to Trenton
and Camden."
Ma Kirby, who is played con
vincingly by Bea Schmid, says
goodbye to the the audience
through an imaginary window.
Arthur, another star from the
first show, pulls up his trousers
and leans on the floor playing
marbles rather than finding his
hat for the motor car trip.
Caroline (Betsy Wertheimer,
who crossed sexes to become
the random fireman in the first

show) is a sweet young daughter
in this play, insisting on keeping
up with her New Jersey
girlfriends who rub their cheeks
to look good and rouged in
public. Her sheepish smiles at
her father Elmer (Gregory Hoff
man) seem to give the audience
a particular fondness for her,
though she has few lines sitting
in the front seat of the bouncing
car on its way to Camden.
In Camden, Sabrina Saint-
Denis plays sister Beulah, who
is recovering from an illness.
By the time you leave this
play, the '20s are yesterday, and
the feelings of being eight years
old, with a mom who lives
forever, are right inside your
heart.
Next week, Marlowe's
"Doctor Faustus" will be pre
sented by the Workshop as a
finale to a summer of hard
work. All 18 actors and a full
crew will appe-i r n the final ef
fort.
Until then, if you want to lean
back and rest, tc the shade of
the area back behind Mem.
Aud. If the warm wind and
swaying leaves of the Drama
Department's hidden center
doesn't relax you, the floating
rehearsal lines of Doctor
Faustus will.

Just before the 5 p.m. rush, as
the sandstone reaches its highest
temperature, you can walk be
hind Mem. Aud. and relax.
A warm wind blows between
Frost Amphitheater and the
solid walls of the Business
School. If you sit back and enjoy
it on the steps behind Mem.
Aud., you can also hear faint
voices dancing on the wind . . .
"Come sweet death, strike
your final blow . .
"Sound excited: this is the
first time he has said anything
that you've really wanted to
hear . .
"How peculiar, how bizarre
and how very strange, he has a
daughter that lives at . .
"I think it is quite possible
that we have the same daughter
"But I don't recall it sir . .
"Scream it. loud! . .
"You stand over stage left
and look right at him . .
"O.K. Let s try it again . .
"Camden. We're here . .
"Arthur, where is your hat
"How are you Beulah. Last
time 1 saw you . .
"Great. We'll rehearse it all
together next time at . . ."
The Drama Department
hides behind its central
showcase at Memorial
Auditorium as if to show the
University first what its purpose
is, and then who the people
working toward it are.
This summer one can hear the
sounds of the Stanford Summer
Theater Workshop, instead of
the sounds of rehearsing
gaieties, rewriting one-acts or
memorizing Shakespeare's
Hamlet. Like the offices of the

Drama Department, it is one of
Stanford's best-hidden theatri
