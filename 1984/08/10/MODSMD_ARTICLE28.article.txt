The Big Sleep (1946)
Festival, Palo Alto
Raymond Chandler's slick,
fast-paced detective novel pales
beside this film version, directed
by Howard Hawks and featuring
dialogue by William Faulkner,
Jules Furthman and Leigh
Brackett. The plot is tied in
knots no one has ever succeeded
in untangling; the story goes that
when the screenwriters ran into
trouble, they called Chandler up
and he couldn't figure the damn
thing out either But the prepos
terous tortuousness of the story
is as much a part of the fun as the
double entendres between
Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and
Martha Vickers' turn as Bacall's
infantile, lascivious kid sister.
Bogart's impersonation of
Chandler's private eye hero
Philip Marlowe may not have
met Chandler's standards
(inexplicably, he preferred Dick
Powell in Murder, My Sweet),
but no one else has ever com
plained.
Plays through Wednesday
with To Have and Have Not.

To Have and Have Not
(1944)
Festival, Palo Alto
Warner Brothers bought the
title of an Ernest Hemingway
novella, but the crackling Jules
Furthman-William Faulkner
script has virtually nothing to do
with the book. In this first of
four movies Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall made to
gether, she teaches him how to
whistle and seems far too sexy to
turn into the dried-up, strident
trouper she would become after
his death. They play together
marvelously in this immensely
enjoyable romantic adventure
melodrama, superbly crafted by
Howard Hawks and co-starring
Walter Brennan, Hoagy Carmic
hael, Sheldon Leonard, Dolores
Moran, Dan Seymour and even
Marcel Dalio (of Renoir's Grand
Illusion and Rules of the Game).
Plays through Wednesday
with The Big Sleep.
Thunderball (1965)
Memorial Auditorium
Not the best of the James
Bonds, but very entertaining.
You can tell who works for
whom in the climactic under
water combat because the good
guys wear green scuba suits and
the bad guys wear black. Sean
Connery's adversary is Adolfo
Celi, and his women are
Claudine Auger and Luciana
Paluzzi. Terence Young di
rected, from a script by Richard
Maibaum and John Hopkins.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.
Children of Paradise (1945)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Perhaps the most beloved
"art" film of all time — at least
in this country. The setting is
Paris in the early 19th century;
the characters are actors and
mimes; the theme is the relation
ship between life and art. Jean-
Louis Barrault plays Baptiste
Deburau, the mime; the incom
parable beauty Arletty is
Garance, whom he adores;
Pierre Brasseur is Lemaitre,
whose mistress she is; and Maria
Casares is the actress who wor
ships Baptiste. They are all
splendid. Marcel Came directed,
and the poet Jacques Prevert,
Carne's frequent collaborator,
wrote the screenplay.
Plays Wednesday.
My Brilliant Career (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively
performance) is a rebellious
spirit in turn-of-the-century
rural Australia who is given a
temporary reprieve from farm
life when she is invited to visit
her wealthy, stuffy aunt. All the

other women in her family
posture and say things like
"Marriage gives us respec
tability" and"I prayed to God
for guidance," so we can see how
independent Sybylla is by com
parison; did she spring full
blown, we wonder, from this
conservative brood? This
patchwork of bits from Little
Women and The Sound of Music
and various comedies of the
19305, adapted by Eleanor
Whitcombe from Miles
Franklin's novel and directed by
Gill Armstrong, is rather clumsi
ly staged, and the role of Sybylla,
who flirts with writing and
politics and rejects the proposal
of a decent, intelligent lan
downer (Sam Neill), is puzzling,
to say the least.
Plays Tuesday with We of the
Never Never.
Gorky Park (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
As the Muscovite cop who sets
out to solve a possibly political
murder against the orders of his
superiors, William Hurt looks
like a wax figure and gives a nar
coleptic performance; he's never
seemed so dead on screen
before. But then, Michael
Apted's film of the Martin Cruz
Smith bestseller (scripted by
Dennis Potter) is a deadhead
movie. All the Russians talk in
English accents — to distinguish
them, presumably, from the
Americans (Brian Dennehy and
Lee Marvin) — and collectively
they give a stereotyped impres
sion of Soviets: loud, frontal, un
subtle, and possessing a heavy
sense of humor. Not all the Rus
sians in the movie are intended

to be unsympathetic, but the
Moscow atmosphere is so gray
and lumpy that you can't wait to
defect. (Apted's decision to
shoot close in so much of the
time adds to the claustrophobia.)
Dennehy, as a New York cop
whose brother was among the
murdered, and Joanna Pacula, as
a suspect who falls in love with
Hurt, appear to be the only
human beings in the cast, though
Dennehy's role doesn't really
make sense. (He manages to
prowl around Moscow easily,
without attracting notice — a
highly implausible notion for an
American in the Soviet Union,
one would think.) With lan Ban
nen, Michael Elphick, and
others.
Plays Thursday with The Year
of Living Dangerously.
Moscow on the Hudson
Bijou, Palo Alto
Or You Can't Go Home
Again. Robin Williams gives a
brilliant performance as a saxop
honist with a Moscow circus
playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to
defect. On one level Paul
Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos)
deals with the movement from
repression to freedom, what
freedom implies and what its
constraints and contradictions
are; on another level it's a com
edy about the seductive appeal
of American decadence for Rus
sians (like Ninotchka was); cen
trally, though, it's about what
happens to a man who makes the
choice to cut himself off from
home and family forever. When
Mazursky's in high gear, few

directors can touch him: The
whole cast (Cleavant Derricks,
Maria Conchita Alonso, Tiger
Haynes, Savely Kramarov, Elya
Baskin, Alexander Beniaminov)
is marvelous, and sometimes
Mazursky engages so many emo
tional tracks simultaneously that
you can't analyze exactly which
element is affecting you most
profoundly.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Big Chill.
The Lady Vanishes (1938)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The funniest of Alfred
Hitchcock's British movies:
Dame May Whitty chats to Mar
garet Lockwood in the dining car
of a train, then disappears;
Lockwood seeks assistance in
finding her lost friend, but no
one believes in Whitty's exis
tence — except for the dashing
hero, Michael Redgrave. The
spy story has dash, too. Sidney
Gilliat and Frank Launder
adapted a novel by Ethel Lina
White, and Paul Lukas, Basil
Radford, Naunton Wayne.
Googie Withers and others turn
up on the train in supporting
roles. A delight.
Plays today with Rear
Window.
The Big Chill (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A glib, empty movie about the
middle-aged crises of the
children of the '60s, written and
directed by Lawrence Kasdan
(Barbara Benedek collaborated
on the screenplay), in which the
jazzy montages suggest rock
videos and the musical selections
not only determine the editing

hut also define the content of
each scene. A group of college
friends learns of the suicide of
one of their number and Bathers
to mourn hiiw rc
their own lives. In this movie
about the triumph of frienu>» ,
over the scariness of the world
outside, the women are warm
and ri> UlWii.ui ft* a liitle dopey,
and the ultimate sacritice to
propagate the '60s spirit occurs
when one of them lets her hus
band sleep with her besi aiend
so that she, too, can become a
mother. Jeff Goldblum and
William Hurt give the be«t per
formances; the cast also includes
Glenn Close, Kevin Kline. Mary
Kay Place, Tom Berenger,
Jobeth Williams and Meg Tilly.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Moscow on the Hudson.
Last Tango in Paris (1973)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bernardo Bertolucci's study of
a neurotic sexual relationship
between a middle-aged man — a
one-time Bohemian whose wife
has just committed suicide —

and a young French bourgeoise
may be the greatest film of the
last 20 years. No one has ever
explored sexuality in movies in
as intimate and unrelenting a
manner. Bertolucci and Marlon
Brando, who plays the tragic
hero, are surely the most
amazing director-actor combina
tion since D. W. Griffith and Lil
lian Gish, to describe what
Brando does for this movie
would require searching for new
superlatives. With Maria
Schneider, Jean-Pierre Leaud,
Maria Michi and Massimo
Girotti; screenplay by Bertolucci
and Franco Arcalli;
photographed by Vittorio
Storaro; music by Gato Barbieri.
The 20 paintings in the opening
credits are by Francis Bacon.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with In the Realm of the Senses.
The Good Fight (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A documentary about the
Abraham Lincoln (American)
Brigade in the Spanish Civil
War, produced and directed by
Noel Buckner, Mary Dore and
Sam Sills, and narrated by Studs
Terkel. Some interesting inter
viewees, notably one Evelyn
Hutchins, who fought to be con
sidered the equal of American
men fighting in the war, and Bill
Bailey, the longshoreman who
stole Seeing Red. show up — but
it's of greater historical and
sociological than dramatic inter
est. Considering the subject, we
expect a more stirring picture
than we get.
Plays Monday.
The Dark Crystal (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Jim Henson's plot
(dramatized by David Odell)
concerns the efforts of Jen, a
"gelfling," to recover the lost
shard of an indigo-colored crys
tal that determines the power of
whoever possesses it, and thus
free the land from the tyranny of
the dreaded Skeksis. Despite all
the steals from Norse mythology
by way of Tolkien, and from The
Wizard of Oz and even The
Picture of Dorian Gray, this
muppet-populated movie lacks
the requisite magical dimension.
Some of the creatures Brian
Froud has designed are wonder
ful to watch, but the good guys
have been constructed much less
imaginatively than the monsters;
the action sequences are
claustrophobic; and the major
set pieces are visually insubstan
tial. Muppet masters Henson
and Frank Oz co-directed.
Plays tomorrow, Sunday,
Wednesday and Thursday.

Last Tango in Paris (1973)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bernardo Bertolucci's study of
a neurotic sexual relationship
between a middle-aged man — a
one-time Bohemian whose wife
has just committed suicide —

and a young French bourgeoise
may be the greatest film of the
last 20 years. No one has ever
explored sexuality in movies in
as intimate and unrelenting a
manner. Bertolucci and Marlon
Brando, who plays the tragic
hero, are surely the most
amazing director-actor combina
tion since D. W. Griffith and Lil
lian Gish, to describe what
Brando does for this movie
would require searching for new
superlatives. With Maria
Schneider, Jean-Pierre Leaud,
Maria Michi and Massimo
Girotti; screenplay by Bertolucci
and Franco Arcalli;
photographed by Vittorio
Storaro; music by Gato Barbieri.
The 20 paintings in the opening
credits are by Francis Bacon.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with In the Realm of the Senses.
The Good Fight (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A documentary about the
Abraham Lincoln (American)
Brigade in the Spanish Civil
War, produced and directed by
Noel Buckner, Mary Dore and
Sam Sills, and narrated by Studs
Terkel. Some interesting inter
viewees, notably one Evelyn
Hutchins, who fought to be con
sidered the equal of American
men fighting in the war, and Bill
Bailey, the longshoreman who
stole Seeing Red. show up — but
it's of greater historical and
sociological than dramatic inter
est. Considering the subject, we
expect a more stirring picture
than we get.
Plays Monday.
The Dark Crystal (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Jim Henson's plot
(dramatized by David Odell)
concerns the efforts of Jen, a
"gelfling," to recover the lost
shard of an indigo-colored crys
tal that determines the power of
whoever possesses it, and thus
free the land from the tyranny of
the dreaded Skeksis. Despite all
the steals from Norse mythology
by way of Tolkien, and from The
Wizard of Oz and even The
Picture of Dorian Gray, this
muppet-populated movie lacks
the requisite magical dimension.
Some of the creatures Brian
Froud has designed are wonder
ful to watch, but the good guys
have been constructed much less
imaginatively than the monsters;
the action sequences are
claustrophobic; and the major
set pieces are visually insubstan
tial. Muppet masters Henson
and Frank Oz co-directed.
Plays tomorrow, Sunday,
Wednesday and Thursday.


The Big Sleep (1946)
Festival, Palo Alto
Raymond Chandler's slick,
fast-paced detective novel pales
beside this film version, directed
by Howard Hawks and featuring
dialogue by William Faulkner,
Jules Furthman and Leigh
Brackett. The plot is tied in
knots no one has ever succeeded
in untangling; the story goes that
when the screenwriters ran into
trouble, they called Chandler up
and he couldn't figure the damn
thing out either But the prepos
terous tortuousness of the story
is as much a part of the fun as the
double entendres between
Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and
Martha Vickers' turn as Bacall's
infantile, lascivious kid sister.
Bogart's impersonation of
Chandler's private eye hero
Philip Marlowe may not have
met Chandler's standards
(inexplicably, he preferred Dick
Powell in Murder, My Sweet),
but no one else has ever com
plained.
Plays through Wednesday
with To Have and Have Not.

To Have and Have Not
(1944)
Festival, Palo Alto
Warner Brothers bought the
title of an Ernest Hemingway
novella, but the crackling Jules
Furthman-William Faulkner
script has virtually nothing to do
with the book. In this first of
four movies Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall made to
gether, she teaches him how to
whistle and seems far too sexy to
turn into the dried-up, strident
trouper she would become after
his death. They play together
marvelously in this immensely
enjoyable romantic adventure
melodrama, superbly crafted by
Howard Hawks and co-starring
Walter Brennan, Hoagy Carmic
hael, Sheldon Leonard, Dolores
Moran, Dan Seymour and even
Marcel Dalio (of Renoir's Grand
Illusion and Rules of the Game).
Plays through Wednesday

Thunderball (1965)
Memorial Auditorium
Not the best of the James
Bonds, but very entertaining.
You can tell who works for
whom in the climactic under
water combat because the good
guys wear green scuba suits and
the bad guys wear black. Sean
Connery's adversary is Adolfo
Celi, and his women are
Claudine Auger and Luciana
Paluzzi. Terence Young di

Maibaum and John Hopkins.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.
Children of Paradise (1945)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Perhaps the most beloved
"art" film of all time — at least
in this country. The setting is
Paris in the early 19th century;
the characters are actors and
mimes; the theme is the relation
ship between life and art. Jean-
Louis Barrault plays Baptiste
Deburau, the mime; the incom
parable beauty Arletty is
Garance, whom he adores;
Pierre Brasseur is Lemaitre,
whose mistress she is; and Maria
Casares is the actress who wor
ships Baptiste. They are all
splendid. Marcel Came directed,
and the poet Jacques Prevert,
Carne's frequent collaborator,
wrote the screenplay.
Plays Wednesday.
My Brilliant Career (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively
performance) is a rebellious
spirit in turn-of-the-century
rural Australia who is given a
temporary reprieve from farm
life when she is invited to visit
her wealthy, stuffy aunt. All the

other women in her family
posture and say things like
"Marriage gives us respec
tability" and"I prayed to God
for guidance," so we can see how
independent Sybylla is by com
parison; did she spring full
blown, we wonder, from this
conservative brood? This
patchwork of bits from Little
Women and The Sound of Music
and various comedies of the
19305, adapted by Eleanor
Whitcombe from Miles
Franklin's novel and directed by
Gill Armstrong, is rather clumsi
ly staged, and the role of Sybylla,
who flirts with writing and
politics and rejects the proposal
of a decent, intelligent lan
downer (Sam Neill), is puzzling,
to say the least.
Plays Tuesday with We of the
Never Never.
Gorky Park (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
As the Muscovite cop who sets
out to solve a possibly political
murder against the orders of his
superiors, William Hurt looks
like a wax figure and gives a nar
coleptic performance; he's never
seemed so dead on screen
before. But then, Michael
Apted's film of the Martin Cruz
Smith bestseller (scripted by
Dennis Potter) is a deadhead
movie. All the Russians talk in
English accents — to distinguish
them, presumably, from the
Americans (Brian Dennehy and
Lee Marvin) — and collectively
they give a stereotyped impres
sion of Soviets: loud, frontal, un
subtle, and possessing a heavy
sense of humor. Not all the Rus
sians in the movie are intended

to be unsympathetic, but the
Moscow atmosphere is so gray
and lumpy that you can't wait to
defect. (Apted's decision to
shoot close in so much of the
time adds to the claustrophobia.)
Dennehy, as a New York cop
whose brother was among the
murdered, and Joanna Pacula, as
a suspect who falls in love with
Hurt, appear to be the only
human beings in the cast, though
Dennehy's role doesn't really
make sense. (He manages to
prowl around Moscow easily,
without attracting notice — a
highly implausible notion for an
American in the Soviet Union,
one would think.) With lan Ban
nen, Michael Elphick, and
others.
Plays Thursday with The Year
of Living Dangerously.
Moscow on the Hudson
Bijou, Palo Alto
Or You Can't Go Home
Again. Robin Williams gives a
brilliant performance as a saxop
honist with a Moscow circus
playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to
defect. On one level Paul
Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos)
deals with the movement from
repression to freedom, what
freedom implies and what its
constraints and contradictions
are; on another level it's a com
edy about the seductive appeal
of American decadence for Rus
sians (like Ninotchka was); cen
trally, though, it's about what
happens to a man who makes the
choice to cut himself off from
home and family forever. When
Mazursky's in high gear, few

directors can touch him: The
whole cast (Cleavant Derricks,
Maria Conchita Alonso, Tiger
Haynes, Savely Kramarov, Elya
Baskin, Alexander Beniaminov)
is marvelous, and sometimes
Mazursky engages so many emo
tional tracks simultaneously that
you can't analyze exactly which
element is affecting you most
profoundly.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Big Chill.
The Lady Vanishes (1938)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The funniest of Alfred
Hitchcock's British movies:
Dame May Whitty chats to Mar
garet Lockwood in the dining car
of a train, then disappears;
Lockwood seeks assistance in
finding her lost friend, but no
one believes in Whitty's exis
tence — except for the dashing
hero, Michael Redgrave. The
spy story has dash, too. Sidney
Gilliat and Frank Launder
adapted a novel by Ethel Lina
White, and Paul Lukas, Basil
Radford, Naunton Wayne.
Googie Withers and others turn
up on the train in supporting
roles. A delight.
Plays today with Rear

The Big Chill (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A glib, empty movie about the
middle-aged crises of the

directed by Lawrence Kasdan

jazzy montages suggest rock
videos and the musical selections
not only determine the editing

each scene. A group of college
friends learns of the suicide of

to mourn hiiw rc

about the triumph of frienu>» ,
over the scariness of the world

and the ultimate sacritice to
propagate the '60s spirit occurs
when one of them lets her hus

are; on another level it's a com
edy about the seductive appeal
of American decadence for Rus
sians (like Ninotchka was); cen
trally, though, it's about what
happens to a man who makes the
choice to cut himself off from
home and family forever. When
Mazursky's in high gear, few

directors can touch him: The
whole cast (Cleavant Derricks,
Maria Conchita Alonso, Tiger
Haynes, Savely Kramarov, Elya
Baskin, Alexander Beniaminov)
is marvelous, and sometimes
Mazursky engages so many emo
tional tracks simultaneously that
you can't analyze exactly which
element is affecting you most
profoundly.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Big Chill.
The Lady Vanishes (1938)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The funniest of Alfred
Hitchcock's British movies:
Dame May Whitty chats to Mar
garet Lockwood in the dining car
of a train, then disappears;
Lockwood seeks assistance in
finding her lost friend, but no
one believes in Whitty's exis
tence — except for the dashing
hero, Michael Redgrave. The
spy story has dash, too. Sidney
Gilliat and Frank Launder
adapted a novel by Ethel Lina
White, and Paul Lukas, Basil
Radford, Naunton Wayne.
Googie Withers and others turn
up on the train in supporting
roles. A delight.
Plays today with Rear
Window.
The Big Chill (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A glib, empty movie about the
middle-aged crises of the
children of the '60s, written and
directed by Lawrence Kasdan
(Barbara Benedek collaborated
on the screenplay), in which the
jazzy montages suggest rock
videos and the musical selections
not only determine the editing

hut also define the content of
each scene. A group of college
friends learns of the suicide of
one of their number and Bathers
to mourn hiiw rc
their own lives. In this movie
about the triumph of frienu>» ,
over the scariness of the world
outside, the women are warm
and ri> UlWii.ui ft* a liitle dopey,
and the ultimate sacritice to
propagate the '60s spirit occurs
when one of them lets her hus
band sleep with her besi aiend
so that she, too, can become a
mother. Jeff Goldblum and
William Hurt give the be«t per
formances; the cast also includes
Glenn Close, Kevin Kline. Mary
Kay Place, Tom Berenger,
Jobeth Williams and Meg Tilly.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Moscow on the Hudson.
Last Tango in Paris (1973)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bernardo Bertolucci's study of
a neurotic sexual relationship
between a middle-aged man — a
one-time Bohemian whose wife
has just committed suicide —

and a young French bourgeoise
may be the greatest film of the
last 20 years. No one has ever
explored sexuality in movies in
as intimate and unrelenting a
manner. Bertolucci and Marlon
Brando, who plays the tragic
hero, are surely the most
amazing director-actor combina
tion since D. W. Griffith and Lil
lian Gish, to describe what
Brando does for this movie
would require searching for new
superlatives. With Maria
Schneider, Jean-Pierre Leaud,
Maria Michi and Massimo
Girotti; screenplay by Bertolucci
and Franco Arcalli;
photographed by Vittorio
Storaro; music by Gato Barbieri.
The 20 paintings in the opening
credits are by Francis Bacon.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with In the Realm of the Senses.
The Good Fight (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A documentary about the
Abraham Lincoln (American)
Brigade in the Spanish Civil
War, produced and directed by
Noel Buckner, Mary Dore and
Sam Sills, and narrated by Studs
Terkel. Some interesting inter
viewees, notably one Evelyn
Hutchins, who fought to be con
sidered the equal of American
men fighting in the war, and Bill
Bailey, the longshoreman who
stole Seeing Red. show up — but
it's of greater historical and
sociological than dramatic inter
est. Considering the subject, we
expect a more stirring picture
than we get.
Plays Monday.
The Dark Crystal (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Jim Henson's plot
(dramatized by David Odell)
concerns the efforts of Jen, a
"gelfling," to recover the lost
shard of an indigo-colored crys
tal that determines the power of
whoever possesses it, and thus
free the land from the tyranny of
the dreaded Skeksis. Despite all
the steals from Norse mythology
by way of Tolkien, and from The
Wizard of Oz and even The
Picture of Dorian Gray, this
muppet-populated movie lacks
the requisite magical dimension.
Some of the creatures Brian
Froud has designed are wonder
ful to watch, but the good guys
have been constructed much less
imaginatively than the monsters;
the action sequences are
claustrophobic; and the major
set pieces are visually insubstan
tial. Muppet masters Henson
and Frank Oz co-directed.
Plays tomorrow, Sunday,
Wednesday and Thursday.


The Big Sleep (1946)
Festival, Palo Alto
Raymond Chandler's slick,
fast-paced detective novel pales
beside this film version, directed
by Howard Hawks and featuring
dialogue by William Faulkner,
Jules Furthman and Leigh
Brackett. The plot is tied in
knots no one has ever succeeded
in untangling; the story goes that
when the screenwriters ran into
trouble, they called Chandler up
and he couldn't figure the damn
thing out either But the prepos
terous tortuousness of the story
is as much a part of the fun as the
double entendres between
Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and
Martha Vickers' turn as Bacall's
infantile, lascivious kid sister.
Bogart's impersonation of
Chandler's private eye hero
Philip Marlowe may not have
met Chandler's standards
(inexplicably, he preferred Dick
Powell in Murder, My Sweet),
but no one else has ever com
plained.
Plays through Wednesday
with To Have and Have Not.

To Have and Have Not
(1944)
Festival, Palo Alto
Warner Brothers bought the
title of an Ernest Hemingway
novella, but the crackling Jules
Furthman-William Faulkner
script has virtually nothing to do
with the book. In this first of
four movies Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall made to
gether, she teaches him how to
whistle and seems far too sexy to
turn into the dried-up, strident
trouper she would become after
his death. They play together
marvelously in this immensely
enjoyable romantic adventure
melodrama, superbly crafted by
Howard Hawks and co-starring
Walter Brennan, Hoagy Carmic
hael, Sheldon Leonard, Dolores
Moran, Dan Seymour and even
Marcel Dalio (of Renoir's Grand
Illusion and Rules of the Game).
Plays through Wednesday
with The Big Sleep.
Thunderball (1965)
Memorial Auditorium
Not the best of the James
Bonds, but very entertaining.
You can tell who works for
whom in the climactic under
water combat because the good
guys wear green scuba suits and
the bad guys wear black. Sean
Connery's adversary is Adolfo
Celi, and his women are
Claudine Auger and Luciana
Paluzzi. Terence Young di
rected, from a script by Richard
Maibaum and John Hopkins.
Plays Sunday evening at 8.
Children of Paradise (1945)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Perhaps the most beloved
"art" film of all time — at least
in this country. The setting is
Paris in the early 19th century;
the characters are actors and
mimes; the theme is the relation
ship between life and art. Jean-
Louis Barrault plays Baptiste
Deburau, the mime; the incom
parable beauty Arletty is
Garance, whom he adores;
Pierre Brasseur is Lemaitre,
whose mistress she is; and Maria
Casares is the actress who wor
ships Baptiste. They are all
splendid. Marcel Came directed,
and the poet Jacques Prevert,
Carne's frequent collaborator,
wrote the screenplay.
Plays Wednesday.
My Brilliant Career (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively
performance) is a rebellious
spirit in turn-of-the-century
rural Australia who is given a
temporary reprieve from farm
life when she is invited to visit
her wealthy, stuffy aunt. All the

other women in her family
posture and say things like
"Marriage gives us respec
tability" and"I prayed to God
for guidance," so we can see how
independent Sybylla is by com
parison; did she spring full
blown, we wonder, from this
conservative brood? This
patchwork of bits from Little
Women and The Sound of Music
and various comedies of the
19305, adapted by Eleanor
Whitcombe from Miles
Franklin's novel and directed by
Gill Armstrong, is rather clumsi
ly staged, and the role of Sybylla,
who flirts with writing and
politics and rejects the proposal
of a decent, intelligent lan
downer (Sam Neill), is puzzling,
to say the least.
Plays Tuesday with We of the
Never Never.
Gorky Park (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
As the Muscovite cop who sets
out to solve a possibly political
murder against the orders of his
superiors, William Hurt looks
like a wax figure and gives a nar
coleptic performance; he's never
seemed so dead on screen
before. But then, Michael
Apted's film of the Martin Cruz
Smith bestseller (scripted by
Dennis Potter) is a deadhead
movie. All the Russians talk in
English accents — to distinguish
them, presumably, from the
Americans (Brian Dennehy and
Lee Marvin) — and collectively
they give a stereotyped impres
sion of Soviets: loud, frontal, un
subtle, and possessing a heavy
sense of humor. Not all the Rus
sians in the movie are intended

to be unsympathetic, but the
Moscow atmosphere is so gray
and lumpy that you can't wait to
defect. (Apted's decision to
shoot close in so much of the
time adds to the claustrophobia.)
Dennehy, as a New York cop
whose brother was among the
murdered, and Joanna Pacula, as
a suspect who falls in love with
Hurt, appear to be the only
human beings in the cast, though
Dennehy's role doesn't really
make sense. (He manages to
prowl around Moscow easily,
without attracting notice — a
highly implausible notion for an
American in the Soviet Union,
one would think.) With lan Ban
nen, Michael Elphick, and
others.
Plays Thursday with The Year
of Living Dangerously.
Moscow on the Hudson
Bijou, Palo Alto
Or You Can't Go Home
Again. Robin Williams gives a
brilliant performance as a saxop
honist with a Moscow circus
playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to
defect. On one level Paul
Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos)
deals with the movement from
repression to freedom, what
freedom implies and what its
constraints and contradictions
are; on another level it's a com
edy about the seductive appeal
of American decadence for Rus
sians (like Ninotchka was); cen
trally, though, it's about what
happens to a man who makes the
choice to cut himself off from
home and family forever. When
