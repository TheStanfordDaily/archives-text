Washington — A bill designed to make it easier
(or women to earn pension rights is on its way to
President Pveagan alter passing the House on a voice
vote yesterday.
The president is expected to sign the measure,
which was first introduced in 1981 by Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the Democratic
vice-presidential nominee.
!t was the second consecutive day that final con
gressional action was taken on bills which are part of
a legislative package addressing financial inequities
suffered by women. On Wednesday, the House
unanimously approved a measure requiring the
withholding of wages when child support payments
are overdue. No one spoke against the legislation.
The provisions in the bill are designed to ensure
that women are credited fully for their early partici
pation in the work force, since many leave the work
force in their early 20s for childbearing and rearing.
The bill also would prevent employees from waiving
coverage for survivors without written consent of
their spouse, and would give state courts specific au
thority to treat pensions as joint property in divorce
cases.
