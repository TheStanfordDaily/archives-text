### 
Mexico City — The United States told 140
countries attending a U.N. population conference

that it will tighten enforcement of a 10-year-old
policy barring the use of U.S. foreign aid to pay for
or promote abortions.
The Reagan administration's population assis
tance plan was outlined in a speech Wednesday by
James Buckley, head of the U.S. delegation, to the
International Conference on Population.
Citing a 1959 declaration protecting the rights of
children before and after birth, he said that the
United States does not consider abortion "an accep
table element of family planning progams."
Buckley said the United States sees economic de
velopment as the best way to reduce population
growth and considers free market policies the path
to that development.
The world s population is now estimated to be
4.677 billion and, according to World Bank figures,
it will double by the year 2050 if it continues to in
crease at its current rate.
Buckley said the Reagan administration has asked
for an increase in family planning foreign aid and
that any funds withheld from one organization
would be diverted to another. Current aid is $240
million a year.
