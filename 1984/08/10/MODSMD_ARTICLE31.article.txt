# Officials try to drive fowl from contaminated marsh

Washington — The Interior Department will start
using scarecrow tactics in October to try to keep
migratory waterfowl out of a man-made marsh in
California's San Joaquin Valley where young birds
are being killed by high concentrations of selenium
in the water, an official said yesterday.
Selenium, a rare metal essential in trace amounts
for human and animal nutrition, is being drawn from

the soil in parts of the valley by irrigation water and
dumped into the marsh, Dave Houston, director of
the California regional office of the Bureau ot
Reclamation, told reporters.
Houston said the bureau "wants to try to reduce
the exposure of waterfowl" while it, the Fish and
Wildlife Service and state agencies conduct various
studies on just how widespread the problem is.
He said plugging the drains of high-selenium
areas upstream would only transfer the problem
somewhere else. So far, the highest concentrations
have been found in an area called the Panoche Fan
near Mendota — 4200 parts per billion in one in
stance.
