# Richard Burton laid to rest

### 
Celigny, Switzerland â€” Actor Richard Burton
was buried in this peaceful Swiss village yesterday
with a sealed envelope and a rose from his wife.
Family and friends of the 58-year-old actor, who
died Sunday of a brain hemorrhage, gathered to pay
their final respects with the hymns and prayers of
Burton's native Wales and the poetry of Welshman
Dylan Thomas.
After the private funeral service in a 400-year-old
Protestant church, he was buried a few hundred
yards away in Celigny's old cemetery. At the
gravesite, Sally Hay, Burton's 36-year-old wife of
13 months, stood grim-faced but dry-eyed for the
final prayers. She placed a sealed envelope and a
rose on her husband's coffin before it was lowered
into the ground. The contents of the envelope were
not made public.
Elizabeth Taylor, who was twice married to Bur
ton, did not attend.
