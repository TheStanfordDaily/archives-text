David Campbell is suing Stanford over its hand
ling of the rights to the Strong-Campbell Voca
tional Interest Test. The results of the trial may
determine the future of the popular test.
The trial, to be argued before a jury at the U.S.
District Court of Northern California in San Jose,
will begin Aug. 15.
The test is used to measure the vocational inter
ests of students. Its results are intended to indicate
which careers they are best-suited for.
Campbell, who updated the former Strong In
terest Test, has had a royalty agreement with the
University since Strong's death in 1965.
The Strong-Campbell test is marketed by over
30 companies to hundreds of high schools every
year. The marketing companies will soon, under a
1983 contract, be overseen by Consulting Psyc
hologists Press, Inc. (CPP).
Campbell is taking issue with this contract, ar

guing that it is a breach of his 1966 agreement
with Stanford which holds that "neither party to
this contract shall transfer his interest therein, ex
cept as a whole and not without written consent of
the other party thereto."
Stanford holds that it has been licensing with
CPP for more than ten years, and for a number of
years before the 1966 agreement, and has never
broken any contract obligation because the con
tract reads "if for any reason the Author does not
supply such new matter or revise the WORK,
after a reasonable time has been given to do so,
the Publisher may engage some competent person
to do so . .
Regular research and updating of the test was
abandoned by Campbell in the early '70s to
enable him to take a position with a leadership
training organization in North Carolina.
Dr. Jo-Ida Hansen took over research and up
dating work from Campbell at his Center for In
terest Measurement Research at the University of
Minnesota. Stanford lawyers claim that the bulk
of the updating research is still done by Hansen.
According to Campbell's lawyers, the profes
sor's main concern is with research.
"This is the first time it (research and updating)
has been done by a private firm," said attorney
Ronald Katz of the firm representing Campbell.
Stanford contends, however, that Campbell's
case is not so pure. According to David Heilbron
of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and Enersen in San
Francisco, the University's counselor, Campbell
has large amounts of stock in National Computer
Systems (NCS). NCS has, in the past, been one of
the licensed scorers of the test under CPP.
In the 1983 contract with Stanford, however,
NCS would steadily lessen its role in the test
scoring, and therefore lose an important contract
with CPP and the Strong-Campbell Test.

To compound the situation, Campbell is devel
oping a new test, almost ready for marketing,
which will directly compete with the Strong-
Campbell survey. Stanford holds that this is en
tirely illegal according to the 1966 contract.
In the contract, Campbell agrees not to produce
competing tests â€” a type of anti-competition rule.
Katz, however, claims this agreement is not valid
because it is illegal.
If Campbell is successful in nullifying the
Stanford-CPP contract and taking out the anti
competition clause in his 1966 contract, the test
may be thrown into a distribution confusion and
be eventually replaced by a Campbell Vocational
Interest Survey.
If Stanford and CPP succeed in giving full de
velopment rights to CPP and keeping the ex
clusivity rule against Campbell's test, Stanford
will be earning higher profits in spite of what
could potentially be a lesser quality exam.
The end result could be a shift to other, less
known exams introduced by other universities and
firms since the Strong Test was introduced in
1927.
