David Campbell is suing Stanford over its hand
ling of the rights to the Strong-Campbell Voca
tional Interest Test. The results of the trial may
determine the future of the popular test.
The trial, to be argued before a jury at the U.S.
District Court of Northern California in San Jose,

with Stanford which holds that "neither party to
this contract shall transfer his interest therein, ex
cept as a whole and not without written consent of
the other party thereto."

CPP for more than ten years, and for a number of

to do so . .
Regular research and updating of the test was
abandoned by Campbell in the early '70s to
enable him to take a position with a leadership
training organization in North Carolina.
