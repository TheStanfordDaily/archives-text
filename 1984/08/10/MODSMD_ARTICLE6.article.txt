# Court not turning conservative, say law profs
## 
### DAN CORAN 
Although the 1983-84 Supreme Court
session included decisions which some
believe mark a conservative turn in the
court, two Stanford constitutional law
professors believe it is too early to make
definitive judgments.
"A move to the right is not supported
by the evidence," said Prof. William
Cohen. "The Burger Court is basically a
centrist drifting court which has basically
remained the same for the last five years.
The reason a turn to the right has been
trumpeted so much is because
(President) Reagan happened to win a
few decisions recently."
The rulings handed down in the court's
last session of the year included one
which provides for a "good faith'' excep
tion to the exclusionary rule â€” allowing

police in some cases to rely on warrants
improperly issued by judges.
The court also weakened the Miranda
rights of arrested criminals and upheld
the Solomon Amendment which bars
federal aid to students who don't register
for the draft.
In addition, the court supported
Reagan's ban on tourist travel to Cuba,
upheld publicly funded Christmas dis
plays and denied prisoners the right to
keep family pictures in their cells.
In a less conservative vein, the court
passed a ruling which upholds the
statutory rights of handicapped students
to receive medical aid in the schools, al
though their parents would not be reim
bursed for suing for such coverage.
Another decision prevents the all
male Jaycees from barring women from

membership and another allows public
television stations to broadcast
editorials.
Constitutional law professor Deborah
Rhode noted that, although a conserva
tive movement in the court was un

avoidable, due to the appointment of
justices like William Rehnquist, Sandra
Day O'Connor and Warren Burger,
"how substantial a retrenchment in
politically divisive areas, such as criminal
law, waits to be seen."
Responding to the popular idea that
the court may now be in a "transition
period" between the political activism of
the Warren Court and an era of conser
vative judicial restraint, Rhode warned
that there is "some danger in attempting
to characterize one's time. It is often dif
ficult to identify broad trends when one
is still in the middle of them."
Rhode admitted that the court may be
an important issue in the upcoming
presidential election. With five justices
75 years or older, she said the next presi
dent will have "quite a significant oppor
tunity to appoint several justices during
the next four years." Although many
believe Reagan, if re-elected, would be
in a position to entrench his conservative
outlook into the makeup of the court,

Rhode predicted, "Reagan may be
surprised. Sometimes presidents are
surprised to find where the sympathies of
judges ultimately lie." She added that
even if Reagan had the opportunity to
recast the court, there would be some
factors which would discourage such a
court from leaning consistently to the
right. One of these factors is judicial
precedent.
"Particularly in those instances which
involve statutory construction, as
opposed to constitutional construction,
judicial precedent is a prohibitive factor.
The court has always felt freer to alter its
constitutional interpretations than to
change its stance on legislation passed by
Congress."
Like Rhode, Prof. Cohen looks dis
favorably on the recent court action to
amend the exclusionary rule.
"Criminal procedure," Cohen noted,
"is one area in which there has been
steady picking-away at Warren Court
precedents over the years. This ruling is
unique in that it represents an overruling

rather than just a picking-away.
However, this decision by itself isn't
the major issue. The real question is
whether or not the exclusionary rule will
be curtailed in its application to searches
made incidental to arrest. Such a move
could set criminal procedure in the U.S.
back one quarter of a century."
Prof. Rhode agrees with Cohen's dis
favorable view of the court's exclusion
ary rule decision. She said the decision

"is reflective of a general, more conser
vative view of criminal law in which cur
tailments are made to work in favor of
convicting the guilty. This particular ac
tion by the court undervalues the role
criminal law has always played in con
taining the police and state, and deprives
the judiciary of one of its few practical
methods for controlling those who have
great power over not just criminals, but
over all citizens."
