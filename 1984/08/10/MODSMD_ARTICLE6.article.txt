# Court not turning conservative, say law profs

Although the 1983-84 Supreme Court
session included decisions which some
believe mark a conservative turn in the
court, two Stanford constitutional law
professors believe it is too early to make
definitive judgments.
"A move to the right is not supported
by the evidence," said Prof. William
Cohen. "The Burger Court is basically a

The court also weakened the Miranda
rights of arrested criminals and upheld
the Solomon Amendment which bars
federal aid to students who don't register
for the draft.
In addition, the court supported
Reagan's ban on tourist travel to Cuba,
upheld publicly funded Christmas dis
plays and denied prisoners the right to
keep family pictures in their cells.
In a less conservative vein, the court
passed a ruling which upholds the
statutory rights of handicapped students
to receive medical aid in the schools, al

Another decision prevents the all
male Jaycees from barring women from

membership and another allows public
television stations to broadcast
editorials.
Constitutional law professor Deborah
Rhode noted that, although a conserva

avoidable, due to the appointment of
justices like William Rehnquist, Sandra
Day O'Connor and Warren Burger,
