## Steroid doctor claims his patients won in Olympics 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — More than a dozen
Olympic athletes who used banned anabolic
steroids have won medals during the current
Games but escaped detection because they
stopped taking the drugs several months ago, a
controversial physician who prescribes steroids
claimed yesterday.
"As far as the athletes I deal with, all of
them have performed well and I would like to
brag about how many gold medals and silver
medals my patients have won in the last week,
but I can't," Dr. Robert Kerr told The Associ
ated Press. "But you'd be amazed at the num
ber."
Citing doctor-patient confidentiality, Kerr
declined to identify any of the patients who
won medals after they took steroids he
prescribed. He also refused to specify how
many of his steroid-using patients have won
medals during the Games but said: "It's cer
tainly over a dozen."
Or. Tony Daly, medical director for the
Olympics, was away from his International
Olympic Committee Medical Commission of
fice and unreachable for immediate comment,
officials said.
Kerr, a suburban San Gabriel physician who
has been harshly criticized by other doctors for

prescribing steroids and who claims to have
prescribed steroids for Olympians from 20 na
tions in recent years, said the medal winners
among his patients evaded detection when
their urine was tested because they stopped
using anabolic (muscle-building) steroids "at
least three or four months ago."
"But I know of other athletes who tell me
they halted their drugs only 15 to 17 days
before the tests and told me they passed the
test," Kerr said. "With the stories the Olympic
Committee has given out about how reliable
the tests arc, it seems hard to believe. But
there have been so many (athletes) who have
told me those stories that I tend to believe
them."
Some of those Olympic competitors used
human growth hormone, for which there is no
accurate detection test, he said.
Yesterday, he said many athletes believe
using steroids is the same as using vitamins or
minerals, saying that Olympic officials "are the
only ones who look at it as cheating."
Nevertheless, Kerr praised the Olympic drug
testing program, saying it has prevented most
athletes from taking excessive doses of steroids
and from using them just before the Games.
