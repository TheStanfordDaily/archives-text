# House may let superfund grow
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Amid
arguments that hazardous waste
threatens the health of
thousands of Americans, the
House moved yesterday toward
approving a sixfold expansion of
the "superfund" to clean up
abandoned toxic chemical
dumps.
The bill would boost the so
called superfund, the govern
ment's chief tool for fighting
hazardous waste pollution, from
$1.6 billion to $10.2 billion over
the next five years.
Rep. James Florio (D-N.J.),
the bill's sponsor, said the cur
rent $1.6 billion fund has been
shown to be clearly inadequate
for the job, and "substantial ad
ditional funding will be needed
to finish the cleanup job."
The bill would require the
EPA to act on a minimum of
150 sites a year and would set
national standards for the sites
to be considered clean. Only six
toxic waste sites have been
cleaned up in the program's

four-year history, out of 546 on
the EPA's top priority list.
The current superfund law
does not expire until next year,
and the Reagan administration
has urged Congress to delay ac
tion on the law so the EPA can
better assess what changes are
needed.
The administration position
was supported by Rep. James
Broyhill (R-N.C.), who said the
bill "could have the effect of
slowing down the progress that
has been achieved by the EPA
in recent months" by saddling
the agency with-broad new pro
grams and responsibilities it
cannot now handle.
The cost of the expanded
fund is controversial among
those who would pay it. To raise
the $10.2 billion, the House
Ways and Means Committee
proposed major increases in su
perfund taxes on crude oil and
chemical feedstocks and raw
materials.
