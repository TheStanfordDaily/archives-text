# Moslem pilgrims get Red Sea escort
## 
### 
Cairo (AP) â€” Egyptian
sources said yesterday that
Cairo would provide military es
corts for pilgrims sailing across
the Red Sea to Moslem holy
cities in Saudi Arabia, and
Iranian leader Ayatollah
Khomeini denounced mine at
tacks that have damaged at least
13 ships in recent weeks.
Khomeini harshly criticized
his nation's own official radio,
which earlier this week praised
the mining campaign and broad
cast an extremist Islamic group's
claim of responsibilty for the ex
plosions, Iran's official news
agency said.
"Serious measures should be
taken in order to stop unsound
statements read on the national
radio which defame Iran," the
Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted him as saying.
"Whatever happens, they blame
us," he said in the statement
monitored in Cyprus.
Hundreds of thousands of
Moslems are expected to take

part in the annual pilgrimage to
holy places in Saudi Arabia, in
cluding about 110,000 Egyp
tians.
Egyptian officials said about
25,000 of them will sail across
the Red Sea. The first Egyptian
ship, the Syria, with 605
pilgrims aboard, left yesterday
afternoon from Suez City at the
southern end of the Suez Canal.
Suez City maritime sources
said Egyptian navy ships will es
cort some of the passenger ships
"almost all the way" to the edge
of Egyptian territorial waters.
Navy, coast guard and air force
patrols also will "keep an eye"
on the passenger ships, they
said, speaking on condition they
not be identified.
The Pentagon said it was sen
ding four minesweeping
helicopters to help clear the sea
lanes, and the British Defense
Ministry said Wednesday it was
sending four minesweepers and
a support ship from the
Mediterranean Sea.
