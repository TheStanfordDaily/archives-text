# COMMENTARY
## Ronald Hilton Reflections on travel then and now 
### 
In the good old days, most people lived without
straying far from their native village. The sons of the
oligarehy took out a year or so for a grand tour, with
Italy usually the final destination. They travelled intel
ligently through regions varying in landscape, architec
ture, language and customs. From this emerged travel
literature, the treasures of which have been neglectcd
by oui scholars. Now the phrase "travel literature''
means promotional folders put out with commercial in
tent tor the masses more interested in having a good
time than in completing their education. This is prog
ress. I he world is becoming homogenized, so that San
Francisco and, to a lesser degree, historic cities like
London have been Manhattanized. So, head for the
beaches.
A second form of travel is the convention business,
much of it a sham. Union leaders who complain about
the oppression of the workers besport themselves at
conventions held in Las Vegas or Miami. Librarians
who complain that they cannot find $20 to subscribe to
the World Affairs Report somehow find funds to meet
in Flawaii. Most of the business conducted at conven
tions could be carried out at much less expense usinu
modern conference techniques developed by the com
munications industry, but that would be less fun than
chatting with Joe in the bar.
This convention business becomes particularly
reprehensible when the Democratic Party meets in San
Francisco and enjoys an orgy of parties while claiming
to defend the poor and the oppressed. Why did it not
accept tne invitation of Detroit to meet there and thus
help that depressed community? The public reaction
was one ol boredom and revulsion. The Romans used
bread and circuses, but this was pate de foie gras and
cocktails, and the world press viewed this circus, as it
was commonly called, with less than admiration. The
U.S. Government, at considerable expense, brought
political figures from places like Somalia to see the U.S.
model ot democracy. Even a majority of Americans,
when polled about the convention, voted "Never
again."
Travel as a political weapon has been conspicuously
used by Jesse Jackson, who used it to counter his
party's patent unfairness to him. His trip to Syria was
dramatically successful, but his later visits to Mexico,

Central America and especially Cuba reflected the use
of travel to legitimize bias — a mirror image of the con
servatives who go to the Soviet Union and on their
return have not a good word to say about it. The leftist
bias dominates in our universities. Jesse Jackson's wife
went to Nicaragua and was invited to speak with others
of like persuasion at an ambitious Stanford student
sponsored conference in which experienced analysts of
Central American affairs were not invited to participate
because they do not have a "convenient" viewpoint.
The failure of Jackson and the left to speak out against
political prisons in Cuba is a shameful suppression of
the truth. They should read the testimony of former
prisoners in Castro's jails recorded in the o'urrie FA
presidio politico en Cuba comunista: festinu nio
(Caracas, 1982, pp 511).
This is not to suggest for one moment that the Demo
cratic Party and the left alone abuse travel as an instru
ment. The leaders of the capitalist big seven seem to be
living in the times of Louis XIV. President Mitterrand
of France came to power on a left-wing platform, but
then scrapped it. While he placed restrictions on travel
abroad of ordinary Frenchmen, he has made an
unprecedented series of triumphal processions outside
of France and has invited his capitalist peers to
convivia in the palaces ol Versailles and Fontainebleau.
The chattering loquendi of international conferences is
a poor return for the cost. A conspicuous case has been
the MRF talks in Vienna, which have been going on for
years without result. Perhaps, as Churchill said, jaw jaw
is better than war war, but by jaw he meant speech, not
chompers, and he would be merciless with the political
leaders who turn speech wheels, a modern variant of
the ancient prayer wheels.
Even religion has become infected. There has been a
remarkable change in the papacy. In protest against the
seizure ot the papal states in 1870, the popes remained
cloistered in the Vatican until the Lateran Treaty of
Now Pope John Paul II has outdone Mitterrand
in his travels. Like many political leaders today, he is a
born actor, and like them he dreamed of being an actor
in his youth. He has done much to assuage anti-papal
feeling, but on fundamental issues such as birth control
he remains inflexible; he refuses to face the conse
quences of the population explosion in Latin America.

The National Council of Churches sends a group of 266
American church leaders to the Soviet Union, and they
return with a report worthy of Jesse Jackson.
At least we know what these people are up to. The
problem arises with the incredible comings and goings
of Communist leaders, often from poor Third World
countries; the official reports reveal little of anything.
We can often guess. For example, North Korean boss
Kim 11-Sung and a large retinue recently completed a
trip worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. In a spe
cial train they traveled all across Asia to Moscow, then
around Eastern Europe, and again home via Siberia.
The main Soviet aim clearly was to woo North Korea
'-om China. However, all too frequent! these
u crips are wrapped in mystery. Their cost is huge,
especially when a special plane is used, and obviously
poor countries or non-ruling Communist countries can
not afford them. The money must come from Moscow.
Such travel takes not only money but time. The sad
fact is that many of the leade. the world read vir
tually nothing. Candidates for the U.S. presidency lead
a life which leaves them no time to read or think, yet
they must have opinions on almost every subject. It is
really a charade. Politicians enjoy it because they are
the center of attention, whereas out of office they may
become nonpersons; in a non-Western country they
may be exiled or left in destitution unless they have
taken care-of themselves while in office; then they can
travel to some pleasant spot and settle there.
All this may seem to add up to an unqualified indict
ment of travel by political figures. It does not. Despite
everything, no one can be more dangerous than a Hitler
or a Stalin whose lack of foreign experience gives him a
false views of the world and makes him liable to commit
the most grave miscalculations. This does not mean that
every political traveler will become a tolerant cos
mopolitan. Years abroad did little to make Gromyko or
Khomeini more congenial members of the international
community. But, believe it or not, they might have been
worse had they never gone abroad. And as for con
viviality, it would be worth the expense in their case.
Think of it, a convivial Gromyko! A convivial
Khomeini!

tually nothing. Candidates for the U.S. presidency lead
a life which leaves them no time to read or think, yet
they must have opinions on almost every subject. It is
really a charade. Politicians enjoy it because they are
the center of attention, whereas out of office they may
become nonpersons; in a non-Western country they
may be exiled or left in destitution unless they have
taken care-of themselves while in office; then they can
travel to some pleasant spot and settle there.
All this may seem to add up to an unqualified indict
ment of travel by political figures. It does not. Despite
everything, no one can be more dangerous than a Hitler
or a Stalin whose lack of foreign experience gives him a
false views of the world and makes him liable to commit
the most grave miscalculations. This does not mean that
every political traveler will become a tolerant cos
mopolitan. Years abroad did little to make Gromyko or
Khomeini more congenial members of the international
community. But, believe it or not, they might have been
worse had they never gone abroad. And as for con
viviality, it would be worth the expense in their case.
Think of it, a convivial Gromyko! A convivial
Khomeini!
(Ronald Hilton is an emeritus professor and editor of the
World Affairs Report.)
In the good old days, most people lived without
straying far from their native village. The sons of the
oligarehy took out a year or so for a grand tour, with
Italy usually the final destination. They travelled intel
ligently through regions varying in landscape, architec
ture, language and customs. From this emerged travel
literature, the treasures of which have been neglectcd
by oui scholars. Now the phrase "travel literature''
means promotional folders put out with commercial in
tent tor the masses more interested in having a good
time than in completing their education. This is prog
ress. I he world is becoming homogenized, so that San
Francisco and, to a lesser degree, historic cities like
London have been Manhattanized. So, head for the
beaches.
A second form of travel is the convention business,
much of it a sham. Union leaders who complain about
the oppression of the workers besport themselves at
conventions held in Las Vegas or Miami. Librarians
who complain that they cannot find $20 to subscribe to
the World Affairs Report somehow find funds to meet
in Flawaii. Most of the business conducted at conven
tions could be carried out at much less expense usinu
modern conference techniques developed by the com
munications industry, but that would be less fun than
chatting with Joe in the bar.
This convention business becomes particularly
reprehensible when the Democratic Party meets in San
Francisco and enjoys an orgy of parties while claiming
to defend the poor and the oppressed. Why did it not
accept tne invitation of Detroit to meet there and thus
help that depressed community? The public reaction
was one ol boredom and revulsion. The Romans used
bread and circuses, but this was pate de foie gras and
cocktails, and the world press viewed this circus, as it
was commonly called, with less than admiration. The
U.S. Government, at considerable expense, brought
political figures from places like Somalia to see the U.S.
model ot democracy. Even a majority of Americans,
when polled about the convention, voted "Never
again."
Travel as a political weapon has been conspicuously
used by Jesse Jackson, who used it to counter his
party's patent unfairness to him. His trip to Syria was
dramatically successful, but his later visits to Mexico,

Central America and especially Cuba reflected the use
of travel to legitimize bias — a mirror image of the con
servatives who go to the Soviet Union and on their
return have not a good word to say about it. The leftist
bias dominates in our universities. Jesse Jackson's wife
went to Nicaragua and was invited to speak with others
of like persuasion at an ambitious Stanford student
sponsored conference in which experienced analysts of
Central American affairs were not invited to participate
because they do not have a "convenient" viewpoint.
The failure of Jackson and the left to speak out against
political prisons in Cuba is a shameful suppression of
the truth. They should read the testimony of former
prisoners in Castro's jails recorded in the o'urrie FA
presidio politico en Cuba comunista: festinu nio
(Caracas, 1982, pp 511).
This is not to suggest for one moment that the Demo
cratic Party and the left alone abuse travel as an instru
ment. The leaders of the capitalist big seven seem to be
living in the times of Louis XIV. President Mitterrand
of France came to power on a left-wing platform, but
then scrapped it. While he placed restrictions on travel
abroad of ordinary Frenchmen, he has made an
unprecedented series of triumphal processions outside
of France and has invited his capitalist peers to
convivia in the palaces ol Versailles and Fontainebleau.
The chattering loquendi of international conferences is
a poor return for the cost. A conspicuous case has been
the MRF talks in Vienna, which have been going on for
years without result. Perhaps, as Churchill said, jaw jaw
is better than war war, but by jaw he meant speech, not
chompers, and he would be merciless with the political
leaders who turn speech wheels, a modern variant of
the ancient prayer wheels.
Even religion has become infected. There has been a
remarkable change in the papacy. In protest against the
seizure ot the papal states in 1870, the popes remained
cloistered in the Vatican until the Lateran Treaty of
Now Pope John Paul II has outdone Mitterrand
in his travels. Like many political leaders today, he is a
born actor, and like them he dreamed of being an actor
in his youth. He has done much to assuage anti-papal
feeling, but on fundamental issues such as birth control
he remains inflexible; he refuses to face the conse
quences of the population explosion in Latin America.

The National Council of Churches sends a group of 266
American church leaders to the Soviet Union, and they
return with a report worthy of Jesse Jackson.
At least we know what these people are up to. The
problem arises with the incredible comings and goings
of Communist leaders, often from poor Third World
countries; the official reports reveal little of anything.
We can often guess. For example, North Korean boss
Kim 11-Sung and a large retinue recently completed a
trip worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. In a spe
cial train they traveled all across Asia to Moscow, then
around Eastern Europe, and again home via Siberia.
The main Soviet aim clearly was to woo North Korea
'-om China. However, all too frequent! these
u crips are wrapped in mystery. Their cost is huge,
especially when a special plane is used, and obviously
poor countries or non-ruling Communist countries can
not afford them. The money must come from Moscow.
