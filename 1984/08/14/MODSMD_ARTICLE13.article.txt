## Cohn's argument threatens open inquiry 
### 
Robert Greer Cohn argued that "since the
psyche is by definition a universal phenomenon,
infinite, it cannot be demonstrated by the finite
methods of science." I have no idea what he in
tended those words to mean; it did suggest the
image to me, however, of trying to keep a cat in a
bag because that is where one had put it.
If infinity exists, how would we know that it
does? James Ogilvy has argued in "Many-
Dimensional Man" that it was only with the de
velopment of monotheism that men, modeling
themselves after their god, acquired minds with
egos that could conceive no limits. A panoply of
limited gods, such as the ancient Greeks had, pro
vided the somewhat more healthy model of
limitation and balance which, Ogilvy argues, was
reflected in Greek minds.
More importantly, to argue as Cohn does that
"great writers" have opposed "attempts to
impose neat schemes on the complexity of
reality", and then to impose the neat and simplis
tic scheme of current-day political classification
(left, right and center) upon their rich and varied

texts seems to me to be both self-contradictory
and violent. To reduce "great writers" into an
anonymous yet all-encompassing "they" is cer
tainly problematic to any type of analysis. Con
sider the texts of the Old Testament and
"Beowulf' and those of the authors Homer,
Dante, More, Luther, Shakespeare, Goethe,
Hawthorne, Melville, Bronte, Tolstoy, Nietzsche,
Woolf, Joyce, Rilke, Lessing, deßeauvoir — can
one approach these texts asking left, right or cen
ter and experience any kind of authentic engage
ment with them? Can any systematic statements
be made about "them" as a whole?
What bothers me most, however, is Cohn's style
of argumentation: To assert dogmatically through
using a "truism" and a definition which is
declared at the outset to be unchallengable seems
to me to be against the spirit of open inquiry. As
John Stuart Mill pointed out, to claim a truth to be
so true that it can't be challenged is to assert one's
own infallibility.
