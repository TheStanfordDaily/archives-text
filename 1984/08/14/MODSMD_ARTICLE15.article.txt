## Dean Jean: It ain't easy to admit... 
### KAREN AVRICH LORI GOTTLIEB 
Provost Albert Hastorf has no doubts
that Jean Fetter is the right person to
replace Fred Hargadon as dean of admis
sions.
'Jean Fetter will do superbly," he
said. "She will bring a number of
strengths to the job. She has a wonderful
understanding of what a liberal arts edu
cation is all about . . . and will be a good
representative of the University. She will
run a first-class show," commented Has
torf.
In addition to her impressive creden
tials, this tall, blond woman will bring her
own charismatic personality to the office
of dean of admissions.
Fetter was born in Swansea, Wales,
Dylan Thomas' hometown. She attended
a school for girls there until the age of
16, then went to another girls' school in
London, where she was elected "head
girl," the equivalent of student body
president.
The students were required to wear
special dresses, special shoes, hats and
gloves. Fetter says "that was a very form
ative period of my life, playing a leader
ship role in an all-girls school."
At the age of eleven, she passed what
is known as the "eleven plus" exam, a
test of mathematics, English, and general
knowledge. She referred to this exam as
one of the "academic hurdles of the
British educational system . . . every stu
dent would be terrified of it," because it
determined whether a child would attend
a grammar or comprehensive school. "It
really sets one on track for the rest of his
career," she said, "immediately estab
lishing the academic hierarchy in Great
Britain."
Fetter had a rigorous schooling in
London, and her second "academic
hurdle" came at fifteen with the National
Exams, a set of tests in nine "hardcore"
subjects, among them mathematics,
physics, chemistry, history, and geogra

phy. After these ordinary level exams,
when she was eighteen, she took her ad
vanced level tests in four subjects:
physics, chemistry, pure mathematics,
and applied mathematics. Essentially,
this determined admission to the univer
sities. Thus in Great Britain in the 19505,
a student had chosen his major by the
age of 16.
'My family always considered me un
usual. I was the first person in my family
to go to college,." she said. In 1956, she
went to Oxford to study physics. "At the
age of 10 or 11, mathematics was a very
important part of my life. And then, as I

waitress slicing cucumber sandwiches in Devonshire.

got a bit older, 14 or 15, I became more
interested in the application of mathe
matics. I took enormous pleasure in sol
ving mathematical problems." Fetter felt
the transition from coming from an all
female environment into a male
dominated one was difficult. There were
120 men and five women of her year
majoring in physics. "It was very tough. I
felt unprepared in some ways, and yet in
other ways, I think the intellectual stand
ards among women were much higher
because there were 10 times as many
men as women, and the competition for a
woman to get in was much more in
tense." Although at times she felt her
confidence was "a little nudged," she
was the only woman in her class to earn a
first-class degree.
After graduating from Oxford, she was
"absolutely awed" to be asked by her
tutor to stay on as a research assistant.
For three years she experimented in the
Oxford observatory working on the anal

ysis of sun spots. She planned on con
tinuing research until she met her hus
band, an American Rhodes scholar, who
was studying physics there as well. He
had noticed her in the laboratory, and
she found him "rather cute." They met
again on an Oxford-Cambridge ski trip
in Austria, for which she had saved
money by spending a summer as a
waitress slicing cucumber sandwiches in
a restaurant in Devonshire. They were
introduced by a mutual friend; he leaving
the doctor's office with a broken wrist,
she on her way to a skiing lesson. "It was
one of those holiday romances that

doesn't quite end." After her husband
finished his graduate work at Harvard,
they were married.
Fetter was offered a junior fellowship
at Oxford but came to the United States
on a joint fellowship from the British and
American Federation of Women. After
spending a year at Harvard, she became
pregnant and moved to Berkeley, where
her husband, now a professor of physics
at Stanford, was doing post-doctoral re
search. She has two children — Anne, a
senior majoring in Economics at Wil
liams College, and a son, Andrew, who
will be a junior in high school. He, too, is
interested in the sciences; this summer
he worked in the pathology department
at the Veterans Administration hospital.
"Her family is very pleased with her new
opportunities. We are all a little bit
awed," said her husband. Despite her
busy schedule, her son said "she always
makes time to spend with the family."

For instance, they all entered the
Rapp's Triathlon; Jean Fetter hiked the
seven-and-one-half-mile run and her
team won a trophy. She "finds some kind
of physical activity important. 1 cycle to
work every day," she said.
As a family, they snorkel, sail, scuba
dive and ski. In addition to playing tennis
and field hockey, she was on her college
varsity basketball team for three year 1 -.
"I just love playing on teams. It is setting
a goal and then doing it. It is a physical
challenge," Fetter said.
She has taken a number of backpack
ing trips in the Sierras, and this summer
she will hike through the French Alps
with her family. She attends physics con
ferences with her husband in Europe and
pays frequent visits to her mother and
96-year-old great aunt in Britain. Her
aunt is "a very influential figure in my
life. She is like a grandmother to me."
Literature is another of her interests.
"Any person with a job of responsibility
needs a certain amount of private time,
and reading is very private ... I like
reading British authors such as Virginia
Woolf, because I think it maintains some
sort of link with my homeland." Fetter
goes to the opera with her husband
during the fall season. "A lovely thing
about being at Stanford is that there is al
ways a lot of music and theatrical
productions. There is never a dull mo
ment."
University President Donald Kennedy
is also very enthusiastic about Stanford's
new dean. He said she is "original and
creative ... A thoughtful person deeply
interested in Stanford and the educa
tional process. Her experience as a
working scientist and associate dean of
graduate studies will give a valuable per
spective on the admissions process."
Soon after her appointment as dean of
admissions was announced, Fetter was
given the nickname "Dean Jean." This
name does not bother Jean Fetter. It
merely evokes a smile.

one of those holiday romances that

doesn't quite end." After her husband
finished his graduate work at Harvard,
they were married.
Fetter was offered a junior fellowship
at Oxford but came to the United States
on a joint fellowship from the British and
American Federation of Women. After
spending a year at Harvard, she became
pregnant and moved to Berkeley, where
her husband, now a professor of physics
at Stanford, was doing post-doctoral re
search. She has two children — Anne, a
senior majoring in Economics at Wil
liams College, and a son, Andrew, who
will be a junior in high school. He, too, is
interested in the sciences; this summer
he worked in the pathology department
at the Veterans Administration hospital.
"Her family is very pleased with her new
opportunities. We are all a little bit
awed," said her husband. Despite her
busy schedule, her son said "she always
makes time to spend with the family."

For instance, they all entered the
Rapp's Triathlon; Jean Fetter hiked the
seven-and-one-half-mile run and her
team won a trophy. She "finds some kind
of physical activity important. 1 cycle to
work every day," she said.
As a family, they snorkel, sail, scuba
dive and ski. In addition to playing tennis
and field hockey, she was on her college
varsity basketball team for three year 1 -.
"I just love playing on teams. It is setting
a goal and then doing it. It is a physical
challenge," Fetter said.
She has taken a number of backpack
ing trips in the Sierras, and this summer
she will hike through the French Alps
with her family. She attends physics con
ferences with her husband in Europe and
pays frequent visits to her mother and
96-year-old great aunt in Britain. Her
aunt is "a very influential figure in my
life. She is like a grandmother to me."
Literature is another of her interests.
"Any person with a job of responsibility
needs a certain amount of private time,
and reading is very private ... I like
reading British authors such as Virginia
Woolf, because I think it maintains some
sort of link with my homeland." Fetter
goes to the opera with her husband
during the fall season. "A lovely thing
about being at Stanford is that there is al
ways a lot of music and theatrical
productions. There is never a dull mo
ment."
University President Donald Kennedy
is also very enthusiastic about Stanford's
new dean. He said she is "original and
creative ... A thoughtful person deeply
interested in Stanford and the educa
tional process. Her experience as a
working scientist and associate dean of
graduate studies will give a valuable per
spective on the admissions process."
Soon after her appointment as dean of
admissions was announced, Fetter was
given the nickname "Dean Jean." This
name does not bother Jean Fetter. It
merely evokes a smile.
Provost Albert Hastorf has no doubts
that Jean Fetter is the right person to
replace Fred Hargadon as dean of admis
sions.
'Jean Fetter will do superbly," he
said. "She will bring a number of
strengths to the job. She has a wonderful
understanding of what a liberal arts edu
cation is all about . . . and will be a good
representative of the University. She will
run a first-class show," commented Has
torf.
In addition to her impressive creden
tials, this tall, blond woman will bring her
own charismatic personality to the office
of dean of admissions.
Fetter was born in Swansea, Wales,
Dylan Thomas' hometown. She attended
a school for girls there until the age of
16, then went to another girls' school in
London, where she was elected "head
girl," the equivalent of student body
president.
The students were required to wear
special dresses, special shoes, hats and
gloves. Fetter says "that was a very form
ative period of my life, playing a leader
ship role in an all-girls school."
At the age of eleven, she passed what
is known as the "eleven plus" exam, a
test of mathematics, English, and general
knowledge. She referred to this exam as
one of the "academic hurdles of the
British educational system . . . every stu
dent would be terrified of it," because it
determined whether a child would attend
a grammar or comprehensive school. "It
really sets one on track for the rest of his
career," she said, "immediately estab
lishing the academic hierarchy in Great
Britain."
Fetter had a rigorous schooling in
London, and her second "academic
hurdle" came at fifteen with the National
Exams, a set of tests in nine "hardcore"
subjects, among them mathematics,
physics, chemistry, history, and geogra

phy. After these ordinary level exams,
when she was eighteen, she took her ad
vanced level tests in four subjects:
physics, chemistry, pure mathematics,
and applied mathematics. Essentially,
this determined admission to the univer
sities. Thus in Great Britain in the 19505,
a student had chosen his major by the
age of 16.
'My family always considered me un
usual. I was the first person in my family
to go to college,." she said. In 1956, she
went to Oxford to study physics. "At the
age of 10 or 11, mathematics was a very
important part of my life. And then, as I

waitress slicing cucumber sandwiches in Devonshire.

got a bit older, 14 or 15, I became more
interested in the application of mathe
matics. I took enormous pleasure in sol
ving mathematical problems." Fetter felt
the transition from coming from an all
female environment into a male
dominated one was difficult. There were
120 men and five women of her year
majoring in physics. "It was very tough. I
felt unprepared in some ways, and yet in
other ways, I think the intellectual stand
ards among women were much higher
because there were 10 times as many
men as women, and the competition for a
woman to get in was much more in
tense." Although at times she felt her
confidence was "a little nudged," she
was the only woman in her class to earn a
first-class degree.
After graduating from Oxford, she was
"absolutely awed" to be asked by her
tutor to stay on as a research assistant.
For three years she experimented in the
Oxford observatory working on the anal

ysis of sun spots. She planned on con
tinuing research until she met her hus
band, an American Rhodes scholar, who
was studying physics there as well. He
had noticed her in the laboratory, and
she found him "rather cute." They met
again on an Oxford-Cambridge ski trip
in Austria, for which she had saved
money by spending a summer as a
waitress slicing cucumber sandwiches in
a restaurant in Devonshire. They were
introduced by a mutual friend; he leaving
the doctor's office with a broken wrist,
she on her way to a skiing lesson. "It was
