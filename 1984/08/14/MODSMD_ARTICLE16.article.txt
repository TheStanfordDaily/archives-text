## Down the road with the merry Marguerite 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE 
Most people ride the Mar
guerite bus because it's there.
Few take the time to get to
know fellow passengers or the
drivers. Polite but removed,
riders enjoy the convenience of
the shuttle, with no thought to
who makes it run.
The 6'6" man in charge is
hard to overlook, but easy to
underestimate. Marguerite Su
pervisor Hugh Sledge,
nicknamed "Rusty" because of
his red-blond afro, has a lot to
do with the success of the new
Marguerite Shuttle Service.
Sledge's duties include
scheduling the hiring of new
drivers, keeping track of the
number of daily passengers,
relieving and replacing other
drivers, driving a regular route
trom 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., and
taking occasional complaints.
He executes these duties
quietly; so quietly, in fact, that
few passengers realize he's the
supervisor.
"I don't think most people
notice his air of authority," said
Kathleen Butterfield, a Stanford
graduate who often rides with
Rusty on her way to the Medical
Center. "He's very quiet, but
seems warm and friendly," she
added. "You have to look
closely (to pick up on) the tone
of command" that underlies his
interaction with the other
drivers.
A former manager at Macy's,
Butterfield cites Sledge's soft
spoken air of authority as "the
mark of a true manager." "He
does what he has to do," she
said. He exerts his authority
without being authoritative.
She has often heard him
"telling a driver he can t have a

day off," she added, "hut he lets
them know why, so they under
stand."
Sledge's quiet manner is a
sharp contrast to his muscular
255-pound frame. His bronze
hands dwarf the steering wheel.
As he grips the wheel to make a
turn, his arm muscles strain
beneath his white Marguerite
polo shirt. His size might make
one expect Sledge to be a gruff
tough guy. But his easy smile
and the sparkle in his green eyes
quickly shatter this expectation.
Deemed "a gentle giant" by
one rider, who added, "I'd trust
him to drive me anywhere,"
Sledge has worked for the St.
Clair Limousine Service, which
runs the Marguerite, since last
fall. He personally drove each
Marguerite bus up to Stanford
from Los Angeles, where they
were manufactured. Starting in
Sept. 1983, Sledge said he "flew
down every weekend and drove
one back."
When St. Clair hired him, the
29-year-old from Cleveland,
Ohio, had been working for the
Los Angeles County Disaster
Coordinating Center since
1977.
The center serves as the main
coordinating point for all major
incidents in L.A. County. Any
accident in which "more than
six people were injured, criti
cally or not. was considered
major," Sledge explained. He
and his co-workers coordinated
the movement of major accident
victims to local hospitals, giving
instructions to paramedics via
transmitters.
Sledge got his medical experi
ence during a two-year stint as a
medical service specialist in the
Air Force. Stroking his blond

beard thoughtfully, Sledge ad
mitted, "I sometimes wish I'd
stayed in the Air Force because
of the technology." In the Air
Force, he explained, "You're
allowed to do a lot medically
that you're not able to do in ci
vilian life."
When he left the service,
Sledge came to L.A and spent
six months studying for an
Emergency Medical Techni
cian's license. Only with an
E.M.T. license could he use his
military medical training. After
getting his license, Sledge went
to work for an ambulance com
pany for two years before get
ting involved with the Disaster
Control Center.
While he liked working at the

center because he could help
people, Sledge prefers his job
with the Marguerite. "It's more
satisfying," he said in his soft
tenor, "because of the certain
calmness about it." Pausing for
a moment to make eye contact,
he continued, "I dictate what
does and doesn't happen. That
makes it easier."
Sledge describes himself as a
"people person." "I feel more
comfortable out here driving
than sitting in an office with no
windows," he said, referring to
working conditions at his previ
ous job. For Sledge, meeting
people is the best part of his job.
"We get a lot of students on
the bus," said Sledge. He enjoys
"finding out what they're think

ing about," and getting "to
touch base with people who are
going through the education
process and choosing their
careers."
Much of Sledge's interest in
students stems from his desire to
begin his own education process
again. "I'd like to go back to
school to finish a degree in . . .
radio," he said. In L.A. he
worked for a studio doing
broadcasting and "thought
about getting into radio or TV."
Smiling wistfully, he
confessed, "I've always had this
goal ... By the time I'm 35 I'd
like to be partway through with
a degree. So, I've still got six

years.
Righ now, he said, "my fam
ily is my main priority." With a
wife (Jessica) and two sons
(Gabriel, 7; Joshua, 10), and a
job that keeps him busy 12
hours a day. Sledge hardly has
time for classes. He said there
would have to be "some major
change in my family life before 1
can get back to school."
Listening to him talk eagerly
abou 1 ! the future, it >ounds like

he believes "major change" is
not far off. "My wife feels I
should get back into radio," he
said, adding, "1 feel it's closer to
the time I should get back into
it." Goser, but not time yet.
Sledge is content to be Mar
guerite supervisor. "It's my first
turn at supervising," he said
proudly, "and I think myself
I've done a pretty good job."
The job has its drawbacks,
namely inconsiderate motorists,
bicyclists (most of whom Sledge
says "are oblivious to all traf
fic") and the poor enforcement
of parking regulations which
results in cars frequently

parking in designated Mar
guerite stops.
Despite the drawbacks,
Sledge plans to stay with his job
â€” for now. For him, like most
students of whom he speaks so
highly, Stanford is just one stop
on the road to his future. The
difference is that Sledge is in no
hurry to move on.
"I don't feel I'm too old or
that it's too late for me," he says
emphatically. He knows he'll
get back to radio eventually,
when the time is right. At the
moment, however, being Mar
guerite supervisor suits Rusty
Sledge just fine.
