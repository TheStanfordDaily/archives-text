## Schultz brothers win wrestling gold medals 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Stanford assistant wrestling
coaches Dave and Mark Schultz
both won gold medals in

freestyle wrestling, and assistant
track coach John Powell won a
bronze in the shot put as the
Games of the XXIIIrd Olym
piad came to a close last
weekend.
Dave Schultz defeated Martin

Knosp of West Germany, 3-1,
to win his gold medal at 163
pounds Friday in Anaheim.
Schultz had earlier defeated
Myung-Woo Han of South

Korea, 7-0, and pinned Saban
Sejdi of Yugoslavia to advance
to the final.
It was in a match against Sejdi
on Thursday that Dave Schultz
was accused of excessive
brutality. Schultz pinned Sejdi

in that match as well, but
twisted the Yugoslav's knee in
the process.
Mark Schultz won his gold
medal Saturday by a fall at 1:59
over Hideyuki Nagashima of
Japan to win the 180V2-pound
class. He had pinned Luciano
Ortelli of Italy at 1:36 in a semi
final match earlier in the day.
Mark Schultz had a scare on
his road to the final, though. In
his first match of the double
elimination tournament he had
pinned Resit Karabachak of
Turkey in 30 seconds, but he
broke Karabachak's elbow in

the process. The Turkish
delegation filed a protest that
was upheld, and Schultz was
stripped of his victory.
Powell threw the discus 214
feet, 9 inches, Friday in Los An
geles to finish behind Rolf Dan
neberg of West Germany and
Mac Wilkins of San Jose. Dan
neberg took the gold with a toss
of 218-6, while Wilkins was
second with an effort of 217-6.
For Powell it was his second
Olympic bronze medal. He also
finished third at Montreal in
1976. Powell said he was retir
ing after the Games, but said
there was a possibility that he

would change his mind.
The 37-year-old Cupertino
resident was not the only
thrower from Stanford at the
games. One of his charges,
Carol Cady, made the team in
the shot put. Cady was the high
est American finisher in the
event last week, placing seventh
overall.
Stanford students and
coaches combined to win a total
of three gold, three silver and
one bronze medal at these
Games. That is a medal total
exceeded by only 18 of the 140
nations in Los Angeles and a
gold medal count topped by 15.
