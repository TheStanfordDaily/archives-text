# Bill will block Streleski parole

### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
The Senate passed legislation
last Thursday aimed at preventing
the parole of Theodore Streleski, a
tormer Stanford graduate student
in mathematics who killed Mathe
matics Professor Karel deLeeuw in
1978.
Streleski, 48, was paroled last
March after serving five-and-one
half years of an eight-year prison
term. He was immediately taken
back into custody when he an
nounced he would not seek psychi
atric counseling nor stay away
from the Bay Area, the two condi
tions of his parole.
Last Thursday's legislation was
the combination of two initial
proposals by Assembyman Pat
Nolan (R-Glendale) and a
"Streleski Amendment" added
when Nolan considered the
Streleski case.

The two original proposals were
that the Parole Board had to con
sider "public outcry" when setting
up parole for any criminal, and
that the governor should have full
review of any parole decision.
After the March Streleski episode,
Nolan added a third proposal.
"We decided that if a prisoner
openly says he will not agree to the
terms of his parole, it should be
possible for the Parole Board to
revoke his parole â€” they shouldn't
have to release him and then re
arrest and re-book him when he
refuses to cooperate," said Judy
Verhaag, an aide to Sen. Nolan.
"This parole refusal could occur
every six months, up to the end of
a determinate prison sentence."
According to Verhaag, the bill
has a "99.999" percent chance of
being enacted into law. "We've
had overwhelming support all
along," he explained. Verhaag said
Gov. Deukmejian helped draft the
bill.
Jeff Brown, the San Francisco
Public Defender, said Streleski's
case pointed out problems with the
parole system, but that Nolan's
legislation was not the final solu
tion. He pointed out that Streleski
could only be imprisoned for an
other two-and-one-half years, the
end of his determinate sentence.
