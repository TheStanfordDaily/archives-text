# Thoughts after watching two weeks of the Olympics
## 
### 
After watching nine Olympic
soccer matches in person and
countless hours of Olympic
coverage on ABC, I have made
some observations and asked
some questions about the past
two weeks. Here goes.
* * *
The match here between
Brazil and West Germany was
probably one of the finest
played on American soil. The
teams were evenly matched, the
game was well-played, and it

Not Just
a Game
John Lis

was exciting despite the fact that
there was no score in the first 87
minutes.
In fact, Gilmar's goal ruined
the game somewhat for me. I
dislike ties, especially scoreless
ones, but this game seemed to
deserve to end in one. It was
certainly a game that West Ger
many did not deserve to lose.
* * *
It's too bad Brazil lost to
France in the final. After three
games here, I was beginning to
appreciate the Brazilian side. I
have no idea who the French
team is.
♦ * *
Bernd Franke is an awesome
athlete. The only goal the West
German goalkeeper allowed in
three games here was on Gil

mar's free kick, and I don't
think anyone on this planet
could have stopped that. Other
wise, Franke was perfect. Jack
Elway should try to recruit him.
The man has got hands.
My No. 2 favorite is Canadian
keeper Tino Lettieri. In their
only game here, Canada hung
even with Brazil through 120
minutes before losing it on
penalty kicks. Lettieri is tough.
* * *
The folks who organized the
Games here did an awesome
job. There seemed to be no
major problems outside of the
usual traffic tie-ups, and they
were most helpful even through
the long days and nights.
* * *
ABC did a pathetic job of
covering Olympic Soccer. They
showed about 15 minutes of the
semifinal game here, going on
the air after 10 p.m. here. That's
after midnight in over 80 per
cent of the country. Then they
showed less than 15 minutes of
the final at 11 p.m. here. That's
after 2 a.m. in over half the
country. Any hope of Olympic
exposure helping soccer in the
United States was shot to hell.
* * *
U.S. Olympic Soccer Coach
Alkis Panagoulias had said the
American team hoped to help
the sport gain popularity in this
country. I doubt it did. The
team didn't win a medal and
ABC didn't help matters. I'll bet
most kids in America still don't
know who Rick Davis is.
Panagoulias also said that the
United States is the only

country where soccer is not the
most popular sport. I told this to
some baseball fans from Japan.
They almost laughed in my face.
I've seen soccer at its best,
and I hate to tell Alkis this, but
football is still a more entertain
ing game. I've been hearing for
15 years that soccer will be
more popular than football in
10 years. I'm still waiting and I
don't see it happening. It's just
not as good a game.
I'm curious what the large
crowds here and at the Rose
Bowl mean. Has soccer finally
arrived as a major sport in
America? Is California a soccer
hotbed? Or are there just a lot
of people who want to see the
Olympics and couldn't care less
if the San Jose/Phoenix
Earthquakes survive?
* * *
Will critics please stop calling
ABC's coverage overly
American-biased. I know I
cared more about how
Americans did than how ath
letes from Liechtenstein did
(San Jose Mercury News
coverage notwithstanding). I'm
glad ABC made an effort to
show them.
I'm also sick of hearing how
pro-American crowds were jin
goistic. It's simply a case of
looking for something to iden
tify with. In a race, about the
only thing I have in common
with any of the competitors is
that one of them is also an
American.
* * *~
To an even greater degree, I
suppose, seeing Stanford stu

dents at the Games gave those
of us here that same feeling that
we could identify with someone.
Granted that this does not make
Stanford a superior school —
that is the result of other factors
— but it is nice to see someone
you know win an Olympic
medal.
* * *
I really don't think that fans
chanting "U.S.A." at events
were being overly obnoxious.
No one started any fights with
foreign visitors that I'm aware
of, and I don't remember
anyone chanting "Egypt sucks"
at a soccer game here. In these
respects it was calmer than a
Cleveland-Pittsburgh football
game.
* * *
When will people stop com
paring Carl Lewis to Jesse
Owens? What Lewis did in
these Games is an amazing feat.
The man is truly an awesome
athlete.
* * ♦
Can anyone blame Mary
Decker for being angry at Zola
Budd? All she has done is yell at
Budd and complain to the
media, who are making her out
to be a crybaby. At least she
didn't punch out Budd. That's
probably what I would have
done. I commend her for her
restraint.
♦ * *
Decathalon champion Daley
Thompson is totally cool and
would be rich here if he were
American.
* * *
Why did ABC choose crucial

moments of an event to show
commercials? Don't feel
like not watching any of the new
ABC shows just to spite them
for those stupid promos? Why
did they run 15 minutes of
credits while I was trying to
watch the Closing Ceremonies?
Did you realize ABC ran 90
minutes of promos for "Call To
Glory"? Last night's episode
was only two hours. This is
called ridiculous.
» ♦ *
Wonder what FIFA stands
for? It's the Federation Inter
nationale de Footbali Associa
tion, the governing body of soc
cer. Translated that's the Inter
national Federation of Associa
tion Football.
That's right, association foot
ball. That's to distinguish it from
Rugby football, American foot
ball, Canadian football and
Australian rules football. The
rest of the world shortened it to
football, but we took the ab
breviation "assoc.", played with
it, and came up with soccer.
Aren't you glad you asked?
* * ♦
Don't you sometimes feel like
becoming a citizen of some
really obscure country and
learning how to shoot skeet so
you could at least be at the
Olympics?
* * *
1988 is only four years away.
Thank God Olympiads are four
years. I don't think I could deal
with the Games more often then
that.

glad ABC made an effort to
show them.
I'm also sick of hearing how
pro-American crowds were jin
goistic. It's simply a case of
looking for something to iden
tify with. In a race, about the
only thing I have in common
with any of the competitors is
that one of them is also an
American.

To an even greater degree, I
suppose, seeing Stanford stu

dents at the Games gave those
of us here that same feeling that
we could identify with someone.
Granted that this does not make
Stanford a superior school —
that is the result of other factors
— but it is nice to see someone
you know win an Olympic
medal.

I really don't think that fans
chanting "U.S.A." at events
were being overly obnoxious.
No one started any fights with
foreign visitors that I'm aware
of, and I don't remember
anyone chanting "Egypt sucks"
at a soccer game here. In these
respects it was calmer than a
Cleveland-Pittsburgh football
game.

When will people stop com

Can anyone blame Mary
Decker for being angry at Zola
Budd? All she has done is yell at
Budd and complain to the
media, who are making her out
to be a crybaby. At least she
didn't punch out Budd. That's
probably what I would have
done. I commend her for her
restraint.

Why did ABC choose crucial

moments of an event to show
commercials? Don't feel
like not watching any of the new
ABC shows just to spite them
for those stupid promos? Why
did they run 15 minutes of
credits while I was trying to
watch the Closing Ceremonies?
Did you realize ABC ran 90
minutes of promos for "Call To
Glory"? Last night's episode
was only two hours. This is
called ridiculous.

Wonder what FIFA stands
for? It's the Federation Inter

That's right, association foot
ball. That's to distinguish it from
Rugby football, American foot
ball, Canadian football and
Australian rules football. The
rest of the world shortened it to
football, but we took the ab
breviation "assoc.", played with
it, and came up with soccer.

1988 is only four years away.
Thank God Olympiads are four
years. I don't think I could deal
with the Games more often then
that.
After watching nine Olympic
soccer matches in person and
countless hours of Olympic
coverage on ABC, I have made
some observations and asked
some questions about the past
two weeks. Here goes.
* * *
The match here between
Brazil and West Germany was
probably one of the finest
played on American soil. The
teams were evenly matched, the
game was well-played, and it

Not Just
a Game
John Lis

was exciting despite the fact that
there was no score in the first 87
minutes.
In fact, Gilmar's goal ruined
the game somewhat for me. I
dislike ties, especially scoreless
ones, but this game seemed to
deserve to end in one. It was
certainly a game that West Ger
many did not deserve to lose.
* * *
It's too bad Brazil lost to
France in the final. After three
games here, I was beginning to
appreciate the Brazilian side. I
have no idea who the French
team is.
♦ * *
Bernd Franke is an awesome
athlete. The only goal the West
German goalkeeper allowed in
three games here was on Gil

mar's free kick, and I don't
think anyone on this planet
could have stopped that. Other
wise, Franke was perfect. Jack
Elway should try to recruit him.
The man has got hands.
My No. 2 favorite is Canadian
keeper Tino Lettieri. In their
only game here, Canada hung
even with Brazil through 120
minutes before losing it on
penalty kicks. Lettieri is tough.
* * *
The folks who organized the
Games here did an awesome
job. There seemed to be no
major problems outside of the
usual traffic tie-ups, and they
were most helpful even through
the long days and nights.
* * *
ABC did a pathetic job of
covering Olympic Soccer. They
showed about 15 minutes of the
semifinal game here, going on
the air after 10 p.m. here. That's
after midnight in over 80 per
cent of the country. Then they
showed less than 15 minutes of
the final at 11 p.m. here. That's
after 2 a.m. in over half the
country. Any hope of Olympic
exposure helping soccer in the
United States was shot to hell.

U.S. Olympic Soccer Coach
Alkis Panagoulias had said the
American team hoped to help
the sport gain popularity in this
country. I doubt it did. The
team didn't win a medal and
ABC didn't help matters. I'll bet
most kids in America still don't
know who Rick Davis is.
Panagoulias also said that the
United States is the only

country where soccer is not the
most popular sport. I told this to
some baseball fans from Japan.
They almost laughed in my face.
I've seen soccer at its best,
and I hate to tell Alkis this, but
football is still a more entertain
ing game. I've been hearing for
15 years that soccer will be
more popular than football in
10 years. I'm still waiting and I
don't see it happening. It's just
not as good a game.
I'm curious what the large
crowds here and at the Rose
Bowl mean. Has soccer finally
arrived as a major sport in
America? Is California a soccer
hotbed? Or are there just a lot
of people who want to see the
Olympics and couldn't care less
if the San Jose/Phoenix
Earthquakes survive?
* * *
Will critics please stop calling
ABC's coverage overly
American-biased. I know I
cared more about how
Americans did than how ath
letes from Liechtenstein did
(San Jose Mercury News
coverage notwithstanding). I'm
glad ABC made an effort to
show them.
I'm also sick of hearing how
pro-American crowds were jin
