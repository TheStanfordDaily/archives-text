## 'Nerds' get a taste of sweet revenge 
### 
Everyone knows what a nerd
is. Generally wearing high
waisted polyester pants and cal
culators on their belts, they of
ten have thick glasses, un
combed hair, and can be spotted
picking their nose in public.
For such things nerds have al
ways been put down, teased and

Carradine proves that nerds are really not
all that nerdy, throughout the film. When
he explains to Betty thai jock* only think
about sports, while nerds become sex gods,
and at the film's end when he calls out to
all who have ever felt excludedleft-out, or
unaccepted.

just plain made fun of. But
nerds have never hurt anyone,
and they are certainly respon
sible for much of modern com
puter technology. Perhaps un
deserving of such long estab
lished abuse, nerds have always
stood back, and silently taken it.
Until now, that is.
Revenge of the Nerds is a

movie about nerds who fight
back and ultimately win. Di
rected by Jeff Karnow, and
produced by Ted Field and
Peter Samuelson, Revenge of
the Nerds tells the story of two
nerds â€” Lewis Skolnick,
(Robert Carradine) and his best
friend Gilbert, (Anthony Ed
wards) who become the prime

emancipators of their fellow
nerds at Adams College. Before
their arrival at Adams, the nerds
have dreams of sex, college wo
men and a better social life.
Their illusions are quickly
shattered, when, upon acciden
tally stumbling into a wild fra
ternity party at the Alpha Betas,
Lewis and Gilbert are immedi

ately branded 'NERD' and
laughed out of the frat.
With usual nerd luck. Lewis,
Gilbert and the other freshmen
are forced to live in the gym,
after the Alpha Betas burn
down their own house and take

over the freshman dorm.
The nerds are of course
rejected during fraternity rush,
and find themselves sharing
their beds with the basketball
team. Led chiefly by Carradine,
the motley crew find themselves
a dilapidated house and trans
form it into their own fraternity.
They are accepted by the na
tional chapter of an all-black
fraternity, and the revenge
really begins when the Alpha
Betas ruin their first fraternity
party.
The nerds retaliate by leading
a panty-raid on the Pi sorority,
and by placing video cameras at
strategic locations in the girls'
rooms. They finally gain control
of the Greek Council by win
ning the annual Homecoming
Carnival, and usurp the rule of
the Alpha Betas.

Skolnick, albeit a nerd, has the
confidence to approach the
most sought-after Pi sorority
giri, Betty, (Julie Montgomery)
and ultimately wins her over
with his superior lovemaking
ability. Carradine proves that
nerds are really not all that
nerdy, throughout the film. This
happens first when he explains
to Betty that jocks only think
about sports, while nerds
become sex gods; and also at the
film's end when he calls out to
all of those who "have ever felt
excluded, left-out or unac
cepted." The film ends
seriously, as most of the crowd
joins the self-acknowledged
nerds on the field. The first to
join is love-struck Betty, and by
stealing stud Alpha Beta


Lewis and Gilbert
are two outcasts
who turn the
tables on their
oppressors.
