Explosive aboard bus with
Olympians' bags defused
I *>s Angeles — A sharp-eyed poliee officer dis
covered a pipe bomb aboard a bus carrying the
baggage of the Turkish Olympic team yesterday and
disarmed it moments before it was to explode, auth
orities said.
The discovery of the bomb and threats from
"kooks" who heard about it forced the evacuation
of about 6000 people from three terminals at Los
Angeles International Airport, police said.
The athletes had already gone into the terminal
when the bomb was discovered, and there were no
injuries, said Police Chief Daryl Gates. He said
several Olympic security guards were aboard the
bus, adding that the device could have caused
"severe damage."
Officer Jim Pearson "was checking around the
area and noticed something shiny that shouldn't
have been there," Gates said. He did not say where
the device was found.
Police Officer John Weick described the device as
a cylindrical object with what appeared to be a
timer, about eight inches long and about five inches
in diameter.
The officer carried the pipe bomb to the tarmac,
put it down and pulled some wires loose "and ran,"
apparently successfully disarming it, the chief added.
The bomb squad disposed of the device.
Gann launches initiative
to cut Legislative pay
Sacramento — Political activist Paul Gann, ired at
lawmakers for resisting his Proposition 24, launched
an initiative drive yesterday to restore the part-time
legislative system that existed before 1967.
Legislators, primarily Democrats, balked at fully
implementing Proposition 24, an initiative voters
approved June 5 that requires a 30 percent cut in the
Legislature's budget and rule changes that increase
Republican power. Democrats say they'll make the
spending cuts, but consider the rule changes uncon
stitutional.
Gann said his new initiative, which he hopes to
qualify for the June 1986 ballot, would cut the time
lawmakers spend in Sacramento, slash their salaries
and retirement benefits, and restrict them to a total
of eight consecutive years in office.
The measure was quickly condemned by leaders
of the Legislature, where similar proposals intro
duced by conservative lawmakers have failed.
During a Capitol news conference, Gann said
people are "angry and upset" over a Legislature
they feel is "controlled by special interests." The
measure would allow lawmakers to spend more time
at home, learning constituent's concerns, he added.

The measure also would make it a felony to
prevent initiatives from being implemented, unless
they are found unconstitutional by the courts or
clash with federal law.
Hatfield gives money away
Portland, Ore. — Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.),
saying he had made an "error in judgment," joined
his wife yesterday in turning over $55,000 to
charity, the same amount Antoinette Hatfield
received from a Greek businessman whose trans-
Africa pipeline the senator promoted. Hatfield, now
campaigning for re-election to his fourth term in the
Senate, blamed his mistake on his "insensitivity to
the appearance of impropriety."
At a news conference, Hatfield and his wife
denied any direct connection between the latter's
real estate work on behalf of Basil Tsakos and the
senator's help in supporting Tsakos' proposal to
construct a pipeline from Saudi Arabia across the
Sudan, the Central African Republic and
Cameroon.
The Justice Department has launched a criminal
investigation into allegations linking the money
Antoinette Hatfield received with the senator's
backing of the proposed $12 billion, privately
financed pipeline. The Senate Ethics Committee is
also reviewing the case.
In retrospect, Hatfield said he and his wife should
have discussed the potential for conflict of interest at
the time, and that she should have cut off her busi
ness relationship with Tsakos and accepted no fees.
Index falls 2.2 percent
Sacramento — An index that measures economic
activity in California dropped 2.2 percent in May,
the state Finance Department said yesterday.
The California Index of Leading Economic In
dicators fell from 142.8 points in April to 139.7
points in May, the department said.
The index had been climbing steadily for 17
months, then, beginning in January, has flattened
out near the peak, with average readings of 140.2
points.
Finance Director Jesse Huff said the leveling off
of the indicators is a sign that the economy could be
entering a transitional phase, possibly leading to a
more moderate growth rate.
All of the eight components of the index
weakened in May. New housing permit authoriza
tions fell 6.5 percent, reflecting rising interest rates.
Help wanted ads fell 6.4 percent. Average weekly
hours in manufacturing dropped 2 percent.
Overtime hours in manufacturing fell 2.9 percent.
Stock market prices dropped .6 percent. Crude ma
terials prices fell .5 percent. New business incor
porations fell .4 percent. Initial claims for un
employment insurance rose .3 percent.

Bomb threat interrupts
De Lorean deliberation
Los Angeles — Jurors in the John De Lorean trial
were abruptly pulled from their deliberations yester
day as the trial judge ordered evacuation of the
entire U.S. Courthouse because of a bomb threat.
No bomb was found, and the evacuation ended
about one-and-a-half hours after it began.
U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi, in his
capacity as acting chief judge in the absence of
Judge Manuel Real, ordered the evacuation at about
9:50 a.m. PDT, shortly after a courthouse clerk
received a telephone call from a man demanding
legalization of marijuana and cocaine, chief Deputy
U.S. Marshal Sam Cicchino said..
A clerk for Takasugi, who is presiding over the De
Lorean case, said jurors were not told about the
evacuation but were merely taken to a waiting van
and driven to an early lunch. They returned after
eating and resumed their deliberations.
The 59-year-old automaker was across town at his
lawyers' office hoping for word of a verdict when the
incident occurred.
An estimated 1500 people, including prisoners
awaiting court appearances, were ushered out of the
courthouse by police, U.S. marshals and officers of
the Federal Protective Service following the 9:15
a.m. telephone threat, police Officer Sergio Diaz
said.
Tax proposal for foreign
firms sent to Senate
Sacramento — Gov. George Deukmejian's tax
break for multinational corporations was sent to the
Senate floor yesterday after it was stripped of a tax
increase that would have partly offset the state reve
nue loss.
The measure, SB 1437 by Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-
San Jose), cleared the Senate Finance Committee on
a 10-1 vote, despite claims that it would give
foreign-based companies an advantage over domes
tic firms.
The bill would give multinational companies that
operate in the state the option of excluding their
overseas activities from information used to
compute their California taxes.
Under current law, a corporation's California
taxes are based on a so-called "unitary method" —
the percentage of its sales, payroll and property in
the state. Critics, led by foreign corporations, claim
the unitary method discourages investment in Cali
fornia because it sometimes forces companies to pay
taxes here on profits earned elsewhere, particularly
when new California plants operate at a loss.
Deukmejian's proposal would create a "water's
edge" option for corporations, allowing them to in
clude or exclude foreign sales, payroll and property
from California tax computation.
