# Hospital retains rates for most services
## 
### SHIRISH DATE 
The average daily care rate will rise
8.3 percent at Stanford University
Hospital in 1984-85, but nearly half of
the expected 20,000 patients will experi
ence no rise in their nursing bills.
David Sakai, the hospital's director of
finance, attributed this seeming paradox
to the hospital's attempt to create a more
accurate "cost for service" pricing
structure. With the current price
structure, patients requiring minimal
nursing services are helping defray the
cost for patients needing more than
average nursing care.

"People receiving lesser amounts of
nursing care shouldn't be subsidizing
those needing above average care," he
said.
To combat this inequity, the hospital
will create a new rate category for
patients requiring more than six hours of
nursing a day. Beginning Sept. 1, these
patients will pay $548 per day for gen
eral nursing service.
At present they are charged the same
amount — $362 per day in a ward, $384
in a semi-private room and $438 daily in
a private room — as patients requiring
less than six hours of service a day. This

second rate category will have no rate in
crease in 1984-85.
Sakai said about 50 percent of the
hospital's patients fell into this second,
lower-care rate.
Rates for ancillary services — X-rays,
laboratory tests, etc. — would rise an
average of 7.9 percent, he added.
The new rate category is only one
aspect of the $184.9 million operating
budget for 1984-85. The new budget,
approved Aug. 9 by the Board of Hospi
tal Directors, represents a net increase of
8.3 percent over 1983-84's budget of
$170.7 million, said Sheldon King, the

hospital's director i vice
president.
In addition to h iti ent-care
rates, the higher » .i-ci earmarks $6.1
million for equipment additions and
other capital improvements.
