# Olympics close with fanfare

### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Daily staff 
Los Angeles — Sunday
evening began with hors
d'oeuvres at the First Inter
state Bank — one of the
three major sponsors of
the now gone-with-the-
Olympics flame — and a
congratulatory handshake
with Doug Burke, a member
of the silver medal-winning
U.S. water polo team and a
1979 Stanford graduate.
Asked if losing the gold to
the Yugoslavian team was
somewhat of a letdown,
Burke said, "I can't say that
it's a disappointment ... It
was just great to be here in
LA participating in the
Games."
The silver medalist was
also careful to point out that
he had an especially good
time because three of his
Olympic teammates were
also former members of the
Stanford water polo team.
Burke works for First In
terstate in a "job opportuni
ties" program, as do Stan
ford graduates — now silver
medalists — Jody Campbell
('79), Drew Macdonnal ('77)
and Chris Dorst ( 77). Dorst
also received his MBA from
Stanford in 1982.
Burke was accompanied

by his fiancee, Candy Costie,
a gold medalist in the first
ever Olympic pairs
synchronized swimming
competition.
John Naber, a four-time
swimming gold medalist in
the 1976 Montreal Games,
praised the bank's hiring of
16 Olympic competitors.
Later, at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, crowds filed in
early in anticipation of the
closing ceremonies.
Outside the stadium, lines
at concession stands were of
ten 15 people deep.
Police officials said they
were surprised by the
decrease in crime during the
games.
Commander William
Booth of the Los Angeles
Police Department was
pleased with the lack of
crime around the various
Olympic sites, but noted that
the Games were not entirely
The greatest
number of thefts occurred at
the USC Olympic village.
Despite the occasional
problems, most officials
agreed that the Los Angeles
Olympics were a big success
overall.
