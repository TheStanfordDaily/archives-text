# Olympics close with fanfare
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Daily staff 
Los Angeles — Sunday
evening began with hors
d'oeuvres at the First Inter
state Bank — one of the
three major sponsors of
the now gone-with-the-
Olympics flame — and a
congratulatory handshake
with Doug Burke, a member
of the silver medal-winning
U.S. water polo team and a
1979 Stanford graduate.
Asked if losing the gold to
the Yugoslavian team was
somewhat of a letdown,
Burke said, "I can't say that
it's a disappointment ... It
was just great to be here in
LA participating in the
Games."
The silver medalist was
also careful to point out that
he had an especially good
time because three of his
Olympic teammates were
also former members of the
Stanford water polo team.
Burke works for First In
terstate in a "job opportuni
ties" program, as do Stan
ford graduates — now silver
medalists — Jody Campbell
('79), Drew Macdonnal ('77)
and Chris Dorst ( 77). Dorst
also received his MBA from
Stanford in 1982.
Burke was accompanied

by his fiancee, Candy Costie,
a gold medalist in the first
ever Olympic pairs
synchronized swimming
competition.
John Naber, a four-time
swimming gold medalist in
the 1976 Montreal Games,
praised the bank's hiring of
16 Olympic competitors.
Later, at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, crowds filed in
early in anticipation of the
closing ceremonies.
Outside the stadium, lines
at concession stands were of
ten 15 people deep.
Police officials said they
were surprised by the
decrease in crime during the
games.
Commander William
Booth of the Los Angeles
Police Department was
pleased with the lack of
crime around the various
Olympic sites, but noted that
the Games were not entirely
The greatest
number of thefts occurred at
the USC Olympic village.
Despite the occasional
problems, most officials
agreed that the Los Angeles
Olympics were a big success
overall.
California Attorney Gen
era! John VanDekamp said
the Games had a positive ef
fect on the city's self-image.
The Olympics "gave them
some pride they didn't have
before," he said.
VanDeKamp added,
"(Mayor) Tom Bradley is a
great hero. He made the city
commercially more attractive
and there was a feeling of
friendliness."
The Attorney General said
the Olympics produced "a
golden summer." Van-
Dekamp was particularly im
pressed with private indus
try's contributions to the
Games. He believes Los An
geles has set a valuable prec
edent by using industry and
business to fund the Olym
pics.
Inside the stadium, spec
tators had to wait
through the marathon's
awards presentation and an
other ceremony for
equestrian medal-winners
before the official closing
ceremonies began.
In the center of the field
was placed a small orchestra
that played various quiet
pieces. At the end of the field
below the scoreboard was
the All-American marching
band comprised of
musicians from colleges
across the country.
They were there to enter
tain the crowd before the
real excitement began.
A spaceship, reminiscent

of the one in the film Close
Encounters, approached the
stadium, flashing intricate
light patterns at the
Coliseum crowd. A
loudspeaker responded to
signals from the spaceship. It
was apparently a signal of
friendship being sent to Los
Angeles and the entire
world.
After that, the fireworks
began. The colors ranged
from gold, silver, pink and
red to orange and different
shades of blue. Some spec
tators were frustrated by the
deafening noise and the fact
that their necks had to be
turned toward the
scoreboard in order to see
the fireworks.
The Coliseum was brightly
lit in silver blue by flashlights
that had been handed out to
the spectators. Many present
speculated that the show
ended early because al
though the flashlights were
equipped to shine silver and
red in addition to blue, only
the blue color was used.
Many were disappointed
when the spaceship flew
away rather than coming
close to the Coliseum and
landing on the field.
The closing ceremonies
were memorable, but did not
equal the excitement of the
opening ceremonies two
weeks earlier.
Los Angeles has always
been a city for graffiti. But
what the Olympic athletes
added to a bulletin board at
use — CITIUS, ALTIUS,
FORTIUS — will most likely
not be washed away.
