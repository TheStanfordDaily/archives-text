The first phase of the Network for Student In
formation (NSI) will soon be completed, and with
it will come an important step toward centraliza
tion of the University's many computer systems.
With completion scheduled for the end of fall
quarter, this phase will involve centralizing stu
dent data on applications, registration, financial
aid, housing and other topics — integrating all
student information onto the University's IBM
3081 mainframe computer.
"NSI describes a relationship between Univer

handling student information," said Sally
Mahoney, registrar and chair of the Governance
group tor this project. "We've been working as a
group for three years."
MSI is a partner with Information Technology
Services (ITS), which supplies the computer
know-how for this move of the student database

to a new environment. Student information will
soon be easily accessible to staff who maintain and
process information.
In other words, data will be centered in the
mainframe computer, and all information will be
electronically transferred. This system is more ef
ficient, because it avoids paper-shuffling between
administrative departments which require similar
information.
The visible changes are few, however, because
phase one is calculated to lay the groundwork for
a more extensive integration of schools and de
partments — phase two — in 1985.
"Phase one is laying a foundation," said
Mahoney, "sort of like taking an old Victorian
house and repositioning the foundations. People
can Jrive by and say that nothing's happening be
cause they cant see anything. But it's the most
important part."
