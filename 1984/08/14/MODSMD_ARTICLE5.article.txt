The first phase of the Network for Student In
formation (NSI) will soon be completed, and with
it will come an important step toward centraliza
tion of the University's many computer systems.
With completion scheduled for the end of fall
quarter, this phase will involve centralizing stu
dent data on applications, registration, financial
aid, housing and other topics — integrating all
student information onto the University's IBM
3081 mainframe computer.
"NSI describes a relationship between Univer
sity offices who have the common interest of
handling student information," said Sally
Mahoney, registrar and chair of the Governance
group tor this project. "We've been working as a
group for three years."
MSI is a partner with Information Technology
Services (ITS), which supplies the computer
know-how for this move of the student database

to a new environment. Student information will
soon be easily accessible to staff who maintain and
process information.
In other words, data will be centered in the
mainframe computer, and all information will be
electronically transferred. This system is more ef
ficient, because it avoids paper-shuffling between
administrative departments which require similar
information.
The visible changes are few, however, because
phase one is calculated to lay the groundwork for
a more extensive integration of schools and de
partments — phase two — in 1985.
"Phase one is laying a foundation," said
Mahoney, "sort of like taking an old Victorian
house and repositioning the foundations. People
can Jrive by and say that nothing's happening be
cause they cant see anything. But it's the most
important part."
The next step — to include schools and depart


ments in this network for electronic trans
fer/sharing of information — will be akin to
renovating that old Victorian structure, Mahoney
continued.
The one significant "new piece" to this system
is the computer support for graduate admissions,
which the NSI mutual effort built "from scratch,"
said Mahoney.
Graduate applications were previously handled
by the Graduate Admissions office sending indi
vidual applications to specific departments and
relying on them to put together the student infor
mation.
Other improvements include being able to print
foreign permanent addresses in the 1984-85 Stu
dent Directory; prior to NSl's work, for example,
a student from Taiwan would only get her city and

country printed, while U.S. addresses would be
listed in full.
Phase two is planned for the '85-'B6 school
year, and the concept behind it is school and de
partment access to student data. This summer the
Law School has been serving as the pilot program
for this part of the project.
Mahoney said the pilot program allows "trial
and error" on a manageable scale, and many of
the operating differences — "new ways of or
chestrating and scheduling" — will further hone
the plans of phase two.
One of the second phase goals is the "net bill,"
said Mahoney. This is one bill to students, listing
the amount of tuition required, less grants or
loans, and the net amount out of the student's
pocket.
"We hope to be able to give you (one) docu
ment . . . the whole deferment process will
change," said Mahoney. "But that is next year
('85)," she emphasized. For now there is the
steady work of phase one.
