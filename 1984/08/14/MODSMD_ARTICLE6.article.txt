### 
Cairo, Kgypt (AP) — 1 he Soviet Union and Iran yes
terday accused the United States of exploiting the ex
plosions in the Red Sea to expand its military presence
in the region, while Egypt's president said he thinks
Libya laid mines in the sea lanes.
In the latest report of a mine attack, Lloyd's of Lon
don's Shipping Intelligence Department said "a reliable
source said the 633-ton Soviet fish-carrier Bastion
hit a mine" Aug. 6 — one of 16 vessels hit so far.
Four British mine-hunters will start searching for
mines in the Gulf of Suez tomorrow, the British Em
bassy in Cairo said. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said
tour U.S. Sea Stallion minesweeping helicopters were
clue to reach the Red Sea aboard the transport
Shreveport by midweek, as requested by the Egyptian
government.
Two French minesweepers and a support vessel were
also en route to the Gulf of Suez to join in the interna

tionai effort at Egypt's request. Italy is considering sen
ding help.
Pentagon sources and a Saudi Arabian government
spokesman said three other Sea Stallion helicopters
were being sent to Saudi Arabia at the request of the
Saudi government.
In Moscow, Soviet commentator Vladimir
Nakaryakov charged in an article for the government
news agency Novosti that the United States was behind
the explosions because it wants to "turn the Red Sea
into an American lake."
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the
sending of U.S. gunships and helicopters to hunt for
mines gave the United States "a reinforced presence in
the region."
Newspapers in Kuwait voiced suspicions that the
United States was to blame.
'There is no one else with vested interest in pouring

oil on the burning fire of the Middle East other than the
United States," wrote the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-
Watan. The radical Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Rai Al-Aam
cautioned against foreign intervention and called on the
U.N. Security Council instead to step in.
At a news conference in Cairo, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak said: "I believe the Libyans did it, but
until now we are waiting to find a mine to confirm our
suspicions.
Roger Lowes, a spokesman for Lloyd's Shipping In
telligence, said he had no word of casualties aboard the
Soviet ship Bastion, but that a second Soviet ship was
nearby to give assistance.
Lowes said the 16 damaged vessels were: two each
registered in the Soviet Union, Liberia and China, and
one each registered in Panama, Japan, Spain, Cyprus,
Bahamas, Greece, Turkey, East Germany, North
Korea and Poland.
