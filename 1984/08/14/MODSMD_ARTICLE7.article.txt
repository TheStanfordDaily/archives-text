# Court aids Reagan move to trim benefits
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — A Supreme Court
justice, granting a Reagan administration
request aimed at cutting federal spend
ing, suspended a ruling yesterday that
could have meant millions of dollars in
added welfare benefits to thousands of
recipients.
Justice William Rehnquist blocked an
appeals court ruling that the administra
tion said is providing 45,000 California
families each with an average of $83 a
month more than Congress intended
when it approved budget cuts in 1981.
Rehnquist's action was taken Friday
hut n«»t announced until yesterday.
Department lawyers asked
t,y a.euing thai a
law I 1 undent Reagan on July
suj •/i v .ministration's inter
pretativ j Uare benefit dispute.
The new a .. <ns a mixed bag of

tax increases and spending cuts intended
to trin* about 10 percent of the $600 bil
lion in federal budget deficits expected
through 1987.
The full Supreme Court is to consider
the dispute when its 1984-85 term begins
in October. At issue is the method for
calculating the income of recipients of
Aid for Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC).
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled last year that the income figure
used should be net income, after deduc
tions are made for federal, state and local
taxes and Social Security.
But the administration argues that
Congress, when it approved budget cuts
in 1981, intended that AFDC payments
be based on gross income — before the
deductions.

Under the administration's interpreta
tion, recipients would receive less aid be
cause their incomes would be higher.
California officials said the 9th Circuit
court ruling costs the state about $2.6
million each month in added benefits.
The Justice Department, citing new
evidence of Congress' intent in the defi
cit reduction law signed by Reagan, re
quested that the appeals court ruling be
suspended pending the high court's ul
timate decision.
The administration said the new law
makes it clear that gross income should
be the basis for calculating earnings
when determining eligibility for aid.
State officials, siding with the adminis
tration, said a congressional report ac
companying the new deficit reduction
law states "the 9th Circuit was wrong.
No amount of fancy footwork can avoid

that conclusion."
At stake could be millions of dollars in
benefits to AFDC recipients not only in
California but also in Arizona, Nevada,
Oregon, Washington state, Hawaii,
Alaska, Idaho and Montana. The 9th
Circuit court has jurisdiction in all those
states.
The administration has said that if the
appeals court ruling was applied
nationwide it would mean an added $57
million a year for AFDC recipients.
Saying the government had made "a
compelling case" for temporarily halting
the increased payments, Rehnquist said,
"I conclude that without a stay the gov
ernment will suffer irreparable injury."
He said he was convinced the Reagan
administration and California state offi
cials would win their case before the full
Supreme Court.
