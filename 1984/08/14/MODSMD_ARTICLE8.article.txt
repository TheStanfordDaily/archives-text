# Mondale attacks Reagan's radio remarks, tax plan
## 
### 
Minneapolis (AP) â€” Walter
Mondale said yesterday he ac
cepts that President Reagan's
remarks about bombing the So
viet Union were intended as a
joke, but cautioned "words like
those live."
At a news conference, the
Democratic presidential
nominee also said he sees no
problems arising because run
ning mate Geraldine Ferraro's
husband has declined to release
his tax returns.
Mondale spent more than
four hours yesterday discussing
defense policy in a private
meeting with Sen. Gary Hart,
his former rival for the nomina
tion, other members of
Congress and former Pentagon
officials.
Defense issues will be the
major theme of a four-state
southern campaign swing
Mondale is beginning today.
After the meeting, Mondale
was asked about Reagan's
joking remarks, confirmed by a
White House official, before
delivering his weekly broadcast.
The official, who spoke on the
condition that he not be identi
fied, confirmed that Reagan,
speaking into a microphone
everyone present thought was
off, said: "My fellow
Americans. I'm pleased to tell
you we have signed legislation
today that would outlaw Russia
forever. We begin bombing in
five minutes."

"I don't think it's very
funny," Mondale said of
Reagan's remark.
Mondale recalled that in 1981
and 1982 administration offi
cials talked about "nuclear
warning shots" and "winning
limited nuclear wars."
He said those remarks
"created a major diplomatic
problem, undermined attempts
to get arms control and gave to
our adversaries a tremendous
propaganda bonanza that we
should never have given them."
Mondale also was asked
about Ferraro's announcement
on Sunday that while she would
disclose her finances and tax
returns, tax returns for her hus
band, real estate developer John
Zaccaro, will not be made
public.
He shrugged off Zaccaro's
decision to keep his tax returns
private saying, "He has decided
not to file the returns. As I un
derstand it, that's his right under
the law, and I'm not in a posi
tion to second guess it. . . Mr.
Zaccaro has his own business
life, which he is entitled to."
Mondale also kept up his at
tack on Reagan's recent
remarks about taxes, saying the
president's statement Sunday
that taxes would be raised as "a
last resort" to trim budget
deficits was not in keeping with
Reagan's record.
