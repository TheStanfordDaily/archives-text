# College costs up 6 percent, lowest inflation in 3 years
## 
### 
New York ( AP) — The average cost of at
tending college this fall will rise 6 percent for
students living on campus, ending a three-year
string of double-digit increases, according to
an annual survey released yesterday by The
College Board.
For the third straight year, highly selective
Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be
the most expensive college in the nation, with
total annual costs climbing 9 percent to
$16,130.
The 6 percent average increase students can
expect this fall follows three years of double
digit college cost rises that ran well ahead of
the nation's overall inflation rate. College offi
cials have generally explained that steep tui
tion increases were necessary to allow profes
sors' salaries to catch up after the severe infla
tion of the 19705.
Janice Gams, a College Board spokes
woman, said the board had no clear explana
tion for this year's smaller increases. But some
think the cooling of inflation plus the increas
ingly fierce competition among colleges for a
scarcer number of qualified 18-year-olds may
be keeping tuition increases in check.

The 6 percent average increase is just
slightly above the 4 to 5 percent overall infla
tion rate anticipated for next year, said Kath
leen Brouder, associate director of the Board's
College Scholarship Service.
The annual College Board survey examines
the total costs of more than 3200 public and
private colleges, including tuition and fees,
books and supplies, room and board, personal
expenses and transportation.
The 1984-85 survey calculated an average
tab of $9022 for students at private, four-year
colleges who live on campus — up 7 percent
from a year ago. For commuting students, costs
will total $7782, or 6 percent higher.
At public, four-year schools, total costs will
rise by 5 percent to $4881 for students living
on campus, and a similar increase to $3906 for
commuters.
Besides M.1.T., the most expensive schools
in terms of anticipated total costs in 1984-85
are Bennington College, $16,040; Harvard-
Radcliffe, $15,750; Princeton, $15,625; Bar
nard, $15,558; Yale, $15,500; Brandeis,
$15,250; Tufts University, $15,236; Brown,
$15,190, and Sarah Lawrence, $15,180.
