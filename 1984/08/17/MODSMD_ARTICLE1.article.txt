# Stanford lawsuit unfounded, says Niven's
## 
### ELAINE WANG Daily staff 
The postponed hearing for
Stanford's lawsuit against
Niven's International Foods is
now set for Aug. 21, when the
University will ask the Santa
Clara County Superior Court
for a preliminary injunction.
If the request is granted,
Niven's will not be allowed to
sublease some of its space to
Mrs. Fields Cookies and Cone
a-Copia ice cream until the ac
tual matter goes to a full trial.
If the injunction is denied, "I
can do what I want," said owner
John Niven, meaning that plans
to install Mrs. Fields and Cone
a-Copia, in order to attract
more customers to the super
market, can proceed.
Stanford officials offered no
comment, but referred to docu
ments filed yesterday at the Palo
Alto court, in preparation for
next Tuesday's hearing.
The University contends that
Niven will breach its lease by
renting space to Mrs. Fields
Cookies and Cone-a-Copia.
Furthermore, Stanford claims
that its large investment in the
shopping center relies on its

balanced mix of different shops.
By moving in with cookies and
ice cream, Stanford argued,
Niven's may hurt the business of
other cookie and ice cream
shops at the center.
Stanford's trying to draw the
line between a bakery and a
cookie bakery," Niven coun
tered.
The lease states: "Lessee
shall use the leased premises for
the purpose of . . . retail of such
merchandise and rendering of
such services ... as may be cus
tomarily sold or rendered from
time to time by supermarkets in
shopping centers in the San
Francisco Bay Area, and for no
other purpose."
"They couldn't object if a full
bakery was installed, because
bakeries are common in super
markets — I counted fifty on the
Peninsula," said Niven. ' k ßut I
have no room for a bakery like
that, so the compromise was
Mrs. Fields."
The way he sees it, "a cookie
is a cookie is a cookie. What
does it matter that it's packaged
or not?"

ood store. The University and Niven's are embroiled in a legal battle over Niven's attempMo
lease part of its store to Mrs. Field's Cookies and Cone-a-Copia ice cream. anempi
"Stanford argues that we're
going to tip the mix negatively.
There's 1,400,000 square feet at
this shopping center, and we're
only taking up less than 500
square feet," he said. "How can
that affect the magic balance?"
"Besides," said Niven, "Mrs.
Fields is the best in the field, so
it will ultimately draw more cus
tomers."
A poster on one of Niven's
windows outlines his case
against Stanford, using letters —
subpoenaed by Niven — be
tween University offices and
newspaper stories, with a plea to
"help us out."
On Aug. 13, Niven sent Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy a letter and petition of al
most 1500 signatures of custom
ers, gathered in his store over
the weekend.
Niven tends to see various
Stanford actions as a progres
sion of some sort; it began in

Feb., 1984. A letter from
Rosemary McAndrews,
manager of campus properties,
to Jannette Biggerstaff, shop
ping center property manager,
stated that "use clauses are not
being observed . . . more and
more of the front of the store
[Niven's] is devoted to flowers
. . . recent upsurge is totally un
acceptable and not permitted by
their use clause. Our flower
store tenant pays us 8 percent as
against Niven's 1/2 of 1 percent
of sales. This is unfair to our
flower tenant and to the
landlord."
Niven found this letter among
the subpoenaed records. "I
think we've hit a raw nerve," he
said. "I've been selling flowers
and plants here since 1956. Ref
erence to 'breaches' are ab
surd."
He said that Stanford is trying
to "prevent us from expanding,
or bringing new business in (to
his operation) which will keep
them from getting the 8 per
cent."
"They don't like it,"he con

tinued, "and I've got a lease up
to 2006." "Right after the
Mrs. Fields flap/' said Niven,
Frank Morrow, Stanford's
director of real estate informed
him that the entire portion of
the parking lot nearest Niven's
would be closed for construction
for approximately five weeks.
"What happens to a grocery
store with no parking lot is that
no one comes," said Niven. "He
must have realized that a five
week closure would be dis
astrous. After a considerable ef
fort on my part, including
'threatening to sue, I get this let
ter [dated July 25, 1984] which
says they've found a way to do
the work in half the time with
out even closing the lot. All of a
sudden he's a nice guy."
Niven regards the entire issue
both as one of "free-enterprise"
and "a waste of time and
money."
"Stanford has spent a lot of
money which should've gone to
something more constructive.
It's just not appropriate, the
way I look at it,"he said.

of sales. This is unfair to our
flower tenant and to the
landlord."
Niven found this letter among
the subpoenaed records. "I
think we've hit a raw nerve," he
said. "I've been selling flowers
and plants here since 1956. Ref
erence to 'breaches' are ab
surd."
He said that Stanford is trying
to "prevent us from expanding,
or bringing new business in (to
his operation) which will keep
them from getting the 8 per
cent."
"They don't like it,"he con

tinued, "and I've got a lease up
to 2006." "Right after the
Mrs. Fields flap/' said Niven,
Frank Morrow, Stanford's
director of real estate informed
him that the entire portion of
the parking lot nearest Niven's
would be closed for construction
for approximately five weeks.
"What happens to a grocery
store with no parking lot is that
no one comes," said Niven. "He
must have realized that a five
week closure would be dis
astrous. After a considerable ef
fort on my part, including
'threatening to sue, I get this let
ter [dated July 25, 1984] which
says they've found a way to do
the work in half the time with
out even closing the lot. All of a
sudden he's a nice guy."
Niven regards the entire issue
both as one of "free-enterprise"
and "a waste of time and
money."
"Stanford has spent a lot of
money which should've gone to
something more constructive.
It's just not appropriate, the
way I look at it,"he said.
The postponed hearing for
Stanford's lawsuit against
Niven's International Foods is
now set for Aug. 21, when the
University will ask the Santa
Clara County Superior Court
for a preliminary injunction.
If the request is granted,
Niven's will not be allowed to
sublease some of its space to
Mrs. Fields Cookies and Cone
a-Copia ice cream until the ac
tual matter goes to a full trial.
If the injunction is denied, "I
can do what I want," said owner
John Niven, meaning that plans
to install Mrs. Fields and Cone
a-Copia, in order to attract
more customers to the super
market, can proceed.
Stanford officials offered no
comment, but referred to docu
ments filed yesterday at the Palo
Alto court, in preparation for
next Tuesday's hearing.
The University contends that
Niven will breach its lease by
renting space to Mrs. Fields
Cookies and Cone-a-Copia.
Furthermore, Stanford claims
that its large investment in the
shopping center relies on its

balanced mix of different shops.
By moving in with cookies and
ice cream, Stanford argued,
Niven's may hurt the business of
other cookie and ice cream
shops at the center.
Stanford's trying to draw the
line between a bakery and a
cookie bakery," Niven coun
tered.
The lease states: "Lessee
shall use the leased premises for
the purpose of . . . retail of such
merchandise and rendering of
such services ... as may be cus
tomarily sold or rendered from
time to time by supermarkets in
shopping centers in the San
Francisco Bay Area, and for no
other purpose."
"They couldn't object if a full
bakery was installed, because
bakeries are common in super
markets — I counted fifty on the
Peninsula," said Niven. ' k ßut I
have no room for a bakery like
that, so the compromise was
Mrs. Fields."
The way he sees it, "a cookie
is a cookie is a cookie. What
does it matter that it's packaged
or not?"


fnnH S^ l ' V Stanford Shopping Center studies an information board/petition in front of'Nfoen's
ood store. The University and Niven's are embroiled in a legal battle over Niven's attempMo
lease part of its store to Mrs. Field's Cookies and Cone-a-Copia ice cream. anempi
"Stanford argues that we're
going to tip the mix negatively.
There's 1,400,000 square feet at
this shopping center, and we're
only taking up less than 500
square feet," he said. "How can
that affect the magic balance?"
"Besides," said Niven, "Mrs.
Fields is the best in the field, so
it will ultimately draw more cus
tomers."
A poster on one of Niven's
windows outlines his case
against Stanford, using letters —
subpoenaed by Niven — be
tween University offices and
newspaper stories, with a plea to
"help us out."
On Aug. 13, Niven sent Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy a letter and petition of al
most 1500 signatures of custom
ers, gathered in his store over
the weekend.
Niven tends to see various
Stanford actions as a progres
sion of some sort; it began in

Feb., 1984. A letter from
Rosemary McAndrews,
manager of campus properties,
to Jannette Biggerstaff, shop
ping center property manager,
stated that "use clauses are not
being observed . . . more and
more of the front of the store
[Niven's] is devoted to flowers
. . . recent upsurge is totally un
acceptable and not permitted by
their use clause. Our flower
store tenant pays us 8 percent as
against Niven's 1/2 of 1 percent
of sales. This is unfair to our
flower tenant and to the
landlord."
Niven found this letter among
the subpoenaed records. "I
think we've hit a raw nerve," he
said. "I've been selling flowers
and plants here since 1956. Ref
erence to 'breaches' are ab

to "prevent us from expanding,
or bringing new business in (to
