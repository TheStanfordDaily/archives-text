### ELAINE WANG Daily staff 
The postponed hearing for
Stanford's lawsuit against
Niven's International Foods is
now set for Aug. 21, when the
University will ask the Santa
Clara County Superior Court
for a preliminary injunction.
If the request is granted,
Niven's will not be allowed to
sublease some of its space to
Mrs. Fields Cookies and Cone
a-Copia ice cream until the ac
tual matter goes to a full trial.
If the injunction is denied, "I
can do what I want," said owner
John Niven, meaning that plans
to install Mrs. Fields and Cone
a-Copia, in order to attract
more customers to the super
market, can proceed.
Stanford officials offered no
comment, but referred to docu
ments filed yesterday at the Palo
Alto court, in preparation for
next Tuesday's hearing.
The University contends that
Niven will breach its lease by
renting space to Mrs. Fields
Cookies and Cone-a-Copia.
Furthermore, Stanford claims
that its large investment in the
shopping center relies on its

balanced mix of different shops.
By moving in with cookies and
ice cream, Stanford argued,
Niven's may hurt the business of
other cookie and ice cream
shops at the center.
Stanford's trying to draw the
line between a bakery and a
cookie bakery," Niven coun
tered.
The lease states: "Lessee
shall use the leased premises for
the purpose of . . . retail of such
merchandise and rendering of
such services ... as may be cus
tomarily sold or rendered from
time to time by supermarkets in
shopping centers in the San
Francisco Bay Area, and for no
other purpose."
"They couldn't object if a full
bakery was installed, because
bakeries are common in super
markets — I counted fifty on the
Peninsula," said Niven. ' k ßut I
have no room for a bakery like
that, so the compromise was
Mrs. Fields."
The way he sees it, "a cookie
is a cookie is a cookie. What
does it matter that it's packaged
or not?"
