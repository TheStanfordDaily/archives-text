## Improved planning needed to handle Olympic-sized crowds 
### 
It has been five days since the closing
ceremonies of the XXIII Olympiad. It has also
been a little over a week since the last soccer game
was played at Stanford Stadium. As a year-round
resident of the Stanford campus, I for one am glad
that it's finally over.
Don t get me wrong, I was extremely proud to

Viewpoint

be a student of a university which was honored to
sponsor an Olympic event. My complaint (or
should I say suggestion) is that Stanford did not
take any action to protect the housing rights of the
on-campus residents.
I was glad when I realized that 1 would be able
to avoid the congestion of Olympic patriots invad
ing Southern California this summer. You can im
agine my frustration when it took me 45 minutes
to drive the length of Embarcadero from Highway
101 to Manzanita Park on campus.
I would like to thank the policemen who did
help control the massive influx of traffic. But were
the policemen protecting the on-campus

residences from the threat of crime, not to men
tion the need to control the hundreds of wander
ing sports enthusiasts who were aimlessly search
ing for the Stadium?
These people did not even realize or care that
they were wandering through people's homes and
yards, dropping their garbage and parking their
cars in the residents' spaces. Not only were the
residents of Stanford inconvenienced but in a
sense they were also violated.
I would just like the University to look ahead to
next January when the Super Bowl will be coming
to the Farm. If the crowds that attended the
Olympic Soccer games were rude and excited,
they're going to resemble young babes compared
to the kind of crowd the Super Bowl attracts. My
only suggestion is that when the University is or
ganizing security for the Super Bowl, it take into
consideration that the Stanford campus is home
for over 13,000 students and tries to avoid the
feeling of violation that occurred this summer.
