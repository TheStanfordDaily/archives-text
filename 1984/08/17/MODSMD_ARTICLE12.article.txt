## Dissenting students face unclear policy 
### 
What is the University policy for dealing with the case in which a
student's opinion differs from that of the textbook, instructor or TA
in a course? Let me give an example of this case: A student's course
report was deemed to conflict with the philosophy of the course
though the student absolutely believes that nobody can guarantee
that the philosophy emphasized can wotk well all the time.
A good way to deal with this case would be that this kind of stu
dent get a NC (no credit) in the course (even though he has already
spent a lot of time in this course) while he keeps the right to claim a

Viewpoint

refund of the tuition paid for the course.
What kind of action can a student take if he feels that the com
ments on his course report were unjust. Let's have an example:
In a course in which the students were asked to do the decision
analysis for the clients (every student was required to disclose the
client's identity), a student had described his client in the class
presentation but found the comment on the course report, "we
never figured who your client was," and the reply letter from the
TA said, "it was never made clear in your presentations."
Inevitably, the suspicion that the TA lost consiousness arose in
the student's mind because: 1) The presentation was demonstrated
on slide transparencies and anybody could have asked questions
during the report if he was not satisfied; 2) It should have been
declared before the student started writing the final report if any
specific information was required in the final project report. Why
wasn't it mentioned in the syllabus regarding the presentation
report?; and 3) Why did the TA say he needed "just enough for us
to understand what is going on with the client, and what actions
would be taken if your recommendations were implemented" in his
reply letter to the questions? He should have known this from the
class presentation or asked then.
Is it right that the student should just study hard instead of ar
guing against the textbook or the opinion of the instructor or TA? If
a student just knows how to read the book and how to agree with
the instructor, then a good grade may just imply a good studying
and writing machine.
My suggestions are: 1) That a student know the University policy
very well so that he may make sure whether or not it is very impor
tant that he agree with the philosophy of the course he wants to take
for credit; 2) The department should be very discrete in deciding
what shall be listed as core courses; 3) That the student follow the
Honor Code, and the actions of the instructors or TAs should be
based on justice.
