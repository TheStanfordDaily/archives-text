## Reagan "joke" inexcusable 
### 
I was shocked and deeply
troubled by President Reagan's
"bomb joke."
Though others pass it off as
insignificant, joking about the
apocalyptic destruction of mil
lions of innocent people like
ourselves is inexcusable. It is
frightening to realize our
country is ied by a man who
holds such patent hatred that he
could joke about this
nightmarish scene.
Furthermore, it is hypocritical
that a man who professes to
cherish the humanistic values of
Jesus Christ, who opposes abor
tion because of the "sanctity of
human life," could simultane
ously joke about such a
wholesale destruction of
humanity.
Can we blame "the Russians"
for their paranoid and defensive
outlook on the world?
Our politicians (and we who
elect them) must realize we are
entering a new era of increasing
interdependence which does not
allow for such hostility between
nations. We cannot afford to
hate "the Russians;" Reagan's
"joke," if a reality, would lead
to our own destruction. The

future survival of our species
will require greater mutual ac
ceptance and tolerance - and the
resolution of our conflicts in a
non-violent manner.

I was a clerical worker at the
Controller's Office, Accounts
Payable Department. I was ter
minated Sept. 6, 1983 for
voicing my opinion to improve
the filling room productiv
ity. Evidently, voicing my
opinion was too much for the
manager of the department be
cause she said, "Such conduct
made productive communica
tion impossible."
To me, it is ironic to be fired
for speaking up when, Stan
ford's own guide memos state
the importance of "adequate
communication between em
ployer and employee; also the
employees' view is very neces
sary toward the support of the
supervisors."
After my termination I sought

guidance and help within Stan
ford University from Employee
Relations, the Ombudsman Of
fice, and the Help Center. Nei
ther support nor investigation
was given. However, to my
surprise and joy I received much
support from co-workers and
others who helped me pursue a
grievance.
At that grievance, three co
workers testified on my behalf.
Of the three witnesses, one
named Elmas Gokcek was un
justly terminated a few months
later. A second witness trans
ferred to a lower paying job to
avoid termination.
In order to protect others
from going through what I have
gone through I am asking Stan
ford to investigate this depart
ment. What happened to me
and what is now happening to
Elmas Gokcek can happen to
others.l am asking co-workers
to support Elmas Gokcek so we
may all have the liberty to speak
freely. If we stay united maybe
this kind of thing will not hap
pen again.
