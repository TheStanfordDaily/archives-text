## Football season begins as 27 freshmen report 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff With wire reports 
There are some unmistakable signs that the end
of summer is near. The days start getting shorter.
Back-to-school commercials fill the airwaves and
newspapers. And football practice begins.
For 27 members of this year's freshman class,
the end of summer came Tuesday afternoon when
they reported here for the beginning of camp.
After physicals Wednesday morning, they hit the
field that afternoon for their first practice in a
Stanford uniform.
The freshman will go through two-a-day
workouts through tomorrow, when upperclas
smen report for dinner. Sunday will be the annual
Picture Day in Stanford Stadium for the local
media, and the full team will begin two-a-days
Monday. The players are in shorts until next
Thursday, the first day in pads.
Two-a-days end Aug. 31, and the team will
have one week more of practice before the
opening game, Sept. 8 against Big Eight con
tender Oklahoma in Norman.
Morning practices begin at 9 a.m., and after
noon sessions start at 4 p.m. Both last approxi
mately two hours.

The Cardinal is not expected to contend for the
Pacific 10 title according to most experts. As
many as six teams are seen as having a shot at the
championship, however.
UCLA, which started the season 0-3-1, finished
as the most impressive of all the bowl teams,
thrashing Big Ten champ Illinois 45-9 in the Rose
Bowl. The Bruins have been to the Rose Bowl
three years running and just might turn out to be
even better in 1984 than they were in '83. Some
people think UCLA could contend for the na
tional championship.
Washington has finished in the top two the last
seven years but must find a replacement for quar
terback Steve Pelluer, Pac-10 Offensive Player of
the Year.
Washington State, usually a doormat, was 7-4 a
year ago, and few teams anywhere have a trio of
runners to match Kerry Porter, Rueben Mayes
and Don Laßomme.
Tradition-rich Southern California is coming
off its first losing season (4-6-1) since 1961, and
there is still no established standout tailback'. But
the Trojans landed highly recruited running back
Ryan Knight and are hoping for big things from
holdover quarterback Sean Salisbury. Jack Del
Rio is among the nation's top linebackers.
