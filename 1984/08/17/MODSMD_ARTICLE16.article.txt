# Camp stresses competition, fundementals
## 
### JASON COLE Senior sportswriter 
The smile on basketball coach Tom
Davis' face expressed two thoughts yes
terday. He looked happy to be teaching
basketball and slightly relieved that the
Stanford basketball camp was close to
being over.
"This is the best camp in the three
years we've been doing it," Davis said.
"But it was hectic." The annual camp
ended its second and final week yester

day afternoon with the awards cere
mony.
This summer's camp consisted of two
one-week sessions, each hosting approxi
mately 260 boys ages 9-17. Both camps
were sellouts, making this the largest
camp during Davis' tenure at Stanford.
The purpose of the camp was to teach
fundamentals and give each boy as much
game experience as possible. But the at
mosphere of the camp was heavily laced
with competition.

"Contests are very important to these
kids. We try and keep them competi
tive," explained assistant coach Steve
Couch. "We want the kids to come away
with the feeling that they've won some
thing or at least participated."
The emphasis on competition was not
only to keep the boys active, but also to
make them concentrate on areas they
need to improve. "We don't try to
remake a kid's game in a week's time.
That's just not possible. But we try to get

them enthusiastic about the game,"
Davis said.
"If we can get every kid to think about
one part of his game and try to improve
it, this camp has been a success," Couch
said. "I had a cousin here last summer
who couldn't shoot a left-handed layup.
But Bobby Hunter [one of the coaches
last summer] got him really fired up, and
he came back this summer and tried to
win it [layup contest]."
Davis also hopes to improve the camp
so that it can become part of the recruit
ing process. Currently, two players from
Stanford's Gray team (junior varsity) are
former camp participants. "They're not
scholarship players, but they got inter
ested in Stanford through the camp, and

now they're making a contribution to the
basketball program," Davis pointed out.
Couch said he hoped that the Stanford
camp could develop the reputation of
such prestigious camps as those at In
diana and North Carolina. "We want
kids to come here because this is an ex
cellent place to learn about basketball,"
he said.
Much of that impression is due to
Davis' reputation around the country as
a good coach. "I don't want this to

become the 'Tom Davis' camp — but I
know that has a lot to do with it. I want
to push the University and the campus,"
he said.
Davis himself doesn't make much
money from the camp, unlike other
coaches, which may explain his attitude.
In fact, the camp lost approximately
$10,000 last summer and should about
break even this summer. Nevertheless,
he has some changes in mind for the
future.

Next summer's camp will start to take
reservations on Oct. 1, rather than
waiting until February. The earlier date,
Couch says, may provide incentive for
the University to build more outdoor
court space for the camp.
This year temporary courts were used
because there weren't enough. "If we
can show the University that this might
make money, they might be interested in
building more courts," Couch said.
