Creme Carmel restaurant, oddly, does not include
creme caramel among its dessert offerings. We can only
conclude that the name was chosen solely to be quaint
and charming, in the same way that Carmel itself strives
for quaintness and charm.
Carmel is a lovely place full of people from out of
town with lots of money, looking for something to do.
One thing they enjoy is eating out at expensive French
restaurants. Carmel, accordingly, overflows with these
places, designed to charm, soothe, and entertain as well
as nourish.
Creme Carmel is one of these. It serves good, solid,
excellently prepared food. The dishes are delicious and
interesting but, paradoxically, unchallenging. This food
is designed for those who want to relax at the end of a
day of sightseeing and enjoy comfortable, satisfying
gourmet cuisine. Though practically everything we
were served was delicious, at no point did I sense that
extra stroke of genius that characterizes truly great
food.
The restaurant itself is elegant. There is only one
fairly small room with about a dozen tables set quite
close together. The atmosphere was intimate but not
overcrowded. Fresh orchids graced all the tables, and
generous bouquets of flowers were present throughout
the room.
Appetizers ranged from $2 for soup to $6.50 for
lobster in puff pastry. The list included two soups,
clams, and pate as well as the lobster. The sample menu
also described mussels, scallops, and chicken breast
with goat cheese. The three of us sampled two ap

petizers; a cream of Swiss chard and potato soup ($2),
and duckling pate with cognac ($4.50).
The soup was pleasant, but not inspired; the flavor
was pleasant, but lacked definition: Chard is perhaps
too delicate a vegetable to serve as the focus of a cream
soup without help from something else. The pate was
the weakest dish we were served. It looked pretty: a
slice of paste resting on a bed of lettuce with a few baby
gherkins, one sliced artistically, and some carrots
beside, with a little pile of mustard and some cute cut
outs of slightly toasted bread sat on the side. The pate
itself, though, was disappointingly unflavorful, and the
mustard was so strong as to be completely overpower
ing.
The salad was tasty with a couple of chunks of feta
and a well-seasoned creamy Italian dressing.
It was the entree course though that restored our
faith in the restaurant. We had salmon with fresh tar
ragon sauce ($14.75), swordfish with mustard and leek
puree ($13.50), and touirnedos in Zinfandel sauce,
with fresh horseradish ($15.50).
The other entrees of the evening were sole with
shrimp mousse at $12.75, pheasant with shiitake mush
rooms and sherry for $15.75, and loin of lamb, roasted
in rosemary and garlic, for $15.25. The sample menu
indicated that variations in the accompanying
vegetables did occur.
Our choices had a common note; all were served with
strongly flavored sauces in which one of two flavors
predominated. All were delicious and masterfully
prepared — the taste was strong but not overpowering
— yet none had the complexity that would have come
from a background of other spices behind the main
seasonings.
The sauce on the salmon was buttery, lemony, and

bursting with tarragon. The mustard and leek puree
had just the right degree of sharpness, balanced by the
mellower flavor of the leek. It was a good choice for a
slightly stronger-tasting fish like swordfish. The sauce
on the beef tasted like a savory, concentrated beef
gravy. I tried hard, but couldn't detect any Zinfandel
flavor. I'm sure it was there, though, adding richness to
the beef stock. The meat and both fishes were of good
quality and perfectly cooked.
A vegetable plate came with each dinner. It included
broccoli with Hollandaise, a mousse of pureed
rutabagas that had a delicious nutty, squash-like flavor
and a small portion of fettucine with a great Parmesan
and cream sauce. The plate was very tasty and a good
idea: an effective complement to the main course.
Dessert maintained the high standard set by the
entree. We had chocolate almond torte ($3), straw
berries in puff pastry with creme anglaise ($3.25), and
fresh homemade sorbets ($2.50).
The torte was made with ground almond flour and
was dense, chocolatey and utterly decadent. The sor
bets were another highlight. One portion included the
three flavors of the day — strawberry, kiwi, and mango.
All had intense fruit flavors. The strawberries in puff
pastry were very good, but not as outstanding as the
others, as the pastry was perhaps just a bit overcooked.
Other desserts were a hazelnut and meringue ice-cream
cake ($2.75) and homemade ice-cream ($2.75).
We left Creme Carmel full and satisfied. The hours
are Monday-Saturday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. for lunch
(soup, fancy salads, omelettes and pasta), and from
5:30 till 10 p.m. for dinner. Coming from the north, it is
on the left off San Carlos, in the back of a little court
yard called Carmel square, just before Seventh Ave.
Bon appetit.

interesting but, paradoxically, unchallenging. This food
is designed for those who want to relax at the end of a
day of sightseeing and enjoy comfortable, satisfying
gourmet cuisine. Though practically everything we
were served was delicious, at no point did I sense that
extra stroke of genius that characterizes truly great
food.
The restaurant itself is elegant. There is only one
fairly small room with about a dozen tables set quite
close together. The atmosphere was intimate but not
overcrowded. Fresh orchids graced all the tables, and
generous bouquets of flowers were present throughout
the room.
Appetizers ranged from $2 for soup to $6.50 for
lobster in puff pastry. The list included two soups,
clams, and pate as well as the lobster. The sample menu
also described mussels, scallops, and chicken breast
with goat cheese. The three of us sampled two ap

petizers; a cream of Swiss chard and potato soup ($2),
and duckling pate with cognac ($4.50).
The soup was pleasant, but not inspired; the flavor
was pleasant, but lacked definition: Chard is perhaps
too delicate a vegetable to serve as the focus of a cream
soup without help from something else. The pate was
the weakest dish we were served. It looked pretty: a
slice of paste resting on a bed of lettuce with a few baby
gherkins, one sliced artistically, and some carrots
beside, with a little pile of mustard and some cute cut
outs of slightly toasted bread sat on the side. The pate
itself, though, was disappointingly unflavorful, and the
mustard was so strong as to be completely overpower
ing.
The salad was tasty with a couple of chunks of feta
and a well-seasoned creamy Italian dressing.
It was the entree course though that restored our
faith in the restaurant. We had salmon with fresh tar
ragon sauce ($14.75), swordfish with mustard and leek
puree ($13.50), and touirnedos in Zinfandel sauce,
with fresh horseradish ($15.50).
The other entrees of the evening were sole with
shrimp mousse at $12.75, pheasant with shiitake mush
rooms and sherry for $15.75, and loin of lamb, roasted
in rosemary and garlic, for $15.25. The sample menu
indicated that variations in the accompanying
vegetables did occur.
Our choices had a common note; all were served with
strongly flavored sauces in which one of two flavors
predominated. All were delicious and masterfully
prepared — the taste was strong but not overpowering
— yet none had the complexity that would have come
from a background of other spices behind the main
seasonings.
The sauce on the salmon was buttery, lemony, and

bursting with tarragon. The mustard and leek puree
had just the right degree of sharpness, balanced by the
mellower flavor of the leek. It was a good choice for a
slightly stronger-tasting fish like swordfish. The sauce
on the beef tasted like a savory, concentrated beef
gravy. I tried hard, but couldn't detect any Zinfandel
flavor. I'm sure it was there, though, adding richness to
the beef stock. The meat and both fishes were of good
quality and perfectly cooked.
A vegetable plate came with each dinner. It included
broccoli with Hollandaise, a mousse of pureed
rutabagas that had a delicious nutty, squash-like flavor
and a small portion of fettucine with a great Parmesan
and cream sauce. The plate was very tasty and a good
idea: an effective complement to the main course.
Dessert maintained the high standard set by the
entree. We had chocolate almond torte ($3), straw
berries in puff pastry with creme anglaise ($3.25), and
fresh homemade sorbets ($2.50).
The torte was made with ground almond flour and
was dense, chocolatey and utterly decadent. The sor
bets were another highlight. One portion included the
three flavors of the day — strawberry, kiwi, and mango.
All had intense fruit flavors. The strawberries in puff
pastry were very good, but not as outstanding as the
others, as the pastry was perhaps just a bit overcooked.
Other desserts were a hazelnut and meringue ice-cream
cake ($2.75) and homemade ice-cream ($2.75).
We left Creme Carmel full and satisfied. The hours
are Monday-Saturday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. for lunch
(soup, fancy salads, omelettes and pasta), and from
5:30 till 10 p.m. for dinner. Coming from the north, it is
on the left off San Carlos, in the back of a little court
yard called Carmel square, just before Seventh Ave.
Bon appetit.
