Domenico's
50 Fisherman's Wharf
Monterey
(408) 372-3655
A book can t be judged by its
cover, nor a restaurant by its
menu. That was the lesson we
/earned rcccntly in Monterey.
We were told Domenico's
was an "exciting" place, a i
"culinary delight," but the <
menu didn't reflect it: a four- ;
page wine list, a half-page of ap- ,
petizers, some ordinary pasta
dishes and the usual Ital
ian/seatood cuisine — cioppino,
calamari, swordfish. (
Steaks — filet and New York
cuts — are cooked on an open
hearth mesquite wood broiler,
the menu said. Were we
supposed to hallucinate over
that? 1
But it was 10 p.m., and we
were starved. So we stayed.
Certainly, the decor was
pleasant, with a European flair.
The cocktail lounge sported a
white marble floor. A window
wall overlooked the Yacht Har
bor and there was an abundance
of greenery. The table service
was simple but elegant — white
linen tablecloths, blue linen
napkins, white china, silver.

Soon, a waitress and waiter
appeared, one carrying a platter
of Greek and Sicilian cracked
olives, the other a basket of
bread. They would be serving
us. Would we like some wine
with our meal?
The olives, at least a quart of
them, looked delicious and as if
might be the high point of the
evening. They deserved an ac
companiment of wine. We chose
a bottle from the 125 varieties
of California's finest.
"I'll get your wine,"
Vivienne, our waitress, said.
"Then we'll talk about the spe
cials."
Specials? Things were looking
up.
The olives were delicious and
made on the premises. The bit
terness is washed out of them
before they're marinated with
garlic, olive oil and vinegar. One
could make a meal of those and
the bread alone. But you don't
have to.
Vivienne returned with the
wine and began listing the spe
cials. They included:
•Pasta Napoli — baby scal
lops and diced tomatoes sauted
in butter and wine, seasoned
with garlic, cayenne peper and
black olives, served on

homemade linguine;
•Soft-shelled crab — flown in
live from the East Coast, these
crabs are prepared simply, with
butter and garlic. And you can
eat everything, including the
shell;
•Opah — a tropical moon fish
with rich, red flesh, which
drifted into Monterey Bay on
the El Nino current;
•Cioppino — prepared here
with New Zealand scallops and
mussels, clams, shrimp, crab,
opah and halibut, in a red sauce
made zestly with cayenne pep
per;
• Salmon ravioli — home
made ravioli stuffed with
smoked salmon and ricotta
cheese, covered with marinara
and a creamy salmon sauce,
topped with caviar;
•Sushi.
There were others; 10 to 25
specials per night, depending on
the day's catch.
All the specials were priced
$17.95 and $18.95. Steaks were
about the same. Some of the
simpler pastas, all homemade,
ran about $11.95. Lobster
varies, but if imported from
Maine, can be as much as
$14.95 per pound.
We ordered the cioppino and

a New York steak. Our waiter,
Joe Gorman, brought clam
chowder — homemade, deli
cate, with lots of clams.
Our meal arrived shortly
after. It was so delicious you
couldn't put down your spoon,
or fork.
The cioppino was served in a
deep dish with fluted lemon.
The steak came with steamed
broccoli, topped with holan
daise. Mesquite sears meat
nicely, we found, without mas
king the natural flavor of the
meat as hickory does.
Vivienne returned. Did we
want more wine, more bread?
Did we have water?
Our meal also came with a
salad, served afterwards,
European style. The night's spe
cial was hearts of palm (cut from
baby palm trees), spinach,
tomato and vinagrette dressing.
Or, we could have had a tossed
green salad with creamy Italian.
Both would surely have been
wonderful, but we turned them
down. No room. Then, Joe, our
waiter, came by with the dessert
tray.
Strawberry tartlets with cus
tard, espresso chocolate
cheesecake, pecan pastries,
chocolate or strawberry mousse,
fresh blueberries, and home
made pistachio ice cream.
We let out our bellies. Maybe,
just one little tartlet.

bar and sushi): Monday through
