### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
Three Stanford faculty were
among 55 scientists from 13
countries that have offered to
serve in pairs as "good faith wit
nesses" in the Soviet Union for
as long as necessary if Yelena
Bonner, Andrei Sahkarov's
wife, is permitted to leave the
country for medical treatment.
The International Coalition
of Scientists for Sakharov
(ICSS) yesterday made public a
telegram they had sent to Soviet
President Konstantin Cher
nenko on July 31. At a press
conference in Washington,
D.C., the ICSS revealed the

contents of their communique:
"We are to bear per
sonnl witness to the Snic&rity of
Dr. Bonner's and Dr. Sak
harov's assertions that the jour
ney would be only for medical
purposes and a family visit.
Each of us is prepared to travel
at our own expense to the Soviet
Union in an effort to alleviate
the present impasse.
"We propose that pairs of
personal witnesses be chosen
from the undersigned list [of sci
entists] and that each pair spend
one week in the Soviet Union,
being relieved by the subse
quent pair for the duration of
Dr. Bonner's time abroad."

The Stanford faculty mem
bers were Chemistry Prof. Paul
Flttry. FUtychemMstry Pruf. y\r
thur Kornberg and Computer
Science Prof. John McCarthy.
The scientists expressed hope
that "the presence of these per
sonal witnesses would make
possible further exploration of
additional steps to improve rela
tions between the Soviet scien
tific community and its scientific
colleagues around the world."
Tanya Yankelevich, daughter
of the Sakharovs, said she was
"deeply moved by this .selfless
and humanitarian action of the
scientists on behalf of my par
ents."

said yesterthai the
ICSS had not received any tep\y
from th<s Soviets regarding the
telegram, and that he did not
expect them to respond at all.
"We [the ICSS] never had
great hopes," he said. "But it
was worth an effort."
Though Flory calls himself a
"skeptic" regarding the effec
tiveness of the scientists' ac
tions, he said it was
"exceedingly important that ef
forts be continued."
The ICSS is an ad-hoc group
organized in response to the
May, 1984, announcemnt of
Sakharov's hunger strike.
