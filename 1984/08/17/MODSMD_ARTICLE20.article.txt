# Andre's charms with food, singing waiters

### 
Andre's
3770 The Barnyard
Carmel
An elegant alcove in Carmel's The
Barnyard, Andre's is self-described as
"an old-world setting" of antique win
dows, gold chandeliers and furniture
over 100 years old.
But the French restaurant may be seen
as an other world from its surroundings,
the shopping labyrinth off Highway 1
and then Rio Road. This part of the Bar
nyard is luxurious in its muted colors and
tucked-away feeling.
The atmosphere, however, is lively
and winsome . . . and the waiters sing,
powerfully and stirringly, old tunes such
as "She Touched Me," "Try to Remem
ber, "They Call the Wind Maria" and
"The Man from La Mancha," and
rousing Spanish songs like
"Guadalajara."
Not all the waiters sing, Owner Vickie
Sullivan told me, because a few
"anchors" are needed to carry on. But
every 20 minutes or so a waiter would
step forward to the piano — which plays
mood music in-between — and per
forms. It isn't a small place, but there are
many sections to Andre's, including an
upstairs called The Other Place; I'm sure
everyone could hear these waiters, from
one end of the restaurant to the other.
Their voices sound trained, especially the
man who belted out an exciting rendition
of "The Impossible Dream" — no
shower-screamers here.
The decor of Andre's is mixed,
quixotic. Soft lighting, white tablecloths
and candlelight, a rose on each table and
waiters in black ties give the place its
class (the food does, too, but that comes
later). You needn't match the service
with your tux or formal gown, but most
of the women wore dresses while men
sported jackets.
Separate booths along the walls lend
an air of intimacy; if you choose, you can

pull the ruffled curtains and really be
alone and away from the hum of other
conversations.
All this is what I considered "old
world." But the rustic wood interior with
windows for walls and a multitude of
greenery hanging from the skylight
ceiling — and the glow of a red light bulb
— add a dash of the unusual. It's not very
French to me, but instead distinctly Nor
thern California. Not in keeping with the
cushioned intimacy of the decor, but it's
appealing nonetheless. The front
"Garden Room" is like an enclosed
patio, and watching the dusk grow dark
through the foliage is a most palatable
experience.
The food, which is what restaurants
should be all about, is more than just
palatable. It is carefully and well
prepared; they easily pass the basic test
of soup being hot, salads being crisp and
food being fresh.
We ordered Oysters Rockefeller
($4.95) for an appetizer, thinking of a

simple half-dozen with some light sauce.
What we got was three oysters — a bit
skimpy, I think — baked with a spinach
and cheese sauce. A delicious starter.
Other'selections, which we left others to
try, include: Escargot ($5.95), Fettucini
Alfredo ($3.95), Artichoke Hearts
Sauteed a la Creme ($3.95) and Clams
Casino ($4.95).
Entrees are served with choice of soup
du jour or Caesar salad, and potatoes or
rice. Each evening there is the "featured
wild game entree of the evening" as well
as fresh fish in season. For the first, we
were offered pheasant, but opted for
something from the regular menu. I'd
spied my favorite dish, Canard Andre
($17.50) — roast duckling served in the
chef s sauce du jour — and promptly or
dered it. My companion got the Tour
nedos and Lobster Tail ($23) — filet of
beef and a six-ounce Australian lobster
tail with butter sauce on the side.
The food, probably owing to its fine
preparation, was a long time in coming.
But then, we'd started on our bottle of

wine (Robert Mondavi '82 Chardonnay,
$24) and were listening to the music. The
wine mark-up isn't too bad, although I'm
not that knowledgeable about local retail
prices. If you ask, they'll gladly bring you
an ice bucket to chill the bottle. Service
was attentive.
The entrees were truly satisfying, and
showed off the chef s versatility. Portions
were modest, but tasty. The tournedos
and lobster tail were sauceless, except for
the melted butter on the side, and
depended on the process and ingredients
while cooking for their flavor. What can I
say . . . my companion was immensely
pleased with this meal.
My duckling was prepared with a rich
blueberry sauce, of all things, rather than
the traditional a la orange sauce. I was
surprised, then charmed by the flavor,
which was full and sweet, but not cloying.
Coffee, for me, is the logical follow-up
to such a pleasurable meal, so I ordered a
Cafe Friar ($3.50), with brandy and kah
lua. (After all, my companion said he'd
do the driving.)
And while waiting for coffee, we asked
for dessert. They didn't have cheesecake
that night, so my companion selected a
custard pastry ($4) from the proffered
tray. He later exclaimed that it tasted
very much like cheesecake.
I chose the Napoleon ($4), a pastry
with thin layers of flaky crust and cream.
This was not as successful, because the
layers.tended to be soggy and difficult to
cut through with a fork. But this was the
lowest point of the evening and seemed a
trivial complaint.
We left after 10 p.m., well-fed and
happy, but there were still many people
coming in, if not for dinner then for a
drink, or one of Andre's other special
coffees: Cafe Andre and Cafe Keoke
(both $3.50). It was basically a great
evening at a fine restaurant ... if this
sounds like too much promo, try it tor
yourself.

with your tux or formal gown, but most
of the women wore dresses while men
sported jackets.
Separate booths along the walls lend
an air of intimacy; if you choose, you can

pull the ruffled curtains and really be
alone and away from the hum of other
conversations.
All this is what I considered "old
world." But the rustic wood interior with
windows for walls and a multitude of
greenery hanging from the skylight
ceiling — and the glow of a red light bulb
— add a dash of the unusual. It's not very
French to me, but instead distinctly Nor
thern California. Not in keeping with the
cushioned intimacy of the decor, but it's
appealing nonetheless. The front
"Garden Room" is like an enclosed
patio, and watching the dusk grow dark
through the foliage is a most palatable
experience.
The food, which is what restaurants
should be all about, is more than just
palatable. It is carefully and well
prepared; they easily pass the basic test
of soup being hot, salads being crisp and
food being fresh.
We ordered Oysters Rockefeller
($4.95) for an appetizer, thinking of a

simple half-dozen with some light sauce.
What we got was three oysters — a bit
skimpy, I think — baked with a spinach
and cheese sauce. A delicious starter.
Other'selections, which we left others to
try, include: Escargot ($5.95), Fettucini
Alfredo ($3.95), Artichoke Hearts
Sauteed a la Creme ($3.95) and Clams
Casino ($4.95).
Entrees are served with choice of soup
du jour or Caesar salad, and potatoes or
rice. Each evening there is the "featured
wild game entree of the evening" as well
as fresh fish in season. For the first, we
were offered pheasant, but opted for
something from the regular menu. I'd
spied my favorite dish, Canard Andre
($17.50) — roast duckling served in the
chef s sauce du jour — and promptly or
dered it. My companion got the Tour
nedos and Lobster Tail ($23) — filet of
beef and a six-ounce Australian lobster
tail with butter sauce on the side.
The food, probably owing to its fine
preparation, was a long time in coming.
But then, we'd started on our bottle of

wine (Robert Mondavi '82 Chardonnay,
$24) and were listening to the music. The
wine mark-up isn't too bad, although I'm
not that knowledgeable about local retail
prices. If you ask, they'll gladly bring you
an ice bucket to chill the bottle. Service
was attentive.
The entrees were truly satisfying, and
showed off the chef s versatility. Portions
were modest, but tasty. The tournedos
and lobster tail were sauceless, except for
the melted butter on the side, and
depended on the process and ingredients
while cooking for their flavor. What can I
say . . . my companion was immensely
pleased with this meal.
My duckling was prepared with a rich
blueberry sauce, of all things, rather than
the traditional a la orange sauce. I was
surprised, then charmed by the flavor,
which was full and sweet, but not cloying.
Coffee, for me, is the logical follow-up
to such a pleasurable meal, so I ordered a
Cafe Friar ($3.50), with brandy and kah
lua. (After all, my companion said he'd
do the driving.)
And while waiting for coffee, we asked
for dessert. They didn't have cheesecake
that night, so my companion selected a
custard pastry ($4) from the proffered
tray. He later exclaimed that it tasted
very much like cheesecake.
I chose the Napoleon ($4), a pastry
with thin layers of flaky crust and cream.
This was not as successful, because the
layers.tended to be soggy and difficult to
cut through with a fork. But this was the
lowest point of the evening and seemed a
trivial complaint.
We left after 10 p.m., well-fed and
happy, but there were still many people
coming in, if not for dinner then for a
drink, or one of Andre's other special
coffees: Cafe Andre and Cafe Keoke
(both $3.50). It was basically a great
evening at a fine restaurant ... if this
sounds like too much promo, try it tor
yourself.

Andre's
3770 The Barnyard
Carmel
An elegant alcove in Carmel's The
Barnyard, Andre's is self-described as
"an old-world setting" of antique win
dows, gold chandeliers and furniture
over 100 years old.
But the French restaurant may be seen
as an other world from its surroundings,
the shopping labyrinth off Highway 1
and then Rio Road. This part of the Bar
nyard is luxurious in its muted colors and
tucked-away feeling.
The atmosphere, however, is lively
and winsome . . . and the waiters sing,
powerfully and stirringly, old tunes such
as "She Touched Me," "Try to Remem
ber, "They Call the Wind Maria" and
"The Man from La Mancha," and
rousing Spanish songs like
"Guadalajara."
Not all the waiters sing, Owner Vickie
Sullivan told me, because a few
"anchors" are needed to carry on. But
every 20 minutes or so a waiter would
step forward to the piano — which plays
mood music in-between — and per
forms. It isn't a small place, but there are
many sections to Andre's, including an
upstairs called The Other Place; I'm sure
everyone could hear these waiters, from
one end of the restaurant to the other.
Their voices sound trained, especially the
man who belted out an exciting rendition
of "The Impossible Dream" — no
shower-screamers here.
The decor of Andre's is mixed,
quixotic. Soft lighting, white tablecloths
and candlelight, a rose on each table and
waiters in black ties give the place its
class (the food does, too, but that comes
later). You needn't match the service
with your tux or formal gown, but most
of the women wore dresses while men
sported jackets.
Separate booths along the walls lend
an air of intimacy; if you choose, you can

pull the ruffled curtains and really be

conversations.
