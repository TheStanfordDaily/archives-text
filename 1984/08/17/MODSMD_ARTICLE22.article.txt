## U.S. Olympians get NYC ticker-tape parade 
### 
New York (AP) — America's Olympic medal
winners got an "incredible Big Apple welcome"
Wednesday, but the exuberance of their Wall
Street ticker-tape parade was dampened when a
scaffold rail collapsed, injuring about 101 spec
tators, five seriously.
Some of the injured "showed the Olympic
spirit," said Mayor Edward Koch. "They were
worried [the accident] might interfere with the
parade."
The 221 athletes followed a line of yellow bal
loons and paper flags leading through the Finan
cial District's "Canyon of Heroes" toward City
Hall.
Cheering crowds 10 to 20 deep lined Broadway
during the hot, humid noon hour, and office
workers threw ticker tape, computer cards and
hundreds of thousands of make-believe gold
medallions from their windows.
Koch, who said Americans had "over 200 new
stars in our flag," estimated that "more than 2
million people lined the sidewalks and looked out
the buildings" at the Olympians.
Police were skeptical of the mayor's crowd esti
mate, but said they had no immediate figures of
their own.
"Thank you for this incredible — I mean in
credible! — Big Apple welcome," Mary Lou Ret
ton, gold medal gymnast, said at a City Hall cere
mony following the parade.
Police and witnesses said a wooden scaffold
fronting around a building gave way, spilling some
of about 200 people who were standing on the

structure onto the street. Several were carried on
stretchers to ambulances, which struggled to pass
through the dense crowds.
"Kids were climbing up [on the scaffolding] and
I heard a loud cracking, and they fell down on top
of people," said Jeanne Daoust of Staten Island,
who was standing beneath the structure.
"I thought it was the end of the world. I didn't
know what happened. It was very fast," said
Frank Thomas, 23, of Brooklyn, who suffered a
head cut when the scaffold rail fell on him.
His face was bloodied and he held an ice pack
on his head. "The doctors said I have to go to the
hospital, but I don't want to miss this," he said of
the parade.
City officials halted the parade, which had not
reached the site of the accident when the railing
gave way. After a half-hour delay, the parade
resumed.
Many in the parade were not immediately
aware of the accident. "We're all burning nervous
energy, and you can burn that a long time," said a
smiling Bart Conner, a gold medal gymnast.
A 1 Parisi, a street-sweeper standing with a
broom along the parade route, said the ticker tape
parade was "my first. Never seen anything like it
before. I gotta sweep up after it's over. But I don't
mind it — not for them."
Koch had promised the Olympians that the
ticker tape parade would be the city's "biggest
and best." Astronaut John Glenn was honored
with a ticker tape parade up Broadway in 1962;
the most recent such parade was in 1981, when
the American hostages returned from Iran.
