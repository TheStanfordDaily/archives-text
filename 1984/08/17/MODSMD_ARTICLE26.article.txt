## Some of the summer's most satisfying tunes 
### GWEN OREL 
When I first saw the video to
Sheila E.'s "The Glamorous
Life", I thought, she looked just
like Prince. And sure enough, I
read not long after, that Sheila
E. is Prince's new protege
and/or girlfriend. With this kind
of fanfare how does Sheila E.'s
new album, The Glamorous Life
really stack up?
Very well, indeed. Sheila E.
(short for Escovedo,) plays all
percussion on her album, which
is arranged as a movie concept.
For example, the first side is
referred to as "reel one," and
credits are printed on the back
of the jacket, which claim that
the record is "directed" by
Sheila E. and the Starr Com
pany.
The percussion is uniformly
interesting, and Sheila E. pos
sesses a fine singing voice as
well. When combined with the
talents of some fine back-up
musicians, Sheila E. contributes
to producing some of the sum
mer's catchiest pop/funk
melodies. Her single "The
Glamorous Life," is already be
coming one of the summer's

finest dance tunes, but also
notable is the high spirit of the
"Bell of St. Mark" and the ac
hing beauty of the ballad "Noon
Rendevous," which makes use
of lively castinets as percussion.

I can't rave enough about the
Bangles. Everyone's heard of
the GoGo's, but the Bangles are
still relatively unknown, prob
ably because as far as I know,
they have not yet released a
single.
But the Bangle's latest album,
All Over The Place, features
rock and roll with the chiming,
soaring quality of R.E.M. and
the Byrds, combined with the
catchy pop style of the GoGo's.
However, lead singer Susanna
Hoff has her own unique style.
Vicky Peterson's lead guitar is
outstanding, as are the drums of
Debbie Peterson. All of the
songs on this album are excel
lent as well as diverse. "Dover

nold's famous poem on love and

echoing harmonies concerning
unemployment, contains the
line, "Where you going with

"He's got a Secret," is irresis

instantly hummable tune with a

Beauty and the Beat, the
GoGo's debut album was
praised by critics everywhere
and did very well on the charts.
Many fans were disappointed by
the follow-up album. Vacation,
although that album was still
considered strong compared to
the efforts of many other
groups.
Talk Show, the GoGo's third
album, will inevitably be
compared to Beauty and the
Beat in terms of its quality. Yes,
its true that Talk Show is an ex

cellent album, every bit as good
as Beauty and the Beat, but it
also marks a significant
departure for the group.
Talk Show is the album on
which the GoGo's get tough.
Linda Carlisle belts out her vo
cals as never before, on rockers
like "Turn to You" and "Head
Over Heels." And Gina
Schock's drumming is even
more powerful than before.
But more than that, the lyrics
on this album are mature and
intelligent: "You act so
tough/But I know what you're

doing/You think falling in
love/Means falling to ruin" —
from "Turn to You." for exam
ple. The harmony is just right
and is a nice melodic counter
point for Carlisle's wail.
The album is full of up-beat,
high spirited numbers such as
"I'm the Only One," and "Yes
or No," but "Forget That Day,"
a slower song full of foreboding
imagery, ("I remember that
day/Wind pushing birds
around/Trees crashing against
the window/Of a ghost hotel") is
particularly compelling.
