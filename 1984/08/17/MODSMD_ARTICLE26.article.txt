## Some of the summer's most satisfying tunes 
### GWEN OREL 
When I first saw the video to
Sheila E.'s "The Glamorous
Life", I thought, she looked just
like Prince. And sure enough, I
read not long after, that Sheila
E. is Prince's new protege
and/or girlfriend. With this kind
of fanfare how does Sheila E.'s
new album, The Glamorous Life
really stack up?
Very well, indeed. Sheila E.
(short for Escovedo,) plays all
percussion on her album, which
is arranged as a movie concept.
For example, the first side is
referred to as "reel one," and
credits are printed on the back
of the jacket, which claim that
the record is "directed" by
Sheila E. and the Starr Com
pany.
The percussion is uniformly
interesting, and Sheila E. pos
sesses a fine singing voice as
well. When combined with the
talents of some fine back-up
musicians, Sheila E. contributes
to producing some of the sum
mer's catchiest pop/funk
melodies. Her single "The
Glamorous Life," is already be
coming one of the summer's

finest dance tunes, but also
notable is the high spirit of the
"Bell of St. Mark" and the ac
hing beauty of the ballad "Noon
Rendevous," which makes use
of lively castinets as percussion.

I can't rave enough about the
Bangles. Everyone's heard of
the GoGo's, but the Bangles are
still relatively unknown, prob
ably because as far as I know,
they have not yet released a
single.
But the Bangle's latest album,
All Over The Place, features
rock and roll with the chiming,
soaring quality of R.E.M. and
the Byrds, combined with the
catchy pop style of the GoGo's.
However, lead singer Susanna
Hoff has her own unique style.
Vicky Peterson's lead guitar is
outstanding, as are the drums of
Debbie Peterson. All of the
songs on this album are excel
lent as well as diverse. "Dover
Beach," a rephrasing of Ar
nold's famous poem on love and






The GoGos newest album — "Talk Show."
