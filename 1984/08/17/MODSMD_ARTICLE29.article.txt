Cabaret (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse directed this al
together amazing musical, set in
Berlin in 1931. Inspired by the
kabarett-form satirical musicals
of Kurt Weill and Bertolt
Brecht, Fosse uses the numbers
performed by Liza Minnelli and
Joel Grey at the Kit Kat Klub to
comment on the political and so
cial milieu and on the character
of Sally Bowles, the desperately
life-embracing, ultimately self
destructive gamine Minnelli
plays. Musicals don't come much
better than this one, which is
stunningly directed, shot (by
Geoffrey Unsworth),
choreographed (by Fosse, of
course), scored (by John Kander
and Fred Ebb), and designed.
Minnelli and Grey give classic
performances, and there's one
brilliant number after another —
"Mein Herr" (Fosse's tribute to
Marlene Dietrich and The Blue
Angel), "Money," "If You
Could See Her," "Cabaret," and
the shocking sequence at the
beer garden, in which the most
haunting ballad in the score,
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me," ex
plodes into a Nazi anthem. Mi
chael York plays the young
writer based loosely on Chris
topher Isherwood, whose
"Berlin Stories" were the
original source for both stage
and screen versions of Cabaret.
Screenplay by Jay Presson Allen
with Hugh Wheeler.
Plays Sunday and Monday
with Carmen.
The Man Who Came to Din
ner (1941)
Festival, Palo Alto
George S. Kaufman and Moss
Hart based the protagonist of
their 1939 stage play, Sheridan
Whiteside, on the irascible old
sentimentalist Alexander Wool
cott, the celebrated critic and

radio personality and member of
the Algonquin Club. The play, in
which Whiteside slips on the
steps of a house he is visiting on
his lecture tour, takes up
residence within and cows the
unassertive couple who live
there, is a sturdy old warhorse,
rich in caricature and frequently
revived.
This Warner Brothers film is a
little long and fussy, but it
preserves the comedy well. The
screenwriters, Julius J. and
Philip G. Epstein, added a few
superfluous details of their own,
but they didn't leave much out,
and the director, William Keigh
ley, keeps the characters rushing
in and out of the Stanley
household at an acceptable pace.
Whiteside is played by Monty
Woolley, who created the part
on stage, and probably no one
else has stamped so distinctive
and amusing a brand on the
fabulous old codger's insults and
eccentricities.
The other winners in the large
cast are Bette Davis, in whose
hands the drab role of
Whiteside's secretary Maggie
Cutler is practically reborn;
Jimmy Durante as Banjo, based
on Harpo Marx; Reginald Gar
diner as Beverly Carlton, based
on Noel Coward; Billie Burke as
nervous Mrs. Stanley; Mary
Wickes as the much abused
nurse, Miss Preen; and George
Barbier as the insufferable doc
tor who wants to be a writer. As
the venomous actress, Lorraine
Sheldon (read Tallulah
Bankhead), Ann Sheridan lacks
control, though she does have
one funny scene. Richard Travis
is Jefferson, the newspaperman
who sweeps Maggie off her feet
and lures her away from
Whiteside's glamorous world; as
Travis plays him, his influence
over her is the movie's great un
solved mysterv.

Plays through Wednesday
with The Philadelphia Story.
Napoleon (1927)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Kevin Brownlow
reconstructed Abel Gance's
silent epic in 1981 and Carmine
Coppola furnished a splendid
full-length score; one of the
great achievements of film schol
arship, this resurrected over
four-hour Napoieon is a tribute
to one of the world's great direc
tors. One can find plenty that's
wrong with the movie — the
tone of religious awe in some of
the scenes that are meant to
show Napoleon's effect on his
countrymen, the sentimentality
of the return to his family at
Corsica, the tedious Napoleon-
Josephine wooing scenes in Part
Two, and the stiff, Delsartean
acting. (Gance cast for the
qualities he saw in his actors'
faces, and these faces — Albert
Dieudonne's, Gina Manes', An
tonin Artaud's — imprint them
selves on the memory.)
One could argue that Gance's
historical perspective lacks
depth and credibility, but
Napleon isn't a psychological
study of a conqueror, and it isn't
even a view of history — it's
about the excitement of making
movies, about going farther than
anyone ever had before (and
most people have since).
Cameras are attached to horses
and carriages and swing,
pendulum-like, in the great con
vention scene; the screen breaks
up into nine frames to represent
the chaos of a children's pillow
fight; a storm at sea is intercut
with the "storm" at the National
Assembly, and the visualization
of the metaphor lends it stagger
ing force. And at the end, Gance
employs a triptych as a kaleido
scope, to create a panorama, and
for montage. Gance's tone is

joyous and playful; the camera
seems to be grinning.
Plays Sunday.
Oliver! (1968)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A great movie musical. In
adapting the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon
Haris wisely returned to Dick
ens; the dialogue is right out of
Oliver Twist. And the director,
Carol Reed, somehow managed
to capture both the Dickensian
spirit and the essence of musical
comedy; when you think of how
many wrong turns the movie
could have made, the results
seem miraculous. (Just compare
it to most of the big-budget
musicals Hollywood was putting
out in the same era.)
The magnificent cast features
Ron Moody as Fagin, Oliver
Reed as Bill Sikes, Shani Wallis
as Nancy, Harry Secombe as Mr.
Bumble, Mark Lester as Oliver,
and Jack Wild as the Artful
Dodger; Onna White did the
spectacular choreography and
John Box the lovely designs.
This deserving popular success,
probably Carol Reed's best
movie after The Third Man, was
also his last blaze of glory;
though he lived until 1976, he
never again rose to such heights.
Plays tomorrow, Sunday,
Wednesday and Thursday.
The Chant of Jimmie Black
smith (1980)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The Australian director, Fred
Schepisi, adapted a fine 1972
novel by Thomas Keneally about
a young half-white, half
aborigine whose tragedy is his
inability to fit in either world.
Schepisi uses a visual shorthand
that is the perfect equivalent of
Keneally's dense yet terse prose,
and he is able to convey the
emotional tone of a scene just by

the grouping of actors. The film
contains a bold, brilliantly sus
tained operatic climax that is
certain to disturb many viewers.
The performances of Tommy
Lewis, Angela Punch and
Freddy Reynolds could hardly
be better. This is a film of Sop
hoclean power — a masterpiece.
Plays Tuesday with
Walkabout.
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often
hilarious parody of heavy metal
rock, featuring Christopher
Guest, Michael McKean and
Harry Shearer (in a walrus
moustache) as the main mem
bers of the group whose descent
from fame the mock documen
tary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical num
bers aren't as witty as they might
be, except for an imitation
British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Rock and Roll High
School.
Strange Invaders (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Michael Laughlin's sci-fi
movie (written by Laughlin and
William Condon) is obviously
intended to be a parody, but
maybe he got too close to the
tackiness he wanted to send up,
because most of it isn't funny —
just weird, as if the aliens had su
pervised the picture. Paul Le
Mat. Nancy Allen. Diana Scar
wid and Louise Fletchei are the
talented stars who sit around
waiting for someone to explain
the joke to them.
Plays Thursday with The War
of the Worlds.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse directed this al

of Kurt Weill and Bertolt

performed by Liza Minnelli and

comment on the political and so
cial milieu and on the character

life-embracing, ultimately self

plays. Musicals don't come much

The Chant of Jimmie Black
smith (1980)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The Australian director, Fred
Schepisi, adapted a fine 1972
novel by Thomas Keneally about
a young half-white, half
aborigine whose tragedy is his
inability to fit in either world.
Schepisi uses a visual shorthand
that is the perfect equivalent of
Keneally's dense yet terse prose,
and he is able to convey the
emotional tone of a scene just by

the grouping of actors. The film
contains a bold, brilliantly sus
tained operatic climax that is
certain to disturb many viewers.
The performances of Tommy
Lewis, Angela Punch and
Freddy Reynolds could hardly
be better. This is a film of Sop
hoclean power — a masterpiece.
Plays Tuesday with
Walkabout.
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often
hilarious parody of heavy metal
rock, featuring Christopher
Guest, Michael McKean and
Harry Shearer (in a walrus
moustache) as the main mem
bers of the group whose descent
from fame the mock documen
tary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical num
bers aren't as witty as they might
be, except for an imitation
British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Rock and Roll High
School.
Strange Invaders (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Michael Laughlin's sci-fi
movie (written by Laughlin and
William Condon) is obviously
intended to be a parody, but
maybe he got too close to the
tackiness he wanted to send up,
because most of it isn't funny —
just weird, as if the aliens had su
pervised the picture. Paul Le
Mat. Nancy Allen. Diana Scar
wid and Louise Fletchei are the
talented stars who sit around
waiting for someone to explain
the joke to them.
Plays Thursday with The War
of the Worlds.

Cabaret (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse directed this al
together amazing musical, set in
Berlin in 1931. Inspired by the
kabarett-form satirical musicals
of Kurt Weill and Bertolt
Brecht, Fosse uses the numbers
performed by Liza Minnelli and
Joel Grey at the Kit Kat Klub to
comment on the political and so
cial milieu and on the character
of Sally Bowles, the desperately
life-embracing, ultimately self
destructive gamine Minnelli
plays. Musicals don't come much
better than this one, which is
stunningly directed, shot (by
Geoffrey Unsworth),
choreographed (by Fosse, of
course), scored (by John Kander
and Fred Ebb), and designed.
Minnelli and Grey give classic
performances, and there's one
brilliant number after another —
"Mein Herr" (Fosse's tribute to
Marlene Dietrich and The Blue
Angel), "Money," "If You
Could See Her," "Cabaret," and
the shocking sequence at the
beer garden, in which the most
haunting ballad in the score,
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me," ex
plodes into a Nazi anthem. Mi
chael York plays the young
writer based loosely on Chris
topher Isherwood, whose
"Berlin Stories" were the
original source for both stage
and screen versions of Cabaret.
Screenplay by Jay Presson Allen
with Hugh Wheeler.
Plays Sunday and Monday
with Carmen.
The Man Who Came to Din
ner (1941)
Festival, Palo Alto
George S. Kaufman and Moss
Hart based the protagonist of
their 1939 stage play, Sheridan
Whiteside, on the irascible old
sentimentalist Alexander Wool
cott, the celebrated critic and

radio personality and member of
the Algonquin Club. The play, in
which Whiteside slips on the
steps of a house he is visiting on
his lecture tour, takes up
residence within and cows the
unassertive couple who live
there, is a sturdy old warhorse,
rich in caricature and frequently
revived.
This Warner Brothers film is a
little long and fussy, but it
preserves the comedy well. The
screenwriters, Julius J. and
Philip G. Epstein, added a few
superfluous details of their own,
but they didn't leave much out,
and the director, William Keigh
ley, keeps the characters rushing
in and out of the Stanley
household at an acceptable pace.
Whiteside is played by Monty
Woolley, who created the part
on stage, and probably no one
else has stamped so distinctive
and amusing a brand on the
fabulous old codger's insults and
eccentricities.
The other winners in the large
cast are Bette Davis, in whose
hands the drab role of
Whiteside's secretary Maggie
Cutler is practically reborn;
Jimmy Durante as Banjo, based
on Harpo Marx; Reginald Gar
diner as Beverly Carlton, based
on Noel Coward; Billie Burke as
nervous Mrs. Stanley; Mary
Wickes as the much abused
nurse, Miss Preen; and George
Barbier as the insufferable doc
tor who wants to be a writer. As
the venomous actress, Lorraine
Sheldon (read Tallulah
Bankhead), Ann Sheridan lacks
control, though she does have
one funny scene. Richard Travis
is Jefferson, the newspaperman
who sweeps Maggie off her feet
and lures her away from
Whiteside's glamorous world; as
Travis plays him, his influence
over her is the movie's great un
solved mysterv.

Plays through Wednesday
with The Philadelphia Story.
Napoleon (1927)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Kevin Brownlow
reconstructed Abel Gance's
silent epic in 1981 and Carmine
Coppola furnished a splendid
full-length score; one of the
great achievements of film schol
arship, this resurrected over
four-hour Napoieon is a tribute
to one of the world's great direc
tors. One can find plenty that's
wrong with the movie — the
tone of religious awe in some of
the scenes that are meant to
show Napoleon's effect on his
countrymen, the sentimentality
of the return to his family at
Corsica, the tedious Napoleon-
Josephine wooing scenes in Part
Two, and the stiff, Delsartean
acting. (Gance cast for the
qualities he saw in his actors'
faces, and these faces — Albert
Dieudonne's, Gina Manes', An
tonin Artaud's — imprint them
selves on the memory.)
One could argue that Gance's
historical perspective lacks
depth and credibility, but
Napleon isn't a psychological
study of a conqueror, and it isn't
even a view of history — it's
about the excitement of making
movies, about going farther than
anyone ever had before (and
most people have since).
Cameras are attached to horses
and carriages and swing,
pendulum-like, in the great con
vention scene; the screen breaks
up into nine frames to represent
the chaos of a children's pillow
fight; a storm at sea is intercut
with the "storm" at the National
Assembly, and the visualization
of the metaphor lends it stagger
ing force. And at the end, Gance
employs a triptych as a kaleido
scope, to create a panorama, and
for montage. Gance's tone is

joyous and playful; the camera
seems to be grinning.
Plays Sunday.
Oliver! (1968)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A great movie musical. In
adapting the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon
Haris wisely returned to Dick
ens; the dialogue is right out of
Oliver Twist. And the director,
Carol Reed, somehow managed
to capture both the Dickensian
spirit and the essence of musical
comedy; when you think of how
many wrong turns the movie
could have made, the results
seem miraculous. (Just compare
it to most of the big-budget
musicals Hollywood was putting
out in the same era.)
The magnificent cast features
Ron Moody as Fagin, Oliver
Reed as Bill Sikes, Shani Wallis
as Nancy, Harry Secombe as Mr.
Bumble, Mark Lester as Oliver,
and Jack Wild as the Artful
Dodger; Onna White did the
spectacular choreography and
John Box the lovely designs.
This deserving popular success,
