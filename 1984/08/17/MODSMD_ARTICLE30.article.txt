Punta Huete, Nicaragua â€” Nicaragua acknowl
edged for the first time yesterday that it is building a
large military airport, as the Reagan administration
has claimed, and took journalists on a tour of it.
Defense Ministry spokeswoman Capt. Rosa Pasos
said the facility outside this town 13 miles northeast
of Managua would be capable of handling "all types
of planes." She said work on the airport began two

avoid a situation "such as happened in Grenada."

airstrip, with the intention of accomodating Soviet
aircraft.
