Tulsa, Oklahoma — U.S. Jaycees voted over
whelmingly yesterday to admit women to their
ranks, but President Tommy Todd says he felt
"mixed emotions" about the step.
The vote at a special meeting of delegates from
across the country came six weeks after a unanimous
U.S. Supreme Court ruling that forced the Jaycees
to admit women to Jaycees chapters in Minnesota.
The Minnesota lawsuit cited that state's public ac
commodations law barring discrimination on the
basis of sex. Jaycees officials said 37 states have such
laws. Todd, who presides over the 270,000-member
leadership training organization from its Tulsa
headquarters, said the Jaycees' goal for the future is
to become America's greatest young people's or
ganization.
The vote was 5372 to 386, with 77 abstentions.
About 600 people attended the convention, but
state Jaycees presidents can cast ballots representing
the opinion of their state organizations.
