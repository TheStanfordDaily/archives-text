# Self-defense teaches mind, body control

### MONICA GRIGORY 
Violent crime has become more
prevalent here — the many rape at
tempts over the past couple of years are
but one example. In response, an in
creasing number of women and men are
seeking to protect themselves without
using weapons.
The martial arts are founded on scien
tific principles of the body that develop
the karate, aikido or judo devotee into a
healthy person both physically and men
tally. The martial arts student also has
the element of surprise on his side; after
all, the judo player knows that you are
going to try a throw, but in self-defense
no one expects the kind of moves
borrowed from judo.
All the martial arts share similar
qualities, such as having to develop si
multaneously command of mind and
body. This quality becomes evident in
the three directions: physical art, sport,
and self defense, but all are based on the
same fundamental aspects for each dis
cipline (i.e. aikido, judo, karate and tai
chi).
Practitioners of the martial arts use no
artificial weapons. The natural weapons
of the body — feet, hands, elbows, etc.
— become silent weapons that respond
when necessary with lightning-like
speed. While the martial arts are the ul-»
timate in weaponless defense, their main

usefulness and direction is their all
encompassing physical and mental
growth. Namely, the conditioning
process, according to martial arts ex
perts, develops reflexes, excellent coor
dination and an over-all healthy body.
A certain attitude is prevalent among
all these methods of self-defense. This
attitude encompasses determination and
courage displayed in every martial art. A
master (the instructor) showcases the at
titude. His manner appears calm and
easy. One can sense humility, the ab
sence of preconceived thoughts, and
above all self-confidence.
The mysticism that surrounds much of
the martial arts is immediately dismissed
by Greg Hoffman, the Stanford tai chi
instructor. "Mysticism is a product of the
teacher not the art," he said. What the
arts in fact do, Hoffman says, is to "tap
the mystical things in your body that
know the right way to go about it [life]."
Willie Cahill, the judo instructor on
campus, is a sixth-degree blackbelt in
judo and eighth-degree in jujitsu; he was
the men's coach for the '83 Pan Ameri
can Games and the coach for the 1984
Olympic judo team. He sees the various
types of martial arts generally attracting
different types of people.
For example, karate as attracting the
