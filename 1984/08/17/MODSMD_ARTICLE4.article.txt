# Self-defense teaches mind, body control
## 
### MONICA GRIGORY 
Violent crime has become more
prevalent here — the many rape at
tempts over the past couple of years are
but one example. In response, an in
creasing number of women and men are
seeking to protect themselves without
using weapons.
The martial arts are founded on scien
tific principles of the body that develop
the karate, aikido or judo devotee into a
healthy person both physically and men
tally. The martial arts student also has
the element of surprise on his side; after
all, the judo player knows that you are
going to try a throw, but in self-defense
no one expects the kind of moves
borrowed from judo.
All the martial arts share similar
qualities, such as having to develop si
multaneously command of mind and
body. This quality becomes evident in
the three directions: physical art, sport,
and self defense, but all are based on the
same fundamental aspects for each dis
cipline (i.e. aikido, judo, karate and tai
chi).
Practitioners of the martial arts use no
artificial weapons. The natural weapons
of the body — feet, hands, elbows, etc.
— become silent weapons that respond
when necessary with lightning-like
speed. While the martial arts are the ul-»
timate in weaponless defense, their main

usefulness and direction is their all
encompassing physical and mental
growth. Namely, the conditioning
process, according to martial arts ex
perts, develops reflexes, excellent coor
dination and an over-all healthy body.
A certain attitude is prevalent among
all these methods of self-defense. This
attitude encompasses determination and
courage displayed in every martial art. A
master (the instructor) showcases the at
titude. His manner appears calm and
easy. One can sense humility, the ab
sence of preconceived thoughts, and
above all self-confidence.
The mysticism that surrounds much of
the martial arts is immediately dismissed
by Greg Hoffman, the Stanford tai chi
instructor. "Mysticism is a product of the
teacher not the art," he said. What the
arts in fact do, Hoffman says, is to "tap
the mystical things in your body that
know the right way to go about it [life]."
Willie Cahill, the judo instructor on
campus, is a sixth-degree blackbelt in
judo and eighth-degree in jujitsu; he was
the men's coach for the '83 Pan Ameri
can Games and the coach for the 1984
Olympic judo team. He sees the various
types of martial arts generally attracting
different types of people.
For example, karate as attracting the
exceptionally active individuals, those
with excess energy find an outlet in the
physical demands of this particular sport.
While those who have no great need to
release a great amount of energy are
generally attracted to one of the less
physically demanding arts, such as tai chi
or aikido.
The renewed interest in self-defense
techniques, in particular the martial arts,
is attributed to several causes. Some see
martial arts as a means to protect
themsleves in an increasingly violent
world.
Hoffman attributes the resurgence to a
combination of factors: the influx of
Taiwanese and Chinese immigrants set
tling in the United States — in particular
San Francisco and New York — is one
possible explanation.
Recreation is another. In a society
"geared toward productivity" the martial
arts afford a change of pace away from
everyday stress and toward relaxation.
The third possible reason for taking up
a martial art is for the obvious health
benefits. The benefits of the various self
defense movements extend from the al
ways reassuring "mental and physical
strength" to the athlete's edge on lon
gevity, resistance to disease and lower
blood pressure.
The martial arts offer pleasure, excite
ment and satisfaction of a competitive
sport without the risk of bodily injury
that abounds in other sports. A student is
not allowed to compete until he has mas
tered the art of self-control. Injuries are
rare in the martial arts. The martial arts
use all the muscles of the body and
produce a symmetrical and balanced
muscle development. They promote
posture correction and correct use of the
body. Perhaps most importantly the arts
can be adopted to both sexes and all
ages.
Students who take up a martial art, for
whatever reason, usually stay with it
once they pass the raw beginnings ol
their chosen art. After this "critical
point" is passed the martial arts become
"self perpetuating," be it for competi
tion, relaxation or sheer joy.
Karate (car-ah-tay) is the oriental art

and science of self-defense. Karate was
introduced in Okinawa as a means for
self-defense for people who had no
weapons. Its usefulness as a method of
self-defense decreased, with the passage
of time, but increased as a system of
physical conditioning — in fact, schools
began teaching it in their PE classes.
Today karate is becoming popular as a
sport. The keen reflexes of the karate
practitioner, as in the other martial art
techniques discussed, are so accurate
that he is able to spar with another stu
dent without the need for protective
equipment.
Legend has it that approximately 5000
years ago a prince lived in India and
developed the first primitive version of a
weaponless defense. The prince studied
the animal's movements of self-defense

Tai chi also offers competition 'whsuf which is faster
paced than the much more commonly practiced slow
tai chi; the competition consists of what is known in tai
chi as 'push hands' until one competitor pushes the
other off balance with any number of moves.

and applied these techniques to the
human body. He experimented with his
slaves to find the weak points in the
human body. He located, at the cost of
100 odd slaves, all the body's pressure
points and weak points.
This primitive sytem was further
refined by a Buddhist monk who used
this primitive self-defense as a way of
teaching Chinese peasants Zen Bud
dhism. Even though his exercise was de
signed mainly to give them the
experience of enlightenment, it became
the foundation of the Chinese ch'uan-fa
or the Japanese kempo.
There are three types of karate:
karate-sho is the showy style of karate
that teaches the spectacular aspects of
the art. Jijitsu-karate consists of some
self-defense movements taken from the
"original" karate. Karate-do is the
"way" of karate as a concept of life: the
individual desiring to learn about the at
titudes and philosophy of the Orient will
find it possible through the study of
karate-do.
Judo is a remnant of ancient Japan, a

feudal society. Jujitsu is the art of fight
ing with one's hands and in ancient Japan
it developed into a lethal science. Slowly
the ancient martial arts disappeared as
Japan entered the modern age with
newer and more effective weapons.
However, in 1882, Jigoja Karo ret
hought the techniques of jujitsu and
eliminated dangerous elements, such as
foot and hand strikes, and came up with
his new sport, judo.
Tai chi also offer competition "whsu"
which ts faster paced than fhe much more
commonly practiced slow tai chi: the
competition consist of what is known in
tai chi as "push hands' until one compet
itor pushes the other off balance with any
number of moves.
The secret of judo is simply maneuver
ing a stronger opponent into a position

where he can't use his full strength
against you and where you may use your
full strength to greatest advantage.
Easier said than done, for one must capi
talize on the opponent's weaknesses and
his emotions. Balance and timing are the
keys.
Cahill sees judo as the only martial art
with "hands on experience." For in judo
the students learn through trial and error
— error results in going down with rather
significant impact. He views the other
martial arts as more "theoretical as
opposed to practical." While in aikido
the partners never actively resist a move
and in karate the blows are always
deflected in practice, Cahill observes that
the judo training "doesn't encourage a
mental block." To Cahill, the confidence
in your ability is the ultimate self
defense.
As in all of the martial arts a dis
ciplined courtesy is an intrinsic part of
judo, it helps to instill control of one's
emotions. Self-defense is the usual moti
vation for the students initial enrollment,
but eventually the competitive aspect

becomes the prime mover.
Aikido (ay-kido) means harmony with
the forces of nature and is the newest of
of the martial arts. It is non-competitive
and non-violent.
Frank Doran has taught aikido for 12
years at Stanford and some of his student
have been with that long. He is a former
cop and hand to hand combat instructor
in the U.S. Marines who came to aikido
25 years ago. The movements can be
used in an attack situation, but to Doran
self-defense takes on an added dimen
sion in aikido: "winning over discord
within oneself."
Aikido is more than a physical art.
Into its techniques are woven elements
of philosophy, psychology and dynamics.
Students find that practicing aikido
teaches them to "concentrate and unify
the mind and body so they function as
one."
This modern martial art had its origins
in jujitsu and Japanese swordsmanship,
spear and staff movements. As with most
of the martial arts offered here at Stan
ford it is "empty handed," that is, no
weapons are used in exercising the skill,
although all the motions can be used with
a weapon in hand since they are derived
from movements associated with
weaponry.
Although the techniques learned in
the art can, if necessary be used to
disable the attacker, students are taught
the art of non-resistance. "Instead of
getting into a fighting mode students stay
calm and observant and receive the at
tack gently and return it in such a way
that no one is harmed," Doran says.
Like aikido, tai chi (tie gee), "the ul
timate supreme," is more of a way of
looking at life rather than a sport. If
you've ever been walking out behind
Tresidder in the late afternoon you've
probably witnessed what appears to be a
rather peculiar spectacle, in the small
grove of woods out back Bowman
Alumni House, a group of students un
der the direction of Greg Hoffman learns
the ancient it somewhat mysterious mar
tial art tai chi. Known as the "oriental
shadow boxingtai chi is offered to the
Stanford faculty, staff and students
around the year through the Stanford
Club program.
Technically tai chi is the odd
man out of such martial arts as
judo, aikido and karate, because
its origin is China instead of
Japan and for its lack of
"confrontation." Tai Chi is a
lonely dance, ideally of total
relaxation almost to the point of
meditation. Followers of tai chi
swear by its soothing powers
releasing them from the
"terrible world of certainty."
The development of tai chi as
a form of physical exercise has
been greatly influenced by the
naturalist philosophy. In tai chi,
the objective has not been to
overcome but rather "to strive
to oneness with the nature of
oneself." Tai chi students also
study the complementary nature
of "yin" and "yang," of "action
and inaction," and of "firmness
and softness."
The idea in tai chi is to relax
the muscles and allow the "chi"

or internal strength to provide
the energy as opposed to the ex
ternal muscular strength — all
of this is done slowly as to
generate internal energy. Tai chi
is based on balance, coordina
tion and inner strength, which is
learned. The basic premise in tai
chi as in aikido as avoidance in
stead of counterattack; the stu
dent, if ever placed in an attack
situation, would be looking for
an opening in his attackers
defenses.
Students find the martial art
"physically active and mentally
relaxing." Like the rest of the
martial arts tai chi doesn't re
quire any gymnastic or athletic
ability: "anyone can do it and
benefit from it."
The Stanford Club Sport Pro
gram offers numerous classes in
the art of self-defense — tai chi,
karate, judo and aikido, to
name just a few. Instructors are
highly skilled in their particular
tield, and these courses are
available throughout the year
for one unit of PE credit.
