## De Lorean cleared of guilt in drug conspiracy 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” A federal jury found John
De Lorean innocent yesterday of all eight counts
in a $24 million cocaine conspiracy indictment,
repudiating a government "sting" that promised
him money to save his car company from bank
ruptcy.
"Praise the Lord!" De Lorean, 59, exclaimed as
the judge's clerk read the verdicts, ending an in
ternationally publicized ordeal of nearly two years
that began with his arrest on Oct. 19, 1982.
"I'm pleased it's all over, and I hopefully can
get back to my life," he told reporters later. "It's
been an absolute horror."
He said that "as a Christian I hold no
animosity," toward the government, but later,
asked whether his life had been irreparably
harmed, he responded wryly: "Well, outside of
the tact that I've aged about 600 years in the last
two and that life as a hardworking industrialist has
been tattered and torn, I don't know. Would you
buy a used car from me?"
Some jurors said they felt De Lorean was guilty
of the acts with which he was charged, but ac
quitted him because the judge instructed them to
do so if they felt he was not "predisposed" to
commit the crimes and the government had
entrapped him with its undercover operation.
Had it not been for that instruction, "We would
have had a hung jury," said one juror, identified
only as No. 36. None of the eight jurors who met
with reporters after the verdict gave their names.
"I think the important thing to come out of this
case is there is going to be an impact on the
future, said juror No. 140, an accountant. "The
way the government agents operated in this case
was not appropriate, and I look forward to the
future favorable impact of this case on the
country."
1 he jury of six men and six women took 29
hours of deliberations over seven days to reach its
unanimous verdict, but said there was only one
vote taken on each count.
In court, his wife, model Cristina Ferrare, fell
into the arms of her mother, Renata, and the two
women burst into tears. Sobs from his supporters
echoed through the courtroom as the jurors were
polled individually, and De Lorean himself burst
into tears as he left the courtroom.

De Lorean, who never took the stand during
the five-month trial, could have been sentenced to
67 years in prison and fined $ 185,000 if convicted
on all eight counts.
In emotional closing arguments, prosecutors
depicted De Lorean as a greedy madman "who
did shake hands with the devil," while the defense
said the automaker "signifies the American
dream" and was an innocent victim of a ruthless
trap set up by opportunistic government agents.
In a post-verdict news conference, defense at
torney Howard Weitzman praised the jury as
"courageous" and said, "They sent out a message
to the Department of Justice that you can't do to
our citizens what you did to John De Lorean. We
hope the government thinks before it jumps, even
though they may get a cover in Time and
Newsweek."
Outside court, one of the prosecutors, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Robert Perry, told reporters, "I've
had not guilty verdicts before, but this is a great
shock."
In a statement, U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner
said, "The jury has spoken; that is the heart of our
criminal justice system. As all who believe in our
system must, we accept the verdict."
A hush fell over the jammed courtroom as,
shortly after 12:20 p.m. PDT, U.S. District Judge
Robert Takasugi accepted the verdict form from
the jury foreman, a white-haired man. The
judge's clerk, Tamara Saunders, then read the
words, "We the jury ... find John Z. De Lorean
not guilty of count one."
After they left the courtroom, the jurors sent
word that they wanted to meet with De Lorean
personally, and he went to the judge's chambers
to see them.
In Washington, Justice Department spokesman
John Russell said the attorney general would have
no comment and referred questions to the U.S. at
torney in Los Angeles.
FBI Director William Webster had no com
ment, but the agency issued this statement: "The
181 does not discuss the decisions reached in a
trial and the De Lorean case is no exception. The
FBI in concert with the U.S. attorney presented
its case in a very professional manner and accepts
the verdict of the jury."

NOT GUILTY: Automaker John De Lorean was found innocent
