Washington (AP) —
President Ronald Reagan,
decrying parents who ignore the
needs of their children, signed
legislation yesterday aimed at
recovering an estimated $4 bil
lion a year in lost child support
payments by automatically
withholding wages from parents
whose payments are 30 days
late.
"The goal of our efforts is not
just the transfer of funds,"
Reagan said in remarks
prepared for delivery at a sign
ing ceiemony at a National
Symposium on Child Support.
"We also hope to discourage
abandonment, and if families do
split up, to encourage the absent
parents to invest time and love
in their children," he said.
The legislation, which applies
to all families who receive child
support payments, not just
those who are eligible for
welfare, also provides for inter
state enforcement of child sup
port orders.

In addition, it allows liens to
be imposed on property when
payments are in arrears, pro
vides for reporting child
support debts to consumer
credit agencies and intercepting
state income tax refunds in
delinquent cases.
It also extends to non-welfare
case interception of federal tax
refunds to delinquent parents.
David Levy, spokesman for
Fathers United for Equal Rights
and Women's Coalition, issued
a statement saying: "We non
custodial parents are more than
money machines— it is a shame
there is nothing in this child sup
port bill assuring visitation en
forcement by the same case
workers in the states who will be
enforcing support collection."
He said denial of visitation
was "a national disgrace," and
asserted that "50 percent of
dads are denied visitation by
vindictive moms and Congress
has done nothing to help
children in this regard."
