# GOP finishes drafting conservative platform
## 
### 
Dallas (AP) — Republicans completed an
unabashedly conservative platform draft yes
terday, forbidding endorsement of the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) and embracing de
velopment of the Midgetman missile system.
"When the president reads this document, he
will love it," said platform chairman Trent
Lott.
The platform gave little comfort to
moderates, urging prayer in public schools and
passage of a strict anti-abortion amendment to
the Constitution and declaring that any tax in
crease would harm the economic recovery.
"We are a conservative party and we have a
conservative candidate ... In no way are we
uncomfortable with a conservative document,"
said Drew Lewis, Reagan's emissary to the
platform committee.
Lott predicted the president "will love it,"
and so will the delegates who vote their ap
proval next Tuesday night.
A White House spokesman said Reagan's
only reservation is a plank accusing the Federal
Reserve of "destabilizing actions." But Lott, a
Mississippi congressman, said the provision
was "the mildest language" possible, and

doubted there would be any change.
Lott said he knew of no plans by dissenting
moderates to seek a minority plank on the con
vention floor, even on the social issues.
Anti-ERA leader Phyllis Schlafly called the
ERA "a dead issue . . . like Prohibition."
The platform committee would not even ac
cept watered-down language endorsing "equal
rights, equal opportunities and equal responsi
bilities" for women.
It left Republicans who favor the ERA with
far less than in 1980, when the party
abandoned 40 years' support for the amend
ment but offered respect for the "legitimate ef
forts" of those working on both sides of the
issue. Reagan's daughter Maureen was among
those working for the ERA, but the president
himself is staunchly opposed.
Moderates have complained all week about
the conservative tilt to the platform, cautioning
it could harm the party in fall elections. But
Betty Murphy, who headed the National Labor
Relations Board under President Ford, said it
was "insulting" to suggest that women would
vote Democratic solely because of the ERA.
