# Local sites may be added to EPA 'superfund' list

San Jose (AP) â€” Chemical leaks from
electronic companies, some of which
threaten drinking water supplies with
cancer-causing substances, could put
Silicon Valley on the government's list of
the nation's worst hazardous-waste sites.
Environmental Protection Agency of
ficials in Washington, D.C., have final
approval over whether the estimated 13
to 20 chemical leaks go on the
"superfund" list, as proposed by the
EPA regional office in San Francisco.
Harry Seraydarian, director of the
toxics and waste management division in

the EPA's regional office, said he
planned to discuss the South Bay con
tamination at a community meeting last
night.
"What we want to deal with is the
regional problem," he said. "We'd like
to look at the whole area because there
might be additional sites that haven't
been identified."
He said a review of files and reports by
the Regional Water Quality Control
Board identified 13 sites EPA officials
believe meet the criteria for a superfund

site and seven others that might qualify.
The meeting's sponsor, the Silicon
Valley Toxics Coalition, has demanded
the EPA clean up an estimated 120 con
taminated sites in Silicon Valley and sue
industry to recover the costs.
Seraydarian said the exact location of
the sites won't be revealed until the su
perfund list is published in October.
However, the contaminated area the
EPA is studying includes Mountain
View, Cupertino, Santa C\ara, Sunny
vale, Milpitas, San Jose, Palo Alto, East

Palo Alto and Livermore.
"We're pleased that they're finally
taking action, and we realize they never
would have if we hadn't kicked up a
fuss," said Ted Smith, chairman of the
coalition that includes labor and environ
mental groups. "But it's certainly not
enough."
If the sites are added to the EPA's
"superfund" list, the agency can use its
authority and money to clean \t up.
There are now 546 sites on the super
fund list, 1 9 of them in California.
