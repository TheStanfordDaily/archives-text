# Willow debate goes on
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
Palo Alto is clearing the way
for Stanford to extend Willow
Road to El Camino Real, but
the terms it is recommending
may make the project too ex
pensive for the University to
complete.
The proposed Willow Road
extension, said Nancy Watt,
project co-ordinator at the
Stanford Real Estate office, is
expected to cost $2.1 million.
The conditions the Palo Alto

Planning Commission has at
tached would cost an additional
$2.5 million, more than dou
bling the original projection.
On Wednesday night, the
Palo Alto Planning Commission
decided 4-2 to recommend to
the City Council that the Uni
versity's proposed Willow Road
improvement be approved, but
only if Stanford made specific
modifications to the project.
The requirements the Com
mission has asked for include a

new bridge over San Fran
cisquito Creek, a sound barrier
between Willow Road and some
Menlo Park neighborhoods, an
agreement to prevent direct
traffic from Willow Road to
Alma Street across El Camino,
an expanded intersection at
Santa Cruz Avenue and a third
lane along Willow Road from
Pasteur Drive to Sand Hill
Road.
The University has "not yet
officially responded" to the
Planning Commission's condi
tions, said Watt.
Other University officials feel
that Stanford will never un
dertake the Willow Road proj
ect at a price of $4.6 million.
But even if the University
were to agree to the doubled
cost, the project could still be
killed other ways.
One modification, the expan
sion of the Willow Road-Santa
Cruz Avenue intersection,
would require approval from
Menlo Park's City Council.
Menlo Park officials have
repeatedly spoken against the
project, saying the increased
traffic will disrupt existing
Menlo Park traffic patterns.
Two Menlo Park Council mem
bers are affiliated with the Uni
versity, making them ineligible
to vote on the matter. Of the
remaining three, two have indi
cated they are opposed to the
project.
For years, Stanford students
living on the west side of
campus have had to contend

with diverted traffic from Palm
Drive to Alpine Road via
Campus Drive, the Stanford
Shopping Center parking lot
and the Hospital/Medical Cen
ter access roads. In addition, the
northwest end of Stanford and
the surrounding area are
literally cut off from El Camino
Real and Palo Alto by the maze
of roads and parking lots.
University planners long have
recognized the need for better
access to the Hospital from the
east end of the Peninsula and
the dangers of directing that
traffk through the Shopping
Center parking lot. The use of
campus streets and the parking
lot by westbound traffic has
created congestion and hazar
dous driving conditions on many
of the inner campus roads as
well.
An extended Willow Road,
sav University officials, would
solve both problems.
Palo Alto residents, however,
have been concerned about an
increase in traffic crossing El
Camino from Willow Road,
adding traffic to the residential
Alma Street. The University has
agreed to place a barrier on El
Camino preventing such a cross
ing.

Menlo Park has been against
the project, hut it is not subject
to the city's approval. The in
creased traffic to Sand Hill
Road and to Menlo Park's busi
ness district via Santa Cruz Ave
nue would disrupt current pat
terns as well as add traffic to the
already crowded Menlo Park
area on El Camino Real. Mem
bers of the council have
threatened to sue should Palo
Alto and Stanford continue with
the project.
The provision that Stanford
get approval from Menlo Park
for the expansion of the Santa

Cruz Avenue intersection has
given the officials an avenue for
stopping the project short of
taking it to court.
A third lane from Pasteur
Drive to Sand Hill Road on Wil
low Road, as well as the pro
posed sound barrier, would
dramatically increase the costs
of the project. As a result, Stan
ford may have to abandon it as
too expensive.
This is the second time in
recent years that the Palo Alto
Planning Commision has rec
ommended that a Stanford
Project be revised — thus in

creasing attendant costs — in
order to obtain the Council's
approval.
The Stanford West Housing
Project was shelved last year as
too expensive because of re
quirements added by Palo Alto.
Ihe Palo Alto City Council
will vote on the recommenda
tion at its Sept. 11 meeting. If
the Council approves the re
commendation, the next step for
project approval would be
Menlo Park's. It has not indi
cated when its vote on the Wil

expansion might be.

Project be revised — thus in

creasing attendant costs — in
order to obtain the Council's
approval.
The Stanford West Housing
Project was shelved last year as
too expensive because of re
quirements added by Palo Alto.
Ihe Palo Alto City Council
will vote on the recommenda
tion at its Sept. 11 meeting. If
the Council approves the re
commendation, the next step for
project approval would be
Menlo Park's. It has not indi
cated when its vote on the Wil
low Road-Santa Cruz Avenue
expansion might be.
