# Willow debate goes on
## 
### BILL MARTIN 
Palo Alto is clearing the way
for Stanford to extend Willow
Road to El Camino Real, but
the terms it is recommending
may make the project too ex
pensive for the University to
complete.
The proposed Willow Road
extension, said Nancy Watt,
project co-ordinator at the
Stanford Real Estate office, is
expected to cost $2.1 million.
The conditions the Palo Alto

Planning Commission has at
tached would cost an additional
$2.5 million, more than dou
bling the original projection.
On Wednesday night, the
Palo Alto Planning Commission
decided 4-2 to recommend to
the City Council that the Uni
versity's proposed Willow Road
improvement be approved, but
only if Stanford made specific
modifications to the project.
The requirements the Com
mission has asked for include a

new bridge over San Fran
cisquito Creek, a sound barrier
between Willow Road and some
Menlo Park neighborhoods, an
agreement to prevent direct
traffic from Willow Road to
Alma Street across El Camino,
an expanded intersection at
Santa Cruz Avenue and a third
lane along Willow Road from
Pasteur Drive to Sand Hill
Road.
