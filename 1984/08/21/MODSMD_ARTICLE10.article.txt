# Shuttle's future launch site not safe, says NBC
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” The
space shuttle's 1985 launch
site at Vandenberg Air Force
Base has "significant" tech
nical problems that Air
Force inspectors say could
result in the shuttle blowing
up upon liftoff, NBC News
reported yesterday.
Oxygen storage area
valves were contaminated
with sand and metal parti
cles; liquid was in cables be
tween the command center
and the launch pad; and
piping valve welds were
cracked, according to reports
written July 27 by the prime
contractor, Martin Marietta
Corp., and obtained by the
network.
These defects created what
the report called a "potential
for catastrophic failure,"
NBC reported.
"It's an accident waiting to
happen," according to one
Air Force inspector who was
not identified by the net
work. The inspectors said the
chances were one in five that
the shuttle would blow up
upon launch.
"Quality has taken a back
seat, the schedule is driving
it, safety isn't important,"
said another, unidentified
Air Force inspector.

An Air Force investigation
was cited as concluding last
month that defective welding
"had gone undetected for
over a year," and that there
was "practically no quality
control surveillance" by
Martin Marietta or the Air
Force.
Air Force Col. Walter
Yager, the project manager,
told NBC that welding stain
less steel was a difficult job
and that "it was probably
done in haste to get the job
done and in a very adverse
environment."
William Harwood, direc
tor of public relations for
Martin Marietta in Bethesda,
Maryland, told The Associ
ated Press last night that he
had not seen the report and
could not comment.
According to NASA plans,
the shuttle Discovery is
scheduled to lift off from the
California air base in Octo
ber 1985, the first time one
of the reusable space vehicles
will leave from the West
Coast.
The Air Force favors
launching military payloads
aboard the shuttle from Van
denberg because the shuttle
can be put into a north-south
polar orbit.
