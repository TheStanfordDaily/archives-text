## John McDonough Olympics bring out heroic spirit at Tresidder 
### 
The Olympic Games have allowed us
to cheer for a number of heroes. A very
young girl demonstrates what real grit
and determination are all about as she
sweeps the gymnastics competition. A
swimmer hands over her newly-won
medal to her crippled brother. A gifted
track-and-fielder runs and jumps and

relays to the tune of four gold medals.
Yes, I was amazed. And just about
everyone I've spoken to about the
Games has also been amazed in some
way.
But "amazement" is a funny thing.
While the Olympics, a good report card
and breakdancing are easy to be amazed
by, there are also those events that come
along every now and then which gently
prod us into the spiritual state of amaze
ment. Amazement can sneak up on us
from behind, and before we know it
we've forgotten about ourselves and our
little kingdoms of worry. We haven't
searched for amazement. We haven't
asked for it. We've merely gone about
our daily business with perhaps nothing
more than an attentive eye.
Amazement came upon me by surprise
this summer while 1 helped sell Olympic
Soccer tickets at Tresidder Ticket Office.
Beginning in early July, lines much
longer than the usual three or four
formed outside the ticket office door.
With each passing day the lines grew

ever longer, until the wait time reached
an hour-and-a-half by the end of the
month.
When crowds first began to form, my
Olympic Games perspective became
split. On the one hand, I envisioned the
superstar athletes preparing to give their
heroic best for the Gold. On the other
hand, I saw the "ordinary people" line
the halls of Tresidder, each with
meetings to make, children to feed, or
textbooks to study. Ah, I thought, what a
contrast. Did anyone have to ask me
which party I cared to join? (And my
first choice would have been a spot on
the volleyball team, thank you.)
But I was soon to find out that these
were not ordinary people at all. Over the
four weeks of intense ticket selling I
became intrigued and amazed by the
Olympic ticket buyers. At first, I viewed
my part in the Olympics with a fair bit of
skeptical boredom. I'd open the door
each morning to begin selling and there'd
be sixty people standing in the hallway
staring at me. "Here we go again" was
my attitude at the outset. As time went
by, however, I was compelled to see my
own blindness. The majesty of life that I
sought on television was all right there
before me, every day, at work.
The first bit of amazement came when
I noticed that, for the most part, these
waiting Olympics fans were patient. I
found myself performing mental double
takes every so often when I noticed that
after waiting an hour in a hot hallway

these people weren't angry, weren't yel
ling in indignation (as I've seen happen
at other large-scale events). And these
people were more than patient. Many —
very many — of the people would strike
up conversations with neighbors. By the
time they reached the cash register, these
twos and threes were chatting amicably,
so amicably in fact that the office staff
had to forcefully interrupt in order to sell
tickets. My gut feeling is that friendships
developed right and left. I even noticed
several instances where a number of
people who'd just met would buy their
seats together.
As soon as my dull-witted understand
ing became enlivened by this unique
crowd I began noticing other things,
small things one might not give second
thought to on a busy day. Fathers and
mothers, usually forsaking part of their
work day, wanted the best seats for the
"whole family". Usually , there were
classic conference periods among family
members or friends as to which game
should be attended. There were always
those who gave compliments to our staff
in the nicest way possible. These, re
member, were people who had stood in
line for what seemed like centuries and
did not need to compliment anyone.
Vivid images will always remain in my
mind. I remember the mechanic who was
so excited to obtain Olympics tickets he
kept repeating, "It's not every day you
get to see the Olympics in your own back

yard!" I remember the steadfast old wo
man who waited in line to buy a ticket for
her wheelchair-ridden husband. I re
member the maintenance worker whose
walkie-talkie sounded just as he pur
chased his tickets, "Okay," he said into
the device, "I've bought the tickets and
I'm returning now."
And so I've come to a conclusion
about my small part in the Olympics. I
believe I saw as many heroes at Tresid
der Ticket Office as I did on television.
And for all the "sought after" amaze
ment I experienced in watching the
Olympics, I believe a longer-lasting
amazement has made me more aware of
who people are. Each person is gifted
with the potential to be a friend, a hel
per, a converser, a mom. The person who
cultivates one of these gifts is hero
enough for me, with or without the Gold.
The many "cultivators" I saw in the
ticket lines reminded me that lasting vic
tory comes in the small things of life, not
necessarily on the grand playing fields
and arenas. Though perhaps the small
and the grand were, in a sense, in
separable during the Olympics. Perhaps
the Olympic presence brings out a little
of the noble, the heroic, in all of us. Per
haps. All I know is that I heard a lot of
friendly words, a lot of patience and a lot
of humor in a lot of very long lines.
Yes indeed, I was amazed.
