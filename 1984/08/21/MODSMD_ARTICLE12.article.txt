## Cohn's letters challenging 
### 
I don't know why we seem to
be doomed to agree or disagree
for the wrong reasons, as often
as for the right reasons. 1 won't
even venture a guess.
The responses to ideas ex
pressed by Prof. Robert Cohn
(That Cohn!) — on feminism,
the draft, computer literacy etc.
and most recently "the glory of
French art' 1 and the creative
"spirit" — can generally be put
in the former category: they are
for the most part wrong-headed,
in disagreement for the wrong
reasons. Sometimes, indeed, 1
have the impression that the
responses have little to do with
his letters.
His last two letters in The
Daily were, in my opinion, as
meaningful and pertinent as they
were elegantly written. Taken as
a whole, as they were obviously
meant to be, they fit no gener
ally accepted definition of
"dogmatic".
On the contrary, they show a

willingness to engage in public
debate on a level to which most
of us are apparently not ac
customed. He is appropriately
sweeping and incisive, and he
always brings his enviable erudi
tion and wit to bear on his cho
sen topic. He seems to be as
king: Is anyone out there?
1 still wonder how such a bril
liant scholar and thoughtful
teacher reacts to the mainly
knee-jerk, responses that his let
ters receive. After reading his
pro-draft ideas, I told him to his
scholarly face that this country
does not need a draft, that a
draft in a nuclear age is absurd,
etc.
He did not dismiss my argu
ments, cover me with invectives
in several languages, kick me in
the butt nor show me the door.
We had a nice chat.(He talks as
well as he writes.) We reached
for and found a level of discus
sion, because we were (and are)

trying to find solutions — per
sonal and otherwise — to a cru
cial problem: something about
the moral fiber of the nation in
the context of defending the na
tion itself, or vice-versa. I forget
exactly what.
He undoubtedly believes that
a draft is still the answer, or part
of it. I still believe that the draft
is not the answer to anything
good.
So, what? We had a discus
sion, mainly because he is such a
good listener.
Without necessarily disagree
ing or agreeing with him, 1 con
sider what he writes to be a
challenge. And I wish that more
of us in this forum did, too.
Most of the responses miss the
point. The main point.
Encore un petit effort.
Finally, his letters are never
boring.
