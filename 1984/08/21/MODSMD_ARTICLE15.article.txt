## Researchers transform Type A personalities 
### DAN CORAN 
Recently evidence was publicized indicating that the
Type-A personality — the ever-anxious over-achiever
— has a higher chance of suffering heart attacks than its
more easy-going counterpart, the Type-B personality.
But an even more recent study shows that Type-A per
sons can significantly reduce their chances of heart
trouble through group counseling.
The most recent results of a five-year study being
carried out by San Francisco physician Dr. Meyer
Friedman and Stanford Prof. Carl Thoresen of the
School of Education indicate that people with Type-A
personalities can significantly reduce their chances of
suffering a heart attack by modifying their behavior
characteristics through group counseling.
After three years of study, Friedman claims that
proof exists that behavioral changes through counseling
sessions can reduce or even cut in half the risk of heart
attack for T>pe-A individuals.
Having coined the terms Type-A and Type-B behav
ior in 1959, Friedman has been working with Thoresen
as co-investigator since the mid-1970s in trying to es
tablish whether altering Type-A behavioral character
istics had any effect on the chances for hav ing another
heart attack. Both researchers now claim that it does.
As Friedman points out, people who display Type-A
behavior are individuals who are struggling with life.
Under stressful circumstances they often become
angry, hostile, impatient, suspicious or hypercritical,
and their lives are dominated by an urgent, "Tve got to
do it fast" approach.
The main difference between a Type-A and a Type-
B personality, he says, is that "the Type-A person
usually has a lower self image of himself than the Type-
B individual. He is an insecure individual who tries to
prove himself in everything he does."
Professor Thoresen adds that Type-A individuals are
often likable personalities, though their excessiveness
and intensiveness are often troublesome to others.
"If they took off the rough, sharp, cutting edges, they
could increase their chances for close friendships, which
can be an excellent prophylactic for longer lives. It is
possible to be competitive and productive without
being excessive about it."
Among the behavioral characteristics ascribed to the
Type-A personality is the tendency to think of or do
more than one thing at once, schedule more and more
activities into less and less time, or hurry the speech of

others. Common to all Type-A personalities, Thoresen
notes, is the drive to improve oneself which can
produce a lifestyle that is excessive in its pace and with
out balance or harmony.
The aim of the five year study, Friedman says, is to
show that Type-A behavior can be modified and that
clinical treatment of Type-A behavior significantly
reduces the chance of repeated coronary instances. He
adds that though two previous studies heve been done
in this field, this is the first to assess the effectiveness of
counseling in helping the Type-A individual.
To effect a change, Thoresen says, "We first had to
help people begin to examine their lifestyle, which led
to thinking of ways to alter behavior and alter the envi
ronment."
We were not trying to change a person from Type-A
to Type-B. We were not trying to change a personality.
But we were trying to influence behavior and develop a
more trusting, more caring individual, with a less
hyper-competitive attitude toward life."
Though no evidence exists at present that Type-A
behavior is genetically inherited, many believe that it is
acquired early in life as the result of family pattern and
attitudes.
"For example, a child may bring home a report card
filled with A's and B's, and the parents may say, "Why
the B's?' The child then brings home a report card with
all A's, and the parents say, 'Why not A-plusses?' The
A-plus report card is brought home, and a parent may
say, 'That's good, but why didn't you win the first
prize?' " he said.
"There is an escalation of criteria, and no clear
message about what constitutes good performance.
These individuals are seldom made to feel they were
really good," he continued. "There is always an un
dertone of 'you could have done better.' This may lead
to insecurity."
As Friedman pointed out, a person with a Type-A
personality will never know he has an inclination
toward Type-A behavior unless challenged by the envi
ronment. Thoresen added that certain environments
can bring out Type-A behavior in what he calls the
"hooker" effect.
For example, an intense work situation where every
one is on the go can be the stimulus which will bring out
a person's Type-A characteristics. Once "hooked" on
this intense environment, the Type-A person can have
a profound effect on others, particularly spouses,

children and neighbors.
The "A1AI" behavioral characteristics — aggrava
tion, impatience, anger, irritation — are usually focused
on those closest to the Type-A individual.
"Some of the patients in our study had dismal mar
riages," said Thoresen, "They had not looked at what
impact they had on others. Theirs was an arrogant and
individualistic approach to life: totally independent
rather than interdependent."
The objectives of the program for these Type-A indi
viduals were !) to stay alive, 2) to reduce the severity
and intensity of the Type-A pattern, and 3) to increase
the quality and enjoyment of life.
In counseling groups, this was approached by doing
the little things which would help slow down one's daily
pace. Participants had to realize that faster or more in
tense work did not necessarily mean better work.
"They learned through examples of individuals
whose pace was less-frenzied that there was no reduc
tion in the quality of work they performed or the
amount they produced," said Thoresen. "In fact, when
people slow down they get more done. You can get
away with a fast frantic pace for awhile, but after a time
the quality of work diminishes. With a slower pace, the
quality of work is enhanced."
Friedman noted that the main goal was to reduce the
patients' expectations of themselves.
"This often takes a long time," he said. "A person's
achievement-to-expectations ratio must equal one or
greater for everything to be all right, especially for the
Type-A individual"
After three years of the study, the researchers are
pleased with the results.
"Among those who had Type-A counseling, the risk
of a new heart attack by the end of the third year of the
study was less than 2.5 percent annually, compared to
five percent of the other group," Thoresen said. "The
more they change, the more good they do for them
selves; the less they change, the more they hurt them
selves."
The study was funded in part by a $750,000 grant
from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and
partly by the National Institutes of Health. Additional
funds were received from several area corporations and
hospitals.
Programs to help Type-A persons alter their behav
ior will be set up in San Francisco in the near future.

a profound effect on others, particularly spouses,

children and neighbors.
The "A1AI" behavioral characteristics — aggrava
tion, impatience, anger, irritation — are usually focused
on those closest to the Type-A individual.
"Some of the patients in our study had dismal mar
riages," said Thoresen, "They had not looked at what
impact they had on others. Theirs was an arrogant and
individualistic approach to life: totally independent
rather than interdependent."
The objectives of the program for these Type-A indi
viduals were !) to stay alive, 2) to reduce the severity
and intensity of the Type-A pattern, and 3) to increase
the quality and enjoyment of life.
In counseling groups, this was approached by doing
the little things which would help slow down one's daily
pace. Participants had to realize that faster or more in
tense work did not necessarily mean better work.
"They learned through examples of individuals
whose pace was less-frenzied that there was no reduc
tion in the quality of work they performed or the
amount they produced," said Thoresen. "In fact, when
people slow down they get more done. You can get
away with a fast frantic pace for awhile, but after a time
the quality of work diminishes. With a slower pace, the
quality of work is enhanced."
Friedman noted that the main goal was to reduce the
patients' expectations of themselves.
"This often takes a long time," he said. "A person's
achievement-to-expectations ratio must equal one or
greater for everything to be all right, especially for the
Type-A individual"
After three years of the study, the researchers are
pleased with the results.
"Among those who had Type-A counseling, the risk
of a new heart attack by the end of the third year of the
study was less than 2.5 percent annually, compared to
five percent of the other group," Thoresen said. "The
more they change, the more good they do for them
selves; the less they change, the more they hurt them
selves."
The study was funded in part by a $750,000 grant
from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and
partly by the National Institutes of Health. Additional
funds were received from several area corporations and
hospitals.
Programs to help Type-A persons alter their behav
ior will be set up in San Francisco in the near future.
Recently evidence was publicized indicating that the
Type-A personality — the ever-anxious over-achiever
— has a higher chance of suffering heart attacks than its
more easy-going counterpart, the Type-B personality.
But an even more recent study shows that Type-A per
sons can significantly reduce their chances of heart
trouble through group counseling.
The most recent results of a five-year study being
carried out by San Francisco physician Dr. Meyer
Friedman and Stanford Prof. Carl Thoresen of the
School of Education indicate that people with Type-A
personalities can significantly reduce their chances of
suffering a heart attack by modifying their behavior
characteristics through group counseling.
After three years of study, Friedman claims that
proof exists that behavioral changes through counseling
sessions can reduce or even cut in half the risk of heart
attack for T>pe-A individuals.
Having coined the terms Type-A and Type-B behav
ior in 1959, Friedman has been working with Thoresen
as co-investigator since the mid-1970s in trying to es
tablish whether altering Type-A behavioral character
istics had any effect on the chances for hav ing another
heart attack. Both researchers now claim that it does.
As Friedman points out, people who display Type-A
behavior are individuals who are struggling with life.
Under stressful circumstances they often become
angry, hostile, impatient, suspicious or hypercritical,
and their lives are dominated by an urgent, "Tve got to
do it fast" approach.
The main difference between a Type-A and a Type-
B personality, he says, is that "the Type-A person
usually has a lower self image of himself than the Type-
B individual. He is an insecure individual who tries to
prove himself in everything he does."
Professor Thoresen adds that Type-A individuals are
often likable personalities, though their excessiveness
and intensiveness are often troublesome to others.
"If they took off the rough, sharp, cutting edges, they
could increase their chances for close friendships, which
can be an excellent prophylactic for longer lives. It is
possible to be competitive and productive without
being excessive about it."
Among the behavioral characteristics ascribed to the
Type-A personality is the tendency to think of or do
more than one thing at once, schedule more and more
activities into less and less time, or hurry the speech of

others. Common to all Type-A personalities, Thoresen
notes, is the drive to improve oneself which can
produce a lifestyle that is excessive in its pace and with
out balance or harmony.
The aim of the five year study, Friedman says, is to
show that Type-A behavior can be modified and that
clinical treatment of Type-A behavior significantly
reduces the chance of repeated coronary instances. He
adds that though two previous studies heve been done
in this field, this is the first to assess the effectiveness of
counseling in helping the Type-A individual.
To effect a change, Thoresen says, "We first had to
help people begin to examine their lifestyle, which led
to thinking of ways to alter behavior and alter the envi
ronment."
We were not trying to change a person from Type-A
to Type-B. We were not trying to change a personality.
But we were trying to influence behavior and develop a
more trusting, more caring individual, with a less
hyper-competitive attitude toward life."
Though no evidence exists at present that Type-A
behavior is genetically inherited, many believe that it is
acquired early in life as the result of family pattern and
attitudes.
"For example, a child may bring home a report card
filled with A's and B's, and the parents may say, "Why
the B's?' The child then brings home a report card with
all A's, and the parents say, 'Why not A-plusses?' The
A-plus report card is brought home, and a parent may
say, 'That's good, but why didn't you win the first
prize?' " he said.
"There is an escalation of criteria, and no clear
message about what constitutes good performance.
These individuals are seldom made to feel they were
really good," he continued. "There is always an un
dertone of 'you could have done better.' This may lead
to insecurity."
As Friedman pointed out, a person with a Type-A
personality will never know he has an inclination
toward Type-A behavior unless challenged by the envi
ronment. Thoresen added that certain environments
can bring out Type-A behavior in what he calls the
"hooker" effect.
For example, an intense work situation where every
one is on the go can be the stimulus which will bring out
a person's Type-A characteristics. Once "hooked" on
this intense environment, the Type-A person can have
a profound effect on others, particularly spouses,

children and neighbors.
