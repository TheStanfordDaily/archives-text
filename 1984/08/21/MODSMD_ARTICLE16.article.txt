# Patterns in the brain—music to mandalas
## 
### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
Roger Shepard, professor of pyschol
°gy here, produced a sheaf of drawings
delicately covered with tissue paper.
This is the first one," he said, lifting
off the tissue cover, "I saw this one about
seven years ago." It is a drawing of a del
icate, prismatic pattern Shepard said he
saw while in a hypnogagic state — the
state of altered consciousness between
sleeping and waking.
The drawing brings to mind geometric
patterns seen and reported by those on
hallucinogenic drugs, religious mandalas
and geometric weavings done by
primitive tribes. Looking at Shepard's
dream image, one gets the feeling that
there is some strange connection be
tween drugs, dreams and dharmas.
Shepard attributes this connection to
his theory of an "internal physics." It
stems from the necessity that humans —
or any animal — be able to mentally
rotate objects.
"If you think about it, nothing is in ex
actly the same position twice," Shepard
said. "It follows that the mind has to be
able to recognize objects in different
positions; it does this by mental rota
tion."
Shepard theorizes that it is this
capacity for rotation that makes the
brain supersensitive to regular patterns.
"You see, a pattern rotates onto it
self," Shepard said. "So it's logical to
assume that the brain is 'wired on' to
create these transformations, it would
fixate on a regular pattern."
He explained that during the hyp
nogagic state an infinite number of regu
lar and irregular patterns are likely to
flash through the mind, as the circuits of
the brain "fire on and off', — but it is
the occasional regular pattern that will
be noticed and remembered.
The anthropological offshoot of

Shepard's theory is that there is a con
nection between the geometric patterns
found in folklore and drug lore, and the
ones experienced just before awakening.
They all result from the brain's tendency
to recognize something that "maps onto
itself'.
Shepard's interest in the phenomena

A drawing of a delicate,
prismatic pattern he said
he saw while in the state
of altered consciousness
between sleeping and
waking.

of patterns began when he had his first
remembered hallucination. He described
it as follows:
"It first hit me early in the morning . . .
Suspended in the dreamy state between
waking and sleeping, and with my eyes
still closed, I experienced an ex
traodinarily vivid visual image. Extending
before me was an infinite array of
diamond-shaped amber regions, each
filled with a regular pattern of black,
spade-like forms ... a latticework of del
icately beveled edges, gleaming like
polished gold, framed like diamonds. The
whole array shimmered before in perfect
amber and gold splendor ..."
These patterns are not frequent;
Shepard said he had only several such
experiences over the years of his study.
In addition, he said that when he gives
talks on the subject of hypnagogic im
agery, only about ten percent of the
crowd reports experiencing patterns.
"Of course," said Shepard, "it's a mat
ter of remembering what you experience

. . . it's like remembering a dream; just
because you don't remember doesn't
mean you don't have them."
Shepard at one point questioned his
own ability to remember the patterns ac
curately. "I decided to give myself a
test," he said, "to decide whether I was
actually recording something that I saw. I
asked a graphic artist friend of mine to
draw up a pattern according to the ones I
had described, and then I had my wife
wake me up and show me the pattern for
four seconds just after I awakened."
The drawings Shepard made after
briefly seeing this pattern were almost
identical to the ones drawn by his artist
friend. "I realized then that I was ac
curately recording what I was seeing," he
said.
Shepard believes the brain reacts to
regular auditory patterns as well. "My
research in music and in visual
phenomena were originally two separate
interests/' Shephard said. "But then I
began to see connections between the
results I found."
To prove his point, he played a tape of
computer-generated music that seems to
continually rise in pitch but actually
never goes any higher. The effect is like
that of a barber pole, with its perpetually
rising yet stationary stripes. According to
Shapard, we are drawn into the illusion
because this too is a geometric pattern,
created by sound instead of line.
"The changes in pitch that occur are
definitely analogous to changes in
space," Shepard said.
The musical illusions Shepard has
created with this principle include an at
tempt to use the Stanford Chorus to
create the same cyclical pitch Shepard
created on the computer. According to
Shepard, that experiment "almost
worked — but when you're dealing with
the irregularities of the human voice,
things become complicated."

Another of Shephard's experiments in
musical perception included a trek to the
hills of Bali. In collaboration with a
former student, Christa Hansen in In
donesia, and a current student, Eddie
Kessler at Stanford, Shepard compared a
Balinese villager who had never heard
Western music to Stanford students who
had never heard Balinese music. Both
groups were played both Balinese music,
which is based on two tonal scales, and
Western music, which is based on a
diatonic scale.
"This experiment was unusual because
it probably can't ever be repeated,"
Shepard said. "These days it's next to
impossible to find a culture so remote it
hasn't been exposed to Western things.
We managed to find one. This village
was so remote, the villagers believed the
world consisted entirely of Bali and
neighboring Java. They couldn't believe
we weren't from Java."
Shepard found that although the
Balinese and Westerners reacted differ
ently to the different types of music,
there were some important similarities.
The Balinese were able to recognize
basic patterns in the Western music, in
stead of reacting as they would to gib
berish.
"They seemed to listen in a Western
way," Shepard said, adding that there
might indeed be a universal way of lis
tening to music, if not creating it.
The "overriding objective" of
Shepard's research is to attempt to create
a "mental mechanics", or a mechanical
pyschological model for the functions of
the human brain.
"I've come recently to believe that the
brain has internalized many of the laws
of nature — for example the principle of
rotation — and that in certain way, the
brain operates according to highly regu
lar laws," Shepard said. "I want to find
out what those laws are."
