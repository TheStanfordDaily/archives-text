# Development to open New York office this fall
## 
### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
Stanford University plans to open a develop
ment office in New York City in the near future,
said David Fulton, communications director at the
Development Office.
The New York office will replace one that
closed in 1980, when the staff of the orignal office
returned to the West Coast.
"My best recollection is that the head of the
East Coast office retired in 1980," Fulton said.
"We sent John Kates, a member of our develop
ment office here, to head a corporate develop
ment office in Greenwich, Connecticut."
Fulton explained that after Kates returned to
Stanford — he was recently named director of

Athletic Development — there was no develop
ment office in the East.
One factor in the decision to reopen the East
Coast Office was the success of the April 26-29
alumni conference in New York City. Called
"Life In The 21st Century ', the conference was
attended by about 2000 of the estimated 21,000
alumni. At the time of the conference, University
President Kennedy said that although there was
no direct connection between the conference and
the reopening of an East Coast office, "if there is
a very positive response to the conference we may
consider reopening the office."
Fulton said that while it would be incorrect that
there was a "cause and effect"
reaction to the conference, it
had been "one more piece of
positive evidence" of an active
alumni core in the East.
The New York office, said
Fulton, will be "primarily
developmental." It mostly will
encourage gifts from individ
uals, and will offer limited sup
port for corporate and founda
tion fund raising.
The office will have minimal
Alumni Association involve
ment, but most East Cost
alumni activity will continue to
be club oriented.
