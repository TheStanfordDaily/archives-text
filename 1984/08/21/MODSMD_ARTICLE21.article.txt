## Football practice in full swing as vets return 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Hail, hail, the gang's all here. The
freshmen arrived last week, the veterans
returned Saturday, they had their first
practices yesterday, and the Stanford
football team is ready to start the 1984
season.
"We've got a lot to do in a very little
time," Head Coach Jack Elway said.
"We've got a challenging schedule, but
I'm impressed with the reaction of our
football team to our system."
Challenging may be an understate
ment of the strength of the schedule. For
openers, the Cardinal travels to Norman
to face perennial Big Eight power Okla
homa. Tihe Card then gets to host defending
Big Ten champion Illinois. Stanford will
then meet San Jose State, Elway's old
team, in what looks like a breather.
Don't count on it. Stanford hasn't beaten
the Spartans since 1980.
That's just the independent slate.

Moving into Pacific 10 Conference play,
the Cardinal faces top-20 pick Arizona
State, UCLA — a team some pick as No.
1 — and Washington, another top-20
candidate. Washington State, USC and
Arizona should all contend for the title,

and all are on the Cardinal's schedule.
Oregon State and UC-Berkeley look to
be the "easy" games, but both beat Stan
ford last year.
It's no wonder, then, that manv foot

ball forecasts are picking Stanford to
finish near the bottom of the Pac-10.
Elway knows this. "Yeah, we read
them," he said. "I guess that's for them
to predict and for us to prove them
wrong."

The Card is off to a good start for that.
Testing was done Sunday, and Elway
said, "They did well in the tests. They're
in good physical condition, better than in
the spring." The players were on a

workout program over the summer.
Although the veterans had a month of
practice in the spring to start learning the
system, Elway said there was still a long
way to go. "We just put in the basics in
the spring," he said. "We'll review what
we did in the spring, and then we'll start
to put in the rest of it — the misdirection
and the reverses and things like that."
They've only got two weeks of double
sessions to do it in. Currently working
out just in shorts, the Card will put on
the pads for the first time Thursday.
Two-a-days end a week from Friday, and
then comes game week.
Practices are at 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. and
last about two hours. Elway said that the
morning practice is devoted to the run
ning game, while the afternoon workout
concentrates on passing along with some
special teams work.
The team practices on the athletic
fields next to DeGuerre Pool and Maples
Pavilion, across from Sunken Diamond.
