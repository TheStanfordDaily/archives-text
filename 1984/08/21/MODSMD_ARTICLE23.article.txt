## Psychedelic Furs remain pretty much the same 
### JULIE RYAN 
People have been talking
about how the Psychedelic Furs
have changed lately. They have ,
but fundamentally they can't
change that much, and their
recent show in Berkeley was not
vastly different from their show
of two years ago. The group is
almost all style, and most of that
style comes from lead singer and
lyricist, Richard Butler. With his
low voice that most would admit

is not very good and eerie stage
presence, the band does not
have the widest range of possi
bilities.
None of this is necessarily
meant as criticism because the
Furs' style remains interesting.
The crowd last Friday showed
that they're still interested. But
though the band is becoming a
bit more well-known, the music
will probably never have the
wide pop appeal of other bands.
Their sound takes a bit too

much getting used to. To rela
tive newcomers, for example,
the similar rhythm of many of
the songs might make them
seem monotonous. A friend ot
mine at the concert made this
complaint and admittedly it
takes some familiarity to enjoy
large doses of the Psychedelic
Furs.
Though many people were
surely disappointed that ÃœB4O
did not play also. Sparks did an
admirable job opening the
show. They got the crowd dan

made to get people on their feet.
The combination of the two
brothers shows a lot of person
ality; one looking like he came
out of the "Revenge of the
Nerds" and the other in a wild,
sequined outfit. Their very pop
music complemented well the
Furs' harder fare.
The Sparks said they were
going to play mostly old
favorites, which makes one
wonder if they have any new
favorites. "Cool Places" seemed
to be the big hit in the 40 minute
set.
The Furs opened with the
danceable, "Love my Way"
from their 1982 album Forever
Now. In this song Butler says,"l
follow where my mind goes."
Throughout the concert one
wonders exactly where Butler's
mind does roam. He moves with
exaggerated steps across the
stage or sways to the music,
sometimes reaching out toward
the crowd and other times
gliding around the stage as if he
hardly realized there was an au
dience. Butler looked pale and
drawn , a bit like David Bowie
on the Live album. He was
