## Psychedelic Furs remain pretty much the same 
### JULIE RYAN 
People have been talking
about how the Psychedelic Furs
have changed lately. They have ,
but fundamentally they can't
change that much, and their
recent show in Berkeley was not
vastly different from their show
of two years ago. The group is
almost all style, and most of that
style comes from lead singer and
lyricist, Richard Butler. With his
low voice that most would admit

is not very good and eerie stage
presence, the band does not
have the widest range of possi
bilities.
None of this is necessarily
meant as criticism because the
Furs' style remains interesting.
The crowd last Friday showed
that they're still interested. But
though the band is becoming a
bit more well-known, the music
will probably never have the
wide pop appeal of other bands.
Their sound takes a bit too

much getting used to. To rela
tive newcomers, for example,
the similar rhythm of many of
the songs might make them
seem monotonous. A friend ot
mine at the concert made this
complaint and admittedly it
takes some familiarity to enjoy
large doses of the Psychedelic
Furs.
Though many people were
surely disappointed that ÜB4O
did not play also. Sparks did an
admirable job opening the
show. They got the crowd dan
cing to their music, which is
made to get people on their feet.
The combination of the two
brothers shows a lot of person
ality; one looking like he came
out of the "Revenge of the
Nerds" and the other in a wild,
sequined outfit. Their very pop
music complemented well the
Furs' harder fare.
The Sparks said they were
going to play mostly old
favorites, which makes one
wonder if they have any new
favorites. "Cool Places" seemed
to be the big hit in the 40 minute
set.
The Furs opened with the
danceable, "Love my Way"
from their 1982 album Forever
Now. In this song Butler says,"l
follow where my mind goes."
Throughout the concert one
wonders exactly where Butler's
mind does roam. He moves with
exaggerated steps across the
stage or sways to the music,
sometimes reaching out toward
the crowd and other times
gliding around the stage as if he
hardly realized there was an au
dience. Butler looked pale and
drawn , a bit like David Bowie
on the Live album. He was

wearing what some people said
looked like an expensive
bathrobe.
The Greek Theater is a beau
tiful place to see a concert. Yet
somehow a smoke-filled dark
night club better fits the band's
style. Butler did not get as close
to the crowd as he can at a small
hall and though the audience
stood its feet and danced (or
perhaps I should say swayed)
throughout the show, I've seen
it more involved. Many times
Butler reaches out to touch the
crowd but at the Greek Theater
this is impossible.
The show was a good balance
between old and new material.
The old angrier and less
polished songs were done with
sincere feeling. The punk
oriented "President Gas," for
example, was a very appropriate
prelude to the Republican con
vention, especially the line, "It's
a real cowboy set." "Sleep
Comes Down" was also well
done.
The newer songs came with
out much fanfare in the middle
of the show. The surprisingly
pretty love song, "The Ghost in
You" got the crowd cheering
and certainly had fewer angry or
lustful lyrics than former songs
like, "Into You Like a Train." It
is more straightforward and per

haps more in line with music
standards in the '80s. There is
less in these songs to keep one
listening again and again, but
they are appealing at first.
The tenor saxophone player
stood out on a great version of
"Heaven," changing the pace of
the show to some extent. Many
songs were dominated by
guitars and drums. Actually the
long-time members of the band
at the tour were guitarist John
Ashton, guitarist Tim Butler,
and Richard Butler. The other
musicians joined the band for
the tour.
It is Ashton's strong guitar
that often seems to drive the
group ahead and keep it on
track. The band rides on the
edge of what sometimes seems
like total disorganization but
somehow manages to pull it off.
If you go to the show hoping to
understand all the words to the
songs, you may be disappointed.
Butler is not famed for his enun
ciation and the sound system at
Berkeley — far from perfect —
was making it even harder.
The encores were "Imitation
of Christ," "Into You Like a
Train" and, of course, "India."
These are all older, well-estab
lished songs that offered no real
surprises but which couldn't be
left out.

night club better fits the band's
style. Butler did not get as close
to the crowd as he can at a small
hall and though the audience
stood its feet and danced (or
perhaps I should say swayed)
throughout the show, I've seen
it more involved. Many times
Butler reaches out to touch the
crowd but at the Greek Theater
this is impossible.
The show was a good balance
between old and new material.
The old angrier and less
polished songs were done with
sincere feeling. The punk
oriented "President Gas," for
example, was a very appropriate
prelude to the Republican con
vention, especially the line, "It's
a real cowboy set." "Sleep
Comes Down" was also well
done.
The newer songs came with
out much fanfare in the middle
of the show. The surprisingly
pretty love song, "The Ghost in
You" got the crowd cheering
and certainly had fewer angry or
lustful lyrics than former songs
like, "Into You Like a Train." It
is more straightforward and per

haps more in line with music
standards in the '80s. There is
less in these songs to keep one
listening again and again, but
they are appealing at first.
The tenor saxophone player
stood out on a great version of
"Heaven," changing the pace of
the show to some extent. Many
songs were dominated by
guitars and drums. Actually the
long-time members of the band
at the tour were guitarist John
Ashton, guitarist Tim Butler,
and Richard Butler. The other
musicians joined the band for
the tour.
It is Ashton's strong guitar
that often seems to drive the
group ahead and keep it on
track. The band rides on the
edge of what sometimes seems
like total disorganization but
somehow manages to pull it off.
If you go to the show hoping to
understand all the words to the
songs, you may be disappointed.
Butler is not famed for his enun
ciation and the sound system at
Berkeley — far from perfect —
was making it even harder.
The encores were "Imitation
of Christ," "Into You Like a
Train" and, of course, "India."
These are all older, well-estab
lished songs that offered no real
surprises but which couldn't be
left out.
