## Difford and Tilbrook—hope falls apart 
### JIM LYNCH 
Chris Difford and Glenn
Tilbrook, the leaders of
Squeeze, were having a great
year in 1982. They followed
"Tempted," their first hit single,
with Sweets From A Stranger, a
well-received new album, and
"Black Coffee In Bed," another
hit single. They were accepted
by the MTV generation, and
were playing concerts before
sellout crowds brought in by the
new video channel.
Then they broke the band up.
"The ship has run its course,"
was Difford's cryptic statement.
"And it's time to move on." The
other band members, Gilson
Lavis, Don Snow, and John
Bentley, weren't too happy with
the sudden loss of income, but
hey, eccentric singer
songwriters are allowed to do
seemingly inhuman things to
their bandmembers. Who did
they think they were, The
Beatles?
Tilbrook and Difford have

received some pretty hot
reviews in their day, with some
daring to compare their finely
honed pop vignettes to those of
Lennon and McCartney. Maybe
this wouldn't have gone to their
heads if A&M Records, in their
infinite wisdom, had not chosen
to print some of the more ex
plicit "These guys are as good as
the Beatles" quotes right on the
cover of Sweets From A
Stranger. Delusions of grandeur
struck the boys, and they were
soon penning shows for the
London stage, and planning
their Broadway debut when
they decided to make a record.
Difford and Tilbrook have
written some great songs, to be
sure; they've made some great
albums, and next to the dß's
Difford Stamey and Peter Hol
sapple, probably have come
closest to that magical Beatle
spirit in some of their songs.
Sadly, though, for their inflated
egos, 1 think that history will re
member them more for

Argybargy, the classic Squeeze
album, than for Difford &
Tilbrook, their first post-
Squeeze release on loyal A&M
Records. The new record is a
logical development of the soul
influences reflected in their two
hits, a sometimes uneasy mel
ding of Difford's studied,
fleshed-out lyrics, Tilbrook's
traditional British Pop melodies
and the soul-funk beat of
"Black Coffee In Bed."
Like Joe Jackson, Tilbrook
and Difford want to get to the
roots of the music they play, and
they recognize that those roots
are black. Unlike Jackson,
though, Difford and Tilbrook
have tried to make an album
without first assembling a band
to play on it. Larry Tollfree, the
hired percussionist for these ses
sions, was in the band Jackson
used to make his very successful
jump from punky pop to soulful
pop. In that band, he was the
conventional trap drummer, and
Jackson used an experienced

New York percussionist to lay
out his percolating Afro-latin
rhythms. On Difford &
Tilbrook, he's the percussionist,
not funky at all, and buried
beneath that big, big drum
sound that Tony Visconti must
have listened to four or five U2
or Phil Collins records to get.
Loud drums do not make dance
songs.
Maybe they just don't notice
it, but there's been a gradual
decline in the quality of the
keyboard players they've
employed since Jools Holland
left. Paul Carrack was a fine
vocalist, but almost without per
sonality as a keyboardist. I don't
think I would have noticed Don
Snow onstage with Squeeze at
their final show if someone sit
ting with me hadn't mistaken
him for David Bowie.
Things are much worse now.
Tilbrook and someone named
Guy Fletcher are responsible for
the leaden keyboard work on
this album, and probably

deserve to have their fingers
taped together until they show
some evidence of struggle. On
song after song, there's always
one synth or sequenced organ
sound just where I don't want to
hear it. Technology hath
wrought some bad habits on
Tilbrook's ability to arrange his
songs. "The Apple Tree," Dif
ford's gloomy after-the
holocaust vision, is slowed down
down to a crawl, presumably to
get some sort of message across,
but he's effectively granted
producer Tony Visconti full
licence to pretend he's still at
the helm of David Bowie's
records. The result is mud.
Whatever happened to Dif
ford Difford's voice? That ugly,
yet appealing baritone, the
voice of "Cool For Cats" and so
many other Squeeze songs, is all
but forgotten on this album. If
you listen really closely to
"Love's Crashing Waves," one
of the better songs on the al
bum, you can hear it, doubled
