# Difford & Tilbrook

by a "safer" harmony a fourth
higher. He's become a,casualty
of success, victimized by his own
efforts to make an appealing,
"soulish" album. If they'd only
listened to the Temptations...
Wait. Stop. I don't hate this
record, I'm just disappointed. I
have to be responsible and tell
the world what's good about the
record. Here I go.
Difford & Tilbrook contains

some first-rate songwriting,
reaffirming previous hunches
that these guys are far ahead of
the field both musically and lyri
cally. Difford has become a
master of poeticizing British
life, and he still writes great
choruses. "A Man For All
Seasons" shows the eerily sym
biotic relationship Difford and
Tilbrook have most clea.ly. As
the "man" in the song is feeling

some rough weather:
Now she's working at an office
I don't have a job at all
She keeps me in cigarettes
Once a batter, now a ball.
Tilbrook is building false
bridges that don't lead to
choruses, and kicking into
choruses ending with bridges
into verses. High-handed-stuff,

this, but Tilbrook and Difford
know what they're doing. The
spectre, their fascination with
the legacy of the Beatles is a
valuable tool for them to fall
back on. That backwards guitar
at the end of "Love's Crashing
Waves" was learned right from
the masters themselves.
They can write funk tunes, or
adapt their songs to funk riffs,
whichever you prefer, and they
prove it on "Action Speaks
Faster." Possibly the only song
on the album I'd venture to call
"well-arranged," (if 1 don't lis
ten to the horn parts; the TKO
horns should only be directed by

Song after song, there's always one synth or
sequenced organ sound just where I don't
want to hear it. Technology hath wrought
some bad habits on Tilbrook's ability to
arrange his songs.

Stevie Nieve or lan Dury) the
track features some great
Bernie Worrell/Stevie Wonder
synth parts that would probably
cook if Stevie or Bernie played
them.
"Love's Crashing Waves,"
I've heard, is about to come out
as a hot twelve-inch mixed by
someone who knows more
about dancing than Tony Vis
conti. I can't wait. If I could just
take those strings and make
scratch tracks with them...Nah,
they'll probably get Arthur
Baker or Kerkovian to do it.
A&M did a really good job on
the cassette version of the al
bum, mastering it to Dolby B on
BASF chrome tape. It sounds
almost as good as a tape made at
home.
All right, I'll be serious again.
What we have here is a very
talented songwriting team, so
talented they can write songs in
almost uny medium, from
country ("Labelled With Love,"
from East Side Story) to funk.
They still do their best work
within their most comfortable
medium, the pop format they
explored with Squeeze.

What prevents this from
being a good album, or even a
listenable album, can be traced
back to Tony Visconti. Visconti
learned his trade in the late
seventies, and engineered those
pivotal David Bowie albums
produced by Brian Eno. Eno
succeeded on thickly-arranged
songs like "Heroes" by using
the technology available to him
(it's almost stone-age now) to
breathe into the songs, and al
low a space for the listener's
ears. Visconti didn't pick up on
that lesson, and polished this
record to a shine that won't
crack. Difford and Tilbrook are

better songwriters than Howard
Jones because they understand
the musical value of human
rhythms as opposed to machine
generated ones, but Visconti,
Guy Fletcher and maybe
Tilbrook himself seem bent on
lowering the record to the level
of Howard Jones by using al
most as many stolid, sequenced
synthesizers.
I saw Glenn Tilbrook on the
I.R.S. Records MTV show. The
Cutting Edge, about a month
ago. After a ridiculous interview
with Dick Cavett, who was sing
ing (!) on a Carly Simon song
penned for the Democratic
Convention, the show just
broke to Tilbrook, uncombed
shoulder-length hair blown by
some off-camera fan, playing
"Man For All Seasons" acousti
cally. He's one of those singers
who never opens his eyes when
he's singing. That performance
was better than anything 1 have
seen or heard him do with
Squeeze, and blew the album
version of the song into the Per
sian Gulf. If he'd only opened
his eyes; he would have seen his
record. . .
