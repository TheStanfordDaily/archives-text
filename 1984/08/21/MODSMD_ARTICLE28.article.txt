Las Vegas, Nevada — Backing off from earlier
strike threats, members of two unions representing a
half million postal workers voted yesterday to sub
mit their contract dispute with the U.S. Postal Ser
vice to binding arbitration.
The union members, who have been working
without a contract since July 21, rejected what
would have been an illegal strike action in voice
votes at separate conventions in Las Vegas. Vincent
Somhrotto, president of the 22(),0()()-member Na
tional Association of Letter Carriers, said his group
was willing to take chances with arbitration. A sister
union, the American Postal Workers Union
(APWU), also voted to allow its executive board to
enter the arbitration process with the Postal Service.
I he APWU represents some 300,000 postal
workers.
The two unions had threatened to call a walkout
after the Postal Service moved earlier this month to
implement its major contract demand — a two-tiered
wage system — following the collapse of negotia
tions.
