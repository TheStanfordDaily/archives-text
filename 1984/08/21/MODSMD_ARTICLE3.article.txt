# Macrush subsides during summer
## 
### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
The "tremendous back
log" of Macintosh computer
orders has finally been filled,
and faculty, staff and stu
dents who wish to order
computers should do so now
to avoid the fall rush, said
Judy Windt of Microdisc.
Because Microdisc — the
University program respon
sible for selling discount
computers and related
equipment to faculty and stu
dents — expects a rush of or
ders when students return in
the fall, Windt said that stu
dents interested in purchas

ing a Macintosh should order
one before Sept. 4, when
their summer registration
status expires. Faculty and

Microdisc
Pro B ram

staff have until Sept. 24.
"Anyone ordering [a]
computer now should have
[it] well before the end of the
year," Windt said. The
longest anyone has had to
wait for a computer has been
six months, but that period has
been brought down signifi
cantly, Windt said.
Initially, the University held a
lottery on April 13 to determine
who would be first to purchase
the reduced-price computer.
Because of the overwhelming
popularity of the Macintosh,
Stanford received only a few
hundred computers at the outset
of the program. The demand
created by the lottery-supply
system resulted in the 'black

market* sale of lottery bids that
promised quick delivery dates to
eager buyers.
Now, the supply of computers
has increased and the demand
has decreased. "Most of the or
ders were placed in the begin
ning of the program," Windt
said.
Sara Williamson, another
representative of Microdisc,
said that 2150 computers have
been sold to faculty and stu
dents thus far. In the future
Microdisc hopes to offer dis
counted IBM and DEC com
puters in addition to the Macin
tosh and the Hewlett-Packard
models it now offers.
