# Republican skit portrays Reagan as sexist bumbler
## 
### 
Los Angeles — President Reagan is portrayed as a
bumbling sexist, more concerned about a Santa Bar
bara vacation than nuclear war, in a "respectful"'
play by a Republican group opposed to its party's
conservative platform.
A troupe of Hollywood actors will perform "A
Day in the Life of the President" today at a Dallas
theater near the site of the Republican National
Convention.
The anti-nuclear play is sponsored by the Repub
lican Mainstream Committee which objects to what
it calls the regressive, rigid and right-wing platform
being recommended for adoption by the convention.
The play depicts a cheery, nonchalant Reagan —
played by Richard Masur — who is incompetent in
foreign affairs, condescending to women and depen
dent on aides to refresh his memory on nearly every
thing.
Reagan is seen bungling a purported summit
meeting with the Soviet premier, in which he depicts
the two nations nuclear arsenals with two jars of
jelly beans, then eats some of his and insists he be
allowed to keep "the chocolatey" ones representing
MX missiles.
