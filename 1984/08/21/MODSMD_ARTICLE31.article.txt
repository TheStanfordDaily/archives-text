# Mine search continues

Cairo, Egypt â€” The Western effort to identify the
source of the explosions damaging ships in the Red
Sea continued yesterday while two Soviet mine
sweepers headed south in the waterway, apparently
toward pro-Soviet South Yemen.
At least 18 ships have been damaged by mines in
the Red Sea and the Gulf of Suez, the northwestern

branch of the sea, since July 9, and American,
British and French mine hunting units have
responded to Egypt's request to help search for the
explosives.
U.S. Navy officers on board the USS Shreveport,
the base of four American minesweeping helicopters
searching the Gulf of Suez, said Sunday the
oceanographic ship Harkness had made 12
"contacts" with mine-like objects, but most were
found to be trash or coral when checked by frogmen.
They said some of the objects simply "drifted
away."
U.S. Navy Commodore Alvin Newman, who
commands the 650 crewmen and U.S. ships and
helicopters, said it may be impossible to lay the
blame for the mining, even if a mine was found and
identified.
