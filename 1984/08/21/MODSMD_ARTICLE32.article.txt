# Salvadoran guerrillas step up security patrols

### 
San Salvador, El Salvador â€” Leftist Salvadoran
guerrillas have stepped up patrols in the past two
weeks throughout territory that they control, and
Salvadoran army officers and U.S. diplomats say
that the activity appears to signal a rebel autumn of
fensive that could begin within a month.
The rebels launched a major offensive in early
September last year, taking advantage of the start of
the dry season when movement is easier in the hills
and mountains. But several officials said that the
guerrillas appeared weaker at present than a year
ago, and one source with access to military reports
said that the Reagan administration apparently had
exa ggerated predictions of an impending, dramatic
guerrilla offensive to help pry military aid from
Congress for the Salvadoran government.
Lt. Col. Domingo Monterrosa, Salvadoran army
commander in the nation's three eastern provinces,
in part attributed the guerrilla's limited ability to
stage coordinated attacks to a beefed-up army pres
ence around guerrilla strongholds in the northeast
ern part of the country.
