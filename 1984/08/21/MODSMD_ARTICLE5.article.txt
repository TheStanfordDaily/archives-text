# Cookie Habit fights crunch
## 
### ELAINE WANG Daily staff 
Stanford goes to court today asking for a pre
liminary injunction to stop John Niven from
bringing Mrs. Fields cookies and Cone-a-Copia
ice cream into Niven's International Foods at the
Stanford Shopping Center. Meanwhile, one of the
two cookie shops already at the center — Cookie
Habit — has launched its own complaint against
the supermarket.
Owners (and sisters) Marlowe Savelle and Mar
cia Hadeler claim that all the stores at the shop
ping center are "part of a merchant's association,
like a big family."
"Most of the merchants are willing to work to
gether to promote sales and general good will.
John Niven is breaking this code," said Savelle.
"He's gotten a lot of sympathy, but there's an
other side."
"He's constantly saying, 'I'm the little guy
against Stanford.' But what about us?" she added,
"Compared to him, we're minute."
Niven said, "I'm not aware of any 'code.' Most
of these people are at each other's throats . . .

they're competitors." He contends that it's a free
enterprise issue.
"I've been getting handfuls of calls from other
tenants — some whom I compete almost directly
with — who wish me luck,"' he added. "They say
to me, 'We can't stand up to Stanford, but you
can/ "
One of Stanford's reasons for opposing Niven's
subleasing to Mrs. Fields and Cone-a-Copia is
"that it would hurt other stores," said John
Schwartz, Stanford's general counsel. "We've
concluded that what Niven plans to do now could
have a serious impact," he said.
"When Niven first leased space, he was given a
favorable rent because supermarkets don't have a
high profit margin," explained Schwartz. "But
years later he turns around and leases at high ren
tals to other products.
"Maintaining the shopping center is crucial to
the academic and educational enterprise,"
Schwartz continued. The shopping center
represents "direct, unrestricted funds . . . for im
provements in education. It is not insignificant or
trivial to the University's operating budget,"he
said.
This sum equals about five percent of tuition
income, and more than two times the money
which Stanford budgeted for education improve
ments this past year, Schwartz said. Niven's ac
tion, he said, could prevent the "endowment
[from] earning its proper return."
Cookie Habit opened in May, 1979, and is the
"only source of income and livelihood" for its
owners, said Savelle. Both women assert that
competition from Mrs. Fields cookies would be
"detrimental" to their business. "I'd put my
cookie up to hers anyday," said Savelle, "but I
can't put my name up to hers."
The sisters stress that a "large chain with
money, name and volume like Mrs. Fields can af
ford to undercut us for as long as it takes."
"Then, when there is no competition left, the
chain can raise its prices, even higher than the
original prices of the competing stores," said
Savelle. This, they claim, is the biggest threat of
Niven's action.
Another is that if Niven wins, "the sky's the
limit," said Savelle. "He could start putting T
shirts in his store ... it could threaten other
stores."
Hadeler refutes Niven's complaints about the
parking lot near the supermarket being closed —
then later not closed — for construction. "Our
parking lot was closed, too, and we had busses
parked right in front, sometimes for lunch hours,"
she said.

"We've all suffered," added Savelle, "but this is
progress. They've (Stanford) gone through the ex
pense to close off half of the parking lot at a
time," to make sure no merchant gets the brunt of
parking construction.
David's Cookies, part of a large chain based in
New York, is the other cookie merchant at the
center. "They have a different type of cookie,"
said Hadeler. "It's made with a special swiss
[chocolate] and is considered more like candy."

They don't consider David's Cookies upsetting
to the "balanced goods and balanced competi
tion" concept of the shopping center, said Savelle,
because it is a different type of cookie — "not like
mom used to make . . . not like Mrs. Fields."
Deirdre O'Connell, director of operations for
David's Cookies, said the store would "basically
welcome any and all competition, but would
prefer that Mrs. Fields take a mall position like
everyone else."
"Niven's taking a sort of back-door approach is
unfair," she said. "It might hurt, but our product
is different. "
