# Ailing Cessna crash-lands into dry Lake Lagunita

Lagunita in the summertime
tends to look a little like the
surface of the moon anyway.
But visitors to the dried-up lake
last Saturday probably did a
doubletake when they saw a
lunar-looking piece of machin
ery lying on the lake's bottom.
It wasn't Skylab. It was a Ces
sna.
According to Dick Garcia,
part-owner of the airplane, Earl
Bergen, a friend of his who was
flying the Cessna, crash-landed
in Lake Lagunita about 5 p.m.
Saturday. "A friend and I were
waiting for the plane to come
back to the airport so we could
take it out for a run,"he said.
"When it didn't come back, we
went out looking for it."
They found it in Lake
Lagunita, belly-up and
"totalled," according to Garcia.

"He [Bergen] started having
engine trouble over the moun
tains and realized he'd have to
land somewhere. You have to
look for an open space to land
in, so he tried to land here,"
Garcia said.
Bergen managed to walk*
away from the wreck, but he
was taken to Valley View hospi
tal and treated for minor injur
ies. The plane, however, was not
so lucky.
"I'm sure it's ruined." Garcia
said. "And what's worse, he
didn't have to come down that
way."
He explained that from the
look of the crash site, Bergen
made an almost-successful land
ing, but then tipped the nose of
the plane too close to the
ground.
"It's just a matter of knowing

the emergency landing proce
dure and a matter of experi
ence," said Garcia. He added
that he had successfully landed
the Cessna in a similar situation.
Although a bit shaken by the
loss of his plane (he explained
that it was insured but had a
"heavy deductible") Garcia
spent a night-long vigil at the
accident site to ensure that no
one tampered with the Cessna.
He said there was enough gas in
the engine to explode the plane
if anyone "got in there and
shook the thing hard enough."
The plane was disassembled
and moved Sunday morning.
