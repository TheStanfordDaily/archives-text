## Reagan solicits votes in Midwest 
### 
Decatur, Illinois (AP) —
President Reagan, cam
paigning in America's
heartland as the Republican
convention convened, said
yesterday that Walter
Mondale peddles "falsehood
and fiction" when he says
GOP economic policies cater
only to the rich.
The president also urged
Mondale to "renounce im
mediately" his support for
legislation that would force
car manufacturers to use
U.S. parts and labor in con
structing automobiles.
"A true friend of farmers
would renounce immediately
his or her support for such
misguided legislation. Our
administration is determined
to create jobs the right way,
with economic growth and
technological innovation,"
he said in remarks prepared
for delivery at Millikin Uni
versity.
Earlier yesterday, in
speeches here and in Cincin
nati, Reagan took credit for
lowering inflation and
launching the economic
recovery.
Speaking at an airport
rally here, he said his policies
have "ignited, for the first
time in decades, high growth
with low inflation. This is
creating so many jobs that
our European allies are call
ing it the American miracle
— 6.5 million new jobs just

since the recovery began."
Before Reagan could
finish speaking, several
hundred of the thousands of
people at the rally began
walking out. Some said they
had just come to get a
glimpse of the president.
In Cincinnati, Reagan ad
dressed the so-called
"fairness issue" head-on, in
sisting that the 25 percent tax
rate reduction he pushed
through Congress helped
everyone.
Referring to Mondale's as
sertion that whoever is
elected will have to raise
taxes to cope with a federal
deficit estimated this year at
more than $174 billion,
Reagan said:
"Well, the only thing that's
limited is their optimism and
imagination. Calling for a tax
increase was their typical
knee-jerk reaction. And
believe me, when their knee
jerks, you get kicked."
Referring to John Glenn,
who challenged Mondale for
the Democratic presidential
nomination, Reagan said, "I
think the senator with the
right stuff was right when he
criticized the candidate with
the left stuff."
Glenn called the presi
dent's ploy a "political
charade" and said many of
the differences he had with
Mondale during the primary
campaign no longer exist.
