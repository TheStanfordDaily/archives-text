# Rhetoric marks GOP convention's first day
## 
### 
Dallas (AP) — Republicans opened their 33rd
national convention yesterday with a denuncia
tion of the Democrats and a ringing endorsement
of "the Reagan record of peace, prosperity and
pride in America." The president campaigned at a
distance, boasting of an "American miracle of
economic recovery.
Sen. Howard Baker made Reagan's case trom
the convention podium, detailing the recent eco
nomic boom and gloating, "Walter Mondale can t
stand it."
The GOP assembled in an overheated conven
tion city in a mood of uncommon optimism —
with Reagan and Vice President George Bush
well ahead in public opinion polls and a new
report showing the U.S. economy expanding at
the healthy rate of 7.6 percent. On top of that,
Mondale has been hampered by the questions
concerning his running mate's family finances.
"I hope this woman survives," Sen. Paul Laxalt
said as Geraldine Ferraro released her financial
statements — but it was clear that Republican
delegates were enjoying the Democratic discom
fort.
"Let the Democrats run their campaign on
rhetoric," U.S. Treasurer Katherine Ortega said
in the keynote oration delivered before 2235
confident delegates but aimed at independents
and wavering Democrats watching on television.
"We Republicans will run ours on the Reagan
record of peace, prosperity and pride in
America."
The only sour note on day one of the Republi
can convention came, as expected, from party
moderates unhappy with the conservative plat
form, cleared for approval tonight. "I don't think
it's worth the paper it's written on," said Rep. Sil
vio Conte of Massachusetts.
From Reagan on down came a merciless attack
on Mondale. The president sought votes in Illinois
and Ohio, ridiculing Mondale's "knee-jerk"
desire to raise taxes.
Ortega, a Hispanic woman given the spotlight
by a party seeking to broaden its appeal, assailed

an "indecisive, inexperienced" Mondale, and said
that in four years, Reagan "has restored
America's faith in itself.
"We have come a long way in four years, from
the shame of Tehran to the brave rescue of Amer
ican students in Grenada," she said.
She quoted Sen. Gary Hart, Mondale's Demo
cratic primary rival, who called the Democratic
candidate's program "a collection of old and tired
ideas, held together by paralyzing commitments
to special interests and constituence groups."
As for Mondale's plan for higher taxes to cut
the deficit, she said, "There he goes again" — an
echo, and not the first this year — of Reagan's ef
fective retort to Carter during their 1980 cam
paign debate.
"Fifty million people said 'no' to Walter
Mondale four years ago, and they can't wait to say
'no' again to him in 1984," retiring Senate
majority leader Baker said in a speech prepared
for the delegates.
He said millions of jobs have been created, in
terest rates have fallen, the crime rate is down and
"people can ... take vacations again" because of
Reagan's policies — "and Walter Mondale can't
stand it."
Nowhere in the long, hot day and night of rhet
oric was there a mention of the record federal
deficits piled up in Reagan's term.
"We're going to campaign on the strongest eco
nomy in three decades and seven presidents,"
party chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. told
delegates as he opened the convention. "We will
leave here to re-elect Ronald Reagan."
In remarks prepared for delivery in Decatur,
111., Reagan said, "We are not tied to the failed
policies of the past, policies that relied on more
taxing, more spending and more government."
He said his policies have "ignited, for the first
time in decades, high growth with low inflation.
This is creating so many jobs that our European
allies are calling it the American miracle — 6.5
million new jobs just since the recovery began."
