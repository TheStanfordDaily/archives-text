# Ferraro and Zaccaro pay about 40 percent in taxes
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Seeking to dispel a cloud
of questions shadowing her vice-presidential cam
paign, Geraldine Ferraro and her husband
revealed yesterday that they pay about 40 percent
of their income in taxes and sent the government a
$53,459 check to cover an error they made on
their federal taxes in 1978.
The New York congresswoman also revealed
that she and her husband could have a combined
net worth of more than $1.4 million.
The disclosures at a Washington hotel several
doors from the headquarters of the Democratic
presidential campaign came after a week of in
creasing questions and pressure over Ferraro's
family finances.
The first disclosures, delayed three hours by the
burden of copying an inch and a half of documents
for more than 150 reporters, covered the couple's
tax returns and went beyond any requirements for
disclosure in federal law.
They included the separate tax returns that Fer
raro has filed since she became a member of
Congress in 1979; the separate returns filed by
her husband, New York real-estate dealer John
Zaccaro, since that period; and the joint federal
income tax return they filed in 1978.
The documents showed that the couple had
combined income from 1979 to 1983 of
$866,443. Last year, Ferraro earned $70,358 and
Zaccaro's gross income was $203,039.
Francis O'Brien, a Mondale-Ferraro press
spokesman, said of Zaccaro's disclosure, "No
spouse (of a national candidate) has ever dis
closed that type of information before."
Jim Johnson, Walter Mondale's campaign
director, said of the couple's disclosures: "They
have withstood the test of public trust and public
integrity."
Later in the day, Ferraro filed financial dis
closure forms with the Federal Election Commis
sion (FEC), just 11 minutes before the deadline.
The statement of current assets and liabilities is
required of candidates for federal office.
In her FEC filings, Ferraro — as promised —

waived the exemption she had claimed on her
congressional disclosure forms and instead re
ported her husband's assets along with hers.
Because the reporting is in broad ranges, it is
impossible to state their exact net worth, but her
assets were at least $549,000 and possibly more
than $1,004,000. Against these, she listed
liabilities of only $25,000 to $50,000, her share of
their mortgage on a Virgin Islands condominium.
Zaccaro showed assets of at least $856,000 and
possibly more than $1,056,000. But his liabilities
were much larger, at least $608,000 and possibly
more than $903,000. However, because of am
biguities in the way the form is structured, there
was a chance that about half of his liabilities had
already been deducted from his assets.
O'Brien and typed statements released with the
returns confirmed published reports over the
weekend that the couple would owe additional
taxes for 1978.
The spokesman said the couple was filing an
amended return yesterday for 1978 along with the
check, which included $29,709 in additional
income tax for the year and $23,750 in interest for
the late payments. O'Brien said the error was dis
covered by an accounting firm hired three weeks
ago by the couple. He said the Internal Revenue
Service had not discovered the error, which he at
tributed to another accounting firm used by the
family.
The accountants in 1978 failed to list as a gain
for Ferraro the amount of a mortgage which was
assumed by a partner who purchased her interest
in a New York City building.
On their income-tax returns, Ferraro showed
that between 1979 and 1983 she had gross income
of $332,474 and paid federal, state and local
income tax of $130,922, or 39.38 percent of her
total income.
From 1979 to 1983, Zaccaro had gross income
of $533,969, and paid federal, state and local
taxes totaling $220,344, or 41.27 percent of his
income.
