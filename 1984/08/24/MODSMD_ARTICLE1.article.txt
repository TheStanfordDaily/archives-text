# NLRB won't force Stanford to recognize USW
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
The Washington, D.C., headquarters of the National
Labor Relations Board has decided not to seek a tem
porary injunction forcing Stanford to recognize United
Stanford Workers, Local 680, as the exclusive repre
sentative for 1330 technical, maintenance and service
workers in the Stanford bargaining unit.
NLRB officials in the Oakland regional office in
formed University Staff Counsel Michael Vartain and
USW attorney Jim Eggleston of the decision yesterday.
Yesterday's decision, a victory for the University,
follows the Oakland regional office's July recommen
dation that an injunction be sought against the Univer

sity in federal court until the NLRB hearing of USW's
complaint on Sept. 17.
The union claims it followed proper disaffiliation
procedures when it broke away from Local 715 in
February. Since April, the University has claimed the
disaffiliation was illegal and therefore the workers have
not been represented.
University Personnel Director Rob Parker said yes
terday the national office's decision confirmed Stan
ford's "continuing belief that an NLRB election —
which would provide the workers with a fair and free
choice — is the proper and lawful way to determine the
validity of Local 680's claims."
USW officials say that Stanford workers have already

expressed their desire for Loeal 680's representation in
April's referendum election. They say yesterday's deci
sion was expected.
"This is no surprise," said USW President Linda
Crouse.
"What surprised us is that the regional office re
quested the injunction at all. The Board [NLRB] in
Washington issues very few injunctions and is currently
under investigation by a congressional committee for
failing to issue injunctive relief as provided for in the
National Labor Relations Act,"she said.
" The fact that the Oakland [regional office] re
quested the injunction before the hearing is a statement
that they take our case seriouslv."
