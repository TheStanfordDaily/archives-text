# We've only just begun...

Sam thinks it's over, but Shirish knows it's just starting. And to Adam, it's
nothing hut a nightmarish memory.
// that confuses you, just wait until you read the next USW story.
As the summer Daily winds up yet another session, the staff looks with
trepidation at what looms on the horizon: a 64-page Orientation issue,
even bigger house ads, more ice cream for munchies, the conference room,
getting back at the Chappie and, of course, the Daily daily, beginning Sept.
24.
With the inevitable return of old staff, too enthusiastically recounting to us
tales of their khaki-clad internships in Washington, D.C. and the big bucks
they made at dad's business, we also look forward to seeing some new
faces. New staffers are always welcome, especially as the new volume gets
underway. Consider it the Daily's white flower sale.
Meanwhile, summer staffers should sally on over to Storke tonight at 6:30
for the banquet. Drinks here, followed by dinner at the Charthouse in Half
Moon Bay. Bring your checkbook for that reduced - but not free - dinner,
and leave your Elvis tapes at home. After all, we've got a couple more
weeks.
