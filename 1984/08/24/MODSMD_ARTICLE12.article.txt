## USW President clears up issues 
### 
Some media have made it difficult for people to understand the
dispute between USW and the Stanford Administration. For exam
ple, in the Aug. 8 issue of the Campus Report, the editors responded
to a letter in support of USW by parroting the Administration's legal
position. We would like to clarify what is going on.
Some press statements have implied that the main case in the
USW-Stanford dispute, the federal National Labor Relations Board
case being heard Sept. 17, is simply a USW vs. Stanford issue with the
NLRB in the middle. This is false. After an investigation, the NLRB,
not USW, issued a complaint against the Stanford. The NLRB, not

Viewpoint

USW will prosecute Stanford, much as a district attorney prosecutes a
criminal violator.
Other articles have implied that federal NLRB charges are being
slung back and forth by both USW and the University and give the
impression that they all end up being equivalent. This is false. Up to
last month all the charges which Stanford filed against the union were
dismissed by the NLRB. The charge which the union filed against
Stanford, however, was upheld by the NLRB, and now is being
prosecuted.
Recently Stanford filed another NLRB charge. Since the charge is
contrary to the position the NLRB took after its investigation, we
assume this charge will also be dismissed. With this charge, though,
the Administration stooped to a new low. They claimed that last
spring, between February and April, Local 715 cashed dues checks
and then slipped the cash under the table to USW.
Cancelled checks immediately showed this was untrue. At this
point management took a new position. It said they never knew that
USW was receiving dues money even though USW was functioning
during this time. We find this astounding for several reasons: (1)
USW printed its budget, including dues income, on meeting an
nouncements between February and April. (2) From February to
April Stanford recognized USW representatives as representatives of
715 up until the time of the election. It was only when USW, Local
680 won the April election, an election found to be valid by the
NLRB, that Stanford refused to recognize USW at all.
To claim that USW shouldn't have received dues to function during
this time is so "flaky" we can only conclude that it is designed to
make the union look financially unethical or corrupt.
USW officers work all day as laborers, technicians, loading dock
workers and lab assistants. After work and on weekends they work at
the USW office to defend their union againt the Administration'*; at
tacks. They do this for no pay at all.
We believe our union is one of the most honest orgaizations to be
found anywhere.
