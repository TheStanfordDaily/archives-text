# RESTAURANTS
## City offers a restaurant or bar for everyone 
### LARRY BOSCHE 
Whether concluding a day of
menial underpaid labor, finish
ing up a day of intensive re
search at one of the libraries or
just racking your brains over the
up-coming 10-week exams, San
Francisco offers plenty of vari
ety to break up any form of
daytime monotony and anxiety
you may be experiencing.
There are quaint European
restaurants and nighttime vista
points for the romantically in
clined. For those who prefer a
more sedate, cultured (i.e. ex
pensive) evening, "the City" of
fers elegant restaurants and bars
ranging from modernistic to the
stiff-upper-lip variety and a vast
array of sophisticated cultural
activities, including opera, bal
let, dance, etc.
For the intellectual, late night
bookstores, coffee houses and
foreign movie theatres abound
for serious fun. Nightclubs and
discos are for the dancers, rock
and rollers, jazzers, soul-people
and the countless variations
thereof.
Even if you do not fit into any
of the above categories, you will
not have a hard time finding
something to do in the City.
The following suggestions of
restaurants is intended to be an
eclectic rundown compiled with
a student budget in mind.
There are so many good res
taurants in San Francisco that
any guide book that lists fewer
than 300 is incomplete. Choos
ing a restaurant in this city can
be overwhelming. One of the
first steps of attacking the prob
lem is to decide what kind of
food you want to eat. However,
even this can be difficult consid
ering there are 63 different
types, including Basque,
Polynesian, Yugoslavian and
Dim Sum.
Not surprisingly, the place to

look for a Chinese restaurant is
in Chinatown. A reasonable
Hispanic restaurant can be
found in the Mission district and
Italian food lives in North
Beach or "little Italy".
But if you're searching for
any of the other 60 varieties, the
phone book's ethnic guide to
restaurants is a help. Some of
the less expensive foreign res
taurants I tried and liked are
Basta Pasta (Italian) 1268
Grant Ave., Pasand's (Indian),
1875 Union St., The Hunan
Restaurant (Chinese) 924
Sansome St.and Capp's Corner
(Italian) at the corner of Green
Street and Powell Street. Other
recommendable restaurants in
clude La Palma (Spanish), 2884
24th St.and La Trattoria
(Italian) 1507 Polk St., both of
which are also moderately
priced.
When searching for good
American food you might try
one of the better (and more ex
pensive) seafood grills in the
business district. These include
Jack's, Sam's, Tadich Grill and
Dashiell Hammett's old hang
out, John's Grill where you can
order Sam Spade Chops.
An excellent hamburger can
be had at Clown Alley at 42 Co
lumbus Ave. in North Beach
and at Hamburger Mary's, 58
Folsom St. Hippo's Hamburgers
at Van Ness and Pacific offers
57 varieties of the hamburger. If
poverty and desperation strike,
McDonalds' and Zims' are
strategically placed all over the
city.
The adventuresome should
try dinner at The California
Culinary Institute on the
seventh floor at 1507 Fremont
St., where student chefs try their
best to create a gourmet meal.
But just remember that if they
fail, all they will get is a bad
grade. Dinner here is cheap and

reservations are necessary.
Seatings at 6, 6:30, and 7 p.m.
Call 543-2764.
One of San Francisco's local
charms are its wine bars where
tradition allows one to order
Napa's finest by the glass. The
originator of this thrifty custom
is the London Wine Bar, 415
Sansome St. in the finacial dis
trict. Other bars specializing in
wine by the glass include SRO
at 4 Embarcadero, and the bars
at the St. Francis and the Clift
hotels. The Jug Shop features
small glasses of wine at 25 cents
a shot and is located at 567.
Pacific Ave.
Gino and Carlo's cocktail
lounge at 548 Green St. is one

of many interesting bars in the
North Beach area. Campari
drinks are excellent, especially
the Negroni.
For a look at influential San
Franciscans, have a drink at the
Washington Square Bar and
Grill, where many of the city's
lawyers, politicians, journalists
and businessmen congregate.
The bar is in the middle of the
North Beach district across from
Washington Square on Colum
bus Avenue.
Coffee houses, cafes and
gelato shops are spread out
along Columbus Avenue in the
North Beach area. The Tosca
Cafe at 242 Columbus Ave.

features coffee drinks and
brandies in an elegant atmo
sphere.
John's Grill also has a bar
which serves drinks named after
the memorable characters from
Dashiell Hammett's detective
novels.
Even after the 60s have come
and gone there are still some
cafes that recreate the atmo
sphere of that era. Psalms Cafe
in the Haight district at the cor
ner of Masonic Avenue and
Haight Street has changed a bit
but is still pretty hip. Cafe
Trieste, once one of the gather
ing places of the Beat genera
tion, is still around also.
