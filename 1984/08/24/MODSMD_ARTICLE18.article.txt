Greens at Fort M son
Building 'A' Fort Mason
San Francisco
771-6222
The incredibly popular Greens at Fort
Mason is where the healthy and the
wealthy meet for lunch. The appealing
atmosphere and delicious food make this
all vegetarian restaurant attract even
those who usually opt for a steak.
When I asked a friend of mine who is a
self-acclaimed hedonist if he'd ever
heard of Green's, he responded, "Ugh,
that sounds healthy." He was right. The
whole wheat breads, tofu dishes, salads
and vegetables certainly qualify as
healthy. But while you sit overlooking
the Golden Gate Bridge and examining
the modern art on the wall, you'll prob
ably forget it.
Greens is located in what looks like it
was once a warehouse. Inside, the design
of the building turns out to be a big plus.
A long room with high ccilings and one
full wall of paned windows is bright and

black bean chili with cheese ($2.50) and
several others would be fairly safe bets
for anybody.

But the best thing about Greens is
their use of foods that most restaurants
ignore. For example, we had a lentil and
goat cheese salad that was great. The
type of lentils Greens uses are smaller
and more tender than those commonly
found. They were blended in a light
vinaigrette with herbs and small pieces of
vegetables. The goat cheese adds a lot of
flavor and makes this a good combina
tion.
Instead of a bacon, lettuce and tomato
sandwich, try a "tit" (tofu. lettuce and
tomato). The tofu has a tremendous
flavor because it is marinated and
charcoal-grilled.
The bread is reason alone to try
Greens. It is made there at what is called
the I assajara Bread Bakery. The whole
wheat bread is dense and delicious and
the white-egg bread is one of the best
white breads I've tried. One can buy
bread and pastries at the bakery counter.

might try asking for a window table.
