# Hunan Restaurant: Get ready for the heat

The main emphasis at the Hunan Restaurant is
on the food itself. Maybe this is why it has become
San Francisco's most highly regarded Chinese res
taurant. When visiting the City many food con
noisseurs bypass the rest of Chinatown and head
for the restaurant with lightning-hot Hunan
dishes. No other restaurant with quite the same
combination of excellent food and austere sur
roundings attracts so many food lovers.
Hunan is a province of China where the people
like it hot. The dishes of thjs province provide a
kind of supersensory input which has an enliven
ing effect. According to the menu, harvest pork
($5.00), one of the spiciest dishes, is fed to planta
tion workers at harvest time to revive fading
spirits and spent muscles. People unaccustomed to
hot food may find their faces sweating and that
they can't get enough water. Milder dishes are ad
visable, at least for the first visit.
The first visit may be a surprise since the atmo
sphere is suggestive of a cafeteria rather than a fa
mous restaurant. The structure that houses the
restaurant was probably a warehouse before.
Upon entering the main dining room, one is
struck by the large banners which declare "We
use no MSG [mono-sodium glutamate]" and
"Welcome to the Hunan Restaurant." Not an in-

timate setting but a cut above the tacky Chinese
lanterns and gaudy paintings of other Chinese res
taurants.
The food quickly pushes away any worries
about the atmosphere. We started our meal with
onion cakes (51.50) which are very light flour
cakes made with egg and onion. These cakes are
the original creation of the owners wife. Diana
Chung. Besides authentic Hunan dishes, there are
other dishes like the meat pie and chicken with
curry that are original creations of the house.
Next we ordered a chicken dish, smoked ham
and squid. They were all excellent. The chicken
and smoked ham were both hot but not over
whelming. Noteworthy was the chicken dish —
"Henry's Special' — which included shrimps and
scallops. And the vegetables accompanying the
meat were not overcooked. The squid, which is
not always available, came in an excellent black
bean sauce with onions and bamboo shoots.
Three dishes seemed like a lot to order for two
people, but outstanding food doesn't sit around
on the platter. My companion and I established a
slow pace and were surprised how easily it all
went down. We left the restaurant feeling like we
were ready to work in the fields but opted for a
stroll throught the North Beach instead.
It's easy to be critical of a restaurant but lying is
unethical. This restaurant sizzles.
