# Quad to be finished by fall
## 
### LISA LYNCH Daily staff 
Despite a delay of several weeks, the
Inner Quad construction will be com
pleted before the beginning of fall quar
ter, said University Project Manager
Max Mazenko.
Mazenko said the entire Quad project
should be completed sometime in late
September but added that the main part
of the construction should be completed
sometime in the middle of that month.
"By the middle of next month the
Quad should be fairly secure," Mazenko
said. "The decorative tiles should all be
down and we'll be finishing the planting
of the islands."
So far, the renovation of the Quad has
gone fairly smoothly, said Mazenko. The
delay in completion is not due to any un
foreseen problems, but rather to a
"design decision" made by those
working on the Quad renovation.
"We took an extra two weeks to
review the color of the Quad tiles,"
Mazenko said. "We laid out about 1000
square feet of the tile, and looked at the

color, and decided it wasn't the best that
it could be. So we laid out another strip
of tile, in a similar color, and decided to
use that color instead."
Aside from that deviation, the con
struction has gone according to schedule,
except for expected materials shipment
delays. A complete new underground
utilities system has been installed
beneath the Quad's surface, including
new electrical wiring and a new storm
drainage system to prevent the Quad
from becoming a "swimming pool"
during winter rains. A layer of base rock
has been set down over that.
There have been no major modifica
tions of construction plans along the way,
said Mazenko. Most of the interpretive
work came at the beginning of the proj
ect, when the construction crew had to
update the Olmsted Plan to suit their
needs.
Mazenko said that Olmsted's 100-
year-old plans were reconsidered in
terms of "the materials available today

as opposed to a century ago" and the
needs of the University today.
"The final product will be a close
reproduction of the Olmsted plan as far
as size, scale and geometric shape,"
Mazenko said. "We did slightly enlarge
the size of the islands."
"I could show you old drawings that
show curb walls around the island," he
said, "but they're not by Olmsted. All of
the Olmsted drawings were pretty in
determinate about this."
