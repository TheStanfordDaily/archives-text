Managua Restaurant
7384 Mission Street
Daly City
991-9620
Located in Daly City close to
Interstate 280, the Managua
Restaurant is a good place to
stop by on the way to the airport
or the City. It a small restaurant,
owned and run by a Nicaraguan
family who came to California
after the 1972 earthquake in
Managua.
The family serves several

drinks — cacao (ground cocoa
beans and milk), orchata (jicaro
seed and milk), chicha (ground
corn), and tamarindo
(tamarind) — that are made
there and are delicious. We
didn't try any of the appetizers
but Ceveche ($3.00) made of
chopped sea bass and marinated
in fresh lime juice looked good.
Oysters and clams were also of
fered.
The entrees are served with
rice and beans and include both
meat and seafood dishes. The
seafood soups also sounded ap

pealing. Service was fast and
friendly, and by the end of the
meal, we felt as if we had eaten
in their home in Nicaragua in
stead of in a small, diner-type
restaurant on Mission Street.
This was evident because we
felt obliged to clean our plates
in order to show courtesy and
appreciation, a custom practiced
by those visiting a Latin- Amer
ican home. We tried two meat
dishes: a plate of slightly spicy
shredded beef ($5.25), and the
Enchiladas Nicas ($5.00), con
sisting of deep fried cheese and

beef wrapped in corn tortillas.
These entrees were good but
not exceptional; we ended up
wishing we had tried the
seafood specialities. Paella
Marinera ($9.75) is a traditional
Spanish rice dish with seafood
and can be quite good. Other
tempting choices were scallops
in garlic sauce ($7.50), shrimp
in red sauce ($7.50) and shrimp
in a garlic, lemon and wine
sauce.
For the adventurous, more
traditional Nicaraguan food was
offered as well.

We had a pleasant conversa
tion with the waiter who told us
that his family also owned the
Nicaraguan Restaurant on 3015
Mission Street. He whispered
that the food at that location
was even better.
If you want to practice your
Spanish, discuss Nicaraguan his
tory and politics, or just be
hosted by a friendly Latino fam
ily, try the Managua Restaurant.
