The Campton Place Restaurant
340 Stockton St.
San Francisco
(800) 235-4300.
Truly "American" cuisine of
ten defies definition — the food
that tickles this nation's palate is
as diverse as the ingredients in
the melting pot which make up
the rich texture of Americana.
But the Sunday brunch menu
at the Campton Place Restau
rant, off Union Square, comes
very close to meeting that ideal
of being 'rear' American
cooking.
Even near perfection has its
price, however, and at' the
Campton Place, you pay
through youi nose ior what
must unden ibly be one of the
most sir sly scrumptious
culinar ' criences of your
life. Ou> o7 bill for two cov
e ed >p _ lea si expensive

items on the menu and certainly
did not account for all the
available courses. (The most ex
pensive item on the menu is
Kansas City strip steak at $14.)
The Campton Place Restau
rant's atmosphere, on the other
hand, is one of subdued luxury
— neither overbearingly preten
tious nor intimidatingly posh.
Our semi-formal attire suited
the quietly conservative sur
roundings. The interior, with its
combination of traditional and
contemporary themes, rather
resembles a dining room in an
elegant home. The restaurant's
windows, unfortunately, over
look a narrow downtown alley,
and this does the restaurant's in
terior, and one of the most
beautiful cities in the world, a
terrible injustice.
The service is excellent. The

generally unobtruisve; only the
occasional noisy chatter
emanating from the kitchen dis
turbed the peaceful atmosphere
of the dining room. Reserva
tions, recommended by the res
taurant, turned out to be un
necessary for the relatively
early-morning hour of 10:30.
We were seated immediately
upon arrival.
Bill, our waiter, quickly
served us with tea and coffee
($2.00 — the cheapest item on
the menu) and rich 4k hot"
(actually lukewarm) chocolate
with bitter chocolate cream
($3.00). The first course fol
lowed soon afterward. Fresh
berries ($5.00) consisted of
strawberries, blueberries and
raspberries. The fruit was deli -
ciously fresh, firm and tender,
evenlv chilled, and of a quality,

local markets.
Wild mushrooms in cream
and sherry with herb crust,
also $5.00, was our only foray
into chef Bradley Ogden's
epicurean world of exotic gour
met cooking. Not that the other
fabulous creations from his
kitchen aren't just as delightful,
but simply that the rest of our
meal was limited to more stan
dard fare. But the tasty, velvety
smoothness of the mushrooms
in cream more than satiated our
quest for a brief, esoteric ad
venture in fine dining.
Only one small incident
marred an otherwise marvelous
meal: the appearance of a small
insect among the lemon slices
for the tea. (Bill identified it as a
gnat.) But it and the lemon
slices were swept away, to be
replaced by a basket of buck
wheat di Tiuffins, slices of Bos

ton brown bread and a gustatory
second course which soon made
us forget our unpleasant
encounter with the arthropod
world.
The morning's entree, for us,
consisted of blueberry hotcakes
($8.50) and two eggs with bacon
accompanied by fried potatoes.
Butter chilled with shaved ice
added an icy touch of class to
the hotcakes, which, garnished
with fresh blueberries, never
theless failed to meet our expec
tations.
But the bacon was spectacu
lar: four strips cooked to a lean,
greaseless, savory crisp. The
slightly moist scrambled eggs
were fluffy and flavorful. Ex
quisitely browned potatoes
seasoned with aromatic spices
rounded out a delectable repast
