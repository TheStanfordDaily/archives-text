## College football needs a playoff to see who's No. 1 
### 
As college football teams
began practice and another
season draws nearer, the annual
debate about how the national
championship is determined
reappears.
Proponents of a playoff sys
tem say that it would enable a
fair determination of which

John Lis

team in the country is truly No.
1. Opponents of such a system
favor retaining the current wire
service poll, claiming that a
playoff would lengthen the
season and interfere with
school work.
According to a lot of
proposals, the detractors have a
valid argument. If a playoff
were to begin after the New
Year's Day bowl games, the
season would end in the middle
of January, which probably is
too late.
It seems, though, that if the
bowl games were included in the
plan, a national champion could

be determined by Jan. 1, which
would leave the length of the
season the same as it is now.
A 16-team playoff beginning
the second week in December
and ending New Year's Day
that incorporates the bowl
games that we currently have
would allow a true national
championship to be decided and
make the bowl games more in
teresting for fans (read: more
people watching, more televi
sion money, more happy ath
letic departments).
The playoff would be set up
with four regions — East,
Mideast, Midwest and West —
like the NCAA basketball
tournament. Seven conference
champions and the top indepen
dent team would automatically
qualify, the other eight teams
would be chosen on an at-large
basis.
The Atlantic Coast Confer
ence champion and the major
independent with the best
record would play in the East,
the Big Ten and Southeastern
Conference champs in the
Mideast, the Big Eight and
Southwest Conference champs
in the Midwest, and the Pacific
10 and the Western Athletic

Conference champs in the West.
The other eight teams would be
chosen without regard to region.
A total of 15 bowl games
would make up the playoff.
Minor bowl games like the Sun,
Bluebonnet, Holiday, Aloha,
Citrus, Hall of Fame, Indepen
dence and Peach Bowls would
be first-round games.

Every major NCAA sport except
football has a tournament to decide a
champion, and even Divisions l-AA, II and
111 have playoffs to determine the No. 1
football team. It's time Division I football
did the same.

The Gator, Liberty and Fiesta
Bowls would host quarterfinal
games the third Saturday in
December. The four major
bowls — the Rose, Orange,
Cotton and Sugar Bowls —
would rotate games. Each year
one would host a quarterfinal,
two would feature semifinal
matchups on Christmas Eve,
and one would be the national
championship game on New

Year's Day.
This system should overall be
advantageous to the bowl
games. The aforementioned
minor bowls often feature teams
that are not even in the top 20.
Under this playoff system, they
would have two of the top 16
teams in the nation, one of
which would be a conference

champion or the No. 1 indepen
dent.
The major bowl games would
benefit because they would not
be competing head-to-head as
they do every Jan. 1. And each
would host the national champi
onship game every four years, a
game that could easily come to
rival the Super Bowl as the
premier sports event of the year.
The need for such a system

was pointed out again last
season. Going into the New
Year's Day bowls, both Ne
braska and Texas were unde
feated, but Nebraska was
ranked No. 1. There was a pos
sibility that both teams would
end up undefeated, with no way
of determining which was the
better team, save for the vote of
the AP sportswriters.
As it turned out, Texas lost to
Georgia in the Cotton Bowl and
Nebraska was defeated by No.
5-ranked Miami (Fla.) in the
Orange Bowl. Auburn, the No.
3 team, had defeated Michigan
in the Sugar 3owl to finish like
Nebraska, Texas and Miami
with one loss, but did not move
up in the polls. Miami was voted
the national champion, with Ne
braska No. 2.
A playoff would eliminate
such arbitrary decisions and al
low the national championship
to be decided on the field in
stead of in the polls. Every
major NCAA sport except foot
ball has a tournament to decide
a champion, and even Divisions
I-AA, II and 111 have playoffs to
determine the No. 1 football
team. It's time Division I foot
ball did the same.
