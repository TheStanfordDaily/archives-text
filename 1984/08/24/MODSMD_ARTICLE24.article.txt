The Wrong Man (1957)
Festival, Palo Alto
Maxwell Anderson and Angus
McPhail's fact-based suspense
drama of a Stork Club musician
mistakenly arrested for robbery
bears so little resemblance to
any of Alfred Hitchcock's other
movies that it has never caught
on, and Hitchcock himself may
not have realized how good it
was. Henry Fonda's absolutely
realistic acting in the title role
must have inspired Hitchcock to
give the film a documentary
texture; it's frighteningly con
vincing. With Vera Miles as
Fonda's nervous wife, Anthony
Quayle, Harold J. Stone and Es
ther Minciotti.
Plays through Wednesday
with The 39 Steps.
L It's a Gift (1934)
Palo Alto
■ W.C. Fields battles the
■ tyranny of a nagging wife
' (Kathleen Howard), a self
centered daughter (Jean
Rouveral) and an obnoxious
little boy (Baby Le Roy), sells
his corner store, and moves his
insufferable family out to Cali
fornia, where he has purchased
some worthless land. The heap
of disasters fate visits on Fields
includes the unintentional
destruction of his store by a
blind man (a scene derived from
the Fatty Arbuckle-Buster
Keaton short The Butcher Boy),
and there's a great moment
when Kathleen Howard
demands that Fields give half his
sandwich to his son and he rolls
back the meat so that the boy

gets only bread, but mostly it's a
dull movie. Some sequences
move so slowly that the 73
minutes seem more like 173.
Norman McLeod directed, from
a Jack Cunningham script; the
story is part Fields and part J. P.
McEvoy.
Plays with I'm No Angel and
She Done Him Wrong, begin
ning Thursday.
The Beggar's Opera (1953)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Peter Brook made this film of
the wonderful John Gay satirical
musical (written in 1728 as a
parody of contemporary opera)
while he was still an enfant ter
rible; it was his first essay into
movies, and it remains his best.
Brook captured the spirit of mu
sical comedy as completely as
the best M-G-M directors of the
period (Stanley Donen and Vin
cente Minnelli) did: The camera
dances, and the actors seem to
be having the time of their lives.
And what actors! Laurence
Olivier, using his own singing
voice (a surprisingly pleasing
baritone), is a witty Macheath —
it may be the only one of his
major performances that almost
no one has seen — and much of
the cream of the English theater
backs him up: Stanley Holloway,
Dorothy Tutin, Hugh Griffith,
George Devine. Mary Clare, At
hene Seyler, Margot Grahame,
Daphne Anderson. Dennis Can
nan and Christopher Fry did the
(fine) adaptation, and Arthur
Bliss supervised the felicitous
musical arrangements.
Plays next Monday (Sept. 3)
with A Night at the Opera.
