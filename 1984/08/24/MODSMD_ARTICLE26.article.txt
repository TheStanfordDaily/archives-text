# Zaccaro tells court he tried to preserve estate
## 
### 
New York â€” John Zaccaro, husband of Demo
cratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro,
defended himself in a courtroom yesterday against
charges of unethical business conduct, saying that
his borrowing $175,000 from a widow's estate he
was managing ultimately enhanced the estate's
value.
Claiming that he had done "everything to
preserve the estate," Zaccaro told Justice Edwin
Kassoff of the New York Supreme Court, which is a
lower-level trial court, in Queens, that it had never
entered his mind that he had done anything wrong.
Zaccaro, a real estate broker who is not a lawyer,
testified that he had seen nothing in the court's writ

ten instructions that precluded him from borrowing
from an estate for which he was the conservator.
The hearing marked Zaccaro's first public com
ments about his personal business affairs, an issue
that continues to plague Ferraro's campaign.
