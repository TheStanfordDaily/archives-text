Washington â€” The State Department has
received a report that Soviet dissident Yelena Bon
ner, the wife of physicist Andrei Sakharov. has been
secretly tried and sentenced to up to five years inter
nal exile for "slandering the Soviet state,'' depart
ment spokesman Alan Romberg said yesterday.
Romberg said the report was unconfirmed, but
sufficiently reliable for the State Department to
make it public, along with a new denunciation of the
Soviet Union for its "disregard of basic human
decency."
Romberg also said the State Department is still
concerned about the Sakharovs' health, and said a
Soviet-supplied videotape of the couple broadcast
by ABC News did not prove that they are well be
cause it is more than a month old.
