# Stanford seeks injunction against Niven's today

### ELAINE WANG Daily staff 
The Stanford lawsuit hearing against
Niven's International Foods was
postponed Tuesday and will resume this
morning. The University is in the process
of suing owner John Niven over his plans
to install Mrs. Fields cookies and Cone
a-Copia ice cream in his supermarket.
Earlier this week, Niven filed a cross
complaint against Stanford. He believes
Stanford is allowing Neiman-Marcus, a
large department store, to have a sub
stantial food department in it. "My lease
says I have exclusive right to be the . . .
supermarket in the shopping center,"
said Niven. "Other food stores may not
exceed . . . 2500 [square] feet."
Although his information is "second
hand "-said Niven. *-Â»e believes thit
Neiman-Marcus plans over 6000 square
feet of retail space for food. "We asked
Stanford to provide information, to give
us the exact plans," he said."But they
refused."
"Interrogatives (formal questions)
have been served to Stanford," he
added. "That's something we wont com
promise on." He doesn't think, however,
that Neiman-Marcus knows "there are
limitations" to how much food space is
allowed.
Stanford's general counsel, John
Schwartz, said,"There is language in the
lease that deals with other people in the
shopping center, but obviously, we come
at it from different viewpoints."
"We're not aware of anything
Neiman-Marcus plans to do a year or
two from now that would violate Niven's
lease," he stated. "And whatever
Neiman-Marcus does a year or two from
now couldn't possibly have anything to
do with whether or not Niven's is in
violation of its own lease now."
"Niven filed a cross-complaint now for
a year from now," he continued. "There
are two different things going on. We're

suing for something they've done. We're
not speculating."
What Niven is doing, Schwartz said,
"has no relationship to the present law
suit," although a lawsuit with cross
complaints gets settled all at once at the
end. "If Neiman-Marcus is doing some
thing improper in a year or two, then
Niven can sue them," he said.
Meanwhile, the spotlight remains on
what Niven wryly terms "Cookiegate."

"If we win Friday (today) we'll put in
Mrs. Fields and Cone-a-Copia immedi
ately," he said. Even if Stanford gets a
preliminary injunction to hold Niven at
bay, "there has to be a trial to finalize the
preliminary injunction," said Niven. "I
cant allow Stanford to tie my hands now.
If every other supermarket a has sushi
bar sometime in the future ... I want the
flexibility
Debbi Fields, owner of Mrs. Fields
cookies, agrees that Niven will need the
flexibility. But she views the situation
