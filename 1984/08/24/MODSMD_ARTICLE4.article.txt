# Stanford seeks injunction against Niven's today
## 
### ELAINE WANG Daily staff 
The Stanford lawsuit hearing against
Niven's International Foods was
postponed Tuesday and will resume this
morning. The University is in the process
of suing owner John Niven over his plans
to install Mrs. Fields cookies and Cone
a-Copia ice cream in his supermarket.
Earlier this week, Niven filed a cross
complaint against Stanford. He believes
Stanford is allowing Neiman-Marcus, a
large department store, to have a sub
stantial food department in it. "My lease
says I have exclusive right to be the . . .
supermarket in the shopping center,"
said Niven. "Other food stores may not
exceed . . . 2500 [square] feet."
Although his information is "second
hand "-said Niven. *-»e believes thit
Neiman-Marcus plans over 6000 square
feet of retail space for food. "We asked
Stanford to provide information, to give
us the exact plans," he said."But they
refused."
"Interrogatives (formal questions)
have been served to Stanford," he
added. "That's something we wont com
promise on." He doesn't think, however,
that Neiman-Marcus knows "there are
limitations" to how much food space is
allowed.
Stanford's general counsel, John
Schwartz, said,"There is language in the
lease that deals with other people in the
shopping center, but obviously, we come
at it from different viewpoints."
"We're not aware of anything
Neiman-Marcus plans to do a year or
two from now that would violate Niven's
lease," he stated. "And whatever
Neiman-Marcus does a year or two from
now couldn't possibly have anything to
do with whether or not Niven's is in
violation of its own lease now."
"Niven filed a cross-complaint now for
a year from now," he continued. "There
are two different things going on. We're

suing for something they've done. We're
not speculating."
What Niven is doing, Schwartz said,
"has no relationship to the present law
suit," although a lawsuit with cross
complaints gets settled all at once at the
end. "If Neiman-Marcus is doing some
thing improper in a year or two, then
Niven can sue them," he said.
Meanwhile, the spotlight remains on
what Niven wryly terms "Cookiegate."

"If we win Friday (today) we'll put in
Mrs. Fields and Cone-a-Copia immedi
ately," he said. Even if Stanford gets a
preliminary injunction to hold Niven at
bay, "there has to be a trial to finalize the
preliminary injunction," said Niven. "I
cant allow Stanford to tie my hands now.
If every other supermarket a has sushi
bar sometime in the future ... I want the
flexibility
Debbi Fields, owner of Mrs. Fields
cookies, agrees that Niven will need the
flexibility. But she views the situation

with 'lots of nostalgia and emotion,"
having spend seven years trying to get a
location in Stanford Shopping Center.
I feel like it's (Palo Alto) my
hometown," she said. "I started there."
Fields first outlet was the cookie shop at
Liddicoats on University Avenue. She
feels her success is due mainly to support
from Stanford students, and her
"satellite" at the Bookstore — where
cookies are delivered instead of baked
on the premises — is in appreciation for
how far she's come.

I feel that Stanford for seven years
has been unfair, she said. "When I went
to them initially (seven years ago) for a
mall location, all I had was a concept,
and they told me I didn't have enough
background."
Hve years ago, when another place in
the mall opened up, they gave it to
Cookie Habit and told me it was because
one of the owners was a Stanford grad
• • . but my husband's a Stanford
graduate, too," she said.
Then five months ago, I tried again
and was turned down because I was a
chain, she said. (David's Cookies, who
got the mall location, is also a chain, with
headquarters in New York, except that it

operates with franchises.)
"I don't understand," Fields said.
"And ! teel bad and extremely disap
pointed. I don't see competition as an
issue, because three different locations at
a mall involve three different walking
patterns of customers."
"I don't think they'll (Cookie Habit)
will go out of business, I think we all
have a different product," she added.
"If you put out positive and good
things, it will come back to you," she
stressed. "1 would have no exterior
signage on the windows of Niven's. 1
don't advertise, and I'd basically be ser
ving his clientele."

has been unfair, she said. "When I went
to them initially (seven years ago) for a
mall location, all I had was a concept,
and they told me I didn't have enough
background."
Hve years ago, when another place in
the mall opened up, they gave it to
Cookie Habit and told me it was because
one of the owners was a Stanford grad
• • . but my husband's a Stanford
graduate, too," she said.
Then five months ago, I tried again
and was turned down because I was a
chain, she said. (David's Cookies, who
got the mall location, is also a chain, with
headquarters in New York, except that it

operates with franchises.)
"I don't understand," Fields said.
"And ! teel bad and extremely disap
pointed. I don't see competition as an
issue, because three different locations at
a mall involve three different walking
patterns of customers."
"I don't think they'll (Cookie Habit)
will go out of business, I think we all
have a different product," she added.
"If you put out positive and good
things, it will come back to you," she
stressed. "1 would have no exterior
signage on the windows of Niven's. 1
don't advertise, and I'd basically be ser
ving his clientele."
