# University sued over Willow Road
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
Stanford's proposed Willow
road extension continues to
come under fire, this time from
a Menlo Park woman who wants
to block the move until the Uni
versity undertakes a compre
hensive environmental impact
report.
Nancy Cross, a long-time res
ident of the Willow-Sand Hill
Road area, filed suit on Aug. 9
on behalf of herself and the
Committee for Safe and Sen
sible San Francisquito Creek
Area Routing, a citizens group
she chairs.
Cross' lawsuit comes in the
wake of a recommendation
from the Palo Alto Planning
Commission that the University

be forced to make several ex
pensive additions to the project,
ones that would more than
double the already $2 million
cost.
Among other things, the
planning commission suggests
expanding the Menlo Park in
tersection of Santa Cruz Ave
nue and Sand Hill Road, a move
which would require the permis
sion of the Menlo Park City
Council. A polling of the Coun
cil indicates that passage is
unlikely.
The Willow extension project
is designed to make a
thoroughfare between Willow
and El Camino, just north of the
Stanford Shopping Center. Cur
rently Willow stops at Arbore
tum Road, and traffic is routed
south around the shopping cen
ter. The University has agreed
to pay for the entire cost.
Cross's suit opposes the Wil
low Road extension, the Stan
ford Hospital's Modernization
Project (HMP) and the pro
posed parking lot expansion at
the Stanford Shopping Center.
It names the University, the
Board of Trustees, the Hospital,
the City of Palo Alto, Palo Alto
Mayor Larry Klein, Kenneth
Schreiber, Palo Alto director of
planning and community envi
ronment, and the San
Francisco-based Environmental
Impact Planning Corp. as defen
dants.
Rodney Johnson, associate
staff counsel for the University,
said the environmental review
process Stanford is currently
using is "adequate by law," and
did not think the lawsuit was
well-grounded.

Cross said the University is
going ahead with large-scale im
provements in the corridor
without determining the envi
ronmental impact — in terms of
both traffic flow and air quality
— of the entire scheme. By stag
gering project starting times and
receiving permits for improve
ments a segment at a time, Stan
ford is causing "irreparable in
jury" to the health, welfare and
environment of the area resi
dents, according to the suit.
Cross says the Environmental
Impact Planning Corp. is not an
impartial observer, as it should
be, but instead had a vested in
terest in whether or not Stan
ford projects were approved be
cause the University was paying
it for its service.
Stanford was served an al
ternative writ of mandate on
Tuesday, which asks it to show
why building and construction
permits shouldn't be suspended
until the trial. The show-cause
hearing is scheduled for Sept. 25
at the Santa Clara County Su
perior Court in Palo Alto.
