## Reagan avoids setting forth future plans 
### 
Dallas — President Reagan made his last speech as a
candidate before a Republican National Convention
last night "a little stroll down memory lane," guaran
teeing himself a night full of cheers for his memory
book — but disappointing those allies who hoped he
would use the occasion mainly to set forth his plans for
the future.
By dwelling on the contrast between what he called
"the misery" of the last Democratic administration and

Analysis

the claimed successes ot his own tirst term, the 73-year
old president provided dozens of applause lines for the
very conservative partisans in the hall.
But by focusing so much cn the past, he muted what
some of his political strategists had hoped would be a
mostly positive appeal to the likely swing groups of the
election. And he relegated to the fine print the program
for the future that his young supporters in Congress had
hoped would serve as a catalyst for a further step
toward party realignment and the mandate for a major
policy shift in 1985.
Top aides said the speech was shaped by the presi
dent's own preferences — especially his desire to get in
his licks at the Democrats for their denunciation of his
performance and his principles during their convention
in San Francisco last month.
"He watched it, and he didn't like it, and he wanted
to get his say," said one adviser.
He contrasted the Democrats' "government of pes
simism. fear and limits" to "ours of hope, confidence
and growth."
Sounding very much like the lesser-light Republican

partisans who had preceded him on the first three
nights of this time-filling convention, he blamed the
Democrats in general and Mondale in particular for
producing "economic crisis" at home and "serious
trouble abroad" during the years Jimmy Carter was
president.
But some of his own top advisers were telling
reporters earlier last night that "it is foolish to bash
Mondale as much as we have done," when the hard
core Republican and conservative vote is already
solidly in Reagan's camp and the verdict now turns on
the decisions of what they were calling "soft Mondale
voters."
These advisers noted that, generally speaking, the
more partisan a national election becomes, the better
the Democrats do. Despite some slight narrowing of
the advantage in the past four years, there are still mil
lions more people who think of themselves as
Democrats than as Republicans.
Making the election a highly partisan contest is es
sentially Mondale's strategy — not Reagan's. The
Democrats are hoping to build that partisan intensity as
a spur to the registration and voter turnout drive that is
their main hope of overhauling Reagan's present lead
in most states.
As he did four years ago, Reagan reminded the tele
vision audience that he "began political life as a Demo
crat, casting my first vote in 1932 for Franklin Delano
Roosevelt." He invited Democrats who agree that
today's "Democratic leaders have taken their party fur
ther and further away from its first principles" to do
what one-time Democratic nominee A 1 Smith did in
1936 — "take a walk."
But some of his political advisers say the best way to

put pressure on those potential Democratic defectors is
to present a positive message, promising goals that they
do not see their own party espousing. The biggest pools
of those defectors are found in blue-collar Northern in
dustrial cities and suburbs and in the South.
The president dangled some second-term lures
before them, mentioning a school-prayer amendment,
anti-crime legislation, tuition-tax credits, among other
things.
But he did not choose to "accentuate the positive."
Instead, he indulged himself in the altogether human
desire to "set the record straight" against Democratic
criticisms that seem to have penetrated deeper through
his armor of good humor than even his close advisers
understood before they saw the partisan passages in the
speech draft Reagan wrote immediately after the Dem
ocratic convention.
There was an uncharacteristically defensive tone to
Reagan's lengthy discussion of budget deficits — whose
growth in the past four years, Mondale had charged in
his acceptance speech, meant the United States is living
"on borrowed time."
Reagan said it was the Democrats who had made
deficit spending "their deliberate policy," for the past
50 years, and blamed them for blocking a constitutional
amendment that would mandate a balanced budget.
But he was anything but specific on his own policies
for reducing the deficit. He pledged to seek tax reforms
that will "bring the tax rates of every American further
down," adding that "if we bring them down far enough,
growth will continue strong ... " and presumably
deficits will decrease.
