# No student rep on postsecondary panel

### 
Sacramento (AP)— An as
semblyman's attempt to put a
student on the California
Postsecondary Education Com
mission was narrowly rejected
yesterday by the state Senate.
But the measure's floor
manager, Sen. Milton Marks
(R-San Francisco), said he
would ask for another vote next
week, despite opposition by the
Senate leader to taking second
votes on bills in the hectic last
days of the Legislature's 1984
session.
The bill, AB-3247 by As
semblyman Tom Hayden (D-
Santa Monica), failed on a 19-
10 vote, two short of the 21-
vote majority needed for ap
proval in the 40-seat upper
house. Several senators were
absent.
The bill would require the
governor to appoint a student
from a California college or uni
versity to the commission.
Under current law, the 15-
member commission includes
representatives of the Univer
sity of California Regents, Cali

fornia State University Trus
tees, Community College
Governors, the independent
colleges and universities, Coun
cil of Private Postsecondary
Educational Institutions, and
the state Board of Education.
There are also nine members
who represent the public.
None of the members is re
quired to be a student, although
some of the public representa
tives have been students.
Bill supporters said student
representatives have performed
well on other education boards
and should have a voice on the
Postsecondary Education Com
mission, which advises the
Legislature and governor on
policies affecting colleges and
universities.
Opponents said either that
students should not sit on any
education panels or that putting
a student on the Postsecondary
Education Commission would
be redundant, because students
now sit on many of the boards
represented on the commission.
