# Mondale says Republican plank is 'kook' document

### 
Minneapolis â€” Democratic presidential can
didate Walter Mondale considers the Republi
can platform a document of the "kook-right"
that would add $ 160 billion to the nation's def
icit, a campaign official said yesterday.
Dayton Duncan, Mondale's deputy press
secretary, outlining Mondale's views of the Re
publican convention, also said the Republicans
are concentrating on their 1980 policies and
"manuevering" for the 1988 elections, while
failing to discuss important issues of 1984. He
mentioned the deficit, arms control, education,
civil liberties and the environment.
The Republicans in Dallas have focused
more "on what they're against than what
they're for,'* Duncan said at a news briefing
here.
He said Mondale believes the Republican
platform is "shutting out" almost anyone
"short of the right wing" and that it is "clearly
skewed to" what Mondale calls "the kook
right."
Mondale has noted the convention's
"remarkable lack of minority representation"
and concluded that the platform is "not a
reflection of American attitudes. Duncan
said.
Mondale's harsh criticism of the Dallas con

vention marks the resumption of his campaign
offensive, which was stalled during the last two
weeks when the finances of his running mate,
Geraldine Ferraro, overshadowed his cam
paign message.
And the criticism indicates the line of attack
Mondale will use against President Reagan
during a rally today in Springfield, Illinois,
marking the first time Mondale will have cam
paigned against the Republicans' official
nominee.
During the briefing, campaign aides
portrayed the convention as dull. And Duncan
said that speeches castigating Mondale are an
indication to the former vice president that
Republicans are "bothered by" his candidacy.
Resuming Mondale's aggressive attack on
the tax issue. Duncan said: "It seems clear that
the Republican version of tax reform is more
tax breaks for Reagan's rich friends, more bur
dens on average Americans and even bigger
deficits.'"
Aides passed out papers titled "The Repub
lican promises and what they'll cost," asserting
that just six of the tax-cut proposals in the Re
publican platform would add $159.9 billion to
the federal deficit each year.
