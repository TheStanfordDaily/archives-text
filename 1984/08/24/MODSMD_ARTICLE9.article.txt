# COMMENTARY
## Editor's farewell 
### 
Shortly before midnight on Wednesday, July
11, the Associated Press reported that Walter
Mondale would select Rep. Geraldine Ferraro
as his running mate.
Flistory was about to be made, and the
thought that there would be no issue of The
Daily the next day to report it was distressing.
Within a few minutes, a ridiculous idea crys
tallized. We would publish a special extra edi
tion, and have it on the breakfast tables before
Mondale made his official announcement.
Some thought it foolish to waste time and
money on a special edition devoted to a non-
Stanford event. Others considered it logisti
cally impossible.
But despite those doubts, the response to
that impetuous decision was overwhelming.
Staffers left their homes after midnight and
rushed to Storke to help out.
Bob Cohn, Rod Searcey, Julie Ryan and
John Lis handled difficult tasks with profes
sional aplomb. Kelvin Davis and Larry Bosche
also provided spirited assistance. Most impor
tantly, Mike Hale, the only truly indispensable
member of the staff, made it all happen.
Thanks to their dedication, we pulled it off.
Our Ferraro edition included facts and details
that none of the major newspapers reported.
We showed that a student newspaper need
not confine itself to coverage of campus issues.
Whether it was the Olympics, the Democratic
Convention, or the University's dispute with
USW, The Daily provided a valuable perspec
tive on this summer's major events that was
different from the ones offered by the major
professional media.
We worked with a skeleton staff, made too

many avoidable mistakes ard spent too many
late nights in the office. But despite those
problems, we produced almost 400 pages of in
formative copy.
It couldn't have happened without hard
work from a number of people.
Thanks to Lisa for lending her talents for a
tinal volume and to Elaine for her continual
encouragement and her noble effort at master
ing unfamiliar territory. Additional kudos to
Kris for his devotion and good humor and to
Rod and the calendar man for their uncom
promising commitment to quality, if not for the
delays it caused.
John created a new department and
singlehandedly made it fly, Julie made good
use of limited resources, Doris and Mark pro
vided extremely graphic design, and Steve and
Bradley carried the back of the book.
Despite her gruff facade, Bev was always
helpful. Paul and Mike made those late nights
seem to go a little faster.
We had help from Daily alums far and near,
from Jeff Biddulph in Boston and Troy Eid in
D.C., to Adam Goodman and Kristen Christo
pher in Los Angeles and Bob Cohn, Tim Grieve
and Heather Millar in the Bay Area.
Finally, special thanks to Shirish for stepping
into the breach when we needed him and
making the last three issues of the summer the
easiest ones I (n)ever edited.
I began the summer as a relative stranger to
The Daily and its ways, but I end it with a deep
affection for this newspaper and its staff.
