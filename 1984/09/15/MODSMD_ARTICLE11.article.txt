# Cardinal secondary gets test against Illinois air attack today
## 
### IAN CUMMINGS 
"Inexperienced", "lacking in
speed", "an area of concern", "a
question mark" â€” name it, and
the Stanford Cardinal defensive
backs have been called it. Unless,
ihat is, you use words like
"dependable" or "talented".
The Cardinal secondary has
already received a season's worth
of maligning, and they've only sur
rendered 84 yards passing thus far.
Those yards, however, were given
up to Oklahoma, a team which at
tempted only 14 passes against the
Card last Saturday, completing six
of those.
Today Stanford faces Illiois, a
team as pass-happy as itself. The
Illini have attempted 75 passes in
their two games this season, and
quarterback Jack Trudeau, who is
already being touted as a Heisman
Trophy candidate around
Champaign-Urbana, has thrown
for 531 yards in Illinois' victories

over Northwestern and Missouri.
Stanford's ability to defend
against the pass will be tested for
the first time today, and many ob
servers have little faith in the
backs' ability to do their part.
Indeed, the secondary is inex
perienced. Right comerback Eric
Price, a four-year starter, is the
only one of the starting four with
much game time under his belt.
Sophomore Toi Cook, who played
primarily on special teams last
year, is at the other corner for
now, but Walt Harris is challeng
ing Cook for the starting position.
Sophomore Joe Cain, who saw
limited playing time at linebacker
in 1983, has moved into a starting
job at strong safety. The free
safety is Ed St. Geme, who,
despite being a fifth-year senior, is
probably the least experienced of
the starters.
Few are denying that the start
ing group is a little slower than the

typical defensive backfield, either.
Dick Mannini, defensive coordin
ator and secondary coach, says
they have "average speed at best".
Despite these apparent shortcom
ings, however, and despite what's
been written about them, the
backs remain very confident of
their capabilities.
"We don't worry about it," Cain
said. "To be a defensive back,
you've got to be confident. We
don't see ourselves as a weak link.
We don't worry about it, and we'll
just have to prove [ourselves]
come Saturday."
But what about the inexperi
ence?
"A lack of experience doesn't
necessarily correlate to a lack of
talent," Price pointed out.
And speed?
"Team speed doesn't mean any
thing," Cain responded. "I don't
care if everyone on the team can
