# Stanford offensive line has size, experience to get the job done

"Everyone talks about the big
linemen of Oklahoma and USC,
but we have a big offensive line
here at Stanford," insists Cardinal
left guard Matt Moran.
It is difficult to argue with the
fifth-year senior starter when you
look at the numbers — the Stan
ford line averages 6-foot-4, 265
pounds — but offensive line coach
Tony Yelovich knows it will take
more than size and strength to
compete with the teams which
Stanford has on its schedule this
year.
One of the more recent addi
tions to Head Coach Jack El way's
staff, Yelovich comes to the Farm
by way of Tulane University,
where he has coached for the past
four years. A former Little All-

America selection at Tampa who
emphasizes fundamentals,
Yelovich admits that the Cardinal
is nowhere near its playing poten
tial. "But we are only in the
second week of the season," he
explains. "So I cannot properly
evaluate the quality of our line."
By contrast, the players have no
such reservations about this year's
front five. "We're very confident
about our abilities," says Moran.
In fact, Stanford possesses one of
the most experienced offensive
fronts in the country, with only
one new face, right guard Scott
Carpenter, among the regulars.
Joining Carpenter and Moran in
the trenches will be seniors Jeff
Deaton and Brent Martin at left
tackle and center, respectively,
along with junior right tackle John

Barns.
The return of Deaton, an earth
science major, is a pleasant
surprise to Stanford coaches and
players alike. And if anyone is
more pleased than Moran, who
will team with Deaton for the third
straight season, it is Deaton him
self. "Deats was in Mobile, Ala
bama, practicing for the Senior
Bowl when he found out he would
be able to play another year for
Stanford," recalls Moran. "To put
it mildly, he was excited about the
prospect."
Former Cardinal Head Coach
Paul Wiggin called Deaton
"probably the best player on the
1983 team." After shedding 20
pounds in preparation for the
1984 campaign, a quicker Deaton

should be tougher than ever.
The responsibility of making the line calls

will fall upon the sturdy shoulders of Mar
tin, a nine-game starter at center a year
ago. Martin badly strained his right knee in
the Illinois game last year, but came back to
finish the season in impressive form.
The only non-senior among the starting

five, Barns seems ready for his second tour
of active duty. A Dallas native, Barns has
beefed up over the summer and looks to be
much improved for the 1984 season. J. 8.,
as his teammates call him, started nine of
the Cardinal's 11 games last fall.

Carpenter is an unknown factor, a senior
whose injuries have limited him to only 34
minutes of playing time during his Stanford
career. With senior Kevin Lamar close be
hind him on the depth chart, Carpenter
must either deliver or sit down once again.
