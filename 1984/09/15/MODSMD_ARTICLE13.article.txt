# Homecoming for Illini kicker
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Daily staff 
Chris White, Illinois' All-Big
Ten Conference placekicker and
the son of lllini Coach Mike
White, had a secret ambition
during his early years.
"When I was growing up,"
recalled White, a Bay Area
native, "I wanted to be in the
Stanford Band. Not in the band
actually, because I couldn't play
an instrument. 1 wanted to be the
bandleader."
Strange fantasy for a future
football star. Strange fantasy for
anyone, when you come right
down to it. But Chris White is not
a typical college football player,
no more than the Stanford Band
is a typical college band. For one
thing, in a sport where careers
usually begin at around the age of
9, White began kicking footballs
just three short years ago.
"I was more interested in bas
ketball than football in high
school," said White, who attend
ed Acalanes High School in
Lafayette before moving to Illi
nois for his senior year. He made
an all-star team as a guard at
Acalanes, impressing a Virginia
military academy enough to
receive a basketball scholarship
from that school following his
high school graduation.
It was at this military academy
that White's second, far more
successful, sports career received
its start. "I was just messing
around outside with a football
one day and I found out I could
kick it a long way." remembered
White.
That discovery, which was just
as simple as it sounds, became a
fascination for White. He began
to "mess around" with the foot
ball more frequently. When a

hole in the front of his sneaker
made it too painful to kick
straight-on, he began kicking the
ball soccer-style. And the balls
kept going farther and farther.
Next year, White decided to
take his shoe on the road, as it
were. After toying with the idea
of attending UCLA or Cal, White
settled on Illinois, where his fa
ther was burlding a Big Ten con
tender. When he told his father of
his intention to try out for the ll
lini team, the soon-to-be coach
thought it was a joke.
You can be sure that Mike
White is smiling now. After

spending his first year on the
junior varsity behind All-
America kicker Mike Bass, his
son beat out a high school All-
America recruit to earn the start
ing job — and a football scholar
ship — before the 1983 season.
In the first college field goal at
tempt of his career, against Mis
souri, White nailed one through
the uprights from 50 yards away.
He went on to hit 13 of 22 field
goals and 39 of 40 extra points on
the season, finishing with 78 total

points, second best in Illinois his
tory.
Not bad for a beginner. White
is indeed a beginner, however,
and he sees plenty of room for
improvement.
"I know my immaturity showed
through a few times last year,"
admitted White. "I had a terrible
game aginst Stanford, for in
stance. I'm trying to improve my
concentration this year, trying to
place the ball a little more."
White is eagerly anticipating
this afternoon's matchup with
Stanford, his first chance to strut
his stuff in the familiar surround
ings of the Bay Area. White lived
in the faculty housing on the
Stanford campus from 1964-71, a
time when father Mike was
spending what he has called
"eight of the greatest years of my
life" as an assistant coach with the
Indians.
From there, the White family
moved to Lafayette, where Mike
White spent 1972-79 as the head
coach at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley and an assis
tant coach with the San Francisco
49ers.
As a result, Chris White said,
"I'm going to have a bunch of
friends at the game. I've got a few
friends who go to Stanford, like
Jeff Arrillaga (a backup defensive
back for the Cardinal), and I
think some other people are
going to be coming up from
UCLA and Chico State for the
game. I'm really looking forward
to it."
With eight players on the Illi
nois squad from the Bay Area
and a total of 24 from California,
this afternoon's game will be the
"home opener" for a good num
ber of the Fighting Illini. Bay
Area natives now playing key
roles for Illinois include starting
quarterback Jack Trudeau and
starting wide receiver Randy
Grant (both from Granada High
School in Livermore), backup
quarterback Ken Cruz (San Fran
cisco St. Ignatius H.S.) and start
ing middle linebacker Mark
Tagart (San Jose Leland H.S.).
The strongest ties to Stanford,
however, belong to Chris White,
an improbable success as a col
lege football player. Just think
how different things might have
been if he had ever learned to
play trombone.

kept going farther and farther.
Next year, White decided to
take his shoe on the road, as it
were. After toying with the idea
of attending UCLA or Cal, White
settled on Illinois, where his fa
ther was burlding a Big Ten con
tender. When he told his father of
his intention to try out for the ll
lini team, the soon-to-be coach
thought it was a joke.
You can be sure that Mike
White is smiling now. After

spending his first year on the
junior varsity behind All-
America kicker Mike Bass, his
son beat out a high school All-
America recruit to earn the start
ing job — and a football scholar
ship — before the 1983 season.
In the first college field goal at
tempt of his career, against Mis
souri, White nailed one through
the uprights from 50 yards away.
He went on to hit 13 of 22 field
goals and 39 of 40 extra points on
the season, finishing with 78 total

points, second best in Illinois his
tory.
Not bad for a beginner. White
is indeed a beginner, however,
and he sees plenty of room for
improvement.
"I know my immaturity showed
through a few times last year,"
admitted White. "I had a terrible
game aginst Stanford, for in
stance. I'm trying to improve my
concentration this year, trying to
place the ball a little more."
White is eagerly anticipating
this afternoon's matchup with
Stanford, his first chance to strut
his stuff in the familiar surround
ings of the Bay Area. White lived
in the faculty housing on the
Stanford campus from 1964-71, a
time when father Mike was
spending what he has called
"eight of the greatest years of my
life" as an assistant coach with the
Indians.
From there, the White family
moved to Lafayette, where Mike
White spent 1972-79 as the head
coach at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley and an assis
tant coach with the San Francisco
49ers.
As a result, Chris White said,
"I'm going to have a bunch of
friends at the game. I've got a few
friends who go to Stanford, like
Jeff Arrillaga (a backup defensive
back for the Cardinal), and I
think some other people are
going to be coming up from
UCLA and Chico State for the
game. I'm really looking forward
to it."
With eight players on the Illi
nois squad from the Bay Area
and a total of 24 from California,
this afternoon's game will be the
"home opener" for a good num
ber of the Fighting Illini. Bay
Area natives now playing key
roles for Illinois include starting
quarterback Jack Trudeau and
starting wide receiver Randy
Grant (both from Granada High
School in Livermore), backup
quarterback Ken Cruz (San Fran
cisco St. Ignatius H.S.) and start
ing middle linebacker Mark
Tagart (San Jose Leland H.S.).
The strongest ties to Stanford,
however, belong to Chris White,
an improbable success as a col
lege football player. Just think
how different things might have
been if he had ever learned to
play trombone.
