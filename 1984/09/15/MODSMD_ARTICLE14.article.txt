# LSJUMB salutes beer; the alumni
## 
### 
Here they are, returning to
the comfortable confines of
Stanford Stadium for yet an
other home opener, those
merry masters of musical
madness, the one and only,
the truly incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior (pause) Uni
versity Marching Band.
What better way to open a
new season than with a salute
to that object of mass con
sumption beloved by alumni,
students, band and "Saturday
Night Live" coneheads alike?
For its pregame show, the
Band will devote its time to an
examination of beer.
First the Band will argue
the merits of Lite Beer. Is it
Less Filling? Does it Taste
Great? Or is it merely less ex
pensive, meaning that one can
drink more? Hopefully the
Band will be able to resolve
these eternal questions,
rapidly allowing it to move on
to the most common method
of carrying around large
amounts of beer at one time.
The Band forms a large, six
sided, metal cylinder with a
tap, claiming this is "All I
Ever Wanted". But the
LSJUMB realizes that, al
though moderate amounts of
beer have been shown to be
physically beneficial, "Just
Enough and Too Much" can

be harmful. This the Band will
illustrate in its third and
fourth formations, graphic
representations of the evils of
overconsumption.
The Band today is
composed of students who
have returned early, although
most of the student body has
not yet arrived on campus.
Thus, the LSJUMB will use its
halftime show in a tribute to
the Stanford alumni.
The Band will begin its
show with a traditional object
of Stanford obsession — the
Axe — and play "Come Join
the Band". Following this, the
Band will demonstrate a
reformed desire to achieve a
good GRADE for life as a
GRAD and play the "Scalp
Song".
In anticipation of life as a
"Son of the Stanford Red",
the Band will form symbols
representing the rewards of
being an alum. However,
there may be some drawbacks
to alumni life — the Band
worries about being forced to
wear red polyester pants in
loyalty to "My Old School".
Still, the joys of being an
ALUM outweigh this trifling
disadvantage, and the Band is
happy to watch "Old Folks
Boogie" at Stanford Stadium
as the Cardinal routs Illinois.
