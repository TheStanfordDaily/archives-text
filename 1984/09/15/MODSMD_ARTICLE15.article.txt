# Illinois sports psychologist calms players' nerves

es late in the fourth quarter. You're
down by a touchdown, but driving. It's third
and 10 on your opponent's 40 yard-line.
Or you're on the basketball court, and
just seconds remain in the game. Your team
is behind by a point and you've just been
fouled. You go to the free throw line to
shoot a pair of free throws.
What do you do?
If you're a varsity football or basketball
player at the University of Illinois, you
think light blue.
Such is the doing of Dan Smith, a full
time sports psycologist at Illinois and, he
says, the only full-time sports psychologist
at a major university.
Although he has been on the Illini
payroll for just over a year, Smith has set up
an extensive sports psychology program
that includes such things as conditioning
athletes to relax by thinking of the color
light blue.
Judging by statistics, Smith's program
seems to be working and working well. A
quick glance at the 1983 records of the Il
lini football and men's basketball teams —
the two with which Smith has spent the
most time — shows a combined mark of 36-
7, the best of any major university in the
country last year.
But as successful as his program may be
on paper, Smith refuses to take credit for
Ws and L's. "I'd hate sports psychology to
be based solely on win-loss records," he
says. "What makes me feel good is the indi
vidual progress of the athletes."

And as for the light blue bit, Smith says it
has been blown out of proportion. An Illini
quarterback once told a newspaperman
that he thought "light blue" to relax himself
and ease the anxiety of throwing a late
game interception.
"I started getting calls from high school
coaches asking me, 'If I paint my locker
room light blue, will my football team win
games?' " Smith said. "Actually, any color
can be used — light pink or whatever."
Smith uses a psycological methodology
that conditions a player's body to automati
cally relax whenever he thinks a certain
color — in this case, light blue.
Smith got his start helping athletes deal
with the frustrations of sports from his own
frustrations in, what else, sports. After a
celebrated volleyball career at the Brigham
Young University in Utah — one which in
cluded a year on the U.S. National team —
Smith coached basketball at the junior col
lege level in his home territory, Southern
California.
Smith then left for the Brigham Young-
Hawaii, where he assumed head basketball
coaching responsibities for three years.
And it was in Hawaii where his frustrations
finally surfaced.
"It frustrated me that on some nights my
players played better than on other nights,"
he recalled. "And it wasn't because of any
physical deficiencies." So Smith began to
investigate the psychological side of ath
letics. What he found amazed him.
"I realized 100 percent of a coach's time
was being spent on the physical side of bas
ketball and zero percent on the psychologi-

cal side. What happens to the kid who lacks
psychological skills? He may have all the
physical skills but not reach his full poten
tial because he lacked these (psychological
ones)."
Smith packed up and left BYU-Hawaii
for the University of Illinois — a place he
calls "just a little bit different weather
wise" — and Dr. Rainer Martens of the
Psychology Department. There he received
his Ph.D. and did his doctoral dissertation
on the basketball team while serving as its
graduate assistant.
After working with the basketball team
and aiding its players in coping with the
stress and anxiety created by late-game sit
uations, football coach Mike White asked
Smith to make a presentation to his team.
White was so impressed that he — and bas
ketball coach Lew Henson — encouraged
the Athletic Association (Illinois' equiva
lent of an athletic department) to create a
full-time post for a sports psychologist. On
June 9, 1983, Smith was hired.
Now every sport at Illinois involves his
psychological imagery program, but Smith
spends most of his time with the football
and men's basketball teams White's foot
ballers devoted a total of 600 hours to
sports psychology last season, one that saw
the Illini go 10-2 and earn a trip to the Rose
Bowl. This season, Smith predicts football
players will spend close to 1,000 hours in
large group, small group and one-on-one
sessions.
Although Smith doesn't claim success
simply based on statistics, he does throw
out a few awfully convincing numbers. For

example, Smith noticed that most basket
ball teams don't shoot as well in the last five
minutes of a close game (a 10-point game
or less) as they do in the rest of the game.
After the Illini basketball team used his
pyschological imagery program for a year,
it improved its late-game shooting 1.5
percentage points. And the second year the
dividends really paid off. The Illini's late
game field goal shooting improved six
percentage points.
Smith draws on similar "late-game" sta
tistics when it comes to the football team.
In one year under his program, the Illini
scored 4.5 times as many points as its oppo
nents in the fourth quarter compared to
only 2.3 times as many the year before. Illi
nois also improved its third down conver
sion rate from 33.7 to 45.8 percent in that
same year.
So what's the future of sports psychology
in college sports?
"I've had a few other universities ask me
to set up similar programs for them," Smith
said. "But the field of sports psychology in
the U.S. has been more at the research level
than at the applied level."
Smith credits the open-mindedness of
coaches White and Henson for giving his
program a shot at the major college level.
"Most college coaches in football and bas
ketball are so traditional that they don't
want to try something new."
Breaking tradition, then, is the first step
to nation-wide success of sports psychol
ogy. "I think that will take time," Smith
said. '"But once programs start working
across the nation, I think people will start
catching on."
