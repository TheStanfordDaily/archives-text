# Troubled Illini to face improved Cardinal
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Daily staff 
It's not often that a defending Big Ten
Conference champion is actually eager to
leave the familiar confines of its home
stadium and the delirious support of 75,000
backers to play a game on the road. But as
Illinois Coach Mike White admitted, he and
his Fighting Illini consider it a "blessing" to
be here on the Cardinal's home turf for this
afternoon's game against Stanford.
After the turbulent events of the last
eight months in Champaign, 111., one can
hardly blame White and his team for wan
ting to leave the scene of their accidents.
Only George Orwell could have predicted
the sort of troubles which have beset the Il
linois football program in 1984.
After finishing 1983 with a record
setting 10-1 regular season mark — includ
ing a 17-7 victory over Stanford in Cham
paign — the Illini were brought down to
earth by underdog UCLA in the Rose
Bowl. White said he and his team were
"totally embarrassed" by the shocking 45-9
defeat, and he apologized publicly to the
"thousands of people who we have disap
pointed."
Then, over the summer, the Illini learned
that Big Brother — a.k.a. the National Col
legiate Athletic Association — had indeed
been watching them and had not liked what
he had seen. The NCAA socked Illinois
with a one year probation for recruiting vi
olations, meaning that the Illini will be
unable to play in a bowl game this year or
appear on television in 1985. Several Big
Ten coaches have complained that this
punishment is no more than a slap on the
wrist, and have publicly called for White to
be fired.
Just as Illinois was adjusting to this set
back, a different version of Big Brother
came snooping around. In August, second
team All-America safety Craig Swoope was
arrested by undercover federal narcotics
agents for alleged cocaine trafficking, fur
ther damaging a defense which had lost
seven starters to graduation. After a
lengthy trial which saw numerous Illinois
players and coaches testifying in court,
Swoope was cleared of all charges. He will
suit up for this afternoon's game but will
not start.

And that's not all. Starting cornerback
Keith Taylor is lost for the season with a
neck injury. Scott Davis, picked as a start
ing defensive lineman, quit the team in the
preseason. Safety and team co-captain
David Edwards missed most of Illinois' first
two games with a hamstring injury, and
White announced Tuesday that starting de
fensive end Curtis Clarke is out for the
season with a wrist injury.
Understandably, the Illini's play has been
more than a little erratic so far this season.
Illinois had to come from behind to defeat
lowly Northwestern 24-16 in the season
opener on Sept. 1, and then the Illini very
nearly blew a 20-point fourth quarter lead
against Missouri, hanging on to win by a
score of 30-24.
"This year has been a tremendous drain
on all of us," admitted a beleaguered White
on Monday. "We're not a real solid team
right now because of the turmoil."
And that last fact is one major reason
why this matchup between a team which
went 10-2 last year *nd a team which
finished 1-10 could turn out to be a lot
closer than many people think. When the
two teams met last year, Illinois was on the
way up, while Stanford was headed for
troubled times. This year, the situation is
reversed, and, with a little luck, last year's
final score could be reversed as well.
The accuracy of this optomistic predic
tion will depend mostly on how much the
Stanford players learned from their 19-7
opening-game loss to Oklahoma last Satur
day. For the Cardinal to win, the following
questions will have to receive positive

"Against Illinois, we'll see as balanced
an attack as we'll see all year." - Stanford
Coach Jack Elway.
How right he was. Consider these
amazing Illinois statistics, encompassing
its first two games of the 1984 season.
Illinois quarterbacks Jack Trudeau
and Ken Cruz have handed off 74 times
and thrown the ball 75 times.
The Fighting Illini have scored three
of their touchdowns on the ground and
three of them through the air.

answers today:
•Can the Stanford offensive line give
sophomore quarterback John Paye enough
time to establish a solid passing game?
Stanford cannot win unless it can pass ef
fectively, as Oklahoma affirmed last week.
Under heavy pressure for most of the day,
Paye completed 21 of 40 passes for only
180 yards — most of that yardage coming
on Stanford's first and last possessions of
the game — and he was sacked three times.
While praising the tough Oklahoma
defense, new Stanford Coach Jack Elway
had some critical remarks for his offensive
line and his quarterback.
"We've got to gst more physical on the
offensive line," emphasized Elway. "When
you stick your helmet into a linebacker's
numbers ... it has a tendency to affect his
play."
Elway predicted that the Illini will at
tempt to shut down the Stanford pass attack
by shutting down Paye, coming after him
with a swarming pressure defense. To beat
this pressure the Cardinal offensive line
will have to contain the Illinois pass rush, a
rush anchored by Junior College All-
America defensive tackle Guy Teafatiller
and defensive tackle Steve Nelson, both of
whom have three sacks on the year.
In addition, Paye will have to do a better
job of finding his open receivers while un
der pressure. "Our tight ends (Greg Baty
and Dan Westerfield) are going to have to
cut loose a little more, and we're going to
have to start throwing to them when they're
open," Elway said.
•Can the inexperienced Stanford second-

Three different runners have rushed
for touchdowns; three different receivers
have caught touchdown passes.
The offense has given up one fumble
and one interception.
Not to be outdone, the defense has
recovered one fumble and picked off one
pass.
Of Illinois' 54 points, 27 of them have
been scored in the first half, and 27 have
been posted in the second half.
Eerie, isn't it?

ary handle the potent threat of Illinois
quarterback Jack Trudeau, one of the na
tion's top passers?
The Cardinal secondary, which features
cornerback Eric Price as its only returning
starter, wasn't really tested by the run
oriented Oklahoma team last week.
Today's game will let Coach Elway know
just how good — or bad — his pass defense
is.
Trudeau, who hails from nearby
Livermore, threw for 2,446 yards and 18
touchdowns in 1983, and he looks to be just
as tough this year. His favorite target
during the first two games of 1984 has been
wide receiver David Williams, a Los An
geles native who has caught 20 passes for
344 yards and one touchdown in the team's
victories over Northwestern and Missouri.
Price, a senior with no qualms about hard
hitting, claims he is "looking forward" to
the rematch against Trudeau, Williams and
company. If nothing else, expect to see
plenty of physical contact between the
Stanford secondary and the Illinois
receivers.
•Is Stanford really developing a running
attack?
Brian Morris' performance against Okla
homa — 13 carries for 63 yards — was en
couraging, but it came against a defense
which featured five and sometimes six de
fensive backs in a successful attempt to take
away the Stanford passing game. Elway ex
pects Illinois to keep only four defenders in
the secondary, meaning that Morris and his
running mates Kevin Scott and Thomas
Henley will be seeing fewer holes on tbe
line of scrimmage.
In last year's game against the Illini,
Stanford could manage only 44 yards rush
ing on 23 total carries against one of the na
tion's best rushing defenses. All four start
ing linemen and all three starting lineback
ers from that Illinois team have been lost to
graduation, however, so look for Elway to
send Morris, Scott and Henley into the ex
pected soft spots of the Illini front lines,
particularly the inexperienced left end posi
tion.
Sound like it's all too much too ask for?
Maybe. But remember, this is 1984. This is
the Illinois football team. Anything can
happen.



Today's game will feature two of the nation's premier passers in Stanford's up-and
coming sophomore |ohn Paye and Illinois' devastating junior Jack Trudeau. Paye hit on
21 of 40 passes for 180 yards last week. Trudeau r a Bay Area native, has completed 45 of
