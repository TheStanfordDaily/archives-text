# Cardinal must make changes after Oklahoma loss
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
The Stanford offense opened the 1984
season by marching 71 yards on nine plays
on the first drive of the year to take a 7-0
lead over No. 16-ranked Oklahoma. Split
end Emile Harry caught the first two passes
of the game for 37 yards, and quarterback
John Paye completed four of his first five
tosses.
Even when a 7-yard touchdown run by
Thomas Henley was called back on an ille
gal use of hands penalty, Paye came back
on the next play and found Greg Baty in the
end zone.
"I thought, 'Why do we have to get off
the field?' " Harry said about the drive. His
feelings were understandable. That series
may be the only time this year he will see
single coverage. Oklahoma gave corner
back Andre Johnson the unenviable task of
trying to cover Harry one-on-one, and
Harry had no trouble getting open.
The Sooner coaches soon realized they
would have to change their defensive plan.
"On outs they dropped off a linebacker or
the strong safety," Harry said, "and they
took away everything but the shcrt passes
to our backs."
"They started out in an odd front," Head
Coach Jack El way said, "but they started
going with five or six defensive backs. Their
defensive backs attacked upfield real well."
Harry elaborated, "They were playing a
zone about 10 yards deep, then they'd
come up and bump us right at the point
where we were trying to make our breaks."
"They made an adjustment and started
to double-team both wideouts," Elway
added, "so we had to find something inside
to our tight ends and backs. It was there —
I guess I'll have to do a better job of finding
something that works."
The Cardinal didn't find anything that
worked again until the fourth quarter, when
Paye began to find halfback Thomas Hen
ley over the middle as the clock wound
down. "Part of it was that it was late in the
game," Paye said, referring to the defense's
tendency to watch for deep sideline routes
near the end of the game, "but they were
also trying to cover him one-on-one with a
linebacker."
The Card drove to the Oklahoma 3 yard
line when time ran out, with the final score
Oklahoma 19, Stanford 7. The fourth quar
ter play of Henley was particularly encour

aging, as the sophomore halfback finished
with six catches for 53 yards, a couple of
which came despite jarring collisions with
Sooner defenders.
Another thorn in the Cardinal side last
week was the play of the Oklahoma defen
sive ends, All-American Kevin Murphy and
Darrell Reed. Paye said, "They started
pinching down with their outside lineback
ers" — a defensive end in Oklahoma's 5-2
defense is virtually the same as an outside
linebacker in Stanford's 3-4 defense —
"and they threw us off."

"I was impressed by their No. 39
(Murphy)," Paye said. "For the first drive I
was getting time to throw, but then they
started bringing 39."
Murohy and Reed caused trouble for
Paye and the offensive blocking up front,
either coming after Paye or dropping off
into flat coverage. Murphy finished with
five tackles and broke up three passes,
while Reed had six tackles and sacked Paye
once.
Offensively this week, Stanford will have
to show that it has receivers other that

Harry, who will likely be double-covered
most of the time, and throw effectively to
the backs and tight ends if the wideouts are
covered. Brian Morris, who rushed for 63
yards last week, may be the answer to the
problems the Cardinal had last year run
ning the ball.
The Cardinal offensive line will also need
to give Paye time to throw today. Illinois
plays a 4-3 defense, which should eliminate
some problems encountered last week
against the 5-2.
On defense, Stanford had trouble stop
ping the running of Sooner quarterback
Danny Bradley, who rushed for 100 yards
and one touchdown last week. Bradley
gained 96 of those yards in the first half, but
was held to just four yards on 12 carries in
the second half.
The difference was due 10 a change made
at halftime in the routes of the Stanford
outside linebackers, Tom Briehl and Tom
Prukop. On an option in the 3-4 defense,
the outside linebackers must stop the quar
terback, while the cornerbacks come up to
play the pitch.
"In the first half we were trying to get up
field," Prukop said, which enabled Bradley
to get outside. "In the second half we
played outside more," he said, and by
looping outside, the Card defense shut
down Bradley and allowed the Sooners
only 93 yards rushing in the second half.
The Stanford defense has shown that it
can play tough against the run, but the pass
defense has yet to be tested. Bradley will
never make the NFL as a passer, and he
completed only six of 14 for 84 yards.
Elway said, "We did a good job on
defense against the run, but we'll have a
different problem next week." Illinois is a
good passing team, and it remains to be
seen whether the Cardinal's inexperienced
secondary can do the job against the pass.
