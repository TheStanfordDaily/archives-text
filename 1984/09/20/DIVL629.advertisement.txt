AUT, WIN, SPR MWF 1:15-2:05
FULFILLS AREA 6, 7, 8 DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
This sequence is intended for undergraduates not majoring in engineering, the natural sciences, or
mathematics. It seeks to convey a better understanding of the character and interrelationships of
technology, mathematics and science, enhance ability to think quantitatively, and build confidence
and skills necessary to treat quantitative questions that confront people intending to comprehend
and influence contemporary society. It will cover a large amount of material and move rapidly.
Lectures and assignments will build understanding of concepts and styles of thinking rather than
developing the type of skills needed by the practitioner.
During academic year 84/85 the class size will be limited and students enrolling will be required to
take the entire sequence in order. This is because the instructors desire an unusually high level of
student feedback during the first year. Additional information on the sequence is available either
from the instructors, or in the V.T.S.S. program office in building 370.
