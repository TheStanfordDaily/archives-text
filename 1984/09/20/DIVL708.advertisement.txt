Kodak MP film... Eastman
Kodak's professional color motion
picture (MP) film now adapted for
still use in 35mm cameras by
Seattle Film Works. Its micro-fine
grain and rich color saturation
meet the movie industry's exacting
standards. And with wide exposure
latitude, you don't have to be a pro
to get great everyday shots or
capmre special effects. Shoot in
low or bright light from 200 ASA
up to 1200 ASA (with our high
speed 5294® film). Get prints or
slides, or both, from the same roll.
