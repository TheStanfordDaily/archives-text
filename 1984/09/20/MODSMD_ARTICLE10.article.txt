You made it successfully through the admissions
process months ago. But over the summer, your vital sta
tistics were being scrutinized yet another time — during
your roommate pairing.
No, despite all the rumors to the contrary, they don't
pair freshmen roommates by height, by hometowns, fam
ily size or music preference.
"It's all a value judgment," said Eric Lansverk, one of
the two freshman coordinators last year who handled the
"roommating." "But we don't have any set criteria be
cause people don't really fit into a set mold, especially
when the only information you have about them is con
densed onto a little white (housing) card."
For the sake of generalization, you can count on a few
standards in selection:
• If you're from California, your roommate will not be
from California.
• If you're from out of state, there's a pretty good chance
your roommate will be from California since such a large
percentage of the class is from the state.
• You will share some common interest with your
roommate.
• You won't know who your roommate is until the day
you arrive because changes are made down to the last
minute.
The roommating — which is done in about a week — is
handled by two upperclassmen who work closely with the
Office of Admissions, the office of Residential Education
(Res Ed), and the Academic Information Center.

Much in the style of the Admissions Office, the two co
ordinators pursue a goal of "diversity but compatability"
in making roommate decisions. The coordinators try to
make the system a personal one.
Said Lansverk, "I've had fathers call me and say, 'I'm
so glad that my son won't be a number like my other son
was at Harvard."
According to administrators, the personal touch is
more a question of style than of anything else. "There is
some feeling that random processes work just as well as
the hand-picked process," said Roger Whitney of the
Housing Office. "But that's not the way we do it here at
Stanford."
Despite the effort to be personal, many of the choices
are already made for the coordinators: The Housing Of
fice gives them a "freshman configuration" which
determines how many freshmen will be will be in each
dorm, sometimes even down to the rooms reserved for
freshmen.
To the extent that the freshman configuation allows, in
dividual preferences and requests to be involved in special
programs are accommodated first. Then the creative, and
subjective, part of the process begins.
"We put people into dorms first off," said Allison
Hardy, one of last year's freshman coordinators. "From
there we just do our best to fill their preferences. I guess
after a while that people just start looking like they should
be roommated. We look for a common ground, some
thing they can share. . but obviously you don't want to
put clones together."
