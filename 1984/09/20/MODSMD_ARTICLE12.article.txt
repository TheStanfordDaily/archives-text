# Bechtel International Center
## I-Center provides Farm foreign flair 
### JOSEPH FIRSCHEIN 
It may be easy for new students to
cycle past the white stucco walls and
French windows of the Bechtel Inter
national Center without realizing the
wealth of information inside. But the
I-Center, located at the intersection
of Mayfield Avenue and Lomita
Drive, is well worth a visit.
Entering the center, one is immedi
ately engulfed in an international en
vironment. Many foreign languages
can be heard as people converse in
the elegant lounge. Foreign and
American students, spouses and pro
fessors meet for coffee and dessert at
Cafe Al Fresco. Students share cul
tural differences at a post-lecture dis
cussion.
Aside from the social programs,
the center serves an important educa
tional role. A full-time staff and vol
unteers provide counseling services to
foreign students and scholars, helping
them with all immediate needs such
as buying a bicycle or used car or get
ting the proper license and insurance.
Another major program at the center
is orientation for foreign graduate
students, preparing them with a num
ber of tours and information sessions
about daily life at Stanford.
While the center enables foreign
students and scholars to receive the
most from their stay in the United
States, I-Center Director Lee Zeigler
says it is also valuable for U.S. stu
dents. "It is important to encourage

American students who have an in
terest in international activities to get
acquainted with the I-Center and
become involved, whether to make
travel plans or to practice another
language or to form friendships with
people from other countries."
The center has an Overseas
Resource Center (ORC) on the second
floor which houses information on
study abroad programs, international
travel, employment abroad and inter
national scholarships. The center also
contains many resources on travel in
the United States.
According to Zeigler, the learning
that takes place at the center works
both ways. "We are enriched by
being with foreign students and learn
ing what their values and lifestyles are
all about."
Zeigler said that working at the
center has its rewards because the
visiting students are so bright. "They
are the future leaders in their fields.
Those foreign students that decide to
stay in the United States contribute to
our country."
The International Center is open
daily to students and the Stanford
community. There are informal Eng
lish classes, discussion groups on
topics of international interest,
lectures and forums, monthly art ex
hibitions and excursions. Specific
schedules of events are listed in The
Daily's "Once Around the Quad"
section.
