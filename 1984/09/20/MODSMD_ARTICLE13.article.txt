## And Leland said/Let there be University,' and it was good 
### 
When David Starr Jordan arrived
at Stanford in the summer of 1891 to
be the University's first president, he
found the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "extends
southward 50 miles and more from
near the head of San Francisco Bay.
Bounding it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty
camp of mountains pitched tumultu
ously' ....
"Immediately behind the Univer
sity estate and forming its higher
background is the wooded Sierra
Morena, its cloak of redwood, oak
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal ....
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches the
long, relatively barren and treeless
Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles

south of San Francisco, its favorable
climate assured by its situation bet
ween bay and ocean, its meadows
patterned with ancient oaks, Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford established
their university on the site of their
suburban home, Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subsequent
purchases ran the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land
was given to the University in the
1885 Grant of Endowment with the
stipulation that it should never be
sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, president of
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy, and the prominent landscape ar
chitect, Frederick Law Olmsted, in
the summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to

locating the campus in the foothills of
the ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the bay, but
they finally decided to drive in a stake

Reconstruction after the earthquake
of April 18, 1906, cost more than $2
million. Classes were dismissed until
fall, and seniors were voted their
degrees in May.

in the grainfields below, at a point
that marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later ex
pansion.

Olmsted worked out the general
concept for the grounds and the
buildings, but it remained tor the
young Boston architect, Charles Al

lerton Coolidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late mentor,
Henry Hobbs Richardson, considered
the most eminent architect of his
time.

The style is called Richardsonian
Romanesque, and it follows the
European Romanesque, which is
characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short columns
with decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place re
served for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall ior men and
Roble Hall for women, were ready for
the University's opening on October
1. 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Dr. Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part in the
students' training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White of

Cornell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful college
architecture in America.
But just before five on the morning
of April 18, 1906, the ground be
neath Stanford's new buildings shook
for 45 seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and caused
millions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower, with
its clocks, chimes and spire, crashed
into the chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out the front
wall. The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon on
the Mount that had graced the facade
lay as rubble in the Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central struc
ture of the Outer Quad — 100 feet
high and decorated with a frieze de
picting the march of civilization —
was damaged beyond repair. So were
a library and gymnasium that were
just short of completion. None of
these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than $2
million. Classes were dismissed until
the fall. Seniors in what has come to
be known as "The Earthquake Class"
were voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a tem
porary one, for the young university
quickly rebuilt, pursuing a construc
tion project that was begun in 1886
and that has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken place
on approximately 5000 acres re
served by the Board of Trustees for
educational uses. This is the heartland
of the Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to the
back boundary in the foothills.
The areas designated for light lie in
open land, including the arboretum,
golf course and the foothill lands used
for space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and biologi
cal sciences.
The inner and outer quads occupy
17 acres at the heart of the academic
area. The Inner Quad's 12 classroom
buildings, two of which are now used
by the president and his staff, date
from the time the University opened
in 1891, while the Outer Quad was
completed in 1903, the same year
that Memorial Church was dedicated.
Buildings in the Outer Quad are
being brought up to earthquake
proof standards by an "inside-out"

process of construction to preserve
the sandstone exterior.
The church represents the Stan
fords' deep religious faith, though
they were followers of no particular
denomination. In the Founding
Grant, they directed the trustees "to
have taught in the University the im
mortality of the soul, the existence of
an all-wise and benevolent Creator,
and that obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of the
campus community, they decreed that
the church and the University were to
be nonsectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the original plans, the central
site now occupied by the church was
reserved for it, though construction
was deferred. When Senator Stanford
died in 1893, his widow determined
that the church would be built as a
memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final de
signs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining papal
permission to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that cover
the interior walls are largely Old
Testament, depicting the history of
redemption. The largest mosaic, how
ever, occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 figures, de
picts the Sermon on the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906, the
structure was completely dismantled
and rebuilt around a steel framework.
Another set of mosaics was brought
from Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.



The Earthquake of 1906 did severe damage to the relatively new Stanford
campus. Last spring's quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale did little

damage to the University, although it reminded students of the constant
threat of the "Big One."
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at the
University's 50th anniversary in
1941. The tower and the adjoining
Lou Henry Hoover Building (opened
in 1967) house the vast documentary
collections of the Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution and Peace —
millions of items that include books,
documents, files, manuscripts, diaries,
pamphlets, posters, maps and photos.
The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in 1978, honors
the former president's humanitarian
works.
Herbert Hoover started the library
collection during World War I when
he headed the Commission for Relief
in Belgium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him in a
position to document the war,
Hoover shipped crates of material to
the library at Stanford, his alma
mater, and laid the literary founda
tion of the Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this institution
is to promote peace. Its records stand
as a challenge to those who promote
war. They should attract those who
search for peace."
The Institution has more material
on communism than can be found
anywhere outside Russia. It has more
data on Mussolini than can be found
in Italy. It also probably has the most
complete record on Hitler and the
Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the institu
tion serves as a center for advanced
study and research on problems of so

cial, political and economic change in
the 20th century.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall (Auditorium), dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily through
student contributions as a memorial
to Stanford students and faculty slain
in World War I, the auditorium also
contains in the foyer plaques honor
ing the Stanford dead of World War
11. The main auditorium seats 1700
and the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000 square
foot landscaped area donated to the
University by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons. The
focal point of the plaza is a tall,
free-form fountain executed in
bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore, post
office, Tresidder Memorial Union,
the music building and the Old Union
— which contains several student ser
vices — the plaza is a campus cros
sroads.
The Stanford School of Medicine
moved from San Francisco into its
quarters in 1959. The $21 million
structure consists of three sections —
the hospital, the outpatient clinics and
the teaching laboratories and clas
srooms.
The Stanford Law School has been
housed in Crown Quadrangle since
September 1975, when President
Gerald Ford dedicated the $11.9
million facility. The school resides in
four buildings: the Robert Crown Li
brary, which can seat the entire law
student body at the same time; Fre
derick I. Richman Hall, which con
tains the classrooms and moot court;
the James Irvine Gallery, which con
tains the faculty and student meeting
rooms and lounges; and 600-person

Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
Rising steeply from Searsville Lake,
the 735-acre preserve contains a un
ique association of rock ledges and
outcroppings, oak-dotted savannahs,
chaparral, redwoods, streams and
pools. The preserve is used regularly
for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory con
ducts at its antenna farm one of the
most productive and varied programs
of ionospheric and interplanetary
radio investigation. Its scientists made
the first radar contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the anten
nae, the 70-ton, 150-foot diameter
steel and aluminum "Dish," has
explored the sun, planets and in
terplanetary gases by means of a
radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) operates a two
mile-long atom smasher on 460 acres
along Sand Hill Road. The $114
million machine, financed by the
Atomic Energy Commission and
completed in 1966, fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube rather
than whirling protons in circles, as
most atom smashers do. The machine
develops an energy of 20 billion elec
tron volts.
In the last 20 years, the University
has raised some $325 million to pay
for new campus facilities and im
provements, including campus land
marks such as Maples Pavilion,
Meyer Library, the Green Library
annex, the Terman Engineering
Center and the Mudd chemistry
building.


Although they're not wearing blue jeans and Izod shirts, these Stanford students from the early years of the
University were undoubtedly sharp dressers for their time. If you should see any of these people on
campus, it's probably because they stopped out for a couple of decadcs to study overseas.
