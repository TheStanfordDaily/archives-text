# Tips for four safe years of Stanford life
## 
### 
Thefts, assaults and burglaries
can become an unfortunate part of
your Stanford experience â€” if
you're not careful.
But a new publication from the
Special Services Unit of Stanford's
Department of Public safety aims
to change all that.
The "Stanford Farm Almanac" is
a compilation of previous publica
tions dealing with safety and se
curity. Compiled by the students
who make up the Special Services
Unit, the almanac contains infor
mation on dialing 911 for emer
gencies, using safety services like
SURE escorts, engraving your
valuables in order to deter theft,
and securing your room before
heading home for vacation.
Designed to be kept near the
telephone for quick reference, the
almanac is available in dorm
offices and from kAs in row
houses. Off campus students can
pick up copies at Old Union,
Meyer and Green Libraries, or the
Tresidder Information Desk.
For more information on safety
and security at Stanford, call the
Special Services Unit at 497-9633.
