Ever wonder how many bricks there are in Meyer Li
brary? Or how many showers in Branner Hall?
These and other questions are answered on student-led
campus tours, originating at the information booth at the

front of the Quad Monday
through Sunday at 11 a.m.
and 2:15 p.m.
Hosea Belcher, student
d.rector of the Guide and
Visitors Service, says the
tour guide business is excit
ing.
"It gives you a chance to
interact with all types of
people — prospective stu
dents, cheerleaders, football
players, alumni. You meet
VIPs like President Carter
and the British ambassador.
You never know who is
going to show up at
Hoover," he said.
Junior tour guide Donna
Clark agreed. "You get to
meet different people from
all over the world. You tell
them about Stanford, and
they tell you all about their
culture," she said.
"It's amazing how popular
Stanford is. You don't
realize its importance within
California, but people come

from overseas and all over the country just to see Stan
ford," she said.
According to Belcher, the most common question
asked is, "Where's the bathroom?" But adult visitors also
ask about admissions and financial aid.

"Students tend to ask more questions about social life,
athletics and the weather," Belcher said. "Visitors, im
pressed by the weather and beauty of the campus, ask me,
How could you go to school here, and study at the same
time?' I tell them I don't."

According to Clark,
visitors are most impressed
by Memorial Church and en
joy being "in the heart of
things" in White Plaza.
The tour also includes
visits to the School of Engi
neering, Bowman Alumni
House, Tresidder Union and
Hoover Tower.
Belcher, a four-year tour
guide veteran, said he has
grown from his tour guide
experience. "It's a great op
portunity for a person. You
have to be personal but give
the facts — you can't be shy.
I've grown more confident as
a speaker."
Students who are consid
ering attending the Univer
sity often take a tour to help
them make their decisions.
"Prospective students on
my tours come up to me later
and say, 'You really helped
me a lot. . . that's why I
decided to come.' That really
makes you feel good," Bel

cher said.
And the qualifications needed to be a tour guide?
"You really have to love Stanford to be a guide, and
share with others how great a place it is to go to school,"
Belcher said.
