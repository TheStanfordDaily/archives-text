# For the best seat in the house: your local cinemas

### 
Stanford is something of a movie
buffs paradise. At the best of times,
there are seven or eight film series
operating simultaneously on campus,
as well as a colorful selection of
revivals at the two downtown revival
houses, the New Varsity and the Fes
tival, and first-run foreign and
domestic pictures on 15 screens in
eight local theaters. Newly arrived
movie addicts will find their needs
tended to in the following locations.
ON CAMPUS
ASSU Sunday Flicks: This is the most
popular film series on campus — not
because it is assembled with espe
cially good taste, but because it in
cludes very recent releases and pro
vides a party-like atmosphere akin to
that of midnight screenings of The
Rocky Horror Picture Show. Most
people have a great time, though
those who prefer to see the screen be
hind the barrage of paper planes and
hear the soundtrack over the gleefully
improvised commentary may seek
elsewhere. Among last year's films
were 48 Hours, Risky Business. and
The Big Chill. Because the Sunday
Flicks draw such a large crowd, they
screen twice in Memorial Auditorium
(on Sunday evenings, of course).
Stanford Film Society: Though this
series is run by a small, dedicated
group of undergraduates, it is drawn
up in connection with the Film Aes
thetics and Film History courses of
fered in the Communication Depart
ment in the fall and winter,
respectively (Occasionally there will
be a spring series as well, but that is
rare.) Attendance is compulsory for

students enrolled in these courses,
but the movies—a highly varied
mixture of American and foreign
films, silents and talkies — are open
to everyone. These pictures are al
most always terrific. They screen
Monday evenings in Kresge
Auditorium.
German Film Series: Sponsored by
Haus Mitteleuropa, where they are
shown, these movies cover a wide
spectrum of German film. Classics
like M and Metropolis often pop up,
as well as examples of contemporary
German cinema and relatively
obscure entries like the film of Faust
starring Gustav Grundgens, the actor
on whose story Mephisto was based.
Thursday evenings.
Law School Film Society: Like the
publicity surrounding this series, the
choice of movies varies greatly accor
ding to who is in charge of it from
term to term. It's generally an
agreeable, nostalgic collection of
Hollywood classics like Little Women,
The Big Sleep and Roman Holiday,
and it draws affectionate, fairly quiet
audiences. Friday nights in Kresge
Auditorium.
Great Directors Film Series: The most
esoteric movies in town — this is a se
ries for diehard cinephiles. Again, the
selection depends on the tastes of the
two or three people who operate it,
but the emphasis is generally placed
on foreign films, particularly by
highly experimental directors whose
work would be unlikely to turn up
even in most revival theaters.

Chaparral Film Series: The Chaparral
supports itself largely through these
movies, so the list always includes a
number of sure-fire successes
(Woody Allen, Monty Python and
James Bond movies, for example).
And it emphasizes comedy, because
that, after all, is the Chaparral"s busi
ness. Because of the balance between
recent and older releases, the selec
tion of films is usually fairly decent,
and it includes a few really pleasant
surprises. Saturday evenings in
Kresge Auditorium.
Others: As well, Casa Italiana and La
Maison Francaise generally col
laborate on a French-Italian film se
ries at least one quarter every year. A
Japanese film series may also be of
fered. These always prove to be trea
sure troves for movie lovers with non
conformist tastes. Then there is the
usual smattering of dorm-sponsored
movies, movies associated with spe
cial events — one-shot deals — and
foreign (often Third World) films
shown by the Bechtel International
Center.
OFF CAMPUS
New Varsity: Located on University
Avenue between Waverly and Cow
per Streets, the New Varsity is a
nearly ideal repertory cinema.
Double bills (and occasionally triple
bills) change every day or two, and
they offer not only recent films (often
hot off the first-run screens) but also
American and foreign classics, some
not often revived. If a relatively un
publicized movie opens in San Fran
cisco and fails to show up first-run in
Palo Alto, chances are it will surface
at the New Varsity within six or eight

months. The seats are slightly rickety
and uncomfortable, but the Varsity's
patrons don't seem to mind very
much. The building also houses an
indoor-outdoor cafe-restaurant
where locals often gather in the even
ing for coffee, dessert and live music
in the courtyard. Warning: On Friday
nights the Varsity is a hangout for
teenagers — a responsive but per
haps overly vocal audience for the
movies the management has lately (in
the past year) provided to cater to
high school audiences.
Festival: Just behind the Varsity, on
Hamilton Avenue just west of Cow
per Street, is the Festival Theatre,
which shows one double bill a week.
(The movies change on Thursday.)
It's much smaller than the Var
sity — intimate, but very cozy, with
overstuffed seats and enormous pil
lows on the floor just in front of the
screen. Almost all the features are
Hollywood movies from the 1930s
and '40s (there's a British double bill
every six weeks or so), which are a
treat to see again on a big screen even
if you've already caught them on TV.
Aquarius: The Aquarius, on Emerson
between University and Lytton, has
two small cinemas that show mostly
foreign films, with the occasional
"small" American feature like Chilly
Scenes of Winter or A ngelo, My Love.
Since it is one of Palo Alto's major
claims to culture, it is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Saturday
nights; the Palo Alto moviegoing
crowd tends to adopt certain movies
that open at the Aquarius — El Norte
or Carmen — and keeps them playing
there for months. It's your basic
(essential) university theater, and

though its films are (of course) of
highly variable quality, the manage
ment has never compromised its deci
sion to show only arthouse selections.
Bijou: For years the Aquarius
Cinemas owned the Bijou — a small
cinema just down the street, on
Emerson between Hamilton and For

est — but last December new owners
converted it into a revival house dedi
cated (we were repeatedly told) to
showing unusual movies, domestic
and foreign that don't often appear
on local screens. And the first
schedule contained dozens of such
