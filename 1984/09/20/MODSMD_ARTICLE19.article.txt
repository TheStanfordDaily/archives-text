# For the best seat in the house: your local cinemas

### 
Stanford is something of a movie
buffs paradise. At the best of times,
there are seven or eight film series
operating simultaneously on campus,
as well as a colorful selection of
revivals at the two downtown revival
houses, the New Varsity and the Fes
tival, and first-run foreign and
domestic pictures on 15 screens in
eight local theaters. Newly arrived
movie addicts will find their needs
tended to in the following locations.
ON CAMPUS
ASSU Sunday Flicks: This is the most
popular film series on campus — not
because it is assembled with espe
cially good taste, but because it in
cludes very recent releases and pro
vides a party-like atmosphere akin to
that of midnight screenings of The
Rocky Horror Picture Show. Most
people have a great time, though
those who prefer to see the screen be
hind the barrage of paper planes and
hear the soundtrack over the gleefully
improvised commentary may seek
elsewhere. Among last year's films
were 48 Hours, Risky Business. and
The Big Chill. Because the Sunday
Flicks draw such a large crowd, they
screen twice in Memorial Auditorium
(on Sunday evenings, of course).
Stanford Film Society: Though this
series is run by a small, dedicated
group of undergraduates, it is drawn
up in connection with the Film Aes
thetics and Film History courses of
fered in the Communication Depart
ment in the fall and winter,
respectively (Occasionally there will
be a spring series as well, but that is
rare.) Attendance is compulsory for

students enrolled in these courses,
but the movies—a highly varied
mixture of American and foreign
films, silents and talkies — are open
to everyone. These pictures are al
most always terrific. They screen
Monday evenings in Kresge
Auditorium.
German Film Series: Sponsored by
Haus Mitteleuropa, where they are
shown, these movies cover a wide
spectrum of German film. Classics
like M and Metropolis often pop up,
as well as examples of contemporary
German cinema and relatively
obscure entries like the film of Faust
starring Gustav Grundgens, the actor
on whose story Mephisto was based.
Thursday evenings.
Law School Film Society: Like the
publicity surrounding this series, the
choice of movies varies greatly accor
ding to who is in charge of it from
term to term. It's generally an
agreeable, nostalgic collection of
Hollywood classics like Little Women,
The Big Sleep and Roman Holiday,
and it draws affectionate, fairly quiet
audiences. Friday nights in Kresge
Auditorium.
Great Directors Film Series: The most
esoteric movies in town — this is a se
ries for diehard cinephiles. Again, the
selection depends on the tastes of the
two or three people who operate it,
but the emphasis is generally placed
on foreign films, particularly by
highly experimental directors whose
work would be unlikely to turn up
even in most revival theaters.

Chaparral Film Series: The Chaparral
supports itself largely through these
movies, so the list always includes a
number of sure-fire successes
(Woody Allen, Monty Python and
James Bond movies, for example).
And it emphasizes comedy, because
that, after all, is the Chaparral"s busi
ness. Because of the balance between
recent and older releases, the selec
tion of films is usually fairly decent,
and it includes a few really pleasant
surprises. Saturday evenings in
Kresge Auditorium.
Others: As well, Casa Italiana and La
Maison Francaise generally col
laborate on a French-Italian film se
ries at least one quarter every year. A
Japanese film series may also be of
fered. These always prove to be trea
sure troves for movie lovers with non
conformist tastes. Then there is the
usual smattering of dorm-sponsored
movies, movies associated with spe
cial events — one-shot deals — and
foreign (often Third World) films
shown by the Bechtel International
Center.
OFF CAMPUS
New Varsity: Located on University
Avenue between Waverly and Cow
per Streets, the New Varsity is a
nearly ideal repertory cinema.
Double bills (and occasionally triple
bills) change every day or two, and
they offer not only recent films (often
hot off the first-run screens) but also
American and foreign classics, some
not often revived. If a relatively un
publicized movie opens in San Fran
cisco and fails to show up first-run in
Palo Alto, chances are it will surface
at the New Varsity within six or eight

months. The seats are slightly rickety
and uncomfortable, but the Varsity's
patrons don't seem to mind very
much. The building also houses an
indoor-outdoor cafe-restaurant
where locals often gather in the even
ing for coffee, dessert and live music
in the courtyard. Warning: On Friday
nights the Varsity is a hangout for
teenagers — a responsive but per
haps overly vocal audience for the
movies the management has lately (in
the past year) provided to cater to
high school audiences.
Festival: Just behind the Varsity, on
Hamilton Avenue just west of Cow
per Street, is the Festival Theatre,
which shows one double bill a week.
(The movies change on Thursday.)
It's much smaller than the Var
sity — intimate, but very cozy, with
overstuffed seats and enormous pil
lows on the floor just in front of the
screen. Almost all the features are
Hollywood movies from the 1930s
and '40s (there's a British double bill
every six weeks or so), which are a
treat to see again on a big screen even
if you've already caught them on TV.
Aquarius: The Aquarius, on Emerson
between University and Lytton, has
two small cinemas that show mostly
foreign films, with the occasional
"small" American feature like Chilly
Scenes of Winter or A ngelo, My Love.
Since it is one of Palo Alto's major
claims to culture, it is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Saturday
nights; the Palo Alto moviegoing
crowd tends to adopt certain movies
that open at the Aquarius — El Norte
or Carmen — and keeps them playing
there for months. It's your basic
(essential) university theater, and

though its films are (of course) of
highly variable quality, the manage
ment has never compromised its deci
sion to show only arthouse selections.
Bijou: For years the Aquarius
Cinemas owned the Bijou — a small
cinema just down the street, on
Emerson between Hamilton and For

est — but last December new owners
converted it into a revival house dedi
cated (we were repeatedly told) to
showing unusual movies, domestic
and foreign that don't often appear
on local screens. And the first
schedule contained dozens of such

films — it was a movie buffs
paradise, until the management
decided it couldn't make money that
way. Each subsequent schedule has
been less interesting than the last, and
at the moment, except for the weekly
foreign film evening, it's a poor man's
New Varsity — and once a week or
so it turns into a nightclub, giving
over its space to a stand-up comic.
(It's a schizophrenic moviehouse.)
But no matter who or what is playing
on any night at the Bijou, you can be
sure you'll hear the owner, Bob
Stern, make his opening speech to the
audience.
Fine Arts On California Avenue, just
east of El Camino — in the midst of
the nicest commercial area in Palo
Alto, the Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater, known in the past for grab
bing hold of movies it could show for
months and months — like An Offi
cer and a Gentleman or Gandhi.
Lately the turnover has been more
rapid. The management of the
theater, it should be noted, is not es
pecially nice; chances are that some
one will snap at you on your way in.
Palo Alto Square: These twin theaters
take up the bottom floor of a very
bland-looking office building at the
corner of El Camino and Page Miil
Road. They draw mostly high school
kids, because they tend to show boffo
films like Footloose and Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom. But
they are undeniably comfortable and
convenient (if you have a car).
Guild, Park: These are Menlo Park's
two movie theaters. (There used to be
a third, the Menlo, but it closed a
couple of years ago and its space was
absorbed by an expanding Chinese
restaurant.) They are located a few

blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run movies
of all kinds, including "art house"
films like This is Spinal Tap. They are
pleasant theaters, and pretty reliable
with regard to program
ming — generally speaking, at least
one of them is offering a film worth
seeing at any given time.

Old Mill 6: The bane of a moviegoer's
existence — you can't avoid seeing
films here: Since there are six screens,
two or three new pictures arrive each
week. Besides, the bargain-price
twilight shows are very seductive. (A
few months ago the cinemas can
celled their other attractive deal. All
Tuesday night showings once cost 99
cents. Now Tuesday night reduced
prices are subject to the whims of the
management.) But the screens are
tiny, the theater is always crowded,
and you move from line to line until
you feel you're being processed. Fur
thermore, it's an offensively ugly en
vironment in which to see

movies — the theater looks vaguely
like a video arcade. But if you must,
you must. Located in the Old Mill
Shopping Mall on San Antonio Road,
near the San Antonio Shopping Cen
ter. (The easiest way to get to it is via
Alma; if you take the San Antonio
turnoff, you'll find immediate signs
for the Old Mill.)

Mann 6: Fashion Island Shopping
Mall, located in San Mateo just off
Route 92 (heading toward the San
Mateo Bridge — watch for the tur
noff to the right, or you'll end up in

Hayward), is amazing. The shopping
center is enormous, and you drive
around it for what seems like hours
before you can park outside the
Mann 6 theaters. Inside sits every
junk food shop you've ever craved
(or avoided). Before slipping in to see
a movie on one of the six small
screens, you can sit and lick your
Haagen-Dazs chocolate-chocolate
chip cone or bite into your corn dog
while watching kids ice skate on the
rink that separates the fast food
stands from the movies. Fashion Is
land is also big on bargain matinees,
and if you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the after
noon), you can see even a block
buster like Indiana Jones without a
wait. Besides, it's a pop cultural ex
perience you won't want to miss.
Belmont: Sometimes a movie you
want to see disappears from every
other theater within a 20-minute
drive except for the Belmont, and so
if you're persistent, you hunt down
this suburban house (located north of
Ralston Avenue on El
Camino—there's a Ralston Ave.
exit on both 101 and 280), where
there's never a line and tickets are $2
a head even on Saturday nights. A
charmingly rundown theater.
Any local paper will tell you what's
playing at each of the above theaters
except those north of Menlo
Park — you'll need a San Francisco
Chronicle or Examiner for that infor
mation. The bills usually change on
Fridays (except for the revival
cinemas, of course). The best overall
guide to the movies is the "Arts and
Entertainment" section of the Sun
day Examiner & Chronicle, affec
tionately known as the "pink sec
tion." A number of local theaters ad
vertise in The Daily, as do the on
campus tilm series. A selective list of
movies (mostly revivals) appears ir.
the "Cinemascope" section of The
Daily every Friday.


U.A. Redwood 6: Another six-screen
theater, the U.A. is located in one of
the most unattractive areas in Red
wood City (which is saying a lot), and
the theater is even more claustrophic
than the Old Mill. But it's not as
popular, and all matinees (except
Sundays and holidays) are offered at
bargain prices.
Stanford is something of a movie
buffs paradise. At the best of times,
there are seven or eight film series
operating simultaneously on campus,
as well as a colorful selection of

theater, it should be noted, is not es
pecially nice; chances are that some
one will snap at you on your way in.
Palo Alto Square: These twin theaters
take up the bottom floor of a very
bland-looking office building at the
corner of El Camino and Page Miil
Road. They draw mostly high school
kids, because they tend to show boffo
films like Footloose and Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom. But
they are undeniably comfortable and
convenient (if you have a car).
Guild, Park: These are Menlo Park's
two movie theaters. (There used to be
a third, the Menlo, but it closed a
couple of years ago and its space was
absorbed by an expanding Chinese
restaurant.) They are located a few

blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run movies
of all kinds, including "art house"
films like This is Spinal Tap. They are
pleasant theaters, and pretty reliable
with regard to program
ming — generally speaking, at least
one of them is offering a film worth
seeing at any given time.

Old Mill 6: The bane of a moviegoer's
existence — you can't avoid seeing
films here: Since there are six screens,
two or three new pictures arrive each
week. Besides, the bargain-price
twilight shows are very seductive. (A
few months ago the cinemas can
celled their other attractive deal. All
Tuesday night showings once cost 99
cents. Now Tuesday night reduced
prices are subject to the whims of the
management.) But the screens are
tiny, the theater is always crowded,
and you move from line to line until
you feel you're being processed. Fur
thermore, it's an offensively ugly en
vironment in which to see

movies — the theater looks vaguely
like a video arcade. But if you must,
you must. Located in the Old Mill
Shopping Mall on San Antonio Road,
near the San Antonio Shopping Cen
ter. (The easiest way to get to it is via
Alma; if you take the San Antonio
turnoff, you'll find immediate signs
for the Old Mill.)

Mann 6: Fashion Island Shopping
Mall, located in San Mateo just off
Route 92 (heading toward the San
Mateo Bridge — watch for the tur
noff to the right, or you'll end up in

Hayward), is amazing. The shopping
center is enormous, and you drive
around it for what seems like hours
before you can park outside the
Mann 6 theaters. Inside sits every
junk food shop you've ever craved
(or avoided). Before slipping in to see
a movie on one of the six small
screens, you can sit and lick your
Haagen-Dazs chocolate-chocolate
chip cone or bite into your corn dog
while watching kids ice skate on the
rink that separates the fast food
stands from the movies. Fashion Is
land is also big on bargain matinees,
and if you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the after
noon), you can see even a block
buster like Indiana Jones without a
wait. Besides, it's a pop cultural ex
perience you won't want to miss.
Belmont: Sometimes a movie you
want to see disappears from every
other theater within a 20-minute
drive except for the Belmont, and so
if you're persistent, you hunt down
this suburban house (located north of
Ralston Avenue on El
Camino—there's a Ralston Ave.
exit on both 101 and 280), where
there's never a line and tickets are $2
a head even on Saturday nights. A
charmingly rundown theater.
Any local paper will tell you what's
playing at each of the above theaters
except those north of Menlo
Park — you'll need a San Francisco
Chronicle or Examiner for that infor
mation. The bills usually change on
Fridays (except for the revival
cinemas, of course). The best overall
guide to the movies is the "Arts and
Entertainment" section of the Sun
day Examiner & Chronicle, affec
tionately known as the "pink sec
tion." A number of local theaters ad
vertise in The Daily, as do the on
campus tilm series. A selective list of
movies (mostly revivals) appears ir.
the "Cinemascope" section of The
Daily every Friday.


U.A. Redwood 6: Another six-screen
theater, the U.A. is located in one of
the most unattractive areas in Red
wood City (which is saying a lot), and
the theater is even more claustrophic
than the Old Mill. But it's not as
popular, and all matinees (except
Sundays and holidays) are offered at
bargain prices.
Stanford is something of a movie
buffs paradise. At the best of times,
there are seven or eight film series
operating simultaneously on campus,
as well as a colorful selection of
revivals at the two downtown revival
houses, the New Varsity and the Fes
tival, and first-run foreign and
domestic pictures on 15 screens in
eight local theaters. Newly arrived
movie addicts will find their needs
tended to in the following locations.
ON CAMPUS
ASSU Sunday Flicks: This is the most
popular film series on campus — not
because it is assembled with espe
cially good taste, but because it in
cludes very recent releases and pro
vides a party-like atmosphere akin to
that of midnight screenings of The
Rocky Horror Picture Show. Most
people have a great time, though
those who prefer to see the screen be
hind the barrage of paper planes and
hear the soundtrack over the gleefully
improvised commentary may seek
elsewhere. Among last year's films
were 48 Hours, Risky Business. and
The Big Chill. Because the Sunday
Flicks draw such a large crowd, they
screen twice in Memorial Auditorium
(on Sunday evenings, of course).
Stanford Film Society: Though this
series is run by a small, dedicated
group of undergraduates, it is drawn
up in connection with the Film Aes
thetics and Film History courses of
fered in the Communication Depart
ment in the fall and winter,
respectively (Occasionally there will
be a spring series as well, but that is
rare.) Attendance is compulsory for

students enrolled in these courses,
but the movies—a highly varied
mixture of American and foreign
films, silents and talkies — are open
to everyone. These pictures are al
most always terrific. They screen
Monday evenings in Kresge
Auditorium.
German Film Series: Sponsored by
Haus Mitteleuropa, where they are
shown, these movies cover a wide
spectrum of German film. Classics
like M and Metropolis often pop up,
as well as examples of contemporary
German cinema and relatively
obscure entries like the film of Faust
starring Gustav Grundgens, the actor
on whose story Mephisto was based.
Thursday evenings.
Law School Film Society: Like the
publicity surrounding this series, the
choice of movies varies greatly accor
ding to who is in charge of it from
term to term. It's generally an
agreeable, nostalgic collection of
Hollywood classics like Little Women,
The Big Sleep and Roman Holiday,
and it draws affectionate, fairly quiet
audiences. Friday nights in Kresge
Auditorium.
Great Directors Film Series: The most
esoteric movies in town — this is a se
ries for diehard cinephiles. Again, the
selection depends on the tastes of the
two or three people who operate it,
but the emphasis is generally placed
on foreign films, particularly by
highly experimental directors whose
work would be unlikely to turn up
even in most revival theaters.

Chaparral Film Series: The Chaparral
supports itself largely through these
movies, so the list always includes a
number of sure-fire successes
(Woody Allen, Monty Python and
James Bond movies, for example).
And it emphasizes comedy, because
that, after all, is the Chaparral"s busi
ness. Because of the balance between
recent and older releases, the selec
tion of films is usually fairly decent,
and it includes a few really pleasant
surprises. Saturday evenings in
Kresge Auditorium.
Others: As well, Casa Italiana and La
Maison Francaise generally col
laborate on a French-Italian film se
ries at least one quarter every year. A
Japanese film series may also be of
fered. These always prove to be trea
sure troves for movie lovers with non
conformist tastes. Then there is the
usual smattering of dorm-sponsored
movies, movies associated with spe
cial events — one-shot deals — and
foreign (often Third World) films
shown by the Bechtel International
Center.
OFF CAMPUS
New Varsity: Located on University
Avenue between Waverly and Cow
per Streets, the New Varsity is a
nearly ideal repertory cinema.
Double bills (and occasionally triple
bills) change every day or two, and
they offer not only recent films (often
hot off the first-run screens) but also
American and foreign classics, some
not often revived. If a relatively un
publicized movie opens in San Fran
cisco and fails to show up first-run in
Palo Alto, chances are it will surface
at the New Varsity within six or eight

months. The seats are slightly rickety
and uncomfortable, but the Varsity's
patrons don't seem to mind very
much. The building also houses an
indoor-outdoor cafe-restaurant
where locals often gather in the even
ing for coffee, dessert and live music
in the courtyard. Warning: On Friday
nights the Varsity is a hangout for
teenagers — a responsive but per
haps overly vocal audience for the
movies the management has lately (in
the past year) provided to cater to
high school audiences.
Festival: Just behind the Varsity, on
Hamilton Avenue just west of Cow
per Street, is the Festival Theatre,
which shows one double bill a week.
(The movies change on Thursday.)
It's much smaller than the Var
sity — intimate, but very cozy, with
overstuffed seats and enormous pil
lows on the floor just in front of the
screen. Almost all the features are
Hollywood movies from the 1930s
and '40s (there's a British double bill
every six weeks or so), which are a
treat to see again on a big screen even
if you've already caught them on TV.
Aquarius: The Aquarius, on Emerson
between University and Lytton, has
two small cinemas that show mostly
foreign films, with the occasional
"small" American feature like Chilly
Scenes of Winter or A ngelo, My Love.
Since it is one of Palo Alto's major
claims to culture, it is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Saturday
nights; the Palo Alto moviegoing
crowd tends to adopt certain movies
that open at the Aquarius — El Norte
or Carmen — and keeps them playing
there for months. It's your basic
(essential) university theater, and

though its films are (of course) of
highly variable quality, the manage
ment has never compromised its deci
sion to show only arthouse selections.
Bijou: For years the Aquarius
Cinemas owned the Bijou — a small
cinema just down the street, on
Emerson between Hamilton and For

est — but last December new owners
converted it into a revival house dedi
cated (we were repeatedly told) to
showing unusual movies, domestic
and foreign that don't often appear
on local screens. And the first
schedule contained dozens of such

films — it was a movie buffs
paradise, until the management
decided it couldn't make money that
way. Each subsequent schedule has
been less interesting than the last, and
at the moment, except for the weekly
foreign film evening, it's a poor man's
New Varsity — and once a week or
so it turns into a nightclub, giving
over its space to a stand-up comic.
(It's a schizophrenic moviehouse.)
But no matter who or what is playing
on any night at the Bijou, you can be
sure you'll hear the owner, Bob
Stern, make his opening speech to the
audience.
Fine Arts On California Avenue, just
east of El Camino — in the midst of
the nicest commercial area in Palo
Alto, the Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater, known in the past for grab
bing hold of movies it could show for
months and months — like An Offi
cer and a Gentleman or Gandhi.
Lately the turnover has been more
rapid. The management of the
theater, it should be noted, is not es
pecially nice; chances are that some
one will snap at you on your way in.
Palo Alto Square: These twin theaters
take up the bottom floor of a very
bland-looking office building at the
corner of El Camino and Page Miil
Road. They draw mostly high school
kids, because they tend to show boffo
films like Footloose and Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom. But
they are undeniably comfortable and

(Woody Allen, Monty Python and
James Bond movies, for example).
And it emphasizes comedy, because
that, after all, is the Chaparral"s busi
ness. Because of the balance between
recent and older releases, the selec
tion of films is usually fairly decent,
and it includes a few really pleasant
surprises. Saturday evenings in
Kresge Auditorium.
Others: As well, Casa Italiana and La
Maison Francaise generally col
laborate on a French-Italian film se
ries at least one quarter every year. A
Japanese film series may also be of
fered. These always prove to be trea
sure troves for movie lovers with non
conformist tastes. Then there is the
usual smattering of dorm-sponsored
movies, movies associated with spe
cial events — one-shot deals — and
foreign (often Third World) films
shown by the Bechtel International
Center.
OFF CAMPUS
New Varsity: Located on University
Avenue between Waverly and Cow
per Streets, the New Varsity is a
nearly ideal repertory cinema.
Double bills (and occasionally triple
bills) change every day or two, and
they offer not only recent films (often
hot off the first-run screens) but also
American and foreign classics, some
not often revived. If a relatively un
publicized movie opens in San Fran
cisco and fails to show up first-run in
Palo Alto, chances are it will surface
at the New Varsity within six or eight

months. The seats are slightly rickety
and uncomfortable, but the Varsity's
patrons don't seem to mind very
much. The building also houses an
indoor-outdoor cafe-restaurant
where locals often gather in the even
ing for coffee, dessert and live music
in the courtyard. Warning: On Friday
nights the Varsity is a hangout for
teenagers — a responsive but per
haps overly vocal audience for the
movies the management has lately (in
the past year) provided to cater to
high school audiences.
Festival: Just behind the Varsity, on
Hamilton Avenue just west of Cow
per Street, is the Festival Theatre,
which shows one double bill a week.
(The movies change on Thursday.)
It's much smaller than the Var
sity — intimate, but very cozy, with
overstuffed seats and enormous pil
lows on the floor just in front of the
screen. Almost all the features are
Hollywood movies from the 1930s
and '40s (there's a British double bill
every six weeks or so), which are a
treat to see again on a big screen even
if you've already caught them on TV.
Aquarius: The Aquarius, on Emerson
between University and Lytton, has
two small cinemas that show mostly
foreign films, with the occasional
"small" American feature like Chilly
Scenes of Winter or A ngelo, My Love.
Since it is one of Palo Alto's major
claims to culture, it is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Saturday
nights; the Palo Alto moviegoing
crowd tends to adopt certain movies
that open at the Aquarius — El Norte
or Carmen — and keeps them playing
there for months. It's your basic
(essential) university theater, and

though its films are (of course) of
highly variable quality, the manage
ment has never compromised its deci
sion to show only arthouse selections.
Bijou: For years the Aquarius
Cinemas owned the Bijou — a small
cinema just down the street, on
Emerson between Hamilton and For

est — but last December new owners
converted it into a revival house dedi
cated (we were repeatedly told) to
showing unusual movies, domestic
and foreign that don't often appear
on local screens. And the first
schedule contained dozens of such

films — it was a movie buffs
paradise, until the management
decided it couldn't make money that
way. Each subsequent schedule has
been less interesting than the last, and
at the moment, except for the weekly
foreign film evening, it's a poor man's
New Varsity — and once a week or
so it turns into a nightclub, giving
over its space to a stand-up comic.
(It's a schizophrenic moviehouse.)
But no matter who or what is playing
on any night at the Bijou, you can be
sure you'll hear the owner, Bob
Stern, make his opening speech to the
audience.
Fine Arts On California Avenue, just
east of El Camino — in the midst of
the nicest commercial area in Palo
Alto, the Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater, known in the past for grab
bing hold of movies it could show for
months and months — like An Offi
cer and a Gentleman or Gandhi.
Lately the turnover has been more
rapid. The management of the
theater, it should be noted, is not es
pecially nice; chances are that some
one will snap at you on your way in.
Palo Alto Square: These twin theaters
take up the bottom floor of a very
bland-looking office building at the
corner of El Camino and Page Miil
Road. They draw mostly high school
kids, because they tend to show boffo
films like Footloose and Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom. But
they are undeniably comfortable and
convenient (if you have a car).
Guild, Park: These are Menlo Park's
two movie theaters. (There used to be
a third, the Menlo, but it closed a
couple of years ago and its space was
absorbed by an expanding Chinese
restaurant.) They are located a few

blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run movies
of all kinds, including "art house"
films like This is Spinal Tap. They are
pleasant theaters, and pretty reliable
with regard to program
ming — generally speaking, at least
one of them is offering a film worth
seeing at any given time.

Old Mill 6: The bane of a moviegoer's
existence — you can't avoid seeing
films here: Since there are six screens,
two or three new pictures arrive each
week. Besides, the bargain-price
twilight shows are very seductive. (A
few months ago the cinemas can
celled their other attractive deal. All
Tuesday night showings once cost 99
cents. Now Tuesday night reduced
prices are subject to the whims of the
management.) But the screens are
tiny, the theater is always crowded,
and you move from line to line until
you feel you're being processed. Fur
thermore, it's an offensively ugly en
vironment in which to see

movies — the theater looks vaguely
like a video arcade. But if you must,
you must. Located in the Old Mill
Shopping Mall on San Antonio Road,
near the San Antonio Shopping Cen
ter. (The easiest way to get to it is via
Alma; if you take the San Antonio
turnoff, you'll find immediate signs
for the Old Mill.)

Mann 6: Fashion Island Shopping
Mall, located in San Mateo just off
Route 92 (heading toward the San
Mateo Bridge — watch for the tur
noff to the right, or you'll end up in

Hayward), is amazing. The shopping
center is enormous, and you drive
around it for what seems like hours
before you can park outside the
Mann 6 theaters. Inside sits every
junk food shop you've ever craved
(or avoided). Before slipping in to see
a movie on one of the six small
screens, you can sit and lick your
Haagen-Dazs chocolate-chocolate
chip cone or bite into your corn dog
while watching kids ice skate on the
rink that separates the fast food
stands from the movies. Fashion Is
land is also big on bargain matinees,
and if you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the after
noon), you can see even a block
buster like Indiana Jones without a
wait. Besides, it's a pop cultural ex
perience you won't want to miss.
Belmont: Sometimes a movie you
want to see disappears from every
other theater within a 20-minute
drive except for the Belmont, and so
if you're persistent, you hunt down
this suburban house (located north of
Ralston Avenue on El
Camino—there's a Ralston Ave.
exit on both 101 and 280), where
there's never a line and tickets are $2
a head even on Saturday nights. A
charmingly rundown theater.
Any local paper will tell you what's
playing at each of the above theaters
except those north of Menlo
Park — you'll need a San Francisco
Chronicle or Examiner for that infor
mation. The bills usually change on
Fridays (except for the revival
cinemas, of course). The best overall
guide to the movies is the "Arts and
Entertainment" section of the Sun
day Examiner & Chronicle, affec
tionately known as the "pink sec
tion." A number of local theaters ad
vertise in The Daily, as do the on
campus tilm series. A selective list of
movies (mostly revivals) appears ir.
the "Cinemascope" section of The
Daily every Friday.


U.A. Redwood 6: Another six-screen
theater, the U.A. is located in one of
the most unattractive areas in Red
wood City (which is saying a lot), and
the theater is even more claustrophic
than the Old Mill. But it's not as
popular, and all matinees (except
Sundays and holidays) are offered at
bargain prices.
Stanford is something of a movie
buffs paradise. At the best of times,
there are seven or eight film series
operating simultaneously on campus,
as well as a colorful selection of
revivals at the two downtown revival
houses, the New Varsity and the Fes
tival, and first-run foreign and
domestic pictures on 15 screens in
eight local theaters. Newly arrived
movie addicts will find their needs
tended to in the following locations.
ON CAMPUS
ASSU Sunday Flicks: This is the most
popular film series on campus — not
because it is assembled with espe
cially good taste, but because it in
cludes very recent releases and pro
vides a party-like atmosphere akin to
that of midnight screenings of The
Rocky Horror Picture Show. Most
people have a great time, though
those who prefer to see the screen be
hind the barrage of paper planes and
hear the soundtrack over the gleefully
improvised commentary may seek
elsewhere. Among last year's films
were 48 Hours, Risky Business. and
The Big Chill. Because the Sunday
Flicks draw such a large crowd, they
screen twice in Memorial Auditorium
(on Sunday evenings, of course).
Stanford Film Society: Though this
series is run by a small, dedicated
group of undergraduates, it is drawn
up in connection with the Film Aes
thetics and Film History courses of
fered in the Communication Depart
ment in the fall and winter,
respectively (Occasionally there will
be a spring series as well, but that is
rare.) Attendance is compulsory for

students enrolled in these courses,
but the movies—a highly varied
mixture of American and foreign
films, silents and talkies — are open
to everyone. These pictures are al
most always terrific. They screen
Monday evenings in Kresge
Auditorium.
German Film Series: Sponsored by
Haus Mitteleuropa, where they are
shown, these movies cover a wide
spectrum of German film. Classics
like M and Metropolis often pop up,
as well as examples of contemporary
German cinema and relatively
obscure entries like the film of Faust
starring Gustav Grundgens, the actor
on whose story Mephisto was based.
Thursday evenings.
Law School Film Society: Like the
publicity surrounding this series, the
choice of movies varies greatly accor
ding to who is in charge of it from
term to term. It's generally an
agreeable, nostalgic collection of
Hollywood classics like Little Women,
The Big Sleep and Roman Holiday,
and it draws affectionate, fairly quiet
audiences. Friday nights in Kresge
Auditorium.
Great Directors Film Series: The most
esoteric movies in town — this is a se
ries for diehard cinephiles. Again, the
selection depends on the tastes of the
two or three people who operate it,
but the emphasis is generally placed
on foreign films, particularly by
highly experimental directors whose
work would be unlikely to turn up
even in most revival theaters.

Chaparral Film Series: The Chaparral
supports itself largely through these
movies, so the list always includes a
number of sure-fire successes
(Woody Allen, Monty Python and
James Bond movies, for example).
And it emphasizes comedy, because
that, after all, is the Chaparral"s busi
ness. Because of the balance between
recent and older releases, the selec
tion of films is usually fairly decent,
and it includes a few really pleasant
surprises. Saturday evenings in
Kresge Auditorium.
Others: As well, Casa Italiana and La
Maison Francaise generally col
laborate on a French-Italian film se
ries at least one quarter every year. A
Japanese film series may also be of
fered. These always prove to be trea
sure troves for movie lovers with non
conformist tastes. Then there is the
usual smattering of dorm-sponsored
movies, movies associated with spe
cial events — one-shot deals — and
foreign (often Third World) films
