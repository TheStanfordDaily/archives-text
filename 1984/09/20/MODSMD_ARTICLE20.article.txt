# Unveiling the Braun: It's got the beat

The Stanford student interested in
music does not have to look far to
find the right group, whether his inter
est lies in chamber music, symphony,
chorus, band, or about ten other of
ferings. The Music Department loca
tion, next to the post office, provides
easy access to practice rooms, two
rehearsal halls, individual lessons and
the music library.
With all these offerings, how can a
student choose just one? The proce
dure is simple. Auditions for all
groups will take place on Monday and
Tuesday, Sept. 24 and 25, normally
are not restricted to music majors. A
number of the department's perform
ing groups are open to the commu
nity — the Chorus, directed by Bill
Ramsey; the Church Choir, directed
by Gregory Wait; both the Symphony
and Chamber orchestras, directed by
Andor Toth; and Alea 11, the en
semble for new music, directed by
Paul Nahay. Other groups audition
ing Sept. 24 and 25, normally
restricted to Stanford students, are
the Chorale; Glee Club; Marching,
Symphonic, and Jazz bands; Early
Music Singers; and Renaissance
Wind Band.
Practice times for Stanford groups
range from three to four hours each
week. The symphony orchestra
rehearses each Monday and Thursday
from 7:15 p.m. to 9:15 p.m. The
Chorale rehearses each Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday from 12:00
to 1:00 p.m. All performing groups
with the exception of the chorus
receive one unit of credit each quar
ter. The chorus members receive two
units because they perform each Sun
day in Memorial Church.

The Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band (LSJUMB)
members get one unit of credit for
their work. This group, possibly the
largest rock and roll band in the
world, meets at the band shak. Audi
tion schedules for all performing
groups are available at the Music De
partment, the Tresidder information
desk and in the dorms.
Students who want to join a smaller
group for chamber music can also
receive coaching from a member of
the Music Department. Individual
chamber groups receive one unit of
credit. Stephen Harrison, cellist in the
Stanford String Quartet, will hold
auditions Tuesday afternoon, Sep
tember 25, in Braun Music Center,
Room 204. Harrison will fit people
into groups and arrange coaching.
Coaching will be available from
members of the Stanford Quartet and
from violinist Gennady Kleyman.
The Music Department offers
private lessons as well as opportuni
ties for group performance. Lessons
are available for every instrument
and are worth three units of credit per
quarter. Cost of lessons is $100 per
quarter for music majors and $200
for non-majors. But all students can
avoid some of the cost by applying for
a Music Guild Scholarship, good for
$100 each quarter off the price of les
sons. To apply for lessons, go to
Braun Music Center during registra
tion or earlier to fill out a card. The
teacher will arrange a time and place
for the lesson.
The new Braun Music Center
should increase student involvement
in the Music Department and make
life easier for both students and fac
ulty. At the old location on the Knoll,

the practice rooms were not com
pletely sound-proof. As a result, the
halls reverberated with the sounds of
students practicing different instru
ments. The sound-proof practice
rooms at the Braun Center should
eliminate this problem.
Also, the location of the Knoll was
not as convenient for students wan
ting to get music from the library or
to practice. As a result of the new lo
cation, group enrollment has in
creased. There are usually about
1000 participants at any one time in
all of the Stanford groups.
The new music building is also bet
ter equipped than the Knoll to handle
the needs of the students. Aside from
better practice facilities and faculty
offices, there is a large rehearsal hall
and the Campbell Recital Hall, which
seats 225 people. The center also has
an organ practice room and will have
a chorus rehearsal hall in mid-
November. There is a chamber music
room for early music and the entire
basement of Braun is taken up by the
music library.
If not interested in joining music
groups or taking private lessons, stu
dents can still attend the many con
certs each year by the Music
Department. There are over 100 con
certs each year that feature Stanford
performers and ensembles. Many
Music Department students give reci
tals in the upstairs lounge at Tresid
der. Stanford performing groups give
performances in Dinkelspiel Hall and
in Memorial Church. The Tresidder
recitals are free; the other ensemble
performances are inexpensive ($2 or
$3 for students and senior citizens; $4
or $5 general admission.) The first of
the Music Department concerts will

take place on Saturday, September
29, with a premiere performance of
Shaman, the multi-media work by
Janis Mattox, created at CCRMA,
the Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics.
There are also about 35 other con
certs given at Stanford in the Lively
Arts series. The Lively Arts program
contains a variety of events, including
dance companies, lectures and musi
cal acts. This year the Lively Arts is
bringing to campus a number of
soloists — Lynn Harrel, Uto Ughi
and Narciso Yepes, to name a
few — and chamber groups—the
Emerson, Guarneri and Prague
Quartets, the Kalichstein Laredo
Robisnon trio, etc. All Lively Arts
concerts take place in either
Memorial Auditorium or Dinkelsiel
Auditorium. A full schedule of con
certs is available in the Music Depart
ment or at the Tresidder information
desk. Concerts are also listed in The
Daily's "Once Around the Quad"
section.
The most well-known performing
groups in the Bay Area are 50
minutes from campus, in San Fran
cisco. The San Francisco Opera, on
the basis of its numerous big-name
guest stars, is world-renowned. This
season's lineup includes Carmen,
Madame Butterfly, Elektra, Don
Giovanna and Rigoletto. The San
Francisco Symphony, conducted by
Edo de Waart, performs in Davies
Symphony Hall and is very popular
among students. Many dorms buy
season tickets to the symphony for
use by students. Symphony programs
run Wednesday through Sunday. The
symphony season opens on October
27.
