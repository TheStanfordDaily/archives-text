						no-miss concert

If live music — danceable, new
genre rock — gets you out of your
seat and onto the dance floor, then
don't miss Murphy's Lawyers at the
New Varsity theater on Sept. 22.
A five-man group that came out of
Stanford two years ago, Murphy's
Lawyers turned pro, cut an album,
and now plays concerts with the likes
of Huey Lewis and Steppenwolf. The
band writes all its own music and is
currently experimenting with demo
recording in hopes of landing a major
contract.
But the members — four of whom

graduated from Stanford in
1982 — haven't forgotten their alma
mater now that they're in the big
leagues.
"We never want to leave Stan
ford," says David Cremin (guitar and
vocals). "We love Stanford parties
and we're going to keep playing Stan
ford parties."
Murphy's Lawyers are scheduled
for 9 p.m. on Sept. 22. The show also
features the highly successful group,
Translator. The New Varsity Theater
is located on University Avenue be
tween Waverly and Cowper Streets.
