## Stanford drama: acting out your wildest fantasies 
### 
What museums are to Florence, the
theater is to San Francisco.
No matter how much people talk
about San Francisco opera, or the
city's nightclubs, it is the area's
hundreds of theater groups that
validate San Francisco's claim to
West Coast cultural supremacy.
The most important activity takes
place in the many small theater
groups scattered around San Fran
cisco and Berkeley; the following ac
count starts closer to home, covering
the campus and area theater first,
then moving to the city's major
groups, and finally arriving at the
smaller venues.
The Stanford Drama Dept.
presents a major play each quarter,
with productions usually taking place
in the Little Theatre behind
Memorial Auditorium. The produc
tions are directed and designed by
members of the department, but cast
auditions are open to the public, and
students from fields other than drama
are often cast. The departments
1983-84 plays were Friedrich Dur
renmatt's The Visit, Pinero's
Trelawny of the "Wells," and Hamlet.
In addition to the major produc
tions, the department sponsors
Graduate Directing Workshops, "no
frills" productions directed by the de
partment's graduate students. These
are held at the Nitery, in the Old
Union, and there is no admission
charge. No titles have been an
nounced for this year; watch for
posters or advertisements in The
Daily.
There are several successful, on
going, student-run producing com

panies on campus. Chief among these
is Rams Head, which produces
Gaieties, a comedy revue, during the
Big Game week in the fall, and a
major musical production each
spring. In recent years Rams Head
has put on Cabaret and Hello Dolly.
Both Gaieties and the musicals are
put on in Memorial Auditorium. The
group also produces a program of
one-act plays written by students. The
Company is a smaller group, with a
production schedule less cut-and
dried than Rams Head's; individual
initiative counts for more in deter
mining what plays are produced, and
when. The Company's productions
vary greatly in scope, ranging in
recent years from the elaborate
stagings of Hair and Jesus Christ Su
perstar to a traveling troupe that went
from dorm to dorm doing The Fantas
tieks in lounges.
The Black Performing Arts Group
and the Asian American Theatre
Project also do plays, usually con
centrating their efforts on spring
quarter. Five years ago the AATP put
on the first performance anywhere of
David Henry Hwang's FOB, a play
which was later produced by Joseph
Papp in New York to critical acclaim.
All of the student production com
panies rely, of course, on student
ability in all areas: performance, di
rection, set and lighting, costume
work and promotion. Announce
ments regarding auditions and sup
port postitions appear in The Daily
and in flyers posted around campus.
Spring quarter is the great season
for dorm productions. Most of the
larger dorms, and even some of the

smaller ones, put on plays in the
spring. The repertoire is drawn
mainly from Broadway, either
comedies (You're a Good Man,

Charlie Brown; The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas) or musicals
{Oklahoma; Grease). Occasionally
something a bit more cerebral is at

tempted. Over the years, some dorms
have gained a reputation for the
lavishness of their productions;
Toyon, Lagunita and Branner are fa
mous in this regard.
The American Conservatory
Theater, or ACT, ranks with the
Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis as
one of the country's best regional
theaters. Its presence in the Geary
Theatre, at 450 Geary in the City,
makes Geary Street the heart of the
theater district. No company in the
Bay Area, or even on the West Coast
(outside of Shakespearean festival
groups) can rival the ACT in perfor
mance, facilities, or reputation. The
ACT is an arch-conservative com
pany: they go heavy on the classics,
and the modern (meaning 1920)
plays they do perform tend to be of
the sparkling British wit (Noel
Coward) or the folksy-American (/
Remember Mama, Ah! Wilderness)
kind. But they are nearly always a joy
to watch, because no one puts polish
on a production these days like the
ACT.
The big money in San Francisco
theater is tied up in Carole
Shorenstein's two "Best of Broad
way" series. "Best of Broadway"
plays in three different theatres: the
Golden Gate, 25 Taylor St.; the
Orpheum, 1192 Market St.; and the
Curran, 445 Geary St. (next door to the
ACT). All three host traveling
productions of Broadway hits.
Smaller-scale New York successes,
such as Caryl Churchill's Cloud 9 or
Harvey Fiernstein's Torch Song Tril
ogy, will sometimes be brought to
Theatre on the Square or the Marine's

Memorial Theatre, both located in
the Geary district near Union Square.
Although it does not often receive
much publicity, the bulk of the
theatrical activity in San Fransisco is
centered around the smaller, semi
professional theaters. It is here that
most of the local actors work, where
the local authors often have their
plays first performed and where the
local technicians get to try out their
ideas.
They are often referred to as the
"99-seat" theateis since, by limiting
themselves to fewer than 100 seats,
they may avoid Equity (i.e. union)
pay scales and thus mount new
productions at relatively low cost.
The size of these theaters also
brings benefits to the audience.
Spaces this small offer an intimacy
and intensity that is almost never at
tained in a large theater. There is of
ten no exravagent stage; sometimes
just a space on the floor surrounded
by seats. The traditional distance bet
weeen audience and performer can
be almost completely wiped out, em
phasizing the "live" aspects that give
theater its unique excitement.
Another advantage of the small
size is that writers and directors are
offered a great deal of flexibility. The
risks of mounting a production are
not so great, and experimentation is
common. Another important feature
is that the theaters may spe
cialize — only producing plays with
certain themes, or plays connected
with some social or political group.

A high point in Stanford drama last year was the Frost Ampitheater
production of "Hair," which was warmly received four consecutive
nights by large audiences. The show was produced by Theatre in Prog
ress, one of the many student groups presenting plays on campus each
year.
San Francisco theater can be difficult
since companies can surface and then
quickly disappear. There are a num
ber of theaters, however, which have
become and established part of the
City's cultural life. Even if it omits the
more volatile companies, a descrip
tion of their work should give an im
pression of the vitality of small
theater in the Bay Area.
The Magic Theatre is the best
known of the small theaters in San
Francisco, thanks in part to its resi
dent playwright, Sam Shepard.
Shepard has premiered many of his
more recent plays at the Magic, in
cluding True West and Buried Child
(which won the Pulitzer Prize in
1979).
The Magic specializes in new plays
by contemporary playwrights, and of
ten stages experimental theater
pieces by performance artists. It has
strong ties to contemporary German
and Austrian theater via its
dramaturg, Stanford Drama Prof.
Martin Esslin.
The 1983-84 Magic season in
cluded the premier of works by
Shepard, Ed Bullins, Mayo Simon
and Adele Edling Shank. The Magic
Theatre has two stages located in
Building D at Fort Mason.
The Julian Theatre specializes in
plays dealing with current events and
contemporary social issues. In addi
tion, its productions are usually
multi-racial and multi-cultural, thus
giving an implicit social consciousness
to any play it performs. The Julian is
located at 953 DeHaro Street, on
Potrero Hill. It shares its space in a
residential neighborhood with an
other group, the Nabe Theatre.
Because of the many ethnic and
social groups in the C«' - , playwrights
and performers from these groups
have come together to form theatres

which concentrate on the special in
terests of these communities. Two of
the best known groups of this type are
Theatre Rhinoceros and the Asian-
American Theatre Project. Theater
Rhinoceros produces plays about
homosexuals, several years ago
premiering Fierstein's Torch Song
Trilogy.
Because of its heavy reliance on
improvisation and its often transitory
nature, it is difficult to give much con
crete information about performance
art in the City. It is almost completely
unpublicized, with information being
spread by word of mouth among the
artist's friends and colleagues. An
other problem is that the works are
often performed in such unusual set
tings as empty lots, warehouses, or
parking lots.
One space which specializes in per
formance art (as well as environmen
tal sculpture and experimental
poetry) is 80 Langton. It is run by ar
tists, and it puts on freqent shows, but
often with very brief runs (perhaps
only one night).
80 Langston is located, not surpris
ingly, at 80 Langston, a small street
off Folsom Street near Seventh Street.
The small theaters in San Francisco
often put on plays with brief runs and
do not have much money to spend on
publicity. As a result, just finding out
what is going on can be a challange.
One very good source of informa
tion is the Sunday "pink section" of
the San Francisco Examiner &
Chronicle. It lists (occasionally with
descriptions) productions by the
more established small theaters.
There are two free publications
which give much more information
about the lesser-known groups. The
San Francisco Bay Guardian appears
every Wednesday. It is distributed in
many bars and restaurants in the City
and in the East Bay. In addition to a
calender of cheap and free events, it
publishes quite complete listings of
plays currently running as well as of
plays about to open.
