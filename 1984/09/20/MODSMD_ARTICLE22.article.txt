## Stanford drama: acting out your wildest fantasies 
### 
What museums are to Florence, the
theater is to San Francisco.
No matter how much people talk
about San Francisco opera, or the
city's nightclubs, it is the area's
hundreds of theater groups that
validate San Francisco's claim to
West Coast cultural supremacy.
The most important activity takes
place in the many small theater
groups scattered around San Fran
cisco and Berkeley; the following ac
count starts closer to home, covering
the campus and area theater first,
then moving to the city's major
groups, and finally arriving at the
smaller venues.
The Stanford Drama Dept.
presents a major play each quarter,
with productions usually taking place
in the Little Theatre behind
Memorial Auditorium. The produc
tions are directed and designed by
members of the department, but cast
auditions are open to the public, and
students from fields other than drama
are often cast. The departments
1983-84 plays were Friedrich Dur
renmatt's The Visit, Pinero's
Trelawny of the "Wells," and Hamlet.
In addition to the major produc
tions, the department sponsors
Graduate Directing Workshops, "no
frills" productions directed by the de
partment's graduate students. These
are held at the Nitery, in the Old
Union, and there is no admission
charge. No titles have been an
nounced for this year; watch for
posters or advertisements in The
Daily.
There are several successful, on
going, student-run producing com

panies on campus. Chief among these
is Rams Head, which produces
Gaieties, a comedy revue, during the
Big Game week in the fall, and a
major musical production each
spring. In recent years Rams Head
has put on Cabaret and Hello Dolly.
Both Gaieties and the musicals are
put on in Memorial Auditorium. The
group also produces a program of
one-act plays written by students. The
Company is a smaller group, with a
production schedule less cut-and
dried than Rams Head's; individual
initiative counts for more in deter
mining what plays are produced, and
when. The Company's productions
vary greatly in scope, ranging in
recent years from the elaborate
stagings of Hair and Jesus Christ Su
perstar to a traveling troupe that went
from dorm to dorm doing The Fantas
tieks in lounges.
The Black Performing Arts Group
and the Asian American Theatre
Project also do plays, usually con
centrating their efforts on spring
quarter. Five years ago the AATP put
on the first performance anywhere of
David Henry Hwang's FOB, a play
which was later produced by Joseph
Papp in New York to critical acclaim.
All of the student production com
panies rely, of course, on student
ability in all areas: performance, di
rection, set and lighting, costume
work and promotion. Announce
ments regarding auditions and sup
port postitions appear in The Daily
and in flyers posted around campus.
Spring quarter is the great season
for dorm productions. Most of the
larger dorms, and even some of the

smaller ones, put on plays in the
spring. The repertoire is drawn
mainly from Broadway, either
comedies (You're a Good Man,

Charlie Brown; The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas) or musicals
{Oklahoma; Grease). Occasionally
something a bit more cerebral is at

tempted. Over the years, some dorms
have gained a reputation for the
lavishness of their productions;
Toyon, Lagunita and Branner are fa
mous in this regard.
The American Conservatory
Theater, or ACT, ranks with the
Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis as
one of the country's best regional
theaters. Its presence in the Geary
Theatre, at 450 Geary in the City,
makes Geary Street the heart of the
theater district. No company in the
Bay Area, or even on the West Coast
(outside of Shakespearean festival
groups) can rival the ACT in perfor
mance, facilities, or reputation. The
ACT is an arch-conservative com
pany: they go heavy on the classics,
and the modern (meaning 1920)
plays they do perform tend to be of
the sparkling British wit (Noel
Coward) or the folksy-American (/
Remember Mama, Ah! Wilderness)
kind. But they are nearly always a joy
to watch, because no one puts polish
on a production these days like the
ACT.
The big money in San Francisco
theater is tied up in Carole
Shorenstein's two "Best of Broad
way" series. "Best of Broadway"
plays in three different theatres: the
Golden Gate, 25 Taylor St.; the
Orpheum, 1192 Market St.; and the
Curran, 445 Geary St. (next door to the
ACT). All three host traveling
productions of Broadway hits.
Smaller-scale New York successes,
such as Caryl Churchill's Cloud 9 or
Harvey Fiernstein's Torch Song Tril
ogy, will sometimes be brought to
Theatre on the Square or the Marine's

Memorial Theatre, both located in
the Geary district near Union Square.
Although it does not often receive
much publicity, the bulk of the
theatrical activity in San Fransisco is
centered around the smaller, semi
professional theaters. It is here that
most of the local actors work, where
the local authors often have their
plays first performed and where the
local technicians get to try out their
ideas.
They are often referred to as the
"99-seat" theateis since, by limiting
themselves to fewer than 100 seats,
they may avoid Equity (i.e. union)
pay scales and thus mount new
productions at relatively low cost.
The size of these theaters also
brings benefits to the audience.
Spaces this small offer an intimacy
and intensity that is almost never at
tained in a large theater. There is of
ten no exravagent stage; sometimes
just a space on the floor surrounded
by seats. The traditional distance bet
weeen audience and performer can
be almost completely wiped out, em
phasizing the "live" aspects that give
theater its unique excitement.
Another advantage of the small
size is that writers and directors are
offered a great deal of flexibility. The
risks of mounting a production are
not so great, and experimentation is
common. Another important feature
is that the theaters may spe
cialize â€” only producing plays with
certain themes, or plays connected
with some social or political group.

A high point in Stanford drama last year was the Frost Ampitheater
production of "Hair," which was warmly received four consecutive
nights by large audiences. The show was produced by Theatre in Prog
ress, one of the many student groups presenting plays on campus each
year.
