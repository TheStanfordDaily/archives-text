## Shakespeare festival All the Bay's a stage 
### TIM GRIEVE 
It's a long trip, but if you love Shakespeare, it's worth
every mile.
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival is held just over the
Oregon border in Ashland. The drive up Interstate 5 is in
credibly long, and, except for Mt. Shasta, incredibly un
remarkable. You get to see Weed, a town mentioned in
Steinbeck's Cannery Row, and Redding and Project City,
but other than that, it's the typical hot, dry California
landscape for four or five hundred miles.
But at the end of that searing superslab is Shake
speare — some of the best Shakespeare anywhere outside
the 16th century.
Bard-lovers from all over the country flock to Ash
land's three theaters to see top-flight productions of
plays, both by Shakespeare and his contemporaries and
by the would-be Shakespeares of the last 200 years.
The main stage for the festival is a re-creation of the
original venue for Shakespeare's work, the Globe theater
near London. Adjacent to both a road and a park, the
Ashland theater suffers from honking cars and quacking
ducks, but the power of the plays eliminates most distrac
tions.
Rotating daily through Sept. 29, this year's outdoor
performances are Henry VIII, Taming of the Shrew and
The Winter's Tale.

The Festival's two indoor theaters, the ultra-modern
Angus Bowmer and the tiny, intimate Black Swan, con
tinue to hold performances until late October. This year's
offerings include Hay Fever, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and
Seascape with Sharks and Dancer.
Although the Festival tends to play things safe on its
giant outdoor stage, there are some surprises occasionally
in the Bowmer theater. A recent production of Julius
Caesar, for instance, was set in a 20th century middle
eastern country, replete with desert terrorists and a
female Cassius. Echoing electronic voices empowered a
production of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman a few
years back, creating an eerie, frightening dramatic experi
ence.
Tickets for the Ashland plays aren't cheap. But stu
dents do get discounts at certain matinees and students
can buy any tickets remaining on the date of perfor
mances for just $5. Also, special student performances
are planned, with all seats at just $5. For information on
specific shows and prices, call the Festival at (503) 482-
4331.
But if you can't make it up to Oregon, a touring com
pany from the Festival will perform Taming of the Shrew
at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto later this fall. Call
(415) 323-4000 for more information.
