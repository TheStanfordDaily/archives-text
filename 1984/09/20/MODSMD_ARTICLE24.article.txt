San Francisco's nightclubs, even
more than Herb Caen and the Zodiac
Killer, distinguish this city from every
inhabited community outside of New
York state lines. The City has more
nightclubs than LA — a city which
holds somewhere near eight times as
many inhabitants.
Of course it is difficult to find one's
way around when one doesn't always
know where to go. Here, then, is a
guide to local hot spots worth fre
quenting.
The Keystone Palo Alto is the club
most folks know about. It's not the
cheapest club, or the biggest, or the

sphere and a chance to converse. The
Keystone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather, it blatantly
refuses to attempt reaching them.
Consequently, the selection of
bands is like that of a small concert
arena — country bumpkins one
night, multigenarian blues/jazz artists
the next, rapid and rabid lobotomy
rock the next (of both the heavy
metal and punk varieties). For the
latter, be especially forewarned: Palo

Alto punk rockers are a singularly
ridiculous bunch.
Despite the kids with skinny ties
borrowed from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks outside the
Keystone dropping off Skip and
Cindy for Punk Nite Out, the dancing
inside can often resemble a cross be
tween leapfrog and Rollerball. If you
are wary of the hazards, though, the
Keystone is always a good guess in
the spontaneous "let's go to a show"
rallies common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you enjoy the
hazards and want to go out of your

way to create them, then the
Mabuhay Gardens is waiting for you
with open safety pins. Five or six
years after the fact, punk music seems
to have settled its feud with (and ac
knowledged its debt to) heavy metal.
Perhaps in deference to this newly
discovered patrimony (or perhaps to
the sacred cash cow of the concertgo
ing public), punk clubs often have
"metal nights" and everyday
audiences these days definitely have

more of an axle-grease arua around
them, which is actually perfect for the
Mabuhay Gardens. While the
Keystone acts like a small arena, the
Fab Mab is more like a slightly
oversized garage, with brick walls and
a self-consciously dangerous air
about it.
The bands have the best names in
the Bay Area, though certainly not
top tonal quality. Still thriving as a
Polynesian restaurant by

day/leatherette cave by night, the
club is best for those who understand
the colossal joke taking place six or
seven nights a week. That's entertain
ment.
Roosting at the mouth of Broad
way, the Fab Mab also serves as an
introduction to the North Beach area
of the city, where most of the real
nightclubs (i.e., the ones that ad
vertise) reside. Right across the street
from the Mab is The Stone, owned by
the same folks who dispense enter
tainment at the Keystone Palo Alto.
The Stone is sort of a hybrid; it has
the physical qualities of its immediate
neighbor but the music selection of
the Keystone, a decidedly pop flavor.

If you go down Broadway a few
blocks (negotiating your way past the
massage parlors and Carol Doda) and
turn onto Columbus, you'll eventu
ally pass Wolfgang's, the physical suc
cessor to the Boarding House (901
Columbus) and the spiritual heir to
the Old Waldorf as Bill Graham's
Home for Acts That Can't Sell Out
the Coliseum. Amazingly enough,
few of the many sins of the father are
visited upon the latest offspring; the
sound is decent, the stage and lighting
very good, and there's even a balcony
for those who really don't go to clubs
to see the band. The only caveats to
the clubber are well-known to Wal
dorf denizens: Beware the chairs
(bicycle seats with legs), the drink

minimum (the "Calistoga with Or
ange Flavor" tastes like it should
have the word "Agent" in its title
somewhere) and the food (Chicken
Lollipops? McPutrid).
Better chairs and bigger shows can
be found at the other Graham venue,
the Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan
Center near Grary Street. Located
significantly west of North Beach, the,
Kabuki nonetheless has even more
traditional nightclub aesthetics; it's
big and flashy, like the nightclubs in
1930s musicals, with lots of tables for
the Nicholas Brothers to dance
across. It's a little bit odd to see Greg
Kihn play in a place that should have
Billie Holliday, but it's still a roomy,
nice club. The videos in the lobby

help as well, as does the Japantown
Bowling Alley across the street (open
until 4 a.m. on Wednesdays and
Thursdays and 24 hours on
weekends).
If you accept the above three ele
ments — music, rock video and
bowling -r-asa sort of a holy trinity
of night-,on-the-town experiences,
then the Park Bowl on Haighi Street
was designed with you in mind. Lo
cated a couple of blocks away from
the I-Beam, one of the more elabo
rate dance clubs on the scene (forget
the bands — the stage is a show in it
self), the Park Bowl is your basic,
well-mannered direct-from-Muncie,
Indiana bowling alley during the
week.

But on Friday and Saturday nights,
the lights go down, the volume goes
up, and a 12-foot video screen des
cends and hovers over the center
lanes. It, and satellite TV sets around
the alley, show rock videos and the
Hike while the paying customers ($6
cover charge for admission and about
two hours of tenpinning) take their
turns at the line and dance back to
their seats. There's a bar, too, for the
athletically inclined. As a concept,
the Park Bowl is fascinating; it in
spires the kind of never-there-but-'
nostalgic-anyway sigh that you only
hear outside old drive-in hamburger
stands and Broadway revivals.
Moreover, the darn thing works; it's a
lot of fun, and you very rarely get a

chance to think what a stupid game
bowling is. If nightclubbing is the art
of distraction, the Park Bowl on
Friday and Saturday nights should be
bronzed.
Don't think of this nightclubbing
guide as more than a series of press
box tracer shells, however; you're
going to have to make the rounds
yourself. In your search, you'll prob
ably find clubs off the beaten path,
and certainly ones not mentioned
here. The North Beach area has most
of the big clubs, for example, but
there's a better variety of acts south
of Market v Street around the China
Basin (where the Giants want to
insert a new domed baseball

stadium, provided Southern Pacific
can be persuaded not to build an
entire corporate Atlantis on the same
land). The only problem with this
area is that most of the "clubs" are
converted warehouses, with few com
forts and even fewer ways of finding
out about performances. If you can
learn your way around there, you'll
be in an "in crowd" that's so Iri, no
one knows it's there.
In any case, there are some
relatively hard-and-fast (as opposed
to soft-and-slow) rules about finding
a particular roost for your night-owl
habits.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits parties

of the first part from following only
high-fame quotient stars. High-fame
quotient stars usually end up in
stadiums, with high-boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you must
remember that nightclubs depend on
medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has-to
< do with only album sales, however, as
does the "high-fame quotient" — the
point is that you ought not wait all
year for your favorite group. They'll
sell out anyway, if they play in a
nightclub, so what true clubbers
ought to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in advance
that rule number two is not for a great

many people. It requires that you ad
mit the existence of a flaw. Yet it is
important, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So re
member this — despite the
popularity of component stereo sys
tems with multi-colored dials and
switches, most of humanity is unable
to tell a good sound system from a
dixie cup on a string. It follows from
this fact that although sound systems
vary in nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider an example. The Great
American Music Hall on O'Farrell
Street has definite acoustic draw-

backs, despite its habit of featuring
high-quality acoustic musicians. But
did you ever hear anyone complain
about it? The beautiful gold-leaf inte
rior at the Hall can sometimes send a
trumpet solo into an ear at a discon
certing moment. But it simply doesn't
need perfect acoustics, because there
are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what they
need at nearly every jazz club. (One
of the best, the Keystone Korner, on

Area jazz types like Jessica Williams
and Joe Henderson, along with na
tional figures.) Jazz places are fre
quented by people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have it be
cause they need it, but other places
don't.
So that's rule two, to be noted es-

pecially by rock fans. It doesn't make
much difference if the weak middle
range of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential to
know what kind of crowd you like.
There's a world of difference between
Mabuhay Gardens-variety crowds
and the rest of mankind as we know
it, for example. You simply have to
know which ilk you really enjoy or
else it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with ticket
prices, but they're usually listed in the
paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food and

drink prices begat rule number four.
And 10. the multitudes were told not
to forget that' gasoline is sometimes
required when return is made to Palo
Alto, and they were told that they
would have to sleep in an alley. And
the multitude adhered to the com
mandments of the golden calf of tui
tion, and called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule number
five, everybody got the Final Que.

When you choose a club, and like it,
go back. Frequent the place that
treated you like Jpou wanted to be
treated. The psychological difference
between an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you don't
look 13 can be considerable, and a
place that has extra dancing space
might turn things around. Never un
derestimate the power of a pleasant
atmosphere, once you've made up
your mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."

box tracer shells, however; you're
going to have to make the rounds
yourself. In your search, you'll prob
ably find clubs off the beaten path,
and certainly ones not mentioned
here. The North Beach area has most
of the big clubs, for example, but
there's a better variety of acts south
of Market v Street around the China
Basin (where the Giants want to
insert a new domed baseball

stadium, provided Southern Pacific
can be persuaded not to build an
entire corporate Atlantis on the same
land). The only problem with this
area is that most of the "clubs" are
converted warehouses, with few com
forts and even fewer ways of finding
out about performances. If you can
learn your way around there, you'll
be in an "in crowd" that's so Iri, no
one knows it's there.
In any case, there are some
relatively hard-and-fast (as opposed
to soft-and-slow) rules about finding
a particular roost for your night-owl
habits.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits parties

of the first part from following only
high-fame quotient stars. High-fame
quotient stars usually end up in
stadiums, with high-boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you must
remember that nightclubs depend on
medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has-to
< do with only album sales, however, as
does the "high-fame quotient" — the
point is that you ought not wait all
year for your favorite group. They'll
sell out anyway, if they play in a
nightclub, so what true clubbers
ought to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in advance
that rule number two is not for a great

many people. It requires that you ad
mit the existence of a flaw. Yet it is
important, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So re
member this — despite the
popularity of component stereo sys
tems with multi-colored dials and
switches, most of humanity is unable
to tell a good sound system from a
dixie cup on a string. It follows from
this fact that although sound systems
vary in nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider an example. The Great

did you ever hear anyone complain
about it? The beautiful gold-leaf inte

trumpet solo into an ear at a discon
certing moment. But it simply doesn't
need perfect acoustics, because there
are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what they
need at nearly every jazz club. (One

quented by people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have it be

don't.
So that's rule two, to be noted es-

pecially by rock fans. It doesn't make
much difference if the weak middle
range of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential to
know what kind of crowd you like.
There's a world of difference between
Mabuhay Gardens-variety crowds
and the rest of mankind as we know
it, for example. You simply have to
know which ilk you really enjoy or
else it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with ticket
prices, but they're usually listed in the
paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food and

drink prices begat rule number four.

Meanwhile, over at rule number

When you choose a club, and like it,
go back. Frequent the place that
treated you like Jpou wanted to be
treated. The psychological difference
between an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you don't

place that has extra dancing space
might turn things around. Never un
derestimate the power of a pleasant
atmosphere, once you've made up
your mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."

San Francisco's nightclubs, even
more than Herb Caen and the Zodiac
Killer, distinguish this city from every
inhabited community outside of New
York state lines. The City has more
nightclubs than LA — a city which
holds somewhere near eight times as
many inhabitants.
Of course it is difficult to find one's
way around when one doesn't always
know where to go. Here, then, is a
guide to local hot spots worth fre
quenting.
The Keystone Palo Alto is the club
most folks know about. It's not the
cheapest club, or the biggest, or the

differently. A nightclub has enter-

tainment but also gives you an atmo
sphere and a chance to converse. The
Keystone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather, it blatantly
refuses to attempt reaching them.
Consequently, the selection of
bands is like that of a small concert
arena — country bumpkins one
night, multigenarian blues/jazz artists
the next, rapid and rabid lobotomy
rock the next (of both the heavy
metal and punk varieties). For the
latter, be especially forewarned: Palo

Alto punk rockers are a singularly
ridiculous bunch.
Despite the kids with skinny ties
borrowed from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks outside the
Keystone dropping off Skip and
Cindy for Punk Nite Out, the dancing
inside can often resemble a cross be
tween leapfrog and Rollerball. If you
are wary of the hazards, though, the
Keystone is always a good guess in
the spontaneous "let's go to a show"
rallies common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you enjoy the
hazards and want to go out of your

way to create them, then the
Mabuhay Gardens is waiting for you
with open safety pins. Five or six
years after the fact, punk music seems
to have settled its feud with (and ac
knowledged its debt to) heavy metal.
Perhaps in deference to this newly
discovered patrimony (or perhaps to
the sacred cash cow of the concertgo
ing public), punk clubs often have
"metal nights" and everyday
audiences these days definitely have

more of an axle-grease arua around
them, which is actually perfect for the
Mabuhay Gardens. While the
Keystone acts like a small arena, the
Fab Mab is more like a slightly
oversized garage, with brick walls and
a self-consciously dangerous air
about it.
The bands have the best names in
the Bay Area, though certainly not
top tonal quality. Still thriving as a
Polynesian restaurant by

day/leatherette cave by night, the
club is best for those who understand
the colossal joke taking place six or
seven nights a week. That's entertain
ment.
Roosting at the mouth of Broad
way, the Fab Mab also serves as an
introduction to the North Beach area
of the city, where most of the real
nightclubs (i.e., the ones that ad
vertise) reside. Right across the street
from the Mab is The Stone, owned by
the same folks who dispense enter
tainment at the Keystone Palo Alto.
The Stone is sort of a hybrid; it has
the physical qualities of its immediate
neighbor but the music selection of
the Keystone, a decidedly pop flavor.

If you go down Broadway a few
blocks (negotiating your way past the
massage parlors and Carol Doda) and
turn onto Columbus, you'll eventu
ally pass Wolfgang's, the physical suc
cessor to the Boarding House (901
Columbus) and the spiritual heir to
the Old Waldorf as Bill Graham's
Home for Acts That Can't Sell Out
the Coliseum. Amazingly enough,
few of the many sins of the father are
visited upon the latest offspring; the
sound is decent, the stage and lighting
very good, and there's even a balcony
for those who really don't go to clubs
to see the band. The only caveats to
the clubber are well-known to Wal
dorf denizens: Beware the chairs
(bicycle seats with legs), the drink

minimum (the "Calistoga with Or
ange Flavor" tastes like it should
have the word "Agent" in its title
somewhere) and the food (Chicken
Lollipops? McPutrid).
Better chairs and bigger shows can
be found at the other Graham venue,
the Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan
Center near Grary Street. Located
significantly west of North Beach, the,
Kabuki nonetheless has even more
traditional nightclub aesthetics; it's
big and flashy, like the nightclubs in
1930s musicals, with lots of tables for
the Nicholas Brothers to dance
across. It's a little bit odd to see Greg
Kihn play in a place that should have
Billie Holliday, but it's still a roomy,
nice club. The videos in the lobby

help as well, as does the Japantown
Bowling Alley across the street (open
until 4 a.m. on Wednesdays and
Thursdays and 24 hours on
weekends).
If you accept the above three ele
ments — music, rock video and
bowling -r-asa sort of a holy trinity
of night-,on-the-town experiences,
then the Park Bowl on Haighi Street
was designed with you in mind. Lo
cated a couple of blocks away from
the I-Beam, one of the more elabo
rate dance clubs on the scene (forget
the bands — the stage is a show in it
self), the Park Bowl is your basic,
well-mannered direct-from-Muncie,
Indiana bowling alley during the
week.

But on Friday and Saturday nights,
the lights go down, the volume goes
up, and a 12-foot video screen des
cends and hovers over the center
lanes. It, and satellite TV sets around
the alley, show rock videos and the
Hike while the paying customers ($6
cover charge for admission and about
two hours of tenpinning) take their
turns at the line and dance back to
their seats. There's a bar, too, for the
athletically inclined. As a concept,
the Park Bowl is fascinating; it in
spires the kind of never-there-but-'
nostalgic-anyway sigh that you only
hear outside old drive-in hamburger
stands and Broadway revivals.
Moreover, the darn thing works; it's a
lot of fun, and you very rarely get a

chance to think what a stupid game
bowling is. If nightclubbing is the art
of distraction, the Park Bowl on
Friday and Saturday nights should be
bronzed.
Don't think of this nightclubbing
guide as more than a series of press
box tracer shells, however; you're
going to have to make the rounds
yourself. In your search, you'll prob
ably find clubs off the beaten path,
and certainly ones not mentioned

Keystone is always a good guess in
the spontaneous "let's go to a show"
rallies common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you enjoy the
hazards and want to go out of your

way to create them, then the
Mabuhay Gardens is waiting for you
with open safety pins. Five or six
years after the fact, punk music seems
to have settled its feud with (and ac
knowledged its debt to) heavy metal.
Perhaps in deference to this newly
discovered patrimony (or perhaps to
the sacred cash cow of the concertgo
ing public), punk clubs often have
"metal nights" and everyday
audiences these days definitely have

more of an axle-grease arua around
them, which is actually perfect for the
Mabuhay Gardens. While the
Keystone acts like a small arena, the
Fab Mab is more like a slightly
oversized garage, with brick walls and
a self-consciously dangerous air
about it.
The bands have the best names in
the Bay Area, though certainly not
top tonal quality. Still thriving as a
Polynesian restaurant by

day/leatherette cave by night, the
club is best for those who understand
the colossal joke taking place six or
seven nights a week. That's entertain
ment.
Roosting at the mouth of Broad
way, the Fab Mab also serves as an
introduction to the North Beach area
of the city, where most of the real
nightclubs (i.e., the ones that ad
vertise) reside. Right across the street
from the Mab is The Stone, owned by
the same folks who dispense enter
tainment at the Keystone Palo Alto.
The Stone is sort of a hybrid; it has
the physical qualities of its immediate
neighbor but the music selection of
the Keystone, a decidedly pop flavor.

If you go down Broadway a few
blocks (negotiating your way past the
massage parlors and Carol Doda) and
turn onto Columbus, you'll eventu
ally pass Wolfgang's, the physical suc
cessor to the Boarding House (901
Columbus) and the spiritual heir to
the Old Waldorf as Bill Graham's
Home for Acts That Can't Sell Out
the Coliseum. Amazingly enough,
few of the many sins of the father are
visited upon the latest offspring; the
sound is decent, the stage and lighting
very good, and there's even a balcony
for those who really don't go to clubs
to see the band. The only caveats to
the clubber are well-known to Wal
dorf denizens: Beware the chairs
(bicycle seats with legs), the drink

minimum (the "Calistoga with Or
ange Flavor" tastes like it should
have the word "Agent" in its title
somewhere) and the food (Chicken
Lollipops? McPutrid).
Better chairs and bigger shows can
be found at the other Graham venue,
the Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan
Center near Grary Street. Located
significantly west of North Beach, the,
Kabuki nonetheless has even more
traditional nightclub aesthetics; it's
big and flashy, like the nightclubs in
1930s musicals, with lots of tables for
the Nicholas Brothers to dance
across. It's a little bit odd to see Greg
Kihn play in a place that should have
Billie Holliday, but it's still a roomy,
nice club. The videos in the lobby

help as well, as does the Japantown
Bowling Alley across the street (open
until 4 a.m. on Wednesdays and
Thursdays and 24 hours on
weekends).
If you accept the above three ele
ments — music, rock video and
bowling -r-asa sort of a holy trinity
of night-,on-the-town experiences,
then the Park Bowl on Haighi Street
was designed with you in mind. Lo
cated a couple of blocks away from
the I-Beam, one of the more elabo
rate dance clubs on the scene (forget
the bands — the stage is a show in it
self), the Park Bowl is your basic,
well-mannered direct-from-Muncie,
Indiana bowling alley during the
week.

But on Friday and Saturday nights,
the lights go down, the volume goes
up, and a 12-foot video screen des
cends and hovers over the center
lanes. It, and satellite TV sets around
the alley, show rock videos and the
Hike while the paying customers ($6
cover charge for admission and about
two hours of tenpinning) take their
turns at the line and dance back to
their seats. There's a bar, too, for the
athletically inclined. As a concept,
the Park Bowl is fascinating; it in
spires the kind of never-there-but-'
nostalgic-anyway sigh that you only
hear outside old drive-in hamburger
stands and Broadway revivals.
Moreover, the darn thing works; it's a
lot of fun, and you very rarely get a

chance to think what a stupid game
bowling is. If nightclubbing is the art
of distraction, the Park Bowl on
Friday and Saturday nights should be
bronzed.
Don't think of this nightclubbing
guide as more than a series of press
box tracer shells, however; you're
going to have to make the rounds
yourself. In your search, you'll prob
ably find clubs off the beaten path,
and certainly ones not mentioned
here. The North Beach area has most
of the big clubs, for example, but
there's a better variety of acts south
of Market v Street around the China
Basin (where the Giants want to
insert a new domed baseball

stadium, provided Southern Pacific
can be persuaded not to build an
entire corporate Atlantis on the same
land). The only problem with this
area is that most of the "clubs" are
converted warehouses, with few com
forts and even fewer ways of finding
out about performances. If you can
learn your way around there, you'll
be in an "in crowd" that's so Iri, no
one knows it's there.
In any case, there are some
relatively hard-and-fast (as opposed
to soft-and-slow) rules about finding
a particular roost for your night-owl
habits.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits parties

of the first part from following only
high-fame quotient stars. High-fame
quotient stars usually end up in
stadiums, with high-boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you must
remember that nightclubs depend on
medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has-to
< do with only album sales, however, as
does the "high-fame quotient" — the
point is that you ought not wait all
year for your favorite group. They'll
sell out anyway, if they play in a
nightclub, so what true clubbers
ought to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in advance
that rule number two is not for a great

many people. It requires that you ad
mit the existence of a flaw. Yet it is
important, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So re
member this — despite the
popularity of component stereo sys
tems with multi-colored dials and
switches, most of humanity is unable
to tell a good sound system from a
dixie cup on a string. It follows from
this fact that although sound systems
vary in nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider an example. The Great
American Music Hall on O'Farrell
Street has definite acoustic draw-

bowling as a holy trinity of night-on

backs, despite its habit of featuring
high-quality acoustic musicians. But
did you ever hear anyone complain
about it? The beautiful gold-leaf inte
rior at the Hall can sometimes send a
trumpet solo into an ear at a discon
certing moment. But it simply doesn't
need perfect acoustics, because there
are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what they
need at nearly every jazz club. (One
of the best, the Keystone Korner, on

Despite the popularity of component

agreement 'Vijlh th£llG$ T its succes
sor s£eiris W bfe RimbaffVon Gittve
Street, wtiich generally books Bay
Area jazz types like Jessica Williams
and Joe Henderson, along with na
tional figures.) Jazz places are fre
quented by people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have it be
cause they need it, but other places
don't.
So that's rule two, to be noted es-

pecially by rock fans. It doesn't make
much difference if the weak middle
range of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential to
know what kind of crowd you like.
There's a world of difference between
Mabuhay Gardens-variety crowds
and the rest of mankind as we know
it, for example. You simply have to
know which ilk you really enjoy or
else it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with ticket
prices, but they're usually listed in the
paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food and

drink prices begat rule number four.
And 10. the multitudes were told not
to forget that' gasoline is sometimes
required when return is made to Palo
Alto, and they were told that they
would have to sleep in an alley. And
the multitude adhered to the com
mandments of the golden calf of tui
tion, and called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule number
five, everybody got the Final Que.

When you choose a club, and like it,
go back. Frequent the place that
treated you like Jpou wanted to be
treated. The psychological difference
between an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you don't
look 13 can be considerable, and a
place that has extra dancing space
might turn things around. Never un
derestimate the power of a pleasant
atmosphere, once you've made up
your mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."

San Francisco's nightclubs, even
more than Herb Caen and the Zodiac
Killer, distinguish this city from every
inhabited community outside of New
York state lines. The City has more
nightclubs than LA — a city which
holds somewhere near eight times as
many inhabitants.
Of course it is difficult to find one's
way around when one doesn't always
know where to go. Here, then, is a
guide to local hot spots worth fre
quenting.
The Keystone Palo Alto is the club
most folks know about. It's not the
cheapest club, or the biggest, or the

and that means a lot to a mostly

San Mateo on a stray SamTrans 7F or
facing the Tenderloin district without
an easy escape route.

differently. A nightclub has enter-

tainment but also gives you an atmo
sphere and a chance to converse. The
Keystone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather, it blatantly
refuses to attempt reaching them.
Consequently, the selection of
bands is like that of a small concert
arena — country bumpkins one
night, multigenarian blues/jazz artists
the next, rapid and rabid lobotomy
rock the next (of both the heavy
metal and punk varieties). For the
latter, be especially forewarned: Palo

Alto punk rockers are a singularly
ridiculous bunch.
Despite the kids with skinny ties
borrowed from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks outside the
Keystone dropping off Skip and
Cindy for Punk Nite Out, the dancing
inside can often resemble a cross be
tween leapfrog and Rollerball. If you
are wary of the hazards, though, the
Keystone is always a good guess in
the spontaneous "let's go to a show"
rallies common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you enjoy the
hazards and want to go out of your

way to create them, then the
Mabuhay Gardens is waiting for you
