# Books, books, books
## Where to browse, where to buy 
### 
Between California Avenue, in Palo Alto, and Santa
Cruz Avenue, in Menlo Park, there are nearly 30 differ
ent stores which sell only, or primarily, books. In addi
tion, a number of other establishments — thrift shops, con
signment shops, outdoor stores, etc. — which keep books
on hand. Any attempt to cover them all would he over
whelming; the following account will only try to hit the
highlights.
The place to start, of course, is on campus. The
Stanford Bookstore is both more than, and less than, a
good bookstore. More, because half of its floor space is
given over to office, art and engineering supplies, cloth
ing, candy and cookies, stationery, cards and hundreds of
items that say "Stanford." The Bookstore also stocks
textbooks (upstairs), cashes checks (on Saturdays), orders
art prints, and does a plethora of other things most
bookstores won't.
If you are looking for something specific, the selection
is very good in most areas (particularly art history and
literary criticism), but the atmosphere in the front of the
-.tore, where the books are shelved, is such as to force you
to find the book you want quickly and leave. The lighting
is unpleasant, and there is no seating of any kind; the rows
of often-crowded check-out lines make the store
resemble nothing so much as a supermarket. It's a good
place to find a book (they will also order anything in
print), but it ranks low as a place for looking at books.
The campus is bracketed by the area's two best "new
book" bookstores. To the southeast, and slightly closer, is
Printers Inc. (310 California Ave.). Printers Inc. is
relatively new (it was started by tive former Kepler's
employees) and has quickly become the most popular
place around, largely on the strength of its espresso bar
and artsv/literary ambiance. Printers Inc. calls itself "the
literary book 1 -tore," and most nights the store is full of
professors of English, local artist types, a tew real writers,
and a lot of people trying hard to look like they belong.
This, to my mind, is one of the store's drawbacks.
Another drawback is the lack of ventilation — Printers
Inc. is a hot place if you're more than 10 feet from the
door. Atmospheric conditions aside, however. Printers
Inc. is a good store, well-stocked in most areas (both
hard- and soft-cover), especially strong in children's
books and Action. with lots of chairs scattered around and
cc carpeting rwity). Last, and best, is the magazine

selection. Scattered around the front of the store are
hundreds of periodicals, everything from Arizona High
ways to Die Zeit, and also the area's best selection of
scholarly and literary journals.
Northwest of campus, along El Camino Real in Menlo
Park, lies Kepler's. Kepler's is a local landmark, having
been a focus of "radical" activity in the '60s. The store
has moved with the times; its image is now composed of
equal parts of environmental awareness, small-scale tech
nology advocacy, and championship of small and avant
garde presses.
The main bragging point at Kepler's, as far as books go,
is its claim to be the biggest paperback bookstore around.
This may be true — you can find almost anything there —
but the sterile, shopping-mall feel of the store's new
building (it moved a couple of years ago) discourages
browsing. The old store didn't have the carpeting or
stained shelves of a Printers Inc., but sheer size made it a
nice place to browse — there were any number of nooks
and nannies to lose yourself in.
One feature that has been carried over is an alcove with
chairs and tables where no one bothers you while you
read and a copier bearing a sign that asks you not to break
the spines of the books you xerox. Kepler's has a maga
zine selection second only to Printers Inc. among local
bookstores, and a section devoted to small press publica
tions. Both stores are open late most nights.
Several other"new book"' stores deserve mention.
There are three very different stores in downtown Palo
Alto; Shirley Cobb (452 University Ave.), Stacev's(2l9
University Ave ), and Plowshare Community Booksellers
(162 University Ave.). Shirley Cobb is the epitome of the
small-scale, personalized bookstore. It stocks only hard
cover, and the selection is aimed at affluent, educated,
suburbanites This makes it a bit expensive, but browsing
is fun, and it's a wonderful place to shop for a gift. The se
lection is rather idiosyncratic, perhaps reflecting the
staffs tastes, but the art, photography, nature and fiction
sections are excellent.
Stacey's began strictly as a medical/technical store but
has expanded into most of the general areas. The techni
cal areas still seem to be the store's strength.
Plowshare was founded about 13 years ago by a group
of Stanford graduates, and is very community-oriented;
it's the place to go for news of environmental, anti

nuclear, or any "counter-culture" happenings. It is, at the
same time, an excellent small paperback store, with a
good selection of fiction and a children's alcove; the back
room is reserved for the sections of Eastern religions,
honiesteading, etc.
Behind Macy's, in the Stanford Shopping Center, you'll
find Books Inc., a hard-cover/soft-cover store notable for
its paperback mystery and science fiction stocks and its
remainder tables and shelves. In the Old Mill Shopping
Center, off San Antonio Road in Mountain View, is
Upstart Crow & Co. This bookstore/cafe has little in the
way of books, but if you have to be in the Old Mill, it's not
a bad place to get a cup of coffee.
There are chain stores in the area; one should shun
them as a matter of principle, but occasionally a bargain
can be found on their bargain tables. Closest to the
campus are Dalton's, in the Stanford Shopping Center,
and Waldenbooks, on California Ave.
A number of stores cater to particular needs. The most
common of this type is the religious bookstore. My favor
ite bookstore name in the area used to be that of the One

Way Bookstore (320 California Ave.), a Christian shop
that closed two years ago. Still in business are The An
gelus (779 Santa Cruz Ave., Menlo Park) and the East-
West Bookshop (1170 El Camino, Menlo Park), which is
heavily into the mystic. The most interesting store of this
type I've found is Minerva Books (1027 Alma Street, Palo
Alto), a small but very attractive store with interesting se
lections in mythology and all religions and without the
self-conscious "mysticism" of other stores like itself.
A distant relative of the religious bookstore is the sci
ence fiction and fantasy bookstore. Comics and Comix in
downtown Palo Alto (515 Cowper St.) has lots of com
ic books, San Francisco paperbacks, posters, and
magazines; its stock runs toward sadistic porn, and the
clientele appears to be mostly high-school age. Future
Fantasy (2033 El Camino, Palo Alto) is smaller, but more
serious.
Finally, here are three miscellaneous special-interest
stores. The American Opinion Bookstore (2656 Broad
way, Redwood City) is the "peninsula's only conservative
bookstore." Szwede Slavic Books (2233 El Camino, Palo
Alto) is self-explanatory. And the closest adult bookstore
to campus is the H & R Bookstore (on El Camino in Red
wood City), where you can also watch movies for a quar
ter and buy magazines in plastic bags for $12.50.
If you're interested in used books, for economy's or
collecting's sake, you will want to go to Berkeley as often
as possible. Having said that, I must admit that there are a
couple of stores around here that nearly match up, the
differences being mainly of size rather than quality.
For collectors, the two most important stores in this
area are Chimaera Books & Records and Wessex Used
Books & Records. Wessex, located near the corner of El
Camino and Santa Cruz in Menlo Park, is strictly a used
book store. The stock is mostly hard-cover, and the
specialty is modern fiction, wtihin which area the store is
one of best in the Bay Area. Wessex is a small store (two
rooms), and outside of fiction its selection rather skimpy.
But there are enough novels to keep you browsing for
hours, and the prices are very reasonable, as first editions
go-
Chimaera is another story entirely. The store takes up
most of the two-story house on the corner of Kipling and
Lytton, in downtown Palo Alto.
After all this, there is still one unresolved issue: Where
should you go to buy The Sunday New York Times? The
closest place is The Store at Tresidder Union; the store
gets the paper late and sells out early. Better is Printers
Inc., where you can read the paper over a cup of French
roast, assuming you can find an empty table. Best,
however, is Mac's Smoke Shop (534 Emerson St.), half a
block from the Good Earth Restaurant in downtown Palo
Alto.

Behind Macy's, in the Stanford Shopping Center, you'll
find Books Inc., a hard-cover/soft-cover store notable for
its paperback mystery and science fiction stocks and its
remainder tables and shelves. In the Old Mill Shopping
Center, off San Antonio Road in Mountain View, is
Upstart Crow & Co. This bookstore/cafe has little in the
way of books, but if you have to be in the Old Mill, it's not
a bad place to get a cup of coffee.
There are chain stores in the area; one should shun
them as a matter of principle, but occasionally a bargain
can be found on their bargain tables. Closest to the
campus are Dalton's, in the Stanford Shopping Center,
and Waldenbooks, on California Ave.
A number of stores cater to particular needs. The most
common of this type is the religious bookstore. My favor
ite bookstore name in the area used to be that of the One

Way Bookstore (320 California Ave.), a Christian shop
that closed two years ago. Still in business are The An
gelus (779 Santa Cruz Ave., Menlo Park) and the East-
West Bookshop (1170 El Camino, Menlo Park), which is
heavily into the mystic. The most interesting store of this
type I've found is Minerva Books (1027 Alma Street, Palo
Alto), a small but very attractive store with interesting se
lections in mythology and all religions and without the
self-conscious "mysticism" of other stores like itself.
A distant relative of the religious bookstore is the sci
ence fiction and fantasy bookstore. Comics and Comix in
downtown Palo Alto (515 Cowper St.) has lots of com
ic books, San Francisco paperbacks, posters, and
magazines; its stock runs toward sadistic porn, and the
clientele appears to be mostly high-school age. Future
Fantasy (2033 El Camino, Palo Alto) is smaller, but more
serious.
Finally, here are three miscellaneous special-interest
stores. The American Opinion Bookstore (2656 Broad
way, Redwood City) is the "peninsula's only conservative
bookstore." Szwede Slavic Books (2233 El Camino, Palo
Alto) is self-explanatory. And the closest adult bookstore
to campus is the H & R Bookstore (on El Camino in Red
wood City), where you can also watch movies for a quar
ter and buy magazines in plastic bags for $12.50.
If you're interested in used books, for economy's or
collecting's sake, you will want to go to Berkeley as often
as possible. Having said that, I must admit that there are a
couple of stores around here that nearly match up, the
differences being mainly of size rather than quality.
For collectors, the two most important stores in this
area are Chimaera Books & Records and Wessex Used
Books & Records. Wessex, located near the corner of El
Camino and Santa Cruz in Menlo Park, is strictly a used
book store. The stock is mostly hard-cover, and the
specialty is modern fiction, wtihin which area the store is
one of best in the Bay Area. Wessex is a small store (two
rooms), and outside of fiction its selection rather skimpy.
But there are enough novels to keep you browsing for
hours, and the prices are very reasonable, as first editions
go-
Chimaera is another story entirely. The store takes up
most of the two-story house on the corner of Kipling and
Lytton, in downtown Palo Alto.
After all this, there is still one unresolved issue: Where
should you go to buy The Sunday New York Times? The
closest place is The Store at Tresidder Union; the store
gets the paper late and sells out early. Better is Printers
Inc., where you can read the paper over a cup of French
roast, assuming you can find an empty table. Best,
however, is Mac's Smoke Shop (534 Emerson St.), half a
block from the Good Earth Restaurant in downtown Palo
Alto.


(ill Gilbert/Daily
Between California Avenue, in Palo Alto, and Santa
Cruz Avenue, in Menlo Park, there are nearly 30 differ
ent stores which sell only, or primarily, books. In addi
tion, a number of other establishments — thrift shops, con
signment shops, outdoor stores, etc. — which keep books
on hand. Any attempt to cover them all would he over
whelming; the following account will only try to hit the
highlights.
The place to start, of course, is on campus. The
Stanford Bookstore is both more than, and less than, a
good bookstore. More, because half of its floor space is
given over to office, art and engineering supplies, cloth
ing, candy and cookies, stationery, cards and hundreds of
items that say "Stanford." The Bookstore also stocks
textbooks (upstairs), cashes checks (on Saturdays), orders
art prints, and does a plethora of other things most
bookstores won't.
If you are looking for something specific, the selection
is very good in most areas (particularly art history and
literary criticism), but the atmosphere in the front of the
-.tore, where the books are shelved, is such as to force you
to find the book you want quickly and leave. The lighting
is unpleasant, and there is no seating of any kind; the rows
of often-crowded check-out lines make the store
resemble nothing so much as a supermarket. It's a good
place to find a book (they will also order anything in
print), but it ranks low as a place for looking at books.
The campus is bracketed by the area's two best "new
book" bookstores. To the southeast, and slightly closer, is
Printers Inc. (310 California Ave.). Printers Inc. is
relatively new (it was started by tive former Kepler's
employees) and has quickly become the most popular
place around, largely on the strength of its espresso bar
and artsv/literary ambiance. Printers Inc. calls itself "the
literary book 1 -tore," and most nights the store is full of
professors of English, local artist types, a tew real writers,
and a lot of people trying hard to look like they belong.
This, to my mind, is one of the store's drawbacks.
Another drawback is the lack of ventilation — Printers
Inc. is a hot place if you're more than 10 feet from the
door. Atmospheric conditions aside, however. Printers
Inc. is a good store, well-stocked in most areas (both
hard- and soft-cover), especially strong in children's
books and Action. with lots of chairs scattered around and
cc carpeting rwity). Last, and best, is the magazine

selection. Scattered around the front of the store are
hundreds of periodicals, everything from Arizona High
ways to Die Zeit, and also the area's best selection of
scholarly and literary journals.
Northwest of campus, along El Camino Real in Menlo
Park, lies Kepler's. Kepler's is a local landmark, having
been a focus of "radical" activity in the '60s. The store
has moved with the times; its image is now composed of
equal parts of environmental awareness, small-scale tech
nology advocacy, and championship of small and avant
garde presses.
The main bragging point at Kepler's, as far as books go,
is its claim to be the biggest paperback bookstore around.
This may be true — you can find almost anything there —
but the sterile, shopping-mall feel of the store's new
building (it moved a couple of years ago) discourages
browsing. The old store didn't have the carpeting or
stained shelves of a Printers Inc., but sheer size made it a
nice place to browse — there were any number of nooks
and nannies to lose yourself in.
One feature that has been carried over is an alcove with
chairs and tables where no one bothers you while you
read and a copier bearing a sign that asks you not to break
the spines of the books you xerox. Kepler's has a maga
zine selection second only to Printers Inc. among local
bookstores, and a section devoted to small press publica
tions. Both stores are open late most nights.
Several other"new book"' stores deserve mention.
There are three very different stores in downtown Palo
Alto; Shirley Cobb (452 University Ave.), Stacev's(2l9
University Ave ), and Plowshare Community Booksellers
(162 University Ave.). Shirley Cobb is the epitome of the
small-scale, personalized bookstore. It stocks only hard
cover, and the selection is aimed at affluent, educated,
suburbanites This makes it a bit expensive, but browsing
is fun, and it's a wonderful place to shop for a gift. The se
lection is rather idiosyncratic, perhaps reflecting the
staffs tastes, but the art, photography, nature and fiction
sections are excellent.
Stacey's began strictly as a medical/technical store but
has expanded into most of the general areas. The techni
cal areas still seem to be the store's strength.
Plowshare was founded about 13 years ago by a group
of Stanford graduates, and is very community-oriented;
it's the place to go for news of environmental, anti

nuclear, or any "counter-culture" happenings. It is, at the
same time, an excellent small paperback store, with a
good selection of fiction and a children's alcove; the back
room is reserved for the sections of Eastern religions,
honiesteading, etc.
