## Quad kissing still in fashion Campus traditions from years gone by 
### 
Puzzling over that row of bronze
numbered plaques in front of Memo
rial Church? Those plaques, set in the
tiles of the Quad since 1892, conceal
one of the few remaining Stanford
traditions.
Each graduating class over the
years has interred a time capsule
containing the memorabilia of its
short era at Stanford—everything
from armbands to the Saturday Night
Fever soundtrack, from Lacoste shirts
to punk rock paraphernalia. The cap
sules are to be opened, one per year,
starting with the University's centen
nial in 1992.
But other Stanford traditions have
not stood the test of time so well and
like many collegiate whims ha>e gone
the way of panty raids and streaking

• Candy or flowers are a must for
women subjected to the indignity of
being locked out after dormitory
closing hours.
• No men allowed in women's dorms
except in social rooms.
• No women allowed alone in men's
dorms, fraternities or off campus.
• An annual Hello Day in the fall
when everyone must say hello to
everyone else.
• And last but not least, the tradi
tional Big Game bonfire has been
forever extinguished.
The demise of many of these tradi
tions came with women's liberation
and the sexual revolution of the '60s.
Others 'ust faded into a past that held
svvfc scriptures more dearly.
Sortie new traditions such as fol
the Band to the City the night
rvtore Bit Game. Jack's runs and the
crea: paper airplane show during the
Sursiax Flicks have risen to take the
oid formalities' place.
However, freshmen women must
sat! be on their guard for one tradi
tion which is still going strong. As
tegend has it, in fact, one cannot truly
be called a Stanford woman until one
has been kissed in the middle of the
Ouad at midnight during a full moon
bv a senior man. Bring a bottle of
champagne and do it up right—you'll
be in good company.
