Terms of Endearment (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
Jack Nicholson dominates this
James Brooks movie by playing
against his role as Garrett Breedlove,
a slightly seedy astronaut. The movie,
which began life as an oddball 1975
novel by Larry McMurtry, is essential
ly a story about the delicate balance
two strong women, Aurora and Emma
Greenway, preserve in their mother
daughter relationship; all the men in
their lives — husbands and lovers —
are weak and rather pathetic. (You
sense that McMurtry and Brooks think
there's something sexy about ineffec
tual men.) Brooks really takes his tone
from the last 50 pages of the novel, in
which Emma learns she has cancer,
and audiences respond to his movie
because it makes them weep. Debra
Winger is terrific as Emma — she's
zesty, in a loose, improvisatory style —
but Shirley MacLaine, as Aurora, ap
pears somewhat hard and sharp and
unsympathetic; her timing is just about
perfect, but she doesn't show a great
deal of depth. The film has a number
of good sequences, and a lovely cameo
by John Lithgow, but Brooks is not a
director yet (Oscar or no Oscar), and
much of what he does here is fairly
shameless. With Jeff Daniels as Em
ma's husband Flap.
Plays Tuesday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.
Fiddler on the Roof (1971)
New Varsity, 456 University Avenue,
Palo Alto
Norman Jewison made this mag
nificent film of the long-running
Broadway musical by Joseph Stein,
Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick, from
Stein's screenplay. The setting is a
small village in Russia during the time
of the anti-Jewish pogroms-, the
protagonist, Tevye (wonderfully
played by the Isareli actor Topol), is
struggling to hold onto the traditions

of his people while the modern world
insists on eating away at them. Not all
of Jewison's decisions were the ideal
ones — there are some irritating,
literal-minded moments, and he
should never have cast Moll) Picon as
Yente the matchmaker — but the most
important ones are nearly inspired.
With Norma Crane as Golde. Leonard
Frey as Motel Kamzoil, Paul Mann as
Lazar Wolf, Rosalind Harris as
Tzeitel, Michele Marsh as Hodel and
Neva Small as Chava; shot by Oswald
Morris; Isaac Stern plays the violin
theme; Tom Abbott adapted Jerome
Robbins' choreogrephy. ( N. 8.: 32
minutes have been hacked off the
original release prints.)
Plays Sunday with Zorba the Greek.
Diva (1982)
Bijou, 640 Emerson Street, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of this picture,
directed by Jean-Jacques Beinix and
shot by Philippe Rousselot, is dazzling;
all the surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles
of a movie. Beinix's chief virtue, aside
from his dexterity, is his determination
not to take himself seriously: the witty,
freewheeling way in which he has put
the picture together, making his
camera double back on itself with tan
talizing self-consciousness, seems to be
based on the careless assumption that
this little thriller about stolen tapes is
inconsequential. You can't complain
that Diva doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the weightless,
hollow shimmer of Hilton McCon
nico's interior design declare it in
every frame. With Frederic Andrei,
who recalls the Jean-Pierre Leaud of
the middle and late 19605; Thuy An
Luu, who has the unflappable cool of a
Godard gamine; and the black singer
Wilhelminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Hamme adapted
a novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir
Cosma supplied a terrific jazzy score.

Plays tomorrow and Saturday.
Diner (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Barry Levinson
based this wonderful period piece, set
in 1959, on his own past, and every
detail in it seems deeply felt. The
heroes are a quintet of men in their
early 20s who gather to celebrate the
wedding of one of them and to send off
the decade that saw their adolescence.
Levinson understands the highly emo
tionally charged nature of what we call
"trivia": pop music is the absolute
against which these people measure
everything that transpires in their lives.
The acting (by Daniel Stern, Steve
Guttenberg, Mickey Rourke, Kevin
Bacon, Timothy Daly, Ellen Barkin
and others) has the kind of
verisimilitude we usually find in great
documentaries. Diner is perhaps the
most sensuous and complexly funny
rites of passage movie ever made in
this country.
Plays Sunday with The Natural.
Smiles of a Summer Night (1955)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman has never made a
better picture than this complex sexual
farce, which suggests a Viennese
operetta as Shakespeare might have
written it. The players are a middle
aged lawyer (Gunnar Bjornstrand); his
wife (Ulla Jacobsson), still a virgin; his
one-time mistress, an actress (Eva
Dahlbeck); her egocentric lover (Karl
Julie); his proud, melancholy wife
(Margit Carlquist); the carnal, ebul
lient maid (Harriet Andersson) — and,
in the background, the actress' aging
mother (Naima Wifstrand). This
movie inspired the marvelous Stephen
Sondehim musical A Little Night
Music, but there's nothing like the
original.
Plays Monday with Pauline at the

Beach.
The Long Goodbye (1973)
York, 2789 24th Street, San Francisco
Probably the most offbeat of all
detective movies, and possibly the
greatest this side of The Maltese Fal
con. Robert Altman and the
screenwriter, Leigh Brackett, adapted
a Raymond Chandler novel that was
written in the early '50s but really
evoked the Los Angeles of the previ
ous decade; the protagonist is Philip
Marlowe. But Chandler's L.A. never
looked like this: fluroescent-lit all
night supermarkets, bungalows on the
ocean with huge picture windows, per
manently stoned suburban women in
sunbonnets and long flowing dresses.
And Chandler's Marlowe never talked
or walked or behaved like Elliott
Gould (who gives a fantastic perfor
mance). Gould plays Marlowe as a
gumshoe with an outmoded code of
honor, misplaced in the terrifyingly
spaced-out L.A. of the '70s. Altman
keeps the film afloat on so many emo
tional levels at once that you're never
sure how to respond. With Sterling
Hayden as a Hemingwayesque writer
(who looks a lot like Altman himself);
Nina Van Pallandt, who possesses a
death-like beauty, as his wife; Jim
Bouton as a ne'er-do-well; Henry Gib
son as a spooky shrink; and Mark
Rydell as a gangster — a crazy collec
tion of performers, and all of them
splendid. Vilmos Zsigmond did the as
tonshing cinematography.
Plays Monday with Thieves Like Us.
Atlantic City (1981)
York, San Francisco
The playwright John Guare has an
unusual temperament and an inclusive
comic vision: His work shows an acute
consciousness of all levels of human
existence that does not move into
cynicism. His screenplay for this Louis

Malle film is full of surprises. We meet
Sally (Susan Sarandon), who works at
a hotel oyster bar in Atlantic City but
is training to be a croupier; Lou (Burt
Lancaster), an aging numbers runner
who takes care of bed-ridden Grace
(Kate Reid), the widow of an old
friend, for whom he also provides oc
casional sexual services; Sally's
estranged husband David (Robert
Joy), a cocaine dealer who travels with
Sally's space cadet kid sister Chrissie
(Hollis McLaren), a Korean foot
massage specialist whom he has im
pregnated. The movie is an inspired
grab bag in which these wonderfully
suggestive characters form unexpected
relationships and manage to function
in their individual idiosyncratic ways
despite the pressures of the outside
world and with respect, even affection,
for each other's strangely colored, su
percharged spaces. Beautifully acted
— especially by Burt Lancaster, whose
portrayal of the petty criminal who
trips into the big time caps three and a
half decades of movie acting.
Plays next Thursday with Crackers.
Five Easy Pieces (1970)
U.C. Theatre, 2036 University Ave
nue (at Shattuck), Berkeley
Bob Rafelson directed this famous
study in end-of-the-'6os alienation,
from a screenplay by Adrien Joyce. It
was the movie to see when it came out;
Rafelson and Joyce made the fury and
torment of the hero, a gifted pianist
who has turned his back on his aris
tocratic family and the promise of a
career, extremely romantic, and many
at that time shared his cynical vision of
America. Jack Nicholson's embodi
ment of this new kind of angry young
man made him a star. With Susan
Anspach and Karen Black as the two
women who can't make him happy,
and Lois Smith, Billy Green Smith and
Fannie Flagg.

Plays tonight with The King of Mar
vin Gardens.
Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jim
my Dean, Jimmy Dean (1983)
Roxie, 16th Street near Valencia, San
Francisco
Robert Altman directed Ed Grac
zyk's play in New York last winter and
then filmed it, with the same cast, in 19
days. It's full of tinny echoes of Ten
nessee Williams, Eugene O'Neill, and
Edward Albee; if you read the script,
the agonized revelatory structure and
stilted, purplish dialogue would prob
ably make you choke with laughter.
But, directing Sandy Dennis, Cher and
Karen Black, Robert Altman — for
the first time in more than half a de
cade — exhibits once again the control
that other directors dream of. Under
his hand this trio of actresses plays this
hollow, derivative prose as if it were
Chekhov. A knockout. Co-starring
Sudie Bond, Marta Heflin, Kathy
Bates and Mark Patton.
Plays tonight with Streamers.
Bedazzled (1968)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Peter Cook and Dudley Moore as
the Devil and Faust (in the modern
person of one Stanley Moon). They
wrote the story, which Cook turned
into a screenplay, and they are both
terribly funny in it. The style of this
Stanley Donen film is '60s pop (the
editing is Richard Lester-influenced,
and Austin Dempster's photography is
colorful — though not really aestheti
cally pleasing), and the structure is a
series of revue sketches, also reflecting
the period in which it was made. It isn't
consistently hilarious, but the best
parts (like a sequence in which Moore
plays a nun who has taken a vow of
silence) are wonderful.
Plays next Thursday with
Unfaithfully Yours (1984 version).
