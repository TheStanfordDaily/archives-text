The Stanford Daily —
a quaint little place in the Storke
Publications Building across from the
Terman Engineering Center featuring
a wide variety of fresh articles served
each day. For an appetizer, try a
feature on an inside page or a sports
article. For the main course, you need
look no further than page one for a
hot piece of news. And the price? It's
free, daily. The Daily — try it, you'll
like it.
