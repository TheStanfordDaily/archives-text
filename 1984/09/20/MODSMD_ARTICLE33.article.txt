## A 						dozen Stanford musts: All-time favorite classes 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
After all the Orientation games,
trips, dances and parties, it hits you.
You have to sign up for classes, but
you haven't the faintest idea what to
take.
Writing, foreign language and
Western Culture requirements make
your decisions a little easier, but you
still have a number of free units to
distribute as you desire.
Advisers may tell you to fill your
eight area requirements quickly, and
you may decide instead to delve im
mediately into your own narrow area
of study.
But whatever classes you opt to
take, do not overlook the dozen
courses on the following list. Most are
universally popular. All are unique
and memorable.
Art 001: Introduction to Art. Al
bert Elsen. This topical introductory
course, taught by the distinguished
and opinionated Haas professor of art
history, is a popular fall quarter class.
Students intending to enroll in any
other art history courses should plan
to take this one first.
Civil Engineering 170: Environment
Science and Technology. Gil Masters.
A tremendously popular, non
technical introduction to the causes
and effects of environmental pollu
tion. The course covers issues such as
over-population and food distribu
tion that prospective international re
lations and political science majors
might enjoy studying from a scientific
perspective.
English 173 A: Shakespeare. Ronald
Rebholz. Even if you took Shake
speare in high school, this class is
worth a repeat performance. Rebholz
has earned a reputation as a colorful
and opinionated lecturer who brings
new insight to your understanding of
the Bard. Shakespeare courses cover
ing different plays are offered each
quarter, with Rebholz teaching only
one of them. Readings of selected

scenes are scheduled at the end of
each week. Take this class even if
you've read some of the plays before.
History 91: Traditional East Asian
Civilization. Bill Lyell and Lyman
Valf Slyke. The professors comple
ment each other perfectly; Lyell is
highly entertaining but his lectures
sometimes lack organization. Van
Slyke is more didactic but also better
organized. The class begins with a
look into the development of civiliza
tion in early China and ends with
Neo-Confucianism. Lyell lapses into
Chinese at times, but on the whole
the course is geared to the non
specialist.
History 172 A: America Since 1945.
Barton Bernstein. Here is a challeng
ing professor who is both loved and
hated, but always admired. The
revisionist historian is one of the most
well-organized and dynamic lecturers
on campus, and everyone who takes
this course — over 200 students last
year — seems to agree that it is
among the best offered at Stanford.
Arrogant or not, Bernstein certainly
gets you thinking. Beware: the
reading is formidable and the grading
tough. And don't schedule a class
right afterwards: Bernstein has been
known to lecture overtime fre
quently.
Human Biology 10: Human
Sexuality. Herant Katchadourian.
Lively lectures and guest speakers
combined with the satisfaction of the
every thing-you-al ways-wan ted-to
know syndrome make this one a very
popular course here.
Political Science 001: Majors Issues
of American Public Policy. Hubert
Marshall. This class is a fuzzy classic.
Marshall's dynamic lecuring style, his
insights on the Vietnam War and his
accessibility combine to make this a
"must" class. Be prepared to do lots
of reading, including a large amount
of Alexis de Toqueville. But also be

prepared to learn a great deal about
poverty, monopolies, foreign policy
and the distribution of power in
American politics and the economy.
Political Science 138 A: Arms Con
trol and Disarmament. Coit Blacker
and John Lewis. This course, taught
by interdisciplinary faculty and en
livened by frequent guest lecturers
from Washington and the United Na
tions, is comprehensive, thought
provoking and difficult. You will
doubtless spend many hours
memorizing military facts and
acronyms, but your effort will be
rewarded.
Psychology 001: General Psychol
ogy. Philip Zimbardo. One of the
most popular courses on campus,
Zimbardo's introductory class is par
ticularly renowned for its innovative
grading policy. After reading each
chapter, students take a short chapter
test administered in a proctor's home.
If they don't pass, they must take it
again. Students trying for an 'A' also
must pass an oral test on Zimbardo's
Shyness book and pass a written exam
on the lectures at the end of the term.
More than 90 percent of the class
receives the A grade. Zimbardo adds
zest to otherwise dull topics by
scheduling guest lectures, films, mul
timedia presentations and mass hyp
nosis demonstrations.
Sociology 109 (Same as Political
Science 183K): The Criminal Law and
the Criminal System. John Kaplan.
Kaplan's casual wit and the course's
interesting subject matter make this a
favorite. When Newsweek on
Campus included Crim Law in its list
of the nation's top "micks," or easy
courses, Kaplan offered an angry
response, and the class became a con
troversial one overnight. Granted,
the lecture notes, fairly light reading
load and multiple choice tests do not
hurt, but expect to study and learn a
great deal in a fascinating area.

Values, Technology and Society
101: Contemporary Technological So
ciety. Robert McGinn. The title may
not inspire you, but McGinn and the
topics he covers will. The section dis
cussions about issues — ones you
might not have even realized were
worth discussing — such as test tube
babies, the Concorde jet and snow
mobiles are particularly enlightening.

The reading load is rather average.
More time-consuming is the prepara
tion for a 10-minute speech as part of
a debate.
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation 56: Windsurfing. Joseph
Petrucci. Spring quarter at Stanford
is the time to get outside and experi

ence afternoons on Lake Lag. What
better way to do it than California
style? Many students here would tell
you not to leave the Farm without
learning how to windsurf. The only
problem is that there are over 5000
undergraduates here and lots of them
want to learn to sail on a surfboard,
so sign up early if you want to become
a Stanford cliche.

After all the Orientation games,
trips, dances and parties, it hits you.
You have to sign up for classes, but
you haven't the faintest idea what to
take.
Writing, foreign language and
Western Culture requirements make
your decisions a little easier, but you
still have a number of free units to
distribute as you desire.

want to learn to sail on a surfboard,
so sign up early if you want to become
a Stanford cliche.

After all the Orientation games,
trips, dances and parties, it hits you.
You have to sign up for classes, but
you haven't the faintest idea what to
take.
Writing, foreign language and
Western Culture requirements make
your decisions a little easier, but you
still have a number of free units to
distribute as you desire.
Advisers may tell you to fill your
eight area requirements quickly, and
you may decide instead to delve im
mediately into your own narrow area
of study.
But whatever classes you opt to
take, do not overlook the dozen
courses on the following list. Most are
universally popular. All are unique
and memorable.
Art 001: Introduction to Art. Al
bert Elsen. This topical introductory
course, taught by the distinguished
and opinionated Haas professor of art
history, is a popular fall quarter class.
Students intending to enroll in any
other art history courses should plan
to take this one first.
Civil Engineering 170: Environment
Science and Technology. Gil Masters.
A tremendously popular, non
technical introduction to the causes
and effects of environmental pollu
tion. The course covers issues such as
over-population and food distribu
tion that prospective international re
lations and political science majors
might enjoy studying from a scientific
perspective.
English 173 A: Shakespeare. Ronald
Rebholz. Even if you took Shake
speare in high school, this class is
worth a repeat performance. Rebholz
has earned a reputation as a colorful
and opinionated lecturer who brings
new insight to your understanding of
the Bard. Shakespeare courses cover
ing different plays are offered each
quarter, with Rebholz teaching only
one of them. Readings of selected

scenes are scheduled at the end of
each week. Take this class even if
you've read some of the plays before.
History 91: Traditional East Asian
Civilization. Bill Lyell and Lyman
Valf Slyke. The professors comple
ment each other perfectly; Lyell is
highly entertaining but his lectures
sometimes lack organization. Van
Slyke is more didactic but also better
organized. The class begins with a
look into the development of civiliza
tion in early China and ends with
Neo-Confucianism. Lyell lapses into
Chinese at times, but on the whole
the course is geared to the non
specialist.
History 172 A: America Since 1945.
Barton Bernstein. Here is a challeng
ing professor who is both loved and
hated, but always admired. The
revisionist historian is one of the most
well-organized and dynamic lecturers
on campus, and everyone who takes
this course — over 200 students last
year — seems to agree that it is
among the best offered at Stanford.
Arrogant or not, Bernstein certainly
gets you thinking. Beware: the
reading is formidable and the grading
tough. And don't schedule a class
right afterwards: Bernstein has been
known to lecture overtime fre
quently.
Human Biology 10: Human
Sexuality. Herant Katchadourian.
Lively lectures and guest speakers
combined with the satisfaction of the
every thing-you-al ways-wan ted-to
know syndrome make this one a very
popular course here.
Political Science 001: Majors Issues
of American Public Policy. Hubert
Marshall. This class is a fuzzy classic.
Marshall's dynamic lecuring style, his
insights on the Vietnam War and his
accessibility combine to make this a
"must" class. Be prepared to do lots
of reading, including a large amount
of Alexis de Toqueville. But also be

prepared to learn a great deal about
poverty, monopolies, foreign policy
and the distribution of power in
American politics and the economy.
Political Science 138 A: Arms Con
trol and Disarmament. Coit Blacker
and John Lewis. This course, taught
by interdisciplinary faculty and en
livened by frequent guest lecturers
from Washington and the United Na
tions, is comprehensive, thought
provoking and difficult. You will
doubtless spend many hours
memorizing military facts and
acronyms, but your effort will be
rewarded.
Psychology 001: General Psychol
ogy. Philip Zimbardo. One of the
most popular courses on campus,
Zimbardo's introductory class is par
ticularly renowned for its innovative
grading policy. After reading each
chapter, students take a short chapter
test administered in a proctor's home.
If they don't pass, they must take it
again. Students trying for an 'A' also
must pass an oral test on Zimbardo's
Shyness book and pass a written exam
on the lectures at the end of the term.
More than 90 percent of the class
receives the A grade. Zimbardo adds
zest to otherwise dull topics by
scheduling guest lectures, films, mul
timedia presentations and mass hyp
nosis demonstrations.
Sociology 109 (Same as Political
Science 183K): The Criminal Law and
the Criminal System. John Kaplan.
Kaplan's casual wit and the course's
interesting subject matter make this a
favorite. When Newsweek on
Campus included Crim Law in its list
of the nation's top "micks," or easy
courses, Kaplan offered an angry
response, and the class became a con
troversial one overnight. Granted,
the lecture notes, fairly light reading
load and multiple choice tests do not
hurt, but expect to study and learn a
great deal in a fascinating area.

Values, Technology and Society
101: Contemporary Technological So
ciety. Robert McGinn. The title may
not inspire you, but McGinn and the
topics he covers will. The section dis
cussions about issues — ones you
might not have even realized were
worth discussing — such as test tube
babies, the Concorde jet and snow
mobiles are particularly enlightening.

The reading load is rather average.
More time-consuming is the prepara
tion for a 10-minute speech as part of
a debate.
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation 56: Windsurfing. Joseph
Petrucci. Spring quarter at Stanford
is the time to get outside and experi

ence afternoons on Lake Lag. What
better way to do it than California
style? Many students here would tell
you not to leave the Farm without
learning how to windsurf. The only
problem is that there are over 5000
undergraduates here and lots of them
want to learn to sail on a surfboard,
so sign up early if you want to become
a Stanford cliche.
