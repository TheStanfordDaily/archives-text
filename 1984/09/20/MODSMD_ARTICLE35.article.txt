## Just hop on a bus, forget about us,.. 
### 
As your horizons extend beyond
the Farm, even beyond Palo Alto,
they reach northward to San Fran
cisco. The perfect day in the City
forms in your mind, but you quickly
dismiss the idea since you, like many
of us, have no wheels.
Suddenly San Francisco seems very
far, much farther than when you were
deciding whether to come to Stanford
and you read in the pre-enrollment
propoganda that "San Francisco is 35
miles to the north and offers the ur
ban pleasures of theaters, galleries,
restaurants and an extensive shop
ping district."
If you feel your desire to travel
north stifled by your lack of a car,
you'll be happy to know that there
are other inexpensive and convenient .
ways to get there.
The most easily accessible trans
portation to the City is the SamTrans
bus which departs from the El
Camino Real bus stop across from the
Stanford Shopping Center. From
there, the 7F bus line follows High
way 101 which, although not the most
scenic route, costs only $1.45 each
way.
Buses begin the hourly trip to San
Francisco at 5:17 a.m. on weekdays
and at 7:07 a.m. on weekends. After
8:37 a.m. buses run every half hour
until the 3:37 p.m., when they return
to hourly departures with the last bus
leaving at 12 :44 a.m.
The travel time by bus is nearly
twice that of driving, but the hour and
one-half passes more quickly if
shared with a book, Walkman or
friend. Be prepared to stand if you
ride during commuter hours.
When you arrive at the downtown
stops, Eighth and Mission (near the
Civic Center) or First and Mission,
the City aura hits you and the image
of the long bus ride quickly fades.
Don't forget that the last bus back to
Palo Alto leaves First and Mission at
12:49 a.m. and that the south-bound
buses leave from Seventh and Mis
sion instead of Eighth.
Earlier, the homewardbound 7F
buses leave every 10-15 minutes until
5:45 p.m. when they start leaving
once an hour.
If you really want to "get into" the
Bay Area commuting scene, you may
want to consider taking BART (Bay
Area Rapid Transit) into the City.
But since the closest BART station to
Stanford is in Daly City, using BART
first entails finding transportation to
Daly City — about 20 miles north of
campus on Interstate 280.
The 5L SamTrans bus line regu
larly leaves the Palo Alto Southern
Pacific railway station from 6:00 a.m.
until 6:30 p.m. and stops at the Daly
City BART station. The trip costs less
than a dollar, but the stop-and-go
route takes about an hour and a half.
One practical advantage of using
BART is that it offers special bicycle
permits including temporary, one
time passes. But since neither the bus
nor the train allows bikes, you need

to hitch a ride with your bike to Daly
City. If your bike collapses at the
frame, you don't need a special per
mit to take it on BART.
BART, with its space-age appear
ance and automation — replete with
machines which sell tickets that whiz
through slots and magically open
gates — is the pride of the Bay Area.
Boarding for the 20-minute ride is
self-explanatory, as well-lit signs
mark the way. The price varies on
your precise destination but never
exceeds $1.10 one way.
The seven downtown stations are
all underground and centrally lo
cated: Four are along Market Street,
two on Mission Street and one near
San Francisco City College at Geneva
and San Jose Streets.
BART runs every 15-20 minutes
from 6 a.m. until midnight Monday
through Saturday and from 9 a.m. un
til midnight on Sundays. BART is still
fairly new and promises a swift and
comfortable entry to downtown.
But if buses make you sick and you
think BART is too robotic, there is
always the train. The CalTrain leaves
from the Southern Pacific Depot off

University Avenue: a short bike ride
from campus. Don't forget to lock
your bike securely before abandoning
it for the day, or you may end up
walking home.
The train is more expensive than
the other methods of transport, with a
one-way ticket costing $3.20 and a
round trip $4.80, but it tends to be
more comfortable and roomy than
the bus.
After a smattering of dawn
departures, the train's schedule eases
into what vaguely resembles hourly
departures from 8:24 a.m. till 10:24
p.m. with a few extra trips thrown in.
The downtown stop is at Fourth and
Townsend, fairly far from centers of
interest, but along the city bus routes.
The combined network of cable
cars, the mini metro and regular
buses make up the City's transporta
tion system — better known as
MUNI.
Along such routes, MUNI can get
you from your depot (no matter
which transportation you choose) to
within a short walk of anywhere you
want to go in the City. MUNI will be
a necessary part of your journey since

Various depots have courtesy
phones to the MUNI office. These
can be used to get directions for
which lines to use. If the phones are
unavailable and you have not
checked your directions ahead of
time, simply ask a passing bus driver
or a native, either of whom is gener
ally helpful.
Once you know which bus numbers
to look for, you are almost at your
destination since MUNI vehicles run
frequently. You will rarely wait
longer than 10 minutes for your ride
and often will wait only a minute or
two until your bus arrives.
Rides are 60 cents each, but if you
ask for a transfer ticket when you em
bark, you can change buses without
repaying. If you arrive by BART, re
member to pick up your two free
transfers, which allow you free MUNI
rides to and from the BART station.
Pick them up before you exit the fare
gates.
Some of the mini metros can be
boarded underground, beneath
BART, while the other buses are on

street level. Don't forget to brin fo ex
act change.
But if you dislike the challenge of
public transportation and prefer a
more independent means of travel,
and if you don't mind parallel
parking, parking meters or parking
garages, then a rental car may be for
you.
For Stanford students, the most
practical agency is National Car
Rental, located at 4216 El Camino
Real. Unlike Hertz and Avis, which
require a major credit card in your
name, National asks that you be at
least 18, have a Stanford 1.D., leave a
$100 cash deposit (or have a major
credit card in your name) and, of
course, have a valid driver's license.
National, has the most
reasonable rates, which vary with the
vehicle you choose and the time you
intend to use it. Weekend rates are
the cheapest, ranging from $18.95 to
$27.95 a day, with unlimited mileage
but the requirement that the car be
returned with a full tank of gas. There
is also an optional $6-per-day insur
ance fee.
All rental agencies recommend

reserving a car at least one day in ad
vance, and often the lowest rates are
available only if this is done.
Renting a car is definitely the most
expensive option — unless you have
four or five friends who will split the
bill.
Whatever mode of transportation
you choose, always call to check fares
and schedules before you leave. San
Francisco is a lot of fun most of the
time, but not when you're stuck there
at 4 a.m. with no way home. These
numbers should keep you out of that
sort of trouble.

But if you dislike the challenge of
public transportation and prefer a

and if you don't mind parallel

For Stanford students, the most
practical agency is National Car
Rental, located at 4216 El Camino

require a major credit card in your
name, National asks that you be at
least 18, have a Stanford 1.D., leave a
$100 cash deposit (or have a major
credit card in your name) and, of
course, have a valid driver's license.
National, has the most
reasonable rates, which vary with the
vehicle you choose and the time you
intend to use it. Weekend rates are
the cheapest, ranging from $18.95 to
$27.95 a day, with unlimited mileage
but the requirement that the car be
returned with a full tank of gas. There
is also an optional $6-per-day insur
ance fee.
All rental agencies recommend

reserving a car at least one day in ad
vance, and often the lowest rates are
available only if this is done.
Renting a car is definitely the most
expensive option — unless you have
four or five friends who will split the
bill.
Whatever mode of transportation
you choose, always call to check fares
and schedules before you leave. San
Francisco is a lot of fun most of the
time, but not when you're stuck there
at 4 a.m. with no way home. These

sort of trouble.

A Bay Area Rapid Transit train speeds out of the Powell St. station. The electronic trains race throughout San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland and other Bay Area cities.
As your horizons extend beyond
the Farm, even beyond Palo Alto,
they reach northward to San Fran
cisco. The perfect day in the City
forms in your mind, but you quickly
dismiss the idea since you, like many
of us, have no wheels.
Suddenly San Francisco seems very
far, much farther than when you were
deciding whether to come to Stanford
and you read in the pre-enrollment
propoganda that "San Francisco is 35
miles to the north and offers the ur
ban pleasures of theaters, galleries,
restaurants and an extensive shop
ping district."
If you feel your desire to travel
north stifled by your lack of a car,
you'll be happy to know that there
are other inexpensive and convenient .
ways to get there.
The most easily accessible trans
portation to the City is the SamTrans
bus which departs from the El
Camino Real bus stop across from the
Stanford Shopping Center. From
there, the 7F bus line follows High
way 101 which, although not the most
scenic route, costs only $1.45 each
way.
Buses begin the hourly trip to San
Francisco at 5:17 a.m. on weekdays
and at 7:07 a.m. on weekends. After
8:37 a.m. buses run every half hour
until the 3:37 p.m., when they return
to hourly departures with the last bus
leaving at 12 :44 a.m.
The travel time by bus is nearly
twice that of driving, but the hour and
one-half passes more quickly if
shared with a book, Walkman or
friend. Be prepared to stand if you
ride during commuter hours.
When you arrive at the downtown
stops, Eighth and Mission (near the
Civic Center) or First and Mission,
the City aura hits you and the image
of the long bus ride quickly fades.
Don't forget that the last bus back to
Palo Alto leaves First and Mission at
12:49 a.m. and that the south-bound
buses leave from Seventh and Mis
sion instead of Eighth.
Earlier, the homewardbound 7F
buses leave every 10-15 minutes until
5:45 p.m. when they start leaving
once an hour.
If you really want to "get into" the
Bay Area commuting scene, you may
want to consider taking BART (Bay
Area Rapid Transit) into the City.
But since the closest BART station to
Stanford is in Daly City, using BART
first entails finding transportation to
Daly City — about 20 miles north of
campus on Interstate 280.
The 5L SamTrans bus line regu
larly leaves the Palo Alto Southern
Pacific railway station from 6:00 a.m.
until 6:30 p.m. and stops at the Daly
City BART station. The trip costs less
than a dollar, but the stop-and-go
route takes about an hour and a half.
One practical advantage of using
BART is that it offers special bicycle
permits including temporary, one
time passes. But since neither the bus
nor the train allows bikes, you need

to hitch a ride with your bike to Daly
City. If your bike collapses at the
frame, you don't need a special per
mit to take it on BART.
BART, with its space-age appear
ance and automation — replete with
machines which sell tickets that whiz
through slots and magically open
gates — is the pride of the Bay Area.
Boarding for the 20-minute ride is
self-explanatory, as well-lit signs
mark the way. The price varies on
your precise destination but never
exceeds $1.10 one way.
The seven downtown stations are
all underground and centrally lo
cated: Four are along Market Street,
two on Mission Street and one near
San Francisco City College at Geneva
and San Jose Streets.
BART runs every 15-20 minutes
from 6 a.m. until midnight Monday
through Saturday and from 9 a.m. un
til midnight on Sundays. BART is still
fairly new and promises a swift and
comfortable entry to downtown.
But if buses make you sick and you
think BART is too robotic, there is
always the train. The CalTrain leaves
from the Southern Pacific Depot off

University Avenue: a short bike ride
from campus. Don't forget to lock
your bike securely before abandoning
it for the day, or you may end up
walking home.
The train is more expensive than
the other methods of transport, with a
one-way ticket costing $3.20 and a
round trip $4.80, but it tends to be
more comfortable and roomy than
the bus.
After a smattering of dawn
departures, the train's schedule eases
into what vaguely resembles hourly
departures from 8:24 a.m. till 10:24
p.m. with a few extra trips thrown in.
The downtown stop is at Fourth and
Townsend, fairly far from centers of
interest, but along the city bus routes.
The combined network of cable
cars, the mini metro and regular
buses make up the City's transporta
tion system — better known as
MUNI.
Along such routes, MUNI can get
you from your depot (no matter
which transportation you choose) to
within a short walk of anywhere you
want to go in the City. MUNI will be
a necessary part of your journey since

Various depots have courtesy
phones to the MUNI office. These
can be used to get directions for
which lines to use. If the phones are
unavailable and you have not
checked your directions ahead of
time, simply ask a passing bus driver
or a native, either of whom is gener
ally helpful.
Once you know which bus numbers
to look for, you are almost at your
destination since MUNI vehicles run
frequently. You will rarely wait
longer than 10 minutes for your ride
and often will wait only a minute or
two until your bus arrives.
Rides are 60 cents each, but if you
ask for a transfer ticket when you em
bark, you can change buses without
repaying. If you arrive by BART, re
member to pick up your two free
