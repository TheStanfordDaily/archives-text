## Breaking away: offbeat rituals on the Farm 
### 
Most sights and experiences
around the Farm become pretty
pedestrian to students after a few
months. Tourists may "ooh" and
"aah" over Hoover Tower and
Memorial Church, but for most stu
dents these are just part of the
everyday routine.
There are a few things to do,
though, when you need a break from
the ordinary. And some students like
to get away from the sleep-study
sleep-study grind by trying one of
these activities.
The vista from the ridge near "the
Dish" — a large radio telescope in
the hills behind campus — is breath
taking and makes a sunrise or sunset
picnic in the foothills a must. Cowtip
ping — pushing over the cows that
sleep standing — is said to be another
favorite pastime, although many say
cowtipping stories are tall tales of the
"snipe hunt" genre.
Sunbathing atop Terman Engi
neering Center offers an unusual view
of the campus as well as a relaxing
study break. Stairs lead right up to
the roof, and the more driven stu
dents even set up desks there.
If one can escape both the red
shirted orientation volunteers and the
resident assistants, fountain hopping
may prove the most attractive activity
during the first week on the Farm.
Dipping in fountains such as "the
Claw" in White Plaza and"the
Hoop" in front of Green Library is an
experience not to miss.
Many talk of climbing the walls
around here. Some actually do. On
any given sunny day, one is likely to
see climbing enthusiasts clinging to

the cracks and crags of the Quad's
sandstone walls. Excellent practice
for climbing in the Sierras, some
mountaineers claim.
In the fall, Lake Lagunita is noth
ing but a myth propagated by Univer
sity bulletins and public relations
brochures. By spring, however, the
crater has metamorphosed into a lake
.. . perfect for a picnic breakfast.
For a release on a sunny day, a Cal
ifornia hybrid — frisbee golf — will
kill an afternoon in no time. Just pick
a target, preferably a stationary ob
ject rather than a female jogger, and
see how many tosses it takes to hit it.
Certain students have been seen
swinging golf clubs at a whiffle ball
among the bike racks, but this is for
the particularly desperate.
A network of steam tunnels lies un
der the University, and though the
administration frowns upon it,
"spelunking" in the tunnels has
become a campus tradition of some
groups. Legend has it that one party
of explorers even ordered a Domino's
pizza from a steam tunnel under the
.. . and it was delivered.
During Dead Week, the days just
before final exams, groups of students
gather every evening at midnight to
release therapeutic primal screams
that echo eerily across campus.
In another Dead Week ritual, the
paper ball and airplane accuracy con
test at Meyer Library, hundreds of
students tossed wads of paper from
balconies aiming for a small waste
paper basket on the library's second
floor. But three years ago the fun
ended when windows were installed
in the atrium.


The University claims it's an ail-too dangerous kind of fun, but
spelunking in Stanford's subterranean heating system is rumored to be

Brock La Porte/Daily
a popular student activity. Traversing the underground labyrinth at
night could result in a steamy situation.
