## When another dorm meal is just too much 
### 
There are many restaurants in the
area at which you can get good food
without having to dish out major
bucks. Following is a list of places that
fall neatly into that category.
The Dutch Goose
3567 Alameda de las Pugas
Menlo Park
854-3245
The Goose serves beer, burgers
and a few other dishes in that beer
hall atmosphere, complete with
plenty of peanuts on the floor, where
students thrive. If you go there on a
Saturday night, you're sure to see stu
dents playing pool, watching TV or
sitting in one of the dark wooden
booths to do some serious consuming.
The Alpine Inn
(Zott's)
Alpine Road
Portola Valley
Formerly Rosotti's, hence the
nickname Zott's, the Alpine Inn is a
favorite beer and burger place, espe
cially in the summer when they can be
enjoyed outside on picnic tables in
the beer garden. Some say Zott's has
the best cheeseburgers, served on
sourdough French rolls, in the area.
They also have salads and sand
wiches.
(Ask someone for directions and ride
your bike there.)
Ramona's
541 Ramona
Palo Alto
326-2220
The pizza here won a recent Daily
taste test, but Ramona's has more
than just pizza. Ramona's also serves
good hamburgers and subs and excel
lent calzone. The salad bar is one of
the best around, although old-timers
say it isn't what it once was.

Late for the Train
561 Oak Grove
Menlo Park
321-6124
Cozy personal atmosphere and me
ticulous attention to the freshness and
fine preparation of wholesome food
have made Late for the Train "the
place" for Sunday brunch in the area.
Late for the Train has a regular fol
lowing because of both its food
quality and its moderate prices. The
only drawback might be a short wait,
although even the wait is made more
pleasant by the complimentary tea
and coffee.
Each table is decorated with lace
and a floral arrangement. An assort
ment of plants and decorations on the
walls gives the restaurant the look of
"Grandma's place" without being
overdone.
Three cheese omelettes cost $4.25.
What could be just a normal dish
becomes special with the addition of
cream cheese and chives. Many other
omelettes are available and cost
about $5. They are served with cubed
potatoes sauteed with onions.
V Sauteed fish and eggs, fresh fruit
dishes and French toast are a few of
the other breakfast choices. A variety
of sandwiches and salads are
available for lunch. Late for the Train
is not open for dinner.
Pear Williams
150 Middlefield Road
Menlo Park
323-8445
Pear Williams has a reputation in
the area for having some of the finest
French food around, and it deserves
that accolade.
The dishes are impeccably
prepared and the owner himself

watches over the restaurant to make
sure everything is up to his high
standards. The name Pear Williams
comes from the house's dessert
specialty, which is fresh poached pear
half on a bed of vanilla ice cream with
homemade caramel sauce.
The atmosphere is calm and com
fortable. Four or five individually
carved booths painted with a variety
of pastel colors give the restaurant a
unique look that is neither too casual
nor stuffy.
Entrees range in price from $9.50
to $15.95 and include truite
Grenoblaise (sauteed trout with
brown butter lemon and capers), co
quilles St. Jacques au eresson (fresh
poached scallops in a sauce of creme
fraiche and watercress) and filet mig
non de boeuf aux eehalotes (sauteed
medallions of beef in demi-glace and
cream). All entrees include soup,
salad and bread.
The lunch menu Offers Pear's
burger ($5.95), a fruit and cheese
board ($5.50), crepes ($5.95), fresh
filet of sole ($7.95) and many other
French specialties. Sunday brunch is
also a favorite here.
Grand China
5100 El Camino Real
Los Alias 4Url
uwlnKv Jf / „
Grand China is a better than
average Chinese restaurant in an area
with no shortage of them.
The sweet and sour shrimp and
scallops with garlic sauce are two of
the best dishes available from the
large and diverse menu.
What sets Grand China apart is
that it is one of the few restaurants on
the midpeninsula that serve weekend
dim sum. This affordable feast is
great for a large group. The dim sum

menu lists forty items which are
usually quite low in price — they start
at 70 cents. Simply mark all your sug
gestions and return your menu to the
waiter.
The fun thing is that you can order
a large number of choices, such as
steamed or fried dough treats filled
with potstickers.
The prices for the more traditional
Mandarin dishes range from $4 to $8.
Restaurant Des Alpes
201 California Avenue
Palo Alto % Jr
326-4112
You can't argue with staying
power, and Des Alpes has it. The res
taurant is quietly .tucked away on Cal
ifornia Avenue, but a regular clien
tele has been going there for years.
The attraction of Des Alpes is a
warm European atmosphere and
moderate prices for complete dinners
and fine daily specfals. It also has
great red cabbage, which is a real find
for those who love it.
The restaurant looks like a Swiss
chalet outside. The inside consists of
two rooms, one with a wine collection
that covers the entire wall. Ask the
wine steward for advice. He
his stuff. / I S .
A fresh seafood special is available
each day. The chicken selections from
the menu are chicken toscana
($8.50), which is chicken served with
a sauce of artichoke hearts, olives;
tomatoes, mushrooms and green pep
pers, and chicken breast a la excelsior
($8.95), which is breast of chicken
Stuffed with pate in a port wine sauce.
Swiss specialties like beef roulade
($8.50), sliced beef stuffed with mus
tard, onions, pickles and bacon ]
served in a gravy and Swiss bratwurst
($6.75) with red cabbage are also

good choices. There is also a New
York steak ($10.95) on the regular
menu.
Closed Mondays.
Maddalena's
544 Emerson Street
Palo Alto
326-6082
The scenario: An incredibly fussy
grandmother, father or flame wants
to go out to dinner and you must
choose a place that will not disap
point them.
You're safe with Maddalena's.
Both Italian and French specialties
are served in a gracious continental
atmosphere where attention to
proper decorum is a certainty.
Maddelena's can accommodate the
dressiest occasion with its white linen,
huge chandelier and bevelled mirrors.
But it is not stuffy. One room is espe
cially warm, with dark wood and
spotlights on French can-can posters.
Another nice touch is provided by a
classical guitar player.
PkEverything on the menu is a la
carte, which is ultimately more ex
pensive but also more fun. You might
start with escargots bourguigonnes
cherrystone clams ($6.25) or
delicious French onion au gratin soup
($3.50) instead of the usual salad.
If you like a more intimate meal, a
small room can be reserved for an in
timate party of two.
Caravansary
321 Stanford Shopping Center
Palo Alto
327-2682
Walking into Caravansary, you're
greeted with a slight sense of confu
sion. On the one hand, the shop
seems to resemble an old country
store: Baskets adorn the walls and

ceiling and a wide array of coffees,
teas and sweets is available behind an
old-fashioned counter.
But this first impression is soon
shattered by the high, modern
ceilings and sidewalk cafe atmos
phere generated by the cobbled floor
and tables carefully placed in the
front of the shop near a large window.
Caravansary is more than a good
restaurant — it is an ideal store
where you can find excellent picnic
supplies. It offers 45 international
cheeses as well as pates, deli sand
wiches, drinks and desserts.
Dishes available include briochky
($5), moussaka ($4) and spinach filo
pie ($5.75). All the dessert portions
are large, and the pecan pie, varieties
of cake, cheesecake and torte are all
good buys at $2.85.
The Old Clamhouse
355 State Street
Los Altos
941-8199
If your palate is looking for a
change from Palo Alto's offerings,
then this Los Altos seafood restau
rant is the perfect solution.
Easy to spot with its yacht club
royal blue awning, The Old Clam
house offers a casual and friendly at
mosphere and prompt service. You'll
receive a basket of fresh bread and
clam broth for bread-dipping as you
scan the menu and the chalkboard,
which lists the daily specials and fresh
fish choices.
House specialties include steamed
clams ($7.95) and clam house linguini
($6.95). The clams are served with a
delightful garlic vinaigrette and the
portion size is just right for two to
share.
Upon request, waiters will serve
mud pie direct from the Baskin-Rob
bins down the block.
There are many restaurants in the

Maddalena's
544 Emerson Street
Palo Alto
326-6082
The scenario: An incredibly fussy
grandmother, father or flame wants
to go out to dinner and you must
choose a place that will not disap
point them.
You're safe with Maddalena's.
Both Italian and French specialties
are served in a gracious continental
atmosphere where attention to
proper decorum is a certainty.
Maddelena's can accommodate the
dressiest occasion with its white linen,
huge chandelier and bevelled mirrors.
But it is not stuffy. One room is espe
cially warm, with dark wood and
spotlights on French can-can posters.
Another nice touch is provided by a
classical guitar player.
PkEverything on the menu is a la
carte, which is ultimately more ex
pensive but also more fun. You might
start with escargots bourguigonnes
cherrystone clams ($6.25) or
delicious French onion au gratin soup
($3.50) instead of the usual salad.
If you like a more intimate meal, a
small room can be reserved for an in
timate party of two.
Caravansary
321 Stanford Shopping Center
Palo Alto
327-2682
Walking into Caravansary, you're
greeted with a slight sense of confu
sion. On the one hand, the shop
seems to resemble an old country
store: Baskets adorn the walls and

ceiling and a wide array of coffees,
teas and sweets is available behind an
old-fashioned counter.
But this first impression is soon
shattered by the high, modern
ceilings and sidewalk cafe atmos
phere generated by the cobbled floor
and tables carefully placed in the
front of the shop near a large window.
Caravansary is more than a good
restaurant — it is an ideal store
where you can find excellent picnic
supplies. It offers 45 international
cheeses as well as pates, deli sand
wiches, drinks and desserts.
Dishes available include briochky
($5), moussaka ($4) and spinach filo
pie ($5.75). All the dessert portions
are large, and the pecan pie, varieties
of cake, cheesecake and torte are all
good buys at $2.85.

Easy to spot with its yacht club
royal blue awning, The Old Clam

clams ($7.95) and clam house linguini
($6.95). The clams are served with a
