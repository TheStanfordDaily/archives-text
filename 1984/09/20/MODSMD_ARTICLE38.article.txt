## University libraries Havens for quiet and reading 
### 
During your first week on campus,
you'll be so busy meeting your
roommates and new friends, going to
orientation activities, buying books
and worrying about classes that you
probably won't get around to taking
the 20-minute guided tour of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
But sooner or later you will prob
ably wander there and ask an array of
questions about using libraries on
campus. This article, a helpful but in
complete list of the libraries available
to students here, will provide you
with an introduction to what may
prove your favorite refuge from the
noise and constant activity of your
dormitory.
Eleven University libraries and six
coordinate libraries present students
with a vast store of information, in
cluding manuscripts, maps, sound
recordings, periodicals, microtexts,
photographs, government documents
and more than 4.5 million books.
About half of all library staffers
here work at Green Library. Green
contains a general reference service,
the University Archives, the current
Periodicals and Microtexts room, the
government documents collection,

the Central Map collection, a section
called Special Collections and the
main research collection of the Uni
versity libraries.
In Special Collections, students can
examine such diverse materials as
Shakespeare's folios and the personal
correspondence of writers like John
Steinbeck.
Green is one of the more modern
libraries here (the East Wing was
completed in 1980), and students
must show identification to gain
entry.
Inside Green Library are lockers,
study carrels, countless shelves of
books and incredibly comfortable
chairs. Since Green has more space
than all the other libraries on campus,
there is usually a good chance of fin
ding a free semi-isolated desk or chair
at which to do serious studying.
Meyer Undergraduate Library,
known by the pseudo-acronym
UGLY, contains language laborato
ries, audio-visual services, a periodi
cals room, a file containing copies of
midterm and final exams for various
classes, lockers and carrels, and it is
the only place one can obtain reserve
reading assigned for classes.

Meyer also has several Copicard
copying machines, electric and
manual typewriters and calculators
for student use.
Undergraduates tend to favor
Meyer over other libraries because
the reserve reading and most of their
friends are always there. As a result
of the wild throngs that populate the
three study floors and Meyer's collec
tion of the loudest pieces of furniture
ever assembled under one roof,
Meyer is much noisier than nearby
Green Library.
The Art and Architecture Library,
in the Nathan Cummings Art Build

ing, contains books on art and ar
chitectural history, paintings, a spe
cial Chinese arc collection and inter
esting graphic art.
The Frederic M. Falconer Biology
Library, on the third floor of Herrin
Hall in the Biological Sciences Cen
ter, holds various materials on
botany, zoology and experimental
fields of biology.
The Swain Library of Chemistry, in
Room One of the Chemistry building,
has numerous books on chemistry
and materials about the chemical and
petroleum industries.
The Cubberley Library of Educa
tion, on the second floor of the Edu

cation building, offers books, docu
ments, periodicals, pamphlets,
microforms, dissertations and other
materials on education.
The Branner Earth Sciences Li
brary, on the second floor of the
Mitchell Earth Sciences building, has
materials on geology, geophysics,
mineral and petroleum engineering,
geological maps, U.S. Geological
Survey topographical sheets, a stun
ning mineral collection, and a more
powerful air coolant system than is
found in most refrigerators.
The Engineering Library, in Ter
man Engineering Center, has an

enormous collection of books on en
gineering. The Guggenheim Space
Sciences Library contains collections
on aeronautics and astronautics,
radio science and electrical engineer
ing.
The Mathematical and Computer
Science Library, in Room 384 of the
Quad, has books on math, statistics
and computer theory and application.
The Physics Library, in Room 300
of the Varian building, houses the
Hansen Microwave Laboratory,
which contains materials on micro
wave physics and engineering and
also the Plasma Physics Institute.
