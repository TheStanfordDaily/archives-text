## Attaining loftier ideals 
### 
For those of you who passed wood
shop (do they still offer that in high
school?), here's a diversion of sorts
that will help you to make maximum
use of your tiny University housing
quarters.
In case you're not familiar with the
term, lofts are beds on stilts, so to
speak. They may be very simple
structures designed to enhance
storage space or finely crafted pieces
of furniture adding a touch of class to
your modest accomodations.
As an example of the many differ
ent types of lofts built throughout
campus, some favorites here include
single lofts for one bed, double lofts
for two, "L-shaped" lofts with a mez
zanine for studying and reading, split
level lofts, and lofts with built-in bars,
staircases and even waterbeds.
Lofts are a fairly recent invention
which has become increasingly
popular in the past ten years or so.
The dorm with the most lofts each
year is usually Toyon, due to its ca
thedralesque ceilings which tend to
give loftless residents the "closing-in
walls" feeling.
If you don't want to spend the
money to buy a ready-made loft, it's
not difficult to build one yourself.
Lumber and tools are available from
local merchants, and tools like power
saws and drills can be rented easily.
"So how do I build my own loft?"
you ask.
The basic ingredients of a one
story, single bed loft are:
• a 4xB sheet of plywood at least 3 /s
inch thick (fiber board is heavy and
cumbersome)
• 4x4 posts cut to the desired height
• 2x4 or 2x6 boards to support the
plywood, and Ix 4 or 2x4 boards to
use as cross-bracing to prevent sway
• joist hangers
• nails (or wood screws) and lag bolts
• a carpet to finish off the platform.
The first thing to build is the frame

to support the platform.
There are two basic frames from
which to choose: (1) a frame of 2x4's
with outside dimensions of 4xB ft., or
(2) a 2x6 or 2xB outer frame with
inside dimensions of 4xB ft.
The advantage of the second one is
that the plywood may be set inside
the outer frame, leaving a rim around
the platform which not only keeps the
mattress from sliding off but
precludes the use of nails to anchor
the plywood to the frame. This saves
set-up and tear-down time.

Lofts may be
finely crafted
pieces of furniture
adding a touch of
class to your
modest accom
modations.

For both frames (1) and (2), cut the
corners so the shorter 2x4's fit inside
the long ones. The nicest and easiest
way to secure the outside corners,
though slightly more expensive, is to
use lag bolts (which can be found at
any hardware store).
At each end of the long boards drill
two holes into the face. Make the
diameter of the holes smaller than
that of the bolt. Make sure the lag
bolts are long enough to extend into
the end of the shorter boards and
provide a strong joint.
The next step for both (1) and (2)
is to install joists at 20-inch intervals
to support the platform. Be sure to
leave at least four inches clear at each

end for the loft legs.
Joists are usually 2x4's supported
by joist hangers anchored to the long
boards of the frame. The joists must
provide a level surface for the
plywood platform.
For a 2x4 outer frame (1), make
sure the joist hangers are nailed in so
that the inner 2x4 joists will fit flush
with the top of the frame. First, mea
sure and mark position of the joist
hangers with a small 2x4 block.
Now cut the 2x4 joists to fit snugly
within the outer frame, resting on the
joist hangers. As long as the corners
are secure, the joists need not be
nailed.
On frames with top-flush joists (1),
plywood platforms must be nailed or
screwed down. For a loft with a wide
outer frame (2), the plywood plat
form may be set on top of the joists
inside the frame.
Next, the legs must be installed and
braced. Use 4x4 posts. Set them
inside the frame at the corners, with
the top of the posts on the same level
as the joists. You can lean the plat
form against the wall for this step.
Drill holes for at least two lag bolts
per leg, or use at least four "16-
penny" nails.
Braces should run diagonally from
the top of one leg to the bottom of the
opposite leg. From the long side, use
a 2x4 for the diagonal brace; on the
ends, a Ix 4 is fine.
If you want built-in shelves, cut a
2x4 or 2x6 to fit between the legs and
nail or bolt it in. This will also give
added support.
For a ladder, cut several blocks of
equal length for stairs (the wider the
nicer). Cut two more 2x4's for ladder
uprights (avoid splintery wood) and
mark off steps at regular intervals.
The ladder can be nailed together
since it's small enough to store.
Now your loft should be ready to
sand, stain, carpet and enjoy.
