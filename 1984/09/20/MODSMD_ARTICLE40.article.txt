## Be glad you're not a Berkeley weenie 
### JANE BAILIE 
"There's nowhere like Ber
zerkeley!" students of the University
of California at Berkeley laughingly
exclaim as they weave their way down
Telegraph Avenue, many of them
seemingly oblivious to their sur
roundings, treating each new human
"obstacle" as something to be
ignored.
The city of Berkeley, home of
Stanford's longtime rival, Cal, has
been known to attract some of the
more eccentric personalities of the
local area. The shops and streets are
painted with a certain amount of
"human color," some of it psyc
hedelic.
The "Red Man" can be seen vir
tually any day parading through the
Berkeley streets, dressed completely
from head to toe in a vibrant shade of
scarlet, carrying on his back a stuffed
puppet the size of a small child.
"Crazy William" is rumored to
have been a philosophy graduate stu
dent who "went over the edge." He
painted his clothes and face with
dollar-size red polka dots and now
camps out on Telegraph making faces
at people and drawing attention to
himself any way he can.
"You have to be normal to stand

out at Berkeley," many freshmen are
told, and despite the large student
population, many often find this the
case.
Berkeley is still a mecca for politi
cal demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go unnoticed. Sup
porters of everything from the nu
clear freeze to sailing classes establish
themselves in Sproul Plaza, a focal
point of the Cal campus. During the
late morning and early afternoon, it is
difficult to cross this stretch of pave
ment without being asked to sign any
number of political petitions.
Although many of those new to the
area may find this process intimidat
ing, the majority of students tend to
develop "defense tactics" to ward off
the more adamant demonstrators.
Clutching textbooks and notepads,
students can be seen with heads bent
and eyes focused firmly on the
ground in front of them as they stride
quickly through a crowd of petition
bearing activists.
The majority of those persons of
ten considered "unusual" are in
reality harmless, provided they are
not provoked. Residents offer visiting
outsiders a piece of advice for safety:
"Whatever you do or see, always
avoid eye contact!"
