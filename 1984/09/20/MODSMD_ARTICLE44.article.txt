## Elway Era II begins But will a change in coaches – and attitude – be enough? sports 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Think of the 1983 Stanford foot
ball season and a few words come to
mind. Words like awful. Or dis
astrous. Or horrible, atrocious and
dreadful. Or just plain bad.
Or, if you're a Stanford football
player or coach, "forgettable" will do
fine.
Not only did the Cardinal lose 10
of 11 games (its worst record since
the 1960 squad went 0-10), it lost its
head coach. Paul Wiggin, who still
has a year remaining in his five-year
contract, either resigned, was forced
to resign or was fired with two games
left in the season, depending on who
you talk to.
Stanford also lost eight starters
(four each from the offense and
defense) and a total of 22 lettermen
from last year's squad, making the
outlook for the 1984 season that
much bleaker.
But besides the 27 freshmen that
reported to camp this summer, Stan
ford made one addition that may cure
its recent gridiron maladies. In Wig
gin's four-year tenure, three years of
which had all-everything quarterback
John Elway attending classes and
throwing touchdown passes, the Car
dinal was a miserable 16-28. One
winning season (6-5 in 1980), three
losing seasons and no trips to post
season bowl games. (For the record,
Stanford was slated to go to the Hall
of Fame Bowl in 1982, but a wild,

game-ending kick-off return involv
ing five laterals, God knows how
many players, a band and a whole lot
of controversy effectively ended
those howl hopes.)
To get back to the story, three of
Stanford's last 23 losses have come to
San Jose State in successive years.
Ironically, the Spartans' coach was
John Elway's dad, Jack. And finally,
after three years of frustration, Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger decided,
"if you can't beat him, hire him, and
named Elway, Sr., Stanford's 28th
head football coach last December.
Elway brings more than a football
philosophy of wide-open offense and
solid, aggressive defense with him.
He brings a different attitude to the
Farm. To say the least, Elway doesn't
fit the "Stanford image," if such a
thing even exists.
He is as unflashy a dresser as his of
fense is flashy. Ties aren't mandatory
on team busses. He smokes like Dean
Martin drinks, prefers phrases like
"goddamn" to "ah shucks," and has a
natural, down-home sense of humor
which he is not afraid to unleash. As a
San Francisco columnist aptly put it
last year, Elway opts for beer and
nachos over wine and cheese.
But it's this new attitude, this al
most innovative (at least to Stanford),
carefree atmosphere that could be the
difference in 1984.
And sophomore quarterback John
Paye, who bears a striking

resemblance to Elway, Jr., both in
looks and play, couldn't agree more.
"1 think practices are much more
loose and much more relaxed than
last year," he said at a pre-season
press conference." I he coaching staff
doesn't seem to be under as much
pressure.
"Last year, if a play didn't work in
practice, it was, Why didn't that
work?' and we'd keep trying it,"he
continued. "But this year, if some
thing doesn't work. Coach Elway
says, 'Forget it, let's try something
else.' "
But the question remains, will El
way and company run out ot
"something elses" to try? Or, in other
words, is 1984 a rebuilding season?
Elway answers that without batting
an eyelash or adjusting the red Stan
ford baseball cap that is a fixture on
his head at practice. "Number one,
I'm too goddamn old. I've been at
this too long for rebuilding seasons.
And, number two, I'm not going to
insult 72 (returning) football
players."
But Jack, Stanford was 1-10 last
year. Not much has changed besides
the coaching staff. Do you really ex
pect to do much better?
"1 think everyone goes down the
schedule each year and puts a 'w' next
to one game and an T next to an
other," he said. "I think everyone is
going to put a 'w' next to us and that's
to our advantage. I think we're going

to surprise some teams.
And if Stanford wins more than
three games this season, it will have
surprised "some teams." In what
seems to have become somewhat of a
tradition, the Cardinal once again has
a schedule that makes climbing Mt.
Everest look easy. Eight of Stanford's
11 opponents are potential top-20
teams at season's end. Five of them
(Oklahoma, Arizona State, UCLA,
USC and Washington) were on the
Associated Press pre-season top-20
list and a sixth — defending Big 10
champ Illinois — wasn t ranked be
cause it's on probation.
Elway's biggest obstacle after the
schedule will be restoring the Card's
offense to its once explosive self. As a
team last season, Stanford rushed for
825 yards on 336 carries, a meager
2.4 yards per carry average. The pass
ing game was better, but not by much.
Card quarterbacks did throw nine
more interceptions than touchdown
passes (24 to 15).
Elway will try to improve the run
ning game with an expanded
playbook that includes his patented
misdirection and "trick" plays. He
hopes to beef up the passing attack
with more quick-hitting plays and
criss-cross patterns.
Paye, who broke all of John El
way's freshman passing records last
season, will obviously be the focus of
