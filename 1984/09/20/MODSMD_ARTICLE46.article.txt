## A 						rundown of trails 
### 
Every day at Stanford, hundieds of
students, professors, administrators
and other local residents take to the
running trails that thread through
campus and the surrounding foothills.
The central campus and its en
virons boast some of the most varied
and challenging runs in the Bay Area.
A partial list of favorite courses fol
lows.
There are two Par Courses on
campus, one starting near Angell
Field and the other near Roble Hall.
Each consists of a series of fitness ex
ercises staggered over a two-mile
course.
The Lake Lagunita Run covers
about 1.5 miles. Run toward the lake
on Lagunita Drive, keeping the
parking lot and the Bechtel Interna
tional Center on your left. Cross
Lomita Drive and run up a short hill
to the Boathouse. Take a left onto the
path between the Lambda Nu house
and the lake. Follow the path all the
way around the lake until you cross a
small creek. Run along the fence until
you hit the pathway around the lake.
Return to the Boathouse.
University President Donald Ken
nedy welcomes running partners of
all speeds to "run the Dish" (a path
that passes a dish-shaped radio
satellite receiver in the hills behind
campus) with him early each morn
ing. Meet behind Hoover House,
where Santa Ynez Street deadends
into Cabrillo Avenue. Call Kennedy's

office to find out what time the run
ners are meeting.
If you prefer solitude on the long
run, take Campus Drive until it hits
Junipero Serra Boulevard, enter the
fenced area, and head for the Dish on
your own. The upward-sloping road
to the Dish diverges at one point: The
right fork is a gentler and longer slope
to the top of the grade. Take a sharp
turn to the left at the top of the hill
and run along the ridge for about a
mile or so. Proceed down the hill, al
ways bearing to the right. At the bot
tom of the hill, cross Junipero Serra
and run down Frenchman's Road to
Mayfield Avenue. Turn left of
Mayfield and return to Campus Drive
to complete the five-mile course.
To begin the 11-mile Arastradero
Loop, start down Campus Drive past
Wilbur Field. Turn right on Bowdoin
Street. Turn right again on Stanford
Avenue and follow it until you cross
Junipero Serra. Turn left on Junipero
Serra and follow it until you reach
Old Page Mill Road. Take a right on
Page Mill and run along it until you
cross. Arastradero Road. Turn right
and follow Arastradero out about two
miles until you reach the "Zot's" in
tersection on Alpine Road. Turn
right and follow Alpine back past the
Ladera Shopping Center. Turn right
onto Junipero Serra. Follow Junipero
Serra back past the lake and onto
Campus Drive.
