## Intramurals: athletics, excitement for the rest of us 
### CLAY CALVERT 
Watching a Cardinal football game
on a Saturday afternoon or a basket
ball victory over a Pacific-10 pow
er definitely is an exciting part of life
at Stanford. And something inside
each of us watching a game from the
stands, especially those who played
on a high school team, makes one
want to jump up and join in the game.
Well, take heart, fellow, frustrated
high school jocks. Intramural sports
at Stanford are big. Very big. And it's
quite likely that the sport you played
in high school is offered on the Farm.
You can also try your hand at some
thing new, perhaps ultimate frisbee or
inner-tube water polo, both offered
in the spring.
Intramurals are fun, but they're
also serious business. Sometimes you
feel as though you're in one of those
Michelob Light commercials where
you play like you never have before
because you can taste that cool,
refreshing brew as you sweat your
guts out.
More than 6,000 students partici
pate in intramurals at some point in
the school year, either in individual
sports such as tennis or in a team ac
tivity like football. Nearly all fresh
man teams are dorm-oriented, as
RAs organize sign-ups for the various
sports at house meetings. Most of the
fraternities approach IMs with a zeal
surpassed only by the fervor exerted
in their partying. Last year's overall
IM champion, Death From Above, is
an independent team comprised of
students who lived together as fresh
men.

To determine the overall cham
pion, points are awarded based on a
team's finish in each sport. The cap
tain of the winning team is pre
sented with a trophy symbolic of the

accomplishment at the first home
football game of the season the fol
lowing fall.
During fall, the big IM sport at
Stanford is seven-man, two-hand

touch football. There are approxi
mately 25 football leagues, each con
taining six teams. The sport, played at
both an A and B level, also includes
coed and women's teams, with the

coed version being particularly
popular among freshmen.
Four-player volleyball is another
popular fall activity on the Farm.
Even if you're not from the beaches

of Southern California or have never
seen a volleyball game other than
those during the Olympics, give this
sport a try. Your roommates just
might think you some kind of athletic
deity if you sacrifice your body while
diving for a ball.
Other fall sports include pingpong,
billiards and three-on-three basket
ball.
During the winter, men's and wo
men's five-on-five basketball domi
nates the IM scene. Not only does this
sport offer the greatest number of
leagues, but it is also one of the most
competitive games at the University.
This is your opportunity to play on
the hardwood of Maples Pavilion,
presenting a chance to emulate your
favorite NBA players. Games take
place in the evening, allowing you to
take out your aggressions in a con
trolled environment after a frustrat
ing day.
For those of you looking for some
thing relaxing to play in the spring,
try softball. This really is for you
beer-leaguers out there who like to
replace the bodily fluids you lost
during the game with a six-pack of
Henry's. Don't take the sport too
lightly, however, as many teams are
out for blood.
For those of you who don't like
team sports, try something fairly indi
vidual, such as IM tennis. The IM
tournaments really do provide a taste
of competitiveness somewhere other
than the classroom. There are singles,
doubles and mixed doubles at A and
B levels. Just playing on the courts
where McEnroe once stroked kind of
inspires you to play well.
