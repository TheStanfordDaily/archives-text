## Card basketball: a rebuilding year? sports 
### JASON COLE 
The third chapter of the Tom Davis
basketball story at Stanford could be
titled. "Transition and Question."
Davis has the task of replacing 56
percent of the Cardinal's offense.
Gone from last year's 19-12 team
(8-10 in the Pacific-10 Conference)
are the team's top two scorers, center
John Revelli and guard Keith Jones.
Along with fellow graduate Hans
Wichary, they averaged 41.5 of the
team's 74.5 points game.
The obvious question is, who will
replace the scoring of Jones and
Revelli?
As yet, that question has no
definitive answer and one problem is
that it may never be answered. But
Coach Davis has a history of answer
ing big questions, such as how to
make Stanford a winner.
Last season marked the first win
ning record for the Cardinal in 11
years. The team may have come
closer to receiving a post-season
tournament bid than at any time since
the last time it was in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
Tournament.
And the last time was, well, a
mighty long time ago. To be exact, 42
years have passed since Stanford won
the 1942 NCAA Championship.
That's a longer drought than the
Chicago Cubs have had.
Unfortunately that drought is likely
to continue, at least for this year. The
Cardinal is predicted to come in ninth
in the Pac-10. Unlike the rest of the
conference, Stanford lost a great deal
to graduation.
Washington State, which is also in a
rebuilding year, is likely to join Stan-
Ion! at the bottom of the conference.
Davis agreed with that general assess
ment but indicated that the confer

ence should be both improved and
exciting.
"Washington has the edge, but not
a great edge. . .. Any of the top eight
teams in the conference could have a
reasonable shot at it," Davis said.
The balance in the conference will
also improve the teams that do well.
"The winner of Pac-10 is going to be
tested every time it plays. That's
going to give it more experience
and make it better ready for post
season play."
But back to the scoring dilemma.
Davis doesn't seem to have one an
swer to the question of scoring. The
possibilities seem endless, but the
players are inexperienced.
The top prospect to fill the scoring
void is senior guard Steve Brown.
Brown was the team's third leading
scorer last season, averaging 10.9
ppg. As a junior, the 6-foot-2 Brown
switched off between guard and small
forward during the season.
Davis has tremendous confidence
in Brown, saying bluntly, "He could
be the top scorer in the Pac-10." That
assessment may seem a bit brash, but
there is ample reason for it.
Brown was probably the Cardinal's
best outside shooter last year. Shoot
ing mostly from the perimeter, he had
the third best field goal percentage
(.541) on the team. Revelli and for
ward Earl Koberlein were the only
ones to better him, but they shot
mostly from the inside.
"He didn't get a lot of shots last
year because we had a couple of great
scorers," Davis explained. "But this
year he'll see the ball a lot more.
Brown will probably be looked to
more by his teammates, who "have
tremendous respect for him.'' He was

John Revelli (44) and Keith Jones (00) will be sorely missed by Coach
Tom Davis this year. The two were both named to the all Pacific-10
Conference team for the 1983-84 season and drafted by the Los An-

geles Lakers last June. Revelli's strength inside and Jones's quickness
helped the Cardinal to attain its best record in a decade, highlighted
by a stunning victory at home over perennial Pac-10 power UCLA.
