## Card basketball: a rebuilding year? sports 
### JASON COLE 
The third chapter of the Tom Davis
basketball story at Stanford could be
titled. "Transition and Question."
Davis has the task of replacing 56
percent of the Cardinal's offense.
Gone from last year's 19-12 team
(8-10 in the Pacific-10 Conference)
are the team's top two scorers, center
John Revelli and guard Keith Jones.
Along with fellow graduate Hans
Wichary, they averaged 41.5 of the
team's 74.5 points game.
The obvious question is, who will
replace the scoring of Jones and
Revelli?
As yet, that question has no
definitive answer and one problem is
that it may never be answered. But
Coach Davis has a history of answer
ing big questions, such as how to
make Stanford a winner.
Last season marked the first win
ning record for the Cardinal in 11
years. The team may have come
closer to receiving a post-season
tournament bid than at any time since
the last time it was in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
Tournament.
And the last time was, well, a
mighty long time ago. To be exact, 42
years have passed since Stanford won
the 1942 NCAA Championship.
That's a longer drought than the
Chicago Cubs have had.
Unfortunately that drought is likely
to continue, at least for this year. The
Cardinal is predicted to come in ninth
in the Pac-10. Unlike the rest of the
conference, Stanford lost a great deal
to graduation.
Washington State, which is also in a
rebuilding year, is likely to join Stan-
Ion! at the bottom of the conference.
Davis agreed with that general assess
ment but indicated that the confer

ence should be both improved and
exciting.
"Washington has the edge, but not
a great edge. . .. Any of the top eight
teams in the conference could have a
reasonable shot at it," Davis said.
The balance in the conference will
also improve the teams that do well.
"The winner of Pac-10 is going to be
tested every time it plays. That's
going to give it more experience
and make it better ready for post
season play."
But back to the scoring dilemma.
Davis doesn't seem to have one an
swer to the question of scoring. The
possibilities seem endless, but the
players are inexperienced.
The top prospect to fill the scoring
void is senior guard Steve Brown.
Brown was the team's third leading
scorer last season, averaging 10.9
ppg. As a junior, the 6-foot-2 Brown
switched off between guard and small
forward during the season.
Davis has tremendous confidence
in Brown, saying bluntly, "He could
be the top scorer in the Pac-10." That
assessment may seem a bit brash, but
there is ample reason for it.
Brown was probably the Cardinal's
best outside shooter last year. Shoot
ing mostly from the perimeter, he had
the third best field goal percentage
(.541) on the team. Revelli and for
ward Earl Koberlein were the only
ones to better him, but they shot
mostly from the inside.
"He didn't get a lot of shots last
year because we had a couple of great
scorers," Davis explained. "But this
year he'll see the ball a lot more.
Brown will probably be looked to
more by his teammates, who "have
tremendous respect for him.'' He was

John Revelli (44) and Keith Jones (00) will be sorely missed by Coach
Tom Davis this year. The two were both named to the all Pacific-10
Conference team for the 1983-84 season and drafted by the Los An-


Greg Webb/Daily
geles Lakers last June. Revelli's strength inside and Jones's quickness
helped the Cardinal to attain its best record in a decade, highlighted
by a stunning victory at home over perennial Pac-10 power UCLA.
voted captain of this year's squad by
his peers. If Brown produces the
scoring that the Cardinal needs, that
respect may grow.
After Brown, the Cardinal's inex
perience really starts to show. Davis
named junior Koberlein as another
possible player to pick up the scoring
slack. But aside from being last year's
best field goal shooter (.653), he was
really just the highest scorer among a
plethora of low contributors.
Koberlein averaged 6.1 ppg and
4.4 rebounds per game as a starter
last season. At 6-5, 202 pounds,
Davis has him slotted for either
power or small forward.
Junior Keith Ramee started 18
games at point guard last year and is
likely to retain that spot at the
season's start. Ramee was second in

assists to Jones with 82, but his
noticeable reluctance to shoot cost
him court time.
He will get some fierce competition
from sophomores Novian Whitsitt
and John Paye. Whitsitt is another
point for optimism, according to
Davis, "I think Novian will be a great
scorer." But Davis adds, "Whether
that's this year or next, I don't
know."
Paye, who is better known as the
Cardinal quarterback during football
season, started the 13 games that
Ramee did not. He was capable, but
like Ramee, not much of a scoring
threat. He averaged 3.3 ppg.
Junior John Williams and freshman
Steve Meinert should also vie for
playing time at guard. Williams has
gotten limited playing time so far but
will get every opportunity to exhibit
his talents during the preseason
scrimmages.
Meinert, from South Salem, Ore.,
averaged 23.7 ppg and shot over 50
percent from the field as a senior. He
shot a blistering 61 percent to lead

South Salem High School to second
place in the state tournament.
At the center and forward posi
tions, two freshmen could make sig
nificant contributions immediately.
Eric Reveno, a local product from
Menlo School in Menlo Park, will
compete for the starting tenter spot
with seniors Neil Johnson and Kent
Seymour, as well as sophomore
Grady Johnson.
Standing 6-8, 250, Reveno may not
have the height to play center but
clearly; has the size to handle "the
kind of traffic in the middle in the
Pac-10," Davis said. He averaged
20.7 ppg and 11.0 rpg at Menlo (the
same school which produced Paye).
At forward, freshman Greg Butler
will vie for time with senior Charles
Hunt, junior Andy Fischer and soph
omore Doug Wall. Although taller
than Reveno at 6-11, Butler is not as
strong and is a better outside shooter.
"He's really a true forward," Davis
said.
Butler averaged 18.9 ppg and 11.0
rpg at Rolling Hills High School in

Southern California. He may have
some added incentive since his bro
ther, David, is a forward for arch-rival
University of California at Berkeley.
If this all sounds a bit confused, just
wait until the Cardinal takes the
floor. Davis' style is all-out pressure
defense, fast-break offense and an
emphasis on the work ethic.
That devotion to hard work has en
deared the Cardinal to its new-found
fans. According to Davis, "We're
much better at home than on the
road, and it's because of our fans. . . .
Basically that's true of anywhere in
the Pac-10. It's very hard to play on
the road."
Davis will also be going after a per
sonal milestone this year. His next
win will be the 250 th of his career.
Amazingly, in his 13 years of col
legiate coaching, he never has had a
losing season. He has led five of his
teams to post-season tournament ap
pearances.
He may want to make it six, but
that probably won't happen this
season.

Koberlein, who played forward last year, averaged 4.4 rebounds a
game and shot an amazing .653 from the floor.


Head Coach Tom Davis led the Cardinal to a 19-12 season last year
highlighted by a home victory against UCLA. Davis says he is optimis
tic about his third season at Stanford and expects senior Steve Brown

Eric Reveno, a local product from
Menlo School in Menlo Park, will
compete for the starting tenter spot
with seniors Neil Johnson and Kent
Seymour, as well as sophomore
Grady Johnson.
Standing 6-8, 250, Reveno may not
have the height to play center but
clearly; has the size to handle "the
kind of traffic in the middle in the
Pac-10," Davis said. He averaged
20.7 ppg and 11.0 rpg at Menlo (the
same school which produced Paye).
At forward, freshman Greg Butler
will vie for time with senior Charles
Hunt, junior Andy Fischer and soph
omore Doug Wall. Although taller
than Reveno at 6-11, Butler is not as
strong and is a better outside shooter.
"He's really a true forward," Davis
said.
Butler averaged 18.9 ppg and 11.0
rpg at Rolling Hills High School in

Southern California. He may have
some added incentive since his bro
ther, David, is a forward for arch-rival
University of California at Berkeley.
If this all sounds a bit confused, just
wait until the Cardinal takes the
floor. Davis' style is all-out pressure
defense, fast-break offense and an
emphasis on the work ethic.
That devotion to hard work has en
deared the Cardinal to its new-found
fans. According to Davis, "We're
much better at home than on the
road, and it's because of our fans. . . .
Basically that's true of anywhere in
the Pac-10. It's very hard to play on
the road."
Davis will also be going after a per
sonal milestone this year. His next
win will be the 250 th of his career.
Amazingly, in his 13 years of col
legiate coaching, he never has had a
losing season. He has led five of his
teams to post-season tournament ap
pearances.
He may want to make it six, but
that probably won't happen this
season.

seniors Keith Jones and John Revelli. Freshman Eric Reveno should

The third chapter of the Tom Davis
basketball story at Stanford could be
titled. "Transition and Question."
Davis has the task of replacing 56
percent of the Cardinal's offense.
Gone from last year's 19-12 team
(8-10 in the Pacific-10 Conference)
are the team's top two scorers, center
John Revelli and guard Keith Jones.
Along with fellow graduate Hans
Wichary, they averaged 41.5 of the
team's 74.5 points game.
The obvious question is, who will
replace the scoring of Jones and
Revelli?
As yet, that question has no
definitive answer and one problem is
that it may never be answered. But
Coach Davis has a history of answer
ing big questions, such as how to
make Stanford a winner.
Last season marked the first win
ning record for the Cardinal in 11
years. The team may have come
closer to receiving a post-season
tournament bid than at any time since
the last time it was in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
Tournament.
And the last time was, well, a
mighty long time ago. To be exact, 42
years have passed since Stanford won
the 1942 NCAA Championship.
That's a longer drought than the
Chicago Cubs have had.
Unfortunately that drought is likely
to continue, at least for this year. The
Cardinal is predicted to come in ninth
in the Pac-10. Unlike the rest of the
conference, Stanford lost a great deal
to graduation.
Washington State, which is also in a
rebuilding year, is likely to join Stan-
Ion! at the bottom of the conference.
Davis agreed with that general assess
ment but indicated that the confer

ence should be both improved and
exciting.
"Washington has the edge, but not
a great edge. . .. Any of the top eight
teams in the conference could have a
reasonable shot at it," Davis said.
The balance in the conference will
also improve the teams that do well.
"The winner of Pac-10 is going to be
tested every time it plays. That's
going to give it more experience
and make it better ready for post
season play."
But back to the scoring dilemma.
Davis doesn't seem to have one an
swer to the question of scoring. The
possibilities seem endless, but the
players are inexperienced.
The top prospect to fill the scoring
void is senior guard Steve Brown.
Brown was the team's third leading
scorer last season, averaging 10.9
ppg. As a junior, the 6-foot-2 Brown
switched off between guard and small
forward during the season.
Davis has tremendous confidence
in Brown, saying bluntly, "He could
be the top scorer in the Pac-10." That
assessment may seem a bit brash, but
there is ample reason for it.
Brown was probably the Cardinal's
best outside shooter last year. Shoot
ing mostly from the perimeter, he had
the third best field goal percentage
(.541) on the team. Revelli and for
ward Earl Koberlein were the only
ones to better him, but they shot
mostly from the inside.
"He didn't get a lot of shots last
year because we had a couple of great
scorers," Davis explained. "But this
year he'll see the ball a lot more.
Brown will probably be looked to
more by his teammates, who "have
tremendous respect for him.'' He was


Art Streiber/Daily
John Revelli (44) and Keith Jones (00) will be sorely missed by Coach
Tom Davis this year. The two were both named to the all Pacific-10
Conference team for the 1983-84 season and drafted by the Los An-

geles Lakers last June. Revelli's strength inside and Jones's quickness

by a stunning victory at home over perennial Pac-10 power UCLA.
voted captain of this year's squad by
his peers. If Brown produces the
scoring that the Cardinal needs, that
respect may grow.
After Brown, the Cardinal's inex
perience really starts to show. Davis
named junior Koberlein as another
possible player to pick up the scoring
slack. But aside from being last year's
best field goal shooter (.653), he was
really just the highest scorer among a
plethora of low contributors.
Koberlein averaged 6.1 ppg and
4.4 rebounds per game as a starter
last season. At 6-5, 202 pounds,
Davis has him slotted for either
power or small forward.
Junior Keith Ramee started 18
games at point guard last year and is
likely to retain that spot at the
season's start. Ramee was second in

assists to Jones with 82, but his
noticeable reluctance to shoot cost
him court time.
He will get some fierce competition
from sophomores Novian Whitsitt
and John Paye. Whitsitt is another
point for optimism, according to
Davis, "I think Novian will be a great
scorer." But Davis adds, "Whether
that's this year or next, I don't
know."
Paye, who is better known as the
Cardinal quarterback during football
season, started the 13 games that
Ramee did not. He was capable, but
like Ramee, not much of a scoring
threat. He averaged 3.3 ppg.
Junior John Williams and freshman
Steve Meinert should also vie for
playing time at guard. Williams has
gotten limited playing time so far but
will get every opportunity to exhibit
his talents during the preseason
scrimmages.
Meinert, from South Salem, Ore.,
averaged 23.7 ppg and shot over 50
percent from the field as a senior. He
shot a blistering 61 percent to lead

South Salem High School to second
place in the state tournament.
At the center and forward posi
tions, two freshmen could make sig
nificant contributions immediately.
Eric Reveno, a local product from
Menlo School in Menlo Park, will
compete for the starting tenter spot
with seniors Neil Johnson and Kent
Seymour, as well as sophomore
Grady Johnson.
Standing 6-8, 250, Reveno may not
have the height to play center but
clearly; has the size to handle "the
kind of traffic in the middle in the
Pac-10," Davis said. He averaged
20.7 ppg and 11.0 rpg at Menlo (the
same school which produced Paye).
At forward, freshman Greg Butler
will vie for time with senior Charles
Hunt, junior Andy Fischer and soph
omore Doug Wall. Although taller
