## Teams to watch when Card football is on the road sports 
### KIMBERLY ESTIS 
While football attracts the lion's
share of attention among the fall
sports at Stanford, a number of less
conspicuous but certainly not less
competitive Card teams will be bat
tling for conference and national
titles.
And though football may be your
favorite spectator sport, women's
night volleyball games in Maples
Pavilion and men's water polo
matches at DeGuerre Pool are also
worth seeing.
Following is a brief synopsis of
some of the "other" teams to watch
this fall.
Cross Country
Having spent two weeks training
hard at a pre-season camp, the Card
women are more than ready to chal
lenge for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association title. Alison
Wiley, Ceci Hopp, Regina Jacobs and
Cory Schubert are the top returning
runners on the squad.
Wiley, a junior, currently holds the
University's course record with the

and men's water polo are also worth
seeing.

time of 16:17.8, set at the Stanford
Invitational in 1983. She is a three
time Ail-American who, barring in
jury, should earn the same accolade
this year.
Hopp, a senior who sat out all but
one race last season because of a hip
injury, will be a key member of the
1984 team if she is healthy.
Jacobs, long considered the team's
most versatile runner because of her
speed (she holds the University's
800-meter record), distinguished her
self last year as a credible threat in
cross country, winning the West
Coast Athletic Association 5000-
meter championship in 17:41.
Schubert, who finished 31st at the
NCAA's last year as a freshman,
should continue to improve and will
help to keep the team strong in the
absence of last year's senior captain,
PattiSue Plumer.
Top returning members of the
men's team are Marc Olesen, Brian
Pettingill and Charles Alexander.
Olesen placed seventh overall in last
year's Pacific-10 championships as a
freshman.
Although an injury prevented
senior Pettingill from competing last

year, he is expected to make a strong
comeback this fall.
Women's Volleyball
Team unity is what volleyball coach
Fred Sturm will be aiming for as he
enters his seventh season on the
Farm. With the the loss of Kari Rush
and Julie Baker, leadership will now
be placed in the capable hands of star
hitter Kim Oden.
Oden earned the 1983 WCAA
Most Valuable Player award and is
considered one of the nation's most
dominating middle blockers.
Also returning will be Deidra
Dvorak, Bobbie Broer and Barbra
Fontana, who have all established
themselves as valuable members of
the Card team.
Fontana, destined to be one of the
leaders on the team in the near
future, is possibly the top all-around
player.
The team hopes to win the
NCAA's this year, having come off a
strong season in which they finished
third in the nation. If some of the
younger players can fill Rush and

Baker's shoes, and Oden continues to
rise a yard above the net, they might
just do it.
Men's Water Polo
Yet another Stanford team has a
national title in sight.
The men's water polo squad has
won the NCAA title three of the past
six years, and despite a sub-par
showing last year, it will be a con
tender once again this fall. Five start
ing freshman are returning from last
year's young team.
Senior Mark Daley is expected to
provide the leadership while David
Imbernino and Jaime Velez tally
most of the goals. Two-time Ail-
American Steve Moyer should prove
to be one of the nation's best goalies.
Field Hockey
The Cardinal returns its top two
scorers of a year ago in senior Patsy
Huntington and sophomore Mary
Chung.
Although not the best in the na-


Men's and women's cross country teams get together for stretching
before a long run. Coach Brooks Johnson has enjoyed great success in

recent years with the two teams, particularly with the women, who
are a perennial powerhouse.


The men's water polo team returns five sophomores from a young and
inexperienced 1983 starting squad and should contend for the na
tional title this year. Except for a rebuilding season in '83, the team

has finished with a national ranking among the top three teams every
year since 1965. The team plays its home games at De Guerre pool.
