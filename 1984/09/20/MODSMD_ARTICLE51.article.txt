## Kicking it out with the Stanford Band 
### 


Under the wacky tutelage of Drum Major Jim Kohn
(left), the madcap merrymakers of the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band are always a
highlight (sometimes the only highlight) of Stanford
sporting events. Rocking through classics like "Kick it
Out," "Squeeze Box," and, of course, "All Right
Now," the Band is powered by Stanford spirit - and
other spirits as well. Photos by Art Streiber
