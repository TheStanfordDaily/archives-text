# orientation
## When this old world starts a gettin' you down... 
### AMY BIRD 
Orientation week can make life at Stanford seem like a
luxury cruise. Breakfast at eight with your new com
panions, fun in the sun, and nightlife that lasts as long as
you can. When you catch on that no one at Stanford calls
anything by its real name, you feel like you have every
thing under control.
But then WHAMMO! Classes begin. The first time you
go to the basement to wash your clothes, you realize that
someone out there thinks one washing machine is enough
for 100 people. You come face-to-face with the bitter
truth. You have nothing clean to wear and no one can do
anything about it. You're all alone.
It's true that when things quiet down at Stanford,
you're on your own. But don't despair. There are plenty
of people in and around the University to give you help
when you need it. You just have to ask.
During your first year you may find yourself eating,
sleeping, studying, partying and playing, all within the
space of a city block. Everything you do affects everything
else and there's no place to run. The people who staff
the counseling and information services at Stanford un
derstand this phenomenon of student life. Whether you
go to talk to someone about academic, health or personal
concerns, you can find people who know the pressures
you face.
Residential Education
Everyone knows that the real goal of Red Ed is to see
which dorm can make more trouble for the other dorms.
But another major goal is to give students lines of com
munication to any kind of information they need.
Everyday dorm life lets you get to know your Resident
Assistants (RAs) and your Resident Fellows (RFs). When
you have a question you don't need to go far: just down
the hall. If your RAs or RFs can help you, they will. If
not, they can tell you whom to talk with.
RAs and RFs also act as liaisons between you and your
academic adviser during the first year. They may arrange
for your adviser to come to dinner regularly or plan other
events. Your relationship with your adviser can be a
mutually enjoyable one if you cultivate it. Just remember
that your adviser isn't there to plan your college career,
but rather to help you plan it.
Academic Help
You're all hotshots, right? Or you wouldn't be at Stan
ford. But even hotshots have been known to lose sleep

when confronted with the frothy-mouthed pre-med stu
dents who prowl the Calculus 41 classes.
If you're worried about losing sleep over your work,
now's the time to do something about it.
You can go the the Learning Assitance Center (LAC)
for tutoring in many subjects. LAC also provides aca
demic peer counseling and an accredited course to help
you develop good study skills.
It its the papers that make you wish you'd gone to
community college, look to the term paper advisory ser
vice at Meyer Library and the tutorial center at the En
glish Department.
For those ot you already concerned about your post-
Stanford success, the Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) can help you put together a resume. It
also has tips on job interview techniques and provides
career counseling.
The Academic Information Center (AIC) at Old Union
is another place to find out about pre-professional train
ing.
Taking Care of Your Health
You know that no amount of academic advising can
help you when your head aches and you have a hard time
getting up for your 1:15 class. Fortunately, the Cowell
Student Health Center is just a five-minute walk away. If
you can't walk, find a friend with a car or call Cowell's 24-
hour emergency number.
Cowell is open on an out-patient basis Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1:30-5 p.m. It pro
vides a variety of medical services to registered students
free of charge. Its physicians can make referrals to
specialists in the area for other services.
Should you become one of the many Stanford students
who succumb to the dreaded mononucleosis, Cowell has
an in-house infirmary with 100 beds. You can stay there
up to three months if need be. Your friends can visit you if
they dare. And don't think that mono at the beginning of
Dead Week means the death of your studies. Most pro
fessors are willing to make exceptions if you show them
the back of your throat.
Another useful service at Cowell is Contraceptive Peer
Counseling (CPC). Trained students willing to answer
your questions about contraceptives staff this organiza
tion. They can also field questions about pregnancy and
its alternatives. Should you need to consider an abortion,
CPC and Cowell can help you get information and can
refer you to a local physician.
Planned Parenthood has an office in Palo Alto. The

people there go out of their way to make you feel com
fortable and to give you the information you need to
make your decisions.
How About Your Head?
Sometimes you just need to talk to someone. At the
back of Cowell are the Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS). Here you find professionals of all ages
and backgrounds willing to help you get through a rough
spot.
The emphasis at CAPS isn't on long-term therapy. The
average student uses CAPS only three or four times. But
people at CAPS will gladly refer you to someone else in
the Stanford area if you feel you need a longer counseling
program. Counseling at CAPS is free of charge.
Another counseling service available to the Stanford
community is The Bridge. This student-staffed organiza
tion is open five days a week. Live-in staffers receive calls
at night.
The students who work at The Bridge are not profes
sionals. They see their job as one of listening to people,
not of giving adyce.

When they do talk, nine times out of ten it's to say,
'â€¢Well, how do you feel about that?" It may be routine,
but it's a good question. It gives you the chance to talk out
your concerns, whatever they are.
What some students want, rather than formal counsel
ing, is to be around a group of people who are sympa
thetic to their particular interests and needs. The Stanford
Student Directory has a listing of many special-interest
student groups on campus. The Women's Center, the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance (GLAS) and the Black Student
Union (BSU) are just a few.
What now?
Nobody's going to come around knocking at your door
to check up on you. But if you need to know something
you don't already know, or if you need to talk to some
one, people are around to help you.
And don't ignore the thousands of people around you
without proper titles who don't belong to acronymmed
organizations. You may just find that Stanford's greatest
resource is its students.
