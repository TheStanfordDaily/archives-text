# You and the echo boom
## ...or how you got here and why you're standing in all those lines 
### MARK WILSON 
Not too long ago I ran into Beetle
(this is not his real name), as he paced
the arcade of the Outer Quad steeped
in thought. He was trying to remem
ber something which earlier in the
day he had failed to remind himself
not to forget and seemed genuinely
grateful for being distracted from this
line of thought. He told me that I had
been on his mind recently (quite an
honor coming from a man of Beetle's
intellectual caliber) and suggested I
take on a very important job.
Beetle is an important person with
a long list of academic degrees to fol
low his real name and an office in the
Quad overlooking a sandstone wall
and a steam vent. Beetle is an assis
tant professor. He gives interviews to
area newspapers and TV stations —
anyone who wants one — and, as
such, is considered an expert in many
fields.
There are few people I know who
can match minds with Beetle; fewer

still who would stand up and question
his wisdom. As for me, I have learned
not to question h ; s statements, if only
for the time 1 save avoiding an expla
nation that would only further
confuse me. Therefore I was ready to
accept whatever job he suggested I
take on.
Beetle told me that, as one of the
few remaining undergraduate repre
sentatives of the post-World War II
baby boom, it was my responsibility
to welcome this year's freshman class:
the first big wave of the second gener
ation baby boom. Beetle calls this
group the echo boomers.
Now it might help to point out a
couple of facts here. First, Beetle
knows a lot about demographics —
he's an expert on the subject. And
second, I know less than squat about
it. Usually when facing a situation
like this with Beetle, I nod, smile and
walk away. Unfortunately, on the day
in question my guard was down, he
sensed my ignorance, and the next
moment he was elaborating on his
idea over a cup of hot cocoa. (His
theory on drinking hot cocoa in 90-

degree weather escapes me right
now.)
For the next two hours Beetle gave
me all the facts relating to the phe
nomenon of the echo boom. But as I
am by design a cartoonist, these facts
did not take root. The next day Bee
tle took off for a sabbatical in the
Amazon jungles, leaving me with a
pair of graphs, scrawled on paper
napkins, and a vague idea of what I'm
supposed to say to you.
TTie first graph (population distri
bution curve, as Beetle called it) is
less than spectacular. Much less (Fig.
A). In fact the most legible part of it,
the semi-circular arc at the bottom,
turned out to be a cocoa stain left by
Beetle's mug. It is a curve of the pop
ulation distribution of the United
States in 1945: the country and the
year in which all of your parents ap
parently were born.
Beetle said that.
By getting rid of all the extraneous

lines and numbers, and adding a few
revealing lines of our own we see that
this curve is nothing more than a
picture of your parents' age group
after World War II (Fig. B) — a
picture of youth, innocence and inor -
dinately large feet.
Beetle's second population curve,
which had possibly less going for it
stylistically than the first, got chewed
up by my cat. It showed the popula
tion distribution 20 years later,
which, after a little doctoring, looks
like this:

Here then are your parents in
1965: older, wiser, and really preg
nant.
Although this is where Beetle's
graphs end, it doesn't take a genius to
figure out what the next curve looks
like (Fig. D).
Here, the miniature population
curves represent your age group. The
fact that the big curve spawned two
little ones gives rise to the term "echo
boom." This also explains the gross
propagation of graphs in recent years.
That, then, is the story behind the
echo boom. Or something like that, at
least.
But enough of the technical analy
sis; you are probably anxious to find
out how this echo boom will affect
your life at Stanford. The fact is that
it won't, really. At least not in the
long run. Oh, sure, as you make your

way from queue to queue around
campus, as you step from the lines at
the bookstore to those at the post of
fice to those at the sandwich counter
at the Coffee House, you may indeed
feel the guilt of inconveniencing the
rest of the Stanford community.
Perhaps you will suffer persecution
at the hands of older students who al
ways managed to find a parking space
on campus before you got here. You
might even find yourself stepped on
from time to time as they crowd three
of your classmates and you into a
two-room double. These hardships
may occur, but keep in mind, they are
only temporary. Ultimately, the
growth in Stanford's enrollment will
bring us all closer together, making
Stanford a richer place for it.
As for Beetle, he is also glad you
are here. He knows a lot about you
already and has actually been waiting
for years for you to arrive. You might
even say he has built his career
around you. So if you happen to see
him strolling pensively across the
Quad, or standing around talking to a
television camera crew, walk up and
introduce yourself. Tell him he owes
you a beer or a cocoa. (He does.) Tell
him I sent you.
