# You really are 'great'

This year's freshmen mark the last
students admitted by Fred Hargadon,
dean of admissions here for the past
15 years. But that isn't the only dis
tinction of the Class of 1988.
More than 1,600 students, an all
time high at Stanford, constitute this
year's entering class. The exception
ally high number — about 100 more
than were expected — is a result of a
rise in the proportion of those accept
ing Stanford's offer of admission
(over 64 percent — another
record — of the roughly 2,500 ad
mitted).
Other record numbers from
the past year include the 15,600
freshman applications received from
4,349 secondary schools.
Data on the applicants — such as
test scores and grades — indicate an
upward shift in academic prepared
ness from that of previous applicant
pools.
Approximately 2,400 of the ap
pplicants were valedictorians of their
respective senior classes. More than
1,200 applicants scored 700 or above
on the verbal section of the SAT, and
more than 4,200 scored that high on
the math section.
An amazing 2,365 of the students
earned a perfect 4.0 high school
grade point average.
"We aim to bring together a fresh
man class which is not only able
academically, but also is diverse in
terms of the backgrounds of the stu
dents and the talents, skills, interests
and ambitions they bring with them,"

Hargadon said.
"Many factors other than test
scores are taken into consideration.
We have not chosen simply to create
the highest possible median test
scores among our incoming freshman
class.
"As has always been the case, we
are far more concerned with the
quality of academic preparation, in
terms of courses, our applicants have
received."
Hargadon was hesitant to call the
Class of 1988 the best ever.
"There is no doubt that the Class of
1988 is the best 'last class' it has been

my good fortune to have admitted to
Stanford," he said.
The class comes from 1,045 sec
ondary schools, a record high.
Among its members, 57 percent are
men, 43 percent are women, and 18
percent are from black, Chicano or
native American backgrounds.
The freshmen represent every state
except Rhode Island, and 66 students
are entering from 35 foreign
countries. Thirty-nine percent hail
from California, by far the largest
state representation, followed by those
of New York, Massachusetts, Texas,
Washington, Oregon and New Jersey.
