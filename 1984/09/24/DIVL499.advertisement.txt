Receptionist wanted
The Stanford Daily editorial department is currently looking for a
receptionist to work six hours every weekday. Duties include heavy
phones, filing, typing and other typical secretarial duties. What isn't
typical is the salary — a hot $7 an hour — and the working place — a
hectic newsroom. If all this appeals to you, call The Daily at 497-4632
and ask for Shirish.
