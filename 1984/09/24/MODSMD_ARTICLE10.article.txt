## Campus beset by mass construction 
### 

Construction continues to baffle students trying to make their way
across campus.
The Inner Quad has been closed for construction since June and
will probably not open until late October, according to project
manager Roger Cairns.
The $1 million project was originally scheduled to be completed in
time for registration, but the contractor encountered unexpected
delays.
''We're completing the project as fast as we can," Cairns says. He
requests that until the project is completed, students refrain from
crossing the Quad so as to expedite construction and to ensure
students' safety.
Many other sites on campus are currently under construction as
well. Trenching and laying conduit for a new phone system, for the
Stanford University Network (SUNET), and for the energy manage
ment project began on July 19.
About 30,000 feet of trenches will be dug by the time the $3.5
million contract is completed. Project manager Terry Vernon
estimates the project will not end until around the first of the year.
Regarding safety, Vernon cautions students not to cross barricades
and to observe signs in construction areas. Every building has an
entrance that is not barricaded, he says, and students should follow
the barricades until they come to it.
