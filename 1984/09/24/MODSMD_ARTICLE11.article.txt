## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's welcome 
### 
The product you read every morning is the
result of the efforts of more than 100 writers,
photographers, editors and sales representatives:
almost all of them students. Although degrees of
commitment vary — some spend between 50 and
60 hours a week here, others only a handful —
each staffer plays an integral role in producing a
quality paper.
Like all college newspapers, The Daily serves a
dual purpose: to train as well as to inform. And
like all voluntary, or nearly voluntary, student
groups, our staff is constantly in flux. This means
The Daily operates under constraints inherent to
such groups.
As students, we can offer both the best and
worst of campus coverage. The best because we
know Stanford intimately and can cover it like no
other paper can. The worst because, as students,
we have other interests, obligations and commit
ments: Sometimes we are unable to give our full
attention to The Daily.
This year, as in past years, we strive to provide
accurate and incisive news reporting, interesting
features, insightful reviews and provocative, yet

well reasoned, editorials.
Many times we'll succeed. Occasionally, we
will fail.
It falls on our readership, the Stanford commu
nity, to tell us how we're doing. If you like what
you read, tell us. If you think we're missing a
story, overplaying a story, writing sloppy
editorials or just plain doing a bad job, let us
know.
Call us, stop by our offices or write us a letter.
Your feedback is our only barometer of success
or failure. Without it, we fall into easy patterns of
mediocrity. And that benefits no one.
This volume marks the 11th year of The Stan
ford Daily's independence. After suffering
through some lean years, our outlook today is
sounder — both editorially and financially —
than ever before.
We at The Daily are proud of our newspaper.
We hope you find that our pride is justifiable.
