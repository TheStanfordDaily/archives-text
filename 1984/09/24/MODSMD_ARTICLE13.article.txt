## News blackouts hurt democracy 
### 
The right of the press to scrutinize
government has been questioned by
the executive and legislative branches
of government with regularity during
the past 10 years by both Democrats

VIEWPOINT

and Republicans. In either case the
complaints against the press are
identical.
Unfortunately in 1983 our govern
ment denied the public the opportu
nity to observe government in action
when reporters were barred from
covering the invasion/rescue in
Grenada, a significant first in Ameri
can history.
During the most critical days of
World War 11, Generals Eisenhower,
Mac Arthur, and Marshall shared with
the press the planned invasions of
Normandy and the South Pacific.
When public dissemination would
endanger the planned action,
reporters agreed to honor an official
embargo of such information until the
actual events unfolded. But, rarely
were reporters barred from joining
invasion forces.
A handful of journalists have tes
tified in Congress against the decision
to ban reporters from covering the
Grenada episode, but the public
seems to have accepted what amounts
to a major change in the American
approach to government. We have
acquiesced in permitting oijr elected
officials to decide for the rest of us
what is appropriate for news
reporters to report.
The reasons raised by the govern
ment in support of its policy are: (1)

coverage of the invasion/rescue might
have hampered its effectiveness; (2)
the press would have been placed in
physical danger; and (3) the press
may have endangered the lives of the
U.S. Marines conducting the mission.
A "news blackout" prior to the
mission would not have hampered
anyone's effectiveness. Coverage of
the actual mission and the lifting of
the "blackout" could not occur until
the mission began. If news teams in

The problem is that since World War
II we have given government the right
to do pretty much what it wants,
without clearing it at any time with
anybody: Congress or the people.

Vietnam could provide video
coverage of the details of heavy
jungle combat without a significant
impact on the conduct of that war,
how could it have been much differ
ent on this Caribbean island? The
suppression of news coverage in
Grenada served only to keep the bill
payers in the dark. The Grenaaians,
the medical students, our military and
elected officials surely knew what was
going on.
The safety argument is even less
convincing. There are countless ex
amples of the press covering danger-

ous and life-threatening events. The
press was not barred from the riots in
Detroit of July 1967, the riots in
Watts following the assassination of
Martin Luther King, the 1968 Demo
cratic Convention actions of the
Chicago police, the Tet Offensive, the
Falkland Islands and the ongoing
Middle East war. All were signifi
cantly more dangerous than Grenada.
The problem is that since World
War II we have given government the

right to do pretty much what it wants,
without clearing it at any time with
anybody: Congress or the people.
If it was not for the press, we never
would have learned about the secret
bombing of Cambodia, during which
110,000 tons of bombs were dropped
during a 14-month period on the or
ders of our government. The press
first told us that same government
operated against the American anti
war movement through domestic
spying by the CIA and set up an in
ternal police force to go after its op
ponents, like Daniel Ellsberg, whose

confidential comments to his psychia
trist were not safe from warrantless
inspection.
The Nixon administration is easy to
use as an example because it was so
outrageous. To give equal time to the
Democrats, the press first told us
about Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
at Chappaquiddick, former President
Jimmy Carter's advisor's banking
connections, Chicago Mayor Richard
Daley's police plans for the 1968
Democratic Convention, and others.
Unfortunately, current conven
tional wisdom holds that there is an
inherent right foi government to lie
and that it is a right. "They all do it"
is the way it is rationalized.
But for the press there would be far
fewer demanding morality, integrity
and the truth, because nobody would
know what was going on.
In 1792 Thomas Jefferson wrote
Alexander Hamilton that govern
ment, if virtuous, need not fear
criticism and that there is "no other
means for sifting out the truth" ex
cept by a free press.
Watergate was a classic example of
a free press providing information
and an independent judiciary serving
the needs of justice. Together they
form the bulwark of democracy. They
both deserve our respect and ap
preciation because they keep our sys
tem of government honest and
responsible to the people.
