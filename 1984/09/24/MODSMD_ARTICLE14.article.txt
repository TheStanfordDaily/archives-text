Ambiguous Zschau
A year after visiting the
Nicaraguan border town of Jalapa, I
am still haunted by images of people
being brutalized at the hands of
U.S.-funded contras. There, one
could see vivid evidence of contra
violence: gutted buildings, shrapnel
marks on walls, trenches where
people seek shelter during mortar
attacks. In the past two years, over
1,000 Nicaraguan civilians have been
murdered by the contras. Continued
reports of contra violence, often
involving rape, torture or mutilation,
are confirmed by U.S. and European
church workers living with the
people in Nicaragua. In Jalapa, 1 felt
shame and outrage that my govern
ment could be supporting such ac
tions.
When I returned from Nicaragua,
I was interested to learn that Rep.
Ed Zschau (R-Sunnyvale) was also
planning to visit Central America.
Following his return, I attended his
Aug. 25 town meeting, at which he
characterized the contras as "thugs."
In a December constituent letter, he
wrote that the contras "hope to
overthrow the government in

Nicaragua, and they seem prepared
to do whatever that takes."
Despite his awareness of contra
brutalities, I am struck that Zschau's
actions lack the sense of urgency and
outrage which I have felt since my
trip. Only with painful slowness has
he come to vote more consistently
against aid to the contras. Even after
his trip to Central America, his votes
have not been unambiguous state
ments of opposition to the contras.
Zschau's vote on HR2968 makes the
point. The original bill contained a
strong prohibition on aid to the
contras, one likely to be rejected by
the Senate. Those favoring such a
prohibition, recognizing the
likelihood of Senate rejection, of
fered what was hoped would be a
more viable compromise amendment
(which included overt aid for arms
interdiction). Zschau voted against
the amended version of the bill, the
one which had the gicaier likelihood
of being accepted by the Senate.
In the coming election, we must
question whether Zschau's ambigu
ous response to U.S.-funded contra
violence best represents us as voters.
