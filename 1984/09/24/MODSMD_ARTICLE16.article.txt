## Freshmen arrive 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The newest citizens of the campus
community — about 1,600 freshmen
and 80 transfer students — arrived on
campus Thursday, hurtled through
four days of orientation activities and
braced for registration today and to
morrow and their entrance into aca
demic life at Stanford.
In their first four days at Stanford,
the new students quickly learned
about life on the Farm. "I've had an
hour and 15 minutes to stop and relax
since I got here," said freshman
David Whitney after three days of or
ientation.
"I hate lines," said freshman
Amanda Kemp. "I've stood in line at
the bank, to get a meal card and to
use the bathroom."
On Thursday night, University
President Donald Kennedy warned
the freshmen not to accept the Uni
versity as it is and exposed the anti
intellectual bias he sees in Stanford
students.
Stanford students are serious
enough in the classroom, but when
they leave the Quad or the library,
they "gain approval by feigning disin
terest in great issues," and"court dis
approval by appearing recreationally
intellectual," Kennedy said.
Ignoring intellectual matters
outside the classroom hinders the ex
change of ideas between students and
also leads to apathy about serious
non-classroom issues like discrimina
tion and nuclear winter, Kennedy
noted.
"If seriousness becomes a casualty
of student discourse on this campus,
then surely controversy will also and
that will impoverish us all," Kennedy

said.
Intellectually serious or not, the in
coming students seem well prepared
for academics. By all quantifiable
measures, such as test scores and
grades, the talents of the freshmen in
creased.
About 100 more freshmen than ex
pected accepted their offers of admis
sion and made competition for trans
fer students intense. More than 1,600
applications from potential transfers
were reviewed in the past year.
Beth Povell, a transfer from Bryn
Mawr College, came to Stanford be
cause she "wanted a change from
small schools in New England."
She enjoyed orientation but said
that the campus "is just vast, and I get
lost everytime I step out the door."
Orientation seems to have gone
smoothly.
"The orientation volunteers were
fantastic" in helping settle the fresh
men in the dorm, said Debbie Bishko,
a resident assistant in Florence
Moore.
"The schedule has been intense,
but I've been impressed by how
friendly everyone is," added fresh
man Matt Roller.
Of course, homesickness has to be
dealt with, but freshman Kemp has
found a remedy: "Sometimes I'm
homesick when I wake up in the
morning, but then I start doing stuff
and I just forget about it."
The new students come from every
state but Rhode Island and from 35
foreign countries. California contrib
uted the most students and was fol
lowed by New York, Massachusetts,
Texas, Washington, Oregon and New
Jersey.
