## Olympics dominate summer news on Farm 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
Many campus news stories from the
summer still merit full articles because
of recent developments or continual
conflict. Among these are the Univer
sity's fight against Niven's, the contro
versial Steven Mosher case, and Stan
ford s recent Willow Road victory.
Many other stories from the sum
mer are no longer timely but are
newsworthy and deserve mention in
this first issue of the 1984-85 school
year.
Following are summaries of six
stories that fall into that second cate
gory:
Med School
In an extensive shake-up at the
Stanford Medical School, Dean
Dominick Purpura and Department
of Medicine Chairman Kenneth Mel
mon resigned their positions.
Melmon resigned June 3 after Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
sent him a letter of censure, chiding
the chairman's "carelessness" in
using others' written materials.
The medical school's Committee
on Ethical Scientific Performance
found Melmon guilty of "grossly
negligent scholarship" for using unat
tributed copyright material in a chap
ter he wrote for an endocrinology
textbook.

"[Your action] represents a degree
of carelessness in dealing with the in
tellectual property of others that vi
olates the fundamental norms of the
academic profession," Kennedy
wrote Melmon.
The censure, and Melmon's sur
render of his post, was sufficient
punishment, Kennedy said. Melmon
was allowed to maintain his academic
tenure and his research and teaching
responsibilities.
In a June 6 statement, Melmon
said, "I realized that 1 had to resign as
department chairman rather than al
low the affair to blow up into a giant
confrontation . . . that would in
evitably weaken or destroy the work
that 1 have done over the past five
years."
Rex Jamison, professor of
medicine and physiology and chief of
the division of nephrology, was ap
pointed acting chairman of the De
partment of Medicine, succeeding
Melmon in the position after a two
month vacancy. Jamison was also
named acting chief of the Medical
Service of Stanford Hospital, effec
tive Aug. 1.
Purpura resigned on June 12 for
reasons believed unrelated to the
Melmon case. He said he wanted to
devote time to research.
Purpura chose not to remain at
Stanford but to accept the top post at
the Albert Einstein College of

Medicine in New York City, effective
this fail.
Three candidates, two from inside
the University, are still in the running
as the search for a new dean at the
medical school continues.
Summer Olympics
With a series of soccer matches
played in Stanford Stadium this sum
mer, the University became the first
site in Northern California ever to
host a summer Olympic event. A
crowd of 83,642 watched the last
match here â€” a semifinal in which
Brazil defeated Italy in overtime.
Meanwhile, Stanford students,
coaches and alumni tallied 11 medals
down in Southern California, four of
which went to undergraduates.
Sophomore Pablo Morales won a
gold medal and two silvers in men's
swimming. He lost one world record
(in the 100-meter butterfly), gained
another (in the 400-meter medley
relay), and earned much praise for
being gracious both in victory and in
defeat.
Sophomore Susan Rapp won the
fourth medal, a silver in women's
swimming.
Junior John Moffet, who had set a
world record in the men's 100-meter
breaststroke at the Olympic Trials,
suffered a painful groin-pull injury in
a preliminary race at the Olympics

and lost the finals (he powered his
way to a fifth-place finish despite the
injury) and his world record. Moffet
was also forced to withdraw from an
other event.
Sophomore Jeff Kostoff finished
sixth in the 400-meter individual
medley.
Stanford assistant wrestling
coaches Mark and Dave Schultz both
won gold medals in freestyle wres
tling.
Mark won the IBOV2-pound divi
sion title only after a controversial
match in which he broke the elbow of
a Turkish opponent. Dave won at 163
pounds using equally brutal (but all
within the rules) tactics.
Sophomore Derrick Rostagno lost
his first-round match of exhibition
tennis, and Carol Cady, a senior last
year, did not place in the shot put in
track and field competition.
Streleski
Convicted killer Theodore
Streleski tossed himself back in
prison on Sept.7 by refusing to sign
papers agreeing to his parole condi
tions. The Board of Prison Terms is
expected to postpone his release on
parole until March 8, 1985.
