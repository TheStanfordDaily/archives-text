## Olympics dominate summer news on Farm 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
Many campus news stories from the
summer still merit full articles because
of recent developments or continual
conflict. Among these are the Univer
sity's fight against Niven's, the contro
versial Steven Mosher case, and Stan
ford s recent Willow Road victory.
Many other stories from the sum
mer are no longer timely but are
newsworthy and deserve mention in
this first issue of the 1984-85 school
year.
Following are summaries of six
stories that fall into that second cate
gory:
Med School
In an extensive shake-up at the
Stanford Medical School, Dean
Dominick Purpura and Department
of Medicine Chairman Kenneth Mel
mon resigned their positions.
Melmon resigned June 3 after Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
sent him a letter of censure, chiding
the chairman's "carelessness" in
using others' written materials.
The medical school's Committee
on Ethical Scientific Performance
found Melmon guilty of "grossly
negligent scholarship" for using unat
tributed copyright material in a chap
ter he wrote for an endocrinology
textbook.

"[Your action] represents a degree
of carelessness in dealing with the in
tellectual property of others that vi
olates the fundamental norms of the
academic profession," Kennedy
wrote Melmon.
The censure, and Melmon's sur
render of his post, was sufficient
punishment, Kennedy said. Melmon
was allowed to maintain his academic
tenure and his research and teaching
responsibilities.
In a June 6 statement, Melmon
said, "I realized that 1 had to resign as
department chairman rather than al
low the affair to blow up into a giant
confrontation . . . that would in
evitably weaken or destroy the work
that 1 have done over the past five
years."
Rex Jamison, professor of
medicine and physiology and chief of
the division of nephrology, was ap
pointed acting chairman of the De
partment of Medicine, succeeding
Melmon in the position after a two
month vacancy. Jamison was also
named acting chief of the Medical
Service of Stanford Hospital, effec
tive Aug. 1.
Purpura resigned on June 12 for
reasons believed unrelated to the
Melmon case. He said he wanted to
devote time to research.
Purpura chose not to remain at
Stanford but to accept the top post at
the Albert Einstein College of

Medicine in New York City, effective
this fail.
Three candidates, two from inside
the University, are still in the running
as the search for a new dean at the
medical school continues.
Summer Olympics
With a series of soccer matches
played in Stanford Stadium this sum
mer, the University became the first
site in Northern California ever to
host a summer Olympic event. A
crowd of 83,642 watched the last
match here — a semifinal in which
Brazil defeated Italy in overtime.
Meanwhile, Stanford students,
coaches and alumni tallied 11 medals
down in Southern California, four of
which went to undergraduates.
Sophomore Pablo Morales won a
gold medal and two silvers in men's
swimming. He lost one world record
(in the 100-meter butterfly), gained
another (in the 400-meter medley
relay), and earned much praise for
being gracious both in victory and in
defeat.
Sophomore Susan Rapp won the
fourth medal, a silver in women's
swimming.
Junior John Moffet, who had set a
world record in the men's 100-meter
breaststroke at the Olympic Trials,
suffered a painful groin-pull injury in
a preliminary race at the Olympics

and lost the finals (he powered his
way to a fifth-place finish despite the
injury) and his world record. Moffet
was also forced to withdraw from an
other event.
Sophomore Jeff Kostoff finished
sixth in the 400-meter individual
medley.
Stanford assistant wrestling
coaches Mark and Dave Schultz both
won gold medals in freestyle wres
tling.
Mark won the IBOV2-pound divi
sion title only after a controversial
match in which he broke the elbow of
a Turkish opponent. Dave won at 163
pounds using equally brutal (but all
within the rules) tactics.
Sophomore Derrick Rostagno lost
his first-round match of exhibition
tennis, and Carol Cady, a senior last
year, did not place in the shot put in
track and field competition.
Streleski
Convicted killer Theodore
Streleski tossed himself back in
prison on Sept.7 by refusing to sign
papers agreeing to his parole condi
tions. The Board of Prison Terms is
expected to postpone his release on
parole until March 8, 1985.

dent at Stanford who spent 19 years

Theodore Streleski, convicted of the 1978 hammer slaying of a Stan
ford mathematics professor, refused conditions of his parole again this
summer.
working toward a doctorate in mathe
matics, killed a former adviser, Math
ematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw, in
1978. He was found guilty of second
degree murder and given an eight
year sentence, California's maximum
penalty for the charge at the time.
Streleski was first released from
prison on March 8, 1984, after ser
ving five-and-one-half years of his
sentence. But he violated conditions
of his parole and was reincarcerated
three hours after his release.
Admittedly unhappy with the
parole stipulation that he not set foot
on the Stanford campus or in the four
counties surrounding the University,
Streleski said he preferred to remain
in prison until his sentence was com
pleted and he could be released with
out any conditions. If he decides
again in March to stay in prison until
the end of his term, he will be freed
unconditionally in September, 1985.
Streleski, who said he beat
deLeeuw to death with a hammer to
protest the way Stanford treats its
graduate students, maintains that the
killing was morally correct and still
refuses to promise he will not return
to campus to kill again.
USW Struggle
The United Stanford Workers and

the University have agreed to an elec
tion that could end the seven-month
long dispute between the two over
USWs status.
On Sept. 18, less than one hour
before the National Labor Relations
Board was to begin a hearing on the
matter, the two sides agreed to hold
an Oct. 30 election to determine whe
ther 1,330 Stanford workers will be
represented by USW.
1 he University has denied recogni
tion of the union since late February,
when USW separated from a larger,
county-wide union it had been affili
ated with for four years. USW filed
unfair labor practice charges with the
NLRB against Stanford, charges the
NLRB would have brought against
the University in the cancelled
hearing.
Both sides claim victory in the
twelfth-hour agreement. Stanford
says an NLRB election was what it
wanted all along. The union says the
agreed-upon election has a much
shorter appeals process than the one
Stanford originally demanded: an ap
peals process that could have ex
tended past the current union con
tract which expires August, 1985.
Kaplan vs. Newsweek
Law Prof. John Kaplan's $1 million
libel suit against Newsweek Magazine
was dismissed on July 31 in a written
decision by U.S. District Court Judge
Robert Aguilar.

"The article is the expression of
some students' opinions" and
"statements of opinion are not ac
tionable," Aguilar wrote in the deci
sion.
Kaplan sued Newsweek after the
magazine printed an article called "A
Giggle of Guts" in its October, 1983,
Newsweek on Campus issue. The ar
ticle included Kaplan's popular Crim
inal Law course among a list of
"micks" offered at colleges
nationwide.
Upset with the ruling, Kaplan im
mediately filed an appeal with the
district court. The appeal will take at
least a year to reach trial again, if ac
cepted.
Paul files lawsuit
Assistant Prof, of Religious Studies
Diana Paul filed a suit against the
University, charging that sexual and
racial biases were the reason for her
tenure denial.
The suit, filed on June 29, asks that
Stanford either grant Paul tenure or
allow her a new tenure review process
free of bias. But Stanford officials
have denied that bias played any part
■n their rulings on the case.
Paul was denied tenure a year ago
by a five-member panel chosen by
her department. To gain tenure, one
must rate "outstanding" in either re
search or teaching. Paul received
lower ratings in both categories.
Many campus news stories from the
summer still merit full articles because
of recent developments or continual
conflict. Among these are the Univer
sity's fight against Niven's, the contro
versial Steven Mosher case, and Stan
ford s recent Willow Road victory.

USW Struggle
The United Stanford Workers and

the University have agreed to an elec
tion that could end the seven-month
long dispute between the two over
USWs status.
On Sept. 18, less than one hour
before the National Labor Relations
Board was to begin a hearing on the
matter, the two sides agreed to hold
an Oct. 30 election to determine whe
ther 1,330 Stanford workers will be
represented by USW.
1 he University has denied recogni
tion of the union since late February,
when USW separated from a larger,
county-wide union it had been affili
ated with for four years. USW filed
unfair labor practice charges with the
NLRB against Stanford, charges the
NLRB would have brought against
the University in the cancelled
hearing.
Both sides claim victory in the
twelfth-hour agreement. Stanford
says an NLRB election was what it
wanted all along. The union says the
agreed-upon election has a much
shorter appeals process than the one
Stanford originally demanded: an ap
peals process that could have ex
tended past the current union con
tract which expires August, 1985.
Kaplan vs. Newsweek
Law Prof. John Kaplan's $1 million
libel suit against Newsweek Magazine
was dismissed on July 31 in a written
decision by U.S. District Court Judge
Robert Aguilar.

"The article is the expression of
some students' opinions" and
"statements of opinion are not ac

sion.
Kaplan sued Newsweek after the
magazine printed an article called "A
Giggle of Guts" in its October, 1983,
Newsweek on Campus issue. The ar
ticle included Kaplan's popular Crim
inal Law course among a list of
"micks" offered at colleges
nationwide.
Upset with the ruling, Kaplan im
mediately filed an appeal with the
district court. The appeal will take at
least a year to reach trial again, if ac

Paul files lawsuit
Assistant Prof, of Religious Studies
Diana Paul filed a suit against the
University, charging that sexual and
racial biases were the reason for her
tenure denial.
The suit, filed on June 29, asks that
Stanford either grant Paul tenure or
allow her a new tenure review process
free of bias. But Stanford officials
have denied that bias played any part
■n their rulings on the case.
Paul was denied tenure a year ago
by a five-member panel chosen by
her department. To gain tenure, one
must rate "outstanding" in either re
search or teaching. Paul received
lower ratings in both categories.
Many campus news stories from the
summer still merit full articles because
of recent developments or continual
conflict. Among these are the Univer
sity's fight against Niven's, the contro
versial Steven Mosher case, and Stan
ford s recent Willow Road victory.
Many other stories from the sum
mer are no longer timely but are
newsworthy and deserve mention in
this first issue of the 1984-85 school
year.
Following are summaries of six
stories that fall into that second cate
gory:
Med School
In an extensive shake-up at the
Stanford Medical School, Dean
Dominick Purpura and Department
of Medicine Chairman Kenneth Mel
mon resigned their positions.
Melmon resigned June 3 after Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
sent him a letter of censure, chiding
the chairman's "carelessness" in
using others' written materials.
The medical school's Committee
on Ethical Scientific Performance
found Melmon guilty of "grossly
negligent scholarship" for using unat
tributed copyright material in a chap
ter he wrote for an endocrinology
textbook.

"[Your action] represents a degree
of carelessness in dealing with the in
tellectual property of others that vi
olates the fundamental norms of the
academic profession," Kennedy
wrote Melmon.
The censure, and Melmon's sur
render of his post, was sufficient
punishment, Kennedy said. Melmon
was allowed to maintain his academic
tenure and his research and teaching
responsibilities.
In a June 6 statement, Melmon
said, "I realized that 1 had to resign as
department chairman rather than al
low the affair to blow up into a giant
confrontation . . . that would in
evitably weaken or destroy the work
that 1 have done over the past five
years."
Rex Jamison, professor of
medicine and physiology and chief of
the division of nephrology, was ap
pointed acting chairman of the De
partment of Medicine, succeeding
Melmon in the position after a two
month vacancy. Jamison was also
named acting chief of the Medical
Service of Stanford Hospital, effec
tive Aug. 1.
Purpura resigned on June 12 for
reasons believed unrelated to the
Melmon case. He said he wanted to
devote time to research.
Purpura chose not to remain at
Stanford but to accept the top post at
the Albert Einstein College of

Medicine in New York City, effective
this fail.
Three candidates, two from inside
the University, are still in the running
as the search for a new dean at the
medical school continues.
Summer Olympics
With a series of soccer matches
played in Stanford Stadium this sum
mer, the University became the first
site in Northern California ever to
host a summer Olympic event. A
crowd of 83,642 watched the last
match here — a semifinal in which
Brazil defeated Italy in overtime.
Meanwhile, Stanford students,
coaches and alumni tallied 11 medals
down in Southern California, four of
which went to undergraduates.
Sophomore Pablo Morales won a
gold medal and two silvers in men's
swimming. He lost one world record
(in the 100-meter butterfly), gained
another (in the 400-meter medley
relay), and earned much praise for
being gracious both in victory and in
defeat.
Sophomore Susan Rapp won the
fourth medal, a silver in women's
swimming.
Junior John Moffet, who had set a
world record in the men's 100-meter
breaststroke at the Olympic Trials,
suffered a painful groin-pull injury in
a preliminary race at the Olympics

and lost the finals (he powered his
way to a fifth-place finish despite the
injury) and his world record. Moffet
was also forced to withdraw from an
other event.
Sophomore Jeff Kostoff finished
sixth in the 400-meter individual
medley.
Stanford assistant wrestling
coaches Mark and Dave Schultz both
won gold medals in freestyle wres
tling.
Mark won the IBOV2-pound divi
sion title only after a controversial
match in which he broke the elbow of
a Turkish opponent. Dave won at 163
pounds using equally brutal (but all
within the rules) tactics.
Sophomore Derrick Rostagno lost
his first-round match of exhibition
tennis, and Carol Cady, a senior last
year, did not place in the shot put in
track and field competition.
Streleski
Convicted killer Theodore
Streleski tossed himself back in
prison on Sept.7 by refusing to sign
papers agreeing to his parole condi
tions. The Board of Prison Terms is
expected to postpone his release on
parole until March 8, 1985.

dent at Stanford who spent 19 years

Theodore Streleski, convicted of the 1978 hammer slaying of a Stan
ford mathematics professor, refused conditions of his parole again this
summer.
working toward a doctorate in mathe
matics, killed a former adviser, Math
ematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw, in
1978. He was found guilty of second
degree murder and given an eight
year sentence, California's maximum
penalty for the charge at the time.
Streleski was first released from
prison on March 8, 1984, after ser
ving five-and-one-half years of his
sentence. But he violated conditions
of his parole and was reincarcerated
three hours after his release.
Admittedly unhappy with the
parole stipulation that he not set foot
on the Stanford campus or in the four
counties surrounding the University,
Streleski said he preferred to remain
in prison until his sentence was com
pleted and he could be released with
out any conditions. If he decides
again in March to stay in prison until
the end of his term, he will be freed
unconditionally in September, 1985.
Streleski, who said he beat
deLeeuw to death with a hammer to
protest the way Stanford treats its
graduate students, maintains that the
killing was morally correct and still
refuses to promise he will not return
to campus to kill again.
