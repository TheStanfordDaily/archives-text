# Stanford Summer '84
## A 						review of what you missed 
### 

Nearly 4,500 Stanford students received
degrees at the University's 93rd com
mencement June 17. The 20,000 people
who filled Sunken Diamond heard
former University President Richard
Lyman urge graduates to tackle the large
problems society faces, while current
President Donald Kennedy reminded
them "yuppiedom" does not represent
America's heartland. Outgoing Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon (left)
received the University's Dinkelspiel
Award during the ceremonies.



If White Plaza seems strangely quiet during this first week of the year, it's
probably because it lost its most popular citizen this summer. Thomas Dallas,
otherwise known as Tomaso the Fruit Vendor, died of a heart attack in June.


Some of California's leading academicians gathered at the Faculty Club this summer to celebrate W. Glenn
Campbell's 25th year as the head of the Hoover Institution. From left to right, Stanford University President
Donald Kennedy joined Campbell and University of California at Berkeley President David Gardner at the
celebration.


The biggest news of the summer was sports: Olympic sports. Stanford students brought
home their share of the gold from Los Angeles, but closer to home, Stanford Stadium
hosted preliminary rounds of Olympic soccer. Italy played Chile (above) in an early
round game, before losing the final game played here to Brazil. Congressman Ed

The dry lake bed of Lake Lagunita became an emergency landing strip for a private plane in trouble. The landing went
fine, but the taxiing didn't: The plane flipped over, leaving ' "wner with a total loss.


ZsAau (R-Sunnyvale) carried the Olympic torch through Palo Alto (above) before
thils got underway at the stadium during opening ceremonies (below). Security
rtiftined tight during the Games here, especially at Branner Hall, where Olympic
atfvtes stayed (below left).






Politics dominated the Bay Area scene, with the Democratic Convention in San Francisco kicking it all off in early
July. Eventual Democratic nominee Walter Mondale added his share of excitement to the convention by picking
Geraldine Ferraro to be his running mate. The Rev. Jesse Jackson brought tears to the eyes of many in the George
Moscone Convention Center with an impassioned speech, and Colorado Sen. Gary Hart bowed out gracefully
when the vote count didn't go his way. Not to be outdone by his Democratic foes, President Reagan made a Labor
Day (the opening day of his re-election campaign) appearance at De Anza College, located off Interstate 280 just
south of here.
