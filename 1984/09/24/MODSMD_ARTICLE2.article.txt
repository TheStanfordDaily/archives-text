# Sweet treats, a bitter battle
## Niven's goes back to court 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Efforts to introduce cookies and ice
cream have proven to be anything but
a party for the owner of a super
market in the Stanford Shopping
Center.
John Niven, owner of Niven's In
ternational Market, is planning to ask
a Santa Clara County Superior Court
judge this week to allow him to sub
lease sections of his store to a Mrs.
Fields cookie outlet and a Cone-a-
Copia ice cream vendor.
The University, as Niven's
landlord, filed suit against Niven in
July, claiming such subleasing would
violate the terms of his 29-year-old
lease.
During August, the University
sought both a temporary restraining
order and a preliminary injunction to
prevent Niven from moving ahead
with his plans while the suit was
pending, but judges denied both mo
tions.
But Niven hit a snag when a judge
ordered he submit plans for the con
struction to the University for routine
approval. The lease for the 23,000-
square-foot store says that Stanford
must approve any plans to "alter the
premises."
In a letter to Niven dated Sept. 14,
University officials refused to ap

prove the plans as drafted. Niven is
responding by returning to court,
where, he said, his lawyer will ask the
judge to deny Stanford's right to
review the plans.
"We want the judge to say, 'OK,
you can do it,' " Niven said.
"We'll say, 'Your Honor, we've
done everything we possibly can.
Would you please tell Stanford that
we may go ahead,' " Niven said.
The owner claimed that, since the
proposed changes do not alter the ex
terior of the building, he has ques
tioned Stanford's right to review such
plans from the very beginning. Niven
said he has made numerous changes,
including major construction, in his
store during the past 29 years, and
the University has never claimed a
right to review plans based on an
"altering the premises" argument.
"Over these years, by the practice
of the parties, the definition (of alter
ing the premises) has come to mean
physically modifying the building or
changing the exterior. We don't
believe we're altering the premises
(in this case) at all."
In its letter to Niven, the University
gives tacit approval for the plans but
disagrees with Niven's choice of loca
tion of the two concessionaires.
