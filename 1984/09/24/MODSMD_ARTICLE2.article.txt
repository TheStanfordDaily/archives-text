# Sweet treats, a bitter battle
## Niven's goes back to court 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Efforts to introduce cookies and ice
cream have proven to be anything but
a party for the owner of a super
market in the Stanford Shopping
Center.
John Niven, owner of Niven's In
ternational Market, is planning to ask
a Santa Clara County Superior Court
judge this week to allow him to sub
lease sections of his store to a Mrs.
Fields cookie outlet and a Cone-a-
Copia ice cream vendor.
The University, as Niven's
landlord, filed suit against Niven in
July, claiming such subleasing would
violate the terms of his 29-year-old
lease.
During August, the University
sought both a temporary restraining
order and a preliminary injunction to
prevent Niven from moving ahead
with his plans while the suit was
pending, but judges denied both mo
tions.
But Niven hit a snag when a judge
ordered he submit plans for the con
struction to the University for routine
approval. The lease for the 23,000-
square-foot store says that Stanford
must approve any plans to "alter the
premises."
In a letter to Niven dated Sept. 14,
University officials refused to ap

prove the plans as drafted. Niven is
responding by returning to court,
where, he said, his lawyer will ask the
judge to deny Stanford's right to
review the plans.
"We want the judge to say, 'OK,
you can do it,' " Niven said.
"We'll say, 'Your Honor, we've
done everything we possibly can.
Would you please tell Stanford that
we may go ahead,' " Niven said.
The owner claimed that, since the
proposed changes do not alter the ex
terior of the building, he has ques
tioned Stanford's right to review such
plans from the very beginning. Niven
said he has made numerous changes,
including major construction, in his
store during the past 29 years, and
the University has never claimed a
right to review plans based on an
"altering the premises" argument.
"Over these years, by the practice
of the parties, the definition (of alter
ing the premises) has come to mean
physically modifying the building or
changing the exterior. We don't
believe we're altering the premises
(in this case) at all."
In its letter to Niven, the University
gives tacit approval for the plans but
disagrees with Niven's choice of loca
tion of the two concessionaires.
The letter, signed by Rosemary
McAndrews, manager of campus
properties, states, "We find the con
struction and design features gener
ally acceptable if such alterations are
located in a different part of the store,
away from the front windows."
It adds, in summary, "We are will
ing to approve the alterations if
placed in an appropriate location."

Niven countered that the Univer
sity has never placed constraints on
where he displayed his products. He
said its refusal to approve the plans is
just a stall tactic while the suit to deny
the subleasing is still pending.
"Nowhere in the lease, and
nowhere in the judge's orders, does it
say that Stanford has a righjt to tell us
where we can put our things," Niven
said.
"I think Stanford's whole approach
to this thing is draw it out, drag it out,
make sure we go to court every step
of the way. Stanford is obviously just

maliciously jacking us around."
Niven called the memo a
"contrived way of saying yes but no at
the same time."
The University has claimed that
subleasing to Mrs. Fields and Cone
a-Copia is a breach of Niven's lease
and will adversely affect the competi
tive balance in the shopping plaza.
John Schwartz, a lawyer for the
University, said some stores, includ
ing Cookie Habit, a bakery on the
south side of the mall, are afraid a
Mrs. Fields store would force them
out of business. Schwartz said the

University is obliged to protect its in
vestment in the shopping center by
protecting its tenants from such com
petition.
Schwartz could not explain how
Mrs. Fields would constitute harsh
competition for Cookie Habit when
David's Cookies, a similar store near
Niven's on the north side of the mall,
apparently does not. ,
According to Schwartz, uie suit is
also based on what the University
feels is misrepresentation on the part
of Niven.
"Niven's obtained a lease at a par

ticularly low rental because he
represented that he would operate a
supermarket," Schwartz said. He said
the University agreed to the terms of
that lease because it recognized that
supermarkets operate at a relatively
low profit margin.
But, Schwartz said, by subleasing
part of the store Niven would be
breaching his lease because Niven's
would no longer be a traditional su
permarket. He said by renting out
sections of the store at a high rate,
Niven stands to make a substantial
profit.

Niven thinks the University is
"hassling" him precisely because of
his "extremely attractive lease."
The lease, which is effective until
2006, stipulates that he pay approxi
mately $150 per square foot an
nually. Niven estimated that the Uni
versity could probably parcel out his
store and charge annual rates of up to
$40 per square foot today.
"I pay 'em peanuts," Niven said.
The difference between his rent and
what the University could make on
his store " is a humongous amount of
money over the next 22 years."

Niven's on the north side of the mall,
apparently does not. ,
According to Schwartz, uie suit is
also based on what the University
feels is misrepresentation on the part
of Niven.
"Niven's obtained a lease at a par

ticularly low rental because he
represented that he would operate a
supermarket," Schwartz said. He said
the University agreed to the terms of
that lease because it recognized that
supermarkets operate at a relatively
low profit margin.
But, Schwartz said, by subleasing
part of the store Niven would be
breaching his lease because Niven's
would no longer be a traditional su
permarket. He said by renting out
sections of the store at a high rate,
Niven stands to make a substantial
profit.

Niven thinks the University is
"hassling" him precisely because of
his "extremely attractive lease."
The lease, which is effective until
2006, stipulates that he pay approxi
mately $150 per square foot an
nually. Niven estimated that the Uni
versity could probably parcel out his
store and charge annual rates of up to
$40 per square foot today.
"I pay 'em peanuts," Niven said.
The difference between his rent and
what the University could make on
his store " is a humongous amount of
money over the next 22 years."
Efforts to introduce cookies and ice
cream have proven to be anything but
a party for the owner of a super
market in the Stanford Shopping
Center.
John Niven, owner of Niven's In
ternational Market, is planning to ask
a Santa Clara County Superior Court
judge this week to allow him to sub
lease sections of his store to a Mrs.
Fields cookie outlet and a Cone-a-
Copia ice cream vendor.
The University, as Niven's
landlord, filed suit against Niven in
July, claiming such subleasing would
violate the terms of his 29-year-old
lease.
During August, the University
sought both a temporary restraining
order and a preliminary injunction to
prevent Niven from moving ahead
with his plans while the suit was
pending, but judges denied both mo
tions.
But Niven hit a snag when a judge
ordered he submit plans for the con
struction to the University for routine
approval. The lease for the 23,000-
square-foot store says that Stanford
must approve any plans to "alter the
premises."
In a letter to Niven dated Sept. 14,
University officials refused to ap

prove the plans as drafted. Niven is
responding by returning to court,
where, he said, his lawyer will ask the
judge to deny Stanford's right to
review the plans.
"We want the judge to say, 'OK,
you can do it,' " Niven said.
"We'll say, 'Your Honor, we've
done everything we possibly can.
Would you please tell Stanford that
we may go ahead,' " Niven said.
The owner claimed that, since the
proposed changes do not alter the ex
terior of the building, he has ques
tioned Stanford's right to review such
plans from the very beginning. Niven
said he has made numerous changes,
including major construction, in his
store during the past 29 years, and
the University has never claimed a
right to review plans based on an
"altering the premises" argument.
"Over these years, by the practice
of the parties, the definition (of alter
ing the premises) has come to mean
physically modifying the building or
changing the exterior. We don't
believe we're altering the premises
(in this case) at all."
In its letter to Niven, the University
gives tacit approval for the plans but
disagrees with Niven's choice of loca
tion of the two concessionaires.
The letter, signed by Rosemary
McAndrews, manager of campus
properties, states, "We find the con
struction and design features gener
ally acceptable if such alterations are
located in a different part of the store,
away from the front windows."
It adds, in summary, "We are will
ing to approve the alterations if
placed in an appropriate location."

Niven countered that the Univer
sity has never placed constraints on
where he displayed his products. He
said its refusal to approve the plans is
just a stall tactic while the suit to deny
the subleasing is still pending.
"Nowhere in the lease, and
nowhere in the judge's orders, does it
say that Stanford has a righjt to tell us
where we can put our things," Niven
said.
"I think Stanford's whole approach
to this thing is draw it out, drag it out,
make sure we go to court every step
of the way. Stanford is obviously just

maliciously jacking us around."
Niven called the memo a
"contrived way of saying yes but no at
the same time."
The University has claimed that
subleasing to Mrs. Fields and Cone
a-Copia is a breach of Niven's lease
and will adversely affect the competi
tive balance in the shopping plaza.
John Schwartz, a lawyer for the
University, said some stores, includ
ing Cookie Habit, a bakery on the
south side of the mall, are afraid a
Mrs. Fields store would force them
out of business. Schwartz said the

University is obliged to protect its in
vestment in the shopping center by
protecting its tenants from such com
petition.
Schwartz could not explain how
Mrs. Fields would constitute harsh
competition for Cookie Habit when
David's Cookies, a similar store near
Niven's on the north side of the mall,
apparently does not. ,

also based on what the University
feels is misrepresentation on the part
