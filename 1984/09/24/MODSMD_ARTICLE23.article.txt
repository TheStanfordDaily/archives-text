## Mosher decision due in four to six weeks China warns Kennedy to treat case 'properly' 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy is still gathering evidence to aid
him in his decision on whether to
reinstate expelled anthropology
graduate student Steven Mosher, and
will probably issue his verdict within
four to six weeks, according to repre
sentatives of the University's legal
counsel.
Last month, a Chinese official
wrote to Kennedy and implied that
future cultural and educational ex
change programs between the United
States and China may be endangered
if Kennedy readmits Mosher to the
doctoral program.
Wang Ping, an official with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
wrote, "For the future normal and
beneficial exchange between our two
countries, I trust that you will make a
correct judgment, based on the facts,
and properly handle this matter."
The cautionary letter came in
response to Kennedy's queries of
Chinese officials concerning Mosher's
activities in China. Mosher did re
search there as a graduate student in

1979 and 1980. He was expelled
from the University by the Anthro
pology Department in February,
1983.
The faculty committee investigat
ing Mosher determined he was guilty
of "illegal and seriously unethical
conduct" during his trip. He subse
quently appealed the case to Norman
Wessells, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, and Gerald
Lieberman, dean of graduate studies,
but both upheld the decision. Ken
nedy will be the final arbiter in the
matter.
Ping's letter states that Mosher
"violated China's law and brought
'unhappiness.' " It also applauds the
University's original decision to expel
Mosher.
The letter reveals that Chinese offi
cials evaded Kennedy's questions
concerning Mosher's alleged miscon
duct. Ping wrote, "We cannot see the
importance of them (Kennedy's ques
tions) relating to the unlawful behav
ior of Mr. Mosher in China." Ken
nedy wrote to the officials in spring
seeking specific information on Mo
sher's activities.

Kennedy pledged that his decision
would be affected only by portions of
the letter dealing with factual infor
mation concerning Mosher's conduct.
"We didn't ask the Chinese for
help in deciding this case," Kennedy
said. "All we asked for was informa
tion. We got part of that and we pro
pose to decide the case ourselves."
"We plan to pursue our indepen
dent way unswayed," said Iris Brest,
a lawyer for the University. Brest ac

knowledged the Chinese "did not
respond to all of the questions."
Mosher predicted Kennedy would
be disappointed by the lack of "hard
evidence" in the official Chinese
response. The University sent Mo
sher a copy of the document as part of
an agreement to supply him with all
potential evidence in the case.
"1 have to believe that when
Donald Kennedy sees this he will
realize that he's been taken in, and

then he'll give me the Ph.D.," Mo
sher said last week.
Kennedy is expecting to receive ad
ditional evidence in the case from
Mosher's prominent San Francisco
attorney, Melvin Belli. University of
ficials have indicated that this infor
mation will be the last evidence Ken
nedy reviews.
Brest said Kennedy will rule on the
case as soon as all the evidence has
been considered.
"It is a very high priority item with
President Kennedy," she said. "He
will get to it as soon as possible — and
I really mean as soon as possible."
She predicted Kennedy will make a
final decision within four to six
weeks.
In the letter. Ping also asked Ken
nedy to forward a copy of the faculty
investigative committee's report to
Peking officials. The report has previ
ously been kept secret, with copies
issued only to University personnel
investigating the matter and to Mo
sher. Both the University and Mosher
have refused to make the 95-page
report public, saying such disclosure
would endanger innocent Chinese
citizens.
University officials confirmed that
Kennedy would not send a copy of
the report to Chinese officials.
The charges against Mosher are
said to include bribing Chinese offi
cials to obtain government docu

ments, smuggling and venturing into
territory closed to foreigners.
Mosher, however, maintains he
Was dismissed because he wrote an
article condemning Chinese birth
control policies. The article, accom
panied by photographs depicting
naked Chinese women awaiting abor
tions in their eighth month of preg
nancy, was published in a Taiwan
magazine.
Mosher, currently a resident of
Fresno, has pledged to sue the Uni
versity if Kennedy does not rule in his
favor.
In a letter to The Daily, Mosher
said the two documents sent to Ken
nedy by the Chinese as evidence of
his misconduct are "extraordinary."
One, a magazine article entitled
"The Real Face of an Anthropologi
cal Researcher: Was Steven Mosher a
Taiwanese Spy," was planted in the
Hong Kong Journal by Chinese gov
ernment officials, Mosher said.
The other, Mosher said, is a copy of
a "confession" he said he was forced
to sign by Chinese officials. The
Chinese claimed until recently that
Mosher's statement expressed
"sincere apologies" for van trips that
were allegedly unapproved by the
proper authorities. Mosher contends
he had permission to take the trips,
and his signed statement merely ex
pressed "sincere regret" for the mis
communication.

a "confession" he said he was forced

Chinese claimed until recently that
Mosher's statement expressed

he had permission to take the trips,
and his signed statement merely ex
pressed "sincere regret" for the mis
communication.

Former anthropology student Steven Mosher is optimistic new
evidence will convince the University to give him a doctorate.
University President Donald Ken
nedy is still gathering evidence to aid
him in his decision on whether to
reinstate expelled anthropology
graduate student Steven Mosher, and
will probably issue his verdict within
four to six weeks, according to repre
sentatives of the University's legal
counsel.
Last month, a Chinese official
wrote to Kennedy and implied that
future cultural and educational ex
change programs between the United
States and China may be endangered
if Kennedy readmits Mosher to the
doctoral program.
Wang Ping, an official with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
wrote, "For the future normal and
beneficial exchange between our two
countries, I trust that you will make a
correct judgment, based on the facts,
and properly handle this matter."
The cautionary letter came in
response to Kennedy's queries of
Chinese officials concerning Mosher's
activities in China. Mosher did re
search there as a graduate student in

1979 and 1980. He was expelled
from the University by the Anthro
pology Department in February,
1983.
The faculty committee investigat
ing Mosher determined he was guilty
of "illegal and seriously unethical
conduct" during his trip. He subse
quently appealed the case to Norman
Wessells, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, and Gerald
Lieberman, dean of graduate studies,
but both upheld the decision. Ken
nedy will be the final arbiter in the
matter.
Ping's letter states that Mosher
"violated China's law and brought
'unhappiness.' " It also applauds the
University's original decision to expel
Mosher.
The letter reveals that Chinese offi
cials evaded Kennedy's questions
concerning Mosher's alleged miscon
duct. Ping wrote, "We cannot see the
importance of them (Kennedy's ques
tions) relating to the unlawful behav
ior of Mr. Mosher in China." Ken
nedy wrote to the officials in spring
seeking specific information on Mo
sher's activities.

Kennedy pledged that his decision
would be affected only by portions of
the letter dealing with factual infor
mation concerning Mosher's conduct.
"We didn't ask the Chinese for
help in deciding this case," Kennedy
said. "All we asked for was informa
tion. We got part of that and we pro
pose to decide the case ourselves."
"We plan to pursue our indepen
dent way unswayed," said Iris Brest,
a lawyer for the University. Brest ac

knowledged the Chinese "did not
respond to all of the questions."
Mosher predicted Kennedy would
be disappointed by the lack of "hard
evidence" in the official Chinese
response. The University sent Mo
sher a copy of the document as part of
an agreement to supply him with all
potential evidence in the case.
"1 have to believe that when
Donald Kennedy sees this he will
realize that he's been taken in, and

then he'll give me the Ph.D.," Mo
sher said last week.
Kennedy is expecting to receive ad
ditional evidence in the case from
Mosher's prominent San Francisco
attorney, Melvin Belli. University of
ficials have indicated that this infor
mation will be the last evidence Ken
nedy reviews.
Brest said Kennedy will rule on the
case as soon as all the evidence has
been considered.
"It is a very high priority item with
President Kennedy," she said. "He
will get to it as soon as possible — and
I really mean as soon as possible."
She predicted Kennedy will make a
final decision within four to six
weeks.
In the letter. Ping also asked Ken
nedy to forward a copy of the faculty
investigative committee's report to
Peking officials. The report has previ
ously been kept secret, with copies
issued only to University personnel
investigating the matter and to Mo
sher. Both the University and Mosher
have refused to make the 95-page
report public, saying such disclosure
would endanger innocent Chinese
citizens.
University officials confirmed that
Kennedy would not send a copy of
the report to Chinese officials.
The charges against Mosher are
said to include bribing Chinese offi
cials to obtain government docu

ments, smuggling and venturing into
territory closed to foreigners.
Mosher, however, maintains he
Was dismissed because he wrote an

panied by photographs depicting
