# Briefly
## 
### 
We at The Daily are set for a great
year. Val Crites is a senior staff
writer. And if she picks up a story as
signment real soon, she might just
stay that way.
Today the fun begins here at
Storke Publications Building. Fresh
man orientation meetings are sched
uled for 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. today
through Thursday. The first staff
lunch will be held at noon on Wed
nesday.
Edit board will hold an emergency,

unplanned, and completely extem
poraneous meeting on Tuesday. Troy
Eid is welcome to attend; Tess is not.
There is a full-page house ad on
page 15 that all non-staffers should
turn to when done reading this
message. It is a good ad, too, because
we put Mitch in charge of it. Had we
put Tim in charge, it most likely
would not have been a very good
house ad.
In case you haven't figured this out
yet, Briefly is a space we reserve for

notes to our staff members â€” notes
which mean absolutely nothing to or
dinary readers like yourself. Notes
which mean very little to people like
Ben Page, who spend about four
hours here each year and then call
themselves staff members.
Briefly is often an outlet for jour
nalistic frustrations, a calendar of up
coming events worth attending, and
even an exercise in creative writing.
In fact, at times Briefly is almost
everything but brief.
