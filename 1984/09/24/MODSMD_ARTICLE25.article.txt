## Sports Stanford uses blitz to seal victory 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The fourth time isn't a charm.
The San Jose State football team,
in search of its fourth straight victory
over Stanford, found that out with 27
seconds remaining in Saturday's
game and the ball on the Cardinal 25-
yard line. It also found out that run
ning smack into a blitz can be hazar
dous to a team's health.
Behind 28-27, the Spartans had
driven 45 yards in 47 seconds and
place-kicker Luis Comesana was
ready to trot on and attempt what
would be the winning field goal. "We
thought the play would work," San
Jose State Coach Claude Gilbert said
of his second-down call. "We thought
it would give us better field position
for a field goal attempt."
San Jose State quarterback Bob
Frasco, who had successfully attacked
the Stanford secondary with medium
range passes, took the snap and
handed it to tailback Randy Walker.
The Cardinal defense was in what it
calls a "safety tank" blitz. Walker, all
5-foot-7 of him, ran into it. No con
test — fumble.
The ball barely hit the grass before
Stanford linebacker Matt Soderlund,
blitzing on the play, had pounced on
it.
Stanford ball, 23 seconds left, game

over. Final score: Stanford 28, San
Jose State 27.
"I cut my little finger on someone's
helmet," Soderlund said of the game
saving fumble recovery. "I had the
ball, but I had so much blood on my
hands that I had trouble holding on to
it. But I was deliriously happy."
Gilbert had a shorter explanation.
"We ran the wrong play into the right
defense."
Or to simplify things even further,
Stanford got lucky.
Nonetheless, a win's a win. Never
mind that it took, among other things,
a missed San Jose State extra point, a
91-yard touchdown drive by Stanford
with 3:19 remaining and Walker's
fumble. Never mind that this was
against a team that lost to Arizona
State — Stanford's next opponent —
48-0, last week and Nevada-Las
Vegas, 30-15, the week before. And
never mind that Nevada sports
bookies wouldn't put a betting line on
the game. Stanford Coach Jack Elway
will take it.
So will sophomore quarterback
John Paye and his teammates. "I
think to have a successful season, you
have to come out and win some
games like these," Paye said. "It
really shows the character of this
team."
Not only was the victory Stanford's

first over the Spartans in four years, it
was its second victory in three tries
this season — already eclipsing last
year's total.
With 4:48 left in the game,
however, it looked as if the Spartans
would continue their recent
dominance over the Cardinal. They
had rebounded from a 21-10 first
half deficit by scoring 17 unanswered
points to take a 27-21 lead late in the
third quarter. Paye untracked the of
fense (which has yet to score in the
third quarter) enough to drive 67
yards to the Spartans' 26.
Fullback Brian Morris, still slowed
by an ankle injury, was inserted into
the lineup. Paye pitched right to Mor
ris, and watched as the 6-foot-3, 216-
pound Morris threw an option pass
into the hands of Frank Witherspoon.
The only problem was that Wither
spoon is a Spartan.
"I was put into the game because
(Kaulana) Park and (Brad) Muster
were out, not just to run that play,"
Morris said. "I was a little surprised
when the call came in for 328 — an
option pass. I was a little cold on the
bench."
So if it was an option pass, why
didn't he choose option number two
and run? "I thought (wide receiver
