# THE 						STANFORD DAILY
## Sports Stanford uses blitz to seal victory 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The fourth time isn't a charm.
The San Jose State football team,
in search of its fourth straight victory
over Stanford, found that out with 27
seconds remaining in Saturday's
game and the ball on the Cardinal 25-
yard line. It also found out that run
ning smack into a blitz can be hazar
dous to a team's health.
Behind 28-27, the Spartans had
driven 45 yards in 47 seconds and
place-kicker Luis Comesana was
ready to trot on and attempt what
would be the winning field goal. "We
thought the play would work," San
Jose State Coach Claude Gilbert said
of his second-down call. "We thought
it would give us better field position
for a field goal attempt."
San Jose State quarterback Bob
Frasco, who had successfully attacked
the Stanford secondary with medium
range passes, took the snap and
handed it to tailback Randy Walker.
The Cardinal defense was in what it
calls a "safety tank" blitz. Walker, all
5-foot-7 of him, ran into it. No con
test — fumble.
The ball barely hit the grass before
Stanford linebacker Matt Soderlund,
blitzing on the play, had pounced on
it.
Stanford ball, 23 seconds left, game

over. Final score: Stanford 28, San
Jose State 27.
"I cut my little finger on someone's
helmet," Soderlund said of the game
saving fumble recovery. "I had the
ball, but I had so much blood on my
hands that I had trouble holding on to
it. But I was deliriously happy."
Gilbert had a shorter explanation.
"We ran the wrong play into the right
defense."
Or to simplify things even further,
Stanford got lucky.
Nonetheless, a win's a win. Never
mind that it took, among other things,
a missed San Jose State extra point, a
91-yard touchdown drive by Stanford
with 3:19 remaining and Walker's
fumble. Never mind that this was
against a team that lost to Arizona
State — Stanford's next opponent —
48-0, last week and Nevada-Las
Vegas, 30-15, the week before. And
never mind that Nevada sports
bookies wouldn't put a betting line on
the game. Stanford Coach Jack Elway
will take it.
So will sophomore quarterback
John Paye and his teammates. "I
think to have a successful season, you
have to come out and win some
games like these," Paye said. "It
really shows the character of this
team."
Not only was the victory Stanford's

first over the Spartans in four years, it
was its second victory in three tries
this season — already eclipsing last
year's total.
With 4:48 left in the game,
however, it looked as if the Spartans
would continue their recent
dominance over the Cardinal. They
had rebounded from a 21-10 first
half deficit by scoring 17 unanswered
points to take a 27-21 lead late in the
third quarter. Paye untracked the of
fense (which has yet to score in the
third quarter) enough to drive 67
yards to the Spartans' 26.
Fullback Brian Morris, still slowed
by an ankle injury, was inserted into
the lineup. Paye pitched right to Mor
ris, and watched as the 6-foot-3, 216-
pound Morris threw an option pass
into the hands of Frank Witherspoon.
The only problem was that Wither
spoon is a Spartan.
"I was put into the game because
(Kaulana) Park and (Brad) Muster
were out, not just to run that play,"
Morris said. "I was a little surprised
when the call came in for 328 — an
option pass. I was a little cold on the
bench."
So if it was an option pass, why
didn't he choose option number two
and run? "I thought (wide receiver

Emile) Harry was open, but they
were in a double zone," Morris said.
"It was my first college passing at
tempt and hopefully my last."
Although the interception left
Stanford in a hole, the Cardinal was
in a deeper one with 3:19 to go. After
Witherspoon's interception, the Spar
tans moved the ball close to midfield
before punting to the Stanford 13. A
clipping penalty moved the ball to the
nine-yard line.
Two plays later, Stanford was
forced to make the first of three
keep-the-drive-alive plays. On third
and nine from the 10, Paye left Spar
tan defensive end Talmadge Morning
tackling air in the endzone with a spin
move and found Harry on the right
sideline for a 27-yard gain.
"It was a streak pattern," Harry
said. "I had my guy beat. I turned and
the ball was in the air in front of me.
My part was easy. All the credit goes
to John."

Five plays later, Paye was at it
again. This time, he scrambled to his
right, away from a San Jose State
blitz, and saw open field. After 34
yards, Paye stepped out of bounds at
the Spartans' 16.
But it was two plays later, with
1:14 left, that the play of the drive
was made. Tailback Thomas Henley,
who had scored Stanford's first
touchdown, returned, despite a
shoulder injury, to work a little
magic.
On second and 11 from the 17, El
way called for Henley to run a tail
back reverse right — everyone goes
left except left guard Matt Moran,
wide reciever Jeff James and Henley.
"It was a misdirection play, and our
blockers really blew them out," said
Henley, who ran between Moran and
James into the end zone virtually un
touched.
Henley won Pacific 10 Conference
and Sports Illustrated Player of the
Week honors last week for his 250
all-purpose yards against Illinois.
"I hurt my (left) shoulder Wednes

day in practice and hurt it again on
the first touchdown (Saturday)," he
said. "After I came out, Dr. (Donald)
Bunce told me I probably shouldn't
go back in, but I convinced him I was
all right. I wanted to win the game.
Whatever I could contribute, I
wanted to do it."
On the other side of the field, it was
Frasco who was doing most of the
"contributing" for the Spartans. Still
sore from a hip pointer that sidelined
him last week against Arizona State,
Frasco completed 25-of-43 passes for
333 yards, one touchdown and no in
terceptions. And when he wasn't
passing, he often scrambled for big
gains.
"We ran into a hot quarterback
today," said Elway, who coached
Frasco at San Jose State last season.
"He's clever, he moves around well
and he knows who to throw to. And
they caught the ball for him."
The "theys" who caught the ball
were receivers Kevin Bowman (9
catches, 122 yards) and Tony Smith
(8 catches, 171 yards).
