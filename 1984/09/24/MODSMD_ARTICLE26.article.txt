# Stanford loses in Oklahoma, upsets Illinois to open 1984

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
As was the case this year, the Stanford football team
opened last season with non-conference games against
Oklahoma and Illinois. The final statistics were indicative
of what became a 1-10 season.
After two games, Stanford amassed 44 yards rushing on
45 carries. The Cardinal had been penalized 15 times for
160 yards. It had 27 first downs to the opposition's 46.
The opposition also had run 39 more plays.
Two games. Two losses.
But that was last year. And as first-year coach Jack El
way told his players when they returned for preseason
practice, "Let's forget about that."
They have, and the difference is evident. In games
against the same two teams, Stanford not only improved
statistically, it won a game, equalling its win total of a year
ago.
"I told them (the team) if we win too much," Elway
joked after the Cardinal's 34-19 upset over Illinois Sept.
15, "we'll lose our psychological advantage over other
teams. They'll think we're for real. But we'll give that up
for more wins."

NORMAN, OKLA. — Elway might have thought he
was still in bed and dreaming after Stanford's first posses
sion. Most of the 75,008 — Oklahoma's 59th straight sell
out crowd — might have thought they were having a
nightmare when the Cardinal took the opening kickoff
and began driving down the field.
Nine plays and 71 yards later, quarterback John Paye
found tight end Greg Baty wide open across the middle
and Baty, a 6-foot-5 junior, scored. Mark Harmon added
the extra point and Stanford led, 7-0, 2:04 into the game.
The Sooners, under pressure to improve on what Okla
homa fans considered a disastrous 1983 season (8-4), had
not touched the ball and the home crowd was voicing its
disapproval of Coach Barry Switzer.
"After the first drive I was confident we would be able
to move the ball and score some more," Elway said. "But
it didn't happen."
Why didn't it happen? Oklahoma's defense. The
