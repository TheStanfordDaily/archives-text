# Stanford loses in Oklahoma, upsets Illinois to open 1984
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
As was the case this year, the Stanford football team
opened last season with non-conference games against
Oklahoma and Illinois. The final statistics were indicative
of what became a 1-10 season.
After two games, Stanford amassed 44 yards rushing on
45 carries. The Cardinal had been penalized 15 times for
160 yards. It had 27 first downs to the opposition's 46.
The opposition also had run 39 more plays.
Two games. Two losses.
But that was last year. And as first-year coach Jack El
way told his players when they returned for preseason
practice, "Let's forget about that."
They have, and the difference is evident. In games
against the same two teams, Stanford not only improved
statistically, it won a game, equalling its win total of a year
ago.
"I told them (the team) if we win too much," Elway
joked after the Cardinal's 34-19 upset over Illinois Sept.
15, "we'll lose our psychological advantage over other
teams. They'll think we're for real. But we'll give that up
for more wins."

Sept. 8
NORMAN, OKLA. — Elway might have thought he
was still in bed and dreaming after Stanford's first posses
sion. Most of the 75,008 — Oklahoma's 59th straight sell
out crowd — might have thought they were having a
nightmare when the Cardinal took the opening kickoff
and began driving down the field.
Nine plays and 71 yards later, quarterback John Paye
found tight end Greg Baty wide open across the middle
and Baty, a 6-foot-5 junior, scored. Mark Harmon added
the extra point and Stanford led, 7-0, 2:04 into the game.
The Sooners, under pressure to improve on what Okla
homa fans considered a disastrous 1983 season (8-4), had
not touched the ball and the home crowd was voicing its
disapproval of Coach Barry Switzer.
"After the first drive I was confident we would be able
to move the ball and score some more," Elway said. "But
it didn't happen."
Why didn't it happen? Oklahoma's defense. The

Sooners, who did not know what to expect from Elway
and Stanford, made some defensive adjustments that, El
way said, "made us feel inept offensively."
After shutting down the Cardinal's running game,
Oklahoma began stifling Stanford's passing attack as well.
The Sooners began rushing four, five and six defenders
and tightened their secondary coverage.
The result? Stanford got six first downs up to the middle
of the fourth quarter, when it began to move the ball
again. By then, however, the Sooners were in front, 19-7,
and employed a prevent defense that took pressure off
Cardinal receivers.
Meanwhile, a strong Cardinal defensive effort went vir
tually unnoticed. Though Oklahoma had a pair of first
half touchdown drives, Stanford held the Sooners'
wishbone attack to 258 yards rushing and 84 passing.
Stanford 34, Illinois 19
Sept. 15
Following Stanford's upset victory over the defending
Big 10 Conference champions, Illinois Coach Mike White
had a few words with President Donald Kennedy, a friend
from his days as a Stanford assistant.

"After 1-10, that first win is really hard," White said.
"But your guys just outplayed us."
Stanford's offensive and defensive lines outplayed their
Illini counterparts. Paye had time to throw, whereas Illi
nois quarterback Jack Trudeau didn't. Paye completed
19-of-33 passes for 295 yards and no interceptions.
Trudeau completed 24-of-40 for 226 yards and three in
terceptions.
All three interceptions were in the fourth quarter, when
Trudeau and Illinois were trying to come back from a 31-
19 deficit. Linebacker Dave Wyman, safety Ed St. Geme
and cornerback Eric Price made the three interceptions
that, Elway said, "turned the momentum and put the
lights out."
Offensively, Paye had what he called the best day of his
Stanford career. But it was tailback Thomas Henley who
earned headlines. Henley caught 10 passes for 151 yards,
rushed for 51 more on 13 carries, returned two kickoffs
for 48 yards and scored one touchdown. For his efforts, he
won Pacific 10 Conference and Sports Illustrated Player
of the Week honors.
If there was a Play of the Week award, Stanford might
have won that, too. With 55 seconds left in the first half,
Paye threw into the end zone to fullback Kaulana Park,
who couldn't hang on to the ball. Park juggled the ball
twice and tipped it into the air on his way down. Wide
receiver Emile Harry was in the vicinity and grabbed
Park's tip to give the Cardinal a 21-13 lead.

Oklahoma 19, Stanford 7
Sept. 8
NORMAN, OKLA. — Elway might have thought he
was still in bed and dreaming after Stanford's first posses
sion. Most of the 75,008 — Oklahoma's 59th straight sell
out crowd — might have thought they were having a
nightmare when the Cardinal took the opening kickoff
and began driving down the field.
Nine plays and 71 yards later, quarterback John Paye
found tight end Greg Baty wide open across the middle
and Baty, a 6-foot-5 junior, scored. Mark Harmon added
the extra point and Stanford led, 7-0, 2:04 into the game.
The Sooners, under pressure to improve on what Okla
homa fans considered a disastrous 1983 season (8-4), had
not touched the ball and the home crowd was voicing its
disapproval of Coach Barry Switzer.
"After the first drive I was confident we would be able
to move the ball and score some more," Elway said. "But
it didn't happen."
Why didn't it happen? Oklahoma's defense. The

Stanford receiver Emiie Harry caught two passes on the Cardinal's touchdown drive against Oklahoma Sept.
8. Harry caught his 100 th pass against the Sooners and is the 12th Stanford player to achieve that record.
Sooners, who did not know what to expect from Elway
and Stanford, made some defensive adjustments that, El
way said, "made us feel inept offensively."
After shutting down the Cardinal's running game,
Oklahoma began stifling Stanford's passing attack as well.
The Sooners began rushing four, five and six defenders
and tightened their secondary coverage.
The result? Stanford got six first downs up to the middle
of the fourth quarter, when it began to move the ball
again. By then, however, the Sooners were in front, 19-7,
and employed a prevent defense that took pressure off
Cardinal receivers.
Meanwhile, a strong Cardinal defensive effort went vir
tually unnoticed. Though Oklahoma had a pair of first
half touchdown drives, Stanford held the Sooners'
wishbone attack to 258 yards rushing and 84 passing.
Stanford 34, Illinois 19
Sept. 15
Following Stanford's upset victory over the defending
Big 10 Conference champions, Illinois Coach Mike White
had a few words with President Donald Kennedy, a friend
from his days as a Stanford assistant.

"After 1-10, that first win is really hard," White said.
"But your guys just outplayed us."
Stanford's offensive and defensive lines outplayed their
Illini counterparts. Paye had time to throw, whereas Illi
nois quarterback Jack Trudeau didn't. Paye completed
19-of-33 passes for 295 yards and no interceptions.
Trudeau completed 24-of-40 for 226 yards and three in
terceptions.
All three interceptions were in the fourth quarter, when
Trudeau and Illinois were trying to come back from a 31-
19 deficit. Linebacker Dave Wyman, safety Ed St. Geme
and cornerback Eric Price made the three interceptions
that, Elway said, "turned the momentum and put the
lights out."
Offensively, Paye had what he called the best day of his
Stanford career. But it was tailback Thomas Henley who
earned headlines. Henley caught 10 passes for 151 yards,
rushed for 51 more on 13 carries, returned two kickoffs
for 48 yards and scored one touchdown. For his efforts, he
won Pacific 10 Conference and Sports Illustrated Player
of the Week honors.
If there was a Play of the Week award, Stanford might
have won that, too. With 55 seconds left in the first half,
Paye threw into the end zone to fullback Kaulana Park,
who couldn't hang on to the ball. Park juggled the ball
twice and tipped it into the air on his way down. Wide
receiver Emile Harry was in the vicinity and grabbed
Park's tip to give the Cardinal a 21-13 lead.
