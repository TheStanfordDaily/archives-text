# Briehl's stats no mistake
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The new statistics computer in
the Stanford Stadium press box
broke down after Saturday's
Stanford-San Jose State game. It
did things like credit placekicker
Mark Harmon with breaking up a
pass.
It also said Stanford outside
linebacker Tom Briehl made a
team-high 11 tackles, six of them
unassisted and four of them for
losses. But anyone who saw Stan
ford defeat San Jose State, 28-27,
knows Briehl's numbers were no
computer error.
The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Briehl
seemed to be in on every play.
When the Spartans threw the ball,
he was breaking up pass plays or
pressuring the quarterback. When
they ran, he was in their backfield
so often that Spartan quarterback
Bob Frasco might have thought
Briehl was on his team.
"Tom played pretty well," Stan
ford Defensive Coordinator Dick
Mannini said. "He's played three
pretty good games for us this
season. He's played as well as
anyone else on the defense, and
he's played more consistently than
anyone else."
Although Briehl doesn't lead
Stanford in tackles, he does have a
commanding edge in another cate
gory — tackles for losses. His four
tackles for losses Saturday brought
his season total to six. The next
closest Cardinal defender is tackle
Garin Veris with three.
"I was happy with some of the
plays I made," Briehl said aftei Sat
urday's game. "But I made a few
key mistakes. So I'm not totally
satisfied with the way I played."
One thing Briehl is satisfied with
is Stanford's new defensive align
ment (the change to a 3-4 from last
year's 4-3) and philosophy. "Last
year, we didn't have a bad
defense," he said. "We just waited
for things to happen. 'Bend, don't
break,' was our motto.
"But this year, we're more ag
gressive and try to make the big
plays. We're going to give up big
plays, but we're hoping that we'll
make more big plays than we'll give
up."
Underlying this new defensive
attitude of aggressiveness is the
blitz, something Briehl and fellow
linebackers love to do. "I really en
joy the blitz," he said. "This is the
first year we've had a blitzing pack
age since I've been at Stanford."
The blitz, in fact, was what

caused the San Jose State fumble in
the closing seconds of the game.
The Spartans' Randy Walker ran
into a "safety tank" blitz and
fumbled the ball, which inside
linebacker Matt Soderlund
recovered to seal the victory.
Stanford will get a chance to
match its new zest for blitzing Sat
urday against Arizona State, a team
whose middle name could be Blitz.
"Both teams will be doing the same
thing," said Briehl, a Phoenix
native who was recruited heavily by
the Sun Devils. "It will be a wild
game. They have an inexperienced
quarterback (freshman John
Walker), so we will try to put some
pressure on him early.
"After you get to the quarter
back a while, he'll throw it a little
sooner and after a few hits, he'll get
out of the pocket a little earlier. So,
pressure does help."
But you don't get something for
nothing. Blitzing is a gamble. "We
can take gambles," Briehl said,
"because we have the players to do
it with. I think the strength of our
linebackers is our speed. No one
runs over a 4.7 (-second 40-yard
dash)."
Briehl has trophies to back up
his part of the speed claim. He was

the Arizona state 440-yard run
champion his junior and senior
years at Gerard High School. He
also placed in the state long jump
competition in 1981.
Besides speed, the Cardinal
linebacking corps has experience.
Three of the four starters — Briehl,
Wyman and Soderlund — have ex
tensive game experience from past
years. Only Tom Prukop, an offen
sive lineman before making the
transition to linebacker, is new to
the position.
Briehl, who played nose guard in
high school ("I went to a high
school where if you were over 200
pounds, you were automatically a
lineman," he said.), is the only one
of the four starters that has no
eligibility remaining after this
season.
So what are his chances as a pro
fessional? Though Briehl shied
away from answering that question,
Mannini didn't hesitate to offer his
opinion. "I think he has a chance
because of his size, strength and
speed, and because of his intelli
gence," Mannini said. "He has a
great awareness of what's happen
ing on the field at all times."
Just ask the San Jose State of
fense.
