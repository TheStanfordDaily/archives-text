# Water polo team loses, jeopardizes playoffs
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
At first glance, No. 4-ranked Stan
ford's 7-4 loss to Fresno State's N0.7-
ranked water polo team at Fresno last
Saturday might not seem to be a sig
nificant event. In any other major
collegiate sport such a mild upset
would make little difference in a long
season.
But water polo plays by slightly dif
ferent rules, and the results of such a
loss can be significant. In order to
receive a postseason berth from the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion's western region, the Cardinal
must finish among the region's top
five teams.
Since the top eight teams in the
country are in the western region, the
potential effect of a loss is amplified.
"Losing to Fresno may have knocked
us down to number five or six in the
country and maybe out of the playoff

picture," Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti said.
But the Cardinal might not have
been considering the effects of losing,
especially since it was playing a team
it thought it would defeat easily. "The
guys thought it was going to be easy,"
Dettamanti said.
The Bulldogs had other ideas,
despite the fact that the Cardinal had
already beaten them twice this
season. The first time, Stanford beat
them 7-0 and then took a 4-3 deci
sion at the University of California at
Irvine Tournament Sept. 14.
Stanford's play was ridden with
mistakes and poor execution of strat
egy, Dettamanti said. The Cardinal
had 11 opportunities when it had a
man advantage, but managed three
goals. Dettamanti said his team
"threw the ball right to Fresno
players" or was stopped by Bulldog
goalie Ron Copeland.

"You should score at least 50 per
cent of the time when you're up a
man," Dettamanti said. "Copeland
always gives us a hard time, too."
Copeland had 17 saves.
Stanford goalie Steve Moyer had;
what Dettamanti called a "usual let-;
down against weaker teams." Moyer
gave up three goals in the fourth peri
iod, after Fresno had tied the scortf,
4-4, entering the fourth period.
On Friday, Stanford defeated th?
University of Pacific, 11-5. Jose
Velez and Mark Daley scored three
goals apiece, the Cardinal's leading'
scorer, David Imbernino, scored two
goals.
In earlier action, the Cardinal
finished fifth at the Irvine Tourna*
ment, despite beating No. 1-ranked
Irvine . %
The Cardinal beat the University ail
California at Santa Barbara, 12-2, in;
its only other preseason game.
