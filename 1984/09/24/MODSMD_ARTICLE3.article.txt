# Stanford drives ahead on Willow extension

### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The Palo Alto City Council paved the way for an exten
sion of Willow Road to El Camino Real last week, ap
proving a thoroughfare that will serve more than 6,000
commuters daily and will cost the University more than
$2.5 million.
The council's 7 to 2 vote in favor of the extension ended
10 years of exhaustive discussion and negotiation between
the University and the city on the project. The pro
posed 2,400-foot road addition, extending from Arbore
tum Drive to EI Camino just north of the Stanford Shop
ping Center, is designed to ease traffic congestion in the
shopping center's parking lots as well as an outlying
campus and residential streets.
In making its decision, the nine-member council

rejected i Palo Alto Planning Commission recommenda
tion to attach 19 conditions to the project. The Planning
Commission's suggestions would have doubled the cost of
the project and given Menlo Park final veto power.
The council did attach four major provisions to the
project, but IJaiversity officials say the conditions are
reasonable and the University will begin construction next
spring. The two-lane project should take approximately
six months to complete, and the entire cost will be borne
by the University.
The conditions call for:
• The extension to stop at El Camino. There was some
concern that the road would someday cross El Camino
and connect with Alma Street, a move the council felt
would create unnecessary traffic and construction;
• The University to fund road improvements along the

corridor totalling $300,000;
• Future development at the shopping center to be lim
ited until the University and the city can agree on a devel
opment plan for that area;
• The University to keep Palo Alto informed of all plans
for gv 86-acre parcel of land just south of the corridor.
In addition, the council voted to change the name of the
road from Willow to Sand Hill. Sand Hill now refers to the
entire road from Interstate 280 east to El Camino.
The project awaits final approval from the California
Department of Transportation.
Andy Doty, director of community relations for the
University, said the University would have scrapped the
project if the Planning Commission's "excessive" recom
mendations were upheld by the council.
"We're pleased with the outcome," Doty said. "We're

pleased the city didn't attach unacceptable conditions."
William Massy, Stanford vice president for business and
finance, said the council's decision was "quite a positive
action." Massy said the "watershed" came in a compro
mise with the city concerning the 86-acre parcel, which
lies outside of Palo Alto jurisdiction. Last year, Palo Alto
attempted to exercise control over that land when it at
tached conditions to the Stanford West faculty housing
proposal that ultimately proved unacceptable to the Uni
versity.
The compromise gives the University total control over
that land. The University maintained that because the 86
acres are outside of Palo Alto, the city has no jurisdiction
and little say in its development. Several council mem
