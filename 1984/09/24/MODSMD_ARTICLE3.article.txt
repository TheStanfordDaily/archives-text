# Stanford drives ahead on Willow extension
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The Palo Alto City Council paved the way for an exten
sion of Willow Road to El Camino Real last week, ap
proving a thoroughfare that will serve more than 6,000
commuters daily and will cost the University more than
$2.5 million.
The council's 7 to 2 vote in favor of the extension ended
10 years of exhaustive discussion and negotiation between
the University and the city on the project. The pro
posed 2,400-foot road addition, extending from Arbore
tum Drive to EI Camino just north of the Stanford Shop
ping Center, is designed to ease traffic congestion in the
shopping center's parking lots as well as an outlying
campus and residential streets.
In making its decision, the nine-member council

rejected i Palo Alto Planning Commission recommenda
tion to attach 19 conditions to the project. The Planning
Commission's suggestions would have doubled the cost of
the project and given Menlo Park final veto power.
The council did attach four major provisions to the
project, but IJaiversity officials say the conditions are
reasonable and the University will begin construction next
spring. The two-lane project should take approximately
six months to complete, and the entire cost will be borne
by the University.
The conditions call for:
• The extension to stop at El Camino. There was some
concern that the road would someday cross El Camino
and connect with Alma Street, a move the council felt
would create unnecessary traffic and construction;
• The University to fund road improvements along the

corridor totalling $300,000;
• Future development at the shopping center to be lim
ited until the University and the city can agree on a devel
opment plan for that area;
• The University to keep Palo Alto informed of all plans
for gv 86-acre parcel of land just south of the corridor.
In addition, the council voted to change the name of the
road from Willow to Sand Hill. Sand Hill now refers to the
entire road from Interstate 280 east to El Camino.
The project awaits final approval from the California
Department of Transportation.
Andy Doty, director of community relations for the
University, said the University would have scrapped the
project if the Planning Commission's "excessive" recom
mendations were upheld by the council.
"We're pleased with the outcome," Doty said. "We're

pleased the city didn't attach unacceptable conditions."
William Massy, Stanford vice president for business and
finance, said the council's decision was "quite a positive
action." Massy said the "watershed" came in a compro
mise with the city concerning the 86-acre parcel, which
lies outside of Palo Alto jurisdiction. Last year, Palo Alto
attempted to exercise control over that land when it at
tached conditions to the Stanford West faculty housing
proposal that ultimately proved unacceptable to the Uni
versity.
The compromise gives the University total control over
that land. The University maintained that because the 86
acres are outside of Palo Alto, the city has no jurisdiction
and little say in its development. Several council mem
bers, including Palo Alto Mayor Larry Klein, strained to
establish city control over the parcel but were unsuccess
ful.
Another major obstacle was averted when the coun
cil rejected a provision that would have given Menlo Park
veto power over the project.
The Planning Commission had recommended that the
University expand the Sand Hill-Santa Cruz intersection,
a move that would have required approval from the
Menlo Park City Council. Menlo Park council members,
however, had indicated they would have voted against the
expansion.
But Klein said he doubted the council would ever give
Menlo Park veto power over a Palo Alto issue.
The decision to reject the Menlo Park provision was a
major victory for the University and dispelled rumors that
Palo Alto would "kill" the project by deferring it to
Menlo Park, where it would surely be voted down.
Doty said the conditions were not overly egregious and
the University would abide by them. He also seemed
relieved that many months of paperwork and lobbying are
behind him.
"This is not the trans-Canada-Alaskan highway, al
though at times I thought it was tantamount to that," he
said.
Doty said the council's favorable decision indicates the
University's success in convincing council and community
members of the project's merits.
"The burden on us was to demonstrate that this road

(1) will not harm the city; (2) will benefit the shopping
center; and (3) will not enable the University to do some
thing to lands that it cannot already do," he said.
Massy elaborated on this last point at the council
meeting last Tuesday, claiming that the road extension
and the future of the Stanford West housing project are
two independent projects.
"The extension will not open up new areas of Stanford
land for development," Massy said in a prepared state
ment to the council. "Those areas could be developed
with or without the road.
"The extension is not essential to the construction of
housing on Stanford West," he continued.
The "completion" of the Sand Hill corridor culminates
more than 30 years of discussion, dating back to proposals
for a "Willow Freeway" in the 19505. The extension will
stand as a monument to the University's sometimes in
tense and ultimately successful lobbying efforts.
According to Doty, it's no secret why the University has
committed so much time, energy and money to the proj
ect: "It's been a mess over there for decades, and this
seems to be the most prudent solution."
Doty acknowledged the extension will probably ap
pease campus commuters who, for years, have com
plained about the afternoon rush-hour conditions along
Willow.
Just how the extension will affect traffic on the west side
of campus remains to be seen. While most agree that
congestion will be no worse — as many had originally
feared — the extension may not be the elixir to traffic
woes either.
"I don't see the road extension as being anything all
that great," Mayor Klein said. "People will still be backed
up on Willow."
