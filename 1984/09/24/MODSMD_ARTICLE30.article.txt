# Stanford volleyball team defeated, could fall in rankings

### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
After moving last week from third to second behind
top-ranked Pacific in a coaches top 20 poll, the Stanford
women's volleyball team's ranking probably will change
again.
However, the Cardinal's ranking probably will not im
prove after its straight-set loss to the University of South
ern California Saturday.
The Trojans, ranked third, defeated the Cardinal, 15-
11, 15-8, 15-10. It was Stanford's first loss after three vic
tories. The Cardinal is 1-1 in the Western Collegiate Ath

letic Association.
USC began practicing and playing before Stanford, ac
cording to Cardinal Asst. Coach Don Shaw, and the Stan
ford coaching staff was not very disappointed with the
loss. Shaw said the Cardinal played better against USC
than it did in a four-set victory over Cal-State Fullerton
Friday.
According to Shaw, Stanford played sluggishly in its 15-
8,15-9,6-15,15-10 victory. Shaw said the Cardinal drove
two hours in traffic to its 7:30 game and played soon
thereafter.

Stanford opened its season at home Sept. 15 against
San Jose State and defeated the Spartans, 16-14, 12-15,
15-4, 15-5. In that match, junior hitter Kim Oden had 17
kills, 10 solo blocks and had a .552 hitting percentage.
Meanwhile, senior hitter Bobbie Broer had 13 kills and a
.478 hitting percentage.
Oden, an All-American, led the nation in blocks and
was in the top 10 in hitting percentage and kills-per-game
last season. She also was named the Most Valuable Player
in the WCAA last season and to the all conference first
team for the second straight year.
According to the Cardinal coaching staff, freshman

Wendi Rush played well. Rush, considered by many the
top high school volleyball player in the nation last season,
had 37 assists and led Stanford in service aces (8) against
San Jose State and the University of California at
Berkeley. Rush is the sister of former Cardinal Kari Rush,
a co-captain last season as a senior.
In a 15-3, 15-12, 15-13 victory over Cal last Wednes
day, Broer had 10 kills and Oden eight. Freshman hitter
Nancy Reno had seven kills and a hitting percentage of
.545.
Stanford will play at the University of Santa Clara to
morrow at 7:30 p.m.
