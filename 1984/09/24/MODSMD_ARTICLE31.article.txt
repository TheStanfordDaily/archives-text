### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford men's soccer team
had its share of early-season victories,
but it also suffered a key loss.
The Cardinal tied Westmont, 1-1,
Saturday and is 3-2-2. Its early
matches included play in the Far
West Classic Sept. 5-8 at Seattle,
where it finished third.
But the Cardinal lost senior
midfielder Angel Vazquez for the
season with a broken foot during the
tournament. Vazquez suffered that
injury in a 1-0 loss to Warner Pacific
in Stanford's fifth game, and Stanford
first-year Coach Sam Koch said Vaz
quez will be redshirted this season.

Vazquez missed much of last
season because of a severely sprained
ankle after scoring four goals and
recording three assists. He was an
All-Pacific Soccer Conference (All-
PSC) player his freshman and sopho
more seasons.
The Cardinal opened its season by
tying Pacific Lutheran University, 1-
1, at the Classic, which was hosted by
Seattle Pacific University. Stanford
advanced in the tournament by
making three of four penalty kicks in
the second overtime period. PLU
made two of its four penalty shots.
Senior forward Giancarlo Ferruzzi,
the Cardinal's leading scorer last
season with 11 goals and five assists,

scored Stanford's goal against PLU.
Ferruzzi was an honorable mention
All-PSC player last season.
In its second Classic game, Stan
ford was defeated, 3-1, by Seattle
Pacific, which won the tournament.
Vazquez scored the Cardinal's goal.
Koch said Seattle Pacific is ranked
No. 1 in Division II of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association.
Stanford got its first victory when it
defeated Chapman, 3-0. Ferruzzi
scored on an assist by Tom
Rafalovich, and freshman walk-on
Brian Mahaffey scored and assisted
on a goal by forward Jim Cole. Chap
man is ranked fourth in Division 11,
Koch said.

On Sept. 10 the Cardinal won its
regular season opener, 3-1, against
Cal-State Dominguez Hills, which
had been 3-0. Vazquez assisted on
goals by junior forward Rob West
and Ferruzzi. Senior midfielder Fred
Ueland scored Stanford's third goal,
with Ferruzzi and West assisting.
In its loss against Warner Pacific,
Stanford "played about 70 minutes
shorthanded," Koch said. "One of
our players got redcarded
(disqualified) early.
The Stanford women's soccer team
lost, 2-1, to University of California
at Davis Saturday, falling to 0-3 for
the season.
