### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford women's cross
country team used second, third and
fourth-place finishes to win the
Fresno Invitational by 27 points Sat
urday.
The Cardinal women scored 25
points in the five-kilometer race, and
second-place University of California
at Santa Barbara had 52. In the 10-
kilometer men's race, Stanford
finished second, scoring 68 points
while winner Fresno State had 27. It
was the season opener for the Car
dinal men's and women's teams.
Senior Regina Jacobs led the Stan
ford women with a second-place
finish in 16:43. Junior Alison Wiley
was third at 16:50, and freshman
Kathy Smith was fourth in 17:23.
Senior Michelle Mason was seventh,
with a time of 18:19.
Senior Ceci Hopp, sophomore
Cory Schubert and freshman Chris
Curtin did not run for the Cardinal
women, and Coach Brooks Johnson

said "that's probably why we didn't
run as well as we could have (as a
team)."
Johnson said the women's score
was "the biggest in the last three
years. We're usually much under that
â€” usually by about 10 points."
The Stanford men were led by a
second-place finish by sophomore
Marc Olesen, who ran a 30:33 race.
Winner Pete Brett of Fresno State
had a 30:19. Cardinal Ryan Stohl was
fifth with 31:19.
"We had some people who didn't
run as well as they're capable of run
ning," Johnson said of the men's
team. "The women will be fine, but
the guys have to get their act to
gether. They have to make things
happen, and we will or we'll make
some changes."
Fresno State men also placed
seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th.
The Stanford men's and women's
teams' next meet is the Stanford Invi
tational on Oct. 6.
