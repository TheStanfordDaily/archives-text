### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford field hockey team took a step forward and
then took a fall on its way to a postseason playoff berth.
The Cardinal was 1-1 in Northern Pacific Conference
play last weekend, defeating the University of California
at Berkeley, 5-1, on Friday and losing to San Jose State,
10-3, on Saturday.
The victory and defeat made Stanford 3-1 in NorPac
play and 4-2 overall. The Cardinal is in second place be
hind San Jose State.
Despite the results, both games left Head Coach Onnie
Killefer undecided about her team's play. "The score of
the (Cal) game really surprised me ... I didn't think we
won by that much," she said. "I just don't know what hap
pened to us against San Jose State."
Killefer said she would like to avoid such surprises to
get Stanford into the playoffs. The Cardinal began this
season as one of the top 20 teams in the country, but only
12 teams will receive playoff bids.
There are two ways Stanford can receive a bid. It could
win the NorPac title and get an automatic bid or get an at
large bid if it finishes second.
Over the past two years, the Cardinal has finished third
in the NorPac and out of the playoffs. In both years, San
Jose State won the conference championship and Cal
received an at-large bid.
Killefer explained her team's goal. "We have to beat
[Cal and San Jose State] this (last) weekend."
On Friday, Stanford took a step toward that end by
taking advantage of bad strategy by the visiting Cal team.
Killefer said the Bears put their best defensive player at
midfield, allowing the Cardinal several second shots. "She
(the Cal player) couldn't move back to clear the ball out,
and we got a lot of rebound shots," Killefer said.
Killefer said she thought the game was closer than the
score seemed to indicate. "We did dominate, but not
so ... definitely as to be a 5-1 score," she said.
Fifth-year senior Patsy Huntington took advantage of
the situation and scored three goals. Her play wasn't a
surprise to Killefer, who said, "Patsy is very dangerous
around the net."

Huntington, a two-time All-American, was Stanford's
leading scorer last season with 10 goals and 14 points.
However, with the offense the Cardinal will use this
season, she might not have as many opportunities to score
as she did against Cal.
Killefer said Stanford's offense is more diversified than
last season's, with shooters from nearly all positions. "We
have a strong attack from everywhere. (Against Cal)
everybody shot, even the midfielder," she said. Against
Cal, sophomore Andi Wolpert provided a goal and an as
sist, and sophomore Mary Chung had two assists.
Senior co-captain Jennifer Bleakley and junior
midfielder Karen Chamberlain round out what Killefer
called an "experienced" offense. Both aided in the scoring
against Cal with a goal and an assist, respectively.
At San Jose State, however, Stanford's offense and
defense encountered a new style of play — physical. Kille
fer said the play of the No. 7-ranked Spartans unnerved
the Cardinal and caused a "frantic" style of play, unlike
the team-oriented style that Stanford is used to.
Stanford lost junior sweeper Suzanne Doi for the game
in the first 10 minutes after she suffered a knee injury.
With Doi out, the Spartans dominated the Stanford
defense, Killefer said.
"They're a rough and physical team . . . We just didn't
respond positively," Killefer said. "I'm not sure we can
play their style. We're going to have to use our quickness
and passing next time."
The next time won't happen until Stanford plays the
Spartans late next month. In the meantime, Stanford will
play top-ranked Old Dominion, North Carolina and
William and Mary, teams known for physical play.
Stanford opened the NorPac season with victories over
Chico State Sept. 6, 3-2, and the University of Pacific
Sept. 15, 1-0. Thus, Killefer said, the Cardinal might not
have a chance to overlook any team on its conference
schedule. "The whole conference is very experienced and
better balanced this year," Killefer said.
The Cardinal coupled those victories with two games
against top 10 teams. Stanford lost in double overtime to
No. 3-ranked Northwestern, 2-1, and defeated No. 6-
ranked lowa, 2-1, in nonconference play.
