# Admissions head faces 'Fred' legacy
## features 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
The summer months brought
many personnel changes in the
upper ranks of Stanford's ad
ministration, including a new
provost, a new bursar, a new
public affairs director for the
Hoover Institution and a new
football coach. In New Faces, a
five-part series, The Daily will
profile these faces which will
soon grow familiar. Today:
Dean of Admissions Jean Fet
ter. Tomorrow: Provost James
Rosse.

When Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon announced last winter
that he would leave Stanford for a
job with the College Board, Uni
versity officials faced a problem.
They knew replacing a dean of
admissions wouldn't be easy. They
knew replacing Fred Hargadon
would be impossible.
No one knows this better than
Jean Fetter, Stanford's new dean
of admissions and, if there can be
such a thing, Hargadon's replace
ment.
Fetter, a 46-year-old alumna of
Oxford University and the former
associate dean of graduate studies
and research here, talked about
her first three weeks as Stanford's
dean of admissions in her Old
Union office Friday.
"One of the hardest things for
students to appreciate is that I'm
not Fred Hargadon," Fetter said.
"There are people here who are
going to be disappointed by that,
but all I can do is do things my
way.
"Fred had built up such an
enormous following and tradition.
Who wouldn't have qualms about
following in his footsteps?" Fetter
asked. "I would be inhuman if I
didn't have qualms."
But Fetter said she would be un
der a great deal of pressure even if
Hargadon had been an unpopular

missions and financial aids.
The senate committee, chaired by
Applied Physics Prof. Arthur
Bienenstock, is charged with the duty
of making a number of determina
tions about Stanford's admission and
financial aid policies, including the in
formation to be obtained on applica
tions, the number of freshmen and
transfer students to be admitted each

dean of admissions.
"Say Mr. X had been unpopular.
You would have the pressure to be
different than Mr. X," she explained
Friday. "There's always the pressure
to be either different or the same
when one takes a job."
For now, at least, Fetter is choosing
Hargadon's familiar path.
"Fred had 20 years of experience
in admissions, and I respect what he
learned and developed over those 20
years," Fetter said. "I would be
foolish to rush into any changes. On
the other hand, I think the University
has changed significantly since 1969,
when Fred Hargadon took over."
When Fetter received her appoint
ment in early July, she said she would
spend time "listening and looking."
Now after three weeks at the admis
sions helm, she's beginning to form
opinions on where she'll steer the
ship.
"The example Stanford sets in high
schools is a leadership role that Fred
has established, but I have to put my
internal house in order first," Fetter
said. "First is reviewing the structure
of the office. The staff here is one of
the hardest working, conscientious,
understaffed and overworked staffs
(at Stanford). They perform an in
credible duty; they're responsible for
feeding the lifeblood of the Univer
sity.
"What I'd like to do is to ensure
that the office is working in such a
way to make their jobs efficient and
rewarding."
After Fetter deals with the internal
concerns of the admissions office, she
plans to begin work with the Faculty
Senate committee which oversees ad

year, minimum requirements for ad
mission, and the types and levels of
achievements that should be consid
ered for admission.
Fetter said she does not anticipate
any major changes in Stanford's ad
missions policies, especially the Uni
versity's commitment to admitting
students regardless of their ability to
pay for a Stanford education.
Finally, Fetter said she hopes to
develop a greater degree of
"cooperation and collegiality" be
tween admissions and other depart
ments within the University.
"We're clearly interdependent,"
she said of admissions and the rest of
the University. "The admissions staff
has to know what sort of educational
experience students have. I report to
the provost, so clearly 1 have to un

derstand what the provost wants as
the direction of the University," she
said.
"It's no good bringing all the wrong
people in, or bringing in people with
the wrong impressions. We don't
operate in a vacuum."
Fetter cited as an example of this
new "collegiality" a project currently
planned by Statistics Prof. Bradley

Hargadon. There are people here who

Efron to bring the nation's top math
ematics students to Stanford.
Efron said he is enthusiastic about
this new-found cooperation.
"We have a small amount of
money from the provost to test the
waters," Efron explained. "We have
a list of students who are outstanding
candidates, and we'll call them on the
phone, send them a free book, a nice
letter, a pretty brochure. Compared
to how they recruit football players,
it's pretty small stuff. But we think it
will raise the level of undergraduate
math-related courses."
Fetter said that for high school
seniors interesed in mathematics, it
would be "much more meaningful to
receive a letter from the chairman of
mathematics than the dean of admis
sions."

Efron said that members of the
Mathematics Department have
sometimes blamed — at times un
fairly — admissions for a lack of top
quality students, and Fetter said her
plans for cooperation should lessen
the load on admissions, attract more
students and improve the quality of
future freshman classes.
"I think it would be unrealistic to
see the number of applicants
[continue to go] up eight or 10 per

cent every year. You don't have to be
much of a mathematician to see that's
impossible," Fetter warned.
"But I'm more interested in quality
than quantity. Although I think I
would be in for some criticism if the
numbers went down, I'd look at the
quality — were we still attracting the
excellence and diversity?
"If we get help from the faculty in
attracting the excellence and diver
sity, then we're going to be in very

good shape."
With the future of the University
apparently safe, only one burning
question remains: Will Fetter uphold
Hargadon's tradition and make a
white-coated cameo appearance iri
Gaieties this year?
"I have a policy of not answering
questions until they're asked," Fetter
said. "I have enough questions to an
swer without anticipating the ones
that aren't asked."

opinions on where she'll steer the
ship.
"The example Stanford sets in high
schools is a leadership role that Fred
has established, but I have to put my
internal house in order first," Fetter
said. "First is reviewing the structure
of the office. The staff here is one of
the hardest working, conscientious,
understaffed and overworked staffs
(at Stanford). They perform an in
credible duty; they're responsible for
feeding the lifeblood of the Univer
sity.
"What I'd like to do is to ensure
that the office is working in such a
way to make their jobs efficient and
rewarding."
After Fetter deals with the internal
concerns of the admissions office, she
plans to begin work with the Faculty
Senate committee which oversees ad

year, minimum requirements for ad
mission, and the types and levels of
achievements that should be consid
ered for admission.
Fetter said she does not anticipate
any major changes in Stanford's ad
missions policies, especially the Uni
versity's commitment to admitting
students regardless of their ability to
pay for a Stanford education.
Finally, Fetter said she hopes to
develop a greater degree of
"cooperation and collegiality" be
tween admissions and other depart
ments within the University.
"We're clearly interdependent,"
she said of admissions and the rest of
the University. "The admissions staff
has to know what sort of educational
experience students have. I report to
the provost, so clearly 1 have to un

derstand what the provost wants as
the direction of the University," she
said.
"It's no good bringing all the wrong
people in, or bringing in people with
the wrong impressions. We don't
operate in a vacuum."
Fetter cited as an example of this
new "collegiality" a project currently
planned by Statistics Prof. Bradley

'One of the hardest things for students
to appreciate is that I'm not Fred
Hargadon. There are people here who
are going to be disappointed by that,
but all I can do is do things my way.'

Efron to bring the nation's top math
ematics students to Stanford.
Efron said he is enthusiastic about
this new-found cooperation.
"We have a small amount of
money from the provost to test the
waters," Efron explained. "We have
a list of students who are outstanding
candidates, and we'll call them on the
phone, send them a free book, a nice
letter, a pretty brochure. Compared
to how they recruit football players,
it's pretty small stuff. But we think it
will raise the level of undergraduate
math-related courses."
Fetter said that for high school
seniors interesed in mathematics, it
would be "much more meaningful to
receive a letter from the chairman of
mathematics than the dean of admis
sions."

Efron said that members of the
Mathematics Department have
sometimes blamed — at times un
fairly — admissions for a lack of top
quality students, and Fetter said her
plans for cooperation should lessen
the load on admissions, attract more
students and improve the quality of
future freshman classes.
"I think it would be unrealistic to
see the number of applicants
[continue to go] up eight or 10 per

cent every year. You don't have to be
much of a mathematician to see that's
impossible," Fetter warned.
"But I'm more interested in quality
than quantity. Although I think I
would be in for some criticism if the
numbers went down, I'd look at the
quality — were we still attracting the
excellence and diversity?
"If we get help from the faculty in
attracting the excellence and diver
sity, then we're going to be in very

good shape."
With the future of the University
apparently safe, only one burning
question remains: Will Fetter uphold
Hargadon's tradition and make a
white-coated cameo appearance iri
Gaieties this year?
"I have a policy of not answering
questions until they're asked," Fetter
said. "I have enough questions to an
swer without anticipating the ones
that aren't asked."

Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter says she knows it won't be easy to follow in Fred Hargadon's footsteps, *
The summer months brought
many personnel changes in the
upper ranks of Stanford's ad
ministration, including a new
provost, a new bursar, a new
public affairs director for the
Hoover Institution and a new
football coach. In New Faces, a
five-part series, The Daily will
profile these faces which will
soon grow familiar. Today:
Dean of Admissions Jean Fet
ter. Tomorrow: Provost James
Rosse.

When Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon announced last winter
that he would leave Stanford for a
job with the College Board, Uni
versity officials faced a problem.
They knew replacing a dean of
admissions wouldn't be easy. They
knew replacing Fred Hargadon
would be impossible.
No one knows this better than
Jean Fetter, Stanford's new dean
of admissions and, if there can be
such a thing, Hargadon's replace
ment.
Fetter, a 46-year-old alumna of
Oxford University and the former
associate dean of graduate studies
and research here, talked about
her first three weeks as Stanford's
dean of admissions in her Old
Union office Friday.
"One of the hardest things for
students to appreciate is that I'm
not Fred Hargadon," Fetter said.
"There are people here who are
going to be disappointed by that,
but all I can do is do things my
way.
"Fred had built up such an
enormous following and tradition.
Who wouldn't have qualms about
following in his footsteps?" Fetter
asked. "I would be inhuman if I
didn't have qualms."
But Fetter said she would be un
der a great deal of pressure even if
Hargadon had been an unpopular

missions and financial aids.
The senate committee, chaired by
Applied Physics Prof. Arthur
Bienenstock, is charged with the duty
of making a number of determina
tions about Stanford's admission and
financial aid policies, including the in
formation to be obtained on applica
tions, the number of freshmen and
transfer students to be admitted each

dean of admissions.
"Say Mr. X had been unpopular.
You would have the pressure to be
different than Mr. X," she explained
Friday. "There's always the pressure
to be either different or the same
when one takes a job."
For now, at least, Fetter is choosing
Hargadon's familiar path.
"Fred had 20 years of experience
in admissions, and I respect what he
learned and developed over those 20
years," Fetter said. "I would be
foolish to rush into any changes. On
the other hand, I think the University
has changed significantly since 1969,
when Fred Hargadon took over."
When Fetter received her appoint
ment in early July, she said she would
spend time "listening and looking."
Now after three weeks at the admis
sions helm, she's beginning to form
opinions on where she'll steer the
ship.
"The example Stanford sets in high
