## features 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
The summer months brought
many personnel changes in the
upper ranks of Stanford's ad
ministration, including a new
provost, a new bursar, a new
public affairs director for the
Hoover Institution and a new
football coach. In New Faces, a
five-part series, The Daily will
profile these faces which will
soon grow familiar. Today:
Dean of Admissions Jean Fet
ter. Tomorrow: Provost James
Rosse.

When Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon announced last winter
that he would leave Stanford for a
job with the College Board, Uni
versity officials faced a problem.
They knew replacing a dean of
admissions wouldn't be easy. They
knew replacing Fred Hargadon
would be impossible.
No one knows this better than
Jean Fetter, Stanford's new dean
of admissions and, if there can be
such a thing, Hargadon's replace
ment.
Fetter, a 46-year-old alumna of
Oxford University and the former
associate dean of graduate studies
and research here, talked about
her first three weeks as Stanford's
dean of admissions in her Old
Union office Friday.
"One of the hardest things for
students to appreciate is that I'm
not Fred Hargadon," Fetter said.
"There are people here who are
going to be disappointed by that,
but all I can do is do things my
way.
"Fred had built up such an
enormous following and tradition.
Who wouldn't have qualms about
following in his footsteps?" Fetter
asked. "I would be inhuman if I
didn't have qualms."
But Fetter said she would be un
der a great deal of pressure even if
Hargadon had been an unpopular
