# Tresidder mess
## LOTS replaces bowling alley 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Staff writer 
The bowling alley is gone, the bank
seems to have been cut in half, and no
one knows exactly where to go to
make airline reservations.
And if the employees at LOTS, one
of the campus computer networks, do
not meet their planned deadline of
Sept. 26, students will not have new
computers at their disposal.
Tresidder Memorial Union could
be considered a mess.
Just two-and-a-half weeks ago,
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for
management and director of Univer
sity budgets, sent a letter to Tresidder
Memorial Union Director Ellie Op
penheim citing an addition of more
computing facilities for students as
"one of the most acute needs I've
seen in a number of years at Stan
ford."
Since plans for removing the
bowling alley — and replacing it with
a larger version of the Store — have
been in the works since early last fall,
the recreation center seemed to ad
ministrators the perfect place to in
stall "LOTS Two," as it will be called.
Oppenheim said LOTS Two will be
only temporary; work on the ex
panded Store and possibly a phar
macy should begin in 18 months. The
Tresidder director added that a new
building for the 100 LOTS, IBM and
Dec Rainbow computers will be con
structed somewhere on campus, but
that a location has not yet been cho
sen.
Peter King, student computer co

ordinator, said, "We hope to have it
(LOTS) 'up' by the time classes
start."
Ralph Gorin, director of the com
puter facility, was not available for
comment because he was too busy
trying to meet the deadline of Sept.
26, according to King.
Wells Fargo frenzy
At 10 a.m., Friday, the lines at
Wells Fargo's electronic teller were
15 people deep; inside Tresidder ap
proximately 30 people waited to open
new accounts. Wells Fargo expected
to open at least 250 accounts on
Friday alone, employee James Young
said.
Freshmen waiting to open new ac
counts were not pleased with the
lines, but they also were not
surprised. Several commented that
they had been introduced to long
waits when obtaining meal cards ear
lier that day.
Adam Gwosdof, a freshman at
Madera, was bored. "There's really
nothing to do," he said, adding
jokingly that he should have brought
a television along. "I'm practicing for
registration."
Two Branner residents — Eric
Reifsnider and John Montgomery —
waited more than 30 minutes before
leaving to drive to an off-campus
branch. They considered the long line
as nothing unusual: They had waited
an hour-and-a-half for their meal
cards.
