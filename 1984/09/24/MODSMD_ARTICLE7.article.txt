Arab nations support Reagan
TUNIS, TUNISIA — Although generally disillusioned with U.S.
policy in the Middle East, most Arab governments are openly supportive
of President Reagan's reelection bid and are hoping for a new U.S.
peace initiative after the November vote.
Earlier this month, when the United States vetoed a resolution before
the U.N. Security Council that would have condemned Israel's occupa
tion of southern Lebanon, Washington came under harsh attack in
government-controlled news media throughout the Arab world. But
while the press was saying one thing, Arab leaders were saying quite an
other.
"We still have hopes that after the election the American administra
tion will give further attention to its initial initiative (the Reagan peace
plan of 1982) and will engage in a new process," Tunisia's Foreign Mini
ster Beji Caid Essebi said in an interview.
"Remember, the Arabs did not reject the Reagan plan. The fact is
that in the beginning of the process, we saluted President Reagan's
courage in proposing such a plan and we had great hopes," Essebi
added.
Arab governments believe that only the United States can exert signif
icant influence on Israel, though they believe too that this influence ap
pears to have diminished in recent years. Most Arab leaders say that Re
publican administrations traditionally have been more even handed in
Arab-Israeli affairs than Democratic administrations.
Ailing Chernenko turns 73 today
MOSCOW — Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko will observe
his 73rd today with questions being raised about the state of
his health and the extent of his authority.
Although he has been in office for more than seven months, there are
many signs that Chernenko has failed to establish himself as a strong
leader.
The official newspapers sometimes fail to quote him at all on impor
tant policy matters — a departure from the usual precedent of invoking
the name of the party and government leader in every major story.
In addition, Chernenko virtually dropped out of sight for seven weeks
this summer when he was reportedly on vacation. His immediate
predecessors, in contrast, issued a stream of statements and interviews
during their holidays spent away from Moscow.
The biggest question about Chernenko, however, is his physical condi
tion. In a series of recent televised appearances he seemed to be fighting
for breath. Chernenko suffers from a lung disease, apparently em
physema, that makes it hrad for him to speak at length without seeming
to battle for air.
In one recent television news segment, he also leaned on a chair for
support. In his latest appearance, reading a message to the people of
Finland, Chernenko was pictured seated behind a desk. The film ap
parently was made in advance, with the cameras panning away when the
leader was having breathing difficulty.
Salvadoran troops denied training
TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS — In a fit of nationalistic temper,
Honduras is withholding permission for troops from El Salvador to train
at a U.S.-operated base in this tropical nation.
The government, backed by the all-powerful military, is demanding
some gesture from El Salvador toward settling long-festering border
problems between the two countries, an armed forces spokesman, Col.
Elvir Sierra, said. "We have displayed good will toward the Sal
vadorans," Sierra said. "They should display some towards us."
A battalion of Salvadoran soldiers was expected to arrive this
weekend for training in Honduras but U.S. officials fear there is a 50-50
chance that the Hondurans will block their arrival.
Normally, the Hondurans would have issubd the invitation by now, as
they have regularly done since the center opened in June last year. But
in recent months, Honduras has turned away from the Reagan adminis
tration's anti-communist campaign in Central America toward more
narrow interests.
At stake in the current conflict is the future of the Regional Military
Training Center on Honduras' north coast, a facility soon to be moved to
a new location because of a dispute over ownership of the site.
The U.S. Congress recently approved $18.5 million to move and im
prove the center and another $18 million for further construction of
permament facilities is pending.
Despite its name, the main function of the center is to train, under
U.S. direction, the Salvadoran army that is locked in a four-year-old bat
tle with leftist guerrillas. With the camp in Honduras, the Reagan ad
ministration avoids the politically sensitive question of whether to put
more U.S. military trainers in embattled El Salvador.
The Honduran military, meanwhile, is weighing two conflicting factors
— financial and emotional.
The country receives millions of dollars in U.S. military and economic
aid for cooperating in the Reagan administration's Central American
united front against Nicaragua. Honduran troops also train at the center,
for example.
But Honduras has been an unenthusiastic host to soldiers from rival El
Salvador, against which it fought a brief war in 1969.
Ceremony honors WWI dead
VERDUN, FRANCE — A French military band played the West
German national anthem and a German military band played its French
counterpart Saturday as President Francois Mitterrand of France and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany stood on the battlefield of
Verdun and honored the soldiers killed by the World War I armies of
their two nations.
Few battles in history caused more carnage than the battle of Verdun,
which raged for 10 months in 1916. Estimates range from a total of
600,000 to a total of 1.25 million killed, wounded and missing on both
sides. The Battle of Verdun lasted twice as long as the battle of
Stalingrad in World War II and killed more people. Nine French villages
were razed, their destruction so great that they were never rebuilt, left
with only monuments that mark their sites as "destroyed village — died
for France."
Skeletons and bones continue to be found in makeshift graves around
the battlefield. In the last 18 months, the remains of 18 Germans and 10
French soldiers have been uncovered, more than half of them without
any clue to their names.
Despite their great loss of life, the French managed to turn back the
Germans at Verdun, ending any chance that the Germans could win the
war from then on. As a result, the battle has long been regarded by many
French as a glory for France even though many historians regard it as
one of history's most wasteful slaughters.
Compromise reached on IMF pool
WASHINGTON — The United States and the other wealthy indus
trial countries that dominate the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Saturday rejected the request of poorer countries to expand interna
tional liquidity through an increase in IMF special drawing rights, but
they agreed to a compromise formula on access to the IMFs pool of loan
money during the next year.
In addition, finance ministers meeting in the IMFs policy-making
body, the Interim Committee, heard Treasury secretary Donald Regan
invite debtor countries represented at the IMFs annual meeting this
week to join the industrial countries in a "broaden(ed). .. dialogue" un
der IMF auspices to discuss strategies for resuming world economic
growth as the world debt crisis gradually is resolved.
Latin American debtor countries have been pushing to politicize the
debt question by opening a debtor-creditor dialogue among heads of
state. Accordingly, Regan's proposal, generally endorsed by the indus
trial countries, offers the debtors a relatively cost-free concession with
out yielding on the Reagan administration's policy, shared by other in
dustrial countries and the IMFs professional staff, that the debt itself is
an economic matter to be solved among the debtors, the creditor banks
and the Fund.
Today's weather
Sunny and clear with a high in the mid 70s. Cooler tonight, with tem
peratures dipping into the mid 50s.

Salvadoran troops denied training
TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS — In a fit of nationalistic temper,
Honduras is withholding permission for troops from El Salvador to train
at a U.S.-operated base in this tropical nation.
The government, backed by the all-powerful military, is demanding
some gesture from El Salvador toward settling long-festering border
problems between the two countries, an armed forces spokesman, Col.
Elvir Sierra, said. "We have displayed good will toward the Sal
vadorans," Sierra said. "They should display some towards us."
A battalion of Salvadoran soldiers was expected to arrive this
weekend for training in Honduras but U.S. officials fear there is a 50-50
chance that the Hondurans will block their arrival.
Normally, the Hondurans would have issubd the invitation by now, as
they have regularly done since the center opened in June last year. But
in recent months, Honduras has turned away from the Reagan adminis
tration's anti-communist campaign in Central America toward more
narrow interests.
At stake in the current conflict is the future of the Regional Military
Training Center on Honduras' north coast, a facility soon to be moved to
a new location because of a dispute over ownership of the site.
The U.S. Congress recently approved $18.5 million to move and im
prove the center and another $18 million for further construction of
permament facilities is pending.
Despite its name, the main function of the center is to train, under
U.S. direction, the Salvadoran army that is locked in a four-year-old bat
tle with leftist guerrillas. With the camp in Honduras, the Reagan ad
ministration avoids the politically sensitive question of whether to put
more U.S. military trainers in embattled El Salvador.
The Honduran military, meanwhile, is weighing two conflicting factors
— financial and emotional.
The country receives millions of dollars in U.S. military and economic
aid for cooperating in the Reagan administration's Central American
united front against Nicaragua. Honduran troops also train at the center,
for example.
But Honduras has been an unenthusiastic host to soldiers from rival El
Salvador, against which it fought a brief war in 1969.
Ceremony honors WWI dead
VERDUN, FRANCE — A French military band played the West
German national anthem and a German military band played its French
counterpart Saturday as President Francois Mitterrand of France and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany stood on the battlefield of
Verdun and honored the soldiers killed by the World War I armies of
their two nations.
Few battles in history caused more carnage than the battle of Verdun,
which raged for 10 months in 1916. Estimates range from a total of
600,000 to a total of 1.25 million killed, wounded and missing on both
sides. The Battle of Verdun lasted twice as long as the battle of
Stalingrad in World War II and killed more people. Nine French villages
were razed, their destruction so great that they were never rebuilt, left
with only monuments that mark their sites as "destroyed village — died
for France."
Skeletons and bones continue to be found in makeshift graves around
the battlefield. In the last 18 months, the remains of 18 Germans and 10
French soldiers have been uncovered, more than half of them without
any clue to their names.
Despite their great loss of life, the French managed to turn back the
Germans at Verdun, ending any chance that the Germans could win the
war from then on. As a result, the battle has long been regarded by many
French as a glory for France even though many historians regard it as
one of history's most wasteful slaughters.
Compromise reached on IMF pool
WASHINGTON — The United States and the other wealthy indus
trial countries that dominate the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Saturday rejected the request of poorer countries to expand interna
tional liquidity through an increase in IMF special drawing rights, but
they agreed to a compromise formula on access to the IMFs pool of loan
money during the next year.
In addition, finance ministers meeting in the IMFs policy-making
body, the Interim Committee, heard Treasury secretary Donald Regan
invite debtor countries represented at the IMFs annual meeting this
week to join the industrial countries in a "broaden(ed). .. dialogue" un
der IMF auspices to discuss strategies for resuming world economic
growth as the world debt crisis gradually is resolved.
Latin American debtor countries have been pushing to politicize the
debt question by opening a debtor-creditor dialogue among heads of
state. Accordingly, Regan's proposal, generally endorsed by the indus
trial countries, offers the debtors a relatively cost-free concession with
out yielding on the Reagan administration's policy, shared by other in
dustrial countries and the IMFs professional staff, that the debt itself is
an economic matter to be solved among the debtors, the creditor banks
and the Fund.

Arab nations support Reagan
TUNIS, TUNISIA — Although generally disillusioned with U.S.
policy in the Middle East, most Arab governments are openly supportive
of President Reagan's reelection bid and are hoping for a new U.S.
peace initiative after the November vote.
Earlier this month, when the United States vetoed a resolution before
the U.N. Security Council that would have condemned Israel's occupa
tion of southern Lebanon, Washington came under harsh attack in
government-controlled news media throughout the Arab world. But
while the press was saying one thing, Arab leaders were saying quite an
other.
"We still have hopes that after the election the American administra
tion will give further attention to its initial initiative (the Reagan peace
plan of 1982) and will engage in a new process," Tunisia's Foreign Mini
ster Beji Caid Essebi said in an interview.
"Remember, the Arabs did not reject the Reagan plan. The fact is
that in the beginning of the process, we saluted President Reagan's
courage in proposing such a plan and we had great hopes," Essebi
added.
Arab governments believe that only the United States can exert signif
icant influence on Israel, though they believe too that this influence ap
pears to have diminished in recent years. Most Arab leaders say that Re
publican administrations traditionally have been more even handed in
Arab-Israeli affairs than Democratic administrations.
Ailing Chernenko turns 73 today
MOSCOW — Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko will observe
his 73rd today with questions being raised about the state of
his health and the extent of his authority.
Although he has been in office for more than seven months, there are
many signs that Chernenko has failed to establish himself as a strong
leader.
The official newspapers sometimes fail to quote him at all on impor
tant policy matters — a departure from the usual precedent of invoking
the name of the party and government leader in every major story.
In addition, Chernenko virtually dropped out of sight for seven weeks
this summer when he was reportedly on vacation. His immediate
predecessors, in contrast, issued a stream of statements and interviews
during their holidays spent away from Moscow.
The biggest question about Chernenko, however, is his physical condi
tion. In a series of recent televised appearances he seemed to be fighting
for breath. Chernenko suffers from a lung disease, apparently em
physema, that makes it hrad for him to speak at length without seeming
to battle for air.
In one recent television news segment, he also leaned on a chair for
support. In his latest appearance, reading a message to the people of
Finland, Chernenko was pictured seated behind a desk. The film ap
parently was made in advance, with the cameras panning away when the
