# Pentagon decides on Marine pullout
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The timing of the
decision to bring home a detachment
of about 80 combat Marines guarding
the U.S. embassy in Beirut was
turned over to the Pentagon and the
State Department last February by
President Reagan, a White House of
ficial said Saturday.
The official, speaking on the condi
tion that he not be identified by
name, said Reagan had decided that
the guard detachment would remain
on duty in Beirut for an unspecified
period after the bulk of the Marines
who had formed part of the old multi
national peacekeeping force in
Lebanon was withdrawn in February.
At the same time, the President left
up to other officials the decision

about when that smaller unit would
be pulled out.
The SO combat Marines guarded
the perimeter of the diplomatic mis
sion while the embassy occupied its
former offices in the British Embassy
on a sea-front avenue in West Beirut.
They were withdrawn from Lebanon
in midsummer, after the Americans
moved their operations into a con
verted West Beirut school and into
the annex in the Christian eastern
sector that was the target of a suicide
car bomber last Thursday.
After the embassy move, security
chores outside of the annex building
were assigned to a private security
force hired from among the U.S.-
trained ranks of Christian Phalangist

militiamen. It was these security
people, aided by British guards, who
fired on the terrorist or terrorists who
drove an explosives-laden van up the
street in front of the embassy and
detonated the cargo near the annex's
entrance. The Britons were the
bodyguards for the British ambassa
dor, who was visiting the U.S. mission
at the time of the attack.
The White House official said the
State Department and the Pentagon
decided that the appropriate moment
to withdraw the combat Marine guard
detachment would be at the time the
embassy operations were being trans
ferred away from the British Embassy
offices, although beefed up security
provisions at the new premises had

not been completed. The withdrawal
did not affect a detachment of 14
non-combat Marines who serve — as
Marines do' in nearly all U.S.
diplomatic missions overseas — as se
curity guards inside the embassy's
buildings.
"They (the State Department and
the Pentagon) reached the consensus
decision that at the time the embassy
was being moved, they should replace
the Marines with private guards," the
official said. He said that Reagan had
given the two departments authority
to make that shift, whenever they saw
fit, "at the time of the original
redeployment of the Marines from
Beirut."
