# Soviet leadership looks fragmented
## 
### 
MOSCOW — The top leader, who never demon
strated much capacity for leadership, is now ap
parently too ill to be effective. The chief of staff of
the armed services has just been fired and
humiliated in an unexplained but remarkable turn
of events. For the first time in the history of the So
viet Union, a deputy premier — a figure of no great
import — has been given a Red Square funeral and
buried in the Kremlin wall; but, contrary to all
precedent, just three of the senior leaders took part
in the funeral. Some in Moscow speak darkly of a
"power play" by Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko, symbolized by his decision to meet with
President Reagan. Senior officials confide that this
is "a difficult time" here.
Strange signals like these suggest that something
is seriously amiss inside the Kremlin. The calm,

predictable orderliness of normal times here has
been displaced by obvious disarray. Power in the
Kremlin seems fragmented. Presumably, another
struggle for power — perhaps the final contest be
tween the ruling generation and its successors — is
under way.
Many Kremlinologists, including those at the
CIA in Washington, have concluded that the next
leader is bound to be Mikhail Gorbachov, 53. An
increasingly prominent figure who was close to the
last Soviet leader, the late Yuri Andropov, Gorbac
hov appears to be bright, energetic and eager to
learn, though most of his experience is in the field
of agriculture.
But Gorbachov's selection as the next leader
hardly looks inevitable from here. Officials who
have high hopes that Gorbachov will succeed

Konstantin Chernenko — and there seem to be
many of them — acknowledge great uncertainty
about his prospects. When asked if Gorbachov
would get the job, one just shrugged. Another said
nothing, but knocked on wood. A third — a senior
Communist Party official — said in a dejected tone
of voice that Gorbachov is probably still "too
young" to be chosen general secretary of the Com
munist Party.
Gorbachov offers something that many here rec
ognize is long overdue; real energy at the top,
coupled with an appetite for change. By the admis
sion of senior Soviet officials, this country has had a
strong and effective leader for only a few months
since 1975 — the few months that Andropov was
healthy and active, before kidney disease disabled
him.
