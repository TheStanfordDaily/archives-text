# Career center extends office
## Students get more room 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Phase one ot a two-phase expansion and renovation
project is underway at the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC), but student services will not be
significantly affected, according to Ruth Schneider, the
center s associate director and director of the expansion
project.
TTie center had consisted of three buildings under
one roof, but one structure, the old Stanford shoe
repair shop, has been demolished to accommodate the
addition of 1,500 square feet to the center.
The addition will cost about $339,000 and will house
eight counseling offices and an expanded career
resource library.
The extra space was needed to accommodate the
center's 40 work/study employees and to handle stu
dent traffic during peak periods.
"This place looks like Grand Central Station during
peak times," said Schneider. "Students coming to use
the center have been sitting on the floor and stepping
over each other just to use our library."
An average of more than 250 students use the center
daily during the academic year and up to 500 students a
day come in at peak times.
Construction will be completed by Oct. 29 and the
center will begin moving in at that time, according to
Schneider.
On-campus interviewing for fall quarter will be the
service most affected by the construction. Interviewing
will take place in a trailer behind the old music build
ing, says Schneider, but, she adds, "we will be able to
take care of everybody."
Phase two of the project calls for a renovation of the
two existing buildings.
This portion of the project is still tentative pending
university approval and a successful fund raising effort.
The center is trying to raise about $150,000 from
employers that use the center's interviewing facilities to
fund the second part of the project.
Students will have an opportunity to meet with rep
resentatives from 95 industrial, retail, government and
non-profit organizations at CPPCs Career Faire, slated
for Friday, Oct. 5, in White Plaza.
Local high technology firms will be featured at the
event, as well as representatives from the Peace Corps,
accounting firms, insurance companies, investment
banks and government agencies. There will also be a
number of "special interest" tables set up to give stu
dents information about careers in advertising, educa
tion. health, the media and government.
