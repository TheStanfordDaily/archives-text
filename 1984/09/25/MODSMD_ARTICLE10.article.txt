"The President calls himself a good Christian, but
I don't believe it for one minute, because [his]
policies are so unfair."
-Geraldine Ferraro
"I believe that faith and religion play a critical role
in the political life of our nation and always have."
-Ronald Reagan
"I have never before had to defend my faith in a
political campaign."
-Walter Mondale
The relationship between church and state has
always been a controversial issue for Americans.
In 1791, Thomas Jefferson's idea of the "wall
of separation" between church and state became
the First Amendment to the Constitution.
Though the concept has been subject to
numerous interpretations, it has come to be re
garded as representing a distinction between
politics and religion.
This distinction is not just a good idea. Because
of the plethora of religions and sects found in this
country, the First Amendment separation is
downright crucial.
Since Jefferson's time, religion and politics have
continued to change, and their relationship has
been challenged and questioned many times. The
1884 presidential election win by Grover
Cleveland, a Democrat but not a Catholic, was
greatly aided by the residual effects of a Protes

tant minister's ugly anti-Catholic slur directed at
Democrats.
In 1960, religious prejudice was still prevalent.
John Kennedy had to persuade voters that he was
not a pawn of the Vatican to have a chance of
winning. And now in 1984 we continue to see the
effect religion has on American politics.
Kennedy's ideas on religion in America, laid
out during his hid for the presidency, are as ap
propriate in 1984 as they were in 1960. "I believe
in an America where the separation of church
and state is absolute — where no Catholic prelate
would tell the president (should he be Catholic)
how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell
his parishioners for whom to vote . . . where
every man has the same right to attend or not to
attend the church of his choice — where there is
no Catholic vote, no anti-Catholic vote, no bloc
voting of any kind."
More than 20 years have passed since Kennedy
expressed his, we believe quite reasonable,
ideals. Yet we still have campaigns in which can
didates argue over who is the better Christian.
Whether a candidate is a Protestant, a Catho
lic, a Moslem, a Buddhist, a Jew or a Hindu
should have no bearing on his or her ability to
lead. We urge the candidates and the American
people to rise above religious infighting to con
centrate on the truly important issues facing this
country.
