## Glorious game of summer 
### 
A $200 billion deficit is threatening
the recovery of the American eco
nomy.
Acid rain is destroying the beauti
ful forests and lakes of New England.
Tuition rates are rising like the
space shuttle.
Let's forget about all that for now.
Let's talk baseball.
1 won't deny the importance of
these issues, but they get a lot of ink

VIEWPOINT

and very few solutions. A nice discus
sion of America's favorite outdoor
game can release the pleasant
memories of our collective past.
Jacobson, with a big lead off first
. . . here's the pitch, Jacobson is
breaking for second . . . the throw . . .
he's safe!
A few days ago, I was out riding on
Alpine Road. There is a Little
League field there, with the dimen
sions shrunken to match the players. I
stopped to watch the pitcher toss his
heat before a captive audience of par
ents und grandparents, sitting on
noisy aluminum stands. There was a
slow grounder down the middle. The
second baseman picked it up,
pivoted, and almost nailed the first
base coach.
The mistake ended up as a two
base error, but no one was booing. It
would be forgotten by the time the
next batter stepped up to the plate.
The second baseman returned to
glory in the next play, a diving stab to
end the inning.
Little League ball is the first, and
often the only, chance for glory for
many youngsters. In a land where
baseball is king, it is bad form for par
ents to miss a child's Little League
game. For some kids, a Little League
game is the only attention they get
from their parents outside of a
mumbled threat to turn down the
television.
The preparations begin in the late
winter, as the neighborhood kids or
ganize batting and fielding contests
like "Three Flies Up" and "500."
Then, with the advent of spring,
comes the formation of the league
and the selection of teams. Managers
are shanghaied from the ranks of the
working qlass, as fathers are con

vinced to sacrifice an afternoon each
week in order to preserve the glory of
the game for the next generation.
After a few disastrous practices,
the season begins. In my old
hometown, there was a parade on
Opening Day, as the teams from the
different age divisions sat in the backs
of pickups, relishing the enthusiastic
waves of friends and family. It is per
haps the only time in their lives they
would receive a greeting fit for a pope
or a president.
At last the first pitch is thrown and
the game begins. Contrary to popular
belief, Little League parents rarely
berate their home-grown ballplayers
during the game. Usually there is just
an embarrassed silence as their boy
swings wildly at a ball in the dirt.

Little League comes at a time when
kids first acquire heroes. In the lasf
century, a Tom Sawyer would seek to
emulate a favorite general in a forgot
ten war during some lunchtime battle.

Then, encouragingly, comes the cry,
"You'll get it next time, Johnny!"
Little League comes at a time when
kids first acquire heroes. In the last
century, a Tom Sawyer would seek to
emulate a favorite general in a forgot
ten war during some lunchtime battle.
Today, he would seek to impress his
Becky Thatcher with a brilliant blow
from the batter's box.
Here's the 0-1 pitch . . . Jacobson
cracks a long fly ball to right . it's
outta here! A three-run home run!
Long after Little League, the
yearning for the game remains. Sub
consciously, former Little Leaguers
seek to recapture the glory of the dia
mond they lost in their child
hood, or they simply never had. Im
agine the ego boost of returning to

the office on Monday morning and
boasting, "Yeah, I went four-for-five
yesterday, with three RBls!" The
final score is relevant only if you are
on the winning side.
Others prefer a more sedentary
way of enjoying the Grand Ol' Game.
Many of us take comfort in the prat
falls of hopelessly inept teams. Per
sonally, I enjoy watching profes
sionals making the same mistakes I
did in Little League.
One family friend is a die-hard
Cubs fan. There is no doubt that his
heart wouldn't stand the strain if the
hapless Cubs win the pennant, but at
least he would pass on with that
happy fact engraved on his soul.
My heart and soul are with the San
Diego Padres. I used to eagerly wait

for the announcement over the
loudspeaker: "Now, leading off for
your Padres, No. 11, Enzo Hernan
dez!" A lusty cheer would then erupt
out of the throats of the crowd for
one of the most inept shortstops ever
to start for a major league team.
Jacobson, with the strike two pitch
... a called strike three! The Padres
win the World Series!
For those of you who don't follow
the standings, the Padres are on top
of the Western Division. If they
should forget to choke, I may have to
find another team of Don Quixotes to
root for.
Maybe it's time to get some tickets
to Candlestick Park. Or maybe I'll
just go for another ride up Alpine
Road sometime.

Acid rain is destroying the beauti

Tuition rates are rising like the
space shuttle.
Let's forget about all that for now.
Let's talk baseball.

these issues, but they get a lot of ink

and very few solutions. A nice discus
sion of America's favorite outdoor
game can release the pleasant
memories of our collective past.
Jacobson, with a big lead off first
. . . here's the pitch, Jacobson is
breaking for second . . . the throw . . .
he's safe!
A few days ago, I was out riding on
Alpine Road. There is a Little
League field there, with the dimen
sions shrunken to match the players. I
stopped to watch the pitcher toss his
heat before a captive audience of par
ents und grandparents, sitting on
noisy aluminum stands. There was a
slow grounder down the middle. The
second baseman picked it up,
pivoted, and almost nailed the first
base coach.
The mistake ended up as a two
base error, but no one was booing. It
would be forgotten by the time the
next batter stepped up to the plate.
The second baseman returned to
glory in the next play, a diving stab to
end the inning.
Little League ball is the first, and
often the only, chance for glory for
many youngsters. In a land where
baseball is king, it is bad form for par
ents to miss a child's Little League
game. For some kids, a Little League
game is the only attention they get
from their parents outside of a
mumbled threat to turn down the
television.
The preparations begin in the late
winter, as the neighborhood kids or
ganize batting and fielding contests
like "Three Flies Up" and "500."
Then, with the advent of spring,
comes the formation of the league
and the selection of teams. Managers
are shanghaied from the ranks of the
working qlass, as fathers are con

vinced to sacrifice an afternoon each
week in order to preserve the glory of
the game for the next generation.
After a few disastrous practices,
the season begins. In my old
hometown, there was a parade on
Opening Day, as the teams from the
different age divisions sat in the backs
of pickups, relishing the enthusiastic
waves of friends and family. It is per
haps the only time in their lives they
would receive a greeting fit for a pope
or a president.
At last the first pitch is thrown and
the game begins. Contrary to popular
belief, Little League parents rarely
berate their home-grown ballplayers
during the game. Usually there is just
an embarrassed silence as their boy
swings wildly at a ball in the dirt.

Little League comes at a time when
kids first acquire heroes. In the lasf
century, a Tom Sawyer would seek to
emulate a favorite general in a forgot
ten war during some lunchtime battle.

Then, encouragingly, comes the cry,
"You'll get it next time, Johnny!"
Little League comes at a time when

Today, he would seek to impress his
Becky Thatcher with a brilliant blow
from the batter's box.
Here's the 0-1 pitch . . . Jacobson
cracks a long fly ball to right . it's
outta here! A three-run home run!
Long after Little League, the
yearning for the game remains. Sub
consciously, former Little Leaguers
seek to recapture the glory of the dia
mond they lost in their child
hood, or they simply never had. Im
agine the ego boost of returning to

the office on Monday morning and
boasting, "Yeah, I went four-for-five
yesterday, with three RBls!" The
final score is relevant only if you are
on the winning side.
Others prefer a more sedentary
way of enjoying the Grand Ol' Game.
Many of us take comfort in the prat
falls of hopelessly inept teams. Per
sonally, I enjoy watching profes
sionals making the same mistakes I
did in Little League.
One family friend is a die-hard
Cubs fan. There is no doubt that his
heart wouldn't stand the strain if the
hapless Cubs win the pennant, but at
least he would pass on with that
happy fact engraved on his soul.
My heart and soul are with the San
Diego Padres. I used to eagerly wait

for the announcement over the
loudspeaker: "Now, leading off for
your Padres, No. 11, Enzo Hernan
dez!" A lusty cheer would then erupt
out of the throats of the crowd for
one of the most inept shortstops ever
to start for a major league team.
Jacobson, with the strike two pitch
... a called strike three! The Padres
win the World Series!
For those of you who don't follow
the standings, the Padres are on top
of the Western Division. If they
should forget to choke, I may have to
find another team of Don Quixotes to
root for.
Maybe it's time to get some tickets
to Candlestick Park. Or maybe I'll
just go for another ride up Alpine
Road sometime.
