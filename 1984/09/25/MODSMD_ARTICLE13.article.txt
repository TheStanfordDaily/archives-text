## University policy reeks of robber baron past 
### 
Labor historians have always
known of the close connection be
tween Leland Stanford and union
busting. Not being kin to the man
but being an alumnus of the univer
sity that bears his name, I have al
ways hoped that this university
would distance itself from some of
the seedier aspects of the Old Rob
ber Baron. Alas, when it comes to
unionizing on campus, it is as if the
old boy were still alive and running
the show down on his farm. The
Stanford administration's chosen
relationship to its union, United

Stanford Workers (USW), has been
a classic case of foot-dragging non
cooperation, mistrust and legal nit
picking with one purpose in mind —
union busting.
Now in the good old days of
Leland Stanford, this behavior would
have been both within the spirit and
the letter of the law. Unions were
mob rule which threatened the
divine right of property. If we raised
Senator Stanford from the dead, it
would not take him two minutes to
understand what the administration

is up to and why they are doing it.
However, times have, or are
supposed to have, changed.
Since the 1930s and the passage of
the Wagner Act, it has been public
policy not only to permit unions but
to promote unionization and the
establishment of collective bargain
ing. Pious support for free unions for
Polish workers is based on what we
are supposed to already have! I urge
President Kennedy and the Stanford
administration to rethink their posi
tion. Forget procedural delays. For
get the temptation to use this tech-

nicality or that as leverage to see if
you can dislodge the union. Recog
nize the American Arbitration Asso
ciation's election that validated the
longstanding mandate of USW. For
get union busting and engage in the
established and ongoing collective
bargaining relationship which is your
true ethical and legal duty.
