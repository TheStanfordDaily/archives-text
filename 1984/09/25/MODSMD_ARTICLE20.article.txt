## Dave Dutcher Cardinal talent recognized 
### 
At the media luncheon that
Stanford football Coach Jack El
way headlined yesterday, Cardinal
wide receiver Jeff James was on
hand to answer questions from a
different perspective than his
coach's.
James was present because the
local media representatives have
met the John Paye and Emile
Harry types at least once before
and like to see a different Car
dinal once in a while. Not only
that, but James played a key role
in Stanford's 28-27 victory over
San Jose State Saturday.
James, a 6-foot sophomore, was
the top Cardinal receiver Satur
day. He caught five passes for 88
yards, including one for 30 yards.
For those returning to campus
and blowing off unpacking to
catch rays and a football game,
James' presence probably re
quired a glance at a roster to find
out who No. 3 was. Once it was
discovered he's not a freshman,
fans may have wondered where he
was last season.
James redshirted in 1983, and
with good reason. Among the
receivers the Cardinal boasted
then were Harry, Mike Tolliver,
Steve Brown, Don Lonsinger and
Eric Mullins.
Harry, as is the case again this
year, was regarded so highly last
season that he attracted more than
his share of defensive attention.
Tolliver was able to put together a
season so successful that, at one
point, he was the nation's leading
receiver. Tolliver was chosen by
the Dallas Cowboys in the Na
tional Football League's draft last
spring.
James realized the caliber of
receivers he would have to beat in
order to play. So, intelligently, he
redshirted.
One of the receivers James
watched from the sidelines was
Mullins, who was the Cardinal's
fifth-leading receiver last season.
He had a modest 16 catches and
two touchdowns.
But Mullins might be smiling
and even letting go an occasional
I-told-you-so cackle. Despite his
very average statistics, compiled

while on a 1-10 team, Mullins was
drafted by the Houston Oilers.
Not just drafted, though. He made
it on the team, one which had
made a commitment to an im
proved passing game when it
signed former Canadian Football
League superstar quarterback
Warren Moon for megabucks.
After four NFL games, Mullins
has three receptions for 50 yards
and one touchdown. Not earth
shaking by any means, but Mullins
has made it to football's center
stage.
The part of this that intrigues
me is that Mullins, practically un
known in football circles here, is in
a seemingly secure position with
an NFL team and has respectable
statistics considering his rookie
status and the talent the Oilers
have.
The Mullins situation lends
credibility to one of the many
theories I heard last season about
why Stanford had been only
average during the John Elway
years and less than that last
season.
It was suggested that Stanford
had the talent to compete against
nonconference heavyweights like
Oklahoma, Ohio State and Illinois
and against Pacific 10 Conference
teams. However, the players were
in the wrong positions. Players
were evaluated incorrectly.
It was said that NFL scouts had
come to Cardinal games and left
shaking their heads, wondering
why Stanford didn't win with its
talent.
The first example that came to
my mind when I heard this was
senior linebacker Garin Veris,
who has played defensive line,
linebacker, and, once last season,
tight end.
So, while James might have
yearned to play last season, he
probably doesn't regret his deci
sion to redshirt. Now he's got four
seasons of eligibility, which will
probably be spent under the El
way coaching staff.
And it's my guess that if James
has the ability and desire to fur
ther his football career, he won't
get lost in the shuffle as Mullins
was.
