# Golfers take second, but aren't satisfied
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford men's golf team was
happy, but not completely satisfied,
with its second-place finish in the
American Classic at Lake Geneva,
Wis., this weekend.
"We feel that second is very good.
In the past that would have been
great. But this year we're trying to set
our sights higher. We feel like we can
start to win some of these tourna
ments." Head Coach lim Schaat
said.
But the Cardinal will have to wait
at least another week for that oppor
tunity. The team sealed its fate early
in the Classic by shooting a poor first
round and starting the tournament in
eighth place, according to Schaaf.
After two rounds, Stanford had
moved back into contention and was
trailing eventual champion UCLA by
only 15 strokes. In the final round
yesterday, the Cardinal challenged
but couldn't make up the difference,
losing 896 to 882.
"We shot the low round of the
day," said Schaaf. "We forced them
(UCLA) to play well, and they
responded . . . but we just can't shoot
a poor first round and expect to win."
The Bruins were led by senior Duffy
Waldorf, who shot the tournament's
individual best, 214. Waldorf, who
also won the California Amateur title
this summer, was aided by teammates
Frank Jobe and Roger Gunn, who
were third and fifth, respectively.
Stanford seniors Doug Thompson
(218) and Tim Robinson (222)
turned in good performances, finish
ing second and tied for third,

respectively Both of them are return
ing starters from last year's squad.
Along with senior Scott Erickson and
juniors Carl Wagner and Don
Walsworth, the Cardinal hopes to
create a winning image for Stanford
golf.
"Stanford really doesn't have much
of a reputation for being competitive.
But we'd like to change that," said
Schaaf, who is beginning his fourth
year as coach of the men's team.
The Bruins will be one of the top
10 teams in the country when the
rankings come out later this season,
according to Schaaf. Stanford should
be one of the top three teams in the
West, along with UCLA and USC.
The Cardinal travels to Lake Tahoe
for the Edge wood Tournament this
weekend.
