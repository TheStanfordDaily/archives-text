Goldie shines
Stanford junior Dan Goldie was one of only
three players on the 1984 U.S. Tennis Association
Junior Davis Cup team to receive a wild card berth
into the U.S. Open. The berth was based on his fine
showing in the Washington, D.C. Grand Prix where
he defeated Chip Hooper, Jimmy Arias and Brian
Gottfried en route to the quarterfinals.
After the U.S. Open, Goldie also got to the semi
finals of the Pacific Southwest Open in Los Angeles
