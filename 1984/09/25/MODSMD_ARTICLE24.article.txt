### 
PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Chicago Cubs, with Rick
Sutcliffe firing a two-hitter for his 14th straight victory,
captured their first championship in 39 years last night
when they won the National League East title by beating
the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-1.
The Cubs, who have not reached post-season play since
losing the 1945 World Series, will open the best-of-five
National League Championship Series on Oct. 2 at home
against the San Diego Padres, the NL West winners.
Chicago and San Diego began the season as the only NL
teams never to win a title since divisional play started in
1969.
Chicago jumped on Pirates starter Larry McWilliams
for solo runs in each of the first three innings and then
breezed behind Sutcliffe, 16-1, who tied the team record
for consecutive victories while striking out nine and
walking none.
The Cubs took a 1-0 lead in the first when Ryne

Sandberg lined the first of his two doubles and came home
on Gary Matthews single, his league-high 19th game win
ning RBI.
Larry Bowa singled to start the Cubs' second and ad
vanced on the play when third baseman Jim Morrison
threw wildly. Sutcliffe then singled to make it 2-0.
Sandberg doubled off McWilliams, 11-1!, to lead off
the Chicago third before Matthews walked. Keith
Moreland followed with a bunt single and when Morrison
threw the ball away, Sandberg scored to put Chicago
ahead 3-0.
The Pirates, who delayed the Cubs' pennant express
with a three-game sweep last week in Chicago, did not
manage a hit until rookie Joe Orsulak led off the fourth
with a triple. He came home on Johnny Ray's groundout.
Chicago added a run in the fifth when Matthews
walked. Moreland singled and Jody Davis bounced into a
double play.
