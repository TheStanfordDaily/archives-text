# Maria Dallas keeps fruit stand going

### BETH KLEID Daily staff 
There is a new female entrepreneur
on campus, but she is not running her
business for the money she will make.
After her husband Tomaso Dallas
died of a heart attack on June 27,
Maria Dallas decided to close the
fruit stand in White Plaza where the
couple had worked for the past 13
years.
Maria was overcome with grief,
and she thought she would never be
able to run the stand again.
"When Tom died I lost a part of
myself. I felt as if I had no more
value," Maria said with her thick Ital
ian accent. "1 was like a robot who
was going in no direction. I told the
bookstore to dispose of everything of
ours. Then I thought it would be
impossible to re-open the stand —

there were too many memories of
Tom."
The 73-year-old Italian woman
sought comfort from her children
after her husband died. "They are so
dear. My children bring me joy, and
I'm so proud of them, " she said of
her two sons, their wives and her five
grandchildren. But when the
grandchildren returned to school this
month, Maria felt alone.
" I lived a pathetic life the begin
ning of this month. I slept much of the
time — me, who is always so active!"
Maria is used to a lifestyle that in
cludes work. When she was a girl of
16 in Rome she ran a design business,
and she was in charge of a crew of
eight other girls. Work was also a
large part of her relationship with
Tom. "A good thing about the fruit
stand was that Tom and I could be to

gether all of the time," she said.
The sedentary life did not agree
with Maria. In fact, her doctor recom
mended that she go back to selling
fruit here. "The fruit stand was my
little world — it made me happy. I
was just like a senior who leaves
Stanford and misses it terribly, " she
said. "I just couldn't give it up."
So as autumn quarter begins, stu
dents and faculty find Maria, h ;r fruit

places next to the bookstore. There is
an addition to the business: The Dal
las' son, Paul, is helping his mother
run the stand. The only thing missing
is Tom, who is sorely missed by Maria
and others in the Stanford commu
nity.
Throughout the first two days of
this week, Maria has been ap
proached by many of her customers
who offer their condolences and in
return receive a warm hug. "I love
the people here like children, which is
another reason I came back — I want
them to eat fruit that is so good for
them.
"Tom and I have so many special
friends here. With their help, I think I

Dallas was as much of a star on White Plaza as other celebrities who visited the Farm. Last spring he dis
cussed issues with Tom Brokaw.
