# Maria Dallas keeps fruit stand going
## 
### BETH KLEID Daily staff 
There is a new female entrepreneur
on campus, but she is not running her
business for the money she will make.
After her husband Tomaso Dallas
died of a heart attack on June 27,
Maria Dallas decided to close the
fruit stand in White Plaza where the
couple had worked for the past 13
years.
Maria was overcome with grief,
and she thought she would never be
able to run the stand again.
"When Tom died I lost a part of
myself. I felt as if I had no more
value," Maria said with her thick Ital
ian accent. "1 was like a robot who
was going in no direction. I told the
bookstore to dispose of everything of
ours. Then I thought it would be
impossible to re-open the stand —

there were too many memories of
Tom."
The 73-year-old Italian woman
sought comfort from her children
after her husband died. "They are so
dear. My children bring me joy, and
I'm so proud of them, " she said of
her two sons, their wives and her five
grandchildren. But when the
grandchildren returned to school this
month, Maria felt alone.
" I lived a pathetic life the begin
ning of this month. I slept much of the
time — me, who is always so active!"
Maria is used to a lifestyle that in
cludes work. When she was a girl of
16 in Rome she ran a design business,
and she was in charge of a crew of
eight other girls. Work was also a
large part of her relationship with
Tom. "A good thing about the fruit
stand was that Tom and I could be to

gether all of the time," she said.
The sedentary life did not agree
with Maria. In fact, her doctor recom
mended that she go back to selling
fruit here. "The fruit stand was my
little world — it made me happy. I
was just like a senior who leaves
Stanford and misses it terribly, " she
said. "I just couldn't give it up."
So as autumn quarter begins, stu
dents and faculty find Maria, h ;r fruit

classical music all in their proper

an addition to the business: The Dal
las' son, Paul, is helping his mother
run the stand. The only thing missing
is Tom, who is sorely missed by Maria
and others in the Stanford commu
nity.
Throughout the first two days of
this week, Maria has been ap
proached by many of her customers
who offer their condolences and in
return receive a warm hug. "I love
the people here like children, which is
another reason I came back — I want

Maria said that she likes the
serenity of the Stanford campus. But
the native Italian also likes the inten
sity of her surroundings on the Farm.
"The people want so badly to learn,
and as an Italian of course I believe
that life should be lived with pas
sion."
According to Maria, her husband
lived life with this great zest. "Tom

really have to be alive," she said. "In

our marriage Tom and I lived every
single second — we never threw any
time out of the window."
The recent widow believes that
communication was what made her
marriage such a strong and happy
one. She stresses the importance of
open and honest talk, and she wants
to get this point across to the students
she encounters. "Tom and I were ap
proached by many students who
wanted advice about many things, but
especially about their boyfriends or
girlfriends. Our marriage was an ex
ample for them."
In addition to giving "the best ad

vice we knew" to the students here,
Maria and Tomaso worked to teach
lessons about life. One of these les
sons concerns money versus happi
ness.
"The value of life is not in money.
If you have enough to live then you
have enough to be happy," said

Maria. "What counts is the people
you go around with — friendship and
emotion are what's important in life."
And Tomaso was a great friend to his
wife. "We were able to reach each
other."
Maria met Tom on a boat going
from Italy to New York. She was en

gaged to a man in Italy at the time, so
she really didn't give Tom much at
tention. Tom was persistent, though.
"He was after me for three years,"
Maria chuckled. "Eventually, I
decided that he was the one for me.
He was quite a guy. and very good
looking."

The Dallases also hoped to bring a
flavor of Europe to the Farm when
they opened their stand in after
Tomaso had suffered his first heart
attack. They gave up the restaurant
they owned in Palo Alto when a doc
tor told Tom that he should have a
less strenuous job. They chose to

open the stand here because of an
idea of one of the patrons of their res
taurant, a Stanford professor.
"It was a great tdea because I love
working with the public — I love the
crowd."
The crowd loves Maria too, and
they loved Tomaso. Maria boasts a
case of letters she and Tom had
received from students who were
overseas, and her collection of con
dolence letters from the Stanford
community is equally large.
Although Tom is gone, Maria has a
special way of making his presence
seem real. She has tapes of her hus-

the recorder near the stand, and
before she goes to sleep at home.
"The thing that I want to remember
him for most is his singing." Tom was
a singer who performed in local Bay
Area clubs.
"When I hear those tapes, Tom is
with me." said Maria. "When he was
alive he was neurotic about me taping
him — he didn't like it at all. But who
ever thought that a little tape recor
der could bring me so much happi
ness when Tom is gone?"

community, including Donald Kennedy, were amused by Tom's good

Maria said that she likes the
serenity of the Stanford campus. But
the native Italian also likes the inten

"The people want so badly to learn,
and as an Italian of course I believe
that life should be lived with pas

According to Maria, her husband

our marriage Tom and I lived every

time out of the window."
The recent widow believes that
communication was what made her
marriage such a strong and happy
one. She stresses the importance of
open and honest talk, and she wants
to get this point across to the students
she encounters. "Tom and I were ap
proached by many students who
wanted advice about many things, but
especially about their boyfriends or
girlfriends. Our marriage was an ex
ample for them."
In addition to giving "the best ad

vice we knew" to the students here,
Maria and Tomaso worked to teach
lessons about life. One of these les
sons concerns money versus happi
ness.
"The value of life is not in money.
If you have enough to live then you
have enough to be happy," said

Maria. "What counts is the people
you go around with — friendship and
emotion are what's important in life."
And Tomaso was a great friend to his
wife. "We were able to reach each
other."
Maria met Tom on a boat going
from Italy to New York. She was en

gaged to a man in Italy at the time, so
she really didn't give Tom much at
tention. Tom was persistent, though.
"He was after me for three years,"
Maria chuckled. "Eventually, I
decided that he was the one for me.
He was quite a guy. and very good
looking."

The Dallases also hoped to bring a
flavor of Europe to the Farm when
they opened their stand in after
Tomaso had suffered his first heart
attack. They gave up the restaurant
they owned in Palo Alto when a doc

less strenuous job. They chose to

open the stand here because of an
idea of one of the patrons of their res
taurant, a Stanford professor.
"It was a great tdea because I love
working with the public — I love the
crowd."
The crowd loves Maria too, and
they loved Tomaso. Maria boasts a
case of letters she and Tom had
received from students who were
overseas, and her collection of con
dolence letters from the Stanford
community is equally large.

before she goes to sleep at home.
"The thing that I want to remember
him for most is his singing." Tom was
a singer who performed in local Bay
Area clubs.
"When I hear those tapes, Tom is
with me." said Maria. "When he was
alive he was neurotic about me taping
him — he didn't like it at all. But who
ever thought that a little tape recor
der could bring me so much happi
ness when Tom is gone?"

community, including Donald Kennedy, were amused by Tom's good

natured sense of humor. He often joked that a piece of fruit cost $50
rather than 50 cents.
There is a new female entrepreneur
on campus, but she is not running her
business for the money she will make.
After her husband Tomaso Dallas
died of a heart attack on June 27,
Maria Dallas decided to close the
fruit stand in White Plaza where the
couple had worked for the past 13
years.
Maria was overcome with grief,
and she thought she would never be
able to run the stand again.
"When Tom died I lost a part of
myself. I felt as if I had no more
value," Maria said with her thick Ital
ian accent. "1 was like a robot who
was going in no direction. I told the
bookstore to dispose of everything of
ours. Then I thought it would be
impossible to re-open the stand —

there were too many memories of
Tom."
The 73-year-old Italian woman
sought comfort from her children
after her husband died. "They are so
dear. My children bring me joy, and
I'm so proud of them, " she said of
her two sons, their wives and her five
grandchildren. But when the
grandchildren returned to school this
month, Maria felt alone.
" I lived a pathetic life the begin
ning of this month. I slept much of the
time — me, who is always so active!"
Maria is used to a lifestyle that in
cludes work. When she was a girl of
16 in Rome she ran a design business,
and she was in charge of a crew of
eight other girls. Work was also a
large part of her relationship with
Tom. "A good thing about the fruit
stand was that Tom and I could be to

gether all of the time," she said.
The sedentary life did not agree
with Maria. In fact, her doctor recom
mended that she go back to selling
fruit here. "The fruit stand was my
little world — it made me happy. I
was just like a senior who leaves
Stanford and misses it terribly, " she
said. "I just couldn't give it up."
So as autumn quarter begins, stu
dents and faculty find Maria, h ;r fruit

an addition to the business: The Dal

is Tom, who is sorely missed by Maria
and others in the Stanford commu
nity.
Throughout the first two days of
this week, Maria has been ap
