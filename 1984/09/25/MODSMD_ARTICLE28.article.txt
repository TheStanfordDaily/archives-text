## Baez still looking down the muzzle 
### KAREN MARIE PLATT 
Not so deep in the annals of Stan
ford lore is tucked a page, and maybe
a poem, about a young woman named
Joan Baez. Her name conjures
memories of creative energy and so
cial unrest that some would sooner
leave forgotten and others still dream
of someday recapturing.
She was typecast for the 19605. She
had a genius for staying in the thick of
it. Her associates, people like Martin
Luther King and Bob Dylan, loomed
large in the media, and she was right
there beside them, singing "We Shall
Overcome," haunting old English
ballads and country & western love
songs.
Now King is among the dead, and
Bob Dylan is a born-again Christian
(or completed Jew. if you will), and
Baez (who released over 31 albums
and earned eight gold albums over
the past 20 years) doesn't even have a
record contract. In fact, many Stan
ford undergraduates have probably
never heard her traditional ballads
and rousing protest songs which, as
Kurt l.oder of Rolling Stone des
cribed. "warmed up for the Sixties.'
Joan is the daughter of Alberto
Vinicio Baez, a now retired physicist,
UNESCO consultant, author of a
now old textbook, "The Spiral Ap
proach to Physics," and a former
University professor. She attended
Palo Alto High School, and despite a
peripatetic childhood and equally
well-traveled adult life (perpetuated
by her recent European tour with
Bob Dylan), she makes her home in
Woodside. She never attended Stan
ford, though she might have, were she
not well on her way to being a cele
brated folk singer by age 18.
In many ways, Joan Baez is your
typical wealthy Californian. Her par
ents are divorced. So is she. (Her
former husband is draft resistor and
former Stanford student body presi
dent David Harris.) Her one child,
Gabriel, is 14 years old. She is writing
a book, a kind of autobiography, and (
is active in a humanitarian organiza
tion, her own Humanitas Interna
tional.
Once called "Mexican madonna"
by the press, at age 43 Joan is still an
attractive woman. And despite disap
pointments in love and family life, she
says she's in good spirits. Her wit is
dry, her laugh infectious. Her grace
ful maturity makes her strikingly
unlike the little girl wii'n long locks
whose naivete and charmed voice

pleased folk music listeners around
the world.
Over the last 25 years she has per
sistently adhered to her convictions
and has relentlessly challenged our
countrv's international and domestic
policies. She has asked us to re
evaluate our methods of dealing with
conflict in our lives, and has given us
some beautiful love songs. Whether
or not we agree with her pacifism, it
must be said that the very fact of her
continued presence as an artist and
social activist in this country
demonstrates that one can make
waves without falling entirely out of
the boat. She is also proof positive of
my midwestern-born mother's favor
ite cliche: It takes all kinds to make a
world.
We have a series of questions here
that may fall together. They may not.
So, here goes . . . How do you recon
cile your roles as political activist and
artist? Are they one and the same?
"They're not the same thing, but
they're intertwined. They used to be
easier to manage, but that was be
cause of the times. If I sang a country
and western song that I happened to
like and dedicated it to my husband
who was in prison for draft resistence,
then the song did not have to have
any political content at all. It's more
difficult now . . . The voice I consider
a gift, my greatest gift, and I want to
treat it as that and do with it as much
as I can, so that's going to involve all
the other things."
When you walked up on the stage at
the Newport Folk Festival in 1959, did
you have any idea that you would do
both those things most of the rest of
your life?
"Well I think I had some idea, al
though I couldn't verbalize it very
well at that point. When I started
singing, I was 14. I started singing for
myself with a ukulele because I was
bored with school, and it was fun, and
an outlet, and a way for me to meet
people because I was always a new
kid in a new school. I was the local
lunchtime jester but it beat nothing.
Then, when I was 16,1 was very con
scious of what was going on in the
world. I was on my first peace march
when I was 14, and when I was 16 I
had my first public political action in
high school. 1 refused to go home

during an air raid drill.
"I was offended by the fact that the
government thought they could trick
high school kids into thinking that if
we went home and sat in our cellars
that we'd be safe from nuclear war.
That's twenty-seven or -eight years
ago now."
Was some of that a carrying-out of
your family?
"Yes, definitely. It was before I
knew anything approaching a protest
song. My family is Ouaker. A Quaker
takes the sanctity of human life more
seriously than they take the nation
state. So you run into trouble in
stantly because people figure that if
you don't have flags flying all over
your house then you're anti-
American. But it's really about caring
and looking after people, trying to
have some kind of compassion for
everybody in the world. And begin
ning to diminish the borders rather
than build them up.
Talking to Stanford alumni, 1 heard
that during the '60s, Ira Sandperl,
your mentor, used to sit in the quad or
around Tresidder and talk with stu
dents. What did he teach you?
"He had the strongest influence on
me of anybody in my life, aside from
my parents. We worked together,
closely, for about 22 years.
"1 was a pacifist from my parents'
upbringing. It came natural to me,
and they must have done something
right in their lives because I didn't
reject their pacifism. It made real
sense to me. But when I met Ira, what
he did was radicalize that.
"A good Western pacifist — a
Ouaker or Mennonite — will say, 'I
hold my candle to the darkness, do
what I can in my own little way.' But
Gandhi radicalized that with Eastern
non-violence. Whereas a good
pacifist will say, 'resist not evil and
turn the other cheek,' Gandhi turned
the other cheek because he thought
fighting was stupid. But he said resist
evil.
"Gandhi said confront evil. There's
conflict everywhere, walk up to it,
confront it and organize against it.
And in your fighting against it, drop
their weapons and use your own. In
other words, you get to accept suffer
ing; you don't get to kill anybody."

Do you see that as inconsistent with
Christ?
"Well, it's inconsistent with typical
Christian behavior, whether it's a
Christian pacifist or non-pacifist. The
new thing was taking an aggressive
step forward to confront the wicked
ness and evil and troubles, and or
ganizing like hell, and taking big risks
.. . Christ certainly took risks. I think
people really get offended when they
think about it. He organized in a
sense . .. There have really only been
two major mass movements of non
violence — Christ and Gandhi.
"Christ was essentially non-violent
in the sense I would like. 1 mean he
got pissed off and threw the money

lenders out of the temple, and I think
that's correct. He didn't kill anybody.
I think that spontaneous kind of rage
is a lot safer than what we're doing
now internationally which is organiz
ing mass murder."
Let's go back to your art. Who
taught you how to play the guitar?
"Nobody in particular and
everybody in Harvard Square and the
Cambridge coffee shop scene in
1959. I had learned the ukulele from
my father's Stanford professor, Paul
Kirkland, who still lives on Stanford
Avenue on campus. And the ukulele
is the same as the guitar minus two
strings. I never took lessons."

And where did you get your early
folk material? Some of it was very
traditional.
"From the coffee shops and
friends, and 1 think I got about four of
them from books. I don't learn well
from books. It was what was happen
ing. You wandered around the square
and every other person had a guitar
around his back. You'd sit down and
exchange songs, and then the next
step was songwriting. First it was
traditional ballads, and then this crop
of new songwriters emerged."
At the Eurythmics concert a few
weeks ago, Annie Lenox sang, "I
Heard It Through the Grapevine" and

old Martha and the Vandellas tunes. It
was like a techno-motown revival. Do
you think folk music will be revived?
"I don't think it will be rerun; I
don't think there are many re-runs.
Hut what I think is happening now is
an exodus away from reality, and the
music reflects that. It's to be cosmic,
to be spacey, to do anything but con
front the reality we live in. And it's
perfectly understandable. Look how
long most kids think they have to live.
Most understand that they have a
very good chance of having not very

long to live. I think we're in the
throes right now of trying desperately
not to face that."
Do you see young people today as
more or less balanced than during the
'60s?
"They are sitting on their panic.
You can do that by watching MTV,
by taking a reasonable amount of
drugs, and kind of maintain a false
equilibrium. Because this world is so
fragile that it's hard to believe. And
you have to understand that what

we're talking about is almost unique
to the United States. People in other
countries are not as cocooned as we
are here. They can't be.
"In Germany they feel the small
ness of their country. They feel the
nearness of the U.S.S.R. They feel
the presence of the USA in the form
of the cruise and the Pershing
(missiles). I'm there a lot, and they
talk about it. Different countries have
different degrees of social and politi
cal involvement and activity, but here
is the least with young people.
"I think it has a-lot to do with this

administration. The keynote of this
administration is invulnerability and
the new patriotism. I am insulted. I
think I am an intelligent human
being, I travel, I see a lot of people
and I read, and I think,' Yes, it is four
minutes to midnight.' We've got our
selves in a very, very tenuous situa
tion. And when Reagan will write
that off as doomsaying . . .
"People are paranoid to have
reasonable thoughts about the shape
of society. 'Oh, well, I'm just a
depressive personality'. . . well, I'm
not. In fact I'm quite bouyant or I

wouldn't he doing what I'm doing.
"I watch that happening and I
don't know how it can he stopped. It
takes some kind of strange shock, and
our shock-absorbers are so well
tuned. We've had so many shocks
since we were born. Whether we're
talking about 18-year- olds or 43-
year-olds, we've spent our lives in a
way just polishing up the shock ab
sorbers so we don't die with the next
shock.
"There's a tidal wave of craziness.
It's stupid. It's full of lies. It's hys
teria. 'New patriotism." What the hell
does that mean? What are we being
patriotic about? The Olympic
Games? What is really happening' 1
How many millions of people are
starving and out of jobs and
miserable and distraught? And we're
not going to pay any attention to
that?
"I think it's important to bring up
the genuine state of affairs in the
world, and then let people know that
it doesn't mean you have to commit
yourself to an insane asylum. If you
really felt all that, then you would be
crazy. And some people can't handle
all that and they go crazy. If you have
too much compassion, 1 mean feeling
for everything, and you can't organize
your thoughts, then you do Hip out.
"But with a little help from your
friends and some discipline and ac
tion, you find your life can really be
very rich by involving it with those
problems rather than running away
from them. Because you'll never get
away from them until you die. And
who knows what happens then. /
don't know what happens then ..."
As a proponent of social justice?
"I didn't use the word much
myself. It makes me kind of ner
vous."
So on what basis do you make your
moral judgements?
"I'll be even more pompous than
you'll believe. I had it figured out by
the time I was 10. I lived in the
Middle East. I saw people starving. I
saw people, the way they related to
each other on a very primitive level.
And I figured out that what I had was

the love of my parents, a warm bed.
and three meals a day.and what felt
good. 1 did not like to be hungr\ or
unhappy or feel sick. I didn't like
throwing up. And I extended that in
my mind to'l wonder what it would be
like to really be hurt, to really be cold
in the winter, to be like the little boy
who lived over the fence and only had
one thing to wear so that when he
washed it he was naked. I thought I
wouldn't like that. I drew my conclu
sions from what I thought it telt like.
"Actually, that's held up pretty
well. I'm 43 and 1 feel the same way.
In other words, the only realistic way
to look at a gun is to look down the
muzzle, not the noble things you're
doing on the other side holding it.
You still attend the Friends meetings
in Palo Alto. Do von call yourself a
Quaker, and what do you think of
Biblical faith?
"Biblical faith doesn't have much
to do with Quaker meeting. That's
probably why I'm in Quaker meeting
rather than some other church. Be
cause in Quaker meeting you just sit
in a silent meditation where you seek
the world and direction of God.
Sometimes we all scratch our heads
and wonder why we're there. But I
find that I get grounded there. I tind
that I feel very humble in the eyes ot
God and the rest of the world. I get
some perspective on how minute 1
am, how minute are all the grandiose
ideas I have of saving the world.
Gandhi said that meditation is as vital
to the non-violent solider as drill
practice is to a conventional soldier.
It doesn't have much to do with Bibli
cal teachings, except thou shalt not
kill."
What about the Ten Commandments
as a codification of what's just?
"Sure. I think they do pretty well. I
think people glide over thou shalt not
kill with too much facility and get
very stiff about the other ones. But
hey, if you want guidelines on how to
live, you might start with that."'
Clearly, Gandhi is still a hero for
you. Are there any contemporary


"It would be silly for me to do what's currently selling platinum. I couldn't do it as well as Oingo-Boingo does it" — Joan Baez
people that you admire?
"Lech Walesa. And I admire this
wonderful Swedish ambassador
named Eddelson — he's an ex
amhassador now. He did some noble
and dangerous things. He was in Chili
during a military coup, and he went
around waving a little Swedish (lag in
the air and rescuing people in front of
tanks and guns. I asked him why he
did it, because he could have easily
been blown away and nobody would
have heard about it much. He said.
'I've never been able to tolerate in
justice."
"I think courage is probably what 1
most admire and am in awe of. And 1
don't mean brave people, but people
who are afraid and act in spite of their
fear. Because we all have to deal with
fear and how we're going to break
through it."
At Branner Hall last spring, you
said something to the effect that being
strong has nothing to do with having a
strong military defense. Would you
explain that?
"If we talked about strength, I
might have tried to re-define strength
because we have come to interpret
power and strength in really only one
way, and that's military might . . . but

there really isn't any way to be
stronger that way anymore because
we all go at once.
"So what kind of strength can we
have? What about ourselves? What
about our culture? What about moral
strength? I probably talked about
moral and spiritual deterioration at
every border in the world. And I'm
not talking Moral Majority. I'm
talking about real moral fiber, real
caring."
Traditionally, caring seems to he
made the province of women. Do you
ever feel frustrated, like you're a wo
man screaming out to men who just
can't see beyond themselves?
"I just wrote a story. It's in my
typewriter. When Gabriel, my son,
was 10 years old, we were watching
TV together and the news came on.
There was a bright shiny new missile
coming out of the shaft towards the
viewer with a bunch of generals
speaking and everybody sort of bus
tling around in great excitement, and
Gabe said, T know what you're think
ing mother. You're thinking, look at
that bright shiny new penis and all the
men with hard-ons.'
"Well I nearly dropped dead!. ..
That was what we were just talking
about. That, for them, preserved their
manhood, for another day or another
week or until they thought the Rus
sians had a bigger one. And then wo
men have bought into it because they
don't know what else to think, be

cause it's just been going on so long."
We've heard you're writing a book?
"Mm-mmm. 1 cancelled a tour a
decided to stay home, that I really
feel like writing. I wrote one book but

We've had so many shocks since we
were born. Whether we're talking
about 18-year-olds or 43-year-olds,
we've spent our lives in a way just
polishing up the shock absorbers so we
don't die with the next shock.'

that was about 18 years ago. and it's
been out of print for a while."
And this one is autobiographical?
"Yeah. It seems to be the way 1
write best, vignettes and
autobiographical. And 1 think that
my job now is to help people face the
'80s, and share something about the
'60s because they still are fascinated
about them, even kids that weren't
around . . . There was this French kid
in France screaming, 'Wood
stock! Woodstock!' I looked at
him and said, 'You weren't even born
yet!' He didn't care; he just wanted it

to be Woodstock.
"What I do in every concert is try
to pull people away from that. Sure,
you have the good things we got from
the '60s. and now. guess what? We
have the boring old '80s. and if we
don't get it together, we're not going

to have a '905."
What bad things came out of the
'60s?
"There's some very unhappy resi
due. not to mention several million
Vietnamese dead. And the residue of
the Vietnam veterans is not exactly
cheerful. There's some guys walking
around with their br-.ins out of whack
who will be happy to tell you so.
"I think it's not so much what bad
things came out of the '60s; that's not
the point. The point is that they wore
themselves out. The final death of the
'60s, I think, was when John Lennon

died. 1 thought people would really
catch on about then. It didn't faze
them. They're still hanging in there
thinking there's going to be another
Woodstock, and there isn't going to
be. There's going to be other things,
and it's up to us to make them inter
esting . . . more interesting than Atari
games and MTV."
What about technology?
"There doesn't seem u> be any way
of holding back the technology that's
growing. When the French president
came over here, missus wanted to
have a tea-party hoping that Bob
Dylan and Leonard Cohen would
come. Well, they couldn't make it so
we made tacos together without
them. But mister had to go to 1 don't
know how many places in Silicon Val
ley. And he wasn't just doing it be
cause he had to. He was doing it be
cause he sees that that's it. that's
what's happening."
When I asked you about your moral
ideas and judgements, you referred to
your feelings, whereas an academician
or politician might refer to facts and
proceed to deduce his opinions.
"That's not my strong point . .
As an artist, if you were given a
choice between persuading by political
activity and by your art, which would
you choose?

"You have to do both. We even did
a film called Music Alone Is Not
Enough.' I used to have these grand
theories about how in order tor art to
be good it had to be ethical and in
volved and all that. Unfortunately, I
don't think that's true at all. I think
people who didn't give a shit about
anybody have given the most beauti
ful art to the world."
If you had a choice between politi
cal action and art, which would you
choose?
"Depends on the person, you see.
Once I was trying to get about 200
Laotians out of the river and on to the
Thailand border without them being
shot. So 1 went to a Thai colonel, a
big mucky-muck. It was really in his
hands. I thought, what on earth do I
say to this guy? Do I need to go to
bed with him, or what do I do? I
mean there's a certain flexibility you
have to have. Well. I didn't have to go
that far, and I don't know that I could
have, but 1 asked him if 1 sang him a
song would he be willing to give the
orders to come on the shore? And he
said okay. So it sort of depended on
the song then. So I knew I had to
knock him off his feet with some
thing; so I sang 'Swing Low' at the
top of my lungs. Everybody shut up
and was duly impressed and he made
the telephone call."
