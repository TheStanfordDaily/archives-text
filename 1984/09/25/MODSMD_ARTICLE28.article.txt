## Baez still looking down the muzzle 
### KAREN MARIE PLATT 
Not so deep in the annals of Stan
ford lore is tucked a page, and maybe
a poem, about a young woman named
Joan Baez. Her name conjures
memories of creative energy and so
cial unrest that some would sooner
leave forgotten and others still dream
of someday recapturing.
She was typecast for the 19605. She
had a genius for staying in the thick of
it. Her associates, people like Martin
Luther King and Bob Dylan, loomed
large in the media, and she was right
there beside them, singing "We Shall
Overcome," haunting old English
ballads and country & western love
songs.
Now King is among the dead, and
Bob Dylan is a born-again Christian
(or completed Jew. if you will), and
Baez (who released over 31 albums
and earned eight gold albums over
the past 20 years) doesn't even have a
record contract. In fact, many Stan
ford undergraduates have probably
never heard her traditional ballads
and rousing protest songs which, as
Kurt l.oder of Rolling Stone des
cribed. "warmed up for the Sixties.'
Joan is the daughter of Alberto
Vinicio Baez, a now retired physicist,
UNESCO consultant, author of a
now old textbook, "The Spiral Ap
proach to Physics," and a former
University professor. She attended
Palo Alto High School, and despite a
peripatetic childhood and equally
well-traveled adult life (perpetuated
by her recent European tour with
Bob Dylan), she makes her home in
Woodside. She never attended Stan
ford, though she might have, were she
not well on her way to being a cele
brated folk singer by age 18.
In many ways, Joan Baez is your
typical wealthy Californian. Her par
ents are divorced. So is she. (Her
former husband is draft resistor and
former Stanford student body presi
dent David Harris.) Her one child,
Gabriel, is 14 years old. She is writing
a book, a kind of autobiography, and (
is active in a humanitarian organiza
tion, her own Humanitas Interna
tional.
Once called "Mexican madonna"
by the press, at age 43 Joan is still an
attractive woman. And despite disap
pointments in love and family life, she
says she's in good spirits. Her wit is
dry, her laugh infectious. Her grace
ful maturity makes her strikingly
unlike the little girl wii'n long locks
whose naivete and charmed voice

pleased folk music listeners around
the world.
Over the last 25 years she has per
sistently adhered to her convictions
and has relentlessly challenged our
countrv's international and domestic
policies. She has asked us to re
evaluate our methods of dealing with
conflict in our lives, and has given us
some beautiful love songs. Whether
or not we agree with her pacifism, it
must be said that the very fact of her
continued presence as an artist and
social activist in this country
demonstrates that one can make
waves without falling entirely out of
the boat. She is also proof positive of
my midwestern-born mother's favor
ite cliche: It takes all kinds to make a
world.
We have a series of questions here
that may fall together. They may not.
So, here goes . . . How do you recon
cile your roles as political activist and
artist? Are they one and the same?
"They're not the same thing, but
they're intertwined. They used to be
easier to manage, but that was be
cause of the times. If I sang a country
and western song that I happened to
like and dedicated it to my husband
who was in prison for draft resistence,
then the song did not have to have
any political content at all. It's more
difficult now . . . The voice I consider
a gift, my greatest gift, and I want to
treat it as that and do with it as much
as I can, so that's going to involve all
the other things."
When you walked up on the stage at
the Newport Folk Festival in 1959, did
you have any idea that you would do
both those things most of the rest of
your life?
"Well I think I had some idea, al
though I couldn't verbalize it very
well at that point. When I started
singing, I was 14. I started singing for
myself with a ukulele because I was
bored with school, and it was fun, and
an outlet, and a way for me to meet
people because I was always a new
kid in a new school. I was the local
lunchtime jester but it beat nothing.
Then, when I was 16,1 was very con
scious of what was going on in the
world. I was on my first peace march
when I was 14, and when I was 16 I
had my first public political action in
high school. 1 refused to go home

during an air raid drill.
"I was offended by the fact that the
government thought they could trick
high school kids into thinking that if
we went home and sat in our cellars
that we'd be safe from nuclear war.
That's twenty-seven or -eight years
ago now."
Was some of that a carrying-out of
your family?
"Yes, definitely. It was before I
knew anything approaching a protest
song. My family is Ouaker. A Quaker
takes the sanctity of human life more
seriously than they take the nation
state. So you run into trouble in
stantly because people figure that if
you don't have flags flying all over
your house then you're anti-
American. But it's really about caring
and looking after people, trying to
have some kind of compassion for
everybody in the world. And begin
ning to diminish the borders rather
than build them up.
Talking to Stanford alumni, 1 heard
that during the '60s, Ira Sandperl,
your mentor, used to sit in the quad or
around Tresidder and talk with stu
dents. What did he teach you?
"He had the strongest influence on
me of anybody in my life, aside from
my parents. We worked together,
closely, for about 22 years.
"1 was a pacifist from my parents'
upbringing. It came natural to me,
and they must have done something
right in their lives because I didn't
reject their pacifism. It made real
sense to me. But when I met Ira, what
he did was radicalize that.
"A good Western pacifist — a
Ouaker or Mennonite — will say, 'I
hold my candle to the darkness, do
what I can in my own little way.' But
Gandhi radicalized that with Eastern
non-violence. Whereas a good
pacifist will say, 'resist not evil and
turn the other cheek,' Gandhi turned
the other cheek because he thought
fighting was stupid. But he said resist
evil.
"Gandhi said confront evil. There's
conflict everywhere, walk up to it,
confront it and organize against it.
And in your fighting against it, drop
their weapons and use your own. In
other words, you get to accept suffer
ing; you don't get to kill anybody."

Do you see that as inconsistent with
Christ?
"Well, it's inconsistent with typical
Christian behavior, whether it's a
Christian pacifist or non-pacifist. The
new thing was taking an aggressive
step forward to confront the wicked
ness and evil and troubles, and or
ganizing like hell, and taking big risks
.. . Christ certainly took risks. I think
people really get offended when they
think about it. He organized in a
sense . .. There have really only been
two major mass movements of non
violence — Christ and Gandhi.
"Christ was essentially non-violent
in the sense I would like. 1 mean he
got pissed off and threw the money

lenders out of the temple, and I think
that's correct. He didn't kill anybody.
I think that spontaneous kind of rage
is a lot safer than what we're doing
now internationally which is organiz
ing mass murder."
Let's go back to your art. Who
taught you how to play the guitar?
"Nobody in particular and
everybody in Harvard Square and the
Cambridge coffee shop scene in
1959. I had learned the ukulele from
my father's Stanford professor, Paul
Kirkland, who still lives on Stanford
Avenue on campus. And the ukulele
is the same as the guitar minus two
strings. I never took lessons."

And where did you get your early
folk material? Some of it was very
traditional.
"From the coffee shops and
friends, and 1 think I got about four of
them from books. I don't learn well
from books. It was what was happen
ing. You wandered around the square
and every other person had a guitar
around his back. You'd sit down and
exchange songs, and then the next
step was songwriting. First it was
traditional ballads, and then this crop
of new songwriters emerged."
At the Eurythmics concert a few
weeks ago, Annie Lenox sang, "I
Heard It Through the Grapevine" and
