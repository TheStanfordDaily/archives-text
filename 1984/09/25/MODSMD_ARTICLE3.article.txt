# LOTS expects user increase
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
Hackers who capitalized on the
University's Microdisc plan may be
staying away from LOTS this year,
but their presence may still be felt.
The proliferation of home com
puters on campus translates into
greater overall use — which may
mean longer queues for everyone, ac
cording to LOTS director Ralph
Gorin.
"I'm a well-known pessimist,"
Gorin says. "We believe each micro
computer represents a potential user
[of the traditionally overcrowded
LOTS computers]."
But he concedes, "We are increas
ing resources here to deal with it."
Susan Lansdale, assistant to the
vice-provost, agrees that LOTS will
be as busy as ever because of the
proliferation of microcomputers on
campus.
"There will be more interest in
computers, more people taking com
puter classes and . . . that will lead to
an increased demand at LOTS," she
said.
But the new "LOTS Two" center
at Tresidder, coupled with other im
provements in the University's sys
tem, should accommodate the addi
tional users wel) and even shorten
queues. A fourth LOTS mainframe is
expected to double the capacity of the
facility.
Microcomputer craze
This spring, Microdisc held a lot
tery to determine who would be the
first to purchase the reduced-price
Apple Macintosh microcomputer.
Demand was high and supply was
low. Stanford received only a few
hundred computers at the outset. But
as the demand for the Macintosh
decreased, Microdisc was able to fill
the backlog of orders.
Microdisc supplied computers to
all but 180 of the people in the
lottery, according to Steve

McLenegan, manager of the
Microdisc Receiving Office. "[Those
180 people] failed to pick up the
computer after receiving notification
that it was ready," he said. "Our
policy is to wait 10 days for them to
pick up their computers, and then
they lose their place."
"Current delivery projections for
the Macintosh are less than four
weeks," McLenegan said.
Jan Thomson, associate director of
Information Technology Services,
said Microdisc has sold more than
2,500 Macintosh computers to date
and expects to sell 2,000 more by the
end of 1984.
Microdisc also currently offers
Hewlett-Packard's 110 portable com
puter, 150 Touchscreen and 200 Se
ries Model 16, and three versions of
Apple's Lisa computer, and hopes by
January to add IBM and DEC to its
offerings, Thomson said.
Thomson also noted a change in
the University's policy on selling
peripherals — printers, external disk
drives and memory addition
packages.
The University currently offers
peripherals for the . pple and
Hewlett-Packard microcomputers
only to people who have previously
purchased a system through
Microdisc.
Beginning Oct. 15, Microdisc will
sell peripherals to anyone, Thomson
said. Hewlett-Packard's LaserJet
printer and Apple's 512K Memory
Expansion Kit are among the items
that will be offered.
Compatibility problem
With various computer systems
throughout campus, Stanford is
working toward a much higher degree
of compatibility among machines
than currently exists. The main prob
lem is with operating systems, the
code that turn: integrated vi.cuna,
Vv
wires and a block of metal into an
operating computer. Far too many
operating systems exist, with some
manufacturers having their own
proprietary systems.
The University belongs to the
Inter-University Consortium for
Educational Computing, which is
trying to get manufacturers to adopt
one standard system to make all their
computers compatible. The likeliest
current candidate here is Bell Labo
ratories' UNIX, now available on
many computers.
But Stanford currently has no plans
to switch to a uniform system.
"Fostering compatibility is a good

idea, but there are a couple reasons
tha it is a bad idea here," Gorin said.
Gorin said integrating the use of
one system into various departments
within the University would take too
much time, energy and money and
would block experimentation.
"And we are not omniscient," he
added, referring to which system
would best serve the University. "We
could make a wrong guess."
Gorin said the UNIX system, al
though favored by computer scien
tists, was "downright hostile to ordi
nary humans."
"It is a system for people who
themselves want to become com
puters," he said.
For now, at least, it appears Stan
ford's computer network will remain
heterogeneous.
