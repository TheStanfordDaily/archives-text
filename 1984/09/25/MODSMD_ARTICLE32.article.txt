# Briefly

Scott and Tracy and Frank were
here last night, and boy were they
great. Theirs was an excercise in
courage: Newcomers to The Daily,
they quickly found their own abilities
and posed a real threat to Charlie's.
And this trio was substantially more
polite and well-groomed.
All this pillow talk is just talking
shop. Edit board starts today at noon,
and there's a staff lunch 24 hours
later. We hope to see Scott and Tracy
and Frank and you right here on
Wednesday. Lunch is on us.
