# Campus-area fire kills one
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
A woman died and her husband
was badly burned when their Menlo
Park home caught fire late last night.
Witnesses said flames shot at least
70 feet into the air, threatening other
homes in the heavily wooded area.
More than 20 firefighters from four
districts arrived at the scene.
The blaze was located approxi
mately two miles southwest of
campus. Heavy smoke drifted toward
the University, engulfing the Gover
nor's Corner area shortly before mid
night.
Menlo Park firefighters pulled
E'dee Rainey from the burning house
just after 11:30 p.m. She was

pronounced dead at Stanford Hospi
tal. A hospital spokesperson said the
woman probably died of smoke in
halation.
Ed Rainey ran from the house and
was later taken to Stanford Hospital.
He is in stable condition after being
transferred to the burn unit of the
Valley Oaks Medical Center early
this morning.
Neighbors said Ed is a contractor
and his wife was a real estate agent.
E'dee Rainey was in her fifties.
Steve Kroeger, California Depart
ment of Forestry batallion chief, said
details about the victims and the
source of the fire were unknown.
Kroeger estimated damage to the

house at $60,000. He guessed the
home, located at 12 Bishop Lane, just
off Alpine Road, was worth at least
$150,000. Neighbors on the scene
said the one-story ranch-style build
ing, with a swimming pool in its back
yard, was worth between $350,000
and $400,000.
Doug Peterson, a photographer
with the Woodside Fire Department,
said he arrived approximately five
minutes after the first fire engine.
"When I first got here my big deci
sion was whether [or not 1 should] put
my camera down and grab a hose,"
Peterson said.
He said E'dee Rainey "was burned
pretty bad â€” face, legs, chest and
arms."

"It was terrifying," said Nathalie
Westbrook, a neighbor of the
Raineys'. "Sparks were shooting
everywhere."
Westbrook said neighbors helped
each other water down their roofs to
prevent the fire from spreading to
other homes in the area.
Firefighters from Menlo Park,
Woodside, Palo Alto and the Califor
nia Department of Forestry
responded to the call. Kroeger said
because the fire occurred in an uni
ncorporated area, the fire is techni
cally the responsibility of the county.
"It was real good cooperation be
tween the departments," Kroeger
said.


Firefighters work to control a blaze in Menlo Park early this morning.
