Although the face may be
familiar to alumni and students
alike, the desk behind which the
man sits has changed. On the first
of this month. Economics Prof.
James Rosse, entering his 20th
year at Stanford, assumed the

position of University Provost.
Rosse, a past chairman of the
Economics Department and last
fall's head of the Reagan Library
Faculty Advisory Committee,
assumed the post long occupied by
Albert Hastorf. His appointment
in early May ended a seven-month
search by a committee of faculty
members and students chaired by
University President Donald Ken
nedy.
More than 350 names were
mentioned as possible candidates
for the job, and Rosse said that he
"wasn't aware" he was on the
committee's list until very late in
the decision making process.
According to Bob Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president, the official
title of Rosse's position is Univer
sity Vice President and Provost,
making him one of six vice presi
dents. Rosse is the "first among
equals" as a vice president, as he
serves as acting president when
Kennedy is away.
Rosse said he has a "close"
working relationship with Ken
nedy, noting that he was a member
of the committee that nominated
Kennedy for the position of Presi
dent five years ago. Today, the
two talk at least four or five times
a week to discuss University
operations.
He said the provost has three
areas of responsibility.
The provost is "one of the two
key officers of the University and
its chief academic officer," Rosse
said. When the president is in
capacitated, it is the provost who
fills his post as acting president for
that period, according to Rosse.
Rosse also serves as the "dean
of deans," because the heads of all
