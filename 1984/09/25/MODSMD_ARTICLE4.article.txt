# Rosse assumes provost position
## features 
### 
The summer months brought
many personnel changes in the up
per ranks of Stanford's administra
tion, including a new provost, a
new bursar, a new public affairs
director for the Hoover Institution
and a new football coach. In New
Faces, a five-part series, The Daily
will profile these faces which will
soon grow familiar. Today:
Provost James Rosse.

Although the face may be
familiar to alumni and students
alike, the desk behind which the
man sits has changed. On the first
of this month. Economics Prof.
James Rosse, entering his 20th
year at Stanford, assumed the

position of University Provost.
Rosse, a past chairman of the
Economics Department and last
fall's head of the Reagan Library
Faculty Advisory Committee,
assumed the post long occupied by
Albert Hastorf. His appointment
in early May ended a seven-month
search by a committee of faculty
members and students chaired by
University President Donald Ken
nedy.
More than 350 names were
mentioned as possible candidates
for the job, and Rosse said that he
"wasn't aware" he was on the
committee's list until very late in
the decision making process.
According to Bob Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president, the official
title of Rosse's position is Univer
sity Vice President and Provost,
making him one of six vice presi
dents. Rosse is the "first among
equals" as a vice president, as he
serves as acting president when
Kennedy is away.
Rosse said he has a "close"
working relationship with Ken
nedy, noting that he was a member
of the committee that nominated
Kennedy for the position of Presi
dent five years ago. Today, the
two talk at least four or five times
a week to discuss University
operations.
He said the provost has three
areas of responsibility.
The provost is "one of the two
key officers of the University and
its chief academic officer," Rosse
said. When the president is in
capacitated, it is the provost who
fills his post as acting president for
that period, according to Rosse.
Rosse also serves as the "dean
of deans," because the heads of all

seven academic schools report di
rectly to his office. It is the
provost's responsibility to weigh
the wants and needs of the depart
ments while trying to "broaden
and deepen" the academic and re
search excellence of the Univer
sity.
Part of this effort includes de
signing and redesigning the Uni
versity's operating budget, the ap
pointment of all faculty and other
educational matters.
"It is a challenge to continue to
maintain the strong programs of
teaching and research," Rosse
said, adding that his new position
provides him with "a real opportu
nity to define an education, partic
ularly an undergraduate one, at a
research university."
Rosse said that Governor's Cor
ner is an "exciting example of new
ideas" in education at the Univer
sity. He is especially pleased with
"the social and intellectual life
that has begun to develop" at
Governor's Corner.
Something that Rosse described
as "a bother" is the present under
graduate housing situation. "We
don't take residences as seriously
as we should," Rosse said, noting
that a lack of housing forces a
draw, an attempt to be fair to all

students in where they live. The
new provost objects to studens
being "churned" through Univer
sity housing without settling in a
particular residence for more than
year, Rosse said, adding that stu
dents "shouldn't be forced to
move."
He noted that there has been "a
good deal of discussion" recently
on the prospect of building more
undergraduate housing.
President Kennedy and his
predecessor, Richard Lyman, both
served as the University's provost
before eventually becoming head
of the University. Rosse said that
the position of provost "can be,
but not always is" a stepping stone
to the office of president, adding
that it is "not a goal" for him to
become president.
Rosse, 52, was born in Sidney,
Nebraska, a town in the western
part of the state, and attended
high school in Omaha. He did his
undergraduate work at Princeton
and the University of Minnesota,
continuing with graduate studies
at the latter institution.
He came to the Farm because it
had "a good department
(economics) for a young assistant
to learn his trade." As Rosse has
worked his way up through the
ranks of the University, it has
become evident that Stanford was,
indeed, a good place for the af
fable man from the Midwest to ply
his trade.

said. When the president is in
capacitated, it is the provost who
fills his post as acting president for
that period, according to Rosse.

seven academic schools report di
rectly to his office. It is the
provost's responsibility to weigh
the wants and needs of the depart
ments while trying to "broaden
and deepen" the academic and re
search excellence of the Univer
sity.
Part of this effort includes de
signing and redesigning the Uni
versity's operating budget, the ap
pointment of all faculty and other
educational matters.
"It is a challenge to continue to
maintain the strong programs of
teaching and research," Rosse
said, adding that his new position
provides him with "a real opportu
nity to define an education, partic
ularly an undergraduate one, at a
research university."
Rosse said that Governor's Cor
ner is an "exciting example of new
ideas" in education at the Univer
sity. He is especially pleased with
"the social and intellectual life
that has begun to develop" at
Governor's Corner.
Something that Rosse described
as "a bother" is the present under
graduate housing situation. "We
don't take residences as seriously
as we should," Rosse said, noting
that a lack of housing forces a
draw, an attempt to be fair to all

students in where they live. The
new provost objects to studens
being "churned" through Univer
sity housing without settling in a
particular residence for more than
year, Rosse said, adding that stu
dents "shouldn't be forced to
move."
He noted that there has been "a
good deal of discussion" recently
on the prospect of building more
undergraduate housing.
President Kennedy and his
predecessor, Richard Lyman, both
served as the University's provost
before eventually becoming head
of the University. Rosse said that
the position of provost "can be,
but not always is" a stepping stone
to the office of president, adding
that it is "not a goal" for him to
become president.
Rosse, 52, was born in Sidney,
Nebraska, a town in the western
part of the state, and attended
high school in Omaha. He did his
undergraduate work at Princeton
and the University of Minnesota,
continuing with graduate studies
at the latter institution.
He came to the Farm because it
had "a good department
(economics) for a young assistant
to learn his trade." As Rosse has
worked his way up through the
ranks of the University, it has
become evident that Stanford was,
indeed, a good place for the af
fable man from the Midwest to ply
his trade.
