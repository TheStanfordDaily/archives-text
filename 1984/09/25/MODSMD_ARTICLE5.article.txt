# Students favor photo ID
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The announcement of the results of a survey on
the desirability of a laminated photo ID for stu
dents highlighted the summer business of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford University.
The ASSU Council of Presidents also eliminated
some of the confusion for student groups applying
for funding and received assurance from the Uni
versity that the ASSU-owned Coffee House will be
able to move into the Tresidder bowling alley in the
fall of 1986 despite the new LOTS Two computer
facility.
The results of the ASSU Photo ID Survey, con
ducted spring quarter, were released in late Au
gust. The survey, completed by 1,731 undergradu
ates, found nearly 75 percent of Stanford students
in favor of changing the present paper ID.
Of those who felt the need for a change, 98 per
cent favored adopting a photo ID until machine
readable cards were available, and almost 90 per
cent indicated their willingness to pay up to five
dollars for the ID.
Forty-six percent of those who did not feel the
need to replace the present paper ID also would be
willing to pay for a new system, the survey found.
The survey also solicited comments from stu
dents on the need for a change. One student com
plained: "Please don't give me any more damn bike
lanes; I want a photo ID. Every civilized college in
the country, but ours, has a decent ID."
Another bemoaned the encroachment of tech
nology. "As the world becomes more automated, I
guess it is only inevitable that a more efficient sys
tem of scholar identification be instituted, but nos
talgically it is sad. . .to see that we must be
computer-moded ... in every phase of our lives."
Also this summer, the COP succeeded in creat
ing a standard form for student groups applying for
funding from campus sources, according to COP
member Alice Wells.
Prior to now, "It's been such a decentralized
process that people have just kind of walked
around in a cloud," Wells said. Student groups
were not applying to the correct sources for funds
and had to complete a different application at each
different funding source.
The COP surveyed all the funding sources on
campus — from Residential Education toSWOPSI
— and composed a standard form for applying for
funds. Now groups can use one form, apply at the
Student Organizations Office and be directed to all
potential funding sources.

In addition, the ASSU received assurance from
the University that the Coffee House can be moved
into part of the former bowling alley in Tresidder in
the fall of 1986. The future of that move was put
into question last month when the University an
nounced that LOTS would be moving into the
bowling alley on a temporary basis.
A meeting of the ASSU Senate this Thursday in
the Law School will kick off the year for the student
government, but some events are already planned.
To help focus attention on a special campus elec
tion aimed at filling vacant graduate senate seats,
the ASSU is conducting a mock election for presi
dent of the United States. Ballots for the election,
tentatively scheduled for Oct. 30 and 31, will in
clude the five presidential candidates and may also
include the Ed Zschau-Martin Carnoy congres
sional race race and some referendum-type ques
tions on national politics.
In addition, a survey on the quality of life at

Stanford will be conducted by COP committees this
year.
The COP remains to initiate a broad-based sur
vey on student life on the Farm promised during
last spring's campaign for office. "This summer was
basically time for us to find out what's been done
before," Wells said.
She said she predicts the actual survey \&ill be un
derway by January or February, after student com
mittees have determined the specifics of the study.
The survey is likely to focus on Stanford's
academics, housing and social life.
In interviews with The Daily on the eve of the
spring senate election, prospective senators
stressed the need for the laminated ID cards, saying
the present paper version is subject to wear and
tear and is easily lost.
The senators also focused on establishing a
shuttle service to San Francisco, fostering commu
nication with faculty and administrators, and
making the ASSU more accessible to students.
