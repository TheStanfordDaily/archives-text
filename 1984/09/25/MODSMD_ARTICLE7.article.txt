Mondale calls for Soviet summit
IEXARK.ANA, TEX. — Democratic presidential candidate Wal
ter Mondale challenged President Reagan yesterday to arrange with So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko during their meeting Friday
for a tull-fledged U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in the near future.
Mondale also accused Reagan of allowing terrorists in the Middle East
to "humiliate us and push us around and kill our people."
Mondale's speech to a noontime rally in this town that straddles the
Texas-Arkansas border was by far his most strident personal attack on
Reagan. Mondale not only blamed the president for last week's terrorist
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, but also portrayed the incum
bent as a latecomer to the arms control cause.
"For four years, he talked like Curtis LeMay," Mondale said, refer
ring to the former Air Force general known for his militaristic views.
"This morning (at the United Nations) he tried to talk like Walter
Mondale."
Mondale, who has promised that he would hold annual summits with
Soviet leaders if elected president and has criticized Reagan for holding
no meeting with his Soviet counterpart, said that after four years of
waiting the American people would accept no less from the Reagan-
Gromyko meeting than the promise of a summit.
"On 112 riday, let's not hear about plans for Cabinet consultations," he
said. "That's been going on for years . . . Let's hear a plan for a summit."
In accusing Reagan of being a latecomer to the idea of U.S.-Soviet
consultations, Mondale praised Reagan's speech yesterday to the U.N.
General Assembly, in which the president called for arms control, but
then added: "The only problem is he should have been saying it six
weeks after he took office, and not six weeks before the election."
De Lorean conspirator sentenced
I.OS ANGELES — William Morgan Hetrick, the admitted drug
smuggler who was indicted with John De Lorean, was sentenced yester
day to 10 years in federal prison after prosecutors said he had
"cooperated handsomely" with the government.
U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi, who presided over De Lorean's
trial, imposed a series of concurrent sentences on charges that include
conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, cocaine possession with in
tent to distribute and income tax evasion.
The heaviest sentence was for the charge of conspiracy to possess and
distribute cocaine.
Takasugi also ordered Hetrick, 53, to serve five years of special parole
to be added to normal parole after he is released from prison.
The pudgy, bespectacled Hetrick stood silently before the judge in a
crowded courtroom and heard himself described by his attorney as "a
man who is broken" and by the prosecutor as "a man who may border
on genius."
De Lorean, the former automaker who produced the gull-winged
sports car bearing his name, was acquitted last month of charges of con
spiracy to distribute $24 million worth of cocaine.
Canker threatens orange crop
WINTER HAVEN, FLA. — Florida officials halted all citrus harvest
ing yesterday until each orange and grapefruit grove is re-checked and
certified free of deadly citrus canker, and also banned the movement of
fresh citrus fruit within the state.
State Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner urged growers to be
patient and cooperate with federal and state efforts to eradicate the bacterial
disease, which could seriously cripple or even kill the $2.5 billion-a-year
industry.
All previously issued permits for harvesting and shipping were nul
lified.
The only groves seriously affected by the new harvesting ban are those
producing early-season varieties for the fresh fruit markets. The start of
the state's main orange harvest is still weeks away.
How this will affect consumers is uncertain, but Conner told a press
conference it "will have a temporary inconvenience as far as supply and
price is concerned."
He emphasized that canker, which destroys the fruit and eventually
kills the tree, is not a human health hazard. Consumers should not be
concerned about drinking juice or eating Florida citrus products, he said.
U.S. envoy to meet with Israelis
JERUSALEM — Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy
arrived in Israel from Damascus yesterday and is scheduled to hold what
Israel radio described as possibly "crucial" talks this morning with Prime
Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Murphy's visit comes amid indications from both Syria and Israel that
they favor U.S. mediation in an effort to speed an Israeli withdrawal
from southern Lebanon.
Israel radio quoted an unidentified senior Israeli official last night as
saying that Murphy "may be bringing news that could mean the begin
ning of an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon within weeks."
However, U.S. Embassy spokesman Arthur Berger stressed that
"Murphy is not now engaged in any specific process of mediation."
Berger noted that Murphy, assistant secretary of state for Near Eas
tern and South Asian affairs, had been sent to the region to lead an in
vestigation into Thursday's bombing at the U.S. Embassy annex in
Beirut. "Since he was in the region anyway, they're taking advantage of
his presence for consultations in key capitals," Berger said.
Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in New York during the
weekend that, during meetings with Reagan administration officials, he
would ask that Washington become more involved in negotiations aimed
at ending the Lebanon occupation. Shamir is in New York for the 39th
session of the U.N. General Assembly.
100 arrested at Livermore protest

Volcano erupts in Philippines
MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Steam clouds in the shape of a giant
cauliflower spewed from Mayon volcano 200 miles southeast of here
yesterday and volcano experts said the danger of a major eruption had
increased.
Civil defense authorities said 45,000 Filipinos had fled Mayon's fiery
outbursts since they began anew at dawn Sunday. Relief agency officials
said they faced an urgent problem feeding and housing the refugees.
The Philippine Volcanology Institute said a large quantity of volcanic
material ejected from the mountain had accumulated on its upper
slopes, raising the threat from the streams of dangerous hot mud that
were pouring downhill.
Mud stopped vehicles using a highway near the town of Padang, the
agency reported from the scene. It predicted the eruption would con
tinue for "some time."
Monitoring equipment near the volcano was evacuated to safer
ground as the situation worsened. Visibility on the eastern side of the
volcano was "very poor" due to thick ashfalls, the Volcanology Institute
said. It advised residents to stay away from delineated danger zones.
The 8,000-feet Mayon had been relatively silent for a week after a
first eruption Sept. 12, then rumbled back to life at dawn Sunday, shoot
ing out columns of fire and ash-laden clouds. A high-danger zone was
extended from a five-mile radius to beyond six miles and 15 villages at
the base of the volcano were evacuated.
Wall Street quiet yesterday
NEW YORK — The stock market showed no clear trend yesterday as
investors kept an eye on the dollar in foreign exchange.
Auto issues were a bright spot in a generally quiet session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.32 to 1,205.06. But
most other, broader indicators recorded losses.

Canker threatens orange crop
WINTER HAVEN, FLA. — Florida officials halted all citrus harvest
ing yesterday until each orange and grapefruit grove is re-checked and
certified free of deadly citrus canker, and also banned the movement of
fresh citrus fruit within the state.
State Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner urged growers to be
patient and cooperate with federal and state efforts to eradicate the bacterial
disease, which could seriously cripple or even kill the $2.5 billion-a-year
industry.
All previously issued permits for harvesting and shipping were nul
lified.
The only groves seriously affected by the new harvesting ban are those
producing early-season varieties for the fresh fruit markets. The start of
the state's main orange harvest is still weeks away.
How this will affect consumers is uncertain, but Conner told a press
conference it "will have a temporary inconvenience as far as supply and
price is concerned."
He emphasized that canker, which destroys the fruit and eventually
kills the tree, is not a human health hazard. Consumers should not be
concerned about drinking juice or eating Florida citrus products, he said.
U.S. envoy to meet with Israelis
JERUSALEM — Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy
arrived in Israel from Damascus yesterday and is scheduled to hold what
Israel radio described as possibly "crucial" talks this morning with Prime
Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Murphy's visit comes amid indications from both Syria and Israel that
they favor U.S. mediation in an effort to speed an Israeli withdrawal
from southern Lebanon.
Israel radio quoted an unidentified senior Israeli official last night as
saying that Murphy "may be bringing news that could mean the begin
ning of an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon within weeks."
However, U.S. Embassy spokesman Arthur Berger stressed that
"Murphy is not now engaged in any specific process of mediation."
Berger noted that Murphy, assistant secretary of state for Near Eas
tern and South Asian affairs, had been sent to the region to lead an in
vestigation into Thursday's bombing at the U.S. Embassy annex in
Beirut. "Since he was in the region anyway, they're taking advantage of
his presence for consultations in key capitals," Berger said.
Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in New York during the
weekend that, during meetings with Reagan administration officials, he
would ask that Washington become more involved in negotiations aimed
at ending the Lebanon occupation. Shamir is in New York for the 39th
session of the U.N. General Assembly.

Volcano erupts in Philippines
MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Steam clouds in the shape of a giant
cauliflower spewed from Mayon volcano 200 miles southeast of here
yesterday and volcano experts said the danger of a major eruption had
increased.
Civil defense authorities said 45,000 Filipinos had fled Mayon's fiery
outbursts since they began anew at dawn Sunday. Relief agency officials
said they faced an urgent problem feeding and housing the refugees.
The Philippine Volcanology Institute said a large quantity of volcanic
material ejected from the mountain had accumulated on its upper
slopes, raising the threat from the streams of dangerous hot mud that
were pouring downhill.
Mud stopped vehicles using a highway near the town of Padang, the
agency reported from the scene. It predicted the eruption would con
tinue for "some time."
Monitoring equipment near the volcano was evacuated to safer
ground as the situation worsened. Visibility on the eastern side of the
volcano was "very poor" due to thick ashfalls, the Volcanology Institute
said. It advised residents to stay away from delineated danger zones.
The 8,000-feet Mayon had been relatively silent for a week after a
first eruption Sept. 12, then rumbled back to life at dawn Sunday, shoot
ing out columns of fire and ash-laden clouds. A high-danger zone was
extended from a five-mile radius to beyond six miles and 15 villages at
the base of the volcano were evacuated.

Mondale calls for Soviet summit
IEXARK.ANA, TEX. — Democratic presidential candidate Wal
ter Mondale challenged President Reagan yesterday to arrange with So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko during their meeting Friday
for a tull-fledged U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in the near future.
Mondale also accused Reagan of allowing terrorists in the Middle East
to "humiliate us and push us around and kill our people."
Mondale's speech to a noontime rally in this town that straddles the
Texas-Arkansas border was by far his most strident personal attack on
Reagan. Mondale not only blamed the president for last week's terrorist
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, but also portrayed the incum
bent as a latecomer to the arms control cause.
"For four years, he talked like Curtis LeMay," Mondale said, refer
ring to the former Air Force general known for his militaristic views.
"This morning (at the United Nations) he tried to talk like Walter
Mondale."
Mondale, who has promised that he would hold annual summits with
Soviet leaders if elected president and has criticized Reagan for holding
no meeting with his Soviet counterpart, said that after four years of
waiting the American people would accept no less from the Reagan-
Gromyko meeting than the promise of a summit.
"On 112 riday, let's not hear about plans for Cabinet consultations," he
said. "That's been going on for years . . . Let's hear a plan for a summit."
In accusing Reagan of being a latecomer to the idea of U.S.-Soviet
consultations, Mondale praised Reagan's speech yesterday to the U.N.
General Assembly, in which the president called for arms control, but
then added: "The only problem is he should have been saying it six
weeks after he took office, and not six weeks before the election."
De Lorean conspirator sentenced
I.OS ANGELES — William Morgan Hetrick, the admitted drug
smuggler who was indicted with John De Lorean, was sentenced yester
day to 10 years in federal prison after prosecutors said he had
"cooperated handsomely" with the government.
U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi, who presided over De Lorean's
trial, imposed a series of concurrent sentences on charges that include
conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, cocaine possession with in
tent to distribute and income tax evasion.
The heaviest sentence was for the charge of conspiracy to possess and
distribute cocaine.
Takasugi also ordered Hetrick, 53, to serve five years of special parole
to be added to normal parole after he is released from prison.
The pudgy, bespectacled Hetrick stood silently before the judge in a
crowded courtroom and heard himself described by his attorney as "a
man who is broken" and by the prosecutor as "a man who may border
on genius."
De Lorean, the former automaker who produced the gull-winged
sports car bearing his name, was acquitted last month of charges of con
spiracy to distribute $24 million worth of cocaine.
