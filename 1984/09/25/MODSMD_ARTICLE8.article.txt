# Reagan alters stance toward Soviets
## 
### 
NEW YORK — President Reagan's appearance
before the United Nations yesterday as the apostle
of East-West conciliation was an extraordinary turn
about for a lifelong anti-communist who previ
ously relegated the "focus of evil," as he once des
cribed the Soviet system, "to the ash heap of his
tory."
Peering at Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko, who sat stonefaced in the front row of
the General Assembly chamber, Reagan delivered
a lengthy plea for "a new beginning" in the affairs
of nations. The plea was more suggestive of the
start of a presidential term than its 11th hour.
The speech was popular with diplomats in the
hall, who always prefer cooperation to conflict
among the superpowers, and was calculated to
impress the American electorate, which has ex
pressed repeated concern via the nuclear freeze
movement and public-opinion polls that Reagan's
characteristic hard line against the Soviets could
bring the two superpowers to nuclear blows.
It is too early to say whether Kremlin leaders will
regard the speech as anything more than a political
ploy. More important, there is no hard evidence
about whether the Soviets will respond in kind,
whatever their view of Reagan's motivation.
In his first three years in office, Reagan took a
strikingly tough posture toward the Soviets, in
policy and rhetoric, as he presided over the biggest
peacetime military buildup in U.S. history.

Jan. 16, as the new year dawned and
memories faded of the Soviet downing of the
Korean Air Lines jet four months earlier, Reagan
shifted toward a more conciliatory stance.
His East Room address that day addressed to
"Ivan and Anva" and their leaders in Moscow
called for improved relations. But the president
also bluntly condemned Soviet exploitation of
regional problems, the "outright Soviet invasion"
of Afghanistan, Soviet human rights practices and
"mounting evidence" of arms-agreement viola
tions.
Yesterday Reagan advanced a full-scale appeal
for good relations, complete with suggestions for
regular high-level meetings and a new "umbrella"
framework to shield arms-control negotiators from
individual storms.
And this time, unlike other such statements this
year, the Reagan eagle carried no sharp arrows for
the Soviets to balance against the olive branch in
the other talon. Yesterday, mention ot Soviet per
fidy in Afghanistan, Cambodia, human rights
abuses, yellow rain and arms violations gave way to
talk of "tiie moral obligation to try and try again"
for good relations and to quotations from Mahatma
Gandhi and Ignatius Loyola.
Hardly anyone, least of all the wary and hard
bitten Soviets, suggested that Reagan's appeal was
the true abandonment of his anti-communist policy
and posture. Asked about the notable omissions

from the address. Secretary of State George
Shultz said Reagan has not changed his views on
questions of substance but concentrated yesterday
on nutting forward -'an invitation to the Soviet
Union" to work constructively with the United
States "based on a realistic appraisal of what is
going on in the world.
Gromyko's response to the Reagan peace offen
sive is likely to unfold slowly this week as he sees
senior European and Asian diplomats today, meets
Shultz in a full diplomatic review tomorrow, con
fers with Democratic presidential candidate Walter
Mondale Thursday and goes to the White House
Friday to say and hear more in a private meeting
with Reagan.
U.S. officials concede uncertainty about how the
veteran Soviet diplomat will respond, but the best
guess among Soviet affairs experts is that, more
than anything. Gromyko will listen, at least in
private.
The officials thought it significant that Gromyko
postponed his U.N. speech, his major public ut
terance this week, from today until Thursday,
which gives him much more time to consider his re
action.
••My hunch is that the Soviets have entered a
period of rethinking their position and exploring
possible shifts and that Gromyko is doing that
here." said an American who was recently in Mos
cow.
