# Lockheed profits to double on plane
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Lockheed
Corp. will make "nearly twice" the
profit the government intended on
the first five of 50 modernized C-5
transport planes to be bought under
one of President Reagan's most con
troversial procurement decisions, the
Air Force auditor general has con
cluded.
In a memorandum obtained by The
Washington Post, Auditor General
Jerome Stolarow said Lockheed
could make almost $500 million more
than intended on the rest of the
planes unless the Pentagon can lower
prices written into pending contract
options.
The C-5 findings are the latest in a
string of procurement embarrass
ments for the Pentagon, whose rising
budget has brought increasing com
plaints in this election vear about
loose contracting practices, excessive

costs and shoddy products.
Gen. Lawrence Skantze, com
mander of the Air Force Systems
Command, which oversees major
procurement programs, said "we will
not pay other than a fair and
reasonable price" for the remaining
45 planes. The problem is with
Lockheed's cost estimates. Skantze
said Air Force contracting officers
started to review these in May and
will continue until the questions
about reasonableness are answered.
Lockheed spokesman Everett
Hayes said the company is willing to
re-examine the contracts in light of
changed conditions. He said
Lockheed is negotiating with the Air
Force, but production has not ad
vanced enough to draw definite con
clusions about profits.
"As usual, leaked documents that
are intended for internal use tend to

solidify matters that are in a state of
discussion or negotiation," Hayes
said. "The first airplane is only now
beginning to take shape in our assem
bly building here. ... I feel absolutely
confident there won't be any windfall
profit."
President Reagan in 1982 rejected
Army, Air Force and Marine leaders'
recommendations to buy McDonnell
Douglas C-17 transports, and opted
instead to buy a new fleet of C-ss.
The C-5 has been a source of con
troversy for more than 20 years. The
original versions experienced cost
overruns of about $2 billion, and
their wings had to be replaced. But
key congressional committee mem
bers from Georgia, Lockheed's home
state, have stoutly defended the cargo
craft.
"For the five C-5B aircraft cur
rently on contract," said Stolarow,

"the contractor is projecting a profit
of 29 percent, nearly twice the 15
percent profit rate negotiated at the
time of contract award" last Dec. 31.
Except for inflation adjustments,
prices on those planes are essentially
locked in.
Beyond the current order of five C
-sBs, Stolarow wrote: "We estimate
the 'excess profit will amount to
$162 million for the fiscal year 1985
option and $315 million for the 1986
and 1987 options," or a total of $477
million on top of whatever profit the
Georgia company makes on the sale
of the first five transports.
"Exercising the contract option for
the fiscal year 1985 buy of 10 C-5B
aircraft may not he advisable" on the
scheduled date of Nov. 30,
Stolarow wrote, because a complete
audit of the company's costs will not
be completed by then.
