Some of you
DON'T have a
deadline today
Sample columns for those
interested in being regular biweekly
columnists are due Monday, Oct. 1
at 5 p.m. Come in sooner if you
have it done and talk to an
Opinions editor. We have a fun,
short application you need to fill
out. Don't forget that columns and
letters for the Opinions page must
be typed double-spaced on a 57-
character line.
