the Recreation Center...
I*l
Even though the bowling lanes are gone*, there is still a lot
of recreation left at the Recreation Center. The Recreation
Center still offers: a Games Room with foosball tables,
billiards, pinball machines, and thirty-five of the best video
games; bicycle registration and repair, racquet rental and
games tournaments. SOAR (Stanford Outdoor Adventures
and Recreation) is still housed there, too.
"The bowling lanes have been replaced by the LOTS TWO Computer
Cluster.
