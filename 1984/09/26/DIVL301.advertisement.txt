The Coffee House is back to square one! We've
changed the service system back to the simpler system
used two years ago. As a result it's quick and easy to
get great food and beverages at the Coffee House. So,
if you are new on campus come try out the Coffee
House. Or if you're an old timer come and relive the old
Coffee House.
