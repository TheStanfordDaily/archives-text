# Hong Kong to return to China in 1997
## 
### 
PEKING China and Britain will initial a historic
agreement today paving the way for the return of Hong
Kong, the trading and financial center of East Asia, to
Chinese rule in 1997.
Under the agreement, China will regain sovereignty
over Hong Kong, which has been a British crown colony
for more than 140 years, when Britain's lease on most of
Hong Kong's territory expires.
In exchange, China has promised that Hong Kong may
maintain its capitalist economic system, its status as a free
port, its separate currency, its legal system and many of its
civil liberties for 50 years after 1997. Hong Kong will
become what will be called a special administrative region
within China.
The British ambassador to China, Sir Richard Evans,
and Zhou Nan, Chinese assistant foreign minister, the
heads of the negotiating teams for the two nations, will in
itial the accord in a brief ceremony here at the Great Hall
of the People.

The text of the agreement will be made public later
today and will show for the first time the full extent to
which China's Communist government has guaranteed
that the 5.4 million residents of Hong Kong will be
allowed to retain their freedoms after 1997.
The initialing of the agreement is not the last step in the
process. The accord must still be approved by the British
Parliament and then signed by leaders of the two govern
ments.
The British have set up an office in Hong Kong to
sample public opinion concerning the agreement and for
ward it to London. However, the survey of Hong Kong re
action, which will take about two months, is not expected
to affect the British decision to return the colony to China.
Under current planning, the agreement could be ap
proved by Parliament and signed by early next year.
Technically, the Sino-British accord on Hong Kong is
called a "joint declaration" rather than a treaty. China has
steadfastly maintained that the treaties under which the

British took control of Hong Kong in the 19th century are
invalid and that therefore no new treaty is required for
China to regain control.
British rule in Hong Kong dates back to the Treaty of
Nanking, ratified in 1842 after the first Opium War be
tween Britain and China. Under that treaty, China ceded
the island of Hong Kong to Britain "in perpetuity." In
1860, under the Treaty of Peking, China also gave Britain
the Kowloon peninsula, on the Chinese mainland oppo
site Hong Kong island, also in perpetuity.
Finally, Britain obtained the so-called New Territories
— the largest portion of the present-day crown colony of
Hong Kong — in 1898. This area, which makes up ap
proximately 90 percent of the surface area of the colony,
was not given outright to Britain but instead was turned
over under a rent-free 99-year lease, expiring on June 30,
1997.
According to records of the British Colonial Office,
Britain decided to lease the New Territories, rather than

to seize them outright, because Germany and Russia had
just obtained leases on parcels of land in northern China.
Britain did not want to be accused of trying to out do them
and thus of spurring further competition among the im
perialist powers to further carve up China.
In this century, Chinese governments, both Nationalist
and Communist, have claimed that these 19th-century
treaties were "unequal" — that is, negotiated under cir
cumstances in which China was militarily weak and in no
position to bargain.
Under the new agreement, China will regain
sovereignty in 1997 not only over the leased New Ter
ritories, but also over Hong Kong island and Kowloon,
the sections of the colony that were given to Britain out
right.
Underlying the two years of negotiations over Hong
Kong was the military reality that Britain is now in no po
sition to defend Hong Kong if China, which has the
world's largest army, decided to seize the colony.
