# Amnesty International attacks Chinese

### 
LONDON — Amnesty International said
today that China is holding thousands of poli
tical prisoners in jails and labor "re
education'' camps and has executed
thousands of other Chinese in a 13-month-old
anti-crime campaign.
In its first major report on Communist
China since 1978, the London-based human
rights group said tens of thousands of people
were arrested and thousands of others were

executed in the first three months of the anti
crime drive.
The 132-page report said that since 1981,
China had nearly doubled — to 44 — the
number of crimes punishable by execution.
Amnesty said it submitted the report —
along with appeals for fair trials, an end to the
death penalty and release of political
prisoners — to the Chinese government at the
beginning of this year but received no reply.

Amnesty, winner of the 1977 Nobel Peace
Prize, identified 24 individual Chinese, in
cluding 10 Roman Catholic priests, whom it
has adopted as "prisoners of conscience." It
said these were a small fraction of the total
number of political prisoners held.
Amnesty spokesman David Laulicht told
The Associated Press the 24 were people
about whom Amnesty had "enough informa
tion to be quite sure they were imprisoned

only for exercising a basic human right such as
speaking their minds or writing something."
He said prisoners of conscience are people
who have neither used nor advocated vio
lence, and that Amnesty works to secure their
release.
The report said some of the prisoners have
reportedly been held in solitary confinement

for weeks or months, sometimes manacled.
It said Amnesty International was not able
to estimate the total number of people ar
rested or executed since Chinese authorities
launched a nationwide campaign against
crime in August 1983, but added: "During
the first three months of the campaign, tens of
thousands of arrests and several thousand ex
ecutions are believed to have been carried
out.
