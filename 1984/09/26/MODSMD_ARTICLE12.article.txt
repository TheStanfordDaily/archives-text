## THE
						STANFORD DAILY Too little, too late 
### 
A second term notwithstanding, Ronald
Reagan will become the first president since the
inception of the nuclear age not to sign a major
arms control agreement. This Friday, when he
meets Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko,
Reagan will barely escape being designated the
first president since Herbert Hoover not to meet
with a high-ranking Soviet official.
The same president who stamped the Soviet
Union the focus of all evil in the modern world
said recently, "The United States wants nothing
less than a realistic, constructive, long-term rela
tionship with the Soviet Union in order to reduce
nuclear weapons."
Five weeks before the presidential election is
not the time to begin an effort to re-establish reg
ular, high-level U.S.-Soviet relations. The fact
that there have been three Soviet leaders since
Reagan took office does not justify an unprece
dented curtailment of essential negotiations; for
years, Gromyko, and not the premier, has been
recognized as the leading Soviet foreign policy
architect. Reagan's effort is pathetic in that it
comes so late in his presidency and meaningless
in that it will involve little of substantive value.
Vice President George Bush admitted, "I'm
not expecting the world to come out of [the
meeting]." The Gromyko engagement is a cam

paign orchestration designed to neutralize
Reagan's glaring weak points in foreign policy as
perceived by many voters.
Mondale's motives for securing a meeting with
Gromyko during his election campaign are also
purely political. The scheduling of the Mondale-
Gromyko meeting one day before the Reagan-
Gromyko encounter reeks of political upstaging.
Mondale also will be unable to accomplish little
of any significant value. He realizes he is meeting
Gromyko as a private citizen with no power or
right to negotiate as an elected representative.
Mondale must be given credit, on the other
hand, for having met with Gromyko three times
previously â€” twice as vice president and once as
a senator. Though Reagan has not met a single
Soviet leader in almost four years in the White
House, he did attend a barbecue at President
Nixon's home in 1973 where Gromyko was pres
ent.
Mondale has promised, in his first day in office,
to invite the Soviet leadership to a summit in or
der to negotiate arms control agreements.
If Reagan is re-elected we can only hope that
his current conciliatory rhetoric, showing a com
mitment to arms control negotiations and regular
U.S.-Soviet dialogue, foreshadows a new begin
ning in his approach to the Soviets.
