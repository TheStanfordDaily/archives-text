## The 						Moonies: impression vs. reality 
### 
Unlike most religions, the Unifica
tion Church tries to avoid telling
prospective members what it really
believes.
This is probably a wise policy, if not
an honest one. Many people react to
the secret Moon doctrines, if they
hear them unprepared, by bursting
out laughing. To avoid this problem,
the Moonies spend days, weeks or
months diverting a prospective
recruit with side issues. Meanwhile,

VIEWPOINT

they probe for the person's weak
points and try to work him into a state
of emotional confusion and accep
tance through a slowly escalating
overload of friendship, emotion,
pressure and guilt.
To save trouble for those who
would like to know what Moonism
actually is, but don't want to go
through dozens of hours of retreats
and lectures in which the real stuff is
always promised "very soon," here it
is straight. These are the central
beliefs that drive every Moonie.

God created the first humans,
Adam and Eve, 6,000 years ago. As
perfect creations, they were supposed
to populate the world with perfect
people. But Satan, who had been ex
pelled from Heaven for having sexual
intercourse with an angel, had sex
with Eve first. Hence, all humans
today have Satan's blood in their an
cestry, and so are prone to discord,
strife and disobedience.
God wanted to start over with an
other perfect couple, but complex
laws of numerology restrict what God
can do. Thus, he had to wait 4,000
years before he could send the
"Second Adam," Jesus. As the
second perfect man, Jesus was
supposed to take a holy wife at age 40
(a holy number) and begin fathering
the perfect race, which would reclaim
the world from the fallen. But the
Jews — people who believed only in
the First Adam — killed Jesus at age

33, before he could carry out God's
plan. Jesus was a failure, the
crucifixion was a meaningless mur
der, and Jews are still paying
"indemnity" as divine retribution for
their crime, such as through their per
secution under Hitler.
God could not send a "Third
Adam" for 2,000 more years, but
that time has finally arrived. The
Third Adam is Sun Myung Moon.
Moon was informed of his status

directly by God. He is destined to
succeed where the first two Adams
failed, since God's work happens in
threes, another holy number. Moon
married at age 40 on schedule, and
has already fathered over a dozen
perfect children. These are the core
of the perfect race that will restore

humanity to the Garden of Eden.
Other people can become Moon's
"spiritual" children by following him
as the Messiah, and eventually they
can become his "physical" children as
well by undergoing the ceremony of
pikarume, or blood cleansing. At this
time Moon removes the lineage of
Satan from a person and places him
self in the corresponding position of
ancestry. This explains his title in the
church as the "One True Parent."
Just as Jews clung to an obsolete
religion after the arrival of Jesus, so
do Christians today cling to an ob
solete belief in the Second Adam.
The Old Testament of Judaism and
the New Testament of Christianity

have been superseded by the Com
pleted Testament, Moon's own
Divine Principle. This work describes
at length why the Third Adam must
be born in Korea around the year
1920 (Moon's year of birth) and must
have a life that parallels Moon's in
most details. This great revelation
that the Messiah is Moon is what the
Unification Church's lectures and
retreats slowly work up to, inch by
inch.
The reason people cannot be told
these facts immediately is because
they have Satan's lineage. Satan con
trols our minds — and he is
desperately focusing his energies
toward thwarting the Unification
Church because only the Unification
Church knows the truth about him.
Furthermore, since Satan lied to Eve
when he caused the fall of mankind,
God's forces must lie in winning

mankind back; this is required by
Moon's "law of indemnity" (spelled
out in detail in the Divine Principle),
a sort of cosmic rule of balance and
repayment. This is why Moonies can
constantly lie so sincerely and shame
lessly to outsiders: their theology says
they must.
Today, Satan's manifestation on
the worldwide level is Communism.
In fact the Communist system, as
Moon perceives it, is nothing other
than Satan's imitation of the Unifica
tion Church! The difference is that
the Moonies are God-centered — but
the internal administration and exter
nal tactics are similar. Satan had to
copy God's system in setting up his

own system because Satan can only
imitate, not create; this is one of his
basic characteristics.
On the individual level, Satan
directs intense onslaughts against
each Moonie and possible future
Moonie. He tries to strike at a per
son's weakest place, which is usually
his or her loved ones. This is why par
ents, girlfriends, and boyfriends inex
plicably become hysterical when you
tell them you are at a Moonie retreat
and won't be coming back for a while.
Such violent reactions are proof that
Satan's voice is speaking through
their mouths, since Satan's essential
characteristics are anger, discord,
negativity and an unwillingness to lis
ten.
God's characteristics are harmony,
"positivity," love, acceptance and
obedience. A Moonie must hold
these feelings in mind at every mo
ment, most especially when dealing
with superiors in the hierarchy. Even
a momentary intrusion of doubt or
negativity is Satan gaining a foothold,
and must instantly be stamped out of
thought. Vigorous mental exercises
drill this habit into good members un
til it becomes almost effortless.
Those who accept God and the
Messiah must eventually make a total
commitment to the Unification
Church's battle plan for wiping out
Satan worldwide and restoring the
Garden of Eden. In the war between
absolute good and absolute evil, the
very idea of half-measures is a trap
planted by Satan. As soon as you are
"positive" enough to be told this, you
must give all of your money, and
every bit of your time and energy, to
the cause of Sun Myung Moon. The
universe has never contained any
thing more important.
So there it is. Any takers?

the Moonies are God-centered — but
the internal administration and exter

copy God's system in setting up his

own system because Satan can only
imitate, not create; this is one of his
basic characteristics.
On the individual level, Satan
directs intense onslaughts against
each Moonie and possible future
Moonie. He tries to strike at a per
son's weakest place, which is usually
his or her loved ones. This is why par

tell them you are at a Moonie retreat

Such violent reactions are proof that
Satan's voice is speaking through
their mouths, since Satan's essential
characteristics are anger, discord,
negativity and an unwillingness to lis
ten.
God's characteristics are harmony,
"positivity," love, acceptance and
obedience. A Moonie must hold
these feelings in mind at every mo
ment, most especially when dealing
with superiors in the hierarchy. Even
a momentary intrusion of doubt or
negativity is Satan gaining a foothold,
and must instantly be stamped out of
thought. Vigorous mental exercises
drill this habit into good members un

Those who accept God and the
Messiah must eventually make a total
commitment to the Unification
Church's battle plan for wiping out
Satan worldwide and restoring the
Garden of Eden. In the war between
absolute good and absolute evil, the

planted by Satan. As soon as you are
"positive" enough to be told this, you
must give all of your money, and
every bit of your time and energy, to
the cause of Sun Myung Moon. The
universe has never contained any
thing more important.

This is probably a wise policy, if not
an honest one. Many people react to
the secret Moon doctrines, if they

out laughing. To avoid this problem,
the Moonies spend days, weeks or
months diverting a prospective

God created the first humans,
Adam and Eve, 6,000 years ago. As
perfect creations, they were supposed
to populate the world with perfect
people. But Satan, who had been ex
pelled from Heaven for having sexual
intercourse with an angel, had sex
with Eve first. Hence, all humans
today have Satan's blood in their an
cestry, and so are prone to discord,
strife and disobedience.
God wanted to start over with an
other perfect couple, but complex
laws of numerology restrict what God
can do. Thus, he had to wait 4,000
years before he could send the
"Second Adam," Jesus. As the
second perfect man, Jesus was
supposed to take a holy wife at age 40
(a holy number) and begin fathering
the perfect race, which would reclaim
the world from the fallen. But the
Jews — people who believed only in
the First Adam — killed Jesus at age

33, before he could carry out God's
plan. Jesus was a failure, the
crucifixion was a meaningless mur
der, and Jews are still paying
"indemnity" as divine retribution for
their crime, such as through their per
secution under Hitler.
God could not send a "Third
Adam" for 2,000 more years, but
that time has finally arrived. The
Third Adam is Sun Myung Moon.
Moon was informed of his status

directly by God. He is destined to
succeed where the first two Adams
failed, since God's work happens in
threes, another holy number. Moon
married at age 40 on schedule, and
has already fathered over a dozen
perfect children. These are the core
of the perfect race that will restore

humanity to the Garden of Eden.
Other people can become Moon's
"spiritual" children by following him
as the Messiah, and eventually they
can become his "physical" children as
well by undergoing the ceremony of
pikarume, or blood cleansing. At this
time Moon removes the lineage of
Satan from a person and places him
self in the corresponding position of
ancestry. This explains his title in the
church as the "One True Parent."
Just as Jews clung to an obsolete
religion after the arrival of Jesus, so
do Christians today cling to an ob
solete belief in the Second Adam.
The Old Testament of Judaism and
the New Testament of Christianity

have been superseded by the Com
pleted Testament, Moon's own
Divine Principle. This work describes
at length why the Third Adam must
be born in Korea around the year
1920 (Moon's year of birth) and must
have a life that parallels Moon's in
most details. This great revelation
that the Messiah is Moon is what the
Unification Church's lectures and
retreats slowly work up to, inch by
inch.
The reason people cannot be told
these facts immediately is because
they have Satan's lineage. Satan con
trols our minds — and he is
desperately focusing his energies
toward thwarting the Unification
Church because only the Unification
Church knows the truth about him.
Furthermore, since Satan lied to Eve
when he caused the fall of mankind,
God's forces must lie in winning

mankind back; this is required by
Moon's "law of indemnity" (spelled
out in detail in the Divine Principle),
a sort of cosmic rule of balance and
repayment. This is why Moonies can
constantly lie so sincerely and shame
lessly to outsiders: their theology says
they must.
Today, Satan's manifestation on
the worldwide level is Communism.
In fact the Communist system, as
Moon perceives it, is nothing other
than Satan's imitation of the Unifica
tion Church! The difference is that
the Moonies are God-centered — but
the internal administration and exter
nal tactics are similar. Satan had to
