## USW explains 
### 
I am writing this letter to try to
bring some clarity to the United
Stanford Workers (USW) recogni
tion issue. Some of the news has
been lengthy and technical. I believe,
however, that there are a couple of
facts which make the situation clear.
1. On June 6, 1984, the National
Labor Relations Board issued a
complaint against the Stanford ad
ministration for Stanford's refusal to
recognize USW. In that complaint,
the NLRB said that USW was the
exclusive collective bargaining agent
for Stanford's technical, maintenance
and service workers. The NLRB also
upheld the internal election held by
USW last spring in which workers
voted 632 to 125 to have USW
represent them. Finally, in its com
plaint, the NLRB stated it would
begin prosecution of the administra
tion before an administrative law
judge on Sept. 17.
2. The NLRB has not upheld any
of the charges filed by the Stanford
administration against USW.
Somehow, these two salient facts
have been omitted from the adminis
tration's "information" to the com
munity.
Thus, the NLRB has ruled consis
tently in favor of USW. nevertheless
we in USW were faced with a Stan
ford administration who said it
would appeal the results to an NLRB
prosecution. The administration's
strategy was clear. The lengthy legal
appeal procedure could delay USWs

recognition for years. Meanwhile, we
would be without a contract.
USWs strategy, in turn, was to
build community support in order to
put pressure on the administration to
settle the recognition issue quickly.
A settlement was won on the eve
of the NLRB's prosecution of the
Stanford administration. In that
settlement it was agreed that a stip
ulated election would be held to
bring a quick resolution to the
dispute. A regular NLRB election
could have also involved a lengthy
appeals process. A stipulated elec
tion, however, means that Stanford
agrees to sign the union contract
with USW upon its certification of
the election by the NLRB.
We want to thank the faculty, the
Student Labor Support Committee,
students and local clergy for their
support in winning that settlement.
We in USW are part of the com
munity. We are proud that through
our union we have won basic
benefits, not only for USW mem
bers, but for everyone who works at
Stanford. The dental plan, better
medical care and an improved pen
sion are only some of the benefits won
by USW and extended to much of
the community.
We continue to value and appreci
ate the community support as we
head into the Oct. 30 stipulated
election. On that day USW members
will once again have to show their
resolve to have the right to union
representation and a union contract.

President, United Stanford Workers
