# Council eyes smoking zones
## Two plans to be considered 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Staff writer 
Although Stanford's existing
smoking rules appear as lenient as
those at other universities, the situa
tion may change shortly.
The University's Administrative
Council is currently studying two
proposals: One would limit smoking
in all buildings except in specified
areas (the San Diego model); the
other would allow smoking in every
area not designated as smoke-free
(the San Francisco model).
A final decision should be made in
approximately four to six weeks, ac
cording to Marlene Wine, special as
sistant to University President
Donald Kennedy. Stanford currently
has no official policy.
Dr. John Farquhar, director of the
Stanford Heart Disease Prevention
Program, said there is a "very strong
health motivation" behind the draft
ing of the new rules.
The new policy will not affect a
majority of students here.
Wine said that only 6 percent of
Stanford students smoke, and that
figure includes those who smoke as
little as one cigarette per month.
The new smoking rules at Stanford
are intended to "cause people to
become alert," Farquhar said.
Officials at the Stanford Medical
Center and Hospital have already
complied with a recent Palo Alto city
ordinance concerning designated
smoking areas; the University is
leaning in that direction.
Other universities do not seem to
have any stringent policies prohibit
ing smoking.

At the University of California at
Berkeley, smoking is permitted in in
dividual dorm rooms, as it is at Stan
ford, said Allen Matthews, university
editor of the Daily Californian. In
Berkeley's lounges, certain areas are
designated as non-smoking, but only
one eating spot has a non-smoking
section.
Matthews said the majority of
Daily Californian staff members
smoke, but said he doubted that his
co-workers were representative of
the entire campus.
Joel Jollife, a housing representa
tive at the University of Southern
California, said housing managers
there attempt to put smokers to
gether in the same location. Smoking
is permitted in lounges there, but not
in classrooms.
At San Jose State, students are
allowed to smoke everywhere except
libraries, according to Spartan Daily
editor Mark Freeman. "We don't
have any campus smoking policies,"
he said.
Dave Yermack and Mary Humes,
managing editors of the Harvard
Crimson, said Harvard has no
smoking policies. "There aren't any
obvious ones anyway," Yermack
said.
"Anyone can smoke, and you can
smoke in your rooms," Humes said.
The managing editor explained that
individual houses may vote on
smoking rules at dinner time. She also
mentioned that it would be ironic to
prohibit smoking in students' rooms
because many of them have
fireplaces.
