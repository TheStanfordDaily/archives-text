## The 						Band takes its show on the road 
### JULIE RYAN Daily staff 
When the incomparable I.eland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band takes a road trip, it's more com
plicated than loading the brass and
beer into the bus and heading down
the road. In fact, it took several
months this summer for the masters
of mass-scale disorganized marching
to organize the $40,000 cross-country
trek to Oklahoma this month.
Band members say the trip was a
blaring success, though where the
Band goes some controversy almost
always follows. One hundred Band
members and the Dollies performed
in three states and as usual it was sort
of a love-hate relationship between
the Band and its audience.

The preseason trip originally
stirred up controversy in May
during fee assessment voting when
some questioned the use of student
funds for a trip that takes place
before the school year even begins.
Band Manager Scott Gode said that
"it was largely the graduate student
population who wondered how we
could justify paying for the Band to
go out and essentially have fun. But
we do it with the initial purpose in
mind to go out and support the
team."
Band members are currently
recovering from the strain of an in
tense schedule of playing, traveling
and partying. "Today peoples' lips
still hurt from playing," said the in
famous Drum Major Jim Kohn,
most easily recognized in his pink
tutu. "It was a face-breaking trip."

The Band rallied at Stanford Sun
day night. Sept. 2, and left to catch a
midnight flight. Longtime Stanford
rumor has it that the Band has been
forbidden on many airlines. "That's
not really true," said Kohn. "We just
take the cheapest airline."
But the rumor does in fact have
some substance. One band alum (the
Band calls them old farts) the Band
met on this trip was part of the group
that jumped all at once from one side
of a plane to the other in an attempt
to wreak havoc with the plane's in
struments. Apparently it worked and
is the primary source of the Band's
bad image with the airlines.
"This trip we just held up our seat
belts along with the stewardess and
went along with the safety routine,"

said Kohn. "But that's pretty old
stuff."
Old stuff or not, it did prompt at
least one fellow airline rider to write a
letter of complaint to University
President Donald Kennedy.
In a March Daily interview, Kohn
said, "We don't get any hate mail
. . . . We don't want everyone to love
us and it's getting dangerously close,"
but the angered Continental Airlines
apparently helped alleviate this prob
lem.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to
Kennedy said, "the president
received one letter from the pas
senger whose trip was ruined because
the Band was so obnoxious. Here we
know the Band and we're very
tolerant. Most people like the Band,
but when they're on the road it's dif
ferent. Their behavior is sometimes
less humorous to people."

The letter said that Band members
"made too much work for the flight
crew and made everyone over 22
miserable for the whole trip with their
shouting back and forth and swapping
seats." The letter ended, "1 made up
my mind to join the PRO
ABORTION League and to vote for
President Reagan so he can send
them down to Central America to
have live ammunition shot at them.
Please tell the children to act better in
public and to represent the school as
a courteous individual instead of the
mob of JERKS that they appeared to
be Sunday."
The first performance after the un
solicited airplane show was at a Labor
Day parade in New Orleans at the
World's Fair and was more popular.
"It was kind of interesting," ex
plained Kohn. "The Band doesn't
really march so it was the very first

time many of us had moved while wo
played. But it went all right."
The Band played an introduction
to Vice President George Bush, who
was also there. "We played 'She's not
There' because his Democratic coun
terpoint was not there," said Kohn.
The Band never actually saw Bush
Assistant Manager Jeff Stevens said.
"We could have stayed if we wanted
to see him."
Next the Band played at Tulane
University. "They loved us. You
wouldn't believe how they loved us,"
Kohn said. "People had never seen
anything like us. No one there knew
who we were and some of the fresh
men thought we were the Tulane
Band."
The Band also played at Jackson
Park outside the French Quarter until
they were let loose into one of the
country's most decadent neighbor
hoods. "People were going crazy with
all the signs there," Kohn said. "One*
like Our women are men' in front of
female impersonator bars. But

the, e. too hard to get because there
-.ire ; ople around all night."
S „e of the signs that were ap
par< ilv less guarded are now on dis
play t the Bandshak. A 'Barry Swit

't'xpj ned that the Oklahoma head

"iey mell funny things happening
Hiey imetimes have to think what to
t'since there was a caravan the

second and third buses really couldn't
pull over."
The Band recieved a huge dose of
ego building when they played for
Norman High School in Oklahoma.
The Band's three school buses were
given a police escort through the
streets and the Band performed a
tribute to square household appli
ances, "our four-cornered household
friends" explained Stevens,"like the
TV, radio, and toaster." The Band
claims the only people who didn't
love them at the high school were
members of the away team's band
who were forced to play after the
game to give the Stanford Band more
time at halftime.
"The crowd just loved us in Okla
homa" Kohn said. "They were rock
ing out."
Kohn explained that the Oklahoma

crowd is very conservative.
"Everyone there wears their Reagan
T-shirt. That's why I wore my pink
tutu. I decided to be kind of oppo
site."

'Everyone wears their Reagan t-shirt.
That's why I wore my pink tutu. I
decided to be kind of opposite.'
— Drum Major Jim Kohn

At one point in the show the Stan
ford announcer said, "Reagan for
four more years." Kohn said the
crowd was cheering because they

didn't realize that the team had
formed the words "Mo" and "Ron"
on the field. A tribute was made to
Vanessa Williams while the letters
VW were formed . These letters then

rearranged themselves to create the
female anatomy on the field. "The
conservative Oklahoma crowd "was
shocked and they were appalled"

Cline said.
But the Oklahoma band and the
Stanford Band hit it off. Kohn said
that after the game the Oklahoma
band played for 15 minutes before
"people in their band came and
played with us."
Cline explained one reason the
Band liked Oklahoma. "While we
were there a bill was up which would
allow people to buy liquor by the the
glass. Before that you couldn't do it.
The bill passed. TTie Band was very
impressed by that."
Some controversy and tension were
stirred up in Oklahoma due to a press
statement released before the game
which Athletic Department officials
interpreted as unsupportive of the
football team.
"There was one line that shouldn't
have been written by us" Gode said.

"A lot of players read that and felt
the Band wasn't behind them. But
that isn't true. We're students too,
and we want to see the team win as
much as anybody else."
According to Kohn the release
said, "We're all growing long beards
waiting for the team to win." Kohn
was disappointed that some players
and officials felt that this implied that
the Band enjoys football team losses.
"The recent victories were great.
After the game the Band played out
to the team. It psyched people up and
psyched us up, too."
"The Band has talked to the Ath
letic Department about ways to get
the fans more spirited and cheering.
We're going to do things like chicken
[bass drum pounding!' and looking
for ways to help the football team,"
Gode said.

The Band played an introduction
to Vice President George Bush, who
was also there. "We played 'She's not
There' because his Democratic coun
terpoint was not there," said Kohn.
The Band never actually saw Bush
Assistant Manager Jeff Stevens said.
"We could have stayed if we wanted
to see him."
Next the Band played at Tulane
University. "They loved us. You
wouldn't believe how they loved us,"
Kohn said. "People had never seen
anything like us. No one there knew
who we were and some of the fresh
men thought we were the Tulane
Band."
The Band also played at Jackson
Park outside the French Quarter until
they were let loose into one of the
country's most decadent neighbor
hoods. "People were going crazy with
all the signs there," Kohn said. "One*
like Our women are men' in front of

The Band recieved a huge dose of
ego building when they played for
Norman High School in Oklahoma.
The Band's three school buses were
given a police escort through the
streets and the Band performed a
tribute to square household appli
ances, "our four-cornered household
friends" explained Stevens,"like the
TV, radio, and toaster." The Band
claims the only people who didn't
love them at the high school were
members of the away team's band
who were forced to play after the
game to give the Stanford Band more
time at halftime.
"The crowd just loved us in Okla
homa" Kohn said. "They were rock
ing out."
Kohn explained that the Oklahoma

crowd is very conservative.
"Everyone there wears their Reagan
T-shirt. That's why I wore my pink
tutu. I decided to be kind of oppo
site."

'Everyone wears their Reagan t-shirt.
That's why I wore my pink tutu. I
decided to be kind of opposite.'
— Drum Major Jim Kohn

At one point in the show the Stan
ford announcer said, "Reagan for
four more years." Kohn said the
crowd was cheering because they

didn't realize that the team had
formed the words "Mo" and "Ron"
on the field. A tribute was made to
Vanessa Williams while the letters
VW were formed . These letters then

rearranged themselves to create the
female anatomy on the field. "The
conservative Oklahoma crowd "was
shocked and they were appalled"

Cline said.
But the Oklahoma band and the
Stanford Band hit it off. Kohn said
that after the game the Oklahoma
band played for 15 minutes before
"people in their band came and
played with us."
Cline explained one reason the
Band liked Oklahoma. "While we
were there a bill was up which would
allow people to buy liquor by the the
glass. Before that you couldn't do it.
The bill passed. TTie Band was very
impressed by that."
Some controversy and tension were
stirred up in Oklahoma due to a press
statement released before the game
which Athletic Department officials
interpreted as unsupportive of the
football team.
"There was one line that shouldn't
have been written by us" Gode said.

"A lot of players read that and felt
the Band wasn't behind them. But
that isn't true. We're students too,
and we want to see the team win as
much as anybody else."
According to Kohn the release
said, "We're all growing long beards
waiting for the team to win." Kohn
was disappointed that some players
and officials felt that this implied that
the Band enjoys football team losses.
"The recent victories were great.
After the game the Band played out
to the team. It psyched people up and
psyched us up, too."
"The Band has talked to the Ath
letic Department about ways to get
the fans more spirited and cheering.
We're going to do things like chicken
[bass drum pounding!' and looking
for ways to help the football team,"
Gode said.


When the incomparable I.eland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band takes a road trip, it's more com
plicated than loading the brass and
beer into the bus and heading down
the road. In fact, it took several
months this summer for the masters
of mass-scale disorganized marching
to organize the $40,000 cross-country
trek to Oklahoma this month.
Band members say the trip was a
blaring success, though where the
Band goes some controversy almost
always follows. One hundred Band
members and the Dollies performed
in three states and as usual it was sort
of a love-hate relationship between
the Band and its audience.

The preseason trip originally
stirred up controversy in May
during fee assessment voting when
some questioned the use of student
funds for a trip that takes place
before the school year even begins.
Band Manager Scott Gode said that
"it was largely the graduate student
population who wondered how we
could justify paying for the Band to
go out and essentially have fun. But
we do it with the initial purpose in
mind to go out and support the
team."
Band members are currently
recovering from the strain of an in
tense schedule of playing, traveling
and partying. "Today peoples' lips
still hurt from playing," said the in
famous Drum Major Jim Kohn,
most easily recognized in his pink
tutu. "It was a face-breaking trip."

The Band rallied at Stanford Sun
day night. Sept. 2, and left to catch a
midnight flight. Longtime Stanford
rumor has it that the Band has been
forbidden on many airlines. "That's
not really true," said Kohn. "We just
take the cheapest airline."
But the rumor does in fact have
some substance. One band alum (the
Band calls them old farts) the Band
met on this trip was part of the group
that jumped all at once from one side
of a plane to the other in an attempt
to wreak havoc with the plane's in
struments. Apparently it worked and
is the primary source of the Band's
bad image with the airlines.
"This trip we just held up our seat
belts along with the stewardess and
went along with the safety routine,"

said Kohn. "But that's pretty old
stuff."
Old stuff or not, it did prompt at
least one fellow airline rider to write a
letter of complaint to University
President Donald Kennedy.
In a March Daily interview, Kohn
said, "We don't get any hate mail
. . . . We don't want everyone to love
us and it's getting dangerously close,"
but the angered Continental Airlines
apparently helped alleviate this prob
lem.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to
Kennedy said, "the president
received one letter from the pas
senger whose trip was ruined because
the Band was so obnoxious. Here we
know the Band and we're very
tolerant. Most people like the Band,
but when they're on the road it's dif
ferent. Their behavior is sometimes
less humorous to people."

The letter said that Band members
"made too much work for the flight
crew and made everyone over 22
miserable for the whole trip with their
shouting back and forth and swapping
seats." The letter ended, "1 made up
my mind to join the PRO
ABORTION League and to vote for
President Reagan so he can send
them down to Central America to
have live ammunition shot at them.
Please tell the children to act better in
public and to represent the school as
a courteous individual instead of the
mob of JERKS that they appeared to
be Sunday."
The first performance after the un
solicited airplane show was at a Labor
Day parade in New Orleans at the
World's Fair and was more popular.
"It was kind of interesting," ex
plained Kohn. "The Band doesn't
really march so it was the very first

female anatomy on the field. "The
conservative Oklahoma crowd "was
shocked and they were appalled"

Cline said.
But the Oklahoma band and the
Stanford Band hit it off. Kohn said
that after the game the Oklahoma
band played for 15 minutes before
"people in their band came and
played with us."
Cline explained one reason the
Band liked Oklahoma. "While we
were there a bill was up which would
allow people to buy liquor by the the
glass. Before that you couldn't do it.
The bill passed. TTie Band was very
impressed by that."
Some controversy and tension were
stirred up in Oklahoma due to a press
statement released before the game
which Athletic Department officials
interpreted as unsupportive of the
football team.
"There was one line that shouldn't
have been written by us" Gode said.

"A lot of players read that and felt
the Band wasn't behind them. But
that isn't true. We're students too,
and we want to see the team win as
much as anybody else."
According to Kohn the release
said, "We're all growing long beards
waiting for the team to win." Kohn
was disappointed that some players
and officials felt that this implied that
the Band enjoys football team losses.
"The recent victories were great.
After the game the Band played out
to the team. It psyched people up and
psyched us up, too."
"The Band has talked to the Ath
letic Department about ways to get
the fans more spirited and cheering.
We're going to do things like chicken
[bass drum pounding!' and looking
for ways to help the football team,"
Gode said.
