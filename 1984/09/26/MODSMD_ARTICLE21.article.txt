## Women break losing streak 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
Stanford women's soccer
coach Helen Keohane said
Cardinal Molly Barnes
"decided enough was enough"
in the second half of the Car
dinal's game against the Uni
versity of California, Los An
geles.
UCLA had just tied Stan
ford, 2-2, completing its come
back from a 2-0 halftime defi
cit. Barnes then scored on a
rebounded shot to give the
Cardinal a 3-2 victory, its first
triumph of this season after
three losses.
Barnes, a sophomore, and
senior Sue Moore scored in the
first half, and Keohane said
Barnes might have scored
more. Barnes' game-winning
goal came after UCLA scored
and Stanford kicked off.
"She really came on. She was
all over the place," Keohane
said. "She had a few chances
that didn't go, a lot of shots on
goal. She definitely pressured
their goalkeeper."
"The first half was very
good," Keohane said. "We
took a lot of shots on goal
besides the two that went in."
Keohane said she was
relieved the Cardinal got its
first victory.
"We needed it. We're going
over several hurdles this
season, and this was one of
them," Keohane said. "In pre
vious games, we would play
well and [lose] by one goal. It's
a boost to our confidence.
"Even when UCLA scored
two goals, we were able to
come back strong."
