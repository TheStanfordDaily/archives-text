# Secondary looking for improvement
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Game one against Oklahoma
wasn't too bad. Game two against Il
linois was OK. But it's game three,
against San Jose State last Saturday,
that the Stanford defensive backfield
probably wouldn't mind forgetting.
Against the Cardinal's secondary,
Spartan quarterback Bob Frasco
threw for 333 yards and completed
25 of 43 passes for one touchdown
and no interceptions. After the game,
Stanford Coach Jack Elway was being
questioned about, first, the narrow

victory and, second, the Cardinal sec
ondary.
"I'll have to see the films," Elway
responded to the latter. "But I'd have
to look at that part of our defense and
be concerned."
Another person who expressed
concern was Defensive Coordinator
and Secondary Coach Dick Mannini.
"I was very, very disappointed," he
said. "I knew we didn't play well. I
didn't have to see the films to know
that."
The starting secondary — which
consists of cornerbacks Eric Price and

Toi Cook and safeties Joe Cain and
Ed St. Geme — made no excuses for
their performance Saturday. Why
not? Because, according to Price and
Cain, there are none.
"We just didn't play well this
weekend," Price said. "I wouldn't say
this was one of our better games."
"We made mistakes we hand't
made in a long, long time," Cain said.
"Saturday was just a bad day."
After three games, Stanford is
ranked ninth in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence in pass defense, allowing an
average of 262.7 yards per game. In

total defense, the Cardinal is last,
giving up 414 yards per game.
"As far as people criticizing and
pointing the finger at us, we expected
it because we are inexperienced and
people point the finger at inexperi
ence," Price said.
As a whole, experience is not an as
set of the Stanford secondary. Al
though Price is a four-year starter at
right cornerback, Cook, Cain and St.
Geme are rookies to the starting
lineup. Cook and Cain are sop
homores, and St. Geme, a senior,
didn't play a down last year.

"The defensive backfield we had
last year took a few years to get to
gether," Price said of the 1983 sec
ondary that allowed 167.1 passing
yards per game. "You have to have
confidence in the other three guys
that they're going to do their part and
work together."
Price and the other three will get a
few more chances to find that
chemistry because, at least for the
time being, Elway and Mannini are
not planning any personnel changes.
"I think there are a few things we
can work on," Mannini said.
"Number one, we're not reacting to
the ball that fast when it's in the air.
They re too worried about getting
beat deep. And, number two, I don't
think there's enough communication
with the people (linebackers) in the
underneath coverage."
Mannini also took some of the
blame for Saturday's performance in
the secondary. "I was disappointed
that maybe we didn't do a good job
coaching that week," he said.
"Maybe they weren't emotionally
prepared. But I'm hoping that's water
under the bridge."
"That game's over," Cain said
Monday after practice. "We won, but
we have to improve."
