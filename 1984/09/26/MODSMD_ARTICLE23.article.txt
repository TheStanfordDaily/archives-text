# Card men to play
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford men's soccer team
today faces an opponent that does not
pose a complicated challenge, but a
challenge nevertheless, according to
Cardinal Asst. Coach Hunter Stern.
Stanford, 3-2-2, faces San Jose
State at Spartan Stadium tonight at 8
in its first Pacific Soccer Conference
game.
"I was with Sam (Koch, Stanford's
coach) when we saw them play
Friday," said Stern, a first-year
coach. "They're a little inconsistent.
They do the simple things well over
and over, and that makes them dan
gerous."
On Friday, Stern and Koch
watched San Jose State lose, 5-0, to
the University of San Francisco at
San Francisco. Despite the loss, Stern
said the Spartans had their chances to
win, but they "hit a couple of posts"
on shots and "missed on a
breakaway."
Stern said San Jose State's simple
play made it just as easy for the Car
dinal to prepare for tonight's game.
"I don't think we're going to
change anything in terms of what we
do," Stern said. "They like to take
dead-ball situations (such as in
bounding the ball) quickly, and we've
worked on reacting to it."
On offense, "we'll look to attack
from the outside in and make them
play the whole width of the field
against us," Stern said.
By spreading out San Jose State's
defenders from the outside, Stern
said the strategy is for Stanford's for
wards, such as Rob West, Giancarlo
Ferruzzi and Todd Rafalovich, to be
isolated.
"It will allow them (the forwards)
to pass the ball," Stern said. "The
people filling in from behind will get
scoring chances, and that could be
anybody."
Ferruzzi, a senior from San An
tonio, Texas, leads the Cardinal in
scoring with seven points on three
goals and one assist. Ferruzzi led
Stanford scorers last season with 11
goals and five assists for 27 points.
Stanford will play the University of
San Diego at home Saturday at 11
a.m. The Cardinal will play Fresno
tate at Fresno next Wednesday.
