The Stanford volleyball team
defeated host University of Santa
Qara last night, 15-6, 15-7, 4-15, 9-
15, 15-4, in a nonconference match.
The Cardinal, 4-1, played an
"inconsistent performance to say the
least," Asst. Coach Don Shaw said.
"The thing with Santa Qara is that
they don't have the talent we do, but
when they get going they can get
really hot.
"We let them off the hook in the
third game. They got really hot and
we couldn't stop them for two
games."
Stanford was behind, 11-1, in the
fourth game before it began to regain
momentum, Shaw said. In the fifth
game, the Cardinal established con
trol after going ahead, 8-4, he added.
"We've got to learn to have a little
bit of killer instinct," Shaw said. "[I

hope] we learned that with this
match."
