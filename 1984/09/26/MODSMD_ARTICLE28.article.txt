"The Thinker." They measure 21

feet high, 12 feet wide, four feet deep
and weigh eight tons.
The portal will serve as centerpiece
for the one-acre Cantor garden,
scheduled for completion in June.
Eventually, the garden will contain
20 other works by Rodin, including
the full cast of "The Burghers of
Calais," "Walking Man" and other
pieces.
The garden is located at the south
end of the Stanford Museum and is
designed to be a continuation of the
south rotunda, which houses the Uni
versity's Rodin collection.

Department of French and Italian,
won the 100- and 200-meter sprints
to become national champion for
men 60 and over at the National

Panofsky awarded German doctorate
Wolfgang Panofsky, former direc
tor of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, received an
honorary doctorate from the Univer
sity of Hamburg, Germany, where his
father taught until 1934. He was cited
for his contributions to high-energy
electron physics.
The award came the day after
Panofsky joined Friedrich von
Weizacker, president of West Ger
many, at the 25th anniversary of
DESY, which Panofsky called the
"sister institution" of SLAC.
In his DESY address, Panofsky

criticized President Reagan's Star
Wars defense plan to render nuclear
weapons "impotent and obsolete."
He contrasted this use of technology
with .satellites that eliminate secrecy
and help us "see" through the Iron
Curtain, resulting in a much more
open world than in the last century.
Drug blocks Parkinson's disease
A drug that shows promise in
slowing the course of Parkinson's
disease has been successfully tested in
animals by a University neurologist
and his research team.
In the Sept. 28 issue of Science
magazine, J. William Langstan, assis
tant professor of neurology at the
Stanford Medical School, reported
that the drug, pargyline, prevented
Parkinson's disease symptoms from
developing in monkeys that had been
given a chemical that causes a severe
form of disorder.
"The exciting possibility — and it's
still only a possibility — is that this
drug might also block progression of

Parkinson's disease in humans,"
Langston said in an interview with the
University News Service.
Parkinson's disease is a neuromus
cular disorder characterized by
stooped posture, rigid movements,
shuffling gait, involutary tremors and
loss of facial expression. It is esti
mated to afflict approximately half-a
million people in the United States,
including one person in 40 over the
age of 70, Langston said.
Carnochan to head center
English Prof. Bliss Carnochan has
been named director of the Univer
sity's Humanities Center, succeeding
Humanities Prof. Lan Watt. She
assumes the post on Sept. 1, 1985.
The year-long transition has been
arranged because of the complexities
of the job and to give Carnochan an
opportunity to take part in awarding
fellowships from the center to out
standing or promising faculty across
the country.

Hoover awarded grant
The Hoover Institution has been
awarded $262,000 by the U.S. De
partment of Education for a project
to preserve its posters and newspaper
collection of approximately 68,000
items, including illustrated wall
placards, official proclamations and
various propaganda vehicles.
The collection of international po
litical posters is the largest known
holding of its type in the United
States.
The proposal was funded through
the Strengthening Research Library
Resources Program, sponsored by the
Department of Education. Posters
will be cleaned, flattened and encaps
ulated, and color slides will be
produced for reference use. The
newspapers will be microfilmed, with
selected issues receiving special con
servation treatment.
Doctoral candidate wins award
John Nightingale, an applied
physics major at Stanford, is among
four doctoral candidates recently
named to receive Newport Research
Awards.
Nightingale receives a stipend of
$8,000 to asist in his research to
develop single crystal fiber optical
devices, specifically a ruby fiber laser
and fiber optical parametric oscil
lator. The University's Ginzton Lab
oratory will receive an additional
$4,000 to supervise the research.
The awards are being given for the
first time this year by the Newport
Corporation, based in Fountain Val
ley, Calif. The firm is a leading manu

facturer serving (he laser and electro
optics industry. Newport will provide
$500,000 in funding to the awards
over a five-year period, according to
Milton Chang, president.
Webb to head Advisory Board
Eugene Webb, associate dean at
the Business School, has been elected
chairman of the Advisory Board at
Stanford for 1984-85.
The board reviews every appoint
ment, reappointment and promotion

composed of seven full professors
elected by the council membership.
The board elects its own officers.
Management prize for prof.
Business School Prof. James March
is the recipient of an American
Academy of Management career
award for scholarly contribution to
management.
March, a well-known authority on
decision making and leadership in or
ganizations, was lauded for having
"played a primary role in advancing
the study of organizational and indi
vidual decision making under am
biguity, group processes, inference
measurement, and organizational
design, education administration, and
model building." The award was pre
sented to him at the American
Academy of Management's annual
meeting in August.
