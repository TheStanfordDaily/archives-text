Carolyn and Debbie said they had
a great time. Peter said Nicole had a
great time, too. And Frank was so
happy, he smiled all the way home to

Orientation meetings continue
today and tomorrow at 11 a.m. and 4
p.m. Prospective photographers

should come to our offices Friday at
3:30 p.m. Night and wire staffing is at
7 p.m. And any time is a good time to
pick up a story.
Also, don't forget today's 5 p.m.
deadline for edit board submissions.
In addition, be sure to attend our
staff lunch here today at noon.
And remember, the only thing be
tween you and The Daily is about 600
