# He's '42 going on 21' and ready for the challenge

### TROY EID Daily staff 
The summer months brought many personnel
changes in the upper ranks of Stanford's administration,
including a new provost, a new bursar, a new public af
fairs director for the Hoover Institution and a new foot
ball coach. In New Faces, a five-part series, The Daily
will profile these faces which will soon grow familiar.
Today: Bursar Jon Erickson.

Jon Erickson is the new kid in Old Union, and he
can't help smiling when he talks about what he'll do as
the University's new bursar.
Not that his predecessor, Joseph Jedd, isn't a tough
act to follow. Jedd retired in August after a quarter
century of working with students in financial need,
advising them on credit payments and tracking alumni
who reneged on debts.
But Erickson, who enrolled here as a freshman at
about the same time Jedd began his reign, says a
youthful outlook will help him make his mark in the
University ledgers.
"I like to think I have a new perspective on things.
After all, I'm 42 going on 21," he muses. "In fact, a
couple of years ago I went into a bar and got carded,
but so did a good friend of mine — and he's 55.
"If you want to know exactly what a bursar is, look
in the dictionary," he tells the unknowing. "I think it
means 'college treasurer.' I krow it's a lot of responsi
bility."
Responsibility isn't a thing for the meek, but then
Jon Erickson isn't one to shy away from risks. Cur
rently completing a stint as business manager at the
Department of Medicine — he officially takes his new
post on Oct. 15 — the San Jose native has a passion for
fireworks, born during his days in the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band, where he was in
charge of firing a cannon after every Cardinal touch
down.
The Bad Old Days
You might even have seen Erickson darting between
the lines in Maples Pavilion yesterday, leading the way
to the correct counter or offering a bit of financial ad
vice.
Tell him how horrible it is to stand around like that
and he might tell you about the bad old days.
"I graduated from here in '65, and the lines back
then looked pretty much the same," he says. "You
know, the same glazed looks and everything.
"Freshmen just get terribly confused in the process.
It's a case of incredible culture shock. Some are scared
to death, and others are too scared to even realize it."
He's quick to point out that fear exists even beyond
El Camino Real.
"Unfortunately, in the big, cruel business world,
there are some things that are out of our control," he
says softly. "In college, some people are facing debt for

Department of Medicine.
"I got a B.S. here in '65," he says.
"I majored in statistics, then went on
to get an MBA from San Jose State,
only to spend four joy-filled years in
the Air Force in a lovely spot called
Wichita Falls. Texas. It was that or
Saigon."
In the Air Force, Erickson was re
sponsible for teaching business to fel
low officers, "or trying to give them
MB As in about 10 weeks." Today he
faces a different challenge — mar

the first time.
"I guess you might say my life pur
pose is to take the edge off some of
that shock. The whole idea is to be a
friend to people."
The New Agenda
When Joseph Jedd announced his
retirement, he said the quickening
pace of technology was making it
harder and harder for him to serve
the University most efficiently. "1 feel
someone else should step in and con
tinue pushing Stanford to greatness,"
he said this summer.
Erickson "loves to play with
computers," including the Macintosh
he recently bought through the
Microdisc plan. Within the next five
years, he says the University ought to
establish a unified data base that
enables all student information, in
cluding personal finances, to be called
up on a computer screen at a given
time — with "the necessary safety
precautions."
"You should be able to come into
the Bursar's Office and say, 'What do
I owe?' and have your answer boom!
right there."
He doesn't know if that's possible:
There are so many risks involved,
which seems to make it that much
more attractive to him.
Past and Present
Erickson welcomes his new post as
a chance to work directly with stu
dents, something not included in his
financial and personnel duties at the

'I can relate so much easier to
feelings from the students than I can
with my peers. I guess that could get
me into trouble.'
— University Bursar Jon Erickson

shading a force of seven freshman ad
visees assigned to him under the guise
of "social sciences." He says he loves
it; yesterday the troops went bicycling
together around campus.
A man "probably too busy to get
married," he even finds time to
dabble in amateur radio. As he puts
it, "My car is the one with three an
tennas."
On weekends he's a police dis
patcher at the football games. In ad
dition to his pledge to protect and
serve, he sits in the press box "with
air conditioning and big windows.
"It's the best place in the whole
stadium," he says. "That must be why
I do it."

There's also his work with the Axe
Committee, which Erickson calls a
much-needed moral support group
for Stanford athletics. "We're trying
to develop whatever the hell Stanford
support of sports is, the unique
cheers, our own way of doing things,"
he says.
But much of his spark goes into a
job with Pyrospectaculars, Inc., the
Los Angeles-based company that
made the fireworks used in this year's
Olympics. Erickson was the licensed

pyrotechnician responsible for the
fireworks at the last half-dozen Big
Games.
"It's a lot of work, and it's danger
ous. I do it for the thrill and beauty."
He laughes. "And I still have 10 fin
gers on my hands."
He says if he slows down, he'll
probably age 10 or 20 years.
"I look at some of the people I
graduated from high school with,
some of them grandparents already
— Jesus Christ!
"I can relate so much easier to
feelings from the students than 1 can
with my peers. I guess that could get
me into trouble."
It's a chance he's willing to take.
