# He's '42 going on 21' and ready for the challenge

### TROY EID Daily staff 
The summer months brought many personnel
changes in the upper ranks of Stanford's administration,
including a new provost, a new bursar, a new public af
fairs director for the Hoover Institution and a new foot
ball coach. In New Faces, a five-part series, The Daily
will profile these faces which will soon grow familiar.
Today: Bursar Jon Erickson.

Jon Erickson is the new kid in Old Union, and he
can't help smiling when he talks about what he'll do as
the University's new bursar.
Not that his predecessor, Joseph Jedd, isn't a tough
act to follow. Jedd retired in August after a quarter
century of working with students in financial need,
advising them on credit payments and tracking alumni
who reneged on debts.
But Erickson, who enrolled here as a freshman at
about the same time Jedd began his reign, says a
youthful outlook will help him make his mark in the
University ledgers.
"I like to think I have a new perspective on things.
After all, I'm 42 going on 21," he muses. "In fact, a
couple of years ago I went into a bar and got carded,
but so did a good friend of mine — and he's 55.
"If you want to know exactly what a bursar is, look
in the dictionary," he tells the unknowing. "I think it
means 'college treasurer.' I krow it's a lot of responsi
bility."
Responsibility isn't a thing for the meek, but then
Jon Erickson isn't one to shy away from risks. Cur
rently completing a stint as business manager at the
Department of Medicine — he officially takes his new
post on Oct. 15 — the San Jose native has a passion for
fireworks, born during his days in the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band, where he was in
charge of firing a cannon after every Cardinal touch
down.
The Bad Old Days
You might even have seen Erickson darting between
the lines in Maples Pavilion yesterday, leading the way
to the correct counter or offering a bit of financial ad
vice.
Tell him how horrible it is to stand around like that
and he might tell you about the bad old days.
"I graduated from here in '65, and the lines back
then looked pretty much the same," he says. "You
know, the same glazed looks and everything.
"Freshmen just get terribly confused in the process.
It's a case of incredible culture shock. Some are scared
to death, and others are too scared to even realize it."
He's quick to point out that fear exists even beyond
El Camino Real.
"Unfortunately, in the big, cruel business world,
there are some things that are out of our control," he
says softly. "In college, some people are facing debt for
