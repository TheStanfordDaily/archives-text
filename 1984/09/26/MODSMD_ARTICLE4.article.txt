New computer-read University
Food Service cards should make
eating at Stanford more convenient
for some students, according to the
head of food service here.
Food Service Manager Maxine An
derson said the plastic "Validine"
cards given during registration yester
day and Monday will allow students
greater flexibility in when and where
they take their meals.
The cards were distributed to stu
dents living in all dormitories that re
quire meal plans and eight row
houses.
A reading device has been installed
in every food service-run dining hall.
When a student enters a hall, he will
insert his new card into a reader,
which will record the meal on the stu
dent's record.
The new system provides the most
dramatic change in the 14-meal-per
week plan. In past years, students
were forced to choose between a
breakfast-dinner and a lunch-dinner
option, but with the new system stu
dents may take any combination of
meals up to the total of 14.
The system will also provide
greater ease for eating at dining halls
other than one's own. Students may
now eat in any University-run dining
halls, including those at eight row
houses, without any special permits.
Students will still need to obtain
transfer cards if they wish to dine at
Sterling Quad or houses without Uni
versity Food Service, including frater
nities and co-ops.
"The new computerized system
with magnetic card readers in every
dining room has been used in a lot of
universities and is probably the best
in the country," Anderson said.
The cost totals are not yet in for the
system, Anderson said, but she es
timates the final bill will be some
where around $50,000 for the
original installation of the readers
and other necessary equipment. And
while the new cards are more expen
sive to produce than the old ones,
Anderson said they are of a "higher
grade" and will not be replaced each
year, as the old ones were.

Anderson said future changes for
Food Service are possible, but that no
decisions have been made. "We'll al
ways look to the future to see what
students want," she said.
Over the summer, a new computer
ized menu management system was
installed in the food service offices.
Anderson said all food service recipes

will be programmed into the com
puter so that price adjustments on in
dividual food items can be made im
mediately.
The computerized menu system
will have the most significant
ramifications for Sterling Quad resi
dents, who use a pay-as-you-eat
dining plan.

Freshman Curtis Yates had reason to question the efficiency of the
University's new meal-card system, "Validine," after a machine at
Florence Moore repeatedly refused to accept his newly purchased
card.
