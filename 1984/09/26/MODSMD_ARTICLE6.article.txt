Syria-Israel understanding expected
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres hinted yester
day that he expects Syria and Israel to reach some informal
"understanding" that would permit an Israeli troop withdrawal from
southern Lebanon.
However, Peres made no mention of any timetable for such moves
and both Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Assistant U.S.
Secretary of State Richard Murphy warned against unrealistic hopes of
an imminent troop pullout.
The remarks came as Murphy continued his Middle East fact-finding
tour yesterday, meeting both Rabin and Peres before flying to Cairo for
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
After his meetings here, the U.S. diplomat cautioned reporters that
his is "a mission of exploration — it's no more than that." And Rabin
warned that while "we all hope" that Murphy's mission will clarify the
situation, "I want to warn against exaggerated expectations about sol
ving complicated problems."
Peres' comments were made before he met Murphy, during an inter
view with Israel radio taped early yesterday morning. The government
press office later released brief excerpts and said the full interview is to
be broadcast during the Jewish New Year holiday, which begins this af
ternoon.
According to the excerpts, Peres replied this way to a question about
negotiations with Syria:
"In the past we have already seen several instances in which we
reached all kinds of understandings with the Syrians — on the Golan
Heights, even in Lebanon itself — almost without negotiations. When
the Syrians identify their interests, and when they are capable of also un
derstanding our interests, and there is no conflict between the two, then
an understanding is created which is limited in scope and limited to a
certain place. And this is what I see in the future, more or less."
Bombs hit South African Consulate
NEW YORK — Two bombs exploded yesterday night at an office
building in mid-Manhattan that houses the South African Consulate
among other tenants, police said.
The blast occurred at 12:23 a.m. (EDT), according to police Sgt.
Eddie LeSchack. He said one bomb exploded in the basement of the
building and one on the 12th floor. There were no immediate reports of
injuries.
LeSchack said it was believed the South African Consulate was
housed on the 12th floor.
The extent of damage was not immediately known, the sergeant said.
The Associated Press received a taped message at 12:35 a.m. (EDT)
in which an accented male voice said: "We bombed the South African
Consulate in New York City in solidarity with resistance to South
African human rights violations. Down with apartheid. Victory to the
freedom fighters. Defeat U.S. imperialism. Guerrilla resistance."
Accord reached on defense budget
WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators agreed yesterday
to a 1985 defense spending plan that trims billions from President
Reagan's original budget and delays further production of the MX
missile pending a chance for either chamber to scuttle the nuclear
weapon in April.
After months of deadlock, conferees on the defense authorization bill
resolved 1,200 differences between the House and Senate versions of
the measure in a final, round-the-clock session that began early Monday.
Reagan originally had sought $313 billion. Under a leadership agree
ment that triggered the breakthrough, the appropriations bill, which ac
companies the authorization bill, will call for $292.9 billion, or less, in
actual spending for fiscal 1985.
That amounts to a 5 percent "real" — or inflation-adjusted — in
crease for the Pentagon. Reagan, at first, sought 13 percent, then came
down to 7.5 percent before retreating yet again under terms of a general
agreement reached last week by House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.) and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.).
Melvin Price (D-I1L), House arms services chairman, said the final
product, which yet must be considered by the House and Senate, reflects
a consensus of both chambers. That consensus, he said, is "that national
security imperatives require real growth in the defense budget, but that
the size of the deficit does not permit growth to the degree requested"
by the president.
Award for Agent Orange victims
NEW YORK — A federal judge, saying "hardships will be reduced to
some small degree," tentatively approved a $180 million settlement yes
terday for Vietnam veterans and their families who claim they were
harmed by the herbicide Agent Orange.
U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein said the settlement, financed by
seven chemical companies who made Agent Orange and were sued by
the veterans, might not be much if divided among thousands of
claimants.
But he said there was little chance the plaintiffs could collect more by
going to trial with their class-action suit.
More than 26,000 veterans have blamed Agent Orange for illnesses
ranging from skin rash to cancer, miscarriages and birth defects. The ul
timate number of claimants, counting spouses and children, could top
120,000, according to attorneys in the case.
Weinstein said he would withhold final approval of the pact until a
method of distributing the money is worked out.
Mayor considers peninsula stadium
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who dropped an ear
lier proposal to build a domed stadium downtown, is exploring the possi
bility of building a new sports arena across Highway 101 from San Fran
cisco International Airport in San Mateo County.
The mayor said yesterday that the main advantage of the airport site
was that the city owns the land. She indicated that pressure is building to
come up with a serious stadium plan soon.
"It's fair to say what I thought would happen is starting to happen,"
she said, referring to reports that communities such as Redwood City
and San Jose are considering trying to lure away the 49ers football team
and the Giants baseball team by building a stadium.
Last month the mayor indicated she thought there might be a possibil
ity of refurbishing windy Candlestick Park, but she said she now believes
the cost is prohibitive.
Actor Walter Pigeon dies at 86
SANTA MONICA — Actor Walter Pidgeon, whose urbane charm
carried him from romantic to fatherly roles in a 40-year stage and screen
career, died yesterday. He was 86.
Pidgeon died at 9 a.m. at St. John's Hospital and Health Center,
where he was admitted late last Wednesday, said hospital spokeswoman
Terri DeLange.
"Mr. Pidgeon suffered a series of strokes at his home before his admit
tance to St. John's, and again when he was admitted to the hospital,"
DeLange said, reading from a statement by Pidgeon's attending
physician. William Skinner.
Pidgeon was propelled to stardom in eight movies in which he co
starred with British-born Greer Garson.
One of his last major roles came in 1 973, when he portrayed an aging
pickpocket in "Harry In Your Pocket."
Mixed trading on stock market
NEW YORK — The stock market turned in a mixed performance
yesterday in lackluster trading as the broader market was unable to keep
pace with price gains in the blue chips.
The auto and oil stocks led the advances, while airline issues declined.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 3.32 points
on Monday, tacked on another 2.10 points to close at 1,207.16.
Today's weather
Fair and warm today with highs in the mid 80s. Overnight tempera
tures dropping into the mid 50s.
