# Soviet leader rebuffs Reagan's plea

MOSCOW â€” Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko, brushing off
President Reagan's conciliatory
speech at the United Nations, said
yesterday that there is no sign that
U.S. ieaders want normal relations
with the Soviet Union.
Meanwhile, the official news
agency Tass criticized Reagan's Mon
day speech as "presidential elec
tioneering" with nothing new in it.
Tass said the president's address
"boiled down to absolutely ground
less assertions that the U.S.A. al
legedly wants the arms race to be
curbed."
Chernenko, speaking to the Soviet
writers' union, did not refer directly
to Reagan's proposals for regular
meetings between senior U.S. and
Soviet officials to improve relations.
However, he blamed the United
States for a "disquieting" interna
tional situation, adding: "They in the
United States, as all signs indicate,
either do not want, or are not yet
ready to understand that there is no

sensible alternative to the normaliza
tion of Soviet-American relations on
the principles of equality, mutual
respect and non-interference in the
internal affairs of each other."
Chernenko's speech and the Tass
commentary indicated that the Krem
lin is continuing its hard line toward
the Reagan administration only days
before Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko meets with Reagan
Friday.
In the past, Reagan has been
reviled as a warmonger and
compared in the media here with
Adolf Hitler. The latest Kremlin
pronouncements made clear that the
U.S. leader is still viewed with deep
suspicion.
The main evening television news
show carried Chernenko's entire 20-
minute speech before the writers'
union, possibly to demonstrate that
he is in good health. In other recent
televised appearances at the Kremlin,
the Soviet leader at times seemed to
be gasping for breath and on one oc

casion he leaned on a chair for sup
port.
Monday, however, he was shown
walking briskly without assistance.
And his breathing, while still difficult,
was apparently easier than it has been
during some of his previous appear
ances.
In his speech, Chernenko said it is
the "grim truth" that the threat of nu
clear confrontation is great.
"The matter, of course, does not
boil down to a choice between the
U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A., as anti-
Communists not infrequently claim,"
he said.
"It is a matter of choice between
the life and death of our civilization,
Chernenko added. "There is no
'golden mean' here: One can be
either with those who are preparing
for war, or with those who reject im
perialism's adventurous policy, who
work for peaceful coexistence, for
disarmament." In the Soviet lexicon,
the United States and its allies repre
sent the forces of imperialism.

As for the Soviet Union, Cher
nenko said its objectives are clear and
unchanged, adding: "We are
categorically opposed to confronta
tion in the military sphere. We are
resolutely in favor of a radical limita
tion and reduction of the arms race,
prohibition and total elimination of
nuclear weapons."
The Soviet leader also questioned
the practical results of East-West cul
tural exchanges. "They in the West
... like to talk about the benefits of
comparing ideas and views, develop
ing contacts between people," he
said. "We, of course, favor this. But
what do we encounter in practice?
"Attempts at unceremonious inter
ference in our domestic affairs, a real
psychological war," he added. "And
one of its aims is to undermine, if only
a little, unity between workers ...
and the (Communist) Party."
The Tass commentary sharply at
tacked Reagan's U.N. address and
said it did not put forward realistic
arms control proposals.
