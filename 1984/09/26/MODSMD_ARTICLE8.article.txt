# U.S. tries to downplay meeting hopes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — White House officials tried
yesterday to dampen expectations they themselves
partially created about the likely success of Presi
dent Reagan's meeting Friday with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
Meanwhile, the president dismissed criticism of
his U.N. speech in the Soviet press, saying, "I never
get good reviews from Tass." Asked whether he
thought he would get better reviews from the
Soviets after his Oval Office meeting with
Gromyko, Reagan said, "We'll have to wait and
see what happens."
Ever since Reagan announced the meeting two
weeks ago and expressed the hope that it would
"improve our working relationship with the Soviet
Union," administration strategists have been
saying that the get-together would offset the Dem
ocratic portrayal of Reagan as a president who has

increased international tensions.
In the wake of the president's conciliatory U.N.
speech, which contained much talk of peace but
few specifics, these expectations have been raised
so high that administration officials have taken to
warning reporters not to expect too much from the
meeting.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said yes
terday that "there will be some time required on
the part of the Soviets for reflection" after the
meeting, at which he said the president has "a num
ber of ideas" to put forward.
"Our main objective is to clear the air of misun
derstanding in this relationship and to renew a
process of dialogue after this period of impasse,"
Speakes said.
Reagan prepared for the meeting, his first as
president with Gromyko, by conferring yesterday

with Henry Kissinger, former national security ad
viser to President Nixon.
Reagan also disclosed that he had met in New
York on Monday with Nixon for an "exchange of
views" on Gromyko. Reagan said that Nixon, who
met Gromyko numerous times when he was vice
president and president, "told me some of the ex
periences he had" in dealing with the veteran So
viet diplomat.
White House officials, politically sensitive about
giving Nixon visibility during an election campaign,
did not announce the meeting, which was held in
the Waldorf Hotel in New York just before Reagan
left the city yesterday. Speakes refused to confirm
that the meeting had taken place, but Reagan dis
closed it in response to shouted questions from
reporters after a departure ceremony for Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
