# Mondale assails Reagan 'happy talk'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Democratic
presidential candidate Walter
Mondale, appearing with Sen. Gary
Hart before a cheering crowd at
George Washington University,
accused President Reagan yesterday
of trying to exploit the supposed sel
fishness and greed of young voters.
Mondale accused the Republicans
of cynically trying to appeal to young
voters with a message that is "all
sizzle and no substance, all happy talk
and no straight talk, all blue skies and
no blueprint, all television and no vi
sion at all."
The Democratic nominee, who has
been visiting college campuses across
the nation in an effort to erode

Reagan's strength among the young,
was interrupted numerous times by
applause and earned several standing
ovations. Although he encountered
heckling at the University of South
ern California last week, his college
audiences recently have been his best,
despite polls that show Reagan's
popularity is disproportionately high
among voters younger than 30.
In his speech, Mondale also
reiterated his charge that Reagan, in
an address Monday to the United Na
tions, executed a complete turn
around on his hard-line approach to
the Soviet Union. "This presidential
[campaign] raises a crucial question:
How can the American people tell

which Reagan would be president if
he's re-elected?" Mondale asked.
In yesterday's speech, Mondale
said he did not believe the
"conventional wisdom" that the
younger generation is "self-content,
materialistic, devoid of social com
mitment," with no sense of history
and "an attention span no longer than
a television commercial."
Launching into a description of a
mythical presidential campaign de
signed to appeal to those qualities, he
drew a bitter caricature of the Reagan
campaign.
"Believing you to be selfish, they

would pander to your supposed
greed," he said. "Their message
would be: Be glad for what you have,
and be blind to those who have little.
Believing you have no memory, they
would exploit your amnesia and their
message would be: History is bunk.
Republicans are Democrats. And in
1984, the year of Orwell, let's call the
MX missle the 'Peacekeeper.' "
Mondale said that Reagan's appar
ent change of heart on U.S.-Spvier
relations was indicative of a "ncvi
Reagan" emerging on a variety of
foreign policy issues, including con
flicts in Central America, South
Africa and the Middle East.
