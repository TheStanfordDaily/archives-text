An inaccurate review of
"THE 18th CENTURY ENGLISH NOVEL"
appeared in the fall quarter Course Guide
We would like to print a more accurate review
with our apologies to Professor Terry Castle.
Novels written during the 18th century in England tended to be long works
and therefore Professor Terry Castle's class" The 18th Century English SoveF'
involves an extensive amount of reading. Professor Castle's approach to the
subject was said to be "fresh and funny" by one student, while others praised
her for her "outstanding classroom performance." The class was "loaded with
discussion" and students were pleased to gain "an interesting theoretical and
historical perspective" on material they had expected to be dry.
Virtually every student commented on the heavy reading load and some
suggested that it should be shortened, but again, a heavy load is inherant to the
nature of the subject matter. There was repeated advise to students taking the
course to keep on top of the reading as is expressed by this student, "Don't be
come bogged down with the reading — there is a vast amount of it and it
becomes exceedingly difficult to catch up." Several students called for a draw
ing together of the key themes of 18th century literature, possibly through more
lectures, weekly sections or small discussion groups.
There were a few grumbles about Professor Castle's mandatory atten
dance policy, but these were overshadowed by comments on her humor,
openness and enthusiasm. One student wrote, "She has a fresh approach, she
is able to throw an amusing 20th century perspective on 18th century litera
ture."
