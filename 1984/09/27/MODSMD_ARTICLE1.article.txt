# It's anything but quiet on Stanford's western front
## Stanford cashes in on big 'land bank' 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
As the University continues to ex
pand, plans to develop the last flat
parcel of land near the center of
campus are currently being consid
ered by Stanford officials.
According to a draft plan released
by the planning department, the 86-
acre plot of land bordering the south
side of Sand Hill Road will contain
classrooms, offices, research facilities
and storage buildings. Campus plan
ners said development should be
completed within three to 10 years,
depending on demand.
Andy Doty, University director of
community relations, said this area
was set aside by the University as a
"land bank" for future academic use.
Doty said the land, currently overrun
with weeds and wildflowers, has been
left vacant in anticipation of this
need.
The area is bounded by Campus
Drive West, Old Searsville Road,
Sand Hill Road (formerly Willow
Road), Pasteur Drive and Welch
Road.
West campus
The draft, along with plans to ex
tend Sand Hill to El Camino Real and
to build two separate faculty housing
complexes on Sand Hill and Welch
roads, indicates that the the future of
Stanford lies to the west. If all of

these proposals are carried out as cur
rently planned, the University will be
sinking hundreds of millions of dol
lars into west side development in the
next five to 10 years.
Campus Planner Judy Chan said
the 86-acre area "is one of the last in
fill sites for academic uses" at Stan
ford. She agreed that, while the aca
demic hub of campus will remain at
the Inner Quad, this new area will
potentially serve thousands of stu
dents — primarily in medicine and bi
ology — each day.
Chan said despite notions to the
contrary, the classrooms will not be
too far from the center of campus, as
suming students traveling back and
forth from the Quad are on bicycle.
"Traveling to the west campus is
not much further than traveling to
Escondido Village from the Quad,"
she said. Nevertheless, students who
have 10 minutes to rush from the
Quad to a west campus class might
find themselves habitually late.
A three-part plan
The plan calls for the 86 acres to be
separated into three parcels: one for
medium- to high-density instruction
and research, one for low density in
struction and research and one for
University suppport services.
