# It's anything but quiet on Stanford's western front
## Stanford cashes in on big 'land bank' 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
As the University continues to ex
pand, plans to develop the last flat
parcel of land near the center of
campus are currently being consid
ered by Stanford officials.
According to a draft plan released
by the planning department, the 86-
acre plot of land bordering the south
side of Sand Hill Road will contain
classrooms, offices, research facilities
and storage buildings. Campus plan
ners said development should be
completed within three to 10 years,
depending on demand.
Andy Doty, University director of
community relations, said this area
was set aside by the University as a
"land bank" for future academic use.
Doty said the land, currently overrun
with weeds and wildflowers, has been
left vacant in anticipation of this
need.
The area is bounded by Campus
Drive West, Old Searsville Road,
Sand Hill Road (formerly Willow
Road), Pasteur Drive and Welch
Road.
West campus
The draft, along with plans to ex
tend Sand Hill to El Camino Real and
to build two separate faculty housing
complexes on Sand Hill and Welch
roads, indicates that the the future of
Stanford lies to the west. If all of

these proposals are carried out as cur
rently planned, the University will be
sinking hundreds of millions of dol
lars into west side development in the
next five to 10 years.
Campus Planner Judy Chan said
the 86-acre area "is one of the last in
fill sites for academic uses" at Stan
ford. She agreed that, while the aca
demic hub of campus will remain at
the Inner Quad, this new area will
potentially serve thousands of stu
dents — primarily in medicine and bi
ology — each day.
Chan said despite notions to the
contrary, the classrooms will not be
too far from the center of campus, as
suming students traveling back and
forth from the Quad are on bicycle.
"Traveling to the west campus is
not much further than traveling to
Escondido Village from the Quad,"
she said. Nevertheless, students who
have 10 minutes to rush from the
Quad to a west campus class might
find themselves habitually late.
A three-part plan
The plan calls for the 86 acres to be
separated into three parcels: one for
medium- to high-density instruction
and research, one for low density in
struction and research and one for
University suppport services.
The 27.7-acre parcel designated


A. Extension of

C. Proposed site of

housing com
plex
D. 86-acre parcel
of land. Pro
posed uses:
1 — medium to
high density
academic use
2 — low density
academic use
3 — support
services

Proposed developments on the west side of campus
for medium- to high-density research
is "reserved for mainline academic
activity characteristic of the core
campus," according to the report.
This area, featuring three- to five
story buildings and an "occasional
unique facility," will accommodate
growth in science, engineering or
medical center structures.
Chan said the building density in
this area will be similar to that in the
Inner Quad.
The 25.8-acre low density section
will serve as a transition zone be
tween the Sand Hill corridor and the
higher density area. The report says

the low densits area will be com
prised of one- to two-story buildings
in an open setting. It will probably
have offices. labs and greenhouses.
Chan said the density level in this
area will be similar to the density of
buildings that make up the Center tor
Behavioral Sciences, near the Golf
Course clubhouse.
The smallest parcel, 14.6 acres, will
house University services like
warehousing, parking, plumbing and
a carpentry shop. Chan likened this
area to the buildings behind the
police and fire stations on Bonair
Siding.
All three parcels will be serviced by
an internal road off Campus Drive
West. Plans for the road are pending
Santa Clara County approval.

W ho controls the land
Control of these Sb'Ucres has been
the subject of keen debate between
governmental entities during the past
several years. Palo Alto Mayor Larry
Klein attempted to wrestle veto
power over the land plans as a condi
tion of the Willow Road extension,
but that proposal was denied 6 to 3 by
the Palo Alto City Council.
Instead, Stanford must merely
present plans to Palo Alto for review
and comment, but the city has no say
in the final project. The land falls un
der county jurisdiction, and all plans
must be approved by the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors and its
architectural review board.
Klein expressed displeasure with
the agreement, saying it is not enough

that the "University keeps us in
formed and gives us a right to talk."
He said large-scale projects in the
area affect Palo Alto and therefore
the city should participate in the
decision-making process.
"The sensitivity of land use and
transportation problems in that cor
ridor makes us think we should have
a significant say," Klein said.
According to Chan, the University
keeps Palo Alto informed of plans
such as these as part of a 1974 "city
services" agreement.
"The area is outside the city but
within Santa Clara County," Doty
said. "As a matter of principle, the
University is arguing it should be sub
ject to county control, not city. We
are a quasi-city outside of Palo Alto.
"It's clear the city will not have

veto power over the land," he said.
Palo Alto is currently reviewing
plans for the Environmental Safety
Facility, a hazardous waste dump to
be located on three and one-half
acres adjacen' io the 86-acre plot.
County reviewing plans
Jerry Parks, project manager tor
the facility, said the plans have been
completed and the county is currently
reviewing the Environmental Impact
Report, a document prepared in con
junction with all major develop
ments.
"If all goes smoothly, we anticipate
the EIR to be approved in December
and we should begin construction in
January." He expects the $6.5 million
facility to be ready for occupancy by
March, 1986.

classrooms, offices, research facilities
and storage buildings. Campus plan
ners said development should be
completed within three to 10 years,
depending on demand.
Andy Doty, University director of
community relations, said this area
was set aside by the University as a
"land bank" for future academic use.
Doty said the land, currently overrun
with weeds and wildflowers, has been
left vacant in anticipation of this
need.
The area is bounded by Campus
Drive West, Old Searsville Road,
Sand Hill Road (formerly Willow
Road), Pasteur Drive and Welch
Road.
West campus
The draft, along with plans to ex
tend Sand Hill to El Camino Real and
to build two separate faculty housing
complexes on Sand Hill and Welch
roads, indicates that the the future of
Stanford lies to the west. If all of

these proposals are carried out as cur
rently planned, the University will be
sinking hundreds of millions of dol
lars into west side development in the
next five to 10 years.
Campus Planner Judy Chan said
the 86-acre area "is one of the last in
fill sites for academic uses" at Stan
ford. She agreed that, while the aca
demic hub of campus will remain at
the Inner Quad, this new area will
potentially serve thousands of stu
dents — primarily in medicine and bi
ology — each day.
Chan said despite notions to the
contrary, the classrooms will not be
too far from the center of campus, as
suming students traveling back and
forth from the Quad are on bicycle.
"Traveling to the west campus is
not much further than traveling to
Escondido Village from the Quad,"
she said. Nevertheless, students who
have 10 minutes to rush from the
Quad to a west campus class might
find themselves habitually late.
A three-part plan
The plan calls for the 86 acres to be
separated into three parcels: one for
medium- to high-density instruction
and research, one for low density in
struction and research and one for
University suppport services.

housing com
plex
D. 86-acre parcel
of land. Pro
posed uses:
1 — medium to
high density
academic use
2 — low density
academic use
3 — support
services

Proposed developments on the west side of campus
for medium- to high-density research
is "reserved for mainline academic
activity characteristic of the core
campus," according to the report.
This area, featuring three- to five
story buildings and an "occasional
unique facility," will accommodate
growth in science, engineering or
medical center structures.
Chan said the building density in
this area will be similar to that in the
Inner Quad.
The 25.8-acre low density section
will serve as a transition zone be
tween the Sand Hill corridor and the
higher density area. The report says

the low densits area will be com
prised of one- to two-story buildings
in an open setting. It will probably
have offices. labs and greenhouses.
Chan said the density level in this
area will be similar to the density of
buildings that make up the Center tor
Behavioral Sciences, near the Golf
Course clubhouse.
The smallest parcel, 14.6 acres, will
house University services like
warehousing, parking, plumbing and
a carpentry shop. Chan likened this
area to the buildings behind the
police and fire stations on Bonair
Siding.
All three parcels will be serviced by
an internal road off Campus Drive
West. Plans for the road are pending
Santa Clara County approval.

W ho controls the land
Control of these Sb'Ucres has been
the subject of keen debate between
governmental entities during the past
several years. Palo Alto Mayor Larry
Klein attempted to wrestle veto
power over the land plans as a condi
tion of the Willow Road extension,
but that proposal was denied 6 to 3 by
the Palo Alto City Council.
Instead, Stanford must merely
present plans to Palo Alto for review
and comment, but the city has no say
in the final project. The land falls un
der county jurisdiction, and all plans
must be approved by the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors and its
architectural review board.
Klein expressed displeasure with
the agreement, saying it is not enough

that the "University keeps us in
formed and gives us a right to talk."
He said large-scale projects in the
area affect Palo Alto and therefore
the city should participate in the
decision-making process.
"The sensitivity of land use and
transportation problems in that cor
ridor makes us think we should have
a significant say," Klein said.
According to Chan, the University
keeps Palo Alto informed of plans
such as these as part of a 1974 "city
services" agreement.
"The area is outside the city but
within Santa Clara County," Doty
said. "As a matter of principle, the
University is arguing it should be sub
ject to county control, not city. We
are a quasi-city outside of Palo Alto.
"It's clear the city will not have

veto power over the land," he said.
Palo Alto is currently reviewing
plans for the Environmental Safety
Facility, a hazardous waste dump to
be located on three and one-half
acres adjacen' io the 86-acre plot.
County reviewing plans
Jerry Parks, project manager tor
the facility, said the plans have been
completed and the county is currently
reviewing the Environmental Impact
Report, a document prepared in con
junction with all major develop
ments.
"If all goes smoothly, we anticipate
the EIR to be approved in December
and we should begin construction in
January." He expects the $6.5 million
facility to be ready for occupancy by
March, 1986.

As the University continues to ex
pand, plans to develop the last flat
parcel of land near the center of
campus are currently being consid
ered by Stanford officials.
According to a draft plan released
by the planning department, the 86-
acre plot of land bordering the south
side of Sand Hill Road will contain
classrooms, offices, research facilities
and storage buildings. Campus plan
