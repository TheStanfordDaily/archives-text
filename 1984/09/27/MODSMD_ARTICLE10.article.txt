The Mural Majority
Fraternity controversy at Stanford is a drab affair
compared with the excitement at the University of
Pennsylvania.
Problems at Penn started when Delta Upsilon
fraternity brothers painted a colorful mural on the front
of their university-owned house early this summer,
112 raternity and Sorority Affairs Director Rebecca
Reuling acquired a dislike for the mural, labelled it
"inappropriate' and ordered fraternity leaders to paint
over it by Sept. 5.
The DUs refused and the university said it would
hire a painting contractor to paint the house.
The DUs, though, did not take the decision lying
down. Stating that the mural "represents the diffusion
of liberal culture," the fraternity brothers collected
more than 300 signatures on a petition to save the
mural and constructed a barricade in front of their
house the night before the Sept. 5 deadline. One DU

member spent the night in a hand-made cage to protest
the university's decision, and a photograph on page one
of The Daily Pennsylvanian showed DU brother Larry
Linick with an axe on his shoulder standing guard
beside a sign reading, "You will not paint over the art."
Last week, a compromise solution was reached. The
university covered the mural with a preservative and

painted over it. The mural will remain covered until the
residential buildings office rules on whether fraternities
and sororities can paint their own houses.
Even that answer was too much for Linick. He flew
into a rage when the mural was covered and
"graffitified the entire upstairs of the frat," said Ames
Alexander of The Daily Pennsylvanian.
Alexander described Linick, who was ousted from
the DUs for his actions, as "a colorful character."
Striking against the Ivy
Now they know what it feels like.
With a strike by Yale University's 2,650 clerical and
technical workers, Yale students, like Stanford students
two years ago, have no food service.
The employees — including secretaries, research
assistants, telephone operators and computer program
mers — went on strike yesterday after negotiations
between the workers and the university broke off late
Tuesday night.
The workers, who earn an average of $13,424 now,
want a three-year contract, across-the-board salary
increases, step raises totaling 38 percent, and as
surances that no layoffs will result from implementing
the additional requested expenditures.
Yale plans to have management employees take over
some of the jobs of strikers, and students will receive
money for off-campus dining.
University of Confusion
Last spring, a survey of students at the University of
California at Berkeley found them so apathetic about
student government that many could not recall the
name of the president of the Associated Students of the
University of California at Berkeley (ASUC).
Mike Gravely changed all that last spring when he
was elected ASUC president, disqualified by the ASUC
Judicial Committee, reinstated by the same committee,
disqualified again in a separate hearing and then
reinstalled by a judge in Alameda County court.
Nor has the focus of campus attention had a chance
to shift this fall. Gravely, who faced a recall election
last Friday, will return to Alameda County court on

Oct. 5 and will again face the judicial committee in a
few weeks.
The dispute hinges around charges brought against
Gravely last spring that his campaign overspent its
$100 limit and that it submitted false spending records.
After enduring several challenges late in spring and
early this summer, though, Gravely was still in office
when students returned this fall.
However, a group calling themselves Students
Against Corrupt Politicians succeeded in calling a recall
election. Students turned out in record numbers and
voted in favor of the recall — 54 percent voting for and

46 percent against — but Gravely "won" the election
since the move required a two-thirds majority.
Now the major threat to his reign in office appears to
be a suit filed in county court by Tim DeWiu, a loser in
last spring's campaign. That issue will go before a judge
next Friday.
Squeaky clean marchers
But Cal cannot seem to figure out the proper place to
be disorderly and the proper place to be disciplined.
A recent article in the Daily Californian illustrates
the regimentation that members of the Berkeley
Marching Band must endure.
"The traditional, military-styled uniforms, complete
with plume, must be clean and pressed. Because the
elaborate uniforms have over 20 separate pieces,
bandmembers take great care to ensure an exact

standard appearance," states the campus newspaper.
The paper goes on to describe how hand members
must use a marker to keep the "Nike" brand name on
their asto-turf cleats black and submit to pregame
uniform inspections with "on-the-spot remedies" for
those deemed unacceptable.
Prof, says hot heads excel
The bookstore may start selling more stocking caps if
students take to heart the findings of a professor at the
University of Southern California.
In a series of experiments, Peter Hancock, a psycho
physiologist and professor of safety and human
factors at USC, found that heating a subject's head
produced a 5 to 15 percent increase in the speed in
which he performed mental tasks.
Hancock studied the effects of head heating on 50
subjects. Each person performed certain tasks wearing a
laboratory heating helmet which raised their head
temperature one degree Celcius, wearing a helmet that
actually did no heating and wearing no helmet at all.
He theorizes that this knowledge could have wide

commercial and military uses, and attributes the
longer life span of women compared to men and their
greater efficiency at certain tasks to their higher resting
temperatures.

The Mural Majority
Fraternity controversy at Stanford is a drab affair
compared with the excitement at the University of
Pennsylvania.
Problems at Penn started when Delta Upsilon
fraternity brothers painted a colorful mural on the front
of their university-owned house early this summer,
112 raternity and Sorority Affairs Director Rebecca
Reuling acquired a dislike for the mural, labelled it
"inappropriate' and ordered fraternity leaders to paint
over it by Sept. 5.
The DUs refused and the university said it would
hire a painting contractor to paint the house.
The DUs, though, did not take the decision lying
down. Stating that the mural "represents the diffusion
of liberal culture," the fraternity brothers collected
more than 300 signatures on a petition to save the
mural and constructed a barricade in front of their
house the night before the Sept. 5 deadline. One DU

member spent the night in a hand-made cage to protest
the university's decision, and a photograph on page one
of The Daily Pennsylvanian showed DU brother Larry
Linick with an axe on his shoulder standing guard
beside a sign reading, "You will not paint over the art."
Last week, a compromise solution was reached. The
university covered the mural with a preservative and

painted over it. The mural will remain covered until the
residential buildings office rules on whether fraternities
and sororities can paint their own houses.
Even that answer was too much for Linick. He flew
into a rage when the mural was covered and
"graffitified the entire upstairs of the frat," said Ames
Alexander of The Daily Pennsylvanian.
Alexander described Linick, who was ousted from
the DUs for his actions, as "a colorful character."
Striking against the Ivy
Now they know what it feels like.
With a strike by Yale University's 2,650 clerical and
technical workers, Yale students, like Stanford students
two years ago, have no food service.
The employees — including secretaries, research
assistants, telephone operators and computer program
mers — went on strike yesterday after negotiations
between the workers and the university broke off late
Tuesday night.
The workers, who earn an average of $13,424 now,
want a three-year contract, across-the-board salary
increases, step raises totaling 38 percent, and as
surances that no layoffs will result from implementing
the additional requested expenditures.
Yale plans to have management employees take over
some of the jobs of strikers, and students will receive
money for off-campus dining.
University of Confusion
Last spring, a survey of students at the University of
California at Berkeley found them so apathetic about
student government that many could not recall the
name of the president of the Associated Students of the
University of California at Berkeley (ASUC).
Mike Gravely changed all that last spring when he
was elected ASUC president, disqualified by the ASUC
Judicial Committee, reinstated by the same committee,
disqualified again in a separate hearing and then
reinstalled by a judge in Alameda County court.
Nor has the focus of campus attention had a chance
to shift this fall. Gravely, who faced a recall election
last Friday, will return to Alameda County court on

Oct. 5 and will again face the judicial committee in a
few weeks.
The dispute hinges around charges brought against
Gravely last spring that his campaign overspent its
$100 limit and that it submitted false spending records.
After enduring several challenges late in spring and
early this summer, though, Gravely was still in office
when students returned this fall.
However, a group calling themselves Students
Against Corrupt Politicians succeeded in calling a recall
election. Students turned out in record numbers and
voted in favor of the recall — 54 percent voting for and

46 percent against — but Gravely "won" the election
since the move required a two-thirds majority.
Now the major threat to his reign in office appears to
be a suit filed in county court by Tim DeWiu, a loser in
last spring's campaign. That issue will go before a judge
next Friday.
Squeaky clean marchers
But Cal cannot seem to figure out the proper place to
be disorderly and the proper place to be disciplined.
A recent article in the Daily Californian illustrates
the regimentation that members of the Berkeley
Marching Band must endure.
"The traditional, military-styled uniforms, complete
with plume, must be clean and pressed. Because the
elaborate uniforms have over 20 separate pieces,
bandmembers take great care to ensure an exact

standard appearance," states the campus newspaper.
The paper goes on to describe how hand members
must use a marker to keep the "Nike" brand name on
their asto-turf cleats black and submit to pregame
uniform inspections with "on-the-spot remedies" for
those deemed unacceptable.
Prof, says hot heads excel
The bookstore may start selling more stocking caps if
students take to heart the findings of a professor at the
University of Southern California.
In a series of experiments, Peter Hancock, a psycho
physiologist and professor of safety and human
factors at USC, found that heating a subject's head
produced a 5 to 15 percent increase in the speed in
which he performed mental tasks.
Hancock studied the effects of head heating on 50
subjects. Each person performed certain tasks wearing a
laboratory heating helmet which raised their head
temperature one degree Celcius, wearing a helmet that
actually did no heating and wearing no helmet at all.
He theorizes that this knowledge could have wide

commercial and military uses, and attributes the
longer life span of women compared to men and their
greater efficiency at certain tasks to their higher resting
temperatures.
