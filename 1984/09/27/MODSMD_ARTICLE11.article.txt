They probably got in your way at registration
this week. You had to weave through their tables,
stepping over their posters and t-shirts, avoiding
eye contact, trying to get into Maples. Finally,
you got inside and headed downstairs, but there it
was again: another table and some guy trying to
get you to register to vote. "C'mon," you
thought. "I've got more important things to do."
Wrong.
Voting is the most important thing you'll do
this year.
Voting in America isn't just a right or a
privilege. It's a duty. And whether you're set for
'Four More Years' or 'No Mo Ron', you owe it to
yourself, and the rest of us, to add your vote to
the totals in November.
Those who don't vote in an election have no
right to be anything other than meekly content
with their leaders and policies.
Oct. 9 is the last day to register for the
presidential election. And because registration is

so simple — just fill out a card at the post office
or at one of the political-action booths on campus
— there's really no excuse for not registering.
That part's easy.
What's not so easy is actually getting involved.
In these early days of autumn, it's easy for frater
nity parties to seem more important than political
parties, and a run to the Dish outweighs a run for
office.
It's easy to say we're too busy to get involved,
too busy to make the commitment to change at
least a little part of the world. But it's time to sub
stitute political activism for reactive whining and
to do something to back up the claim that today's
young people are tomorrow's leaders.
Finally, after an era of contentment — or at
least quiet tolerance — growing numbers of stu
dents are once again taking that step, moving
from apathy to activism, and getting involved.
They're the people who were in our way at
Maples. And with any luck, they'll stay in our
way until we join them.
