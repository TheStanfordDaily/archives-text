## Reaganomics: Let's give it four more years 
### 
The apparent success of Keynesian economic policy in
freeing America from the Great Depression securely es
tablished it as the predominant economic theory of the
times. From their entrenched posts, its exponents have,
for the past few decades, doled out demand-side policy
prescriptions for America's economic ills. By the late
19705, it became increasingly obvious that the protec
tionist tariffs, steeply progressive tax schedules, and
generous government spending programs engineered by

the empowered economists acted more to exacerbate than
to alleviate the economic evils of recession and stagfla
tion. In the resulting whirlwind of dissatisfaction, the
American electorate chose a president who promised to
attack these problems from a different angle: the supply
side.
Whenever there is a change at the helm, those newly
"out-of-power" inevitably spew forth a mountain of dark,
dire predictions about what shall result from the policy of
those newly in power; and this was no exception. In the

aftermath of the 1980 election, the non-supply-siders
forecast a myriad of unpleasantries as a consequence of
Reagan's across-the-board tax cuts. According to
Keynesian theory, for example, a tax cut combined with
reductions in government spending would decrease ag
gregate demand, causing a slowing of the economy as
people save some of the money that would have been
spent by the government.
The crucial factors of incentive and disincentive,
however, play no role in this analysis. This omission con
stitutes the basic flaw of the Keynesian dialectic, and it ex
plains why we are experiencing an economic renaissance
today instead of the predicted worsening of the recession.
What is this "incentive," and how does it fit into the
supply side argument?
Paradoxically, the effect is most clearly demonstrated
by considering the effect of tax cuts on wealthy individ
uals. The incredibly high tax rates in higher incomes com
pel wealthy persons with no tax shelters to work over six
months of the year for Uncle Sam. As such, they have a
large incentive to expend time, energy, and money

looking for imaginative ways to deflate their taxable
incomes. Moreover, they have virtually no incentive to
work harder or more efficiently, since most of the addi
tional income would be ingested by the IRS anyway.
An across-the-board tax reduction encourages the rich
person to spend less time looking for tax shelters, less time
at the regatta, less time testing the new Rolls Royce, and
more time working. As money pours out of tax shelters,
and as incomes increase, tax revenues from higher tax
brackets actually increase.

But this is not at the expense of middle- and lower
income groups who never needed to look for tax shelters.
The more gradual tax rate schedule encourages them to
improve their productivity, to work harder and to spend
less time at leisure, since the tax reduction allows them to
keep a larger chunk of the fruits of their labor. The macro
economic impact of this incentive is to increase the ag
gregate supply of goods and services, producing a natural
economic growth that can be more permanent and stable
than artificial stimulation of the economy resulting from
the Keynesian efforts to tamper with aggregate demand.
By increasing the proportion of income a taxpayer is
allowed to keep, tax reductions also provide an incentive
to work relative to collecting unemployment benefits or

operating in an underground economy. As lower taxes
make work more appealing and income tax evasion less
profitable, trimming entitlement programs makes un
employment less appealing. This, combined with eco
nomic growth, will help the recovery fuel itself. The cor
responding decrease in unemployment will lighten the
burden of the unemployed.
Finally, tax reductions encourage investment relative to
consumption. Those who have money to invest face a
choice: invest, or spend the money on leisure or luxury

items. Lower taxes on income received through invest
ment help tip the balance in favor of investment, encour
aging risk-taking and entrepreneurship.
All this supply-side economic verbage is not without
historical substantiation. The most frequently cited macro
economic test of supply-side theory occurred when
Keynesian and supply-side theories prescribed the same
policy: the Kennedy tax cuts of 1962 and 1964. Though
the economic environment in which we live today is quite
different, the Kennedy tax cuts were similar to those pro
posed and enacted by Reagan in that they were significant
across-the-board cuts at a time of economic contraction.
What happened? Well, climbing inflation rates soon
became dropping inflation rates. GNP growth finally out

stripped growth in government spending. And, as money
began flowing out of tax shelters back onto IRS forms, tax
revenue from incomes over $100,000 actually increased
from $2.3 billion in 1962 to $3.8 billion in 1965. But the
Vietnam War, Johnson's Great Society program, and
tighter restrictions on industry brought us back to a world
of increasing taxes and economic difficulties.
In concert with the tight-money policy envisioned by
Milton Friedman, ordered by Reagan, and implemented
by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, the
most recent test of supply-side economics has once again
proven itself effective. Inflation and its associated prob
lems have all but disappeared. Real purchasing power is
up. Investment is strong, and confidence among business
men that the recovery will continue is strong. Unemploy
ment is stabilized at the 7 to 8 percent level.
"But," you say, "Reaganomics has produced a record
deficit." I agree that a significant budget deficit presents a
problem in the long-run. The question now is: how do we
deal with it?

Inflation and its associated
problems have all but disap
peared. Real purchasing
power is up. Investment is
strong, and confidence
among businessmen that the
recovery will continue is
strong.

As voters in the November election, we are faced with
choosing between the two leading candidates. According
to Reagan, we should stave off our impulses to increase
taxes, and we should continue budget-cutting efforts that
were blocked by the last Congress. We should stay the
course on monetary policy, allowing only for moderate
growth in the money supply. These measures should
allow the recovery to continue at a modest pace
while keeping the deficit from expanding in the short
term, providing a healthy economic base from which to at
tack the deficit problem in the long run.
Alternatively, we could elect Walter Mondale, who
would return us to the economic policy of the Carter
years. Big government and higher taxes are economic
tools already tried and discarded. To revert back to the
old economic policy of tax and spend is to revert back to
recession and inflation. The Reagan plan is no sure bet,
but at least it's not doomed to failure.
