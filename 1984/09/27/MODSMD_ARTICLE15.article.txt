## Liberace just won't do 
### 
At nearly every level of ath
letics, the question of how much
effect a coach has on whether a
team wins or loses always seems to
arise. Which means more, the tal
ent of the players or the person
who fills out the lineup card?
Three weeks ago, if someone
had asked me that question, I
would have answered emphati
cally, "The talent." If a team has a
lot of talent, it is going to win. The
Detroit Tigers could have been
coached by Liberace or 7.7. Top
this year and still would have won
the American League East title.
I realize that some of you are
already listing your favorite
coaches. Vince Lombardi, Tom
Landry, Red Auerbach, Chuck
Noll, Earl Weaver, Bobby Knight
. .. yes, I know who those guys
are. However, I would say that
most of them were architects of
powerful teams.
They won because they were
able to put together teams with
jreat talent. As with Noll, if you
have players like Jack Lambert,
Mean Joe Greene and Mel Blount,
you're not going to lose too much.
Noll didn't.
Likewise is the case if you don't
have much talent. You're not
going to win too much. Just ask
anyone who managed the San
Diego Padres during the '70s. Or
ask whoever manages the San
Francisco Giants next year.
In the case of Stanford football,
I thought that was the problem last
year. I came to the conclusion that
the Cardinal was outmanned at
most positions. The offensive line
was slow, the quarterback was in
experienced and the running at
tack lacked a powerful back.
Before this season, I anticipated
another rough year for the Car
dinal. With its usually brutal
schedule, a 2-9 or 3-8 was in the
realm of possibilities. If Stanford
could win four games, I would
have been very surprised.
Even Head Coach Jack Elway
said it was going to take a while.
He figured it would take at least a
couple of recruiting classes to get
Stanford up to the ability of most
of its opponents.
That was what I thought three

weeks ago and. well, I've changed
my mind.
Why? Have 1 jumped on the El
way bandwagon? Is Stanford not
only going to host the Super Bowl,
but maybe even play in it?
No. But because of Elway, the
Cardinal now has the ability to
play better football. Four or five
wins is now in the realm of possi
bilities. Six wins would surprise
me.
Elway hasn't done anything
magical or illegal. Fred Dean isn't
playing for Stanford under an
assumed name and 1 haven't seen
Jack rip out anybody's heart and
then fry it in lava. But one never
knows.
What Elway has done was best
explained by sophomore wide
receiver Jeff James. "This team
has a lot of character. A lot more
than last year. Last year we'd get
behind and want to lay down and
die," he said.
Confidence. Elway exudes it.
He's the type of person who seems
to say, "You might be better than
me, but I'm not just going to lose,
you're going to have to beat me."
That distinction might only seem
semantic, but it has meaning in the
terms of sports psychology.
Stanford football players now
believe that they can play against
anybody. There doesn't seem to
be the inferiority complex of a
year ago. Last season, the excuse
was always, "Well, we didn't exe
cute this properly," or "We missed
the coverage,"or "We didn't read
the play."
As one player commented
about last year, "When he (former
Coach Paul Wiggin) got mad about
something, you were never quite
sure if it was an act or not." For all
fine qualities that Wiggin has as a
human being, he wasn't able to in
still confidence or a winning atti
tude in his players.
Wiggin said things like, "If we
execute this and do this, we can
win." Elway says simply, "We can
win," and then does it.
Now don't expect cardinal red
to start looking rosy red. But you
can probably expect a better team.
Like I always say, coaching is
more important than talent.
