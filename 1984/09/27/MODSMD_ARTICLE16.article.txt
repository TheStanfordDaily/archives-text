## Pacific 10 could go to the Dogs 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
You can spend all day debating
how good or bad each football team is
in the Pacific 10 Conference. But
when it comes to debating how good
the Pac-10 is compared to other con
ferences, you can spend all of about
10 seconds.
Top to bottom, the Pac-10 is the
best football conference in America.
Period.
And for Stanford, trying
desperately (and so far succeeding) to
improve on last season s 1-10 fiasco,
that means more tough games. The
Cardinal closed a three-game non
conference schedule that included
powerhouses Oklahoma and Illinois
with a 28-27 victory over San Jose
State Saturday. Now it opens the Pac
-10 campaign against Arizona State
(this Saturday), UCLA and Washing
ton — all pre-season top-20 teams.
No room for breathing. A lot of
room for losing.
"Talking to other coaches, op
timism is running very high in the
whole Pac-10," says Arizona Coach
Larry Smith. "1 think you're looking
at six or seven teams that will have
winning records and maybe five
teams in bowl games."
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks con
curs. "1 believe the league is going to
be better than it was a year ago," he
says."The competition for the league
title will probably include more teams
than it did a year ago and the battle
will be a very heated one."
As many as five teams have serious
Rose Bowl aspirations and may very
well finish the season ranked in the
top 20. Unlike in past years, however,
they'll be doing their winning with
defense. The offensive stars have
graduated to the professional ranks,
leaving this seasons' headlines to
names like David Fulcher, Jack Del
Rio, Neal Delloncono and Ron
Holmes.
Below is a team-by-team rundown
of the 1984 season in predicted order
of finish.
Washington
Last year: 8-4 (5-2, 2nd)
This year. 3-0 (0-0)
It's been said that Washington
Coach Don James doesn't rebuild, he
just reloads. The 1984 season is no
exception.
The Huskies lost 11 starters from a
1983 team that dropped a 13-10
decision to Penn State in the Aloha
Bowl. Among those who graduated

were quarterback Steve Pelluer, the
Pac-10 Player of the Year, and Ster
ling Hinds, the Huskies' leading rus
her.
For almost any other team, that
would be imminent disaster. For
James and his Huskies, it is no prob
lem.
Running backs Jacque Robinson
and Cookie Jackson are better than
adequate replacements for the fleet
tooted Hinds, and junior quarterback
Hugh Millen, though he's no Pelluer,
is holding his own.
Washington is undefeated this
season (including a win over Mich
igan at Michigan) and with its cushy
schedule (it doesn't play UCLA or
Arizona State), it might be a while
before the Huskies lose again. Like
next season.
UCLA
Last year: 7-4-1 (6-1-1, Ist)
This yean 2-1 (0-0)
UCLA hasn't had great teams in
the past three years, but in that time it
has chalked up a 33-11-3 record and
won two Rose Bowls. Somehow,
somewhere, the Bruins find a way to
win.
Take last year, for example, when
UCLA started off with a 0-3-1 record
and then turned around to win seven
of its final eight, including a 45-9 em
barrassment of Illinois in the Rose
Bowl.
The Bruins undoubtedly have the
talent to do that again this season, as
50 lettermen and 12 starters are back.
Scott Bono may be the best quarter
back in the conference and wide
receiver Mike Sherrard was All-Pac
-10 last year as a sophomore. Four of
five starters on the offensive line
return including tackle Duval Love.
The defense is headlined by
linebacker Delloncono.
While the talent is there, the
schedule is not. The Bruins play
Washington State, Arizona State and
USC — and not Washington. UCLA,
ranked No. 1 in Sports Illustrated's
pre-season poll, will go to a bowl
game this season. It just won't be the
Rose Bowl.
USC
Last Year: 4-6-1 (4-3, 4th)
This Year: 2-0 (0-0)
USC Coach Ted Tollner didn't
hide his feelings about last season, the
Trojans' worst in 22 years. "I was dis
appointed as everyone else about last
fall," he said. "But we're coming
back in 1984 with a vengeance."

Indeed they are. The Trojans
return 17 starters, including nine on
offense. However, senior quarterback
Sean Salisbury went down in Satur
day's 6-3 win at Arizona State with
his umpteenth knee injury and may
miss the rest of the season.
But the way tailback Zeph Lee has
been running (he's averaging 112 5
yards a game and 8.3 yards a carry),
USC may not have to pass again this
season. The defense is just as tough;
the entire line returns along with All-
America linebacker candidates Del
Rio and Duane Bickett.
The Trojans will have to save their

best for last — they close the season
against Washington, UCLA and
Notre Dame, in that order. If they
can beat Washington and UCLA,
they'll be smelling roses Jan. 1.
Arizona State
Last Year: 6-4-1 (3-3-1, 6th)
This Year: 1-2 (0-1)
The Sun Devils are capable of
beating anyone in the Pac-10, but
first Coach Darryl Rogers will have to
get the defense and the offense to
play well on the same night.

UCLA junior wide receiver Mike Sherrard walked on to the Bruin team
and will be one of the few offensive players to walk all over the
defense-oriented teams of the Pacific 10 Conference.
