## Pacific 10 could go to the Dogs 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
You can spend all day debating
how good or bad each football team is
in the Pacific 10 Conference. But
when it comes to debating how good
the Pac-10 is compared to other con
ferences, you can spend all of about
10 seconds.
Top to bottom, the Pac-10 is the
best football conference in America.
Period.
And for Stanford, trying
desperately (and so far succeeding) to
improve on last season s 1-10 fiasco,
that means more tough games. The
Cardinal closed a three-game non
conference schedule that included
powerhouses Oklahoma and Illinois
with a 28-27 victory over San Jose
State Saturday. Now it opens the Pac
-10 campaign against Arizona State
(this Saturday), UCLA and Washing
ton — all pre-season top-20 teams.
No room for breathing. A lot of
room for losing.
"Talking to other coaches, op
timism is running very high in the
whole Pac-10," says Arizona Coach
Larry Smith. "1 think you're looking
at six or seven teams that will have
winning records and maybe five
teams in bowl games."
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks con
curs. "1 believe the league is going to
be better than it was a year ago," he
says."The competition for the league
title will probably include more teams
than it did a year ago and the battle
will be a very heated one."
As many as five teams have serious
Rose Bowl aspirations and may very
well finish the season ranked in the
top 20. Unlike in past years, however,
they'll be doing their winning with
defense. The offensive stars have
graduated to the professional ranks,
leaving this seasons' headlines to
names like David Fulcher, Jack Del
Rio, Neal Delloncono and Ron
Holmes.
Below is a team-by-team rundown
of the 1984 season in predicted order
of finish.
Washington
Last year: 8-4 (5-2, 2nd)
This year. 3-0 (0-0)
It's been said that Washington
Coach Don James doesn't rebuild, he
just reloads. The 1984 season is no
exception.
The Huskies lost 11 starters from a
1983 team that dropped a 13-10
decision to Penn State in the Aloha
Bowl. Among those who graduated

were quarterback Steve Pelluer, the
Pac-10 Player of the Year, and Ster
ling Hinds, the Huskies' leading rus
her.
For almost any other team, that
would be imminent disaster. For
James and his Huskies, it is no prob
lem.
Running backs Jacque Robinson
and Cookie Jackson are better than
adequate replacements for the fleet
tooted Hinds, and junior quarterback
Hugh Millen, though he's no Pelluer,
is holding his own.
Washington is undefeated this
season (including a win over Mich
igan at Michigan) and with its cushy
schedule (it doesn't play UCLA or
Arizona State), it might be a while
before the Huskies lose again. Like
next season.
UCLA
Last year: 7-4-1 (6-1-1, Ist)
This yean 2-1 (0-0)
UCLA hasn't had great teams in
the past three years, but in that time it
has chalked up a 33-11-3 record and
won two Rose Bowls. Somehow,
somewhere, the Bruins find a way to
win.
Take last year, for example, when
UCLA started off with a 0-3-1 record
and then turned around to win seven
of its final eight, including a 45-9 em
barrassment of Illinois in the Rose
Bowl.
The Bruins undoubtedly have the
talent to do that again this season, as
50 lettermen and 12 starters are back.
Scott Bono may be the best quarter
back in the conference and wide
receiver Mike Sherrard was All-Pac
-10 last year as a sophomore. Four of
five starters on the offensive line
return including tackle Duval Love.
The defense is headlined by
linebacker Delloncono.
While the talent is there, the
schedule is not. The Bruins play
Washington State, Arizona State and
USC — and not Washington. UCLA,
ranked No. 1 in Sports Illustrated's
pre-season poll, will go to a bowl
game this season. It just won't be the
Rose Bowl.
USC
Last Year: 4-6-1 (4-3, 4th)
This Year: 2-0 (0-0)
USC Coach Ted Tollner didn't
hide his feelings about last season, the
Trojans' worst in 22 years. "I was dis
appointed as everyone else about last
fall," he said. "But we're coming
back in 1984 with a vengeance."

Indeed they are. The Trojans
return 17 starters, including nine on
offense. However, senior quarterback
Sean Salisbury went down in Satur
day's 6-3 win at Arizona State with
his umpteenth knee injury and may
miss the rest of the season.
But the way tailback Zeph Lee has
been running (he's averaging 112 5
yards a game and 8.3 yards a carry),
USC may not have to pass again this
season. The defense is just as tough;
the entire line returns along with All-
America linebacker candidates Del
Rio and Duane Bickett.
The Trojans will have to save their

best for last — they close the season
against Washington, UCLA and
Notre Dame, in that order. If they
can beat Washington and UCLA,
they'll be smelling roses Jan. 1.
Arizona State
Last Year: 6-4-1 (3-3-1, 6th)
This Year: 1-2 (0-1)
The Sun Devils are capable of
beating anyone in the Pac-10, but
first Coach Darryl Rogers will have to
get the defense and the offense to
play well on the same night.


Art Streiber/Daily file
UCLA junior wide receiver Mike Sherrard walked on to the Bruin team
and will be one of the few offensive players to walk all over the
defense-oriented teams of the Pacific 10 Conference.
Arizona State lost its opener, 45-3,
to Oklahoma State, then rebounded
the next week to blast San Jose State,
48-0. Saturday, against USC, it was
back to the all-defense, no-offense
look, and the Sun Devils lost, 6-3.
The wild, blitzing defense is the
strength of this team. On offense, the
Sun Devils have a fine running attack,
but no quarterback. Still, Rogers
must feel like a detective unraveling a
mystery, not a football coach.
Arizona
Last Year: 6-4-1 (3-3-1, 6th)
This Year: 2-2 (2-0)
The Wildcats were supposed to be
great last season and, for a while, they

were. Although on probation,
Arizona won its first four games by
scores of 50-6, 38-0, 45-6 and 37-10.
Then the roof fell in.
The Widcats are off probation this
season and, despite losing 10 starters,
Coach Larry Smith has rebuilt the
roof to some extent. Making things
that much brighter is their schedule.
They won't get really tested until the
end of October, when they play back
to-back away games against USC and
Washington.
Until then. Arizona will continue
to win. And when the roof falls in this
time, the Wildcats will probably have
won enough games to ensure them
another winning season. But sorry, no
bowl game here.
Washington State
Last Year: 7-4 (5-3, 3rd)
This Year: 2-2 (0-0)

The Washington State Cougars
have a bit of a problem. They have
big-time talent on their football team,
but no big-time media coverage. No
one takes the team from the Palouse
seriously.
Probably the best team in the con
ference at the end of last season
(WSU closed out the campaign with
five straight victories, including
Washington), the Cougars finished 7-
4. third place in the Pac-10, and went
nowhere. '
Four of their top five rushers, all
five top pass recievers and their
second string quarterback (who can
also run the ball) are back. The
defense is solid as well, with six re
turning starters.
Justifiably so, the Cougars are the
sleeper of the conference. Whether or
not they'll wake up is another ques
tion.

Stanford
l ast Year: 1-10(1-7, 10(h)
This Year: 2-1 (0-0)
Going from dead last to seventh
would he an accomplishment in itself
for Stanford and first-year Coach
Jack Elway. Finishing higher is not
out the question, though.
Stanford's biggest problem will be
scoring points. Granted, the John
Paye-led offense is potent, but most
everyone in the Pac-10 plays defense
this year and the days of Stanford just
outscoring the opponent, at least for
now, are over. The defense is the best
it's been in years, but hasn't been
tested like it will be in the coming
weeks.
Still, an upset here, an upset there
;ind the Cardinal could be in the thick
of things. Then again, it might lose to
Oregon State for the second straight
season.

Oregon
Last Year: 4-6-1 (3-3-1, 6th)
This Year: 3-0 (1-0)
The talk up north is that eighth
year Coach Rich Brooks has his best
team yet
The Ducks are off to a 3-0 start
and, with a gimme against Pacific this
Saturday, they are sure to be 4-0.
Oregon boasts a defense that returns
eight starters and an offense that
features flanker Lew "Instant Of
fense" Barnes.
Nonetheless, the Ducks probably
won't win again until Nov. 17, their
final game of the season. That's when
they play Oregon State.
California
Last Year: 5-5-1 (3-4-1, Bth)
This Year: 1-2 (0-2)
Joe Kapp enters his third year as
Cal's head man. His winning-with

mirrors tricks may have worked for
two seasons, but for a third? Probably
not.
Gale Ciilbert and the rest of Kapp's
AirCal offense haven't even got off
the ground against teams like Oregon
and Pacific. So what's going to hap
pen against UCLA, (JSC, Washing
ton, and Arizona State?
Oregon State
Last Year: 2-8-1 (1-6-1, 9th)
This Year: 1-2 (0-1)
For the first time in five years,
Oregon State didn't finish in the Pac
-10 cellar last season. And for the first
time in nearly four years, the Beavers
won a conference game (over Stan
ford, 31-18).
Neither of those things will happen
again this season. Fifth-year Coach
Joe Avezzano can start updating his
resume.
