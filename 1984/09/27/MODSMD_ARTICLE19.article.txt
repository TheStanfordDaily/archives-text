# Poloists will try to crash the Waves
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
Stanford's No. 5-ranked water polo
team will try to rebound from Satur
day's 7-4 upset loss to Fresno State
today. Unfortunately, the Cardinal
will have a rather tough time, as it
hosts top-ranked Pepperdine Univer
sity.
The Waves are the only remaining
unbeaten team in the nation's top 10,
with a record of 9-0-2. But with some
of the players that they have, it might
be more appropriate to rank them in
ternationally.
Pepperdine has eight players from
outside the continental United States.
Four are from Puerto Rico and an
other four are from Yugoslavia.
This imported talent is also very
talented. Two of the Puerto Ricans
played on their territory's Pan Amer
ican team in 1983. All four Yugo
slavians were members of their na
tion's gold medal-winning Olympic
squad, although none of them played,

according to Coach Dante Detta
manti.
"We played them early last year
and lost, 7-5. We've gotten a lot more
experienced since then, but they've
also picked up all those recruits," said
Dettamanti. The Waves have also
recruited holeman Mike Grier.
Grier, a senior transfer from the
University of California at Berkeley,
is the center of Pepperdine's offense.
"They'll go to him most of the time,
but they also have really good outside
shooting," said Dettamanti.
The Waves will try to get the Car
dinal into foul trouble and thereby
force switching on defense. "They
score most of their goals off switching
by the defense. If you get into foul
trouble you can't keep the same
people covering," said Dettamanti.
"We're going to have to play our
best to win. But we usually play bet
ter against good teams," said Detta
manti. The game begins at 3 p.m. at
DeGuerre Pool.
