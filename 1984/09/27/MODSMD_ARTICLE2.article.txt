# New housing plan moves toward OK
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
When University plans for the
$100 million Stanford West housing
complex were shelved last year, Stan
ford real estate officials began devot
ing their time and energy to a more
modest housing project in the same
area.
Their efforts are currently being
studied by the Palo Alto Architectural
Review Board. The board will make
recommendations to the city council,
whose approval is required before
construction can begin on the 150-
unit housing facility at 1100 Welch
Road, where Welch intersects with
Pasteur Drive.
Plans for Stanford West, mean
while, are temporarily gone but cer
tainly not forgotten. University offi
cials say those plans have been placed
on the back burner while staff con
centrates on the 1100 Welch Road
project.
The University brought the Stan
ford West plan to Palo Alto last sum
mer for review. More than 1,100
units were proposed for 46 acres of
land on Sand Hill Road (formerly
Willow Road), nestled between the
Oak Creek Apartments and the Stan
ford Children's Hospital.
University officials had hoped the
complex would serve as a solution to
the lack of affordable faculty and staff
housing near campus.
The Palo Alto City Council ap

proved plans for the project but at
tached conditions the University
characterized as unreasonable. The
University then decided to put Stan
ford West on indefinite hold last fall.
Niel Davidson, director of housing
development, said the University will
wait to hear the status of the 1100
Welch Road project before it
reintroduces Stanford West to the
city.
"A lot depends on how easily and
well that [project] goes," Davidson
said. He said Stanford West will
"follow behind" an agreement on the
1100 Welch Road plan.
But Davidson added that, if Palo
Alto rejects the Welch Road project,
or if it again attaches "unreasonable"
conditions, Stanford West may still
return to the agenda. "It's not really
the case that Stanford West is contin
gent upon 1100 Welch Road,"
Davidson said.
The University submitted plans for
the 4.3-acre site, slated to cost ap
proximately $12 million, to the city in
July. Davidson hopes to have an an
swer from the city by December, and,
if possible, to begin construction in
spring. He said the project will take
18 months to complete.
Plans for 1100 Welch Road include
108 studio, one- and two-bedroom
rental apartments in six three-story
buildings. An additional 42
"hometel" units, designed to accom
modate medical center outpatients
and their families, will also be on the
grounds.
Davidson said the studios will
range from $400 to $500 per month
and the two-bedrooms will run up to
$900 per month.
He said the University undertook
the 1100 Welch Road project, which
was originally a 195-unit complex
grouped with Stanford West, when it
became apparent that no suitable

agreement would he reached on Stan
ford West.
"We spent an awful lot of money
working on Stanford West, and it just
wasn't moving ahead fast enough,"
Davidson said. "We didn't want to
continue spending money on that de
velopment.
"When the decision was made to
shelve Stanford West, the question
was what housing would be
reasonable to proceed with. This is a
more reasonably sized project," he
said.
Stanford West fell through last fall
because Palo Alto attached a condi
tion asserting city control of an 86-

acre parcel of land bordering Sand
Hill Road, according to University
officials. The University is currently
planning to use that land for aca
demic purposes in the near future.
"The University couldn't accept
those conditions," said Andy Doty,
University director of community re
lations. "Those lands are outside of
the city.
"It was the stipulations placed on
the 86 acres that caused the Univer
sity to say, 'I'm sorry, we can't go for
ward' " with Stanford West, Doty
said.
The city also balked at the size of
the project, contending it would in

crease traffic in the Sand Hill
corridor-Stanford Shopping Center
area.
Davidson said the proposed 1100
Welch Road project should not pose
such a problem because it is so much
smaller than Stanford West.
"There's just no comparison in the
category of development between
Welch Road and Stanford West,"
Davidson said.
Doty said that unless the Univer
sity and the city can come to terms on
some plans for the 86 acres, the issue
may re-emerge when the University
reintroduces Stanford West to the
council.

"We spent an awful lot of money
working on Stanford West, and it just
wasn't moving ahead fast enough,"
Davidson said. "We didn't want to
continue spending money on that de
velopment.
"When the decision was made to
shelve Stanford West, the question
was what housing would be
reasonable to proceed with. This is a
more reasonably sized project," he
said.
Stanford West fell through last fall
because Palo Alto attached a condi
tion asserting city control of an 86-

acre parcel of land bordering Sand
Hill Road, according to University
officials. The University is currently
planning to use that land for aca
demic purposes in the near future.
"The University couldn't accept
those conditions," said Andy Doty,
University director of community re
lations. "Those lands are outside of
the city.
"It was the stipulations placed on
the 86 acres that caused the Univer
sity to say, 'I'm sorry, we can't go for
ward' " with Stanford West, Doty
said.
The city also balked at the size of
the project, contending it would in

crease traffic in the Sand Hill
corridor-Stanford Shopping Center
area.
Davidson said the proposed 1100
Welch Road project should not pose
such a problem because it is so much
smaller than Stanford West.
"There's just no comparison in the
category of development between
Welch Road and Stanford West,"
Davidson said.
Doty said that unless the Univer
sity and the city can come to terms on
some plans for the 86 acres, the issue
may re-emerge when the University
reintroduces Stanford West to the
council.
