## 'Soldier's Play' opens at the Stanford 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE Daily staff 
Tlie Andrews Sisters sing as the
lights go down. When the spots come
up, and a black man in a sergeant's
uniform is illuminated. We know the
setting is the segregated U.S. Army of
World War 11. The sergeant is drunk,
he staggers. And then he rears up and
shouts a single sentence, three times.
"They still hate you" he yells, and
bitterness increases with each ut
terance. A shot rings out and he falls.
With the second shot, the lights go
out.
So opens "A Soldier's Play," being
performed at the Stanford Theatre
this and next week. With its trou
bling, painful themes, Charles Ful
ler's drama won the Pulitzer Prize in
1982. Now the Negro Ensemble
Company has come to the newly
renovated theater on University Ave
nue to present this mystery play to
Bay Area audiences. Structuring its
story around the investigation into

the murder of Tech/Sergeant Vernon
Waters, Fuller's play raises urgent,
challenging questions about the way
blacks should go about gaining
respect and achieving success in white
America.
A black captain, Richard Daven
port, is assigned to investigate the
murder. He persists despite the oppo
sition of white officers, and begins to
discover the peculiarities of Sergeant
Waters' character. Waters, it turns
out, has a whole philosophy about
how he should behave in order to
reach a position of equality, but that
view involves reforming the behavior
and character of other blacks.
Waters' is a conformist, arguing
that the only way to gain the respect
of whites is to beat them at their own
game, to excel in the ways approved
by white society, without questioning
its rules. But he doesn't seem to
believe blacks can do this individu
ally. He believes that he will help the
position of the entire race by oppress

ing and reforming "geechies," his
term for blacks who perpetuate the
stereotype of blacks as subservient,
foolish, and nonaggressive.
This leads Waters to abuse his men,
and we see the conflicts and tensions
produced by that as Captain Daven
port interviews the members of his
all-black platoon, and their memories
are enacted on stage. The choices and
problems implicit in Waters' philoso
phy are exemplified by the different
characters in the platoon. But it is in
Captain Davenport, a black lawyer
and officer in a segregated army, that
the questions about conformity, and
the kinds of sacrifices and rewards it
involves, should be most apparent.
At this point I have some reserva
tions about both the script and the
performance 1 saw Tuesday. The way
the very important and difficult issues
raised by the character of Sergeant
Waters are addressed seems unsatis
factory. Now I don't expect that this
sort of thing would be resolved in the

play. Instead of sending some definite
message, a dramatic presentation like
this seems best suited to raising points
for reflection. But to do that success
fully, a playwright needs to single out
and define those points, and offer his
play in a way that will make the audi
ence want to reflect. The first task is
not accomplished successfully in this
script. And although the play is capa
ble of a production that gives the au
dience something to take home and
think abdut, the performance at the
Stanford doesn't emphasize that ele
ment.
The lack of definition is in part a
product of the way this story is told.
Though the sergeant explains himself
a few times, the other characters react
to his fairly well articulated position
only with emotion. No one, not even
Captain Davenport, attempts to
criticize his principles. This is disap
pointing because there are several
characters who might be expected to
question his views. In addition to the

articulate Davenport, there is Peter
son, a soldier who thinks that Waters
hates him, but whom Waters admires
because he fights back against the
sergeant. The company commander,
a West Point captain named Taylor,
has lines that indicate his scruples and
thoughtfulness about race relations,
but he is wasted in silly confronta
tions with Davenport that only bring
up more tough issues that the play
doesn't have time to resolve.
The performance at the Stanford
Theatre exacerbates this lack of
focus. Indeed, not only is there a lack
of emphasis on themes, but the en
ergy that would make the play a satis
tying drama is absent, too. The play is
supposed to be a murder mystery, but
the tension that needs to be estab
lished at the very outset is dissipated
in the play for laughs.
Let me be specific on this point.
After the opening murder scene, we
shift to the platoon barracks, where
Waters' men are searched for weap

oris to prevent revenge attempts, and
the murder itself is described. During
this scene the actors have to establish
our concern and curiosity about the
murder. The script calls for it to be
followed by a contrast scene, in which
the men, left alone by the officers,
show what should be surprising cal
lousness about the crime. During
those contrast scene, Corporal Cobb
(played by Ruben Hudson with good
comic sensibility) is supposed to
scratch his crotch and pick crab lice
off himself, while the other soldiers
comment on his ailment. In the per
formance Tuesday night, Hudson
began scratching even before the
description of the murder was com
pleted. This is clowning, not acting,
and it's the director's responsibility to
prevent it.
This kind of irresponsible treat
ment of the script was aggravated by
the encouragement the Tuesday audi
ence gave it. Yet that could have been
dismissed if the lead, Captain Daven

port (played by Geoffrey Ewing), had
been stronger. Reading the script,
one expects Davenport to have a sort
of chip on his shoulder. In his rela
tions with uncooperative white offi
cers, it seems not only more likely
that he should show tautness and en
ergy, but that kind of power is neces
sary to make his investigation seem
urgent, and give the plot some move
ment. Ewing may have wanted to offer
a less conventional and unpredictable
interpretation, but his pompous,
loose Davenport can't be accepted in
a play that already lacks drama.
Several of the actors, notably
Goldring, Ward and Duke,offer
solid, professional performances, but
they can't make up for the drive mis
sing in the performance as a whole.
"A Soldier's Play" raises important
issues, and is a significant play for
that reason alone. But the script does
not strike me as Pulitzer quality, and
the unfortunate performance Tues
day night makes its drawbacks even
clearer.

those contrast scene, Corporal Cobb
(played by Ruben Hudson with good
comic sensibility) is supposed to
scratch his crotch and pick crab lice
off himself, while the other soldiers
comment on his ailment. In the per
formance Tuesday night, Hudson
began scratching even before the
description of the murder was com
pleted. This is clowning, not acting,
and it's the director's responsibility to
prevent it.
This kind of irresponsible treat
ment of the script was aggravated by
the encouragement the Tuesday audi
ence gave it. Yet that could have been
dismissed if the lead, Captain Daven

port (played by Geoffrey Ewing), had
been stronger. Reading the script,
one expects Davenport to have a sort
of chip on his shoulder. In his rela
tions with uncooperative white offi
cers, it seems not only more likely
that he should show tautness and en
ergy, but that kind of power is neces
sary to make his investigation seem
urgent, and give the plot some move
ment. Ewing may have wanted to offer
a less conventional and unpredictable
interpretation, but his pompous,
loose Davenport can't be accepted in
a play that already lacks drama.
Several of the actors, notably
Goldring, Ward and Duke,offer
solid, professional performances, but
they can't make up for the drive mis
sing in the performance as a whole.
"A Soldier's Play" raises important
issues, and is a significant play for
that reason alone. But the script does
not strike me as Pulitzer quality, and
the unfortunate performance Tues
day night makes its drawbacks even
clearer.

Tlie Andrews Sisters sing as the
lights go down. When the spots come
up, and a black man in a sergeant's
uniform is illuminated. We know the
setting is the segregated U.S. Army of
World War 11. The sergeant is drunk,
he staggers. And then he rears up and
shouts a single sentence, three times.
"They still hate you" he yells, and
bitterness increases with each ut
terance. A shot rings out and he falls.
With the second shot, the lights go
out.
So opens "A Soldier's Play," being
performed at the Stanford Theatre
this and next week. With its trou
bling, painful themes, Charles Ful
ler's drama won the Pulitzer Prize in
1982. Now the Negro Ensemble
Company has come to the newly
renovated theater on University Ave
nue to present this mystery play to
Bay Area audiences. Structuring its
story around the investigation into

the murder of Tech/Sergeant Vernon
Waters, Fuller's play raises urgent,
challenging questions about the way
blacks should go about gaining
respect and achieving success in white
America.
A black captain, Richard Daven
port, is assigned to investigate the
murder. He persists despite the oppo
sition of white officers, and begins to
discover the peculiarities of Sergeant
Waters' character. Waters, it turns
out, has a whole philosophy about
how he should behave in order to
reach a position of equality, but that
view involves reforming the behavior
and character of other blacks.
Waters' is a conformist, arguing
that the only way to gain the respect
of whites is to beat them at their own
game, to excel in the ways approved
by white society, without questioning
its rules. But he doesn't seem to
believe blacks can do this individu
ally. He believes that he will help the
position of the entire race by oppress

ing and reforming "geechies," his
term for blacks who perpetuate the
stereotype of blacks as subservient,
foolish, and nonaggressive.
This leads Waters to abuse his men,
and we see the conflicts and tensions
produced by that as Captain Daven
port interviews the members of his
all-black platoon, and their memories
are enacted on stage. The choices and
problems implicit in Waters' philoso
phy are exemplified by the different
characters in the platoon. But it is in
Captain Davenport, a black lawyer
and officer in a segregated army, that
the questions about conformity, and
the kinds of sacrifices and rewards it
involves, should be most apparent.
At this point I have some reserva
tions about both the script and the
performance 1 saw Tuesday. The way
the very important and difficult issues
raised by the character of Sergeant
Waters are addressed seems unsatis
factory. Now I don't expect that this
sort of thing would be resolved in the

play. Instead of sending some definite
message, a dramatic presentation like
this seems best suited to raising points
for reflection. But to do that success
fully, a playwright needs to single out
and define those points, and offer his
play in a way that will make the audi
ence want to reflect. The first task is
not accomplished successfully in this
script. And although the play is capa
ble of a production that gives the au
dience something to take home and
think abdut, the performance at the
Stanford doesn't emphasize that ele
ment.
The lack of definition is in part a
product of the way this story is told.
Though the sergeant explains himself
a few times, the other characters react
to his fairly well articulated position
only with emotion. No one, not even
Captain Davenport, attempts to
criticize his principles. This is disap
pointing because there are several
characters who might be expected to
question his views. In addition to the

articulate Davenport, there is Peter
son, a soldier who thinks that Waters
hates him, but whom Waters admires
because he fights back against the
sergeant. The company commander,
a West Point captain named Taylor,
has lines that indicate his scruples and
thoughtfulness about race relations,
but he is wasted in silly confronta
tions with Davenport that only bring
up more tough issues that the play
doesn't have time to resolve.
The performance at the Stanford
Theatre exacerbates this lack of
focus. Indeed, not only is there a lack
of emphasis on themes, but the en
ergy that would make the play a satis
tying drama is absent, too. The play is
supposed to be a murder mystery, but
the tension that needs to be estab
lished at the very outset is dissipated
in the play for laughs.
Let me be specific on this point.
After the opening murder scene, we
shift to the platoon barracks, where
Waters' men are searched for weap

oris to prevent revenge attempts, and
the murder itself is described. During
this scene the actors have to establish
our concern and curiosity about the
murder. The script calls for it to be
followed by a contrast scene, in which
the men, left alone by the officers,
show what should be surprising cal
lousness about the crime. During
those contrast scene, Corporal Cobb
(played by Ruben Hudson with good
comic sensibility) is supposed to
scratch his crotch and pick crab lice
off himself, while the other soldiers
