## 'Soldier's Play' opens at the Stanford 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE Daily staff 
Tlie Andrews Sisters sing as the
lights go down. When the spots come
up, and a black man in a sergeant's
uniform is illuminated. We know the
setting is the segregated U.S. Army of
World War 11. The sergeant is drunk,
he staggers. And then he rears up and
shouts a single sentence, three times.
"They still hate you" he yells, and
bitterness increases with each ut
terance. A shot rings out and he falls.
With the second shot, the lights go
out.
So opens "A Soldier's Play," being
performed at the Stanford Theatre
this and next week. With its trou
bling, painful themes, Charles Ful
ler's drama won the Pulitzer Prize in
1982. Now the Negro Ensemble
Company has come to the newly
renovated theater on University Ave
nue to present this mystery play to
Bay Area audiences. Structuring its
story around the investigation into

the murder of Tech/Sergeant Vernon
Waters, Fuller's play raises urgent,
challenging questions about the way
blacks should go about gaining
respect and achieving success in white
America.
A black captain, Richard Daven
port, is assigned to investigate the
murder. He persists despite the oppo
sition of white officers, and begins to
discover the peculiarities of Sergeant
Waters' character. Waters, it turns
out, has a whole philosophy about
how he should behave in order to
reach a position of equality, but that
view involves reforming the behavior
and character of other blacks.
Waters' is a conformist, arguing
that the only way to gain the respect
of whites is to beat them at their own
game, to excel in the ways approved
by white society, without questioning
its rules. But he doesn't seem to
believe blacks can do this individu
ally. He believes that he will help the
position of the entire race by oppress

ing and reforming "geechies," his
term for blacks who perpetuate the
stereotype of blacks as subservient,
foolish, and nonaggressive.
This leads Waters to abuse his men,
and we see the conflicts and tensions
produced by that as Captain Daven
port interviews the members of his
all-black platoon, and their memories
are enacted on stage. The choices and
problems implicit in Waters' philoso
phy are exemplified by the different
characters in the platoon. But it is in
Captain Davenport, a black lawyer
and officer in a segregated army, that
the questions about conformity, and
the kinds of sacrifices and rewards it
involves, should be most apparent.
At this point I have some reserva
tions about both the script and the
performance 1 saw Tuesday. The way
the very important and difficult issues
raised by the character of Sergeant
Waters are addressed seems unsatis
factory. Now I don't expect that this
sort of thing would be resolved in the
