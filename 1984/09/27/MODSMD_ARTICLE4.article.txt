# She spreads the Hoover word

The summer months brought many person
nel changes in the upper ranks of Stanford's
administration. In New Faces, a five-part se
ries, The Daily will profile these faces which
will soon grow familiar. Today: Hoover
Public A ffairs Coordinator Julie Jordan.

Julie Jordan, Hoover Institution's new
public affairs coordinator, knows what it
means to be in the papers.
She says her predecessor. Senior Research
Fellow George Marotta, had a good publicity
machine going. She aims to keep it that way.
"George Marotta had a very creative ap
proach to using the op-ed (opinion and edi
torial) pages," she says."The media had
begun in the '70s to use other authors in their
forums, and he was one of the first to take ad
vantage of it. His target was to get out one

idea in a draft for the op-ed page per day.
And that's virtually what he did.'
The success of this method in "getting
ideas in shape and in the public eye," accord
ing to Jordan, can be seen in yesterday's tes
timony by Senior Research Fellows Alvin
Rabushka and Robert Hall in front of the
House Ways and Means Committee. The two
spoke on the proposed flat-tax bill, based on
their research that gained attention with an
op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal
during the 19705.
"A long-term policy approach" seems to
be Jordan's key phrase for the institution's
work. This view will enable her both to use
and challenge skills she's acquired working
for various organizations, including the
Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette, the
Sierra Club, the California Historical Society
and Bechtel Group, Inc.
But perhaps the experience that will aid
her the most at Hoover will be her past year

as assistant director of public affairs for the
California Department of Finance. "From
Proposition 13 to [Gov. George] Deuk
meijian's first year, California grew an esti
mated $1.5 billion deficit. I did a lot of inten
sive work on fiscal policy publicity. What's
interesting about Hoover is that while the
other positions were concerned with immedi
ate crises — public-policy brushfires —
Hoover has a long-term approach to defining
public-policy agenda."
Jordan also learned from the Department
of Finance about aligning policies with par
ties, something that may come in handy in
dealing with critics of the institution. She ob
serves, "1 asked the civil servants about
working in different administrations — and
Brown and Deukmeijian are so different —
but they said the important issues cut across
ideology. And I think the scholars informa-
