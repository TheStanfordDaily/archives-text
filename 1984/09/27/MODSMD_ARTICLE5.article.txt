# Tubes off, Go Go's may play

### CHARLES ROSS 
Officials at the ASSU Concert Network and the
Keystone Palo Alto, the two organizations which have
been working together to bring Missing Persons and the
Tubes to Frost Amphitheater on Oct. 6, announced
yesterday that slow ticket sales have forced them to
cancel the show.
In related news, a source close to the Network and
the Keystone told The Daily last night that an
"extremely tentative" agreement has been reached to
bring the Go Go's here this fall. Spokesmen for the
Network and Keystone acknowledged that they are
cooperating to bring a rock group to Frost on Oct. 28,
but declined further comment.
Network founder Vinnie Freda, who had worked

with Keystone
to bring Eddie
and the Tide
along with
Missing Per
sons and the
Tubes to
campus, said
he had "never
expected to see
ticket sales this
slow." He ac
knowledged
that students
"were never on
campus to buy
tickets," but
stressed the
aborted con-

cert would not damage the Network's credibility.
"We're not going to lose any money on this concert,"
he said. "I think we're right on schedule. For the entire
year we're only expected to hold three shows."
Aaron Persky, ASSU Concert Network director, in
dicated that in the co-promotion arrangement, the
Network assumed a low risk for the event, and
Keystone handled the major portion of the concert's
financial risk.
"Keystone probably faced unacceptable losses, and
the Concert Network can sympathize with that,"
Persky said.
He indicated that a number of factors resulted in
the cancellation. That Missing Persons had previ
ously played at the Berkeley Community Theatre Sept.
6 reduced the interest for the Frost concert.
"Given the time, we might have been able to do it,
but with the situation, it was kind of a hopeless case,"
Persky said. "The Concert Network was somewhat
skeptical about the drawing power of the two groups."
