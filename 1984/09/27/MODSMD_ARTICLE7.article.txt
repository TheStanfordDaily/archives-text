Congress moves to fight terrorism
WASHINGTON — Congress moved swiftly to approve Reagan ad
ministration requests for more money to fight terrorism yesterday as
some Democrats recommended a State Department shakeup in the
wake of last week's fatal blast at the U.S. Embassy annex in Beirut.
"Maybe it is time to identify the people who are responsible for lapses
in security and give them some other responsibilities," Rep. Stephen
Solarz (D-N.Y.) told department officials at a House Foreign Affairs
Committee hearing.
Rep. Robert I orricelli (D-N.J.) added, "I expect the president of the
United States to put some people on the carpet, to say who is respon
sible. and to get rid of them - ' following last week's blast that killed 14
people, including two American servicemen.
The committee gave unanimous voice-vote approval to the adminis
tration's request for $366 million to upgrade security at embassies and
U.S. Information Agency posts throughout the world, although some
members accused the administration of failing to make good use of
money it had already been granted lor the purpose.
"There is just no room for any more excuses," Rep. Lawrence Smith
(D-Fla.) told the administration officials.
Mideast divided on Jordan move
AMMAN, JORDAN — Jordan's decision to resume full diplomatic
relations with Egypt was condemned yesterday by Syria but welcomed
elsewhere in the Middle East and at the same time fueled speculation
about new movement out of the region's political impasse.
Syria bitterly attacked Jordanian King Hussein's step to restore the
ties with Cairo, which Jordan and 16 other Arab nations broke off after
the Egyptian-Israeli Camp David accords in 1979. In Israel, Egypt and
Oman, however, the response was positive.
A government spokesman in Damascus said the Jordanian decision
was a "flagrant violation of Arab Summit decisions, which makes the
Arab situation more complicated and dangerous."
Syria's official Al-Thawra newspaper called Amman's move a
"treacherous stab in the back of the Arab struggle and an open plot
against the Palestinian cause."
In Cairo, Jordan's decision was viewed as a success for President
Hosni Mubarak's steady and patient handling of foreign policy, and it
was pointed out that since Mubarak assumed power after Anwar Sadat's
assassination almost three years ago. Egypt-Jordan relations had
steadily improved.
Sources close to Mubarak said: "Now that the chain has been broken,
we expect all the other Arab countries to follow suit, one by one."
Reagan blames bombing on Carter
BOWLING GREEN. OHIO — President Reagan yesterday blamed
the suicide car-bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that killed
two Americans last week on "the near destruction" of U.S. intelligence
capability "before we came" into office in 1981.
Answering a student's question after a campaign speech at Bowling
Green State University here, Reagan appeared to be trying to shift re
sponsibility for the attack away from his administration and onto that of
former President Carter.
Reagan did not mention Lebanon in his prepared speech, but a uni
versity senior, Peggy Fitzgerald, asked him about plans to beef up secur
ity at other embassies following the attack in Beirut last Thursday, the
third such fatal bombing attack against U.S. installations in Lebanon.
Reagan responded by saying he would improve protection for other
embassies. He added, "We're feeling the effects today of the near
destruction of our intelligence capability in recent years before we came
here." He said there was a public attitude during those years that
"spying is somehow dishonest and let's get rid of our intelligence
agents." He then added, "And we did that to a large extent."
Reagan did not elaborate, but a White House aide said "you would
not be wrong" to assume he was referring to the efforts of Carter's CIA
director. Adm. Stansfield Turner, to remove several hundred intelli
gence operatives, largely in covert operations, following critical congres
sional investigations into the CIA in the 19705.
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) vice chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, angrily assailed Reagan's statement about intel
ligence cuts, saying it "is not only false, it is reckless." He also suggested
Reagan was attempting to politicize the agency by his statements and
suggested that "an apology is in order. If none is forthcoming, a motion
of censure will be in order."
Mondale outlines steel proposal
CLEVELAND — Walter Mondale yesterday outlined his proposal to
restrict steel imports by 50 percent in return for a labor-management
plan to modernize the steel industry and create permanent jobs.
The Democratic presidential nominee was making his second cam
paign trip in 10 days to this crucial industrial state hard hit by the reces
sion and steel imports.
He told the United Steelworkers convention that President Reagan's
proposals for the industry would result in higher profits for steel corpo
rations but leave them free to invest in other industries and possibly stop
manufacturing steel.
Mondale also charged that current and projected federal budget
deficits, for which he blames Reagan, are one cause of the U.S. trade
deficit, which he said imposes an "invisible" 30 percent tax on all Un
manufactured goods and offers foreign manufacturers and imports a 30
percent subsidy.
Mondale outlined his program here 10 days ago but yesterday was
more vehement in his criticism of Reagan, whom he again accused of
favoring "rich friends and large corporations" at the expense of the
working class.
Later yesterday, Mondale went to New York City to prepare for his
meeting today with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. At an im
promptu sidewalk news conference there, Mondale walked a tightrope
by trying to avoid the appearance of interfering with Reagan's meeting
with Gromyko tomorrow while criticizing the president for not pursuing
arms-control talks more agggressively.
"I will point out as I have before that 1 hope (Gromyko's) meeting
with the president will be successful, that we have only one president at a
time and Mr. Reagan is our president," Mondale said.
Small quake shakes Bay Area
A moderate earthquake shook a large section of Northern California
yesterday.
The temblor was felt from a region stretching from San Jose to San
Francisco, and the quake triggered an emergency shut down of the Bay
Area Rapid Transit system.
Chuck Dunlap of the state Office of Emergency Services in
Sacramento said the temblor, which struck at 1:46 p.m. PDT, appeared
to be centered in the San Jose area and had a preliminary Richter scale
rating of 4.6.
The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park estimated the Richter
rating at 4.5 and placed the epicenter 12 miles east of San Jose, near
Mount Hamilton.
On April 24, an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale hit
Morgan Hill, a community 22 miles south of San Jose, causing an esti
mated $8 million in damage. There were no serious injuries in connec
tion with that quake, but more than 1,000 aftershocks have hit the area
since, 100 of them over 2.5 on the open-ended Richter scale.
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seis
mographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in
strength. An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage. A quake rated
at 6 can cause severe damage.
Modest gain on Wall Street
NEW YORK — Stocks managed a modest gain yesterday after prices
fell from their best levels of the session. Trading volume picked up as
several large blocks changed hands.
Oil and auto issues, some reaching 52-week highs, paced the gainers.
Several financial and chemical stocks also rose.
Today's weather
Continued fair and warm today with temperatures in the high 80s.
Cooler tonight, with lows in the mid 50s.
