## Shultz and Gromyko talk about arms 
### 
NEW YORK — Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko discussed
nuclear arms control issues yesterday,
the first time that high officials of the
two countries have held talks on the
subject since the Soviets broke off the
strategic arms reduction negotiations
late last year.
When Shultz and Gromyko last
met — in Stockholm in January —
the Soviet foreign minister refused to
discuss arms control issues, reiterat
ing Moscow's position that there was
nothing to talk about until the United
States agreed to remove its
intermediate-range Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles from Europe. The So
viet decision to talk about the subject
now, even though the U.S. missiles
remain in Europe, seemed to illus

irate an improvement in the atmo
sphere between the two nations.
A senior U.S. official listed the
topic, along with "regional problems,
the bilateral relationship,
humanitarian and human rights is
sues," as having been discussed by
Shultz and Gromyko during their
meeting of almost three hours. He
would not provide any details but it
seemed clear that arms control was
not the principal focus of the meeting.
Both sides emphasized that nothing
of substance was decided during the
Shultz-Gromyko meeting, held at the
headquarters of the U.S. delegation
to the United Nations, because the
talks were only a preliminary to
Gromyko's meeting with President
Reagan, scheduled for tomorrow at

the White House.
Nevertheless, both sides made
clear that the meeting was the most
friendly — or at least the least
acrimonious — high-level U.S.-
Soviet contact since Soviet warplanes
shot down a South Korean airlinei
last September. Shultz and Gromyko
held a very frosty session in Madrid
shortly after the airliner incident ant
the atmosphere remained chilli
during the subsequent meeting i' l
Stockholm.
"We have discussed many ques
tions, but since there are more discus
sions to come in Washington, the dis
cussions here are not concluded .
Gromyko, a faint smile replacing Ins
usual stoic expression, told reporters
as he left the building.
"Please don't ask me any ques

tions," he said. "You can do that the
next time you meet me. You can ask
me a thousand questions if you want.
But next time, please."
Shultz, emerging a few minutes
later, made exactly the same point:
•Mr. Gromyko and 1 have just com
pleted a comprehensive and broad
conversation as a background to the
conversation he will be having with
the president in Washington."
A senior U.S. official, who des
cribed the meeting to reporters on the
condition that he would not be identi
fied by name, provided very little
more substantive information beyond
listing the general topics that were
discussed.
