# Embassy chief calls move 'premature'

### 
BEIRUT, LEBANON — The chief security offi
cer for the U.S. Embassy here considered the move
to new quarters in the east Beirut annex that was
bombed last week "premature," according to
foreign diplomats to whom he expressed what one
termed his "unease."
These diplomats, who asked that their names and
nationalities not be mentioned, said that security
chief Alan Bigler, who was severely wounded in
last Thursday's suicide bombing of the annex, had
indicated privately that he considered it unwise to
move into the new annex until all its security
defenses had been completed.
The move from the embassy's temporary
headquarters in the British Embassy in west Beirut
took place the first week in August. Only minimal
security installations were in place at the annex
then, and remodeling of the former apartment
building was incomplete. A reporter visiting the
building the day before the move found that doors
to many offices had not been installed, furniture
was still arriving and most telephones had not yet
been connected.

Two months later, when a suicide bomber drove
a van packed with an estimated 3,000 pounds ot
explosives into the grounds, the State Department
had to admit that the vital security work that had
been preoccupied Bigler was still only 75 percent
complete.
The U.S. security chiefs colleagues said Bigler
had been nervous about leaving the British Em
bassy compound which, until the move, had been
defended by 90 U.S. Marines.
Bigler, the sources said, had been in favor of the
eventual move to the east Beirut suburb of Aukar
because it was considered safer than West Beirut
but did not want to make the move until the new
facilities were secure and the Lebanese security
force organized to replace the Marines was trained.
Bigler, 35, was one of the first Americans hit by
the blast last Thursday when the bomb went off on
the access road just in front of the annex. He had
been sitting in the first-floor cafeteria when ap
parently he heard shots from security guards
outside. The van's driver had managed to pass

through a roadblock 150 yards from the embassy
manned by the local security force largely recruited
from the Lebanese Forces Christian militia.
As he reached the door. Bigler was struck with
almost the full force of the blast and was driven
back through the cafeteria, suffering multiple facial
and head wounds. Two days later, he was
evacuated on a stretcher to a U.S. Army hospital in
Landstuhl. West Germany. According to U.S.
sources, he has not been able to talk since he was
injured.
The most apparent reason for the bomber's suc
cess was the fact that a steel gate that was to control
the entry of vehicles past the roadblock on the main
highway had not yet been installed.
The uninstalled steel gate was to have blocked
the road between the giant staggered concrete
blocks known as "dragon's teeth" that had been
laid out on the road to force all vehicles to slow
down and weave through them.
