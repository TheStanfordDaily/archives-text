## 
### 
A Stanford student turned himself in to San Fran
cisco police last night after they issued an all-points bul
letin to question him about the murder of a man whose
body was found in Golden Gate Park Saturday morn
ing.
Francisco Alarcon, a graduate student here in
Spanish and Portuguese, was being held in San Fran
cisco County Jail early this morning on two counts of
oral copulation, two counts of possession of narcotics
and three counts of contributing to the use of marijuana
by minors, according to a spokesman at the jail. Bail
was set at $500,000.
A spokeswoman at the police department's bail of
fice said early this morning that Alarcon will go to court
today, although she said she had no specific informa
tion on the case and did not know if the student would
be charged in connection with the murder of Ted
Gomez, whose body was found in Golden Gate Park
Saturday at 10:30 a.m.
Before Alarcon turned himself in last night, James
Crowley, a detective with the San Francisco Police De
partment, told Stanford University News Service that
police had/'not accused him of being a suspect" in the
killing but that he was "somebody we need to talk with.
"If he is not responsible, we're just as anxious to
clear him, continue the investigation, and find out who
is responsible." Crowley was unavailable for comment
last night after Alarcon turned himself in.
The detective told the news service yesterday that
two witnesses had last seen the victim entering an or
ange jeep-type vehicle with an older man near the in
tersection of Polk and Cedar Streets in San Francisco.
Police drove the witnesses, two boys aged 13 and 15,
through neighboring areas of the city, where they iden
tified Alarcon's residence and the vehicle.
Police obtained a search warrant, returned to the
residence Wednesday night, seized the jeep and estab
lished a stakeout from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m.
Antonio Ramiriz, who identified himself as an attor
ney with the San Francisco Community Law Collective,
arrived during the stakeout, saying that friends of Alar
con had told him police were there.
With Ramiriz acting as an intermediary between
police and Alarcon, police arranged for the two to meet
them at the Flail of Justice. The police returned to the
Hall of Justice to await the pair, but when they did not
arrive by 1 a.m., police called
Ramiriz, who said he would not rep
resent Alarcon, but that Alarcon
planned to contact another attorney
and would turn himself in. Police Then
issued the all-points bulletin.
Juan Felipe Herrera, a Stanford
anthropology graduate student who
lives in the same San Francisco
housing complex as Alarcon, told the
news service that he believes the
charges against Alarcon may be "a
desperate attempt by the police de
partment to cover up its image" by
"dramatically linking the suspect's
identification not only with the mur
der of Ted Gomez but with other gay

related charges."
Alarcon received his master's
degree here in April, 1980, and is
currently completing his doctoral dis

sertation. University news service re
ported that Alarcon was described by
several at Stanford as a brilliant stu
dent and well-known poet.
