## Milton addresses abuse issues, calls family violence 'criminal' 
### WILL GARDENSWARTZ 
Catherine Milton expected to hear a lot of shock
ing testimony about abuse and molestation during
her service on the Justice Department's "Task
Force on Family Violence." But she didn't expect
to be quite so horrified by what she heard.
Milton, a special assistant to University President
Donald Kennedy, was appointed to the bipartisan
task force by U.S. Attorney General William
French Smith. The testimony during the group's
year-long series of public hearings convinced the
committee members that a coherent plan to combat
family violence is badly needed, Milton said.
"We heard horror stories from women and
relatives, where they would call for help, and police
would either dismiss the call or show up and then
not take any action," she said.
What surprised her the most, Milton said, were
the cases involving infants who had been sexually
abused.
"Everyone reacted on a human and not a par
tisan level," Milton said.
The task force issued its final report this month.

Its conclusion is clear: "Family, violence can no
longer be treated as a second-priority crime," she
said.
Among the committee's recommendations are:
• increasing public awareness;
• creating a network of agencies to counsel and
protect victims;
• re-evaluating the ways in which law enforcement
and judicial officials view family violence.
The task force also attempted to tackle some of
the grass roots causes of family violence. The
group's report encouraged the education of
children about sexual abuse, and suggested that an
overall attack on poverty and alcoholism could
reduce family violence.
The report emphasized that acts of violence in
the houshold should be treated no differently than
acts of violence in the streets. "Law enforcement
officials, prosecutors and judges should develop a
coordinated response to family violence," Milton
said. Family violence should be considered a crimi
nal offense, she added.

Milton said she was disgusted by the way young
witnesses are treated by the courts. "It's criminal
the way they're handled," she said, citing as an ex
ample the case of a toddler who was subjected to a
brutal cross-examination in the presence of the of
fender.
Milton believes that judges should be trained to
handle family violence cases, and she supports a
modification of courtroom procedures to accom
modate the needs of victims.
Milton is quick to point out that family violence
is not limited to a specific socioeconomic or racial
group. Rather, she said, the stress of living in
modern America is perhaps the greatest cause of
family violence.
Milton, and her associates on the task force, are
the first to admit that funding for a comprehensive
war on family violence might be hard to come by.
But the committee recommends that revenue
generated by an additional tax on wine and liquor,
coupled with local funding, could go a long way in
aiding the fight.
