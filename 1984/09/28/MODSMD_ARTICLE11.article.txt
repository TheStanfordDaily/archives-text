The University has completed
the removal of asbestos from the
storage and attic areas of Jordan
Hall, according to Department of
Health and Safety officials.
Despite currently safe levels,
the University is removing the ma
terial because an earthquake
might dislodge asbestos fibers into
the air and cause a potentially
health-threatening situation.
Studies are currently being con
ducted to determine which other
buildings on campus may need to
have asbestos removed or treated.
According to Health and Safety
Specialist Barbara Cohrssen,
Durand House and the linguistics
lab at Jordan Hall may be the next
structures treated.
"The control measures will
proceed according to a priority of
the degree of potential hazard,"
Cohrssen said.
The three-week removal and

treatment operations at Jordan,
which were handled by Mechani
cal Asbestos Removal Inc. of
Maryland, cost the University's
facilities reserve fund more than
$100,000.
The removal and treatment
operations here are expected to go
on for many years and to cost
"mega-bucks," Cohrssen said.
Asbestos was used widely in the
United States during the 1950s
and 1960s instead of concrete to
protect structural steel against fire.
Later studies of its effects on
humans led the Environmental
Protection Agency to ban its use in
1978.
The levels of asbestos in Stan
ford buildings are well below the
level of two fibers per cubic centi
meter that is considered danger
ous by the California Occupa
tional Safety and Health Adminis
tration.
