## The
						Stanford Daily Bit by bit, byte by byte 
### 
Last year, an estimated 12 percent of the Stan
ford student body bought Macintosh computers
through the Microdisc program.
Purchase orders have already been placed this
school year and as students realize that the three
to four month wait that occureu last year has
been cut to three to four weeks, even more orders
can be expected.
Currently the Microdisc program includes Ap
ple computers and Hewlett-Packard systems.
Negotiations are under way with IBM and DEC
to make their products available as well.
With the proliferation of personal computers
now on campus, the question of availability needs
to be considered. First, are personal computers
necessary for the average college education? If
so, in what ways? Are computers, for the non
computer science student, anything more than
glorified typewriters? Assuming that saved
time and justified margins are worth the addi
tional $1,000 to $2,000 — a common but still

questionable assumption — we are confronted
with the question of equity. Will those who can
afford systems Mac still runs about $ 1600 for a
128k memory machine, software and an Apple
Image-Writer printer — have an unfair edge over
those who can't?
Stanford students come from a variety of finan
cial backgrounds. Some can probably afford their
own main-frame computers while others must
work between 15 and 20 hours a week to help
pay for their Stanford education. If Stanford
eventually adopts a policy requiring students to
have computers, as some schools already have,
we would hope the University carefully considers
the burden this will place on students dependent
upon scholarships, loans or work-study jobs.
The adoption of such a policy by the Univer
sity, if it occurs at all, is very far down the road.
Yet it merits early planning to ensure that Stan
ford's policy of equality in all academic areas
does not get lost in the shuffle.
