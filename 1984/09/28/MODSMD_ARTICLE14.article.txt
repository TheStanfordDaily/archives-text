## Hart, Reagan representative of parties' futures 
### 
In the platform of a past convention of the
Democratic Party, a certain candidate for
president sharply attacked the incumbent ad
ministration's irresponsible fiscal policies,
eoonomic unfairness and neglect of the envi
ronment. He set forth a bold proposal to

VIEWPOINT

guarantee job security through greater
governmnent involvement in the economy
and specifically identified the areas of science
and technology as the keepers of the nation's
future. In foreign affairs, he pledged to reduce
U.S. troop levels in Europe as part of a broad
reassessment of America's alliances and com
mitments overseas. Regarding Latin America,
he supported the substitution of economic as
sistance for military aid.
In the platform of a past Republican con
vention, another presidefltial candidate ad
vanced a sweeping critique of "the welfare
state." To the shock of many, he called for
revisions in the Social Security system,
pledged extensive reductions in both govern
ment spending and taxes, and opposed
"federally-sponsored inverse discrimination."
As an alternative, he expressed faith in the

creative system with limited government. The
same candidate saw the outside world as a
battleground in the enduring ideological con
flict between freedom and communism. He
therefore pledged to reinvigorate America's
alliances overseas and its defense efforts at
home.
The Democratic candidate was not Gary
Hart, the favorite to capture that party's nom
ination in 1988. but his former employer.
George McGcnern. in 1972. The Republican
candidate was not Ronald Reagan, but Barry
Gold water in 1964.
Both McGovern and Goldwater suffered
landslide defeats — in both cases by margins
exceeding 400 electoral votes. Moreover,
both were br:> n deH ;<s extremists destined for
obscurity or at least a place in Trivial Pursuit.
Lyndon Johnson's 1964 counter
advertisements. featuring ominous mushroom
clouds, would make a later Democrat's appeal
to the nuclear expertise of his daughter Amy
seem mild by comparison.
As the future prospects for Gary Hart and
Ronald Reagan would suggest, yesterday's
"extremism" has achieved broader accep
tability. Were both McGovern and
Goldwater "ahead of their time"? Perhaps.

Historians would note that America rejected
the Socialist Party's agenda in the early years
of this century only to embrace similar
measures in the New Deal.

Lyndon Johnson's 1964 counter
advertisements, featuring ominous mushroom
clouds, would make a later Democrat's appeal
to the nuclear expertise of his daughter Amy
seem mild by comparison.

Apart from providing a dubious vindication
of either man's clairvoyance, the re
emergence of such "extremist'' views reveals
something far more interesting, and tar more
troubling, about contemporary domestic
politics. America has changed since 1972.

Above all, it has witnessed the ebb of the es
sential political constellation that shaped elec
toral outcomes for more than 50 years: the
liberal. Democratic coalition fashioned by

Franklin Roosevelt. The terms of political
debate have become increasingly polarized.
The constitutional structure founded on the
assumption of a broad, centrist coalition has
thus lost its center.
The succeeding years will likely see groping

efforts on the part of both parties to rebuild a
staMe political center. In the process, the bor
rowing of rhetoric, as seen at the San Fran
cisco convention, will rise. Opportunities to
take innovative steps to avert future crises re
garding the federal budget. Social Security,
and Central America (to name only three
pressing concerns) will likely be lost.
History may record that 1984 signalled the
beginning of a fundamental realignment of
the American electorate on a scale to rival
that of the 19305. Gary Hart and Ronald
Reagan may stand poles apart in many
respects but both reject the style and sub
stance of New Deal politics as practiced by
F.D.R. and his many successors. Each sym
bolizes his party as it will enter the next cen
tury. Walter Mondale will lose the 1984 elec
tion not because of his Nordic charisma but
because of his undisputed identification with a
constellation of interests that no longer exists.
If recent polls are at all accurate, Mondale
could suffer a defeat to rival those of
McGovern and Goldwater. The difference is
that he will have no requiem.
