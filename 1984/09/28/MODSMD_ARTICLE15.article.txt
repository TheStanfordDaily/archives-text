# Today is Friday.

This is the last reminder you will see
until Monday about writing a column
for The Daily. That's right, you're going
to have to make it through the weekend
without being reminded of the Monday
deadline. That's Monday. And, by the
way, I hope you don't eat dinner as
soon as food service opens because 5
p.m. is the last possible time to turn in
your sample column â€” the one that is
typed, double-spaced using 57-
character lines. 5 p.m. is a good time
because if you were doing something
during the afternoon, it will have ended
and it is not very sophisticated to eat
dinner so early. Why, when you think
about it, what else could you possibly
be doing at 5 p.m. Monday afternoon
except turning in your sample column
for The Daily?
You need to study you say. Well how
about a little geometry? Say you have a
box, and this box has five sides. That's
right, only five sides. One is open. And
then, say that this box is one of many in
a large bloc, a group even. It is iden
tifiable by its position. It is in the
second column from the left at the very
top. It is distinct from all the others
because this is where all worthy sample
columns are to be deposited. You'll
know when you find it because it says
OPINIONS. Letters to the editor also
make their home here. It's all very cozy.
