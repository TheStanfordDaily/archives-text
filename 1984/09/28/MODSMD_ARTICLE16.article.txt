## Religious ethics help decide policy 
### 
Tuesday's editorial, "Heaven can
wait." (The Daily. Sept. 25) stated
"Whether a candidate is a Protestant,
a Catholic, a Moslem, a Buddhist, a
Je'w or a Hindu should have no
hearing on his or her abilitv to lead.

VEIWPOINT

We urge the candidates and the
American people to rise above religi
ous infighting to concentrate on the
trul) important issues facing this
country."
It is true that whether one follows
Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, or
Moses is in itself irrelevant to elec
toral politics, but the ethical content
of a candidate's religion is politically
important because it determines what
he will do in office. Ethics are impor
tant to man's life because human ac
tion necessitates purposive choice: a
man needs a code of values (based on
a central \alue, such as happiness,
obedience or duty) to serve as the

standard by which he evaluates and
chooses the courses of action open to
him.
If his code is consistent and sound,
he is equipped for success; if his code
is consistent and unsound, he risks
self-frustrating contradictory action
and consequent failure. In the case of
a leader who makes decisions for an
entire nation, the consequences of
success and failure are far more
serious â€” the ethical beliefs of a na
tional leader are an issue of utmost
importance.
Political promises and programs
are matters of circumstance, changing
over time as conditions change. There
is no more reliable guide to predict a
politician s actions than a thorough
understanding of that candidate's
ethical world view. In today's world
of special-interest politics, where
moral debate is purely superficial, po
litical waffling, equivocation and
double talk make policy prediction
largely a guessing game. Conse

quently, "image," the electorate's es
timate of a candidate's personal
integrity on the basis of telegenic
charm, has grown increasingly impor
tant as political promises have traded
at deeper discounts. Professional
prognosticators may enjoy a world of
radical uncertainty, but the rest of us
suffer from the resulting volatility.
The media can perform an impor
tant service by exposing the moral
platforms of political figures. This will
inform voters and open opportunities
for serious debate on fundamental
moral issues (e.g., freedom vs. con
trol, individualism vs. collectivism).
Even if the adversaries in such
debates do not reach agreement, they
avoid resort to force and help inform
others about the issues involved. On
issues from abortion to immigration
to welfare, a moral perspective is re
quired. A baby and a mother both
have rights; those who pay for gov
ernment and those who benefit from
its spending (not only unwed mothers

hut contractors, sponsored
monopolists and protected in
dustrialists) both have rights. In all
these cases the issue is one of rights,
hence of ethics. Are these rights
really in conflict, or not? If they are in
conflict, is there something wrong
about how we define "rights"?
Political issues are moral issues as
well, a fact we can ignore but cannot
escape. There is no room for institu
tionalized religion in the government
of a free people; religion and politics
must be kept separate, but morality
and politics are inseparable.
Dogmatism, not debate, is what we
have to fear. I urge the candidates,
the media and the American people
to rise above superficial sniping over
disputed issues and demand discus
sion of the moral issues really in
volved in political controversies.
