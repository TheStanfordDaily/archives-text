## USW slants facts 
### 
I write to respond to Linda
Crouse's letter of "explanation"
about the Stanford-Local 680
dispute published in the Sept. 26
Daily.
Instead of bringing clarity to the
issue with facts. Crouse sets forth
Local 680's own slanted version of
events. The University community
should have the opportunity to assess
both sides.
112 irst, it is a matter of public record
that Stanford insisted as long ago as
May that an National Labor Rela
tions Board election was necessary
and that Stanford was willing then or
at anytime to participate in such an
election. The delay in resolving this
issue was due solely to Local 680's
absolute refusal to even consider
letting workers vote in such an elec
tion. Until late August, Local 680
opposed holding any election at all.
As to ( rouse's interpretation of
strategies, her reference to Local
680's "building ot community sup
port is contradicted by the almost
constant# ilification of Stanford and
its officers that occurred in the spring
and summer â€” including ar an
nounced plan to disrupt (>1 inpic
soccer games to show "Stanford's
Crimes to the World Community."
I'liroughout all this. Stanford contin
ued to urge the NLRB election and
assured workers that they need not
feat for their wages and benefits
despite 680's claims to the contrary.
f'he election agreement reached

between Stanford and Local 680
speaks for itself. It provides for the
same form of NLRB election that
Stanford was willing to agree to last
spring. It is the same type of NLRB
election that Local 680 described as
unfair in a Sept. 10 leaflet which also
falsely implied that workers might
not get their scheduled September
wage increases. The fact is that un
der the election agreement it is clear
that Local 680 is not now the NLRB
certified representative. Stanford
employees will consider the type of
representation Local 680 would be
likely to provide and decide for
themselves on Oct. 30 whether or
not Local 680 will become their
exclusive representative.
