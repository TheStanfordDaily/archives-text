# Athletic Dept. slashes deficit
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The Athletic Department's budget
deficit for the last fiscal year,
projected at $740,000 by department
officials last January, was trimmed to
approximately $200,000, thanks to
strict fiscal policies and the Olympic
soccer games.
But the department still carries an
outstanding cumulative deficit of
more than $1.1 million, according to
Alan Cummings, associate director of
athletics.
Part of that $1.1 million deficit, in
curred during the 1982-83 and 1983-
84 fiscal years, is due to a loan the de
partment needed for preliminary
plans for a $5 million athletic facility,
Cummings said.
"We'd like someday to build a
pavilion behind the Athletic Depart
ment's" administrative building, he
said. Plans call for a "multi-purpose
facility" designed for physical educa
tion classes, recreational uses and in
tramural sports.
The building, proposed for a
gravel-covered area bounded by Gal
vez, Arguello and Serra streets,
would have the same amount of floor
space as Maples Pavilion and would
seat about 3000 spectators.
"It would relieve some of the pres
sure on Maples Pavilion," Cummings
said.
He said plans for the building have
been in existence for several years,
but the University is waiting for
someone to donate the necessary
funds before it can proceed.
"We simply don't have the funds to
construct the project," Cummings
said.
But the department does have an
estimated $300,000 courtesy of the
Los Angeles Olympic Organizing
Committee. That represents the Uni
versity's share for hosting 465,000
fans for nine Olympic soccer games
during August.
Athletic Department Director

Andy Geiger said he was pleasantly
surprised by the success of the soccer
games.
"That was an event that just took
off," Geiger said. He explained that
technically the money from the games
won't help to offset the operating
budget deficit because the funds, like
the money garnered from the upcom
ing Super Bowl at Stanford Stadium,
will go into an Athletic Department
reserve fund.
Cummings said the $300,000 is a
projected figure because the Univer
sity is still awaiting a check from the
LAOOC. The contract stipulates that
Stanford receive 10 percent of the
total gate revenue generated by the
nine games.
An additional $160,000 was
trimmed from the projected deficit by
implementing "fiscal constraints" last
spring. Finally, the Cardinal Club was
able to sponsor all women's athletic
scholarships for the first time in its
five-year history, saving the depart
ment an estimated $80,000.
According to Cummings, the de
partment spent $160,000 less than
expected by cutting corners and
"exercising some very good fiscal
constraints on expenses."
"We froze the budgets to the best
of our ability for the last part of the
quarter," said Geiger.
Donna Garton, director of the Car
dinal Club, said by raising enough
money to cover all women's scholar
ships, the organization was able to
save the athletic department $80,000.
"The deficit isn't nearly as great
because the Cardinal Club fully
funded the women's scholarship pro
gram," Garton said.
The club raised $669,000 last year,
$135,000 more than its goal and
$80,000 more than the department
estimated in January, she said.
Stanford awards nearly 90 wo
men's athletic scholarships each year


The Olympic soccer matches held this summer at Stanford kicked in $300,00*0 Ath
letic Department. The department also saved $160,000 by ins tit trting, strict departmental
constraints and received $80,000 from the Cardinal Club. .
totaling more than $1 million. The
Cardinal Club raises money by
soliciting funds from alumni and
friends and staging auctions and other
fund raisers. Interest from University
endowment funds covers the differ
ence.

Garton said last year's Cardinal
Club total represents a 120 percent
increase over the 1982-83 figure.
Still, she admits that she is always
playing "catch-up" because the Uni
versity is committed to awarding as
many athletic scholarships as the
NCAA will allow. Thus, each year

the Cardinal Club must struggle to
raise a pre-determined amount of
money, she said.
These two factors — $160,000
"saved" by moving to a tighter fiscal
policy and $80,000 "saved" by the
success of the Cardinal Club —
translate into $240,000 that the de
partment did not expect to have. Add
to that the $300,000 for hosting the
Olympic games, and the department
is, in a way, $540,000 richer.
Thus, a deficit once projected at
$740,000 for the fiscal year Sept. 1,
1983 to Aug. 31, 1984 is now ex
pected to be approximately
$200,000.
Cummings said these figures are
estimates. The department will
release official statistics next month.
Meanwhile, the department hopes
to break even or even turn a small
profit for fiscal year 1984-85.
"This year's budget is designed to
have a zero net loss, and perhaps a
modest surplus." Cummings said. He
said the three-tiered sports plan, in
troduced last year to help bail out the
financially troubled department, goes
into effect this year and should help
prevent the deficit from recurring.
Nevertheless, the Athletic Depart
ment enters this academic year with a
cumulative deficit totaling $1.1 mil
lion. While Geigcr is committed to
reducing that even further, he seems
content with last year's fiscal ac
complishments.
"We want to continue to chip away
at that deficit. We've got to get rid of
it,"he said.
But, Geiger acknowledged, "We're
in better shape now than we were
before."

"We'd like someday to build a
pavilion behind the Athletic Depart
ment's" administrative building, he
said. Plans call for a "multi-purpose
facility" designed for physical educa
tion classes, recreational uses and in
tramural sports.
The building, proposed for a
gravel-covered area bounded by Gal
vez, Arguello and Serra streets,
would have the same amount of floor
space as Maples Pavilion and would
seat about 3000 spectators.
"It would relieve some of the pres
sure on Maples Pavilion," Cummings
said.
He said plans for the building have
been in existence for several years,
but the University is waiting for
someone to donate the necessary
funds before it can proceed.
"We simply don't have the funds to
construct the project," Cummings
said.
But the department does have an
estimated $300,000 courtesy of the
Los Angeles Olympic Organizing
Committee. That represents the Uni
versity's share for hosting 465,000
fans for nine Olympic soccer games
during August.
Athletic Department Director

Andy Geiger said he was pleasantly
surprised by the success of the soccer
games.
"That was an event that just took
off," Geiger said. He explained that
technically the money from the games
won't help to offset the operating
budget deficit because the funds, like
the money garnered from the upcom
ing Super Bowl at Stanford Stadium,
will go into an Athletic Department
reserve fund.
Cummings said the $300,000 is a
projected figure because the Univer
sity is still awaiting a check from the
LAOOC. The contract stipulates that
Stanford receive 10 percent of the
total gate revenue generated by the
nine games.
An additional $160,000 was
trimmed from the projected deficit by
implementing "fiscal constraints" last
spring. Finally, the Cardinal Club was
able to sponsor all women's athletic
scholarships for the first time in its
five-year history, saving the depart
ment an estimated $80,000.
According to Cummings, the de
partment spent $160,000 less than
expected by cutting corners and
"exercising some very good fiscal
constraints on expenses."
"We froze the budgets to the best
of our ability for the last part of the
quarter," said Geiger.
Donna Garton, director of the Car
dinal Club, said by raising enough
money to cover all women's scholar
ships, the organization was able to
save the athletic department $80,000.
"The deficit isn't nearly as great
because the Cardinal Club fully
funded the women's scholarship pro
gram," Garton said.
The club raised $669,000 last year,
$135,000 more than its goal and
$80,000 more than the department
estimated in January, she said.
Stanford awards nearly 90 wo
men's athletic scholarships each year


The Olympic soccer matches held this summer at Stanford kicked in $300,00*0 Ath
letic Department. The department also saved $160,000 by ins tit trting, strict departmental
constraints and received $80,000 from the Cardinal Club. .
totaling more than $1 million. The
Cardinal Club raises money by
soliciting funds from alumni and
friends and staging auctions and other
fund raisers. Interest from University
endowment funds covers the differ
ence.

Garton said last year's Cardinal
Club total represents a 120 percent
increase over the 1982-83 figure.
Still, she admits that she is always
playing "catch-up" because the Uni
versity is committed to awarding as
many athletic scholarships as the
NCAA will allow. Thus, each year

the Cardinal Club must struggle to
raise a pre-determined amount of
money, she said.
These two factors — $160,000
"saved" by moving to a tighter fiscal
policy and $80,000 "saved" by the
success of the Cardinal Club —
translate into $240,000 that the de
partment did not expect to have. Add
to that the $300,000 for hosting the
Olympic games, and the department
is, in a way, $540,000 richer.
Thus, a deficit once projected at
$740,000 for the fiscal year Sept. 1,
1983 to Aug. 31, 1984 is now ex
pected to be approximately
$200,000.
Cummings said these figures are
estimates. The department will
release official statistics next month.
Meanwhile, the department hopes
to break even or even turn a small
profit for fiscal year 1984-85.
"This year's budget is designed to
have a zero net loss, and perhaps a
modest surplus." Cummings said. He
said the three-tiered sports plan, in
troduced last year to help bail out the
financially troubled department, goes
into effect this year and should help
prevent the deficit from recurring.
Nevertheless, the Athletic Depart
ment enters this academic year with a
cumulative deficit totaling $1.1 mil
lion. While Geigcr is committed to
reducing that even further, he seems
content with last year's fiscal ac
complishments.
"We want to continue to chip away
at that deficit. We've got to get rid of
it,"he said.
But, Geiger acknowledged, "We're
in better shape now than we were
before."

The Athletic Department's budget
deficit for the last fiscal year,
projected at $740,000 by department
officials last January, was trimmed to
approximately $200,000, thanks to
strict fiscal policies and the Olympic
soccer games.
But the department still carries an
outstanding cumulative deficit of
more than $1.1 million, according to
Alan Cummings, associate director of
athletics.
Part of that $1.1 million deficit, in
curred during the 1982-83 and 1983-
84 fiscal years, is due to a loan the de
partment needed for preliminary
plans for a $5 million athletic facility,
Cummings said.
"We'd like someday to build a
pavilion behind the Athletic Depart
ment's" administrative building, he
said. Plans call for a "multi-purpose
