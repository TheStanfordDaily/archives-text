## Cardinal upsets Pepperdine, 13-5 
### INGRID SEYER 
The No. 1-ranked Pepperdine
water polo team may have been
leading the polls heading into yester
day's match against host Stanford,
hut after the Cardinal's 13-5 victory,
there was no doubt in Cardinal Coach
Dante Dettamanti's mind which team
was better.
"Pepperdine was ranked No. 1
largely on their play in the UC-Irvine
tournament two weeks ago," Detta
manti said. "Pepperdine has been
largely overweighted early in the
season, but I believe the top teams
are going to start emerging now."
The Waves, previously the only un
defeated team in the nation's top 10,
now are 9-1-2. and the Cardinal im
proved its record to K-2.
Sophomore David Imbernino
scored the first goal of the game for
fifth-ranked Stanford 27 seconds into
the first quarter, starting a four-goal
scoring streak that the Waves were
unable to stop until late in the second
quarter.

Stanford's Jose Velez, Mark Daley
and Grant Stanley scored one goal
apiece early in the second quarter
before Pepperdine's Mike Grier
scored with 3:24 remaining in the
first half. The goal was the only one
for Grier. who is said by m;iny to be
the best water polo holeman in the
nation.
Dettamanti said the Cardinal
focused its defense much of the time
on keeping the ball away from Grier,
and they were successful. Grier was
ejected with 34 seconds remaining in
the third quarter after committing
three major fouls. According to Det
tamanti, Griers' ejection and the Car
dinal's defense were important to the
outcome of the match.
"We have been working a lot this
week on focusing on the various ten
dencies of the Pepperdine team and it
really payed off for us," Dettamanti
said. " We knew we had to hold Grier
to one or two goals, and we were able
to do that. Our defense played
fabulously and really put a lot of pres

sure on the Waves' outside players."
Stanford goalie Steve Moyer was a
major factor in the success of the Car
dinal defense, getting 12 saves to
Vukan Ruzic's nine for Pepperdine.
Though Dettamanti said the game
was primarily defensive, he was
pleased with the Cardinal's play of
fensively.
According to Dettamanti, the key
to the Cardinal's offense was its
balanced scoring. Velez, a junior, led
Stanford with three goals. He was fol
lowed by Grant Stanley, Chris
Thompson and David Imbernino,
who had two goals each.
"We had been practicing extra
hard all week for this game, and we
were all really psyched up and
prepared," Velez said. "We swam a
lot, more than Pepperdine, during the
match and 1 think we had better con
centration than our opponents."
