# Arizona State: highly touted, but 1-2

zine is keeping a low profile these
days. Slot only did he place Arizona
State in Ins preseason top JO football
ratings, he ranked the Sun Devils No.
1.
Arizona State, which Stanford
hosts tomorrow at 12:50 p.m. in its
Pacific 10 Conference opener, has
played three games this season. Ex
cept for a 48-0 rout of San Jose State
two weeks ago, the Sun Devils
haven't played like a No. 1 team, or a
top 20 team. Arizona State is 1-2
overall and 0-1 in the Pac-10.
"We've played differently in all
three games," Sun Devils Coach Dar
ryl Rogers said. "It's very perplex
ing."
Rogers' biggest mystery seems to
be finding a way for the offense and
defense to play well on the same day.
Arizona State's highly touted defense
was embarrassed in ASU's opener

against Oklahoma State. The final
score: 45-3, Oklahoma State.
Against the University of Southern
California last Saturday, it was the of
fense that hud its problems. All
American place kicker Luis Zendejas
missed a 27-yard field goal with 56
seconds to play and the Sun Devils
lost, 6-3.
When Cook ranked Arizona State
first, however, he had at least a few
reasons for doing so. The Sun Devils
were coming off what Rogers called
"an excellent spring." So excellent
that Rogers ended drills a week early,
saying, "Everything went very well.
We accomplished what we set out to
accomplish. And how many times can
you say that?"
The Sun Devils also had a defense
that returned 10 starters from last
season, including players such as All-
Pac-10 safety David Fulcher. The
running attack, with tailbacks Darryl
Clack and Mike Crawford, was intact
as well.

And besides the good spring and
slew of returners, Arizona State had
the type of schedule coaches like —
eight of their 11 games at home, in
Sun Devil Stadium. Going into this
season, ASU was 40-9 in Sun Devil
Stadium since 1977.
So where did Cook go wrong?
Besides overlooking the Nebraskas
and Texases in the nation, he forgot
that Sun Devil quarterback Todd
Hons completed his eligibility last
season.
Rogers is currently alternating be
tween Jeff Van Raaphorst, a junior
with three years of eligibility, and
John Walker, a freshman with no ex
perience. Van Raaphorst has com
pleted 34 percent of his passes (17-
of-29) and is averaging one intercep
tion every ten times he throws the
ball. Walker's statistics aren't much
better — 19-of-47 (40.4 percent) for
312 yards and two interceptions.
Senior Tim Salem has also
played quarterback. He's thrown two

passes this season — one was incom
plete, the other was intercepted.
One offensive weapon the Sun
Devils do have is Zendejas. Last
week's one field-goal performance
moved Zendejas into ninth position
on the National Collegiate Athletic
Association career scoring list with
313 points. He could jump to sixth
place tomorrow with six points and
needs 44 more this season to break
Tony Dorsett's record of 356 career
points.
In last year's 29-11 victory over
Stanford, Zendejas hit a Pac-10-
record five field goals and missed
both his last-minute tries at an
NCAA-record-tying sixth.
Besides Zendejas, the Stanford
defense will have to stop ASU s run
ning attack.
"They're going to try to run the
ball right at us," Stanford Defensive
Coordinator Dick Mannini said. "The

completions and three interceptions.
