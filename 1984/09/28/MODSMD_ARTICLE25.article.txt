# Injured Card to play San Diego
## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT 
The Stanford men's soccer team
will play a nonconference game to
morrow morning at 11 against the
University of San Diego, an opponent
it knows little about.
San Diego comes to Stanford's
Maloney Field a mystery to Cardinal
Coach Sam Koch.
"It's a little far for me to go down
and scout, and 1 haven't really asked
around (about them)," Koch said.
Stanford, 4-2-2 overall and 1-0 in

the Pacific Soccer Conference, is
coming off a 2-1 victory over San
Jose State in which junior forward
Todd Rafalovich scored two goals.
The Cardinal has been hampered
by injuries to its midfielders. Angel
Vazquez's broken foot sidelined him
for this season and he will redshirt.
Mike Mossmer and Brian Mahaffey
and goalie Willy Burkhardt also have
suffered from nagging injuries, and
fullback Tom McGannon, despite a
case of the flu, played against San

Jose State.
Because of the injuries to Vazquez,
Mossmer and Mahaffey, Stanford has
had to shuffle its lineup, which has
unsettled its defense.
"The defense has been a weak
ness," Koch said. "But we pulled to
gether, and they showed me a lot
against San Jose State."
The Cardinal's front line also has
felt the effects of injuries.
"They haven't been playing as well
as they can," Koch said. "But every

one plays hard, covers for each other,
and makes runs for each other."
Koch commended Charlie Crane,
Fred Ueland and Rob West for
steady, unselfish play. Koch said
Ueland has "done well to pull up
slack" in the absence of key players.
Burkhardt said he believes there is
another reason, besides injuries, for
the Cardinal's troubles.
"We've had horriblt luck — balls
bouncing off posts, open nets being
missed, the defense playing stellar for

89 minutes and then screwing up for
one minute — which has cost us a
game or a tie," Burkhardt said.
Despite the loss of players
Burkhardt called "magic" — Vaz
quez and Jorge Titinger, who has
used all his eligibility — Burkhardt is
optimistic.
"We have to have team effort,"
Burkhardt said "Our only chance is
through team effort. But you can
quote me on this: We're going to pull
off a couple upsets this year.''
