### 
PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) â€” George
Allen, saying it was "a day of sadness
and a day of pride," resigned yester
day as head coach of the Arizona
Wranglers of the United States Foot
hall League, apparently ending his
14-year professional coaching career.
Allen. 66, said he would remain
with the Wranglers as chairman of the
hoard and part owner. He named As
sistant Coach and Offensive Coordina
tor Paul Lanham as his successor.
Lanham, 53, told a hastily-called
news conference that "this is a time of
great mixed emotions for me. How do
you replace a legend?"
Although Allen did not completely
rule out a possible return to coaching,
he said he would "be there to help"
Lanham, who has never been a head
coach.
"He won't falter. Paul will do a
good job," Allen said. "He's an old
friend and a colleague who's been
with me since way back in my days
with the Washington Redskins in the
National Football League. I'll be here
every day trying to make this fran

chise successful. I'm not leaving foot
ball. I'm just changing jobs."
Allen, who led the Wranglers to
the Western Conference champion
ship last season, said he reached his
decision to resign about midnight
Wednesday night and informed team
owner Dr. Ted Diethrich during din
ner.
"I left the table in tears," said
Diethrich. a Phoenix, Ariz, heart sur
geon. "I knew it was the end of 2
coaching relationship, and I was
deeply saddened to see that. But
Coach really isn't leaving. He'll be
advising us on a daily basis.
Diethrich also announced that
"there are no plans to merge the
Wranglers with any other USFL team
at this time" and said the Wranglers
hierarchy would stay intact with Al
len's 28-year-old son Bruce remain
ing as general manager.
Allen's resignation came as a
surprise since Allen was last seen in
Phoenix at a Wranglers tryout camp
Aug. 25 and told The Associated
Press that he was returning as head
coach and honoring the final year of

his $300,000 contract.
Arizona lost, 23-3, to the Philadel
phia Stars in the USFL title game July
15 in Tampa. Fla. It ended a season in
which the Wranglers rallied from a 6-
8 record in late May to finish 12-9
and keep from becoming Allen's first
losing team.
Out of football for five years, Allen
was coaxed from retirement in 1982
to take over as head coach of the
Chicago Blitz by Diethrich. Chicago
went 12-6 in the USFLs inaugural
season.
The Wranglers and the Blitz
swapped franchises last year.
In 12 seasons in the NFL, Allen
compiled a 116-47-5 record, going
49.17-4 from 1966-70 with the Los
Angeles Rams and 67-30-1 from
1971-77 with Washington. He was
named NFL Coach of the Year in
1967, 1969, 1971 and 1972 after
leading the Rams to two division
titles and the Redskins to three divi
sion championships plus a berth in
the Super Bowl following the 1971
season.
