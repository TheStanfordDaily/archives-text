### STEPHEN KASIERSKI 
The summer months brought
many personnel changes in the up
per ranks of Stanford's administra
tion. In the last of a five-part New
Faces series, The Daily profiles
Head Football Coach Jack Elway.

When Paul Wiggin resigned last
year after a dismal 1-10 football
season, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger was given the difficult task
of finding a new head coach who
could save the foundering Car
dinal program. He didn't have to
look far.
In December, Geiger hired San
Jose State Coach Jack Elway, a
new face with a familiar name.
Elway says he jumped at the op
portunity to take over Stanford's
squad, calling the University's
"best-in-everything" image a

prime motivating factor.
"Stanford is unique in that it has
an excellent academic and athletic
tradition," he explains. "Each
reputation enhances the other."
Elway disagrees with the sports
pundits who call this a "rebuilding
year" for the Cardinal.
"We hope to gradually progress
as the season goes on," he says.
"We've got a combination of ex
perienced seniors and good, young
talent to work with. Last year's
record just whetted our appetite
for victory."
Elway approaches his job with a
philosophy developed through
many years of coaching — at the
high school as well as collegiate
level.
"We try to have a theme for
every game's preparation," he
says. "Whether we lost the previ
ous week or not, we try to objec
tively analyze our performance in
every game and improve in certain
areas.
"We'll try to be sensitive to
change as the season goes on and
increase the intensity of the
practices if we have to."
Elway admits that the pressure
and hype surrounding Stanford
football is more than he had previ
ously experienced, but he is
usually oblivious to the crowd and
the noise at a typical game.
"On the sidelines, the only
feeling is total concentration and
involvement in the game," he says.
"The fans always add indirectly to
the momentum, something to fac
tor in."
Elway intends to be involved in
all phases of the football program,
including scouting and recruiting,
similar to his style at San Jose
State. He is also aided by Stan-

signed to lure blue-chip players to the
University.
"Football is usually the most im

foi most of our recruits. When 1 tell
them. We'll win here," that's what
will convince them. The combination
of athletics and academics is hard to
turn down."
FI way's squad has chalked up two
\ ietories in its first three games, a fact
thai allows the coach to discuss a win
ning season as .1 real possibility.
"We're definitely a big-play team,"
he says. "Our defense is beginning to
stiffen, and the offense has steadily

improved. We have more confidence,
and I can substitute a little more
freely now. Our personality is in
tense, physical, and we're hungry for
some victories"
Despite having confidence in
promising scouting reports, Elway
realizes,that he and his team can't he
overconfident.
"We must be prepared for any
thing," he says emphatically.
"Football is a great game, but a game,
a team game. Football is an unknown,

not a science. We have to be creative
and flexible."
Elway's adaptibility and easygoing
style seem exactly what Stanford
needs to attain an elusive bowl berth.
The team mirrors Elway's personality
— relaxed yet intense. The result has
been new-found confidence and
respect for the Cardinal football pro
gram. And Elway's respect and ad
miration for his players adds to his
own confidence about the future.
"The players are winners in the
way they live their lives, practice and
play the game," he says. "We have
the resources here to win in football."


Head Football Coach Jack Elway quickly won the approval of his team with a relaxed attitude and a winning strategy.
