## On the town 
### 
The best pizza within a half-hour of
campus. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi, Too
(939 El Camino Real, Mountain View)
has no peer in pizza; what it does have are
45-mmute-to-an-hour waits on weekends,
which can fly by if enough of you go and
you drink enough while waiting (if you
look 21, you'll be accosted by a roving
cocktail waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh-tomato-and-garlic pizza, a
house specialty, and avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful. A distant
second to FJ&L is Ramona's Restaurant
(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto), which has
decent New York-style (i.e., heavy and
spicy) pizza and slightly shorter waits; it's
also 15 minutes closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the pizza with
barbecue sauce (ladled on in place of
tomato sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto).
Finding your own kind. Stanford hangouts
change from year to year, of course, and
I'm sure the newest ones have escaped my
attention, but there are old standards.
Half the people in Ramona's on any given
weekend night will be from Stanford; the
Stanford crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games. Most
of them will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area (see above), while those
who want to be different chew on calzone
or decent hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar maintains only a
shade of its former glory. Down the street
at the Good Earth Restaurant (185 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto) you'll find a dif
ferent, slightly older, Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. Of course, hang
outs in the true Stanford sense of the
word are places you go to swill beer, and
there are a couple of those: The Dutch
Goose (3567 Alameda de las Pulgas,
Menlo Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis Beer
Garden (241 El Camino Real, Menlo
Park), a downright ugly place that has
been witness to untold decades of Stan
ford history. Two things you have to
know: refer to them as "the Goose" and
"the O," respectively; and rest assured
that you will be carded at both establish
ments. If you like your nightlife a bit row
dier. try St. James Infirmary (390 Moffet
Blvd., Mountain View) or Antonio's Nut
House (321 California Ave., Palo Alto),
places where you can get into a fight if you
try hard enough. In recent years an at
tempt has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St., Palo
Alto) into a Stanford hangout of the pub
night variety, but it doesn't seem to have
fully caught on. A morning alternative:
the brunch crowd at Hohee's. And don't
forget The New Varsity, especially when
the theater is showing Woody Allen
movies.
Where to go with your girlfriends. When
Stanford women go out together, they
seem drawn as if by an irresistible force to
the Good Earth. The Good Earth fills a
specific need: It's a place where you can
get "a little something to eat" (a sand
wich, a salad), in nice surroundings, and
not feel guilty that you're only spending
$4 or $5. (It's also about as close to
campus as restaurants get.)
The singles scene. This may not seem like
a relevant category for The Stanford
Daily, hut I've seen more than my share of

students (MBA and otherwise) in these
places. 42nd Street (518 Bryant St., Palo
Alto, in the alley between Bryant and
Ramona) is either a dream come true or a
nightmare made real, depending on your
point of view. It's an expensively tacky
meat market with great sight lines, where
you'll find a variety of hunters: tables of
frightened-looking Stanford students,
Palo Alto nouveau riche and lots of secre
taries. The action is much more serious at
the British Bankers Club (1090 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), which draws an older,
richer crowd (it goes in and out of fashion
as a business school hangout) to its fake
Edwardian digs. Coming on strong in
recent years has been Mac Arthur Park (27
University Ave., Palo Alto, next to the
Palo Alto train station), a favorite of
young professional types, which leads
right into:
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie. Style is
everything in a Yuppie hangout, and
Mac Arthur Park has one of the approved
styles: big, open, white-painted spaces,
wood floor, railings everywhere. The food
ranges from mcdiocre to bad (be sure to

order something from the grjll), but what
does it matter when you can get potato
skins and eight wines by the glass? An
other style is represented by Waverley
Place (560 Waverley St., Palo Alto), new
to downtown Palo Alto, which is all glass
and bleached wood and expensive (but
surprisingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts, a couple
of established Palo Alto restaurants have
swung with the times: The Gatehouse (265
Lytton Ave.), one of Palo Alto's prettiest
places to eat and drink, is taken over by
the young after the dinner hour, and
Henry's (482 University Ave.) is a favor
ite with the local advertising/design com
munity that lives off Silicon Valley.
Silliest wine list in town. At the
above-mentioned Waverley Place, you can
get a young Lafite Rothschild or Chateau
Petrus, but there won't be anything worth
drinking for under $20.
True romance. Everyone has his own idea
of the perfect surroundings in which to let
Jove flower, but each'"6f the 'following

places is romantic in its own way Bella
Vista (13451 Skyline Blvd., Woodside)
has, as you might expect, a gorgeous view;
it nestles in the redwoods atop the Skyline
ridge, and if you're lucky you'll get a
candlelit table by the window that looks
out over the bay. Tuxedoed waiters and
picturesque locals in Jaguars complete the
picture. St. Michael's Alley (800 Emerson
St., Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of sophistica
tion unusual in Palo Alto, to go with its
eclectic continental menu (you'll eat as
well here as anywhere in town). Sundance
Mine Company (1921 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto) isn't to everyone's taste; it has
an unimaginative steak-and-seafood
menu, it's overpriced, and it takes itself
awfully seriously. But we're talking atmo
sphere here, and if you're in the right
feeling-like-an-adult mood, Sundance,
with its state-of-the-art green/brown
wood/cut-glass interior, has it to burn.
And many a Stanford couple holds fond
memories of Flea Street Cafe (3607
Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park, two
doors from the Dutch Goose), a low-key
little place with excellent avant-veggie

food.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail, there
are two local French restaurants that come
close to meeting the bistro ideal (good
food, relatively low prices): Le Pot au Feu
(1149 El Camino Real, Menlo Park) and
A La Carte Restaurant Francois (2310 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto). Somewhat more
formal, but still affordable, are Pear Wil
liams Restaurant Francais (150 Mid
dlefield Road, Menlo Park) and Chez
Louis (4170 El Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Most of the other nearby French restau
rants suffer from some combination of
pretentiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The only
German restaurant I've discovered
anywhere near campus is the Black Forest
Inn (376 First Street, Los Altos). Meals
are prepared rather indifferently, but if
you just have to have some weinerschnit
zel with red cabbage and potato pancakes,
this is the place to go.

Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria (171 A
sth Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of Red
wood City (a town known for its uninvit
ing parts) and makes the only authentic
burritos-to-go in the area. These are big,
sloppy things that can't be eaten while
driving a car, and they come in a wide se
lection, including pork and beef in several
sauces, steak, chicken, sausage and
tongue. Rosita's also has a good selection
of Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The Per
fect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping Center)
still serves this forgotten victim of the
gourmet wars, along with cutesy sand
wiches and good coffee; a different quiche
is served every day, and you can count on
a flakey crust and perfect consistency.
They don't serve white wine, but you can
still dig your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a bowl
game (which last happened at about the
height of the quiche craze).
Ice cream. We all love ice cream, but no
one can deny that the Stanford area is
drowning in the stuff. Within a quick drive
of campus are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Road), two Bud's (125
University Ave., Palo Alto and 3590
Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-Robbins
outlets, as well as the Italian ice cream
shops: Gelato La Romanina (1700 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park), Tempo
Gelato (2245 El Camino Real, Palo Alto),
Gelato Classico (Emerson Street, down
town Palo Alto), Bravo Fono (99 Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or three
more have probably opened since you
started reading this. If ice cream to you
means a soda fountain, try Edy's (73
Town & Country Village, El Camino and
Embarcadero, Palo Alto), or one of the
downtown creameries; Peninsula
Creamery (Hamilton Avenue and Emer
son Street, Palo Alto) and University
Creamery (209 University Ave., Palo
Alto).

Barbecue. The true barbecue experience
is unavailable in this area; the nearest
worthwhile sauce is in South San Fran
cisco. Mac Arthur Park has decent ribs
(the ribs are one of the tew things worth
eating there) covered with a tame,
ketchup-dominated sauce. If you want
real barbecue ambiance, though, go to
Goldie's Oakwood Bar-B-Que (1940 C
University Ave., East Palo Alto â€” bear
left before the freeway), a storefront oper
ation in Whiskey Gulch. Goldie's con
fronts the public with a bare, whitewashed
room holding two formica tables and a
cooler. In the far wall there's a hole
through which you order your pork or
beef ribs, chicken or links. You can get an
order or a sandwich (about half the size of
an order). Both will come with white
bread wrapped in plastic and your choice
of baked beans or coleslaw. The sauce
here is the real thing, but it's awfully mild;
there's no reason not to order it hot.
Seafood. The Fish Market (3150 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) has long been
Palo Alto's most popular spot for seafood,
and it generally deserves to be. It was way

ahead of the mesquite-grill, fresh-special
game, and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal service
from an army of T-shirt-clad young
waitresses. The lines can be long on
weekends, but there's an outdoor patio,
drinks while you wait, and an
oyster/seafood cocktail bar to help pass
the time. Scott's Seafood Grill & Bar
(2300 East Bayshore at Embarcadero,
Palo Alto) has given The Fish Market a
run for its money since opening four years
ago, but it's attractive mainly as a place to
be seen; the fish is overcooked about half
the time, the service can be shoddy, and
the prices are way out of line.
Places to get "California Cuisine." There
are no restaurants in the vicinity of
campus that could be called innovative,
but there are some with Berkeley
gourmet trappings. Fresco (3398 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto, in the old Stick
ney's Flamingo location) is a corporate
version of the California ideal (it's run by
the Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled fish

cooked with various combinations of sun
dried tomatos, basil and red peppers,
along with composed salads and the oblig
atory grilled meats (lamb and steak). It's a
pleasant, reasonably priced place with
perfectly well-prepared, but boring, food.
Smaller and chicer is Theo's (546 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto), which has a more
conservative, steakhouse type of menu but
a better wine list (wine being all
important in this type of restaurant).
Two places to get sushi. Fuki-sushi (4119
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) has both a
sushi bar and a robata bar, and is a swank,
full-service Japanese restaurant to boot.
An hour at the sushi bar will cost you what
you've always heard sushi costs. Ten-ichi
Tempura (925 El Camino Real, Menlo
Park) isn't as prepossessing a place, but
the sushi is just as good and a fair bit
cheaper.
Where to go when your parents are
paying. Some of the most expensive res
taurants around are: The Village Pub
(2967 Woodsjde Road, Woodside), La

Tour (525 University Ave., Palo Alto),
Maddalena's (544 Emerson St., Palo
Alto), Chantilly (530 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) and Hugo's Market (4219 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto, at Rickey's
Hyatt). Several of these places have truly
bad food, but your parents probably won't
know the difference.
Meals under $5. California Avenue, Palo
Alto's alternate business district, is a sur
viving bit of the laid-back '70s right here
in the heart of the enervating '80s. It's
currently being University Avenueized,
with office buildings and condos going up
right and left, but in the meantime it's
lined with good cheap places to eat.
Working north to south, from Park
Boulevard to El Camino, you can get pot
stickers and bao at Cho's, hamburgers at
Kirk's, chapatis at Shaikh's India Foods,
and healthy salads and sandwiches at
Country Sun Cafe and Farmer's Market.
Afterward, drop by Printers Inc., the
area's best bookstore.
Hamburgers. Kirk's (361 California Ave.,

Palo Alto) has great hamburgers, hut
they're not for the faint-hearted. Ask lor
your steakhurger well-done if you don'l
want it raw. The burgers at Kirk's are
cooked over a charcoal grill while you
wait; there's nothing else to eat but potato
chips and some packaged salads, but this is
a small point when you're getting one of
the last of the real hamburgers. A close
second in the hamburger derby is the
Alpine Beer Garden (3915 Alpine Road.
Portola Valley), also known as the Alpine
Inn or as Rosotti's or, most commonly, as
Zott's. This is an old-time madhouse
where bikers and the local Ford truck
crowd mingle freely with the Mer
cedes/BMW set, all drinking pitchers ot
Henry's and Anchor Steam at picnic
tables in the vast, dusty patio out back
The burgers here are cooked on an
electric grill, but they're good-sized and
the trimmings are excellent: sourdough
French rolls, fresh lettuce-and-tomato
setups. A hamburger and beer on the
patio at Zott's on a sunny (but not too
hot) day is what California is all about
Delicatessens. The only real deli on the
Peninsula is in Burlingame; what you find
around here are brie-and-pate outlets that
make sandwiches on the side. The best of
these by far is the Village Cheese House
(157 Town and Country Village. Palo
Alto), which has all the important gour
met items you've never heard of and a
friendly, helpful staff to boot.
Places to hear music. If open mike at the
Coffee House isn't your idea of nightlife,
there are a few places nearby where you
can catch a band while sitting down. Just a
few. The New Varsity (45f> University
Ave., Palo Alto), a restaurant/art-house
movie theater/bar/Paly High hangout, has
live music in its front courtyard most
nights. Among the regulars are Tuck and
Patti, an extremely popular local ja//.
guitar/vocalist duo, and some of the
second-rank Windham Hill artists, partic
ularly Michael Hedges. Be warned: On
the weekends the alienated teens of Palo
Alto descend on the New Varsity and
hang out on the sidewalk in front; you II
have to walk their gauntlet to get in, espe
cially if something like "Quadrophenia" is
playing as the midnight show. St. Mi
chael's Alley has an adjoining cafe where
music, often folk, is performed on
weekends; the cafe, called St Michael's
Waiting Room, has some Â«>f the oesi
pastries in town along with wines and
sherries by the glass, beer, and all other
things liquid. Adlai Alexander, an ex
stalwart of several campus bands, plays
The Gatehouse on Wednesday and Satur
day evenings; Alexander is an accom
plished jazz guitarist and a sometimes
amazing singer. If you like your music
with more of a participatory edge, try the
piano bar at Chez Louis, where Roger
Cowger might let you take microphone in
hand and wow the crowd with your own
impassioned version of "The Impossible
Dream." And finally, check the weekly
listings for the Keystone Palo Alto (260
California Ave ), a disastrously uncom
fortable, hot, smoky, loud nightclub with
overpriced, watered-down drinks where in
the course of the last four years you could
have caught Neil Young, Warren Xevon,
The Band, Jackson Browne. Bruce
Springsteen jumping up on stage wi'.h
Clarence Clemons and the Red Bank
Rockers . . .
