## On the town 
### 
The best pizza within a half-hour of
campus. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi, Too
(939 El Camino Real, Mountain View)
has no peer in pizza; what it does have are
45-mmute-to-an-hour waits on weekends,
which can fly by if enough of you go and
you drink enough while waiting (if you
look 21, you'll be accosted by a roving
cocktail waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh-tomato-and-garlic pizza, a
house specialty, and avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful. A distant
second to FJ&L is Ramona's Restaurant
(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto), which has
decent New York-style (i.e., heavy and
spicy) pizza and slightly shorter waits; it's
also 15 minutes closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the pizza with
barbecue sauce (ladled on in place of
tomato sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto).
Finding your own kind. Stanford hangouts
change from year to year, of course, and
I'm sure the newest ones have escaped my
attention, but there are old standards.
Half the people in Ramona's on any given
weekend night will be from Stanford; the
Stanford crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games. Most
of them will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area (see above), while those
who want to be different chew on calzone
or decent hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar maintains only a
shade of its former glory. Down the street
at the Good Earth Restaurant (185 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto) you'll find a dif
ferent, slightly older, Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. Of course, hang
outs in the true Stanford sense of the
word are places you go to swill beer, and
there are a couple of those: The Dutch
Goose (3567 Alameda de las Pulgas,
Menlo Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis Beer
Garden (241 El Camino Real, Menlo
Park), a downright ugly place that has
been witness to untold decades of Stan
ford history. Two things you have to
know: refer to them as "the Goose" and
"the O," respectively; and rest assured
that you will be carded at both establish
ments. If you like your nightlife a bit row
dier. try St. James Infirmary (390 Moffet
Blvd., Mountain View) or Antonio's Nut
House (321 California Ave., Palo Alto),
places where you can get into a fight if you
try hard enough. In recent years an at
tempt has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St., Palo
Alto) into a Stanford hangout of the pub
night variety, but it doesn't seem to have
fully caught on. A morning alternative:
the brunch crowd at Hohee's. And don't
forget The New Varsity, especially when
the theater is showing Woody Allen
movies.
Where to go with your girlfriends. When
Stanford women go out together, they
seem drawn as if by an irresistible force to
the Good Earth. The Good Earth fills a
specific need: It's a place where you can
get "a little something to eat" (a sand
wich, a salad), in nice surroundings, and
not feel guilty that you're only spending
$4 or $5. (It's also about as close to
campus as restaurants get.)
The singles scene. This may not seem like
a relevant category for The Stanford
Daily, hut I've seen more than my share of

students (MBA and otherwise) in these
places. 42nd Street (518 Bryant St., Palo
Alto, in the alley between Bryant and
Ramona) is either a dream come true or a
nightmare made real, depending on your
point of view. It's an expensively tacky
meat market with great sight lines, where
you'll find a variety of hunters: tables of
frightened-looking Stanford students,
Palo Alto nouveau riche and lots of secre
taries. The action is much more serious at
the British Bankers Club (1090 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), which draws an older,
richer crowd (it goes in and out of fashion
as a business school hangout) to its fake
Edwardian digs. Coming on strong in
recent years has been Mac Arthur Park (27
University Ave., Palo Alto, next to the
Palo Alto train station), a favorite of
young professional types, which leads
right into:
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie. Style is
everything in a Yuppie hangout, and
Mac Arthur Park has one of the approved
styles: big, open, white-painted spaces,
wood floor, railings everywhere. The food
ranges from mcdiocre to bad (be sure to

order something from the grjll), but what
does it matter when you can get potato
skins and eight wines by the glass? An
other style is represented by Waverley
Place (560 Waverley St., Palo Alto), new
to downtown Palo Alto, which is all glass
and bleached wood and expensive (but
surprisingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts, a couple
of established Palo Alto restaurants have
swung with the times: The Gatehouse (265
Lytton Ave.), one of Palo Alto's prettiest
places to eat and drink, is taken over by
the young after the dinner hour, and
Henry's (482 University Ave.) is a favor
ite with the local advertising/design com
munity that lives off Silicon Valley.
Silliest wine list in town. At the
above-mentioned Waverley Place, you can
get a young Lafite Rothschild or Chateau
Petrus, but there won't be anything worth
drinking for under $20.
True romance. Everyone has his own idea
of the perfect surroundings in which to let
Jove flower, but each'"6f the 'following

places is romantic in its own way Bella
Vista (13451 Skyline Blvd., Woodside)
has, as you might expect, a gorgeous view;
it nestles in the redwoods atop the Skyline
ridge, and if you're lucky you'll get a
candlelit table by the window that looks
out over the bay. Tuxedoed waiters and
picturesque locals in Jaguars complete the
picture. St. Michael's Alley (800 Emerson
St., Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of sophistica
tion unusual in Palo Alto, to go with its
eclectic continental menu (you'll eat as
well here as anywhere in town). Sundance
Mine Company (1921 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto) isn't to everyone's taste; it has
an unimaginative steak-and-seafood
menu, it's overpriced, and it takes itself
awfully seriously. But we're talking atmo
sphere here, and if you're in the right
feeling-like-an-adult mood, Sundance,
with its state-of-the-art green/brown
wood/cut-glass interior, has it to burn.
And many a Stanford couple holds fond
memories of Flea Street Cafe (3607
Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park, two
doors from the Dutch Goose), a low-key
little place with excellent avant-veggie

food.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail, there
are two local French restaurants that come
close to meeting the bistro ideal (good
food, relatively low prices): Le Pot au Feu
(1149 El Camino Real, Menlo Park) and
A La Carte Restaurant Francois (2310 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto). Somewhat more
formal, but still affordable, are Pear Wil
liams Restaurant Francais (150 Mid
dlefield Road, Menlo Park) and Chez
Louis (4170 El Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Most of the other nearby French restau
rants suffer from some combination of
pretentiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The only
German restaurant I've discovered
anywhere near campus is the Black Forest
Inn (376 First Street, Los Altos). Meals
are prepared rather indifferently, but if
you just have to have some weinerschnit
zel with red cabbage and potato pancakes,
this is the place to go.

Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria (171 A
sth Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of Red
wood City (a town known for its uninvit
ing parts) and makes the only authentic
burritos-to-go in the area. These are big,
sloppy things that can't be eaten while
driving a car, and they come in a wide se
lection, including pork and beef in several
sauces, steak, chicken, sausage and
tongue. Rosita's also has a good selection
of Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The Per
fect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping Center)
still serves this forgotten victim of the
gourmet wars, along with cutesy sand
wiches and good coffee; a different quiche
is served every day, and you can count on
a flakey crust and perfect consistency.
They don't serve white wine, but you can
still dig your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a bowl
game (which last happened at about the
