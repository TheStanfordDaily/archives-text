Breakfast

Morning eaters are luck\ here — Palo Alto and Menlo Park have a
plethora of good restaurants that specialize in breakfast and lunch. First
among equals is Late for the Train (561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo Park,
near the train station), a folksy place that makes great omelettes, divine
blintzes and fruit pancakes, and the usual salads and sandwiches, plus
ever-changing desserts. If you go on a weekend, particularly a Sunday,
expect at least a 45-minute wait; it's best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can often be seated immediately. Modeled
along much the same lines is Hobee's Haven (4224 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, and Town and Country Village), a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula. Hobee's follows more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit, and other California trimmings, and it has a truly
addictive coffee cake that comes with most of the breakfasts. The Farmer's
Market (448 California Ave., Palo Alto) has a small menu, spotty service
(semi-cafeteria style) and the ambiance of a butcher shop, but it serves
great breakfasts (try the apple pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple omelette) at
amazingly low prices. (The latter isn't always true on weekends, when you
may find yourself ordering a "brunch" at inflated prices.) Finally, there's
the favorite morning meeting spot of Stanford sororities: Dinah's Poolside
Coffee Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo Alto; not to be confused with
Dinah's Shack, a mediocre restaurant next door), which many people feel
has the best omelettes in the area.
