# Why don't we pick the kind of food we want?

It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? How about
Mexican? And it's easy to fall into
around here, because there are more
ethnic restaurants than you can
shake a burrito or a potsticker at.
Most of them are bad as you'd ex
pect; here are a few of the good
ones.
Generations of Stanfordites have
fallen in love with the mu shu pork
at Chef Chu's (1067 North San

Antonio Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos). This always crowded
Mandarin restaurant prepares perfectly solid, unexciting dishes — it's the
ideal place for large groups with diverse tastes. The food's more exciting
at China First (675 El Camino Real, Palo Alto), another place with a large
reputation. The cuisine here is Szechwan/Hunan, albeit not that spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu; if you go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the waiter sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there are two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park; Yuen Yung (639 Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic, but primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung more interesting decor — it looks like a
cross between a Chinese restaurant and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good Mexican restaurant when Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded earlier this year.
Now a trip to Redwood City or Mountain View is required. La Fortuna
(3180 Middlefield Road, Redwood City) is excellent, and just blocks away
from the center of Northern California's illicit wholesale drug trade. Just
around the corner is Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth Ave., Redwood City),
which has the best burritos around. Estrellita (971 North San Antonio
Road, Los Altos) isn t what it used to be, but it still has great chimi
changas. There are two passable family-type Mexican joints in Menlo Park:
La Luna Mexican Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and Caleta (1 143 D Crane St.).
If you don t mind a drive, the best Latin restaurant around is probably El
Calderon (699 El Calderon Ave., Mountain View), which is hidden away
in a small shopping center and has a Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
