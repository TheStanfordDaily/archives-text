# It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and nothing's open

There used to be a wealth of places you could go at 2 a.m. (or 4 a.m., or
6 a.m.) with the gang and be obnoxious, or with a loved one to fortify
yourself for an emotional crisis, or by yourself to study and grab a burger.
But Stickney's Flamingo first cut back to midnight, and then became a
trendy Yuppie restaurant; Luv's went to 24 hours on weekends only, then
became a singles dance spot, and is now Atherton Joe's, which is God only

knows what. In the old days, going to
Denny's or Lyon's didn't even cross
your mind; now they're all that's left.
Closer (by about a hundred yards)
and friendlier is Denny's (4256 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), which is
10 minutes away at two in the morn
ing. Denny's is also cheaper than
Lyon's, it has tackier vinyl (bright
orange), and it has Ova, the current
all-star late-night waitress. So why
go to Lyon's (4298 El Camino Real,
Los Altos) at all? Because
sometimes you need a change.
Lyon's is darker, the waitresses are
younger, and the meals are bigger; if
you're determined to eat a lot of
food at 4 a.m. and make yourself
really sick, there's nothing like a
Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for these
corporate monsters is the University
Creamery (209 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which sensed the vacuum and
went to a 24-hour policy last spring.
The Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are great (they use Bud's
ice cream) and it's a lot closer to
campus (it's even within fairly easy
bicycle range).
