# ASSU revamps Pub Board
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Legislation changing the appropri
ations process for student publica
tions was approved at last night's
meeting of the ASSU Senate in the
Law School.
In addition to that measure affect
ing the Publications Board, the Sen
ate firmed up plans for an election in
late October, heard a presentation
from the director of Tresidder Union,
and created a special committee to
consider the viability of a Stanford-
San Francisco shuttle service.
In the most significant business of
the evening, Graduate Senator James
McGrath spearheaded a drive to
eliminate the Publications Board
from the complex process which al
locates money to student publications.
The Publications Board is
composed of representatives from all
student publications on campus and,
prior to the passage of this bill, played
a central role in the process of divid
ing up ASSU money among those
publications.
In the past, budgets for the various
student publications were developed
in a four-step process. A five member
Finance Committee, composed of the
Publications Board director, three
board members and one ASSU
senator, would draw up a preliminary

budget for the publications and pres
ent it to the entire board. The board
would then amend the budget and
submit it to the ASSU Appropria
tions Committee. The committee
would revise the budget, make its
recommendations, and send it to the
floor of the Senate for final approval.
Under the new plan, the board
would be excluded from the process.
An altered finance committee, which
substitutes a student-at-large for one
of the three board members, would
draw up a budget and submit it di
rectly to the Appropriations Commit
tee.
"The new bill leaves the Publica
tions Board almost powerless," said
Publications Board Director David
Gregor. In theory, the Publications
Board would have veto power over
this budget, but in reality it would not
have sufficient time to do so, he said.
If the board were to veto the
budget recommended by the Finance
Committee, the budget process would
be delayed too long and the ability of
the publications to pay their bills and
publish on time would be severely af
fected, said Gregor.
McGrath, Graduate Senator Su
Uhland and Council of Presidents
member Alice Wells pushed the mea
sure over Gregor's objections be
cause of problems with last year's

process. Last year, according to these
senators, the appropriations commit
tee had to practically write the entire
Publications Board budget because of
its unreasonable requests.
McGrath added that the inef
fectiveness of the board had been
crippling the budgetary process for
the past five years.
The senate also passed a measure
calling for an ASSU election on Oct.
30 and 31 and another which pro
vides nearly $4,500 to fund the elec
tion.
The original purpose of the elec
tion was to elect six alternate

graduate senators. Now however, stu
dents will also vote on a presidential
preference referendum, on proposed
amendments to the ASSU Constitu
tion and possibly on other
referendum-type questions.
The presidential preference ques
tion will ask, "Which of the following
individuals is your choice for presi
dent of the United States of
America?" and list all six candidates
who will appear on the California bal
lot in November.
In addition, several campus groups
are uniting to "ask the board of trus
tees to divest in all companies in
South Africa," and will work to have
a referendum question on the Uni
versity's investments in South Africa
placed on the ballot, said Graduate
Senator Mark Landesmann.
Landesmann labeled Stanford's in
vestment record "the most embarass
ing of any private university in the na
tion," saying that every other major
private university has already sold its
stock in companies that operate in
South Africa.
Midway through the meeting, the
senate heard a presentation from
Tresidder Director Ellie Oppenheim
on the changes taking place there.
One of the major changes at

Tresidder this fall is in the old Office
of Student Affairs.
It has been renamed Student Or
ganization Services (SOS) and has
been "restructured and refocused to
provide more tangible services for
student organizations on campus,"
Oppenheim said.
To that end, SOS has compiled a
prototype handbook for leaders of
student organizations and will con
duct workshops for them. In addition,
SOS has established office space for
student organizations in half of the
old OSA office and has equipped the
room with equipment such as phones,
a light table, a mimeograph machine
and banner painting supplies.
