# Spirits in the night

There are as many different kinds of bars as there are drinkers, and the
most popular ones — the Goose, the O, 42nd Street, the BBC— are
treated elsewhere in the article. I'm concerned here with the bar as a
comfortable environment in which to drink, as opposed to a supportive
environment in which to get drunk (or find your soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave., Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and one of the nicest places to sit around in
Palo Alto. The bar at Mamas (379 Stanford Shopping Center) is a bit out
of the way, but it has a certain hushed elegance that makes it attractive.
Henry's (482 University Ave., Palo Alto) is hot and crowded once the
dinner customers clear out, but there's no one on the make; just lots of
successful young Palo Altans hanging out in one of their favorite bars.
Another bar that has a "scene," but isn't quite a singles bar, is that of the
New Varsity (456 University Ave., Palo Alto). Videos play above the bar,
musicians play in the courtyard, and lots of Paly High blondes and
assorted Palo Alto punks hang around out front. It's noisy and crowded
and uncomfortable on the weekends, but the people watching is great. If
you're looking for something a little more staid, try the bar at the rear of
the London House (630 Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving re-creation of
an English pub where you can get most any British beer you want, pub
snacks and a game of darts.
