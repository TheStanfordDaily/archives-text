# Avoid at all costs
## 
### 
Sometime while you're here,
someone will suggest going to one of
these restaurants. Politely tell
him/her you'd rather undergo root
canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4269 El Camino
Real) is one of those inexplicably
popular restaurants â€” I can see why
little old ladies go there, but why in
God's name would anyone else want
to spend $10 for a lousy buffet and
the chance to hear "Feelings" played
on the harp? Ecco Ristorante (4290
El Camino Real, Palo Alto), right
across the street in the Hyatt Palo
Alto, may be the worst Italian res
taurant I've ever encountered, and
the green carpet doesn't help. King
Chuan (75 Town and Country Vil
lage, Palo Alto) had, at last count,
three different laudatory Stanford
Daily reviews posted in its window.
Don't believe a word of them.
