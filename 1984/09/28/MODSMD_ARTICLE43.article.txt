## 'Dreamscape' star of bleak summer 
### Steve Vineberg 
The film offerings over the last
couple of months have been so bleak
that many people I know simply gave
up and stopped going to the movies.
When your only choice is between
"Under the Volcano" and "Careful,
He Might Hear You", the better part
of valor may be to content yourself
with TV reruns and the stock at your
local video store. Typically, neither
distributors nor critics have provided
much help: The summer's funniest
release, "The Adventures of Buckaroo
Bonzai", starring Peter Weller as a
poker-faced New Wave sci-fi hero and
John Lithgow as an outsize comic
strip maniac named Dr. Lizardo,
failed to open in most cities, and al
most no one has paid any attention to
"Dreamscape" - the movie audiences
should have picked up on white the
press was dutifully sending them out to
see "Tightrope".
"Dreamscape"
David Loughery's story for
"Dreamscape", the basis of the
screenplay he co-wrote with the
director, Joseph Ruben, and the asso
ciate producer, Chuck Russell, has
the narrative cleverness of the best
1950s science fiction fantasies, of Mi
chael Crichton's "Westworld" or last
year's " War Games". Max von Sydow
plays Paul Novotny, a brilliant scien
tist who has discovered
"dreamlinking", a way to help psy
chiatric patients suffering from terri
fying nightmares. Two young men
with highly developed telekinetic
powers, Alex Gardner (Dennis
Quaid) and Tommy Ray Glatman
(David Patrick Kelly), enter the sub
jects' dreams, acting either as ob
jective observers whose description
of the "dreamscape" can determine
the course of therapy afterwards, or
as participants — helpmates with the
ability to guide the dreamer or even
shape his dream. Alex, a cheerful, ir
reverent, womanizing screw-up with
a predilection for gambling, winds up
in Novotny's "dream chamber" when
the scientist, whose experiments Alex
walked out on as a rebellious (and
bored) teenager, threatens to report
his illicit winnings at the races —
where, of course, his psychic gifts
have come in handy — to the IRS.
What keeps him there is a combi
nation of genuine affection for
Novotny, a sexual interest in his assis

tant, Jane DeVries (Kate Capshaw,
of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom"), and his taste for adventure
(which the filmmakers wisely es
tablish within the first ten minutes of
the picture). Alex is arrogant and sly,
but he has such a relaxed good time in
life that the audience identifies with
him immediately. Besides', his
smiling, laid-back attitude masks a
real intensity for the challenges that
appeal to him. (This kind of role is
Dennis Quaid's specialty.) Unfortun
ately — perhaps inevitably — Ruben
and his co-writers reveal Alex's
capacity for heroism by introducing a
little boy. driven to the brink of a ner
vous breakdown by his nightmares,

who captures his heart and whose
cause he vows to help. His success in
this venture peaks the envy of his fel
low psychic, Tommy Ray, a paranoid
megalomaniac whom the filmmakers
set up as Alex's adversary from the
outset. (David Patrick Kelly, who
looks vaguely extraterrestrial in this
movie, specializes in psycho roles,
and he's even better — creepier —
here than he was as the assassin in
"The Warriors".)
"Dreamscape" makes a more im
pressive bid on a viewer's pulp im
agination than "Westworld" did, be
cause Ruben's team (photographer
Brian Tufano, editor Richard Halsey,
special effects designer Peter Kuran
and the others) have given the movie
a classy look and a varied texture, and
it is far more satisfying than
"War Games" because Ruben and his
co-writers sustain it — it doesn't fall
apart two-thirds of the way through.
Each of the dreams Alex enters has
a different style and tone. One, in
volving a man with a potency prob
lem (Larry Gelman), is comic; an-

other — Alex's mischievous attempt
to initiate a romance with Jane by en
tering her unconscious, is erotic; the
little boy's nightmare has a Freudian
Gothic design and a Jungian subtext.
Ruben and his collaborators were
working at top form when they
turned out this five-minute tribute to
Dali and (perhaps) to the 1945 hor
ror classic "Dead of Night": It leads
us from a haunted room with
crooked-eye windows down a long,
rickety staircase suspended in space
that's a real beauty. (Ruben redeems
all the sentimentality in the relation
ship between Alex and the child by
whipping up such an inventive se
quence.)

Unlike Joe Dante, the director of
"Gremlins", Ruben keeps all his
cards in his hand; when he introduces
a motif or a plot twist, you know it
will show up later, neatly interwoven
with all the other threads. His device
for rigging up the grand finale, a poli
tical conspiracy involving the head of
something called Covert Intelligence
(Christopher Plummer) and, as his
victim, the dream-torn president of
the United States (Eddie Albert),
comes to us via a dozen other movies;
here — for the first time — Ruben's
machinery creaks. The picture could
easily dispense with the mean, tricks
of a government bad guy (and it could
certainly dispense with Plummer's
performance) and still provide a face
off between Alex and Tommy Ray, as
well as a deluxe climax within the
president's "dreamscape" incorpo
rating all the elements the filmmakers
have so shrewdly inserted in earlier
scenes. But the fact that you get all
you could ask for in this sequence
makes it easy to forgive the derivative
manner in which Ruben and his co
writers manipulated it.

"Tightrope"
For the first hour of "Tightrope", I
was bewildered by the praise so many
reviewers have lavished on this slug
gish, obvious and consistently badly
acted thriller, starring Clint Eastwood
as a cop whose search for a psyc
hopathic murderer hitting exclusively
on active members of the sexual un
derground in New Orleans (whores,
lady wrestlers, S & M types, hot tub
"attendants") exposes his own need
for sexual excitement of an unsavory
nature. I couldn't figure out how

every hustler in the city seemed to
have Eastwood's number; they take
one look at that absolutely inexpres
sive face and immediately suggest
that he's eager for the same kind of
kicks as the man he's trying to track
down. (In one scene, a lovely woman
works on him with a vibrator, and
though we assume she arouses him,
he doesn't move a single facial muscle
to confirm it.)
Wes Block, the character
Eastwood plays — and I use the verb
loosely — must be the most inept cop
on the New Orleans force: He sleeps

with almost every woman he
encounters in the course of his inves
tigation, but he never seems to make
any headway in the case — in fact, he
ends up providing victims for the kil
ler, who is dogging his steps. The bla
tant implausibility of every turn in the
plot exasperated me, especially as the
writer-director, Richard Tuggle, has
no talent for suspense and no notion
of how to direct actors; even the
usually fascinating actress Genevieve
Bujold, as the head of a rape center
