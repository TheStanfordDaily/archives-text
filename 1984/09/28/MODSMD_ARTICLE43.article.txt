## 'Dreamscape' star of bleak summer 
### Steve Vineberg 
The film offerings over the last
couple of months have been so bleak
that many people I know simply gave
up and stopped going to the movies.
When your only choice is between
"Under the Volcano" and "Careful,
He Might Hear You", the better part
of valor may be to content yourself
with TV reruns and the stock at your
local video store. Typically, neither
distributors nor critics have provided
much help: The summer's funniest
release, "The Adventures of Buckaroo
Bonzai", starring Peter Weller as a
poker-faced New Wave sci-fi hero and
John Lithgow as an outsize comic
strip maniac named Dr. Lizardo,
failed to open in most cities, and al
most no one has paid any attention to
"Dreamscape" - the movie audiences
should have picked up on white the
press was dutifully sending them out to
see "Tightrope".
"Dreamscape"
David Loughery's story for
"Dreamscape", the basis of the
screenplay he co-wrote with the
director, Joseph Ruben, and the asso
ciate producer, Chuck Russell, has
the narrative cleverness of the best
1950s science fiction fantasies, of Mi
chael Crichton's "Westworld" or last
year's " War Games". Max von Sydow
plays Paul Novotny, a brilliant scien
tist who has discovered
"dreamlinking", a way to help psy
chiatric patients suffering from terri
fying nightmares. Two young men
with highly developed telekinetic
powers, Alex Gardner (Dennis
Quaid) and Tommy Ray Glatman
(David Patrick Kelly), enter the sub
jects' dreams, acting either as ob
jective observers whose description
of the "dreamscape" can determine
the course of therapy afterwards, or
as participants — helpmates with the
ability to guide the dreamer or even
shape his dream. Alex, a cheerful, ir
reverent, womanizing screw-up with
a predilection for gambling, winds up
in Novotny's "dream chamber" when
the scientist, whose experiments Alex
walked out on as a rebellious (and
bored) teenager, threatens to report
his illicit winnings at the races —
where, of course, his psychic gifts
have come in handy — to the IRS.
What keeps him there is a combi
nation of genuine affection for
Novotny, a sexual interest in his assis

tant, Jane DeVries (Kate Capshaw,
of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom"), and his taste for adventure
(which the filmmakers wisely es
tablish within the first ten minutes of
the picture). Alex is arrogant and sly,
but he has such a relaxed good time in
life that the audience identifies with
him immediately. Besides', his
smiling, laid-back attitude masks a
real intensity for the challenges that
appeal to him. (This kind of role is
Dennis Quaid's specialty.) Unfortun
ately — perhaps inevitably — Ruben
and his co-writers reveal Alex's
capacity for heroism by introducing a
little boy. driven to the brink of a ner
vous breakdown by his nightmares,

who captures his heart and whose
cause he vows to help. His success in
this venture peaks the envy of his fel
low psychic, Tommy Ray, a paranoid
megalomaniac whom the filmmakers
set up as Alex's adversary from the
outset. (David Patrick Kelly, who
looks vaguely extraterrestrial in this
movie, specializes in psycho roles,
and he's even better — creepier —
here than he was as the assassin in
"The Warriors".)
"Dreamscape" makes a more im
pressive bid on a viewer's pulp im
agination than "Westworld" did, be
cause Ruben's team (photographer
Brian Tufano, editor Richard Halsey,
special effects designer Peter Kuran
and the others) have given the movie
a classy look and a varied texture, and
it is far more satisfying than
"War Games" because Ruben and his
co-writers sustain it — it doesn't fall
apart two-thirds of the way through.
Each of the dreams Alex enters has
a different style and tone. One, in
volving a man with a potency prob
lem (Larry Gelman), is comic; an-

other — Alex's mischievous attempt
to initiate a romance with Jane by en
tering her unconscious, is erotic; the
little boy's nightmare has a Freudian
Gothic design and a Jungian subtext.
Ruben and his collaborators were
working at top form when they
turned out this five-minute tribute to
Dali and (perhaps) to the 1945 hor
ror classic "Dead of Night": It leads
us from a haunted room with
crooked-eye windows down a long,
rickety staircase suspended in space
that's a real beauty. (Ruben redeems
all the sentimentality in the relation
ship between Alex and the child by
whipping up such an inventive se
quence.)

Unlike Joe Dante, the director of
"Gremlins", Ruben keeps all his
cards in his hand; when he introduces
a motif or a plot twist, you know it
will show up later, neatly interwoven
with all the other threads. His device
for rigging up the grand finale, a poli
tical conspiracy involving the head of
something called Covert Intelligence
(Christopher Plummer) and, as his
victim, the dream-torn president of
the United States (Eddie Albert),
comes to us via a dozen other movies;
here — for the first time — Ruben's
machinery creaks. The picture could
easily dispense with the mean, tricks
of a government bad guy (and it could
certainly dispense with Plummer's
performance) and still provide a face
off between Alex and Tommy Ray, as
well as a deluxe climax within the
president's "dreamscape" incorpo
rating all the elements the filmmakers
have so shrewdly inserted in earlier
scenes. But the fact that you get all
you could ask for in this sequence
makes it easy to forgive the derivative
manner in which Ruben and his co
writers manipulated it.

"Tightrope"
For the first hour of "Tightrope", I
was bewildered by the praise so many
reviewers have lavished on this slug
gish, obvious and consistently badly
acted thriller, starring Clint Eastwood
as a cop whose search for a psyc
hopathic murderer hitting exclusively
on active members of the sexual un
derground in New Orleans (whores,
lady wrestlers, S & M types, hot tub
"attendants") exposes his own need
for sexual excitement of an unsavory
nature. I couldn't figure out how

every hustler in the city seemed to
have Eastwood's number; they take
one look at that absolutely inexpres
sive face and immediately suggest
that he's eager for the same kind of
kicks as the man he's trying to track
down. (In one scene, a lovely woman
works on him with a vibrator, and
though we assume she arouses him,
he doesn't move a single facial muscle
to confirm it.)
Wes Block, the character
Eastwood plays — and I use the verb
loosely — must be the most inept cop
on the New Orleans force: He sleeps

with almost every woman he
encounters in the course of his inves
tigation, but he never seems to make
any headway in the case — in fact, he
ends up providing victims for the kil
ler, who is dogging his steps. The bla
tant implausibility of every turn in the
plot exasperated me, especially as the
writer-director, Richard Tuggle, has
no talent for suspense and no notion
of how to direct actors; even the
usually fascinating actress Genevieve
Bujold, as the head of a rape center


who falls in love with Block, brings
little more than her unusual presence
to the role. (Making sense of the at
traction of a sensitive, intelligent wo
man to a wood block like Wes Block
must be beyond even Bujold's capa
bilities.)
It wasn't until fairly late in the
picture that I began to understand
what reviewers must see, or think
they see, in "Tightrope". Tuggle has
tapped into the "Vertigo" vein (to
invoke an infinitely superior example
of the same syndrome) — he's posi
tioned his hero on psychological ter
rain so appealing to some people that

Wes Block (Eastwood) must be the
most inept cop on the New Orleans
force: He sleeps with almost every
woman he encounters, but he never
seems to make any headway in the
case.

they are willing, even eager, to aban
don any concern with plot and accept
a cipher who winces to show intensity
of emotion as a suitable substitute for
a human being. Asking how all of the
corpses-to-be in this movie can leap
to the corruption in Block's heart
without any visible signal is like as
king why that stupid redhead in
"Vertigo" insists on wearing a
necklace belonging to a dead woman;
the answer is primer Freud — these
characters wear their unconscious on
their sleeves.
And so a dull, realistic murder
story suddenly becomes, without
warning, an expressionistic fable
about the tightrope all men walk be
tween the darkest corner of their
souls and their more "acceptable"
sexual selves, even though Tuggle is
no expressionist and Cliat Eastwood

is, God knows, no actor. (The same
argument can be made, I think,
against Hitchcock in "Vertigo", hut if
Hitchcock wasn't an expressionist,
either, at least he was a master enter
tainer and a genius at a certain kind
of heavy, heady baroque roman
ticism. The scenes between Block and
his rape-center lady lie in the center
of "Tightrope" like dough in an un
dercooked loaf of bread.)
Tuggle gives Eastwood a family in
this movie — a selfish, hostile ex-wife
(without a single line of dialogue) and
two children, one of them played by
Eastwood's real-life daughter,
Alison, who has a flat voice and looks
like her mother, Sondra Locke. Con
sidering her parentage, if Alison
Eastwood had turned out to be the

acting discovery of the season,
"Tightrope" would have provided us
with at least one surprise twist, but
the father-daughter exchanges aren't
much of an improvement over the
rest of the film.
In fact, the most embarrassing mo
ment in the movie arrives when,
during a family car ride, Block's
younger daughter (Jennifer Beck)
asks him what a hard-on is and he
struggles, and fails, to find an appro
priate definition to satisfy her
curiosity. It didn't occur to Tuggle
that a father in that situation might
first supply a less colloquial synonym
and proceed from there to a physio
logical explanation of sexual arousal.
Tuggle is only interested in setting up
a (pitiful) gag line for later on, and in
underscoring Block's divided person
ality, in reminding us that his dark

side will inevitably encroach on terri
tory belonging to the clean-living
family man. What Tuggle wants us to
understand from this scene is that the
only "honest" answer Block could
possibly offer his daughter is the fol
lowing: A hard-on is what your daddy
gets when he's chasing a sex criminal,
and he's ashamed of it. Pathetically,
Tuggle seems to think he's made a
profound statement in "Tightrope";
dismayingly, he's not alone.
"First Name: Carmen"
"The classics always work," mut
ters the semi-lunatic, anti-social
Uncle Jean, the character Jean-Luc
Godard plays in his new movie, "First
Name: Carmen". But though this is
an updated version of the Merimee/
Bizet "Carmen", featuring a young
would-be filmmaker (Maruschka
Detmers) — a niece of Uncle Jean's
— who robs a bank and a handsome
soldier (Jacques Bonaffee) who falls
in love with her and helps her to
escape, the key lines, also belonging
to Uncle Jean, are "We should close
our eyes, not open them" and "Kids
today are scum. They haven't in
vented bluejeans or cigarettes, any
thing."
"First Name: Carmen" is a con
temptuous movie — contemptuous of
the latest generation of filmmakers,
and of filmmaking itself. Uncle Jean
is a famous director who stopped
making pictures when, in the middle
of an on-location shoot in a casino, he
gambled away all the technicians'
salaries, and he has become cynical
about the entire process. Godard's
wiry presence so dominates "First
Name: Carmen" (and his lines are
funnier than anyone else's) that we
naturally accept him as the voice of
the film. Besides, he directed it (the
screenplay is credited to Anne-Marie
Mieville), and it is so joyless and one
dimensional that it seems to be press
ing home the point that moviemaking
is an activity that couldn't possibly
return any pleasure to those who par
ticipate in it. Watching, we pick up
trademark Godard moments, like the
play-acted robbery scene suggesting
the golden early days of the French
New Wave (and specifically "Band of
Outsiders", in which the trio of
youthful protagonists embrace thiev
ing as an act in the service of art), but

we miss the dense layering of
meaning in the best Godards or even
the second-best ones.
In this film, the laughs are hollow,
the love scenes aren't erotic, the
modern variations on the "Carmen"
story play themselves out without
leaving an impression on our sen
sibilities. Only the contributions of
the cinematographer, Raoul Coutard
(a collaborator on Godard's films in
the old days, back when Godard
could lay claim to being the Joyce and
Beckett of the cinema), remain fresh;
the rest indicates that Uncle Jean
might really have refused to emerge
from voluntary retirement and left
the work to an imitator.
"Repo Man"
On most levels, "Repo Man" is

fairly terrible, but it's probably the
funniest fairly terrible underground
comedy since "Death Race 2000".
The director, Alex Cox, has such a
weird, uncommitted style that, until
you get used to it, you'd swear he was
as alienated as his teenage hero. Otto
(Emilio Estevez, son of the actor
Martin Sheen), who wears a punk
haircut and a single earring and
whose approach to human relation
ships can best be described as amused
hostility.
The movie lacks structure and half
of the plot elements (which include a
lobotomized stranger driving a car
with radioactive material in the trunk,
aliens and a series of bank robberies
perpetrated by Otto's ex-girlfriend
and her new lover) don't pan out, but
not because Cox has no talent — he
just isn't interested in narrative, or in

character either. What keeps the
movie going are his new age sense of
humor, the way he replays or builds
on gags in the most surprising con
texts (and without a structure to tell
us where we're bound, we can never
predict when a gag is going to recur),
and the desolate suburban low-life
mood set by Robby Muller's underlit
cinematography. As the automobile
repossession man who hires Otto on,
Harry Dean Stanton snorts coke and
throws mean glances at the world he's
only peripherally connected to.
"Look at these assholes — ordinary
people — I hate 'em," he tells Otto.
Stanton's elongated, undernourished
face could be the emblem of the
movie — even though his perfor
mance, like everything in "Repo
Man", seems to shrink a little as it
goes on.
