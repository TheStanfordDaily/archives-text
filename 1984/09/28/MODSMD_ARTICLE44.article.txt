### 
Follow the Fleet (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
By consensus, the three greatest Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals are
"Swing Time," "Top Hat" and"The Gay
Divorcee"; "Follow the Fleet" must
surely own fourth place. Astaire, in a rare
working-class role, plays a gum-chewing
sailor who, on shore leave, teams up with
his old vaudeville partner, Rogers,
dance hall hostess, to win a dance contest.
The Dwight Taylor/Allan Scott script
(based on a play by Hubert Osborne
called "Shore Leave") has its dead spots:
There's a romance between Rogers' sister
and Astaire's buddy that kills a good half
hour of the continuity — not least because
the second bananas, Harriet Hilliard and
Randolph Scott, to quote Arlene Croce,
"go together like red whiskey and
Seconal." But Mark Sandrich, the direc
tor, keeps things light, and the glorious Ir
ving Berlin score ("We Saw the Sea,"
"Let Yourself Go," "I'd Rather Lead a
Band," "I'm Putting All My Eggs in One
Basket," "Let's Face the Music and
Dance") provides the stars with some
wonderful opportunities. This was Rogers'
breakthrough film: Her dancing is terrific
and her clowning ebullient. With Lucille
Ball and Betty Grable in bits.
Plays through Wednesday with "Flying
Down to Rio."
Flying Down to Rio (1933)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Dated, certainly, but an enchantingly
naive early musical, in which chorines kick
their little hearts out on the wings of a
Depression-era plane as it sweeps through
the skies. More importantly, this was the
film that introduced Fred Astaire to
Ginger Rogers; they play subordinate
roles (to Dolores Del Rio, Gene
Raymond and Raul Roulien), but their
ballroom number, "The Carioca," steals
the picture clean away. Vincent Youmans
set lyrics by Edward Eliscu and Gus Kahn
to mostly memorable music — it's nearly
impossible to get the title tune or "Music
Makes Me" out of your head. Thornton
Freeland directed a fatuous screenplay by

Cyril Hume, H.W. Hanemann and Erwin
Gelsey (out of an Anne Caldwell play).
Plays through Wednesday with "Follow
the Fleet."
Romancing the Stone (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
A very entertaining adventure spoof
about a successful writer of romantic
novels who finds herself swept up in a
more elaborate, more implausible plot
than any of her own devising. Diane
Thomas wrote some terrific dialogue;
Robert Zemeckis, the director, employs
his camera as a jokester narrator, setting
up and unfolding the story and punctuat
ing it with visual punch lines. The picture
is a beauty: Dean Cundey, the photog
rapher, has shot the jungle scenes (filmed
on location in Mexico) with a nearly hy
perbolic vividness and clarity, and
Zemeckis gives the adventure sequences
the deluxe treatment. With the gifted
comedienne Kathleen Turner, Michael
Douglas (who tries but doesn't quite fill
the Harrison Ford-style hero role), and
Danny DeVito as a hilariously foreshor
tened comic villain.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30
p.m.
Breaking Away (1979)
Kresge Auditorum
Steve Tesich has laid his screenplay in
Bloomington, Indiana, where he spent his
teenage years, and the four boys (played
by Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid,
Daniel Stern and Jackie Earle Haley) who
are the protgaonists are so intricately
drawn that by the end of the movie you
feel you've known them all your life.
Tesich has a talent for funny, naturalistic
dialogue and for sketching the
idiosyncrasies of his characters so that
they don't seem eccentric; he even writes
first-rate monologues. This picture is
about the inevitable development of the
boys into separate directions, but Tesich
and the director, Peter Yates, whose work
here is understated and kindly, see the
state of change as affirmative. Beautifully
acted by the boys and by Paul Dooley and
Barbara Barrie as Dennis Christopher's
parents, "Breaking Away" has a stinging

comic beauty.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.
Casque d'Or (1952)
Cubberley Theatre (6000 Middlefield
Road), Palo Alto
Jacques Becker set his film amid the
Parisian criminal element at the turn of
the century. It's a fairly conventional
romantic melodrama, or it would be with
out Simone Signoret's magnificent perfor
mance as Marie, the courtesan who falls
tragically in love (with Serge Reggiani).
The cast also includes Claude Dauphin;
Becker co-authored the screenplay with
Jacques Companeez.
Plays Wednesday evening at 8.
The Chaplin Review (1918-23)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
Three of Charlie Chaplin's funniest
short films from First National: "A Dog's
Life" (1918), the great World War I com
edy "Shoulder Arms" (released'just
weeks before the Armistice), and"The
Pilgrim" (1923), in which Chaplin, an
escaped convict, disguises himself as a
minister. The usual crew shows up in all
three — Edna Purviance, Mack Swain,
Sydney Chaplin, Henry Bergman, et al.
Plays Monday with "Modern Times."
Romeo and Juliet (1968)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
Franco Zeffirelli stages opera as though
it were film, but his movies are barely
competent: the camera moves around so
much (and so pointlessly) that you get a
headache trying to focus on the action,
and surely no major director has ever
done such an appalling job of framing —
he cuts his actors to ribbons. In this scan
dalously popular botch of Shakespeare's
lyrical tragedy, the acting is, with a few ex
ceptions, so atrocious that the framing
seems to be a case of the punishment fit
ting the crime. This "Romeo and Juliet,"
in which Romeo (Leonard Whiting)
enters cradling a flower and Mercutio
(John McEnery) might be on acid during
the Queen Mab speech, is more like an
updated "West Side Story" than Shake

speare — talk about reduction! With
Olivia Hussey as Juliet, Milo O'Shea as
Friar Laurence, Michael York as Tybalt,
Pat Heywood as the Nurse.
Plays Sunday with "Brother Sun, Sister
Moon."
16 Candles (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
The young actress Molly Ringwald has
fashioned a comic style out of 1980s
teenage cool. She is utterly charming in
this messy, overloaded but surprisingly
enjoyable little picture written and di
rected by John Hughes, in which she plays
a girl whose family forgets her 16th
birthday in the flurry of preparations for
her sister's wedding. Hughes invents so
many subplots that he can't possibly
them all spinning simultaneously, aft so
sometimes you get the impression he for
got to shoot crucial scenes, or left them in
the editing room by accident. But he has a
talent for writing adolescent dialogue (the
grown-ups' lines are hopeless), and when
Molly Ringwald or Anthony Michael Hall,
as a high school freshman named Ted the
Geek, is on screen, the movie sparkles.
These two get to know each other in the
automotives shop during a school dance;
they appear at first like an implausible
couple of friends, but Ringwald and Hall
make their characters so likable that by
the end of the scene their camaraderie
seems perfectly natural. With Justin
Henry as Ringwald's kid brother, Paul
Dooley as her father, Blanche Baker as
her sister, Michael Schoffling as the senior
she adores, and, as Ted's nerdy pals, a pair
of effortless charmers — John Cusack and
Darren Harrris.
Plays today with "Footloose."
The Ballad of Narayama (1984)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
327-3240
Set in northern Japan a century ago,
Shohei Imamura's film presents a harsh
vision of life on the edge of poverty, and
pursues it relentlessly — almost, one feels

for the first half of the film, mercilessly. In
a village on the slope of Mount Shinshy,
the society is an elemental one, centered
on food and sex, and the necessity of sub
ordinating the more luxurious human
emotions, like tenderness and pity, to the
practical considerations of feeding a fam
ily has given rise to two immutable laws:
TTiose who steal food must be punished in
a way that prevents any further threat to
the supply, and when a man or woman
grows too old to contribute to the family,
the eldest son must carry him or her on his
back to "Narayama" — to the mountain,
to die alone. For a long while the movie,
which is based on a novel by Shichiro
Fukazawa, is tough going: You can admit
that Imamura's vision has its own austere
beauty (and that the photographer, Masao
Tochizawa, has captured it), but you resist

the finality of that vision, its purity that
omits the possibility of rebellion or hope
or humanistic progress. But then one of
the villagers is condemned to death, with
his family, for stealing food, and the dis
tance of Imamura's camera from the
"execution" creates, for the first time, a
sense of authentic tragedy. Imamura is in
terested in the very emotions that the laws
of survival in this brutal society work to
suppress— and he's a terrific director. As
Orin, the woman who must go to
"Narayama," Sumiko Sakomota gives a
superb performance.

Thomas wrote some terrific dialogue;
Robert Zemeckis, the director, employs
his camera as a jokester narrator, setting
up and unfolding the story and punctuat
ing it with visual punch lines. The picture
is a beauty: Dean Cundey, the photog
rapher, has shot the jungle scenes (filmed
on location in Mexico) with a nearly hy
perbolic vividness and clarity, and
Zemeckis gives the adventure sequences
the deluxe treatment. With the gifted
comedienne Kathleen Turner, Michael
Douglas (who tries but doesn't quite fill
the Harrison Ford-style hero role), and
Danny DeVito as a hilariously foreshor
tened comic villain.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30
p.m.
Breaking Away (1979)
Kresge Auditorum
Steve Tesich has laid his screenplay in
Bloomington, Indiana, where he spent his
teenage years, and the four boys (played
by Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid,
Daniel Stern and Jackie Earle Haley) who
are the protgaonists are so intricately
drawn that by the end of the movie you
feel you've known them all your life.
Tesich has a talent for funny, naturalistic
dialogue and for sketching the
idiosyncrasies of his characters so that
they don't seem eccentric; he even writes
first-rate monologues. This picture is
about the inevitable development of the
boys into separate directions, but Tesich
and the director, Peter Yates, whose work
here is understated and kindly, see the
state of change as affirmative. Beautifully
acted by the boys and by Paul Dooley and
Barbara Barrie as Dennis Christopher's
parents, "Breaking Away" has a stinging

comic beauty.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9:30.
Casque d'Or (1952)
Cubberley Theatre (6000 Middlefield
Road), Palo Alto
Jacques Becker set his film amid the
Parisian criminal element at the turn of
the century. It's a fairly conventional
romantic melodrama, or it would be with
out Simone Signoret's magnificent perfor
mance as Marie, the courtesan who falls
tragically in love (with Serge Reggiani).
The cast also includes Claude Dauphin;
Becker co-authored the screenplay with
Jacques Companeez.
Plays Wednesday evening at 8.
The Chaplin Review (1918-23)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
Three of Charlie Chaplin's funniest
short films from First National: "A Dog's
Life" (1918), the great World War I com
edy "Shoulder Arms" (released'just
weeks before the Armistice), and"The
Pilgrim" (1923), in which Chaplin, an
escaped convict, disguises himself as a
minister. The usual crew shows up in all
three — Edna Purviance, Mack Swain,
Sydney Chaplin, Henry Bergman, et al.
Plays Monday with "Modern Times."
Romeo and Juliet (1968)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
Franco Zeffirelli stages opera as though
it were film, but his movies are barely
competent: the camera moves around so
much (and so pointlessly) that you get a
headache trying to focus on the action,
and surely no major director has ever
done such an appalling job of framing —
he cuts his actors to ribbons. In this scan
dalously popular botch of Shakespeare's
lyrical tragedy, the acting is, with a few ex
ceptions, so atrocious that the framing
seems to be a case of the punishment fit
ting the crime. This "Romeo and Juliet,"
in which Romeo (Leonard Whiting)
enters cradling a flower and Mercutio
(John McEnery) might be on acid during
the Queen Mab speech, is more like an
updated "West Side Story" than Shake

speare — talk about reduction! With
Olivia Hussey as Juliet, Milo O'Shea as
Friar Laurence, Michael York as Tybalt,
Pat Heywood as the Nurse.
Plays Sunday with "Brother Sun, Sister
Moon."
16 Candles (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
The young actress Molly Ringwald has
fashioned a comic style out of 1980s
teenage cool. She is utterly charming in
this messy, overloaded but surprisingly
enjoyable little picture written and di
rected by John Hughes, in which she plays
a girl whose family forgets her 16th
birthday in the flurry of preparations for
her sister's wedding. Hughes invents so
many subplots that he can't possibly
them all spinning simultaneously, aft so
sometimes you get the impression he for
got to shoot crucial scenes, or left them in
the editing room by accident. But he has a
talent for writing adolescent dialogue (the
grown-ups' lines are hopeless), and when
Molly Ringwald or Anthony Michael Hall,
as a high school freshman named Ted the
Geek, is on screen, the movie sparkles.
These two get to know each other in the
automotives shop during a school dance;
they appear at first like an implausible
couple of friends, but Ringwald and Hall
make their characters so likable that by
the end of the scene their camaraderie
seems perfectly natural. With Justin
Henry as Ringwald's kid brother, Paul
Dooley as her father, Blanche Baker as
her sister, Michael Schoffling as the senior
she adores, and, as Ted's nerdy pals, a pair
of effortless charmers — John Cusack and
Darren Harrris.
Plays today with "Footloose."
The Ballad of Narayama (1984)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
327-3240
Set in northern Japan a century ago,
Shohei Imamura's film presents a harsh
vision of life on the edge of poverty, and
pursues it relentlessly — almost, one feels

for the first half of the film, mercilessly. In
a village on the slope of Mount Shinshy,
the society is an elemental one, centered
on food and sex, and the necessity of sub
ordinating the more luxurious human
emotions, like tenderness and pity, to the
practical considerations of feeding a fam
ily has given rise to two immutable laws:
TTiose who steal food must be punished in
a way that prevents any further threat to
the supply, and when a man or woman
grows too old to contribute to the family,
the eldest son must carry him or her on his
back to "Narayama" — to the mountain,
to die alone. For a long while the movie,
which is based on a novel by Shichiro
Fukazawa, is tough going: You can admit
that Imamura's vision has its own austere
beauty (and that the photographer, Masao
Tochizawa, has captured it), but you resist

the finality of that vision, its purity that
omits the possibility of rebellion or hope
or humanistic progress. But then one of
the villagers is condemned to death, with
his family, for stealing food, and the dis
tance of Imamura's camera from the
"execution" creates, for the first time, a
sense of authentic tragedy. Imamura is in
terested in the very emotions that the laws
of survival in this brutal society work to
suppress— and he's a terrific director. As
Orin, the woman who must go to
"Narayama," Sumiko Sakomota gives a
superb performance.

Follow the Fleet (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
By consensus, the three greatest Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals are
"Swing Time," "Top Hat" and"The Gay
Divorcee"; "Follow the Fleet" must
surely own fourth place. Astaire, in a rare
working-class role, plays a gum-chewing
sailor who, on shore leave, teams up with
his old vaudeville partner, Rogers,
dance hall hostess, to win a dance contest.
The Dwight Taylor/Allan Scott script
(based on a play by Hubert Osborne
called "Shore Leave") has its dead spots:
There's a romance between Rogers' sister
and Astaire's buddy that kills a good half
hour of the continuity — not least because
the second bananas, Harriet Hilliard and
Randolph Scott, to quote Arlene Croce,
"go together like red whiskey and
Seconal." But Mark Sandrich, the direc
tor, keeps things light, and the glorious Ir
ving Berlin score ("We Saw the Sea,"
"Let Yourself Go," "I'd Rather Lead a
Band," "I'm Putting All My Eggs in One
Basket," "Let's Face the Music and
Dance") provides the stars with some
wonderful opportunities. This was Rogers'
breakthrough film: Her dancing is terrific
and her clowning ebullient. With Lucille
Ball and Betty Grable in bits.
Plays through Wednesday with "Flying
Down to Rio."
Flying Down to Rio (1933)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Dated, certainly, but an enchantingly
naive early musical, in which chorines kick
their little hearts out on the wings of a
Depression-era plane as it sweeps through
the skies. More importantly, this was the
film that introduced Fred Astaire to
Ginger Rogers; they play subordinate
roles (to Dolores Del Rio, Gene
Raymond and Raul Roulien), but their
ballroom number, "The Carioca," steals
the picture clean away. Vincent Youmans
set lyrics by Edward Eliscu and Gus Kahn
to mostly memorable music — it's nearly
impossible to get the title tune or "Music
Makes Me" out of your head. Thornton
Freeland directed a fatuous screenplay by

Cyril Hume, H.W. Hanemann and Erwin
Gelsey (out of an Anne Caldwell play).
Plays through Wednesday with "Follow
the Fleet."
Romancing the Stone (1984)

A very entertaining adventure spoof

Romeo and Juliet (1968)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
Franco Zeffirelli stages opera as though
it were film, but his movies are barely
competent: the camera moves around so
much (and so pointlessly) that you get a
headache trying to focus on the action,
and surely no major director has ever
done such an appalling job of framing —
he cuts his actors to ribbons. In this scan
dalously popular botch of Shakespeare's
lyrical tragedy, the acting is, with a few ex
ceptions, so atrocious that the framing
seems to be a case of the punishment fit
ting the crime. This "Romeo and Juliet,"
in which Romeo (Leonard Whiting)
enters cradling a flower and Mercutio
(John McEnery) might be on acid during
the Queen Mab speech, is more like an
updated "West Side Story" than Shake

speare — talk about reduction! With
Olivia Hussey as Juliet, Milo O'Shea as
Friar Laurence, Michael York as Tybalt,
Pat Heywood as the Nurse.
Plays Sunday with "Brother Sun, Sister
Moon."
16 Candles (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
The young actress Molly Ringwald has
fashioned a comic style out of 1980s
teenage cool. She is utterly charming in
this messy, overloaded but surprisingly
enjoyable little picture written and di
rected by John Hughes, in which she plays
a girl whose family forgets her 16th
birthday in the flurry of preparations for
her sister's wedding. Hughes invents so
many subplots that he can't possibly
them all spinning simultaneously, aft so
sometimes you get the impression he for
got to shoot crucial scenes, or left them in
the editing room by accident. But he has a
talent for writing adolescent dialogue (the
grown-ups' lines are hopeless), and when
Molly Ringwald or Anthony Michael Hall,
as a high school freshman named Ted the
Geek, is on screen, the movie sparkles.
These two get to know each other in the
automotives shop during a school dance;
they appear at first like an implausible
couple of friends, but Ringwald and Hall
make their characters so likable that by
the end of the scene their camaraderie
seems perfectly natural. With Justin
Henry as Ringwald's kid brother, Paul
Dooley as her father, Blanche Baker as
her sister, Michael Schoffling as the senior
she adores, and, as Ted's nerdy pals, a pair
of effortless charmers — John Cusack and
Darren Harrris.
Plays today with "Footloose."
The Ballad of Narayama (1984)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
327-3240
Set in northern Japan a century ago,
Shohei Imamura's film presents a harsh
vision of life on the edge of poverty, and
pursues it relentlessly — almost, one feels

for the first half of the film, mercilessly. In
a village on the slope of Mount Shinshy,
the society is an elemental one, centered
on food and sex, and the necessity of sub
ordinating the more luxurious human
emotions, like tenderness and pity, to the
practical considerations of feeding a fam
ily has given rise to two immutable laws:
TTiose who steal food must be punished in
a way that prevents any further threat to
the supply, and when a man or woman
grows too old to contribute to the family,
the eldest son must carry him or her on his
back to "Narayama" — to the mountain,
to die alone. For a long while the movie,
which is based on a novel by Shichiro
Fukazawa, is tough going: You can admit
that Imamura's vision has its own austere
beauty (and that the photographer, Masao
Tochizawa, has captured it), but you resist

the finality of that vision, its purity that
omits the possibility of rebellion or hope
or humanistic progress. But then one of
the villagers is condemned to death, with
his family, for stealing food, and the dis
tance of Imamura's camera from the
"execution" creates, for the first time, a
sense of authentic tragedy. Imamura is in
terested in the very emotions that the laws
of survival in this brutal society work to
suppress— and he's a terrific director. As
Orin, the woman who must go to
"Narayama," Sumiko Sakomota gives a
superb performance.
