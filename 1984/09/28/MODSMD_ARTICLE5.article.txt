The University will oppose Local 680 of the Ser
vice Employees International Union in elections
scheduled for Oct. 30, University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The election has been scheduled by the National
Labor Relations Board for 1,330 technical, mainte
nance and service workers.
"On the labor relations front, we run on a record
that is good," Kennedy said. "We are prepared to
let that record speak for itself, to let the workers
have a choice they would not have had without this
election."
Kennedy reported that a settlement was reached
with the local on Sept. 17, prior to a hearing before

an NLRB administrative law judge.
"By petitioning for (the) election. Local 680 has,
in effect, conceded that those workers are un
represented," Kennedy said. He emphasized that it
would be "an election de novo, not an election for
the purpose of validating a previous disaffiliation
vote.
"Workers have now been given a choice they
would not have had if we had not persevered" in
questioning the local's claim to represent them.
"Stanford will take a position, and its position
w 11 be in favor of no union," Kennedy said.
"We feci a strong responsibility to workers, and
our feeling is they would be better off without this
representation."

On another topic, Kennedy reported that a
"rolling controversy" with the Departments of
Defense, State and Commerce over attempts to ap
ply export control laws to publication of research
results now appears to have reached "a happy
result."
Kennedy was a leader in organizing opposition
among major universities to this attempt.
