# Kennedy says he will fight USW

### 
The University will oppose Local 680 of the Ser
vice Employees International Union in elections
scheduled for Oct. 30, University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The election has been scheduled by the National
Labor Relations Board for 1,330 technical, mainte
nance and service workers.
"On the labor relations front, we run on a record
that is good," Kennedy said. "We are prepared to
let that record speak for itself, to let the workers
have a choice they would not have had without this
election."
Kennedy reported that a settlement was reached
with the local on Sept. 17, prior to a hearing before

an NLRB administrative law judge.
"By petitioning for (the) election. Local 680 has,
in effect, conceded that those workers are un
represented," Kennedy said. He emphasized that it
would be "an election de novo, not an election for
the purpose of validating a previous disaffiliation
vote.
"Workers have now been given a choice they
would not have had if we had not persevered" in
questioning the local's claim to represent them.
"Stanford will take a position, and its position
w 11 be in favor of no union," Kennedy said.
"We feci a strong responsibility to workers, and
our feeling is they would be better off without this
representation."

Research controversy
On another topic, Kennedy reported that a
"rolling controversy" with the Departments of
Defense, State and Commerce over attempts to ap
ply export control laws to publication of research
results now appears to have reached "a happy
result."
Kennedy was a leader in organizing opposition
among major universities to this attempt.
Restrictions on military technology and associ
ated data would be "misapplied" to knowledge and
basic research, he said. Through
formation of the Defense
Department-University Forum,
which he heads with Richard
DeLauer, head of research and devel
opment for the Defense Department,
most of these difficulties were suc
cessfully negotiated.
For a while, it looked as though
"rather restrictive terms" would limit
open publication and the access of
foreign students to unclassified re
search, Kennedy said. But the univer
sities "took up arms once again" and
now believe the problem "has been

settled in an entirely satisfactory fas
hion."
Campus housing
Following a report from History
Prof. Paul Robinson, head of the
Committee on Graduate Studies,
both Kennedy and Provost James
Rosse indicated they were trying to
find "constructive, instructive" ways
of meeting the housing concerns of
both undergraduate and graduate
students.
Robinson expressed concern over
the "somewhat ominous" tendency
last spring to emphasize the conflict
between graduate students living in
Escondido and undergraduates in the
newly built Governor's Corner com

plex, whose costs are spread over the
entire student residence system.
Kennedy noted that "most
graduate students, especially single
graduate students, preferred to live
off campus" until the fairly recent
surge in local rent and housing costs.
"No decision has been made to
seek housing for undergraduates in
preference to graduate students — no
preference either way," he said.
"Indeed, we're seeking ways to meet
both needs in ways that are program
matically interesting to students."
English Prof. John Bender strongly
supported the possibility of housing
graduates and undergraduates to
gether but admitted a problem in
herent in that system: The former like
Mozart while the latter may be more

inclined toward hard, rock music.
New Med School Dean
Early in the session, Kennedy said
he hoped to be able to announce the
appointment of a new Medical School
dean "no later than the end of next
week," although negotiations for
such positions are "sometimes
derailed."
Expanded to 55 members this year,
the Faculty Senate happens to have
six of its former chairmen, 15 elected
representatives returning after an ab
sence of a year or more, and 10 "truly
new" members, according to Law
Prof. John Merryman. its current
chairman.
