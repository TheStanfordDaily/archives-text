Honduras halts training program
MEXICO CITY — The Honduran government said yesterday that it
was halting a U.S. program under which Green Berets have trained Sal
vadoran troops on Honduran soil.
I he action represented a setback for U.S. efforts to improve the per
formance of the army in El Salvador against a strong left-wing insur
gency in that country bordering Honduras.
U.S. Special Forces, known as Green Berets, established a training
center at Puerto Castilla, Honduras, in June 1983 to provide training of
Salvadoran forces without sending more U.S. advisers to El Salvador or
paying to train additional Salvadorans in the United States.
Yesterday's announcement could also represent a significant step for
Honduras toward a foreign policy that is more independent of Washing
ton. It was the first such major policy shift since the ouster in March of
an armed forces commander who was closely identified with the United
States.
The Honduran Armed Forces' chief spokesman. Col. Cesar Elvir
Sierra, said yesterday in Tegucigalpa that Honduras' National Security
Council had taken the action because of lack of progress in talks be
tween Honduras and El Salvador over a longstanding border dispute.
"There has been no progress in the negotiations over the border prob
lem. Therefore the government has revised its position on the presence
of Salvadoran troops here," the spokesman said in a telephone inter
view.
Diplomats said that another major reason for the change was the
Hondurans' desire to demonstrate their independence of Washington.
"They're perfectly willing to be seen as friends of the United States, but
they're very anxious not to be seen as puppets," said a senior diplomat
who recently met with the new Honduran armed forces chief. Gen. Wal
ter Lopez.
CIA disputes president's claim
WASHINGTON — Past and present CIA officials yesterday disputed
President Reagan's campaign claim on Wednesday that there was a
"near-destruction of our intelligence capability" before he took office.
Aides to Reagan's own CIA director William Casey yesterday said
that neither budget nor personnel levels were cut unduly during the
Carter years. Cuts in the covert operations branch under Carter's CIA
director, Adm. Stansfield Turner, briefly became an issue when agency
old-timers and some others fought them. But officials said yesterday
these were almost exclusively from headquarters bureaucrats, and none
was an operative or agent overseas.
A general decision to make some cuts in CIA personnel was made
after the Vietnam War in 1976 and early 1977 when George Bush,
Reagan's vice president, was CIA director, these officials said. This deci
sion was executed and accelerated during the Carter administration.
But officials also said that Reagan had indeed seen improvement over
his three and one-half years in office in the intelligence he receives,
largely because of improvement in satellites and other intelligence tech
nology. In addition, this official said that morale has improved in the in
telligence community under Reagan and efforts have been made to ex
pand the so-called human intelligence or information obtained from
spies.
"What he sees as president and knows about what is going on," this
official said, "just makes him feel what we're doing now is much better."
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said yesterday this does not
justify Reagan's statements because those technical improvements were
set in motion in previous administrations, especially during the Carter
years.
Moynihan, who is vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, and several other intelligence experts yesterday questioned
whether there have been improvements in intelligence gathered by
humans. Senior Reagan administration officials complain privately that
that kind of intelligence is still not very good.

Democrats attack Reagan remarks
- -■ • <4 ft . t i* ii |
WASHINGTON — President Reagan was quickly attacked by
Democrats yesterday for his statement that the bombing of the U.S. Em
bassy annex in Beirut last week could be blamed on the "near
destruction" of American intelligence capability before he took office.
Reagan just as quickly retreated, saying his remarks had been
"distorted" by the press, and the White House said later that Reagan did
not mean to pin the "entire" blame for the intelligence cutbacks on his
predecessor, President Carter.
Carter, in a statement from Atlanta, said Reagan's charge "is per
sonally insulting and too gross in its implications to ignore. He only has
to question his own administration officials to determine that his state
ment was also completely false."
Carter's CIA director, Adm. Stansfield Turner, said Reagan's com
ments "are undignified and unworthy of a president. It is Reagan who
has damaged the CIA by putting in people of questionable character . . .
he has politicized the CIA with (Director William) Casey."
"What do you read about CIA today?" Turner asked in an interview.
"You read about a diicctur who has shady financial dealings and is in
volved in questionable legality and propriety in the secret war in
Nicaragua .... No wonder they are not collecting intelligence in Beirut
because they're trying to undermine the government of Nicaragua."
Turner also said it was "too ludicrous for words that a president who
has been in office for three and one-half years would try to blame the
past" for the latest terrorist attack.
Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, who was Carter's
vice president, said Reagan's remark was "inexcusable" and"he should
stand up and say he is responsible" for the Beirut attack.
Indian to join space shuttle
NEW DELHI, India — An Indian scientist will be included on a 1986
U.S. space shuttle mission, it was announced yesterday at Bangalore, the
Indian space center.
The announcement, also made in Washington, means that India will
become the first nation to have had space travelers in both U.S. and So
viet space programs.
Seven months ago, Indian fighter pilot Rakesh Sharma became a na
tional hero by riding a Soviet Soyuz T-ll spacecraft to a rendezvous
with an orbital space station. Yesterday's announcement that India has
accepted NASA's invitation to take part in the U.S. program is seen by
many here as a successful public relations effort by the United States to
counter some of the massive Indian attention received by the Soviets
after their April space mission with the Indian fighter pilot.
It is also seen as a significant accomplishment for India's space pro
gram, which at times has been forced by budget limitations to use bul
lock carts to test rocket telemetry and which has shared and borrowed
scientific data from almost every other country with a program.
"It symbolizes that we have worldwide cooperation and that space
doesn't have any national boundaries," said Yash Pal, secretary of the
Indian Department of Science and Technology and a founder of the In
dian space program. "A new global ethic must prevail."
The offer for an Indian astronaut to travel on a space shuttle flight was
first made by NASA administrator James Beggs to Indian space director
Satish Dhawan at a meeting of the U.N. outer space committee 18
months ago, sources here said.
Disneyland open despite strike
ANAHEIM — A three-day strike by more than 1,800 workers
against Disneyland has caused no curtailment of attractions, safety prob
lems or loss of attendance, the amusement park officials said yesterday.
About 400 of the 1.000 white-collar workers Disneyland specially
trained have taken over the duties of strikers, from keeping the park
clean to selling tickets to operating rides.
Stocks cautiously edge ahead
NEW YORK — Stocks cautiously edged ahead for the fourth straight
session yesterday, mainly by protecting the bulk of an opening upsurge.
The early advance came as a quarter-point cut in the prime lending
rate, to 12 percent, spread through the banking industry.
Today's weather
Slightly cooler today but continued sunny and mild through the
weekend. High temperatures in the 80s and overnight lows in the 50s.
