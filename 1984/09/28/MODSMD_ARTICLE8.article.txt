# Mondale hopeful after Gromyko talk
## 
### 
NEW YORK â€” Democratic presidential candi
date Walter Mondale, emerging frorp a yd-minute
chat with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko, said yesterday that there seems to be an
"opportunity for significant progress" toward arms
control when President Reagan meets Gromyko
today.
Mondale's upbeat assessment ran counter to the
impression created by Gromyko in a speech earlier
in the day to the United Nations. The Democratic
candidate appeared to be stepping up the political
pressure on Reagan to produce a major
breakthrough in U.S.-Soviet relations.
The Soviet ministry of foreign affairs responded
to yesterday's meeting with a statement appearing
to suggest that Mondale, if elected, would be more
likely than Reagan to achieve an arms-control
agreement.
The statement said that some of the ideas
Mondale suggested, "should they materialize in
Washington's policy, would open up certain pos
sibilites for bringing the positions of the two powers
closer and for subsequent agreements on arms
limitations and disarmament, above all in the field

of nuclear weapons."
Mondale met with Gromyko in an ornate room
at the Soviet mission here just one day before the
Soviet leader plans to visit the White House for his
first formal meeting with Reagan since the presi
dent's inauguration.
"I do believe there is an opportunity tommorrow
to make significant progress," Mondale told
reporters after his meeting. "It is just possible there
is some opportunity in the arms-control field. I
would hope for progress in other areas, but I have
nothing to go on in the other areas."
He later added: "I think there's an opportunity.
How much, I have no way of knowing."
Mondale, who pressed Gromyko to bring the So
viet Union back into the arms-control talks that
they abandoned a year ago, declined to say
precisely what the Kremlin leader told him to spur
his sense of optimism. He cautioned that he could
not predict the outcome of the Reagan-Gromyko
meeting and noted "I'm not in a position to know
what might be going on behind the scenes."
"No assurances, no guarantees, nothing of that
kind was given," he said. "This is just an estimate
on my part. You have to make certain judgements

about what you think you're hearing and what it
means."
The Democratic nominee previously declared
that Reagan's meeting should produce a scheduled
U.S.-Soviet summit, a breakthrough in arms con
trol or a promise of progress in human rights in the
Soviet Union.
But Mondale rejected a suggestion that he was
intentionally creating high expectations against
which the voters will measure the outcome of the
Reagan-Gromyko meeting. He insisted that his
meeting with Gromyko was not politically
motivated, but added that he would probably make
another statement after today's meeting at the
White House.
Mondale refused to recount anything that
Gromyko told him. He said that Gromyko's state
ments at the meeting were similar to his U.N.
speech, that he spent most of his time talking about
arms control with particular emphasis on the need
to control weapons in space, which is a major
theme of the Mondale campaign.
It was Mondale's third meeting with Gromyko in
10 years, and came at the invitation of the Soviets.
