# Gromyko denounces U.S. policies
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS — Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko,
warming up for his meeting today
with President Reagan, blamed the
United States yesterday for a long list
of world problems and accused
Washington of "declaring legitimate
any criminal ways and means" that
serve its purposes.
Gromyko's speech to the U.N.
General Assembly drew an angry
response from Secretary of State
George Shultz, possibly indicating
that the veteran Soviet diplomat had
been less strident in his private talks
with Shultz Wednesday than he was
in his public address.
Although Gromyko closed on a
relatively up-beat note by asserting
that it is still "possible to right the
current alarming tilt in international
developments," his speech as a whole
contrasted sharply with the con
ciliatory approach that marked
Reagan's address to the same audi
ence Monday.
Reagan used none of the angry
anti-Soviet rhetoric — such as calling
the Soviet Union an "evil empire" —
that has characterized many of his
public statements, but Gromyko ob
served no such restraint.
Although he did not mention
Reagan by name, Gromyko several
times denounced U.S. policy in lan

guage clearly aimed at the president.
Speaking of American leaders,
Gromyko said, "They have no
scruples about declaring legitimate
any criminal ways and means if these
can serve the desired ends." The
phrase seemed to be crafted as an
echo of Reagan's remark — not
repeated recently — that the Soviets
"reserve unto themselves the right to
commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in
order to attain [their goals]."
Shultz sat through Gromyko's 75-
minute speech with a studied frown
on his face, looking as if he were im
itating Gromyko's stone-faced
demeanor as he listened to Reagan's
speech three days earlier. Shultz did
not join in the brief applause that
marked the conclusion of the Soviet
foreign minister's address. Gromyko
was not interrupted by applause;
Reagan was interrupted once.
As he left the United Nations after
Gromyko's speech, Shultz, who met
privately with his Soviet opposite
number for almost three hours Wed
nesday, vented his anger in front of
U.S. television cameras.
"It's sad and disappointing," the
secretary of state said, "that Mr.
Gromyko should give us yet another
misrepresentation of history and dis
tortion of the peaceful and con
structive role of the United States in

world affairs. I can only say, as Presi
dent Reagan did Monday, that we
will try and try again to bring forth a
more constructive relationship with
the Soviet Union in the interests of
world peace."
More than half of Gromyko's
speech was devoted to arms control
— nuclear, chemical and conven
tional — which he said the Soviet
Union supports. He accused the
United States and its partners in
NATO of sabotaging all efforts to
halt and reverse the arms race. And
he reiterated that the Soviet Union
would not resume arms control talks
as long as U.S. Pershing 2 and cruise
missiles remain deployed in Europe.
He said that international efforts to
control arms "do not find a solution
because the NATO states do not
want it. The instigator of this policy is
Washington."
After his U.N. speech, the Soviet
foreign minister met privately with
Democratic presidential candidate
Walter Mondale.
In his speech, Gromyko renewed
the Soviet call for a "quantitative and
qualitative freeze" on nuclear weap
ons, for a mutual renunciation of the
first use of nuclear weapons, for a ban
on space weaponry and for new re
strictions on the production of chemi
cal weapons. The United States and

its allies have rejected all of those
proposals because, U.S. officials have
said, conditions attached by the
Soviets made them unacceptable.
U.S. officials would not respond to
those points yesterday except to note
that none was new.
Washington has also previously
rejected the Soviet Union's demand
that the United States agree to
withdraw its intermediate-range
missiles from Western Europe before
talks on both strategic and
intermediate-range missiles can be
resumed. The Soviets broke off the
separate sets of negotiations in
Geneva late last year.
"The Soviet Union is in favor of
serious talks," Gromyko said. "Our
proposals on the limitation and re
duction of strategic arms and on
limitation of nuclear arms in Europe
remain valid. But unless these obsta
cles (a clear reference to the missiles
in Europe) are removed, of course,
the talks will not take place — which
is what the U.S. has in mind."
On other topics, Gromyko
denounced Washington for "banditry
committed against tiny Grenada,
which dared to assert its sover
eignty" and "gross interference in
the internal affairs of El Salvador."

More than half of Gromyko's
speech was devoted to arms control
— nuclear, chemical and conven
tional — which he said the Soviet
Union supports. He accused the
United States and its partners in
NATO of sabotaging all efforts to
halt and reverse the arms race. And
he reiterated that the Soviet Union
would not resume arms control talks
as long as U.S. Pershing 2 and cruise
missiles remain deployed in Europe.
He said that international efforts to
control arms "do not find a solution
because the NATO states do not
want it. The instigator of this policy is
Washington."
After his U.N. speech, the Soviet
foreign minister met privately with
Democratic presidential candidate
Walter Mondale.
In his speech, Gromyko renewed
the Soviet call for a "quantitative and
qualitative freeze" on nuclear weap
ons, for a mutual renunciation of the
first use of nuclear weapons, for a ban
on space weaponry and for new re
strictions on the production of chemi
cal weapons. The United States and

its allies have rejected all of those
proposals because, U.S. officials have
said, conditions attached by the
Soviets made them unacceptable.
U.S. officials would not respond to
those points yesterday except to note
that none was new.
Washington has also previously
rejected the Soviet Union's demand
that the United States agree to
withdraw its intermediate-range
missiles from Western Europe before
talks on both strategic and
intermediate-range missiles can be
resumed. The Soviets broke off the
separate sets of negotiations in
Geneva late last year.
"The Soviet Union is in favor of
serious talks," Gromyko said. "Our
proposals on the limitation and re
duction of strategic arms and on
limitation of nuclear arms in Europe
remain valid. But unless these obsta
cles (a clear reference to the missiles
in Europe) are removed, of course,
the talks will not take place — which
is what the U.S. has in mind."
On other topics, Gromyko
denounced Washington for "banditry
committed against tiny Grenada,
which dared to assert its sover
eignty" and "gross interference in
the internal affairs of El Salvador."
