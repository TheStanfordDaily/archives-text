Stanford Students need
to laugh.
You can help
We need biweekly humorous columns to
run on the opinions page. The deadline
for regular opinions columns is still today
by 5 P.M.. However, those of you who
have a flair for humor have until
tomorrow at 5 P.M. to turn in your three
to four-page sample columns typed
double-spaced on a 57-character line to
the Opinions box in The Daily office.
Thanks. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha. We're laughing already.
