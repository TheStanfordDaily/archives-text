# Libel suit stalls in appeal
## 
### HEATHER WRIGHT Staff writer 
Law Prof. John Kaplan's $ 1 million
libel suit against Newsweek has
reached the Court of Appeals and
will probably remain there for at least
a year.
Kaplan's suit was rejected by the
U.S. District Court in August. The
court ruled that a Newsweek article
listing Kaplan's criminal law course as
a "mick" was an expression of
opinion, which is not actionable.
But Kaplan hopes the Court of Ap
peals will reverse that decision.
The trouble began last October
when Newsweek On Campus pub
lished "A Giggle of Guts," an article
listing the "mick" or "easiest A"
courses on major college campuses.
Kaplan's popular course on criminal
law was cited as "the easiest five
credits a Stanford student can earn."
Though the article was necessarily
based on opinion, it also contained
many factual errors.
For example, Newsweek wrote that
students could commonly be found
listening to a broadcast of Kaplan's
course while sunbathing at Deguerre
pool. KZSU confirmed that the
course was only aired at night.
Newsweek also wrote that Kaplan
gave a take-home midterm, which he
did not.
Kaplan's initial demand was that
Newsweek print a correction and
retraction. But when the magazine
refused, Kaplan filed suit for
$500,000 in punitive damages and
$500,000 more in compensatory da
mages, stating that Newsweek had
printed false information with reck
less disregard for the truth and with
intent to injure and disgrace him.
Since Kaplan is a guest professor at
Harvard this year, he will have to

fight his case from afar. In a tele
phone interview, however, Kaplan
said the distance should pose no extra
problem.
"The appeals court will decide
whether the judge's decision was
wrong," he said. "If it does, we're
back where we started from. Then we
can just hope that the judge comes to
the right decision."
