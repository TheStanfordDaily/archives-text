# Mondale calls president 'inflexible'

WASHINGTON — Democratic
presidential candidate Walter
Mondale, portraying President
Reagan as inflexiable in arms-control
talks, indicated yesterday that he
could have agreed with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
on a temporary moratorium on space
weaponry development.
Mondale, who met with Gromkyo
a day before the Soviet leader visited
the White House, said that Reagan
failed to make any progress toward
arms control with Gromyko because
he approached their meeting with the
attitude: "Well, we'll just sit and wait
and see what they do."
"There were two or three obvious
ways that we might have boldly at
tempted to move toward arms control
in ways that do not hurt our security
.. . to try and take a step, as John
Kennedy did, to challenge the Soviets
and then if they responded favorably,
put it in treaty form," Mondale told a
news conference following his weekly
radio broadcast.
The first option Mondale men
tioned was a temporary moratorium
on the development of space weap
ons. U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz said yesterday that Gromyko

came to Washington proposing a
freeze on space weaponry, but that
Reagan could consider agreeing to
that only if substantive negotiations
were already under way.
It was not clear whether Mondale,
when he spoke, was aware of what
Shultz had said, but during the cam
paign Mondale has consistently
spoken in favor of a temporary freeze
on space weaponry development.
In answer to a question, Mondale
denied that he would have been
making a major concession to the
Soviets by agreeing to such a
moratorium without first bringing
them back to the bargaining table.
"What I'm talking about is a tempo
rary moratorium in time and detail
which does two things — it's
verifiable, so we'll know if the Soviets
are complying, and it's a short enough
period so it in no way interferes with
our national security," he said.
On Thursday, after Mondale met
with Gromyko, a Soviet Foreign min
istry representative issued a state
ment in New York suggesting that
Mondale, if elected, would be more
likely than Reagan to reach arms
control accords. It said that some
Mondale ideas, "should they

materialize in Washington's policy,
would open up certain possibilities
for bringing the positions of the two
powers closer and for subsequent
agreements on arms limitations and
disarmament, above all in the field of
nuclear weapons."
Citing two other ways the president
could have challenged the Soviets to
respond, Mondale told the news con
ference that when Reagan met with
Gromyko he could have revived the
so-called "walk-in-the-woods" pro
posal for control of medium-range
missiles in Europe or suggested a
temporary ban on underground test
ing.
The so-called "walk-in-the
woods" proposal stems from a possi
ble solution discussed by the U.S. and
Soviet negotiators during an informal
stroll before their talks broke off last
year.
Mondale, who after his own
meeting with Gromyko sought to
raise expectations that the Reagan-
Gromyko meeting could producc sig
nificant results, said that the presi
dent's failure to explore any of these
options created "a situation that is
both disappointing and the basis of
apprehension."

He called on Reagan to "take steps
that serve our national security inter
est, that get us off the dime . . and
to tell the American people what
happened during his talks with
Gromyko.
"1 believe the president has a duty
to hold his own news conference and
tell the American people what we're
to make of this," Mondale said. "To
tell the American people what did
they try? What did the Soviets
respond with? Did we do what we
honorably could have done to move
forward, to make progress in this
most important issue facing the
human race?"
Mondale said that events of the
past few weeks have "exposed"
Reagan's lack of leadership. Al
though polls show that Reagan is con
sidered to be much stronger than his
Democratic challenger in the cate
gory of leadership, Mondale said that
he should be winning on that issue.
"We have a president who's not
really in charge," he said. "In other
words, he's not mastering the details.
He's not leading in crucial ques
tions."
