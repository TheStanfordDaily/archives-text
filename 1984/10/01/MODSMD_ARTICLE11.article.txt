President calls Carter
WASHINGTON The White House announced
Friday that President Reagan telephoned former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter that morning to say he did not intend
to suggest that the Carter administration was responsible
for the bombing ot the United States Embassy in
Lebanon.
Carter and many other prominent Democrats criticzed
Reagan for remarks that he made last week that seemed
to suggest that the Carter administration was partly to
blame for the embassy bombing because of a decline in
the capabilities of the CIA during the Carter aministra
tion.
A White House official said Reagan's comments about
intelligence failures had been "misleading" and that the
president was referring to a "decade-long decline" in in
telligence gathering.
The official said Reagan told Carter during their con
version, "I was not suggesting that you or your adminis
tration were responsible for the declinig intelligence capa
bility, and I certainly did not suggest that your administra
tion was the cause of that happening at the embassy in
Beirut."
"He just wanted Carter to understand what he meant
by his statement," the official said.
A spokesman for Carter at the former president's At
lanta office said Carter had no comment on the telephone
call, which was made to Carter's home in Plains, Ga., and
lasted about four minutes.
Pakistani town bombed
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — On Friday Pakistan said 32

people were killed and 48 were injured when an Afghan
plane attacked the tiny bazaar town of Terri Mangal.
The attack took place at dusk on Thursday, an official
statement said.
This was the 11th attack on Terri Mangal, which is lo
cated just inside the Pakistani border, since Aug. 13. The
attacks are believed to be part of the Afghan armed
forces' efforts to pressure Pakistan and to keep rebels
from using the town as a base during the months-old siege
of a military outpost 15 miles away in eastern Afghanis
tan.
This last bombing was one of the most serious of the
more than 400 border violations that Pakistan claims to
have occurred since the Soviet military intervened in Af
ghanistan five years ago to back the Marxist government
in its fight to put down a Moslem rebellion.
South Korea gets aid
SEOUL, South Korea — A convoy of 725 North
Korean trucks rolled into South Korean territory Satur
day carrying the first supplies to pass between the two
countries since the Korean War ended 31 years ago.
The convoy brought tons of rice, medicine and cloth
that the North had volunteered as relief aid to victims of
recent floods in South Korea
It was the first time since before the Korean War broke
out in 1950 that goods moved freely across the demarca
tion line that separates the two intensely hostile Korean
states and represents a degree of cooperation unprece
dented in the bloody relationship between the two gov
ernments.
South Korean officials have called the North Korean
delivery nothing but a propaganda ploy, and they insisted

that they did not need the help. Nevertheless, the South
Korean Red Cross accepted the supplies in order to
reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
Victory for civil rights
WASHINGTON — Civil rights forces scored a major
victory Saturday as the Senate voted 92-4 to choke off
debate on legislation to override a Supreme Court ruling
that sharply narrowed the scope of federal anti
discrimination laws.
But conservatives continued to block passage of the
measure as part of a catchall spending bill to fund most
government agencies after the start of the new fiscal year
at 12:01 a.m. today.
Faced with prospects of a shutdown of these agencies if
the bill is not passed by today, the Senate unanimously ap
proved a two-day extension of the funding deadline.
If the House goes along, as it is expected to when it
returns at noon today, the Senate would have until mid
night tomorrow to complete action on the spending bill
and resolve differences with the House in a way that
would be acceptable to President Reagan.
The government also would not have to worry until
then about beginning an orderly shutdown of non
essential services, which it earlier had planned to invoke
by midday today unless Congress appeared likely to ap
prove a spending compromise satisfactory to Reagan.
But it was not clear Saturday when and how the Senate
might extract itself from its spectacular, ever-deepening
procedural snarl over the civil rights measure and various
conservative amendments on subjects including school
busing, gun controls and tuition tax credits, designed

partly to make life difficult for civil rights amendment
supporters.
Even if it gets past these hurdles, the Senate faces
scores of other proposed amendments to the spending bill
on subjects ranging from U.S. policy toward Central
America to local highway projects.
"Continuing resolutions" are supposed to allow contin
ued spending only by government agencies for which
Congress has not passed regular appropriations bills by
the start of a new fiscal year, Oct. 1. But, once the Senate
indicated earlier in the week that it would consider the
civil rights bill as an amendment, the measure became a
catchall vehicle for almost every piece of unfinished busi
ness on Capitol Hill.
Apartheid condemned
UNITED NATIONS — The General Assembly voted
almost unanimously Friday to condemn South Africa for
the "massacre" of blacks during recent civil unrest there.
There were no votes in opposition and only the United
States and Britain abstained.
The resolution, introduced by Botswana and co
sponsored by nearly all African members, repeated the
language of a Security Council resolution adopted Aug.
17, from which the United Nations and and Britain also
abstained, in declaring South Africa's new constitution to
be "null and void." The constitution gives parliamentary
representation to citizens of Asian and mixed-race des
cent for the first time, but it keeps the country's black
majority disenfranchised.

scores of other proposed amendments to the spending bill
on subjects ranging from U.S. policy toward Central
America to local highway projects.
"Continuing resolutions" are supposed to allow contin
ued spending only by government agencies for which
Congress has not passed regular appropriations bills by
the start of a new fiscal year, Oct. 1. But, once the Senate
indicated earlier in the week that it would consider the
civil rights bill as an amendment, the measure became a
catchall vehicle for almost every piece of unfinished busi
ness on Capitol Hill.
Apartheid condemned
UNITED NATIONS — The General Assembly voted
almost unanimously Friday to condemn South Africa for
the "massacre" of blacks during recent civil unrest there.
There were no votes in opposition and only the United
States and Britain abstained.
The resolution, introduced by Botswana and co
sponsored by nearly all African members, repeated the
language of a Security Council resolution adopted Aug.
17, from which the United Nations and and Britain also
abstained, in declaring South Africa's new constitution to
be "null and void." The constitution gives parliamentary
representation to citizens of Asian and mixed-race des
cent for the first time, but it keeps the country's black
majority disenfranchised.

President calls Carter
WASHINGTON The White House announced
Friday that President Reagan telephoned former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter that morning to say he did not intend
to suggest that the Carter administration was responsible
for the bombing ot the United States Embassy in
Lebanon.
Carter and many other prominent Democrats criticzed
Reagan for remarks that he made last week that seemed
to suggest that the Carter administration was partly to
blame for the embassy bombing because of a decline in
the capabilities of the CIA during the Carter aministra
tion.
A White House official said Reagan's comments about
intelligence failures had been "misleading" and that the
president was referring to a "decade-long decline" in in
telligence gathering.
The official said Reagan told Carter during their con
version, "I was not suggesting that you or your adminis
tration were responsible for the declinig intelligence capa
bility, and I certainly did not suggest that your administra
tion was the cause of that happening at the embassy in
Beirut."
"He just wanted Carter to understand what he meant
by his statement," the official said.
A spokesman for Carter at the former president's At
lanta office said Carter had no comment on the telephone
call, which was made to Carter's home in Plains, Ga., and
lasted about four minutes.
Pakistani town bombed
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — On Friday Pakistan said 32

people were killed and 48 were injured when an Afghan
plane attacked the tiny bazaar town of Terri Mangal.
The attack took place at dusk on Thursday, an official
statement said.
This was the 11th attack on Terri Mangal, which is lo
cated just inside the Pakistani border, since Aug. 13. The
attacks are believed to be part of the Afghan armed
forces' efforts to pressure Pakistan and to keep rebels
from using the town as a base during the months-old siege
of a military outpost 15 miles away in eastern Afghanis
tan.
This last bombing was one of the most serious of the
more than 400 border violations that Pakistan claims to
have occurred since the Soviet military intervened in Af
ghanistan five years ago to back the Marxist government
in its fight to put down a Moslem rebellion.
South Korea gets aid
SEOUL, South Korea — A convoy of 725 North
Korean trucks rolled into South Korean territory Satur
day carrying the first supplies to pass between the two
countries since the Korean War ended 31 years ago.
The convoy brought tons of rice, medicine and cloth
that the North had volunteered as relief aid to victims of
recent floods in South Korea
It was the first time since before the Korean War broke
out in 1950 that goods moved freely across the demarca
tion line that separates the two intensely hostile Korean
states and represents a degree of cooperation unprece
dented in the bloody relationship between the two gov
ernments.
South Korean officials have called the North Korean
delivery nothing but a propaganda ploy, and they insisted

that they did not need the help. Nevertheless, the South
Korean Red Cross accepted the supplies in order to
reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
Victory for civil rights
WASHINGTON — Civil rights forces scored a major
victory Saturday as the Senate voted 92-4 to choke off
debate on legislation to override a Supreme Court ruling
that sharply narrowed the scope of federal anti
discrimination laws.
But conservatives continued to block passage of the
measure as part of a catchall spending bill to fund most
government agencies after the start of the new fiscal year
at 12:01 a.m. today.
Faced with prospects of a shutdown of these agencies if
the bill is not passed by today, the Senate unanimously ap
proved a two-day extension of the funding deadline.
If the House goes along, as it is expected to when it
returns at noon today, the Senate would have until mid
night tomorrow to complete action on the spending bill
and resolve differences with the House in a way that
would be acceptable to President Reagan.
The government also would not have to worry until
then about beginning an orderly shutdown of non
essential services, which it earlier had planned to invoke
by midday today unless Congress appeared likely to ap
prove a spending compromise satisfactory to Reagan.
But it was not clear Saturday when and how the Senate
might extract itself from its spectacular, ever-deepening
procedural snarl over the civil rights measure and various
conservative amendments on subjects including school
busing, gun controls and tuition tax credits, designed

partly to make life difficult for civil rights amendment
supporters.
Even if it gets past these hurdles, the Senate faces
scores of other proposed amendments to the spending bill
on subjects ranging from U.S. policy toward Central
America to local highway projects.

ued spending only by government agencies for which
