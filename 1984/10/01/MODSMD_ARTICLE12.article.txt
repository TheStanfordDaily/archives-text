Three times in the last 17 months, American
personnel in Beirut have been bombed by terror
ists. After the suicide bombing of the Marine
compound on Oct. 23, 1983, President Reagan
appropriately said. "If there is to be blame, it
properly rests here in this office and with this
President. . . . Corrective action is being urgently
taken to ensure the maximum possible security."
Eleven months later, another suicide bomber
penetrated our security and took the lives of 24
persons. This time, the president said the security
was inadequate because, "We're feeling the ef
fects today of the near destruction of our intelli
gence capability in recent years before we [took
office]."
Come on. Mr. President. Last year, the blame
rested with you, and you promised to improve the

security precautions. Now, one year later, you've
resorted to blaming former President Carter for
your failures. If it was your fault in 1983, why
isn't it your fault in 1984? What happened to the
"corrective action" that you promised last year?
And if it's pathetic to blame Carter for your
own mistakes, it's downright insulting to trivialize
the murder of our fellow citizens by comparing
the efforts (or lack of efforts) to protect the em
bassy with kitchen repairs that aren't finished as
quickly as we'd like. Carter just got his apology.
We're still waiting for ours.
Former President Truman had a sign on his
desk which read "The buck stops here." In the
case of Lebanon, perhaps Reagan should have
that sign amended to say, "The buck stops here in
non-election vears."
