# CIA complacency
## 
### 
After Reagan claimed last week that embassies
are threatened by the decline of intelligence ca
pability under previous administrations,
politicians from both parties rushed forward to
eschew responsibility for weakening the CIA and
to proclaim support for a strong spying appara
tus. The cast of characters included Democratic
presidential candidate Walter Mondale, former
President Carter and former CIA Directors
George Bush, Stansfield Turner and William
Colby. And the national media declared that a
new campaign issue was born.
But wait a minute. Isn't there something mis
sing here? We always thought that an "issue" in
volved differing views on-future policy. But the
unstated premise of all of the aforementioned
politicians was support for strengthening U.S. in
telligence capability.
If this is the political consensus now, it surely
wasn't so eight years ago. Remember the Rocke
feller Commission? Remember accusations of

CIA involvement in domestic spying, illegal
wiretaps and assassinations of foreign leaders?
Remember congressional efforts to restrict covert
operations and intelligence gathering? And fi
nally, remember Senator Walter Mondale, one of
the most zealous and outspoken members of the
Senate Select Intelligence Committee, which set
out to slay the dragon of CIA power?
We're not going to say which is worse: Reagan
trying to shirk the blame for the bombing, or
Mondale posturing as a champion of the CIA.
What really perplexes us is the abandonment by
both sides of any real debate about the future of
America's spying apparatus. Could it be that the
denunciations and hand-wringing of yesteryear
were simply responses to fleeting political winds?
We hope not. Because underlying the intelligence
issue are two cornerstones of American
democracy: national security and civil liberties.
And they are just too important to be used as a
political football.
