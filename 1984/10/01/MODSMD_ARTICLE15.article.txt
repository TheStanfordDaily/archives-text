## The 						new isolationism 
### 
During a program for international
students in East Germany this sum
mer, 1 encountered almost universal
criticism of the United States and
President Reagan from students of
many ideological bents and geogra
phic origins. They spoke of American
insensitivity, ignorance, wastefulness,
arrogance â€” the list seemed unend
ing. It was a humbling experience to
say the least, since it was difficult to
say with pride that I was American.

VIEWPOINT

To some extent, their criticisms were
justified. These students knew much
more about what lies beyond their
borders than most of us Americans
know about what lies beyond ours. It
was even difficult to feel proud of
American freedoms, since I realized
that I had not personally earned them
anymore than East Germans have
deserved the restrictions placed on
them. Above all, students from West
ern Europe conveyed a genuine fear
of our missile deployments in their
countries. Regardless of American
justifications for the deployments, the
fear is real and is a sign that
Europeans are often far more con
cerned than are we about our actions
abroad. In fact, as was true of one
American in the program, many
Americans are not even sure what
these Pershing 2s are.
The reaction of many Americans in
this program to the criticism was to
become defensive, proud and less cri
tical of the United States than before
they came. I returned home dismayed
to find a simi'ar mood in the air, a
new patriotism which seems to sug
gest that Americans feel they are on

top of the world and loving it. that it
the inflation rate is down, American
Olympic victories are up and Reagan
is still optimistic, then all is right with
us now and the world must he quite
impressed. There was the flag-waving
national euphoria of the Olympics,
televised images of unabashed Amer
ican pride zooming round the world.
There was the Republican National
Convention where Reagan stated
proudly that America has regained
the respect of the world since the days
of malaise. Either Reagan has been
listening to different voices in the
world than I have heard, or he hasn t
been listening. His statement reflects
not world opinion, but rather that he
is tapping this new patriotism which
thrives on the fact that it is easier and
rosier to withdraw into our own little
world than to bravely recognize the
rest of the world and our responsibil
ity to it. A few years back, it seemed
we had a growing sense of the world's
interdependence. Somehow, we've
lost not only that sense but also a
sense of social responsibility at home.
It is back in style to assert raw Ameri
can individualism and to view our na
tion. in the world community as an in
dividual with responsibilities only to
itself.
However, this new mood is not true
patriotism, it is self-satisfaction It is a
patriotism which blinds, not that
which in the past has given great men
and women vision. Genuine patrio
tism fights against complacency. It is
born of struggle, of a sober, often
revolutionary, attitude toward the
state of things. At least this is what
the early American patriots believed.
True patriotism is not a means of
denying responsibility or of winning

elections. The Democratic and Re
publican Conventions demonstrated
a shameful trivialization of our most
sacred symbol, the flag, in pursuit of
votes. In President Reagan's cam
paign film at the Republican Conven
tion.the American flag became a tool
of Madison Avenue used to manipu
late voters through images rather
than substance, so that, in one image,
a row of flags, like wallpaper behind a
smiling Reagan, were undifferenti
ated in essence from the flags in an
other scene draped over the coffins of
Marines killed in Lebanon. By con
senting to this debasement, we have
turned our highest American ideals
embodied in the flag into just another
commercial.
It our national consciousness finds
expression on the level of a feel-good
cola commercial, then we are in dan
ger of the patriotism that blinds. As
long as America divides the world
along morally simplistic lines without
understanding its complexity, diver
sity and needs, we as a nation will
grow complacent and insensitive to
our responsibilities, ignoring simple
realities such as the world's 40,000
children under five who die each day
of malnutrition and preventable
disease. And if we continue to dis
credit or disregard the genuine fear
that exists in the world, fear whose
seeds we have often planted, then we
may discover one day that we have
helped create a more unstable and
dangerous world. Even if we can only
think in terms of self-interest, waking
up to the world rather than indulging
in self-adulation would spare us some
dark days ahead.
