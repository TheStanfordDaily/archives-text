Recurring deficits
Loren Borud's defense of
Reaganomics (The Daily, Sept. 27)
has resurrected the Laffer Curve,
hypothesizing that reduced tax rates
result in increased government reve
nues. If there had been any truth to
it, Ronald Reagan would not have
needed to borrow more money than
two centuries of previous administra
tions combined. This "theory" has
been rejected by everyone with a
grain of common sense.
Keynes' theory, which Borud
attacks, states that the government
can reduce the volatility of the busi
ness cycle by running deficits during
recessions and surpluses during
periods of prosperity. The current
recovery is proof that large govern
ment deficits can be a powerful

temporary stimulus to the economy.
In this respect Reagan is the ultimate
Keynesian. Unfortunately, by con
tinuing to run unprecedented deficits
during a strong recovery, he is ex
acerbating the cyclic behavior of the
economy. The current 7 to 8 percent
unemployment rate is high by any
standard, but under Reaganomics it
represents a cyclic low.
In the '60s, President Johnson
created deficits significantly smaller
than Reagan's by increasing defense
spending and flexing America's
military muscles around the world
while simultaneously giving away
billions to America's poor. In the
same way, Reagan is increasing
defense spending, flexing our mili
tary muscles in a dangerous way
throughout the world and giving
away billions to America's wealthy,
while passing the cost onto the

future. After Johnson was gone his
legacy remained. Combined with the
energy shocks from an unstable
Middle East, the deficits of the '60s
resulted in the stagflation of the '70s.
Rather than rescue us from this
problem Reagan has set us up for a
re-occurrence after he has gone.
Instead of the hedonism of
Reaganomics, Walter Mondale has
courageously presented a plan to
deal with these problems. The con
trast between Reagan and Mondale
is as clear in economics as it is in
education, the environment and arms
control. Reagan ignores the future.
I hose of us who intend to live in the
future must support Walter
Mondale.
