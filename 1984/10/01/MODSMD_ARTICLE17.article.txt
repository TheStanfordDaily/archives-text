## Keynesian economics gone mad 
### 
A recent column in The Daily ("Reaganomics:
Let's Give It Four More Years," Loren Borud) set
out the basic right-wing economic theology. In this
view, the nation is divided into two camps: the
benighted, discredited "demand-siders," and the
visionary "supply-siders," who have triumphed

VIEWPOINT

over doubters and winners to lead this country into
a new era of permanent prosperity.
Recession and inflation, according to the faithful,
are spawned by the demand-siders' insistence on
government spending and taxes. The cure for these,
as Reagan is supposed to have demonstrated, is tax
and spending cuts aimed at the supply side.
The idea is that, if taxes are cut, people will have
more incentive to work and production will in
crease. Similarly, if welfare benefits are cut, un
employment becomes less "appealing," so people
will.go back to work.
Irl theory, this sounds plausible. What is often
overlooked is that an equally plausible theory exists
to prove that tax cuts will actually decrease produc
tion. If one assumes that people have a certain
standard of liv ing which they consider acceptable, it
follows that they will work just hard enough to
reach that level. (This is known as "satisficing," as
opposed to "maximizing.")
It seems at least equally probable that people will
act in this way. rather than making the complex cal
culations the maximizing theory assumes. If people
are satisficers rather than maximizers, then tax cuts
would decrease incentive to work, as pjople could
earn less and maintain the same standard of living.
The whole debate is rather scholastic, however,
as there is no evidence that supply-side economics
have any effect on the real world. The Reagan
recovery, in fact, is a classic example of Keynesian,

demand-side economics— or rather, Keynesianism
gone mad.
Reagan cut taxes, causing government revenues
to fall. Reagan failed to cut spending; the federal
budget actually increased, due to the inflated
defense budget ($lOO billion more in 1984 than in
1 9KO). The combination of decreased revenues and
increased spending resulted in the largest deficits in
world history. Pumping this kind of money into the
economy, combined with the natural upswing that
follows a recession, creates a recovery. This is basic
Kevnes.

Reagan, with his tax
cuts, has made the deficit
structural. People who
think there is $200 bil
lion worth of'fat' to be
trimmed from the federal
budget are putting them
selves on.

And, in fact, the recovery was a typical demand
led recovery. Capital spending, which according to
supplv-side is supposed to drive the recovery, did
not pick up until after consumer spending created a
demand. Again, this is exactly the way Keynes said
it was supposed to work.
Where Reagan deviates from Keynes is in the
fact that Reagan has no idea how he is going to pay

for his deficits. According to Keynes, the govern
ment is supposed to run a deficit in bad times, a
surplus in gocxi times, thereby evening out the eco
nomic cycle.
Reagan, with his tax cuts, has made the deficit
structural. People who think there is $200 billion
worth of "fat" to be trimmed from the federal
budget are putting themselves on. Unless we raise
taxes, the deficits will continue to pile up. Already
under Reagan's term, the cost of interest on the na
tional debt has doubled, to over $100 billion.
That's about 12 percent of the total federal budget.
Reagan built an election-year recovery on the
backs of future generations. While calling the
Democrats' the party of promises," Reagan tells us
that he has ended the 150-year-old business cycle.
This is what George Bush referred to as "voodoo
economics."
Not that Reaganomics has accomplished nothing
— David Stockman's "Trojan Horse" has
redistributed wealth to the rich. Their income has
risen about 9 percent, while that of the the poor has
fallen a similar amount.
Despite Reagan's paternalistic smile, the eco
nomy is in a frightening condition. Unemployment
"stabilized" at between 7 and 8 percent is not a
pretty sight; the implication that there is something
"appealing" about unemployment is in the same
category as Ed Meese's claim that there is no
hunger in America.
The leading indicators are headed down. Our
trade deficit is the largest ever. The banking system
tilts precariously at the prospect of third world
default. Some economists are predicting a recession
as early as next spring, and all but the starry-eyed
see that a recession is inevitable in the near future.
When the house of cards falls, it will fall hard.
