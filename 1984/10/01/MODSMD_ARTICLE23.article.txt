## Stanford knuckles under to ASU 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford lost a football game Sat
urday to Arizona State. 28-10
But the biggest loss for Stanford
didn't come until about an hour after
the game, when X-rays revealed
sophomore quarterback John Paye
had fractured the lower knuckle of his
light index finger. Paye is not left
handed.
Paye's finger was operated on yes
terday morning and he will miss at
least three games and probably a
fourth. A splint is on his finger, and
two pins are in his knuckle.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway, not
one to mince words, was stunned and
shocked upon receiving news of his
starting quarterback's injury. "I am
sick to death," he said.

Elway's comments might have
sounded like a funeral oration, but
losing Paye indeed might spell doom
for Stanford's season, especially with
games against conference
heavyweights UCLA and Washing
ton in the next two weeks. Paye's
backup, senior Fred Buckley, has
played a total of five downs in his col
lege career. He played four of them
Saturday and threw two passes — one
was incomplete, the other was inter
cepted.
Even before Paye injured his finger
in the fourth quarter. Stanford, now
2-2 overall and 0-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference, had trouble moving the
ball against Arizona State's defense.
The Sun Devils, 2-2 and 1-1 in the
Pac-10, held the Cardinal to 164
vards in total offense, Stanford's

worst offensive showing in a very long
time.
Paye completed 14 of 26 passes for
103 yards, and the Cardinal's rushing
attack accounted for 61 yards on 34
carries. Pretty grim numbers for a
team averaging 376.3 yards per game
in total offense.
"We ran into an outstanding, out
standing defense that was flexible and
fast," Elway said. "Against such a de
fensive team as Arizona State, you al
ways feel there's a way. But their
team speed makes it particularly
tough to move on them. Good teams,
like theirs, can have a drastic effect
on the execution of an offense. They
are a first-class defense."
While the same can't be said for
Arizona State's offense, which scored
a total of six points in its first and
third games this season, tailback Dar
ryl Clack might be in a class by him
self. The 5-foot-10, 196-pound Clack
playing his first full game this
season — rushed and caught passes
for 237 of Arizona State's 367 total
yards and scored two of the Sun
Devils' four touchdowns.
Although Saturday's score was
Stanford's largest margin of defeat
this season, Arizona State did not
wear down the Cardinal as Oklahoma
did in Stanford's season-opening 19-
7 loss. In fact, had it not been for a
few big plays, the game might have
been much closer.
"It's really frustrating when you
kick somebody's butt all day and then
get a few game-breakers and you
lose," linebacker Dave Wyman said.
"We had a good scouting report on
them. Our package broke down a
couple of times, that's all."
Make that three times. The Car
dinal defensive package broke down
with 14:26 left in the first half when
wide receiver Tom Ornofrio, a quar
terback in high school, took a reverse
handoff from Clack and threw a 29-
yard touchdown pass to Doug Allen.
The package also broke down twice
in the third quarter, and both times
Clack capitalized with a touchdown
— a 65-yard screen pass and an 85-
yard run.
Clack's first touchdown came with
10:55 left in the third quarter and in
creased a 7-3 Arizona State halftime
lead to 14-3. "It was just a screen
pass," Clack said. "1 had a few key
blocks and took it from there."
Clack caught that screen pass from
freshman quarterback John Walker
on the left sideline and put on a fake
that left Cardinal cornerback Eric

Price tackling air. Clack cut back
across the field and outran Stanford's
defense to the end zone.
Minutes later, Clack again was
showing his heels to the Cardinal
defenders. This time, Clack turned a
sweep to the left side into an 85-yard
run down the sideline. Arizona State
21, Stanford 3.
Asked if he prides himself on his
speed in the open field, Clack replied,
"That's kind of a goal I have for
myself. Once I get into the secondary,
I don't want to get caught from be
hind."
Stanford had a chance to come
back in the fourth quarter after a one
yard quarterback sneak by Paye cut
Arizona State's lead to 21-10 with
14:08 to play. But it was on that
touchdown drive that Paye injured

his finger. For the rest of the game,
neither he nor Buckley were effec
tive.
The Sun Devils put things away for
good with 6:20 remaining. Three
plays after recovering a fumble by
Kaulana Park on the Stanford 19,
Walker duplicated Paye's feat and
snuck over the top of the pile for a
touchdown. Place-kicker Luis Zen
dejas, who Saturday passed Herschel
Walker and moved into eighth place
on the NCAA career scoring list,
made the extra point and the score
was 28-10.
"We're extremely pleased because
we've had a great difficulty sorting
our season out," Arizona State Coach
Darryl Rogers said. "We thought our
defense kept us in the football game.

as they have in the last three games."
Special teams play also kept
Arizona State in the game. Sun Devil
punter Jim Meyer averaged 46.5
yards per kick, prompting Rogers to
say, "I think our kicking game, with
Jimmy Meyers, was outstanding. He
kept Stanford in the hole all day and
any time you do that, it's to your ad
vantage." ,
Meanwhile, Cardinal freshman
punters Doug Robison and David
Sweeney were mired in mediocrity.
The pair punted eight times and
averaged 40 yards p<jr kick. However,
take away Robison's 70-yard punt in
the third quarter — one of the longest
in Stanford history — and they had a
combined 35.7-yard average. That
includes Robison's punts of 26 and 2K
yards.

Sun Devils ahead of Stanford, 21-3, in the third quarter Saturday. Clack's rushing and receiving output of
237 yards was 73 yards more than Stanford's total offense. Clack, a senior, also scored on a 65-yard pass

them. Our package broke down a
couple of times, that's all."
Make that three times. The Car
dinal defensive package broke down
with 14:26 left in the first half when
wide receiver Tom Ornofrio, a quar
terback in high school, took a reverse
handoff from Clack and threw a 29-
yard touchdown pass to Doug Allen.
The package also broke down twice
in the third quarter, and both times
Clack capitalized with a touchdown
— a 65-yard screen pass and an 85-
yard run.
Clack's first touchdown came with
10:55 left in the third quarter and in
creased a 7-3 Arizona State halftime
lead to 14-3. "It was just a screen
pass," Clack said. "1 had a few key
blocks and took it from there."
Clack caught that screen pass from
freshman quarterback John Walker
on the left sideline and put on a fake
that left Cardinal cornerback Eric

Price tackling air. Clack cut back
across the field and outran Stanford's
defense to the end zone.
Minutes later, Clack again was
showing his heels to the Cardinal
defenders. This time, Clack turned a
sweep to the left side into an 85-yard
run down the sideline. Arizona State
21, Stanford 3.
Asked if he prides himself on his
speed in the open field, Clack replied,
"That's kind of a goal I have for
myself. Once I get into the secondary,
I don't want to get caught from be
hind."
Stanford had a chance to come
back in the fourth quarter after a one
yard quarterback sneak by Paye cut
Arizona State's lead to 21-10 with
14:08 to play. But it was on that
touchdown drive that Paye injured

his finger. For the rest of the game,
neither he nor Buckley were effec
tive.
The Sun Devils put things away for
good with 6:20 remaining. Three
plays after recovering a fumble by
Kaulana Park on the Stanford 19,
Walker duplicated Paye's feat and
snuck over the top of the pile for a
touchdown. Place-kicker Luis Zen
dejas, who Saturday passed Herschel
Walker and moved into eighth place
on the NCAA career scoring list,
made the extra point and the score
was 28-10.
"We're extremely pleased because
we've had a great difficulty sorting
our season out," Arizona State Coach
Darryl Rogers said. "We thought our
defense kept us in the football game.

as they have in the last three games."
Special teams play also kept
Arizona State in the game. Sun Devil
punter Jim Meyer averaged 46.5
yards per kick, prompting Rogers to
say, "I think our kicking game, with
Jimmy Meyers, was outstanding. He
kept Stanford in the hole all day and
any time you do that, it's to your ad
vantage." ,
Meanwhile, Cardinal freshman
punters Doug Robison and David
Sweeney were mired in mediocrity.
The pair punted eight times and
averaged 40 yards p<jr kick. However,
take away Robison's 70-yard punt in
the third quarter — one of the longest
in Stanford history — and they had a
combined 35.7-yard average. That
includes Robison's punts of 26 and 2K
yards.

Arizona State's Darryl Clack runs around the left end at the start of his 84-y.ird touchdown run that put the
Sun Devils ahead of Stanford, 21-3, in the third quarter Saturday. Clack's rushing and receiving output of
237 yards was 73 yards more than Stanford's total offense. Clack, a senior, also scored on a 65-yard pass
play in the third quarter.
Stanford lost a football game Sat
urday to Arizona State. 28-10
But the biggest loss for Stanford
didn't come until about an hour after
the game, when X-rays revealed
sophomore quarterback John Paye
had fractured the lower knuckle of his
light index finger. Paye is not left
handed.
Paye's finger was operated on yes
terday morning and he will miss at
least three games and probably a
fourth. A splint is on his finger, and
two pins are in his knuckle.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway, not
one to mince words, was stunned and
shocked upon receiving news of his
starting quarterback's injury. "I am
sick to death," he said.

Elway's comments might have
sounded like a funeral oration, but
losing Paye indeed might spell doom
for Stanford's season, especially with
games against conference
heavyweights UCLA and Washing
ton in the next two weeks. Paye's
backup, senior Fred Buckley, has
played a total of five downs in his col
lege career. He played four of them
Saturday and threw two passes — one
was incomplete, the other was inter
cepted.
Even before Paye injured his finger
in the fourth quarter. Stanford, now
2-2 overall and 0-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference, had trouble moving the
ball against Arizona State's defense.
The Sun Devils, 2-2 and 1-1 in the
Pac-10, held the Cardinal to 164
vards in total offense, Stanford's

worst offensive showing in a very long
time.
Paye completed 14 of 26 passes for
103 yards, and the Cardinal's rushing
attack accounted for 61 yards on 34
carries. Pretty grim numbers for a
team averaging 376.3 yards per game
in total offense.
"We ran into an outstanding, out
standing defense that was flexible and
fast," Elway said. "Against such a de
fensive team as Arizona State, you al
ways feel there's a way. But their
team speed makes it particularly
tough to move on them. Good teams,
like theirs, can have a drastic effect
on the execution of an offense. They
are a first-class defense."
While the same can't be said for
Arizona State's offense, which scored
a total of six points in its first and
third games this season, tailback Dar
ryl Clack might be in a class by him
self. The 5-foot-10, 196-pound Clack
playing his first full game this
season — rushed and caught passes
for 237 of Arizona State's 367 total
yards and scored two of the Sun
Devils' four touchdowns.
Although Saturday's score was
Stanford's largest margin of defeat
this season, Arizona State did not
wear down the Cardinal as Oklahoma
did in Stanford's season-opening 19-
7 loss. In fact, had it not been for a
few big plays, the game might have
been much closer.
"It's really frustrating when you
kick somebody's butt all day and then
get a few game-breakers and you
lose," linebacker Dave Wyman said.
