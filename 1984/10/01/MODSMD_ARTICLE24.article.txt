## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Sophomore quarterback John
Paye began Sunday a little differ
ently than usual. He started it on
an operating table at the Stanford
Medical Center.
At 8 a.m., team physician Dr.
Don Bunce spent an hour putting
two small pins the size of thick
sewing needles into the lower
knuckle of Paye's index finger,
repairing the bone Paye had bro
ken in Saturday's 28-10 loss to
Arizona State
Bunce said the operation was a
success, but Paye will be sidelined
for at least three games and prob
ably a fourth. Paye's finger, pres
ently in a splint, will be re
examined this Friday and the pins
will be removed in two-and-one
half weeks. X-rays will be taken in
three weeks to determine Paye's
status for the remainder of the
season.
Paye, who was unavailable for
comment, injured his finger on the
first play of the fourth quarter Sat
urday when he hit it against the
helmet of Arizona State
noseguard Tom Gerber. Paye
stayed in the game and three plays
later scored a touchdown on a
quarterback sneak. But after
throwing two incomplete passes in
Stanford's next series, Paye came

out for good.
"The main thing right now,"
said a stunned Coach Jack El way,
"is that I feel bad for John Paye.
He was having a great year. It was
just a bad stroke of luck."
In four games this season, Paye
completed 71 -of-131 passes (54.1
percent) for 786 yards and three
touchdowns. As a freshman. Paye
was 150-of-297 for 1971 yards
and 10 touchdowns.
"I don't know yet what this
means to the Stanford offense,"
Elway said. "John is a great young
man, but these things happen.
Fred Buckley will be our quarter
back. He's had a lot of turns (in
practice) and has been throwning
well, but doesn't have a lot ot
game experience."
Buckley, a senior with two years
of elgibility remaining, has played
only five downs in his Stanford
career. Against Arizona State Sat
urday. he threw two passes, one of
which was intercepted.
Stanford plays UCLA, Wash
ington and Washington State in
the next three weeks, all games
Paye will miss. The first game
Paye could be ready for is Oct. 27
at Oregon State, Co-Sports In
formation Director Steve Rac
zynski said it's unlikely Paye will
play before Nov. 3, when Stanford
hosts USC.
