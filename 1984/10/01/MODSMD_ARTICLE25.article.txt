# Brown to miss season
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The gods of college athletics
weren't smiling on-Stanford this
weekend. The news of quarterback
John Paye breaking the lower
knuckle of his index finger came days
after word of a similar tragedy echoed
off the walls of basketball Coach Tom
Davis office.
Davis learned late last week that
senior team captain Steve Brown, the
Cardinal's leading returning scorer,
has a stress fracture in his right leg
and will miss the 1984-85 season.
The 6-foot-2 Brown, a starting for
ward for Stanford last year, will un
dergo a four- to six-month rehabilita
tion program and try to return as a
fifth-year senior next season, Davis
said. Brown was Stanford's third
leading scorer last season with a 10.9
points-per-game average. He shot
54.1 percent from the floor, 78.9 per
cent from the free-throw line and was
third on the team in assists with 45.
"Anytime you lose a player of
Steve Brown's caliber, it will hurt the
team." Davis said. "Coupled with the
fact that we've already lost last year's
top two scorers, this only adds to the
impact."
Davis was referring to center John
Revelli and guard Keith Jones, two of
the four most prolific career scorers
in Stanford men's basketball history.
Jones averaged 20 and Revelli 16.2
points per game on a 19-12 Cardinal
team that had its first winning season
in 1 1 years and narrowly missed its
first postseason tournament bid in 42
years.
Besides Jones and Revelli, forward
Hans Wichary has decided to forego
his final year of eligibility, making
Brown the fourth starter to be lost
from last year's team.
Brown's injury is located in a
weight-bearing bone of his right leg in
the shin area. Brown said he first
noticed pain in his leg at the end of
last season.
"1 had a bone scan done in July,
but those tests revealed nothing,"
Brown said. "The first time 1 started
to get worried was the middle of this
past month after 1 started to go full
speed. I found I just couldn't run and
jump without a lot of pain.
"My reaction to all this is disbelief.
I guess it really hasn't hit home yet
and probably won't until the team
starts practicing Oct. 15. This will be
the first time in 12 or 13 years that I
haven't played. It sure will feel differ
ent."
Davis is now faced with the
prospect of not having Brown, a
player he said had the potential to
lead the Pacific 10 Conference in
scoring this season.
"When I learned of this," Davis
said, "my first thought was how hard
I knew that Steve Brown was working

for this upcoming season — and how
much disappointment this must be for
him. A lot of leadership and scoring
responsibilities were going to be
placed on his shoulders.

"But Steve is a remarkable guy. He
knows how much it will take to
rehabilitate himself. We'll certainly
give him a chance to come back
health-wise for a fifth year."
