# Arizona State's Fulcher 'always in the traffic'
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
At halftime of Saturday's
Stanford-Arizona State football
game, the Sun Devils were in
formed that both their starting
inside linebackers — Greg Battle
and Jimmy Williams — would miss
the rest of the game with injuries.
Arizona State was ahead, 7-3, at
the time.
"When Jim and Greg went
down," Sun Devil safety David Ful
cher said, "they came over to me
and said, 'David, you've got to take
over.' " Fulcher did, and Arizona
State won, 28-10.
"I'm not a linebacker," Fulcher
said, "but I'm always in the traffic."
At 6-foot-3, 215 pounds, Fulcher
often is the traffic. As Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said after the
game, "That guy looks a lot bigger
in life than he does on film."
Maybe that's because Elway
noticed Fulcher more Saturday.
Noticed him pressuring quarter
back John Paye. Noticed him
causing fullback Brad Muster to
fumble with a jarring tackle.
Noticed him knocking away and al
most intercepting a sure completion
to tight end Greg Baty. Noticed
him making 11 tackles and wildly
dancing around after each one.
"He's a great football player,"
Sun Devil Coach Darryl Rogers
said of his sophomore safety. "And
we count on him."
Fulcher, however, wasn't just
playing football Saturday after
noon. He also was having fun
making life miserable for Stanford's
offense.
"I'm having fun every time I step
hut on the field," he said. "I try to
get the bench and the fans going. I
just try to have a good time out
there and I want everyone else to
have as good a time as I'm having."
Fulcher is a type of person who
has an endless reservoir of energy.
Unlike most of his exhausted
teammates, Fulcher enthusiastically
talked with reporters after the
gaijie as if he hadn't played a down.
Pack that energy into Fulcher's
frame, put it in football pads, and
it's a scary thought. Rogers calls
him "a force to be reckoned with"
in the ASU press guide and, follow
ing Saturday's game, said he was "a
one-man wrecking crew."
"We saw a lot of films (of Stan
ford) last week," Fulcher said. "We
saw that a lot of teams don't put a
lot of pressure on him (Paye). We
wanted to keep the pressure on

him, keep him in the pocket and
keep him confused."
Fulcher and the Sun Devil
defense did all of those things Sat
urday. Stanford finished with 164
yards in total offense, 10 points and
a loss in its Pacific 10 Conference
opener.
Fulcher, whose nickname is
"Hard Rock," isn't a new-found
talent this season. Last season, he
was named All-Pac-10 and second
team All-America. He had 110
tackles and a team-high four inter
ceptions. He was also a freshman.
"This season, I wanted to lead
the nation or conference in inter
ceptions," said Fulcher, who has
none. "Maybe if I hadn't said any
thing, it might have come true. It
just seems that me and the ball
haven't got along too well this
year."
It also seems that opposing
coaches haven't been throwing in
Fulcher's area, or anywhere near
him for that matter. Take Saturday,
for example, when Fulcher covered
Cardinal tailback Thomas Henley.
For the first time this season, Hen
ley — who caught 10 passes against
Illinois — was shut out.
"All during the week, he
[Rogers] was thinking of putting a
corner [back] on number 20
[Henley], " Fulcher said. "But then
he came up to me and asked me if I
could handle it. I said, 'The only

way you'll find out is to give me a
shot.' I know he's a big play man
tor the Stanford team. But he didn't
catch any passes and if he doesn't
catch any passes, then I feel I've
done a good job."
Fulcher wasn't the only Sun
Devil defensive back — and they
used five Saturday — that was
covering Cardinal receivers like
glue. Freshman cornerbacks Jeff
Joseph and Anthony Parker held
Stanford's F.mile Harry to four
catches and shut out Jeff James.
We made the quarterback hold
the ball a lot longer than he wanted
to, Joseph said of the Arizona
State secondary.
Not only did Paye rarely have a
receiver open, he had no time to
find one. Ihe Arizona State pass
rush, made even fiercer with its
blitz, kept the pressure on Paye,
sacking him five times.
I ulcher didn't have any sacks
Saturday, but had more than his
share (three) in last year's 29-11
victory over Stanford. It was in that
game I"ulcher began his celebration
dance, similar to that of Mark Gas
tineau of the New York Jets.
It started last year against Stan
lord, he said. "It fires me up. I like
to get up and dance around. When I
hit that guy on the screen pass, I
just had to let loose and do my
dance."
