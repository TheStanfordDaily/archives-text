### INGRID SEYER 
When David Imbernino scored the winning goal in
sudden-death overtime, he clinched what Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti called a very important 7-6 victory
over sixth-ranked Iresno State Saturday in the Northern
California Water Polo Tournament at DeGuerre Pool.
Dettamanti was extremely pleased with his team's
tournament victories, but Imbernino's goal was the most
important play of this past weekend.
David s goal may have been the single most important
goal of the season so far for us," Dettamanti said. "Fresno
State is presently ranked sixth and we are ranked fifth. If
we want to move up in the polls, we have to beat the
teams below us as well as the teams above us."
Because Stanford and Fresno State split the first two
games of their series earlier this season, Saturday's match
was crucial to the Cardinal's overall standings.
"Although it is still very early in the season, the fact
that we won the series against Fresno State will certainly
affect the way coaches vote on the standings later in the
year," Dettamanti said.
Stanford played four games Friday and Saturday, and
won each time. Pepperdine University was the only other
team in the tournament that was undefeated. On Friday,
the Cardinal defeated the Air Force Academy, 13-4, in its
first match of the tournament. Stanford defeated the Uni
versity of California at San Diego, 13-2, later that day.
In the match against Air Force, Stanford jumped out to

a 6-0 lead in the first half. Freshman Matt Tingler was the
game's leading scorer with four goals, Imbernino had
three goals and Eric Fisher had two.
Tingler was also the leading scorer for the Cardinal in
the match against San Diego, scoring three goals as Stan
ford opened up a 7-2 lead in the first half.
"Matt played two very good games and I was very
pleased with his play," Dettamanti said."He is a very
good offensive player and eventually he will be a very
strong force on our team."
Following its victory over San Jose State on Saturday,
the Cardinal defeated the University of California at
Santa Barbara, 12-3. Velez and Grant Stanley each had
three goals for Stanford, and Craig Klass and Fisher had
two goals each.
Dettamanti said he felt his team performed at its best
throughout the tournament.
"We played excellent water polo, and I was very
pleased with how well my players held up, especially in
the sudden-death overtime of the San Jose game," Det
tamanti said. "I feel we will be strong contenders for the
NCAA championships this year if we can keep up a high
level of play as we did in this tournament."
Stanford's "B" team also was undefeated in the Nor Cal
Tournament and was the absolute winner in its category,
according to Asst. Coach John Tanner. During the tourn
ament, John Woodberry and Bob Abbott were the
leading scorers for the "B" team.
