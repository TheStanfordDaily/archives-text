# Soccer team wins

### DARREN THORNEYCROFT 
The Stanford men's soccer team
beat visiting University of San Diego,
2-0, Saturday before a sparse crowd
after a two-hour delay.
The San Diego team arrived in
Palo Alto at 11 a.m., believing the
game started at 1 p.m. By that time,
most spectators had gone to Stanford
Stadium to watch the Cardinal foot
ball team play Arizona State.
The delay seemed to affect both
teams, and the match was not an art
ful display of soccer, according to
Stanford Coach Sam Koch.
" 'Sloppy' would be a good term to
use," Koch said. "We put pressure on
ourselves rather than having them put
pressure on us. We made it harder on
ourselves than they did."
Stanford's first goal came after 20
minutes in the first half when sopho
more midfielder Patrick Sheehy
scored an unassisted goal after a
scramble in front of the San Diego
net. It was Sheehy's first goal of this
season.
After controlling much of the play
in the first half, the Cardinal scored
again with about five minutes left in
the half. Junior forward-midfielder
Dave Daniels beat San Diego
goalkeeper Scott Huckleberry from
close range after a crossing pass from
Jim Cole, a junior forward.
"Jim crossed the ball, I took a step,
waited for the goalie to commit, and
put it in," Daniels said. It was the first
goal of Daniels' Stanford career.
Cardinal goalkeeper Willy
Burkhardt made four saves in record

ing his second shutout of the season
â€” but not without some help.
Junior fullback Phillip Horvath
made a clearance off the goal line
midway through the second half to
help preserve the shutout.
Despite the win, Koch was not
pleased and cited a few areas in need
of improvement. "We need to work
on off-the-ball movement," Koch
said. "We need to work on our man
to-man marking on defense, and we
need to stay cool under fire." Koch
said he felt the Cardinal allowed San
Diego to apply unnecessary pressure.
Sheehy was encouraged by the vic
tory, however, and praised the influ
ence of Koch, a first-time head coach,
in his first year at Stanford.
"We're pulling together as a
team," Sheehy said, and termed
Koch's coaching as "definitely" a fac
tor. "After [former Coach Nelson]
Lodge, he's an improvement. And in
his own right, he's a good coach."
Horvath said he thinks the Car
dinal has a good chance at first place
in the Pacific Soccer Conference.
"It's building," Horvath said of
Stanford's play, "and we definitely
have a chance at first place. USF [the
University of San Francisco] and
Berkeley are the strong ones right
now, but USF is not as strong as they
have been in the past. It's an inconsis
tent league, and anyone has a
chance."
The Cardinal plays Fresno State
Wednesday night at 7:30 in Fresno.
Stanford's next home game is Oct. 10
against St. Mary's at 3 p.m.
