The Stanford men's golf team
travels to two non-conference tour
naments this week to showcase a
squad that could put up a fight for the
Pacific 10 Conference title. The
linksters are looking to sustain mo
mentum after last week's second
place finish in the Northwestern Fall
Classic.
Because of time overlaps, fourth
year Coach Tim Schaaf will have to
split his team between the 54-hole
Wolfpack Invitational at Lake Tahoe
Monday and Tuesday, and the
Louisiana State Invitational Wednes
day through Friday in Baton Rouge,
La.
Schaaf wouldn't attach any ex
traordinary significance to either
tournament, but he indicated the
Cardinal would emphasize the LSU
event because it features a competi
tive national field. Stanford's top five
players will compete in Baton Rouge.
Schaaf said the Wolfpack Invita
tional would attract West Coast com
petition and the LSU event figures to
present a tougher challenge. National
powers Brig'ham Young University
and Oklahoma State will be on hand.
Schaaf welcomes the opportunity

to give piaying time to everyone on
the team." Besides gaining valuable
match experience, the group could
use strong performances this week to
prepare for the upcoming Stanford
Fall All-Intercollegiate Tournament,
Oct. 19 and 20.
The Stanford Tournament will
have what Schaaf calls "one of the
best two fields in the fall season" and
could provide a preview if not a
"litmus test" of the Cardinal's poten
tial. Schaaf hopes his team will peak
for that tournament because it will in
clude the "people against whom we
must qualify."
With nine of ten players returning
from a team that finished second in
Pac-10 play last year, Schaaf and his
squad are understandably optimistic
about the spring season. Schaaf said
"there is not a man on the team that
believes we will not qualify for na
tionals and make the cut."
Led by seniors Lew Dickey. Scott
Erickson, Tim Robinson, and Doug
Robinson, last week's low scorer, the
Cardinal hopes to create a winning
attitude and stronger image, accor
ding to Schaaf. In particular, Sch:>at
said that his team was "raring to go"
after his players had "great sum
mers."
