### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Last year the future of fraternities at the Uni
versity became clouded when a special task force
created to study fraternities and sororities recom
mended that "studert housing may not be denied
based on the subjective judgments of current or
former residents."
That somewhat vague statement, should it be
approved by the University, would effectively
abolish fraternity life at Stanford as we know it
today.
Both pro-fraternity and anti-fraternity spokes
men have used the examples of other schools in
their arguments. Proponents of Stanford's cur
rent system say it is mild compared to other
schools where fraternities are more prevalent,
and opponents of the Greek system point to still
other schools, where no fraternities exist at all.
With this article, The Daily takes an in-depth
look at Greek life at a number of universities, in
cluding large state schools such as the University
of California at Los Angeles and the University
of Missouri, and private schools such as the Uni
versity of Southern California, where fraternities
control much of campus life, and Amherst Col
lege, where fraternities were kicked off campus
last year.
UCLA
At UCLA, a state school with an undergradu
ate population of approximately 22,000, 15 to 20
percent of the students are members of a frater
nities or or sororities. There are presently 30 fra
ternities at UCLA, 22 of which have housing.
Fraternities have been a part of UCLA since it

moved to it>, Westwood location in 1929.
Five new fraternities received formal recogni
tion from the university in the past four years.
According to Peter Weiler, UCLA's assistant
dean of students, interest and membership in fra
ternities has grown approximately three to four
percent each of the last seven years. Weiler attri
butes this growth in part to a "more social-based
philosophy" that arose after the Vietnam era of
the late 1960s and early '70s. "Students' values
have changed," Weiler said, "It's now ok to be
part of an established organization."
Weiler noted that students today, when asked

what their goaJs are after graduation, will usually
respond that they "want to get a better job and
make more money."
Despite the growing interest in Greek life at
UCLA, the school is not without its share of con
troversy on the role of fraternities on campus.
According to Weiler, the university recently ap
proved a measure that would "disallow any or
ganization on campus" from holding a theme
party that discriminates based upon sex, religion
or ethnic background.

This move came in response to
protests by campus groups who took
"great offense" at one fraternity's
Viva Zapata theme party, an event
which centered on Mexican culture,
Weiler said.
According to Jim Auerbach, presi
dent of Alfa Tau Omega, the Viva
Zapata party was thrown by Phi

Kappa Psi, and the university's
branch of MeCHA, a Chicano stu
dent organization, protested the
event. Auerbach said that his own
fraternity annually held an Old
Heidelberg party and that this event
was now illegal.
Weiler said the UCLA administra
tion constantly asks itself if fraterni
ties "fit in with the university's educa
tional mission" and if they project
"the kind of image that a UCLA,
Stanford and Cal should be project
ing."

use
At USC, an institution with ap
proximately 15,000 undergraduates,
nearly one-fourth of the students are
nvolved in Greek life, according to
Tom Piernik, coordinator of frater
nity and sorority life. Similar to the
situation at UCLA, Piernick noted a
"steady increase" in interest in frater
nities at the university over the past
six years.
He said a record number of women
took part in the sorority rush this fall,
but that figures are not yet in for the
men's rush which took place Sept. 17-
24.
There are 29 fraternities at USC,
all but three of which have housing,
Piernik said, adding that no new fra
ternities have been recognized for "at
least the last five years."
He said there is "very strong inter
est" in a Greek system that is "very
healthy." He characterized the situa
tion between fraternities and the uni
versity as "a very strong, supportive
relationship."
"USC has always supported a
strong Greek system," Piernik said,
noting that fraternities have been a
part of the university since 1880, re
ceiving "very strong support" from
the alumni.
Piernik said he "acknowledges
there are always problems" with fra
ternities on campus, but this "doesn't
override the benefits attatched to the
system."
University of Missouri
At the University of Missouri at

Columbia, approximately 22 percent
of the 18,000 undergraduates are in
volved in Greek activity, according to
Margy Harris, the university's Greek
life coordinator. She said there are 32
fraternities on campus, all of which
are housed, and 15 sororities, all but
one of which is housed.
She said there is "real strong inter
est" in fratenities at Mizzou, calling
Missouri "a conservative state"
where fraternities remained popular
during the 1960s and early '70s. Har
ris said popularity of fraternities
today is "on the uprise."
Lamar Graham, a sophomore at
Missouri and a member of the univer
sity's chapter of Sigma Nu, said there
is "definitely a pro-Greek attitude at
Missouri."
"Fraternities are an accepted
thing," Graham said. "There is no
Greek hate."
Harris said there is a "good posi
tive relationship" between Greeks
and the university.
Similar to the situation at USC,
Harris noted there were a record
number of pledges during the sorority
rush this fall, despite a declining en
rollment. The men's rush is held
during the summer and incoming
freshman pledges live in the fraterni
ties.
Amherst College
The story of fraternities at Amherst
College, however, is quite different.
They no longer exist at this private
Massachusetts institution with an un
dergraduate population of approxi
mately 1,500.

According to Sameer Shah, news
editor of the Amherst Student, the
controversy over fraternities had
been brewing for some time before
the board of trustees last year voted
to abolish fraternities at the college.
In 1974, when Amherst first ac
cepted women, the college began "to
elicit more demands from fraterni
ties." Charges were made that frater
nities contributed to "anti
intellectual behavior" and sexism.
Last year, all eight fraternities on
campus went coed, with somewhere
between 500 and 600 students in
volved in Greek life. A poll was con
ducted which found that of the 1,200
responding students, 85 percent were
in favor of keeping fraternities.
Despite this support, the board of
trustees voted to abolish the frater
nity system. Presently, all of the
former fraternity houses, which are
owned by the college, are filled
through a lottery similar to the Draw
at Stanford.

Ben Lieber, in his first year as dean
of students at Amherst, said there is
"not a move to reinstate fraternities,
although "some of the anger contin
ues.".
Shah noted that there have been
lawsuits filed by alumni against the
institution's action.
In an effort to improve social life
on campus after the demise of frater
nities, Lieber said the college has ap
propriated funds this year to a stu
dent programming committee which
has the responsibility to allocate this
money to dormitories and other
groups.

of Missouri, and private schools such as the Uni
versity of Southern California, where fraternities
control much of campus life, and Amherst Col
lege, where fraternities were kicked off campus
last year.
UCLA
At UCLA, a state school with an undergradu
ate population of approximately 22,000, 15 to 20
percent of the students are members of a frater
nities or or sororities. There are presently 30 fra
ternities at UCLA, 22 of which have housing.
Fraternities have been a part of UCLA since it

moved to it>, Westwood location in 1929.
Five new fraternities received formal recogni
tion from the university in the past four years.
According to Peter Weiler, UCLA's assistant
dean of students, interest and membership in fra
ternities has grown approximately three to four
percent each of the last seven years. Weiler attri
butes this growth in part to a "more social-based
philosophy" that arose after the Vietnam era of
the late 1960s and early '70s. "Students' values
have changed," Weiler said, "It's now ok to be
part of an established organization."
Weiler noted that students today, when asked

what their goaJs are after graduation, will usually
respond that they "want to get a better job and
make more money."
Despite the growing interest in Greek life at
UCLA, the school is not without its share of con
troversy on the role of fraternities on campus.
According to Weiler, the university recently ap
proved a measure that would "disallow any or
ganization on campus" from holding a theme
party that discriminates based upon sex, religion
or ethnic background.

This move came in response to
protests by campus groups who took
"great offense" at one fraternity's
Viva Zapata theme party, an event
which centered on Mexican culture,
Weiler said.
According to Jim Auerbach, presi
dent of Alfa Tau Omega, the Viva
Zapata party was thrown by Phi

Kappa Psi, and the university's
branch of MeCHA, a Chicano stu
dent organization, protested the
event. Auerbach said that his own
fraternity annually held an Old
Heidelberg party and that this event
was now illegal.
Weiler said the UCLA administra
tion constantly asks itself if fraterni
ties "fit in with the university's educa
tional mission" and if they project
"the kind of image that a UCLA,
Stanford and Cal should be project
ing."

At USC, an institution with ap
proximately 15,000 undergraduates,
nearly one-fourth of the students are
nvolved in Greek life, according to
Tom Piernik, coordinator of frater
nity and sorority life. Similar to the
situation at UCLA, Piernick noted a
"steady increase" in interest in frater
nities at the university over the past
six years.
He said a record number of women
took part in the sorority rush this fall,
but that figures are not yet in for the
men's rush which took place Sept. 17-
24.
There are 29 fraternities at USC,
all but three of which have housing,
Piernik said, adding that no new fra
ternities have been recognized for "at
least the last five years."
He said there is "very strong inter
est" in a Greek system that is "very
healthy." He characterized the situa
tion between fraternities and the uni
versity as "a very strong, supportive
relationship."
"USC has always supported a
strong Greek system," Piernik said,
noting that fraternities have been a
part of the university since 1880, re
ceiving "very strong support" from
the alumni.
Piernik said he "acknowledges
there are always problems" with fra
ternities on campus, but this "doesn't
override the benefits attatched to the
system."
University of Missouri
At the University of Missouri at

Columbia, approximately 22 percent
of the 18,000 undergraduates are in
volved in Greek activity, according to
Margy Harris, the university's Greek
life coordinator. She said there are 32
fraternities on campus, all of which
are housed, and 15 sororities, all but
one of which is housed.
She said there is "real strong inter
est" in fratenities at Mizzou, calling
Missouri "a conservative state"
where fraternities remained popular
during the 1960s and early '70s. Har
ris said popularity of fraternities
today is "on the uprise."
Lamar Graham, a sophomore at
Missouri and a member of the univer
sity's chapter of Sigma Nu, said there
is "definitely a pro-Greek attitude at
Missouri."
"Fraternities are an accepted
thing," Graham said. "There is no
Greek hate."
Harris said there is a "good posi
tive relationship" between Greeks
and the university.
Similar to the situation at USC,
Harris noted there were a record
number of pledges during the sorority
rush this fall, despite a declining en
rollment. The men's rush is held
during the summer and incoming
freshman pledges live in the fraterni
ties.
Amherst College
The story of fraternities at Amherst
College, however, is quite different.
They no longer exist at this private
Massachusetts institution with an un
dergraduate population of approxi
mately 1,500.

According to Sameer Shah, news
editor of the Amherst Student, the
controversy over fraternities had
been brewing for some time before
the board of trustees last year voted
to abolish fraternities at the college.
In 1974, when Amherst first ac
cepted women, the college began "to
elicit more demands from fraterni
ties." Charges were made that frater
nities contributed to "anti
intellectual behavior" and sexism.
Last year, all eight fraternities on
campus went coed, with somewhere
between 500 and 600 students in
volved in Greek life. A poll was con
ducted which found that of the 1,200
responding students, 85 percent were
in favor of keeping fraternities.
Despite this support, the board of
trustees voted to abolish the frater
nity system. Presently, all of the
former fraternity houses, which are
owned by the college, are filled
through a lottery similar to the Draw
at Stanford.

Ben Lieber, in his first year as dean
of students at Amherst, said there is
"not a move to reinstate fraternities,
although "some of the anger contin
ues.".
Shah noted that there have been
lawsuits filed by alumni against the
institution's action.
In an effort to improve social life
on campus after the demise of frater
nities, Lieber said the college has ap
propriated funds this year to a stu
dent programming committee which
has the responsibility to allocate this
money to dormitories and other
groups.


Last year the future of fraternities at the Uni
versity became clouded when a special task force
created to study fraternities and sororities recom
mended that "studert housing may not be denied
based on the subjective judgments of current or
former residents."
That somewhat vague statement, should it be
approved by the University, would effectively
abolish fraternity life at Stanford as we know it
today.
Both pro-fraternity and anti-fraternity spokes
men have used the examples of other schools in
their arguments. Proponents of Stanford's cur
rent system say it is mild compared to other
schools where fraternities are more prevalent,
and opponents of the Greek system point to still
other schools, where no fraternities exist at all.
