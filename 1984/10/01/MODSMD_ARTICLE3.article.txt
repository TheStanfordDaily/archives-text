### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Last year the future of fraternities at the Uni
versity became clouded when a special task force
created to study fraternities and sororities recom
mended that "studert housing may not be denied
based on the subjective judgments of current or
former residents."
That somewhat vague statement, should it be
approved by the University, would effectively
abolish fraternity life at Stanford as we know it
today.
Both pro-fraternity and anti-fraternity spokes
men have used the examples of other schools in
their arguments. Proponents of Stanford's cur
rent system say it is mild compared to other
schools where fraternities are more prevalent,
and opponents of the Greek system point to still
other schools, where no fraternities exist at all.
With this article, The Daily takes an in-depth
look at Greek life at a number of universities, in
cluding large state schools such as the University
of California at Los Angeles and the University
of Missouri, and private schools such as the Uni
versity of Southern California, where fraternities
control much of campus life, and Amherst Col
lege, where fraternities were kicked off campus
last year.
UCLA
At UCLA, a state school with an undergradu
ate population of approximately 22,000, 15 to 20
percent of the students are members of a frater
nities or or sororities. There are presently 30 fra
ternities at UCLA, 22 of which have housing.
Fraternities have been a part of UCLA since it

moved to it>, Westwood location in 1929.
Five new fraternities received formal recogni
tion from the university in the past four years.
According to Peter Weiler, UCLA's assistant
dean of students, interest and membership in fra
ternities has grown approximately three to four
percent each of the last seven years. Weiler attri
butes this growth in part to a "more social-based
philosophy" that arose after the Vietnam era of
the late 1960s and early '70s. "Students' values
have changed," Weiler said, "It's now ok to be
part of an established organization."
Weiler noted that students today, when asked

what their goaJs are after graduation, will usually
respond that they "want to get a better job and
make more money."
Despite the growing interest in Greek life at
UCLA, the school is not without its share of con
troversy on the role of fraternities on campus.
According to Weiler, the university recently ap
proved a measure that would "disallow any or
ganization on campus" from holding a theme
party that discriminates based upon sex, religion
or ethnic background.
