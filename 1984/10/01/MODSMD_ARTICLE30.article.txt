Stanford's field hockey team
played well in a first half and in a
second half, hut that didn't add up to
a victory.
The Cardinal scored two first-half
goals to shut out College of William
and Mary, 2-0, Friday at Old
Dominion University. On Saturday,
however, top-ranked Old Dominion
scored six first-half goals en route to a
9-2 victory over visiting Stanford,
now 5-3 overall.
The Cardinal plays eighth-ranked
University of North Carolina today at
Old Dominion.
Against Old Dominion, which won
the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation championship in 1982 and
1983, Stanford Coach Onnie Killefer
said the Cardinal's inexperience
showed.
"1 thought we played very well
overall," Killefer said. "In the second
half, we put pressure on the Old
Dominion defense and were more ag
gressive. We were able to launch an
attack against them. In the first half,
we made some defensive errors,
which is to be expected with the
group we have.
"But the errors are correctable. It's
just our inexperience. Old Dominion
is very quick on defense and on the
attack."
Sophomore forwards Andi Wol
pert and Mary Chung each scored un
assisted in the second half for Stan
ford against Old Dominion, 6-0.

Wolpert, a starter last season, as
sisted on senior forward Jen Bleak
ley's goal against William and Mary.
It was Bleakley's third goal of this
season. The Cardinal's second goal
was scored by Patsy Huntington, who
leads Stanford with seven goals.
Killefer said teamwork helped
I3th-ranked Stanford defeat un
ranked William and Mary.
"William and Mary is a very strong
team. They played with a lot of hits
and running rather than distributing
the play," Killefer said. "They
brought all their attack players back
on defense, and that makes it hard to
score.
"But our attack worked well as a
unit. I was pleased with the way we
worked together. . . . We distributed
the play well."
Killefer announced this weekend
that junior sweeper Suzanne Doi will
be lost for this season because of a
fractured left kneecap.
Doi, the Cardinal's only experi
enced defensive player to return for
this season, suffered that injury in
Stanford's 10-3 loss to San Jose State
Sept. 22, when a ball struck her knee.
"Suzanne was our quarterback on
defense," Killefer said. "She organ
ized everyone and was our defensive
leader. . . . She ran our defense. Now,
we don't have that leadership. Susan
Fischer will be our sweeper now."
Fischer, a junior, has never played
at the Division I level, according to
the Stanford sports information of
fice.
