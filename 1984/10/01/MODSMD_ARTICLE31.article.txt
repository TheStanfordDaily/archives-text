# California pitcher gets perfect game

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Mike Witt threw
the major league's first nine-inning perfect game in
three years as he did not allow a base runner and
the California Angels defeated the Texas Rangers
1-0 yesterday.
Witt. 15-11, struck out 10 and went to three balls
on just one batter — Wayne Tolleson in the
seventh inning — as he threw the third no-hitter
and second perfect game of the season. Jack Morris
of the Detroit Tigers no hit the Chicago White Sox
on April 7 and David Palmer of Montreal was
credited with a perfect game as he retired 1 5 bat
ters in the Expos' rain-shortened victory over the

St. Louis Cardinals on April 15.
Witt, a 24-year-old right-hander in his fourth
major-league season, didn't need any outstanding
defensive plays as he went through the Texas bat
ting order with relative ease. Larry Parrish
managed the only well-hit ball off Witt as he sent
rightfielder Mike Brown to the warning track at the
380-foot sign leading off the eighth.
Witt finished the perfect game by getting pinch
hitter Marv Foley to ground out to second. He was
then mobbed by his teammates.
The no-hitter was the seventh thrown by a Cali
fornia pitcher. The last was by Nolan Ryan against

Baltimore on June 1, 1975. It was the first no-hitter
ever thrown in Arlington Stadium and the second
time the Rangers were no-hit.
The last nine-inning perfect game was thrown by
Cleveland's Len Barker against the Toronto Blue
Jays on May 15, 1981.
Reggie Jackson drove in the lone run in the
seventh with a grounder that scored Doug
DeCinces. DeCinces singled to lead off the inning,
advanced to second on a passed ball and went to
third on Brian Downing's groundout.
Texas starter Charlie Hough, 16-14, allowed
seven hits in absorbing the loss.
