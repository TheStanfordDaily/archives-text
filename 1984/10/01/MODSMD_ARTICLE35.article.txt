# Stanford set to move if earth starts shaking
## 
### JACK ALDEN 
You are quietly sleeping in Green
Library and all of a sudden the build
ing starts to shake and sway. Books
fall off their shelves as a panicked li
brarian runs past your carrel; you are
experiencing one of California's fa
mous earthquakes — would you
know what to do?
With the San Andreas Fault a mere
four or five miles west of the Quad,
earthquake preparedness is a major
concern to the University. As part of
the continuing education about
earthquakes, Stanford is holding an
Earthquake Awareness Week start
ing yesterday and ending Friday.
Today, as part of this awareness

week, Escondido Village will have a
Neighborhood Coordinator Training
Program, which will involve the
whole village and attempt to establish
an emergency assembly point for the
low rises. On Oct. 17 "Quake Fest
'N4" will be held at White Plaza with
personnel from various safety organi
zations distributing earthquake infor
mation. In the following weeks, stu
dent residence evacuation drills will
commence.
Education, characterized by the
awareness week and the Farm Safety
and Security Almanac distributed to
students in the beginning of the year,
is just one part of the University's
program to prepare students for

earthquakes, according to Tami
Fletcher, a member of the Depart
ment of Safety's Special Services Unit
and co-organizer of the Earthquake
Awareness Week.
"You need to have both education
and drills," Fletcher said, adding that
education by itself is not good
enough. Student residences practice
evacuation drills and emergency
procedures, many times organized by
RAs, and every two years a "Fake
Quake" involves and tests students,
emergency and medical personnel.
In addition to the preparedness
week, a program in earthquake engi
neering is offered as a specialty within
the Structural Engineering program.
Students can work in the Blume
Earthquake Engineering Center,
headed by Civil Engineering Prof.
James Gere, where they learn how to
design buildings to withstand quakes.
Furthermore, the University is con
scious of the danger that campus
buildings can pose. Newer buildings
on campus (designed in the 1960s
and beyond) have been built accord
ing to modern seismic codes. These
codes are supposed to keep buildings
from collapsing even during large
earthquakes — such as a magnitude
eight earthquake, which has an en
ergy level equivalent to the average
daily U.S. energy consumption.
During an earthquake, buildings
amplify the ground motion which
causes them to sway, an effect that
while designed to occur, can be un
comfortable to the building's oc
cupants. In large earthquakes, build
ings are designed to crack, to relieve
stress and sustain other damage, but
not to collapse. Because the newer
buildings are designed this way, Gere,
co-author of a book on earthquakes
and a leading authority on
earthquake effects, said he feels
"very comfortable with them," al
though he cautioned that even in
well-designed buildings one should
take cover under a desk or doorjamb.
Older buildings, however, can pose
a greater threat, a fact that the Uni

versity recognizes, and is attempting
to correct through strengthening the
structures. The front of the Quad was
rebuilt recently due to earthquake
concerns. Gere, nevertheless, feels
that more damage will occur due to
panic than from building collapse;
people will run outside and get hurt
from falling glass and tiles — which
are wired onto the roofs — or get hurt
from falling bookcases, cabinets and
other large objects.
The main campus is not the only
place where earthquake concerns are
great. The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator faces the possiblity of struc
tural damage, fire, personnel injury
and disruption of operations during
an earthquake. Safety Officer Fred
Peregoy explained, however, that be
cause of the accelerator's construc
tion, supervised in part by John

Blume, an earthquake expert, an
earthquake of magnitude 8.3 would
most likely only cause structural
damage with no building collapse.
The accelerator, like other Stanford
buildings, has been subsequently
reinforced at great cost.
In addition to SLAC's heavy con
struction, emergency plans have been
created and drills practiced; hazards
such as lockers, cabinets and book
shelves have been bolted to walls,
emergency plans are constantly
reviewed and revised, and last year a
drill took place that involved many
emergency services. SLAC also has
many onsite resources including a fire
department, heavy equipment, emer
gency and maintainence personnel, a
dispensary and extra food and shel
ter.
"With those resources on hand,

we're in better shape than most gen
eral businesses in the event of a dis
aster," Peregoy said.
The accelerator itself presents little
danger to staff and students. Unlike a
nuclear reactor which is always in op
eration, the accelerator is "more like
a television," according to Peregoy,
because once the power is off, there
is no more radiation. In the event of
an earthquake, the accelerator would
be shut down by alarms so sensitive
that passing trucks and rattling doors
activate them.
Reservoirs around Stanford have
all been studied; if a dam is judged
unsafe, the water level in the reser
voir is regulated. The Crystal Springs
Reservoir, which lies on the San
Andreas Fault, has been judged safe
in a number of studies.


Students flee their rooms during an earthquake simulation in Madera
last spring. The exercise was part of a project for "Earthquakes and
Man," a course offered in the Geophysics Department.

"With those resources on hand,

we're in better shape than most gen
eral businesses in the event of a dis
aster," Peregoy said.
The accelerator itself presents little
danger to staff and students. Unlike a
nuclear reactor which is always in op
eration, the accelerator is "more like
a television," according to Peregoy,
because once the power is off, there
is no more radiation. In the event of
an earthquake, the accelerator would
be shut down by alarms so sensitive
that passing trucks and rattling doors
activate them.
Reservoirs around Stanford have
all been studied; if a dam is judged
unsafe, the water level in the reser
voir is regulated. The Crystal Springs
Reservoir, which lies on the San
Andreas Fault, has been judged safe
in a number of studies.

With the San Andreas Fault a mere
four or five miles west of the Quad,
earthquake preparedness is a major
concern to the University. As part of
the continuing education about
earthquakes, Stanford is holding an
Earthquake Awareness Week start
ing yesterday and ending Friday.
Today, as part of this awareness

week, Escondido Village will have a
Neighborhood Coordinator Training
Program, which will involve the
whole village and attempt to establish
an emergency assembly point for the
low rises. On Oct. 17 "Quake Fest
'N4" will be held at White Plaza with
personnel from various safety organi
zations distributing earthquake infor
mation. In the following weeks, stu
dent residence evacuation drills will
commence.
Education, characterized by the
awareness week and the Farm Safety
and Security Almanac distributed to
students in the beginning of the year,
is just one part of the University's
program to prepare students for

earthquakes, according to Tami
Fletcher, a member of the Depart
ment of Safety's Special Services Unit
and co-organizer of the Earthquake
Awareness Week.
"You need to have both education
and drills," Fletcher said, adding that
education by itself is not good
enough. Student residences practice
evacuation drills and emergency
procedures, many times organized by
RAs, and every two years a "Fake
Quake" involves and tests students,
emergency and medical personnel.
In addition to the preparedness
week, a program in earthquake engi
neering is offered as a specialty within
the Structural Engineering program.
Students can work in the Blume
Earthquake Engineering Center,
headed by Civil Engineering Prof.
James Gere, where they learn how to
design buildings to withstand quakes.
Furthermore, the University is con
scious of the danger that campus
buildings can pose. Newer buildings
on campus (designed in the 1960s
and beyond) have been built accord
ing to modern seismic codes. These
codes are supposed to keep buildings
from collapsing even during large
earthquakes — such as a magnitude
eight earthquake, which has an en
ergy level equivalent to the average
daily U.S. energy consumption.
During an earthquake, buildings
amplify the ground motion which
causes them to sway, an effect that
while designed to occur, can be un
comfortable to the building's oc
cupants. In large earthquakes, build
ings are designed to crack, to relieve
stress and sustain other damage, but
not to collapse. Because the newer
buildings are designed this way, Gere,
co-author of a book on earthquakes
and a leading authority on
earthquake effects, said he feels
"very comfortable with them," al
though he cautioned that even in
well-designed buildings one should
take cover under a desk or doorjamb.
Older buildings, however, can pose
a greater threat, a fact that the Uni

versity recognizes, and is attempting
to correct through strengthening the
structures. The front of the Quad was
rebuilt recently due to earthquake
concerns. Gere, nevertheless, feels
that more damage will occur due to
panic than from building collapse;
people will run outside and get hurt
from falling glass and tiles — which
are wired onto the roofs — or get hurt
from falling bookcases, cabinets and
other large objects.
The main campus is not the only
place where earthquake concerns are
great. The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator faces the possiblity of struc
tural damage, fire, personnel injury
and disruption of operations during
an earthquake. Safety Officer Fred
Peregoy explained, however, that be
cause of the accelerator's construc
tion, supervised in part by John

Blume, an earthquake expert, an
earthquake of magnitude 8.3 would
most likely only cause structural
damage with no building collapse.
The accelerator, like other Stanford
buildings, has been subsequently
reinforced at great cost.
In addition to SLAC's heavy con
struction, emergency plans have been
created and drills practiced; hazards
such as lockers, cabinets and book
shelves have been bolted to walls,
emergency plans are constantly
reviewed and revised, and last year a
drill took place that involved many
emergency services. SLAC also has
many onsite resources including a fire
department, heavy equipment, emer
gency and maintainence personnel, a
dispensary and extra food and shel
ter.
"With those resources on hand,

we're in better shape than most gen
eral businesses in the event of a dis
