With the U.S. presidential election
only a month away, students here are
intensifying the drive to recruit votes
for their favorite candidates.
Eric Diesel, head of Stanford Stu
dents for Mondale-Ferraro, said
more than 500 Mondale supporters
have signed up in the five days he has
had a table out in White Plaza.
"According to the national cam
paign office, that makes us the second
largest student political partisan
group in the country," Diesel said.
"And with that large labor force, we
can actually have an impact on the
state election."
Diesel said Stanford students had
signed up to walk precincts, register

voters and help with the group's or
ganizational chores.
"Our activity on campus will in
volve distributing literature and get
ting information to students, but we'll
also be concentrating on the whole
Bay Area by going door to door and
trying to rally some votes for
Mondale," Diesel said.
Steve Dauber, president of Stan
ford College Republicans, said the re
action from students at registration
had been "super" and estimated that
300 students had signed up.
Dauber said the group would have
a major voter registration drive in the
next week in order to register stu
dents in time to vote in the November
election.
"The goal of the Republican party

is to register more voters than the
Democrats, and a lot of this election
will center on voter registration,"
Dauber said.
After next week, the group will
direct its efforts to support incumbent
Congressman Ed Zschau, new state
senate candidate Becky Morgan, and
Proposition 39, a proposition dealing
with district reapportionment.
Dauber said.
"We're trying to balance our ef
forts between the competitive races
and the non-competitive races,"
Dauber said, "so our next major push
for Reagan probably won't occur un
til November 3-6 when we'll have a
get-out-the-vote drive."
According to Dauber, the group
has registered almost 50 Republicans

so far and will man a table for voter
registration this week in White Plaza.
Members of Stanford College
Republicans are also tentatively plan
ning a party on Sunday in honor of
the presidential debates and have
scheduled a major precinct walk for
Morgan on Oct. 13.
Lynn Marcus, president of Stan
ford Democrats, said that until No
vember, members of Stanford
Democrats will be working with Stan
ford Students for Mondale-Ferraro.
"Right now. we're basically the
same group, and we won't really split
up until after the election in Novem
ber," Marcus said.
Marcus said leaders of campus
groups that are pro-Mondale will
meet on Wednesday "to try and con
solidate our efforts so we don't step
on each other's toes and so we can be
the most effective."
Keith Archuleta, resident fellow
for Mirrielees and an active member
of Students against Reaganism
(STAR), said that STAR is support
ing Stanford Students for Mondale-
Ferraro, but that it is also devoting
part of it efforts to supporting Martin
Carnoy's challenge to Zschau.
"The group was formed because
students saw the need to deal with the
move to the right in this country,
what we have labeled 'Reaganism,'
and this direction in society goes
beyond this one presidential elec
tion," Archuleta said.

Archuleta said STAR has a core
group of approximately 25 people but
that nearly 60 people signed up at
registration.
"Most of our members are people
that are involved in the Rainbow
Coalition, women's groups, or third
world non-intervention groups, so it's
a very broad coalition," Archuleta
said.
Archuleta said members of STAR
will be going to dorms in order to reg
ister voters. STAR will also sponsor a
rally tonight in Terman Auditorium
which will feature officials from the
Carnoy and Mondale campaigns.
