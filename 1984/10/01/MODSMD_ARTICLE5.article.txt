### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
Stanford graduate student Francisco Alarcon
faces a bail hearing today on child molesting and
drug charges and is still under investigation in con
nection with the stabbing death of a 15-year-old
runaway in San Francisco.
Alarcon turned himself in to the San Francisco
Police Department Thursday night after police
issued an all-points bulletin for his arrest. He
remained in jail last night with bail set at $500,000.
According to police, Alarcon was the last person
to be seen with Ted Gomez, a 15-year-old runaway
from Alameda, whose body was discovered by a
person walking through Golden Gate Park last Sat
urday morning.
Police said two boys saw Gomez enter an orange
jeep-type vehicle with an older man near the inter
section of Polk and Cedar Streets in San Francisco
just after midnight last Saturday. When police drove
the two through neighboring parts of San Francisco,
the 15- and 13-year-old boys identified Alarcon's
residence and the vehicle.
According to San Francisco Police Lt. George
Kowalski, Alarcon is currently charged with having
oral copulation with the two witnesses and providing
marijuana to minors.
Both alleged violations, Kowalski said, were dis
covered during the course of the investigation into
Gomez's death.
Alarcon, 30, is a graduate student here in Spanish
and Portuguese. A graduate of Long Beach State,
Alarcon enrolled at Stanford in September 1977
and received his master's degree in April, 1980.
Alarcon is currently completing his doctoral disser
tation.
Juan Felipe Herrara, a Stanford anthropology
graduate student who lives in the same San Fran
cisco housing complex as Alarcon, told the Univer
sity News Service on Thursday that he believes the
charges against Alarcon may be "a desperate at
tempt by the police department to cover up its
image" by "dramatically linking the suspects's iden
tification not only with the murder of Ted Gomez
but with other gay-related charges."
