# Talks with Soviet pack no surprises
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
Superpower relations are unlikely
to change dramatically as a result of
Friday's meeting between President
Reagan and Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko, according to
campus experts.
Political Science Prof. Jan Triska
said he doubts the talks will have any
impact on U.S.-Soviet relations. He
described the talks as "one man
trying out the other, neither one
being very friendly, both trying to
impress each other."
The three-and-a-half-hour meeting
marked the first time the President
has met with a high Soviet official,
and the second time high officials
from the two nations had met since
the Geneva arms negotiation talks
were derailed in November. The first
was Wednesday's meeting between
Gromyko and Secretary of State
George Shultz.
After the Reagan-Gromyko
meeting, Shultz announced that the
two leaders had held "forceful and in
tense" discussions in which both sides
explained their positions at length.
The Soviet statement about the talks
was markedly more negative, with
Gromyko announcing through the
Soviet press agency Tass that the So
viet Union was still unconvinced
"about practical positive changes in
the foreign policy course of the U.S.
Administration."
Triska pointed out that the Reagan
administration has "for a long time
been very hostile to Russia, calling it
the 'evil empire' and not really being
too interested in arms control." A
sudden change in attitude, he said,
would be "surprising."
Triska said his skepticism is based
in part on his familiarity with the
views of Gen. Edward Rowny, the
chief U.S. arms control negotiator,
whom Triska met when the two were
fellows at the Wilson Center of the
Smithsonian Institute, prior to
Rowny's appointment by Reagan.
Triska said that Rowny was chosen
because of his strong opposition to
negotiations with the Soviets, whom
he viewed as untrustworthy.
History Prof. Alexander Dallin
also said he doubts Reagan adminis
tration officials could have "suddenly

changed their minds as fundamentally
as that" and said he views the
meeting as more of a "photo oppor
tunity as far as the campaign is con
cerned" than a genuine step toward
improving relations.
David Holloway, a senior research
associate at the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control
(CISAC) here, pointed out that "one
of the question marks in all this is
how much it [the new approach] is
conditioned by the elections and how
much it marks a real desire to restore

better relations with the Soviet
Union."
But Holloway said that although
"it would have been wrong to expect
anything concrete to emerge because
the degreee of hostility and mutual
suspicion has been so great" in recent
years, the talks may signal that a
change is underway.
"My guess is that within the admin
istration, there is a real desire to im
prove relations with the Soviet
Union, and this may survive the elec
tions," he said.
Holloway added, "I think it (the
meeting) is probably the first stage in
a rather intricate diplomatic game,"
which he said "might be the begin
ning of an improvement in relations
and after some time might lead to
some kind of agreement to get back
to negotiations in the arms-control
area."
Condoleezza Rice, assistant profes
sor of political science and assistant
CISAC director, agrees that the talks


Jan Triska
might signal a "small step" on what
will undoubtedly be "a long hard
road" toward improved relations. She

added that by making harsh state
ments about the Reagan Administra
tion both before and after Friday's
meeting, the Soviets were showing
that they are "unhappy about the
state of relations and not prepared to
make any grand overtures at this
point, but that they are prepared to
open the door for better relations."
The experts also indicated that the
talks may signify a shift in attitude
that may not be limited to the Reagan
administration.
Dallin said the Soviets may be fin
ding that their policies of the past
year have "boomeranged" by making
them appear unwilling to negotiate.
Robert Conquest, a Hoover senior
research fellow, was especially em
phatic on this point, saying that the
Soviets currently find themselves in
an awkward position. "They're stuck
in the mud and they have to wrench
themselves free," he said.
Conquest was referring to the

Soviets' refusal to negotiate an arms
control agreement until the NATO
nations withdraw the Pershing
missiles they have been deploying in
Europe since December.
Conquest said the Soviet's accep
tance of Reagan's invitation to meet
"may represent the beginnings of a
crack in a policy that has failed."
Unlike Dallin and Triska, Con
quest said he does not see the Admin
istration's new approach to the
Soviets as contradictory. "1 don't
think there's any contradiction in re
garding it [the Soviet Union] as a very
bad place under a very nasty regime
and also wishing to have a peaceful
settlement. You have to settle with
them," he said.
Conquest said the talks may signal
the possibility of improving relations,
adding that although the differences
between the two countries are great,
"One's got to begin somewhere."
