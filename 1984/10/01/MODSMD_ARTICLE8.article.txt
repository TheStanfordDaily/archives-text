107 Moslems sentenced to prison
CAIRO, Egypt — An Egyptian court yesterday sentenced 107 Mos
lem fundamentalists to prison terms ranging up to life at hard labor for
trying to overthrow the government after President Anwar Sadat's as
sassination three years ago.
Another 174 defendants, including a blind sheik, Omar Abdel Rah
man, who were earlier found innocent in the trial of Sadat's accused
murderers, were acquitted in the heavily guarded courtroom. The prose
cution had demanded the death penalty for all 281 men.
Some of the accused wore armbands that said. "Martyrs for Islam,"
indicating that they had expected to be executed, as happened in the
case of five extremists put to death April 15, 1982, after being found
guilty of killing Sadat. Many of the relatives of the men whose trial just
ended wept and embraced one another yesterday when Chief Judge Ab
del Ghaffar Ahmed announced the verdicts and imposed no death sen
tences.
None of the defendants showed remorse, and one former army intelli
gence officer, Lt. Col. Mohammed Zomar, sentenced to life, read a
statement insulting to Israel.
The 21-month trial, longest in Egypt's modern history, resulted in
50,000 pages of transcripts and evidence and seemed to represent the
final chapter in Sadat's assassination. The government says that no other
suspected subsersives are being held without charges.
In separate proceedings, though, another 176 Egyptians are on trial
for alleged membership in Jihad (Holy War), an underground radical Is
lamic group. None are accused of violence against the state and the pro
secution is not asking for the death penalty. The organization is ap
parently not related to Islamic Jihad (Islamic Holy War), a shadowy or
ganization in whose name responsibility has been claimed for terrorist
attacks on French and American targets in Lebanon, including last
month's suicide truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy annex in a suburb of
Beirut.
The defendants in the trial just ended — who included soldiers, civil
servants, teachers, doctors, students, farmers and one policeman — were
charged with formenting riots in the Nile River town of Assut after Sadat
was assassinated Oct. 6, 1981. Their intent, the prosecution said, was the
overthrow of the government and the transformation of Egypt into a
Iranian-style revolutionary Islamic state. Eighty-seven persons, includ
ing 66 policemen, died in the violence, but there was no hint of a popular
uprising anywhere in Egypt.
Bush assails Democrats' talk
CLEVELAND — Vice President George Bush charged yesterday
that his Democratic opponents were talking as if traditional American
values are "immoral."
Rankled by Democratic vice presidentical candidate Geraldine Fer
raro's charge that the Republicans are practicing the politics of selfish
ness, Bush told a GOP picnic here:
"You know, the opposition talks as if it were immoral to want to take
care of your own family, loved ones, and work toward the good life —
you know, maybe buy a new car or get a mortgage on a house or save up
for your children's education.
"We've got news for them; that's the American dream and there's
nothing wrong about it at all," he added.
During the rally, Bush made the same point two more times using
slightly diferent words. Later, at a press conference. Bush said that he
spoke out in such harsh terms because "I've had the feeling they mea
sure compassion by how much money the federal government spends."
An aide said that the vice president was reacting to the general thrust
of the Democratic campaign and a specific statement by Ferraro critical
of one of Bush's standard campaign lines. On the stump. Bush is known
to pull out his wallet and recall the advice of former Ohio Gov. James
Rhodes that "who puts money in" the public's pocket wins elections.
Ferraro was quoted as calling that remark "an act of selfishness," and
she declared, "This is an election, not an auction."
Said Bush of Ferraro and Democratic presidential nominee Walter
Mondale, "They're going around desperately looking for something to
feel bad about."
Trial reveals British security battle
LONDON — The lodging of criminal charges against a senior civilian
official in the Ministry of Defense for allegedly leaking sensitive docu
ments to a member of Parliament has brought to a head the battle be
tween the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and its critics over the extent of official secrecy in Britain
today.
The immediate issue, which gets its first court airing here Oct. 9, in
volves prosecution of Clive Ponting, 38, an assistant secretary in the
ministry. He is charged with passing documents to an "unauthorized
person" that dispute the official version of the 1982 torpedoing of the
Argentine cruiser Belgrano, with the loss of 368 lives.
Because the documents were provided to a member of Parliament
rather than to the press, the Ponting case could be the most severe test of
Britain's controversial, all-encompassing, 73-year-old Official Secrets
Act. That act allows prosecution of civil servants for any unauthorized
disclosure of information, even if it is not classified and has nothing to do
with national security.
The case, however, also comes in the aftermath of an increasing num
ber of leaks from within the Thatcher administration, which has raised
questions about whether there are shifting attitudes within Britain's
traditionally nonpartisan civil service.
Perhaps most important, it has also dramatized a paradox of British
society that is increasingly the subject of heightened political rhetoric,
court cases, books, media attention and private debate among other
members of Parliament. The paradox involves what critics consider to be
an unacceptable level of official secrecy in one of the oldest and other
wise most open democracies.
"This country is the most secretive democracy in the world, and that
secrecy is becoming dangerously obsessive," Shirley Williams, the presi
dent of the opposition Social Democratic Party, said.
A just-published book, "The Secrets File" by Des Wilson, also argues
that British "secrecy is more institutionalized than in any comparable
country," as is "the habit of, and instinct for, secrecy more entrenched in
the psyche of the governing and managerial elite" here. Furthermore,
Wilson says the British people contribute to the situation because
secrecy is "so deeply entrenched in the British way of life that most
people have known no other system" and thus "don't demand to know
more."
Call for reunification in China
PEKING — Premier Zhao Ziyang opened the celebration of the 35th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China with a speech last night
stressing the Communist leadership's desire for reunification with
Taiwan and for further economic reform.
Addressing 3,000 dignitaries at a reception here, Zhao said that
China's recent agreement with Britain on the future of Hong Kong will
"make a big step forward in our great cause of national reunification."
"We are ready to start joint consultations with the Taiwan authorities
and personages of all circles in Taiwan for the early realization of a way
of peaceful reunification acceptable to both sides," he said.
China has made similar overtures to Taiwan on other occasions during
the past few years, but Taiwan has consistently rejected them.
In an apparent warning to the United States, Zhao also said. "The
Taiwan question is China's internal affair, and any schemes of foreign in
terference will be firmly opposed by the Chinese people and doomed to
failure."
Zhao spoke to leading Chinese officials and to Peking-based
diplomats during a reception he gave on the eve of China's National Day
celebration. The Communist regime was established in Peking on Oct. 1,
1949.
This year, the regime, headed by Deng Xiaoping, will stage a huge
military parade and a massive display of fireworks and dancing in obser
vation of the 35th anniversary.
While an estimated 500,000 people are to take part in these festivities,
they will be doing so on an invitation-only basis. Police and security offi
cials announced that downtown Peking will be sealed off today, meaning
that most ordinary residents of the city will see the celebration only on
television.
Today's weather
It will be mostly sunny and fair today with a high in the 60s or 70s.
Tonight will be cooler with the temperature falling into the 40s.
