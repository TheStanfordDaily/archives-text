# Shultz says Reagan rejected space ban
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz said yesterday that President Reagan
rejected the idea of an immediate moratorium on
testing space weapons in his meeting with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko Friday, but
Shultz renewed U.S. hints that a moratorium could
be negotiated if the Soviet Union enters sub
stantive arms control talks.
Shultz and Robert McFarlane, Reagan's national
security adviser, both said during separate televi
sion appearances that Gromyko's nearh nine hours
of talks with U.S. officials had improved the
chances of progress in further negotiations after the
presidential election.
"I think there will be a steady discourse of in
creasing quality and . . . numbers of subjects on the
agenda," McFarlane said on CBS's "Face the Na
tion."
"We would expect to have some result from So
viet pondering of all that they've had before them
this week, within a couple of months," he said.
"The Soviet process is a very deliberate one, and
they've had quite a lot to chew on after this week,
and so it will take some time."
On an unrelated issue, Shultz said that he accepts
responsibility for the security lapses that allowed a
truck bomb to explode last month at the U.S. Em
bassy annex in a suburb of Beirut and said that if
any American official loses his job over the inci
dent, it should be he.
"There is somehow this notion that in response
to this somebody's head has to roll. Well, maybe so,
and I'm willing to have it be my head anytime
anyone wants because I certainly feel responsible,"
he said. But he said that any real blame lay with the
terrorists who launched the attack. Democratic
leaders, including presidential candidate Walter

Mondale, have charged that Reagan should
shoulder responsibility, hut Shultz was the first ad
ministration official to step forward to do so.
Shultz indicated that Gromyko repeated the
Soviets' demand for a halt in U.S. development of
space-based weaponry and deployment of new nu
clear missiles as a condition for any further talks
and that the United States was willing to consider
such concessions — but only after talks begin.
Gromyko "wants us to put a freeze on our
modernization of our defensive and deterrent
forces," Shultz said on ABCs "This Week with
David Brinkley." "He wants us to put a freeze 011
our efforts to do our research and develop our
thinking about outer space. . . . That's not sensible
from our standpoint. There's no reason why we
should give them what they want in order to start
discussions. We should start discussions and find
things that are mutually agreeable, and then work
out the agreements on them."
Asked directly whether Reagan offered
Gromyko a moratorium before talks begin, Shultz
said, "No."
The Soviets have insisted on two preconditions
for resuming the arms control talks that Moscow
suspended last year: that the United States and its
NATO allies should stop deploying new U.S.-made
mid-range nuclear missiles in Europe and remove
those already deployed and that the United States
renounce its planned development of space
weaponry.
The Reagan administration has refused to make
any such concessions simply to restart the talks, but
in the past week it has signaled willingness to con
sider them once negotiations are under way, in
hopes of bridging the gap between the two posi
tions.

The Soviets have also proposed talks on the sole
issue of space weaponry, in which U.S. technology
is considered superior to theirs. The administration
has insisted that any arms negotiations should also
cover offensive nuclear missiles, and McFarlane
said that position remains firm. "It is irresponsible
for the two superpowers to ignore a family of exist
ing weapons which threaten people today. We just
can't do that," he said. "We're perfectly willing to
talk about space systems right now, but we also
need to talk about offensive systems."
McFarlane said Reagan told Gromyko that the
United States does not insist that the suspended
Geneva arms control negotiations be resumed in
their original forms, which could have embarrassed
the Soviets. "The specific value of this exchange
was that our willingness to accept virtually any for
mat or combination or agenda that they might like
to propose was clear, he said.
McFarlane said that the Reagan-Gromyko
meeting Friday began with both men airing their
grievances before any real discussion began. "The
president laid out our view of history and the basis
for our concern about the Soviet Union, he said.
"The foreign minister did the same thing with how
they view the postwar period. But then it got into
the agenda of issues that separate us right now,
arms control importantly; and over the course of
two hours there was clearly an evocation from our
side, by the president, of what it is that troubles us
and where we can be flexible.
McFarlane said Gromyko appeared surprised at
one point, during a discussion of the nuclear bal
ance. "that the president really knew what he was
talking about."

The Reagan administration has refused to make
any such concessions simply to restart the talks, but
in the past week it has signaled willingness to con
sider them once negotiations are under way, in
hopes of bridging the gap between the two posi
tions.

The Soviets have also proposed talks on the sole
issue of space weaponry, in which U.S. technology
is considered superior to theirs. The administration
has insisted that any arms negotiations should also
cover offensive nuclear missiles, and McFarlane
said that position remains firm. "It is irresponsible
for the two superpowers to ignore a family of exist
ing weapons which threaten people today. We just
can't do that," he said. "We're perfectly willing to
talk about space systems right now, but we also
need to talk about offensive systems."
McFarlane said Reagan told Gromyko that the
United States does not insist that the suspended
Geneva arms control negotiations be resumed in
their original forms, which could have embarrassed
the Soviets. "The specific value of this exchange
was that our willingness to accept virtually any for
mat or combination or agenda that they might like
to propose was clear, he said.
McFarlane said that the Reagan-Gromyko
meeting Friday began with both men airing their
grievances before any real discussion began. "The
president laid out our view of history and the basis
for our concern about the Soviet Union, he said.
"The foreign minister did the same thing with how
they view the postwar period. But then it got into
the agenda of issues that separate us right now,
arms control importantly; and over the course of
two hours there was clearly an evocation from our
side, by the president, of what it is that troubles us
and where we can be flexible.
McFarlane said Gromyko appeared surprised at
one point, during a discussion of the nuclear bal
ance. "that the president really knew what he was
talking about."

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz said yesterday that President Reagan
rejected the idea of an immediate moratorium on
testing space weapons in his meeting with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko Friday, but
Shultz renewed U.S. hints that a moratorium could
be negotiated if the Soviet Union enters sub
stantive arms control talks.
Shultz and Robert McFarlane, Reagan's national
security adviser, both said during separate televi
sion appearances that Gromyko's nearh nine hours
of talks with U.S. officials had improved the
chances of progress in further negotiations after the
presidential election.
"I think there will be a steady discourse of in
creasing quality and . . . numbers of subjects on the
agenda," McFarlane said on CBS's "Face the Na
tion."
"We would expect to have some result from So
viet pondering of all that they've had before them
this week, within a couple of months," he said.
"The Soviet process is a very deliberate one, and
they've had quite a lot to chew on after this week,
and so it will take some time."
On an unrelated issue, Shultz said that he accepts
responsibility for the security lapses that allowed a
truck bomb to explode last month at the U.S. Em
bassy annex in a suburb of Beirut and said that if
any American official loses his job over the inci
dent, it should be he.
"There is somehow this notion that in response
to this somebody's head has to roll. Well, maybe so,
and I'm willing to have it be my head anytime
anyone wants because I certainly feel responsible,"
he said. But he said that any real blame lay with the
terrorists who launched the attack. Democratic
leaders, including presidential candidate Walter

Mondale, have charged that Reagan should
shoulder responsibility, hut Shultz was the first ad
ministration official to step forward to do so.
Shultz indicated that Gromyko repeated the
Soviets' demand for a halt in U.S. development of
space-based weaponry and deployment of new nu
clear missiles as a condition for any further talks
and that the United States was willing to consider
such concessions — but only after talks begin.
Gromyko "wants us to put a freeze on our
modernization of our defensive and deterrent
forces," Shultz said on ABCs "This Week with
David Brinkley." "He wants us to put a freeze 011
our efforts to do our research and develop our
thinking about outer space. . . . That's not sensible
from our standpoint. There's no reason why we
should give them what they want in order to start
discussions. We should start discussions and find
things that are mutually agreeable, and then work
out the agreements on them."
Asked directly whether Reagan offered
Gromyko a moratorium before talks begin, Shultz
said, "No."
The Soviets have insisted on two preconditions
for resuming the arms control talks that Moscow
suspended last year: that the United States and its
NATO allies should stop deploying new U.S.-made
mid-range nuclear missiles in Europe and remove
those already deployed and that the United States
renounce its planned development of space
weaponry.
The Reagan administration has refused to make
any such concessions simply to restart the talks, but
in the past week it has signaled willingness to con
sider them once negotiations are under way, in
hopes of bridging the gap between the two posi
tions.

The Soviets have also proposed talks on the sole
issue of space weaponry, in which U.S. technology
