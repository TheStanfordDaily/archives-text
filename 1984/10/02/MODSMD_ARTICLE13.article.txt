## The 						Stanford Daily Pub Board undermined 
### 
The ASSI Senate is supposed to represent the
interests ot •"the entire Stanford student body.'*
according to the ASSI eonstitution. But the sen
ate's decision to exclude student periodicals from
their own funding process represents an insen
sitiv ity to that duty.
I he Publications Board comprises representa
tives from each student publication on campus.
I he board, until last week. played a key role in
allocating the fee-assessment money collected by
the ASSI for student publications.
But now. the board will be able only to ap
prove or to veto a budget made elsewhere. This
role means little, since the board will almost have
to approve the budget. Vetoing it would
require the budget process to return to stage one
and could force some periodicals to publish as
late as Dead Week.
This bill shifts the responsibility tit budgeting,
and with it a great deal of power, to a group
called the Finance Committee.
The shift might not have been all bad. Prior to
this bill, students representing campus publica
tions formed a majority of this committee. Under
the new rules, however, an at-large-student —
likely to be an ASSIJ senator — will replace one
of the representatives from the publications: a
significant realignment on a committee with only
four votinn members.

This legislation runs contrary to student inter
ests in se\eral vvays.
First. those students who have the most at
stake and are the best informed in this budget
process — members of the Publications Board —
become spectators.
Second, the suddenly powerful Finance Com
mittee will have as many senators as student
publication representatives. This provision is
wholly unnecessary since the senate's own Ap
propriations Committee passes final judgment on
all budgets any vv ay.
All ot this despite the fact that the senate, m
anyone who has attended a senate meeting can
testify, already has too many duties to function
efficiently.
Finally, the move was made without proper de
liberation. The bill's author, graduate Senator
.lames McGrath. managed to clear away the ne
cessary preliminary work on the bill this summer
and push it through the senate a week and a half
before the first" meeting of the Publications Board
and only a few days after senators returned from
summer vacation.
I he entire move reeks of a power grab. The
welfare of Stanford students is not served by ram
rodding bills through the senate which deny stu
dents outside the ASSU a chance to govern
themselves.
