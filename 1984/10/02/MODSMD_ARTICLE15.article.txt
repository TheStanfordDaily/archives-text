## U.S. playing bully in Central America 
### 
Most Americans assume that our
government basically reflects our in
terests. our moral values, and our
aspirations for a prosperous and just
society. Not starry-eyed, we know
that lite is a struggle, sometimes |iist
to survive, and we know that
sometimes we must light tor our
rights with methods that aren't neces
sarily in the rule book. So when we
look at our government we urant it as

VIEWPOINT

much. We accept a certain amount ot
pragmatism in foreign affairs, a cer
tain amount ot covert activity, be
cause we know that our country must
defend itsell when threatened |iist ;is
a person may have to use lorce to
defend his principles. But. overall,
there persists in us the faith that our
government is really trying to do the
right thing, that decency and fair play
figure in its actions, and that it really
is trying to defend freedom and
justice in the world.
One needn't look deeply into the
Reagan administration's foreign
policy to recognize how mistaken we
are. and nowhere does the fallacy of
this appear so clearly as in Central
America, where the administration's
hypocrisy has reached a new summit
with its complicity 111 the kidnappings
and murders of civilian political can
didates in Nicaragua. More than NO
persons have disappeared at the hands
ot the CIA-backed contras. among
them Ray Hooker. American
educated and dedicated to helping
the impoverished Miskitu Indians,
who was recently abducted near
Bluefields on the Atlantic coast. The
administration insisted that
Nicaragua hold elections, and now
that it is. it's resorting to these
foul tactics to disrupt them. Its con
cern for democracy seems to apply
onlv in countries such as HI Salvador.

where it has conic to light that I S.
dollars I a rticl > financed Napoleon
Duarte's winning campaign last
March. In the last year we have heard
much ol the secret war in Nicaragua,
the deceit and double-dealing ol the
administration 111 mining Nicaraguan
harbors and building military bases in
Honduras. Recently it has come out
that the CIA gave three planes and a
helicopter to the contras. against the
orders ot C ongress Now the obvious
question is. irom whom were these
activities meant to be secret? Not the
Nicaraguans They never doubted the
CIA involvement. The only ones
tooled were Congress and the Ameri
can public. Now Reagan wants to
send AC-47 gunships to the HI Sal
vadoran army. I 'hose planes can
saturate a football held, about the
si/e ol .1 rural village, with one bullet
per square loot every minute. What
explains this military aid to HI Sal
vador? Is it threatened with conquest
Irom a violent neighbor? No. These
countries are too poor to tight each
other. The sole purpose ot the nuli
tarv in HI Salvador is to tight its own
people.
On the level ot individuals the be
havior ot the Reagan administration
is nothing but sneaky, lying, mali
cious. and cowardly. It is the ninth
grade bully who beats to a pulp the
hrst grader befriended by his much
bigger rival. It is the local official who
proclaims loudly tor morality and
propriety, but profits in his private
life from the intimidation and evic
tion of pensioners. It is the powerful
businessman who. after losing to
someone in a legal battle, hires thugs
to go and cripple him in the night. In
short, our government's policies are
despicable. And.it is nothing at all
like the American people.
