## Campaign '84, mood vs. reality 
### 
I watched NBC" on the night o! Aug. 23. the last
day ol the Republican National Convention. NIK'
was the only network to broadcast in full the fa
mous I K-mmute Ronald Reagan propaganda film.
I found it a very educational experience. Not edu
cational about the issues facing the countr\. or even
the policies ol Reagan, but educational about the
way Reagan's campaign is going to present him to
the country in his eltort to win another tour \ears in
the White Mouse. Curiously, the film wasn't really
about Reagan. He was barely more visible than the
beautifully photographed, sepia-tinted scenes ol
the Statue of l iberty, the Olympic torch-bearers
and little kids waving American fla.es. The film ad-

VIEWPOINT

uressed hardly a single substantive aspect ol
Reagan's presidency, or a single substantive issue
facing the I'nited States in 1 MS4. The film ignored
the issues, it ignored Reagan's record and it
ignored his openly announced plans and policies
tor the future. Instead, like Reagan s re-election
campaign, it occupies itself entirely with a certain
perceived "mood of the country." This mood has
been noted by many observers of American soci
ety . It has been described as a "resurgence ol patri
otism." a "rebirth of hope in the future." or simply
as a new "era ol good feelings." It was seen in the
Olympics; it can be seen in new TV shows such as
"Call to (ilorv." The mood undoubtedly exists.
Republicans think Reagan deserves the credit for
it.and they think Americans will grant him re
election because ol it. The message of the IN
minute lilm and of Reagan's re-election campaign
is that we should re-elect him. not because we
agree with his politics, or because we like what he is
going to do in a second term, but rather because, in
some vague, undefined way. he has made us "feel
good." Never in American history. I submit, has a
president campaigned lor re-election on a platform
so nebulous, gauzy and insubstantial. Never has a
president so openly scorned any interest in the is
sues. and never has a president been so supremely
confident that the American people will happily re
elect. not a real president with real plans and
policies, but rather a mood.
Reagan has made no secret of his intention to
ignore the substantive issues; he hasn't "dodged"
or "evaded" them. He has laughed in the face ol
the issues. When Mondale proposed si\ debates,
one on each area of government policy. Reagan
laughed the proposal oft. saying the debates would

"bore the pants oil the voters." Clearly they would
bore the pants oft him. The intriguing thing is his
certainty that the American people share his alti
tude. I sometimes have a sneaking dread thai his
assessment of them is correct. Certainly it is
ama/ing to run down the list of substantive issues
on which Reagan has gleefully slapped the face ol a
majority of the American people. In a year when
the Democrats made history by nominating a wo
man for vice president, the Republicans casually
and arrogantly snubbed the f>o percent of the
American people who support the Kqiial Rights
Amendment. Five separate motions to merely
mention, much less endorse, the I RA. or even the
general concept of equality for women, tailed even
to gain a seconding vote in the Republican Plat
form Committee. Reagan has explicitly affirmed
again and again his goal of outlawing all abortions,
and he has made perfectly clear his intention (as re
quired by the Republican platform) ol packing the
Supreme Court with ultra-conservatives who share
his position, a position with which more than SO
percent of the American public disagrees. Reagan

. . . in some vague, un
defined way, he has
made us "feel good."

has likened supporters of the nuclear freeze to
" jackasses." Seventy-five percent of the American
people support the nuclear freeze. The list goes on
and on.
More maddening than Reagan's cheerful disre
gard for such substantive issues is the fact that he
seems to be getting away with it. Crowds cheer
madly when Reagan proclaims that our military is
"standing tall again."' Never mind that according to
bipartisan congressional reports, combat readiness
is seriously down since IVSO. Reagan trumpets his
achievement of toppling the government of
Grenada, which had an army the size of the
1..A.P.1). He tearfully announces how proud he is
of the men and women in uniform. Never mind the

24 1 young Marines who died in I ebanon as a result
ol Ins blundering. incompetent stupidity in sending
tin-in then*. Never mi ml that m a real war. the
(i.l.'s would run out of spare parts 111 a matter ol
weeks.
Most ineredihle is how Reagan gets away, with
out a single protesting voice, with declaring that he
favors "reducing the si/c of government" (that is.
cutting Federal spending). This claim is simply a
flat-out lie. Reagan not only has not. will not ;nid
cannot cut government spending, he doesn't even
want to! lie has worked vigorously in the past, and
has promised to work vigorously in the future, to
achieve enormous military spending increases,
which will far outweigh any conceivable cuts in
domestic spending. Reagan claims that his deficits,
which are more than four times the size ol Outer's,
can he reduced without raising taxes — hut it is his
own announced policy of massive military increases
which rules out any other way of closing those
deficits. I'nless lie has. hy some mysterious al
chemy. excluded the military from the concept ol
•'government spending." the simple fact is that
Reagan is 110 " fiscal conservative" at all. Init rather
the biggest l\ig spender ol all time. Such obstinate
lacts are glossed over in Reagan's re-election cam
paign. Hssential to the "mood" he is inculcating is
his image ol being "strong on defense" and
"against big government." Never mind that these
two positions are flatly contradictory.
Ihe central question of the I I )N4 campaign, then,
is whether the American people will choose the
mythical, world view which Reagan so
ardently believes in. and which he so ardently
wishes to share with them, or whether they will sit
back and decide this election 011 the merits. 111 this
campaign, to mangle Freudian jargon, Reagan
represents the pleasure principle and Mondalc
represents the reality principle. Mondalc buzzes
unpleasantly around people's heads, reminding
them ol all the issues 011 which they disagree with
Reagan, and ol the bitter medicine they know will
be necessary to close the deficits. Mondalc is
indeed a "party-poopcr." as one Republican has
said. He challenges the gauzy, mythic dream world
depicted in Reagan's IK-minute film. It's hard to
compare the two candidates' answers to the
country s problems in this election. I here is only
one candidate who is even talking about the
country s problems. Whether Americans choose to
listen will decide the outcome on Nov. 6.
