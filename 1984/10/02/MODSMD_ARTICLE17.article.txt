I was saddened In the news that our light hearted

possible, a tall man. Dean Fred. was gone. And the
tradition'.' Well we just won't know for at least an
other vear. The freshmen students this vear were
admitted, the last admitted. In his pen.
I read the news in a Dailv I picked lip in front ot
the bookstore when I noticed a seeminglv incon
spicuous outgrowth ot free enterprise: One displav
table had a tall pile ot SS Froshbooks on sale tor
five bucks a piece. This wasn't done a couple ot
vears ago. and this clue clicked with another tact
that mv mind had subliminallv collected a tew
minutes earlier in White Pla/a and then in the
bookstore. I had never seen so nianv attractive,
voung. female students on campus.
Warning: this is bv nature a sexist article. I'm a
male and I can't pretend to speak from a woman's
perspective on main issues.
There used to be a terrible phrase, shouted
during flicks, whispered in circles of co-ed males, a
phrase now dving even in the fraternities. It was
"Stanford Woman." a phrase used bv male stu
dents to release the frustration thev accumulated
from interactions with female students here who
were, let's sav. less trusting in sexual matters,
spending more energv jogging and studying, and
perhaps, less attractive than the home-town girls

And they are. At the lirst tew parties to open the
year every one of the upper class males I spoke
with agreed that something beyond statistical
likelihood was at hand changing the face of the
campus. They hadn't even begun drinking yet.

jealous ot those naive grins, reminiscing about our
own energetic fear when we first pushed our way
through a crowded I rat party. At a party last week
the skeptical president ot the hosting brotherhood
had this to say. "Certainly, they look sweeter but
they don't seem to be as sweet." this sounds like a
horrid generalization, but he mentioned that he
doesn't see the new generation say hello to the fel
low students the\ pass by. or make any effort to
reach out and ui\e life to strangers. "The laid back
festive attitude of the old regime is losing out to a
sea of preppies who are into themselves.''
We all rubbed our chins, scratched our noses and
thought. Then, in chorus, we told him he was being
a jerk and we asked the young ladies to dance.
Thanks Dean Fred.
