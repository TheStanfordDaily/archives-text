## Off-campus housing: scarce and costly 
### JULIE RYAN Daily stuff 
hen the University built 800 new housing spaces two
years ago, optimists claimed that it would mean four years
of guaranteed housing for undergraduates. I lowever, in
creased demand virtually olfset the gains made, and the
unlucky tew were again pitted against wealthy Silicon Val
ley residents to find local housing this year.
I hough Stantord boasts a large percentage ot students
housed on campus, there are a fair number who must
search tor rental units in what Rodger Whitney, director
of housing, characterizes as one of the "most expensive
and tight housing systems' in the country. Business in this
area is expanding but Whitney said, "there are not a lot of

options for people to develop new housing. We're on a
landlocked peninsula."
According to Whitney students are often surprised at
how much they have to spend to live in the area. Though
prices vary widely, he said one should expect to pay at
least $200 to $400 lor a room in a house. "A studio will
cost around $400," he said. "A one bedroom apartment
between $500 and $600 and houses start at around $1,000
a month."
Senior Frederic Vanderelst, who searched for off
campus accomodations this summer, described the market
as "tighter than ever." He said, "It was terrible. Rents in
the area generally went up 20 percent" over the previous
year.
Since Vanderelst was unable to arrive on campus very
early most of the housing was already taken. When he
arrived, on Sept. 20, he said the housing clearinghouse
was "worthless."
The clearinghouse lists rental housing available lor stu
dents. According to Vanderelst there were more houses
available there at the same time last year. "I his year I
ended up just using the local paper." he said.
Senior Anne Hang spent several weeks in August
looking for housing, although she was eventually assigned
in the walk-on round. After "two intense weekends of
looking," she claims that there is "definitely a bias against
Stanford students." She said. " A lot of houses are very
expensive or only want a couple or a family to live there.
Although landlords are not allowed to discriminate by
age, they may require possible tenants to till out a credit
form and have some discretion in who they select, for
some of the openings, up to twenty people might be inter
viewed.
"Students definitely have to work at it,' Whitney said
of the search for off-campus rooms. "But I think most ol
them find housing. People are fairly creative, for exam
ple. they get more people to share the house to reduce the
cost,""he added.
Another housing alternative which has become more
popular this year is the work-share system, in which stu
dents are expected to do a certain amount of work every

week in exchange tor part or all of their rent "There are
tons of them, but some people expect you to work 20
hours a week, which is ridiculous. That's SO hours ot work
a month and if you figure it out it means you're getting
paid less than $5 an hour. I think some people in the area
definitely take advantage of the fact that students need
housing," Bang said.
Most families also want to interview the potential boar
der, adding to the difficulties of students who don't live
nearby.
The search for housing is certainly more difficult tor
those living out of week-end driving range. During the
summer the housing office posts available housing and
"by late August or early September there are people
waiting in the office for the new listings to come out
everyday," according to Whitney. Serious lookers often
take time off from work to get to the office before the
most promising places are taken.
lor long-distance hunters the housing office does run a
clearinghouse for about three-and-a-half weeks before
registration. "People spend as much time as they can af
ford to before school starts," Whitney explained. The
"clearinghouse hotel" is set up in Wilbur and students can
live there for $I I per night for a double or $17 a night to:
a single.
The biggest decision for some students is whether to
devote much-valued summer hours looking for housing or
whether to take a chance with the walk-on assignments.
This year Whitney est nated that approximately 240 stu
dents went through walk-ons. "We accommodated all the
graduate men and women and all the undergraduate wo
men." he said, "but we still turned away at least 40
(undergraduate men)."
This year walk-ons no longer drew a new number to de
termine their priority for receiving housing. Instead
priority was based on one's spring draw number. This was
designed, in part, to give students a better idea about
where they stood, so they could decide whether or not to
wait for walk-ons.
Bang, who had moved into a house for a wee* this sum
mer before walking on. was happy to have on-campu*
housing, but regreted having to make another move. She
said she didn't like walking-on because of the risk ot end
ing up with no housing at all. When she was eventually as
signed she said. "I was really torn. ... I have not had a
very settled life for weeks now."
"There was a net gain of 700 spaces to the undergradu

ate pool when the new housing was built."
Whitney said. "But it still seems the same as it
did two years ago. The waiting list was down a little this
vear hut not much." He speculated that students don't
give up as easily as they once did. "It sort of surprised us."

Several graduate spots were turned over to undergradu
ates this year hut according to Whitney this is due not
to sufficient housing for graduates hut to dissatisfaction
with the housing options available to them. " I'm sure if we
had different kinds ot housing it would certainly he
tilled.'' he said.
Whitney said that a committee on new housing for
graduate students submitted a report last spring recom
mending that 1.1(10 additional spaces he built lor graduate
students on campus. "Graduate students face a much big
ger shortage." Whitnev said. Stanford currentlv houses

approximately 40 percent of its graduate students.
Although Whitney characterized the Stanford housing
problem as serious he said, " it you look at Boston. New
York. Chicago or Los Angeles, we're not way out of line
rental-wise. It sounds to me like their off-campus markets
are not much different."
He also pointed out that the University of California at
Berkeley, our ri\al across the Bay. does not e\en guaran
tee housing for freshmen and only houses S percent of its
graduate students on campus. "It we're in a problem area,
then thev're in a rerv serious area." he said.

men." he said, "but we still turned away at least 40
(undergraduate men)."
This year walk-ons no longer drew a new number to de
termine their priority for receiving housing. Instead
priority was based on one's spring draw number. This was
designed, in part, to give students a better idea about
where they stood, so they could decide whether or not to
wait for walk-ons.
Bang, who had moved into a house for a wee* this sum
mer before walking on. was happy to have on-campu*
housing, but regreted having to make another move. She
said she didn't like walking-on because of the risk ot end
ing up with no housing at all. When she was eventually as
signed she said. "I was really torn. ... I have not had a
very settled life for weeks now."

ate pool when the new housing was built."
Whitney said. "But it still seems the same as it
did two years ago. The waiting list was down a little this
vear hut not much." He speculated that students don't
give up as easily as they once did. "It sort of surprised us."

Several graduate spots were turned over to undergradu
ates this year hut according to Whitney this is due not
to sufficient housing for graduates hut to dissatisfaction
with the housing options available to them. " I'm sure if we
had different kinds ot housing it would certainly he
tilled.'' he said.
Whitney said that a committee on new housing for
graduate students submitted a report last spring recom
mending that 1.1(10 additional spaces he built lor graduate
students on campus. "Graduate students face a much big
ger shortage." Whitnev said. Stanford currentlv houses

approximately 40 percent of its graduate students.
Although Whitney characterized the Stanford housing
problem as serious he said, " it you look at Boston. New
York. Chicago or Los Angeles, we're not way out of line
rental-wise. It sounds to me like their off-campus markets
are not much different."
He also pointed out that the University of California at
Berkeley, our ri\al across the Bay. does not e\en guaran
tee housing for freshmen and only houses S percent of its
graduate students on campus. "It we're in a problem area,
then thev're in a rerv serious area." he said.

hen the University built 800 new housing spaces two
years ago, optimists claimed that it would mean four years
of guaranteed housing for undergraduates. I lowever, in
creased demand virtually olfset the gains made, and the
unlucky tew were again pitted against wealthy Silicon Val
ley residents to find local housing this year.
I hough Stantord boasts a large percentage ot students
housed on campus, there are a fair number who must
search tor rental units in what Rodger Whitney, director
of housing, characterizes as one of the "most expensive
and tight housing systems' in the country. Business in this
area is expanding but Whitney said, "there are not a lot of

area definitely take advan
tage of the fact that students
need housing. 1
— Senior Anne Bang

options for people to develop new housing. We're on a
landlocked peninsula."
According to Whitney students are often surprised at
how much they have to spend to live in the area. Though
prices vary widely, he said one should expect to pay at
least $200 to $400 lor a room in a house. "A studio will
cost around $400," he said. "A one bedroom apartment
between $500 and $600 and houses start at around $1,000
a month."
Senior Frederic Vanderelst, who searched for off
campus accomodations this summer, described the market
as "tighter than ever." He said, "It was terrible. Rents in
the area generally went up 20 percent" over the previous
year.
Since Vanderelst was unable to arrive on campus very
early most of the housing was already taken. When he
arrived, on Sept. 20, he said the housing clearinghouse
was "worthless."
The clearinghouse lists rental housing available lor stu
dents. According to Vanderelst there were more houses
available there at the same time last year. "I his year I
ended up just using the local paper." he said.
Senior Anne Hang spent several weeks in August
looking for housing, although she was eventually assigned
in the walk-on round. After "two intense weekends of
looking," she claims that there is "definitely a bias against
Stanford students." She said. " A lot of houses are very
expensive or only want a couple or a family to live there.
Although landlords are not allowed to discriminate by
age, they may require possible tenants to till out a credit
form and have some discretion in who they select, for
some of the openings, up to twenty people might be inter
viewed.
"Students definitely have to work at it,' Whitney said
of the search for off-campus rooms. "But I think most ol
them find housing. People are fairly creative, for exam
ple. they get more people to share the house to reduce the
cost,""he added.
Another housing alternative which has become more
popular this year is the work-share system, in which stu
dents are expected to do a certain amount of work every

week in exchange tor part or all of their rent "There are
tons of them, but some people expect you to work 20
hours a week, which is ridiculous. That's SO hours ot work
a month and if you figure it out it means you're getting
paid less than $5 an hour. I think some people in the area
definitely take advantage of the fact that students need
housing," Bang said.
Most families also want to interview the potential boar
der, adding to the difficulties of students who don't live
nearby.
The search for housing is certainly more difficult tor
those living out of week-end driving range. During the
summer the housing office posts available housing and
"by late August or early September there are people
waiting in the office for the new listings to come out
everyday," according to Whitney. Serious lookers often
take time off from work to get to the office before the
most promising places are taken.
lor long-distance hunters the housing office does run a
clearinghouse for about three-and-a-half weeks before
registration. "People spend as much time as they can af
ford to before school starts," Whitney explained. The
"clearinghouse hotel" is set up in Wilbur and students can
live there for $I I per night for a double or $17 a night to:
a single.
The biggest decision for some students is whether to
devote much-valued summer hours looking for housing or
whether to take a chance with the walk-on assignments.
This year Whitney est nated that approximately 240 stu
dents went through walk-ons. "We accommodated all the
graduate men and women and all the undergraduate wo
men." he said, "but we still turned away at least 40
(undergraduate men)."
