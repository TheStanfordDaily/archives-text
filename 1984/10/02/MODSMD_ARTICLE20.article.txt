Alter waiting in long lines tor a
telephone this past week, it ma\ he
comforting for the student here to
realize that the telephone is good lor
more than arguments with your
roommate over phone bills. It is also
good tor more than length) chats with
your friends hack home.
\ telephone can he a great source
of lood and fun.
for starters there's pi//a. Nut
only does Ramona's 100 deliver, hut
they specialize in "special pizzas"
which are combinations ol delicious
vegetables, meats and cheeses. Prices
lor the specials range from SN-1 5.
and from 55.50 to S I'•.s(> for the
more conventional plain cheese piz
zas. Extras on the cheese pizzas can
cost from SI to $1.50.
"There is no comparison between
our pizza and the other company's
(Domino's) as far as qualitv goes."
said Art Wong, an owner ol
Ramona's 100. The reason that
Ramona's is less popular among stu
dents here is that it has a strict
deliverv policy.
"We do not deliver to dorm rooms,
unlike the other company. Instead,
you must meet us at a specific time
and place." said Wong. "And we'll
call vou ten minutes ahead to make
sure that everything is still set."
Still, there are those that swear by
Dominos. The reason for the devo
tion to Dominos is the speed of
delivery. "I always get Dominos he
cause it's so dependable, even though
the pizza can be lukewarm at times."
said one sophomore. Dominos prom
ises to deliver pizza to your room
within 30 minutes of your call.
If pizza is not your desire but
several half gallons ol ice cream is
what you've got to have, then there's
delivery service available from
Haagen Dazs Ice Cream. Cartons of
their cassis, honey vanilla, cookies
and cream and other flavors range
from $23 to $4N. plus a small dona
tion for the delivery hoy.
The ice-cream lover will be pleased
to find out that within the next two
weeks. Swensen's ot Menlo Park will
begin delivery service from 7 p.m. to
1 2 a.m. every night except Sunday .
"All b5 flavors will he available, in
scoops, pints, quarts and half gal
lons." said the owner of Swensen's.
"We will be starting a big ad cam
paign soon." An appealing part ot
this service is that there is only a ten
dollar minimum on orders, plus tip.
Another late night munchie that
comes to your room is Mem-Chips.
