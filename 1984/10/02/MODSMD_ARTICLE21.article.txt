# The 						Mosquito Report: Why does the Farm have the itch?

freshmen aren t the only species
returning to Stanford this fall in
record numbers — there is another
more irritating and troublesome pest
flourishing on campus — the
mosquito. The recent outbreak of the

insects have students and faculty buzz
ing about the itching and discomfort
that result from the notorious
mosquito bite. Students wishing to

favored a closed-window policy and
long pants strategy, despite the recent
unseasonably hot weather, to protect
themselves from the menacing
vampires.

I he current dilemma prompted
one Stanford sophomore to note. "I
thought 1 left this problem at home
when I left lowa. This is as bad as
anything I've ever seen at home."
Ihe mosquito problem is not in
digenous to this region but is the
result of leaks in some of the water
pipes near the bayside Palo Alto
Water Quality Control Plant. The
water from the leaks saturated the

nearby fields creating a haven for the
mosquito eggs to hatch into the
larvae, which eventually terror
ized nearby communities. Thanks
to pervailing northwesterly winds, the
insects have enjoyed free, one-way
ticket rides to East Palo Alto. Menlo
Park. Palo Alto and Stanford where
they stalk their victims unmercifully.
I he type of mosquito hatching near
the bay lands is Aedes Dorsalis, a par
ticularly pesky member of the family
known to afflict its prey, especially
during early morning and dusk.
Victims, though, can take heart 111
knowing there is relief in sight. The
waterpipes have been repaired, and
San Mateo County health officials
have been spraying the bayside site

with insecticide. The problem which
Ikis plagued Stanford and surround
ing areas should dissipate within the
next few days. In the meantime don't
throw away the mosquito repellent.
