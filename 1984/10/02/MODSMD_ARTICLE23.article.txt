## Dave Dutcher Bad breaks, no baskets 
### 
The loss ot Steve Brown, who
cun be seen on the cover ot this
season's prospectus ot the Stan
lord men s basketball team, in
creases to three the number of
consistent offensive players the
Cardinal must replace.
Brown, a senior, suffered a
stress fracture in the shin of
ins right leg and will miss this
season Me was to he one ot I I
returners More important. Coach
Tom Davis was counting on
Brown to till a void at scoring
guard.
I hat void was created by the
graduation ol four-year letterman
Keith Jones, who averaged 2d
points per game during the Car
dinal's HJN3-N4 season.
Jones, who holds Stanford's
single-season scoring record ol
6|y points, was drafted in June by
the I.os Angeles Lakers and sub
sequent released. Currently, he
is trying to make the roster of the
C ioldcn State Warriors.
The Cardinal was also counting
on Brown to help take up the slack
for center John Rcvelli. who also
graduated. Rcvelli averaged MS.2
points per game last season.
I-\cluding Brown. Stanford's Id
returning lettermen averaged a
combined 26 points last season.
I hat total assumes the presence o!
John Pave.
Pave injured a linger on his
right hand in Saturday's 2S-1 ()
football loss against Arizona State.
Stanford, which lied for fifth in
the Pacific Ml Conference in what
manv called a successful season,
probably will be looking up in the
Pae-IO standings at teams like the
I niversitv ol Washington.
Arizona State University and the
I niversitv ol Arizona.
Washington has the West (ier
man duo ol Detlel Schrempl and
Christian Welp returning. The
Huskies also have the dean ol Pae-
IO coaches. Marv Marshman.
Arizona State and Arizona
return a good number ol players
and recruited well.

So efficient was Arizona State's
defense Saturday that the Cardinal
could not rely on its traditional
forte — the pass, which it used to

gain 103 yards. Stanford attemped
2N passes, which is low for the
Cardinal and especially so lor a
team that is behind in the score for
most ol a game.
The Sun Devils' plan was to
bend but not break against Stan
lord's running game and let their
five-player secondary, designed
for the Cardinal, work its magic.
Arizona State's plan for Thomas
Henley, honored recently as
Sports 11 lust rated's Offensive
Player ol the Week, was to assign
All-American safety David I ul
eher to him.
1 ulcher. a sophomore, did his
job. Henley had no receptions and
19 yards rushing. It's no wonder
lulcher is so feared. Me led the
Sun Devils in tackles with I I Sat
urdav and was a terror on the
field."
In the third quarter Saturday. an
interception bv lulcher was
nulltied by a penalty, the second
Arizona State interception to be
negated. On the next play, l ulcher
introduced himsell with a crunch
to Cardinal running back Brad
Muster while Muster was trying to
catch a pass.
These "impact players." who al
ways seem to he around the ball,
making the big plays, are all over
the Pae-10. On Saturday, the Car
dinal offense will go against N'eal
Dcllocono. a LCI A linebacker
named honorable mention All
America last season. Karnmg that
same honor was L'SC linebacker
Jack Del Rio. Washington has
lineman Ron Holmes. Stanford
has linebacker Dave Wyman. who
is underrated.
Another position at which the
Pac-10 is stocked with talent is
kicker, l or example. Arizona
State's Luis /endejas needs two
points to become the National
Collegiate Athletic Association's
sixth-leading scorer.
Another example is LCI.A s
John Lee. who kicked held goals
ol 51. 4Q. 39 and 3b yards Satur
day in the Bruins' 33-lb victory
over Colorado. Add his three ex
tra points, and Lee had a 15-point
effort against the Bulfalos that
made him LCI A s leading scorer
with 215 career points. Lee. a
junior, has not missed in 14 field
goal attempts this season.
