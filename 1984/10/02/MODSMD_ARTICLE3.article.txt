I Km Patrick, 60, was last seen on campus around

to return to work on Sept. I 7 following a two-and-a
half week break. Patrick, a disher at Florence Moore,
lived in a wing adjacent to Stern Hall, along with a
do/en other I ood Service workers, at the time of the
disappearance.
After he failed to pick up two biweekly paychecks.
I loreikc Moore I ood Service Supervisor Barbara
Pierce filed a missing persons report with the Stanford
Police on September 26.
According to Stanford Police Sgt. Philip l.ove.
Patrick's acquaintances recently described him as
"despondent" and in "ill health". Two Florence Moore
residents, who wish to remain unidentified, agree that
Patrick was not well. Both students knew Patrick, who
worked in the dishroom. from their employment with
Food Service.
One student said. "When we would be playing the
radio, and he'd come in. he'd start bopping to the
music, and he'd tell us how he used to go down to Gar
field's and go dancing with the girls. Me was sick a lot
last vcar, and that w as w hen he started being depressed.
It's like life suddenly got hard for him."
I he other student confirmed. "I Km was depressed,
lie was reallv quiet and walked around almost bent
over from being sick a lot."
Pete I lores, a I aisan resident, said lie remembers
Patrick from Ins l ood Service stint two years ago:
"When I was working with him. he was always fairly
liappv. which made the job interesting."
Ilashei John kieraldo. a Palo Alto resident, noted
that the other Food Service employees grew more con
cerned as Patrick continued not to report to work.
"! vcrvbody knew that lie hadn't been here lor the past
few weeks, and they were surprised that he wasn't
around." he said. Kieraldo. who knew Patrick only
slightK. said he had noticed "nothing out o! the ordi
narv" in Patrick's behavior over the summer.
According to l.ove. the California Highway Depart
ment had towed Patrick's abandoned car Irom a north
ern approach to the Golden Gate Bridge on Aug. 2 .
Police then searched his room and found the note.
After speaking with Patrick's best friend and co
workers. l.ove has concluded that the note and
abandoned car probably mean Patrick leaped Irom the
Golden Gate Bridge in a suicide attempt.
"We're treating it as a suicide, although the body has
not been found." I ove said. "We've sent a teletype to
all police departments, coroner's offices and sheritt s
offices in the Bay Area that he is missing and there is a
strong indication that lie is dead. We'd like to think this
is not the case."
l.ove emphasized that the investigation is still open.
"As far as we're concerned." he said, "he (Patrick) is
still missing . . . but we don't believe he's in the area.
Am attempts to look for Patrick's body in the Bay
will have to he made hy agencies with
jurisdiction in the Bay Area, l.ove
said. *"1 don't know it the hody would
ever he found i! it were in the Bav: it
has hecn a month." he said.

Patrick's absence did not surprise his
co-workers, who thought he was on a
vacation in Mexico. "Me was a re
sponsible worker," she said. "And
when he did not call or come in. we
were worried, ( very employee,
however is entitled to privacy, so we
did wait, feeling he would call or send
word . â€¢ . and he didn't."

living in Southern California, has
been notified of the situation.
