## Baez's artistry still touches hearts 
### KAREN MARIE PLATT 
The Joan Baez concert at Frost Amphitheater on Sept.
30 demonstrated that this celebrated '60s folk singer can
still draw a crowd, even if she can't nab a record company
contract. Despite the passage of time and numerous
changes in popular music styles, Baez retains her capacity
to touch hearts and convey to her listeners a personal
sense of her womanhood through moving and melancholy
love songs.
Baez's long-time audience was very much in evidence at
the Sunday afternoon concert: "Survivor's of the
'Sixties," Baez called them. Attired in blue jeans, armed
with blankets, picnic baskets and beach umbrellas, accom
panied by small children, they began arriving shortly after
noon in hopes of gaining the choicest seats for the 2 p.m.
concert.
T he stage was already dressed in white and red drapery
and bunches of party-colored helium balloons hung from
the stage scaffolding, a collection of stage greenery, and
bouquets of wild flowers. Over the P.A. system wafted
pre-concert music by Dan Fogelberg, a favorite of the
featured artist.
Baez appeared on time and unannounced, smiling, clad
in a maize-colored skirt and black blouse, belted in leath
er and heavy Indian silver, shod in Mexican sandals.
Salt-and-pepper hair and a confident air had transformed
her long-time image as a sweet, young Mexican madonna
into warm and wise Mother Joanie.
The concert spanned more than two hours filled with
Baez's personal stories, comedic caricatures, stern and
cynical political comments, and a smattering from 25
years of songs. Accompanied by her own steel-string
acoustic guitar and and a fine pianist, Navarro Hunting
ton, Baez offered some 18 songs plus encores, including
renditions of Dave Loggins' "Please Come to Boston. .
Tina Turner's "Private Dancer" and Billy Joel's
"Goodnight Saigon." Survivors interested in nostalgia
were sustained by Dylan's "It's All Over Now, Baby
Blue" and "May You Stay Forever Young," by "Long
Black Veil," "Diamonds & Rust," Paul McCartney's "Let
It Be," an a cappella "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" and
the timeless, "TTiere But For Fortune."
Baez also performed some of her own, as yet un
recorded material. Among these was what Baez termed a
"song of encouragement.. . for these rather weird '80s."
Called "Warriors of the Sun," the song combined some
slight rock influence with a sentimentalized self-portrait
of and by a well-intentioned generation now feeling older
than its age.
Later in the concert this theme tied in with another,
equally sentimentalitized but more melodic and slightly
more interesting song. "Children of the '80s" portrays
today's youth as "tender as a Lotus and tougher than
stone," as "looking forward to the day that . . . salvation
of the soul of rock & roll." Revealing her concerns as moth

er of a teenage son, Baez said young people should
engage in more socially-oriented (one is tempted to use
words like relevant or meaningful) occupations than video
games and MTV.
As her audience shaded its eyes from the glittering af
ternoon sun, Baez dedicated her next song to all the poli
tical prisoners in Central and Latin America and to the
Sakharovs, then threw her head back and sang, flam
boyant, sincere, in Spanish, as the strong, new fall breeze
tugged at her full skirts.

Among some of her own, as
yet unrecorded material,
was what Baez termed a
'song of encouragement. . .
for these rather weird '80s.'
Called 'Warriors of the
Sun.'

During intermission, she posed and joked for a herd of
amateur photographers and then offered an old-style
Baez vocalization of "Long Black Veil."
Despite the passage of time and her reputation as a po
litical activist, Baez's true artistry still stirs in her love
songs. One new piece stands out. "Fair and Silver
Ladies," a romantic and slightly plaintive love ballad writ
ten for "ladies with silver and resistence in their hair" and
"just an eensy-weensy bit autobiographical". Another
song rendered impeccably by Baez's most expressive style
was "Love Song to a Stranger."
The concert ended with three encores, among them an a
cappella sing-a-long with "Amazing Grace," and a prom
ise from Baez that she would see her audience again at her
50th anniversary concert.
Correction
Last Tuesday, Sept. 25, The Stanford Daily incorrectly
reported that Joan Baez learned to play the ukulele from
Prof. Paul Kirkland, a now-retired Stanford professor
living on Stanford Avenue. The correct name of her teacher
is Prof. Paul Kirkpatrick residing on Santa Teresa Street.
The Daily regrets the error.
