# 'All of Me'-classic comic sharing
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
The earliest collaboration between
Steve Martin and Director Carl
Reiner, "The Jerk" (1979), used up
all its best comic ideas in the first half
hour, but it has become increasingly
evident — from "Dead Men Don't
Wear Plaid" (1982), in which Mar
tin's style shimmered even though the
picture itself was dross, and from last
year's hilarious "Man with Two
Brains," that Reiner can spot the
right material for Martin, and that he
knows how to give him the requisite
1 space. In the single comedy Martin
made without Reiner, "The Lonely
Guy," director Arthur Hiller's
iclunkiness deadened all but a few
scenes — he didn't seem to be getting
the joke — and the overdefined dra-
Imatic structure of every situation
icaged Martin; Charles Grodin, in a
supporting role, walked away with
the picture. (Herbert Ross's musical
drama "Pennies from Heaven," in
which Martin did his most serious,
and his most breathtaking, acting so
far, was another story altogether.)
Reiner's virtues (his sense of humor
and his appreciation for Martin's
gifts) have nothing to do with
moviemaking, actually; he has no vis
ual imagination to match his TV
honed ear for comedy, and he doesn't
employ the camera to make jokes —
in the best scenes in his films, the
performers make the jokes while the
camera sits respectively, taking it all
in. He's like Woody Allen in his
"Bananas" days — well, maybe not
quite that clumsy — or like the direc
tors W.C. Fields worked with in the

1930s and '40s, who were patient,
even reverent hacks. But there are far
worse crimes in movies than provid
ing a format for great comedians to
soar on the wings of explosively
suggestive material. Allen has never
made a funnier movie than
"Bananas," and the late vehicles Ed
ward Cline directed W.C.Fields in,
"The Bank Dick" and "Never Give a
Sucker an Even Break," are classic
comedies. And so, I believe, is "All of
Me," in which Reiner directs Steve
Martin and Lily Tomlin in Phil Alden
Robinson's script (out of a novel by
Ed Davis called "Me Two") about a
wealthy spinster whose soul, when
she expires, leaps into the body of her
lawyer.
If "The Man with Two Brains"
merged parody bits from "Rebecca,"
"Magnificent Obsession" and "Blithe
Spirit," then "All of Me" is like a
wild reversal on "Auntie Mame,"
with the same message — "Life is a
banquet, and most poor sons-of
bitches are starving to death" —
served up in fresh (and blessedly un
self-righteous) ways. Edwina Cut
water (Tomlin), now on the brink of
death, has wasted her years in a
sickbed, friendless, unable (and ter
rified) to plunge into life, but she fig
ures her millions can buy her a second
chance. With the aid of a blissed-out
swami known as the Prahka Lasa
(Richard Libertini), she arranges to
have her soul enter the body of her
stableman's daughter (Victoria Ten
nant), to whom she has willed all her
wealth and who has agreed to donate
her own soul to the universe to pro
vide room for Edwina's. Edwina's

lawyer, Burton Schuyler (Dana El
car), assigns the management of her
estate to his young associate, Roger
Cobb (Martin), who has doubts about
whether to devote his life to law (and
to Schuyler's daughter Peggy, played
by Madolyn Smith) or to jazz, like his
blind saxophonist pal Tyrone (Jason
Bernard).
Robinson has grounded his script
in the lore of pre-World War II com
edy. He starts with an eccentric rich
heroine ("My Man Godfrey,"
"Bringing Up Baby"), equipped with
a loony entourage ("You Can't Take
It with You"), and as the hero, a po
tential life-embracer saddled with a
dull job ("Holiday") and a girl who
doesn't deserve him ("Holiday,"
"The Awful Truth"). Their relation
ship starts out as an adversarial one
("Bringing Up Baby," "The Shop
Around the Corner"). An accident
brings them together: When Edwina
passes out of this life — in the midst
of a rage provoked by Roger's disdain
for her crazy scheme — the urn con
taining her soul happens to tumble
out of a window and hit Roger on the
head. From that point on (at least, for
the. bulk of the movie), Roger's body
houses both his own personality and
that of Edwina's, and until they rec
oncile their dispute and agree to work
together, it is a battleground between
his own masculine impulses
(commanding his left side) and her
resolutely feminine ones (which have
taken over his right side).

Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin are a
match made in heaven. In the first
20 minutes, while they remain sepa
rate entities, each has an opportu
nity to establish a fully thought-out
character.

The mechanism that kept those
earlier comedies in motion was the
electricity between the two stars, and
obviously Robinson's variation,
where the protagonists are literally
two halves of a whole, demands the
most intricate kind of comic sharing.
And Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin
are a match made in heaven. In the
first 20 minutes, while they remain
separate entities, each has an oppor
tunity to establish a fully thought-out
character. Martin accomplishes this
during the credits, with a few physical
strokes— the way he droops over the
desk of his secretary (Selma Dia
mond) or pinches his brow between
thumb and forefinger as he prepares a
brief tells us, with the lightest trace of
parody, that Roger has mastered the
young professional lifestyle down to
its affectations of exhaustion. But
Tomlin really takes the screen, zip
ping across the upper hall of her man
sion in her motorized wheelchair,
summoning her butler via walkie
talkie, sniffing roses and oxygen with
the same aristocratic air of aesthetic
satisfaction and tugging silk handker
chiefs out of a Kleenex dispenser by
her bed. (That dispenser is an in
spired touch.) Lily Tomlin is one of
the best actresses in the country, but
she has had the chance to demon
strate it in only a couple of movies
("Nashville" in 1975 and"The Late

Show" in 1977); she exhibits her
credentials here again by achieving
the nearly impossible — simultane
ously sending up the entire class of
cinematic dowagers and suggesting
the authentic loneliness of a woman
who has confronted the absolute fail
ure of everything valuable in her life.
We understand exactly why Edwina's
obstinacy and hauteur infuriate
Roger, but Tomlin lets us see farther
than Roger does, and we know that
it's just a matter of time before he
recognizes her spirit and her damaged
but undiminished capacity for ex
tending herself past her own ego —
before he realizes, in short, that
they're soulmates. Robinson, of
course, has found the ideal comic
metaphor for the kind of romantic re
lationship that begins in a clash of
egos and ends in perfect harmony: As
long as Roger's and Edwina's souls
engage in combat, Roger's body can
not function properly.
It's only fair that Tomlin dominate
the initial section of "All of Me," be
cause as soon as Edwina becomes
part of Roger, Steve Martin moves
into the center of the movie. From
that point on, we hear Tomlin's voice
when her thoughts quarrel with his,
and we see her whenever he looks
into a mirror, but he has to convey
the struggle of the two personalities
inside Roger. I swear I don't know
how Martin does it, but he physi
calizes the frigid woman inside him
pulling in one direction and the

sexually experienced man inside him
pulling in the opposite direction with
out neglecting the subtly parodic
character detail he's already laid
down or violating Tomlin's comic
style. Yes, this is teamwork, too —
Martin's performance couldn't com
plement Tomlin's so beautifully if
they didn't occupy the same comic
space from the outset of the picture.
But for comparisons to the kind of
delicacy and strategic genius Martin
displays when Roger walks down a
street for the first time with Edwina
inside him or when Edwina's half
wakes Roger's half up, I think you'd
have to go all the way back to
Chaplin. And 1 don't know where
you'd find examples of the layering in
the courtroom scene in which Roger
falls asleep while defending a client in
a divorce case and Edwina has to take
over without giving away the fact that
she's not really Roger. Having played
a man with a woman inside him, and a
man with a woman and a man at war
inside him, Martin proceeds to give us
a man with a woman inside him who's
trying her damnedest to convince
everyone she's a man.
No one has performed as
memorably in a courtroom scene
since "Bananas," but Martin's doing
all the work here (except for Tomlin's
soundtrack comments), because Carl
Reiner doesn't energize the setting in

any way, or most of the other actors.
At best his direction is perfunctory, at
worst miscalculated; he kills a latent
gem of a scene — in which Edwina
spoils Roger's assignation with the
stableman's daughter, Terry — by
staging it badly and allowing it to slip
out of comic rhythm. (The sequence
in which Roger gets his second try
works out much better.) It doesn't
help that Victoria Tennant acts mes
merically, like Trilby waiting for
Svengali to tell her what to do; when
Edwina, scandalized, calls her names
and she responds with what I took for
naughty delight, she doesn't even
make eye contact with Steve Martin.
Tennant's inadequacy is the movie's
major problem, because Robinson
has made Terry an extremely compli
cated character who figures
prominently in the plot changes in the
second half of the film. Tennant looks
lovely in her Jessica Lange hairstyle,
and she does hint at a disturbing gla
cial quality under her spaciness in her
first appearance, but when the com
edy descends on her shoulders, it
becomes more difficult to follow.
(Actually, Robinson fumbles two or
three times in the late sequences, and
Reiner can't rescue him, so you leave

the theater with some unresolved
narrative questions.)
Reiner really should have cast the
supporting players more wisely, or
rehearsed them more thoroughly; the
only bright spots are Selma Diamond,
who sounds like she resides on the
edge of laryngitis, Madolyn Smith, a
moment or two from David Byrd (as
a minister), and the always extraordi
nary Richard Libertini as the loopy
yogi who repeats the butt-ends of the
words other people speak to him and
who floats through the world, stoned

on the least predictable details of
whatever he encounters. (He seems
to see everything through the wrong
end of a telescope.) Jason Bernard
and Dana Elcar, who have significant
parts, don't create much of an im
pression, and one hopes for more
from Edwina's entourage — butler,
doctor and nurse — than one gets.
Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin have to
supply almost all the magic. The plot
requires a number of other characters
to swallow Edwina's soul in the last
half hour, and when that occurs the
movie slips quite a few notches, since
no one else on screen can hope to pull
off a fraction of what Martin has, or
to provide a suitable balance for
Tomlin. The first time Martin looks in
a mirror and sees his own reflection
once again, he does a very touching
double take — he shows us how
deeply Roger feels the loss. And
when, for a short period, Edwina re
enters his body and, looking back at
him from the first mirror he passes,
she smiles warmly and greets him
with "Hi, sailor," you can feel the
relief in the audience — especially
since those mirror encounters furnish
some of the most sparkling examples
of romantic team comedy since Tracy

and Hepburn. At the finish of the
picture, Roger dances with the char
acter who ends up with Edwina's
soul, and Reiner pans to a mirror, so
that what we see is Steve Martin dan
cing with Lily Tomlin, in a joyous,
liberated pas de deux that is both
gently mocking of Astaire and Rogers
and perfectly in tune with them. This
"number," in which the two
performers cannot disguise their
delight in sharing the screen, is an
emblem of what "All of Me" is all
about.


Steve Martin (as Roger Cobb) tries to restrain the accusing finger of Ed
wina Cutwater, whose spirit is trapped in the right side of his body.


Lily Tomlin (as spinster Edwina Cutwater) languishes in luxury as she
schemes to free her spirit from her dying body.
