# Symphony introduces student series

Ask San Francisco Symphony
Operations Director John kieser
which are the best seats in the house
at Dasies Symphony Hall and he'll
give sou an unequivocal answer: up
in the second tier with your hack
against the wall. That's where the
sound comes up from the stage
blended in a was that no stereo can
reproduce. For the pure luxury of the
music, nothing beats the scats at the
top ot the hall with the players seated
tar below, looking as small as in the
pictures ot orchestras on album
ctners.
Mosseser. I like to sit closer to the
musicians. Down in the orchestra, the
plasers seem much more human and
the slight edge of indisidual sound
within each section reminds sou that
the symphony itsell is a svondrousls
tuned instrument which is made up ol
a stage lull ol musicians being
''played' by a single person — the
conductor. I like to look at the or
chestra. I like to ssatch the musicians'
laces, especially alter they have just
finished a piece. And I like to see hoss
enthusiastically the violins ssill
wobble their bows in their customary
show of esteem for guest artists.
The interplay among performers
can produce some surprises. One of
my favorites came during this year's
opening gala svhen conductor Hdo de
Waart leaned down from the podium
to offer l.eonytyne Price an ap
preciative peck on the check. The
majestic soprano subtly withdrew out
of range, extended both her hands
and forced De Waart to step down
from his platform and meet her as his
musical equal.
It takes quite a bit. however. to in
timidate De Waart. In his seven years
ssith the symphony, he has constantly
introduced boldly modern pieces and
insisted that his orchestra of relatively
young musicians play them master
fully. De Waart has not brought on a
full-scale riot as yet. but he came asv
fully close last January when he
allowed Dutchman Louis Andriessen
to stage "Velocity." The work con
sists of three orchestra groups each
pounding out their own tempo. The

result ssas an instant Anacin head
ache for eseryone in the audience
Before the piece ssas over. people
were booing loudly and leasing the
hall to start intermission early. Hut
the lingering effect ol the experiment
ssas to keep the lobby abuzz ssith
opinions and conjectures. The piece
did exactly sshat Andriessen ssanted.
It forced the audience to reconsider
the basic elements of speed and
rhythm which support even the most
lavishly classical pieces that San Fran
cisco audiences lose to hear per
formed.
San Francisco's symphony audi
ence may look diserse when you see
them at intermission crossding
around the lobby bars or lining up for
Irish coffee. People come dressed in
esersthing from bright silk cocktail
dresses and exquisitely conservatise
suits to high punk put-ons. Yet in
spite ot their different costumes,
eseryone seems to agree in their lose
of the classics. And this season. De
Waart is gising his audience sshat
they adore: Vivaldi's "Four
Seasons." Bach's "Magnificat."
Rinisky-Korsakos's "Scheherazade."
Tchaikovsky's "Symphony No. 5."
Wagner's "Siegfried Idyll." and Mus
sorgsky's ■•Pictures at an Exhibition."
Even this past Friday night's pro
gram, which ssas heavily weighted
ssith 20th-century music, ended ssith
Elgar's "Enigma Variations" (1K99).
a piece which is as grand as anything
written in the late Romantic period.
The Nimrod section is often played
alone but De Waart went straight
through the 14 variations without a
pause in order to build to the finale
which ssas augmented by the excit
ingly deep registers of the hall's new
organ.
The Elgar variations were a
surprising contast to the first piece on
the program, Webern's
"Passacaglia." Webern's 190N work
is the last that he wrote for a conven
tional orchestra before he began his
musical experiments that quickly
moved beyond the confines of tradi
tional forms. The "Passacaglia" is es
sentially a series of variations like El
gar's piece. And the thick texture of

the work is also surprisingly similar to
Elgar's. But the 10-year gap between
the two pieces and the light-years he
tsscen the two composers produced
works that are startlingly different.
Elgar's piece seems warmly com
fortable. almost rotundly self
satisfied. But Webern's music seems
to be nervously pushing the edges,
testing the boundaries ol musical pos
sibilities.
The other tsvo pieces on the pro
gram were by Webern's teacher and
colleague, Schoenberg. The
"Concerto for Piano and Orchestra."
Opus 42 was played by
Charles Rosen who filled in for
scheduled soloist Emanuel Ax. The

uive-and-take between the solo piano
and the orchestra is bused on musical
ideas tar too intricate tor anyone to
pick up on first hearing. As usual,
however. Michael Steinberg's exten
sive program notes provided a clear
and concise introduction for those,
like me. who were unfamiliar with the
piece.
Not even Steinberg, however,
could adequately explain the value of
Schoenbcrg's orchestration of Bach's
"Schmucke Dich, () l.iebe Seele."
The hybrid sound that comes from
combining the tones and techniques
of modern orchestration with music
Irom another period is simply odd
rather than appealing. I admit that

such experiments can point out inter
esting differences in performance
practice. The Baroque specialist
seated next to me did give me a tidy
disquisition on the utter incom
patibility of those slow deliberate
ornaments which Bach knew as trills
and the flutter-fast note alternations
that were being done in their name on
stage. But I still prefer Bach as
Baroque as possible, rather than
switched-on or souped-up with
modern trappings.
Although Friday's program
marked the end of the first month of
the regular season, the symphony's
special student series does not begin
