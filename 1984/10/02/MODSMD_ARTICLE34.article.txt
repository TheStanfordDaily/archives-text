# Bay Area a powerful music magnet

### JOHN PHILLIPS 
San Francisco, in addition to breeding diverse and suc
cessful acts — such as The Tubes, The Grateful Dead,
Huey Lewis & the News, The Uptones, The Mutants,
I ranslator, The DK sand Romeo Void — is a very pow
erful music magnet. Every rock act that rises to the top of
the movements in other musical meccas flocks regularly to
I he ( ity. 112 ret no more, natives of Montana, lowa, West
Virginia and my own Florida; live music does not consist
entirely of bad local bands playing bad covers of bad fa
mous bands in bad bars. Don't worry ye paranoid musical
impressarios from Los Angeles or New York or Chicago
or Minneapolis or Austin; the diversity and range of talent
available in your own hometowns isn't unavailable in the
Bay Area.
( ase in point. In early September, I had the opportunity
to see Echo and the Bunnymen, Nick Lowe and Elvis
Costello. In only a handful of locations is such a medley of
popular music virtuosity as close as the box office in the
span of a week.
Despite the timidity of their name, Echo and the Bun
nymen play the most powerful music that I have ever
heard. I heir style is rooted in sixties psychedelia and rep
resentative of the best of the 'XOs "cold wave." Along
with Julian ( ope and the late lan Curtiss, Echo's quirky
lan McC ulloch is acknowledged as a dominant force in
this brooding and introspective musical world. Granted,
his ego is a relatively unbearable combination of
poeticism and pomposity. Moreover, the inaccessibility of
their records, due partly to the absence of an easy to sing
melody in much of their work, also serves to drive away
the listeners. But what a show.
Despite a cold, McC'ulloch directed the band through a
wide selection of their work. His tendency to glorify the
Bunnymen surfaced at only one point, but glaringly so. As
an introduction to "Angels and Devils," from the b-side
of the 12-inch version of the college radio hit "Silver,"
McC'ulloch reminded the crowd that the song was
composed after the band's spring performance at the
Warfield Theater and that "it took us five minutes to write
what it takes other bands years to do."
The Berkeley Community Theater show featured
strobes, the thundering bass of Les Pattinson, drummer

Pete de Freitas" chair breaking in the middle of a song.
Will Sergeant's incessant strum attack of his own guitar,
wonderfully eerie blacklighting and fog, and covers of
songs by The Monkees (' I'm a believer"), the Stones, and
Bowie (a very interesting chorus of "Let's Dance," in
which McCulloch proposed the concept of dancing
"Under the blankets . . . the seeerious blankets") The
show's only flaw may have been a notoriously blatant de
pendence on taped string arrangements during perfor
mances of songs from the most recent, over-criticized
"Ocean Rain" album.
Ah . . . Nick l.owe. The Pope of Pop. The Sultan of
Stiff. The Big Boulder of Rockpile. Now this guy is fun.
Backed by Paul Carrack. Martin Belmont, and Bobby Ir
win — collectively, the Cowboy Outfit — Lowe had the
overflow mob at the first-class Wolfgang's nightclub
juking merrily.
As a headliner in a small club l.owe plays a much more
relaxed, personable and extended set than he does as an
opening act in a larger arena. Fans who are used tofm
rockabilly flavorings and throwaway lines got a great
dose, including "Marie Provost," "Switchboard Susan,"
"Cruel to be Kind." and the Rockpile standard "I Knew
the Bride When She Used to Rock and Roll." The band
was hot and simmered with the experience of Carrack
(Squeeze. Ace) and Belmont (The Rumour. Brinsley
Shwarz). Lowe's voice was as crisp as his accompaniment,
and the audience rejoiced every time that he finished a
song with a broad, mischievous smile and a trademark sa
lute or thumbs-up sign. His ability to personify the posi
tive traits of a rock and roller — carefree attitude, un
restrained personality, a healthy dose of rebellion — with
out exhibiting its excesses or the damnable aspects of the
profession makes him a very endearing figure. Here's a
middle-aged man singing silly songs and playing silly
guitar licks and loving it so much that everybody can't
help but love him loving it.
The night after, Lowe succumbed somewhat to the
drawbacks of opening act syndrome. He only played a
handful of songs, his bass was giving off distorted pops
and required replacement — it seemed as though he was
in a hurry to get to the next club act. Lowe opened the Bill
Graham presentation of Elvis Costello at the Greek
Theater, the best outdoor music venue west of Denver's
Red Rocks.

Many people did not enjoy Elvis's show. I did. Perhaps
it was because this was my first Elvis show. Perhaps it was
because he played my two favorite songs and did not
forsake material from "Trust" and "Imperial Bedroom."
Perhaps I found his unusual arrangements of "Watching
the Detectives" and"The Only Flame in Town" more in
spiring than boorish. Perhaps it was his rapid-fire encore
performance of "Getting Mighty Crowded" and set
ending "Pump it Up" that left me with happy feet and a
smile on my face. Whatever the reasons (and all of the
above are contributing factors). I think that I came to
grips with the Elvis enigma and was therefore not disap
pointedt
You see. since we of the new-wave generation began
crooning "Alison" years ago. and wondering just what
"Less than /ero" is all about. Costello has changed his
tunes. Everyone has their favorite Elvis incarna
tion/incantation, hut too many people are jealous about
their respective favorites. I came away with the feeling
that Costello's performance was most valuable because of
the synergy resultant from his provocative blending of
tempos and styles. The show's detractors criticized the
parts ("I couldn't dance to Clubland." or "The arrange
ment sounded so much better with the TkO Horns") in
stead of enjoying the variety of the whole. No artist can
take as many turns as Elvis has in the last seven years
without owing to a number of musical forms. No one can
pay respects to that spectrum of forms with a. four piece
combo of fine musicians better than Costello did at the
Greek. And whether or not Elvis is wallowing in creative
backwaters, clueless as to what sort of music to play, it
had nothing to do with the quality of his performance. Al
though I didn't see as much of the Costello personality as I
would have liked — his only exchange with the audience
was a somewhat contradictory putdown of MTV. the
cable station which has had several of his videos on heavy
rotation — I loved what I heard.
These three shows involved three different groups
playing three completely different brands of music at three
completely different locations, all within an hour's dis
tance from The Farm. Hence, these words of wisdom:
There's a lot out there, plenty for everybody. Don't limit
yourself to the stack of vinyl which you carted here, and
take advantage of the Bay Area's musical treasures.
