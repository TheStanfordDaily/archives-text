# Kennedy sees science crisis
## 
### 
I he need tor research facilities expansion, renovation
and instrumentation "has greatly reached crisis propor
tions at Stanford and other schools. I niversitv President
Donald kennedy recently told a senior White House ad
visor.
"Undercapitalization is the single biggest threat to our
ability to perform increasingly sophisticated and costly re
search and to train the next generation ot scientists." ken
nedy warned in a Sept. IS letter to Cieorge key worth. sci
ence advisor to President Reagan.
kenned\ went on to say. "There is probablv no private
university in America that can on its own bring its physical
plant and instrumentation to a proper conteniporarv stan
dard." Stanford alone has identified more than $200 mil
lion in science and technology faculty needs.
Based on a survey ot 25 institutions, the National Sci
ence Inundation estimates that research universities and
colleges require 51 .3 billion per year tor five v ears to meet
accumulated capitalization needs. But in fiscal I l 's4. total
lederal investment in research and development at col
leges and universities has been projected at onlv $40 mil
lion. Kennedy said.
University research facility needs "far outstrip the re
sources ot private philanthropy." lie added, but with
direct federal support "matching programs could be
developed that might have significant appeal to donors;"
At keyworth's request, the White House Science
Council has asked a panel headed by David Packard,
chairman ot Hewlett-Packard, and Allan Bromley ot Yale
University to examine ways of enhancing the strength ol
I S. science, kennedy's comments were formulated in
response to their questions.
In the letter, he suggests that paying attention to the
laboratory needs of liberal arts colleges "would pay large
dividends." Faculty and students at these institutions also
could benefit from paid summer programs as visiting
scholars at universities or for laboratory research in their
own institutions.
Lack of graduate fellowships and traineeships. coupled
with the hiuh salaries available in industrv to engineers

without idvanccd degrees, "discourages top American
students from pursuing Ph.D. degrees in several high-tech
fields." kennedy said.
What he calls "modest, coordinated investments" hv
each ot the major mission agencies to produce a balanced
se! ot competitve fellowships tor the most talented stu
dents could reduce this problem.
"Particular attention must be given to the serious un
derrepresentation ot minority students in science and en
gineering graduate programs, kenned) said.
I he chief impediments to fruitful research most often
mentioned by researchers are "insufficient and unstable
funding, and the extremely time-consuming process ol ob
taining research support." kennedy said. Graduate stu
dents and postdoctoral fellows, especially M.D.s. often
elect to go without additional study rather than risk the
uncertainties ot the academic arena.
A former senior consultant to the Office of Science and
Technology Policy in the I ord administration, kennedy
said that "political priorities, which lead to short-term so
lutions rather than support for long-term scientific ad
vances. are reflected in the universities' growing depen
dence on research Irom mission agencies.
