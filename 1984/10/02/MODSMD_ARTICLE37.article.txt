I lie project, recentl\ approved In

ing. hut also such decades-old
structures as the Applied I'hxsics
Building. the Electronics Research
I.ah. the Applied I'hxsics Building,
and the Midi Energx I'hxsics I ah.
Occupants ol the Old Chcmistrx
Building will begin moving into the
nexx structure, dubbed "I'ermal'lex"
In its planners, when it is completed,
possihlx hx the tail ol next xear.
According to Vice I'roxost
Kaxmond Baehetti. xxlio is also co
ordinator ol the project's planning
team. I'ermaflex will proxide "flexible,
icassitinahle space to house programs
tcinporarilx dislocated hx the
redexelopment effort."
I nixersitx Planning Director Phil
Williams said that the nexx huildinu is
tine ot the lirst steps in the renoxation
ol the area known as the Near West
Campus, situated on either side ol the
west end of Sena Street, near the Math
( orner ot the Ouad. According to

Williams, the project's primarx goal is
"the replacement ol obsolete and
loxx-detisitx facilities with ones that
work, in situ. 111 order to maintain
academic affinities and forestall using
up our undeveloped land."
I he planners are hoping to replace
the buildings 111 Near West Campus
piecemeal one or two at a time
to allow academic functions and
growth to continue relatixolx
unimpeded.
I he Old Cliem Building, one ol the
earlx science buildings on campus, is
being replaced because it is
"antiquated, outdated, and not capa
ble ol supporting needed program
changes." according to Asst.
I'roxost \ aleric Vcronin. Because ol
lliis. she said, ii "w ill prohahlx be torn
down at an appropriate future time
and the site uscil in waxs that will en
hance the long-term plan for the
area."
I he new thrce-storx building will
he located on what is now an under
utilised parking lot north of the Or
ganic Chcmistrx Building near
I omita Drive and Roth Wax. I he
parking spaces will he replaced either
hx spaces on a new extension ol Roth
Wax or through expansion ol nearhv
lots. In addition. .1 parking deck is
being planned for that area ol
campus.
I'ermallex will initially house up to
three labs for the Biologx Depart
ment. as main as four labs for ( licmi

cal Engineering and up to seven for
Chemistry.
Once long-term plans — such as a
new biology building and replace
ment of the Old Cliem Huilding —
are completed, however, the space
nuiv be permanent!) assigned to one
of the remaining departments in the
biology chemistry area. Veronin said.
Ihe project will be considered fur
ther In the trustees this month and in
December for confirmation of the
final design. Construction on the
(•»(■».()()0-sc|uare-foot building may
begin as early as tins month, soon
after the trustees meet.
I inancing for the renovations is
still being negotiated, but will in all
likelihood come from a combination
ot direct allocation, debt financing
and donations.
Ihe Near West Campus project
represents not only a major facelift
lor the University, but also a new ap
proach to expansion on campus. As
Project Managei Max Ma/enko told
the University News Service, I'er
niallex "might lead to a new form of
construction at Stanford that
streamlines the review time built into
our current process, creates more
efficiency in the svstems to allow lor
various program changes, and ulti
mately reduces the cost of construc
tion. It successful, this approach to
construction could benefit future
facilities projects at the University in
time. cost, and efficiency of desiun."
