Despite the cancellation of its pro
posed Missing Persons Tubes con
cert. slated lor Oct. (■» in I Tost
Amphitheater. keystone lamily Inc.
appeals to ha\e wedged its way into
the Stanford concert scene alter two
\ears ol dominance by Mill Ciraham
Presents.
Still, the struggle is far from over.
Although keystone seems to ha\e
won the the first round in the fight
with Bill Ciraham because it has
tcntatively billed the CJo (io's tor this
fall. Ciraham is still in the arena and
still wants to produce shows here.
I or now the \SSI Concert Net
work. which works with promoters to
bring shows here, intends to talk to
both promoters.
" I he Concert Network is open to
any promoters." said Director Aaron
Persky. "We can't give exclusive
rights to one. We will talk to different
promoters, and il it works out. we'll
be happy to work with them again.

But that still doesn't mean we have a
year-long commitment with them.
"Naturally, we would like to work
with one or two promoters over the
Near in order to develop a long-term
relationship with them." he said
Damn Seller, vice president ol Bill
Ciraham Presents, said that he cannot
understand the switch in promoters.
"After two vears of successful con
certs at Stanford, including main sell
outs. you would think that xou would
have built an attitude ol positive
goodwill and equity." he said. " You
would expect a relationship to con
tinue if you have cooperative busi
nesses and they are very successful."
Yinnie I rcda. who is with
key stone I amily Management (a
division ol the keystone Family Inc.).
indicated that as the founder ol the
Concert Network and a Stanford
graduate with much experience in
concerts, he sees the "business com
petition between keystone and Bill
Ciraham as something in which

"those organizations can live togcthci
and produce shows in the same
facilities."
"Hither organization could put on a
show at I lost." he explained. " and it
wouldn't be a disaster."
According to Perskv. one ol the
dominant reasons that the Concert
Network chose to go with keystone
for the Oct. ft concert was that
kev stone could offer the network a
low-iisk deal and also include sigmli
eant amounts ol student involvement
in the actual production ol the con
cert. Perskv indicated that these two
factors will play a part in the Concert
Network's luturc decision about
promoters.
" \nv deals tli.it the Concert Net
work makes in the future will include
specific measures to increase student
involvement." he said. " One ot the
Concert Network's goals is student
involvement. We will have a tendency
