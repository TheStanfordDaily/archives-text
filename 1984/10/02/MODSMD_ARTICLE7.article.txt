Congress approves spending bill
WASHINGTON — Congress yesterday approved an emergency
spending hill to keep government offices open through tomorrow while
the Senate remained in .1 legislative quagmire over a civil-rights measure
holding up passage ol long-term funding for the government.
At the same time vesterdav. the Mouse swiltlv approved a bill that
would provide S3ftf> million lot increased security at I S. embassies in
the wake ol the Sept. 20 bombing ol the I S. Embassy annex in Beirut.
Most government agencies were technically without funds to continue
operations when the new fiscal year dawned yesterday at I 2:<) 1 a.m. but
were ordered to stay in business in anticipation of passage of the emer
gencv measure and its signing by President Reagan.
federal workers remain on notice from the Office ol Management and
Budget to continue working as usual unless notified to the contrary.
Ihe emergencv measure will last through midnight tomorrow, a
deadline lived to keep up pressure on the Senate to resolve its stubborn
dispute over the bigger measure, which is designed to last tor the rest ot
the fiscal year.
"It's not much, but it's all we've got. said Senate Majority l eader
Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) as the Senate joined the House 111 approv
ing the stopgap measure after a brief behind-the-scenes dispute over
language inserted bv the House to preclude the administration trom send
ing aid to the Nicaraguan rebels during the three-day period.
The emergency funding was needed because Congress has approved
onlv four ol its 13 regular appropriations bills for the new tiscal year. A
catchall spending bill to fund the remaining agencies got bogged down in
the Senate in the civil-rights dispute, which continued yesterday.
I he dispute involves a bill, already passed by the Mouse, to reverse a
recent Supreme Court decision that narrowed the coverage ol major
anti-discrimination laws.
The legislation's proponents moved to attach it to the catchall money
bill, called .1 continuing resolution, after being frustrated 111 attempts to
get it considered separately. This led to a filibuster by conservatives that
continues despite the Senate's y2-to-4 vote Saturday to invoke cloture
and thereby limit debate.
Soviet grain harvest to fall
MOSCOW — The Soviet grain harvest now being completed will be
down about 25 percent or more trom Kremlin projections. Western
agricultural experts said yesterday.
They said bad weather — including drought in some areas and too
much rain in others — was the principal reason for the dramatic shortfall
in this year's crop. But a number ot other factors under human control,
such as a shortage ot fertilizer. machinery breakdowns and waste due to
poor storage conditions, contributed to the poor showing.
The I S. Department of Agriculture has estimated the Soviet grain
crop at 175 million tons this year, compared to the Soviet government's
g<ml ot n 240-million-lon harvest. As u result, the Western experts, who
spoke 011 the condition they not be identified, said, the Soviet Union
may decide to import 4fi million tons ol grain in the buying year that
began last June, matching its record foreign purchases ol grain in I
I he Soviet grain-buying has started already, with the United States
alone having sold more than 14 million tons to Moscow in the past year.
Another 25 million tons is likely to be bought trom the Lnited States.
Canada. Australia and Argentina, the leading grain producers.
U.S. criticizes endorsement
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration yesterday called
Nicaragua's endorsement of a proposed Central America peace treaty
"a propaganda ploy" and said the treaty provisions, as they now stand,
cannot bring peace and security to the region.
At a briefing to explain the I S. position, a senior State Department
official said the United States is urging its Central American allies — El
Salvador. Honduras and Costa Rica — not to reject the proposed pact
but to strengthen its provisions in ways that will genuinely limit the size
ol regional military forces and restrict military activities by countries
outside the area.
"We are looking for a document that will bring peace and security to
the region and not just a propaganda ploy." said the official, who cannot
be identified under the rules ot the briefing.
At issue is the comprehensive treaty proposed last month by the Con
tadora group — Mexico. Colombia. Venezuela and Panama — that has
been trving to mediate a peaceful resolution ol the tensions between the
leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua and the other Central Ameri
can countries.
Two weeks ago. Nicaragua unexpectedly agreed to sign the latest draft
ot the treatv. and the other countries followed with unofficial expres
sions of support. That allowed Nicaragua to cast itself as a peacemaker
and diverted attention from a growing debate about whether
Nicaragua's presidential elections, scheduled for Nov. 4. will be demo
cratic.
It also created difficulties for the administration, which has publicly
supported the idea of solving the Central America crisis within the C'on
tadora framework and which had insisted that Nicaragua was trying to
block progress toward a treaty.
However, it has become clear in recent days that the United States is
pressing its three Central American allies to demand changes in the
treatv text. That has exposed the United States to charges that it never
real Iv meant to support Contadora and is not really interested in accom
modation with Nicaragua.
