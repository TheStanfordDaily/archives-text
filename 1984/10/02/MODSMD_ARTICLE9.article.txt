# Court to rule on 'gay rights'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Supreme
Court, agreeing for the first time 111
nearly two decades to decide a "gav
rights" case, announced yesterday it
would rule whether the Constitution
permits local public school boards to
fire teachers for advocating
homosexual aetiv ity.
I'he justices, opening their new
1 1 >N4 term by acting on more than
1.000 cases, said 111 a brief order that
they would review an Oklahoma law
that was overturned by a federal ap
pellate court as a v lolation of the right
of free expression by teachers.
In recent years, the Supreme Court
has sidestepped a number ol opportu
nities for review of homosexual rights
claims. The hist time the justices
ruled on the issue was when
they held the government could law
fully deport aliens found to be
homosexuals. Since then, the court
has declined to issue opinions 111 cases
involving such issues as barring
homosexuals Irom the armed
serv ices, colfejie refusal ol recount
tion to gay rights student groups, un
lawful solicitation of homosexual ac
tivity and denial of Boy Scout mem
bership for homosexuals.

The court's announcement yester
day was unexpected by lawyers lor
gay rights groups. "I was ureal I \
surprised." Leonard Graff o! San
I rancisvo. attorney tor National Gay
Rights Advocates, said. "The court
had been avoiding this issue lor a long
time."
In another ruling yesterday.the
C ourt rejected an appeal from locs ol
the equal rights amendment who
sought to prevent the California
Commission on the Status ol Women
Irom lobbying for what they called
"radical feminist" ideological causes.
Citing a lack ol federal jurisdiction,
the justices let stand a California
Court ol Appeal ruling that enabled
the commission to take public stands
on the KRA. abortion, equal pay and
other political issues. The state ap
pellate court last February over
turned a lower court injunction limit
ing the commission to presenting
neutral factual information on such
issues to state agencies.
The Supreme Court's action
brought an end to an eight-year legal
battle waged by a coalition ol anti-
HRA and anti-abortion groups called
the Women's Committee for Respon

sible (iovernmeiit. led by Rita Millei
r ol Colton. ( alii.

Court, agreeing for the first time 111
nearly two decades to decide a "gav
rights" case, announced yesterday it
would rule whether the Constitution
permits local public school boards to
fire teachers for advocating
homosexual aetiv ity.
I'he justices, opening their new
1 1 >N4 term by acting on more than
1.000 cases, said 111 a brief order that
they would review an Oklahoma law
that was overturned by a federal ap
pellate court as a v lolation of the right
of free expression by teachers.
In recent years, the Supreme Court
has sidestepped a number ol opportu
nities for review of homosexual rights
claims. The hist time the justices
ruled on the issue was when
they held the government could law
fully deport aliens found to be
homosexuals. Since then, the court
has declined to issue opinions 111 cases
involving such issues as barring
homosexuals Irom the armed
serv ices, colfejie refusal ol recount
tion to gay rights student groups, un
lawful solicitation of homosexual ac
tivity and denial of Boy Scout mem
bership for homosexuals.

The court's announcement yester
day was unexpected by lawyers lor
gay rights groups. "I was ureal I \
surprised." Leonard Graff o! San
I rancisvo. attorney tor National Gay
Rights Advocates, said. "The court
had been avoiding this issue lor a long
time."
In another ruling yesterday.the
C ourt rejected an appeal from locs ol
the equal rights amendment who
sought to prevent the California
Commission on the Status ol Women
Irom lobbying for what they called
"radical feminist" ideological causes.
Citing a lack ol federal jurisdiction,
the justices let stand a California
Court ol Appeal ruling that enabled
the commission to take public stands
on the KRA. abortion, equal pay and
other political issues. The state ap
pellate court last February over
turned a lower court injunction limit
ing the commission to presenting
neutral factual information on such
issues to state agencies.
The Supreme Court's action
brought an end to an eight-year legal
battle waged by a coalition ol anti-
HRA and anti-abortion groups called
the Women's Committee for Respon

sible (iovernmeiit. led by Rita Millei
r ol Colton. ( alii.
In still other rulings yesterday, the
i justices also reluscd to icview .1 pcti
, lion by Rhode Island authorities

: Claus \ on Billow's conviction on
charges ol trying to murder Ins
wcalthv wife and agreed to review a
j novel conflict between religious
beliefs and the states' authority to re

I In the Oklahoma schools case,
(irafl conceded that the justices
might well uphold the lavs at issue but
noted also that thus far. most gay
| rights legal victories 111 lower courts
had been 111 cases raising I irst
| Amendment claims of free speech.
The Oklahoma law authorizes
school boards to dismiss teachers lor
public statements "advocating, en
couraging or promoting" homosexual
activity when there is a "substantial
risk" that such statements will be
1 Wrought to the attention of students
ur school personnel.
I he I : .S. 10th ( ircuit ( ourt ol Ap
peals in Denver struck down the law
as a violation ol a teacher's riylit to

five expression. While il would lv
permissible to lire teaehers for
homosexual activity itself, that court
sakl. the Constitution protected the
riiilit to advocate even illegal conduct
unless it would immediate!) incite
law lessness.
I he appellate court, in a 2-1 deci
sion. said that the Oklahoma law was
constitutional!) invalid on its lace be
cause it could he invoked il a teacher
merely appeared before the
legislature or on television to ume
repeal ol the state's anti-sodomv
statutes or in support of other gav
rights causes. Onlv when a teacher's
statements result in a "substantial'"
disruption ol school activities could
the) be curtailed by authorities, the
court said.
Hie Oklahoma City Hoard of l .ilu
eation sought review ol the appellate
ruling In the Supreme Court, arguing
that schools should be free to impose
reasonable limits on public state
ments by teachers — and that the ap
peals court had gone too far in recog
nizing a free-speech right to advocate
sodomy.
