# Majors plans change little
## Frosh poll tells all

Freshman Fidelia Butt will not consider any
concentration of study at Stanford but natural
sciences.
"I decided I wanted to be a doctor in junior
high," she said. "It's always been what I've
wanted to do. I see that as my purpose, and the
only way that I can help a lot of people."
A recent survey on academic interests of
freshmen indicated that 36 percent of this year's
freshmen intend to join Butt as natural science
majors here. The survey, which reflects the pre
liminary interests of freshmen, found more stu
dents choosing the natural sciences than any
other area of study, followed by 29 percent in
social sciences, 23 percent in engineering and
12 percent in humanities. These figures are all
within one percent of last year's pe.centages.
Among women, interest in engineering fell
from 15 to 11 percent, while among men it rose
from 30 to 32 percent. Flumanities attracted
more women this year than last, rising from 17
to 19 percent. Men's interest in the subject fell
from 8 to 7 percent. In social sciences, women's
interest rose from 30 to 33 percent. No change
was noted in men's commitment to this area.
Carolyn Lougee, dean of Humanities and
Sciences, said there has been a small but steady
increase in the number of students declaring a
preliminary interest in engineering, while pre
medical declarations may be decreasing. But
Lougee emphasized that these indications are
only preliminary ones.
"There is a very significant shift after the pre
liminary declarations," she said. "Many more
students end up in the humanities than think
they will, and fewer finish in the natural sciences
and the pre-med program."
A majority of freshmen attribute their
choices of academic study to career ambitions.
"The technical fields are much more lucrative
and have less idealization than other fields,"

said Robin Vasan, a prospective engineering
major. "I could never see myself going into any
other area."
Many freshmen are straightforward about
their preprofessional attitudes.
"Of course making money is in the back of
my mind," said Bernard Silva. "Face it, we're
all here to make money. Now I've said it. We're
all thinking it."
But other freshmen, like Jenny Schlee, do not
have specific career or major plans.
"I'm indecisive about a major," she said. "If I
had stayed in England I would have had to
decide. My purpose here for the first couple of
years is to try everything and find what I am
most interested in."
According to Lougee, freshmen this year
seem interested in keeping their options open.
"I think it's fairly clear that students in recent
years are more professionally oriented than in
earlier years," she said. "This freshman class
seems to be less oriented professionally,
however, and more open to options in the
choice of classes. Students seem much more
open to say that they are looking before they
decide. When they decide, two years from now,
most of them will decide on a major which will
be connected to their career."
As in past years, a large number of freshmen
have indicated an interest in the pre-med pro
gram. But several of these students expressed
the intention to major in a subject unrelated to
medicine. The main reason cited for this deci
sion is a desire to be well-rounded — both for
personal gratification and to bolster transcripts
for medical school admission.
Students choosing majors generally tend to
be influenced by their parents. Members of the
Class of 1988 seem no exception.
For some, this decision is a conscious one.
Others say the correlation is solely coincidental.
