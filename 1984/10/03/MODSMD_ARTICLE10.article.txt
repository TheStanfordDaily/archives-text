## The 						Stanford Daily Knowledge is good 
### 
f-rom the more Gothic and somber Eastern in
stitutions with which we are often compared, the
view is that Stanford is a little happy-go-lucky -
academically intense enough, but intellectually a
bit lazy, as though somewhat addled by the sun.
1 wo weeks ago, University President Donald
Kennedy advised freshmen to reject anti
intellectualism during their years here. His
message deserves repetition.
The sad truth is that too many Stanford stu
dents would rather spend $70 on Vuarnets than
on a subscription to a daily newspaper. Too many
dormitory discussions concern intramural volley
ball rather than important issues of the day. And
too many course readings and lectures fail to
spark the debate they merit.
Remember that in choosing to come to a univer
sity like Stanford, you have already made a signifi
cant commitment to the life of the mind. That life
cannot readily be compartmentalized - divided
into watertight areas, one consisting of classroom
life and the other consisting of real life - one that
you leave behind at the library door or at the edge
of the Quad to take up another in the dormitory.
The double-edged sword threatening Stanford
is students' desire to shun intellectualism and to
favor preprofessionalism.
Conscious anti-intellectualism pervades the

campus; many students simply don't think it cool
to show interest in matters of great consequence.
What is cool is clearing the path to fortune.
Too often, academic rigor among undergradu
ates here seems more a result of grade
consciousness than of actual interest in course
topics. Learning loses its importance as students
feel the need to fill out their resumes and bolster
their transcripts for personal advancement.
If it is out of bounds at the dinner table to talk
about what the Western Culture lecture said about
Locke, or what is meant by biological deter
minism, then it will be equally unacceptable to say
what you think about the next election, or the
prospect of nuclear winter, or the Moral Majority,
or discrimination in America. For if seriousness
becomes a casualty of student discourse on this
campus, then surely controversy will also; and that
will impoverish us all.
The primary purpose of a university, lest Stan
ford's plethora of pragmatic preprofessionals for
get, is still to promote what John Henry Cardinal
Newman called "the disciplined intellect," at
tainable through a liberal education rather than
through provincial technical training.
Knowledge is beautiful, and the sharing of
ideas is one of life's greatest joys. No harm can
come from participation in meaningful discourse.
