## Democrats personify dreams of equality 
### 
Walter Mondale is a tub of butter: bland,
thick and unexciting. He would melt on a
summer afternoon in Bullhead City, Ariz.,
and perhaps the residents would enjoy watch
ing him, but this spectacular feat is the extent
of his charisma. It is a shame that politics is so

VIEWPOINT

often a game of appearances rather than a test
of ideas, but demeanor and presence are vital
to the communication of a president's many
roles. Mondale whines and wheezes his way
through editorials. He cannot spark America,
and consequently, Fritz will probably not
direct us to the new and unseen generation of
morality and concern.
If President Reagan wins the November
election, however, all will not be lost for the
Democratic Party or for the United States.
The 1984 campaign has strengthened our
awareness of the struggle for civil rights. Jesse
Jackson, the first black presidential candidate
for a major party, demonstrated his dedica
tion to the people — all people. He mounted
unprecedented voter registration drives, striv
ing to unite an America of the people, for the
people, and by the people. He demanded
federal denunciation of South Africa's apar

theid government. He freed political
prisoners from Cuba and Lebanon. He
criticized Reagan's anti-affirmative action
measures. He inveighed against the presi
dent's comments that no child starves in
America and that ketchup is a suitable
vegetable for school lunches. He condemned
Reagan's war race: the profligate defense
spending coupled with an insane, uncom
promising attitude toward nuclear deterrence.
Jackson cried out against inhuman injustice
everywhere, and he proved a viable and moral
candidate.
As the first woman vice-presidential
nominee for a major party, Geraldine Ferraro
captured Jackson's eye-stopping spotlight
after the Democratic National Convention.
She was criticized for her lack of experience,
and harried over her financial records, but
Ferraro has managed her jWition well. She's
witty, straightforward and vivacious. She is
quick to admit her mistakes and even quicker
to learn from them. She does not avoid the is
sues. Her spunk and candor have won her far
reaching admiration, making her a candidate
for today and tomorrow.
Tomorrow may not free us from Reagan's
reign, but today is today. The presence of

Jackson and Ferraro has inched us closer to
the dream of equality, supposedly the truest
American dream. Racism in the United States
has existed for a very long time; it is a con
venient convention, a disease difficult to cure.
But perceptions change with new angles.
According to "Psychology and Life" by Psy
chology Prof. Philip Zimbardo, a third-grade
teacher told her students that those who had
brown eyes were superior to their peers. The
children immediately formed cliques, the
brown-eyes dominating everyone and excell
ing in all of their activities. Brown-eyes were
never at fault.
The scapegoats' self-respect, attitudes and
performances, on the other hand,
deteriorated. The victims drew pictures of
large black clouds pressing down on them
selves, and they described themselves as sad,
bad and stupid. On the following day, the
teacher told her class that she had made a ter
rible mistake. Blue-eyed students, in fact,
were superior to everyone, not brown-eyed
students. The group hierarchy changed as the
new blue-eyed powerbrokers gained control.
The brown-eyes, reminded again and again of
their inferiority by the social structure and the
social attitues, resigned themselves to their

second-class status, their inferior dreams. On
the third day, the teacher called her class to
gether and told the students that she had been
terribly mistaken again. Everyone, in fact, is
equal: Integrity and ability are neither color
specific nor sex-determined. The children
cheered, relieved that there were no restric
tions to friendship.
Eliminating the bias in the United States is
not as easy as it was in the classroom. We are
not as innocent and impressionable as nine
year-olds. Built-in social prejudice has shaped
our perspectives, and our attitudes are slow to
change. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had to
march and speak and sit in jails before the
public would notice or even consider his
plaints.
And when minorities were finally allowed
to share bathrooms and buses with whites, the
fogies roared because that was not the way it
had been. When women abandoned spoons
and washboards and joined the work force,
demanding equal pay for equal work, the
fogies roared because that was not the way it
had been. When women and blacks and
Hispanics vied for political offices, the fogies
sweated, puffed and squirmed. But as
minorities prove their abilities and demon

strate their intellect and integrity, dissent
wanes. Equality, a fact that should have been
evident when man first breathed life, is finally
being unearthed in the conservative mind.
Today, Tom Bradley, Dianne Feinstein,
Andrew Young, Harold Washington and
Henry Cisneros lead our cities to tomorrow.
For the first time, a major party has featured
two minorities in the biggest political arena of
them all. Jackson and Ferraro have aspired to
the two highest offices in the United States;
they have sent quivers through the cold,
crusty establishment. Though Jackson did not
win his position and Ferraro may not clinch
her victory, they have broken through layers
of historical lies. We shall see more and more
prospects as the years progress. The White
House will not always be white, nor will it al
ways be manned by men.
It is criminal that politics is still a game of
appearances, but ideas and actions will one
day come to the fore, not to the slant. The
public will recognize Mondale and politicians
like him as humanitarians who dream for and
with America, not as ineffective bleeding
hearts. All is not lost for the United States; it
is just being uncovered.

bad and stupid. On the following day, the
teacher told her class that she had made a ter
rible mistake. Blue-eyed students, in fact,
were superior to everyone, not brown-eyed
students. The group hierarchy changed as the
new blue-eyed powerbrokers gained control.
The brown-eyes, reminded again and again of
their inferiority by the social structure and the
social attitues, resigned themselves to their

second-class status, their inferior dreams. On
the third day, the teacher called her class to
gether and told the students that she had been
terribly mistaken again. Everyone, in fact, is
equal: Integrity and ability are neither color
specific nor sex-determined. The children
cheered, relieved that there were no restric
tions to friendship.
Eliminating the bias in the United States is
not as easy as it was in the classroom. We are
not as innocent and impressionable as nine
year-olds. Built-in social prejudice has shaped
our perspectives, and our attitudes are slow to
change. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had to
march and speak and sit in jails before the
public would notice or even consider his
plaints.
And when minorities were finally allowed
to share bathrooms and buses with whites, the
fogies roared because that was not the way it
had been. When women abandoned spoons
and washboards and joined the work force,
demanding equal pay for equal work, the
fogies roared because that was not the way it
had been. When women and blacks and
Hispanics vied for political offices, the fogies
sweated, puffed and squirmed. But as
minorities prove their abilities and demon

strate their intellect and integrity, dissent
wanes. Equality, a fact that should have been
evident when man first breathed life, is finally
being unearthed in the conservative mind.
Today, Tom Bradley, Dianne Feinstein,
Andrew Young, Harold Washington and
Henry Cisneros lead our cities to tomorrow.
For the first time, a major party has featured
two minorities in the biggest political arena of
them all. Jackson and Ferraro have aspired to
the two highest offices in the United States;
they have sent quivers through the cold,
crusty establishment. Though Jackson did not
win his position and Ferraro may not clinch
her victory, they have broken through layers
of historical lies. We shall see more and more
prospects as the years progress. The White
House will not always be white, nor will it al
ways be manned by men.
It is criminal that politics is still a game of
appearances, but ideas and actions will one
day come to the fore, not to the slant. The
public will recognize Mondale and politicians
like him as humanitarians who dream for and
with America, not as ineffective bleeding
hearts. All is not lost for the United States; it
is just being uncovered.
(Dixon Osburn is an undeclared sophomore.)
Walter Mondale is a tub of butter: bland,
thick and unexciting. He would melt on a
summer afternoon in Bullhead City, Ariz.,
and perhaps the residents would enjoy watch
ing him, but this spectacular feat is the extent
of his charisma. It is a shame that politics is so

VIEWPOINT

often a game of appearances rather than a test
of ideas, but demeanor and presence are vital
to the communication of a president's many
roles. Mondale whines and wheezes his way
through editorials. He cannot spark America,
and consequently, Fritz will probably not
direct us to the new and unseen generation of
morality and concern.
If President Reagan wins the November
election, however, all will not be lost for the
Democratic Party or for the United States.
The 1984 campaign has strengthened our
awareness of the struggle for civil rights. Jesse
Jackson, the first black presidential candidate
for a major party, demonstrated his dedica
tion to the people — all people. He mounted
unprecedented voter registration drives, striv
ing to unite an America of the people, for the
people, and by the people. He demanded
federal denunciation of South Africa's apar

theid government. He freed political
prisoners from Cuba and Lebanon. He
criticized Reagan's anti-affirmative action
measures. He inveighed against the presi
dent's comments that no child starves in
America and that ketchup is a suitable
vegetable for school lunches. He condemned
Reagan's war race: the profligate defense
spending coupled with an insane, uncom
promising attitude toward nuclear deterrence.
Jackson cried out against inhuman injustice
everywhere, and he proved a viable and moral
candidate.
As the first woman vice-presidential
nominee for a major party, Geraldine Ferraro
captured Jackson's eye-stopping spotlight
after the Democratic National Convention.
She was criticized for her lack of experience,
and harried over her financial records, but
Ferraro has managed her jWition well. She's
witty, straightforward and vivacious. She is
quick to admit her mistakes and even quicker
to learn from them. She does not avoid the is
sues. Her spunk and candor have won her far
reaching admiration, making her a candidate
for today and tomorrow.
Tomorrow may not free us from Reagan's
reign, but today is today. The presence of

Jackson and Ferraro has inched us closer to
the dream of equality, supposedly the truest
American dream. Racism in the United States
has existed for a very long time; it is a con
venient convention, a disease difficult to cure.
But perceptions change with new angles.
According to "Psychology and Life" by Psy
chology Prof. Philip Zimbardo, a third-grade
teacher told her students that those who had
brown eyes were superior to their peers. The
children immediately formed cliques, the
brown-eyes dominating everyone and excell
ing in all of their activities. Brown-eyes were
never at fault.
The scapegoats' self-respect, attitudes and
performances, on the other hand,
deteriorated. The victims drew pictures of
large black clouds pressing down on them
selves, and they described themselves as sad,
bad and stupid. On the following day, the
teacher told her class that she had made a ter
rible mistake. Blue-eyed students, in fact,
were superior to everyone, not brown-eyed
