Credulity strained
A nice thing about a Stanford
liberal arts education is that it allows
a physics major to write an enter
taining opinions column on econom
ics.
Loren Borud (The Daily, Sept. 27)
claims that tax rates are steeply
progressive. In fact, effective tax
rates range from 0 to 26 percent
over the income distribution. The
average effective tax rate for persons
earning over $1 million annually is
23 percent. When items such as
unrealized capital gains and housing
services are imputed to income,

effective tax rates range from 0 to 12
percent of income. Finally, the total
burden of federal, state and local
taxes is nearly uniform across the
income distribution.
Keynsian macro-economists have
gotten a lot of bad press in the last
few years. However, it's outrageous
to claim, as Borud did, that Keyn
sians believed that the fiscal policy
undertaken in 1981 would reduce
aggregate demand in the economy.
The result of the 23 percent reduc
tion in taxes coupled with a 13 per
cent real increase in defense
spending was exactly what conven-

tional theory suggested. Extremely
loose fiscal policy collided with ex--
tremely restrictive monetary policy
and produced record-high interest
rates. These interest rates drove the
Reagan recession.
It strains credulity to believe, as
Borud suggests, that reductions in
tax rates will increase tax receipts.
President Reagan has enacted
roughly $210 billion in tax reduc
tions. During this period, budget
deficits have risen from $27 billion
to 1979 to a projected $200 billion
deficit in 1985. It is widely agreed
that the "supply side" cuts did not
pay for themselves.

Despite claims to the contrary, the
Reagan administration has not vind
icated "supply-side" economics. We
clobbered the economy, then
endured the worst recession since the
19305. We're now having a well
timed, but fairly normal, recovery.
Budget deficits are likely to cause
some problems in the later stages of
the recovery. Real interest rates are
currently far too high and should be
regarded as a signal that the eco
nomy is not yet in wonderful shape.
The important point is that this is
what conventional theory suggested
would happen given the extreme
fiscal and monetary policies followed

in the last three years.

Houseboats anyone?
In yesterday's Daily (Oct. 2),
Rodger Whitney, director of
housing, is quoted as saying that the
off-campus housing market in this
area is tight because "we're on a
landlocked peninsula."
Intrigued by this remark, I have
searched through my maps of Cali
fornia, but I have been unable to
find any landlocked peninsulas.
Housing certainly is tight around

here. But, perhaps the reason Whit
ney has been unable to find any is
that he has been looking in San
Francisco Bay, which is landlocked.
