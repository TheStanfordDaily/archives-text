## Discrimination in the draw system 
### 
For grade schoolers, returning to school means
bright new lunchboxes, unused pink erasers and a
new teacher. Beginning the year at Stanford brings
to mind different, yet just as vivid, images of foot
ball games, all night talks and Domino's pizzas.
But, even as many students are now living these

VIEWPOINT

images, others are more preoccupied with less than
expected living arrangements and recurring flash
backs to the day they received their draw numbers.
A lot of people would rather let sleeping Draws lie.
But as we return to campus, unpack our boxes and
move into our new residences, now seems like an
appropriate time to review and question the
process of the Draw.
Supposedly, everyone enters the Draw with the
same housing opportunity, and the outcome is
based solely on luck. Yet, this is not the case. For
one thing, those established in a house are
guaranteed returning residence priority for the fol
lowing year. Although everyone is granted this
privilege, it creates a situation in which preferred
houses are monopolized. The current draw system
promotes those who have drawn well to the
housing elite, above the hand of luck and secure in
next year's fate. Meanwhile, the rest of us will once
again be reduced to four leaf clovers and rabbit's
feet as we journey to Old Union next April in our
quest for a sub-thousand draw number.
Inequality doesn't end there, for the Draw also
discriminates between the sexes. Fraternities
supply 12 housing opportunities to men. In con
trast, sororities have no on-campus housing, and
Roth Flouse is the only all female housing unit at

Stanford. The availability of 11 more choices for
men than women puts women at a distinct disad
vantage in the housing situation.
There must exist a better way to run the Draw.
To begin with, the discrimination involved in
priority for returning residents and more housing
options for men should be eliminated. Yet, even
with these changes, it is possible to draw 3,000 or
more at each Draw and to be condemned to low
preference housing each guaranteed housing year.
It seems that a fairer system might be employed if
priority were given according to class with seniors
having the highest priority. For example, seniors
could be assigned the first thousand draw numbers,
juniors the second and sophomores the third. The
luck of the Draw would still ensure equality within
the classes, but the class priorities would let stu
dents enjoy one of their top housing choices during
their Stanford education.
From the high school seniors, just now sending
away for applications, to those of us already here,
many people are seeking the "Stanford experi
ence." Yet, the much touted experience is not lim
ited only to the academic and social opportunities
to be found at Stanford. The place to which we
return after classes is also a large part of our life
and our education. Unfortunately, while some of us
make our home in a castle, others are to be found
in the dungeon. It is only fair that each of us have
the same housing opportunity during our time at
Stanford. That is why the Draw is neither a trivial
pursuit nor a game; instead, it is an outdated sys
tem that must be changed.
