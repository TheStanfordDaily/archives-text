# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

Politics and a lack thereof at (JSC
Walter Mondale may never turn his back on a Trojan again.
Speaking in front of Tommy Trojan at the conservative University of
Southern California on Sept. 21, Mondale was stabbed in the back.
Students carrying pro-Reagan banners picketed the speech and hecklers
repeatedly interrupted Mondale with pro-Reagan slogans and cries of
"bullshit" to his criticisms of Reagan's policies.
USC President James Zumberge publically scolded the hecklers, saying
the incident "brings embarassment at best and disgrace at worst to our uni
versity." The Student Senate joined in and noted that the student hecklers
"ignored the educational aspect" of Mondale's speech by interrupting it.
A spokesman for the Mondale-Ferraro campaign in California held a
press conference and demanded a formal apology from the Reagan-Bush
campaign.
Although the Reagan-Bush campaign admitted to organizing "a display
of support," it denied any wrongdoing.
The Daily Trojan reported that members of the Reagan campaign used
the house of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity — Reagan's fraternity from
his days at Eureka College — to make signs and banners, and that one TKE
member told the Los Angeles Times that Reagan-Bush campaign workers
positioned fraternity members at the speech to give them media exposure.
Mondale's speaking at USC was almost an accident. While on a trip to
Southern California, Mondale wanted to speak to students at a university in
session. USC happened to be in session and along the route to another cam
paign stop, so he selected a campus described as "pro-Reagan" by Jim
Dutra, the California press spokesman for the Reagan-Bush campaign.

One writer for the Daily Trojan's opinions page said that seeing USC stu
dents engaged in "finger-pointing, scream-in-the-face" debate made the
disturbance worthwhile.
"It was quite a spectacle," he wrote. The last time he could recall hearing
political debate at USC was two years ago when Tom Metzger, the former
Grand Dragon of the California Ku Klux Klan, spoke to a journalism class.
But, he went on to lament, "It will probably be another two years before
you see it again."
How prophetic. "Five students demonstrate following embassy bomb
ing," read a front page headline three days later.

Cold cash for cool catalogs
The University of Texas is this week's news hot-spot.
The Daily Texan reports that the university has taken to selling course
catalogs in vending machines.
So far, the student reaction seems positive.
The machines, which have refrigerators that have been turned off, have
been "virtually selling out on weekends," according to UTs registrar.
The machines, operative only after regular office hours, require students
to pay $1 for an undergraduate catalog and $2 for a graduate catalog.
In addition, curious students have been crowding the machines because
they've never seen catalogs in vending machines, the registrar reports. Cor
nell and Texas are the only two universities in the nation to sell the catalogs
in the machines, he added.
"The vending machine company couldn't believe that we wanted to sell
catalogs and not food," said the registrar.
Hard to believe.

Summer, it turns you upside down
You thought your summer job was tough, huh?
Some students from the University of Texas would probably disagree.
About forty UT students were enticed into selling student reference
books door-to-door with the promise of a summer of travel, experience and
profit.
Well, they got experience anyway.
To begin the travel aspect, students first had to travel to Nashville, Tenn.,
at their own expense for a week of sales instruction. They did not find out
until the final days of training in which city they would be selling. And,
upon arriving at their designated city, many students found that the lists of
available apartments that they had been given were outdated.
One student told of randomly knocking on doors outside Indianapolis,
Ind., at 10 p.m., in search of a room for rent.
The money promised also proved hard to come by. The students put in
80-hour work weeks and were encouraged to forego work breaks and to eat
from the handouts of customers.
One student left after only a month, having pocketed a meager $100.
Another student said that customers set their dogs on him while a third
claimed to know a salesman who was punched in the face by a potential cus
tomer.
Recruiters also advertised the availability of a unit of college credit for
the siirp.mer salesmen.
No free lunches here, though. Upon their return, students found that the
unit could only be had for a $100 fee.
