## Abortion issue hits home on the Farm 
### AMY BIRD 
"Someone! Where can I get an
abortion? I'm so scared. Please help."
This quote comes from the middle
stall of the women's bathroom on the
second floor of Meyer Library. As
you might expect, most of the com
ments around it don't respond to the
concerns it expresses. Instead, they
showcase the opinions of infinitely
wise Stanford students.
Abortion is a hot issue these days
and many people have very strong
opinions about it. But sometimes
people must step back from the
picket line positions for a moment.
It's here in this nebulous ground be
tween polarized camps that most
couples must make their decisions
about an unplanned pregnancy. It's
here that they must come to terms
with what abortion means to them.
And it's from here, perhaps, that
one can respond to the advice at
Meyer, "Go to Cowell."
Cowell Student Health Center's
services include free pregnancy tests
and counseling. The staff observes a
strict confidentiality policy on all stu
dent records.
But it isn't possible to have an
abortion right at Cowell. Instead, the
staff refers students to private
physicians or to clinics in the area.
Cowell updates its referral list ac
cording to students' opinions about
the quality of service they receive at
each place.
The cost of an abortion runs
anywhere from $200 to $500 and the
operation itself if fairly simple. The
surgery itself takes no more than half
an hour. Most abortions are done
without general anesthesia in small
rooms very much like check-up
rooms in a doctor's office. Depending
on the type of abortion, it may be ne
cessary to see the doctor the day
before for pre-operative preparation
and, as with most surgeries, no eating
or drinking is allowed the morning of
the abortion.
Complications occur in fewer than
5 percent of all abortions, making an
abortion one of the safest procedures
performed in the United States.
"It's so safe because we do so
many," one doctor said. "We've just
had practice. Every time I tell a wo
man that I don't know whether to be
happy or sad."
Although Stanford does no abor
tions on campus, some universities do.
Some perform abortions at their
health centers. Cara Vaughn, the in
formation specialist at the University
of California at Berkeley Student
Health Service, provided some in
sight by describing the situation at
Cal.
The student clinics at Stanford and

Berkeley offer many of the same
services. Both schools support con
traceptive education and provide
pregnancy tests and counseling for
students. But Berkeley goes one step
further. The university has an insur
ance policy that pays for students'
abortions, which are performed on
campus.
Vaughn said that the policy has
been in effect for some time, but that
currently is doesn't receive much
press. If this is in any way due to
reticence on the part of the univer
sity, it's understandable. In the late
19705, some students at Cal charged
the university with violating their reli
gious rights by funding abortions with
students' registration fees. The stu
dents didn't feel that they should

have to pay for something they con
sidered morally objectionable. In
1982, however, the California Ap
pellate Court ruled in favor of the
university.

among alumni and faculty that it
would be more trouble than it's
worth." He added that if students are
worried about cost, the Blue Cross in
surance policy offered through Stan-

But Berkeley goes one step further.
The university has an insurance policy
that pays for students' abortions,
which are performed on campus.

When asked if University-funded
abortions have ever been suggested at
Stanford, John Dorman, a physician
at Cowell said, "I think our feeling is
that it would bring up such a storm

ford does cover abortions, although
some students hesitate to use it.
Dorman said that personally he
would have a hard time offering abor
tions through the university. "It

would mean to me that I had come
down on the side that says that abor
tion is really OK and that it's just
another one of the services we offer
our students. I'm not comfortable
making that commitment."
The facts about where and how to
get an abortion are straightforward.
But the experiences of the women
who have had abortions and of the
doctors they consult are rarely as
simple.
Abortion is a constant struggle for
Dorman. "I have to deal with it
myself once or twice a week. I can't
just say that abortion is right or
wrong.
"But I worry a lot about the ones
who come in and say, 'Hey, I'm preg
nant, I need an abortion.' The ones

who come in and cry and really
struggle with the problem before they
make a decision, those I worry about
a lot less."
Dorman reiterated a point that he
made in a letter to the editor that ap
peared in The Daily in October,
1980. His letter ended with the hope
that doctors could be "a problem
pregnancy counseling service, and not
merely an abortion referral service."
An important place to begin when
counseling on abortion is with the
context in which it most often occurs
â€” unwanted pregnancy. Dorman's
comments point to some of the fac
tors that contribute to the high num
ber of unwanted pregnancies among
Stanford students, who some might
think should be smart enough to
know better.
He noted that some students
confuse sexuality and contraception.
Many young people don't see the pri
mary consequence of using con
traceptives as being the prevention of
pregnancy. Instead, they see it as a
declaration of their sexual activity. If
they feel ambivalent about their deci
sion to become sexually active, or if
they don't want to take responsibility
for it, they may not want to commit
themselves by choosing a contracep
tive method.
Dorman said that "sometimes the
fear of making a conscious decision to
become sexually active is more im
mediate than the fear of an unwanted
pregnancy."
Another disturbing trend that Dor
man has identified during his years at
Cowell is that the majority of women
who come in with unwanted preg
nancies have previously used a
reliable method of birth control.
A study he conducted in the years
1978 to 1980 showed that many wo
men who had previously relied on the
pill or on an IUD have abandoned
those methods in favor of <the
diaphragm or rhythm. Increased use
of the diaphragm paralleled an in
crease in unwanted pregnancies. Al
though he hasn't recently repeated
the study, Dorman said that he feels
the trend is still going on.
The trend indicates that the prob
lem of unwanted pregnancies stem;
not from ignorance as much as fron
lack of diligence. The overwhelming
majority of unwanted pregnancies oc
cur because of a failure in the use o
the birth control method, not becaus<
of a failure of the method itself.
Most students at Stanford knov
which methods of birth control ar<
reliable and simple. If they choose i
method that requires more work
such as the diaphragm or rhythm
they know what it entails. But where
