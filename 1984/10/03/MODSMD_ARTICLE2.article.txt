# Dean to review frat report
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons hasn't
received a report from the Task Force on Fraterni
ties and Sororities yet, but he said he expects at
"any time" to see a preliminary version.
Lyons will review the report and then hand it to
University President Donald Kennedy for the next
step of the review process.
At this time, Lyons said, "there is a whole lot we
can do," just based on the task force's recommen
dations last spring. One of those recommendations
was that "assignment to student housing may not
be denied based on the subjective judgments of
current or former residents," a move that would ef
fectively end the fraternity housing system at Stan
ford.

Lyons said the recommendations alone con
stitute enough material to study and work with "for
several years."
Business Prof. Oscar Serbein, chairman of the
task force, said a preliminary draft of the report is
"in the hands of the committee," and hopes that
the final version will be completed sometime this
month.
He said he does not wish to comment further on
the report until other task force members read and
discuss the draft.
Diana Conklin, director of the Row, said a job
description has been drafted for a fraternal affairs
adviser, a new professional position that would
serve as "the focal point for fraternal affairs advis
ing."
The job description includes working with the

Inter-Fraternity and Inter-Sorority Councils, ser
ving as a liaison between the University and frater
nities, and counseling new groups seeking recogni
tion.
In addition to the seven unhoused sororities now
recognized by the University, Conklin said an ef
fort to establish a Stanford chapter of Delta Sigma
Theta is under way.
Darling Martin, the local vice president of exter
nal affairs for Delta Sigma Theta, said the sorority
is now a "city-wide chapter" comprising students
from Stanford and other nearby colleges.
Martin said the sorority has sought recognition
from the University since 1977, noting the local
group has had trouble gaining automony from the
international organization known formally as
"Delta Sigma Theta: A Public Service Sorority."
