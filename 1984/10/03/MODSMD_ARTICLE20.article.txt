## Long wait ends for Fred Buckley 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
F,red Buckley has all the character
istics of an All-America quarterback.
He's tall (6-foot-2), big (198
pounds) and handsome. He has a
wide, toothy smile and a sense of
humor. He also has the name of an
Ail-American. "Fred" is short and
simple, like Joe and John. "Buckley"
is uncomplicated, like Namath and
Elway.
But the question remains. Can-
Fred Buckley play like an All-
American? About 50,000 fans in
Pasadena's Rose Bowl and a few mil
lion more in front of their television
sets will know the answer Saturday
afternoon.
Buckley, who is replacing injured
sophomore John Paye, will be Stan
ford's starting quarterback against
UCLA Saturday at 4 p.m. in the Rose
Bowl. Although he is a senior (with
another year of eligibility remaining),
Buckley does not have extensive
game experience. He's played in two
games for a total of five downs. He's
thrown two passes, one of which was
an interception.
Those numbers don't seem to
bother Stanford Coach Jack Elway.
"What is a positive thing is that
Fred does have a feeling for the of
fense," Elway said. "He's had a lot of
turns and split time (in practice) with
John Paye at quarterback last spring
and again this fall. He's been throw
ing the ball extremely well and is fun
damentally sound. So I'm confident
that he'll do a good job for us this
week."
Elway said he won't change the of
fense for Buckley. "I won't water it
down and I won't simplify it," Elway
said. "I know Fred can handle the
entire spectrum of the offense."
Buckley's backup, junior Pete
Andrews, also gave Buckley, a Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. native, a verbal pat
on the back. "I think Fred will do

fine," Andrews said. "He just needs a
little time to get over his anxiousness
of not being in there for so long."
It has been a while since Buckley
took a hit in a game — high school, to
be exact.
Buckley came to Stanford in 1981
with a resume of prep accolades
thicker than a biology textbook. He
also arrived at preseason practice
with mononucleosis.
"I really didn't start to feel better
until the spring of my sophomore
year," said Buckley, whose weight
dropped to 175 pounds, nearly 25
less than his playing weight. "I went
home that summer and lived the life
of a hermit. I was in bed by 10 every
night, and a big day for me was an af
ternoon matinee."
By the time Buckley was healthy
enough to begin regaining his high
school form (he threw for 1,946 yards
and 19 touchdowns his senior
season), Steve Cottrell and John Faye
were battling for the starting quarter
back job, and Buckley was lost in the
shuffle.
Buckley, who had gone from all
everything in high school to all
nothing in college, became frustrated.
"It didn't make sense to me that if we
we were really behind in a game and
had no chance of winning, that 1
wouldn't get a chance to play," he
said.
But tossing in the towel — along
with his cleats, pads and helmet —
never crossed his mind. "I never lost
confidence as a player. I know what I
can do and I felt if called upon I could
play well," he said.
"I knew at some point my opportu
nity would come in some shape or
form. So I just wanted to stay in
shape and be prepared for when my
opportunity did come."
You might say Buckley has a lot of
patience, especially when you con
sider he might be the starting quarter
back for any of the football teams

that recruited him when he was at
tending Cardinal Gibbons High in Ft.
Lauderdale.
How good was Buckley in high
school? Good enough for Parade,
Scholastic Coach, Coach and
Athlete, Football News and
Blue Chips magazines to name him
a high school All-American. Good
enough for the governor of Florida to
call Buckley and encourage him to
stay in the state. And good enough
for football powers to recruit him
(Buckley toQk his six official recruit
ing trips to Stanford, Notre Dame,
USC, Texas, Ohio State and Har
vard).
Another school that wanted Buck
ley was UCLA, and Buckley said he
took an "unofficial" visit there. And
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue and his
staff remember Buckley well.
"We recruited him very hard here
at UCLA," Donahue said. "He went
to Stanford, but we worked hard to
get him. He's a quality player, and
we're sure he'll do a great job. When
he was coming out of high school, we
felt he was a very accurate thrower
[and] a very intelligent student. He
had great field presence and good
mobility."
Donahue knows what it's like to
lose a starting quarterback during a
season. It happened to him last year,
when Steve Bono's shoulder was
separated by Stanford defensive
lineman John Bergren in the Bruins'
fourth game.
For Donahue, however, what ap
peared to be sure disaster ended up
rosy. Inexperienced Rick Neuheisel
came on to lead UCLA to victories in
seven of its final eight games, includ
ing a 45-9 triumph over Illinois in the
Rose Bowl in January.
"That was a storybook kind of
thing," Buckley said. "It shows that
it's not impossible. That's what I'm
thinking now."
So, perhaps, is Jack Elway.

said. "I know Fred can handle the
entire spectrum of the offense."
Buckley's backup, junior Pete
Andrews, also gave Buckley, a Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. native, a verbal pat
on the back. "I think Fred will do

fine," Andrews said. "He just needs a
little time to get over his anxiousness
of not being in there for so long."
It has been a while since Buckley
took a hit in a game — high school, to
be exact.
Buckley came to Stanford in 1981
with a resume of prep accolades
thicker than a biology textbook. He
also arrived at preseason practice
with mononucleosis.
"I really didn't start to feel better
until the spring of my sophomore
year," said Buckley, whose weight
dropped to 175 pounds, nearly 25
less than his playing weight. "I went
home that summer and lived the life
of a hermit. I was in bed by 10 every
night, and a big day for me was an af
ternoon matinee."
By the time Buckley was healthy
enough to begin regaining his high
school form (he threw for 1,946 yards
and 19 touchdowns his senior
season), Steve Cottrell and John Faye
were battling for the starting quarter
back job, and Buckley was lost in the
shuffle.
Buckley, who had gone from all
everything in high school to all
nothing in college, became frustrated.
"It didn't make sense to me that if we
we were really behind in a game and
had no chance of winning, that 1
wouldn't get a chance to play," he
said.
But tossing in the towel — along
with his cleats, pads and helmet —
never crossed his mind. "I never lost
confidence as a player. I know what I
can do and I felt if called upon I could
play well," he said.
"I knew at some point my opportu
nity would come in some shape or
form. So I just wanted to stay in
shape and be prepared for when my
opportunity did come."
You might say Buckley has a lot of
patience, especially when you con
sider he might be the starting quarter
back for any of the football teams

that recruited him when he was at
tending Cardinal Gibbons High in Ft.
Lauderdale.
How good was Buckley in high
school? Good enough for Parade,
Scholastic Coach, Coach and
Athlete, Football News and
Blue Chips magazines to name him
a high school All-American. Good
enough for the governor of Florida to
call Buckley and encourage him to
stay in the state. And good enough
for football powers to recruit him
(Buckley toQk his six official recruit
ing trips to Stanford, Notre Dame,
USC, Texas, Ohio State and Har
vard).
Another school that wanted Buck
ley was UCLA, and Buckley said he
took an "unofficial" visit there. And
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue and his
staff remember Buckley well.
"We recruited him very hard here
at UCLA," Donahue said. "He went
to Stanford, but we worked hard to
get him. He's a quality player, and
we're sure he'll do a great job. When
he was coming out of high school, we
felt he was a very accurate thrower
[and] a very intelligent student. He
had great field presence and good
mobility."
Donahue knows what it's like to
lose a starting quarterback during a
season. It happened to him last year,
when Steve Bono's shoulder was
separated by Stanford defensive
lineman John Bergren in the Bruins'
fourth game.
For Donahue, however, what ap
peared to be sure disaster ended up
rosy. Inexperienced Rick Neuheisel
came on to lead UCLA to victories in
seven of its final eight games, includ
ing a 45-9 triumph over Illinois in the
Rose Bowl in January.
"That was a storybook kind of
thing," Buckley said. "It shows that
it's not impossible. That's what I'm
thinking now."
So, perhaps, is Jack Elway.

Quarterback Fred Buckley will be starting for Stanford against UCLA
Saturday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Wnile at the Farm, Buckley has
been the backup to John Elway and to John Paye, who injured a finger
on hi* throwing hand against Arizona State last Saturday.
F,red Buckley has all the character
istics of an All-America quarterback.
He's tall (6-foot-2), big (198
pounds) and handsome. He has a
wide, toothy smile and a sense of
humor. He also has the name of an
Ail-American. "Fred" is short and
simple, like Joe and John. "Buckley"
is uncomplicated, like Namath and
Elway.
But the question remains. Can-
Fred Buckley play like an All-
American? About 50,000 fans in
Pasadena's Rose Bowl and a few mil
lion more in front of their television
sets will know the answer Saturday
afternoon.
Buckley, who is replacing injured
sophomore John Paye, will be Stan
ford's starting quarterback against
UCLA Saturday at 4 p.m. in the Rose
Bowl. Although he is a senior (with
another year of eligibility remaining),
Buckley does not have extensive
game experience. He's played in two
games for a total of five downs. He's
thrown two passes, one of which was
an interception.
Those numbers don't seem to
bother Stanford Coach Jack Elway.
"What is a positive thing is that
Fred does have a feeling for the of
fense," Elway said. "He's had a lot of
turns and split time (in practice) with
John Paye at quarterback last spring
and again this fall. He's been throw
ing the ball extremely well and is fun
damentally sound. So I'm confident
that he'll do a good job for us this
week."
Elway said he won't change the of
fense for Buckley. "I won't water it
down and I won't simplify it," Elway
said. "I know Fred can handle the
entire spectrum of the offense."
Buckley's backup, junior Pete
Andrews, also gave Buckley, a Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. native, a verbal pat
