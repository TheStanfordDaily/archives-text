CHICAGO (AP) — Gary Mat
thews hit two home runs to lead the
Chicago Cubs to a 13-0 victory over
the San Diego Padres yesterday in the
first game of the best-of-five National
League Championship Series.
Besides Matthews, the Cubs, in a
record-breaking five-homer attack,
got round-trippers from Bob Dernier,
Ron Cey and pitcher Rick Sutcliffe,
who had a 16-1 record with Chicago.
Dernier, who scored three runs,
and Matthews, who had four RBI, hit
bases-empty homers off Padres right

hander Eric Show for the Cubs' first
two runs in the first. Sutcliffe hit a
leadoff homer in the third, and Mat
thews added a three-run homer in a
six-run fifth during which the Cubs
sent 12 men to the plate against
reliever Greg Harris.
Cey hit his fourth career playoff
homer in the sixth inning.
Chicago's five homers broke a
League Championships Series record
accomplished four times previously,
twice in each league.
Sutcliffe, traded to the Cubs June

13 from the Cleveland Indians,
yielded only singles to Steve Garvey
and Garry Templeton, struck out
eight and walked five in seven in
nings. Warren Brusstar allowed four
hits in the last two innings, complet
ing a six-hitter.
Game Two is scheduled at Wrigley
Field today, with Game Three at San
Diego tomorrow night. Games Four
and Five, if necessary, will be played
at San Diego Saturday and Sunday.
The Cubs and Padres were the only
teams in the National League that

had not been to the playoffs under
the division format, which began in
1969. The Cubs' last pennant was
1945.
The game was officiated by college
umpires, working in place of regular
umpires, who were on strike. The Na
tional League used a four-man
amateur crew, rather than the normal
six-man major league crew.
Sutcliffe, a right-hander, went
through the first three innings with
out giving up a hit. Garvey got the

first hit off Sutcliffe, reaching on a
bunt single in the fourth.
After Graig Nettles popped out,
Sutcliffe walked Terry Kennedy and
Kevin Mcßeynolds. Carmelo Mar
tinez then hit a sinking line drive to
right. Keith Moreland charged, dove
to the grass, and caught the ball for
the third out.
Leading off the bottom of the third,
Sutcliffe hit only the third League
Championship Series homer by a
pitcher.
