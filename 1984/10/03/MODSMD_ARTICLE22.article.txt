# Golfers second again

### ROB GRAHAM 
The Stanford's men's golf
team finished second in the
Wolfpack Classic at Lake
Tahoe's Edgewood Golf
Course yesterday. But despite
their performance, Cardinal
team members left the tourna
ment shaking their heads.
They did because the
Wolfpack Classic marked the
Card's second second-place
finish in as many weeks. Also,
Stanford was close to leaving
Lake Tahoe with the cham
pionship.
Two poor 18th holes denied
Coach Tim Schaafs squad a
victory. Junior Don
Walsworth's double-bogey
seven on the par-five 18th, fol
lowed by Lew Dickey's triple
bogey eight, provided Univer
sity of Pacific its four-stroke
victory margin.
"No, we're not satisfied,"
Walsworth said. "We think we
should have won."
Despite its collapse, the Car
dinal was still able to hold off
third-place Fresno State, which
finished one stroke behind
Stanford and five strokes be
hind UOP.
The second-place finish left
Schaaf looking for his first vic
tory of the preseason. In each
of the last two years, the Car
dinal had two early-season
tournament victories. Stanford
will have another opportunity
at the Louisiana State Invita
tional, which begins in Baton
Rouge, La., today.
Because the LSU Invita
tional begins soon after the
Wolfpack Classic, the Cardinal
will field a different team at
LSU.
At Lake Tahoe, the Stanford
team was led by junior Carl
Wagner, the tournament's low
individual scorer. Wagner's
two-day total of 147 defeated
second-place Curtis Jones of
Fresno State by three strokes.
Tenth-place finisher
Walsworth needed 157 strokes
for the 36 holes.
Still, Cardinal team members
were unsatisfied.
"A loss to UOP is still a
loss," Walsworth said.
