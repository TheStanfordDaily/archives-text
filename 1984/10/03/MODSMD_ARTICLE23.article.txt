# Cardinal streak on the line
## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT 
The Stanford men's soccer
team takes a two-game win
streak into tonight's Pacific
Soccer Conference match
against the Fresno State Bull
dogs at 7:30 in Fresno.
The Bulldogs are currently
ranked 18th in the nation by
Soccer America magazine, ac
cording to Cardinal Head
Coach Sam Koch.
"It's going to be tough, espe
cially when the game is at
Fresno," Koch said.
"They're not great
anywhere, but they are just
very good all the way around,"
Koch said. "Fresno State has
excellent forwards, a fine
defense, and skilled
midfielders."
Stanford is currently 5-2-2
overall after victories over San
Jose State Sept. 26 and the
University of San Diego Sept.
29. The Cardinal is 1-0 in PSC
play.
Conference games are criti
cal to Stanford's playoff hopes.
National Collegiate Athletic
Association playoff berths are
automatically given to the first
place finisher of the PSC
regardless of that team's
regular-season record.

Koch, who said he scouted
the Bulldogs about two weeks
ago, has some ideas about how
to beat Fresno State and stay
undefeated in the PSC.
"We're going to mark their
two inside forwards very
tightly," Koch said. "They have
a strong stopper (full) back
who is dangerous offensively as
well as defensively, who we'll
concentrate on. We'll try to
control the ball and set the
tempo."
Senior forward Giancarlo
Ferruzzi continues to lead the
Cardinal in scoring with three
goals and four assists. Junior
forward Rob West also has
three goals. Goalkeeper Willy
Burkhardt, a senior, currently
has two shutouts and a 1.00
goals-against average.
Stanford's offense has
produced only 15 goals in nine
games, however, and Koch has
made adjustments to try to get
more scoring from his team.
"We've worked on some
things like off-the-ball move
ment," Koch.said. "And we're
trying to get more attacks on
goal from our wingers. We
crossed the ball too many times
in our last game (against San
Diego)."
