ATLANTA (AP) â€” Coach Eddie
Haas, who has been in Atlanta's or
ganization since 1965, was named the
Braves' manager yesterday, replacing
Joe Torre who was fired.
Haas, 49, who has been with the
Braves as a minor league manager,
instructor and coach, managed the
Richmond club of the Class AAA In
ternational League for nearly four
years before being named first base
coach with Atlanta in July.
Torre, 44, who was dismissed Mon
day, led the team td the National
League West title in 1982 during his
first season with Atlanta and wound
up as the most successful manager in
Braves' history since the franchise
moved from Milwaukee in 1966.
During his three seasons in At
lanta, he had a 257-229 record,
finishing second to Los Angeles in
1983 and tied with Houston for

second behind San Diego this season
with an 80-82 mark.
Haas had been expected to get the
Braves' top field job. "I guess it's not
too much of a surprise that Eddie
Haas is the new manager of the At
lanta Braves," team owner Ted
Turner said in announcing the ap
pointment at a news conference.
Haas, who had a brief major league
playing career with the Chicago Cubs
in 1957 and the Milwaukee Braves in
1958 and 1960, said, "It's an honor
to manage any major league baseball
club, but it's a special honor to
manage one of the top organizations
in baseball."
Haas led the Richmond club, which
he managed for three and one-half
years, to a first-place finish in 1982
and into three playoffs. He began his
managerial career in 1965 with the
West Palm Beach Braves farm club.
