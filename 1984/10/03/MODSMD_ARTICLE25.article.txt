# Detroit beats Royals

### 
KANSAS CITY (AP) — Alan
Trammel! led the Tigers' attack by
driving in three runs with a homer,
triple and single as Detroit beat
Kansas City, 8-1, in the opening
game of the American League Cham
pionship Series last night.
Trammell, who also walked twice
in reaching base the five times he
came to bat, hit an RBI-triple in a
two-run first inning.
The Tigers had 14 hits — including
home runs by Larry Herndon and
Lance Parrish. They'll try for a
second victory in the best-of-five se
ries tonight when Dan Petry pitches
against 20-year-old rookie Bret
Saberhagen. Petry was 18-8 this year,
and Saberhagen was 10-11, 3-1
against Detroit.
Last night's game was worked by a
fill-in crew of six umpires who
replaced striking regular umpires.
Detroit starter Jack Morris retired
the first seven Royals and had a 3-0
lead before Don Slaught singled in
the third. An out later, Willie Wilson
singled. After Pat Sheridan fouled off
two full-count pitches and walked to
load the bases, Morris faced his big
gest challenge.
He got out of it when George Brett
hit a sinking liner to right field that
Kirk Gibson caught to retire the
Royals.
From then on, Morris 19-11 during
this season, had little trouble. He
retired nine consecutive batters until

Jorge Orta led off the seventh with a
triple and scored on Darryl Motley's
groundout for Kansas City's only run,
making it 5-1.
Morris left the game after the
seventh with a blister on the middle
finger of his pitching hand. Willie
Hernandez pitched two hitless in
nings in shutting down the American
League West champion Royals, who
were 84-78 during the regular season.
The Tigers, the American League
East champions with a 104-58
record, were 6-0 at Royals Stadium
this season.
