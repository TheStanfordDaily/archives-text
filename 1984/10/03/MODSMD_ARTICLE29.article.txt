Ford Foundation grant
The Ford Foundation has approved
a three-year, $300,000 grant for an
emeritus faculty development program
at Stanford, Provost James Rosse re
ported to the Faculty Senate
Thursday.
The grant will provide research
awards of up to $3,000 per year for
emeritus faculty members to do pilot
research or complete research in
progress. It also will provide opportu
nities for emerti to be recalled to
teach in their departments or in inter
disciplinary programs. In addition,

funds will be provided for retired fac
ulty to serve as student advisers.
How the grant is administered will
be influenced by the senate discussion
Oct. 25 on the committee structure
for dealing with emerti concerns.
The proposal was submitted to the
Ford Foundation last spring by
Provost Albert Hastorf, based on
suggestions from a committee
composed of Asst. Provost Cecilia
Burciaga, Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch, Philosophy Prof. John
Goheen, Geology Prof. Konrad
Krauskoph and Mathematics Prof.
Mary Sunseri.
"During this decade we believe our
continuing concern for the quality of
life of our retirees and their ability to
contribute to the community — and
our efforts to improve that quality of
life — will undoubtedly help increase
our ability to make new positions
available to young faculty," Hastorf
told the foundation.
Lecturer has dark visions
The United States has lost its op
timism. No longer do we assume a
rosy future in which the engineers
and scientists will provide us a brave
new world.
This is apparent from a new book.
"Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Vi
sions of the American Future," co
authored by Joseph Corn, a Stanford
lecturer.
Using illustrations from articles,
magazine covers and advertisements,
the book shows the ways Americans
have predicted the future during the
last 100 years.
These convey the optimistic hopes
for the cities of the future, for easy
and luxurious transport, labor-saving
devices, comfortable lifestyles for all,
"miracle" inventions, space colonies
— a world in which the technicians
remove all blight, pain and inconveni
ence.
Corn lectures in both the American
Studies and the Values, Technology,
Science and Society programs here.

New Volunteer Network head
Peter Spivack, former member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents and
1984 recipient of the J.E. Wallace
Sterling award, has been appointed
director of the Stanford Volunteer
Network.
Spivack, a native of Menlo Park,
will work to catalyze and coordinate
volunteer service among Stanford
faculty, staff and students.
Now in its first year of operation,
the Stanford Volunteer Network is
located in Owen House, next door to
the Campus Bike Shop. The office
houses a clearinghouse of more than
300 volunteer service opportunities.
Spivack hopes to get dormitories,
campus organizations, and fraternal
organizations to "adopt an agency"
for the year and plan projects with
these agencies.
SIDS research gift
A Milpitas couple who lost their
second son 22 years ago to sudden in
fant death syndrome (SIDS) spear
headed a fund-raising bowling drive
\vhich resulted last week in a gift of
$5,100 to Stanford, in support of
SIDS research.
Howard and Sura Weiner have
been donating to the SIDS program
here for about a decade, said Stuart

Rawlings, administrator of the Stan
ford Sleep Disorders Center. They
founded the International Guild for
Infant Survival of California, Inc., as
a parent support group and vehicle
for ongoing support to SIDS educa
tion and research, he added.
"When we lost our son at the age of
two months, there was no informa
tion, no research, no education, noth
ing," said Sura Weiner, an as
semblyworker in electronics. Since
then, the Weiners and others have
been working to increase awareness
and research into the problem, and to
comfort bereaved families, she ex
plained.
Business school elects officers
Peter Leone and Joe Tye have
been elected co-presidents of the
Stanford Business School Student
Association for the 1984-85 aca

New controversial sculpture
Edwina Sandys' "Christa," the
controversial bronze sculpture which
depicts Jesus as a crucified woman,
will be on display in Memorial
Church from Oct. 17 through Dec.
31.
Sandys, a New York City sculptor
and granddaughter of Winston Chur
chill, created the crucifix in 1975 for
the United Nations Decade for Wo
men. Until recently, the sculpture has
been displayed only in museums and
art galleries.
Last April during Holy Week
services, "Christa" was placed near
the high altar in the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine (Episcopal) in New
York City. The Suffragan Bishop of
the Episcopal Diocese of New York
later criticized the statue, calling it
"theologically and historically in
defensible."
Stanford viewed favorably
Palo Alto and Menlo Park resi
dents view Stanford as a good neigh
bor which has managed its lands well
in recent years.
They support expansion and
modernization of Stanford Hospital
and favor extension of Willow Road
to El Camino Real.
But they also believe that Stanford
should meet all the concerns of ad
joining cities when building on its
land.

These views are exp sssed by large
majorities of those responding to a
recent survey conducted by the Stan
ford Institute of Communication Re
search, with support from the Univer
sity's Office of Public Affairs.
The survey involved a random se
lection of 451 adults, interviewed by
students from late April to mid-June.
Nine out of 10 said they visit Stan
ford at least once every few months,
making the campus one of the most
widely used institutions on the mid
peninsula, according to John
McManus and Vincent Price of the
institute. _ . .
The overwhelming majority
believe the University is a great bene
fit to neighboring cities, with 94 per
cent saying it improves the quality of
life.
For one in three residents, the first
idea that comes to mind about Stan
ford is "excellent, "the best, or
"one of the best" universities in the
world. Another 10 percent think first
of the beauty of the campus. Fewer
than 5 percent say the University is
"elitist" or "overrated."
Two out of three favor expansion
of Stanford Hospital. One in five has
no opinion, while 8 percent object.

New controversial sculpture
Edwina Sandys' "Christa," the
controversial bronze sculpture which
depicts Jesus as a crucified woman,
will be on display in Memorial
Church from Oct. 17 through Dec.
31.
Sandys, a New York City sculptor
and granddaughter of Winston Chur
chill, created the crucifix in 1975 for
the United Nations Decade for Wo
men. Until recently, the sculpture has
been displayed only in museums and
art galleries.
Last April during Holy Week
services, "Christa" was placed near
the high altar in the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine (Episcopal) in New
York City. The Suffragan Bishop of
the Episcopal Diocese of New York
later criticized the statue, calling it
"theologically and historically in
defensible."
Stanford viewed favorably
Palo Alto and Menlo Park resi
dents view Stanford as a good neigh
bor which has managed its lands well
in recent years.
They support expansion and
modernization of Stanford Hospital
and favor extension of Willow Road
to El Camino Real.
But they also believe that Stanford
should meet all the concerns of ad
joining cities when building on its
land.

These views are exp sssed by large
majorities of those responding to a
recent survey conducted by the Stan
ford Institute of Communication Re
search, with support from the Univer
sity's Office of Public Affairs.
The survey involved a random se
lection of 451 adults, interviewed by
students from late April to mid-June.
Nine out of 10 said they visit Stan
ford at least once every few months,
making the campus one of the most
widely used institutions on the mid
peninsula, according to John
McManus and Vincent Price of the
institute. _ . .
The overwhelming majority
believe the University is a great bene
fit to neighboring cities, with 94 per
cent saying it improves the quality of
life.
For one in three residents, the first
idea that comes to mind about Stan
ford is "excellent, "the best, or
"one of the best" universities in the
world. Another 10 percent think first
of the beauty of the campus. Fewer
than 5 percent say the University is
"elitist" or "overrated."
Two out of three favor expansion
of Stanford Hospital. One in five has
no opinion, while 8 percent object.

Ford Foundation grant
The Ford Foundation has approved
a three-year, $300,000 grant for an
emeritus faculty development program
at Stanford, Provost James Rosse re
ported to the Faculty Senate
Thursday.
The grant will provide research
awards of up to $3,000 per year for
emeritus faculty members to do pilot
research or complete research in
progress. It also will provide opportu
nities for emerti to be recalled to
teach in their departments or in inter
disciplinary programs. In addition,

funds will be provided for retired fac
ulty to serve as student advisers.
How the grant is administered will
be influenced by the senate discussion
Oct. 25 on the committee structure
for dealing with emerti concerns.
The proposal was submitted to the
Ford Foundation last spring by
Provost Albert Hastorf, based on
suggestions from a committee
composed of Asst. Provost Cecilia
Burciaga, Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch, Philosophy Prof. John
Goheen, Geology Prof. Konrad
Krauskoph and Mathematics Prof.
Mary Sunseri.
"During this decade we believe our
continuing concern for the quality of
life of our retirees and their ability to
contribute to the community — and
our efforts to improve that quality of
life — will undoubtedly help increase
our ability to make new positions
available to young faculty," Hastorf
told the foundation.
Lecturer has dark visions
The United States has lost its op
timism. No longer do we assume a
rosy future in which the engineers
and scientists will provide us a brave
new world.
This is apparent from a new book.
"Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Vi
sions of the American Future," co
authored by Joseph Corn, a Stanford
lecturer.
Using illustrations from articles,
magazine covers and advertisements,
the book shows the ways Americans
have predicted the future during the
last 100 years.
These convey the optimistic hopes
for the cities of the future, for easy
and luxurious transport, labor-saving
devices, comfortable lifestyles for all,
"miracle" inventions, space colonies
— a world in which the technicians
remove all blight, pain and inconveni
ence.
Corn lectures in both the American
Studies and the Values, Technology,
Science and Society programs here.

New Volunteer Network head
Peter Spivack, former member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents and
1984 recipient of the J.E. Wallace

Spivack, a native of Menlo Park,
will work to catalyze and coordinate
volunteer service among Stanford
faculty, staff and students.
Now in its first year of operation,
the Stanford Volunteer Network is
located in Owen House, next door to
the Campus Bike Shop. The office
houses a clearinghouse of more than
300 volunteer service opportunities.
Spivack hopes to get dormitories,
campus organizations, and fraternal
organizations to "adopt an agency"
for the year and plan projects with
these agencies.

Ford Foundation grant
The Ford Foundation has approved
a three-year, $300,000 grant for an
emeritus faculty development program
at Stanford, Provost James Rosse re
ported to the Faculty Senate
Thursday.
The grant will provide research
awards of up to $3,000 per year for
emeritus faculty members to do pilot
research or complete research in
progress. It also will provide opportu
nities for emerti to be recalled to
teach in their departments or in inter
disciplinary programs. In addition,

funds will be provided for retired fac
ulty to serve as student advisers.
How the grant is administered will
be influenced by the senate discussion
Oct. 25 on the committee structure
for dealing with emerti concerns.
The proposal was submitted to the
Ford Foundation last spring by
Provost Albert Hastorf, based on
suggestions from a committee
composed of Asst. Provost Cecilia
Burciaga, Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch, Philosophy Prof. John
Goheen, Geology Prof. Konrad
Krauskoph and Mathematics Prof.
Mary Sunseri.
"During this decade we believe our
continuing concern for the quality of
life of our retirees and their ability to
contribute to the community — and
our efforts to improve that quality of
life — will undoubtedly help increase
our ability to make new positions
available to young faculty," Hastorf
told the foundation.
Lecturer has dark visions
The United States has lost its op
timism. No longer do we assume a
rosy future in which the engineers
and scientists will provide us a brave
new world.
This is apparent from a new book.
"Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Vi
sions of the American Future," co
authored by Joseph Corn, a Stanford
lecturer.
Using illustrations from articles,
magazine covers and advertisements,
the book shows the ways Americans
have predicted the future during the
last 100 years.
These convey the optimistic hopes
for the cities of the future, for easy
and luxurious transport, labor-saving
devices, comfortable lifestyles for all,
"miracle" inventions, space colonies
— a world in which the technicians
remove all blight, pain and inconveni
ence.
Corn lectures in both the American
Studies and the Values, Technology,
Science and Society programs here.

New Volunteer Network head
Peter Spivack, former member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents and
1984 recipient of the J.E. Wallace
Sterling award, has been appointed
director of the Stanford Volunteer
Network.
Spivack, a native of Menlo Park,
will work to catalyze and coordinate
volunteer service among Stanford
faculty, staff and students.
Now in its first year of operation,
the Stanford Volunteer Network is
located in Owen House, next door to
the Campus Bike Shop. The office
houses a clearinghouse of more than
300 volunteer service opportunities.
Spivack hopes to get dormitories,
campus organizations, and fraternal
organizations to "adopt an agency"
for the year and plan projects with
these agencies.
SIDS research gift
A Milpitas couple who lost their
second son 22 years ago to sudden in
fant death syndrome (SIDS) spear
headed a fund-raising bowling drive
\vhich resulted last week in a gift of
$5,100 to Stanford, in support of
SIDS research.
Howard and Sura Weiner have
been donating to the SIDS program
here for about a decade, said Stuart

Rawlings, administrator of the Stan
ford Sleep Disorders Center. They
founded the International Guild for
Infant Survival of California, Inc., as
a parent support group and vehicle
for ongoing support to SIDS educa
tion and research, he added.
"When we lost our son at the age of
two months, there was no informa
tion, no research, no education, noth
ing," said Sura Weiner, an as
semblyworker in electronics. Since
then, the Weiners and others have
been working to increase awareness
and research into the problem, and to
comfort bereaved families, she ex
plained.

New controversial sculpture
Edwina Sandys' "Christa," the
controversial bronze sculpture which
depicts Jesus as a crucified woman,
will be on display in Memorial
Church from Oct. 17 through Dec.
31.
Sandys, a New York City sculptor
and granddaughter of Winston Chur
chill, created the crucifix in 1975 for
the United Nations Decade for Wo
men. Until recently, the sculpture has
been displayed only in museums and
art galleries.
Last April during Holy Week
services, "Christa" was placed near
the high altar in the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine (Episcopal) in New
York City. The Suffragan Bishop of
the Episcopal Diocese of New York
later criticized the statue, calling it
"theologically and historically in
defensible."
Stanford viewed favorably
Palo Alto and Menlo Park resi
dents view Stanford as a good neigh
bor which has managed its lands well
in recent years.
They support expansion and
modernization of Stanford Hospital
and favor extension of Willow Road
to El Camino Real.
But they also believe that Stanford
should meet all the concerns of ad
joining cities when building on its
land.

These views are exp sssed by large
majorities of those responding to a
recent survey conducted by the Stan
ford Institute of Communication Re
search, with support from the Univer
sity's Office of Public Affairs.
The survey involved a random se
lection of 451 adults, interviewed by
students from late April to mid-June.
Nine out of 10 said they visit Stan
ford at least once every few months,
making the campus one of the most
widely used institutions on the mid
peninsula, according to John
McManus and Vincent Price of the
institute. _ . .
The overwhelming majority
believe the University is a great bene
fit to neighboring cities, with 94 per
cent saying it improves the quality of
life.
For one in three residents, the first
idea that comes to mind about Stan
ford is "excellent, "the best, or
"one of the best" universities in the
world. Another 10 percent think first
of the beauty of the campus. Fewer
than 5 percent say the University is
"elitist" or "overrated."
Two out of three favor expansion
of Stanford Hospital. One in five has
no opinion, while 8 percent object.
