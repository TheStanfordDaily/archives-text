Francisco Alarcon, the Stanford graduate student
accused of having oral copulation with minors, was
released yesterday morning from San Francisco County
Jail on $500,000 bail, police said last night.
Alarcon, 30, turned himself in to police Thursday night
after they issued an all-points bulletin for his arrest on
charges of oral copulation with and providing marijuana
to minors.
Police also wanted to question Alarcon about the stab
bing death of Ted Gomez, a 15-year-old runaway from
Alameda, whose body was discovered by a passer-by in
San Franqsco's Golden Gate Park on Sept. 22.
Police said two teenage boys saw Gomez and an older
man entering an orange jeep-type vehicle the night before
Gomez's body was found. The two witnesses later identi
fied the vehicle in front of Alarcon's San Francisco apart
ment.
Alarcon's attorney, Tony Tamburello, said Monday
that police had hoped to connect Alarcon with the murder
through blood tests, but that the results of those tests were
not conlusive enough to be used.
Police again refused yesterday to divulge details of the
case; San Francsico Police Investigator James Crowley
said only that the "case is still under investigation."
Neither Tamburello nor Alarcon were available for
comment yesterday.

been less aggressive in the case had Alarcon not been a
Hispanic living in San Francisco's Mission District.
