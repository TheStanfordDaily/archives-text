I want to apologize for waking Phil
at 3 a.m. today. Phil is my good
natured roommate whom I appreci
ate for his great patience, tolerance
and perseverance. He is a man of
noble deeds and thoughts. And he is
forgiving beyond belief.
1 would also like to thank Troy, just
for being Troy. He's truly the cat's
meow.
