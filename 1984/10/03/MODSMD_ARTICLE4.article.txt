# Western Culture adds new tracks
## 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN 
The freshman ritual known as
Western Culture has been expanded
this year to accommodate two new
tracks: Conflict and Change in West
ern Culture and Literature and the
Arts.
Both courses follow the usual
three-quarter sequence and fulfill the
basic Western Culture curriculum.
Assoc. Classics Prof. Susan Stephens,
track chairman for Conflict and
Change, said, "The major difference
from this course and others is that we
enlist the aid of social science and so
cial history to ask the question,
'Why?'
"This is a social-historical ap
proach to study," she continued.
The course consists of two 90-
minute lectures each week, along
with one two-hour discussion section.
The sequence begins with a study of
the ancient world, focusing on Greek
and Roman civilization. The course
also examines the relationship be
tween European civilization and the
Islamic world and concludes with a
look at the modern world. The class is
filled to capacity, said Stephens, with
144 students.
The other new course, Literature
and the Arts, was planned by a
branch of the English Department
headed by Assoc. English Prof. John
Bender. The course is unique in that
it fulfills both freshman writing and
Western Culture requirements.
"In this course, students will have
writing assignments on the material
they have read," said Steven Marx,
coordinator and lecturer for
Literature and the Arts. "This will
enhance both the writing and reading
assignments in a manner that they
will complement each other."
The course's other unique thrust is
the strong emphasis given to fine arts
along with the usual literature, his
tory and philosophy.
"This way the students get a look at
all facets of Western Culture," Marx
said.
"There is also an attempt to read
works in their original (Early and
Middle) English rather than in trans
lation," he said. "An appreciation for
the actual texture of language is im
portant."
During spring quarter, Marx hopes

to include in his syllabus a significant
emphasis on female authors along
with the usual roster of males read in
the Western Culture tracks.
Currently the class enrollment limit
is 60. Marx said the response from
enrolling freshmen was encouraging,
and said he hopes eventually to ex
pand the program to accommodate
250 students.
The two new tracks join already
existing programs in history; Great
Works; philosophy; and Values,
Technology and Society. Administra
tors decided to discontinue two other
programs — humanities and religion
— in spring.
Comments from students enrolled
in the Conflict and Change in West
ern Culture course have varied:
"[Stephens] is an interesting lec
turer, but she's kind of boring," said
one freshman. " We've been talking
about Egypt and all this other West
ern Culture stuff, and so far it hasn't
been a lot of work."
"The class itself is interesting," said
another freshman. "At least I think it
will be . . . .[But] I think what they
have planned for us is a little
ridiculous. Get serious, I'm really
going to read the whole 'Odyssey' in a
week. I realize this is college, but I'm
not that fast."
A freshman in Literature and the
Arts said her lecturer, English Prof.
Donald Howard, is really funny.
"There is a lot of discipline in the
class which some might not like. The
class is small, though, so you get a lot
of personalized attention."
The requirement that freshmen
take three sequential courses in
Western Culture is one of a number
of such requirements initiated in
1980. Students are also required to
take one course in each of seven
other subject areas which together
cover all areas of the undergraduate
curriculum here. One of those addi
tional courses must be designated as
concentrating on a non-Western cul
ture.
Freshmen request their Western
Culture track during the summer
prior to their arrival at Stanford. The
Great Works track is traditionally the
most popular, offering four hours of
small-group discussion and one
lecture each week.
