Soviet 'attack' order revealed
TOKYO — One afternoon in August, the Soviet Far Eastern military
headquarters suddenly dispatched a coded message, saying: "We now
embark on military action against the U.S. Forces," sources well in
formed on military affairs have disclosed here.
The sources, who declined to be identified, said what could have been
an order for a "surprise attack" on the U.S. was followed by another
message about 30 minutes later canceling the first one. The messages
came a day after the Soviet media reported President Reagan's joke
about bombing the Soviet Union.
The "war-declaring" message was monitored by both Japanese and
U.S. government facilities at about 4 p.m. on Aug. 15, said the sources.
It was confirmed to have been sent from Vladivostok to Ussurisk,
where a Soviet special command unit is stationed, the sources said. The
Japanese and U.S. governments, greatly alarmed by the message, part of
which had been sent in non-coded words, consulted with each other to
ascertain the situation.
During the half-hour period before the second message, however, nei
ther government detected any unusual moves by Soviet forces.
Since the "zero-hour" dispatch was followed by the cancellation
message, it ended up as a secret "grave incident" known in Japan only to
a handful of high government officials, including Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone and some Defense Agency and Foreign Ministry of
ficials, the sources said.
The 30-minute period between the first and second telegrams "was
the longest time in history," the sources said in describing the tenseness
of Japanese and the U.S. officials after the Soviet "war-opening" dis
patch.
According to the sources, Japanese and U.S. government officials now
believe the message most likely was sent in retaliation for Reagan's joke
about "outlawing" and "bombing" the Soviet Union.
Philippino military criticized
MANILA, Philippines — The Roman Catholic leader of the
Philippines accused the military establishment yesterday of engaging in a
"saturnalia of sadism and violence" and urged widespread participation
in peaceful demonstrations against the government of President Fer
dinand Marcos.
Cardinal Jaime Sin, the archbishop of Manila and a frequent critic of
the president, decried what he termed a "moral dry rot" in the country
and called for a "storm of non-violent protest."
Angered by recent violent clashes between police and soldiers on the
one hand and anti-government protesters on the other. Sin, speaking to
a group of accountants, attacked military leaders as "trigger-happy" and
"power-hungry."
He praised student demonstrators, telling the accountants that "their
fight should also be your fight." And he called on business leaders to
join demonstrators in what has come to be known here as the
"parliament of the streets" to pressure Marcos for change.
However, he said he would urge demonstrators to steer clear of areas
near the presidential Malacanang Palace, to reduce the chance of violent
confrontation with the authorities.
Bomb hits U.S. defense contractor
BRUSSELS, Belgium — A bomb blast caused considerable property
damage yesterday morning at the office here of Litton Data Systems, a
U.S. defense contractor with close links to NATO, authorities here re
ported.
Authorities said a previously unknown communist organization had
claimed responsibility for the attack.
The ground floor of the building bore the brunt of the damage, auth
orities said. No one was injured. The building is situated just a few
hundred yards from NATO's Brussels headquarters.
Litton Data, based in Beverly Hills, manufactures computer sys
tems for military purposes, anti-aircraft and artillery targeting appa
ratus and electronic communications equipment.
EPA names hazardous waste sites
SAN FRANCISCO — The Environmental Protection Agency yester
day added 41 hazardous waste sites in California to its list of those
posing possible long-term health and environment threats, including 19
electronics firms in the Silicon Valley.
At a news conference coinciding with one at EPA headquarters in
Washington, EPA Regional Administrator Judith Ayres said that 48
hazardous waste sites in the western region, including one in Arizona
and six in Hawaii, have been proposed for inclusion on the Superfund
National Priorities List.
She emphasized that the new sites are simply being proposed for addi
tion to the existing list of 28 sites in the region that includes California,
Hawaii, Nevada, Arizona and the Pacific Territories.
"It is possible that some of these sites will not be listed, as new infor
mation comes to light during the comment period," she said.
In addition, she said, inclusion on the final list is no guarantee the
EPA will assume financial responsibility for the long-term cleanup of a
site.
But she said that 98 percent of those sites on the first proposed list
made it to the final list and stressed the EPA's commitment to ridding
the country of harmful toxic wastes.
"Before I came to the EPA last Nov. 16, there seemed to be some
feeling that access was not as open as it should have been," Ayres said in
an apparent reference to the cloud the agency found itself under when
Anne Burford was director.
"We want the dumps cleaned up. We want the polluters to pay, and so
we seek out the responsible parties, arrange for cleanup payments and
bring polluters to court," Ayres said. "We shall stabilize these waste
sites. We shall prevent pollution from reaching groundwater. We shall
keep poisons away from people and their resources."
Power outage affects 6 states
PORTLAND, Ore. — A "major disturbance" in electrical transmis
sion lines yesterday caused a power outage that affected parts of six
western states, utility officials said.
The power failure affected parts of Idaho, Oregon, Washington,
Nevada, Arizona and California, officials said. Some customers were out
of service for up to an hour but others saw only a brief flicker in lights.
Record setting cosmonauts return
MOSCOW —Three Soviet cosmonauts returned safely to Earth yes
terday after staying in orbit for nearly eight months and setting a new
space endurance record.
They landed on the 238 th day of their mission while their space sta
tion, Salyut-7, which was put into orbit April 19, 1982, kept spinning
around the globe on automatic pilot.
Commander Leonid Kizim, speaking for himself and crew members
Vladimir Solovyov and Oleg Atkov, said after landing. "We have a little
strength left and we feel fine.". Asked if the unaccustomed pull of
Earth's gravity made them feel unexpectedly heavy, he replied: "Yes,
but it's like an embrace."
Doctors who examined the cosmonauts after their return said they had
coped well with the lengthy period of zero gravity, according to Tass, the
official Soviet news agency. The mission was designed to test the effect
of extended periods of weightlessness on the human body.
The mission, which began with a Feb. 8 blast-off, broke the previous
space endurance record of 211 days on Sept. 6. Tass said the cosmonauts
made 3,408 orbits and traveled 160 million kilometers (99.4 million
miles), or enough to have taken them to Mars and back again.
Stocks fall in moderate trading
NEW YORK — Stocks fell broadly in moderate trading for their third
consecutive loss yesterday, dropping the Dow Jones industrials to their
lowest level in two months.
Declines were widespread among steel, auto, computer and financial
issues. A few oil and mining stocks advanced.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny today with low clouds this morning. Today's high will be
in the 70s with the temperature dipping to a low in the 50s or upper 40s
tonight.

join demonstrators in what has come to be known here as the
"parliament of the streets" to pressure Marcos for change.
However, he said he would urge demonstrators to steer clear of areas
near the presidential Malacanang Palace, to reduce the chance of violent
confrontation with the authorities.
Bomb hits U.S. defense contractor
BRUSSELS, Belgium — A bomb blast caused considerable property
damage yesterday morning at the office here of Litton Data Systems, a
U.S. defense contractor with close links to NATO, authorities here re
ported.
Authorities said a previously unknown communist organization had
claimed responsibility for the attack.
The ground floor of the building bore the brunt of the damage, auth
orities said. No one was injured. The building is situated just a few
hundred yards from NATO's Brussels headquarters.
Litton Data, based in Beverly Hills, manufactures computer sys
tems for military purposes, anti-aircraft and artillery targeting appa
ratus and electronic communications equipment.
EPA names hazardous waste sites
SAN FRANCISCO — The Environmental Protection Agency yester
day added 41 hazardous waste sites in California to its list of those
posing possible long-term health and environment threats, including 19
electronics firms in the Silicon Valley.
At a news conference coinciding with one at EPA headquarters in
Washington, EPA Regional Administrator Judith Ayres said that 48
hazardous waste sites in the western region, including one in Arizona
and six in Hawaii, have been proposed for inclusion on the Superfund
National Priorities List.
She emphasized that the new sites are simply being proposed for addi
tion to the existing list of 28 sites in the region that includes California,
Hawaii, Nevada, Arizona and the Pacific Territories.
"It is possible that some of these sites will not be listed, as new infor
mation comes to light during the comment period," she said.
In addition, she said, inclusion on the final list is no guarantee the
EPA will assume financial responsibility for the long-term cleanup of a
site.
But she said that 98 percent of those sites on the first proposed list
made it to the final list and stressed the EPA's commitment to ridding
the country of harmful toxic wastes.
"Before I came to the EPA last Nov. 16, there seemed to be some
feeling that access was not as open as it should have been," Ayres said in
an apparent reference to the cloud the agency found itself under when
Anne Burford was director.
"We want the dumps cleaned up. We want the polluters to pay, and so
we seek out the responsible parties, arrange for cleanup payments and
bring polluters to court," Ayres said. "We shall stabilize these waste
sites. We shall prevent pollution from reaching groundwater. We shall
keep poisons away from people and their resources."
Power outage affects 6 states
PORTLAND, Ore. — A "major disturbance" in electrical transmis
sion lines yesterday caused a power outage that affected parts of six
western states, utility officials said.
The power failure affected parts of Idaho, Oregon, Washington,
Nevada, Arizona and California, officials said. Some customers were out
of service for up to an hour but others saw only a brief flicker in lights.
Record setting cosmonauts return
MOSCOW —Three Soviet cosmonauts returned safely to Earth yes
terday after staying in orbit for nearly eight months and setting a new
space endurance record.
They landed on the 238 th day of their mission while their space sta
tion, Salyut-7, which was put into orbit April 19, 1982, kept spinning
around the globe on automatic pilot.
Commander Leonid Kizim, speaking for himself and crew members
Vladimir Solovyov and Oleg Atkov, said after landing. "We have a little
strength left and we feel fine.". Asked if the unaccustomed pull of
Earth's gravity made them feel unexpectedly heavy, he replied: "Yes,
but it's like an embrace."
Doctors who examined the cosmonauts after their return said they had
coped well with the lengthy period of zero gravity, according to Tass, the
official Soviet news agency. The mission was designed to test the effect
of extended periods of weightlessness on the human body.
The mission, which began with a Feb. 8 blast-off, broke the previous
space endurance record of 211 days on Sept. 6. Tass said the cosmonauts
made 3,408 orbits and traveled 160 million kilometers (99.4 million
miles), or enough to have taken them to Mars and back again.
Stocks fall in moderate trading
NEW YORK — Stocks fell broadly in moderate trading for their third

issues. A few oil and mining stocks advanced.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny today with low clouds this morning. Today's high will be
in the 70s with the temperature dipping to a low in the 50s or upper 40s
tonight.

Soviet 'attack' order revealed
TOKYO — One afternoon in August, the Soviet Far Eastern military
headquarters suddenly dispatched a coded message, saying: "We now
embark on military action against the U.S. Forces," sources well in
formed on military affairs have disclosed here.
The sources, who declined to be identified, said what could have been
an order for a "surprise attack" on the U.S. was followed by another
message about 30 minutes later canceling the first one. The messages
came a day after the Soviet media reported President Reagan's joke
about bombing the Soviet Union.
The "war-declaring" message was monitored by both Japanese and
U.S. government facilities at about 4 p.m. on Aug. 15, said the sources.
It was confirmed to have been sent from Vladivostok to Ussurisk,
where a Soviet special command unit is stationed, the sources said. The
Japanese and U.S. governments, greatly alarmed by the message, part of
which had been sent in non-coded words, consulted with each other to
ascertain the situation.
During the half-hour period before the second message, however, nei
ther government detected any unusual moves by Soviet forces.
Since the "zero-hour" dispatch was followed by the cancellation
message, it ended up as a secret "grave incident" known in Japan only to
a handful of high government officials, including Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone and some Defense Agency and Foreign Ministry of
ficials, the sources said.
The 30-minute period between the first and second telegrams "was
the longest time in history," the sources said in describing the tenseness
of Japanese and the U.S. officials after the Soviet "war-opening" dis
patch.
According to the sources, Japanese and U.S. government officials now
believe the message most likely was sent in retaliation for Reagan's joke
about "outlawing" and "bombing" the Soviet Union.
Philippino military criticized
MANILA, Philippines — The Roman Catholic leader of the
Philippines accused the military establishment yesterday of engaging in a
"saturnalia of sadism and violence" and urged widespread participation
in peaceful demonstrations against the government of President Fer
dinand Marcos.
Cardinal Jaime Sin, the archbishop of Manila and a frequent critic of
the president, decried what he termed a "moral dry rot" in the country
and called for a "storm of non-violent protest."
Angered by recent violent clashes between police and soldiers on the
one hand and anti-government protesters on the other. Sin, speaking to
a group of accountants, attacked military leaders as "trigger-happy" and
"power-hungry."
He praised student demonstrators, telling the accountants that "their
fight should also be your fight." And he called on business leaders to
join demonstrators in what has come to be known here as the
"parliament of the streets" to pressure Marcos for change.
