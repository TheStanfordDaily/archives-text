## Ortega predicts U.S. attack 
### 
UNITED NATIONS
Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega
accused the United States yesterday
of planning to invade his country in a
military operation beginning Oct. 15
and said Nicaraguans will "fight to
the end" against any such interven
tion. Reagan administration spokes
men immediately dismissed the
charge as nonsense.
In a speech before the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly and at a later news
conference, Ortega said he believes
the administration is bent on over
throwing his leftist regime. He also
left the door open for a possible com
promise on the key issue of postpon
ing Nicaragua's Nov. 4 presidential
election, a demand made by opposi
tion parties and the United States,
But in Rio de Janeiro, a Sandinista
official said negotiations toward a
postponement with the opposition
Democratic Coordinating Council
had failed. United Press International
reported.
"I can tell you categorically that
Nicaragua will hold elections Nov. 4
and that sadlv the so-called Demo
cratic Coordinating Council will not
participate in these elections," Sandi

nista negotiator Bayardo Arce said.
Ortega, wearing a military uniform,
told the General Assembly, "The
military offensive is ready to begin
Oct. 15. Also ready are the U.S.
forces that would be used for bom
bings, troop landings and direct in
cursions into Nicaragua."
He said he expected the operation
to begin with attacks by CIA-directed
Nicaraguan rebels based in Honduras
and Costa Rica, followed by appeals
for U.S. intervention from the
Central American countries.
White House, State Department
and Pentagon spokesmen all denied
the charges. "Absolutely not true,"
said James Baker 111, the White
House chief of staff, traveling with
President Reagan to a campaign ap
pearance in Texas. "It is obviously
absurd," State Department spokes
man Alan Romberg said.
"The idea we're getting ready for
any takeover or invasion is utter non
sense," said Pentagon spokesman Mi
chael Burch. A senior State Depart
ment official discounted the speech as
"just propaganda," while another
source involved in talks with the San
dinistas said the speech "was a clumsy

move.
Nicaragua's Sandinista leaders,
who have allied themselves with the
Soviet Union and built Central
America's largest army during their
five years in power, are currently
negotiating on three fronts at once.
They are holding direct talks with
the administration, which has
demanded that they sever their ties
with Moscow and hold democratic
elections. Romberg said yesterday
that the United States expects those
talks to continue, despite Ortega's
rhetorical blast.
The Sandinistas are also participat
ing, with other Central American
countries, in negotiations toward a
regional security agreement — the
Contadora talks, named after the
Panamanian island where they began.
And they are negotiating with the
Democratic Coordinating Council's
presidential candidate, Arturo Cruz,
who has demanded that the
Nicaraguan election be postponed to
allow him time to campaign — a
demand supported by the administra
tion.
In previous statements, Ortega has
said the date of the election cannot be

changed. But in his news conference
yesterday, he steered away from
making a categorical answer. "As of
now, the election is set for Nov. 4,"
he said.
Nicaraguan opposition leaders
have said the Sandinistas agreed to
postpone the election — if the rebels,
known in Latin America as
"contras," stop fighting. Cruz, who
completed two days of negotiations
on the issue yesterday with Arce, said
he was willing to try to persuade the
rebels to declare a cease-fire.
In his speech to the assembly,
which won stronger applause from
delegates than President Reagan's
address last week, Ortega likened the
alleged U.S. plans for intervention in
Nicaragua to the invasion of Grenada
a year ago.
"They have the actors in their as
signed places, with their roles
memorized," he said. "Also drafted
are the estimates of U.S. casualties
during such an intervention. What
this amounts to is an attempt to
repeat the destructive and shameful
actions against Grenada."
