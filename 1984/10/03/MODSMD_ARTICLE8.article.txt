NEW YORK — Labor Secretary Raymond
Donovan and nine other people pleaded innocent
yesterday to stealing $8 million from New York
City on a subway construction contract awarded
two years before Donovan joined the Reagan ad
ministration.
Donovan — believed to be the first sitting
Cabinet member ever indicted — appeared in state
Supreme Court in the Bronx along with his nine
codefendants, who include a Democratic state
senator. All pleaded innocent to a 137-count in
dictment charging them with one count of grand
larceny, 125 counts of falsifying business records
and 11 counts of false filings.
The grand larceny charge carries a maximum
penalty on conviction of seven years in prison. The
other counts each carry four-year maximums.
The indictment also named as defendants the
Schiavone Construction Co. of Secaucus, N.J., of
which Donovan was executive vice president, and
Jopel Contracting and Trucking Corp. of the
Bronx, one of whose owners was the indicted state
senator, Joseph Galiber.
The indictment said the money was stolen from
the city Transit Authority, which gave a $186 mil
lion contract to Schiavone as the primary contrac
tor. Schiavone allegedly padded payments it made
to Jopel, a subcontractor.
"They engaged in a scheme whereby they filed
inflated, phony, false records with the Transit Au
thority," Bronx District Attorney Mario Merola
said.
Donovan said afterward that Merola "may have
won today's battle by the misuse of his office, but I
guarantee you that he will not win the war."
He said he was shocked to learn that none of the

questions he was asked during his appearance
before the grand jury last week related to the
charges in the 73-page indictment. "The indict
ment was obviously prepared before I testified," he
said.
The labor secretary, who came through two pre
vious investigations of his activities as executive
vice president of Schiavone, has maintained that
the indictment was the work of a Democratic dis
trict attorney playing politics.
"I've enjoyed four-party support," replied
Merola, who had Republican Party backing in
three of four runs for office.
"Nobody's above the law," he said at a news
conference after the arraignment. "We have a state
senator, a man who was my friend. . . . He's black
and he's a Democrat. We had to do what we had to
do."
Merola said the path to Donovan's indictment
was paved by the district attorney's office's investi
gation of two murders.
In a separate indictment, the grand jury indicted
William Masselli and another man for the 1978
slaying of Salvatore Frascone, who reportedly ob
jected to Jopel's getting subcontracting work with
Schiavone.
Masselli, the head of Jopel, also was one of those
indicted with Donovan.
Masselli's son, Nathan Masselli, was murdered in
August 1982, allegedly to prevent him from testify
ing about Donovan, who then was under investiga
tion by federal special prosecutor Leon Silverman.
Silverman later concluded his investigation with
a report saying there was no evidence on which to
prosecute Donovan of misdeeds while he headed
Schiavone.

President Reagan, who agreed to Donovan's re
quest Monday for a leave without pay while he
fought the charges, said he considered the 54-year
old Cabinet member innocent until proven guilty.
While campaigning in Texas yesterday, Reagan
answered questions about his embattled labor sec
retary during a news conference in Brownsville.
Reagan first said "there is a tradition in the law
of our land that's as old as this country, that you are
innocent until you're proven guilty, and Secretary
Donovan took the step of voluntarily absenting
himself. ..."
But when reporters said there was "hardly any
precedent" for having a Cabinet officer under in
dictment, Reagan turned his fire on his critics.
"I don't think there are many precedents for all
the attacks [andj assaults that have been made on
so many people of our administration with allega
tions and charges that were without any foundation
in fact; the people were cleared," Reagan said.
"There's a kind of lynch atmosphere in that."
Reagan declined, however, to endorse
Donovan's claim that the charges against the labor
secretary are politically inspired.
"He is the man who is charged, and I'm not going
to comment," Reagan said.
Despite the president's claim that Donovan had
decided voluntarily to ask for the leave, campaign
officials made no secret of the fact that they were
eager for him to do so.
White House Chief of Staff James Baker 111, who
was not available for comment yesterday, has des
cribed Donovan as "an embarrassment" to the ad
ministration and once unsuccessfully pressed
Reagan to fire him.
