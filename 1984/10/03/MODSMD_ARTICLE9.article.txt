## Socrates comes home 
### SALLY NEWTON 
Stanford students, faculty and staff
can now get free accounts on
Socrates, Stanford University Libra
ries' computerized catalog.
The accounts will be free on
weekends and holidays and from 6
p.m. to 6 a.m. on weekdays. Socrates
terminals are now in all branch li
braries.
Researchers with accounts on the
Information Technology Service's
IBM 3081 at Forsythe Hall can use
Socrates without being charged for
calls in the specified time periods.
Socrates contains records for all
books attained by Stanford since
1972, all serials and all materials in

Meyer Library.
The search catalog is "user
friendly": Each of the 30 terminals
has an instruction sheet nearby.
Socrates references books by author,
title or subject, and periodicals by the
magazine's title.
For research of fairly broad scope,
Socrates is a marvel; but for exotic re
search you may have to access your
professors instead. For example, if
you ask about "Holocene Mediter
ranean sea level fluctuations," you'll
get a question mark. But the inquiries
"Holocene" or "Mediterranean" will
elicit responses allowing the user to
narrow the field of inquiry.
In addition, a new function,

"browse," enables researchers to
check books in the general area of the
book they need.
Students, faculty and staff who
want to open a Socrates account
should bring their Stanford identifica
tion card to the public service desks
of any system library, Lane Medical
Library, the Jackson Graduate
School of Business Library, or the
Crown Law Library.
The Stanford University Libraries
system includes all libraries on
campus except those at the law, busi
ness and medical schools, the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, the
Hoover Institution and the Food Re
search Institute.
