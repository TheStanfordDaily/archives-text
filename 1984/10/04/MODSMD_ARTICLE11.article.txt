\read menus backwards, start
ing with dessert," confides
Mariel Hemingway, her coltish,
rawboned frame tucked into a
banquette at a Hollywood cafe.
"Dessert is my main interest.'
With her broad cheekbones,
heavy eyebrows and low
forehead conspiring to make
this lanky granddaughtei of the great
novelist Ernest Hemingway look like
some unusual combination of Swede
and Eskimo, 21-year-old Mariel Heming
way has nonetheless managed to start
the menu of life backwards, too. Sweet
things like film roles with world-class di
rectors and writers (Woody Allen, Bob
Fosse, Robert Towne), bon-bons like an
active love affair with a mucho hand
some leading man (Christopher Lam
bert), have already crossed her plate.
Her most recent morsel, following up
her praised portrayal of slain Playboy
Playmate Dorothy Stratten in Star '80, is
a co-starring slot alongside Peter
O'Toole and Vincent Spano in an up
coming comedy-drama called Creator.
In person, Hemingway is tall, speedy,
giggly and not quite either the ethereally
calm teenager she played in Woody Al
len s Manhattan or the world-class
athlete of Robert Towne's Persona! Best.
Were she not a movie star, she could be
the proverbial girl next door. Or, judg
ing from the cuts and bruises she sports
from her minor collisions with life, the
tomboy next door.
As Bob Fosse, her Star '80 director has
said of her, "she has a kind of innocence
without being dumb." It was also Fosse
who for a long time didn't think Hem
ingway had the sex or the sophistication
to play a Playboy model. Fortunately he
changed his mind, but meeting the real
Mariel you can see what he meant.
Though she is athletically attractive, she's
no classic beauty and her manners have
the charm and directness of her Idaho
small-town origins.
Says Hemingway herself, "The other
movies I'd done I was sort of playing
myself — I wasn't really but it's a great
compliment when audiences think you
are. Those movies weren't different
enough to show what 1 could do. I
wanted Star '80 so badly in order to
make a statement that 1 could do lots of

different stuff." She laughs and adds rue
fully, "It's real funny. Now Star '80 came
out, everyone thinks that's what I can do.
They never really believe you're an ac
tress, you know."
Hemingway is not only an actress, she
is also, literally, "a natural." One of three
daughters of Ernest Hemingway's son,
Jack, she grew up living the outdix)r life

with her father, a dedicated hunter,
fisherman and sports writer who taught
her to fish, dry fly method. "I had no de
sire to be an actress," she recalls. "At dif
ferent times I wanted to he a singer, a
marine biologist, a secretary." Margaux
Hemingway, Mariel's sister, was already a
well-known model and when Margaux
got her first film (Lipstick) she asked

Mariel to be in it with her. "Even after
that film, 1 really didn't think I'd do it
again. I went back to Idaho to ski race —
which was my passion for a long, long
time. Then I got a TV movie playing an
unwed mother. There were millions of
babies around and I was baby crazy at
the time. It was 18 days and I really
worked hard and I had the best time.
And then I did Manhattan with Woody
[Allen] and of course that was fabulous.
Those two experiences decided me.'
Now, Mariel says,"I love my work so
much I go crazy when I'm not working.'
She's also made recent preliminary steps
toward studying her craft. She's taken on
an acting coach "when I'm not working.
I tried acting classes but I didn't like all
that Method stuff. This way, it's just me
and him, and I go and read Shakespeare,
Chekhov, all the stuff I've never done.'
She also did her first play, in Dallas,
and I want to do it again and again and
again. It was so good for my voice. I
used to be quiet. I used to hide behind
my mother and everything as a kid. I was
desperately shy as a teenager. I used to
be a nightmare for the sound people —
they were always saying, can't you speak
up louder? That's all changing as you
can see."
She is especially happy with her new
film, Creator, because "I get to yell and
scream. I'm definitely not the victim in
this one." However, in the part-drama,
part-comedy about a scientist (Peter
O'Toole) who plays God, Mariel is once
again in risky sexual territory. In Man
hattan she was Allen's teenage mistress,
in Personal Rest an athlete involved in a
graphic lesbian affair, in Star '80 a nude
model and in Creator she's a college girl
trying to get the much older O'Toole
into bed. There's no question Heming
way's fresh looks and inner simplicity
make her effective in such roles. Her
frankness extends to her own life and
the May-September relationship she had
with Robert Towne, the top Hollywood
screenwriter who made his directing
debut with Personal Best.
"Robert and I didn't go out when we
were making Personal Best — in fact, he
was going out with (co-star) Patrice
Donnelly But I did live with him when I
was making Star '80. It's so incestuous
and awful. Isn't it fun? It never crossed
my mind when we were working to-

gether that we'd go out. I don't know
why we ever lived together. He works
through the night and I was filming all
day so we never saw each other —
perhaps that's why it worked so well. We
had such a close bond from the three
years of Personal Best and I didn't want
to lose that. Then of course, as soon as
Star '80 was over, I realized I hadn't
needed to move in. I've learned from
that. Now I don't move in with every
person I become attached to!"
Mariel won't comment on her current
relationship, reportedly with French
actor Christopher Lambert, who was
Tarzan in Greystoke and who was seen of
late squiring her around London, Ms.
Hemingway looking uncharacteristically
fashionable and elegant in a black silk
pantsuit. But there are plenty of things
she will talk about, like her new-found
celebrity in the wake of Star '80: "There
are a couple of things that really bother
me about it, like standing in line at the
grocery store, standing in line to buy
stamps and going to dance classes. The
dance classes always made me nervous,
actually. I always felt tall, even before
people recognized me. And standing in
lines is when you start to hear, 'Oh, I
think I know who she is '"
Part of her early shyness, Mariel feels,
had to do with being the great Heming

way's granddaughter. Though she was
born after he died and didn't read his
books until she was a teenager, she is a
knowledgeable and fierce partisan of her
grandfather's writing and she admits to
being "teased a lot at school. And can you
imagine having to hand in an essay with
the name 'Hemingway' on the bottom?"
But much more important was her self
consciousness about her looks. At 21, she
is confident and carefree, but an infal
lible way to get Mariel to revert to a
blushing teenager, holding a restaurant
napkin up in front of her face, is to tell
her she's pretty. "I'm not! And when
people tell me I am, it makes it worse. I
feel like a fake. When I was a teenager I
had a very bad period when I grew like
crazy — my legs got immensely long in
proportion to my body. And 1 had a
friend who was really beautiful all the
time. I'd try so hard. I'd get dressed up
to go out and my hair would be greasy
and messy so I'd wash it and style it. Five
minutes later, it was greasy and messy
again. I'm a natural scruff."
A natural scruff and a natural actress,
Hemingway is also a natural athlete. It
was seeing a photograph of her on a
trampoline that prompted Towne to cast
her in Personal Best and that led to a
year of intensive physical training "I
thought I was pretty athletic until I found

out what it takes to be a world-class
one," she says with a grin. Exercise re
mains a top priority in her life, so much
so that she's recently made a video of
her personal routine. "Please don't say
it's me competing with Jane Fonda. It's
just an alternative."
Hemingway remains close to her fam
ily but spends less and less time in
Idaho, where she passed a summer
building her own cabin with a group of
friends. Home now is a New York
apartment and she has to keep in touch
by phone with Margaux in Los Angeles
and third sister Muffet who's "a cook and

w rites cookery books" and who stayed
in Idaho.
Working on Creator with director Ivan
(Cutter's Way) Passer and O'Toole has
been a thrill for Mariel "because Peter is
legendary. I was so nervous. 1 didn't
know what to expect. But it turned out
great. He'll try anything. He'll go and
make such a fool of himself and then
he'll make it work. He's taught me to be
freer in what I do."
For his part, Creator screenwriter
Jeremy Leven sums up the feelings of
the production people when he says,
Mariel was a surprise and is a continuing
surprise. She's a superb actress —as far
as I'm concerned the most underrated
young actress around."
Mariel Hemingway is not likely to be
underrated for much longer. Besides,
she feels "the fact that it has been sort of
slow for me has been good. Apart from
Manhattan, my movies haven't been
huge boxoffice hits and that's been OK.
To live up to a really big movie is hard.
I've worked with strong directors and
I've been lucky that at least two of them
— Robert Towne and Bob Fosse — are
the kind of people who do keep in
touch and do continue the relationship
after the film is finished, which is very
unusual in this business. Some nice
projects are coming to me now and I'm
getting excited. For a long time, not
much came in because no one knew if
I could play a woman or if I was still a
teenager. Star '80 sort of settled that."


You can take the girl out of Idaho,
but country-bred Mariel Hemingway
will always be a Sawtooth Mountains
gal at heart.
