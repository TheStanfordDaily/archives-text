# THE
						IMPORTANCE OF GRANDPA ERNEST
## 
### 
He wrote of people living dangerous lives. His style was
sparse. His theme was stoic courage, expressed in tales
of resolute soldiers, bum-luck athletes, aged fishermen
and, quintessentially, bullfighters. Ernest Miller Heming
way, born in July of 1898, committed suicide in July of
1961, well before Mariel Hemingway was born to his son
Jack. He saw life as war; perhaps, with his self-inflicted
shotgun blast, he believed he was refusing to surrender
though he couldn't continue to fight. He had once said,
speaking of his many stories about bullfighters, '> was trying to learn to write,
commencing with the simplest things, and one of the simplest things and the
most fundamental is violent death."
Because his style is so unadorned that it can, quite on purpose, approach
monotony, Hemingway has collected his share of critical horse-laughs.
Nevertheless, he is among the most powerful and influential writers in Ameri
can history. His plots and dialogue were highly original and his psychological
observation acute. Some of the delight in reading Hemingway's novels and
short stories comes from realizing how much freight his tight, economical con
structions carry. His first novel was The Sun Also Rises (1926), his first book
was In Our Time (1924). A Farewell to Arms (1929) drew on Hemingway's expe
riences while serving with the Italian infantry during World War I (his exploits in
that war won the author decorations for valor). For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940),
another war novel, draws on the Spanish Revolution and may be Hemingway's
best. If any of the above sound cinematically familiar, along with other titles like
The Old Man and the Sea, To Have and Have Not and Islands in the Stream,
you have just recognized Ernest as the first Hemingway to make a splash in
Hollywood.


First Hemingway in Hollywood. Novelist and short story writer Ernest
Hemingway sold a wealth of his tales to the film industry.
