# Pachyderms and Asses
## POLLS APART 
### 
Trying to figure out whether or not — deep down—you're a liberal
or conservative? Palms getting sweat}' over the prospect of choosing
sides this election year? Drinking yourself half to death trying to
figure out whether Fritz 'n' Gerry or Ronnie 'n' George should be in
charge of spending the nation into bankruptcy over the next four
years? Is that what's bothering you, Bunky?
Then lift your head up high, square back your shoulders and take a walk
in the sun! Polls Afxirt —A Handy Guide to Knowing Your Ass from Your
Elephant is the book for you. Covering such political necessities as sports,
suicide, money, kissing, stupid lawn decorations, booze, art scandal and play
ing the ponies, Polls Apart humbles not only such "serious" books of political
nonfiction as The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, All the President's Men and
Hall Four but—what with almost one hundred cleverly etched cartoons — has
a leg up on such American fictioln giants as Moby Dick and Marjorie Morning
star as well.
That's right Strange as it may seem, there are no cartoons in Moby DicJe —
quite a missed opportunity. However, the cartoonery of Polls Apart, rendered
by sometime Ampersand contributor Bill Plvmpton, is classically frantic and
the prose is a lot more digestible than Melville's. In fact, the prose is essen
tially a string of captions for visual jokes. Polls Apart is one of those "concept'
books that will be found near the cash register, priced at 2-1/2 times the cost
of a greeting card. The publisher has referenced it handily as "Humor/
Politics," but Polls Apart is really for people who see the two entities as one.
Or maybe that's meant to be read "Humor Slash Politics," which actually
sounds like a good idea.
