## OXYGEN-RICH STUDY STYLE 
### CLAIRE-FRANCE PEREZ 
Do you catch yourself yawning whenever you try to study late 1
into the night, cramming for next-day exams? Then you're
suffering from student fatigue. Whether you drop off to sleep or jj
continue yawningly on through a bleary-eyed reading of Ab- J
salom, Absalom, Kinship Studies Among Kapauku Papuans fl
or whatever, your exams (or deadlines) will arrive precisely jm
as scheduled. Believe it or not, though, light exercise and fl
smart clothing can help you alleviate those bouts with fatigue, fl
Here's why: M
During an extended study session your attention span fl
shortens with each yawn. You yawn because your body is fl
screaming for more oxygen. Your brain wants that precious jfl
metabolism-stirring stuff in order to stay alive and perky. Ul- fl
timately, oxygen deprivation can cause brain death —which fl
can often be observed in graduate students. Yawning, or m
even deep breathing, will likely not be enough to re-prime fl

your mental
pump. You need to
move, increase your heartbeat and

invigorate the pulsing of blood (and hence oxy
gen) to your brain. Fortunately, there are ways and means
for inserting an exercise dose into your study regimen without appre
ciably slowing your reading rate. In other words, here's how to take a study
break while you study onward.
One component of the plan — not indispensible but certainly an asset — is a
modern chair design. It's been copied, but the original (as shown in our photos)
is called the "Balans" chair, a design of Svein Gusrud. It distributes body weight
differently and allows you to sit with your legs at a more open angle to your trunk
— about 120 degrees instead of 90 degrees. Thus, blood flow between upper
and lower body is less constricted. Additionally, it is easier to squirm about and
move your upper body for exercise.
The need for increased oxygen in the blood can also be met with upper body
exercise. A set of small weights — such as the Joe Weider concept shown in the
accompanying photos—can be kept in a nearby drawer, handy for an exercise
break between chapters. Or even during a chapter, if you feel you can't spare a
minute of reading time. Weider's kit includes pulls that attach right to the door
knob, affording a taste of gymnasium even in a dinky dorm room.
The study break when you need to get serious should be a five-to-twenty
minute spurt of energy, followed by five minutes of deep breathing. Keep the
weights (a couple of soup cans will do if your bank account's anemic at present)
near you at the desk. Keep reading and begin to breath slowly and deeply. In
time with your breathing, flex your arms (weights in hand) out and in repeatedly.
With a spare corner of your soon-to-be-gratified brain, use the athlete's trick of
visualizing a positive result from your endeavors. A positive mental image can
produce a hairline of difference. Sometimes, as you've probably learned, grades
can swing on a hairline of difference in your performance.
For a positive image in your outer appearance, to match your inner image, try
something like the designed-for-activity clothing pictured on these pages. How
will that help? Again, thorough circulation and deep breathing are the goals.
Loose, attractive clothing meets the need. It doesn't create the constriction that
tight clothing can when you are seated. Well-designed activewear not only liber
ates your waist, neck, legs and arms, it also appeals to your sense of self. And, if
you keep on yawning, at least you'll look a lot better doing it.
