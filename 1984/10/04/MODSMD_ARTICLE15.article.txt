i"W" had an undeclared major in the
i :.| Liberal Arts,'' admits fashion de
i -:| signer Tracy Hansen, one of a

| i California fashion sensation
JL called Chihuahua! back in 1980.
None of this team had any inkling of
what they would do when they "grew
up." A friendship took their careers an
unusual route — no interviews in per
sonnel offices or answering of news
paper ads.
Debbie Moore, now thirty, is the quar
tet's textile designer, responsible for the
eyepopping printed designs that impel
Chihuahua! fashions into the closets of
renegade trendlovers. Moore allows her
skills are self-taught. "I go for the thing

that keeps me the most entertained," she
says. Although she is involved in the cur
rent primitive trend, Moore says her up
coming collections will evolve beyond it.
The Chihuahua! (pronounced Chee
wa-wa) group originally started as an
energetic foursome of friends. Katrine
Thomas (now 27), the business manager,
planted the seed when she suggested to
then-painter Moore her work might sell
better if it were printed on a t-shirt.
Moore, then 26, disagreed. It was the
first business conflict that occurred be
tween the not-vet-partners, but the so
lution was a creative blend of art and
management.
Moore explains, "It would have in
volved too many colors for our collec
tive $80, so we just took another route.'
Narrowing the colors to just simply
black, the entrepreneurial pair em
barked on their first product: hearts, re
styled into a leopard print, for Valen-

tine's Day.

"Suddenly we
wound up in busi
ness," recalls Moore

Enter Tracy Hansen,

then 22 years old. Her primi

tive-inspired clothing shapes were

the fashion influence that blasted
Thomas and Moore's t-shirt origins into
ancient history. Hansen's daring sil
houettes won the new trio respect and
attention from the retail world. Stores
could now earn,' a whole line instead of
unrelated items.
What might have continued as a flurry
of fashion self-indulgence was carried
back down to earth by the fourth new
partner ir the group: the level-headed
Teresa Haedt. Her pricing and produc
tion talents shaped the company's profit
structure and led the balance sheets to
financial solvency.
Tracy Hansen remembers being
warned about the potential grief of
going into business with friends. Yet, she
says, "Starting out as friends and ending
up in business is great. In spite of the
fear factor' there is a sense of unity that
never knew what that fear was."
Hansen summarizes the difference be
tween their friendship and their profes
sional relationships: "The personal rela
tionship and the personal obligation
and responsibility are the same thing.
Conflicts aren't a threat to the consen
sus, they are a normal function of a cre
ative business."

Claire-France Perez, a fashion writer and
former editor of Apparel News, knows a
sharp look when she sees one.
