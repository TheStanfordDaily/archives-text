### JANEY MILSTEAD 
HERE COME
THE GOONIES
Steve Spielberg has dreamed
up another critter, and it'll
be cavorting before the cam
eras this fall for a movie to
be released next summer. It's
called a Goony, and since there
are plenty of the little (big? —
no one knows, thanks to Ste
ven's famous secret network of
workers who don't blab) what
evers, the title of the film will
be Goonies. Richard Donner of
Superman fame will direct and
co-produce this further dip
into Spielberg's kid-at-heart
imagination. The word from
the front is that Goonies is a
young person's adventure for
people of all ages, and that it
definitely isn't a sequel to
Gremlins or a creature feature.
Spielberg is also working
toward his third (and final,
sob) Indiana Jones epic, and
also his much-discussed Peter
Pan. With so many of the
"teen" movies peopled by ac
tors who haven't been teens
recently, Steven promises Peter
will be played by a boy around
12 years old. "No five o'clock
shadow," swears Captain
Steve.

In his spare time (ha), Spiel
berg will head a weekly TV
project set to debut in the fall
of '85. Titled Amazing Stories,
it'll be a weekly half-hour an
thology 0f... you guessed it...
amazing stories! Part of the
idea fodder will come from a
magazine (Amazing Tales)
that's been around since the
winter of 09 (actually 1926)
and now belongs to Universal.
The rest of the goodies will
come from SS's amazing head.

Stories are still filtering in
about the Jackson's Victory
tour and it was truly a biggie,
but a lot of the tales concern
Michael's propensity for going
out in disguise in nearly every
town and bringing Jehovah to
the wicked in the Witnesses'
own inimitable style. My fave is
the story of him going out as
himself and everyone thinking
he was an MJ dress-alike and
that this worked so well, he
went on doing it and was never
recognized. I've
interviewed

Michael several times, but not
since he became a star's star
and loosened himself from the
earthly bonds of reporters ...
Congrats to Hill St. Blues and
St. Elsewhere for their Emmys
and to the television industry
for voting for the best, not the
most successful ... Tom Selleck
was in Vancouver (see what 1
mean?) finishing up his Run
away movie when his Magnum
buddies John Hillerman, Roger
Mosley and Larry Manetti each
received a very special present
from Mr. Dimplecheeks himself
—would you believe a Porsche?
... Jonathan Demme's film of
the Talking Heads concert tour,
Stop Making Sense, has a dis
tributor and will open in New
York and Los Angeles before
Thanksgiving, followed by a
major cities release around
Christmas ... I had dinner on
the set of the now-hot Karate
Kid with Ralph Maccio and the
teens who played The Cobras,
and it was quite a night! The
caterers were serving steak and
lobster, not bad for location

fare, but Ralph passed on the
lobster. He was on a very strict
diet-plus-exercise to look lean
and mean for the Karate se
quences ... If you're into Trivial
Pursuit, there's a reference
book on the market to help you
dazzle them with your foot
work. By Avon, it's called Trivial
Conquest and sells for a whop
ping 1995.

PARANOIA GAZETTE
Are you ready to worry about
Cabbage Patch Dolls? The
government fears that some
folks who aren't exactly living
dolls will use those cute birth
certificates to put the dolls on
welfare!! ... In Beverly Hills,
they've just opened a Caviar
Bar where you can buy a bit of
your own roe to hoe, plus a sip
of champagne for as low as $5!
I ask you, where else could this
happen? ... Prince Charles is
seriously thinking of becoming
a vegetarian (no more steak
and kidney pie? Tut) and
Princess Di is already practi
cally a veggie (so to speak). ...
Did you know that Michael
Jackson's nickname amongst
his intimates was Smelly? No,
he doesn't smell, but he does
have a habit of saying "smelly
jelly" when a song sounds
good to him ... Cindy Williams
and her husband Bill Hudson
(of the Hudson Brothers) are
readying a joint television ven
ture in the form of a series for
NBC ... Great Quotes: How's
this one from Pia Zadora's hus
band, Meshulam Riklis — "1
consider that I was put on this
earth to serve women." Does
anyone have this guy's phone
number? I'd like a Salade
Nicoise and a gin and tonic.
Poolside, please.
