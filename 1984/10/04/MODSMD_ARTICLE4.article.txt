This Ampersand of the
Month is a joint effort,
even though Dan Levine of
Syracuse University did it all
by himself. Boning up on the
principles of illusory art in
Professor Alex White's Visual
Communication class, Levine
fractured our staff with his ef
fort. A $30 prize is his. Want
to get a leg up on your own
art career? Send us your fresh
concept of an ampersand, ren
dered in black ink on sturdy
white paper: Ampersand of
the Month, 1680 N. Vine,
Suite 900, Hollywood, CA
90028.
