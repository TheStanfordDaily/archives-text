There are about nine million movies in the
making (a slight exaggeration, perhaps),
some for release around Christmas '85, and
here goes with a list of sorts. Fast Foncard,
directed by Sidney Poitier, is the story of 8
young kids from Ohio who go to New York
to be dancers, and the rest is history- (and
herstory). Franc Roddam of Quadrophenia
has taken on a project starring Jeannifer Beals
and Sting. Called The Bride, it's a re-telling,
but not a re-make, of the Bride of Franken
stein. Although it's not a rock movie, it will
have music, but it still isn't for sure that Sting
will participate in that end. Sting was also in
Quadrophenia, a mv-t-fine British rock film
of a few years past. White Knight, starring
Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines (al
right!) along with Ingrid Bergman's daughter
Isabella Rossellini, is helmed by Taylor (An
Officer and a Gentleman) Hackford and isn't
a dance movie, a musical or a comedy. (Okay,
that's fine with us.) The success of Purple

Rain from Prince has given birth to five more such projects. One will be a second feature
starring Prince, and Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire and Ray Parker will be featured
in two more.
Since there really are almost nine million movies in production, let's take a shorter form
and see if we can't turn you on to what to expect from your neighborhood screens. The
following are in production: Sylvester (working title), starring Melissa Gilbert (film debut) and
Richard Farnsworth â€”an old rodeo horse is retrained for Olympics '88 ... Big Trouble, star
ring those famous in-laws (out-laws?) Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, also Beverly D'Angelo and
John Cassavetes ... Tlx- Mean Season, with Kurt Russell and Mariel Hemingway ... Eddie
Murphy as Beverly Hills Cop (the movie Sylvester Stallone was too tantrum-prone to make) ..
Timothy Hutton's latest, Turk 182 ... Mask starring Cher and Sam Elliott ... Ray Sharkey and
Marjoe Gortner in Hell Hole ... Ridley Scott's very secretive Legend with Tom Cruise ... Oz,
via Disney, not an animated feature and not a re-make or a re-telling, another of the adven
tures from the Oz books ... Jodie Foster and John Lithgow in Mesmerized . . Silver Bullet
from shockathon scribe Stephen King, not to mention his Cat's Eye ... Steven Guttenberg in
Cocoon .. F.nemy Mine starring Dennis Quaid and Lou Gossett Jr. ... Sylvester Stallone's First
Blood II (second blood? Oh, never mind) ... The Howling 11, Police Academy 11, Electric
Boogaloo Is Breakin' II (with Shabba Doo and Boogaloo Shrimp, who else?), Porky's Revenge
and Meatballs, 111 ... Gary Busey in Insignificance ... Turtle Diary with Ben Kingsley and
Glenda Jackson ... C. Thomas Howell in Secret Admirer ... Miracles, starring Tom Conti, Terri
Garr and Paul Rodriguez ... Richard Pryor in Brewster's Millions ... Two famous fictional
characters coming to the screen are Chevy Chase as that vers' strange "detective" Fletch, and
Birdy, starring Nicholas Cage and Matthew Mondine ... Tatum O'Neal and Irene Cara are
working together in A Certain Fury, one of many flicks being shot in Vancouver, 8.C., as are
Sissy Spacek and Kevin Kline in Violets Are Blue, which was lensed in sumptuous Venice, Italy,
and Kathleen Quinlan and Sam Waterston in Biobazard
