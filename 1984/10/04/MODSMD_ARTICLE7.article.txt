I bet one of the main rules of hunting is, "Don't shoot any
animai that is hitching a piggyback ride on your friend."
Here's a good magic trick: Ask somebody to pick a num
ber between one and ten. Then, run away.
I guess of all my uncles, I liked Uncle Cave Man the best.
We called him Uncle Cave Man because he lived in a cave,
and because sometimes he'd eat one of us. Later on we
found out he was a bear.
Greed, Hypocrisy and Stupidity were all walking down the
road when they came to a beautiful forest.
"Oh, boy," said Greed, "I think /-"
All of a sudden, Murder ran up and shot all of them.
The place was teeming with fish. And I was teeming with
desire to catch them. But there would be no fishing today
This was Pop Teeming's property.
I hope that someday man is able to realize his age-old
dream of farming on a comet, because ummm, I bet comet
corn would be good.
Don't laugh, but I used to be real afraid of trains, but I think
I'm finally over it. For instance, I was afraid of taking a nap
on the railroad tracks, and I was afraid to hop on the
locomotive as it went by. I was even afraid of tying pillows
around myself and letting the train hit me.
I'm glad this fear of trains is behind me, because now I
can get on with my life. ,
If I was a surfer, I'd surf right up next to another surfer and

Mart a said she once kissed the ring of the bishop. "That's
nothing," I said. "Once I kissed the ass of a millionaire."
Sometimes Marta thinks she's so smart.
Innocence is like a young deer, nibbling at some acorns.
Your kid walks up to feed him, but suddenly, the deer grabs
your kid by the neck of his Superman shirt and drags him
off into the woods. You chase after them, but then a gang
of deer comes out. They flap those big deer ears across
your face, and man, it stings!
So, you give up and go back to your car, and hope your
kid is raised by a nice deer family. About a year later, you
hear some hunters bragging about shooting a Superman
deer, but naw, it's not him.
