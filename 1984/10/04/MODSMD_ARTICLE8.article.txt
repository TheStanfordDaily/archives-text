Part One: Beatles
Whipped with Spoons
It's hard, it's always hard
I the first time," says Paul
M.McCartney. "I remember
when we were starting out, I
mean the Beatles, we didn't get
it right the first time either. This
ballroom dancing scene in the
film reminded me of that and
took me back a bit. We used to
play ballrooms a lot you know.
"They were never as grand as this,"
McCartney gazes up at the sound stage at
Ellstree Studios, outside London. It is an
elaborate recreation of London's historic
Lyceum Ballroom—great swags of pink
velvet and ornate splashes of gold paint.
On the dance floor, formation dancers in
pink tulle dresses remove their pumps

problem with the camera which is on ?.
crane is sorted out. McCartney, in a
fifties-style bright blue drape suit and
black and white winkle-picker shoes re
calls, "I remember we once nearly won
a competition at one of them; but it was
always nearly' and 'almost.' We always
got beaten by this woman who played
the spoons. An old lady who used to

come tt) all the concerts and enter all the
contests and play old favorites with a
bunch of spoons. She always used to
beat us," Paul laughs.
"Even the blonde girl in this scene
reminds me of a bird me and Ringo
once tried to pull." Ringo, in blue drapes
and dark glasses, is perched up behind
his drums on the bandstand. He gives
the drums a riff. Paul looks up and
smiles and excuses himself and makes
his way to the piano. John Paul Jones,
Led Zeppelin's bass guitarist and the
legendary Dave Edmunds and Chris
Spedding originally of Rock Pile (all in
the film) pick up their instruments and
start jamming. The sound filters through
and technicians on a break come round
to listen. Steven Spielberg, filming on
a neighboring set, stops work to take
in this creme de la creme British rock
session.
Par* Two? Twist and Shoot
Twenty years after A Hard Day's Night
and Help Paul McCartney is back before
the movie cameras, writing, starring in
and generally supervising his own $8
million musical Give My Regards to
Broad Street (a Beatle-style pun on Give
My Regards to Broadway substituting the
name of a shabby London commuter sta
tion). It's the latest twist in the career of
the world's most successful pop com
poser — as certified by the Guinness
Book of Records — and one of the
world's richest entertainers. The "cutest
Beatle" is now 42, his baby-faced gtx>d
looks vitually intact, fit and healthy from
the simple rural life he and his wife
Linda enjoy, though with a few flecks of
grey in his fashionably cut hair. Says
McCartney, "I took turning -*0 as a cue to
do different things. There are millions of
things I've been interested in in my life
and never done, one of which happened
to be to write a screenplay. I'd enjoyed
making The Beatles' films all those years
ago and I had it in the back of my mind
that I'd like to get back into the film
world. "
While making the Tug of War al
bum with producer George Martin,
McCartney found himself being driven
from his Sussex farm to London and
back even- day. Since the trip took a
couple of hours each way and the album
was a year in the making, McCartney de



Maybe he's amazed:
Paul McCartney (above),
of Beatles and Wings
fame, says filmmaking
gives him new Impetus.
HI HI HI: John Salthouse,
• Unda and Paul
McCartney and
Ttocey Utlman ( rightJ.
cided to use the time to write.
"1 stocked the car with pads and pens
and made a start. I was always scared of
writing. 1 was never any good at it, even
in school, so I began just trying to write
a dav in the life of Paul McCartney' son
of thing. Then I heard a story about the
Sex Pistols having the master tapes of
their first album go missing and that
started me thinking."
As it stands Broad Street concerns an
international pop star (played by
McCartney) who has worked for a year
on a new album when the master tapes
vanish, perhaps stolen by an ex-convict
he's taken pity on and given a job. Ringo
who was working on Tug of War with
Paul read the script and loved it. "Great,"
said Paul, "because I've written a pan for
you in it." Ringo and his wife, actress
Barbara Bach, were among the first to
sign on for the film. Record producer
George Martin (sometimes known as
"The Fifth Beatle" because of his influ
ence with the group's records) plays
himself. Australian actor Bryan Brown
( Breaker Morant') plays Paul's shrewd
Australian manager (echoes of Steve
Shrimpton, Paul's real Australian man
ager?). There are 14 songs in the film
ranging from Lennon/McCartney favor
ites like "Good Day Sunshine" and
"Eleanor Rigby" to "Band on the Run"
and "So Bad" to some new songs written
especially for the film.
Part Three: Sharp Words
McCartney is well aware of the criti
cisms that have been levelled at him and
at his music since the Beatles broke up:
that he is manipulative and hypocritical,
that his songs are sentimental and super
ficial. "It does annoy me when jour
nalists write about me as if 'oh, isn't he
the sharp one.' I remember one day
when we were having arguments in The
Beatles. I said something and as it hap
pens I was in the right. John (Lennon)
turned around and said 'well you're al
ways right aren't you?' But he still did it
his way. It was shocking to me because
suddenly I though, 'oh god, I've always
thought it was okay just to be right.
Someone's wrong, someone's right and
we go with who's right. But sometimes it
isn't enough to be right and it was a
shock to me having to learn that.
"I'm not trying to be the clever one
these days at all. I really try to avoid it
like mad, in fact. I mean, people do get a
very wrong impression of me. If they're
feeling bitchy, they'll categorize me as
the schmaltzy one. I don't mind if they
call me romantic or sentimental."
Talking about himself, McCartney can
be his own worst enemy. He's not nearly
as conventional as he sounds but he
doesn't have the way with words that
John Lennon had that made his own
domesticity seem like the ultimate in

rock rebellion. The facts are that Paul, of
all the ex-Beatles, has tried hardest to
remain true to the old rock and roll.
When the Beatles broke up, the formed
Wings with his wife Linda and guitarist
Denny Laine, packed them in the back of
a transit van and set off on an ad hoc
tour of Britain, turning up at colleges
unannounced and asking if he could
play for them for free. It was back to
basics with a vengeance and as a result
McCartney says, "we couldn't' believe it
when Wings became successful. There'd
been tremendous criticism of Linda
being in the group (Linda McCartney, a
professional photographer before she
met Paul, had no musical training). We'd
formed Wings on a whim, we'd done it
on vibes."
Part Four: Bandleader
on the Run
Whatever its origins, Wings was the be
ginning of McCartney's staggeringly suc
cessful solo career. He's always been a
perfectionist and a workaholic. As
George Martin observed on 'Broad
Street.' "I couldn't stand the pace Paul
goes. He gets up incredibly early in the
morning, he drives two hours to and
from Sussex to the studios, he acts all
day. During lunchtime he's talking about
problems on the film with one person
or another, every evening he's having
discussions with the director or the pro
ducer. He's involved in every aspect."
"Obviously it's easier for me to make
a film or do some big project that it
would be for the average person," says
McCartney who pumped $100 thousand
of his own money into Broad Street be
fore 20th Century Fox took over the
financing. "That's one of the terrific
things about my life. It's one of the
things you work and become successful
for even though you may not realize it.
When you get money, you don't just
stop, so there must be something else. I
think it's this kind of thing. The freedom
of action, the freedom to change your
direction professionally a little."
Though he has collaborated with the
best, like Stevie Wonder on "Ebony and
Ivory" and Michael Jackson, McCartney's
name is forever linked with John Len
non. Though their relationship degener
ated into bitter squabbles after the Bea
tles broke up, Lennon's murder in 1980
hit Paul hard.
"On a purely selfish level it affected
my composure in public places. You
begin to be wary of getting into close
quarters with fans. When soijie kid
reaches into his pocket for a pen or a bit
of paper, you tense and want to ease
away. That passes with time to some ex
tent. What will never pass is the personal
sadness. I'm just grateful that the last
words we had together were pretty de
cent. That means a lot to me."
