# Board mixed on ASSU rule
## Pub Board reps meet 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Members of the Publications Board met last night for a
brief administrative meeting where Chairman David
Gregor explained the recent ASSU action which reduced
the Pub Board's control over its budgetary process.
The ASSU Senate last week decided to allow only two
representatives of the Publications Board to sit on the
Finance Committee, the group that will now unilaterally
design the Pub Board's annual budget.
The legislation originally drew criticism from some stu
dents who thought this put too much control into the
hands of the senators.
But Gregor said that when the new situation was dis
cussed, board members expressed little opposition.
"There was really no opposition to it because we still
have two members on the committee, and for now, it's
just a wait-and-see situation," Gregor said.
7.0e Sutton, who represents the Women's Guide, and
Karen Adams, who represents the ASSU Course Guide,
will be the two Publications Board members on the
Finance Committee.
Sutton said the ASSU action "should reduce a lot of the
haggling that went on last year over which student
publications should get more funds.
"At least now, it won't be the groups that are at stake
that will be arguing over the allotments, and it can be dis
cussed at a higher level," Sutton said.
Shirish Date, editor of The Stanford Daily, said the
ASSU action would probably have no effect on the news
paper.
"For all intents and purposes, we are independent from
the Pub Board since we are covered by a $50,000 fee
assessment," Date said.
Date said the ASSU action left the Publications Board

with less control over the allocation
of funding.
"You're going to have fewer
people who really know what it's like
to run a publication making the deci
sion," Date said.
Gregor, a writer for the Chaparral,
said the change would "probably not
make a difference because the Ap
propriations Committee and the Sen
ate still have the power to revise the
budgets.
"The big test will come in January
during the general funding cycle,"
Gregor said. "That's when everyone
goes after their yearly allocation of
funds, and 1 guess that will be the
power play."
Jim McGrath, the ASSU graduate
senator who supported the revamping
of the Finance Committee, said the
change would make the "technical
part of the funding process much
smoother."
"One, we'll be able to do a better
technical job, and two, the board
members will have their act together
since they'll only have two represen
tatives and they'll probably have a
more effective say over their alloca
tions," McGrath said."
