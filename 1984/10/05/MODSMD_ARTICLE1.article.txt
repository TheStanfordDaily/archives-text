# Board mixed on ASSU rule
## Pub Board reps meet 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Members of the Publications Board met last night for a
brief administrative meeting where Chairman David
Gregor explained the recent ASSU action which reduced
the Pub Board's control over its budgetary process.
The ASSU Senate last week decided to allow only two
representatives of the Publications Board to sit on the
Finance Committee, the group that will now unilaterally
design the Pub Board's annual budget.
The legislation originally drew criticism from some stu
dents who thought this put too much control into the
hands of the senators.
But Gregor said that when the new situation was dis
cussed, board members expressed little opposition.
"There was really no opposition to it because we still
have two members on the committee, and for now, it's
just a wait-and-see situation," Gregor said.
7.0e Sutton, who represents the Women's Guide, and
Karen Adams, who represents the ASSU Course Guide,
will be the two Publications Board members on the
Finance Committee.
Sutton said the ASSU action "should reduce a lot of the
haggling that went on last year over which student
publications should get more funds.
"At least now, it won't be the groups that are at stake
that will be arguing over the allotments, and it can be dis
cussed at a higher level," Sutton said.
Shirish Date, editor of The Stanford Daily, said the
ASSU action would probably have no effect on the news
paper.
"For all intents and purposes, we are independent from
the Pub Board since we are covered by a $50,000 fee
assessment," Date said.
Date said the ASSU action left the Publications Board
