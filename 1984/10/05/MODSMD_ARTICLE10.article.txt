## Streleski denied parole 
### 
VACAVILLE (AP) — Theodore
Streleski, who killed his Stanford
mathematics professor with a ham
mer eight years ago, was given six
more months in prison yesterday for
refusing to sign parole documents.
Streleski's refusal to sign a paper
outlining the conditions of his parole,
including staying away from Stanford,
demonstrates "that he is not prepared
and/or fails to accept the rules and
regulations that govern our society."
said Frank Coronado, a hearing offi
cer for the Board of Prison Terms.
He said he and another hearing of
ficer also based their decision on the
crime — "a cold-blooded, reprehen
sible, violent act — and on a prison
psychiatric report that "described
Streleski as having a great deal of
anger towards the University."
The two held the hearing on
Streleski's refusal Sept. 7 to sign the
parole paper. He had been scheduled

to be released the next day, but in
stead was kept at the California
Medical f'acility at Vacaville, the
state s prison for psychiatric and
medical cases.
I he bearded, long-haired
electronics engineer, who studied un
successfully for a mathematics doc
torate for 19 years at Stanford, con
tends the conditions are inappropri
ate and were imposed "solely because
ot public outcry," his attorney, Mike
McGowan, said.
Streleski, 48, was sentenced to
eight years for a second-degree mur
der conviction in the 1978 killing of
Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw.
State law in effect at the time made
him eligible for parole after five and
one-half years as long as he behaved
well in prison, which he has.
He was released last March, but
was returned to the California Medi
cal Facility within three hours for

refusing to sign routine documents.
A third parole violation next
March could bring one more six
month term, after which Streleski
must be freed without restrictions on
Sept. 8, 1985.
McGowan told the board that
Streleski originally had been sched
uled to be paroled last March in San
Francisco.
But last winter, a series of news ar
ticles, including ones in which
Streleski refused to express remorse
for the crime, led corrections officials
to change the parole conditions
"drastically and for no good reason,"
the attorney said.
The conditions are that Streleski
not enter the Stanford campus, not go
to Alameda, San Francisco, San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties, not
contact any Stanford faculty or
employees and that he attend mental
health clinics.
