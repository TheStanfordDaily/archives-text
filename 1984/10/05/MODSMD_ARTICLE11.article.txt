They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.
And then they tore up the parking lot. Now
they're paving the bowling alley to put up a com
puter center.
What's next?
It appears a cease-fire has been called now in
that war zone of a White Plaza, as the bulldozers
and hardhats move out to be replaced by a
peacekeeping force of students armed with back
packs and bermuda shorts.
But the troops aren't moving far: just over to
Checkpoint Charlie in front of Memorial Church,
where they're setting up another encampment.
"We'll have our boys home by November," they
say now. But we all know how long it takes to
have kitchen repair jobs done.
Back at the other front, a rapid deployment
crew of seabees is sparing nothing in striking
down the bowling alley, preparing first for the
computer invasion, then for either an expanded
Coffee House or Store, depending on whom you
ask.
The pacifists among us are a little shocked by
all this. "Give peace a chance," they say. Or,

"why wasn't this done over the summer?"
But now that the enemy has retreated from
White Plaza, the worst seems to be over. The
bowling alley will be the one tragic casualty in
this war, but the computer revolution can wait for
no man. It's a rescue mission, really, not an inva
sion, to save those queued up at LOTS during
Dead Week.
Any day now. University President Donald
Kennedy will step out of Building 10 to announce
that he's brought us "peace in our time."
But we've all heard that before, and it won't be
long before new battles break out on the Western
Front of campus, with Permaflex and a parking
garage and God knows what else. And, of course,
the ongoing war at the shopping center will con
tinue, with the area between Saks Fifth Avenue
and Macy's a hotbed at the moment.
Anything worth having is worth fighting for,
they've always told us. And in the end, we all
realize that the progress is necessary.
Somehow, though, this would all be easier to
take if we could find a way to blame Jimmy
Carter.
