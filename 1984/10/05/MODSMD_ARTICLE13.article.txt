## Fear and clothing on the career trail

flock of sorority sisters assembled in the Wil
bur parking lot for rush activities. I can dis
cern some color variation in their dresses, but
they are all garbed in an essentially identical
fashion.

If I attend the seminar, according to the ad,
my ability to cope with life in the real world
will be significantly enhanced.

VIEWPOINT

The preceding images are symptomatic of
an insidious disease that should be eradicated
with all possible haste — clothing confor
mities. Unfortunately, the adherents to this
viewpoint are not numerous enough to suit
me, and therefore I have decided to speak out
via my first Daily essay.
The subject that I have chosen as the topic
of my homily is one that attracts minima l at
tention and engenders minimal controversy in
1984. Dinner-time conversations are replete
with vitriolic debates about Nicaraguan har
bors and nuclear weapons, but nobody seems
to care about societal pressures to conform to
sartorial norms.
But I care. I care deeply. I've been a strong
believer in the foolishness of dress codes for
at least a decade; in recent months, however,
the real world has begun to impinge on yours
truly for the first time, and my disdain is turn
ing into disgust. After five weeks of govern
ment employment in Washington, D.C., I
>vant to throw all of my stylishly uncomfort
able clothing in the trash can. And so, in the
spirit of Voltaire's "Ecrasez l'infame," I am
commencing a campaign of preach
ing what I cannot easily practice.
• Now don't get me wrong — I'm not sug
gesting that three-piece suits and expensive
'dresses are inherently inferior articles of
fclothing. In fact, I will readily concede that

people often do "look their best" in them.
There's nothing bad about "nice" clothing.
I'm just protesting against the rigid imposition
of — and slavish adherence to — annoying
and often useless dress codes.
The situation is normally silly and barely
tolerable, at least when viewed from my
young and idealistic eyes. At times it becomes
indisputably ludicrous. What rational expla
nation can anyone offer in response to the
question of why people should wear suits and
ties on sticky summer days? I cannot think of
any. but clear thinking is shunted aside in the
professional world as upwardly mobile types
conform through every season. And in addi
tion to prevailing year-round, the codes reign
supreme worldwide. The ridiculous unifor
mity of uniforms is perfectly illustrated by the
observation that leaders of African Marxist
republics often dress just like-Fortune 500 ex
ecutives. Why do Robert Mugabe and the
others in his "revolutionary vanguard" feel
compelled to don the garments of the Wall
Street "capitalist opp -essors"?
I believe that there are only two good
reasons for wearing a particular piece of
clothing. Either the garment is functional
and/or it appeals to the person who wears it.
Blind devotion to entrenched custom is not
acceptable. It might be OK for sheep, but not
for thinking humans. Yet the intelligent
powers-that-be continue to cling to anti
quated notions of what constitutes tailored
respectability and desirability in the bourgeois
workplace. Has anyone glanced at old photos
and discovered that fomer President Har
dings' suits closely resemble President
Reagan's? If transportation, communications,
tools of destruction and many other things
have progressed so dramatically since the
Model T era, why can't our dressing habits do
the same?
Which brings me to a greater issue, if I may
digress for a moment. Most people fail to ap
preciate my complaints about clothing codes,

but I hope that nearly everyone recognizes
the evil of non-critical, conformist acceptance
of custom in general. Obviously, a common
practice may not be the correct one or the
best possible one; in addition, it should be
clear to all that progress, by definition, is in
compatible with an unquestioning love of
tradition and a fear of new ideas. There may
be some people who are completely and com
placently satisfied with the present state of the
world, but I for one am firmly convinced that

conference rooms of
the 'adult world' if we
come out of our
cocoons and start
complaining.

potential improvements on the status quo are
almost unlimited in number.
As I fantasize about dress code demolition
(digression over), I glumly acknowledge that
there are several formidable obstacles stand
ing in the progressive crusader's path. First,
there is the aforementioned predominance of
highly viscous custom.
Second, there is the problem of peer pres
sure. The most detrimental manifestation of
the herd mentality, of course, occurs among
persons who are too young to vote. Neverthe

less, a significant peer pressure component is
present in the clothing decisions of many
business-world adults. If everyone around me
is wearing pin-striped suits, the reasoning
goes, wouldn't 1 expose myself to horrible
scrutiny and isolation if I were to wear tennis
clothes to the office?
Third, the widespread practice of making
what I call "socioeconomic superiority state
ments" is another lamentable impediment.
Pieces of clothing, like cars, constitute a very
popular medium for conveying the juvenile
message "I am more successful than you are"
(measured by material standards alone) and
hence better, more deserving of respect, more
desirable socially, etc. Most victims of this
mind set do not share the inane fervor of the
affluent 6th graders who taunt their
schoolmates with chants of "Your Mama
shops at K-Mart"; nevertheless, a distress
ingly large number of chronologically defined
adults evince attitudes about their clothing
(and other possessions) which seem to suggest
that their emotional development processes
were arrested somewhere in the vicinity of
early adolesence.
Finally, the would-be, non-conformist
reformer confronts the specter of punishment.
For many people, including me, the fear of
being penalized for clothing deviation is by far
the most important factor in the decision to
comply with the authorities. Some brave souls
may wish to test empirically the proposition
that defiant flouting of an employer's clothing
code will result in a quick dismissal. Those of
us who comprise the great cowardly majority,
however, are content to take it on faith. I
refuse to accept the notion that I should be
expected to choose between a good job and
comfortable clothing, but I cannot deny that
that choice is the current reality.
Military personnel and basketball
teammates may need dress codes, but will the
fabric of American office life really erode if
we fail to dress just like our colleagues? I

don't think so. And why should I be required
to wear a noose around my neck from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.? Is the successful performance of my
duties really contingent upon that allegedly
indispensable item? I don't think so; in fact, 1
believe that my productivity would soar if 1
could untie the damn thing and throw it away.
But, alas, I will not have the chance to liberate
my neck. At least not if I want another pay
check.
Someday, however, the currently ossified
dressing patterns will submit, as all things
must, to the forces of change. The questions
are how and when. We may not be the
masters of our fates, but as a non-determinist
1 believe that our actions (and inactions) can
significantly influence the course of destiny.
Thus, I urge the generally mute advocates of
my position tc do something to promote the
cause. Of course, the incentive may not be
present for those of you who are smart and/or
lucky enough to avoid vocational milieus that
place a premium on conformity. For others,
the disincentives may seem quite daunting.
Bear in mind, however, that the disincentives
did not stop our 1960s predecessors from
wreaking havoc on a system that proscribed
many of the things we now take for granted at
school — long hair, T-shirts, outrageous but
tons and tennis shoes. The campus revolution
can succeed in the conference rooms of the
"adult world'' if we come out of our cocoons
and start complaining.
As for my unsympathetic peers who are
satisified with the status quo, I hope y'all will
reconsider your position. I am appealing to
you as leaders of tomorrow rather than
today's peons; as women and men who will be
empowered to create new codes — or simply
jettison the old ones. If you want to wear ties
and expensive suits, fine; just don't make me
do it, OK?
