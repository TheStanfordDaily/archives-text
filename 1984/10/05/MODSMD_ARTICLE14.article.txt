' Having heard both the Univer
sity's and the union's management's
side regarding the dispute over whe
ther there should be a union at Stan
ford, I think it's time for
Commentary from an interested
bystander.
First and foremost, it is not man
agement's prerogative to decide for
its employees whether or not they
should have a union. The University
management (like all corporate
management) has the University's
interest at heart, and that may or
may not coincide with employee
interest. In this case, 1 think it does
not.
The administration has never been
overjoyed at the existence of a union
at Stanford because it forces man
agement to think twice about its
treatment of staff. Management
Actions vis-a-vis workers have to be
felatively in accord with the bargain
ing unit contract. Also, management
has to treat non-bargaining unit
members with a modicum of respect
lo keep them averted from the spec
ier of unionism. Were there no
union, then the management could
patronizingly determine for its
Workers what it thinks best without
$ny input or feedback from those
porkers. In essence, it would be a
it or leave it" situation.
; Union management doesn't ex-

actly have clean hands in this affair,
especially Local 715. Michael Baratz
and the higher-ups should have
followed procedure for disaffiliation,
then the University would have no
foothold for a challenge to the union.
Baratz' head should be served up on
a platter for his handling of the
original disaffiliation dispute. But we
should not allow the University to
alter the facts of the case in the
meanwhile. And those facts are that:
• A majority of the bargaining unit
employees voted to have Local 680
represent them;
• The University administration took
advantage of a weak moment in the
union's history to attack it;
• That attack may well backfire as
many previously uninterested
workers (like me) are seeing it as an
attack on their rights as workers.
If the University spent as much
time, energy and money on improv
ing the welfare of its staff as it is
spending in this effort to crush the
staff s union, we might all be less
skeptical of the administration's
intentions. As it is, the negotiation
"weather" bodes ill for next year's
contract negotiations.

More union facts
Undoubtedly one of the key attri
butes of the success of the Stanford

community is the liberal, open
minded approach Stanford takes in
regard to its policies, programs,
customs and codes. For this, I am
grateful to be here because I believe
that policy leads to the greatest good
to the greatest number.
Stanford's first-class style was
demonstrated throughout freshman
Orientation to my classmates and
me. I was proud to be associated
with this university from the moment
I stepped on campus, due in no small
part to the care, love and kindness
bestowed upon the Class of 1988 by
those who desire success for us.
Indicative of the Orientation
staff s attitude was the idea of the
Sunday Convocation, "a time of
coming together for reflection on our
personal and community goals . .
Unfortunately for those who took
part in the convocation, this ob
jective was not reached. Instead of
an expected refreshment and rekin
dling of the soul, I received an offen
sive speech dealing solely with
blatantly partisan political issues.
I was offended in two modes.
First, the impression and mood of
the convocation held no place for
controversial or political issues. I
would have thought that we could
leave the world outside for a few
moments of "personal reflection."
The Sunday Convocation was not an
appropriate setting to discuss

presidential campaigns.
Second, Stanford does have
Reagan supporters among its stu
dents, and discrimination occurs
when the University sponsors a
speech based on anti-Reagan
propaganda without presenting the
other side, such as was the case at
the convocation. For many of us who
believe in President Reagan's prin
ciples, it was appalling to listen to
the disparaging rhetoric of the
speech.
If Stanford's success is to continue,
then surely so will its open-minded
policies. Events such as last week's
Sunday Convocation reflect a regres
sion in the ideals of the Stanford
community.

I read with amusement David
Bratman's correction (The Daily,
Oct. 3) of Rodger Whitney's
malapropism in calling the peninsula
landlocked. He has compounded the
confusion by describing the San
Francisco Bay as landlocked instead.
People who live in glass houses. . .
It's been a while since I've gone to
sea [sic] for myself, but the last time
I was there the Golden Gate Bridge
spanned a mile or so of open, salty

and cold water between San Fran
cisco and Marin County. It is indeed
a bay, just like Monterey Bay, Hud
son Bay and the Bay of Naples. It
may be mostly surrounded by land,
but theoretically you could row from
the Palo Alto Harbor to Japan. If
Bratman's map tells him otherwise,

he needs a new map. Some
landlocked places are Lake Tahoe
the Great Salt Lake, Bolivia and
Chad, which means you can't row
there from here.

I read with amusement David
Bratman's correction (The Daily,
Oct. 3) of Rodger Whitney's
malapropism in calling the peninsula
landlocked. He has compounded the
confusion by describing the San
Francisco Bay as landlocked instead.
People who live in glass houses. . .
It's been a while since I've gone to
sea [sic] for myself, but the last time
I was there the Golden Gate Bridge
spanned a mile or so of open, salty

and cold water between San Fran
cisco and Marin County. It is indeed
a bay, just like Monterey Bay, Hud
son Bay and the Bay of Naples. It
may be mostly surrounded by land,
but theoretically you could row from
the Palo Alto Harbor to Japan. If
Bratman's map tells him otherwise,

he needs a new map. Some
landlocked places are Lake Tahoe
the Great Salt Lake, Bolivia and
Chad, which means you can't row
there from here.

' Having heard both the Univer
sity's and the union's management's
side regarding the dispute over whe
ther there should be a union at Stan
ford, I think it's time for
Commentary from an interested
bystander.
First and foremost, it is not man
agement's prerogative to decide for
its employees whether or not they
should have a union. The University
management (like all corporate
management) has the University's
interest at heart, and that may or
may not coincide with employee
interest. In this case, 1 think it does
not.
The administration has never been
overjoyed at the existence of a union
at Stanford because it forces man
agement to think twice about its
treatment of staff. Management
Actions vis-a-vis workers have to be
felatively in accord with the bargain
ing unit contract. Also, management
has to treat non-bargaining unit
members with a modicum of respect
lo keep them averted from the spec
ier of unionism. Were there no
union, then the management could
patronizingly determine for its
Workers what it thinks best without
$ny input or feedback from those
porkers. In essence, it would be a
it or leave it" situation.
; Union management doesn't ex-

actly have clean hands in this affair,
especially Local 715. Michael Baratz
and the higher-ups should have
followed procedure for disaffiliation,
then the University would have no
foothold for a challenge to the union.
Baratz' head should be served up on
a platter for his handling of the
original disaffiliation dispute. But we
should not allow the University to
alter the facts of the case in the
meanwhile. And those facts are that:
• A majority of the bargaining unit
employees voted to have Local 680
represent them;
• The University administration took
advantage of a weak moment in the
union's history to attack it;
• That attack may well backfire as
many previously uninterested
workers (like me) are seeing it as an
attack on their rights as workers.
If the University spent as much
time, energy and money on improv
ing the welfare of its staff as it is
spending in this effort to crush the
staff s union, we might all be less
skeptical of the administration's
intentions. As it is, the negotiation
"weather" bodes ill for next year's
contract negotiations.

More union facts
Undoubtedly one of the key attri
butes of the success of the Stanford

community is the liberal, open
minded approach Stanford takes in
regard to its policies, programs,
customs and codes. For this, I am
grateful to be here because I believe
that policy leads to the greatest good
to the greatest number.
Stanford's first-class style was
demonstrated throughout freshman
Orientation to my classmates and
me. I was proud to be associated
with this university from the moment
I stepped on campus, due in no small
part to the care, love and kindness
bestowed upon the Class of 1988 by
those who desire success for us.
Indicative of the Orientation
staff s attitude was the idea of the
Sunday Convocation, "a time of
coming together for reflection on our
personal and community goals . .
Unfortunately for those who took
part in the convocation, this ob
jective was not reached. Instead of
an expected refreshment and rekin
dling of the soul, I received an offen
sive speech dealing solely with
blatantly partisan political issues.
I was offended in two modes.
First, the impression and mood of
the convocation held no place for
controversial or political issues. I
would have thought that we could
leave the world outside for a few
moments of "personal reflection."
The Sunday Convocation was not an
appropriate setting to discuss

presidential campaigns.
Second, Stanford does have
Reagan supporters among its stu
dents, and discrimination occurs
when the University sponsors a
speech based on anti-Reagan
propaganda without presenting the
other side, such as was the case at
the convocation. For many of us who
believe in President Reagan's prin
ciples, it was appalling to listen to
the disparaging rhetoric of the
speech.
If Stanford's success is to continue,
then surely so will its open-minded
policies. Events such as last week's
Sunday Convocation reflect a regres
sion in the ideals of the Stanford
community.
