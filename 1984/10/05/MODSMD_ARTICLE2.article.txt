Stanford received a total of nearly $112 million in gift
funds from private sources last year, according to Henry
Riggs, vice president for development.
But Office of Development figures also revealed that
alumni contributions account for little more than one out
of every ten gift dollars received.
More than 60,000 donors contributed to the University
last year, according to David Fulton, deputy to the vice
president and the director of the department's communi
cations service. Of these donors, 70 percent were alumni,
but their total donations reflected only 11 percent of the
total funds received. "It's a lower participation rate than
you find at most of the Ivy League schools," said Riggs of
the alumni's share in giving. "We want to increase it."
One of every three Stanford alumni contributed funds
to the University. Many alumni who gave to Stanford did
so because the James Irvine Foundation matched their
donations with funds of its own, Riggs said.
The remainder of the gift funds are, for the most part,
donations from foundations, corporations and other
private sources,not directly connected with the University.
Fulton declined to divulge any information about specific
donors to Stanford's gift coffers. "We don't get into the
business of listing donors to the University," he said.
Fulton said the University is committed to allocating
the gift funds to specific areas, but did not indicate how
much those areas would receive this year.
Stanford uses some of the gift funds it receives annually
to pay for the expenses accrued by schools in specific
fields of study. The rest of the money goes to the Univer
sity's libraries, athletic budget and financial aid program.
Commenting on the sum Stanford received this year,
Fulton said, "We expected all along that last year would
be a pretty good year, and we weren't disappointed."
