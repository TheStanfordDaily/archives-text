## Big selection, superb service at Friday's 
### CATHY JANUS 
T.G.I. Friday's
10343 N. Wolfe Road

Thank God it is Friday, and what
better place to begin celebrating the
weekend than T.G.I. Friday's in Cuper
tino.
If there's a wait (or even if there
isn't), just sidle up to the bar and en
joy a drink. If you arrive between
4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., sample
some complimentary snacks.
You also might want to take some
time to peruse the massive directory

Friday's contin
uously adds new
and unusual items
to the menu.

listing the more than 300 hot and
cold, alcoholic and non-alcoholic
drinks served at Friday's.
Usually I dread going to a restau
rant where I'm given a menu so thick
it resembles a book. I end up com
pletely confused and indecisive, and
can only order after subjecting the
waitress to a number of questions.
But Friday's drink directory not
only lists the drinks served, but it also
includes brief descriptions. Many of
the drinks, such as the strawberry
shortcake and the velvet hammer, are
blended, low-alcohol drinks. Also
served are smoothies: health drinks
made with fruit juices, real fruit and
yogurt.
Sipping my drink, I turned to my
menu, which was of course a large,
bound volume with indices. I only
hoped the alcohol in my drink was
potent enough to relax me so I could
face the challenge of choosing what to
order from a menu with more than
160 items.
To make matters worse still, the
waitress asked if we would like to or
der an appetizer. Topping the ap
petizer list are egg rolls, followed by
nachos prepared in a variety of ways,
fried onion rings, clams, and
vegetables, baked brie with fresh
fruit, gourmet pizzas and potato
skins. Prices for appetizers range

from $1.85 to $5.95.
Though these items are listed un
der snacks and appetizers, most are
large enough to substitute for an
entree instead of supplementing it.
The waitress returned to ask if we
liked our drinks. I admitted my
friend's velvet hammer was better
than my mud slide (a concoction of
Kahlua, liquid mud pie and chocolate
which must have picked up too much
mint in the slide). To my surprise, she
suggested taking my drink back and
exchanging it for a velvet hammer.
The waitress said Friday's policy is
to encourage customers to try new
drinks and food items. Dissatisfied
customers may have their repugnant
drinks immediately replaced.
Now 1 understood why the party
seated next to us had driven all the
way from Salinas. The service is im
peccable; and little extras like free
refills on soft drinks don't hurt either.
I successfully waded through the
menu and decided to order one of the
specialties, Chinese Taco Salad
($6.25). A unique creation, it in
cludes stir-fried chicken, vegetables
and cashews on a bed of steamed
cabbage and spinach. My friend
decided to be his cautious self and or
dered a shredded beef chimichanga
($6.25).
The Chinese Taco Salad is so
named because it is served in a won
ton basket with a spicy sauce. It was
quite delicious and very filling. My
friend enjoyed every bite of his
chimichanga.
Feeling satisfied, we decided to
split a dessert. The dessert selection is
quite manageable and impressively
authentic. Friday's imports its
cheesecake all the way from New
York.
Our delightful concoction was
called Chocolate Almond Toffee
Macaroon Pie. Slices of Haagen-Dazs
Swiss-almond-vanilla and chocolate
ice cream are rolled in a nutty, chewy,
chocolate crumb shell and topped
with melted chocolate ($2.65). If you
are a dessert person, it is definitely
worth it to skip the appetizer or the
main meal and enjoy one of the
desserts.
Friday's is open daily from 11:30
a.m. until 1 a.m. On Sundays, brunch
is served from 11:00 a.m. until 2:30
p.m. Reservations are not accepted;
waits are usually not longer than 45
minutes.
