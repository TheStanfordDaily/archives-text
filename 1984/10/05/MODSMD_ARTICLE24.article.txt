# Get a taste of Latin America at Jose's

Jose's
2275 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6522
A night on the town for Stanford
students often means a predictable
evening of pizza and ice cream at one
of the few tried-and-true hangouts
around campus.
But if you're looking for something
a little more adventurous than the
Ramona's-to-Swensen's circuit, try
Jose's. Palo Alto's only Cuban res
taurant offers Stanford students a
taste of delicious and distinctive Latin
American dishes, all within biking
distance of campus.
Jose's specializes in empanadas, or
pastry crust shells filled with cheese,
olives, raisins, sauce and juicy hunks
of beef, chicken or prawns.
We tried a combination plate with
an empanada and spare ribs, offered
as a special that night for $8.75.
Jose's empanadas, oozing with thick,
mild sauce and bite-sized pieces of
white chicken, offer an unforgettable
introduction to Latin American
cuisine.
And Jose's thick, spicy barbecue
sauce simply has to be experienced; it
serves as a perfect complement to the
juicy, meaty ribs. Plates of chicken,
duck, beef and combination ribs are
available for prices ranging from
$7.95 to $8.25. The ribs are accom
panied by Spanish rice and black
beans.
The restaurant also offers a selec
tion of Argentine pizza, featuring
thick, white sourdough crusts topped
with Jose's delicious barbecue sauce
and generous toppings. We tried the
Italian sausage pizza ($6.65 for a
small), which was quite different than
the usual Americanized pizza fare,
but still quite tasty.
The menu lists several different
types of Cuban-style burritos and
enchiladas, ranging in price from
$4.75 to $5.75. Cuban burritos con
tain shredded spicy beef or chicken,
black beans, and various cheeses
wrapped in flour tortillas and topped
with sour cream and tomato sauce.
The restaurant sports a rudimen
tary salad bar which contains the
obligatory salad fixings. But the
sparse offerings seem overpriced at
$2.35 for a small salad ($1.75 with
pizza or entree).
Overall, however, the prices are
rather moderate considering the
quality of the food. You can expect to
spend about $8 to $12 a person for

entree, salad, wine, tax and tip.
The service at Jose's is fast, effi
cient and courteous, but the atmo
sphere isn't exactly exotic. Functional
vinyl chairs and square tables crowd
the small cafe.
But it's the food that Jose's empha
sizes, and it's the food that makes the
restaurant well worth a missed even
ing at Ramona's.
