## Card to face injured UCLA squad 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
When Sports Illustrated ranked
UCLA first in its preseason college
football poll, Bruin Coach Terry
Donahue quickly put things into per
spective. Thanks, he said, but we're
really not that good.
Donahue might be right.
Although defending Pacific 10
Conference champion UCLA takes a
3-1 record into its Pac-10 opener
against Stanford, 2-2, tomorrow in
Pasadena's Rose Bowl at 4:20 p.m., it
is a tainted 3-1.
UCLA's victories came against San
Diego State, Long Beach State and
the University of Colorado— not ex
actly top-20 teams — by scores of 18-
15, 23-17 and 33-16, respectively.
The Briuns' loss came to Nebraska —
not exactly a bottom-20 team — by
the score of 45-3.
"I never thought our football team
was a top-10 team at the beginning of
the season," said Donahue, who has
coached UCLA to a 36-12-3 record
and two straight Rose Bowl victories
in the 1980s. "But 1 did feel our team
could be a factor in the conference
race. We've obviously not played as
well as we'd like to."
One reason the Bruins haven't is
injuries. Donahue said at least six and
as many as nine Bruin ■starters could

miss tomorrow's game with an assort
ment of ailments.
A quarterback (Scott Bono), a tail
back (Danny Andrews), two wide
receivers (Mike Young and Karl Dor
rell), two defensive linemen (Jeff
Glasser and Mark Walen), a
linebacker (Tony Phillips) and a
safety (Dennis Price) missed last
week's game against Colorado and
rate from doubtful to questionable
for tomorrow.
The biggest loss, however, is at
quarterback. Bono, a senior who had
his shoulder separated by Stanford's
John Bergren last season, has com
pleted 48.1 percent (26 of 54) of his
passes for no touchdowns and he's
missed the past two games with a
badly sprained ankle. He's also not
starting tomorrow. Freshman Matt
Stevens, whose statistics (26 of 51
and one touchdown) aren't much bet
ter, will start.
Stevens won't be alone when it
comes to inexperience at quarter
back. Stanford senior Fred Buckley
will be taking the sixth snap of his
illness-plagued Cardinal career when
he steps behind center Brent Martin
on Stanford's first play. Buckley is
replacing injured John Paye, the only
Cardinal not expected to play tomor
row.
But Donahue, who recruited Buck

ley out of high school, doesn't think
the loss of Paye will be the nightmare
some think it will be. "My initial reac
tion — not to slight John Paye — is
that football is a team game,"
Donahue said. "And I always think
that teams rally when a starting
player is out. ,
"I know John is a very fine athlete
and a very fine quarterback,"
Donahue continued. "But Stanford
University has never been without a
great backup quarterback. So I don't
think we will prepare any differently
for Fred. We know we're going to
play against a good quarterback."
Donahue and UCLA lost Bono in
the fourth game last season and went
on to win seven of their final eight
games, including a 45-9 Rose Bowl
win over Illinois, with backup Rick
Neuheisel at quarterback.
UCLA, which is weak in its sec
ondary, will try to shut down Stan
ford's passing attack, but that will not
be its biggest concern. Putting points
on the board will. UCLA scored only
two touchdowns — and placekicker
John Lee kicked 10 field goals — in
the Bruins' first three games before
scoring 33 points last week against
Colorado.
"I think when you look at Stanford
University, I think the difference in
their football team (from last year) is

their defense," Donahue said. "I
think they play really hard and have a
number of really good linebackers."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway might
not disagree with the part of that
statement about the linebackers, but
as for playing hard, he has his
reservations.
"For one reason or another," El
way said Monday at his weekly press
conference, "I don't think we've
played with the emotion that we
played against Oklahoma, that we
played with against Illinois. We've
got to rekindle that emotion."
Card notes
Tomorrow's game will be telecast

live on KICU-TV (Channel 36).
KSFO (560 AM) and KZSU (90.1
FM) will broadcast the game.
A crowd of 46,000 is expected for
the game in the Rose Bowl, UCLA's
home field. Stanford, which has
played one other regular-season
game there (a 38-35 loss to UCLA in
1982), has a 6-4-1 overall record in
the Rose Bowl.
Fullback Kaulana Park, who was
listed at the beginning of the week as
doubtful for the UCLA game, has
practiced this week and might play
tomorrow. The starter at fullback is a
different question. It could be Park,
Brian Morris, who has recovered
from an ankle injury, or Brad Muster.

Thomas Henley, whose brother Daf
fy' is a freshman defensive back for
UCLA, will probably start at tail
back.
The kickoff time for next week's
home game against Washington is
12:40 p.m. It was listed as TBA (to
be announced) on most schedules.

Earle Bruce of Ohio State Univer
sity and Don James of the University
of Washington have been named
head coaches for the 60th Shrine
East-West football game, it was an
nounced yesterday.
The game is scheduled for Jan. 5-at
Stanford Stadium.

Senior Mark Harmon's extra point last Saturday against Arizona State was his 29th consecutive conversion
dating back to Oct. 30, 1982. Harmon, who has kicked 82 extra points for Stanford, also has kicked 39 field
goals and is tied with Ken Naber for second on the Cardinal career list.

Adam Grossman/Daily
Tailback Thomas Henley leads the Cardinal in rushing with 152 yards and in receiving with 18 catches. Hen
ley, a sophomore, is 23rd in the nation in receiving and leads Stanford in total yards with 429. Last season,
he had 563 yards.

Senior Mark Harmon's extra point last Saturday against Arizona State was his 29th consecutive conversion
dating back to Oct. 30, 1982. Harmon, who has kicked 82 extra points for Stanford, also has kicked 39 field
goals and is tied with Ken Naber for second on the Cardinal career list.

Adam Grossman/Daily
Tailback Thomas Henley leads the Cardinal in rushing with 152 yards and in receiving with 18 catches. Hen
ley, a sophomore, is 23rd in the nation in receiving and leads Stanford in total yards with 429. Last season,
he had 563 yards.

When Sports Illustrated ranked
UCLA first in its preseason college
football poll, Bruin Coach Terry
Donahue quickly put things into per
spective. Thanks, he said, but we're
really not that good.
Donahue might be right.
Although defending Pacific 10
Conference champion UCLA takes a
3-1 record into its Pac-10 opener
against Stanford, 2-2, tomorrow in
Pasadena's Rose Bowl at 4:20 p.m., it
is a tainted 3-1.
UCLA's victories came against San
Diego State, Long Beach State and
the University of Colorado— not ex
actly top-20 teams — by scores of 18-
15, 23-17 and 33-16, respectively.
The Briuns' loss came to Nebraska —
not exactly a bottom-20 team — by
the score of 45-3.
"I never thought our football team
was a top-10 team at the beginning of
the season," said Donahue, who has
coached UCLA to a 36-12-3 record
and two straight Rose Bowl victories
in the 1980s. "But 1 did feel our team
could be a factor in the conference
race. We've obviously not played as
well as we'd like to."
One reason the Bruins haven't is
injuries. Donahue said at least six and
as many as nine Bruin ■starters could

miss tomorrow's game with an assort
ment of ailments.
A quarterback (Scott Bono), a tail
back (Danny Andrews), two wide
receivers (Mike Young and Karl Dor
rell), two defensive linemen (Jeff
Glasser and Mark Walen), a
linebacker (Tony Phillips) and a
safety (Dennis Price) missed last
week's game against Colorado and
rate from doubtful to questionable
for tomorrow.
The biggest loss, however, is at
quarterback. Bono, a senior who had
his shoulder separated by Stanford's
John Bergren last season, has com
pleted 48.1 percent (26 of 54) of his
passes for no touchdowns and he's
missed the past two games with a
badly sprained ankle. He's also not
starting tomorrow. Freshman Matt
Stevens, whose statistics (26 of 51
and one touchdown) aren't much bet
ter, will start.
Stevens won't be alone when it
comes to inexperience at quarter
back. Stanford senior Fred Buckley
will be taking the sixth snap of his
illness-plagued Cardinal career when
he steps behind center Brent Martin
on Stanford's first play. Buckley is
replacing injured John Paye, the only
Cardinal not expected to play tomor
row.
But Donahue, who recruited Buck

ley out of high school, doesn't think
the loss of Paye will be the nightmare
some think it will be. "My initial reac
tion — not to slight John Paye — is
that football is a team game,"
Donahue said. "And I always think
that teams rally when a starting
player is out. ,
"I know John is a very fine athlete
and a very fine quarterback,"
Donahue continued. "But Stanford
University has never been without a
great backup quarterback. So I don't
think we will prepare any differently
for Fred. We know we're going to
play against a good quarterback."
Donahue and UCLA lost Bono in
the fourth game last season and went
on to win seven of their final eight
games, including a 45-9 Rose Bowl
win over Illinois, with backup Rick
Neuheisel at quarterback.
UCLA, which is weak in its sec
ondary, will try to shut down Stan
ford's passing attack, but that will not
be its biggest concern. Putting points
on the board will. UCLA scored only
two touchdowns — and placekicker
John Lee kicked 10 field goals — in
the Bruins' first three games before
scoring 33 points last week against
Colorado.
"I think when you look at Stanford
University, I think the difference in
their football team (from last year) is

their defense," Donahue said. "I
think they play really hard and have a
number of really good linebackers."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway might
not disagree with the part of that
statement about the linebackers, but
as for playing hard, he has his
reservations.
"For one reason or another," El
way said Monday at his weekly press
conference, "I don't think we've
played with the emotion that we
played against Oklahoma, that we
played with against Illinois. We've
got to rekindle that emotion."
Card notes
Tomorrow's game will be telecast

live on KICU-TV (Channel 36).
KSFO (560 AM) and KZSU (90.1
FM) will broadcast the game.
A crowd of 46,000 is expected for
the game in the Rose Bowl, UCLA's
home field. Stanford, which has
played one other regular-season
game there (a 38-35 loss to UCLA in
1982), has a 6-4-1 overall record in
the Rose Bowl.
Fullback Kaulana Park, who was
listed at the beginning of the week as
doubtful for the UCLA game, has
practiced this week and might play
tomorrow. The starter at fullback is a
different question. It could be Park,
Brian Morris, who has recovered
from an ankle injury, or Brad Muster.

Thomas Henley, whose brother Daf
fy' is a freshman defensive back for
UCLA, will probably start at tail
back.
