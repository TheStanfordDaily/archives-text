# Res Ed maintains strict alcohol rules
## 
### JACK ALDEN 
When a dorm or fraternity throws a
party at Stanford, it has more to plan
for than just what antl How much food
and drink to serve or what music to
play. It also needs to make sure it fol
lows the Residential Education alco
hol policy. Many students, however,
are not sure what this policy is, if it is
different from past years', how it is en-

forced or implemented and if it is
working.
The purpose of the alcohol policy,
according to Alice Supton, assistant
dean of student affairs for Residential
Education, is to create a healthy and
safe environment for students and to
enable students to decide whether or
not to drink.
The policy specifies that alcohol
should not be the focus of an event,
that equally attractive non-alcoholic
beverages, which do not include
water, must be available in equal
quantities whenever alcohol is served,
and that California law makes it ille
gal for people under 21 to drink, buy
or be served alcohol.
Furthermore, Supton stressed that
drinking games such as quarters or
thumper are contrary to Res Ed
policy because of the dangers in
herent in these games: A large quan
tity of alcohol can be consumed in a
short period of time which the body
may not be able to handle or process.
Many students think that the alco
hol policy is a new development, or
that new rules were instituted last
year. But Supton said Res Ed now
follows the same policy as it did in
previous years.
Supton said Res Ed decided to
become more vocal — explaining its
policy and rationale behind it — after

seeing results of a study on student
knowledge of Res Ed's alcohol
policy.
Although resident assistants had
been given copies of the alcohol
policy in handbooks, many were still
not clear on the policy, the study
revealed.
In order for students to learn the
alcohol policy, RAs needed to know
it better. So Res Ed worked with the
RAs, issued alcohol policy cards to
freshmen, revised the "Nine Facts for
Frosh" poster to include the alcohol
policy, and had discussions of alcohol
use and policy. Another impetus to
publicizing the policy was a series of
reports from RFs that students were
coming to Stanford with their drink
ing behavior and patterns established.
But many students feel Res Ed has
become more conservative about stu
dent alcohol use over the past few
years.
"It seems like they became a little
stricter, or at least more vocal about it
.... Maybe they noticed it was a
problem," said senior Ted Calvert, an
RA at Roble.
Students also said the campus car
crash that killed two students three
years ago may have spurred Res Ed's
increased publicity.
But Supton said the incidents that
make Res Ed aware of the need to
publicize the policy are recurring inci
dents such as students passing out or
vomiting in their rooms, problems
that occur throughout the residence
system.
Supton expressed strong feeling
that Res Ed must take every measure
to prevent accidents like the 1981 car
crash.
"It makes you say, 'What can we do
so this doesn't happen again?' It's so
devastating," she said.
One area in which Res Ed feels
there are problems is in the hosting,
or lack of hosting, of parties.
"People think it is enough to put
out punch, food and a stereo and
that's the party," Supton said.
Supton said parties need hosts to
refill the punch and food, make sure
there are cups, and most of all. get
people acquainted and make sure no
one is left out. "It's like hosting a
party in your own home, because it is
the students' home," she said.
The implementation of the alcohol
policy is left to residence staffs and
house governments and, where appli


Alice Supton
cable, to the intrafraternity council
and fraternity members. Last year Res
Ed had meetings with house govern
ments to stress the role of non
alcoholic beverages, food and the
amount of money spent on alcohol.
These meeting will be held again this
year.
Residence staffs have discussed the
place of alcohol at Stanford, espe
cially at the first freshman parties.
"You just don't need it," Supton
said. "People will have a chance to
have a beer later.
"Look at the Talent Show, there
were [more than] 400 people there
with no alcohol," Supton said. But
one RA related that though the
dorm's alcohol-free party lasted for a
while, it slowly lost freshmen to a fra
ternity party.
Resident assistants say that Res Ed
does not place limits on the amount

of alcohol to be served, nor does it
send people to check out parties.
"They don't set limits so much,"
said David Ehrlich, RA at Alpha
Delta Phi and former Alpha Delt
president. "The only pressure is to
eliminate the pressure to drink. There
is not a pressure not to drink."
Supton did not know of any up
coming changes, such as prohibiting
alcohol at fraternity rush or on
campus.
"To prohibit the use of alcohol
would be to remove the choice for
people," Supton said. "We don't for
bid alcohol use, but people should
make their own choices, with the
knowledge of California law.
"We don't feel it's our job or prov
ince to dictate to people. But relief is
needed from the group pressure to
drink," she said.
Reaction to the possibility of a dry
rush was mixed. "I'd be opposed to
it," said Delta Upsilon RA Chris
Cramer, a former member of Kappa
Sigma. "You'd be limiting one part of
the University as opposed to the rest.

It wouldn't be fair."
Cramer said that there is a place for
alcohol in rush — a social beer helps«
when a person goes into a place .
where he does not know all the.
people but is intent on meeting!
them. But people should always have |
the option not to drink or not to be J
pressured to drink, Cramer added. ;
Ehrlich did not like the idea of a •
dry campus. "At some level people .
have to make decisions — you can't
tell someone not to drink or not to !
give a beer to a friend. I don't see |
them (Res Ed) trying to limit people's J
choices."
Supton said she does not see Resj
Ed as the enemy of an alcohol-loving «
student body.
"Everyone is working together to J
protect the students' choice to drink «
moderately or not at all, and to try to •
help people with [an alcohol prob-1
lem] to face up to the problem and \
help them get rid of it."
