# Water polo team to face USC, UCLA
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford water polo team will
play its first two Pacific 10 games of
the season at the University of South
ern California today and the Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles to
morrow.
Although the Cardinal is ranked
second in the nation, Coach Dante
Dettamanti said he feels his team will
be the underdog in both games.
"We have to travel to both games
and play them back-to-back with very
little time between matches," Detta
manti said. "USC and UCLA are
only playing one game apiece this
weekend in their home pools, so they
will have more time to rest and
prepare than we will. If we were
playing only one match this weekend,
at home, then I would feel we had the
advantage."
Stanford will play USC at 4 this af
ternoon. The Cardinal defeated the
Trojans, 9-6, earlier this season in the
Irvine Tournament.
Stanford will play UCLA tomor
row at 10 a.m. The Bruins

defeated the Cardinal, 7-5, in the
Irvine Tournament.
According to Dettamanti, USC and
UCLA follow very similar game
plans and play with a lot of offensive
intensity.
"We have analyzed both teams on
film and have been working all week
on how to counteract some of their
special defenses and their talented
goalies," Dettamanti said.
Pac-10 games are important be
cause only six league games are
played during the season, and the
winner of each league automatically
advances to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association championships.
Because of the importance of these
two games, Dettamanti said he and
his team are taking this weekend's
competition very seriously.
"If we can come out of this
weekend with two victories, we will
have won one-third of our league
games and will be in great shape,"
Dettamanti said. " If we play like I
know we can, we will have those two
victories by Saturday afternoon."
