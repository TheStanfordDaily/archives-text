# Stanford to play UA, ASU after confidence builder
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON 
After a "confidence-building" victory over the Univer
sity of Santa Clara, the Stanford women's volleyball team
will play the University of Arizona and Arizona State
University tonight and tomorrow night, respectively.
The Cardinal's victory over Santa Clara Sept. 25 came
after Stanford's first loss of the season, to USC, 15-11,
J 5-8, 15-10 on Sept. 22.
The Cardinal rebounded from the loss, winning the first
two games of the three-out-of-five match against Santa
Clara.
The early lead gave Stanford Head Coach Fred Sturm a
chance to experiment with new plays and mix lineups.
Stanford lost some momentum with the changes,
however, and lost the next two games before winning the
fifth with its starting rotation playing.
Asst. Coach Don Shaw said the match against Santa
Clara was important because it was a chance to see some
of Stanford's new players. The starters also learned much
from the match.
"It was tough for the starters to come in relatively cold
in the fifth game," Shaw said. "But they played well and
won the match easily â€” a real confidence builder."
Although the starters have played well thus far, ap
parently neither Sturm nor Shaw feel there is a need to
find the six players who play together best.
"We still have a long way to go," Shaw said. "There are
two long months left in the season, and we won't expect to
lie truly settled until sometime in late November."
One postition that already appears to be settled is

middle blocker. Filling that postition is Kim Oden, who
has led Stanford in kills, hitting percentages and blocking
the past two seasons. Last year, she was named the West
ern Collegiate Athletic Association's Most Valuable
Player as well as an Ail-American.
According to Shaw, the Cardinal is working to solidify
the rest of the squad around Oden. Much of it will come
from the setters, Diedra Dvorak and Wendi Rush, as they
become accustomed to the hitters.
Tonight and tomorrow's matches set the Cardinal (4-1
overall, 1-1 in the WCAA) against two teams ranked in
the top 20. Arizona, ranked ninth in a Collegiate Volley
ball Coaches Association poll, has three potential All-
America players, including all-conference middle blocker
Melissa McLinden.
Last season, Arizona placed fifth in the WCAA behind
Stanford, UCLA, USC, and San Diego State University.
According to Shaw, Arizona is sound defensively and of
fensively and will challenge Stanford at the net with its
abundance of "big and physically strong" players.
Arizona State, 6-4 overall and 1-3 in the WCAA, is
ranked 19th in the nation. The loss of a top outside hitter
and a small number of returning players account for the
Sun Devils' lower standing.
Shaw does not forsee changes in game strategies against
Arizona or ASU.
"We tend to take care of ourselves, taking each match a
game at a time, and reacting only if we need to as the
match goes on," Shaw said. "We try to be as flexible as
possible within a match."

Senior hitter Lisa Murphy has a hitting percentage of .400, the Cardinal's third best in that category. Ac
cording to Stanford Head Coach Fred Sturm, Murphy "is a fierce competitor, a fighter and a gifted athlete.
She uses her head well on the court."
