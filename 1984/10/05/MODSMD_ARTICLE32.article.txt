## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's soccer team will face two unde
feated opponents this weekend when it plays the Univer
sity of Washington tomorrow and UCLA Sunday in the
Pacific 10 tourney at Livermore.
The Bruins are ranked second in the country with an 8-
0-1 record. Their tie came against Fresno State, which
defeated the Cardinal, 3-0, at Fresno Wednesday night.
Senior goalkeeper Willie Burkhardt said Stanford's
next two games will be tough. "University of Washington
has an excellent, skilled midfield and two great forwards,"
Burkhardt said. "UCLA is good everywhere except in
goal. Their goalkeeper is inexperienced."
There are a number of outstanding players on the

UCLA team. Junior midfielder Dale Ervine is a candidate
for All-America honors this year, and midfielders Doug
Swanson and Mike Getchell provide him with experi
enced support. Fullback Paul Caliguiri was a member of
the United States Olympic team until he was cut when it
was decided to use professional players.
The University of Washington defeated the perennially
strong University of San Francisco Dons in San Francisco,
4-0, Wednesday night. Washington has beaten Simon
Fraser, 1-0, and the University of Portland, 2-0.
The Cardinal defeated the Huskies last year, 2-0, but a
repeat performance will be difficult this year.
Stanford is 5-3-2 overall and 1-1 in the Pacific Soccer
Conference. After the Pac-10 tourney, the Cardinal's
next game is Wednesday at home against St. Mary's
