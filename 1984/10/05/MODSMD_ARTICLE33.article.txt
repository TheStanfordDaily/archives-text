# SU Invitational tomorrow
## 
### DARREN WOODRUFF 
The Stanford University Golf
Course tomorrow will be the site of
the Stanford Invitational, the second
meet in a year of high expectations
for the women's cross-country team
and improvement for the men.
With a team that Coach Brooks
Johnson says "has more experience
and more talent than last year," the

Cardinal women are expected to face
the biggest challenges from Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, the University of
California at Irvine, and the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley. Of the
women who won last year's Stanford
Invitational by 29 points over second
place Cal Poly-SLO, all but one are
competing.
After finishing second in the Na

tional Collegiate Athletic Association
championships the past two years, the
Cardinal is motivated to finish one
notch higher.
The men's team, described as
"developing" by Johnson, will need
improvement to achieving its goal
of qualifying for the NCAAs.
The women race at 10 a.m., fol
lowed by the men at 10:45.
