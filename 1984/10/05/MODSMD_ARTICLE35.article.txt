# Padres defeat Cubs, 7-1

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Kevin Mcßeynolds hit a
three-run homer and Garry Templeton had a two
run double as the San Diego Padres scored a 7-1
victory over the Chicago Cubs last night and stayed
alive in the National League Championship Series.
The Cubs, who now have a two-games-to-one
lead in the best-of-five series, still need one victory
to advance to their first World Series since 1945.
No team has fever won a National League Cham
pionshp Series after losing the first two games.
Trailing 1-0, Templeton's double came in a
three-run fifth inning against Cubs righthander
Dennis Eckersley. The Padres started a rally
against Cubs pitching, which had held San Diego to
11 hits and two runs in the two previous playoff
games. Chicago won those games at home, 13-0
and 4-2.
Mcßeynold's homer, his first since Sept. 3,
capped a four-run sixth inning.

In last night's game, it was San Diego's turn to
get good pitching. Veteran righthander Ed Whitson
gave up five hits to the Cubs, including a leadoff
double to Keith Moreland that led to a Chicago run
in the second inning. Whitson, 14-8 in his best
major-league season, struck out six and walked two
before being replaced by Rich Gossage, who
pitched the ninth.
Game Four of the Cubs-Padres series will be
played in San Diego tomorrow night, with Game
Five scheduled for Sunday. The Padres are ex
pected to start Tim Lollar, and Scott Sanderson
probably will start for the Cubs.
Eckersley, 10-8 during this season, lasted five
and one-third innings for the Cubs and gave up
nine hits, two more than Cubs starting pitchers
combined to allow in Games One and Two.
Perhaps it was the change in venue, as much as
Templeton's spark, that enlivened the Padres, win

ners of the National League West division this
season. Returning home after losing two games at
Chicago's Wrigley Field, the Padres played before
58,346, the largest crowd ever at Jack Murphy
Stadium.
As the starting lineups were announced,
Templeton led the crowd in cheers, waving his hat
and seeming to express the Padres' frustration as he
called for fan support for the first Padre team to
win its division.
Terry Kennedy, previously hitless in the playoffs,
started the winning fifth-inning rally with a single.
Mcßeynolds, also hitless, singled, and Kennedy
went to second. One out later, Templeton doubled
to the wall in left-center, and both runners scored.
Whitson then blooped out to second, and Alan
Wiggins singled up the middle. Wiggins was thrown
out trying to stretch the single, but Templeton
scored, and San Diego led, 3-1.
