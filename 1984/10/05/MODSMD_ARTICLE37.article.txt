East of Kden (1955)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
Paul Osborn's screenplay of John
Steinbeck's biblical allegory (Genesis set
in Northern California in the late 19th
and early 2()th centuries) utilizes only
the Cain and Abel section, with
Raymond Massey as Adam Trask, James
Dean and Dick Davalos as his sons Cal
and Aaron, and Jo Van Fleet as his
estranged wife, the madam in a neigh
boring town. When Cal learns who his
mother is - , he uses the knowledge to
destroy his brother. One recognizes the
Steinbeck heavy touch — ironies are
stated and restated and overstated — but
the director, Elia Kazan, emphases the
Freudian subtext of the story, so the per
iod detail notwithstanding, this becomes
a prime example of 1950s American
Freudianizing. Kazan botches the nar
rative and the film lopes and bounds
rather than building and moving for
ward, but it has tremendously intense
scenes and amazing vitality — particu
larly in the scenes between Dean and
Julie Harris, which have the feeling of
improvisation. The excitement in the
performances of these two remarkable
young stars hasn't dimmed; you still get
the sense of actors inventing a whole new
set of rules. With Burl Ives, Albert Dek
ker, Lois Smith arid Barbara Baxley;
shot by Ted McCord; and with an unfor
tunate score by Leonard Rosenman.
Plays Tuesday with "Rebel Without a
Cause."
Rebel Without a Cause (1955)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A bad movie of uncommon resonance.
James Dean was already a star of conse
quence in his feverous performance as
Cal in Elia Kazan's "East of Eden";
"Rebel" made him a 1950s cult hero,
like the young Brando, and when he died
in a car crash the next year, millions of
teenagers were shattered. Nearly 30
years later, many movie lovers feel very
close to this movie, in which Dean gives
the quintessential misunderstood-youth
performance. He and the movie override
Stewart Stern's obvious screenplay and
are unreasonably moving. Nichola Ray
did the heavy, effective direction. Jim

Backus and Ann Doran play Dean's par
ents, Natalie Wood is the girl who loves
him, Sal Mineo (at his most histrionic) is
his faithful spaniel. With Dennis Hopper
in a small part.
Plays Tuesday with "East of Eden."
The Natural (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Not a fiasco — the director, Barry
Levinson, gives Roger Towne's adapta
tion of the Bernard Malamud novel,
which scouted the mythic terrain of
baseball, a lightly ironic tone in the first
45 minutes — but it runs into real trou
ble as soon as the intrigue begins and it
never gets back on track. Without a
cinematic equivalent for the wildest
details of Malamud's comic fantasy, most
of which the filmmakers have cut or al
tered, the movie waxes sentimental, and
sometimes Levinson's and photographer
Caleb Deschanel's artistry freezes the
action. The cast features Robert Red
ford, Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Wil
ford Brimley, Richard Farnsworth,
Robert Prosky and others, but the movie
reins in even the most talented of them,
and no one breaks through except Joe
Don Baker at the very beginning. As a
Babe Ruthian figure who milks the
crowd with rapscallion assurance — a
scoundrel charmer — Baker clowns ex
quisitely.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
The Atomic Cafe (1982)
Cubberley Auditorium
A true curio — a montage of newsreel,
army training and popular propaganda
footage tracing the development of
atomic weapons from the flight of the
Enola Gay over Hiroshima to the chil
liest days of the Cold War. Some of it is
horrifying, but most is foolish and risible.
Kevin Rafferty, Jayne Loader and Pierce
Rafferty assembled the film as a contri
bution to the anti-nuke movement, but
most of it seems too remote and naive to
have any real political potency. Besides,
the tone of the movie, snide and super
cilious, becomes uncomfortable even if
you share the filmmakers' point of view,
and the film is maddeningly deficient in
identifying data throughout. The cross
cutting between propaganda and scenes
of crew-cutted Americans in indistin

guishable parlors under the spell of TV
hypnosis seems to be saying that the path
to nuclear holocaust is being paved by
blank-faced, ignorant middle-class
Americans with no taste — that the ugli
ness of the suburban landscape goes
hand in hand with the moral ugliness of
its crass inhabitants. Is there still an audi
ence for this kind of smug, wholesale
put-down of America?
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
Z(1969)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Costa-Gavras' political melodrama, a
thinly disguised dramatization of the
Lambrakis scandal in Greece four years
earlier (a political murder that led to the
exposure of layers of government cor
ruption), is so brilliantly calibrated and
so tense that it gets the viewer in a vise
grip; it exists right at the point where art
and emotional manipulation intersect.
Jorge Semprun adapted the novel by
Vassili Vassilikos, Mikis Theodorakis
wrote the stirring score, Raoul Coutard
photographed, and there's an unusually
distinctive cast (Yves Montand, Jean-
Louis Trintignant, Irene Papas, Renato
Salvatori, Marcel Bozzufi, Francois
Perier and Charles Denner).
Plays Wednesday with "Missing."
The Fourth Man (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Paul Verhoeven, the Dutch director,
made this masterful little movie with no
ideas but an exciting, sexy, ostentatious
surface. Jeroen Krabbe does first-rate
work in the role of a homosexual, al
coholic author with a gift for manipulat
ing circumstances to his own advantage.
About to board a train to Flushing,
where he has been hired to address a
literary club, he tries without success to
pick up a muscular young man (Thom
Hoffman). In Flushing, he allows himself
to be seduced by a wealthy widow
(Renee Soutendijk) and begins to enter
tain the prospect of living off her
generosity for a while, especially when
he learns that the Adonis from the train
station is her lover. What makes the film
nonsensical is the supernatural conflict
underpinning the sex story, but the Cath
olic imagery has astonishing clarity. The
best of it practically lifts Verhoeven into

the Bertolucci ranks, though unlike Ber
tolucci, Verhoeven's images operate
purely on the visceral level.
Plays tomorrow with "L'Argent."
Macbeth (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Roman Polanski's realistic setting of
the great tragedy is for 20th-century
audiences; bloody and seething with po
litical intrigue, it is the play Jan Kott
wrote about in his essay " 'Macbeth,' or
Death-Infected" in "Shakespeare Our
Contemporary." But it lacks mystery
and it is not gripping. Jon Finch and
Francesca Annis are a glamorous young
Macbeth and lady.
Plays Monday with "Romeo and
Juliet."
Follow the Fleet (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
By consensus, the three greatest Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals are
"Swing Time," "Top Hat" and"The
Gay Divorcee"; "Follow the Fleet" must
surely own fourth place. Astaire, in a
rare working-class role, plays a gum
chewing sailor who, on shore leave,
teams up with his old vaudeville partner,
Rogers, now a dance hall hostess, to win
a dance contest. The Dwight Taylor and
Allan Scott script (based on a play by
Hubert Osborne called "Shore Leave")
has its dead spots: There's a romance be
tween Rogers' sister and Astaire's buddy
that kills a good half hour of the continu
ity — not least because the second
bananas, Harriet Milliard and Randolph
Scott, to quote Arlene Croce, "go to
gether like red whiskey and Seconal."
But Mark Sandrich, the director, keeps
things light, and the glorious Irving Ber
lin score ("We Saw the Sea," "Let Your
self Go," "I'd Rather Lead a Band,"
"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Bas
ket," "Let's Face the Music and Dance")
provides the stars with some wonderful
opportunities. This was Rogers'
breakthrough film: Her dancing is ter
rific and her clowning ebullient. With
Lucille Ball and Betty Grable in bits.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Flying Down to Rio."

Follow the Fleet (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
By consensus, the three greatest Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals are
"Swing Time," "Top Hat" and"The

surely own fourth place. Astaire, in a
rare working-class role, plays a gum

East of Kden (1955)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
Paul Osborn's screenplay of John
Steinbeck's biblical allegory (Genesis set
in Northern California in the late 19th
and early 2()th centuries) utilizes only
the Cain and Abel section, with
Raymond Massey as Adam Trask, James
Dean and Dick Davalos as his sons Cal
and Aaron, and Jo Van Fleet as his
estranged wife, the madam in a neigh
boring town. When Cal learns who his
mother is - , he uses the knowledge to
destroy his brother. One recognizes the
Steinbeck heavy touch — ironies are
stated and restated and overstated — but
the director, Elia Kazan, emphases the
Freudian subtext of the story, so the per
iod detail notwithstanding, this becomes
a prime example of 1950s American
Freudianizing. Kazan botches the nar
rative and the film lopes and bounds
rather than building and moving for
ward, but it has tremendously intense
scenes and amazing vitality — particu

Julie Harris, which have the feeling of
improvisation. The excitement in the
performances of these two remarkable
young stars hasn't dimmed; you still get

Rebel Without a Cause (1955)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A bad movie of uncommon resonance.
James Dean was already a star of conse
quence in his feverous performance as
Cal in Elia Kazan's "East of Eden";
"Rebel" made him a 1950s cult hero,
like the young Brando, and when he died
in a car crash the next year, millions of
teenagers were shattered. Nearly 30
years later, many movie lovers feel very
close to this movie, in which Dean gives
the quintessential misunderstood-youth
performance. He and the movie override
Stewart Stern's obvious screenplay and
are unreasonably moving. Nichola Ray
did the heavy, effective direction. Jim

Backus and Ann Doran play Dean's par

him, Sal Mineo (at his most histrionic) is
his faithful spaniel. With Dennis Hopper
in a small part.

The Natural (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Not a fiasco — the director, Barry
Levinson, gives Roger Towne's adapta

which scouted the mythic terrain of
baseball, a lightly ironic tone in the first
45 minutes — but it runs into real trou
ble as soon as the intrigue begins and it
never gets back on track. Without a
cinematic equivalent for the wildest
details of Malamud's comic fantasy, most
of which the filmmakers have cut or al
tered, the movie waxes sentimental, and
sometimes Levinson's and photographer
Caleb Deschanel's artistry freezes the
action. The cast features Robert Red
ford, Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Wil
ford Brimley, Richard Farnsworth,
Robert Prosky and others, but the movie
reins in even the most talented of them,
and no one breaks through except Joe
Don Baker at the very beginning. As a

A true curio — a montage of newsreel,
army training and popular propaganda
footage tracing the development of
atomic weapons from the flight of the
Enola Gay over Hiroshima to the chil

horrifying, but most is foolish and risible.
Kevin Rafferty, Jayne Loader and Pierce
Rafferty assembled the film as a contri
bution to the anti-nuke movement, but
most of it seems too remote and naive to
have any real political potency. Besides,
the tone of the movie, snide and super
cilious, becomes uncomfortable even if
you share the filmmakers' point of view,
and the film is maddeningly deficient in
identifying data throughout. The cross
cutting between propaganda and scenes
of crew-cutted Americans in indistin

guishable parlors under the spell of TV
hypnosis seems to be saying that the path
to nuclear holocaust is being paved by
blank-faced, ignorant middle-class
Americans with no taste — that the ugli
ness of the suburban landscape goes

Costa-Gavras' political melodrama, a
thinly disguised dramatization of the

ford Brimley, Richard Farnsworth,
Robert Prosky and others, but the movie
reins in even the most talented of them,
and no one breaks through except Joe
Don Baker at the very beginning. As a
Babe Ruthian figure who milks the
crowd with rapscallion assurance — a
scoundrel charmer — Baker clowns ex
quisitely.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
The Atomic Cafe (1982)
Cubberley Auditorium
A true curio — a montage of newsreel,
army training and popular propaganda
footage tracing the development of
atomic weapons from the flight of the
Enola Gay over Hiroshima to the chil
liest days of the Cold War. Some of it is
horrifying, but most is foolish and risible.
Kevin Rafferty, Jayne Loader and Pierce
Rafferty assembled the film as a contri
bution to the anti-nuke movement, but
most of it seems too remote and naive to
have any real political potency. Besides,
the tone of the movie, snide and super
cilious, becomes uncomfortable even if
you share the filmmakers' point of view,
and the film is maddeningly deficient in
identifying data throughout. The cross
cutting between propaganda and scenes
of crew-cutted Americans in indistin

guishable parlors under the spell of TV
hypnosis seems to be saying that the path
to nuclear holocaust is being paved by
blank-faced, ignorant middle-class
Americans with no taste — that the ugli
ness of the suburban landscape goes
hand in hand with the moral ugliness of
its crass inhabitants. Is there still an audi
ence for this kind of smug, wholesale
put-down of America?
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
Z(1969)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Costa-Gavras' political melodrama, a
thinly disguised dramatization of the
Lambrakis scandal in Greece four years
earlier (a political murder that led to the
exposure of layers of government cor
ruption), is so brilliantly calibrated and
so tense that it gets the viewer in a vise
grip; it exists right at the point where art
and emotional manipulation intersect.
Jorge Semprun adapted the novel by
Vassili Vassilikos, Mikis Theodorakis
wrote the stirring score, Raoul Coutard
photographed, and there's an unusually
distinctive cast (Yves Montand, Jean-
Louis Trintignant, Irene Papas, Renato
Salvatori, Marcel Bozzufi, Francois
Perier and Charles Denner).
Plays Wednesday with "Missing."
The Fourth Man (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Paul Verhoeven, the Dutch director,
made this masterful little movie with no
ideas but an exciting, sexy, ostentatious
surface. Jeroen Krabbe does first-rate
work in the role of a homosexual, al
coholic author with a gift for manipulat
ing circumstances to his own advantage.
About to board a train to Flushing,
where he has been hired to address a
literary club, he tries without success to
pick up a muscular young man (Thom
Hoffman). In Flushing, he allows himself
to be seduced by a wealthy widow
(Renee Soutendijk) and begins to enter
tain the prospect of living off her
generosity for a while, especially when
he learns that the Adonis from the train
station is her lover. What makes the film
nonsensical is the supernatural conflict
underpinning the sex story, but the Cath
olic imagery has astonishing clarity. The
best of it practically lifts Verhoeven into

the Bertolucci ranks, though unlike Ber
tolucci, Verhoeven's images operate
purely on the visceral level.
Plays tomorrow with "L'Argent."
Macbeth (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Roman Polanski's realistic setting of
the great tragedy is for 20th-century
audiences; bloody and seething with po
litical intrigue, it is the play Jan Kott
wrote about in his essay " 'Macbeth,' or
Death-Infected" in "Shakespeare Our
Contemporary." But it lacks mystery
and it is not gripping. Jon Finch and
Francesca Annis are a glamorous young
Macbeth and lady.
Plays Monday with "Romeo and
Juliet."
Follow the Fleet (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
By consensus, the three greatest Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals are
"Swing Time," "Top Hat" and"The
Gay Divorcee"; "Follow the Fleet" must
surely own fourth place. Astaire, in a
rare working-class role, plays a gum
chewing sailor who, on shore leave,
teams up with his old vaudeville partner,
Rogers, now a dance hall hostess, to win
a dance contest. The Dwight Taylor and
Allan Scott script (based on a play by
Hubert Osborne called "Shore Leave")
has its dead spots: There's a romance be
tween Rogers' sister and Astaire's buddy
that kills a good half hour of the continu
ity — not least because the second
bananas, Harriet Milliard and Randolph
Scott, to quote Arlene Croce, "go to
gether like red whiskey and Seconal."
But Mark Sandrich, the director, keeps
things light, and the glorious Irving Ber
lin score ("We Saw the Sea," "Let Your
self Go," "I'd Rather Lead a Band,"
"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Bas
ket," "Let's Face the Music and Dance")
provides the stars with some wonderful
opportunities. This was Rogers'
breakthrough film: Her dancing is ter
rific and her clowning ebullient. With
Lucille Ball and Betty Grable in bits.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Flying Down to Rio."
