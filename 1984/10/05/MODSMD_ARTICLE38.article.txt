# Former British diplomat praises Mondale policies

Walter Mondale's ideas are better
adapted to the nuclear age than are
President Reagan's, Lord Morrice
Saint Brides said yesterday at a Be
chtel International Center noon
luncheon speech.
Saint Brides, a former British am
bassador to Pakistan and a high
ranking diplomat in India, Africa and
Australia, spoke to about 50 people
on "The Nuclear Precipice: A
European View."
He said it has been "more a matter
of good luck than good management"
that nuclear war has not occurred
already and called for "new thinking"
by the superpowers to halt their arms
race and avert nuclear war.
"One of you (superpowers) has got
to want arms negotiations badly
enough to try and keep on trying," he
said.
Saint Brides said he believes
Mondale "sincerely means what he
says" regarding arms control since he

speaks from an informed perspective.
And though Reagan has some
"great ideas," they are "not well
adapted to the nuclear age" and tend
to vacillate depending "on who he
relies on for advice," Saint Brides
said.
Saint Brides said negotiations are
necessary to stop the nuclear arms
race because "history shows that
arms races invariably lead to war."
He recalled one quote indicative of
the attitude of both superpowers.
After the Cuban missile crisis, one
Soviet military official told him "we
will never again accept military in
feriority — even if we have to eat
grass."
In the past, revolutionary thinking
has temporarily slowed competition
between the superpowers, Saint
Brides said.
He referred to the first arms con
trol negotiations when the United
States and the Soviet Union agreed
not to produce anti-ballistic missile
defense systems.
"When else in history have two
powers foresworn defensive weap

ons?" he asked. That was
"sophisticated thinking compared
with the old more is best' thinking to
which both sides have reverted
today," he said.
He said the imminent prospect of
space-based weapons has made this a
critical time for arms control.
"There is enormous pressure to
build [space-based weapons] if they
will work," he said, noting that recent
studies have proven the viability of
anti-missile satellites which would
knock out airborne intercontinental
missiles with lasers.
"New thinking" will be needed to
solve the arms race problem, he said.
Both superpowers are responsible for
developing that new thinking, but the
open society of the U.S. is more likely
to discover an answer, he said.
The arms race is "visibly propelling
each side towards war,'* he con
cluded. Even so, the "sensible thing
to do is not to expect too much too
soon.
"Arms control negotiations are al
ways long, drawn-out, complicated
affairs," he said.
