# Students cash in on campaign

### MIKE HARVEY 
It's presidential election time once again, and
more than just the candidates are getting in on the
act.
In addition to the White Plaza crowd of "Reagan
Bashers" and "Mondale Mashers," an enterprising
group of Roble and Lagunita residents is seeking to
turn the upcoming election into a personal profit.
The undertaking, originally proposed by Busi
ness School Prof, and Roble Resident Fellow Evan
Porteus, is modeled on a similar project conducted
by the business school a few years ago — a project
that ultimately gained national press in The Wall
Street Journal. It consists of the trading of stocks in
which each share predicts a particular election
outcome.
Rather than selecting the obvious criterion of

who wins the election (bookies are giving 1,000:1
odds against Mondale), the Roble/Lagunita group
chose a more sophisticated, and less predictable,
scheme.
The criteria considered are 1) Voter turnout;
2) The percentage of women who vote for Reagan
and 3) The percentage of blacks who vote for
Mondale.
Following the elections, holders of the stocks
giving the correct predictions will be paid off at $4
per share. Meanwhile, the stocks will be traded
among students.
This trading is where all the action and potential
profit and loss is. The stocks went on sale Wednes
day evening and trading commenced immediately.
"It's like gambling," said Fred Yang, a Granada

freshman. "Actually, the whole thing is mostly a
way to stir up interest in the election and get us to
read the newspaper and stuff."
Alan Tripp, a Lagunita resident assistant in
volved with the program, corroborated Yang's
nonchalant attitude about the gambling.
"We don't expect anyone to make more than
$30 or $40 dollars," he said.
Furthermore, there will be a series of speakers
relevant to the election whose expertise may affect
trading. Sunday's Reagan-Mondale debate
will also be avidly watched with trading to follow
immediately after the broadcast.
All in all, excitement over the project is high and
students and staff alike are looking forward to
several weeks of fun and learning.
