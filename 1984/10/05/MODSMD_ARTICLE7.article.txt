FBI agent to plead innocent
SAN DIEGO — Richard Miller, the veteran FBI agent accused of
turning Soviet spy, asked a federal magistrate here yesterday to send him
to Los Angeles for trial so he can plead not guilty to charges that he pro
vided classified documents to two Soviet agents.
U.S. Magistrate Roger McKee ordered Miller, 47, taken to Los An
geles as soon as possible after the former Los Angeles-based FBI coun
terintelligence agent waived his right for a "removal hearing." Miller,
who was arrested late Tuesday at his home in the San Diego community
of Valley Center, faces a preliminary hearing in Los Angeles on Oct. 15
pending indictment by a grand jury.
Outside the courtroom, Miller's wife, Paula, and his son, Paul, linked
arms as they faced a crush of reporters. Miller's court-appointed attor
ney said "it would be presumptuous at this point to assume that Mr. Mil
ler is guilty."
John Moot, the attorney, said the criminal complaint against Miller
did not constitute evidence.
"Let me put it this way," he added. "If the DeLorean case has taught
us anything, it has taught us a healthy respect for our criminal system
and procedures."
John DeLorean waged a successful legal defense against cocaine traf
ficking charges by claiming entrapment by federal investigators. Moot
declined to say whether he or Miller believe the former agent was
entrapped by the FBI.
Miller, the first FBI agent ever charged with espionage, is accused of
trying to sell secret intelligence documents to Svetlana Ogo.odnikova,
34, reportedly a major in the Soviet KGB, and her husband, Nikolai
Ogorodnikov, 51, two members of the Russian emigre community in
Los Angeles.
Shuttle blastoff set for today
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The countdown continued yesterday
for today's sixth flight of the space shuttle Challenger, an eight-day mis
sion with a record crew of seven people, including two American women
and the first Canadian in space.
Liftoff was scheduled for 7:03 a.m. EDT. While the weather at the
Kennedy Space Center here was not expected to be a problem, rain and
poor visibility were anticipated at emergency backup sites in Spain and
West Germany.
The 13th shuttle mission will be commanded by Navy Capt. Robert
Crippen, 47, making his fourth space flight. Other crew members are
Sally Ride, 33, making her second shuttle flight; Kathryn Sullivan, 32, a
geologist and oceanographer who will be the first American woman to
walk in space; Lt. Cmdr. David Leestma, 35; Cmdr. Jon Mcßride, 41,
the pilot; Canadian Navy Cmdr. Marc Garneau, 35, whose main task
will be the study of the effects of acid rain on Canadian lakes; Paul
Scully-Power, 40, an Australian-born Navy oceanographer who will
photo-map large circular ocean eddies whose existence was documented
from space less than two years ago.
The shuttle flight is being billed as the "first that will be totally scien
tific in nature and totally earth-oriented in its science," accqrding to
Gary Graybeal of the Payloads Integration Office at Houston's Johnson
Space Center. "Even the space walk planned for the fifth day in flight is
designed to help us study the Earth."
Sandinista head visits California
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ortega, leader of Nicaragua's Sandinista
government, arrived here yesterday for meetings with celebrities, religi
ous leaders and others but put off a reception at City Hall for security
reasons.
Ortega, 39, was whisked from Los Angeles International Airport in a
police-escorted motorcade to a private residence in the plush Benedict
Canyon area of Beverly Hills. Security agents said he would stay there
during his four-day visit to California.
Although reporters had been told Ortega would hold a press confer
ence at the airport and that later he wouJd travel to City Hall for an offi
cial welcome by Deputy Mayor Grace Montanez Davis, those arrange
ments were abruptly canceled yesterday.
"It's tentatively been postponed till tomorrow," Davis said,
. .because, actually, it was not on his itinerary to begin with."
She explained that his staff had added the City Hall event without
alerting the Secret Service in enough time for security arrangements to
be made.
"He's a high-security-risk head of state," Davis said, adding that the
Secret Service had requested the delay as a result.
She said the City Hall appearance likely would be held today instead.
Ortega's schedule today includes a morning breakfast at a church with
some 45 religious leaders, said Don Casey of Agendas International, the
New York-based firm which handles U.S. public relations for Nicaragua.
And Davis said the City Hall event could easily be held after that ap
pearance.
Ortega is then scheduled to fly to San Francisco to address the Com
monwealth Club, and return to Los Angeles tonight.
Pope warns Peruvian bishops
VATICAN CITY — Pope John Paul II stepped once again yesterday
into the quarrel over liberation theology among Roman Catholic cler
gymen in Latin America by warning that the church's effort to help the
poor and oppressed must not be "pawned to ideologies foreign to the
faith."
Speaking to 33 Peruvian bishops, the pontiff admonished them to
stick to accepted theology "with a healthy Biblical interpretation," as
the Vatican recently decreed in condemning the Marxist aspects of
liberation theology.
The Peruvian bishops, who are making the regular visit to the Vatican
that all national episcopates make every five years, have been at the cen
ter of a worldwide controversy featuring some theologians who employ
Marxist ideas and analysis in their fight for the poor and oppressed.
Since arriving in Rome 10 days ago, the bishops have been consulting
with senior Vatican officials in an attempt to heal the rift between liberal
churchmen, who favor the liberation theologians, and Vatican-backed
conservatives, who do not.
Hinckley says he is getting well
WASHINGTON — John Hinckley Jr., in his fullest statement in open
court since he wounded President Reagan in an assassination attempt,
told a federal judge yesterday:"I am getting well. ... I am not the same
person I was two years ago, ... a sick young man."
At a hearing on his privileges at St. Elizabeths Hospital, Hinckley
tried unsuccessfully to persuade U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker
to loosen restrictions on his telephone calls and movements at the men
tal hospital in southeast Washington. He has been confined indoors
there for 27 months since he was found innocent by reason of insanity in
the March 1981 shootings of Reagan, White House Press Secretary
James Brady and two others.
"I now cherish my life and believe everyone's life is sacred and pre
cious. ... I will never again harm another human being," Hinckley told
the court.
In a seven-minute speech, Hinckley, 29, spoke clearly in a firm voice
and showed no hint of the emotional outbursts that had caused Parker to
call several recesses in his criminal trial two years ago. The outlines of a
bulletproof vest were apparent under his tan suit, and the courtroom was
ringed with 11 federal marshals.
After Parker granted Hinckley's request to address the court directly,
instead of through his attorney, the former Coloradan pleaded for un
restricted phone calls and interviews with reporters as well as an hour of
daily outdoor exercise.
Stock market bounces back
NEW YORK — The stock market bounced back from a four-session
decline with a modest rally yesterday.
Analysts said a drop in open-market interest rates gave stocks a lift in
a relatively quiet session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 33.90 points in the
last four trading days, rose 4.53 to 1,187.39.
Today's weather
Today, fair during the morning hours then increasingly cloudy during
the late afternoon. Highs in the 60s to the mid 70s.
