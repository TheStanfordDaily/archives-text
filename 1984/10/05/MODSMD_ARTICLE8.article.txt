# Federal workers sent home
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” As many as
half a million federal employees were
sent home from their jobs yesterday
after Congress failed to complete
work on a nearly $500 billion spend
ing bill in time to keep the govern
ment from technically going broke.
President Reagan ordered "non
essential" federal workers across the
nation to leave their posts shortly
after bleary-eyed senators took a
break to recuperate from a 22-hour
session held in the push toward
Congress' scheduled adjournment
today. It was the second time in three
years that a last-minute impasse left
the government without money to
pay most of its 2.9 million workers.
But late last night, the Senate fi
nally approved the $500 billion
spending bill to finance most of the

government for the next 12 months
and began negotiating with the House
for a quick compromise satisfactory
to President Reagan.
The "continuing resolution," wrap
ping funding for nearly two-thirds of
all government activities into one
package, was approved by voice vote
after inclusion of a compromise anti
crime bill that was hailed by Sens.
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) and Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.) as
landmark legislation.
Approval by the Republican
controlled Senate came 14 hours
after the 12:01 a.m. deadline for pas
sage of the measure, which the
Democratic-run House approved in
different form Sept. 25.
The delay was a key link in the
chain of events leading to the White

House order to shut down non
essential services at government
agencies whose funding would have
been restored by the bill. This led to a
1 p.m. exodus of about 500,000 gov
ernment workers nationwide.
Although a 36-hour renewal of
funding authority to allow the gov
ernment to reopen today was ap
proved by the House before the shut
down anil by the Senate afterwards,
two major obstacles remained in the
funding controversy: serious differ
ences between the House and Senate
and the possibility of a veto if they are
not resolved in a manner satisfactory
to the president.
House-Senate differences include
several major ones, ranging from aid
for anti-government guerrillas in

Nicaragua to water projects at home,
along with scores of minor disparities.
For water projects, the House
wants more immediate funding than
the Senate does: $139 million as
opposed to $82 million. In addition,
the House included new long-term
authorization tor at least $18 billion
in projects, which the Senate, consid
ering a different and less costly ap
proach, refused to include in its ver
sion of the spending measure.
The House wants to ban further aid
to the "contra" guerrillas, while the
Senate, responding to administration
pressure, wants to let it continue,
presumably up to a committee
authorized level of $28 million for the
year.
