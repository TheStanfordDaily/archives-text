# ABC poll shows president ahead
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Heading into Sunday's
presidential debate, President Reagan has a lead
over Walter Mondale broad enough to make possi
ble an electoral-college landslide and deep enough
to boost the hopes of Republican candidates for
other offices, the latest Washington Post-ABC
News poll shows.
The Sept. 22-Oct. 2 poll is a super-sized sample
of 12,000 persons that is designed to measure the
presidential race on a state-by-state, as well as a
national, basis. It also surveyed individual races for
the Senate and governorships.
Nationally, Reagan led his Democratic chal
lenger 55 percent to 37 percent. The margin is up
slightly from the 16-point, or 56-40 percent, lead in
a poll taken Sept. 6-11.
But the breadth of his lead was shown more
clearly by the state-by-state polls. Reagan led
everywhere except the District of Columbia and
Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, he and Mondale
are even. California and New York were the only
other states where Reagan's lead was less than 10
points.
The survey also showed that the Democrats

made little headway in the first month of the fall
campaign. The personal ratings of Mondale and
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.) have slipped fur
ther toward the negative since the early September
poll, while those of Reagan and Vice President
George Bush have improved slightly.
Moreover, Republicans have widened their lead
over the Democrats as the party voters trust to do a
better job in coping with the main problems facing
the nation. Last May, the Democrats led 42-40
percent on that measure. By early September, the
Republican were favored by a 49-39 percent mar
gin. In the new poll, the Republicans have a 47-33
percent lead — their largest ever.
In Senate races, the individual state samples sug
gest that Democrats are in position to challenge for
Republican-held seats in at least four states. But
Republicans, who once feared their 55-45 Senate
majority might be virtually eliminated, may now be
able to keep their losses to a minimum.
Democrats are far ahead in Tennessee, slightly
ahead in North Carolina and narrowly behind in Il
linois and lowa.The only Democratic-held seat that
looks promising to the GOP is in Massachusetts,

but right now the Democrats are slightly ahead
there.
The Post-ABC News poll did not ask voters for
their choice in the House of Representatives. But a
Market Opinion Research survey for the National
Republican Congressional Committee that came
out of the field the same day the Post-ABC poll
began and had a virtually identical (47-32 percent)
result on the party confidence question, showed a
very narrow margin for the Democrats on the con
gressional vote.
In the NRCC poll, respondents said they planned
to support Democratic candidates over Republican
candidates by a 47-44 percent margin. That was a
drop from a 50-41 percent margin in an August
GOP poll and a 51-43 percent edge in the early
September Post-ABC poll.
Continuation of that trend could set the stage for
Republicans gains in the November House elec
tions.
The gubernatorial battles, according to the Post-
ABC Poll, look a bit better for the Democrats.
