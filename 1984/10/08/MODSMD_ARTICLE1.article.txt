# Res Ed eyes reduction in co-op houses
## 
### JEANNE COOPER Staff writer 
Residential tducation may convert one of the six
campus co-op residences to a different form of housing
next year if administrators determine demand for the co
ops is too low.
Columbae, Hammarskjold House, Phi Psi, Synergy,
Terra and Theta Chi House host a combined 240 stu
dents, who prepare all meals and manage the residences
themselves.
Rodger Whitney, director of the Housing Center, said
although co-ops usually fill up eventually, it is often with
students who did not seek a co-op priority in the housing
draw.
"There has been a problem of filling some of the co
ops, even when we reserve some (44) spaces for the
graduate students. We consistently have a problem filling
all of the co-ops in spring draw with those who have listed
a co-op as top priority," he said.
"The problem surfaced again this year when we
restricted the co-ops to priority in round one of the draw,
and didn't fill the co-ops. We restricted them in round two
to just listing a co-op as a choice, and they still overall
didn't fill. So we'll be looking at supply and demand to see
if it's a problem."
Whitney will work with Diana Conklin, director of the
Row, in studying the co-ops' crisis. Conklin confirmed
"it's a possibility" that one of the co-ops will have to alter
its format.
"The question of whether we have too many co-ops for
student demand is on our agenda," she said.
In the co-ops, rumors vary as to which house will lose its
status. Tim Self, house manager of Cowell Cluster's Terra,
said, "There's a pretty heavy rumor going around that
they're going to close one of the houses, and the RAs said
that they heard it wou'd be Synergy or Terra."
Although Terra and Synergy still had vacancies early
last week, Whitney stresses that no house has yet been
singled out.
"Terra was in abysmal shape at the end of round two,
but this is hard to evaluate, because it was fine last year,"
Whitney said. "We're not sure if special houses have
problems or if there is a general co-op problem."
Self denies that Terra had particular difficulty attracting
residents this year.
"We didn't really have a problem; we filled off the
waiting list," he said. He attributes the overall lack of co
op demand to ignorance.
