Crime package passes
WASHINGTON Senate-House negotiators on a
catchall spending bill approved a major anti-crime pack
age Friday, all but assuring its enactment, but a continuing
deadlock over thorny defense issues forced a frustrated
Congress to pass yet another round of stop-gap funding
and to forgo its scheduled adjournment.
Riveting the 52-part anti-crime package to the year
long spending bill was a major victory for President
Reagan and congressional Republicans, who used in
genious tactics to get the legislation past resistant
Democrats.
The anti-crime package's most significant provisions
would abolish parole while reducing disparities in federal
sentencing; permit judges to jail "dangerous" defendants
before trial; make it harder for defendants to plead in
sanity; and crack down on drug trafficking.
The package also would set up a "drug czar" to coor
dinate federal enforcement efforts, a provision that the
administration reluctantly agreed to accept. Two years
ago, Reagan vetoed a seven-part crime bill because it con
tained a similar stipulation.
But conferees abandoned until tomorrow their talks on
the spending measure that contains the crime package
after they failed to agree on aid to Nicaraguan rebels; a
proposed ban on U.S. combat troops in Nicaragua and El
Salvador; and funds for President Reagan's "Star Wars"
space-based missile defense program and the testing of
anti-satellite weapons.
Unemployment rate dips
WASHINGTON — The nation's unemployment rate
dipped slightly to 7.4 percent during September, down
from 7.5 percent, the Department of Labor reported
Friday, indicating that the once-buoyant recovery is con
tinuing but has slowed to a moderate pace of expansion.
Unemployment has been "on a plateau for several
months" after its extremely strong growth earlier this
year, Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics,
told a hearing Friday of Congress' Joint Economic Com
mittee.
The generally optimistic September report, considered
another boost for President Reagan's re-election cam
paign, was seen at the White House as a harbinger of fur

ther economic recovery.
"The prospect is excellent for continued economic
growth and the creation of more jobs," White House
spokesman Larry Speakes said.
The most disturbing note in the September report came
in the number of manufacturing jobs, which fell by
125,000 in the first decline since the depths of the reces
sion in 1982, Norwood said. Employment fell in the auto,
metals and machinery industries.
Manufacturing companies usually are the first to feel
the impact of a coming business recession, but experts said
that September's decline would not be considered a
serious threat to the recovery unless the trend continues
for several months.
E. Germans seek asylum
HAMBURG, West Germany — A total of 140 East
Germans, 30 of them children, fled on Friday to the West
German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslavia, seeking politi
cal asylum, the West German newspaper Bild Am Son
ntag reported yesterday.
The newspaper said a number of refugees had climbed
over the eight-foot fence surrounding the building after
pushing their children through the wire.
Previous reports had put the number of East Germans
in the embassy at 90. Official figures were not available,
the newspaper said.
No information was forthcoming from Bonn, the West
German capital, on reported efforts to obtain exit permits
for the East Germans in negotiations with East Berlin of
ficials.
Reports from Prague on Saturday said Czechoslovakian
police had tightened security near the West German and
U.S. embassies, apparently in a bid to stop further East
German refugees from seeking asylum in diplomatic mis
sions.
Police checked the identities of pedestrians in the Vlas
ska alley, in which the West German and U.S. embassies
are situated, but did not hinder people from continuing on
their way.
Before the recent wave of asylum-seekers, people were
free to enter diplomatic missions in the Czechoslovakian
capital.
The West German foreign ministry ordered the gates to
the German Embassy closed on Friday after embassy per

sonnel were unable to cope with the steady stream of
refugees.
't was still unknown whether the West German Em
bassy would resume its normal activity today. About 800
Czechoslovakian citizens apply there daily for visas to visit
West Germany.
Shuttle flight continues
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space shuttle Chal
lenger became a giant pointer yesterday, literally swinging
as it travels around the Earth to aim an errant antenna at a
distant satellite.
The manuever saved the Challenger's principal experi
ment from near disaster, and scientists now hope to get at
least half of the data they had orginally expected from a
radar system that produces sharp photographs by
"seeing" through trees and clouds, and even parts of the
Earth.
The crew delayed the launching of a $40 million
climate-watching satellite for three hours on Saturday be
cause the satellite's electricity producing solar wings, cru
cial to i's mission, were frozen in place. After letting the
satellite warm in the sun's glow for a few orbits, astronaut
Sally Ride, a Stanford alumna, freed the wings with the
shuttle's robot arm and the satellite was sent into orbit.
Meanwhile, officials were debating whether to delay
until Thursday the first walk in space by a man-woman
team. It had been planned for tomorrow.
"We are seriously evaluating moving it (the space
walk)," said Cleon Lacefield, flight director. In that way,
he said, an ambitious radar mapping project could be
completed before crew members Kathy Sullivan and
David Leestma enter the cargo bay, preventing the possi
bility of the astronauts' hitting a troublesome antenna.
Lacefield said the radar antenna cannot be stored for
landing by normal procedures now, because the motor
that moves it was disabled to freeze the antenna in one
position.
Gromyko blasts U.S.
EAST BERLIN — In a strong attack on the Reagan
administration's disarmament policies, Soviet Foreign
Minster Andrei Gromyko on Saturday repeated the

Kremlin's accusations that the United States is "pursuing
an obsessive search to amass new weapons" and has no
genuine desire to limit research on arms for outer space.
Gromyko charged that the United States has upset the
balance of world power, aggravated global tension and
sought clear-cut military superiority over the Soviet
Union.
"The U.S.A. wants the world tailored to its own ways,"
he said. "This calculation is illusory."
Gromyko made his remarks at a formal address attend
ed by the East German hierarchy and high-ranking
delegations from other East bloc nations here for celebra
tions marking the 35th anniversary of the East German
state.
Gromyko's hard-line rhetoric was viewed as another in
dication that Moscow's public posture toward the Reagan
administration has not changed since Gromyko met last
month with Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz.
The Soviet foreign minister said Saturday those talks
convinced him that the United States is not seriously in
terested in entering a dialogue to limit the use of weapons
in space.
"The U.S. administration is trying to disguise that it
doesn't want to discuss space weapons research,"
Gromyko charged.
Prisoners exchanged
MEXICO CITY — Salvadoran civilian rebel leaders
announced Friday the completion of a complicated pris
oner exchange with the Salvadoran army, reflecting the
most extensive contact between the warring sides to date.
But the leaders, who appeared at an invitation-only
news conference here, said their overtures for peace
negotiations with the Salvadoran government of President
Jose Napoleon Duarte had gone unanswered. They
blamed the Reagan administration for holding Duarte
back.
The prisoner exchange agreement included a safe
conduct pledge by the government, allowing some 60
wounded rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Libera
tion Front to leave El Salvador for medical treatment
abroad. The wounded had been recuperating in rebel
held territory.

tinuing but has slowed to a moderate pace of expansion.
Unemployment has been "on a plateau for several
months" after its extremely strong growth earlier this
year, Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics,
told a hearing Friday of Congress' Joint Economic Com
mittee.
The generally optimistic September report, considered
another boost for President Reagan's re-election cam
paign, was seen at the White House as a harbinger of fur

ther economic recovery.
"The prospect is excellent for continued economic
growth and the creation of more jobs," White House
spokesman Larry Speakes said.
The most disturbing note in the September report came
in the number of manufacturing jobs, which fell by
125,000 in the first decline since the depths of the reces
sion in 1982, Norwood said. Employment fell in the auto,
metals and machinery industries.
Manufacturing companies usually are the first to feel
the impact of a coming business recession, but experts said
that September's decline would not be considered a
serious threat to the recovery unless the trend continues
for several months.
E. Germans seek asylum
HAMBURG, West Germany — A total of 140 East
Germans, 30 of them children, fled on Friday to the West
German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslavia, seeking politi
cal asylum, the West German newspaper Bild Am Son
ntag reported yesterday.
The newspaper said a number of refugees had climbed
over the eight-foot fence surrounding the building after
pushing their children through the wire.
Previous reports had put the number of East Germans
in the embassy at 90. Official figures were not available,
the newspaper said.
No information was forthcoming from Bonn, the West
German capital, on reported efforts to obtain exit permits
for the East Germans in negotiations with East Berlin of
ficials.
Reports from Prague on Saturday said Czechoslovakian
police had tightened security near the West German and
U.S. embassies, apparently in a bid to stop further East
German refugees from seeking asylum in diplomatic mis
sions.
Police checked the identities of pedestrians in the Vlas
ska alley, in which the West German and U.S. embassies
are situated, but did not hinder people from continuing on
their way.
Before the recent wave of asylum-seekers, people were
free to enter diplomatic missions in the Czechoslovakian
capital.
The West German foreign ministry ordered the gates to
the German Embassy closed on Friday after embassy per

sonnel were unable to cope with the steady stream of
refugees.
't was still unknown whether the West German Em
bassy would resume its normal activity today. About 800
Czechoslovakian citizens apply there daily for visas to visit
West Germany.
Shuttle flight continues
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space shuttle Chal
lenger became a giant pointer yesterday, literally swinging
as it travels around the Earth to aim an errant antenna at a
distant satellite.
The manuever saved the Challenger's principal experi
ment from near disaster, and scientists now hope to get at
least half of the data they had orginally expected from a
radar system that produces sharp photographs by
"seeing" through trees and clouds, and even parts of the
Earth.
The crew delayed the launching of a $40 million
climate-watching satellite for three hours on Saturday be
cause the satellite's electricity producing solar wings, cru
cial to i's mission, were frozen in place. After letting the
satellite warm in the sun's glow for a few orbits, astronaut
Sally Ride, a Stanford alumna, freed the wings with the
shuttle's robot arm and the satellite was sent into orbit.
Meanwhile, officials were debating whether to delay
until Thursday the first walk in space by a man-woman
team. It had been planned for tomorrow.
"We are seriously evaluating moving it (the space
walk)," said Cleon Lacefield, flight director. In that way,
he said, an ambitious radar mapping project could be
completed before crew members Kathy Sullivan and
David Leestma enter the cargo bay, preventing the possi
bility of the astronauts' hitting a troublesome antenna.
Lacefield said the radar antenna cannot be stored for
landing by normal procedures now, because the motor
that moves it was disabled to freeze the antenna in one
position.
Gromyko blasts U.S.
EAST BERLIN — In a strong attack on the Reagan
administration's disarmament policies, Soviet Foreign
Minster Andrei Gromyko on Saturday repeated the

Kremlin's accusations that the United States is "pursuing
an obsessive search to amass new weapons" and has no
genuine desire to limit research on arms for outer space.
Gromyko charged that the United States has upset the
balance of world power, aggravated global tension and
sought clear-cut military superiority over the Soviet
Union.
"The U.S.A. wants the world tailored to its own ways,"
he said. "This calculation is illusory."
Gromyko made his remarks at a formal address attend
ed by the East German hierarchy and high-ranking
delegations from other East bloc nations here for celebra
tions marking the 35th anniversary of the East German
state.
Gromyko's hard-line rhetoric was viewed as another in
dication that Moscow's public posture toward the Reagan
administration has not changed since Gromyko met last
month with Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz.
The Soviet foreign minister said Saturday those talks
convinced him that the United States is not seriously in
terested in entering a dialogue to limit the use of weapons
in space.
"The U.S. administration is trying to disguise that it
doesn't want to discuss space weapons research,"
Gromyko charged.
Prisoners exchanged
MEXICO CITY — Salvadoran civilian rebel leaders
announced Friday the completion of a complicated pris
oner exchange with the Salvadoran army, reflecting the
most extensive contact between the warring sides to date.
But the leaders, who appeared at an invitation-only
news conference here, said their overtures for peace
negotiations with the Salvadoran government of President
Jose Napoleon Duarte had gone unanswered. They
blamed the Reagan administration for holding Duarte
back.
The prisoner exchange agreement included a safe
conduct pledge by the government, allowing some 60
wounded rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Libera
tion Front to leave El Salvador for medical treatment
abroad. The wounded had been recuperating in rebel
held territory.

Crime package passes
WASHINGTON Senate-House negotiators on a
catchall spending bill approved a major anti-crime pack
age Friday, all but assuring its enactment, but a continuing
deadlock over thorny defense issues forced a frustrated
Congress to pass yet another round of stop-gap funding
and to forgo its scheduled adjournment.
Riveting the 52-part anti-crime package to the year
long spending bill was a major victory for President
Reagan and congressional Republicans, who used in
genious tactics to get the legislation past resistant
Democrats.
The anti-crime package's most significant provisions
would abolish parole while reducing disparities in federal
sentencing; permit judges to jail "dangerous" defendants
before trial; make it harder for defendants to plead in
sanity; and crack down on drug trafficking.
The package also would set up a "drug czar" to coor
dinate federal enforcement efforts, a provision that the
administration reluctantly agreed to accept. Two years
ago, Reagan vetoed a seven-part crime bill because it con
tained a similar stipulation.
But conferees abandoned until tomorrow their talks on
the spending measure that contains the crime package
after they failed to agree on aid to Nicaraguan rebels; a
proposed ban on U.S. combat troops in Nicaragua and El
Salvador; and funds for President Reagan's "Star Wars"
space-based missile defense program and the testing of
anti-satellite weapons.
