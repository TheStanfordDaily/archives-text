## The
						Stanford Daily Academic freedom 
### 
Unfettered scientific research.
It was a double-edged sword a century ago,
when Leland Stanford built his university against
the backdrop of an industrial revolution in which
technology promised the incredible and delivered
even more.
But in the nuclear age, how can freedom of in
quiry be reconciled with research that could lead
to the production of weapons of mass destruc
tion?
The Committee on Research has been wres
tling with that question for years. The group's
1983-84 report, which appears in its entirety in
the Oct. 3 Campus Report, will be considered by
the Faculty Senate on Thursday.
The majority report asserts that Stanford
should not restrict research based on
"speculations concerning the political or moral
impropriety" of its possible end use. The Univer
sity has officially held this view since 1971, and
for good reason. Anything less threatens to put
into peril the academic freedom that is Stanford.
This is not to dismiss the points raised by the
minority view, which recommends that "the Uni
versity refuse to accept any contract or grant
whose purpose includes the development, pro

duction or testing of weapons of mass destruc
tion."
That the nuclear threat must be addressed is
tantamount to our very existence. But by calling
for the establishment of a faculty committee to
screen potential research projects, the minority
would forfeit the rights and responsibilities of in
dividual scientists to freely pursue the work they
do best. A committee imbued with the power to
seal off vast areas of inquiry would close more
than laboratories. It would close minds.
The majority does more than encourage indi
vidual responsibility over groupthink. It asks the
University to take every possible step to provide
alternative jobs to researchers who feel their per
sonal beliefs are being compromised, and to
ensure that faculty and graduate students under
stand the ramifications of their research.
An open policy has risks, but as University
President Donald Kennedy told the Academic
Council last year, "No research can safely be
predicted to be free of harm â€” nor, conversely,
can a piece of work that includes a military end
use automatically be defined as 'bad.' "
In an age when science might make or break
us, we can't start closing doors. We might lock
ourselves out.
