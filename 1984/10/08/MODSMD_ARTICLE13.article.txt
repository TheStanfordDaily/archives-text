## Who's The Boss in this country? 
### 
1 was watching the Democratic Convention,
hoping that something unexpected would happen
to prevent Walter Mondale from winning the nom
ination. Predictably, however, anchor man Peter
Jennings announced that New Jersey would be the
state to put Mondale over the top. But then some
thing strange happened. The floor leader of the

VIEWPOINT

New Jersey delegation approached the mike and
shouted, "Forget the rules, the state of New Jersey
is casting all of its votes for Bruce Springsteen."
There was chaos on the floor. Scores of Mondale
staffers protested, but before they could make any
deals, Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson had already in
structed their delegates to vote for "The Boss."
Springsteen accepted the nomination via satellite
from Asbury Park, announced he would keep Fer
raro, and a new chapter was written in American
political history.
An incredulous Jennings turned to the ever
prepared pundit George Will and asked, "George,
what does this all mean?"
Will replied, "It all makes perfect sense, Peter.
Springsteen represents precisely those values which
the Democrats have made the theme of this con
vention: American jobs, American cars and Amer
ican women."
Jennings contacted reporter Sander Vanocur on
the floor. "Sander, what do feminists think of
Springsteen?"

"Well, Peter, as a matter of fact, feminists don't
like Springsteen, but apparently women do. The
consensus down here on the floor is that
Springsteen will be all right as long as he refrains
from calling Ms. Ferraro 'little girl.' "
Commentator Jeff Greenfield added, "Look for
Springsteen to make great strides in capturing the
men's vote, which has been overwhelmingly anti-
Mondale. That has been the real gender gap. A
Springsteen candidacy may force Reagan to do
something drastic to regain the confidence of men:
perhaps a promise to appoint Clint Eastwood to the
Supreme Court."
Democratic pollster Patrick Cadell was ecstatic.
"Springsteen is the ideal candidate to run against
Reagan. We always thought that if we had a left
wing version of Reagan, a "communicator" who
could weave evocative images out of simple but
well-put-together words, we could beat Reagan at
his own game.
"The best thing for us is that Springsteen starts
with an enormous electoral base, the industrial
states from Michigan to Pennsylvania. They like
him there because his $ongs sympathize with the
victims of the "Rust Bowl.' And he is worshipped
in New Jersey. Mondal? is trailing in these states,
and not because Reagan's policies are popular, but
because even Democratic blue-collar workers will
not tolerate another weak political hack.
"Over the years, Springsteen has conveyed a true
sense of commitment to the working man and the

unemployed, and, above all, 'The Boss' is not a
hack. He will not pander. He is not a wimp."
At this point, correspondent Sam Donaldson in
terrupted with, "I understand all that, Pat. But, is
he qualified?"
Cadell quickly responded, "He has the two
qualifications you need. He's 35 and, of course,
he's Born in the U.S.A. As for foreign policy, he is
perhaps better qualified than Ferraro. He has done
several world tours."
Greenfield interjected that in his years on the
concert circuit, Springsteen has become a for
midable stump speaker. "He can really move his
audiences with the short speeches he makes be
tween songs. In one, he tells of his thoughts during
a walk from the Lincoln Memorial to the Vietnam
Veterans' Memorial: 'It's a long walk from a gov
ernment that's supposed to represent all the people
to where we are today.' "
As time was running out in the broadcast, David
Brinkley took the mike to utter some of his usual
final sardonic words of wisdom: "I haven't heard
his music, but I've read the lyrics, and they're bet
ter than Mondale's. Heck, if our generation can
elect a B-movie hero, why can't the Pepsi Genera
tion clccl u Â£uitur hero?"
Before Nightline came on, 1 woke up from my
bizarre dream. Things were back to normal.
Mondale was speaking at a college campus some
where to a sparse crowd, and 1 still needed two
tickets to Springsteen's sold-out show in Oakland.
