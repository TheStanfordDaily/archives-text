Farm predictability
It appears that Stanford has been
infested by the worst of all evils:
predictability. After Gordon
Schmierer's piece on freshman wo
men (The Daily, Oct. 2) was read by
myself and some of my friends at
lunch (some of whom were female,
and who laughed), our conversation
turned to the topic of responses that
would be published in The Daily. We
"guesstimated" that a response
would appear on page four of The
Daily by the following Monday. We
said, "Boy, are the people who wrote
about the DUs and the Sigma Chis
last year going to have a field day
with this one." To set the record
straight before I continue, let me
state that we found Schmierer's piece
sexist, a bit off the wall, and yes,
humorous. We also assumed that the
population of Stanford would see

right through Schmierer's facade of
seriousness and find satire, as we did.
We were in error on many counts.
Nicole Forte and Barney Stein didn't
waste any time, and Daily readers
found two pieces on the Opinions
page on Thursday, Oct. 4, both
condemning Schmierer. Forte and
Stein will be happy to know that
most of us agreed with a great deal
of what they had to say. What disap
points me is the degree of predicta
bility that has crept into The Daily's
"Viewpoint/Rebuttal/More Rebut
tals" system. Yes, Nicole, the article
was offensive to Dean Fred's admin
istrative capacity, but don't you think
you should give Dean Fred's reputa
tion enough credit to carry itself
through an apparently humorous
article? And by the way, your com
ment about "testosterone produc
tion" was not subtle, and was taken
just as you wrote it, as a cheap shot.

But I'm straying from the point.
The responses were predictable,
and predictability leads to inef
fectiveness. The letters printed on
Oct. 4 were valid opinions, and The
Daily showed its usual editorial
character (a consistently strong one,
I might add) by running your letters,
Nicole and Barney. On the other
hand, an obvious lack of acknowl
edgement was evident in both of
your columns, and that is the ack
nowledgement of the fact that Stan
ford students aren't dumb. We saw
sexism when we read Schmierer's
column. We didn't need you to point
it out to us. Please don't stop writing
letters to The Daily, but please do
show us that you appreciate our level
of intelligence, and that you have
something new to present to us.

We Need USW
Everyone who works at Stanford
University must support United
Stanford Workers Local 680, be
cause without the union everyone
working here will be affected. Our
wages, benefits and working condi
tions are all due to the union. USW
fought for and negotiated these
things. The difference between the
bargaining unit members and the rest
of us who work here is that the bar
gaining unit members are covered
under a union contract, the clericals,
faculty and student workers are not.
The administration doesn't want
the union here in a real bad way. So,
we have to ask ourselves, why?
Perhaps it is because USW enforces
the contract agreement with the
administration.
