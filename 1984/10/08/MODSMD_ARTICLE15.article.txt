## $700 hammersâ€”who cares? 
### 
Over the past few weeks, newspapers and televi
sion news programs have been filled with stories
about the incredible prices the Department of
Defense is paying for its nuts and bolts and too!
kits. As in every election year, everyone is making
a b'g push to cut such wasteful government spend
ing.
But all this talk about $700 hammers is really
demonstrating a much larger problem. The prob
lem is that the defense establishment is just too
removed from the public's and others' oversight.
The defense budget is loaded with million-dollar
missiles and billion-dollar submarines. There are
no line items for washers and tool kits. The budget
is'enormous and complex, and as a result,
thousand-dollar flashlights are bought and paid for.
But far more important than the elusiveness of
the defense budget is the elusiveness of Defense
Department plans and policies and intelligence.
This information is frequently classified and kept
from the public and other countries as a matter of
protecting "the national security." The secrecy of
DoD strategy and war-fighting plans is even more
ominous in this day of nuclear weapons where
countries all over the world are involved in U.S.
calculations for nuclear war.
Puerto Rico, for example, has become an impor
tant link in U.S. operating plans in the event of nu
clear war. Thirteen military bases there are in some
way involved in the "nuclear game. Personnel on
some bases are trained tor duties related to nuclear
weapons. "War Rooms" with nuclear plans exist in
Puerto Rico, as do nuclear weapons storage
facilities. The U.S. involvement there means
Puerto Rico will almost assuredly be devastated in

the event of any nuclear conflict or crisis involving
the United States. It has become a nuclear target.
Yet Puerto Ricans had no knowledge of the role
they play in U.S. military strategy until a Washing
ton defense analyst presented his findings in early
September. By the Treaty of Tlatelolco, Puerto
Rico is in a nuclear free zone.
Does the Defense Department have the right to
classify the information regarding its involvement
in the Caribbean and keep it from the American
public and Puerto Ricans under the guise of
"national security," even though such involvement
clearly affects the safety of the island's people?
That is precisely what they do. It's the DoD's ver
sion of "what they don't know won't hurt them."
Classifying intelligence information allows the
government to manipulate "secret" numbers to suit
its purpose. DoD representatives testified before
Congress that the Soviets have an 8,000-warhead
advantage over the United States, and therefore we
need bigger defense budgets. Yet at the same time
President Reagan gave a speech describing how his
Strategic Modernization Program has brought us
back to a position of nuclear parity, claiming that
therefore we should elect him again. During the
same period, the DoD published a pamphlet called
"Soviet Military Power" which said the United
States trails the Soviet Union in several important
military categories, but not in warhead numbers. If
the numbers that the government officials are
basing their remarks on are classified, we can't fully
evaluate them, and they know it.
This is the kind of thing that goes on in the
Defense Department, hidden behind the shield of

"national security." The label has allowed DoD to
keep the public and U.S. allies from knowing what
they have the right to know. National security has
become a cover for illegal behavior and false state
ments and has enabled the DoD to move that much
further out of public reach. In light of incidents like
these, I find expensive tool kits insignificant.
In this era of renewed and overblown patriotism
1 find it shocking that we have so abandoned the
concept of government by the people when it
comes to the Defense Department. We've allowed
the DoD to put us at an arms length, and they are
keeping us there.
If $1600 washers get the public's attention
focused on the Defense Department, so much the
better. But, if budgetary considerations are the
only things that spark our interest or restrain the
DoD, then we are in a lot of trouble. The govern
ment is classifying information on a huge number
of subjects that we have the right to know about.
We should not let the defense establishment get so
far detatched from the very people it was estab
lished to defend. We should not let it get so far out
of reach, so insulated by "national security inter
ests, that all we can grasp on to is the tact that $700
is too much to pay for a hammer. Its time we
focused on and demanded to know about the plans
the government has for the planes, submarines and
missiles it needs nuts and bolts for, and not just
whether the nuts and bolts are too expensive or
not.
