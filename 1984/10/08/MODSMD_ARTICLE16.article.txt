## Sexism is not funny 
### 
In the Oct. 2 edition of The Daily,
a viewpoint entitled "Dean f-red s
last set of fresh(wo)men" was pub
lished, in which Gordon Schmierer
thanked Dean Hargadon tor having
chosen the women oi this year s
freshman class for their physical

beauty. Although Schmierer obvi
ously intended it as a light, amusing
piece, the article was deeply offensive
to us as self-respecting Stanford wo
men, and raises some very important
issues.
First, one must wonder just where
Schmierer went astray. He only
wanted to write a funny article, right?
So why are we so angry? Can't we
take a joke? We have, in fact, a good
sense of humor, but the key word
here is "good." There is a difference
between a good joke and one which
perpetuates harmful attitudes. A
good joke makes us laugh at the ig
norance of a sexist, a bigot or anyone
else who is insensitive to others'
human dignity. A joke that simply
ridicules women or blacks or any other
minority is nor funny. Not only is such
"humor" not funny, but it is very
harmful.
Schmierer shamelessly declares
that his is "by nature a sexist article."
The implication here is that sexism
can be taken lightly, that we can all
sympathize with Schmierer as he
ogles the freshwomen and thanks
Dean Fred for his "four year present
to mankind." Sexism, however, is no
joke. Would it be funny if Schmierer
had said that his was "by nature a
racist article"? No, obviously not.
Why, then, is sexism funny while rac
ism is not? We can only assume that it
is because people are not as conscious
of sexism as an all-pervasive form of
oppression.
There are, perhaps, some readers
who still do not understand what is so
wrong with Schmierer's article.
We've all heard the bewildered sexist
wondering aloud why "women can
never take a compliment." And
Schmierer was, after all, only com
menting favorably upon the charms
of this year's freshwomen, right?

Wrong. Schmierer did not simply
praise their beauty but suggested that
it was for their looks alone that they
were admitted to Stanford. A genuine
compliment on one's physical beauty,
for what that's worth, is acceptable.
But women, especially those who
have excelled to such an extent as to
have been admitted to Stanford, do
not want to feel that their worth is
defined solely by their looks. If
anyone still considers such back
handed "compliments" as
Schmierer's to be genuine he or she
should imagine how they must make
a woman feel.
Second, the freshwomen who take
Schmierer's article as representative
of male opinion at Stanford must feel
hopeless when faced by the fact that
however she may grow intellectually
and excel academically, whatever she
may accomplish at Stanford or later
in life, nothing will gain the recogni
tion of her male peers except her
"big, eager eyes": eager, we assume,
to gain their approval.
As for us, we don't belong to that
blessed generation of freshwomen.
Obviously, he considers it a waste of
our time to be "jogging and studying'
when we could be home, primping for
a party. Again, the idea is that wo
men's academic pursuits and other
personally fulfilling activities are sec
ondary to their physical attributes.
Its this basic sexist denial of a wo
man's right to be taken seriously as a
whole person, which makes
Schmierer's article so offensive.
Now that we have reduced all of
Gordon Schmierer's many
paragraphs of side-busting wit to this
one bitter premise, we may wonder
why such an article was ever pub
lished. Not only is such "humor"
deeply insulting, but The Daily, by al
lowing such an article to pass for wit,
tacitly endorses and thus perpetuates
the sexist attitudes which are so detri
mental to women's sense of self
worth, to men's ability to relate to
women, and to the intellectual envi
ronment in which we are all sup
posedly trying to learn and grow to
gether.
