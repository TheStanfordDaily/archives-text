## The 						Wanderings of Marilyn Wann I spent the 						night with a Domino's man 
### 
This wandering by Marilyn Wann marks the beginning of a
series, in which Wann will do some out of the ordinary
things, go to some out of the ordinary places and - with any
luck - li.ve to report about them.
By MARILYN WANN
Freshmen will do the silliest things. Take me, for exam
ple.
Instead of experimenting with aerodynamics at the Sun
day Flicks or solving the world hunger crisis over a round
of mocha javas at the Coffeehouse, I spent an evening
doing a job that makes insurance men cringe, an occupa
tion that would lest even Clini Eastwood's nerves, that
most greasy o, c late-night Stanford traditions: I delivered
Domino's pizzas.
It started simply enough. The story assignment read,
"Go around with a Domino's delivery man one night on
his runs . . . You get the idea."
I would have over a week before deadline. Fun, right?
Yes, but I wasn't so sure after I did it.
I resurfaced last Sunday night after a five-hour stint
riding shotgun for Domino's driver Mike McCarthy, a
two-year delivery veteran who could back down a twisting
walkway at 30 mph while I served as a human pizza
warmer for the pizzas on my lap. "Where have you
been?" screeched one of my dormmates.
My first urge was to list the addresses for the 31 pizzas
we delivered between 5:30 and 11 p.m. But I was merciful
and started the story at the beginning.
The Infiltration
It's not easy to infiltrate the Domino's system.
After two or three fruitless calls to the local store's
manager and even more useless debates with his super
visor's long distance answering machine, I realized I'd
never get the story without gutsy persistence.
So one night when someone on my floor ordered pizza.

I tripped down the hall, cornered McCarthy into promis
ing his help with the story, and grabbed two pieces with
sausage.
Domino's pays its drivers a $4 hourly rate, plus a 6.5
percent commission and any tips they get. Drivers like
McCarthy who try to average about $9 an hour are
rushed, and I didn't think the fast pace would allow time
for practical jokes.
I was wrong. He told me the only way to let me ride
with him. for insurance reasons, was as an employee for
the night. I was supposed to play it straight and apply for a
job with the manager. I put up with the Social Security
stuff, but when Asst. Manager Jeff Kissinger started get
ting out the W-4 forms and asking how many nights a
week I wanted to work, I got nervous.
Kissinger looked like he had just been caught on Can
did Camera when I told him all I wanted was a story for
The Daily, not a job. He needed the driver and moments
earlier had been explaining the problems with Stanford
deliveries.
"They never tip, either."
"Stanford students are really rude," the assistant
manager had said, waiting for me to agree. "That's just to
begin with. They never tip, either."
McCarthy confirmed this opinion when he got back
from his run and had finished laughing at my new-found
fashions: By this time, I had been outfitted in a patriotic,
all-polyester Domino's shirt and an oversized hat.
He said that meeting lots of people made up for the
rudeness factor, though.
"It's fun. It's a good job," said the 21-year-old Navy
pilot and database manager who uses driving as a second
job. "I met my fiancee in a car accident working for
Domino's. You can still see the dent on the front of the
car."

On the way to our first stop, a house on Byron Street.
McCarthy explained a delivery man's driving philosophy.
■ V\e break all the rules. We'll double park, triple park,"
he said, sprinting out of the still-idling car. --We'll park
anywhere.
We re not dangerous, though. We look both ways," he
said. At this moment we were zipping down a residential
side street in reverse, checking for numbers on the curb.
Once it got dark and started raining I could see why find
ing stops in the 30-minute time limit would require unus
ual tactics.
We got lost on the way to San Juan Hill, which
McCarthy called the "jock barracks." At one point we
thought we had spotted the place, a large house set back
from the street on a hill.
It was a good thing 1 was along because I realized we
were about to try to deliver a pizza to Donald Kennedy.
McCarthy's Laws
Most drivers don't know the area perfectly and rely on
the wall map in the store and a practiced sense about how
to get unlost.
There are some rules that help.
"The room you want is always at the other end of the
dorm from where you park," explained McCarthy. "The
outside doors to dorms will also usually be locked only
when the driver is running late."
1 here is also an etiquette for drivers besides the neces
sary health department rule of wearing a hat in the store.
"Always sprint into the store," McCarthy said, hoisting
a new stack of pizzas into their blue space-blanket holder,
and doing his best John Belushi impression.
"Cheeseboiger. Cheeseboiger."
We were off again on our second run to Toyon Hall that
night.

"Faster. Cheaper. Better," said one resident there to
explain why he chose Domino s.
"Tradition," said another.
Back in the Palo Alto Domino's headquarters on
Cambridge Avenue, at 1 0 p.m., my sense of lofty tradition
was giving way to confusion as I tried to calculate how
many times I had been around ( ampus Drive in the last
half hour.
McCarthy's warning to keep a sense of humor began to
take hold. "What would you do if a Stanford student
jumped in front of your car.' I asked over the ring of the
phone.
"Hope he's insured," McCarthy answered with a
straight face that soon broke into a chuckle.
McCarthy's shift was coming to an end when we got a
run for 745 Hunter Street. Don't look for that address on
a map, it doesn't exist. There's an intersection where that
address should be.
After about 15 minutes of sidewalk searching, we used
the phone of a man who kept coming out of his house to
give us advice, stuff like, "That's Mrs. Fuddlewitz's house
and I don't think she eats pizza." or "You'd better watch
out, the police were just here chasing some criminal."
Between the jokes and the deliveries, McCarthy ex
plained why he had wanted me to apply for his job tor a
night.
"That's really the only way you can find out what this is
like," he said. "Most Stanford students aren't poor;
maybe they've never had to work. They don't understand
a delivery man's job."
With six hours of understanding and a desire to change
out of my Domino's uniform, I had the happy idea that
some day I could tell my grandchildren that, yes, I spent a
night with a pizza delivery man.
The things freshmen will do.


Mike McCarthy, a Dominos delivery man who works in the Stanford area, has a job that is harder than most
people think. He's always on the run, and he has the responsibility of getting his customers what they want

— pizza. Being a Dominos deliveryman is not always easy as pie, but, according to McCarthy, it's always an
experience.
This wandering by Marilyn Wann marks the beginning of a
series, in which Wann will do some out of the ordinary
things, go to some out of the ordinary places and - with any

stuff, but when Asst. Manager Jeff Kissinger started get
ting out the W-4 forms and asking how many nights a
week I wanted to work, I got nervous.
Kissinger looked like he had just been caught on Can
did Camera when I told him all I wanted was a story for
The Daily, not a job. He needed the driver and moments
earlier had been explaining the problems with Stanford
deliveries.
"They never tip, either."
"Stanford students are really rude," the assistant
manager had said, waiting for me to agree. "That's just to
begin with. They never tip, either."
McCarthy confirmed this opinion when he got back
from his run and had finished laughing at my new-found
fashions: By this time, I had been outfitted in a patriotic,
all-polyester Domino's shirt and an oversized hat.
He said that meeting lots of people made up for the
rudeness factor, though.
"It's fun. It's a good job," said the 21-year-old Navy
pilot and database manager who uses driving as a second
job. "I met my fiancee in a car accident working for
Domino's. You can still see the dent on the front of the
car."

On the way to our first stop, a house on Byron Street.
McCarthy explained a delivery man's driving philosophy.
■ V\e break all the rules. We'll double park, triple park,"
he said, sprinting out of the still-idling car. --We'll park
anywhere.
We re not dangerous, though. We look both ways," he
said. At this moment we were zipping down a residential
side street in reverse, checking for numbers on the curb.
Once it got dark and started raining I could see why find
ing stops in the 30-minute time limit would require unus
ual tactics.
We got lost on the way to San Juan Hill, which
McCarthy called the "jock barracks." At one point we
thought we had spotted the place, a large house set back
from the street on a hill.
It was a good thing 1 was along because I realized we
were about to try to deliver a pizza to Donald Kennedy.
McCarthy's Laws
Most drivers don't know the area perfectly and rely on
the wall map in the store and a practiced sense about how
to get unlost.
There are some rules that help.
"The room you want is always at the other end of the
dorm from where you park," explained McCarthy. "The
outside doors to dorms will also usually be locked only
when the driver is running late."
1 here is also an etiquette for drivers besides the neces
sary health department rule of wearing a hat in the store.
"Always sprint into the store," McCarthy said, hoisting
a new stack of pizzas into their blue space-blanket holder,
and doing his best John Belushi impression.
"Cheeseboiger. Cheeseboiger."
We were off again on our second run to Toyon Hall that
night.

"Faster. Cheaper. Better," said one resident there to
explain why he chose Domino s.
"Tradition," said another.
Back in the Palo Alto Domino's headquarters on
Cambridge Avenue, at 1 0 p.m., my sense of lofty tradition
was giving way to confusion as I tried to calculate how
many times I had been around ( ampus Drive in the last
half hour.
McCarthy's warning to keep a sense of humor began to
take hold. "What would you do if a Stanford student
jumped in front of your car.' I asked over the ring of the
phone.
"Hope he's insured," McCarthy answered with a
straight face that soon broke into a chuckle.
McCarthy's shift was coming to an end when we got a
run for 745 Hunter Street. Don't look for that address on
a map, it doesn't exist. There's an intersection where that
address should be.
After about 15 minutes of sidewalk searching, we used
the phone of a man who kept coming out of his house to
give us advice, stuff like, "That's Mrs. Fuddlewitz's house
and I don't think she eats pizza." or "You'd better watch
out, the police were just here chasing some criminal."
Between the jokes and the deliveries, McCarthy ex
plained why he had wanted me to apply for his job tor a
night.
"That's really the only way you can find out what this is
like," he said. "Most Stanford students aren't poor;
maybe they've never had to work. They don't understand
a delivery man's job."
With six hours of understanding and a desire to change
out of my Domino's uniform, I had the happy idea that
some day I could tell my grandchildren that, yes, I spent a
night with a pizza delivery man.
The things freshmen will do.


Mike McCarthy, a Dominos delivery man who works in the Stanford area, has a job that is harder than most
people think. He's always on the run, and he has the responsibility of getting his customers what they want

— pizza. Being a Dominos deliveryman is not always easy as pie, but, according to McCarthy, it's always an
experience.
This wandering by Marilyn Wann marks the beginning of a
series, in which Wann will do some out of the ordinary
things, go to some out of the ordinary places and - with any
luck - li.ve to report about them.
By MARILYN WANN
Freshmen will do the silliest things. Take me, for exam
ple.
Instead of experimenting with aerodynamics at the Sun
day Flicks or solving the world hunger crisis over a round
of mocha javas at the Coffeehouse, I spent an evening
doing a job that makes insurance men cringe, an occupa
tion that would lest even Clini Eastwood's nerves, that
most greasy o, c late-night Stanford traditions: I delivered
Domino's pizzas.
It started simply enough. The story assignment read,
"Go around with a Domino's delivery man one night on
his runs . . . You get the idea."
I would have over a week before deadline. Fun, right?
Yes, but I wasn't so sure after I did it.
I resurfaced last Sunday night after a five-hour stint
riding shotgun for Domino's driver Mike McCarthy, a
two-year delivery veteran who could back down a twisting
walkway at 30 mph while I served as a human pizza
warmer for the pizzas on my lap. "Where have you
been?" screeched one of my dormmates.
My first urge was to list the addresses for the 31 pizzas
we delivered between 5:30 and 11 p.m. But I was merciful
and started the story at the beginning.
The Infiltration
It's not easy to infiltrate the Domino's system.
After two or three fruitless calls to the local store's
manager and even more useless debates with his super
visor's long distance answering machine, I realized I'd
never get the story without gutsy persistence.
So one night when someone on my floor ordered pizza.

I tripped down the hall, cornered McCarthy into promis
ing his help with the story, and grabbed two pieces with
sausage.
Domino's pays its drivers a $4 hourly rate, plus a 6.5
percent commission and any tips they get. Drivers like
McCarthy who try to average about $9 an hour are
rushed, and I didn't think the fast pace would allow time
for practical jokes.
I was wrong. He told me the only way to let me ride
with him. for insurance reasons, was as an employee for
the night. I was supposed to play it straight and apply for a
job with the manager. I put up with the Social Security
stuff, but when Asst. Manager Jeff Kissinger started get
ting out the W-4 forms and asking how many nights a
