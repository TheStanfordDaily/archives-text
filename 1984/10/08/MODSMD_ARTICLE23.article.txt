# Parking poses problems for many

### SHIRLEY WANG 
"Where can I park?"
This question must reverberate in
the heads of the countless Stanford
students, faculty and staff members
each morning as they drive on
campus in search of the closest possi
ble parking space to their classroom
or office.
For those who arrive on campus
before 7:30 a.m., there usually is no
problem. But it is different for those
who try to find a place to park after 8
a.m. These people wind from one
parking lot to another, hoping for
that right-in-front spot, but usually
ending up leaving their car two to
four blocks from their destination.
These are the individuals who
grumble about Stanford's "parking
problem."
According to Stanford's Police
Chief Marvin Herrington, approxi
mately 25,000 to 35,000 cars park
each day on campus in some 9,000
non-residential parking spaces.
"Some spots average one car a
day," said Herrington. "Others have
such rapid turnover that as many as
15 cars may occupy a single space
during a ten-hour period.
According to Herrington, from
Sept. 1, 1983, to July 1, 1.984, the
University sold 230,292 parking

stickers. Income from the sale of
those stickers, plus revenue from pay
parking lots, meters and daily per
mits amounted to $839,435. The bulk
of the total revenue was derived from
the sale of stickers.
An estimated $330,000 of that rev
enue goes to fund the Marguerite bus
system, which was set up in part to al
leviate parking problems.
"Parking services cost the Univer
sity approximately $535,000 a year,
and about $500,000 goes to parking
enforcement. None of the revenue is
used to resurface existing parking lots
or to provide for additional parking
places," Herrington said.
In order to alleviate the parking
problem, plans are being developed
to build a multi-level parking facility
on Campus Drive near Roth Way and
the Medical Center — the first high
rise parking facility in the Univer
sity's history. This estimated $7-10
million parking structure would
house some 800 to 1,000 vehicles.
This proposal has already received
site approval from the Stanford com
munity Land and Building Develop
ment Committee. It has also received
concept and site approval from the
University's Administrative Council,
and is scheduled to go before the
Board of Trustees for approval to

morrow.
Stanford fares better than most
universities, where room to provide
parking is nonexistent or strictly lim
ited. Yet, according to Herrington,
"We have enough parking spaces, but
not where everyone wants them."
In general, academic facilities have
a higher priority on use of land than
parking does. The result is that as
more buildings are constructed on
campus, there is an effort to keep
them reasonably near each other to
foster an "academic closeness." But
in that process, parking areas get
pushed out more and more to the
perimeters of campus.
Director of Planning Phil Williams
said, "Some people don't like to be
inconvenienced even by walking a
short distance from their car to their
work. Others are upset because they
have to pay for parking."
A "C" sticker, which allows a per
son to park in the outer lots, costs $20
a year. An "A" sticker, which allows
its owner to park closer to the campus
core, costs $ 100 a year. If the Univer
sity did provide free employee
parking, the costs would have to be
absorbed in academic budgets, a solu
tion that may not be possible at a uni
versity that is encountering soaring
expenses.

Public parking for public events is
free here most of the time. This sum
mer marked the first time that there
was a charge at a public event — the
Olympic soccer games.
The Super Bowl game that will be
held on campus in January also might
have public parking lots with a
charge, particularly those parking
areas closest to the stadium.
The proposed Reagan library may
pose another parking problem on the
Farm. Though the site of the pro
posed library has not yet been deter
mined, the facility could draw
hundreds of thousands of visitors —
and their vehicles — a year.
To ease the parking problem on
campus, the University Committee
on Parking and Transportation has
made several recommendations:
• The level of service of the Mar
guerite shuttle system should con
tinue throughout the 1984-85 aca
demic year.
• With the exception of service vehi
cle permits, there should be no
change in permit prices. Service vehi
cle permits should cost $150.
• Permit prices should be pro-rated
only on a quarterly basis where pur
chases are made for less than a full
year.


A parking ticket is a familiar greeting for many people here who are
victims of the parking place shortage. The problem is getting attention,
though. Plans for new parking structures will be discussed by the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees this week.
