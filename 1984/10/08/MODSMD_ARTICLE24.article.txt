## Stanford defense, running keys in victory 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Pasadena — The Stanford football
team is doing things a bit differently
this season. It's playing solid defense
and it's running the ball effectively.
It's also winning football games.
Stanford's latest victim was the
UCLA Bruins, by a 23-21 score. Yes,
the same UCLA Bruins that have
gone to — and won — the past two
Rose Bowls. The same UCLA Bruins
that hadn't lost a Pacific 10 Confer
ence game in Pasadena's 104,091-
seat Rose Bowl since making it their
home three years ago. And the same
UCLA Bruins that were ranked No. 1
by Sports Illustrated in its preseason
football issue.
"It's the biggest win this week."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway joked.
"But, seriously, I can't remember
when I was happier or as thrilled for a
football team than I am today.
"I don't like to use cliches," he
said, "but there was nothing but in
tensity from our team. I was very
pleased with our performance."
Stanford improved its record to 3-2
overall and 1-1 in the Pac-lOwith the
victory, its first over UCLA in Los
Angeles since 1970. However, it
wasn't so much the end result that put
a smile on Elway's face. It was the
means.
Stanford won with defense and
rushing, not with its trademark — the
pass. It did it with a backup quarter
back, Fred Buckley, who had a total
of five downs of collegiate experience
before Saturday. It did it with a full
back, Brad Muster, who was No. 3
on the depth chart at the start of the
season.
And Stanford did it without quar
terback John Paye, who watched the
game from the stands with a splint on
his right index finger. And without
starting tailback Thomas Henley,
who watched most of the»game from
the sideline after spraining his left
shoulder in the first half.
Although the Cardinal had just 213
vards in total offense, it was good

enough to capitalize on early Bruin
turnovers and take a 20-0 lead with
5:15 left in the first half. A Buckley
to-Jeff James, 22-yard touchdown
pass after an interception by Dave
Wyman gave Stanford that lead, hut
it also woke up the Bruins, who then
began chippping away at the deficit.
Stanford could manage only a
third-quarter Mark Harmon field
goal — his third of the game — the
rest of the way. It was barely enough.
Three UCLA touchdowns cut
Stanford's lead to 23-21 and, with
2:47 remaining, the Bruins had the
ball on their own 27-yard line.
Placekicker John Lee, who has made
all 14 of his field goal tries this
season, was warming up on the Bruin
sideline.
"We were all just looking at each
other and saying, 'This is the game.
We've got to stop them,' " Wyman
said of UCLA's final series. "And we
did it."
An illegal motion penalty, a 14-
yard completion and a run up the
middle for no gain left UCLA with
third and one on its 36. Less than
1:30 remained in the game and the
clock was running.
"It was supposed to be a play
where we could throw the ball for a
10-yard chunk of yardage and get out
of bounds and stop the clock at the
same time," UCLA Coach Terry
Donahue said of the third-down play.
"And if it wasn't there, throw the ball
out of bounds and stop the clock and
go for it on fourth and one.
"The quarterback got pressured,
and when he got pressured on the
front side, he turned around on the
back side and someone was there. He
didn't get the ball unloaded."
In other words, quarterback sack.
Cardinal defensive lineman Pat
Mitchel grabbed Bruin quarterback
Matt Stevens by the shirt, spun him
around and let defensive lineman
Garin Veris and blitzing linebacker
Tom Briehl finish Stevens off.
Instead of fourth and one, it was
fourtH and 11. And, after running

back Bryan Wiley was stopped short
of the first down, it was Stanford's
ball. Buckley fell on it twice, the final
1:03 ran off the clock and 23-21 was
the final score.
Few were happier — and relieved
— than Buckley, who was making his
first collegiate start. "For my first
start to come down here and beat
UCLA, I'm pleased by that," he said.
"Obviously, there are things I need to
work on." Buckley was 9-of-21 for
83 yards and had a touchdown pass
and two interceptions.
Had it not been for a 1:05 span in
the fourth quarter, the hundreds of
Stanford fans who had traveled to
Los Angeles might not have been
biting their fingernails in the closing
minutes. Twice in that period the
Bruins dodged bullets that, had they
hit, would have meant a repeat of last
season, when UCLA had come from
behind in the fourth period to defeat
the Cardinal.
With 10:40 to go, a penalty on
Veris for roughing Lee on a field goal
attempt gave the Bruins a first and
goal on the Cardinal six. On the next
play, Wiley scored over the right side.
UCLA made the two-point conver
sion, and Stanford's lead closed to
23-15.
.On the ensuing kickoff, Kevin
Scott took the ball on the goal line
and didn't stop until he was tripped
up 89 yards later. "All I saw was open
space and I turned it on upfield,"
Scott said. "I was trying to set up that
final block (and score), but I guess I
didn't do a very good job."
But just as Stanford appeared close
to scoring, the tide turned. On second
and 10 from the Bruins' 11, Buckley
rolled out left and threw to the
endzone for tight end Dan
field. The ball was caught, but by
UCLA safety James Washington.
Six plays and less than three
minutes later, Stevens passed 60
yards to receiver Mike Sherrard, who
beat Mark Hashimoto by five yards.
Sherrard's touchdown cut the Car
dinal's lead to 23-21. The Bruins

tried to tie the score with another
two-point conversion, but Wyman
stopped running back James Primus
short of the goal line.
Card notes
Henley's shoulder was X-rayed yes
terday, but the extent of the injury
was not known last night. Henlev was

the only Cardinal injured seriously
Saturday.
With victories over UCLA and Illi
nois this season, Stanford has beaten
both 1984 Rose Bowl teams. UCLA
defeated Illinois, 45-9, last Jan. 1.
Harmon's three field goals tied him
with Rod Garcia for most Stanford

career field goals with 42. Harmon is
perfect so far this season — 6-for-6 in
field goals and 12-for-12 in extra
points. Harmon, a senior, is currently
third on Stanford's all-time scoring
list with 217 points, behind Ken
Nabor with 236 and Darrin Nelson
with 242.


Adam Grossman/Daily
Linebacker Dave Wyman intercepted a pass by UCLA's Matt Stevens in the second quarter Saturday and
returned it 26 yards. It was Wyman's second interception of this season and it set up a touchdown that put
the Cardinal ahead, 20-0.
