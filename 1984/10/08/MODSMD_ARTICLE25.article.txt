# Running game wasn't planned

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
PASADENA — For a Stanford
football fan used to seeing big
passing statistics, Saturday's offen
sive numbers against UCLA were
startling.
The Cardinal ran 71 plays — 50
rushing, 21 passing. It had 213
yards in total offense — 150 rush
ing, 83 passing. It had 16 first
downs— 10 rushing, four passing
and two by penalty. And Stanford,
a team known for quick scoring
strikes, held the ball nearly 10
minutes longer than UCLA, 34:30
to 25:30.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
could have said he was planning to
run and run and run against the
Bruins. He didn't because he
wasn't.
"We wanted to run,"he said,
"we just didn't know how well we
would run. But we ran well and
were able to get outside. We had
success with it, so we stayed with
it."
Carrying almost the entire load
for the Cardinal were a pair of

sophomores — fullback Brad
Muster and tailback Kevin Scott.
Muster rushed 24 times for 82
yards (an average of 3.41 per play)
and Scott 16 times for 53 yards (a
3.31 average).
Scott filled in for an injured
Thomas Henley, who suffered a
sprained left shoulder in the first
half.
Muster started the game as both
Brian Morris and Kaulana Park
were slowed by injuries. Muster
began the season No. 3 on the full
back depth chart, but didn't
surprise Elway with his perfor
mance.
Said Elway, who has praised
Muster frequently this season,
"He had a hell of a game, didn't
he?"
Said Muster, who all season has
been patiently — and quietly —
waiting his turn, "There were
some big holes there and I just
took them."
The Stanford rushing attack was
particularly important Saturday
