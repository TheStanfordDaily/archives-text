# Cardinal sweeps 2 Arizona schools
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON 
It was a very satisfying weekend for
the Stanford women's volleyball team
ais the Cardinal swept six games
Friday and Saturday to defeat the
University of Arizona and Arizona
State University in Western Col
legiate Athletic Association action.
The win over Arizona, 15-1, 15-9,
15-10, was easier than the Cardinal,
now 6-1 overall and 3-1 in the
WCAA, had anticipated. The
Wildcats, ranked ninth nationally,
played without their top two middle
blockers, including All-America
Melissa McLinden who was sidelined
with an ankle injury.
The result was a definite mismatch
at the net, as Arizona's Caren Kem
ner filled in for McLinden and was set
against top Cardinal players Kim
Oden and Bobbie Broer.
Cardinal Asst. Coach Don Shaw
said, "The confrontation at the net
which we expected never
materialized. Caren Kemner just
couldn't handle it all by herself."
The Cardinal started out the match
playing superb volleyball, winning the
first game 15-1. Shaw said, "We try
to prepare ourselves to play our very
best at the beginning of a match. We
figure our opponent has the same at
titude. Arizona just didn't start out
well, whereas we were ready to go.
The loss of two middle blockers can
also be mentally as well as physically
devastating."
The Cardinal came out strong and
set a quick pace in the match with
smart, communicative play. Stanford

dominated the net play throughout
the match, taking much of the air out
of Arizona's offense through intense
blocking pressure.
Stanford defeated ASU 15-11, 15-
3, 15-12. The Sun Devils, ranked
19th in the nation, came into the
game against Stanford with a 6-4
overall record.
The first game had several amazing
one-handed digs by the ASU defense,
but Stanford's offense prevailed to
win 15-11.
The Cardinal showed character in
the third game, overcoming a 10
point deficit to win the match. ASU
gained its biggest lead of the game at
11-1 through concentrating on
playing off Stanford's block. The Sun
Devils caught the Cardinal off guard
on several points with soft dinks and
off-speed hits.
But the Cardinal retaliated, blitzing
ASU with its quick offense. Shaw
said, "We were controlling the ball
well tonight with our passing, which
allowed us to go to the fast offense
more often. Kim (Oden) and Bobbie
(Broer) had fast swings and were very
quick tonight too."
The Cardinal setters, Diedra
Dvorak and Wendi Rush, also had
good performances against ASU.
Rush, a freshman from Lake Ar
rowhead said, "College volleyball is a
lot faster game. I've had to adjust to
setting to different players. The
coaches and players have really
helped me make the transition,
though. It's great here."

Junior hitter Kim Oden is known mainly for her net play since she led
the nation in blocks last season. She was also in the top 10 in hitting
percentage and kills per game.
