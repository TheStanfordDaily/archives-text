# Water polo team beats USC, UCLA
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford water polo team
jumped to a first-place lead in the
Pacific 10 Conference this weekend
as it won its first two league games of
the season against hosts USC and
UCLA.
Stanford, now 12-2 overall,
defeated USC, 9-8, on Friday and
UCLA, 10-7, on Saturday morning.
Though the Cardinal won both of its
games, Coach Dante Dettamanti said
he was most pleased with the team's
close victory over USC.
"We jumped out to a quick 2-0
lead early in the match but from then
on the play was extremely tough and
competitive," Dettamanti said. "Our
guys really did well, considering they
had to play hard all four quarters."
The score was tied 4,-4 at the half,
but the Trojans moved out to an 8-7
lead with 2:46 remaining in the game.
With 2:39 remaining, a USC player
was ejected for 35 seconds, giving the
Cardinal a 6-5 advantage. Detta
manti called his last timeout and set
up a scoring play for the team. A few
seconds later David Imbernino
scored to even the score at eight.
Craig Klass scored from the hole
with 1:26 remaining to give Stanford
the win. According to Dettamanti,
this goal in a tight situation was typi
cal of Klass' fine play in both games.
"Craig is really becoming a scoring
threat from the hole and his increas
ing ablility to score is now one of the
keys to our team," Dettamanti
said."The holeman is the backbone of

any team, and both Klass and
(freshman Erich) Fisher are doing
very well in the hole for us."
Klass and Imbernino each had
three goals and Fisher had two for the
Cardinal against USC.
In Saturday's match against
UCLA, the Cardinal "came out
smoking" and never stopped, Detta
manti said. Stanford jumped out to a
4-0 lead in the first quarter and led by
six by the end of the first half.
"Our victory over USC the day
before really helped us coming into
the UCLA game," Dettamanti said.
"Friday's big win gave us a lot of ex
tra confidence and helped us relax so
that we could play our best. We had
lost to the Bruins earlier in the season
and the ,:am really wanted to avenge
that loss."
Stanford's balanced scoring attack
was a major factor in the UCLA
game. Jose Velez, Marvin Mouc
hawar, Klass and Imbernino each
scored two goals and Greg Ocasek
and Fisher added one apiece for the
Cardinal. This even and consistent
scoring is something Dettamanti sees
as very important.
"These two victories have proven
that we are an overall good water
polo team. We are balancing out our
scoring, we are very consistent and
we have a lot of confidence," Detta
manti said. "We can now go into
every one of our games knowing we
can win. That's a pretty great
feeling."
