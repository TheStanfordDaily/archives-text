# Cardinal golfers 5th at LSU
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford men's golf team
finished a hectic, two-tournament
week with a fifth-place finish at the
Louisiana State University Invita
tional over the weekend.
The Cardinal's seemingly mediocre
finish in the 12-team tournament may
be a bit deceiving. The team ended up
only 11 strokes behind the University
of Oklahoma, which won the tourna
ment.
Oklahoma, in fact, just barely won
the tournament. The Sooners finished
with a three-round total of 870, while
Auburn was right behind with 871.
Coach Tim Schaaf didn't place any
special importance on doing well at
this tournament, but used it as an op
portunity to get tournament experi
ence for some members of the team.
This tournament did feature better
teams than the Wolfpack Invitational
earlier last week, in which the Car
dinal finished second.
That experience will be especially
important when the Cardinal hosts
the Stanford Fall Intercollegiate, Oct.
19 and 20. The tournament will
feature some of the top teams in the
country, as well as Stanford's top
West Coast opponents, UCLA and
use.
At LSU, the Cardinal was once
again by senior Doug
Thompson, who finished tied for
fourth with a total of 216. The rest of
the Cardinal finished out of the top
10.
Thompson, a fifth-year senior, has
qualified for the U.S. Amateur
Championship.
After the Stanford Fall Intercol
legiate, the Cardinal will compete in
the University of the Pacific Fall Invi
tational at Stockton.
