### DARREN WOODRUFF 
With many of its top runners returning from various in
juries, the Stanford women's cross country team placed
five in the top 10 and won the Stanford Invitational by 24
points Saturday.
The Cardinal women used a one-two-three finish and
eighth and ninth placings to hold off second place Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and third place University of New
Mexico.
Senior team captain Regina Jacobs barely broke a
sweat in the race, breaking teammate Alison Wiley's
course record by two seconds with a time of 16 minutes,
15.6 seconds in the five kilometer race.
"It was a fun race," Jacobs said. "The team did well
coming back from their injuries. It took a lot of courage."
Junior Wiley and freshman Kathy Smith finished
second and third, respectively, with times of 16:50 and
17:07.
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson was "happy" with the
outcome of the women's race but said that senior Ceci
Hopp, who was hampered with a sore ankle from training,
"could have had a better time." Hopp finished ninth with
a time of 17:31.8.
Cardinal freshman Christa Curtin was elbowed out of a
seventh-place finish by Cal Poly-SLO's Vicky Bray, who
ran a 17:27.5. Curtin was eighth with a 17:27.6.

Regarding the men's race, Johnson said he "hoped the
men would do as well as the women," but the Cardinal
men finished in 10th place with 279 points.
Stanford sophomore Marc Oleson ran a repeat of the
Fresno Invitational two weeks ago, again losing first place
to Fresno State's Peter Brett, who had a 30:21.1 on the
10-kilometer course. Oleson finished in 30:41.6, IK
seconds better than his finish at last year's Stanford Invi
tational.
Johnson said he "was happy with Marc's time. He did a
good job in spite of being sick with a cold."
The cold bug might have affected the rest of the Stan
ford men's team. Only junior Charles Alexander finished
with Oleson in the top 30, with a time of 31:58.6.
Senior Brian Pettingill, 99th in the race with a 33:40,
said, "I felt confident at the beginning of the race but
during the run I felt sick and couldn't breathe very well."
Freshman Steve Schadler, running in his second 10-
kilometer race, finished 89th with a time of 33:32:5.
"It hurt but I have to get used to it," Schadler said.
Asked about the Cardinal men's potential for the rest of
this season Johnson said, "I may be overly ambitious, but
I think we can make it to the (National Collegiate Athletic
Association) Nationals if we get it together. Anything can
happen if you're a competitor."
Stanford will compete in the CaiyNike Invitational at
Berkeley Saturday.
