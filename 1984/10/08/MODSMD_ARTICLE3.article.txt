# Trustees to discuss Near West campus
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Plans to develop the Near West campus, to ex
pand the Graduate School of Business, to install a
state-of-the-art telecommunications system and to
build the first University parking structure are
among the items the Board of Trustees will act
upon today and tomorrow.
The board's Committee on Academic Affairs and
Development will hear a status report on develop
ment of the Near West campus at its meeting this
afternoon. University plans indicate that this area
will be broken into two quadrangles: the Biol
ogy/Chemistry Quad and the Science and Engi
neering Quad.
According to the trustees' 105-page agenda, the
departments currently sitting in the Science and
Engineering Quad area "are housed in antiquated
buildings that lack both the physical features and
support services necessary for modern science."
Specifically, the agenda notes that "the Applied

Physics Department and the Electrical Engineering
faculty working in the Gintzon Laboratory are in
greatest need of incremental space and refurbish
ment or replacement of existing space."
The board will review plans for an annex to the
Applied Physics Department and the Gintzon Lab,
estimated to cost approximately $2 million, in or
der to satisfy this need. Trustees will also consider
project and design approval for the Laboratory
Surge Building, another Near West campus pro
posal.
The $14 million Laboratory Surge Building
would accommodate the immediate overflow needs
of the Biology, Chemical Engineering and
Chemistry departments.
In other construction business, the board will
consider the concept of a medical school office
building. Last December, the board gave the con
ceptual go-ahead to two other medical center
developments: the Center for Molecular and Ge
netic Medicine and the Research Animal Facility

11. All three proposals should return to the board in
December for concept and project approvals.
In a Sept. 26 letter to board members from Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and Provost
James Rosse, the necessity for development and
construction is underscored.
"If Stanford is to move forward in the years
ahead, we are in for a decade of building activity,"
the letter says.
GSB expansion
According to arguments presented in the agenda,
the Graduate School of Business needs another
building to accommodate increases in faculty and
to replace existing temporary facilities. The board
approved the concept last September, and tomor
row trustees will discuss and, perhaps, approve a
site.
