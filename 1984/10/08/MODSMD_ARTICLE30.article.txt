The Stanford men's soccer team
met their most highly-regarded op
ponent of the season — second
ranked UCLA — and tied the Bruins,
2-2 in away action Saturday.
The Cardinal were led by the
Rafalovich brothers, Todd and Tom,
who each scored in the match, which
made Stanford's record 5-3-3 and
dropped UCLA to 8-0-2. Tom as
sisted on Todd's goal, and Giancarlo
Ferruzzi assisted on Tom's.
UCLA came into the game ranked
behind Indiana, and was rated No. 1
on the Far West, while Stanford was
unranked nationally and No. 9 in the
Far West.

The game ended a 1-1 tie after
regulation, each team scoring first
half goals. The Cardinal and the
Bruins then traded goals in the 10-
minute overtime period.
UCLA's goals were scored by Tom
Silvas and junior midfielder Dale
Ervine, who many consider to be a
candidate for All-America honors.
Ferruzzi, a senior striker, continues
to lead the Cardinal in scoring and
now has three goals and five assists
for 11 points. Tom Rafalovich has
seven points on two goals and three
assists, which ties him for second with
Rob West, who has three goals and
an assist. Todd Rafalovich has three
goals for six points.
Goalkeeper Willy Burkhardt

jumped from seventh place last week
among Pacific Soccer Conference
goalkeepers to second before this
weekend's games.
Despite allowing three goals
against Fresno State Oct. 3 and two
on Saturday to UCLA, Burkhardt's
goals-against-average is still a respec
table 1.27, which should keep him in
second place in the PSC. The Univer
sity of California at Berkeley's Todd
Harmon is first, having allowed five
goals in the first 10 games for a 0.50
goals-against average.
The Cardinal returns home after
three straight road games when it
meets St. Mary's at 3 p.m. at Stan
ford's Maloney Field Wednesday.
