### 
SAN DIEGO (AP) — The San Diego Padres,
sparked by Tony Gwynn's tie-breaking double in a
four-run seventh inning and strong relief pitching,
won their first National League pennant yesterday,
rallying to beat Rick Sutcliffe and the Chicago
Cubs, 6-3, in Game Five of the National League
playoffs.
The victory completed an unprecedented come
back in National League playoff history and sent
the Padres, now in their 16th season, into the 1984
World Series against the American League cham
pion Detroit Tigers.
The Padres, who will host the Series opener to
morrow, became the first National League team to

win a pennant playoff after losing the first two
games.
The Milwaukee Brewers of 1982 were the only
other team to win a best-of-5 league championship
series after being down by two games.
For the Cubs, it was another in a long list of
frustrations. Chicago, one of the charter members
of the National League, had not won a pennant
since 1945 and, like San Diego, had never ap
peared in a National League Championship Series
since the division formula was instituted in 1969.
The Padres lost the first two games of these
playoffs in Chicago — 13-0 and 4-2 — before win
ning the next two, 7-1 and 7-5.

The Cubs led the decisive game, 3-0, after a two
run homer by Leon Durham in the first and a
leadoff homer by Jody Davis in the second, and
Sutcliffe looked invincible.
Sutcliffe, 16-1, and the winner of his last 14 deci
sions in the regular season, had won Game One of
this series, and he had not lost a game since June
29.
He took a two-hitter into the sixth inning when
the Padres scored two runs, and San Diego scored
four more in the seventh with the help of an error
by Durham at first base, and they were on their way
to their first World Series.
