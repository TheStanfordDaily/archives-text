SAN FRANCISCO — Nicaraguan leader Daniel
Ortega hedged on his prediction of an Oct. 15 inva
sion by the United States and emphasized
Nicaragua's desire for peace in a speech here
Friday.
Ortega, speaking through an interpreter,
remained adamant about holding Nicaragua's
presidential elections on Nov. 4. The U.S. and
other parties opposing Ortega have demanded that
the elections be postponed to allow the participa
tion of a leading opposition candidate.
Ortega, who told the United Nations on Tuesday
that the United States was planning to invade his
country on Oct. 15, told Friday's Commonwealth
Club audience that, although he still believes that
an invasion will take place, the actual attack will
take place in gradual stages.
Ortega hypothesized that the U.S. invasion of

Nicaragua would be a three-stage process, with its
first steps being implemented on the 15th.
Throughout his speech, Ortega emphasized
Nicaragua's desire for peace in Central America.
Specifically, he expressed a desire for better rela
tions with the United States.
"Nicaragua wants peace with the U. 5.," Ortega
said.
He repeatedly spoke of Nicaragua's
"unconditional acceptance" of the regional peace
treaty proposed by the Contadora nations —
Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and Columbia.
He also criticized the United States' rejection of
the treaty, saying, "The only alternative [to the
treaty] is the alternative of war."
Questioned on why Nicaragua would not
postpone its presidential elections to allow the par
ticipation of the Socialist International party — the
most notable opposition party in Nicaragua — Or
tega said that postponement was not necessary.

" I here are more parties participating in the
Nicaraguan elections than in the U.S. elections," he
said. Putting off the Nicaraguan elections would be
like rescheduling the U.S. elections because one
party was not in a favorable position to run, he said.
"We desire all 11 parties to participate," he said.
"It is not our fault that the other parties haven't
wanted to participate."
As Ortega described the first stage of the alleged
invasion plan — masterminded, he said, by the CIA
and the Pentagon — counterrevolutionaries from
bases in Costa Rica and Honduras would "take
over important areas inside Nicaragua."
In phase two, "certain Central American govern
ments" would call for the United States to come to
their aid because "Nicaragua would be supposedly
attacking them and would suposedly represenj a
threat to its neighbors," he said.
Phase three "contemplates the direct interven
tion of U.S. troops in support of those countries,"
Ortega said.
