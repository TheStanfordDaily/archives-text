# Lyons urges mutual trust
## Sends letter to frats, sororities 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Stating that an "environment of
trust" must be cultivated between the
University and the heads of Stan
ford's 26 fraternities and sororities,
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
launched an initiative Friday to
restructure and clarify the Univer
sity's fraternal policies.
In a five-page letter sent Friday to
all fraternity and sorority presidents,
Lyons presents an agenda for discus
sion between the University and the
Greek organizations currently
recognized at Stanford.
The letter, entitled "The Frater
nity/Sorority Task Force Report.
Where do we go from here?" states,
"It is our goal to be in frequent con
tact with you so that we can work to
gether to shape the future of fraternal
organizations at Stanford."
Among the questions on the
agenda for 1984-85 are "What are
the appropriate kinds and levels of
University support and guidance for
fraternities and sororoties?" and
"Should there be a common set of
policies for both residential and non
residential fraternities and
sororities?"
Other topics on the agenda include
preparation of a University policy for
the recognition of both non
residential and residential fraternities
and sororities, and development of an
agenda for the fraternities and
sororities to follow in matters of self
governance.
Self-governance includes develop
ing "rules for rush . . . [and] for
pledging and related issues (e.g.,
hazing) and means to enforce them,"
according to the letter.
Stating that "we are in a period
when the social and residential ecol
ogy of student life at Stanford is in a
state of change," Lyons' letter stresses
the combined efforts of fraternal or
ganizations and the University "will
affect the tone and quality of student
life at Stanford for some time to
come, and the intellectual climate as
well."
Of the six recommendations made
last spring by the Task Force to Study
Fraternities and Sororities at Stan
ford, "the ones that are solvable" will
get attention first, Lyons said.
Lyons' first concern relates most
directly to the fourth recommenda
tion, which said the University
"should acknowledge the value pro
vided students by fraternal organiza
tions, and should afford them Univer
sity support and guidance."
"An environment of trust" must be
established, Lyons said, between
fraternal organizations and the rest of
the University before progress on
other recommendations can be made.
The evaluation process "takes

time" and "must come out of the sys
tem itself," Lyons said. "I don't think
a good outcome is going to come
from yelling and shouting."
The Task Force's second recom
mendation, that the "assignment to
student housing may not be denied
based on the subjective judgments of
current or former residents," cannot
be properly evaluated in the absence
of the task force's report on its
studies, according to Lyons. That
report is due to be released by the
end of the month.
While Lyons said he sees "lots of
solutions to the second recommenda
tion," he acknowledged that develop
ing a consensus "will take a fair
amount of time."
Lyons said there hasn't been a
large-scale effort to restructure the
relationship between fraternal organ
izations and the University since he
came to Stanford in 1972. He said
now is a propitious time "for raising
issues when things are going pretty
well" with the fraternal system.
According to the letter, "Stanford
has no'fraternity problem.' We really
are not heavily burdened by bad be
havior, animal houses and the like."
While Lyons said he is not con
cerned with the image fraternities
present at the University, he said it
must be recognized that people are
"always highly suspicious of a frater
nity system that is seen by the faculty
as anti-intellectual."
An institution such as Stanford will
"tend not to support a frater
nity/sorority system," although it will
"tolerate" one, Lyons said.
But he added that there is "a point
where they (people) will not tolerate
it."
"It's difficult for fraternal organi
zations to realize that not everyone
loves them," Lyons said.
Part of the impetus behind the ef
fort to re-evaluate fraternities and
sororities is the increasing size and in
terest in the Greek system since the
University amended its ban on
sororities in 1977. At that time, 13
fraternities were recognized by the
University, a number which had
remained fairly constant for 10 years,
Lyons said. But today, the total num
ber of recognized fraternities and
sororities has growned to 26.
Lyons said "no one expected such
growth" in Greek life. Instead, the
University anticipated that a few or
ganizations would seek recognition
while "some existing groups might
not make it," Lyons said.
In what Lyons termed "a policy ab
sence," he said there "is no basis to
allocate housing to those (fraternal
groups) who want it."
Of the 70 University student
residences, 12 are now occupied by
fraternities while all seven sororities
remain unhoused.
Lyons said that it is not possible to
currently accommodate all fraternal
organizations with housing, although
he added that not all are seeking
residences.
The University must develop a
working policy for unhoused groups,
as "existing policies for fraternal or
ganizations are residentially based,"
Lyons said. "The alternative is to
pretend they (unhoused groups)
don't exist," he said.
The relationship between housed
and unhoused fraternal groups poses
further problems, Lyons said.
When "an organization goes bad,"
the University can deal with housed
fraternities because they are linked to
the University by a housing contract,
Lyons said. Disciplinary measures
such as revoking housing are possible
in these cases.
Unhoused fraternities are not
bound by such a contract and the
"only action would be to take away
the University's formal recognition,"
Lyons said.
While the letter states that "alumni
consultations will be important,"
Lyons said the problem is basically
one for students to decide.
Alumni are "not a very big factor
in some ways and a big factor in some
ways," Lyons said.

nity/Sorority Task Force Report.
Where do we go from here?" states,
"It is our goal to be in frequent con
tact with you so that we can work to
gether to shape the future of fraternal
organizations at Stanford."
Among the questions on the
agenda for 1984-85 are "What are
the appropriate kinds and levels of
University support and guidance for
fraternities and sororoties?" and
"Should there be a common set of
policies for both residential and non
residential fraternities and
sororities?"
Other topics on the agenda include
preparation of a University policy for
the recognition of both non
residential and residential fraternities
and sororities, and development of an
agenda for the fraternities and
sororities to follow in matters of self
governance.
Self-governance includes develop
ing "rules for rush . . . [and] for
pledging and related issues (e.g.,
hazing) and means to enforce them,"
according to the letter.
Stating that "we are in a period
when the social and residential ecol
ogy of student life at Stanford is in a
state of change," Lyons' letter stresses
the combined efforts of fraternal or
ganizations and the University "will
affect the tone and quality of student
life at Stanford for some time to
come, and the intellectual climate as
well."
Of the six recommendations made
last spring by the Task Force to Study
Fraternities and Sororities at Stan
ford, "the ones that are solvable" will
get attention first, Lyons said.
Lyons' first concern relates most
directly to the fourth recommenda
tion, which said the University
"should acknowledge the value pro
vided students by fraternal organiza
tions, and should afford them Univer
sity support and guidance."
"An environment of trust" must be
established, Lyons said, between
fraternal organizations and the rest of
the University before progress on
other recommendations can be made.
The evaluation process "takes

time" and "must come out of the sys
tem itself," Lyons said. "I don't think
a good outcome is going to come
from yelling and shouting."
The Task Force's second recom
mendation, that the "assignment to
student housing may not be denied
based on the subjective judgments of
current or former residents," cannot
be properly evaluated in the absence
of the task force's report on its
studies, according to Lyons. That
report is due to be released by the
end of the month.
While Lyons said he sees "lots of
solutions to the second recommenda
tion," he acknowledged that develop
ing a consensus "will take a fair
amount of time."
Lyons said there hasn't been a
large-scale effort to restructure the
relationship between fraternal organ
izations and the University since he
came to Stanford in 1972. He said
now is a propitious time "for raising
issues when things are going pretty
well" with the fraternal system.
According to the letter, "Stanford
has no'fraternity problem.' We really
are not heavily burdened by bad be
havior, animal houses and the like."
While Lyons said he is not con
cerned with the image fraternities
present at the University, he said it
must be recognized that people are
"always highly suspicious of a frater
nity system that is seen by the faculty
as anti-intellectual."
An institution such as Stanford will
"tend not to support a frater
nity/sorority system," although it will
"tolerate" one, Lyons said.
But he added that there is "a point
where they (people) will not tolerate
it."
"It's difficult for fraternal organi
zations to realize that not everyone
loves them," Lyons said.
Part of the impetus behind the ef
fort to re-evaluate fraternities and
sororities is the increasing size and in
terest in the Greek system since the
University amended its ban on
sororities in 1977. At that time, 13
fraternities were recognized by the
University, a number which had
remained fairly constant for 10 years,
Lyons said. But today, the total num
ber of recognized fraternities and
sororities has growned to 26.
Lyons said "no one expected such
growth" in Greek life. Instead, the
University anticipated that a few or
ganizations would seek recognition
while "some existing groups might
not make it," Lyons said.
In what Lyons termed "a policy ab
sence," he said there "is no basis to
allocate housing to those (fraternal
groups) who want it."
Of the 70 University student
residences, 12 are now occupied by
fraternities while all seven sororities
remain unhoused.
Lyons said that it is not possible to
currently accommodate all fraternal
organizations with housing, although
he added that not all are seeking
residences.
The University must develop a
working policy for unhoused groups,
as "existing policies for fraternal or
ganizations are residentially based,"
Lyons said. "The alternative is to
pretend they (unhoused groups)
don't exist," he said.
The relationship between housed
and unhoused fraternal groups poses
further problems, Lyons said.
When "an organization goes bad,"
the University can deal with housed
fraternities because they are linked to
the University by a housing contract,
Lyons said. Disciplinary measures
such as revoking housing are possible
in these cases.
Unhoused fraternities are not
bound by such a contract and the
"only action would be to take away
the University's formal recognition,"
Lyons said.
While the letter states that "alumni
consultations will be important,"
Lyons said the problem is basically
one for students to decide.
Alumni are "not a very big factor
in some ways and a big factor in some
ways," Lyons said.
Stating that an "environment of
trust" must be cultivated between the
University and the heads of Stan
ford's 26 fraternities and sororities,
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
launched an initiative Friday to
restructure and clarify the Univer
sity's fraternal policies.
In a five-page letter sent Friday to
all fraternity and sorority presidents,
Lyons presents an agenda for discus
sion between the University and the
Greek organizations currently
recognized at Stanford.

nity/Sorority Task Force Report.
