# Local experts' reaction: Debate won't affect race

### BEN PAGE 
Walter Mondale did not signifi
cantly improve his chances for elec
tion in last night's Presidential
debate, according to campus experts.
While Mondale may have won the
debate, they felt, his victory was not
decisive enough to spark a dramatic
turnaround in the polls.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall typified the general reaction. "I
thought the debate was basically a
draw," he said. "It might have helped
Mondale a tiny bit, but 1 really don t
think it will be decisive in the elec
tion."
Sophomore Steve Dauber, head of
the College Republicans, felt that the
lack of a clear winner meant a strate
gic victory for President Reagan.
"Mondale had an awful lot at stake in
this debate, but there were no light
ning bolts. He really needed something
dramatic, but it wasn't a clear-cut
thing, so 1 think Mondale lost big.

Marshall said Reagan's demeanor
helped him. "He gave the impression
of being a genial, honest, religious,
affable man." Economics Prof. Mi
chael Boskin also felt Reagan came
across as more "Presidential."
But others preferred Mondale's
style. "My sense is that President
Reagan seemed somewhat halting,
confused and groping," said Political
Science Prof. John Manley. "In
several key areas he came through as
unprepared and unalert."
Manley felt that Mondale
"definitely advanced his cause," but
added that in the future he needed to
appeal more directly to his low
income constituency by concentrating
more on issues of economic fairness
and less on the deficit. He also felt
that Mondale was most effective
when he attacked Reagan with some
emotion, but that he failed to press
his advantage the few times he did.
Eric Diesel, head of Students for

Mondale, also criticized Reagan's
style. "Reagan seemed confused and
tired; he just couldn't stand up to the
pressure. He started losing concen
tration an hour and 10 minutes into
the debate. I think people could see
he just doesn't have what it takes.
The president needs to be able to stay
awake for more than an hour at a
time."
Marshall agreed with Manley that
Mondale had difficulty scoring points
on the deficit issue. He said Mondale
"comes across as more courageous'
because of his stand on raising taxes
to reduce the deficit, "but I don't
know if it will win him many votes.
His problem is that his most telling
argument, the deficit, is intangible.
Reagan can point to tangible changes
in the economy; people can see that
the inflation rate is down every time
they go to a grocery store."

College Republicans convened at Encina Station to watch last night's televised debate. More than 100 stu
dents munched popcorn, chewed jellybeans, booed Walter Mondale and cheered President Reagan
throughout the event.
Boskin questioned the significance
of the whole deficit issue. "It's true
that we'd be better off if the deficit
were lower, but right now we have a
very robust economy," he said.
"Mondale seemed to indicate that a
reduced deficit will cure all our eco
nomic ills, and that's just nonsense."
He added that both candidates
were excessively optimistic in their
forecasts, Mondale in saying that he
can reduce the deficit while restoring
social programs cut by Reagan, and
Reagan in predicting that economic
growth will wipe out the deficit with
no new taxes.
All those interviewed agreed there
were no major gaffes in the debate.
Marshall, however, said that "Reagan
was simply wrong on a whole series of
statements. He said he was decreas
ing the size of government, which is
just not true; government spending as
a percentage of GNP has risen in the
last four years. He was also wrong in
attacking Congressional Budget Of
fice estimates of future deficits. Their

estimates, though of course they're
not always correct, have consistently
been the most accurate."
Marshall also said Mondale was
unfair in accusing Reagan of trying to
cut social security. But Marshall
pointed out that Reagan had only
said in the debate that he would never
cut benefit checks "for those now re
ceiving them." This is "a very limited
statement" since it doesn't include
any possible cuts for future retirees,
Marshall said.
Diesel said Reagan might regret
saying that the right to abortion
should be denied to rape vitims, but
Marshall pointed out that it is
impossible to take a non
controversial position on the issue of
abortion.
