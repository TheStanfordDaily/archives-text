Demonstration goes peacefully
MANILA, Philippines — An anti-government demonstration that
many feared might end in violence dispersed peacefully in a drizzle yes
terday after President Ferdinand Marcos backed down on a threat to
block the rally organized by moderate business leaders and opposition
politicians.
More than 20,000 demonstrators, radicals as well as moderates,
joined forces for the first time in months as they marched half-a-mile
along a wide boulevard to a rally at a stone monument hung with lights
in the shape of a Catholic rosary. The monument was the site late last
month of a clash between left-wing students and police that left one
demonstrator dead and scores injured.
Few police or soldiers were in sight yesterday.
The march marked a significant, if only temporary, alliance between
two factions of the growing anti-Marcos movement that have bickered
over tactics and other issues.
Since a split early this year, the ranks of the demonstrators have been
increasingly taken over by radical labor leaders and students, while
moderates appeared to be losing interest in mounting a campaign in the
streets against Marcos.
But yesterday, some important business leaders vowed to reverse that
trend.
"I have stopped trying to convince myself that I have more important
things to do," Jaime Ongpin, the president of a large mining concern and
a frequent critic of Marcos, told the marchers. "There is nothing more
important than to stand with you today and be counted."
Corazon Aquino, widow of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr.
whose murder last year touched off the ongoing wave of anti
government protest, told the rally that the gathering shows Filipinos are
no longer afraid of Marcos.
Chad leader discusses withdrawal
PARIS — Chad President Hissene Habre flew back to N'Djamena
from Paris yesterday after discussing details of the monitoring of the
French-Libyan troop withdrawal process from Chad.
Habre said he was satisfied with the guarantees for his government
and the withdrawal process, but disclosed no details of the arrangement.
It was still unclear what would happen to about 1,000 soldiers from
Zaire who are deployed in Chad, although the issue was discussed at an
African summit in Paris on Friday involving French President Francois
Mitterrand, Habre and the presidents of Gabon, Zaire and the Ivory
Coast.
During his three-day visit, Habre met twice with Mitterrand, three
times with Defense Minister Charles Hernu and with Foreign Minister
Claude Cheysson and Development Aid Minister Christian Nucci.
Meanwhile, it was announced that the French army chief of staff,
Jeannou Lacaze, would leave for N'Djamena during the next few days.
It is expected that he will play an important part in the monitoring of the
troop withdrawal.
Before his departure Habre told the French radio that he had doubts
about the Libyan's honesty concerning the troop withdrawal.
Habre said it was likely Libya would continue to give support to the
Islamic Legion, which is made up of Libyan and African troops, and that
this force would remain in Chad as part of the opposition led by former
Chad President Goukouni Oueddei.
Spy-proof phones soon available
WASHINGTON — Spy-proof telephones — the kind used by high
government officials for secret conversations— may soon be available to
private industry at a cost of only a few thousand dollars each because of
research commissioned by the National Security Agency, a spokesman
said yesterday.
Today, telephones equipped with secure coding equipment cost about
$31,000 each, a price that has limited the number the government buys
and puts them beyond the reach of most businesses.
But in a spinoff of the NSA's efforts to protect U.S. voice communica- \
tions against Soviet eavesdropping, the agency has found that lower-cost
systems are feasible and is encouraging U.S. companies to develop them,
J.C. Sharp, the agency's deputy chief of information policy, said.
"We estimate that they can be produced at a cost of only a couple of
thousand dollars," Sharp said. "The potential demand in the private
market — in private industry, perhaps in some academic communities —
is still being studied."
The development of the "low-cost, user-friendly secure telephone in
strument," as it is officially termed, will also allow far more government
conversations to be conducted over spy-proof channels, he said.
The NSA has estimated that the federal government and defense
related industries alone will want 500,000 of the telephones — before
they are even made available to other industries.
The NSA, the secretive intelligence agency responsible for intercept
ing foreign communications and protecting U.S. government message
channels, plans to contract later this year for initial production of the
phones, which could begin as early as 1986.
Sharp said the agency commissioned an initial feasibility study early
this year because of its belief that Soviet electronic eavesdropping is on
the rise, because such spying is made easier by the increased volume of
voice communications transmitted through the air rather than through
wires and because new technology made it more feasible to encode and
decode conversations at a reasonable cost.
Public housing cuts delayed
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration has agreed to delay a
plan that coukl remove thousands of vacant apartments from the na
tion's public-housing stock, but officials say they are determined to
pursue the idea in a second Reagan term.
The Housing and Urban Development Department has published a
proposed regulation that would cut off operating subsidies for many of
the 40,000 vacant public-housing units unless federal aid is committed to
restore them.
Since HUD also controls the federal modernization money, critics say
the department could use the new authority to shrink the scope of public
housing.
"It is a pernicious attack (that) could basically drive these units to
demolition, which a lot of people think is the underlying strategy," Gor
don Cavanaugh, an official with the Council of Large Public Housing
Authorities, said.
But Warren Lindquist, HUD's assistant secretary for public housing,
said the goal was to restore as many units as possible to livable condition
while ending federal aid for those with no hope of rehabilitation.
"I know they're suspicious and they don't believe it, and there's not a
hell of a lot I can do about it," Lindquist said of his critics. "But I want to
make this damn thing work."
The proposal is one of a host of politically sensitive issues — from
combatting acid rain to revamping disability benefits — that the admin
istration has put off until after the election.
Lindquist said the regulation had been delayed until early next year
because of strong criticism from Congress and local housing officials.
"It was not pulled because of the election year," he said. "It was
pulled because it would not make any sense to ram it through. . . . The
feelings against this were very strong."
Former prisoners billed for time
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — Liber Seregni, a former presidential
candidate who was a political prisoner for nine years, got a bill for
$2,000. Milton Ibarra paid $4,000 for his three years in prison. Victor
Licardo, a former general, appealed his bill and paid only $1,000.
The Uruguayan armed forces are billing newly released political
prisoners for room and board during the time they spent behind bars.
For many, imprisonment included torture.
About 200 Uruguayans freed in recent months by a lame-duck mili
tary regime are being charged for their cell (double occupancy), their
food and their clothing. Over the years, depending on inflation, the
value of the Uruguayan peso and the institution in question, the rate has
ranged from 60 cents to $2.50 a day, former prisoners and their lawyers
say.
Today's weather
It will be sunny and mild today with possible morning cloudiness. The
high temperature will be in the high 70s to low 80s.
