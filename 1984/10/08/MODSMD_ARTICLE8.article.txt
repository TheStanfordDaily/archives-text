# Reagan and Mondale clash

### 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — President Reagan and
Democratic challenger Walter Mondale confronted
each other last night in their first campaign debate,
clashing over the issue of the ballooning federal
budget deficit and the presidents economic
recovery plan.
In a 90-minute face-to-face televised encounter,
Reagan said he had no secret plan to balance the
budget in a second term but would rely mainly on
increased revenues from a growing economy and
on bringing down federal spending.
"I have a plan, not a secret plan," he said in
response to the opening question in the debate,
which focused on domestic issues. '"As a matter of
fact, it is the economic recovery program we pre
sented when I took office in 1981."
But Mondale, who has proposed a deficit reduc
tion plan that includes raising taxes, called the defi
cit "perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our
times" and denied that the president's plan would
be enough to reduce the red-ink spending.
"I respect the president. I respect the presidency
. . . but the fact is that every estimate by the admin
istration about the size of the deficit has been off by
billions and billions of dollars," he said.
Mondale drew the first applause of the evening
when he pledged not to reduce Social Security

benefits if elected. But Reagan, in his rebuttal,
firmly declared he would "never stand" for reduc
tions in those benefits. Mondale, however, coun
tered that the president made a similar pledge in
the 1980 campaign — but then proposed cuts in the
government pension program once he was in the
White House.
In format, last night's confrontation was actually
more of a dual press conference than a classic
debate. Instead of questioning and challenging
each other directly, the two opponents fielded
questions from a panel of journalists. Television
commentator Barbara Walters served as moderator
and James Weighart of Scripps- Howard
Newspapers, Fred Barnes of the Baltimore Sun and
Diane Sawyer of CBS asked the questions.
Before the debate, Mondale, his campaign in
desperate need of a lift, expressed confidence that
he would be able to persuade the American people
that he reflects their values better than Reagan.
"If I make my case," he said, "then it's up to the
American people to decide what they want. It's
their decision, not mine, and once I've done my
best, I'll be satisfied."
Mondale arrived in Louisville in a light rain
about six hours before the debate began and imme
diately drove to the Kentucky Center for the Per

forming Arts to test the microphones and inspect
lighting on the stage. ..... , ,
Reagan also arrived in Louisville in the after
noon after a rousing sendoff from the White
House staff, which gathered on the south lawn. He
too made a brief stop at the Center to inspect the
facilities for the debate, including the microphone
and podium, which was especially equipped with an
amplifier for Reagan, who wears a hearing aid.
Before leaving Washington, the president said he
was a bit nervous about the debate: "It's like
waiting for the kickoff at the beginning of the
game." But he added that he was "as ready as I'll
ever be" for the confrontation.
White House aides and Republican supporters
applauded and chanted "Four More Years" as
Reagan and his wife, Nancy, boarded the helicop
ter that took them to Air Force One at Andrews
Air Force Base for the flight to Louisville.
The president had spent the weekend at Camp
David where a final strategy session was held Sat
urday. On orders from White House Chief of Staff
James Baker 111, aides generally have refused to
discuss details of the more than 20 hours of debate
strategy sessions Reagan has held.
