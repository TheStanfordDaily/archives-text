# Panel selection creates debate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Some
compared it to a college fraternity
rush, when a blackball meant rejec
tion, often for the oddest reasons.
Others said it was like the old
enemies list days of the Nixon admin
istration when many journalists were
embarrassed to be counted among
the unpopular president's friends.
Still others felt it was simply
"outrageous" for the League of Wo
men Voters to allow aides to Presi
dent Reagan and Walter Mondale to
reject about 100 reporters for last
night's presidential debate panel
before finding journalists acceptable
to both sides.
"When I found out they were pick
ing and choosing — blackballing
some and annointing others after
they'd passed some kind of litmus
test, I decided we shouldn't partici
pate," said Bill Kovach, New York
Times Washington editor.
"We take the position that we
don't allow the government to tell us
who we can assign to the story or who
can ask a question at a press confer
ence," he said. "Why should they
pick the people for the debate?*

Thus, Times reporter Gerald Boyd,
a black reporter that Mondale had al
legedly asked to be on the panel for
"racial balance," backed out of the
panel. Richmond Times-Dispatch
columnist Charles McDowell said he
also refused the league's offer, but his
reason was that he had written a
number of columns saying that jour
nalists should not be a part of the
debate structure.
"Of course, maybe if I hadn't writ
ten so pontifically about it, I might
have done it. But I told them that I
had taken such high ground, clearly 1
had a hypocrisy problem," McDowell
said.
After a week of negotiations and a
great deal of confusion with some
journalists invited and then uninvited
to appear with moderator Barbara
Walters, League of Women Voters
President Dorothy Ridings charged
Saturday that the two presidential
candidates had "abused" the process
by rejecting some of the nation's most
prestigious reporters.
Refusing to release any of the
names of those who were not chosen,
Ridings said that with almost no ex
planation, the two candidates

rejected close to 100 names every
one of them an honorable, forthright,
decent journalist."
Ridings said the same system was
used in 1976 and no journalists were
vetoed by the candidates. One jour
nalist was dropped from the debates
in 1980. She said that last Monday,
the league submitted 12 names to
both camps. When the lists came
back, only one name, reportedly
James Wieghart of Scripps-Howard,
had been approved by both sides.
Wieghart was on the panel last night.
"As this went on last week, we
started getting more and more rejec
tions and wondering what was going
on. We started saying 'Hey, guys, this
is really ridiculous. What is up?'
The stir over the panels left a num
ber of journalists who weren't chosen
more relieved than disappointed.
Jack Nelson, Washington Bureau
chief of the Los Angeles Times,
reportedly one of those nixed by the
White House, said that although he
admired those chosen, "it's an insult
to the journalists to be saying 'no, we
won't accept so and so because they
won't be even-handed.' "

For those three who were still on
the list for this debate and those cho
sen for future ones, it remained an
honor, if a less straightforward one.
"I must be real fair or real insipid,"
joked Fred Barnes of the Baltimore
Sun, one of the panelists last night
along with Wieghart and Diane
Sawyer of CBS.
Barnes agreed with a number of
other journalists that the debates
would be better if there were no jour
nalists slowing down the give and
take between the candidates.
"I'm flattered to be on the panel,
but I wish there weren't one," Barnes
added.
Although most news organizations
allow or even encourage their
reporters to be part of such an his
toric event, Sunday night's debate has
changed the rules, not only for The
New York Times but also for CBS,
where executives decided they would
no longer participate after Sawyer
completed her questioning for this
one. The Washington Post policy has
been to bar reporters covering the
campaign from appearing on political
debates.
