## Modern thought and literature Ph.D. candidate to climb Everest Graduate student Lankford is off to higher planes 
### DAN DELUCE 
Few universities would allow a
graduate student to pick up and leave
for two years to go climb Mt. Everest.
But that is exactly what Stanford
has allowed Scott Lankford, a doc
toral candidate in modern thought
and literature, to do. Lankford
stopped out last winter quarter to
begin training and raising money as a
member of the 1985 American
Mount Everest West Ridge Expedition.
Mt. Everest was first climbed suc
cessfully in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hil
lary and Sherpa Tenzig Norgay. It
stands at the border between Nepal
and Tibet at an altitude of 29,028 feet
— the highest summit in the world.

The altitude is approximately equal
to that of an airplane, "So imagine
what it's like to roll down the window
and breath at 29,028 feet," Lankford
said. Out of the nine expeditions that
have attempted the West Ridge direct
route, only two teams, from Yugos
lavia and Bulgaria, have reached the
summit.
The 1983 Men and Women's
American Expedition failed to reach
the top due to 100 mph winds. The
1983 American East Face Expedition
successfully reached the summit by an
entirely new route, which Lankford
called "the hardest by far."
The logistics involved are over
whelming. It is 150 miles with three
to four tons in supplies and equip
ment to the first base camp. The

packing is aided by an animal similar
to a cow called a "yak", and native
sherpas, who make a living solely by
packing for expeditionary groups.
The base camp itself is at 17,800 feet,
and according to Lankford, just get
ting there "is a trial in itself."
In the climbing seasons of fall and
spring, Mt. Everest is actually warmer
than most high altitude climbs.
"People exaggerate how cold it is,"
Lankford said. The ordeal is not.so
much how low the temperature gets,
but its frustrating variations. In the
same day, "you could be climbing in
shirtsleeves or be bundled up."
According to Lankford, the route
requires a large amount of technical

climbing, particularly at the lower
and upper areas. The most difficult
climbing is at the top, at the highest
altitude. Each member is also climb
ing with a large backpack.
Half the work is what Lankford
calls "hauling." A mountaineer must
often climb the same pitch five or six
times as part of the human conveyor
belt that is formed to move the
supplies and equipment.
"The biggest danger is not falling
off the mountain, but having the
mountain fall on you," he said. The
reason for this is that the rock of Mt.
Everest is marine limestone which is
formed from ancient seabed and of
ten crumbles. Lankford said that hel
mets are often necessary.
Farther up the route, the danger in

climbing snow is an avalanche.
The '83 East Face Expedition used
a rocket to launch a cable into place,
and carried oxygen bottles. The
graduate student said that there is
currently a controversy in moun
taineering over how much equipment
and aid to use, and whether such
things as oxygen bottles change the
nature of the sport. Nevertheless, the
difficult routes on Everest have never
been done without oxygen.
Lankford is one of 14 mem
bers who form an eclectic group, in
cluding a lawyer, a doctor, an en
gineer, an airline pilot, one of
America's top climbers — Jim Brid
well (known in Yosemite as "the
Bird") and Heidi Benson, a recent
Stanford graduate.
Each member of the expedition has
to raise $10,000. Lankford has been
working at Stanford Sierra Camp as a
ski instructor and as its first rock
climbing instructor. He said that the
experience has been "gratifying."
As a former freshman English
teacher, he claims he could have got
ten through to students better outside
in the mountains "on the end of a
rope .. . instead of sitting across a
table."
Lankford was born into a moun
taineering family that ran a wilder
ness institute. He began climbing at
age ten, in an environment where
climbing was considered a normal ac
tivity. He took a liking to it.
He has been a climbing and wilder
ness guide in Africa, Alaska, Mexico,
Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and
California. His training has consisted
of aerobic exercise at the Sierra
Camp, where he runs up mountain
sides and does weight training for the
upper body.
"The best thing," he said, "is to
climb, climb, climb."
Originally, the expedition num
bered twenty people, but several have
dropped out along the way due to the
enormous commitment of time and
money.
Has Lankford ever come close to
giving the idea up? "Never," he said.
He does not deny though, that he
does have some fears going into the
climb. "Yes," he said. "I'm afraid.
You'd be stupid not to be afraid.
Socrates said 'Know what to fear, and
what not to fear.' Things can go
wrong."
On the '83 East Face Expedition
the group coincidentally met up with
three Japanese climbers and sherpas.
Later the Americans saw two men of
that group fall, right past them, to
their death. No one on the Japanese
expedition was ever seen again. And

yet the Americans returned with no
serious injury. Lankford said the
Japanese climbers are known for a
daring and reckless style.
The mountaineer claims rock
climbing doesn't deserve a daredevil
reputation like hang gliding. "In
climbing you spend half your time
setting up a safety system." And re
ferring to the dreaded graduate stu
dent "orals", he said, "It can't be
scarier than that."
When Lankford first stopped out,
he said he was worried at first that he
might never come back. But thinking
back on all that he has read in his
studies, he said "the best is still with
me."
He said that he can relate his climb

to his studies, and is only "half
joking" when he calls it field re
search. "It's annoying — because we
study literature in a vacuum." He
describes much of graduate school as
having to lock yourself in a library.
"There's always been a split in my
life — mountaineering versus studies.
I believe if s a false 0ne.... What's the
difference between literature that
moves me and a summit that moves
me? There is an amazing number of
Ph.Ds in climbing. It's an intellectual
sport. .. with a lot<o think about."
His student friends have been ex
tremely supportive of his climb.
Lankford said that his climbing has
shown his peers that reading does not
have to separate a person from the
real world. "Reading doesn't have to

dismantle you."
The faculty has treated his hope of
relating the climb to the literary
"sublime" with "interested skep
ticism," Lankford said.
He has raised $9,000 out of the
$10,000 he needs, and is selling Mt.
Everest expedition T-shirts to raise
more money.
Will they reach the top? "Fifty
percent of the time people make it to
the summit," he said, and even then
only a few of the members will actu
ally go to the top depending on who
will be feeling the healthiest and
where a climber is positioned.
But talking to Lankford, you get
the feeling they will reach that sum
mit.
