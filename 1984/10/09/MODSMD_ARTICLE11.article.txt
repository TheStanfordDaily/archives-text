In a campaign that is increasingly and regret
tably dependent upon image rather than issues,
Walter Mondale was far behind President
Reagan prior to the first presidential debate.
But on Sunday night, Mondale looked better
— more charismatic, personable and funny —
than ever before. He appeared to have "let go."
He out-Reaganed Reagan with a timely Will
Rogers quote. Mondale even managed to suc
cessfully turn Reagan's famous "there you go
again" line to his own advantage.
Reagan appeared quite disorganized, particu
larly in his opening and closing statements. He
often had trouble finding the right word, stopping
in mid-sentence to collect his thoughts.
Mondale seemed to have the facts to back his
positions. While Reagan made several statements
backed with "facts," Mondale convincingly
pointed out that the "facts" just weren't so.
Reagan claimed he had never tried to cut So
cial Security; Mondale told the American people
that this just wasn't true, and Reagan attempted
to qualify his erroneous statement. Reagan-Bush
campaign officials have denied that the enormous
deficit is a campaign issue, saying that it is incom
prehensible to most voters; Mondale has made it
an issue, clearly putting Reagan on the defensive.

Reagan had little time to celebrate the current
economic recovery, instead addressing the charge
that he has a secret plan to raise taxes.
Mondale's performance at this last debate
alone will not influence the outcome of the elec
tion. If Mondale, trailing desperately in the polls,
is to win the election or even narrow the gap sig
nificantly, he must continue to project the image
he succeeded in presenting Sunday night. He
must keep the pressure on and score a decisive
blow in the next debate.
Until Sunday, Reagan seemed to be coasting to
a landslide re-election; if he plans to keep his
lead, he must improve upon the befuddled image
he presented.
At last the public was given a chance to see
both candidates combine personality and issues.
However, we are disappointed that the two
contending camps brought the fight into the one
forum where it did not belong: the selection of
panelists. That the two candidates could only
agree on three panelists from a list of 100 top na
tional journalists is very disappointing. In future
debates we hope the candidates will keep politics
where they belong — in the campaign, not in
panel selections.
