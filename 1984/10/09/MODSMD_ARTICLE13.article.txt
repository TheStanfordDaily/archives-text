## Developing B-1 will decrease risk of nuclear war 
### 
Does America need a new long-range stra
tegic bomber? Congressional opponents of
the project have until now been successful in
maintaining a political barrier far more effec
tive at foiling the B-1 than any air defense
system. Originally designed in the late 19605,
•the beleagured B-1 has taken a tortuous path
ihrough four presidencies on its way to the
production line. As such, the September
!"debut" of the B-lb was at best a bittersweet
\i£tory for the Reagan administration.
Is it a case of better late than never? The
construction of 100 B-lbs will help revitalize
our aging arsenal of B-525. The most recent
xevisions of the B-52 — the B-52G and 8"52H
"52H — rolled off the assembly line over two
jde.cades ago in 1962. These anachronistic
}>easts lumber along at a comfortable 600
mph and present a large radar profile, allow
ing the Soviets the 10-hour intercontinental
flight time to track and destroy them.
► What began as ade facto policy of restraint
iasa result of congressional opposition became
an explicit cancellation of the program under
former President Carter in 1977. Not surpris
ingly, these events did not elicit correspond
ing delay or restraint on the Soviet side. In the
19705, the Kremlin tested and deployed an
advanced supersonic bomber called Backfire,
is similar to the B-1. Yet another new

long-range bomber known as "Blackjack" is
currently in the development stage.
How would things be different had a virus
of conservativism afflicted Congress in the
early 19705, propelling the B-1 project ex
peditiously through the halls of bureaucracy?
For one thing, on-schedule deployment would
have compelled the Soviets to make expen-

sive improvements in their air defense system.
This would have either squeezed the Soviet
economy harder, or funds would have been
diverted from deployment of large, destabiliz
ing, first-strike missiles: the SS-17, -18, and
-19. Moreover, the fact that negotiating ex
perience with the Soviets suggests that they
are more flexible when they are economically

and politically hard-pressed leads one to spec
ulate that on-schedule deployment of the B-l
may have furthered arms control attempts in
the mid-19705.
Aside from such speculation, what do cur
rent critics of the B-i have to say? One com
mon, overtly plausible objection to the proj
ect is that a Soviet first strike would destroy
most bombers on the ground. However, a
closer examination reveals that no first strike
scenario includes obliteration of both
bombers and land-based missiles (ICBMs).
Though a submarine-initiated first strike
could undoubtedly devastate the American
bomber force, submarine-laun'ched ballistic
missiles (SLBMs) are not yet sufficiently ac
curate to destroy hardened missile silos.
Hence, the president could retaliate with the
reliable Minuteman force as soon as the first
SLBM explosion provided confirmation of
nuclear attack.
What about a coordinated first strike
employing both SLBMs and ICBMs? The
highly accurate multiple warheads on the So
viet ICBMs are certainly capable of destroy
ing more than 90 percent of our land-based
missiles, assuming we do not launch on warn
ing. However, the ICBMs begin their journey
much farther away than the SLBMs, which

can be launched near the American coastline.
The thirty minutes between radar detection of
a probable ICBM launch and the first explo
sion over the United States would be ample
time to scramble long-range bombers, getting
them safely on their way to targets within the
USSR.
Presumably, the Soviets would prefer to

chance of penetrating

to nuclear war.

destroy the deadly Minuteman force than the
bombers. A bomber force with a chance of
penetrating the Soviet defense acts as a
credible deterrent to nuclear war.
Other advantages and characteristics
unique to the airborne leg of our strategic
triad underscore the need to continue with the
B-l and Stealth programs. Unlike SLBMs

and ICBMs, bombers can be recalled.
The comparatively long flight time required
to reach target range not only demands an ef
fort to make bombers faster and less easily
detected. It also makes bombers unsuitable
for use in a first-strike and more suitable for
use as a cautious response to nuclear provoca
tion. It permits the men with their fingers on
the proverbial button to ponder the alterna
tives in a crisis and to communicate with each
other without the time pressures inherent
with use-it-or-lose-it weapons.
Replacing 100 of the 316 aging B-52s with
B-lbs, replacing the remaining B-52s with
Stealth bombers within the next decade, and
equipping them with air-launched cruise
missiles that use terrain contour-mapping
radar to zero in on their targets can resurrect
our strategic bombing capability. It is not a
panacea for our national defense problems,
nor is it a substitute for arms control. But it
can significantly enhance the disadvantage in
starting a nuclear war; it can allow the presi
dent more flexibility in responding to nuclear
provocations; and it can have a stabilizing in
fluence in times of a crisis.

fort to make bombers faster and less easily
detected. It also makes bombers unsuitable
for use in a first-strike and more suitable for
use as a cautious response to nuclear provoca

with use-it-or-lose-it weapons.
Replacing 100 of the 316 aging B-52s with
B-lbs, replacing the remaining B-52s with
Stealth bombers within the next decade, and
equipping them with air-launched cruise
missiles that use terrain contour-mapping
radar to zero in on their targets can resurrect
our strategic bombing capability. It is not a
panacea for our national defense problems,

can significantly enhance the disadvantage in
starting a nuclear war; it can allow the presi

provocations; and it can have a stabilizing in

Does America need a new long-range stra
tegic bomber? Congressional opponents of
the project have until now been successful in
maintaining a political barrier far more effec
tive at foiling the B-1 than any air defense
system. Originally designed in the late 19605,
•the beleagured B-1 has taken a tortuous path
ihrough four presidencies on its way to the
production line. As such, the September
!"debut" of the B-lb was at best a bittersweet
\i£tory for the Reagan administration.
Is it a case of better late than never? The
construction of 100 B-lbs will help revitalize
our aging arsenal of B-525. The most recent
xevisions of the B-52 — the B-52G and 8"52H
"52H — rolled off the assembly line over two
jde.cades ago in 1962. These anachronistic
}>easts lumber along at a comfortable 600
mph and present a large radar profile, allow
ing the Soviets the 10-hour intercontinental
flight time to track and destroy them.
► What began as ade facto policy of restraint
iasa result of congressional opposition became
an explicit cancellation of the program under
former President Carter in 1977. Not surpris
ingly, these events did not elicit correspond
ing delay or restraint on the Soviet side. In the
19705, the Kremlin tested and deployed an
advanced supersonic bomber called Backfire,
is similar to the B-1. Yet another new

long-range bomber known as "Blackjack" is
currently in the development stage.
How would things be different had a virus
of conservativism afflicted Congress in the
early 19705, propelling the B-1 project ex
peditiously through the halls of bureaucracy?

sive improvements in their air defense system.
This would have either squeezed the Soviet
economy harder, or funds would have been
diverted from deployment of large, destabiliz
ing, first-strike missiles: the SS-17, -18, and
-19. Moreover, the fact that negotiating ex
perience with the Soviets suggests that they
are more flexible when they are economically

and politically hard-pressed leads one to spec
ulate that on-schedule deployment of the B-l
may have furthered arms control attempts in
the mid-19705.
Aside from such speculation, what do cur
rent critics of the B-i have to say? One com
mon, overtly plausible objection to the proj
ect is that a Soviet first strike would destroy
most bombers on the ground. However, a
closer examination reveals that no first strike
scenario includes obliteration of both
bombers and land-based missiles (ICBMs).
Though a submarine-initiated first strike
could undoubtedly devastate the American
bomber force, submarine-laun'ched ballistic
missiles (SLBMs) are not yet sufficiently ac
curate to destroy hardened missile silos.
Hence, the president could retaliate with the
reliable Minuteman force as soon as the first
SLBM explosion provided confirmation of
nuclear attack.
What about a coordinated first strike
employing both SLBMs and ICBMs? The
highly accurate multiple warheads on the So
viet ICBMs are certainly capable of destroy
ing more than 90 percent of our land-based
missiles, assuming we do not launch on warn
ing. However, the ICBMs begin their journey
much farther away than the SLBMs, which

can be launched near the American coastline.
The thirty minutes between radar detection of
a probable ICBM launch and the first explo
sion over the United States would be ample
time to scramble long-range bombers, getting
them safely on their way to targets within the
USSR.
Presumably, the Soviets would prefer to

destroy the deadly Minuteman force than the
bombers. A bomber force with a chance of
penetrating the Soviet defense acts as a
credible deterrent to nuclear war.
Other advantages and characteristics
unique to the airborne leg of our strategic
triad underscore the need to continue with the
B-l and Stealth programs. Unlike SLBMs

and ICBMs, bombers can be recalled.
