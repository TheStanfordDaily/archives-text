Freedom to learn
Ralph Banks makes three er
roneous assertions in his article on
the Stanford grading policy (The
Daily, Oct. 4). They are as follows:
1) grades at Stanford are an inac
curate reflection of a student's per
formance and, moreover, are
deceptive; 2) the grading policy does
not prepare Stanford students for the
"real world"; and 3) students have
no incentive, or lose incentive, as a
result of the grading policy to pursue
difficult courses.
First of all, grades are inherently
arbitrary. Most Stanford students
who receive B's, Cs and D's would
stand an excellent chance of getting
A's at San Jose State. It is also no
secret that grades at Stanford tend to
be inflated. Every graduate school
knows this, most employers are
aware of this, and if any student does
not know this before he arrives he is
certainly made aware of i i\ the end
of the first quarter.
Second, the purpose of a anford
education is to learn; it is noi, as
Banks proposes, to prepare students
for life after college (although Stan
ford does do a good job of that, too).
The grading policy was instituted,
and remains intact, to encourage
students to take a wide range of
courses without having to worry
primarily about the grade they will
receive.
Also, students are admitted to
Stanford, in large measure, due to
their proven ability to not only chal
lenge themselves with difficult
courses but also to persevere through
the difficulties these courses present.
I am sorry if Banks feels that he
lacks this ability but it is my experi
ence that most Stanford students do
not lack the necessary fortitude to
complete a challenging course. In
fa£t, I know many people who have
an additional course, because
of the confidence fostered by the
drop policy, and have found the class
and experience to be highly reward
ing. An experience they would have
been deprived of in many other
colleges.
Stanford has gained its
reputation of excellence not by fol
lowing the status quo but rather by
breaking new ground in many differ
ent areas. One of these areas is in its
attitude toward its students. We are
not treated like little kids who have
to be prodded along by someone else
to do something. On the contrary,
we are given an immense amount of
freedom to pursue our own interests.

For some this comes as a shock but
once one realizes what an opportu
nity this represents one can take
advantage of Stanford excellence.

Modern times
I was quite pleased to read Ralph
Banks' essay on the value of a com
prehensive grading system (The
Daily, Oct. 4); however, I believe he
has missed an important point.
He stated that "Stanford chal
lenges students" and"it is difficult to
do exceptionally well." But it is my
belief that the difficulty most Stan
ford students have in doing
"exceptionally well" is not due to
"Stanford challenging students" or
the fact that there are lots of smart
people here. After all, many of us
went to academically rigorous
secondary schools with lots of smart
people (yes, they do exist), and
managed to do "exceptionally well"
there.
Rather, I believe that once you
enter Stanford or any sizable institu
tion, you become yet another lost
cog in a giant factory. You are not
well-known by your instructors. The
quality and effect of your intellectual
accomplishments are smothered by
the size of classes and the overall
institution. You become production
meat in a giant meat factory that
tenderizes and pulverizes you,
sprinkles you with flavor enhancer,
stamps you triple-A quality, and
then sends you into the world of
the carnivore.
Really.

Hooked on the band
Our Student Congress would like
to express its thanks to the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band for its remarkable performance
at the halftime of our opening home
football game. It is no easy task to
break up the monotony of a high
school football game, but the Band,
with its organized chaos, certainly
succeeded. We will never forget the
privilege of the performance.
Also unforgettable was the Band's
performance at the University of
Oklahoma game. It was, perhaps
more daring than it might have im
agined beforehand. We have heard
that the Band members risked them
selves to the verbal abuse of two

fanatical sideliner OU alumni who,
throughout the performance, loudly
questioned the masculinity of the
tutu-clad drum major. Homop
hobics, we would assume. We
apologize for these gentlemen with
the sincere wish that the Leland
Stanford University Marching Band
pay us a visit again ... because we're
hooked. Besides, what does Sports
Illustrated know anyway?

Learn the hard way
Freshwomen of Stanford unite!
You have a new and glorious
manifesto as outlined by Gordon
Schmierer (The Daily, Oct. 2.).
Thanks to Schmierer, you no longer
have to feel constrained by academic
pressures. You have a new mission in
life: not to develop your brains, but
your breasts. Don't pull all-nighters
over those silly papers: Heavens, you
might get bags under your "big,
eager eyes"! Intelligence won't get
you anywhere in this world; good
looks are what count. Just look at
President Reagan.
Take it from two senior women
who've learned the hard way. We fell
in with the wrong crowd early on —
we should have suspected these were
unusual women when we saw their
unshaven legs. Oh, at first it was only
one or two feminist studies classes,
but it was all downhill from there.
We started hanging out at the Wo
men's Center. Soon, we were dis
tributing flyers and attending rallies
and workshops and even taking
(gasp) women's self-defense classes.
And, what has it gotten us? Noth
ing .. . but increased senses of self
confidence and self-worth, a better
understanding of ourselves and our
relationships to society, and a feeling
that we've helped to better the posi
tion of women in a man's world. But,
now Schmierer has set us straight.
He reminds us that after all, we are
all objects in nature. Our looks are
all that we have to worry about.
Remember that freshwomen.
Don't come home crying because
some guy pinched your ass on the
bus and told you not to be uptight
when you got angry. Don't get upset
when you look at a magazine rack
and see pictures of naked women
being bound and gagged and
whipped — like you, they're only

objects. Pain? Objects don't feel
pain. You won't feel any pain when
you're attacked and raped in a dark
alley by some boy you thought was
your friend. All you have to do is
comb your hair and put your make
up back on and you'll still be cute.
And that's all that counts, right?

Stanford mediocrity
There are two vast dimensions to
life. The vertical, the deeply per
sonal, is the domain of ever
recurring tragedy.
Particularly at Stanford, where the
other dimension, the daily practical
one, has run away with the show.
This one-sided emphasis on effi
ciency brought Germany low indeed,
and we should not forget it. We are *
too much under the sway of Silicon
Valley. There is far too much glib
talk about the pervasive sameness
between the sexes, races and the
like. The human right to fail has
been banned.
The atmosphere has become al
most Polyanna, certainly namby
pamby. The finest novels of our
tradition are not taught as they were
written for fear of offending some
one, of going against some shallow
trend from the current mythology or
mind set.
This is not only stultifying and
stunting spiritually, it is dangerous to
human development even in practi
cal terms. It is a well established fact
of psychology that it is through
dreams and imaginative art that the
violent urges of mankind are best
released.
If, according to the Stanford-Katz
report of a few years past, Stanford
students take social life and sports
seriously, their studies considerably
less (largely, no doubt, because you
can get really jolted by the former,
scarcely at all in studies where even
failure is absent), shouldn't we learn
from that?
Is it not finally unfortunate that
(partly as a lingering result of the
Great Society emphasis on social
engineering, which is being
repudiated throughout the Western
world as we write) Stanford should
keep running headlong into a flatten
ing mediocrity in its humanistic
studies?
