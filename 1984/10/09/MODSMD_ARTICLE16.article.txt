## Dave Dutcher Don't start packing 
### 
I hate to pop the bubbles of the
people who are packing their red
shorts and T-shirts in anticipation
of a January Rose Bowl date in
Pasadena.
Let's be honest with ourselves.
The UCLA team that Stanford
dominated for three quarters Sat
urday appears to be very average
this season. The Bruins might be
better with a proven quarterback,
but until they find one, they will
not enjoy the success they did last
season.
In fact, the Bruins might find
themselves behind new Pacific 10
Conference frontrunners at the
end of this season — teams like
the University of Arizona and the
University of Oregon — and per
haps Stanford, if the Cardinal can
continue playing aggressive, op
portunistic defense and achieving
a desirable mix of running and
passing on offense. Stanford will
have to, because it won't sneak up
on anyone else the rest of this
season.
On Saturday, Stanford nearly
gave the game away as it did last
season against UCLA. Last year,
the Bruins scored 26 fourth
quarter points to deny the Car
dinal its first win, 39-21.
With a 23-7 lead and a bit more
than 10 minutes remaining, Stan
ford:
1) Changed UCLA placekicker
John Lee's first missed field goal
attempt of this season into a
touchdown by roughing Lee. The
Bruins scored on the ensuing play
and a two-point conversion made
the score 23-15.
2) With the half-filled Rose
Bowl going crazy, Kevin Scott's
89-yard kickoff return swung the
momentum back to the Cardinal.
Then, from UCLA's 10-yard line,
Fred Buckley threw an intercep
tion. Buckley, who played with a
lot of poise, doesn't call the offen
sive plays, so he's not to blame for
apparent greed.
Why, with an eight-point lead,
do you throw the ball? The answer
is: You don't. Period. You run the
ball to kill time and because
there's less risk. With the way
Stanford was running the ball, a
touchdown was very likely, and it
would've put the game away. A
pass at that stage was inadvisable,
to put it mildly.
3) A blown coverage in the sec
ondary allows UCLA's Mike
Sherrard to get open, thrown to,
and into the end zone. Hey,

mistakes happen, and this one
happens a lot if you've watched
Stanford football in recent years.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, its
defense saves the day, stopping
the Bruins' two-point conversion
attempt that would've tied the
game.
Now, however, these things
don't matter. Jack Elway got his
first Pac-10 victory, and people
don't talk about how Stanford
nearly blew it, they talk about how
close and exciting the game was.
They also talk about going down
to Pasadena in January, when it's
raining up here. Until Stanford
learns how to win, which includes
throwing a knockout punch when
the opponent is wavering, plan to
watch the Rose Bowl on televi
sion.
You might also plan to watch
Washington on Jan. 1. For a
preview, the Huskies will be at
Stanford Stadium Saturday, and a
bit of irony surrounds this game.
The last time Washington
visited the Farm, it was ranked
No. 1 in the country. The Cardinal
beat the Huskies, 43-31, for one
of five victories that season. Wash
ington, which was ranked No. 3
last week, should be ranked
second by Saturday since No. 2
Ohio State lost last Saturday.
You can bet Washington Coach
Don James remembers his last trip
here. You can also count on a
crack Husky squad, which did the
unthinkable when it defeated the
University of Michigan on the
road early this season. When
Douglas S. Looney of Sports Il
lustrated ranked the nation's top
college coaches, he did it this way:
1) Don James, 2) Don James, 3)
Don James.

On the basketball court, it ought
to be interesting to see how Stan
ford Coach Tom Davis is affected,
if at all, by one of the latest Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion rule additions.
This season, coaches will be
restricted to a 28-foot sideline
"box." They will be able to leave
this confinement only during
timeouts, halftime and trips to the
scorer's table.
Ostensibly, this rule was in
stituted to keep overactive
coaches from making fans unruly
and violent. Davis likes to make
his presence known, and he likes
to have a loud "sixth man" — the
crowd. Stay tuned.

raining up here. Until Stanford
learns how to win, which includes
throwing a knockout punch when
the opponent is wavering, plan to
watch the Rose Bowl on televi
sion.
You might also plan to watch
Washington on Jan. 1. For a
preview, the Huskies will be at
Stanford Stadium Saturday, and a
bit of irony surrounds this game.
The last time Washington
visited the Farm, it was ranked
No. 1 in the country. The Cardinal
beat the Huskies, 43-31, for one
of five victories that season. Wash
ington, which was ranked No. 3
last week, should be ranked
second by Saturday since No. 2
Ohio State lost last Saturday.
You can bet Washington Coach
Don James remembers his last trip
here. You can also count on a
crack Husky squad, which did the
unthinkable when it defeated the
University of Michigan on the
road early this season. When
Douglas S. Looney of Sports Il
lustrated ranked the nation's top
college coaches, he did it this way:
1) Don James, 2) Don James, 3)
Don James.

On the basketball court, it ought
to be interesting to see how Stan
ford Coach Tom Davis is affected,
if at all, by one of the latest Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion rule additions.
This season, coaches will be
restricted to a 28-foot sideline
"box." They will be able to leave
this confinement only during
timeouts, halftime and trips to the
scorer's table.
Ostensibly, this rule was in
stituted to keep overactive
coaches from making fans unruly
and violent. Davis likes to make
his presence known, and he likes
to have a loud "sixth man" — the
crowd. Stay tuned.

I hate to pop the bubbles of the
people who are packing their red
shorts and T-shirts in anticipation
of a January Rose Bowl date in
Pasadena.
Let's be honest with ourselves.
The UCLA team that Stanford
dominated for three quarters Sat
urday appears to be very average
this season. The Bruins might be
better with a proven quarterback,
but until they find one, they will
not enjoy the success they did last
season.
In fact, the Bruins might find
themselves behind new Pacific 10
Conference frontrunners at the
end of this season — teams like
the University of Arizona and the
University of Oregon — and per
haps Stanford, if the Cardinal can
continue playing aggressive, op
portunistic defense and achieving
a desirable mix of running and
passing on offense. Stanford will
have to, because it won't sneak up
on anyone else the rest of this
season.
On Saturday, Stanford nearly
gave the game away as it did last
season against UCLA. Last year,
the Bruins scored 26 fourth
quarter points to deny the Car
dinal its first win, 39-21.
With a 23-7 lead and a bit more
than 10 minutes remaining, Stan
ford:
1) Changed UCLA placekicker
John Lee's first missed field goal
attempt of this season into a
touchdown by roughing Lee. The
Bruins scored on the ensuing play
and a two-point conversion made
the score 23-15.
2) With the half-filled Rose
Bowl going crazy, Kevin Scott's
89-yard kickoff return swung the
momentum back to the Cardinal.
Then, from UCLA's 10-yard line,
Fred Buckley threw an intercep
tion. Buckley, who played with a
lot of poise, doesn't call the offen
sive plays, so he's not to blame for
apparent greed.
Why, with an eight-point lead,
do you throw the ball? The answer
is: You don't. Period. You run the
ball to kill time and because
there's less risk. With the way
Stanford was running the ball, a
touchdown was very likely, and it
would've put the game away. A
pass at that stage was inadvisable,
to put it mildly.
3) A blown coverage in the sec
ondary allows UCLA's Mike
Sherrard to get open, thrown to,
and into the end zone. Hey,

mistakes happen, and this one
happens a lot if you've watched
Stanford football in recent years.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, its
defense saves the day, stopping
the Bruins' two-point conversion
attempt that would've tied the
game.
Now, however, these things
don't matter. Jack Elway got his
first Pac-10 victory, and people
don't talk about how Stanford
nearly blew it, they talk about how
close and exciting the game was.
They also talk about going down
to Pasadena in January, when it's
raining up here. Until Stanford
learns how to win, which includes
throwing a knockout punch when
the opponent is wavering, plan to
watch the Rose Bowl on televi
sion.
