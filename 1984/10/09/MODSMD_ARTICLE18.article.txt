# Stanford spikers face UOP Tigers
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON 
Consistency appears to be the key
tomorrow night, as the Stanford wo
men's volleyball team will take on the
University of Pacific in a non
conference match at Stockton.
UOP, ranked in a preseason Col
legiate Volleyball Coaches Associa
tion poll as the top women's volley
ball team in the nation, is now ranked
No. 4 with an overall record of 12-3,
and a Northern Pacific Athletic Con
ference record of 3-1. The Cardinal,
6-1 overall, 3-1 in the Women's Col
legiate Athletic Association confer
ence, is ranked third in the nation this
week.
Because the game is non
conference, it has no bearing on
either teams' chances for reaching the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion playoffs. Even so, the closeness
of the rankings will provide for a
heated match.
Cardinal Asst. Coach Don Shaw
said, "The match really doesn't mean
anything being non-conference. But
of course there is the natural rivalry.
We will definitely be ready to go, and
they (UOP) will be really fired up.
But it's not a life or death type of
match."
A question surrounding the game is
whether UOP will play its top setter,
Jan Saunders. The senior from Man
hattan Beach has been sidelined with

an injury the Tigers' last four games.
She is expected to suit up against thÂ£
Cardinal. Saunders is a two-time first
team All America player. UOP has
gone 2-2 during her absence.
Other top UOP players include
middle blocker Eileen Dempstei,
who was a first team CVCA Alf-
America player last year. "She's
great blocker and hitter. To be namefl
All-America as a middle blocker re
really special, because there are so
many good middle blockers out
there," Shaw said. Dempster-will also
be "fired up" to play against heir
Stanford counterpart Kim Oden, ac
cording to Shaw.
Stanford, coming off consecutive
wins over the University of Arizona
and Arizona State University over
the weekend, will need to play a
strong game against UOP. Shaw said,
"UOP is usually a very consistent
team, but so are all of our top oppo
nents. Volleyball is such a game of
momentum that we are always striv
ing to eliminate the small peaks and
valleys and play as consistently as we
possibly can."
But UOP has not been playing with
continuity lately. The Tigers recently
lost a tough match to San Jose State,
3-2. San Jose State was ranked 14th
