# Dettamanti endures change

### VAL CRITES 
Dante Dettamanti's life has changed significantly
during 1984, but his is no Orwellian tale of dark and
foreboding occurences. Rather, the year has brought
pleasant change for Stanford's men's water polo coach.
At the beginning of the calendar year it appeared that
Dettamanti's team was on the verge of losing its varsity
status as part of the Athletic Department's decision to
restructure the university's athletic programs.
The basis for the proposed change was the questionable
future of NCAA-sponsored water polo on the collegiate
level. As a result of the uncertainty of the NCAA spon
soring a championship in water polo, the Athletic Depart
ment considered lowering support for the second-most
successful sport at Stanford.
"I was really disappointed when the attempt to move us
down in varsity status happened," said Dettamanti. "I
thought it showed no respect at all for the sport or our
program. There's disappointment that goes with being
treated as a minor sport, although it is a fact of life."
Unfortunately, financial matters were not the only
cloud in the sky. Playing with a starting lineup which in
cluded five freshmen, the 1983 team had finished with its
first losing record since 1972. All of the starters from the

1982 NCAA second-place team had graduated, except
for goalie Steve Moyer.
Now, only a few short months later, the picture has
brightened for Dettamanti and the water polo team. The
team is at full varsity status, and has powered past its op
ponents to rank second in the nation with a record of 14-
2.
The team this year is "totally different" than last year,
according to Moyer. "We've worked together for a whole
year, and we know what to expect from each other now,
whereas last year so many of the guys were new."
The sophomore-oriented team is demonstrating that
the lessons they learned last year under fire did not go
unheeded, Dettamanti said. "Usually I like to ease fresh
men into the lineup instead of rushing them, but last year I
had no choice because there was nobody else."
Dettamanti is excited about the play of this year's team.
"We've got an exceptional group of guys this year," Det
tamanti said. "By the time these guys are seniors they
could be even better than the group we had here in 1981."
Stanford's 1981 team went undefeated (31-0) for the
season, and won the NCAA championship game by 11
