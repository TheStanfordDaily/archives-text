# Dettamanti endures change
## 
### VAL CRITES 
Dante Dettamanti's life has changed significantly
during 1984, but his is no Orwellian tale of dark and
foreboding occurences. Rather, the year has brought
pleasant change for Stanford's men's water polo coach.
At the beginning of the calendar year it appeared that
Dettamanti's team was on the verge of losing its varsity
status as part of the Athletic Department's decision to
restructure the university's athletic programs.
The basis for the proposed change was the questionable
future of NCAA-sponsored water polo on the collegiate
level. As a result of the uncertainty of the NCAA spon
soring a championship in water polo, the Athletic Depart
ment considered lowering support for the second-most
successful sport at Stanford.
"I was really disappointed when the attempt to move us
down in varsity status happened," said Dettamanti. "I
thought it showed no respect at all for the sport or our
program. There's disappointment that goes with being
treated as a minor sport, although it is a fact of life."
Unfortunately, financial matters were not the only
cloud in the sky. Playing with a starting lineup which in
cluded five freshmen, the 1983 team had finished with its
first losing record since 1972. All of the starters from the

1982 NCAA second-place team had graduated, except
for goalie Steve Moyer.
Now, only a few short months later, the picture has
brightened for Dettamanti and the water polo team. The
team is at full varsity status, and has powered past its op
ponents to rank second in the nation with a record of 14-
2.
The team this year is "totally different" than last year,
according to Moyer. "We've worked together for a whole
year, and we know what to expect from each other now,
whereas last year so many of the guys were new."
The sophomore-oriented team is demonstrating that
the lessons they learned last year under fire did not go
unheeded, Dettamanti said. "Usually I like to ease fresh
men into the lineup instead of rushing them, but last year I
had no choice because there was nobody else."
Dettamanti is excited about the play of this year's team.
"We've got an exceptional group of guys this year," Det
tamanti said. "By the time these guys are seniors they
could be even better than the group we had here in 1981."
Stanford's 1981 team went undefeated (31-0) for the
season, and won the NCAA championship game by 11


Dante Dettamanti
goals. They were picked by mapy observers as the top
team in NCAA history.
As rewarding as the 1981 championship was for Detta
manti. he ranks winning his first NCAA championship in
1978 as the biggest thrill of his coaching career. The game
was against the University of California at Berkeley, and
took seven quarters to be decided.
"You just can't imagine the thrill when that game con
cluded, it was overwhelming," Dettamanti said. "The
game was a real battle, and then suddenly it was over and
we had won in sudden-death. The conclusion came so un
expectedly that it made it all the more emotional when 1
realized that the game was over and wc were champions."
Winning is nothing new to Dettamanti. Under his guid
ance the Cardinal has won 15 of 18 games in NCAA
Championship competition, including three title games.
He has been named Pacific 10 Conference Coach of the
Year four times, and 34 Cardinal players have been Ail-
Americans since he took over the helm here.
Internationally, Dettamanti's teams have also fared
well. In the 1979 World University Games at Mexico

City, he guided the U.S. team to a surprising gold medal.
In that game it was a young and relatively inexperienced
American team that topped the Soviet Union tor the gold,
virtually the same Soviet team that went on to win the
Olympic Gold in 1980.
At the 1981 Games in Bucharest, the U.S. team took
the silver medal, again with Dettamanti as coach.
Dettamanti has been named the U.S. National B-team
coach, a four-year appointment. By the logical progres
sion, he hopes to spend the following four years as the A
team coach, culminating as coach of the U.S. team tor the
1992 Olympics.
Collegiate water polo has been part ot Dettamanti's life
since his years as an undergraduate at the University of
California at Davis, where he was named most valuable
player and team captain as a senior in 1965. He began
coaching in 1968 at UCLA as an assistant in both water
polo and swimming, helping the Bruins to the water polo
national championship in 1969.
In 1970, he was named head coach for both sports at
Occidental College, where he turned both teams into
NAIA contenders in his four-year stay. He took over the
University of California at Santa Barbara water polo
coaching job in 1974, pacing the Gauchos to a fourth
place NCAA finish prior to taking over the helm at Stan
ford.

whereas last year so many of the guys were new."
The sophomore-oriented team is demonstrating that
the lessons they learned last year under fire did not go
unheeded, Dettamanti said. "Usually I like to ease fresh
men into the lineup instead of rushing them, but last year I
had no choice because there was nobody else."
Dettamanti is excited about the play of this year's team.
"We've got an exceptional group of guys this year," Det
tamanti said. "By the time these guys are seniors they
could be even better than the group we had here in 1981."
Stanford's 1981 team went undefeated (31-0) for the
season, and won the NCAA championship game by 11


Dante Dettamanti
goals. They were picked by mapy observers as the top
team in NCAA history.
As rewarding as the 1981 championship was for Detta
manti. he ranks winning his first NCAA championship in
1978 as the biggest thrill of his coaching career. The game
was against the University of California at Berkeley, and
took seven quarters to be decided.
"You just can't imagine the thrill when that game con
cluded, it was overwhelming," Dettamanti said. "The
game was a real battle, and then suddenly it was over and
we had won in sudden-death. The conclusion came so un
expectedly that it made it all the more emotional when 1
realized that the game was over and wc were champions."
Winning is nothing new to Dettamanti. Under his guid
ance the Cardinal has won 15 of 18 games in NCAA
Championship competition, including three title games.
He has been named Pacific 10 Conference Coach of the
Year four times, and 34 Cardinal players have been Ail-
Americans since he took over the helm here.
Internationally, Dettamanti's teams have also fared
well. In the 1979 World University Games at Mexico

City, he guided the U.S. team to a surprising gold medal.
In that game it was a young and relatively inexperienced
American team that topped the Soviet Union tor the gold,
virtually the same Soviet team that went on to win the
Olympic Gold in 1980.
At the 1981 Games in Bucharest, the U.S. team took
the silver medal, again with Dettamanti as coach.
Dettamanti has been named the U.S. National B-team
coach, a four-year appointment. By the logical progres
sion, he hopes to spend the following four years as the A
team coach, culminating as coach of the U.S. team tor the
1992 Olympics.
Collegiate water polo has been part ot Dettamanti's life
since his years as an undergraduate at the University of
California at Davis, where he was named most valuable
player and team captain as a senior in 1965. He began
coaching in 1968 at UCLA as an assistant in both water
polo and swimming, helping the Bruins to the water polo
national championship in 1969.
In 1970, he was named head coach for both sports at
Occidental College, where he turned both teams into
NAIA contenders in his four-year stay. He took over the
University of California at Santa Barbara water polo
coaching job in 1974, pacing the Gauchos to a fourth
place NCAA finish prior to taking over the helm at Stan
ford.
Dante Dettamanti's life has changed significantly
during 1984, but his is no Orwellian tale of dark and
foreboding occurences. Rather, the year has brought
pleasant change for Stanford's men's water polo coach.
At the beginning of the calendar year it appeared that
Dettamanti's team was on the verge of losing its varsity
status as part of the Athletic Department's decision to
restructure the university's athletic programs.
The basis for the proposed change was the questionable
future of NCAA-sponsored water polo on the collegiate
level. As a result of the uncertainty of the NCAA spon
soring a championship in water polo, the Athletic Depart
ment considered lowering support for the second-most
successful sport at Stanford.
"I was really disappointed when the attempt to move us
down in varsity status happened," said Dettamanti. "I
thought it showed no respect at all for the sport or our
program. There's disappointment that goes with being
treated as a minor sport, although it is a fact of life."
Unfortunately, financial matters were not the only
cloud in the sky. Playing with a starting lineup which in
cluded five freshmen, the 1983 team had finished with its
first losing record since 1972. All of the starters from the

1982 NCAA second-place team had graduated, except
for goalie Steve Moyer.
Now, only a few short months later, the picture has
brightened for Dettamanti and the water polo team. The
team is at full varsity status, and has powered past its op
ponents to rank second in the nation with a record of 14-
2.
The team this year is "totally different" than last year,
according to Moyer. "We've worked together for a whole
year, and we know what to expect from each other now,
whereas last year so many of the guys were new."
The sophomore-oriented team is demonstrating that
the lessons they learned last year under fire did not go
