# Union dispute drags on

### MARK BEYREIS 
Both the University and the United Stan
ford Workers are beginning preparations
for the Oct. 30 elections, the next step in a
controversy that has gone unresolved since
early February.
This election will determine whether or
not the 1,330 technical, maintenance, and
service workers at Stanford will be
represented by a union. The University has
said that it will oppose the union. Stanford
Counsel Priscilla Wheeler commented,
"We would like a chance to deal with [.the
workers] directly without a confrontation
with the labor organization."
The controversy began eight months ago
when USW changed its affiliation from
Local 715 of the Service Employees Inter
national Union (SIEU) to Local 680. The
University refused to recognize Local 680,
saying there had been no disaffiliation elec
tion.
USW responded by filing charges of un
fair labor practices against Stanford with
the National Labor Relations Board. The
University maintained that the changing of
affiliation could not be considered an inter
nal matter and did not believe that Local
680 was authorized by Stanford employees.
On April 18, USW held an election to
confirm Local 680. The workers voted 632
to 125 to accept Local 680, but the Univer
sity questioned the validity of the election

because of the wording of the ballot and
filed a protest with the NLRB.
The ballot asked workers whether or not
they wanted Local 680 to represent them.
The election was conducted by the Ameri
can Arbitration Association, an indepen
dent agency.
Stanford said the election was not valid
because it wasn't conducted by the NLRB
and also because it did not give workers a
chance to choose "no union."
USW received support in May when 57
faculty and staff members signed a petition
asking the University to accept Local 680.
Now, however, USW is being cautious in
the area of faculty support.
Faculty members are entitled to their
rights of free speech, but support beyond
that could be considered interference with
management. USW Counsel Jim Eggleston
said the union is trying to eliminate
loopholes that could jeopardize the election.
The Oakland regional office of the
NLRB eventually sided with USW. On
May 25, it issued a complaint against Stan
ford in which it affirmed that the election
had been valid. Local 680 was the legal rep
resentative of University workers and Stan
ford was violating the law by not recogniz
ing USW.
The University disregarded the com
plaint, and a hearing was set for Sept. 18
before an administrative law judge.

However, the two sides agreed on a settle
ment outlining conditions for the Oct. 30
election a short time before the September
hearing. Eggleston said that USW agreed to
the election because it was the quickest
method of resolving the conflict since the
NLRB-hearing process, including Stan
ford's anticipated appeals, could have taken
years.
Law Prof. Charles Gould, an expert in
labor law and an arbitrator for labor
disputes across the country, said that unions
changing affiliation is essentially an organi
zational matter. Though the University had
what Gould describes as an "arguable legal
point," he said he thought the University
was trying to eliminate the union and had
"acted in an irresponsible manner."
The Oct. 30 election will be an NLRB
election, unlike the one held April 18. This
election will be held to organize a union
whereas the previous one was held to
choose between two affiliations.
The University, say union officials, had
wanted the NLRB election because that is
the only way it can actively campaign, and it
gives workers the option of not having a
union at all.
The new ballot, like the April ballot, will
