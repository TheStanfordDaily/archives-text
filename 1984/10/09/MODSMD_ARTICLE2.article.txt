# Union dispute drags on
## 
### MARK BEYREIS 
Both the University and the United Stan
ford Workers are beginning preparations
for the Oct. 30 elections, the next step in a
controversy that has gone unresolved since
early February.
This election will determine whether or
not the 1,330 technical, maintenance, and
service workers at Stanford will be
represented by a union. The University has
said that it will oppose the union. Stanford
Counsel Priscilla Wheeler commented,
"We would like a chance to deal with [.the
workers] directly without a confrontation
with the labor organization."
The controversy began eight months ago
when USW changed its affiliation from
Local 715 of the Service Employees Inter
national Union (SIEU) to Local 680. The
University refused to recognize Local 680,
saying there had been no disaffiliation elec
tion.
USW responded by filing charges of un
fair labor practices against Stanford with
the National Labor Relations Board. The
University maintained that the changing of
affiliation could not be considered an inter
nal matter and did not believe that Local
680 was authorized by Stanford employees.
On April 18, USW held an election to
confirm Local 680. The workers voted 632
to 125 to accept Local 680, but the Univer
sity questioned the validity of the election

because of the wording of the ballot and
filed a protest with the NLRB.
The ballot asked workers whether or not
they wanted Local 680 to represent them.
The election was conducted by the Ameri
can Arbitration Association, an indepen
dent agency.
Stanford said the election was not valid
because it wasn't conducted by the NLRB
and also because it did not give workers a
chance to choose "no union."
USW received support in May when 57
faculty and staff members signed a petition
asking the University to accept Local 680.
Now, however, USW is being cautious in
the area of faculty support.
Faculty members are entitled to their
rights of free speech, but support beyond
that could be considered interference with
management. USW Counsel Jim Eggleston
said the union is trying to eliminate
loopholes that could jeopardize the election.
The Oakland regional office of the
NLRB eventually sided with USW. On
May 25, it issued a complaint against Stan
ford in which it affirmed that the election
had been valid. Local 680 was the legal rep
resentative of University workers and Stan
ford was violating the law by not recogniz
ing USW.
The University disregarded the com
plaint, and a hearing was set for Sept. 18
before an administrative law judge.

However, the two sides agreed on a settle
ment outlining conditions for the Oct. 30
election a short time before the September
hearing. Eggleston said that USW agreed to
the election because it was the quickest
method of resolving the conflict since the
NLRB-hearing process, including Stan
ford's anticipated appeals, could have taken
years.
Law Prof. Charles Gould, an expert in
labor law and an arbitrator for labor
disputes across the country, said that unions
changing affiliation is essentially an organi
zational matter. Though the University had
what Gould describes as an "arguable legal
point," he said he thought the University
was trying to eliminate the union and had
"acted in an irresponsible manner."
The Oct. 30 election will be an NLRB
election, unlike the one held April 18. This
election will be held to organize a union
whereas the previous one was held to
choose between two affiliations.
The University, say union officials, had
wanted the NLRB election because that is
the only way it can actively campaign, and it
gives workers the option of not having a
union at all.
The new ballot, like the April ballot, will
read," Do you wish to be represented for
purposes of collective bargaining by United
Stanford Workers, Local 680,
SEIU?"
USW proposed a "low-key" cam
paign in which neither side would
make an issue of the other's record.
The University, however, rejected
the proposal. According to USW staff
member Mary Anne Tenuto, the
union will still base its campaign on
its own accomplishments and not the
actions of the University.
Wheeler said the University didn't
want a low-key campaign because it
wanted to distribute information to
and clarify questions for the workers.
"We have some very definite
opinions based on past history, day to
day experiences, and collective bar
gaining. We want to distribute infor
mation and let the workers decide,"
she said.
According to Tenuto, the union
will do most of its campaigning
through direct contact with members
and through shop meetings. USW

hopes to make the benefits the
workers gained in past years the main
issue.
Tenuto cites wage increases, a first
ever dental plan, a birthday holiday
for each worker, fair grievance
procedures and an improved pension
plan as examples of the union's
record.
In addition, the union is planning
an Oct. 18 rally. Speakers for the
rally include Ceasar Chavez, organi
zer of California farm workers, and
Martin Carnoy, the Democratic can
didate for Congress in the 12th Dis
trict and a professor of education
here.
Wheeler said that the University's
plan of action would be one of res
ponding to any questions it receives,
clarifying things that are unclear and
telling the workers what it knows
about the union. Stanford, according
to Wheeler, does not believe that the
union has accomplished the benefits
the workers have received. "It is not a
fact that they have done better than
non-represented employees," said
Wheeler.

Eggleston says that the non-union
workers have the same benefits be
cause of a "ripple effect" in which
non-represented workers receive the
same gains but only after the union
has bargained for them. "If we don't
get what they don't want to give, why
are they opposing us?" asks Eggles
ton.
Wheeler said that the 1982 con
tract dispute is an example of the
labor- organization confrontation the
University is trying to avoid. She said
that a lot of things were introduced in
the bargaining sessions by the union
that "didn't make sense."
The union then struck and returned
31 days later only to accept what she
feels was the same basic package.
If the University should win the
October election, the technical, main
tenance and service workers would
not be represented by any union and
could not attempt to hold another
election for one full year.
Gould said this situation would
"mean the employees will have to
rely on the beneficence of the em
ployer which is never a good position.

"In the long run it would have a
damaging effect on Stanford's ability
to establish relations with all
employees," he added.
In the event it is victorious, Stan
ford has already agreed to uphold the
conditions of the current contract on
an individual basis until it expires
next August.
Eggleston, however, said such a
contract would be "worthless with no
one to enforce it." Grievances would,
Eggleston said, be decided by the
University and not arbitration,
making Stanford both "judge and
jury".
If the union wins, the University
will, according to the agreement, rec
ognize Local 680 as the bargaining
representative of the workers. Eg
gleston said he would then hope to
normalize relations with Stanford.
But Gould said an aggressive Stan
ford campaign would probably
worsen USW-University relations
even if the union wins. "The greater
the intensity of the anti-union cam
paign the less likely it is that relations
will be better."

because it wasn't conducted by the NLRB
and also because it did not give workers a
chance to choose "no union."
USW received support in May when 57
faculty and staff members signed a petition
asking the University to accept Local 680.
Now, however, USW is being cautious in
the area of faculty support.
Faculty members are entitled to their
rights of free speech, but support beyond
that could be considered interference with
management. USW Counsel Jim Eggleston
said the union is trying to eliminate
loopholes that could jeopardize the election.
The Oakland regional office of the
NLRB eventually sided with USW. On
May 25, it issued a complaint against Stan
ford in which it affirmed that the election
had been valid. Local 680 was the legal rep
resentative of University workers and Stan
ford was violating the law by not recogniz
ing USW.
The University disregarded the com
plaint, and a hearing was set for Sept. 18
before an administrative law judge.

However, the two sides agreed on a settle
ment outlining conditions for the Oct. 30
election a short time before the September
hearing. Eggleston said that USW agreed to
the election because it was the quickest
method of resolving the conflict since the
NLRB-hearing process, including Stan
ford's anticipated appeals, could have taken
years.
Law Prof. Charles Gould, an expert in
labor law and an arbitrator for labor
disputes across the country, said that unions
changing affiliation is essentially an organi
zational matter. Though the University had
what Gould describes as an "arguable legal
point," he said he thought the University
was trying to eliminate the union and had
"acted in an irresponsible manner."
The Oct. 30 election will be an NLRB
election, unlike the one held April 18. This
election will be held to organize a union
whereas the previous one was held to
choose between two affiliations.
The University, say union officials, had
wanted the NLRB election because that is
the only way it can actively campaign, and it
gives workers the option of not having a
union at all.
The new ballot, like the April ballot, will
read," Do you wish to be represented for
purposes of collective bargaining by United
Stanford Workers, Local 680,
SEIU?"
USW proposed a "low-key" cam
paign in which neither side would
make an issue of the other's record.
The University, however, rejected
the proposal. According to USW staff
member Mary Anne Tenuto, the
union will still base its campaign on
its own accomplishments and not the
actions of the University.
Wheeler said the University didn't
want a low-key campaign because it
wanted to distribute information to
and clarify questions for the workers.
"We have some very definite
opinions based on past history, day to
day experiences, and collective bar
gaining. We want to distribute infor
mation and let the workers decide,"
she said.
According to Tenuto, the union
will do most of its campaigning
through direct contact with members
and through shop meetings. USW

hopes to make the benefits the
workers gained in past years the main
issue.
Tenuto cites wage increases, a first
ever dental plan, a birthday holiday
for each worker, fair grievance
procedures and an improved pension
plan as examples of the union's
record.
In addition, the union is planning
an Oct. 18 rally. Speakers for the
rally include Ceasar Chavez, organi
zer of California farm workers, and
Martin Carnoy, the Democratic can
didate for Congress in the 12th Dis
trict and a professor of education
here.
Wheeler said that the University's
plan of action would be one of res
ponding to any questions it receives,
clarifying things that are unclear and
telling the workers what it knows
about the union. Stanford, according
to Wheeler, does not believe that the
union has accomplished the benefits
the workers have received. "It is not a
fact that they have done better than
non-represented employees," said
Wheeler.

Eggleston says that the non-union
workers have the same benefits be
cause of a "ripple effect" in which
non-represented workers receive the
same gains but only after the union
has bargained for them. "If we don't
get what they don't want to give, why
are they opposing us?" asks Eggles
ton.
Wheeler said that the 1982 con
tract dispute is an example of the
labor- organization confrontation the
University is trying to avoid. She said
that a lot of things were introduced in
the bargaining sessions by the union
that "didn't make sense."
The union then struck and returned
31 days later only to accept what she
feels was the same basic package.
If the University should win the
October election, the technical, main
tenance and service workers would
not be represented by any union and
could not attempt to hold another
election for one full year.
Gould said this situation would
"mean the employees will have to
rely on the beneficence of the em
ployer which is never a good position.

"In the long run it would have a
damaging effect on Stanford's ability
to establish relations with all
employees," he added.
In the event it is victorious, Stan
ford has already agreed to uphold the
conditions of the current contract on
an individual basis until it expires
next August.
Eggleston, however, said such a
contract would be "worthless with no
one to enforce it." Grievances would,
Eggleston said, be decided by the
University and not arbitration,
making Stanford both "judge and
jury".
If the union wins, the University
will, according to the agreement, rec
ognize Local 680 as the bargaining
representative of the workers. Eg
gleston said he would then hope to
normalize relations with Stanford.
But Gould said an aggressive Stan
ford campaign would probably
worsen USW-University relations
even if the union wins. "The greater
the intensity of the anti-union cam
paign the less likely it is that relations
will be better."
Both the University and the United Stan
ford Workers are beginning preparations
for the Oct. 30 elections, the next step in a
controversy that has gone unresolved since
early February.
This election will determine whether or
not the 1,330 technical, maintenance, and
service workers at Stanford will be
represented by a union. The University has
said that it will oppose the union. Stanford
Counsel Priscilla Wheeler commented,
"We would like a chance to deal with [.the
workers] directly without a confrontation
with the labor organization."
The controversy began eight months ago
when USW changed its affiliation from
Local 715 of the Service Employees Inter
national Union (SIEU) to Local 680. The
University refused to recognize Local 680,
saying there had been no disaffiliation elec
tion.
USW responded by filing charges of un
fair labor practices against Stanford with
the National Labor Relations Board. The
University maintained that the changing of
affiliation could not be considered an inter
nal matter and did not believe that Local
680 was authorized by Stanford employees.
On April 18, USW held an election to
confirm Local 680. The workers voted 632
to 125 to accept Local 680, but the Univer
sity questioned the validity of the election

because of the wording of the ballot and
filed a protest with the NLRB.
The ballot asked workers whether or not
they wanted Local 680 to represent them.
The election was conducted by the Ameri
can Arbitration Association, an indepen
dent agency.
Stanford said the election was not valid

and also because it did not give workers a
