## 'Buckaroo Banzai' deserves audience 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
After months of hesitation on the
part of Twentieth Century-Fox, "The
Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai
Across the Bth Dimension" has fi
nally opened nationwide, though so
far — with a few notable exceptions
— the press has declined to pay much
attention to it. But this New Wave
comic strip adventure, with its
parodic echoes of "M*A*S*H*" and
"Annie Hall" and the whole
catalog of Hollywood sci-fi pictures
from the 19505, deserves an audi
ence: It's consistently funny, despite
the plot confusion and the unsuccess
ful efforts of first-time-out director
W.D. Richter to balance several
dozen narrative and character ele
ments.
The story plunks the Japanese-
American cosmic cool leading man
Buckaroo (Peter Weller, of the
electric blue eyes) and his gang, the
Hong Kong Cavaliers (scientists, rock
'n' rollers and comic book super
heroes), in the middle of a war be
tween the Black Lectroids and the
Red Lectroids. The villainous Red
Lectroids, who infiltrated our planet
in 1938 during the alleged Orson
Welles "War of the Worlds" hoax, all
have the same earthling first name,
John. Their leader, Lord John Whor

fin (John L.ithgow), doubles as Dr.
Emilio Lizardo, a lunatic hooked on
electric currents since, in an experi
ment conducted in tandem with
Buckaroo, he failed to cross into the
eighth dimension (which would have
enabled him to penetrate solid matter)
and ended up smashed against a wall.
The Black Lectroids, who transform
themselves into black men and wo
men with extravagant dreadlocks
when they descend to earth, are
good-guy aliens, but they deem their
enemy so intergalactically dangerous
that they threaten to destroy this
planet unless Buckaroo helps them to
apprehend the crew of malevolent
Johns.
It takes us a while to become ac
customed to the barrage of plot and
the overlapping, Altmanesque
dialogue in the opening scenes; the
current ads isolate and underscore
some of the plot threads, so that
audiences are less likely to get lost in
the first half hour and give up trying
to sort out the film, and that may be a
commercially wise move, even if it
does have the look of spoon feeding.
Richter, who can profess few equals
among American screenwriters — his
work includes the 1978 remake of
"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"
and the unknown, remarkable Gene
Hackman-Barbra Streisand comedy

"All Night Long" — has neither the
experience nor the wild-man-prodigy
instincts to render Earl Mac Rauch's
script fully intelligible. And he has yet
to learn how to punch and shape un
derwritten supporting roles, so some
of the most talented or promising
performers (Ellen Barkin, Jeff
Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd, Lewis
Smith) get buried under piles of nar
rative debris after making their initial
strong impressions. But Richter's all
systems-go direction demonstrates an
appreciation of Rauch's invention,
and he collaborates with production
designer J. Michael Riva, costume
designer Aggie Guerrard Rodgers,
and special visual effects supervisor
Michael Fink, as well as the usually
unyielding photographer Fred
Koenekamp, to bring off some nifty
pop sequences and dress parades.
Buckaroo wears glasses with neon
red rims that bounce off heroine
Penny Priddy's (Ellen Barkin's) hot
pink flapper gowns, and dreamy-eyed
Perfect Tommy (Lewis Smith), Buck
aroo's lieutenant, sports a suit with
massive shoulders that recalls the one
David Byrne wore on last year's
Talking Heads concert tour (and

wears in the film "Stop Making
Sense"). The aliens' shiny leather
skin looks as if centuries of refine
ment had picked it clean of unneces
sary layers, and their eyes are wired

wide open in expressions of perman
ent surprise; their fingers quiver con
tinually, like spiders on speed. And
when Richter cuts to a shot of the

Black Lectroids in conference on
their native planet, they sit, limbs
dangling, on elongated stools. (This
image invokes the melting creatures
in a Dali.)
As Dr. Lizardo, John Lithgow
sends up all the mad scientists who
ever appeared on screen. 1 once saw
this gifted actor in a New York
revival of the Kaufman-Hart farce
"Once in a Lifetime"; as George, the
lucky innocent, Lithgow used his
panda-bear size for comic effect — he
kept his mouth open for the entire
show, so that his immense jaw,
stretching toward the ground, pro
vided the strongest vertical focus on
the stage. Though he's almost always
marvelous in movies — "Footloose"
being a notable (but understandable)
exception — "Buckaroo Banzai"
marks the first time he has had the
chance to play as big on camera as he
has on stage. With more screen time
his performance would dominate this
picture the way he dominated "The
Twilight Zone," but it would also
throw the movie even farther out of
kilter. As it is, Lithgow's Lizardo is a
grand, outsize parody, outlandishly
well suited for a cartoon fantasy.
