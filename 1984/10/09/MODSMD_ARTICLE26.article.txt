# 'The Boys' is good time comedy

### LIBBY RUFFING 
The Rodgers and Hart musical "The Boys from
Syracuse" was not the story of the exploits of two lads
from Upstate New York, but rather its locale was Ephesus
in ancient Greece and its plot was one of double identities.
This musical adaptation of Shakespeare's farce "The
Comedy of Errors" plays through Oct. 21 at the Saratoga
City Hall.
Although the musical overture was lackluster, the audi
ence was compensated visually as the curtain rose to
reveal a chorus clad completely in red, white and black.
This color combination remained throughout the perfor
mance, creating a smooth, stylistic cohesion.
The story's premise of double-identity was immediately
evident, for the chorus not only held caricature masks, but
these covered the old incognito standby of the rubber
nose and glasses. The weary father, Aegean, entered this
well-choreographed scene to outline the tale's back
ground.
Years ago his wife bore twin sons, the Antipholus boys.
Simultaneously, the poor neighbor woman also gave birth
to twin sons, the Dromio boys. Unable to care for them,
she offered them as servants to Aegean. Tragedy struck as
the two sets of twins were separated while yachting. An
tipholus 1 and Dromio 1 wander from Syracuse searching
for their brothers while Antipholus 2 and Dromio 2 set up
residence in Ephesus. Possibly this production should be
subtitled "Abbott and Costello visit Pine Valley" for it
continued with slapstick humor esconced in a soap opera
theme of confused wives, confused mistresses, confused
masters and sometimes confused audience.
After the boys from Syracuse lamented their saga in a
spirited tune, the audience has its first meeting with the
boys from Ephesus. Dromio 2, a wimp, is browbeaten by
Luce, a sex-starved cross between Lucille Ball and Aunt
Jemimah (superbly played by Norma Hughes) in a playful
duet "What can you do with a man?," a show highlight.
Antipholus 2 is a womanizing scoundrel supposedly
oozing with charm; unfortunately, this element was lost in
the effeminate portrayal by Hank Lawson. The naive An
tipholus of Syracuse sunk into bawdy bewilderment as he
spends the night in his brother's home, with his brother's

The humor in the musical was successful due to
excellent timing and the aid of incongruity. When the
staid orchestra sprang from their seats for a game of
charades, the surprise left the audience chuckling. This
musical was brimming with many such light-hearted
absurdities.

wife acting under the guise of his brother. Adriana, the
wife, portrayed by Christine Wait, warbles "Falling in
Love with Love" with soft charm and grace. Another
ironic twist entered the play as Antipholus 1 encounters
Luciana, Adriana's sister. When the two meet, the music
swelled into a corny crescendo and the lights hazed into a
purple mist. Without a doubt, it is one of two things,
either love at first sight or a music cue or, in this case,
both. The plot continued with innumerable cases of predic
table mistaken identities until at last, the brothers dis
cover each other.
Of course, all ends well, to the point of nausea. Both of
the Antipholus brothers find their true loves in Adriana
and Luciana while the Dromios attempt to satisfy the
nymphomaniac Luce. Though this musical was syrupy
enough to cause diabetic coma, it was well-acted and en
tertaining. In the true sense of the Greek comedy, it was
chock full of role reversals, bawdy comedy and ultimately,
a happy reunion.
For a nonprofit drama group, the movable set was im
pressive. Each change was accompanied by an acrobat
bounding across the stage with daring feats of aerial
dynamism. (He held no significance but was nevertheless
outstanding.) The choreography, arranged by Debbie
Wilson, who was also responsible for the opening
ceremonies at the 1984 Soccer Olympics here at Stanford,
was innovative. One scene was performed totally in slow
motion (reminiscent of ABCs "super slo mo" Olympic
coverage.) It also plummeted to inanity; another scene
featured a scantily clad girl gyrating in front of shimmer
ing strips of giant tinsel.
The humor in the musical was successful due to excel
lent timing and the aid of incongruity. When the staid or
chestra sprang from their seats for a game of charades, the
surpise left the audience chuckling. This musical was
brimming with many such light-hearted absurdities. There
were a few blunders, but "The Boys from Syracuse"
should not be denounced as a musical comedy of errors,
but rather hailed as a good time musical comedy of
raucous fun and laughter. The show runs every Friday and
Saturday at 8:30 p.m. and Thursday and Sundays at 8
p.m.
