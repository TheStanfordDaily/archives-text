# 'Little Shop'delightfully silly, macabre
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
"Little Shop of Horrors" is unus
ual, usually. The bizarre twists of
Howard Ashman's script and direc
tion provide this musical comedy with
many morbidly hilarious moments. In
this production, however, the plot oc
casionally falls into tedious cliches.
Still, "Little Shop" offers an evening
of entertaining escape from reality.
The star of the show is Audrey 11, a
mutant plant of the "flytrap family."
Audrey II is discovered by a nerdish
flower shop employee named
Seymour (Ken Wood). The public is
enthralled by Seymour's discovery,
and the nerd sees the plant as his
ticket to stardom and love.
But, of course, there is a catch.
Audrey ll's trap has an affinity for
something more substantial than flies.
Yes, the thing wants to eat Cleveland,
and everyone in it.
This leaves Seymour with a prob
lem: If he can get Audrey II food, he
can get out of Skid Row and have the
girl of this dreams — you guessed it
— Audrey I (Eydie Alyson). But who
should he choose to be the evil weed's
lunch?
No problem.
Audrey I has a boyfriend. Orin
(Ken Land) is a sadistic greaser who
moonlights as a girlfriend-beating
dentist. When Seymour pays Orin a
visit, ostensibly for a root canal, he
confronts Orin with a loaded pistol,
but cannot bring himself to pull the
trigger. Instead, he sits in the dentist's
chair, while Orin prepares the nitrous
oxide — for himself. (The
greaser/dentist likes to laugh his way
through surgery.)
The gas mask gets stuck on Orin's
head, and we watch along with
Seymour as Audrey ll's lunch laughs
and sings himself to death. This scene
is one of the show's funniest, and it
typifies- the macabre sense of humor
which makes "Little Shop of Hor

rors" a pleasure.
The show has some problems when
it strays from the grotesque, and
several scenes which draw laughs for
Audrey I's tacky — and Seymour's
tackier — taste. Audrey longs for a
house with a chain link fence and
plastic covered furniture. Seymour
wants taste like hers. These scenes
could have been funnier, had Alvson
played them with more passion for
the mundane. (She might have taken
a lesson from Cyndi Lauper). Instead,
her performance borders on
caricature.
The same can be said of Stan
Rubin, who plays Seymour's boss,
Mr. Mushnik. as a stereotypic Jewish
merchant.
By contrast. Ward plays Seymour
with enough sincerity that his lack of

couth is funny, while he avoids
making the character so real that he
would seem pathetic.
Land also gives a strong perfor
mance. He plays Orin's sadism with
hysterical vigor, and returns as
several minor and equally funny char
acters after the dentist is consumed.
The most charismatic performance
of the evening is given by a plant!
Ashman's audacity in making a
botanical monster the lead in a musi
cal is enough to start the audience
laugphing. The humor is sustained by
William Szymanski's clever
manipulations and Michael Leslie's
sinister voice track.
Alan Menken's music is 1960s
doo-wop of the type made famous by
groups like the Ronnettes, the Chrys
tals and the Chiffons. In fact, Louise

Robinson, Suzanne Douglas, and B.J.
Jefferson form a trio of narrating on
lookers, who evoke the memory of
each of these groups. The tunes fit
well into the show's melodramatic es
capist tone.
"Little Shop" is presented by Bay
Area producer Bill Graham. His pro
duction is handicapped by a weak
sound system which consists of four
small speakers suspended about 30
feet above the stage, but the
performers are usually able to
overcome this with their well-trained
voices.
So, if you're in the mood for a
delightfully silly evening, head up to
Skid Row, a.k.a. the Warfield
Theatre. The "unusual and interest
ing" Audrey II and company will be
there through Oct. 28.

staff of a Skid Row flower shop invaded by an alien people-eating plant

SF. Left: Ken Ward and Eydie Alyson play lovers whose lives take an
unexpected turn when they make the acquaintance of the people

unexpected turn when they make the acquaintance of the people
eating plant.
"Little Shop of Horrors" is unus
ual, usually. The bizarre twists of
Howard Ashman's script and direc
tion provide this musical comedy with
many morbidly hilarious moments. In
this production, however, the plot oc
casionally falls into tedious cliches.
Still, "Little Shop" offers an evening
of entertaining escape from reality.
The star of the show is Audrey 11, a
mutant plant of the "flytrap family."
Audrey II is discovered by a nerdish
flower shop employee named
Seymour (Ken Wood). The public is
enthralled by Seymour's discovery,
and the nerd sees the plant as his
ticket to stardom and love.
But, of course, there is a catch.
Audrey ll's trap has an affinity for
something more substantial than flies.
Yes, the thing wants to eat Cleveland,
and everyone in it.
This leaves Seymour with a prob
lem: If he can get Audrey II food, he
can get out of Skid Row and have the
girl of this dreams — you guessed it
— Audrey I (Eydie Alyson). But who
should he choose to be the evil weed's
lunch?
No problem.
Audrey I has a boyfriend. Orin
(Ken Land) is a sadistic greaser who
moonlights as a girlfriend-beating
dentist. When Seymour pays Orin a
visit, ostensibly for a root canal, he
confronts Orin with a loaded pistol,
but cannot bring himself to pull the
trigger. Instead, he sits in the dentist's
chair, while Orin prepares the nitrous
oxide — for himself. (The
greaser/dentist likes to laugh his way
through surgery.)
The gas mask gets stuck on Orin's
head, and we watch along with
Seymour as Audrey ll's lunch laughs
and sings himself to death. This scene
is one of the show's funniest, and it
typifies- the macabre sense of humor
which makes "Little Shop of Hor

rors" a pleasure.
The show has some problems when
it strays from the grotesque, and
several scenes which draw laughs for
Audrey I's tacky — and Seymour's
tackier — taste. Audrey longs for a
house with a chain link fence and
plastic covered furniture. Seymour
wants taste like hers. These scenes
could have been funnier, had Alvson
played them with more passion for
the mundane. (She might have taken
a lesson from Cyndi Lauper). Instead,
her performance borders on
caricature.
The same can be said of Stan
Rubin, who plays Seymour's boss,
Mr. Mushnik. as a stereotypic Jewish
merchant.
By contrast. Ward plays Seymour
with enough sincerity that his lack of

couth is funny, while he avoids
making the character so real that he
would seem pathetic.
Land also gives a strong perfor
mance. He plays Orin's sadism with
hysterical vigor, and returns as
several minor and equally funny char
acters after the dentist is consumed.
The most charismatic performance
of the evening is given by a plant!
Ashman's audacity in making a
botanical monster the lead in a musi
cal is enough to start the audience
laugphing. The humor is sustained by
William Szymanski's clever
manipulations and Michael Leslie's
sinister voice track.
Alan Menken's music is 1960s
doo-wop of the type made famous by
groups like the Ronnettes, the Chrys
tals and the Chiffons. In fact, Louise

Robinson, Suzanne Douglas, and B.J.
Jefferson form a trio of narrating on
lookers, who evoke the memory of
each of these groups. The tunes fit
well into the show's melodramatic es
capist tone.
"Little Shop" is presented by Bay
Area producer Bill Graham. His pro
duction is handicapped by a weak
sound system which consists of four
small speakers suspended about 30
feet above the stage, but the
performers are usually able to
overcome this with their well-trained
voices.
So, if you're in the mood for a
delightfully silly evening, head up to
Skid Row, a.k.a. the Warfield
Theatre. The "unusual and interest
ing" Audrey II and company will be
there through Oct. 28.
