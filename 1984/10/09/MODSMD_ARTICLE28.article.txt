## 'Maltese Sangweech' — solid reporting 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE "The Maltese Sangweech Other Heroes" by Bill Cardoso Atheneum, 312 pp., $15. 95 
The 'lowdown' on the Ali-Foreman
fight in Zaire, on who runs the Rose
Bowl Parade, on the sicker side of
Evel Knievel and his Snake River
Canyon jump — this collection of Bill
Cardoso's best articles includes some
strange and intriguing stories. Hunter
Thompson credits Cardoso with in
spiring the name"Gonzo journalism"
for his own kind of writing, but the
similarities between Cardoso and the
Doctor are few; Cardoso's work is
much more like straight reporting
than Thompson's. But Cardoso does
cast a worldly-wise eye on the jour
nalist's effect on the story he covers
as he comments unobtrusively on
people's appetite for publicity.
Thompson's pieces, from "Fear
and Loathing in Las Vegas" to his last
book about Hawaii, "The Curse of
Lono," are all fired by his own
paranoia, and occupy themselves with
descriptions of imagined threats and
dangers. The attention given his sub
ject matter is minimal, and
Thompson's weird personality is the
intriguing center of his work. Car
doso's version of Gonzo journalism,
on the other hand, does not strike a
contemporary reader as very much
different from the best of the 'New'
journalism. Some of the pieces in this
collection — like one on Chinatown
gang wars — faithfully give 'facts' and
interpret them, supplementing an
otherwise standard format by adding
vividness of description and some
remarks on how the writer did his re
search.
These articles are strong work, but
the pieces on memorable pseudo

events prove more interesting,
though they don't always work as
well. Cardoso's article on the Ali-
Foreman fight in Zaire in 1974 at
tempts to inject a lot of his own expe
riences into a vague account of what
other reporters focused on. It
demands more familiarity with what
happened than most readers will
have, even if they followed events at
the time. Lacking that, one turns to
Cardoso's description of his experi

ences in Zaire and his reaction to
what he saw. Cardoso's observations
on dictatorship are those of a
reasonable man, but his stylistic tac
tics hinder them; he writes the article
as if he were having flashbacks to an
interrogation by Sese Mobutu's
goons. His personality and views are
not outrageous enough to provide in
terest by themselves, and however
much we sympathize with his out
look, his frequent appearance in the

story becomes tiring and intrusive.
It's much easier to enjoy Cardoso's
reactions to the cheap bullying of red
neck Evel Knievel, or his satiric view
of the Rose Bowl. In these articles, as
in the one on the fight in Zaire, Car
doso's topic is not so much a
genuinely newsworthy event, but the
media activity surrounding a pseudo
event created for and fueled by the
public's thirst for entertaining news.
Other articles in the collection also

tend to focus on issues created to an
swer the demand for news unrelated
to the public's concerns, the kind of
news that can be consumed as enter
tainment because it doesn't require
the public to reflect on its political or
ethical implications. Cardoso skill
fully suggests that even such material
is not devoid of social significance.
This makes Cardoso's descriptions
of the activity of the press more
'reasonable,' and means his work is

even less divergent from normal jour
nalism than at first appears — he's
still covering the facts, but they hap
pen to be about the news media. If
you're looking for anything like
Hunter Thompson's paranoid
nightmares in this book, you won't
find it, but if you're looking for solid
reporting with conscious attention to
the way events become news and
what happens to them as a result,
Cardoso's book is for you.
