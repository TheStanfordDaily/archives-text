# Korn to captain medical school
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
David Korn, longtime Stanford hospital ad
ministrator and researcher, has accepted the po
sition as dean of the Stanford University Medical
School.
The appointment of Korn, 51, chairman of the
pathology department since 1968, was an
nounced to the medical faculty yesterday by Vice
President for Medical Affairs Lawrence Crowley,
who headed the faculty search committee for the
new dean.
In a telephone interview, Korn said he is
excited about the prospect of assuming the medi
cal school's highest academic post at the dawn of
an "era of remarkable new understandings about
major categories of disease that have been poorly
understood and poorly handled."
Korn added that he foresees "great
breakthroughs over the next decade" as well as
"changes in the way society deals with health
care delivery."
The appointment is the focus of considerable
attention at the medical school not only because
of the importance of the post, but also because of
ongoing discussions in recent years among the
faculty as to the direction of the medical school .
The school has always placed considerable em
phasis on the basic science research of its faculty
and students and will continue to do so, school
officials say, but questions have been raised in
faculty discussions and in press coverage of the
school as to whether or not the research has been
overemphasized.
University President Donald Kennedy said last
week that "there have been some assertions im
plying that the basic research emphasis had led to
some imbalance to the detriment of patient care
and clinical programs." He refered specifically to
an article the San Jose Mercury News ran on
Sept. 18 entitled "Crisis of confidence at Stan
ford med school," which explored the problems
created by infighting among faculty members re
garding the direction of the school and by the
vacancies in four leadership posts at the medical
school, including the deanship and the chairman
ship of the department of medicine.
Kennedy has stated that among the criteria the
University was considering when evaluating can
didates for the dean's position were leadership
ability and "a strong grasp of the kinds of prob
lems faced by an institution like ours with
primarily a research emphasis but a need to
maintain strong clinical programs as well."
Of vital importance to the school, Kennedy
said, is a dean who can balance the basic research
and clinical objectives of the school.
Korn said he feels "honored by the vote of
confidence."
"I think it's going to be an exciting and chal
lenging period we're entering into," he said, call
ing the near future "an exciting time in the devel
opment of the biomedical sciences."
Korn concluded that in a time of so many ad
vances in medicine, "the future (of medicine)
looks very bright."
The new dean was named chairman of the Na
tional Cancer Advisory Board by President
Reagan last May and will serve on the board for
six years. The chairmanship is a two-year
renewable term. Korn is noted for his research in
biochemistry, his leadership in clinical programs

and his recruitment of some of the country's top
clinical pathologists and basic scientists.
His own research deals with enzymes involved
in DNA synthesis and replication.
Korn was the first choice of the search commit
tee, which has been working since June 22 to find
a successor to Dominick Purpura, who resigned
to become dean of Albert Einstein College ot
Medicine in New York.
Provost James Rosse said he and Kennedy fol
lowed the committee's recommendation because
Korn has "built an outstanding department of
pathology and has proved he knows how to be a
good leader in the Stanford context."

Rosse added that Korn has a "clear vision of
what a medical school can be" and praised him
for his service in a variety of capacities, including
his role as chairman this year of the aca
demic council's Committee on Research.
Korn also chairs the Faculty Practice Program,
was the first chairman of the medical school's
Faculty Budget Review Committee and was in
strumental in the development of the Stanford
University Blood Bank.
Korn graduated with honors from Harvard
Medical School in 1959 and completed his in
ternship and residency at Massachusetts Gen
eral Hospital. He worked as assistant pathologist
at the National Institute of Health in Maryland
before coming to Stanford in 1968.
The appointment is effective immediately, but
Korn said he will assume the duties of the post in
full only after a six-week transition period be
cause "I have a lot of commitments to people and
organizations that cannot just be turned on and
off."
Surgery Prof. John Wilson, who has served as
acting dean since Purpura left on Aug. 31, has
agreed to serve as deputy dean for the next three
months.

President for Medical Affairs Lawrence Crowley,
who headed the faculty search committee for the
new dean.
In a telephone interview, Korn said he is
excited about the prospect of assuming the medi
cal school's highest academic post at the dawn of
an "era of remarkable new understandings about
major categories of disease that have been poorly
understood and poorly handled."
Korn added that he foresees "great
breakthroughs over the next decade" as well as
"changes in the way society deals with health
care delivery."
The appointment is the focus of considerable
attention at the medical school not only because
of the importance of the post, but also because of
ongoing discussions in recent years among the
faculty as to the direction of the medical school .
The school has always placed considerable em
phasis on the basic science research of its faculty
and students and will continue to do so, school
officials say, but questions have been raised in
faculty discussions and in press coverage of the
school as to whether or not the research has been
overemphasized.
University President Donald Kennedy said last
week that "there have been some assertions im
plying that the basic research emphasis had led to
some imbalance to the detriment of patient care
and clinical programs." He refered specifically to
an article the San Jose Mercury News ran on
Sept. 18 entitled "Crisis of confidence at Stan
ford med school," which explored the problems
created by infighting among faculty members re
garding the direction of the school and by the
vacancies in four leadership posts at the medical
school, including the deanship and the chairman
ship of the department of medicine.
Kennedy has stated that among the criteria the
University was considering when evaluating can
didates for the dean's position were leadership
ability and "a strong grasp of the kinds of prob
lems faced by an institution like ours with
primarily a research emphasis but a need to
maintain strong clinical programs as well."
Of vital importance to the school, Kennedy
said, is a dean who can balance the basic research
and clinical objectives of the school.
Korn said he feels "honored by the vote of
confidence."
"I think it's going to be an exciting and chal
lenging period we're entering into," he said, call
ing the near future "an exciting time in the devel
opment of the biomedical sciences."
Korn concluded that in a time of so many ad
vances in medicine, "the future (of medicine)
looks very bright."
The new dean was named chairman of the Na
tional Cancer Advisory Board by President
Reagan last May and will serve on the board for
six years. The chairmanship is a two-year
renewable term. Korn is noted for his research in
biochemistry, his leadership in clinical programs

and his recruitment of some of the country's top
clinical pathologists and basic scientists.
His own research deals with enzymes involved
in DNA synthesis and replication.
Korn was the first choice of the search commit
tee, which has been working since June 22 to find
a successor to Dominick Purpura, who resigned
to become dean of Albert Einstein College ot
Medicine in New York.
Provost James Rosse said he and Kennedy fol
lowed the committee's recommendation because
Korn has "built an outstanding department of
pathology and has proved he knows how to be a
good leader in the Stanford context."

Rosse added that Korn has a "clear vision of
what a medical school can be" and praised him
for his service in a variety of capacities, including
his role as chairman this year of the aca
demic council's Committee on Research.
Korn also chairs the Faculty Practice Program,
was the first chairman of the medical school's
Faculty Budget Review Committee and was in
strumental in the development of the Stanford
University Blood Bank.
Korn graduated with honors from Harvard
Medical School in 1959 and completed his in
ternship and residency at Massachusetts Gen
eral Hospital. He worked as assistant pathologist
at the National Institute of Health in Maryland
before coming to Stanford in 1968.
The appointment is effective immediately, but
Korn said he will assume the duties of the post in
full only after a six-week transition period be
cause "I have a lot of commitments to people and
organizations that cannot just be turned on and
off."
Surgery Prof. John Wilson, who has served as
acting dean since Purpura left on Aug. 31, has
agreed to serve as deputy dean for the next three
months.
