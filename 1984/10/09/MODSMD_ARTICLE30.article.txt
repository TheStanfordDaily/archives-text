•Thieves stole 16 bicycles from unwary Stanford pedalpushers last
week, selecting from a smorgasbord of bikes locked and unlocked all
over the campus. Bikes stationed near Blackwelder, Crothers Memorial,
Florence Moore, Hulme (Escondido Village), Margaret Jacks Hall, La
Sacos Eating Club, Meyer Mall, Mirrielees, Sterling Quad, the Medical
Center and Theta Chi House disappeared, some with broken locks left
behind. The bicycle theft rate rose since the week of Sept. 24-Oct. 1,
when 10 owners reported their vehicles missing. Escondido Village com
muters lost the most bikes then.
• Burglars chose microwave ovens and flashlights as their targets of the
week. The electrical department in Governor's Corner and Whitman
House both reported missing microwaves, taken Oct. 2-3. During the
past week unknown persons broke into a car parked near Kingscoate
Gardens and one near Florence Moore to steal flashlights and other
small items. Campus residences remained intact, following two thefts of
jewelry in the 900 block of Lathrop Drive and on Pearce Mitchell Street
Sept. 27.
• Stanford campus police made three felony and 12 misdemeanor ar
rests. The police booked Brenda Kneass of Redwood City and Robert
Hume for possession of cocaine yesterday when they were stopped at
2:45 a.m. for driving a suspicious vehicle near Serra and Lausen Streets.
The arresting officer reported Kneass had "large quantities of narcotics"
and "package materials" in her car, while Hume had violated probation
and was also involved in a Monterey Police Department case. The police
took the pair to North County Jail.
The majority of the arrest offenses involved alcohol, with two charges
of being drunk in public and two of driving under the influence. The
police also served nine warrants during their arrests.
• Vandals struck in varying manners last week. An unknown party
pelted the long-suffering Gay Liberation statue by Lomita Mall with
fruit, leaving stains, according to the police report made Oct. 3. A stu
dent informed police Sunday that he had seen five white males urinating
on another student's car while they were standing on its hood and roof.
The car was parked near 638 Lomita Court.
