# Hart to visit; Mondale possible
## 
### JEANNE COOPER Staff writer 
Democratic presidential candidate
Walter Mondale may join Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) in a visit to
Stanford next Tuesday. According to
Michael Burns, Santa Clara County
coordinator for the Democratic
Party, Mondale's schedule is still
being set for next week, but "it's a
possibility" that he will accompany
former presidential hopeful Hart to
campus.
Hart will most likely speak in
White Plaza at noon, said Burns, but
the time may change if Mondale ap
pears with him. "We wont have the
final confirmation" until Wednesday,
said Burns, who works in the Demo
cratic Party's office in San Jose.
Burns said he does not expect Con
gresswoman Geraldine Ferraro (D-
N.Y.), Mondale's running mate, to
participate in Tuesday's rally. Ferraro
spoke in the San Jose area this sum
mer.
"We're really quite fortunate to
have had her here already. A lot of
counties across the country want to
see any candidate," Burns said.
According to Burns, Mondale may
pay this area its second visit in recent
months by a member of the Demo
cratic ticket due to the county's large
swing vote.
"People don't vote along party
lines here," he stated. "They look
more towards issues and the candi
dates personally. [The Stanford area]
is a place where people generally take

more time to make a decision on how
they'll vole."
Burns noted that the Democratic
campaign has heavily targeted this
area because "it's a very important
county in the whole Democratic
scheme of things."
The Stanford campus in particular
offers an ideal location for a cam
paign appearance. Burns said.
"You've got a two-county draw, since
San Mateo and Santa Clara people
can both go to campus, you can find a
crowd immediately, and it's an inter
national campus, known almost
worldwide. Like at Harvard, anything
that occurs on the Stanford campus
will probably be a good draw for the
major news networks."
Burns said that the area's strong
support of Hart in the primaries also
accounts for Tuesday's plans. "The
speech will be good for former Hart
supporters, to let them know Sen.
Hart is 100 percent behind Mr.
Mondale."
Appearances by the Democratic
Party's presidential ticket are a key
part of its overall campaign strategy.
"They bring people to rallies who
want to look closely at candidates and
evaluate them in person, they
energize our own group of people
who are working on the campaign,
and they bring a lot of good media,"
according to Burns.
"Ours is a low-budget campaign,
compared to the Republicans'
(campaign)," Burns said. "The main
thing for us is to get the issues out

there for people to evaluate; when
they do, we think they'll agree with
Mondale most of the time. This is an
area oriented to issues, like peace and
the environment, and an appearance
is a way to air them."

Burns said the Democratic cam
paign staff will work with campus
groups such as STAR (Students
Against Reaganism) and Students for
Mondale and Ferraro in organizing
next week's rally.
