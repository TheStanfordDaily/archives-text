# Political veterans look toward November
## Christopher zeros in on U.S. policies abroad 
### FRANK LESTER 
In a wide-ranging talk yesterday at Branner Hall, former
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher set forth a five
point agenda of "major initiatives in foreign policy" that he
said the next administration should pursue.
Christopher, who is best known for his role as the chief
negotiator for the United States during the 1979-81 Iranian
hostage crisis, said in a 15-minute speech that "for understand
able reasons, the president is not going to be taking any bold
initiatives" in foreign policy this coming month. That President
Reagan has used the advantage of his incumbency to set up
meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko,
Christopher said, is indicative that Reagan "has the situation
pretty much the way he wants it in the field of foreign affairs."
It will be after Election Day, Christopher said, that the new
administration, whether it is headed by Reagan or Walter
Mondale, will have to deal with five specific foreign policy
trouble spots "that have worried secretaries of state and presi
dents for a long time."
These trouble spots, he said, include the Soviet Union,
Central America, South Africa, and Western Europe, as well as
the "debt bomb" he sees as ticking in the backyards of several
underdeveloped nations. It is the solutions the next administra
tion proposes to these problem areas that will prove its strength
in foreign policy, Christopher said.
Christopher, who has been mentioned as a possible Cabinet
member of a Mondale administration, said he sees the negotia-

tions with the Soviet Union as the
foremost concern on the next admin
istration's foreign policy agenda. The
steps Reagan is taking are only pre
liminary, he added.
"The next step's getting some sort
of arms control agreement, which is
very tough," he said.
In Central American affairs, Chris
topher said that the two questions
which will most occupy the next ad
ministration will be whether to con
tinue indirectly funding Nicaraguan
rebels and whether to press Central
American regimes to make progress
in ending human rights violations.
He said that an underlying problem
preventing the current administration
from coming to terms with these
questions is its militaristic viewpoint.
"The Reagan administration," he
said, "sees the Central American
problem in terms of military solu
tions."
South Africa may become another

problem area for U.S. foreign
policymakers. "The growing insur
gency of blacks there," he said, "may
finally boil over" during the coming
year or so.
When specifically questioned about
the mounting crisis and its relation to
University investments in companies
there, Christopher said that, as a
member of the board of trustees, he
would base a decision to divest
Stanford-owned stocks in American
companies there on whether, in
hiring, these companies provided jobs
to blacks there as a "symbol" with
which to "rise above" the discrimina
tion South African companies
practice against them.
Another problem, according to
Christopher, is Western Europe's
lack of commitment to NATO. The
Carter administration pressed the
NATO countries to increase their
commitment to the alliance by 3 per
cent, in real terms, per year. But "the
European countries have fallen down
on that and really need to be called
on that," he said.
