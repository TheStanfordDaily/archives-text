The presidential campaign typifies how today's candidates
increasingly substitute shadow for substance and personality
for policy in trying to woo voters, author and consumer adv
ocate Ralph Nader told an overflow crowd in Kresge
Auditorium.
In an address on "The Importance of Election '84," Nader,
who first gained fame by exposing defects in a General Motors
car in his book "Unsafe at Any Speed," chided both campaigns
for emphasizing personality politics while neglecting important
issues.
"The personality of the president is overwhelming the ac
countability of the president for his government's policy," he
said.
This shift of campaign tactics, said Nader, tends to permit
candidates to ignore issues important to the American people.
According to Nader, one issue the present administration in
particular avoids is what he termed the president's
"information gap."
For instance, he cited the example of Reagan telling
reporters, on more than one occasion, that "missiles once
launched can always be recalled." In fact, nuclear missiles can
not be recalled after they are launched, Nader said.
Also absent from the campaign, according to Nader, have
been any questions about the issue of power in America. For
example, he noted the lack of discussion and debate on
strengthening the Bill of Rights, curbing corporate crime, fight
ing environmental pollution and halting the movement toward
business concentration.
