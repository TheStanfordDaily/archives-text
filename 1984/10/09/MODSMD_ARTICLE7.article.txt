Lear jet crashes in San Francisco
SAN FRANCISCO — A Lear jet crashed while taking off and ex
ploded in flames at San Francisco International Airport last night, killing
at least five people, authorities said.
"Apparently the tail end hit the runway, causing the explosion and the
dispersal of the aircraft over a half-mile radius," said Louis Turpen,
director of the airport.
The jet had a two-member crew and at least three passengers aboard,
said Ron Wilson, community affairs director for the airport. There were
no survivors, he said.
The flaming wreckage of the plane was hurled over a half-mile area,
and authorities closed the airport south of San Francisco for about an
hour after the crash.
The plane, which took off at 7:49 p.m., was en route to Van Nuys
when it crashed, said FAA controller Ed Lewis.
1 he crash occurred in the southwest part of the airport on runway 28
left. Conditions at the time were broken clouds at 800 feet, Wilson said.
At least three people got aboard the plane at Butler Aviation, which
handles private planes, Wilson said.
None of the victims was identified.
Duarte seeks unarmed meeting
UNITED NATIONS — Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Durate
told the U.N. General Assembly yesterday that he is willing to go
unarmed next Monday to a peace parley with guerrilla leaders seeking to
overthrow his government.
"I invite the chiefs of the guerrilla movement who are in the moun
tains to attend a meeting — without arms and in the presence of the
church leadership and the world press — at the village of La Palma, de
partment (province) of Chalatenango, at 10 o'clock in the morning on
Oct. 15." Duarte said, appealing for an end to the fighting.
At the same time, the Salvadoran leader expressed reservations about
the proposed Contadora treaty intended to bring peace to Central
America and called for stronger measures to verify compliance with the
pact.
At a news conference after his address to the assembly, Duarte
repeated previous pledges that he would never negotiate with his
country's insurgents with "guns on the table" but said he would guaran
tee their safety at La Palma if they went there without weapons.
"I'm putting my life behind that guarantee," he said. "If the president
of the republic goes without protection to a place where he could be am
bushed, that is evidence of faith. I am running this risk because I have
faith."
China announces market reforms
PEKING — In a major economic reform, China is planning to let
market forces play a dominant role in the production of more than half
of the nation's industrial goods, according to official news reports yesterday.
The reform will free all but the key industrial and farm goods from
rigid state production quotas that form the basis of a planned Marxist
economy. It is seen as a dramatic injection of capitalist tonic to enliven
output and to give China's centralized distribution system more
flexibility.
Factories and farms now gear their output to annual targets set by the
Communist regime, churning out products without clear market signals.
As a result, many goods are in short supply while many others rot in
huge stockpiles.
The new policy devised by the State Planning Commission will allow
certain enterprises to target production according to market demand or
general guidelines recommended by the state.
A front-page story in China Daily, the country's only English
language newspaper, said the reform will begin next year and will cover
60 of the 120 industrial goods and 19 of the 29 agricultural products for
which the state assigns annual production quota targets.
U.S. asks for end to nuclear pact
WASHINGTON — U.S. officials are pressing the Belgian govern
ment to reject a $1 billion nuclear cooperation agreement with Libya
that U.S. officials fear could help Libya learn to build nuclear weapons.
Belgian officials have said the Libyan offer, which is under considera
tion by the Belgian cabinet, calls for building nuclear-energy facilities in
Libya without providing militarily useful technology. U.S. and Belgian
officials said the Belgian economy is sufficiently weak for Brussels to be
tempted by the offer to the government-controlled firm of Bel
gonucleaire.
U.S. officials said they are skeptical of the motives of oil-rich Libya
and its leader. Col. Moammar Khadafy, in seeking nuclear technology.
Washington considers Khadafy unpredictable, lawless and a major
backer of terrorist activities outside his nation.
"First it's a civilian reactor, then it's a little reprocessing, and next
thing it's a bomb," a senior administration official said.
Peres warns against further cuts
WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres told Secre
tary of State George Shultz yesterday that his government has already
cut its budget as deeply as it can without inflicting severe damage on the
country's defenses.
Peres, in office just over three weeks, sought to convince the U.S. gov
ernment that the $1 billion cut in the $23 billion budget approved by his
Cabinet constitutes the sort of rigorous austerity package which Shultz,
an economist by profession, has prescribed as the only cure for Israel's
ruinous inflation. Some Israeli economists have said that spending must
be cut at least twice as deeply to have a chance of slowing the 400-
percent-a-year inflation rate.
Although Peres has said he does not plan to seek an increase in the
$2.6 billion U.S. aid package during this trip, there is little doubt that Is
rael will ask for additional help, maybe as much as an extra $ 1 billion, to
dig the economy out of its difficulties. U.S. officials have said that the
administration will be receptive to such a request if Israel first adopts a
belt-tightening program of its own.
Peres and Shultz met for two and a half hours, more than double the
scheduled time, shortly after Peres arrived in Washington. It is the Is
raeli prime minister's first official visit since taking office as the head of a
"government of national unity," which shares power between his Labor
Party and the right-wing Likud bloc headed by former Prime Minister,
and now Foreign Minister. Yitzhak Shamir. Shamir also attended the
meeting.
Peres and Shamir are scheduled to confer with President Reagan
today at the White House.
Iraq claims destruction of tankers
MANAMA, Bahrain — Iraq claimed hits on two large "naval targets"
in the Persian Gulf yesterday and a simultaneous independent report
said the 114,474-ton oil tanker World Knight was set ablaze in an air attack.
Six crewmen were killed and six more among a crew of 30 suffered cri
tical burns in the attack on the Liberian-registered World Knight, ac
cording to Lloyd's, the London-based insurer, in a report carried on
Bahrain radio here.
The tanker, which is owned by the Worldwide Shipping Company of
Hong Kong, had been under way unladen to the Iranian oil terminal on
Kharg Island at the time of the attack, the report said.
Rescue ships belonging to a Manama-based salvage company were on
the way to the burning ship after it sent out a distress call.
Stock prices retreat on holiday

week, slipped another 4.64 to 1,177.89.
Today's weather
