## 'Victory' gives Mondale lift 
### 
NEW YORK — Buoyed by what aides called a
"substantial victory" in his first presidential debate,
Walter Mondaie marched yesterday with running
mate Geraldine Ferraro past tens of thousands of
New Yorkers in this city's annual Columbus Day
parade.
A chanting and cheering crowd lined Fifth Ave
nue 10-deep in places and greeted the Democratic
candidates with balloons, signs, whistles and
shouts. It was a noisy contrast to the candidates'
last march through New York five weeks ago,
when, in the early morning on Labor Day, most
New Yorkers were still in bed and the avenue was
empty. But this time Mondaie and Ferraro stepped
off at noon.
Riding what aides called the rising crest of
Mondale's success in his debate Sunday night with
President Reagan, campaign chiefs james Johnson
and Robert Beckel tried to build on an impression
that Mondaie had bested the president badly. They
said a Mondaie poll, taken overnight, showed him
winning the debate 52 percent to 32 percent. The
aides predicted that Mondaie would start closing
the gap in preference polls within seven to 10 days.
At the same time, Mondaie surrogates, citing
Reagan's "hesitant" performance at the debate,
began raising his age, 73, as an issue. "He looked
old and acted old, and he is old," said Rep. Tony
Coehlo (D-Calif.), the chairman of the Democratic

Congressional Campaign Committee, who rode
with Mondaie on his campaign plane. Mondaie and
his aides, however, were reluctant to step up front
on the issue, a touchy one that could backfire.
At an enthusiastic rally in a Manhattan hotel fol
lowing the parade, Ferraro introduced the Demo
cratic standard bearer by shouting: "In this corner,
at a feisty 170 pounds, the new heavyweight
debater of the world. Fighting Fritz Mondaie!"
Mondaie told the crowd: "Today we have a
brand new race." In a clear reference to what he
saw as a difference the debate made, Mondaie
declared: "Today, everything is different. Millions
of Americans now know what's at stake — and that
it's a solid, decent future for America."
He said he wanted to ask a series of questions
about the debate.
"Who gave you straight talk?"
"Fritz!" the crowd shouted.
"Who talked about the future?"
"Fritz!"
"Who's going to win the election?"
"Fritz!"
While Mondaie still has a long way to go before
he can catch up with Reagan in the polls, Ferraro
has an early opportunity to build on Mondale's per
ceived success when she squares off against Vice
President George Bush in another televised debate
Thursday night.
Though any verdict on Sunday night's Reagan-

Mondale confrontation was bound to be somewhat
subjective, the preponderance of empirical
evidence seemed to be on Mondale's side. A Gal
lup poll conducted for Newsweek put Mondale
ahead by 54 percent to 39 percent, and a USA
Today poll showed him winning by 39 percent to
34 percent. Although an ABC News poll showed
Mondale in practically a dead heat, at 39 percent to
38 percent, opinion specialists contended that a
draw could be interpreted as a Mondale victory
since public expectations for his performance had
been lower than for Reagan.
What could only be guessed at so far was the im
pact of the debate on the presidential campaign,
where recent polls have shown Mondale trailing
Reagan by 20 points or so. American Enterprise
Institute fellow Norman Ornstein doubted that
Mondale's debate performance by itself would win
over committed Reagan supporters. But Ornstein
said the attention given to the debate could help
Mondale with undecided voters, now making up
roughly 15 percent of the electorate.
Earlier, Mondale and Ferraro joined the Colum
bus Day parade route at 43rd Street, near a wall
painted with graffiti reading, "Reagan lost."
People along the 29-block march reached out to
touch the candidates, and a number of them yelled:
"You won, Fritz. You won."

Institute fellow Norman Ornstein doubted that
Mondale's debate performance by itself would win
over committed Reagan supporters. But Ornstein
said the attention given to the debate could help
Mondale with undecided voters, now making up
roughly 15 percent of the electorate.
Earlier, Mondale and Ferraro joined the Colum
bus Day parade route at 43rd Street, near a wall
painted with graffiti reading, "Reagan lost."
People along the 29-block march reached out to
touch the candidates, and a number of them yelled:
"You won, Fritz. You won."
