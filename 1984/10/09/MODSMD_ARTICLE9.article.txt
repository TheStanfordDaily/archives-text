# Reagan tries to regain pace

BALTIMORE â€” President
Reagan struggled yesterday to regain
his campaign stride after a debate
that his strategists acknowledged
probably boosted the political
fortunes of Walter Mondale.
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.),
Reagan's general campaign chair
man, and James Baker 111, White
House chief of staff, said the presi
dent's closing statement Sunday night
was ineffective.
Reagan pollster Richard Wirthlin
said the president's 18 percentage
point lead could slip to 12 or 13
points by week's end.
Privately, there was near
consensus among Reagan campaign
advisers that Mondale had put the
president on the defensive in their na
tionally televised encounter in Louis

ville. Some strategists said Reagan,
often underestimated by his oppo
nents in the past, may have un
derrated Mondale and been over
confident.
One adviser also conceded that
Reagan may have appeared tired and
showed his 73 years during the
closing stretch of the 100-minute
debate, which ran 10 minutes over
schedule. But this was discounted by
others in the White House, especially
spokesman Larry Speakes, who left
before the debate ended to brief
reporters.
While there were no signs of panic
in the Reagan campaign, his advisers
acknowledged concern about the
president's performance at the close
of the debate and expressed worry
that press accounts giving Mondale

the victory would add to the damage.
Reagan tried to be upbeat. When
reporters asked his assessment as he
boarded Air Force One in Louisville,
he replied, "You're supposed to
make those decisions." As the ques
tions persisted, Reagan said, "I'm
smiling, I'm smiling" and gave the
thumbs-up sign as he disappeared
into the plane.
After he spoke yesterday in Bal
timore's "Little Italy" neighborhood
at the dedication of a statue of Chris
topher Columbus, Reagan was asked
whether he would prepare differently
for his second debate with Mondale.
"No, why?" he responded.
Nonetheless, the president
stumbled over phrases and statistics
several times earlier yesterday at an
open-air rally in Charlotte, N.C.,

where he was introduced by incum
bent Republican Sen. Jesse Helms,
who is in a close re-election contest
with Democratic Gov. James Hunt Jr.
In praising North Carolina, the
president was supposed to say, "You
cure tobacco, and we cure
economies." It came out, "You cure
tobacco, and I'm trying to cure eco
nomics."
Reagan's advisers, who mounted a
sophisticated effort to limit damage
from the debate, said they would not
know for several days whether the
event had cut Reagan's lead enough
to make Mondale competitive. Baker
said the debate "sharpened differ
ences" and, in doing so, may have
helped Reagan.
