The ASSU Senate voted overwhelmingly last night to
place a referendum on Stanford's investments in South

In other action, the senate allocated an additional $450
to fund the election and voted to exclude from the ballot a
constitutional amendment proposing to eliminate fee
assessment refunds.
Motorola "has behaved outrageously," according to
Senator Mark Landesmann, an author of the bill. The cor

to disclose whether additional sales to the military or
police have been made.
In addition, Motorola met only the most basic require

1982 and 1983. The Sullivan principles are designed to
promote racial equality in South Africa and are adhered
to by most foreign corporations operating in the country.
Stanford is the only major university in the country
without "specific criteria for selective divestiture," Lan
desmann said.
Senator Jon Adelstein, who co-authored the bill,
agreed. "It's an embarassment for me that the University
has done nothing," he said. "All we're looking for is social

Several senators pointed out that 50 percent of the
companies in which Stanford owns stock do some business
in South Africa.
