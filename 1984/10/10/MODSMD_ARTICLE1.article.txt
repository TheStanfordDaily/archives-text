# Apartheid measure on ASSU ballot
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted overwhelmingly last night to
place a referendum on Stanford's investments in South
Africa on the ballot of a special election later this month.
The South Africa resolution calls for the University to
sell its 8,000 shares of stock in Motorola Inc. and requests
the adoption of a responsible investment policy" toward
other companies operating in South Africa.
In other action, the senate allocated an additional $450
to fund the election and voted to exclude from the ballot a
constitutional amendment proposing to eliminate fee
assessment refunds.
Motorola "has behaved outrageously," according to
Senator Mark Landesmann, an author of the bill. The cor
poration sold "non-tactical" communications equipment
to the South African police in 1982 and has since refused
to disclose whether additional sales to the military or
police have been made.
In addition, Motorola met only the most basic require
ments of the Sullivan employment principles in 1981,
1982 and 1983. The Sullivan principles are designed to
promote racial equality in South Africa and are adhered
to by most foreign corporations operating in the country.
Stanford is the only major university in the country
without "specific criteria for selective divestiture," Lan
desmann said.
Senator Jon Adelstein, who co-authored the bill,
agreed. "It's an embarassment for me that the University
has done nothing," he said. "All we're looking for is social
and moral responsibility."
Several senators pointed out that 50 percent of the
companies in which Stanford owns stock do some business
in South Africa.
The special election, set for Oct. 30 and 31, was
originally scheduled to fill vacant graduate senate seats. In
addition to the South Africa resolution, the ballot now in
cludes a presidential referendum and eight proposed
amendments to the ASSU constitution.
In other business, the senate allocated an extra $400 to
fund four more pages for the ASSU election handbook.
The change stemmed from the addition of the South
Africa referendum and a resolution on the Committee of
Fifteen.
The senate also rejected a constitutional amendment
proposed by Senator Mark Soble which would have ended
fee assessment refunds.
Soble contended that coercing students to vote by only
giving fee refunds to those with an election receipt is
"ridiculous and unreasonable."
The Soble amendment met resistance from several
senators, as well as Council of Presidents member David
Porter. The current system does have its problems, Porter
said, but "instead of tinkering with the system when we
really don't have to, let's wait until we have to change it."
Early in the meeting, the senate confirmed the appoint
ment of an elections commissioner and the appointment
of Julie Petro as director of the ASSU Lobby Office.
