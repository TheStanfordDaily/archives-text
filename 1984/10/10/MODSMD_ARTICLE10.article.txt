# Reagan's age may be an issue
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The question
of whether Ronald Reagan is too old
to be president emerged yesterday as
an overt issue in his re-election cam
paign after a Sunday debate perfor
mance that even some of his aides
described as halting and ineffective.
Democrats, usually sensitive about
raising the issue, openly suggested
that Reagan, 73, was too old to serve
another four years. And a Reagan aid
commenting on the condition that he
not be identified said: "It's the one
issue that could change the course of
this campaign. We don't think it will,
but the potential is now there."
Polls taken for the Reagan cam
paign showed a three-point decline in
his lead over Democratic nominee
Walter Mondale since the debate,
campaign officials said. The latest
Reagan trackings put the president
ahead by a 53-to-39 percent margin.
Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced)
Chairman of the Democratic Con
gressional Campaign Committee, said

Reagan "looked old and acted old" in
his nationally televised encounter.
When Coelho was asked if the presi
dent acted doddering, he replied,
"Well, he didn't quite drool."
House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.), who is 71, said
Reagan "looked tired" in the debate
and that age was now a factor in the
race.
Top White House officials who
work with Reagan on a daily basis
scoffed at these claims. "It's
baloney," White House deputy chief
of staff Michael Deaver said.
"Some people tried to dredge it up
in 1976 and 1980," White House
chief of staff James Baker 111 said. "It
just won't wash. If you work with him
on a daily basis and see how vigorous
he is, you know that the statement
that he is too old to be president just
isn't the case."
Reagan, asked at a Rose Garden
ceremony whether age was a
legitimate issue, replied, "I'll chal

lenge him to an arm wrestle any
time," in apparent reference to
Mondale, 56.
Dr. Richard Greulich, scientific
director of the National Institute on
Aging, said Reagan is in
"extraordinarily good physical
shape" for his age.
"In general, his possible shortcom
ings, if there were any, during the
course of the debate were probably as
attributable to physical fatigue as to
any shortcomings of the mental
processes," Greulich said. "But when
people get physically tired they
become mentally tired as well."
The emergence of the age issue was
welcomed in the Mondale camp, ac
companied by a recognition that the
issue could backfire if pushed openly
by the Democrats. Asked whether
there was anything Mondale could do
to exploit the issue, senior adviser
John Reilly replied: "No. We won't
go near it — and we don't have to. It's
out there right now and people will

decide for themselves how big a fac
tor it is."
Stuart Spencer, the president's
senior political adviser, gave a similar
assessment and added: "The
Democrats are treading on dangerous
ground with the age issue, because
they're making a charge that can't be
backed up with the facts."
Reagan advisers agreed, however,
that the president's lackluster perfor
mance in the closing stages of the
debate had openly raised a question
that had been only an undercurrent
beforehand. They also agreed that
Reagan's appearance will be closely
scrutinized in campaign speeches anil
in his second debate with Mondale on
Oct. 21.
Throughout Reagan's political
career, his opponents have sought to
portray him as muddled and uncer
tain of his facts.
