## Cultural programming increased after criticism 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE 
In the wake of a University committee report criticizing
the role of ethnic theme houses, the staffs of Ujamaa
Okada and Casa Zapata are scheduling programs de
signed to increase cross-cultural education.
Resident assistants in these houses hope their plans will
help ensure the status of theme houses at Stanford a
future much in question after last year's controversy.
Last spring the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) issued a report which many felt threatened both
the structure and the existence of theme houses. The
report recommended that freshmen be excluded from
theme houses, stating that these houses deny freshmen the
unique experience provided by traditional dorms.
Although the heated debate that followed the commit
tee s report has died down, the controversy is still quietly
brewing.
Norm Robinson, dean of Residential Education, said
its impossible to tell whether ethnic theme houses will
be a major issue this year.

Robinson said the status of theme houses will be
clarified later this quarter when C-US releases a second
report on the topic.
He said he "hopes it's not" a big issue, adding, "I get a
little tired of the constant drumbeat about theme houses."
Robinson defines the role of ethnic theme houses as
providing "a place where students of the same ethnic
background can live together in large numbers." He said
the houses also offer a unique "cross-cultural experience"
to non-minorities.
According to Robinson, they can not serve that purpose
effectively while defending themselves and their right to
exist.
Gloria Johnson, an RA in Ujamaa, believes the theme
house issue will re-emerge because "Residential Educa
tion has a close watch on theme houses to evaluate if they
have a function, and if they're serving that function."
To show that Ujamaa does serve a function, Johnson
said the staff has planned "more dorm outreach, and
quality theme programs."

This quarter Ujamaa's theme is the black family; winter
quarter will focus on black politics; and spring's theme is
black entertainment.
Doreen Lee, an RA in Okada, said the emergence of
the theme house issue this year will depend on the upcom
ing C-US report.
"If they (the committee members) did something as
major as excluding freshmen from theme houses," or if
the committee again recommends relocating the houses,
the controversy would resurface, Lee said.
"Freshmen are absolutely vital to the house," she said.
Lee states that the Okada staffs "major concern is not
to show the whole University that we serve a purpose."
Instead, she said, we "aim to really help residents under
stand other cultures."
According to Lee, Okada's main goal this year is to
"develop a community" within the house, and to promote
"the theme of cultural diversity." On the calendar for
spring is Okada's annual Extravaganza, which Lee calls a
"big spring fair to celebrate East Asian and Asian-

American culture."
Zapata RA Gloria Rodriguez agrees that the future of
theme houses lies mainly with the C-US.
"We're waiting now to see what's going to happen,"
Rodriguez said. "We're not expecting the worst, but we're
not expecting the best either."
Among the programs designed to increase croSs
cultural education in Zapata is a two-unit course on
Chicano life taught by Zapata Resident Fellows Arturo
Pacheco and Susana Navarro. Zapata also sponsors a
noon lunch series focusing this quarter on "Chicanos in
the Political Process."
Robinson, Johnson, Lee and Rodriguez all agree that
there is a need to raise the image or perception of theme
houses on campus.
Robinson said students who don't live in these houses
need to be aware of "what life in them is like."
According to Johnson, there are a series of myths about
