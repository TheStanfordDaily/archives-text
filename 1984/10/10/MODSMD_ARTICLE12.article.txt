## The 						Stanford Daily Toward a World Culture 
### 
Stanford prides itself on the diversity of its stu
dent body and its reputation as an institution of
international reknown. But despite our claims of
world awareness and cross-culturalism, we make
no effort to teach "world culture."
Instead, we make mandatory an entire year of
*' Western Culture."
As it now stands, the Western Culture Program
has two glaring flaws. First, this program which
purports to study the shaping influences of the
Western world focuses (with one or two excep
tions) exclusively on the works of aristocratic,
European males.
This says to women and Third World students
that their culture and history are not important; it
is more important to spend an entire year study
ing the rich, white, European thinkers than to
study any women, Asians, Africans, Latin
Americans, Arabs or Native Americans.
If Stanford is going to recruit a diverse student
body, then it has an obligation to educate its stu
dents about one another. Neglecting to do so only
assists the formation of stereotypes and inter
cultural misunderstandings.
A second flaw of the current program is its per
petuation of the myth that the Western world
developed solely from European roots. By begin
ning with the Greeks and focusing exclusively on

Europe, the program gives the mistaken impres
sion that Western Culture developed in a
vacuum. In actuality, what we call the West
developed from the interactions among Asians,
Africans, Arabs, and Europeans. And American
society owes much to the additional influence of
Native Americans and the people of Latin
America.
Such a narrow, ethnocentric educational out
look fosters the ignorance and arrogrance from
which racism and sexism grow. Furthermore, the
implication that the Western world developed
culturally isolated is inaccurate and unbecoming
to a university of Stanford's stature. It is sad to
say that at one of the most prestigious universities
in the world, much of the student body is cul
turally illiterate.
Most of the people in the world are poor, non
white, and non-Christian. If we are going to live
together peaceably in this university, nation and
world, then we must first understand one an
other. The Western Culture Program fails to take
us in that direction
If Stanford is to live up to its claims and reputa
tion, then it must truly foster international and
inter-cultural understanding. A year-long World
Cultures Program, instead of just "Western" cul
ture, would be an excellent starting point.
