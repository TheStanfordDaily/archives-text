Are the president and Congress
>crflly serious about arms control?
What would happen if one of the
rflajor weapons systems currently
being developed or built — the MX
nissilc. Midgetman missile. Cruise
nissiles (air-, sea- and ground-

bargained away? What if the military
b ml get began shrinking instead of
gCowing ever greater?
'One immediate and painful result
would be that the several hundred
thousand people working on these
projects would likely lose their jobs.
lSu>ugh not often discussed in arms
control circles, this is a consequence
is not lost on military
efnployees. They are often reminded
by their employers of the connection
between their jobs and military con
tracts. As a result, they constitute a
massive lobbying force in support of
continued arms production, com
pletely unrelated to the issue of se
curity.
Much of the electronics industry of
Silicon Valley works on military
equipment. Prime military contracts
pay for more than 15 percent of all
manufacturing in Santa Clara
County. Cutbacks or a nuclear freeze
would have a large impact here and
might affect the $20 million prime
military contracts that Stanford pro
fessors receive each year for research.
A
J>erious arms control must include
provisions for minimizing the impact
oWrms treaties. For this reason. Rep.
I i?d Weiss (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Nic
hes Mavroules (D-Mass.) have pro
pcied legislation to ease conversion
ofrmilitary production plants and
thjir workforces to other types of
pijxluction when a military contract is
excelled. Weiss' bill is the more

comprehensive of the two, advocating
a complete system of federal support
for conversion planning. The Mav
roules bill includes more limited but
basic goals, such as one-year advance
notification of a contract cancellation,
community grants and job support.
The cost of these programs could be
paid for with 10 percent of the can
celled contract.
Opposition to these bills has cen
tered mostly on the planning aspects.
"Why not leave it all up to the free
market?" some ask. Military produc
tion is not conducted in a free market
at all. A free market must have a vari
ety of sellers and buyers, it must be
easy for the customer to switch from
one seller to another and there must
be good communication about the
products available and the going
price. In contrast, military production
is a very oligopolistic market. The
largest eight firms in each sector se
cure more than half of the value of
the contracts issued in that sector.
The top 100 contractors (out of
40,000) capture 75 percent of all
prime contract awards. Many con
tracts are bid on by only one firm.
Once a company has landed a re
search contract, it has a very strong
advantage over competitors for all
that follows: development, produc
tion and maintenance. With frequent
contact between a company and the
Pentagon (including the hiring of
retired military personnel by military
industry) there develops a strong
bond between the Pentagon and that
company leading to favored contract
ing.
Military procurement resembles a
centralized, state-run socialism more
than a free market. The Pentagon, as
the only customer, has thousands of
employees planning what weapons
should be developed and built. If
these bureaucrats make a mistake,
our tax dollars make up the differ
ence. We have very little control over
these Pentagon bureaucrats.
The Pentagon sometimes issues
contracts for an obscure technology if
that technology might eventually be

used in a weapon. When a company
has trouble meeting its contracts, the
Pentagon doesn't usually cancel the
contract and find another supplier.
Instead, it spends considerable effort
and money helping the contractor out
(producing large cost overruns in the
process). When a contract is can
celed, the company may be issued
further Pentagon development con
tracts with the rationale of keeping
the workforce intact and assembly
lines in place just in case the contract
is revived. This is what happened with
Rockwell International when the B-l
bomber was canceled in 1977 (until it
was refunded in 1981).
Military industry is unique in
having a very large workforce of
people with highly-specialized skills,
especially engineers and scientists. If
laid off, these workers cannot easily
shift to civilian industry. There fre
quently is no civilian equivalent to the
military job and if there is, the new
job probably requires a cost con
sciousness unknown to the military
employee. Dumping thousands of
these employees into the job market
at one time would cause severe prob
lems for them and for the whole U.S.
economy. The "free market" cannot
usually stand such severe fluctuations
(witness the glut of laid-off aerospace
engineers in 1971).
The government has bailed out
ailing military firms when the conse
quences for the workforce and the
economy would have been too great:
for example, Lockheed in 1971 and
Chrysler in 1980. Conversion legisla
tion would establish an orderly proce
dure for canceling military contracts
and retraining the employees for new
work. By planning for arms reduc
tion, the federal government would
indicate that it is serious about arms
control. The current emphasis on
planning for more production indi
cates that the government is only
really serious about prolonging the
arms race.
