## The 						rites of passage 
### 
I'm going to vote in the presidential election next
month. Rites of passage and all that stuff. For the first
time in my life 1 can add my voice to the collective general
will and help decide this country's fate. I've never felt so
useless.
Yeah. yeah. I know. Voting's not just a right; It's a
duty. Newspapers always say that. They have to. It's a law
or something. They won't let you have a paper if you don't
promise to say "Go vote" every election. And, they won't
let you complain about whoever's in power unless you
voted against him in the last election. So I'll vote. But it's
hard to get excited about it.
Oh, if I don't vote and Reagan wins I'll probably feel a
bit guilty. But I still can't see myself jogging to the voting
booth and pressing down the little Mondale lever with a
grand gesture, thinking, "Ha! Now Reagan's really had
it!" No one can tell me that the election will come out any
differently if I stay home and read a good existential
novel.
"Now, now, Tim," you say. "What would happen if
everyone stayed home and read a good existential novel?"
: vvell, in the words of one Captain Yossarian, then I'd
be a damned fool to do any differently. Besides, it would
be kind of funny if nobody voted. Then all the newspapers
would scold us. Why don't you all just move to some
unnamed Eastern Bloc country, they would say. That hap
pened at my high school, once.
I guess I just have the election blues. Campaigns tend to
make me feel small and powerless. It's a lot like watching
professional wrestling, I think. You can get all excited and
cheer on one contender as much as you want, but in the
back of your mind you always know that forces beyond
your control have already decided who's going to win. All
you can do is hope you're cheering for the right one.
I mean, back in 1976 everyone, even Republicans,
thought that Ronald Reagan was the biggest joke in the
world. "Oh that Ronny," we said. "Why would anyone
vote for him?"
What a silly man he was, spending all his time and
money going after something no one trusted him with â€”
power. He was "Saturday Night Live's" easiest subject;
just saying "Ronald Reagan is running for president" was
enough to get a good minute of laughter.
And what about old Walter Mondale? He was vice
president then, and we all thought he was probably the
most boring man in the world. "Gee," we all thought, "if
Jimmy Carter died, Walter Mondale would be president.
Wouldn't that be horrible? What would we do for fun?"
Who the hell was this man?
"Mondale??? What, he's the vice president? Well, I
never heard of him."
Now look where we are. Walter was the vice president.

"Fritz" is the Democratic nominee. They're two different
people. This Mondale is not only "tough" and "politically
smart," but he's "the Democrat with the best chance of
defeating Reagan."
Personally, I don't consider that much of a compliment,
but look at the 1984 model Reagan: This Reagan can
send thousands of American soldiers against six or seven
hundred Cuban construction workers on an island where
nobody even vacations and get praised for it. This Reagan
can jokingly announce to the public that he's started
bombing Russia and suffer nothing more than a week's
worth of token rebukes (come on, that one still scares
me).
What I want to know is: what happened? Both of these
guys were losers eight years ago. Did they change? Did all
their opponents die? Or is somebody writing American
history? I don't really mind if someone is setting us all up;
it's just that if this whole campaign is being scripted, I
think 1 could do a much better job.
Oh, I don't really go for this devious man-behind-the
scenes stuff, but sometimes, watching journalists and
newscasters bury their biases in a pile of objective bullshit,
its hard not to wonder if the same guy who writes the
president's speeches writes our news.
No, it's not planned. I don't think it's a plot. But the
forces that shape public opinion are nonetheless beyond
me and out of our control.
Political analysts predict what candidates are going to
say and do, and then the candidates read these analyses
and say, "Hey, that's a good idea, I wish I'd thought of it,"
and follow their advice. Exit polls predict who's going to
win, and people like me give up wasting our time and let
the winners win.
Maybe, if everyone suddenly decided to make up their
own minds and stood up at the same time and marched to
the polling places and gave the finger to the networks,
Time, Newsweek and speechwriters everywhere, things
would change. But I don't believe that's going to happen.
Not for a minute.
There s some consolation, I suppose, in having an ab
sentee ballot. At least if my vote doesn't make a differ
ence in the long run, I can hold off the official declaration
of a winner lor a little while by waiting until the very last
second to mail in my vote. Then everyone has to wait until
it gets to New York. That's something. Maybe I'll send it
postage due, with no return address, and really screw
things up. This thought pleases me, but it's a small reward
for the mind-boggling power this campaign has to make
me feel utterly meaningless.
