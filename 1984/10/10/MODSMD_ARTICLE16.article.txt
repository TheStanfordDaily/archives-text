Draw is fair
C£rol Watson's letter entitled
Di&rimination in the Draw Sys-
(The Daily, Oct. 3) contains
botlijact and opinion. It is important
thatjjhe former be accurate lest
otho-fs misunderstand how students
arc assigned to residences. I am
writing to clarify some of the asser
tionslmade in that letter.
Assignments by the spring housing
DrayC are not based solely on luck
bui rjither on a combination of the
following factors: guaranteed year
status, priorities, choices and draw
numjser. Each element is an impor
tant ;part of the final result and luck
play>no role except ascertaining the
nunrJSer itself.
Oft another point, students are not
auhrffiatically entitled to returning
resident priority. This priority can be
dairHj-'d once and only for a house in
which a student has lived after the
fresljman year. While this principle
some degree of continuity for
studtvhts, it does not serve to
preclude a great deal of movement
into-and out of all University
residences each year. In fact, in a
reccrtJ study of returning resident
priority the Committee on Services
to Sfndents-Residences (CoSS-R)
leaned that an average of 70 per
cent >112 each house system-wide each
scai*ls assigned to new residents.
Moreover, while the-impact of re
turnjug resident priority has been
limih£d considerably over the last few
years: the principle of continuity for

students and programs has been
supported and re-endorsed by stu
dent committees and administrators
reviewing this priority and making
recommendations about it.
In her letter, Watson also talks
about discrimination in housing
based on sex. The allocation of all
housing spaces (including residential
fraternity spaces) is based on the
actual enrollment of men and women
at Stanford. Therefore, women and
men are allocated spaces in the
housing system in the same propor
tion that they represent Stanford's
undergraduate population. This
means that Draw-assigned housing is
actually skewed to a higher
percentage for women to account for
the spaces for men in the fraternity
system.
With respect to the proposal in the
article for a class-based priority
system for housing, advisory commit
tees have consistently held that
preference based on class should be
avoided. Such a system would work
against the diversity of students from
different programs and majors that
cross class lines in each residence on
campus today. We are, however,
continuing to address the problem of
students who feel discouraged be
cause they do not receive assign
ments to their preferred choices. To
respond to the problem of students
who "draw" poorly and seem stuck
in the same residence or type of
residence for three years, CoSS-R
recommended last spring that stu
dents in guaranteed years "draw"

from lower (better) numbers than
those who are unguaranteed. To
increase the likelihood of assignment
to a preferred house in a guaranteed
year, this recommendation will be
implemented in the 1985 Draw.
It is important to note that the
facade of a house or the facility itself
is not meant to be the only consider
ation when evaluating a specific
residence. Rather the quality of life,
the sense of community, the social
and educational program, the rich
ness of the diversity among the resi
dents and the friends with whom one
associates are important considera
tions. Some of the most vital
residences with the liveliest commu
nity and strongest educational aca
demic and social programming op
portunities are those deemed by

some to be the least attractive
facility-wise ("the dungeons" in
Watson's words). The converse can
also be true of the "castles" in any
given year.
We realize that the Draw and the
whole issue of housing are very
important. Using a theme for the
actual Draw is an attempt to make
interesting and enjoyable a process
that by itself can be quite drab. By
calling it a "not so trivial pursuit" we
hoped to make the Draw itself fun
without trivializing it. I am sorry that
Carol Watson did not appreciate our
attempt to lighten the assignment
process.
