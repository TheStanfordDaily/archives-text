Be ye thankful for the many ways ye are blessed, oh
Cardinal.
Remember your sisters and brothers on other
campuses who are living through football season in
misery.
And excuse those misguided souls at Northwestern
University who, having finally won a football game,
allowed their worldly desires to overcome them and
descended into a "goalpost-ripping frenzy," as the
Daily Northwestern described it.
Some students and administrators at the university
were not very forgiving.

Two students were arrested for roughing up security
men who were trying to save the marauding crowd
from sin.
The editorial board of the campus newspaper took a
rather high-browed approach to the affair. "Tearing
down the goalpost showed a lack of pride in NU's
much improved football team," the board members
said.
Wins aren't rare around here, and we should take
them in stride, seemed to be the official opinion.
Never mind that this was Northwestern's first win in
its last eight games. Never mind that NU's victim was
Indiana, a team that has yet to win a game this year.
Northwestern holds the NCAA Division I record for
most consecutive losses — 34. Give them a win and
they think they're heaven's team.
"If NU students seem so amazed when we win, those
outside the university will also feel that any victory is a
minor miracle," wrote the editorial board.
The university's Department of Public Safety evi
dently agreed that the win was not a "minor miracle."
The department announced that it would have an im
proved security plan by the next home game on Oct. 6
— in case heaven's team won again.
But not to worry. The "much improved football
team" saved the pagans from repeating their sins. The
University of lowa beat Northwestern into penance by
a score of 31-3.
