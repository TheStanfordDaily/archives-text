After Cal lost to San Jose State 33-18, head coach
Joe Kapp was quoted by the Daily Californian as

The Californian went on. The paper analyzed why
Cal's fans deserted the stands en masse in the course of

football and an imitation."
Let's hope that the Cardinal keeps playing real col
lege football while Cal plays around.
