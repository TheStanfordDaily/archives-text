# Ivy League Trash trouble
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL 
This column does not usually deal in articles taken
directly from other college newspapers. Instead, I
select interesting articles, collect a few more facts, mix
in a little analysis and then write a special version of

the events that take place on other campuses.
But the following letter to the editor, run by the
Daily Princetonian in its Sept. 19 issue, could be
severely damaged by my hand, so here it is in full.
To the Chairman:
We the undersigned are exercising our constitutional
right to feeedom of speech because we have been
denied our constitutional right to have garbage.
This injustice came to light this morning, when our
janitor informed us that our university-supplied,
American-made, all-natural, 100 percent pure zinc
plated aluminium trash receptacle had been removed
from our hallway. Without our garbage can, we were
left holding the bag, so to speak.
However, a phone call to one Mr. Sweeney of Build
ing Services revealed that all such trash cans have been
removed from this part of campus for fire safety
reasons, since one of these dangerous devices was
recently found aflame in a nearby dorm. And perhaps
more importantly, as Mr. Sweeny pointed out, "These
trash cans are untidy."
Golly gee, Beave!
He also suggested that the seven members of our
suite should each place his own personal wastepaper
basket in the hallway for janitorial removal. We are

confused, since this process creates seven fire hazards,
a 600 percent increase. By Mr. Sweeney's reasoning,
perhaps it would even be safer if all 4,500 students on
campus placed his or her personal wastepaper basket
in a central location each morning, such as on Cannon
Green. This would reduce the number of potential fire
hazards to one.
In any event, we are demanding that the folks down
at Building Services return our trash cans ... or at least
get us dates for Saturday night.

Teetotaler T
The Midwest seethes with both immorality and
morality.
Earlier in this column we spoke of the lack of morals
displayed by Northwestern students. Now, from the
University of Michigan, we hear of students who have
no choice but to be moral.
An all-male residence hall, one Gomberg House,
held a contest to select a design for Gomberg's dorm
T-shirt.
The winning T-shirt featured a man with a keg under
one arm and a beer mug in the other hand tilting his
head back and saying "Gomberg . . . Ahhh!!" The
shirt's backside displayed a Budweiser label with
"Gomberg" on it.
However, before the T-shirts could be produced, the
South Quad building director banned the shirt, saying
that it "flaunted irresponsible use of alcohol."

The building director is a strong supporter of the
reforms the university has made in its drinking policies,
reports the Michigan Daily. Those reforms prohibit the
use of hall funds to buy alcohol, restrict all alcohol to
dorm rooms and prohibit references to alcohol in ad
vertisements for parties.
A newsletter from the "Gomberg Underground" at
tacked the censorship but Gomberg would not be in
timidated.
"So you thought you all left your mothers at home,"
it said. "Fear not. . . Mary Antieau (the building direc
tor) has decided to become our moral guardian."
Finally, a compromise was worked out. Several stu
dents met with Building Director Antieau and decided
to reconsider the design.
Gomberg elected to replace the keg with a football,
but Antieau left the final decision up to them. "We
could've put the keg there," said Gomberg resident
Tony Primak, "but the design looks better than it did
in the first place."
