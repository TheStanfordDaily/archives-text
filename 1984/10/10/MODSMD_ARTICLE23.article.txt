## Hamrdla speaks well of life on the Farm 
### KEN McCLAIN 
In a community rich with world
renowned scholars, scientists and
policy-makers, many less influential
hut equally engaging figures escape
the public eye. They may work in non
newsworthy milieus, they may be in
the shadow of their peers' fame or they
may avoid the limelight by choice.
The aim of "Into the Light," a bi
weekly column, is introducing these
people to the community, exploring
their impact on Stanford life, discover
ing their ideas, interests and anecdotes,
and illustrating the rich diversity of ex
perience on and around campus.
The subjects in this column are cho
sen for their commitment to University
affairs, their interesting roles in the
community, their provocativ& ideas,
and their heretofore low profile on
campus.
If Stanford were to ever introduce
its own version of the American Ex
press card, it might consider this ad
vertisement:
"Do you know me? I teach
Freshman English, I advise under
graduates, I serve on University com
mittees, I've directed several
Stanford programs, have been a resi
dent fellow, and I'm President Ken
nedy's assistant.
"That's why I carry one of these,
the Stanford Express Card. Don't
leave your dorm without it."
"G. R-O-B-E-R-T H-A-M-R-D
-1 -A."
What makes Hamrdla a good can
didate for this ad?
Beginning in 1955, when he
entered Stanford as a freshman,
Hamrdla has involved himself with
University affairs. For six years he
was an RA. For two years he was an
RF. For 12 years he has taught Fresh

man English. He has directed the
Stanford program in Germany and
the Academic Information Center.
And for the last seven years he has
been the assistant to the president.
In the last capacity, Hamrdla coor
dinates the logistics of the board of
trustees meetings, acts as a liaison be
tween University President Donald
Kennedy and such organizations as
the Office of Development and the
Alumni Association. And he often
receives people the president is too
busy to see.
A complete list of Hamrdla's re
sponsibilities and activities, in fact,
would humble most people. Yet he is
the humble one, serving the Univer
sity for its ends rather than his own.
You've been at Stanford for about
29 years. What keeps you going here?
Well, sometimes I wonder about
that myself. All of us feel that if we
stay in one place too long we
stagnate. You have to balance that
against what it is that you want and
what it is that you can get. First of all,
I think Stanford is an absolutely
world-class place. I would like to do
whatever it is that I can do to keep it
there and make it better.
Second of all, it's no secret that an
awful lot of people want to work
here, because of the area. The Bay
Area is an awfully nice place. I'm not
immune to such human desires.
Third of all, I have a lot of experi
ence here, and often, the more you
have the more you want to use it.
Is there anything that could pull
you away?
Sure. Money.
You would move on if an offer you
couldn't refuse came up?
Oh sure. The issue, however, is
what constitutes an offer I couldn't

refuse. This is a purely hypothetical
example: If the University of Min
nesota called me up and offered me
$ 15(),()()() for the same job, I don't
know if I would take it.
How much influence do you have in
major decisions around here?
That's a good question, and it's
really hard to say sometimes. There
are a lot of issues I feel very strongly
about, but whatever influence I have
is not the kind of influence where I
can go to President Kennedy's side
and say, "Do this, don't do that." Ob
viously, if he asks me what I think
about a certain issue I'll tell him.
Whatever influence I have is directly
proportional to the amount of
credibility I've been able to establish
on my own merit. I guess I don't want
to come out either in private or in
print saying "I have a lot of influ
ence." Let's put it this way: I don't
think I don't have any influence.
You graduated in 1960 in mathema
tics, and later returned to get a
master's in history. That seems like a
strange transition.
Not only seems like it, it is. In fact,
my entire academic life is strange.
One of the reasons I enjoy advising is
that I wish I'd had an advisor. My real
interest was foreign languages. But to
make a long story short, I wasn't sure
what I wanted to do, nobody really
told me it was better to major in
something I liked, engineers were in
high demand, I was committed to
graduating in five years because of
ROTC, and when I returned from
overseas in Germany I figured out
that the only thing I could complete
enough units for was math.
And after obtaining a history
degree, you went into university ad
ministration.

That was total chance. This job that
I have now is the first job that I ever
applied for. Everything else came out
of the blue or fell out of the heavens
at an appropriate time.
You were an RF in Larkin between
1978 and 1980. How did you like that?
Oh I loved it. I knew — this is very
funny — I knew that I would be an
RF someday, just as I knew I would
be an RA, and I was. I loved it, and I
have considered reapplying. I left it
after two years for the same reason
that it's better to leave a party when
it's still good.

How about Germany? You went to
school there, you were director of ad
ministration there, and you teach a
Freshman English course on East
Germany. How did your interest in
Germany arise?
That was another fluke. On my way
back from some lab, I saw a sign on
the registrar's door which read "Last
day to apply for Stanford in Ger
many, Group II." I had half an hour.
The thought had never crossed my
mind. Although I had an interest in
Europe, I had never had a day of
German in my life. Well, to make a

long story short, I went, with one
quarter of German. It was really in
awakening. If I hadn't walked by Jhat
window I wouldn't be here today.
You're interested in aviation, com
mercial as well as private.
The second thing in my life that has
fascinated me is airlines. It's another
of those things that's hard to pinpoint
why. Why is it that I can sit down .and
truly enjoy two hours reading airline
schedules? You know, what do
people think? I mean, that's crazy.

Robert Hamrdla entered Stanford as a freshman in 1955 and hasn't left since. For the last seven
years he has served as the assistant to University President Donald Kennedy.
But I love it. I can tell you, for example, which airlines fly
DC-9s. That's something no person in their right mind
would do.
What have been your best experiences here?
I think probably advising and teaching and being a RF
and a RA, all of which fall into one big lump, because you
see people grow, and that's fun. Especially fun is seeing
their knowledge and abilities increase and having the
leeling that somehow you've had something to do with
that. And it's fun to look at people and watch the light
bulb go on when they understand something. I think
anyone who works in a university and has some student
contact feels that way.
Vny experiences that you would say were your "worst"?
I don't think so. I really can't think of anything that was
such a disaster that it springs immediately to mind.
\re there any people that you especially admire?
I've always had incredible admiration for people who
were active in the anti-Nazi movement in Germany. I
have an interesting view about that — at least I think it's
interesting. I know a fair amount about World War 11, and
I am very irritated when somebody tells me that "Well. I
would never have been a Nazi." I don't think you can say
that. I think that, for example, anyone who was a young
Hflult in Germany would have been very susceptible, and
piobably / would have been very susceptible, because of
What the conditions were. I don't take any of this holier
than-thou stuff.
Can you tell me what makes Bob Hamrdla tick?
Ha! That's a real hard question. I'm like everyone else:
I have a certain amount of ego motivation, ego gratifica
tion. A certain desire to excel. I think anybody who goes
to Stanford has a certain amount of competitiveness. I
think I have a pretty strong sense of straightforwardness
and directness. Maybe that isn't what makes me tick but
it's certainly one of my characteristics. 1 am, for reasons
that have always been unclear to me, at least somewhat of
a perfectionist, and that leads to a weakness. It's a
strength when I do things well, but it's a weakness when I
get very frustrated when I'm not able to have the time to
do things the way I'd like to. I think I'm motivated by en

joying relationships with a very large variety of people,
from alums to students to faculty to staff. I'm motivated
for reasons that are also unclear to me to direct things and
to lead things. I love to motivate people, I love to see
people working together to do something.
In closing, is there any advice that you'd like to give to
students?
Sure, I've got lots of free advice (laughs). Wow, that is
so hard — I've got 10 things to say. Let me put it this way:
One of the things that I would most like to say is that we
always need to remember that people are very much the
same, despite their acknowledged differences. Everybody
has strengths, everybody has weaknessess, regardless of
who they are, and that we need to take those into account,
and be humble and be patient.

vertisement:
"Do you know me? I teach
Freshman English, I advise under
graduates, I serve on University com
mittees, I've directed several
Stanford programs, have been a resi
dent fellow, and I'm President Ken
nedy's assistant.
"That's why I carry one of these,
the Stanford Express Card. Don't
leave your dorm without it."
"G. R-O-B-E-R-T H-A-M-R-D

What makes Hamrdla a good can
didate for this ad?
Beginning in 1955, when he
entered Stanford as a freshman,
Hamrdla has involved himself with
University affairs. For six years he
was an RA. For two years he was an
RF. For 12 years he has taught Fresh

man English. He has directed the
Stanford program in Germany and
the Academic Information Center.
And for the last seven years he has
been the assistant to the president.
In the last capacity, Hamrdla coor
dinates the logistics of the board of
trustees meetings, acts as a liaison be
tween University President Donald
Kennedy and such organizations as
the Office of Development and the
Alumni Association. And he often
receives people the president is too
busy to see.
A complete list of Hamrdla's re
sponsibilities and activities, in fact,
would humble most people. Yet he is
the humble one, serving the Univer
sity for its ends rather than his own.
You've been at Stanford for about
29 years. What keeps you going here?
Well, sometimes I wonder about
that myself. All of us feel that if we
stay in one place too long we
stagnate. You have to balance that
against what it is that you want and
what it is that you can get. First of all,
I think Stanford is an absolutely
world-class place. I would like to do
whatever it is that I can do to keep it
there and make it better.
Second of all, it's no secret that an
awful lot of people want to work
here, because of the area. The Bay
Area is an awfully nice place. I'm not
immune to such human desires.
Third of all, I have a lot of experi
ence here, and often, the more you
have the more you want to use it.
Is there anything that could pull
you away?
Sure. Money.
You would move on if an offer you
couldn't refuse came up?
Oh sure. The issue, however, is
what constitutes an offer I couldn't

refuse. This is a purely hypothetical
example: If the University of Min
nesota called me up and offered me
$ 15(),()()() for the same job, I don't
know if I would take it.
How much influence do you have in
major decisions around here?
That's a good question, and it's
really hard to say sometimes. There
are a lot of issues I feel very strongly
about, but whatever influence I have
is not the kind of influence where I
can go to President Kennedy's side
and say, "Do this, don't do that." Ob
viously, if he asks me what I think
about a certain issue I'll tell him.
Whatever influence I have is directly
proportional to the amount of
credibility I've been able to establish
on my own merit. I guess I don't want
to come out either in private or in
print saying "I have a lot of influ
ence." Let's put it this way: I don't
think I don't have any influence.
You graduated in 1960 in mathema
tics, and later returned to get a
master's in history. That seems like a
strange transition.
Not only seems like it, it is. In fact,
my entire academic life is strange.
One of the reasons I enjoy advising is
that I wish I'd had an advisor. My real
interest was foreign languages. But to
make a long story short, I wasn't sure
what I wanted to do, nobody really
told me it was better to major in
something I liked, engineers were in
high demand, I was committed to
graduating in five years because of
ROTC, and when I returned from
overseas in Germany I figured out
that the only thing I could complete
enough units for was math.
And after obtaining a history
degree, you went into university ad
ministration.

That was total chance. This job that
I have now is the first job that I ever
applied for. Everything else came out
of the blue or fell out of the heavens
at an appropriate time.
You were an RF in Larkin between
1978 and 1980. How did you like that?
Oh I loved it. I knew — this is very
funny — I knew that I would be an
RF someday, just as I knew I would
be an RA, and I was. I loved it, and I
have considered reapplying. I left it
after two years for the same reason
that it's better to leave a party when
it's still good.

How about Germany? You went to
school there, you were director of ad
ministration there, and you teach a
Freshman English course on East
Germany. How did your interest in
Germany arise?
That was another fluke. On my way
back from some lab, I saw a sign on
the registrar's door which read "Last
day to apply for Stanford in Ger
many, Group II." I had half an hour.
The thought had never crossed my
mind. Although I had an interest in
Europe, I had never had a day of
German in my life. Well, to make a

long story short, I went, with one
quarter of German. It was really in
awakening. If I hadn't walked by Jhat
window I wouldn't be here today.
You're interested in aviation, com
mercial as well as private.
The second thing in my life that has
fascinated me is airlines. It's another
of those things that's hard to pinpoint
why. Why is it that I can sit down .and
truly enjoy two hours reading airline
schedules? You know, what do
people think? I mean, that's crazy.


Rod Searcey/D^ly
Robert Hamrdla entered Stanford as a freshman in 1955 and hasn't left since. For the last seven
years he has served as the assistant to University President Donald Kennedy.
But I love it. I can tell you, for example, which airlines fly
DC-9s. That's something no person in their right mind
would do.
What have been your best experiences here?
I think probably advising and teaching and being a RF
and a RA, all of which fall into one big lump, because you
see people grow, and that's fun. Especially fun is seeing
their knowledge and abilities increase and having the
leeling that somehow you've had something to do with
that. And it's fun to look at people and watch the light
bulb go on when they understand something. I think
anyone who works in a university and has some student
contact feels that way.
Vny experiences that you would say were your "worst"?
I don't think so. I really can't think of anything that was
such a disaster that it springs immediately to mind.
\re there any people that you especially admire?
I've always had incredible admiration for people who
were active in the anti-Nazi movement in Germany. I
have an interesting view about that — at least I think it's
interesting. I know a fair amount about World War 11, and
I am very irritated when somebody tells me that "Well. I
would never have been a Nazi." I don't think you can say
that. I think that, for example, anyone who was a young
Hflult in Germany would have been very susceptible, and
piobably / would have been very susceptible, because of
What the conditions were. I don't take any of this holier
than-thou stuff.
Can you tell me what makes Bob Hamrdla tick?
Ha! That's a real hard question. I'm like everyone else:
I have a certain amount of ego motivation, ego gratifica
tion. A certain desire to excel. I think anybody who goes
to Stanford has a certain amount of competitiveness. I
think I have a pretty strong sense of straightforwardness
and directness. Maybe that isn't what makes me tick but
it's certainly one of my characteristics. 1 am, for reasons
that have always been unclear to me, at least somewhat of
a perfectionist, and that leads to a weakness. It's a
strength when I do things well, but it's a weakness when I
get very frustrated when I'm not able to have the time to
do things the way I'd like to. I think I'm motivated by en

joying relationships with a very large variety of people,
from alums to students to faculty to staff. I'm motivated
for reasons that are also unclear to me to direct things and
to lead things. I love to motivate people, I love to see
people working together to do something.
In closing, is there any advice that you'd like to give to
students?
Sure, I've got lots of free advice (laughs). Wow, that is
so hard — I've got 10 things to say. Let me put it this way:
One of the things that I would most like to say is that we
always need to remember that people are very much the
same, despite their acknowledged differences. Everybody
has strengths, everybody has weaknessess, regardless of
who they are, and that we need to take those into account,
and be humble and be patient.

Stanford program in Germany and
the Academic Information Center.
And for the last seven years he has
been the assistant to the president.
In the last capacity, Hamrdla coor
dinates the logistics of the board of
trustees meetings, acts as a liaison be
tween University President Donald
Kennedy and such organizations as
the Office of Development and the
Alumni Association. And he often
receives people the president is too
busy to see.
A complete list of Hamrdla's re
sponsibilities and activities, in fact,
would humble most people. Yet he is
the humble one, serving the Univer
sity for its ends rather than his own.
You've been at Stanford for about
29 years. What keeps you going here?
Well, sometimes I wonder about
that myself. All of us feel that if we
stay in one place too long we
stagnate. You have to balance that
against what it is that you want and
what it is that you can get. First of all,
I think Stanford is an absolutely
world-class place. I would like to do
whatever it is that I can do to keep it
there and make it better.
Second of all, it's no secret that an
awful lot of people want to work
here, because of the area. The Bay
Area is an awfully nice place. I'm not
immune to such human desires.
Third of all, I have a lot of experi
ence here, and often, the more you
have the more you want to use it.
Is there anything that could pull
you away?
Sure. Money.
You would move on if an offer you
couldn't refuse came up?
Oh sure. The issue, however, is
what constitutes an offer I couldn't

refuse. This is a purely hypothetical
example: If the University of Min
nesota called me up and offered me
$ 15(),()()() for the same job, I don't
know if I would take it.
How much influence do you have in
major decisions around here?
That's a good question, and it's
really hard to say sometimes. There
are a lot of issues I feel very strongly
about, but whatever influence I have
is not the kind of influence where I
can go to President Kennedy's side
and say, "Do this, don't do that." Ob
viously, if he asks me what I think
about a certain issue I'll tell him.
Whatever influence I have is directly
proportional to the amount of
credibility I've been able to establish
on my own merit. I guess I don't want
to come out either in private or in
print saying "I have a lot of influ
ence." Let's put it this way: I don't
think I don't have any influence.
You graduated in 1960 in mathema
tics, and later returned to get a
master's in history. That seems like a
strange transition.
Not only seems like it, it is. In fact,
my entire academic life is strange.
One of the reasons I enjoy advising is
that I wish I'd had an advisor. My real
interest was foreign languages. But to
make a long story short, I wasn't sure
what I wanted to do, nobody really
told me it was better to major in
something I liked, engineers were in
high demand, I was committed to
graduating in five years because of
ROTC, and when I returned from
overseas in Germany I figured out
that the only thing I could complete
enough units for was math.
And after obtaining a history
degree, you went into university ad
ministration.

That was total chance. This job that
I have now is the first job that I ever
applied for. Everything else came out
of the blue or fell out of the heavens
at an appropriate time.
You were an RF in Larkin between
1978 and 1980. How did you like that?
Oh I loved it. I knew — this is very
funny — I knew that I would be an
RF someday, just as I knew I would
be an RA, and I was. I loved it, and I
have considered reapplying. I left it
after two years for the same reason
that it's better to leave a party when
it's still good.

How about Germany? You went to
school there, you were director of ad
ministration there, and you teach a
Freshman English course on East
Germany. How did your interest in
Germany arise?
That was another fluke. On my way
back from some lab, I saw a sign on
the registrar's door which read "Last
day to apply for Stanford in Ger
many, Group II." I had half an hour.
The thought had never crossed my
mind. Although I had an interest in
Europe, I had never had a day of
German in my life. Well, to make a

long story short, I went, with one
quarter of German. It was really in
awakening. If I hadn't walked by Jhat
window I wouldn't be here today.
You're interested in aviation, com
mercial as well as private.
The second thing in my life that has
fascinated me is airlines. It's another
of those things that's hard to pinpoint
why. Why is it that I can sit down .and
truly enjoy two hours reading airline
schedules? You know, what do
people think? I mean, that's crazy.

Robert Hamrdla entered Stanford as a freshman in 1955 and hasn't left since. For the last seven
years he has served as the assistant to University President Donald Kennedy.
But I love it. I can tell you, for example, which airlines fly
DC-9s. That's something no person in their right mind
would do.
What have been your best experiences here?
I think probably advising and teaching and being a RF
and a RA, all of which fall into one big lump, because you
see people grow, and that's fun. Especially fun is seeing
their knowledge and abilities increase and having the
leeling that somehow you've had something to do with
that. And it's fun to look at people and watch the light
bulb go on when they understand something. I think
anyone who works in a university and has some student
contact feels that way.
Vny experiences that you would say were your "worst"?
I don't think so. I really can't think of anything that was
such a disaster that it springs immediately to mind.
\re there any people that you especially admire?
I've always had incredible admiration for people who
were active in the anti-Nazi movement in Germany. I
have an interesting view about that — at least I think it's
interesting. I know a fair amount about World War 11, and
I am very irritated when somebody tells me that "Well. I
would never have been a Nazi." I don't think you can say
that. I think that, for example, anyone who was a young
Hflult in Germany would have been very susceptible, and
piobably / would have been very susceptible, because of
What the conditions were. I don't take any of this holier
than-thou stuff.
Can you tell me what makes Bob Hamrdla tick?
Ha! That's a real hard question. I'm like everyone else:
I have a certain amount of ego motivation, ego gratifica
tion. A certain desire to excel. I think anybody who goes
to Stanford has a certain amount of competitiveness. I
think I have a pretty strong sense of straightforwardness
and directness. Maybe that isn't what makes me tick but
it's certainly one of my characteristics. 1 am, for reasons
that have always been unclear to me, at least somewhat of
a perfectionist, and that leads to a weakness. It's a
strength when I do things well, but it's a weakness when I
get very frustrated when I'm not able to have the time to
do things the way I'd like to. I think I'm motivated by en

joying relationships with a very large variety of people,
from alums to students to faculty to staff. I'm motivated
for reasons that are also unclear to me to direct things and
to lead things. I love to motivate people, I love to see
people working together to do something.
In closing, is there any advice that you'd like to give to
students?
Sure, I've got lots of free advice (laughs). Wow, that is
so hard — I've got 10 things to say. Let me put it this way:
One of the things that I would most like to say is that we
always need to remember that people are very much the
same, despite their acknowledged differences. Everybody
has strengths, everybody has weaknessess, regardless of
who they are, and that we need to take those into account,
and be humble and be patient.


G. Robert Hamrdla
In a community rich with world
renowned scholars, scientists and
policy-makers, many less influential
hut equally engaging figures escape
the public eye. They may work in non
newsworthy milieus, they may be in
the shadow of their peers' fame or they
may avoid the limelight by choice.
The aim of "Into the Light," a bi
weekly column, is introducing these
people to the community, exploring
their impact on Stanford life, discover
ing their ideas, interests and anecdotes,
and illustrating the rich diversity of ex
perience on and around campus.
The subjects in this column are cho
sen for their commitment to University
affairs, their interesting roles in the
community, their provocativ& ideas,
and their heretofore low profile on
campus.
If Stanford were to ever introduce
its own version of the American Ex
press card, it might consider this ad
vertisement:
"Do you know me? I teach
Freshman English, I advise under
graduates, I serve on University com
mittees, I've directed several
Stanford programs, have been a resi
dent fellow, and I'm President Ken
nedy's assistant.
"That's why I carry one of these,
the Stanford Express Card. Don't
leave your dorm without it."
"G. R-O-B-E-R-T H-A-M-R-D
-1 -A."
What makes Hamrdla a good can
didate for this ad?
Beginning in 1955, when he
entered Stanford as a freshman,
Hamrdla has involved himself with
University affairs. For six years he
was an RA. For two years he was an
RF. For 12 years he has taught Fresh

man English. He has directed the
Stanford program in Germany and
the Academic Information Center.
And for the last seven years he has
been the assistant to the president.
