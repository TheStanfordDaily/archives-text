# Fake IDs pose serious risk
## 
### SCOTT GARNER 
Former Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon tried to assemble a
school of students who, among
other things, have the ability to
make the most of their situations,
and some of the pre-21 group on
the Farm have had little difficulty
making the most theirs via fake
identification.
Ficticious ID cards have become
so abundant of late they may soon
outnumber meal cards around
campus. Perhaps this is due in part
to the ease with which a student can
obtain one.
One freshman here purchased his
fake ID card from a friend for only
$13.
"The card consisted of stenciled
letters placed over the actual infor

mation on my driver's license. The
card was then laminated to make it
look and feel like the real thing,"
he said.
Everything was going great for
this student — until he found him
self cruising at 52 mph in a 35 niph
zone, with a police car on his tail.
"While 1 was still pulling over, I
grabbed my license from my wallet
and started scratching off the
lamination from it. When my car
was finally stopped, 1 could still feel
that the card was sticky, so I rubbed
frantically until the officer ap
proached my car. 1 don't think he
noticed anything strange."
This student didn't realize at the
time just how lucky he was not to
be caught. According to Robert
Harpainter, senior deputy district

attorney in Palo Alto, if someone
between the ages of 18 and 21 is
caught using a fake ID, he can he
cited for as much as $ 1,000 or six
months in jail. Even if the judge is a
Stanford alumnus, with all the com
passion in the world for the guilty
party, he must still enforce a $200
minimum fine, as the crime is a mis
demeanor.
Recently, police officials in the
area have made an effort to more
strictly enforce the laws regarding
alcohol, according to Chris Lef
ferts, school resource officer for the
Palo Alto Police Department. This
is partially a result of strong public
reaction to the fatal automobile
accident of a Palo Alto teen two
years ago. The crash was alcohol
related.
