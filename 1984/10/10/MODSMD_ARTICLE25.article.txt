## Cardinal defeated in 5 sets 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON 
A "frustrated" Stanford women's
volleyball team lost a five-game, non
conference match to the University of
Pacific last night before an estimated
crowd of 3,000.
UOP defeated the Cardinal, 8-15,
5-15, 15-2, 15-12, 15-11. UOP is
now 13-3 overall, and Stanford is 6-2
overall and 3-2 in the Western Col
legiate Athletic Association confer
ence. Stanford had won the last four
matches against UOP, and had not
lost to the Tigers since Sept. 19,
1982. UOP is ranked fifth in the na
tion this week by the Collegiate Vol
leyball Coaches Association poll. The
Cardinal is ranked No. 2.
A disappointed Cardinal Asst.
Coach Don Shaw said, "We cleaned
them (UOP) up in games one and
two, but we didn't come ready to play
in the third game." The Cardinal lost
its composure in the third game,
Shaw said, and lost some game mo
mentum as UOP and the crowd came
alive.
"We got frustrated with the UOP
defense," Shaw said. "I've never seen
so many one-handed digs. It was the
best exhibition of a scrambling
defense I've seen."
According to Shaw, the Tigers' de
fensive pressure caused an abundance
of unforced errors by Stanford. "We
didn't pass the ball well at all. We
mishandled a lot of point-scoring op
portunities. Our ball handling errors
really cost us," he said.
In the third game, defensive plays
excited the "big, vocal" Tiger crowd,
Shaw said, and the Cardinal was
thrown off balance for the remainder
of the match.
