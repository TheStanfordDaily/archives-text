# Muster lets his stats do all of his talking
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Sophomore fullback Brad
Muster is a simple kind of guy. He
answers questions in one or two
lines and then shuts up. It's not that
he doesn't enjoy talking, it's just
that he stops when he's said
enough.
He's laid back, too.
"Occasionally with my brothers (he
has three), I may have a squabble
or two," Muster said. "But I pretty
much take things as they come.
"I'm not one to jump up and
down and get really razzed before a
game. I'm just not like that. I just
try to think of what I have to do and
then go out and do it."
Muster, excuse the pun, cut the
muster last Saturday in Stanford's
23-21 victory over UCLA. Linger
ing injuries to Brian Morris and
Kaulana Park — the two fullbacks
ahead of Muster on the preseason
depth chart — gave Muster the
starting job by default, although
Muster's statistics might indicate
otherwise.
Muster carried the ball 24 times
for 82 yards and one touchdown.
He was thrown for a loss once and
his longest gain was 10 yards.
There's a word for that in football
— workhorse.
"I knew for sure [that I'd start]
about four o'clock, when (Running
Back) Coach (Jimmy) Walsh told
me just before we were going out
on the field," Muster recalled.
"And I said, 'OK.' "
His 82 rushing yards against
UCLA made Muster, from San
Marin High School in Novato, the

Cardinal's third-leading rusher this
season. He has 123 yards on 32
carries (a 3.8 yards-per-carry
average) and has caught seven
passes for 22 yards.
While most Stanford fans were
hearing Muster's name over the
loudspeaker Saturday for the first
time (he made brief appearances
against San Jose State and Arizona
State), Cardinal Coach Jack Elway
was smiling a smile of the"I told
you so" variety. Elway has been
showering Muster with compli
ments ever since his first press con

fere nee.
"Brad was injured this spring,
and we were contemplating where
to play him," said Elway, who said
Muster played running back and
defensive back in high school.
"He's an outstanding athlete. He's
6-4. He runs somewhere between a
4.5 and 4.6 (-second) 40 (-yard
dash)."
Indeed, Muster is tall, big (205
pounds) and fast. But it gets bet
ter. He is a sophomore and, since


(ill Gilbert/Daily
he was redshirted last season, has
three years of eligibility remaining
after this year.
He's got great speed and good
instincts," Walsh said. "But I've
really been impressed with Brad's
ability to improve the areas that
need improvement. He's only 19.
And the frightenine thing is that
he's 205 pounds and still gaining. I
don't want to label him or any
thing, but he'll be a No. 1 pick (in
the professional draft)."
But asking Muster, a probable

economics major, about his future
is like asking an ex-con about his
past. He hedges.
"1 guess when this is all over I
may coach," said Muster, whose
father and three brothers coach
football in the Bay Area. "But I
don't think too much about the
future."
The quiet, unassuming Muster
answers other questions just as
simply, and occasionally tosses in a
pinch of innocent humor. Asked if
he has any sisters. Muster said,
"No, but I got a dog."
How about a nickname?
Muster smiles, flashing his
dimples, and says, "Just Brad."
