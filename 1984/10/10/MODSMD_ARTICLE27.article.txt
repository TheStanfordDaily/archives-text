SAN DIEGO (AP) â€” The Detroit
Tigers won a battle of baseball's old
and new last night, using a two-run
homer from Larry Herndon and
clutch pitching from Jack Morris to
beat the San Diego Padres, 3-2, in the
first game of the 1984 World Series.
The tense game that lasted more
than three hours was marked by
questionable baserunning and
managerial decisions by the Padres,
who were playing in the World Series
for the first time in their 16-year his
tory. .
The Tigers, who appeared in their
first World Series in 1907, trailed, 2-
1, when Herndon hit a two-run
homer in the fifth inning off Mark
Thurmond. Thurmond, a lefthander,
had struggled while relievers Dave
Dravecky and Andy Hawkins were
ready to pitch.
Thurmond threw 117 pitches in
five innings before being relieved by
Hawkins, who pitched two and two
thirds innings of one-hit, shutout
relief, and Dravecky pitched the rest
of the game without giving up a hit.
The Tigers thus put the Padres in a
familiar position. San Diego trailed in
every National League Champion
ship Series game and lost the first two
before winning three in a row at
home against Chicago. The Tigers
swept Kansas City in three to win the
American League pennant.
Game Two of the Series is sched
uled for San Diego tonight. Detroit's
Dan Petry and San Diego's Ed Whit
son are expected to be the starting
pitchers.
Morris, who pitched a no-hitter on
April 7 and ended this season with a
19-11 record, struck out three straight
batters after giving up consecutive
singles to start the sixth inning.
He escaped trouble in the seventh

inning with the help of Padre
baserunning mistakes. Kurt Bevac
qua led off with a drive into the right
field corner, but was thrown out on a
relay from outfielder Kirk Gibson to
second baseman Lou Whitaker when
he tried to stretch a double into a
triple. With two out, Tony Gwynn
singled, but was thrown out trying to
steal second by catcher Lance Parrish
on a pitchout.
Morris gave up eight hits, walked
three and struck out nine, including
six in the last four innings. He gave up
both San Diego runs in the first in
ning on a two-run double by Terry
Kennedy, giving the Padres their 2-1
lead. The Tigers had scored in the
first on an RBI-single by Alan Tram
mell.
