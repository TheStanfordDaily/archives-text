### DARREN THORNEYCROFT staff sports writer 
The Cardinal men's soccer team will try to im
prove its Pacific Soccer Conference record today
when it plays St. Mary's College at Stanford's
Maloney Field at 3 p.m.
Stanford, 5-4-3 overall and 1-1 in PSC play, goes
into the game with some bumps and bruises after a
tough weekend in which the Cardinal played
second-ranked UCLA and the undefeated Univer
sity of Washington.
Stanford Head Coach Sam Koch's injury report
includes midfielders Mike Mossmer and Brian
Mahaffey, who will not play today, and midfielder
Patrick Sheehy and fullback Charlie Crane, who

will both play despite sore legs. Crane injured his
right thigh in Saturday's 2-2 tie with UCLA.
St. Mary's is 1-5-2, prompting Koch to say sar
castically, "They're a powerhouse." But Koch went
on to say that although St. Mary's has traditionally
not been very good, "they did tie Hayward State,
and they have improved. They're not as tough as
UCLA, but they should give us a run for our
money."
St. Mary's has had problems offensively, scoring
four goals in its first eight games while allowing 16.
St. Mary's last game was a 4-0 loss to Santa Clara
which dropped it into a tie for last place with Uni
versity of the Pacific in the PSC.
On Sunday night, the Cardinal lost, 4-2, to the

University of Washington, which won the Pacific
10 Tournament in Livermore. The Huskies
defeated the University of California at Berkeley
Friday before heating Stanford.
Senior Fred Ueland and junior Dave Daniels,
both midfielders, scored Stanford's goals against
Washington.
Koch said he was pleased with the play ol his
team this weekend despite the loss to the Huskies.
"It was a great team effort, and some of the players
played outstanding games all at once, Koch said.
"Paul Bronson and Jim Cole played well, and Willy
Burkhardt had a super game in goal against
UCLA."
