# Kennedy approves chapel

A proposed "interfaith chapel," which
will serve as a sanctuary to Jewish and
other religious groups, has been approved
by University President Donald Kennedy,
according to Robert Hamerton-Kelly,
dean of the chapel.
The building is to be situated at an an
gle between Memorial Church and Build
ing 50 of the Inner Quad, Hamerton-Kelly
said, and will serve as a worship site for
those groups that find the surroundings of
the church inappropriate for their prayer.
"The overwhelming Christian sym
bolism and iconography (in Memorial
Church) is a problem for Jews and Mor
mons," Hamerton-Kelly said. "The chapel
will be useful in a wide range of interfaith
activities."
While Hamerton-Kelly said he has
recognized the need for an alternate wor
ship center since his arrival at Stanford 11
years ago, he is quick to point out that the
planning for the chapel is in its very early
stages.

"The University will not authorize each
step without money, and as we raise
money, the project will progress," he said.
There has been approximately $50,000
raised from two individuals, he said, and
with that money Hamerton-Kelly hopes to

initiate the project. After consultations
with the board of trustees and the Univer
sity project manager, he expects to launch
a nation-wide architecture competition,
probably sometime within the next six
weeks.
Although the new chapel will be among
many structurally similiar buildings in the
Inner Quad, Hamerton-Kelly does not
want it to be "just another building."
"I hope for a modern architectural state
ment that expresses our time and genera
tion," he said. "A great artist can achieve
genuine originality and can blend with the
existing buildings."
Hammerton-Kelly predicts that the
building will cost in the millions of dollars,
but he remains highly optimistic about
raising the necessary funds.
"It seems to be a project whose time has
come," he said. "That's why I'm as am
bitious as I am."
While the chapel — which Hamerton-
Kelly envisions seating approximately 200
people — will be available for religious ac

tivity and worship by numerous groups, he
sees the greatest need coming from the
Jewish community, especially from the
Jewish umbrel'a organization Hillel.
"It will assure the Jewish community a
weekly place for worship," he said. "I see
it as a recognition of Jewish religion and
people as part of the mainstream of the
University."
Currently, Hillel conducts its weekly
Friday night services in the Clubhouse, a
building which Rabbi Ari Mark Cartun,
Hillel Foundation executive director, says
is the "backwater of the University."
"It's not nice at all," Cartun said in ref
erence to the poor lighting, space and
maintenance at the facility.
Cartun, like Hamerton-Kelly, is very
optimistic about the impact of a new
chapel.
"This symbolizes the moving of Judaism
from the periphery to the center of
campus."
"The time is right with reference to the
Jewish community," Hamerton-Kellv said.
