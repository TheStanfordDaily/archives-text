## 'Big U.' fanciful but without real plot 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE Daily staff 
"The Big U."
by Neal Stephenson
Vintage, 308 pp. $4.50 trade
paperback
It is April, near the end of second
semester at Neal Stephenson's imagi
nary American Megauniversity. The
scene is the Plex, a building three
blocks on a side, with administrative
and teaching units in a nine-story
base and eight 25-story dormitories
perched on top. Crammed inside with
no way out, 40,000 students and a
correspondingly huge faculty and

henson does score some hits in his
exaggerated depiction of dormitory
life as high school without adult su
pervision, but his fondness for the im
possibly bizarre and for arcane-yet
trendy ideas (e.g. Jaynes) often leads
him astray.
The novel is broken into two
semesters, each subdivided into
months. In the first semester, we are
introduced to the main cast of charac
ters and groups in this artifical soci
ety, and relationships among them
are set up. There is not, however, any
real plot development. The novel
doesn't seem to be headed anywhere

What will hold a reader through this
first part of the novel, and for the
fast-moving second half as well, is
Stephenson's skill at fanciful descrip
tion.

staff are locked in a fierce civil war
pitting rowdies, radicals and 100-
pound rats against each other and
some even stranger factions in an
armed struggle with few clear goals.
On a mission of mercy, a group of our
heroes sets out across the Plex. Dan
ger Excitement Exclamation points.
The group sets out: "Sarah stayed be
hind reading 'The Origin of Con
sciousness in the Breakdown of the
Bicameral Mind.' "
Maybe Sarah has had too much hy
perbole by now. Maybe she's not in
terested in grotesque exaggeration,
wild fantasy, and constant trumps of
outrageousness. Readers sharing her
tastes should also stay at home and
avoid Neal Stephenson's first novel.
Who knows, maybe by reading Julian
Jaynes' controversial theories they,
like her, may begin to fathom the
Plex and the plot. There's certainly
plenty of breakdown in "The Big U,"
but it can produce unconciousness as
easily as consciousness. Sometimes
being hit over the head does that to
you.
Stephenson's novel thrives on
baroque complexity and overstate
ment, powered by ever-increasing
doses of the preposterous. Both its
apparent lack of coherence, hiding an
intricate network of connections, and
its wide-ranging references to arcane
subjects from philosophy and tech
nology remind me of Thomas
Pynchon's work. Its satire recalls
Joseph Heller's "Catch-22." Step

in particular until the second semes
ter begins. Then, various conspiracies
are uncovered in an environment of
increasing violence and chaos.
Stephenson's main character is
Casimir Radon, a physics genius who
has scrimped and saved to make it to
American Megauniversity. The novel
is intended to center on his disap
pointment and eventual involvement
— on the good side — in the schemes

and conspiracies that flower in the
second semester. We meet most of
the other characters through him, but
they are often introduced by the nar
rator, and only later fitted into
Casimir's story. This supporting cast
frequently proves more interesting
than Casimir, since they are even
weirder than he and are also in touch
with the bizarre secrets of the Plex.
Casimir's story gets lost, and he fails
to capture the reader's attention or
sympathies long enough for his expe

riences to provide a framework for
the novel.
What will hold a reader through
this first part of the novel, and for the
fast-moving second half as well, is
Stephenson's skill at fanciful descrip
tion. Starting with a kernel of typical
college experience, like stereo battles
or Dungeons and Dragons cultists, he
elaborates beyond the absurd. This
technique can become boring, if you
find the starting points' material uni
nteresting, but sometimes the trick
keeps you reading just to see how far
Stephenson's imagination can take
him.
Stephenson more than fulfills such
expectations, constantly raising the
stakes of absurdity. Instead of a plot,
he has given us a scheme, into which
characters fit like parts of a machine.
The way the story is told and the
characters subordinated to it mimic
the effect of the Plex on its in
habitants. Both the plot and the Plex
tend to depersonalize individuals;
both are almost impossibly confusing
to get around in; and both are full of
surprises. Reading the first half of the
book is like setting up a Mousetrap
game or some Rube Goldberg con
traption; in the second half you start
the thing and watch it run.
Despite these weaknesses, "The
Big U" succeeds, displaying its au
thor's fine talents for constructing in
tricate networks of interests and
threats, and for exaggerating some of
the weirder realities of university life.
Don't look to "The Big U" for partic
ularly insightful observations on life

the preposterous.

at the monster universities, at least
insofar as they are educational insti
tutions. The brief remarks on classes
are obvious and simplistic. What
"The Big U" w\ll do is entertain you
and keep you turning the pages, even

of incredulity and dismay. Stephen
son has got the number on some clas
sic types from dorms and student
politics, and he exaggerates them aiyi
ties them into knots as scary as
paranoia can make.

riences to provide a framework for
the novel.
What will hold a reader through
this first part of the novel, and for the
fast-moving second half as well, is
Stephenson's skill at fanciful descrip
tion. Starting with a kernel of typical
college experience, like stereo battles
or Dungeons and Dragons cultists, he
elaborates beyond the absurd. This
technique can become boring, if you
find the starting points' material uni
nteresting, but sometimes the trick
keeps you reading just to see how far
Stephenson's imagination can take
him.
Stephenson more than fulfills such
expectations, constantly raising the
stakes of absurdity. Instead of a plot,
he has given us a scheme, into which
characters fit like parts of a machine.
The way the story is told and the
characters subordinated to it mimic
the effect of the Plex on its in
habitants. Both the plot and the Plex
tend to depersonalize individuals;
both are almost impossibly confusing
to get around in; and both are full of
surprises. Reading the first half of the
book is like setting up a Mousetrap
game or some Rube Goldberg con
traption; in the second half you start
the thing and watch it run.
Despite these weaknesses, "The
Big U" succeeds, displaying its au
thor's fine talents for constructing in
tricate networks of interests and
threats, and for exaggerating some of
the weirder realities of university life.

"The Big U."
by Neal Stephenson
Vintage, 308 pp. $4.50 trade
paperback
It is April, near the end of second
semester at Neal Stephenson's imagi
nary American Megauniversity. The
scene is the Plex, a building three
blocks on a side, with administrative
and teaching units in a nine-story
base and eight 25-story dormitories
perched on top. Crammed inside with
no way out, 40,000 students and a
correspondingly huge faculty and

henson does score some hits in his
exaggerated depiction of dormitory
life as high school without adult su
pervision, but his fondness for the im
possibly bizarre and for arcane-yet
trendy ideas (e.g. Jaynes) often leads
him astray.
The novel is broken into two
semesters, each subdivided into
months. In the first semester, we are
introduced to the main cast of charac
ters and groups in this artifical soci
ety, and relationships among them
are set up. There is not, however, any
real plot development. The novel
doesn't seem to be headed anywhere

tion.

staff are locked in a fierce civil war
pitting rowdies, radicals and 100-
pound rats against each other and
some even stranger factions in an
armed struggle with few clear goals.
On a mission of mercy, a group of our
heroes sets out across the Plex. Dan
ger Excitement Exclamation points.
The group sets out: "Sarah stayed be
hind reading 'The Origin of Con
sciousness in the Breakdown of the
Bicameral Mind.' "
Maybe Sarah has had too much hy
perbole by now. Maybe she's not in
terested in grotesque exaggeration,
wild fantasy, and constant trumps of
outrageousness. Readers sharing her
tastes should also stay at home and
avoid Neal Stephenson's first novel.
Who knows, maybe by reading Julian
Jaynes' controversial theories they,
like her, may begin to fathom the
Plex and the plot. There's certainly
plenty of breakdown in "The Big U,"
but it can produce unconciousness as
easily as consciousness. Sometimes
being hit over the head does that to
you.
Stephenson's novel thrives on
baroque complexity and overstate
ment, powered by ever-increasing
doses of the preposterous. Both its
apparent lack of coherence, hiding an
intricate network of connections, and
its wide-ranging references to arcane
subjects from philosophy and tech
nology remind me of Thomas
Pynchon's work. Its satire recalls
Joseph Heller's "Catch-22." Step

in particular until the second semes
ter begins. Then, various conspiracies
are uncovered in an environment of
increasing violence and chaos.
Stephenson's main character is
Casimir Radon, a physics genius who
has scrimped and saved to make it to
American Megauniversity. The novel
is intended to center on his disap
pointment and eventual involvement
— on the good side — in the schemes

and conspiracies that flower in the
second semester. We meet most of
the other characters through him, but
they are often introduced by the nar
rator, and only later fitted into
Casimir's story. This supporting cast
frequently proves more interesting
than Casimir, since they are even
weirder than he and are also in touch
with the bizarre secrets of the Plex.
Casimir's story gets lost, and he fails
to capture the reader's attention or
sympathies long enough for his expe

riences to provide a framework for
the novel.
