Faculty members call on Zschau, Carnoy
Sixty-three members of the Stanford faculty
have asked the two main 12th Congressional
District candidates for their pledge to severely
limit the circumstances in which they would
send U.S. troops to El Salvador or Nicaragua.
Republican Congressman Ed Zschau and his
Democratic opponent, Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy, were asked Sept. 17 to pledge their op
position to the use of such troops unless: 1) the
Congress has declared war or specifically au
thorized deployment, or 2) such deployment is
"necessary to meet a clear and present danger
of hostile attack upon the U.S., its territories, or
possessions, to protect the U.S. embassy; or to
protect or evacuate U.S. personnel or U.S.
citizens."
Carnoy committed himself to the pledge Sept.
21. Zschau is still studying its implications, ac
cording to Bob Wixer, the congressman's Wash
ington administrative assistant.
Hoover fellow nominated to Science Board
President Reagan has announced his inten
tion to nominate Annelise Graebner Anderson,
a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, to be a member of the National Science
Board of the National Science Foundation. Her
term will expire in 1990.
Anderson, an economist, received her doc
torate in business administration from Colum
bia University in 1974. She was a senior policy
adviser for the 1980 Reagan presidential cam
paign and associate director for economic af
fairs for the Office of the President-Elect.
From 1981 to 1983, she was associate direc
tor for economics and government in the Office
of Management and Budget.

Toxoplasmosis treatable in AIDS patients
At least one common and potentially lethal
disease afflicting patients with Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome is controllable
with medication while researchers continue to
hunt down clues to the underlying ailment, a
neurosurgeon said Friday.
Frances Conley, associate professor of
neurosurgery here, said that central nervous
system toxoplasmosis is reaching epidemic pro
portions among AIDS patients.
"This disease, which used to be very rare, is
now being diagnosed in my lab about twice a
week, and the vast majority of cases are AIDS
patients," she said.
"But if it's caught, it is very treatable with
certain antibacterial drugs. If the index of
suspicion of toxoplasmosis is as high as it now
should be in doctors' minds, many AIDS
patients suffering from it will be successfully
treated while researchers continue to look for
ways to research the basic immunity defect,"
she said.
Comp sci student receives IBM fellowship
Raul Duran, a doctoral student in computer
science here, has received a $21,705 predoc
toral fellowship from the International Business
Machines Corporation for the 1984-85 aca
demic year.
Duran's research will deal with the problems
of the man-machine interface, particularly auto
matic programming and program verification.
Feminist Studies prize offered
Stanford's Feminist Studies Program has es
tablished the Michelle Rosaldo Essay Prize for

undergraduates for the best essay on women (or
a woman), gender or feminism written in any

DEC gives computers to Stanford
Digital Equipment Corporation has given
Stanford 241 Raihbow personal computers,
valued in excess of $1 million.
This equipment will be used in a variety of
academic and research applications involving
such diverse areas as economics, chemistry,

education, mechanical engineering, English and
Residential Education.
Applications such as word processing,
spreadsheets and database systems are being in
corporated into classroom, laboratory and stu
dent residence educational programs.
Many of these personal computers will be
connected to SUNet, the computer communica
tions network currently being extended
throughout the campus. Via SUNet, the Rain
bow systems will connect to the various central
computing and information systems at Stanford.
Goodman elected vice president of ICO
Joseph Goodman, electrical engineering pro
fessor, has been elected vice president of the In
