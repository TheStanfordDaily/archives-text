# Trustees OK parking structure
## Also pass phone system 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The University Board of Trustees yesterday approved
the concept and site of Stanford's first parking structure, a
four- or five-story facility which will accommodate up to
1,000 cars.
The structure will be located just inside Campus Drive
at Quarry Road, across the street from the medical center.
University planners expect that the project, estimated to
cost between $7 and $10 million, will be completed by
early 1986.
In other action, the board approved a $20.8 million
telecommunications system, delayed a decision on the site
for a new Graduate School of Business building until
December and approved construction plans for the Near
West campus.
In a letter to board members, University President
Donald Kennedy and Provost James Rosse refer to the
parking structure as "a project about which none of us can
feel enthusiastic, but which your administration and the
committees that have studied the problem believe to be
essential."
The parking facility will serve primarily the medical
center, where University staff project an immediate need
for 550 additional parking spaces, and the Near West
campus area, where construction is expected to displace
96 stalls. University planners considered five sites, all lo
cated in this general vicinity, before recommending this
one to the board for approval.
Aeronautics and Astronautics Prof. Daniel Bershader,
chairman of the University Committee on Parking and
Transportation, said the structure should solve some of
the parking problems on campus.
"That type of parking configuration doesn't use up as
much of our valuable land [as other alternatives]," Ber
shader said. "I tend to think it might be an appropriate
way to go."
The board approved plans for a telecommunication
project which should modernize the University's anti
quated telephone system within the next year.
William Massy, University vice president for busines
and finance, said the new system will have "all of the state
of the art stuff," including an electronic telephone
switcher and a fiber optic transmission system.
Immediately after the board's adjournment. Massy
signed an $11 million contract with Northern Telecom
Inc., a Canada-based communications firm.
Massy said although yesterday's meeting with Northern
Telecom had been arranged in advance, the deal was con
tingent upon board approval.
"If they had said no, I would not have signed," he said
The new phone system, affecting all units with a '497'
prefix, will feature touch-tone dialing, call waiting and au
tomatic long-distance dispatching.
In addition, the telecommunications project will en
hance "office automations sytems, word processing,
computing and communication," according to Massy.
The board discussed plans for expanding the Graduate
School of Business, but refused to approve a site for the
new building.
Board members indicated that officials should recon
sider the proposed site and present updated plans at the
December meeting.
The site proposed by planners is the intersection of
Lasuen Street and Memorial Way, just north of the exist
ing GSB building. According to Phil Williams, director of
University planning, board members balked at this site for
several reasons.
Williams said the board was concerned because the site
is a major pedestrian and bicycle circulation area. Also,
the site's proximity to the Oval may upset the aesthetic
ambiance of the official entrance to the University.
Williams said the board asked him to "investigate alter
nate sites right in that same area." He said although plan
ners have already looked into such alternatives, "the
board wants us to press harder."
Paul Johnson, associate dean of the business school,
said the expansion is necessary to accommodate increases
in faculty.
"We are already doubling up at least 15 faculty in the
existing space," Johnson said. He said the school expects
to add approximately 16 more professors over the next
decade.
"The point is right now, we can't even handle the fac
ulty we have," Johnson said. "We are already over
crowded."
The board also approved plans for a $14 million Labo
ratory Surge Building on the burgeoning west side of
campus.
