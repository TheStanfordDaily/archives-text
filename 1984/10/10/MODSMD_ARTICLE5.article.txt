### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Certain student publications may
face a financial squeeze this year
despite support from the ASSU and
the Publications Board.
Finances for The Chaparral, the
campus humor magazine, are "very
tight," according to editor Ron Fer
nandez.
Although the quarterly magazine
received $5,250 this year from the
Publications Board, Fernandez said
the problem is "a legacy from past
staffs."
"In the past, very poor business
practices were the norm," Fernandez
said.
The Chaparral plans to publish an
issue this quarter, but according to
Fernandez, is "still suffering from a
bad reputation with advertisers and
with the ASSU. "
"It's very frustrating because
everything is now above board, but
this year will definitely be a
watershed year, and we 11 have to
cross our fingers," Fernandez said.
Aurora, a paper focusing on
feminist issues, received $605 from

the Publications Board for this year's
budget.
But according to staff member
Karie Youngdahl, the paper is now "a
bit short" because of problems col
lecting bills from last year.
Youngdahl said each issue costs
around $800. Aurora prints three 12-
to 16-page issues each school year,
one at the end of every quarter.
"Even though we're short, I think
we'll definitely be able to have an
issue at the end of this quarter,"
Youngdahl said.
Mawazo, a 40-page journal focus
ing on Africa, will apply to the
Publications Board for additional
funds for this year, according to staff
member Meda Okelo.
Mawazo was originally granted
$1,020 for an issue to appear in the
spring, but now plans to print another
issue in early November, Okelo said.
"We didn't anticipate publishing
this November, but since we're
having a conference which we con
sider a major event, we'd like to add
an issue this year," Okelo said.
"Except for one year when we
didn't receive anything, we usually
can get close to what we ask for,
Okelo said. "But we'll also apply to
the African Studies Department, the
dean of humanities and sciences.
Memorial Church and other sources
for funds."
Up Front, a general interest maga
zine, is one of few publications that is
able to count on an improved finan
cial situation.
"Sales have been jumping and ad
vertising has doubled, so things look
great," staff member Scott Stevenson
said. "Right now, we're even hoping
to move from two issues to three is
sues a year."
But Stevenson said he does plan to
ask for an additional $400 in funds
for this year.
"We need more money for promo
tional projects right now than we can
generate in advertising immediately,"
Stevenson said.
The Real News, a publication
covering the black community, has
made a significant improvement in its
financial standings compared to last
year, according to editor David
Troutt.
"Things didn't look so good iast
year, but now we're really becoming
formidable," Troutt said. "The pri
mary reason is that our advertising
looks really promising."
The Real News received $1,250
dollars from the Publications Board
budget last year to cover all its bi
quarterly issues.
"We don't have a policy of total
dependence on the ASSU, and it's
safer that we keep it that way" Troutt
said. "But, in general, I'd say [the
ASSU is] pretty fair."
