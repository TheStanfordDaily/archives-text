Certain student publications may
face a financial squeeze this year
despite support from the ASSU and
the Publications Board.
Finances for The Chaparral, the
campus humor magazine, are "very

Youngdahl said.
Mawazo, a 40-page journal focus

Publications Board for additional
funds for this year, according to staff
member Meda Okelo.
Mawazo was originally granted
$1,020 for an issue to appear in the
spring, but now plans to print another
issue in early November, Okelo said.
"We didn't anticipate publishing
this November, but since we're
having a conference which we con

an issue this year," Okelo said.
"Except for one year when we
