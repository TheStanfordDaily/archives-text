# No arbitration in Niven's dispute
## University rejects proposal 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The battle between Stanford and
Niven's International Market contin
ued yesterday when the University
rejected a judge's recommendation to
seek an independent arbitrator in the
case.
Judge Eugene Premo, a Santa
Clara County Superior Court official,
suggested yesterday that the Univer
sity and Niven consent to arbitra
tion in their business dispute.
Lawyers for Niven agreed with the
proposal, but counsel for the Univer
sity said Stanford prefers to proceed
in court.
"An arbitrator is going to be as fair
as a judge, but a lot cheaper and
quicker," said Niven's owner John
Niven. "It makes more sense."
University officials, however,
disagreed. According to Staff Coun
sel Michael Hundall, "Stanford
thought it (arbitration) would not be
the best move."
The dispute began in July when the
University filed suit against Niven
for attempting to sublease sections of
his store to a Mrs. Fields cookies out

let and a Cone-a-Copia ice cream
vendor. University representatives
said subleasing was a violation of
Niven's 29-year-old lease.
Niven's 23,000-square-foot store
sits on the north edge of the Stanford
Shopping Center, a facility owned by
the University.
During August, the University
sought both a temporary restraining
order and a preliminary injunction to
prevent Niven from moving ahead
with his plans while the suit was
pending. Judges denied both motions.
But Niven hit a snag when a judge
ordered that he submit plans for the
construction to the University for
routine approval. According to the
terms of the lease, Stanford, as
landlord, must approve any plans to
"alter the premises."
Last month, the University indi
cated that the plans were unaccepta
ble. In a letter to Niven, University
officials objected to Niven's proposed
location for the two concessionaires.
But Niven countered that the Uni
versity has never before interfered

The controversy between the University and Niven's International
Foods will continue despite a judge's suggestion to have an arbitrator
resolve the situation.
