# No arbitration in Niven's dispute
## University rejects proposal 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The battle between Stanford and
Niven's International Market contin
ued yesterday when the University
rejected a judge's recommendation to
seek an independent arbitrator in the
case.
Judge Eugene Premo, a Santa
Clara County Superior Court official,
suggested yesterday that the Univer
sity and Niven consent to arbitra
tion in their business dispute.
Lawyers for Niven agreed with the
proposal, but counsel for the Univer
sity said Stanford prefers to proceed
in court.
"An arbitrator is going to be as fair
as a judge, but a lot cheaper and
quicker," said Niven's owner John
Niven. "It makes more sense."
University officials, however,
disagreed. According to Staff Coun
sel Michael Hundall, "Stanford
thought it (arbitration) would not be
the best move."
The dispute began in July when the
University filed suit against Niven
for attempting to sublease sections of
his store to a Mrs. Fields cookies out

let and a Cone-a-Copia ice cream
vendor. University representatives
said subleasing was a violation of
Niven's 29-year-old lease.
Niven's 23,000-square-foot store
sits on the north edge of the Stanford
Shopping Center, a facility owned by
the University.
During August, the University
sought both a temporary restraining
order and a preliminary injunction to
prevent Niven from moving ahead
with his plans while the suit was
pending. Judges denied both motions.
But Niven hit a snag when a judge
ordered that he submit plans for the
construction to the University for
routine approval. According to the
terms of the lease, Stanford, as
landlord, must approve any plans to
"alter the premises."
Last month, the University indi
cated that the plans were unaccepta
ble. In a letter to Niven, University
officials objected to Niven's proposed
location for the two concessionaires.
But Niven countered that the Uni
versity has never before interfered

with such day-to-day decisions as lo
cation of products in his store. Fur
thermore, he contends that the cur
rent plans do not constitute an altera
tion to the existing structure. He went
to court yesterday to ask Judge
Premo to deny Stanford's right to
review the plans.
Premo scanned the case yesterday
and, determining it was largely a busi
ness dispute, suggested the two par
ties see an outside arbitrator. When
that recommendation met with
defeat, he agreed to hear the portion
of the case dealing with Stanford's
right of approval on Nov. 6.
Regardless of the outcome of that
hearing, the University plans to
pursue its suit on the grounds that
subleasing is a violation of the lease.
In the meantime, Stanford defends
its right, as stipulated in the lease, to
review Niven's plans.
"These are permanent changes that
involve going through the floor, con
necting sewer lines," Hundall said.

"They're clearly alterations," and
thus the University has right of ap
proval, he added.
Niven maintains that the Univer
sity is stalling the matter and trying to
wear him down.
"That's all part of Stanford's game
plan: frustrate me and hope I break
down." he said.
He said the University was "trying
to grind us down, drag it out."
Niven admitted he was
"disappointed" when the University
rejected the option to arbitrate. He
said arbitration was "a very common
process in issues like this.
"It's stupid to tie up the court's
time with business disputes of this
kind," he said. "It costs a lot of
money and time each time you go
back to court.
"In the meantime, we have no
cookies and ice cream."
Hundall said it is still possible this
issue may be resolved before the Nov.
6 court date. He said Niven has not
attempted to discuss the issue; in
stead the store owner went directly to
court following receipt of the letter.
"I think further discussion is possi
ble," Hundall said.

ness dispute, suggested the two par
ties see an outside arbitrator. When
that recommendation met with
defeat, he agreed to hear the portion
of the case dealing with Stanford's
right of approval on Nov. 6.
Regardless of the outcome of that
hearing, the University plans to
pursue its suit on the grounds that
subleasing is a violation of the lease.
In the meantime, Stanford defends
its right, as stipulated in the lease, to
review Niven's plans.
"These are permanent changes that
involve going through the floor, con
necting sewer lines," Hundall said.

"They're clearly alterations," and
thus the University has right of ap
proval, he added.
Niven maintains that the Univer
sity is stalling the matter and trying to
wear him down.
"That's all part of Stanford's game
plan: frustrate me and hope I break
down." he said.
He said the University was "trying
to grind us down, drag it out."
Niven admitted he was
"disappointed" when the University
rejected the option to arbitrate. He
said arbitration was "a very common
process in issues like this.
"It's stupid to tie up the court's
time with business disputes of this
kind," he said. "It costs a lot of
money and time each time you go
back to court.
"In the meantime, we have no
cookies and ice cream."
Hundall said it is still possible this
issue may be resolved before the Nov.
6 court date. He said Niven has not
attempted to discuss the issue; in
stead the store owner went directly to
court following receipt of the letter.
"I think further discussion is possi
ble," Hundall said.
