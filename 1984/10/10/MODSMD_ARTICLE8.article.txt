Rebels willing to meet Duarte
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Leftist rebels yesterday accepted
Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte's invitation to peace talks.
A communique from rebel combat and political organizations said
that the groups are willing to send representatives to meet Duarte Mon
day in La Palma, a town in northern El Salvador, as the president pro
posed Monday in an address to the U.N. General Assembly.
Two leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, an al
liance of the five guerrilla combat forces, will attend as well as two mem
bers of the guerrillas' political and diplomatic arm. the Revolutionary
Democratic Front, the communique said.
The four representatives were not identified.
Duarte's invitation and its acceptance are the most dramatic steps
toward peace during nearly five years of civil strife in El Salvador. Previ
ous talks, held before Duarte took office June 1, involved a power
less government commission and rebel political representatives. The
talks went nowhere.
"Taking into account the deepening of the war and the aggravation of
the regional situation, the FMLN and the FDR expressed their intention
to discuss the Salvadoran crisis in its totality and propose solutions for
the same," said the rebel communique, which was read over Radio Ven
ceremos, the insurgents' radio station, and handed out in Managua and
Mexico City.
The swift response followed brief hesitation on the part of the rebels.
Originally, they suggested that Duarte's invitation was a publicity ploy.
Peres promised economic aid
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday gave Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres an open-ended promise of increased trade, in
vestment and direct-aid grants to help Israel overcome its crippling infla
tion and ruinous balance-of-payments deficit.
In a two-hour White House meeting described by a high-level aide as
"very open, very warm and extremely wide-ranging," Reagan also
renewed his two-year-old Middle East peace initiative but failed to con
vince the Israelis to reverse an earlier decision to reject the plan.
"We have agreed to explore with Israel ways to enhance its growth
and development prospects through structural adjustment, increased
trade and investment, as well as American aid," Reagan said after the
meeting. He stood side by side with a beaming Peres, who was making
his first official visit to Washington after taking office as prime minister
last month.
Peres responded by hailing Reagan as "a true friend of Israel" who
had brought U.S.-Israeli relations to "a new level of harmony and un
derstanding." Although Peres is scheduled to pay a courtesy call on
Democratic presidental nominee Walter Mondale, his praise of Reagan
seemed certain to boost the president's re-election campaign among
Jewish voters.
A senior U.S. official who attended the meeting said it focused on Is
rael's economic woes and the country's 28-month-old occupation of
southern Lebanon. No new initiatives were agreed to concerning
Lebanon, he said.
Israel has been running an inflation rate of about 400 percent for the
past year. Recently, the cost-of-living increase surged close to an annual
rate of 700 percent.
Reagan alters Social Security vow
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, responding to a challenge by
Walter Mondale, ruled out yesterday any cuts or changes in Social Se
curity benefits for current recipients or future retirees.
In an abrupt policy shift prompted by Mondale's suggestion at a Cin
cinnati campaign stop that Reagan might revamp the Social Security sys
tem, White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the president had au
thorized him to announce that he "will never stand for reduction in So
cial Security benefits for anybody."
Reagan's scaneturtf position, reiterated as recent/y as his debate Sun
day night with Mondale, has been that he would not seek to cut benefits
for current recipients. But he had not specifically ruled out program
changes that could affect the benefits of those not yet on the rolls.
"I am here to say that I have just spoken with the president, and
Mondale ought to be ashamed," Speakes said. "He is out to frighten the
elderly. The president will never stand for reduction in Social Security
benefits for anybody who is now getting it or future recipients."
Mondale said in Cincinnati that he had would reject any attempts to
reduce Social Security benefits and challenged Reagan to do the same.
Speakes said that even if inflation should change the present healthy
outlook for the Old Age and Retirement trust funds, "the president is
not planning on cutting benefits, now or in the future."
He ignored questions about whether that could lead to increases in
Social Security payroll taxes, for which Reagan often has criticized the
Carter administration.
Bush prepares for debate
WASHINGTON — With the big debate only a day away, Vice Presi
dent George Bush spent only 90 minutes yesterday preparing for his
encounter with Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.).
Aides to the vice president portrayed him as coolly going about the
business of his high office, conferring and dining with Israeli Prime Mini
ster Shimon Peres, to the consternation of some advisers who worry that
he should bone up with more intensity.
They minimized the political importance of his debate with the first
woman vice presidential nominee of a major party.
"They shouldn't put pressure on their candidate like that," Bush's
press secretary Peter Teeley said reprovingly of Democratic strategists,
who contend the ante for the Bush-Ferraro debate is much higher be
cause of Walter Mondale's surprisingly strong showing in Sunday's
presidential debate.
Tomorrow's vice presidential debate has taken on new significance. Re
publican campaign advisers say a clear victory by Ferraro could make
Reagan-Bush look to voters like a "losing team." And despite the tones
of nonchalance, there are signs that this has created unease in the Bush
entourage.
One such sign came Monday when Bush's wife, Barbara, in an unchar
acteristic slip, called Ferraro "that $4 million — I can't say it but it
rhymes with rich." Barbara Bush made the remark after complaining to
reporters that Mondale was "unfair" in Sunday's debate for making an
issue of her husband's income taxes.
Barbara Bush called Ferraro to apologize, and Ferraro accepted.
Tuesday, Bush said the word she was thinking of was "witch."
Church-state case before Court
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, accepting another case test
ing the barrier between church and state, agreed yesterday to decide the
constitutionality of a $3 billion federal program that allows public school
teachers to conduct classes for disadvantaged children in religious
schools.
- The justices will review a federal appellate court ruling that in
validated provisions of the government program, which permits
remedial instruction for almost 200,000 private school children in the
United States. Aimed at low-income urban communities, the program
also benefits more than 5 million public school students whose participa
tion is not at issue in the case.
The new case (Aguilar vs. Felton, 84-237) involves the use of federal
grants under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of
1965 for remedial reading, mathematics and language classes in the city
_ of New York.
Stocks record another loss

session yesterday after an early upswing lost momentum.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 6 points in the opening
90 minutes, closed with a 2.76-point loss at 1,175.13, bringing its decline
for the past three sessions to 12.26 points.
