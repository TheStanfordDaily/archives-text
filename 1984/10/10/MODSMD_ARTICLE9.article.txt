## Congress still deadlocked 
### 
WASHINGTON — Senate and House
negotiators shouted, sweet-talked, told jokes and
pounded gavels for hours yesterday — but
remained deadlocked on a $500 billion funding bill
needed to keep most of the government running
past midnight.
Thus, it appeared that for the fourth time in a
week. Congress would have to pass a stopgap fund
ing measure — and once again put off its sched
uled adjournment for 1984 — while efforts con
tinue on a permanent bill that would last through
next Sept. 30.
The negotiators continued meeting into the
night, trying to resolve two issues, aid to
Nicaraguan rebels and defense spending, that have
bitterly divided Congress for two years.
Meanwhile, the Senate was bogged down on the
one other piece of vital legislation that Congress
must pass before adjourning for the year: a mea
sure to raise the ceiling on the national debt.
For the first time, several leaders began talking
seriously about postponing action on the defense
and Nicaragua disputes until a lame-duck session
after the Nov. 6 elections. Many senators and
House members are eager to get away to campaign
for re-election.
"You can't keep extending it (stopgap funding),
day after day after day," said Tom Griscom, a top
aide to Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker Jr.
(R-Tenn.). Griscom said that Baker would confer

with House Speaker Thomas "lip"' O'Neill Jr. (D-
Mass.) about the possibility of a lame-duck session,
but a spokesman for O'Neill said that the Speaker
was strongly opposed to the idea.
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) and Rep. Jamie
Whitten (D-Miss.), heads of the appropriations
committees in each chamber, also suggested a post
election session might be needed.
"It gets us nowhere to talk about who's being in
transigent," Sen. Lowell Weicker Jr. (R-Conn.)
pleaded rather plaintively — but his message got
nowhere.
In addition to putting off action on defense
spending and Nicaragua, a lame-duck session could
breathe new life into numerous bills that are racing
the clock against Congress' adjournment, when all
unpassed legislation dies. Congress had hoped to
adjourn last Friday.
The Democratic-controlled House wants a total
cutoff of aid to guerrillas fighting Nicaragua's leftist
regime, while the Republican-dominated Senate
supports President Reagan's request for a reported
$28 million. On a related issue, the House is insist
ing on a ban against use of U.S combat troops in El
Salvador and Nicaragua.
The House also wants $350 million less than the
Senate for Reagan's "Star Wars" anti-missile plan,
and it wants to ban testing of anti-satellite weap
ons. Moreover, it is pushing lor restrictions on the
deployment of sea-launched cruise missiles.
Further complicating matters, David Stockman,

President Reagan's budget director, reiterated in a
letter yesterday that he would recommend a veto of
the bill if it included funds for any water projects.
The Senate and House conferees have
tentatively agreed on $100 million in starter money
for 39 projects that Stockman estimated would cost
$6 billion to complete. Although the administra
tion had asked for 14 projects costing $30 million
to start and $300 million to complete. Stockman
protested that the spending bill lacked Reagan
backed reforms requiring local governments and
private beneficiaries to bear a substantial share of
the projects' cost.
Stockman also strongly objected to a House
passed provision authorizing $18 billion for an ad
ditional 300 water projects. The Senate has refused
to take the provision and House conferees have
decided to let the full House vote on whether to
keep it.
The House conferees also voted 12-4 to have the
full House decide whether to accept the Senate's
position on defense and aid to Nicaraguan rebels.
But Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) said that he
would block any such move because several years
ago the Senate was tricked by a similar maneuver.
The House rejected the Senate position and left
town, forcing the Senate to accept the House posi
tion or bear the blame for shutting down the gov
ernment.
