# Schlafly hits ERA
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Phyllis Schlafly, the anti-feminist lawyer responsible for
organizing the fight against the Equal Rights Amendment,
blasted "equal pay for comparable worth" policies in a
Dinkelspiel Auditorium speech last night.
Appearing before an audience which filled two-thirds of
the auditorium, Schlafly said she would discuss the
"comparable worth" issue because "it is an issue on which
there is a real difference between the two party plat
forms."
According to Schlafly, the " 'equal pay for comparable
worth' notion is very different from the notion of 'equal
pay for equal work.' "
"Comparable worth is a notion of requiring equal pay
for unequal work," Schlafly said. "It's a notion that some
judge or administrator should decide what your job is
worth."
Schlafly called the comparable worth issue not so much
a feminist issue as "an economic and a private enterprise
issue."
"What you're paid in the real world is a compromise be
tween what you think you are worth and what someone is
willing to pay," Schlafly said. "That's what we call
freedom."
Schlafly said the assumption that "women are the vic
tims of a giant male conspiracy" has not been proven by
feminists in favor of equal pay for comparable worth.
"The other assumption is that we should deal with wo
men as a group and men as a group and not as individ
uals," she said. "I look at women in the United States and
I think we are the most fortunate class of people who have

ever lived on the
face of this
earth."
The principal
reason for the
salary difference
between men
and women is
that young
people get
married, accord
ing to Schlafly.
Schlafly said
the average
married woman
spends only one
third of her
years in the paid
labor force.

"There's no way then that I can make as much as my
husband, who has been working his whole life," Schlafly
said.
"It's also a fact that you won't start with the same salary
out of college if you major in English as someone who
majors in engineering," she said. "Those are the conse
quences of personal career decisions."
Schlafly said she believes women choose lower paying
jobs, such as secretarial occupations, to have the com
fortable working conditions not available in blue collar
jobs.
"When I look at the hands on an elderly carpenter, I can
sec why a woman wouldn't want to make that sacrifice,"
she said.
During the question and answer period, Schlafly was
asked about her opposition to the Equal Rights Amend
ment.
"I think the number one motivation was the clear fact
that ERA would have compelled the drafting of young wo
men into the military," Schlafly said.
When asked how she would feel about one of her sons
being drafted, Schlafly replied, "That is not the same, and
it's a reality that the majority of people in this country feel

that way."
Though some persons in the audi
ence hissed and groaned at Schlafly's
statements, the one incident of heck
ling was silenced by the majority of
the audience.
Responding to a question on her
opposition to sexual education
courses, Schlafly said, "The fact is,
the more sex courses you have, the
more abortions there are. The two
have both increased."
Because the speech focused on
freedom of choice, one member of
the audience asked why Schlafly feels
an overwhelming majority of women
choose to be poor.
"The two causes for so many wo
men being poor are divorce and out
of-wedlock births," Schlafly said.
