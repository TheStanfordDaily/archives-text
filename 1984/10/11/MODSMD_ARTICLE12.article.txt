## The 						Stanford Daily No union busting 
### 
Early this February, the United Stanford
Workers broke away from the much larger
county-wide union. Local 715, to charter its own
autonomous union. Local 680.
At the time, this event didn't seem important
enough to merit the media, faculty and student
attention it has come to warrant. The affair
seemed to be an internal union matter, of little
consequence to the rest of us.
But at the time, the University wasn't making
overt attempts to break the union.
Seven months, one union election, about a
dozen unfair labor practice charges and a can
celed National Labor Relations Board hearing
later, the two sides have agreed to conduct a
second election to determine whether USW will
represent the Stanford workers.
Two weeks ago. University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate that Stanford's
position in the election "will be in favor of no
union." He said the workers "would be better off
without this representation."
Kennedy speaks the role of an enlightened
liberal: He advocates intellectual discussion, he
celebrates diversity, he advocates public service
and deplores self-interest.
But there is little that is intellectual about un
ion-busting. For more than 100 years, American

workers have fought and died for collective bar
gaining. Now Kennedy is telling Stanford
laborers that they would be better off if they were
able to bargain for their contracts on an individual
basis.
Somehow the element of fairness disappears
when each worker has to struggle for his or her
contract against a multi-million dollar corpora
tion that can easily survive without one or two
"troublemakers."
Stanford workers now enjoy a health plan, a
pension plan, wage scales and the right to file
grievances. Odds are extremely high that without
a union, Stanford employees would have
achieved none of these.
Kennedy may speak like an intellectual, but his
treatment of the union is more characteristic of a
cynical, self-interested corporate manager. He
can't be both.
Unions play an important part in our society.
USW is integral to the Stanford workplace. We
hope the union is confirmed in the upcoming
election.
More important, we hope University officials
behave reasonably in the event of a USW victory
and begin dealing with the union in a responsible
manner.
