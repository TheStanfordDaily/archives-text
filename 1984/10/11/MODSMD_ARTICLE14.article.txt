## Too old to accept fairy tale America 
### 
When I was little, I loved to listen to fairy tales.
All the issues were so clear cut. There was a hero
and a villain, and no matter what else happened in
the story I could always count upon the hero to win.
That was when I was little, but now I'm big and I
don't like to be told fairy tales anymore. I no longer
think in blacks and whites. 1 think in grays, and I
don't like anyone who tries to eliminate my grays.
President Reagan seems to be one of those people
who doesn't like grays. Reagan doesn't want to be

VIEWPOINT

the educated leader of a great nation; he wants to
be a daddy putting his loved but nonetheless ig
norant children to bed. He doesn't want to speak to
us about affairs of state; he just wants to tell us a
modern-day fairy tale.
Well, I resent his attempt to turn his fantasies
into my realities. Reagan's campaign is one fantas
tic illusion. And 1 don't want to be a part of it.
The fashionable political question is: "Are you
better off now than you were four years ago?"
When Reagan asks this question in his campaign
commercials, the answer is a resounding yes. What
1 want to know, though, is exactly where are these
people who are better off today? I certainly haven't
met any of them. Maybe they all go to Stanford.
Maybe instead of looking forward to getting
$100,000 a year, they can look forward to cashing
in on their tax breaks and getting $110,000. Yeah,
maybe they're the people answering a resounding
yes. I just haven't seen them because I've been
looking in another direction. It's really easy to look
up the ladder, but no one ever wants to look down
or across, as the case may be.
I think it's a matter of opening your eyes. It's
very easy to believe Reagan's TV commercials.
They depict the fairy tale America — the eternal
land of prosperity. Reagan is the knight in shining
armor. Everyone seems to love him. He's inspired a
new patriotism, an economic recovery — in short, a
new era of American strength. Those are the facts I
see and hear on TV. Those are the facts over 60
percent of Americans believe.
Well, I'm not a part of that 60 percent. I used to
believe fairy tales. But now I'm a big girl. I want
truth, not glossy illusion. Reagan wants me to
believe he's good and Mondale's bad. It's the
hero/villain situation, the black and the white. The
issues are simply not that clear cut. I see the
Reagan commercials; I hear the press praise the
man; I hear person after person endorsing him. I
also know what I see around me. I see more people
unemployed; I see more people below the poverty
line. Perhaps the people 1 see are just too busy
struggling to stay afloat to stand up and say: "Wait
a minute, I am definitely not better off now than I
was four years ago." Then again, they might be
trapped in our president s web of illusion. For
merly, the media reflected )ciety and its opinions.

Now I'd be very willing to argue that it shapes soci
ety. Everyone just seems to be convinced that even
their sacrifices are going toward building a "strong
America." Face it, the press loves Reagan; the
people love Reagan.
Doesn't anyone ever sit down and think about
Reagan's policies? Well, I do, and, to tell the truth,
they scare the shit out of me. It is beyond my un
derstanding how anyone can support Reagan's mil
itary buildup. I think it's now 23 times over that we
can blow up the world. Actually, once is enough for
me. Don't ask me what the other 22 times are for.
Question: If you're in a room with gasoline, do
you need one match or 23? I'd love to say
none, wish I could say one, and would settle for 23
if it stopped there. Ah, but 24 looms ever closer.
Reagan's argument is that we need to stave off a
Soviet threat. Our weapons are a deterrent to nu
clear war. The logic my mother taught me tells me
that playing with matches is not an effective way of
avoiding burns. And I seriously believe that
Reagan would not hesitate to push that button and
burn us all. Remember, you too can survive a nu
clear holocaust. All you need is a large hole, a
couple of doors and some dirt. Reagan just doesn't
seem to think that highly of human lives. His
policies have caused the deaths of Americans and
others in Lebanon, Grenada, Nicaragua and El Sal
vador. Reagan insults me every day by refusing to

sign a nuclear arms limitation agreement. I think:
"Hey, I'm only 19. I want to see 25 at least."
Reagan thinks we'll be weak if we let the Soviets
have even the tiniest advantage. Personally, 1 think
I'd sell my soul for disarmament.
Why not negotiate? Because, see, communists
are, well, anti-Christs. I know that line sounds
about 30 years too late. After all, though, aren't we
in another Cold War era? U.S.-Soviet arms
negotiations are in shambles. And Reagan's only
meeting with a Soviet leader came too close to elec
tion time to be taken seriously.
Actually, I don't see what Reagan has against
communists. I think he has a lot in common with
them. They intervened in Afghanistan. We inter
vened in Central America. Of course, we had
"reasons." You know, I bet they even had reasons
for Afghanistan. The Soviet news agency only tells
its people what it wants them to hear. Rea
gan only tells Americans what he wants them
to hear. I've developed what I think is an admirable
habit. Whenever I watch a Reagan commercial, I
talk back to it. He tells me about how he lowered
inflation; I remind him about unemployment. He
speaks about education; I tell him about how he cut
off all of my financial aid. He brags about produc
tivity; I moan "The deficit, the deficit." Etc., etc.,
etc.
