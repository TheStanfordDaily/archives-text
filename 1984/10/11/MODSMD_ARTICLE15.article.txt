## Liberal arts degree beneficial 
### 
We're all back at Stanford again,
the land of milk and honey and
eucalyptus trees, after a summer of
parents, or jobs or traveling. Some
people are here for the first time, but
one question is plaguing nearly all of
us, old and new: What am I going to
study? Another question follows im
plicitly: What am I going to do with
my life? Well, I'm going to give you
some advice. "Why listen to me?"
you may be asking yourself. That's a
good question. Listen to me because
I've already been here for four years.
Listen to me because I've had about
six majors. Listen to me because I
have already interviewed for jobs.
Listen to me because I know what the
companies in the real world are
looking for. Of course. The Daily and
this advice is free, so it doesn't cost
you anything anyway.
You should first know what many
people forget: Stanford is a liberal
arts school with an engineering school
stuck on. It is not a glorified voca
tional school. If you are looking to
major in business with an emphasis in
accounting or finance, get out now,
because you will be frustrated.
You may be thinking, "Gosh, I
want to get a job when I graduate, but
what can I do with a liberal arts

degree?" As a graduate with a liberal
arts degree, you have many opportu
nities. A liberal arts degree, such as
one in English, humanities, history,
classics, philosophy, American
studies, sociology or communication,
should guarantee that you can do
three things well: read, write and
think critically. These skills may seem
trivial when compared to skills
learned in engineering classes, like
programming and building bridges.
Because of the rapid progress of tech
nology, however, many engineering
skills are obsolete in seven years.
Reading, writing and critical thinking
will never be obsolete.
"Who's going to pay me to read,
write and think?" you may be asking.
"I need specific training to get a job."
To be honest, few people are going to
pay you to read, write and think
about whatever you choose.
However, many will pay you well to
read, write and think, and then make
decisions based on your thinking,
about matters important to them.
Analysts, managers, corporate execu
tive officers, bakery owners and
salesmen all have to gather informa
tion, think about the information,
make a decision and then communi
cate that decision, most often by

writing it.
"But I need specific training to
work at a job, specific training that a
liberal arts degree cannot provide,"
you are probably thinking by now.
And you are absolutely correct. The
training you need is so specific that no
institution like Stanford could pro
vide you with the skills you need.
Each company is different; General
Motors has different methods and
policies than Ford. When you go to
work for a company, they are going to
train you; they expect you to have the
skills to learn quickly. That is, they
expect you to be able to read, write
and think critically. For example,
IBM figures it takes new employees
nearly three years to learn the techni
cal background on a product. You
could never get that specific informa
tion about an IBM product at any
other place but an IBM school.
In short, don't let your anxiety
about your future career unduly sway
your choice of major. A liberal arts
degree does not necessarily condemn
you to a life of poverty, nor does it
force you to go to law school or busi
ness school to avoid poverty. If you
are considering pursuing a liberal arts
degree, and if you are concerned
about your future employment, you

should know that most companies
like the broad background a liberal
arts graduate brings to the job. They
are looking for some basic business
and technical skills to accompany the
liberal arts degree, too. These include
the equivalent of one course in statis
tics, computer science, basic econom
ics and accounting. In general,
though, study what you will; if you
are truly interested in engineering,
study engineering. If you have a fetish
for physics, study physics. If you have
a fancy for literature, study English.
Allow your mind to roam; sample
Stanford's many delicious intellectual
offerings. Take a class on Renais
sance poets, or the philosophy of
Nietzsche, or Greek vase painting, or
thermodynamics or 18th-century
Russian history. You'll never get an
other chance as great as this to in
dulge and broaden your mind. Some
of these courses may even change the
way you think about the world.
Besides, you'll do better in the classes
you're interested in, and that will help
you get a good job.

skills to learn quickly. That is, they
expect you to be able to read, write
and think critically. For example,
IBM figures it takes new employees
nearly three years to learn the techni
cal background on a product. You
could never get that specific informa
tion about an IBM product at any
other place but an IBM school.
In short, don't let your anxiety
about your future career unduly sway
your choice of major. A liberal arts
degree does not necessarily condemn
you to a life of poverty, nor does it
force you to go to law school or busi
ness school to avoid poverty. If you
are considering pursuing a liberal arts
degree, and if you are concerned
about your future employment, you

should know that most companies
like the broad background a liberal
arts graduate brings to the job. They
are looking for some basic business
and technical skills to accompany the
liberal arts degree, too. These include
the equivalent of one course in statis
tics, computer science, basic econom
ics and accounting. In general,
though, study what you will; if you
are truly interested in engineering,
study engineering. If you have a fetish
for physics, study physics. If you have
a fancy for literature, study English.
Allow your mind to roam; sample
Stanford's many delicious intellectual
offerings. Take a class on Renais
sance poets, or the philosophy of
Nietzsche, or Greek vase painting, or
thermodynamics or 18th-century
Russian history. You'll never get an
other chance as great as this to in
dulge and broaden your mind. Some
of these courses may even change the
way you think about the world.
Besides, you'll do better in the classes
you're interested in, and that will help
you get a good job.

We're all back at Stanford again,
the land of milk and honey and
eucalyptus trees, after a summer of
parents, or jobs or traveling. Some
people are here for the first time, but
one question is plaguing nearly all of
us, old and new: What am I going to
study? Another question follows im
plicitly: What am I going to do with
my life? Well, I'm going to give you
some advice. "Why listen to me?"
you may be asking yourself. That's a
good question. Listen to me because
I've already been here for four years.
Listen to me because I've had about
six majors. Listen to me because I
have already interviewed for jobs.
Listen to me because I know what the
companies in the real world are
looking for. Of course. The Daily and
this advice is free, so it doesn't cost
you anything anyway.
You should first know what many
people forget: Stanford is a liberal
arts school with an engineering school
stuck on. It is not a glorified voca
tional school. If you are looking to
major in business with an emphasis in
accounting or finance, get out now,
because you will be frustrated.
You may be thinking, "Gosh, I
want to get a job when I graduate, but
what can I do with a liberal arts

degree?" As a graduate with a liberal
arts degree, you have many opportu
nities. A liberal arts degree, such as
one in English, humanities, history,
classics, philosophy, American
studies, sociology or communication,
should guarantee that you can do
three things well: read, write and
think critically. These skills may seem
trivial when compared to skills
learned in engineering classes, like
programming and building bridges.
Because of the rapid progress of tech
nology, however, many engineering
skills are obsolete in seven years.
Reading, writing and critical thinking
will never be obsolete.
"Who's going to pay me to read,
write and think?" you may be asking.
"I need specific training to get a job."
To be honest, few people are going to
pay you to read, write and think
about whatever you choose.
However, many will pay you well to
read, write and think, and then make
decisions based on your thinking,
about matters important to them.
Analysts, managers, corporate execu
tive officers, bakery owners and
salesmen all have to gather informa
tion, think about the information,
make a decision and then communi
cate that decision, most often by

writing it.
"But I need specific training to
work at a job, specific training that a
liberal arts degree cannot provide,"
you are probably thinking by now.
And you are absolutely correct. The
training you need is so specific that no
institution like Stanford could pro
vide you with the skills you need.
Each company is different; General
Motors has different methods and
policies than Ford. When you go to
work for a company, they are going to
train you; they expect you to have the
skills to learn quickly. That is, they
expect you to be able to read, write
and think critically. For example,
IBM figures it takes new employees
nearly three years to learn the techni
cal background on a product. You
could never get that specific informa
tion about an IBM product at any
other place but an IBM school.
In short, don't let your anxiety
about your future career unduly sway
your choice of major. A liberal arts
degree does not necessarily condemn
you to a life of poverty, nor does it
force you to go to law school or busi
ness school to avoid poverty. If you
