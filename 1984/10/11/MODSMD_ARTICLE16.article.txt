Stop the arms race
Columnist Loren Borud (The
Daily, Oct. 9) argues that the
obscenely expensive B-l bomber will
decrease the risk of nuclear war. This
argument is misguided and reflects
dangerous and popular misconcep
tions about nuclear arsenals and war.
Borud, like many of our military
leaders, prattles on about the B-l's
importance in a U.S. retaliation to a
Soviet first strike. He and other B-l
proponents ought to know that such
a U.S. retaliation is already
guaranteed. Our nuclear submarines
alone, immune to Soviet detection,
carry enough warheads to kill easily
more than half the Soviet population.
More importantly, Borud and all
reasonable people must realize that
no one can win a nuclear war. Borud
is obsessed with the United States'
ability to retaliate against a Soviet
first strike. According to the widely
accepted "nuclear winter" scenario,
detonation of the megatonnage

involved in a first strike or other
large nuclear event would plunge the
earth into darkness and sub-zero
temperatures through which few, if
any, people would live.
The nuclear arms race wastes
incredible amounts of money and
increases nuclear tension by giving
the false impression that one side
might get ahead and "win." No one
wins nuclear arms races or wars;
even if the Soviets wiped us out in a
first strike without suffering any
losses, they would shortly perish in a
nuclear winter.
Both superpowers must stop the
arms race and start reducing nuclear
tension by improving their relations,
working for nonproliferaton and
negotiating arms control. The United
States must lead the way by dropping
the B-l and the MX missile system.
We can only benefit by doing so; by
continuing to produce new nuclear
weaponry we only invite destruction.
