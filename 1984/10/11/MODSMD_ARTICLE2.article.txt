## Mondale to join Hart in rally here 
### HEATHER WRIGHT Staff writer 
Democratic officials have confirmed that
presidential candidate Walter Mondale will join
Colorado Senator Gary Hart in a campaign rally
here Tuesday.
The Mondale advance team, now in town, met
with a core group of Stanford democrats last
night at the American Studies House to plan the
details. They plan a massive publicity blitz in
cluding phone banks and flyers.
A source close to the advance team indicated
after the meeting last night that 8,000 to 10,000
persons are expected to attend the rally, which is
slated for noon in White Plaza. Mondale will
arrive in the Bay Area Monday and spend the
night at a hotel in Palo Alto.
The source, who spoke on the condition that
he not be identified, said the advance team is
working to bring other Democratic leaders to
campus, including Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.).
Vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
is not expected to attend the rally, the source
said.
Scott Gode, Stanford Band manager, said the
Band agreed to perform at the rally after the
Mondale advance team contacted him yesterday
at the Band Shak. Gode said the Band will play
before the speech as students are getting out of
their 11 a.m. classes.
"We're going to play for them as a Stanford
hospitality thing," Gode said. "I'm excited to
hear Mondale and Hart speak, and I'm always

excited to play."
The Stanford College Republicans may also at
tend the rally. Steve Dauber, president of the
club, said the group is considering a protest that
would involve 60 to 100 persons. But Dauber also
said that there would be "no heckling" as there
was at a recent Mondale appearance at the Uni
versity of Southern California, and that the
protest would follow guidelines set out by the na
tional Reagan-Bush campaign.
Mary Anne Tenuto of the United Stanford
Workers said that her group has not made any
plans concerning the Mondale appearance. "So
far we haven't been invited or contacted," she
said.
This spring Mondale canceled an appearance
at Stanford, and critics of the union charged that
USW pressure may have been a factor in that
cancellation. USW officials had threatened to
picket during Mondale's spring appearance un
less he agreed to express support for the union in
its labor dispute with the University.
Mondale spokesmen, however, denied USW
threats played any part in their decision to cancel
the Stanford appearance.
Tuesday's White Plaza speech will mark
Mondale's first visit to the Palo Alto area during
his campaign. Hart spoke here on arms-control
issues in the spring of 1983 before an overflow
crowd in Kresge Auditorium.
President Reagan spoke just south of here at
De Anza College in Cupertino on Labor Day.
