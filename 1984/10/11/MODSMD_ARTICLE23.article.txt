### 
KZSU will air the most promising trucks from these albums tonight at 6. The ruling scale is one to five stars

David Bowie — Tonight
★ ★ ★ V2
Compared with "Let's
Dance," David Bowie's latest
effort comes across initially as
"Let's Sit Down." Every song
on side one is slow; the reggae,
vintage soul and old Beach
Boys influences make for good,
friendly background music.
Bowie is still experimenting
with different styles here,
though his songs come across as
more soothing than
groundbreaking. Side two is
simply side three of "Let's
Dance." This is the music that

brought Bowie back into the
Now Playing racks of record
stores everywhere — although
its Caribbean influences distin
guish it from earlier efforts. If a
listen to "Tonight" is less
rewarding than expected, re
member that "Let's Dance"
was a radical departure from
previous Bowie that just cannot
be repeated. "Tonight" is not
his best, nor will it ever be his
most influential; but it will al
ways be enjoyable, and Bowie
has done what most artists will
never be able to do— be acces
sible without being common.

Men Without Hats — Folk of
the flO's part 111 ★ ★ V2
It is sad that a group wishing
to present an alternative to
cold, heartless New Wave
should find itself a victim of it,
but the backlash against synth
pop has been so violent that
this group has been labeled
"Men Without Talent" by an
anonymous DJ at The Zoo;
and the band's second effort,
even with its moments, does
little to challenge this assertion.
"Rhythm of Youth," the
group's debut, was a refreshing
alternative to the cybernetic

dronings of early '80s dance
club mixes. "Folk of the '80s"
is not. Ivan's unique voice and
catchy arrangements just don't
hold up for two albums — his
failure to rise to the occasion
makes "Choke of the '80s" a
more apt title for the record.
Nothing here is even remotely
new, and though most cuts are
danceable, they are so predic
table that one can sing along
the first time. There is still
enough in this album for old
fans; it's a shame that new fans
will probably never hear it in
the first place.

Andy Summers and Robert
Fripp — Bewitched ★ ★ ★ ★
Warnings are in order for
this collaboration. This is not
The Police. This is not King
Crimson. This is not a combi
nation of the two. Also, there
are no vocals anywhere. No
scratching either. And don't
count on much airplay. In fact,
don't count on anything —
even the first Summers/Fripp
album — to predict the music
here. It is atmospheric without
being background, enhancing
one's perceptions and refresh
ing one's creativity — ideal
music to which to study or

reflect. Side one's tracks are
danceable, but not compulsive;
old and new instruments are
blended for an effect lost by
other groups. Side one's synthy
pop edge gives way to side
two's relaxed, ethereal artistry
through the gradual application
of both guitarists' exceptional
skills and leaves the listener
satisfied, peaceful, and just as
content with the silence follow
ing it as he was with the music
itself. Buy it — we'll never
review anything this classy
again.
