# 'Bostonians' misrepresents Henry James novel, ideas
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
For years I have been listening to the claim that movies
based on material from other media — especially
literature — deserve to stand alone, on their own merits,
free from comparison with their sources. This resolution,
which I would call the "ignorance is bliss" argument,
pretends that the reconstituted version of an author's
work owes nothing to that author, and that people who
are serious about literature and film can discuss it without
reference to its original form. In a year that offers screen
versions of novels by Proust, James, Forster and Malcolm
Lowry, so radical a petition for the autonomy of film out
of literature should undergo careful re-examination, I
think. Would a review of John Huston's "Under the Vol

cano" omitting allusion to Lowry's novel make any sense?
Huston apparently believed he was serving Lowry (he
says "Under the Volcano" is his favorite book), so
shouldn't criticism of the picture, in order to justify itself,
attempt to address the ways in which he was (obviously)
mistaken? And if a director were arrogant enough to
transfer to film a novelist of Lowry's stature without actu
ally considering Lowry's vision, wouldn't a failure to hold
him accountable to the novel represent a kind of cultural
amnesia? We build our critical standards on what has
preceded; if we were to close our eyes to the past in art
every time we encountered something new, we would in
effect be razing our standards — even the idea of stand
ards — to the ground each morning.
A movie like "Under the Volcano" does double dis
service to Lowry, by making nonsense of his nightmarish
exploration of a great, sodden mind and by wrecking the
experience of the novel for viewers who come to the film
first. It is unlikely that anyone who has sat through Hus
ton's fiasco would rush to read the book, anyway; who
would elect to repeat the agony? But anyone who did
would find it difficult to immerse himself in Lowry's world
after seeing and hearing Huston's, however superior it
might be; movies have a stronger visceral pull on us than
novels do, and a movie version of a book, which has
reduced its length (400 pages in this case) and complexity
to something playable within two hours, has provided us
with a thickly underscored precis — a brightly marked
path through the (considerably tougher) reading process.
Even a good guideline ignores much of what the author
intended us to see and weigh, and a fraudulent one can
take us so far off course that even when we read the novel,
we're really entering something else entirely. A reader
coming to "Under the Volcano" after watching Huston's

version might well continue to believe that Lowry wrote a
story about a poor benighted consul whose wife and half
brother are so boring and shallow that he's become an al
coholic in self-defense.
I don't wish to imply that directors dealing with first
rate novels ought to be reverent and literal, or smother
their own sensibilities, or that there is only one way to in
terpret any work of literature, or — worse — that no one
should endeavor to reproduce great books on screen. We
have had memorable films of Dickens ("Great Expecta
tions," "Oliver Twist"), Hawthorne (" The Scarlet Let
ter"), Austen ("Pride and Prejudice"), Melville (much of
Huston's "Moby Dick," "Billy Budd"), Crane ("The Red
Badge of Courage"), Conrad ("Sabotage," "Razumov,"
"Outcast of the Islands"), Faulkner ("Intruder in the
Dust"), Carson McCullers ("The Member of the Wed
ding," "Reflections in a Golden Eye"), Camus ("The
Stranger"), Nabokov ("Lolita"), and many others — even
including Henry James, who might seem, at a cursory
glance, as unfilmable as Malcolm Lowry. But I do think
that there are some filmmakers whose styles and/or tem
peraments prevent them from doing justice to certain
writers (like Roman Polanski attacking Thomas Hardy),
and others who are immovably hampered by an inability
to understand the texts they seize upon. Five years ago,
those indomitable culture vultures, director James Ivory
and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, took Henry
James' "The Europeans," an explosively funny novel, and
turned it into a solemn costume drama — a graveyard.
This round — having employed the time in between to
misrepresent a small, fine tragic novel by Jean Rhys called
"Ouartet" in a blessedly short-lived movie version — they
have fastened their uncomprehending gaze on a much rich
er James work, "The Bostonians," in which he examined
the effect of the suffragette movement on men and wo
men in the last quarter of the 19th century. And the result
is a major folly in all respects but one, though not, it must
be said, as great a folly (or as infuriatingly boring) as
"Under the Volcano" was.
James constructed "The Bostonians" as a strange varia
tion on a Gothic romance set into a modern political
chronicle. The pure young Verena Tarrant, who speaks
with transcendent charm of the oppression of women —
she has the kind of star quality that creates fans and so,
her colleagues hope, will create converts — has attracted
the adoration of a southern gentleman, Basil Ransom,
who suffers from a combination of an antebellum cast of
mind and a postbellum sense of displacement. He is a
struggling young lawyer with little to offer her, but he
strives to rescue her (in his view) from the clutches of the
suffragettes, in particular Olive Chancellor, who has paid
off V'erena's parents to allow the young woman to live
with her, to develop under her tutelage into a public force
to be contended with. During the early 1880s, when he
was writing the novel, James suffered from what he saw as
his sister Alice's unhealthy attachment to a woman named
Katharine Loring, and he made Olive a possessive
spinster, prone to a kind of underplayed hysteria, and
drawn to Verena in a repressed lesbian bond — though
that is a term that a pre-Freudian novelist would never
have used (or, perhaps, even conceived of).
However, whatever autobiographical strains may be
present in "The Bostonians," James buried them under
layers of meaning; this novel is several novels at once. If
Basil and Verena are the white knight and damsel in
