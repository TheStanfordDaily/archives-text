# 'Bostonians' misrepresents Henry James novel, ideas
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
For years I have been listening to the claim that movies
based on material from other media — especially
literature — deserve to stand alone, on their own merits,
free from comparison with their sources. This resolution,
which I would call the "ignorance is bliss" argument,
pretends that the reconstituted version of an author's
work owes nothing to that author, and that people who
are serious about literature and film can discuss it without
reference to its original form. In a year that offers screen
versions of novels by Proust, James, Forster and Malcolm
Lowry, so radical a petition for the autonomy of film out
of literature should undergo careful re-examination, I
think. Would a review of John Huston's "Under the Vol

cano" omitting allusion to Lowry's novel make any sense?
Huston apparently believed he was serving Lowry (he
says "Under the Volcano" is his favorite book), so
shouldn't criticism of the picture, in order to justify itself,
attempt to address the ways in which he was (obviously)
mistaken? And if a director were arrogant enough to
transfer to film a novelist of Lowry's stature without actu
ally considering Lowry's vision, wouldn't a failure to hold
him accountable to the novel represent a kind of cultural
amnesia? We build our critical standards on what has
preceded; if we were to close our eyes to the past in art
every time we encountered something new, we would in
effect be razing our standards — even the idea of stand
ards — to the ground each morning.
A movie like "Under the Volcano" does double dis
service to Lowry, by making nonsense of his nightmarish
exploration of a great, sodden mind and by wrecking the
experience of the novel for viewers who come to the film
first. It is unlikely that anyone who has sat through Hus
ton's fiasco would rush to read the book, anyway; who
would elect to repeat the agony? But anyone who did
would find it difficult to immerse himself in Lowry's world
after seeing and hearing Huston's, however superior it
might be; movies have a stronger visceral pull on us than
novels do, and a movie version of a book, which has
reduced its length (400 pages in this case) and complexity
to something playable within two hours, has provided us
with a thickly underscored precis — a brightly marked
path through the (considerably tougher) reading process.
Even a good guideline ignores much of what the author
intended us to see and weigh, and a fraudulent one can
take us so far off course that even when we read the novel,
we're really entering something else entirely. A reader
coming to "Under the Volcano" after watching Huston's

version might well continue to believe that Lowry wrote a
story about a poor benighted consul whose wife and half
brother are so boring and shallow that he's become an al
coholic in self-defense.
I don't wish to imply that directors dealing with first
rate novels ought to be reverent and literal, or smother
their own sensibilities, or that there is only one way to in
terpret any work of literature, or — worse — that no one
should endeavor to reproduce great books on screen. We
have had memorable films of Dickens ("Great Expecta
tions," "Oliver Twist"), Hawthorne (" The Scarlet Let
ter"), Austen ("Pride and Prejudice"), Melville (much of
Huston's "Moby Dick," "Billy Budd"), Crane ("The Red
Badge of Courage"), Conrad ("Sabotage," "Razumov,"
"Outcast of the Islands"), Faulkner ("Intruder in the
Dust"), Carson McCullers ("The Member of the Wed
ding," "Reflections in a Golden Eye"), Camus ("The
Stranger"), Nabokov ("Lolita"), and many others — even
including Henry James, who might seem, at a cursory
glance, as unfilmable as Malcolm Lowry. But I do think
that there are some filmmakers whose styles and/or tem
peraments prevent them from doing justice to certain
writers (like Roman Polanski attacking Thomas Hardy),
and others who are immovably hampered by an inability
to understand the texts they seize upon. Five years ago,
those indomitable culture vultures, director James Ivory
and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, took Henry
James' "The Europeans," an explosively funny novel, and
turned it into a solemn costume drama — a graveyard.
This round — having employed the time in between to
misrepresent a small, fine tragic novel by Jean Rhys called
"Ouartet" in a blessedly short-lived movie version — they
have fastened their uncomprehending gaze on a much rich
er James work, "The Bostonians," in which he examined
the effect of the suffragette movement on men and wo
men in the last quarter of the 19th century. And the result
is a major folly in all respects but one, though not, it must
be said, as great a folly (or as infuriatingly boring) as
"Under the Volcano" was.
James constructed "The Bostonians" as a strange varia
tion on a Gothic romance set into a modern political
chronicle. The pure young Verena Tarrant, who speaks
with transcendent charm of the oppression of women —
she has the kind of star quality that creates fans and so,
her colleagues hope, will create converts — has attracted
the adoration of a southern gentleman, Basil Ransom,
who suffers from a combination of an antebellum cast of
mind and a postbellum sense of displacement. He is a
struggling young lawyer with little to offer her, but he
strives to rescue her (in his view) from the clutches of the
suffragettes, in particular Olive Chancellor, who has paid
off V'erena's parents to allow the young woman to live
with her, to develop under her tutelage into a public force
to be contended with. During the early 1880s, when he
was writing the novel, James suffered from what he saw as
his sister Alice's unhealthy attachment to a woman named
Katharine Loring, and he made Olive a possessive
spinster, prone to a kind of underplayed hysteria, and
drawn to Verena in a repressed lesbian bond — though
that is a term that a pre-Freudian novelist would never
have used (or, perhaps, even conceived of).
However, whatever autobiographical strains may be
present in "The Bostonians," James buried them under
layers of meaning; this novel is several novels at once. If
Basil and Verena are the white knight and damsel in

distress, and Olive the evil sorceress preying on the help
less maiden, then we must add that the book abounds with
predators — James' imagery gives Selah Tarrant,
Verena's father, Mrs. Burrage, the mother of her Harvard
suitor, and Basil himself vampiric qualities at different
points. Basil embodies the anger many men (including,
possibly, James himself) must have felt at the incipient
feminist movement, which he sees as a threat to what by
ancient right belongs to him (Verena), but there is some
thing cold and dark in Basil's determination to sweep
Verena away from Olive. James confounds our impulse to
read "The Bostonians" easily, as a Gothic, by making
Olive more sympathetic than we expect and Basil less so,
and by equalizing their holds on Verena. They are even
similar in surprising ways; both, for example, scorn the
age they were born into.
It doesn't take long to realize that there's something
wrong with the Ivory-Jhabvala film of "The Bostonians,"
even if you choose to disregard the puzzling opening
shots, behind the credits, of a faceless organist pulling the
stops and manipulating the pedals of the instrument while
we hear "God Save the Queen." (Perhaps the filmmakers
meant to suggest that as yet unseen forces were pulling
Verena's stops and manipulating her pedals? If so, the
heavy-handed image makes no impression.) In the first
major scene, a gathering at the home of an aging radical
named Miss Birdseye (Jessica Tandy) — James' version of
Elizabeth Peabody — to hear Verena speak, the impec
cably costumed actors render authentic Jamesian
dialogue, but it falls on dead air, like a community pro
; duction of a Restoration comedy. Cramped uncomfor-
I tably in a room most of them seem to have no business in
(Ivory never shows a trace of sense when it comes to
I staging), the supporting players tend to sound mannered
or anachronistic the moment they open their mouths —
except for Linda Hunt, who appears smilingly at home in
.the miniscule role of Dr. Prance, and Jessica Tandy,
whose failure to make Miss Birdseye the delightful comic
creature she is in James can't be blamed on her lack of wit
or intelligence. (She's directed to play her as a sweet old
dear, whose lines about the growing army of militant wo

men, which James meant ironically, have the sentimental
glow of a centennial tribute to the early feminists.)
James says of Verena Tarrant, "She had expressed her
self from the first word she uttered, with a promptness and
assurance which gave almost the impression of a lesson
rehearsed in advance. And yet there was a strange spon
taneity in her manner, and an air of artless enthusiasm, of
personal purity. If she was theatrical, she was naturally
theatrical." Somehow, in Madeleine Potter's perfor-

Redgrave has one amazing moment after another, but
you don't experience her performance as a series of
high points, because there's an unswerving intelligence
— a brilliance — moving through it.

mance, this gets translated into something sharply remi
niscent of a 1920s college musical-comedy heroine — a
cheerleader. Potter is pretty in a treacly, pink-and-white
way; when she talks she thrusts out her neck and puffs out
her apple cheeks, her voice breaks up in forced choked
sobs and tiny giggles, and her mouth melts a little every
time it moves, as if a cartoonist were erasing and altering
the line of her lips in each new frame. This Verena is a
pathetically insubstantial battleground for two opposing
powers — but then, Vanessa Redgrave as Olive Chancel
lor and Christopher Reeve as Basil Ransom aren't exactly
in tense opposition, because the filmmakers have
managed to reduce the novel's central conflict to that of
the Wicked Witch and Prince Charming. They haven't
reworked Olive, but they've taken out Basil's dark side,'
his fury — and therefore removed his dramatic sting.
Christopher Reeve speaks his lines in a wonderfully
funny, languid down-home accent, and I'm sure he does
what Ivory instructed him to do better than anyone else
could (he has an unerring comic sense), but really he's in
the wrong movie, through no fault of his own. (We have
no reason to think that Reeve couldn't have handled this

part the way James wrote it.) And when Basil doesn't
pose a threat, the contest between him and Olive col
lapses, and we wonder why in hell Verena takes the entire
length of the movie to leave her grasping, unstable woman
friend for the arms of Prince Charming.
I said that "The Bostonians" was a folly in all respects
but one; that exception — and it's a remarkable one — is
Vanessa Redgrave. Ivory and Jhabvala's inane rendition
of the struggle over Verena is as unfair to Redgrave as it is

to Henry James, but if the filmmakers don't understand
what the book is about, she does, and she counters their
foolhardiness by playing Olive with such piercing intelli
gence and rapt intensity that we can locate the entire
novel in her performance. She might have based it on
Basil's perception of Olive, early in the novel — "He was
sorry for her, but he saw in a flash that no one could help
her: that was what made her tragic" — because she
employs body and voice and a peerless emotional com
mand to show us the distance between what Olive desires
and the little she is capable of. She craves not just
Verena's undivided loyalty and bosom companionship,
but a sensual fulfillment she can't define, and more — to
be part of Verena, to share in her oratorical magic, and
even to be part of all women, in their suffering and their
struggle. Nothing less than all this will make her spiritually
complete, and so she is a tragic figure. You understand
Olive's anguish when you hear how Redgrave's voice
locks as she describes Verena's gifts to Mrs. Burrage
(Nancy Marchand), or the slightly off-pitch emotionalism
in her reading of a line like (to Verena), "I know that
many men would gladly stop your mouth by kissing

you;" when you see her clutching her breast as she swears
that she feels the women's cause "here, like a stain on
one's honor." (I can think of no other actress since Julie
Harris in her youth who could have found a dramatic in
terpretation for James' psychological description:
she saw the matter through a kind of sunrise-mist of emo
tion which made danger as rosy as success.")
Redgrave has one amazing moment after another, but
you don't experience her performance as a series of high
points, because there's an unswerving intelligence — a
brilliance — moving through it and making as many dis
coveries as there are scenes for Olive. She has a schoolgirl
eagerness with Verena at first, an almost physical horror
of masculine bad taste (when Verena asks her if she can
give a little extemporaneous speech to Henry Burrage and
his friend, guests at tea, Redgrave looks inexpressibly
pained, as if contact with these men would cause Verena
to shrink and decay), a rapturous appreciation of music
and art and literature — particularly the literature of her
"cause," which she sees as visionary art, the way a later
generation would see the proletarian writings of the De
pression. Redgrave even does what James must finally
leave to an actress: She sets Oliver Chancellor in her per
iod, and explains her relationship to it. In an almost silent
(and very short) scene, she writes out a check to Selah
Tarrant (that hopeless actor Wesley Addy, in a dreadful
fright wig) in her study; wearing spectacles and a cape
thrown backward around her neck like Isadora's scarf, she
attains that almost exotic look that fiercely radical women
have had in different eras, when a flamboyant non
conformity transforms eccentricity into an authentic style.
I've never seen anything quite like Redgrave's work
here, but I imagine Duse must have been like this— espe
cially in the scene in which Verena is late returning to
Olive's Cape Cod cottage and Olive roams the beach
frantically, convinced that her friend must have drowned.
Taking Olive's repression as far as James will let her, and
the passion underneath it even farther, Redgrave equals
her greatest performances — Isadora, Nina in "The Sea
Gull," Andromache in "The Trojan Women," Julia, the
musician in the concentration camp in the TV drama
"Playing for Time." And if she can't redeem the picture
(could even Duse have saved a movie that casts Wallace
Shawn as a character out of Henry James?), in the end she
makes it irrelevant, because you've finally seen nothing
except Vanessa Redgrave.
