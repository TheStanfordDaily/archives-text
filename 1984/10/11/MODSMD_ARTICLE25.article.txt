# 'A Soldier's Story' wretchedly acted

### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
I never saw "A Soldier's Play" on
stage, where I'm told the ensemble
acting of the original company made
it electrifying, but the movie (called
"A Soldier's Story") is insufferable
— and wretchedly acted.
Three of the members of the cast
(Adolph Caesar, Larry Riley and
Denzel Washington, who have three
of the four pivotal roles) appeared in
the show in New York, so perhaps
they're merely overrehearsed; in ad
dition, the director, Norman Jewison,
hasn't helped them to shape their
performances for the camera, so they
work up a stagey sweat that makes
the young actors in last year's
"Streamers" seem muted by compar
ison. (One performer, David Alan
Grier, is in both movies — that's a lot
of heat.)

Jewison is an old-fashioned direc
tor, and that has been a virtue on oc
casion — in his film of "Fiddler on
the Roof," and earlier, in his solidly
entertaining race comedy-mystery
"In the Heat of the Night," which he
borrows from at the beginning and
end of "A Soldier's Story." But with
material as stale as Charles Fuller's
script his straight-on approach
finishes the movie off. You feel
you're stuck in some glossy Holly
wood "problem" drama from the
year the picture is set in, 1944; Ful
ler's handling of racial issues (the
murder of a black non-commissioned
officer at a black army base in
Louisiana) predates even something
like the 1948 "Home of the Brave,"
which is still much more powerful.
The characters in Fuller's play wear
tags tied to their lines that brand
them as Liberals or Rednecks, Good
Negroes or Self-Hating Negroes, and

his messages come rattling through
like a rickety but reliable old
locomotive on the half hour: "Any
man don't know where he belong in a
whole lot of pain," "Who gave you
the right to judge who is fit to be a
Negro and who is not?," etc., etc.
Fuller won the Pulitzer Prize for this
shameless cant, following in the
footsteps of such dubious examples of
American dramatic writing as "That
Championship Season," "A Chorus
Line" and"The Gin Game"; among
the plays that failed to win Pultizers
are David Rabe's "The Basic Train
ing of Pavlo Hummel," Sam
Shepard's "The Tooth of Crime" and
anything by John Guare, our funniest
and most innovative playwright. If
the American commercial theater is
still creatively on its deathbed, as we
keep hearing it is, the Pulitzer com
mittee must be poking holes in its
oxygen tent.
