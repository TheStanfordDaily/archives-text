						question of priorities 
### 
I had some trouble deciding
what the subject of today's column
would be. It wasn't because I
didn't have enough possibilities. I
could always write about the
World Series, or the tragic case of
Rolando Navarrette, the former
World Boxing Council feather
weight champion who was sen
tenced to 20 years in prison for
rape.
Or I could have discussed the
Stanford football team. Or maybe
even pondered over the reasons
why only 50,000 people are ex
pected to attend this Saturday's
football game between the No. 2-
ranked University of Washington
and the improved Cardinal?
Which one of these did I pick?
None of them actually. I decided
to write about intramural sports.
Now comes the question:
What's so important about IM
sports? That's not an easy ques
tion to answer because there's not
really a way to measure the impor
tance of it.
There aren't any fans. There's
no money on the line. There's no
television contract or legal battle
over whether a university has the
exclusive rights to broadcast the
IM darts championship.
There isn't even a clear perspec
tive on what IM sports mean to
the people who participate. Some
people are just out to get some ex
ercise and have some fun. Some
people are out to wirf. sometimes
at any cost. A few people want to
win the IM Championship. Most
don't even know what that is.
But one important statistic does
demonstrate the importance of
I Ms. Each year, more than 6.000 stu
dents, faculty and staff participate
in a spectrum of events ranging
from football to foosball. That's a
lot of people.
In many ways. IM sports are
nearly as important to students as
varsity sports. At some univer
sities, that importance has been
recognized. At the University of
Texas, there is a large athletic
facility devoted entirely to IMs
and recreational athletics. It in
cludes eight full indoor basketball
courts, racquetball courts, weight
rooms and saunas.
The University of California at
Berkeley recently built a similar
structure called the Recreational
Sports Facility. The RSF includes
basketball, volleyball, racquetba/l

and squash courts, as well as
weight rooms. It's dedicated
primarily to club sports, IMs and
community recreation.
The demand for facilities like
the RSF is certainly different at
schools like Texas and Cal, if for
no other reason that they are
larger. But Stanford does have
roughly 12,000 students and an
other 2,500 in faculty and staff.
Therein lies the problem. Stan
ford does not have enough
facilities to suffice all the demands
of varsity athletics and recrea
tional athletics. This problem may
not be apparent during the IM
football season, because there are
(although just barely) enough
fields.
But indoor court space is at a
premium. Roble Gymnasium time
is divided between club sports,
martial arts classes, dance classes,
aerobics and then, when available,
recreational sports. When recrea
tional time is available, the court is
almost always filled with people
waiting to play and sometimes
these people don't get much op
portunity.
Maples Pavilion is no better. Its
small court space is open for
recreational basketball for one
hour a day. It is always crowded.
There is also a problem with
competition between varsity
sports, fellow varsity sports and
IM sports. At one point during the
spring, the men's volleyball team
had to play a home match against
then-No. 1-ranked UCLA at
Menlo College because another
varsity sport was at home.
What is extremely frustrating
about this situation is the con
tradicting statements the I have
heard from the Athletic Depart
ment and from the University.
Since I was a freshman in 1980,
I have heard that an athletic
facility was going to be built on the
space behind the Athletic Depart
ment and Encina Gym. Those
plans have always been on some
back burner and have never
materialized.
What did materialize, however,
is a 1,000-car parking structure
that was just approved by the
board of trustees. I think the Uni
versity has really got its priorities
straight. The people of this univer
sity really do need to better exer
cise their driving skills.
