### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's soccer team
ran its Pacific Soccer Conference
record to 2-1 and 6-4-3 overall with a
1-0 win over St. Mary's College yes
terday.
Stanford's goal came early in the
first half when Tom Rafalovich
headed in a free kick taken by Gian
carlo Ferruzzi. Rafalovich is now
Stanford's second leading scorer with
three goals and three assists for nine
points, behind Ferruzzi's 13 points on
three goals and seven assists.
St. Mary's came into the game last
in the PSC. The loss dropped its
record to 0-3 in the conference and 1-
6-2 overall.
Despite the Cardinal's early goal,
St. Mary's played Stanford even in
the first half and had its share of
scoring opportunities, including a
shot from close range that eluded
Stanford goalkeeper Willy Burkhardt
but missed the post by inches.
Stanford slowly took control in the
second half, though, dominating the
last 20 minutes of the game and

corded their third shutout of the
season. St. Mary's has scored only
four goals in nine games.
When asked what he thought about
the game, Stanford Head Coach Sam
Koch said, "Not much." The perfor
mances of two players stood out,
however. "Rob West played a good
game," Koch said. "And Todd
Rafalovich played well too, 1
thought."
West, a junior, has had to adjust to
midfield in the past three games be
cause of injuries to other midfielders
and Koch's decision to go with two
forwards instead of three.
Stanford's next game is at home at
Maloney Field this Saturday at 11
a.m. against U.S. International Uni
versity.
