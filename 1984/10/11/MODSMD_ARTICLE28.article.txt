# Padres even series at 1-1

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Kurt Bevacqua atoned for
a rally-killing blunder in Game One with a three
run homer, vaulting San Diego to a 5-3 victory over
the Detroit Tigers last night and a split of the first
two games of the 1 984 World Series.
The American League champion Tigers scored
three runs in the first inning off Ed Whitson, but
this time Padres Manager Dick Williams made his
move before it was too late. Williams removed
Whitson with one out left in the inning, and relief
pitcher Andy Hawkins turned giant-killer.
Hawkins, a part-time starter who had two com
plete games during the season, pitched five-and
one-third innings and gave up just one hit before he
gave way to left-hander Craig Lefferts, who started
the seventh.
The Padres, meanwhile, scratched back with a
run in the first on Graig Nettles' sacrifice fly and
another in the fourth on a fielder's choice grounder

by Bobby Brown that scored Bevacqua to make it
3-2.
Then, in the fifth, the Padres finally chased
Tigers starter Dan Petry, 18-8 during the season,
with Bevacqua's three-run homer. In San Diego's
3-2 loss in Game One, Bevacqua had run the
Padres out of a potential rally by stumbling while
trying to stretch a leadoff double in the seventh in
ning into a triple. But Williams kept his faith in the
37-year-old designated hitter and moved him up
three notches to sixth in the batting order.
His home run came after a walk to Nettles and a
bad hop single by Terry Kennedy on a shot that
bounced off second baseman Lou Whitaker's chest.
As he watched the ball sail into the left field
seats, Bevacqua jumped in the air and spun around
at first base. He pumped the No. 1 sign with a
finger as he rounded second, and as he trotted
around third, Bevacqua pressed both hands against

his lips and blew a kiss to the crowd of 57,911 at
Jack Murphy Stadium. Even in his moment of in
famy on Tuesday night, they had not booed him.
Now, they cheered him.
He wound up with three hits in the game, as did
teammates Alan Wiggins and Garry Templeton.
The victory kept the Padres alive as the Series
moves to Detroit for Games Three, Four and Five
tomorrow night and Saturday and Sunday.
Hawkins also pitched two scoreless innings in
Game One, giving up one hit in relief of starter
Mark Thurmond, who had struggled all evening
before leaving with the Padres behind 3-2. Haw
kins was nearly flawless again last night. He got the
last out in the first and retired 13 in a row before
Kirk Gibson led off the sixth with a bloop single to
left.
