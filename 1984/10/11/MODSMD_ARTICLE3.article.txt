# Searching for intellectualism
## Too much sun and fun at Stanford? 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
In his welcoming speech to the class of
1988, University President Donald Ken
nedy told the freshmen of a problem
facing their new school.
The concern centers on Stanford stu
dents' seemingly blithe acceptance of the
stereotype that Stanford is "academically
intense enough, but intellectually a bit
lazy, as though somewhat addled by the
sun," Kennedy said. This tendency to
"check all high-powered conversation at
the door" is stronger here than it is at East
ern schools, even though Stanford has the
"same quality of students."
Kennedy is not alone. Many University
officials and students say they share Ken
nedy's concern over the penchant students
here have for feigning uninterest in socie
tal concerns and issues of weighty intellec
tual matter outside of the classroom set
ting.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
says intellectual life here often conforms
to a "California Culture." The opportu
nity for outdoor activities such as tennis
and swimming abound even in mid-winter,
allowing students to engage in physical ac
tivity just as easily as in reading or dis
course.
Marshall's second point revolves around

the general background, both in family
and education, that students bring to col
lege.
"Harvard students are predominantly
from third- and fourth-generation
families, families which already have a
sense of financial security, and who aren't
devoted to making good in a particular
profession," he said. "Members of these
families have the time and money to buy
and read books for a hobby, and as a result
orient their children towards the same

kind of lifestyle."
Stanford students have equally affluent
parents now, Marshall says, but "the
money has only been in the family for one
generation, so the focus is still closely ori
ented toward making money, and not
toward reading and thinking. Plus, the din
ner table conversation is more likely to be
directed toward friends, personalities, or
what dad did at work today, as compared
to a discussion of The New York Times'
book review section or Churchill's writings
or whatever."
Marshall also said he feels Stanford's
policy to admit the most able high school
seniors with no importance given to their
intended majors plays a role in the intel
lectual life here.
"Due to accidents of history, we've got
strong programs in engineering, natural
sciences and in some social science depart
ments, but the number of students in the
humanities department is terribly low," he
said. "This is partly due to extremely
strong and able leadership in the former
schools, thanks to a distinguished line of
deans, but students in more
professionally-oriented departments are
not as likely to want to discuss life's
meaning or politics."
He said it would be a tremendous help if
Stanford could double the number of

humanities majors, resulting in more
evenly-mixed student interests in campus
living environments.
"Students in technical majors are cer
tainly not dumb, and if they were given
more exposure to a more introspective
style of discourse, some of it might rub
off," said Marshall.
He added that former Dean of Admis
sions Fred Hargadon lamented Stanford's
national image as a glorified technical
school. Hargadon once said that if Har
vard and Stanford had a one-to-one con
test for applicants, Stanford would win
more than 50 percent of the time in the
engineering and science areas, that the
University would hold its own in the social
sciences, and that Harvard would win out
among students interested in the
humanities.
Harvard juniors Amy Borovoy, a psy
chology major, and Bradley Nixon, an En
glish history/literature major, both re
ported that the general view by Harvard
students of Stanford is that "it is a mellow
place where people do a lot of sun wor
shipping. One wonders how rigorous it can
be with everyone running around in shorts
all the time around a lake named 'Lake.' "
"On the other hand," Borovoy said.
