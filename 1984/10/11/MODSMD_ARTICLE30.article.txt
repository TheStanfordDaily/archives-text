VFY recruits
Recruiting for the Stanford Volun
teers for Youth program will take
place tonight at 8 in the Old Union
Women's Clubhouse Alumni Room.
There are about 50 VFY programs
nationwide. The first program was
started at Stanford in 1969 as a re
search project by child psychologist
Stan Fischman.
Since then, VFY has spread to
campuses such as Cornell University,
Dartmouth College, Duke Univer
sity, Harvard University and Yale
University. The VFY program is
jointly sponsored by the Athletic De
partment at Stanford and on the na
tional level by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association.
VFY is a community program

whose goal is to help meet the per
sonal needs of youth.
Ice Hockey wins
The Stanford ice hockey team
opened its season on a winning note
Saturday in Los Angeles by defeating
the Pierce College Brahmas, 5-3.
Stanford dominated play from the
outset and led 3-0 at the end of the
first period on goals by Don Wil
coxen, Dave Wright (on a penalty
shot), and John Zierk.
Bill Mulroy scored in the second
period, but Pierce drew to within one
goal with three minutes remaining in
the game with late power play goals.
Wright iced the victory with an
empty-net goal with 30 seconds to
play.
