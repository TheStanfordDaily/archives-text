# Kennedy lauds service
## 
### DEBBIE CRANE 
University President Donald Ken
nedy was on hand to salute the public
service achievements of about 80 stu
dents at an Owen House reception
yesterday afternoon.
According to Kennedy, the pur
pose of the reception was "to thank
those students who have made com
mitments (to public service), and to
encourage more of the same." He
praised the efforts of students in
volved in the Stanford Volunteer
Network, Stanford-in-Government
and the Public Service Fellowships
program.
Catherine Milton, special assistant
to the president, said the reception
was an opportunity for students in
volved in public service to meet each
other and the faculty and staff who
are supportive of their efforts.
Milton, who is in charge of promot
ing and supporting public service
projects for the president's office,
said the reception "will help to end
the isolation some students involved
in public service feel."
Kennedy concurred and stressed

the importance of "students getting
together to share experiences."
The guests included the directors oi
the three programs which were being
specifically recognized and cele
brated.
Elizabeth Ehrlich, a student direc
tor of the Stanford Volunteer Net
work, was enthusiastic about the new
network, explaining that its basic pur
pose is to make it as easy as possible
for interested students to get involved
in a large array of public service proj
ects. "We are trying to make people
aware that there are a lot of commu
nity agencies which need our sup
port," she said. One major project
the group is working on is "Reach
Out Today." On Oct. 27 the group
will sponsor a day of service to the
community through group service
projects â€” encouraging dorms, fra
ternities, sororities and student clubs
to get involved.
Stanford-in-Government Chairman
Scott Reisch explained the objective
of his organization as exposing Stan
ford students directly to the world of
public service by helping them secure

internships both in Washington D.C.
and in local governments. Reisch,
who spent last summer interning at
the Veteran's Administration, found
that exposure to public service helps
to dispel a lot of the negative images
people have about government.
Reisch said he hopes to create bet
ter attitudes toward public service.
"So much in government is
worthwhile and rewarding" he said.
"Conceptions of government as lazy
bureaucrats just aren't true."
Participants in the Public Service
Fellowships program were enthusias
tic about their summer projects. The
funds awarded to the 14 students
went toward projects ranging from
creating a summer soccer clinic for
handicapped children, to researching
and publicizing pesticide use in the
Third World, to volunteering with
Mother Teresa at the Home for the
Dying and Destitute.
Mike Flaherty, a senior human bi
ology and public policy major in
volved with pesticide research, said
his experience "gave me insights

about myself and others."
The participants said they feel the
fellowship money is doing a great
deal of good in the community. "You
can't put a price on the positive im
pact you have on people's lives" ac
cording to Ricky Gease, a coun
selor/male role model for children of
battered wives at the Houston Area

Women's Center. The fellowship
winners said they also found their ex
periences to be personally rewarding.
Susan Rice, a junior History major
who served as assistant director for
the Black Student Fund, a small non
profit organization in Washington
D.C., hopes the fellowship program
will grow and expand.
