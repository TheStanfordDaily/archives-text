The first round of Tresidder Union renovations
is drawing to a close, and Union Director Ellie Op
penheim says she's glad to be out of "the bowling
business."
"Aside from some minor problems, 1 think we've
made really good headway," she said of the
revamping. "This could take three to five years to
complete. I'd be ecstatic if it could be in three. Like
everything, it depends on the money we get."
A majority of the changes that have already
taken place have occurred on the Old Union side of
the second floor. Originally slated for renovation in
1987, a series of unexpected events pushed the
timetable ahead.
The moving of Wells Fargo coupled with
travel service changes made second-floor renova
tions immediately necessary.
"We spent a year negotiating to come up with a
set of banking and travel services that would be
workable for the University community," Oppen
heim said. "Although we anticipated Wells Fargo
would eventually want to scale down its operation,
we didn't think they would want to change as soon
as they did."
Reflecting on the unprecedented lines that have
confronted banking customers since Wells Fargo's
move to smaller quarters, Oppenheim said, "It was
their decision to move. They didn't get pushed into
that small space. Hopefully some of the problems
will be resolved when additional automatic tellers

are installed later this year."
University officials had long known that Tresid
der would eventually have to expand.
"About four years ago we realized we had a
space problem," Oppenheim said. "We didn't have
enough room, and what we had was badly utilized."
At that time, a committee of students, staff mem
bers, and University officials formed to develop a
plan for modernizing the facilities. The committee's
work led to the adoption of the Tresidder Long
Range Space Plan in January 1983.
"One of our first priorities was combining the in
formation center and the ticket office in a new,
first-floor location," Oppenheim said. "This high
traffic location will be more convenient and practi
cal."
Another major change was the addition of a
computer center. The new facility, called the LOTS
Two Computer Cluster, is in the area previously
occupied by the bowling alley. The phasing out of
the lanes should not have been a surprise, accord
ing to Oppenheim.
"The usage numbers had dropped off drastically
since mandatory [physical education] was ended.
The lanes occupy the largest single space we have,
and we wanted to better utilize it for more heavily
used services."
Oppenheim called the computer facility
"temporary."
"We phased out the bowling alleys earlier than
planned only because the provost's office said, 'We

need LOTS space.' The computers will be removed
as soon as a permanent location is found," Oppen
heim said.
The Tresidder plan calls for the "reallocation" of
most of the space on the first floor.
Oppenheim said it will take 18 months "at
best" to come up with the money needed for these
changes.
"The plan calls for moving the Coffee House to
the LOTS area, then moving the Store into the
Coffee House's old location," Oppenheim said.
"They'll most likely be moved together to cause as
little inconvenience as possible."
A new travel service has also been brought in to
meet burgeoning University needs.
The American Express Travel Service now oc
cupies newly renovated offices on the second floor.
"I think we made a good change with the travel
service we offer now," Oppenheim said. "We
wanted to take advantage of the deregulation of the
airline industry to help hold down University travel
costs. We invited travel agencies to make
proposals, and eventually we came up with a com
prehensive travel program."
American Express will offer all members of the
Stanford community, including students,
guaranteed lowest air fares for world-wide travel,
traveler's checks with no service charge, hotel
reservations and special vacation packages. Amer-

LOTS terminals will replace the bowling alley after the remodeling of
Tresidder Union is completed.
ican Express will be open six days a
week, and together with Wells Fargo
makes for a "mini business and finan
cial center" on campus.
Second-floor construction has also
addressed the problem of inadequate
meeting-room space for a variety of
organizations. The smaller size of the
bank coupled with the elimination of
two ill-designed rooms enabled
Tresidder to add four new meeting
rooms, all renamed from numbers to
trees indigenous to the area, Oppen
heim said.
"If we can get the money, we'd like
to add additional rooms above the
deck area. We need more meeting
space," she said.
Tresidder, built in 1962, was con
structed to allow an addition above
the deck without major modifica
tions. Plans call for the construction
of a two-story addition to house
meeting rooms and more student or
ganization offices.

"The plan calls for moving the Coffee House to
the LOTS area, then moving the Store into the
Coffee House's old location," Oppenheim said.
"They'll most likely be moved together to cause as
little inconvenience as possible."
A new travel service has also been brought in to
meet burgeoning University needs.
The American Express Travel Service now oc
cupies newly renovated offices on the second floor.
"I think we made a good change with the travel
service we offer now," Oppenheim said. "We
wanted to take advantage of the deregulation of the
airline industry to help hold down University travel
costs. We invited travel agencies to make
proposals, and eventually we came up with a com
prehensive travel program."

LOTS terminals will replace the bowling alley after the remodeling of
Tresidder Union is completed.
ican Express will be open six days a
week, and together with Wells Fargo
makes for a "mini business and finan
cial center" on campus.
Second-floor construction has also
addressed the problem of inadequate
meeting-room space for a variety of
organizations. The smaller size of the
bank coupled with the elimination of
two ill-designed rooms enabled
Tresidder to add four new meeting
rooms, all renamed from numbers to
trees indigenous to the area, Oppen
heim said.
"If we can get the money, we'd like
to add additional rooms above the
deck area. We need more meeting
space," she said.
Tresidder, built in 1962, was con
structed to allow an addition above
the deck without major modifica
tions. Plans call for the construction
of a two-story addition to house
meeting rooms and more student or
ganization offices.
The first round of Tresidder Union renovations
is drawing to a close, and Union Director Ellie Op
penheim says she's glad to be out of "the bowling
business."
"Aside from some minor problems, 1 think we've
made really good headway," she said of the
revamping. "This could take three to five years to
complete. I'd be ecstatic if it could be in three. Like
everything, it depends on the money we get."
A majority of the changes that have already
taken place have occurred on the Old Union side of
the second floor. Originally slated for renovation in
1987, a series of unexpected events pushed the
timetable ahead.
The moving of Wells Fargo coupled with
travel service changes made second-floor renova
tions immediately necessary.
"We spent a year negotiating to come up with a
set of banking and travel services that would be
workable for the University community," Oppen
heim said. "Although we anticipated Wells Fargo
would eventually want to scale down its operation,
we didn't think they would want to change as soon
as they did."
Reflecting on the unprecedented lines that have
confronted banking customers since Wells Fargo's
move to smaller quarters, Oppenheim said, "It was
their decision to move. They didn't get pushed into
that small space. Hopefully some of the problems
will be resolved when additional automatic tellers

are installed later this year."
University officials had long known that Tresid
der would eventually have to expand.
"About four years ago we realized we had a
space problem," Oppenheim said. "We didn't have
enough room, and what we had was badly utilized."
At that time, a committee of students, staff mem
bers, and University officials formed to develop a
plan for modernizing the facilities. The committee's
work led to the adoption of the Tresidder Long
Range Space Plan in January 1983.
"One of our first priorities was combining the in
formation center and the ticket office in a new,
first-floor location," Oppenheim said. "This high
traffic location will be more convenient and practi
cal."
Another major change was the addition of a
computer center. The new facility, called the LOTS
Two Computer Cluster, is in the area previously
occupied by the bowling alley. The phasing out of
the lanes should not have been a surprise, accord
ing to Oppenheim.
"The usage numbers had dropped off drastically
since mandatory [physical education] was ended.
The lanes occupy the largest single space we have,
and we wanted to better utilize it for more heavily
used services."
Oppenheim called the computer facility
"temporary."
"We phased out the bowling alleys earlier than
planned only because the provost's office said, 'We

need LOTS space.' The computers will be removed
as soon as a permanent location is found," Oppen
heim said.
The Tresidder plan calls for the "reallocation" of
most of the space on the first floor.
Oppenheim said it will take 18 months "at
best" to come up with the money needed for these
changes.
"The plan calls for moving the Coffee House to
the LOTS area, then moving the Store into the
Coffee House's old location," Oppenheim said.
"They'll most likely be moved together to cause as
little inconvenience as possible."
