Shultz gives Duarte endorsement
SAN SALVADOR. El Salvador — Secretary of State George Shultz
yesterday delivered a message from President Reagan endorsing Sal
vadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte's offer to meet with leftist
rebels.
Although U.S. officials said the administration was initially skeptical
ot the move. Reagan, in the message, applauded the Salvadoran leader
"for his great courage and foresight" and turned Duarte's initiative into
a challenge to the leftist rulers of neighboring Nicaragua. "If only the
comandantes in Nicaragua would make the same offer to the resistance
forces there, we would all be much closer to true peace in Central
America," Reagan said.
Shultz. who met with Duarte during a four-hour visit here, said: "His
initiative has our unqualified support."
The statements appeared designed to put the United States squarely
behind peace negotiations in Central America during a U.S. election
year in which Democrats have charged Reagan with favoring military
force instead.
President attacks Mondale gaffe
WARREN. Mich. — President Reagan charged yesterday that Walter
Mondale "has made a career out of weakening America's armed forces"
and has "always found one reason or another for opposing vital weapons
systems and the modernization of our forces."
Reagan also seized on Mondale's remark in Sunday's debate that he
would "repeal" indexing of tax rates to inflation scheduled to start Jan.
1. Reagan charged that Mondale would raise taxes by $85 billion an
nually by 1989 and "leave a bottomless hole in the pockets of every
working man and woman in the country."'
A Mondale campaign spokesman said the Democratic nominee mis
stated his position on indexing in the debate. His September budget plan
called for implementation of indexing for those with incomes under
$25,000 a year and "deferral" for others.
The question of Reagan's physical and mental fitness for another term
lingered today as his personal physician. Dr. Daniel Ruge, said "I think
he was tired,'everybody was tired" during the debate. The White House
also released further details of laboratory studies from Reagan's physical
examination of last May 18, when Reagan was declared "a mentally
alert, robust man who appears younger than his age" by Navy Capt.
W.W. Karney, an internist who supervised the exam.
The president made light of questions about his age: "With regard to
the age issue and everything, if I had as much makeup on as he
(Mondale) did, I'd have looked younger, too."
Mondale calls Reagan's 'bluff'
PITTSBURGH — Walter Mondale, saying he had "called President
Reagan's bluff' on Social Security, yesterday challenged Reagan to
promise no reductions in Medicare and dismissed the president's claim
that Mondale looked better in Sunday's debate because he wore
makeup.
"That's the same answer that Nixon gave when he debated Kennedy,"
Mondale said before a boisterous crowd of more than 10,000 at a
noontime rally here. "Mr. President, the problem isn't makeup on the
face. It's the makeup on those answers that gave you a problem."
Mondale, buoyed by one of the biggest crowds of his campaign, also
countered Reagan's lighthearted challenge that the two candidates have
an arm-wrestling match, which Reagan suggested Tuesday to resolve
questions about his age.
"We had a little brain wrestle on Sunday night, didn't we?" Mondale
joked. "And in the next debate a week from Sunday, when we debate
foreign policy, he'll find that the issue that worries Americans is not
arms wrestling but the need for arms control."
After his rally in Pittsburgh, Mondale flew to New York, where he
met with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
LAPD makes major cocaine bust
LOS ANGELES — Police made the largest cocaine seizure in the
city's history — 372 pounds — and arrested a Colombian woman and a
Puerto Rican man yesterday, Police Chief Daryl Gates said.
Gates stood behind 169 plastic bags, each containing about one kilo of
what he described as "very high-grade stuff," at a news conference last
night.
He said the cocaine was worth at least $100 million when diluted for
street sales.
Despite efforts to stop the flow of cocaine from South America, "This
is proof that it's still coming in, and it's coming in in large amounts,"
Gates said.
Beatrice Ospina 38, and Jose Munoz, 36, were booked for investiga
tion of possessing cocaine for sale.
The pair, held in lieu of $2 million bond apiece, were arrested after
police were tipped that narcotics were being sold at a house in San
Dimas, about 25 miles east of Los Angeles, police said.
ACLU goes to bat for Ku Klux Klan
SAN FRANCISCO — The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit
yesterday against San Francisco Police Chief Cornelius Murphy to dis
cover why officials barred the Ku Klux Klan from staging a rally during
the Democratic National Convention.
"The method in which the police stopped the Klan group from pro
testing raises serious First Amendment questions," said ACLU spokes
man Amitai Schwartz. "The public has a right to know what happened
and why."
The group hopes the Superior Court suit will force police to disclose
videotapes and other information surrounding its refusal to allow the
Klan to stage a rally during this summer's convention, Schwartz said.
He said according to the California Public Records Act, the police de
partment has 10 days to release the records or justify withholding them.
According to the lawsuit, police arrested six Klan members and forced
them to drive to the police station for a videotape session.
No charges were filed against the group, but they were forced to leave
San Francisco, the suit contends.
Police officials declined comment on the suit until the document could
be reviewed.
Sky-high costs typical, critics say
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon could save at least $30 billion a
year — 30 percent of its weapons procurement costs — if defense con
tractors were more efficient, three Air Force management specialists
charged yesterday at a joint congressional hearing.
Recent cases of extraordinarily high prices for spare military parts —
such as a $7,063 coffee pot — are not isolated incidents but "are repre
sentative of overpricing in general," A. Ernest Fitzgerald, a longtime
Pentagon "whistle blower," told the Joint Economic Subcommittee on
international trade, finance and security economics.
Fitzgerald, Air Force management systems deputy, and his colleagues,
Thomas Anilie and Colin Parfitt, provided documented evidence of
what they said was overpricing in a report on six defense contractors'
pricing systems and formulas in selected programs. The contractors are
North American Rockwell, Lockheed Aircraft, Boeing Co., Pratt &
Whitney. General Electric and General Dynamics.
But in each case in the report, the contractors' names were crossed out
by Pentagon officials who designated the documents "for official use
only" shortly before the hearing.
