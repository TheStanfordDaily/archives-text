# Mondale trims Reagan lead
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Walter Mondale signifi
cantly improved his rating with voters by his per
formance in Sunday night's debate but did not im
mediately gain much ground on President Reagan,
the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll indi
cates.
In a trial heat. Mondale, who a majority of
viewers said won the debate, shaved three points
from Reagan's 18-point pre-debate advantage. The
Post-ABC poll completed Oct. 3 had given Reagan
a 55-to-37 percent lead. The survey taken Monday
and Tuesday nights gave the president a 56-to-41
percent lead.
But Mondale's personal rating with the voters
improved dramatically, as a sizable majority rated
him the winner of the debate. His favorable
unfavorable scores shifted from 41-to-49 percent
before the debate to 54-to-43 percent after it, a net
gain of 19 points.
Reagan's personal rating remains high, but the
past week has seen a narrowing of the gap between
the approval scores of Vice President George Bush
and his challenger. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (D-
N.Y.) who debate tonight in Philadelphia.
The three major networks will carry the debate
beginning at 6 p.m.
Ferraro comes into that contest as the untried
challenger against Bush, who was tested — and

bested — by Reagan in a half-dozen debates during
the 19H0 Republican race for the Republican
presidential nomination. But Democrats are
hoping that a strong performance from the tirst
female member of a major-party ticket will con
tinue the momentum they appear to have gained
from Sunday night's showdown between Reagan
and Mondale in Louisville.
Six in 10 of those polled said they saw at least
half the 100-minute confrontation, and 55 percent
said Mondale won. Only 18 percent said they
thought Reagan came out on top. The remainder
thought it was even or had no opinion.
There was some comfort for the Republicans in
the poll finding that Reagan's debate performance,
which campaign officials have said was disappoint
ing, did not immediately erode his public support.
His favorable-unfavorable score was 60-to-35 per
cent before the debate and essentially unchanged,
61-36 percent, 48 hours after the debate.
But Mondale's gains were striking, particularly
among male voters and independents. In both
groups, he turned strongly negative ratings into a
positive standing.
Perhaps aided by Mondale's coattails, favorable
unfavorable impressions of Ferraro climbed from a
narrow 44-to-42 percent positive in the pre-debate
poll to a 52-to-40 percent positive in the latest sur

vey. During that time, during which there was ex
tensive publicity about Bush s income tax pay
ments. Bush dropped from 60-to-28 percent posi
tive to 57-to-36 percent.
So they enter tonight's debate closer to parity
than they have been since the start ot the campaign.
The Post-ABC survey was based on call-backs to
1.035 people who had participated in an earlier
September poll. That technique allows examination
of shifts in attitudes among specific voters, and it
contains some hints of what could become a pro-
Mnndale trend.
About one of every six of those polled a second
time expressed a better opinion of Mondale after
the debate. Among only those voters, Reagan's
margin dropped from about a lead of about two to
one to about five to four. ITiat shitt was partially off
set by Reagan gains among the 9 percent who said
they thought worse of Mondale now. A lopsided
majority of the first group had watched the debate;
fewer in the second group had seen it.
Strategists and pollsters in the rival campaigns
said the Post-ABC results were similar to their own
post-debate findings, but they differed in their in
terpretations.
