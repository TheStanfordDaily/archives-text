# Congress agrees on catchall bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — After grudg
ingly dumping all water projects at
President Reagan's insistence but
also extending a ban on aid to
Nicaraguan rebels, congressional
negotiators reached agreement last
night on a catchall spending bill
needed to finance most of the govern
ment and to enable Congress to ad
journ for the year.
The agreement, breaking a tumul
tuous nine-day stalemate that caused
a brief shutdown of federal offices,
would extend the ban on aid to rebels
fighting Nicaragua's leftist govern
ment until Feb. 28. Then the new
Congress would vote whether to
release $14 million for the rebels, half
the sum sought by Reagan for the fis
cal year that began Oct. 1.
Wrapped into the catchall spending
measure was a sweeping anti-crime
package that includes broad reforms

of federal sentencing and bail
procedures.
The Senate and House planned to
complete action today both on the
$365 billion spending bill and on
legislation to raise the ceiling on the
national debt from $1.58 trillion to
$1.82 trillion. Passage of those bills
would clear the way for members of
the 98th Congress to close out their
business and go home for re-election
campaigns.
The deadlock on the spending
measure was broken when House
Democratic leaders proposed scut
tling $100 million worth of water
projects in the face of strong veto
warnings issued by David Stockman,
Reagan's budget director.
"We don't want to give the presi
dent an opportunity to veto that bill
. . . and blame the Democrats as big
spenders," House Speaker Thomas

"Tip" O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) said.
An angry Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-
Ore.), the chief Senate negotiator, re
luctantly agreed to go along with
stripping out the projects, one of
which was a navigation lock on the
Columbia River in his home state.
Besides water projects, the other
obstacle blocking agreement on the
bill was a dispute between Senate and
House conferees on an intercon
nected series of defense and foreign
policy issues.
Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and
Rep. Joseph Addabbo (D-N.Y.),
chairmen of the defense appropria
tions committees in each chamber,
struck this deal:
• On aid to Nicaragua rebels, the plan
for a vote next year on resumption of
$14 million in funding was a compro
mise between a permanent ban voted
by the Democratic-controlled House

and Reagan's $28 million request,
supported by the Republican
controlled Senate.
• On Reagan's space-based "Star
Wars" anti-missile program, the con
ferees agreed to spend $1.4 billion,
splitting the difference between
Reagan's $ 1.6 billion request and the
House-passed $1.1 billion.
• On the budding anti-satellite weap
ons program, the conferees agreed to
permit three tests in fiscal 1985 in
stead of submitting to the House
passed ban on testing and the Sen
ate's demand for two "successful"
tests.
• On a House-passed provision to
ban the use of U.S. combat troops in
El Salvador and Nicaragua, the con
ferees agreed to place non-binding
language in the bill that says Congress
opposes any such deployment.
