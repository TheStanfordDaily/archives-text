## San Francisco's restaurants in a stew over union pickets 
### VICKI COLVIN 
Thinking of planning a nice,
relaxed trip to the City for dinner?
Think again. You may be greeted by
a crowd of aggressive, chanting pick
ets.
Twenty-two of San Francisco's best
restaurants, primarily in the Fisher
man's Wharf area, have been affected
by a strike of Local 2, a division of the
Hotel Restaurant Workers and
Bartenders Union.
The three-year contract between
Local 2 and the Restaurant Associa
tion ran out a month ago, and since
then the union has begun to
selectively picket restaurants.
Twenty-one of the 23 restaurants
have chosen to break the picket. "I
only have a skeleton crew of five,"
said Frank DeNatale, owner of
Bruno's, "But I'm still operating."
All agree that the issue of health
and welfare benefits is a major one in
the dispute. For the past three years
health and welfare costs were $109
each year per employee. However, the
recent surge in medical costs could
cause this figure to double.
According to Barbara Lewis,
spokeswoman for the union, the
health issue must be solved. "We are
asking just for maintenance of our
health and welfare, " she said. "Our
experts predict increases of 12 to 14
percent over the next few years,
which works out to about $15 per
year."

The association, though, does not
want to cover any increase. "We have
agreed to pay health benefits, but we
will not pay for any increase, " said
Sam Kashajarian, owner of Polo's
restaurant. "The association has of
fered to pay $15, $20 and $25 for in
creases over the next three years, and
let the employees make up the differ
ence."
Wages, too, are a volatile issue. In
the last contract, union employees
had a 42 percent increase over three
years.
"We are asking for a moderate 9
percent increase this time," said
Lewis. "We've already settled with
one restaurant on this issue."
Of course, the Restaurant Associa
tion claims this request is a bit too
high. The association is offering a five
percent increase. "I understand their
(my employees') position, but they
just ask for too much money," said
Rudy Levino of Bardelli's.
Lewis said that the goal of the
union pickets is "to keep people out
of restaurants," and if not to com
pletely deter customers, then to at
least keep restaurant business down.
Several restaurants have had to ob
tain court restraining orders to keep
pickets quiet. "They can't forcibly
keep people out," said Victor Grotti,
owner of Ernie's. "It is the individ
ual's choice whether or not to cross

the picket line."
At this time, negotiations are at a
stalemate. Several packages intro
duced by the Restaurant Association
last week are awaiting union ap
proval.
Meanwhile, the strike is taking a
toll on all involved. "My business
hurts and my employees outside hurt
. . . for three weeks no wages, no
money for anyone," said Levino.

fected by the strike:
