# Congress nears adjournment
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The 98th Congress trudged
wearily toward belated adjournment last night after
giving final approval to a $370 billion, long
overdue spending bill for much of the government
that was stripped down to prevent a veto by Presi
dent Reagan.
Yesterday evening only a debt-limit extension to
keep the government from running out of credit
remained outstanding on the Senate floor before
the 98th Congress adjourned.
The debt ceiling measure, hung up in an unre
lated Senate fight over taxation of seller-financed
real-estate deals, would raise the government's
borrowing authorization to $1,824 trillion. The
government reached the current ceiling of $1,573
trillion Wednesday, and some securities sales have
been delayed.
Amid what Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.)
called the loud "rustle of airline tickets" among the
homeward-bound lawmakers, there were these
other developments:
• Congress officially abandoned hope of passing
landmark immigration revision legislation that
would have granted legal status to millions of illegal
immigrants. Although the bill had survived several
potentially lethal blows, it finally got trampled in
the rush for adjournment, the target of opposition
from unions, food growers and Hispanics, half
hearted support from the administration and
whole-hearted opposition from the Democratic na
tional ticket. Other measures that did not survive
the end of the session, were civil rights and
"Superfund" toxic-waste cleanup bills.
• Congress enacted legislation authorizing about
$9 billion in spending this year for the CIA and
other intelligence agencies. Although the figures
were classified, sources said the total represents an
increase of 20 to 25 percent over current spending.

The sources said the administration's request had
been cut by 8 to 10 percent.
• The Senate, voting 87-2, endorsed principles of a
35-year-old treaty outlawing genocide after putting
off ratification until next year because of filibuster
threats by conservative opponents.
• The Senate gave final approval by voice vote to a
bill guaranteeing Social Security recipients a cost
of-living increase in January, even if the rate of in
flation is insufficient to trigger the increase auto
matically.
• The House approved and sent to Reagan a bill
that sets federal standards for municipal regulation
of cable television.
• The House insisted on banning U.S. loans to the
South African government as part of legislation to
curtail export of strategic goods for foreign policy
reasons, thereby jeopardizing its final passage by
the Senate, which opposes the South African
restriction.
As the members headed home, they could look
back on a two-year Congress that began with pas
sage of major Social Security financing reforms and
a huge anti-recession jobs program and ended with
an ignominious financing snarl in which Congress
almost let the government run out of borrowing
and spending authority at the same time.
Between the start and finish, Congress enacted a
deficit-reduction "down payment" of nearly $150
billion in spending cuts and tax increases over three
fiscal years, cut back somewhat on Reagan's pro
posed military buildup and put varying degrees of
restraint on foreign policy ventures, ranging from
troop deployment in Lebanon to covert anti
government activity in Nicaragua.
It made Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a na
tional holiday and strengthened the Voting Rights
Act but refused to reverse a Supreme Court deci
sion narrowing the scope of federal anti

discrimination laws. It passed major wilderness
legislation but stalled over expansion of the Super
fund for cleanup of toxic waste. It passed major
anti-crime legislation but balked at most other fa
vorite causes of the New Right.
In all, it bucked most contentious issues over to
the 99th Congress, which officially convenes on
Jan. 3, although it will not begin serious business
until later that month.
Final passage of the roughly $370 billion catchall
spending bill called a continuing resolution oc
curred at midday when the Senate approved it by
78-11. The House voted 252-60 to approve the
measure late Wednesday.
As the Senate vote neared, Majority Leader
Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) told his colleagues he
had been authorized to say "the president will ap
prove this measure."
Earlier White House veto threats had prompted
House Democratic leaders and later House-Senate
conferees, after some stalling and grumbling, to
drop about $100 million in dams, ports and other
water projects that had raised administration ob
jections.
In return, the administration agreed reluctantly
to go along with a ban of at least five months on aid
to anti-government Nicaraguan rebels under condi
tions that make it unlikely that the moratorium
would be lifted.
The measure also includes a major anti-crime
package that Reagan had wanted, although it does
not go as far as he originally proposed .
Passage of the continuing resolution came only a
day before the government faced the possibility of
another partial shutdown, similar to the half-day
layoff caused by an earlier expiration of funding
authority last week.

fiscal years, cut back somewhat on Reagan's pro

troop deployment in Lebanon to covert anti
government activity in Nicaragua.

legislation but stalled over expansion of the Super

until later that month.

Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) told his colleagues he

layoff caused by an earlier expiration of funding
authority last week.

WASHINGTON — The 98th Congress trudged
wearily toward belated adjournment last night after
giving final approval to a $370 billion, long
overdue spending bill for much of the government
that was stripped down to prevent a veto by Presi
dent Reagan.
Yesterday evening only a debt-limit extension to
keep the government from running out of credit
remained outstanding on the Senate floor before
the 98th Congress adjourned.
The debt ceiling measure, hung up in an unre
lated Senate fight over taxation of seller-financed
real-estate deals, would raise the government's
borrowing authorization to $1,824 trillion. The
government reached the current ceiling of $1,573
trillion Wednesday, and some securities sales have
been delayed.
Amid what Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.)
called the loud "rustle of airline tickets" among the
homeward-bound lawmakers, there were these
other developments:
• Congress officially abandoned hope of passing
landmark immigration revision legislation that
would have granted legal status to millions of illegal
immigrants. Although the bill had survived several
potentially lethal blows, it finally got trampled in
the rush for adjournment, the target of opposition
from unions, food growers and Hispanics, half
hearted support from the administration and
whole-hearted opposition from the Democratic na
tional ticket. Other measures that did not survive
the end of the session, were civil rights and
"Superfund" toxic-waste cleanup bills.
• Congress enacted legislation authorizing about
$9 billion in spending this year for the CIA and
other intelligence agencies. Although the figures
were classified, sources said the total represents an
increase of 20 to 25 percent over current spending.

The sources said the administration's request had
been cut by 8 to 10 percent.
• The Senate, voting 87-2, endorsed principles of a
35-year-old treaty outlawing genocide after putting
off ratification until next year because of filibuster
threats by conservative opponents.
• The Senate gave final approval by voice vote to a
bill guaranteeing Social Security recipients a cost
of-living increase in January, even if the rate of in
flation is insufficient to trigger the increase auto
matically.
• The House approved and sent to Reagan a bill
that sets federal standards for municipal regulation
of cable television.
• The House insisted on banning U.S. loans to the
South African government as part of legislation to
curtail export of strategic goods for foreign policy
reasons, thereby jeopardizing its final passage by
the Senate, which opposes the South African
restriction.
As the members headed home, they could look
back on a two-year Congress that began with pas
sage of major Social Security financing reforms and
a huge anti-recession jobs program and ended with
an ignominious financing snarl in which Congress
almost let the government run out of borrowing
and spending authority at the same time.
Between the start and finish, Congress enacted a
deficit-reduction "down payment" of nearly $150
billion in spending cuts and tax increases over three
fiscal years, cut back somewhat on Reagan's pro
posed military buildup and put varying degrees of
restraint on foreign policy ventures, ranging from
troop deployment in Lebanon to covert anti
government activity in Nicaragua.
