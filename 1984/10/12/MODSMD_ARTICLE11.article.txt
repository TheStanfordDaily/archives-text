## Community feels loss of physical therapy center 
### CARMEL GRANGER 
Nearly every type of physical rehabilitation uses
physical therapy. Many accident victims, disabled
children and stroke victims, as well as patients with
multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, nerve injuries
amputations, fractures and arthritis have had their
quality of life improved by the work of physical
therapists.
On Aug. 31, 1985, the Division of Physical
Therapy at the Stanford Medical School, a program
recognized nationally for its excellence in educa
tion, will be discontinued.
The official decision was made last November by
former Provost Albert Hastorf, in accordance with
the recommendations of an ad hoc advisory com
mittee.
Former medical school Dean Dominick Purpura,
who was instrumental in the decision, attributed it
to budgetary constraints that required that
"everything the medical school does must have a
clear relationship to its core academic programs.
"Considering the many priorities of the medical
school in relation to available budgets, it would
have been irresponsible for me to recommend to
continue it,"he said.
There are two physical therapy programs at
Stanford, an entry level master's degree program
for students beginning in physical therapy and a
post-professional master's program for physical
therapists interested in pursuing advanced graduate
work.
There are 70 students currently enrolled in the
programs. When these students graduate, the pro
gram will close officially.
Those affected by the decision include eight full
time faculty, two part-time lecturers and four staff
members.
Although nearly a year has passed since the deci
sion was made to end the program, frustration and
confusion still exist.
The frustration is felt by several members of the
community who believe in the excellence of the
program.
In 1977, graduates of the Division of Physical

Therapy occupied faculty posts in more than 40
percent of the schools of physical therapy in the na
tion and directed 17 percent of those programs.
Members of the community have also expressed
concern about the lack of physical therapists in this
country, especially in California, a shortage which
will become more critical with the closing of Stan
ford's program.
Jane Hartsook, who graduated from Stanford's
physical therapy school in 1946 and now shares a
private office with her husband, expressed concern
about this shortage.
"Since 1950, I've felt that physical therapy needs
more schools. Everyone has had to struggle. It's a
real dilemma," she said. "Now, at the end of this
school year the program will be discontinued, and
there will be 70 students a year who will not turn
into physical therapists."
"It's a crisis state," she continued. "There won't
be enough to treat the population."
Hartsook has not been content simply to com
plain about the situation. She is currently working
with John Medeiros, director of the Division of
Physical Therapy, and with others to establish a
new school of physical therapy in the Northern Cal
ifornia area.
According to Medeiros, there is a 90 percent
chance that a new school will open in the area. Al
though no official declaration has been made, the
University of the Pacific in Stockton is considering
housing the school, Medeiros said.
The efforts of the foundation that has been
formed to establish the new school are twofold. Its
first function, an academic one, is to communicate
to various universities in the area the need for the
program.
The second function is to raise the necessary
funds. According to Hartsook, the foundation
needs $4.5 million.
"This would be a major commitment for any uni
versity, and this is a problem, with funds being
cut," Medeiros said.
Besides frustration about the lack of physical
therapists, those affected by the decision are angry

and confused about both the manner in which the
decision to discontinue the program was made and
the reasons behind the decision.
One complaint is that the original decision was
made at a medical school meeting called for a dif
ferent purpose and was then ratified three weeks
later, before the faculty of the physical therapy pro
gram had been warned of the possibility of the pro
gram's curtailment.
No representative of the physical therapy pro
gram was present when the decision was made.
After this decision was publicized, an ad hoc
committee was formed to reconsider the issue. But
half of this committee consisted of members of the
original committee which had voted unanimously
to end the program.
In a letter of November, 1983, from D.C. Phil
lips, president of the Stanford chapter of the Amer
ican Association of University Professors, to Has
torf, Phillips expressed dissatisfaction with the way
the situation had been handled, saying that the
steps taken to close the program were not along the
guidelines set up by the AAUP. He called the ad
hoc committee extraordinarily "post-hoc," and
accused it of lacking broad or fair representation.
Critics of the program's termination were upset
over what they said were inadequate explanations
for the decision.
In Phillips' letter to Hastorf, he asserts that the
reasons for the decisions were never made
"unambiguously clear." He stated that according to
the AAUP guidelines, the financial situation of the
school was not severe enough to warrant its closing.
"That a program with such a fine internal and ex
ternal reputation (as borne out by several evalua
tions over the past decade) can be discontinued for
muddled or nefarious reasons is an intolerable af
front to academic freedom, and must be viewed as
a matter for serious concern," Phillips wrote.
The general assumption has been that the pro
gram will be discontinued because it does not focus
on research, which University President Donald
Kennedy has called a "guiding principle of Stan
ford Medical School."
