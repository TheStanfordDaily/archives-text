Reminiscent of Pavlov's dog, students are now
salivating to the sound of a new bell.
The new Validine meal card machines installed
by University Food Service welcome students to
dinner with a click and a ding. The new system
has created greater flexibility both for students
and food service workers. Students with the new
cards can avail themselves of food sevice not only
in all of the dorms but also at eight row houses
and Sterling Quad, where students previously had
to turn in meal exchange cards.
Though students have accepted the new meal
system, we can't help but feel that we should see
more benefits for students in the approximately
$50,000 updating of the old system. New meal
cards should be only the first step in a plan to give
food service an overhaul.
Unfortunately, this isn't the case. Maxine An
derson, manager of University Food Service, says
she will see how the current system works before
thinking of anything else.
If there are funds for and an attitude open to
change, a more comprehensive plan — one that
attempts to deal with some of the widespread dissat
isfaction with the current meal service — makes
sense.
A simple reform to implement would be to al
low students to bring guests on their meal plan.

Since we already have the machines to count
meals, students should be able to get full value
for their plans.
Which brings us to the all-consuming questions
about food service: its cost. Why are the 10 and
14 meal plans only slightly cheaper than the 19
meal one? Are the 10 and 14 mealers subsidizing
the breakfast of the others? Why are students
paying nearly $7 a meal when they could pick up
similar or better fare elsewhere for less than half
of that?
Basically, what we are looking for is more ver
satility and choice. There is no reason why stu
dents should have to buy a University meal plan.
There should be more eating options. There
should be places on campus, like snack bars,
which accept meal cards of those students who
may have missed a meal or who may just want a
change. These work very effectively at other
schools.
Food service has made a change. We can only
hope that it continues moving forward by ad
dressing some of the concerns of the students.
Perhaps someday soon food service will be able
to stand on its own feet and attract students on
merits such as food quality, convenience and
reasonable pricing instead of forced subscription.
