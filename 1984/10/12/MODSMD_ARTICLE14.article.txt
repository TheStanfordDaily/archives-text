## Collectivism remembered 
### 
It is 1984, and lest we forget, we
have the media's incessant barrage of
features on George Orwell's "1984"
to remind us. Yet, in the fury, surpris
ingly little attention has been paid to
the 40th publication anniversary of
Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek's
classic "The Road to Serfdom." a
book which markedly influenced Or
well's writing.
"The Road to Serfdom" was
reviewed by Orwell for a leading

VIEWPOINT

British Sunday newspaper. The Ob
server, shortly after the book's
publication in 1944. While not in
total agreement with Hayek's thesis,
which details the dangers of collec
tivism, Orwell described it as "an ele
gant defense of laissez-faire
capitalism."
Later in the review he adds. "...
collectivism is not inherently demo
cratic but, to the contrary, gives to a
tyrannical minority such powers as
the Spanish Inquisitors never
dreamed of."
Though it would be false to claim
that Hayek's work was entirely re
sponsible for inspiring Orwell to
seclude himself in Scotland to write
"1984," his influence, not only on
Orwell but on the entire intellectual
and political community, was im
mense.
Much to Hayek's surprise, "The
Road to Serfdom" was an instant hit
both in America and England. What
was originally intended solely as "a
warning to the socialist intelligentsia
of England," became the first con
densed book to appear on page one
of Reader's Digest magazine, subse
quently selling out the off-prints, a
rare feat. Within two years of
publication, Hayek's message had
reached millions.
It has since been translated into 16
languages including, recently, Rus
sian and Polish. Most important,
Hayek's book has profoundly in
fluenced many of the world's leaders:
from Churchill and Erhard in the

post-war era, to Reagan and
Thatcher today, to those who have
shaped the economic policy of the
few lesser-developed countries to
emerge from poverty such as Sin
gapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. It is
clearly a book which, in 1984,
deserves careful attention.
At the time of publication, and
continuing today, "The Road to
Serfdom" sparked fierce discussions
between advocates of a planned eco
nomy and those who favor a free soci
ety. Hayek offers extensive warnings
against the dangers of central plan
ning, planning with the goal of replac
ing market solutions and results.
Hayek argues that in a collectivist
economy the individual becomes little
more than a means to "higher" ends.
As Orwell echoed shortly after
reviewing Hayek's book, it is a com
mon, even dangerous, fallacy that
"under a dictatorial government you
can be free inside." Rather, the gov
ernment, sometimes subtly,
sometimes brutally, coerces the indi
vidual to alter his wants and desires to
accord with those of the ruling body,
thus offering merely the illusion of
freedom.
The most important change occur
ring through extensive government
control is not economic, or even poli
tical, but psychological, what Hayek
calls "an alteration in the character of
the people." Slowly the people give
up their individuality until they are
just a part of the collectivist mass.
It becomes clear that the political
ideals of a population and its attitude
toward authority are as much an ef
fect as a cause of political institutions.
Even a strong political tradition of
fers no safeguard against new institu
tions and policies which work to
undermine, and therefore destroy,
the spirit of liberty.
Hayek claims that no variety of
socialism, no matter its name or
however modified by adjectives, can
posit any adequate provision for the
preservation of political and eco
nomic freedom. In fact, he strongly
believes that a socialist state in

evitably leads to a totalitarian regime.
"The Road to Serfdom" was signif
icantly dedicated "to the socialists of
all parties." Though it aimed to ex
plain the revolution of the Nazi gov
ernment in Germany, it served as a
general denunciation of the inherent
power of the collectivist state. And in
light of the evidence of the last 40
years, Hayek's thesis seems to main
tain its validity.
But Hayek's book is more than a
political treatise. Hayek has never
been bound by any single discipline.
And here he offers keen economic
analysis showing that the central
problem of economics is how the
spontaneous interaction of a number
of people, each possessing only lim
ited knowledge, creates an overall or
der that could seemingly occur only
through someone possessing the
combined knowledge of all these in
dividuals.
It is a problem that boggles the
mind, yet Hayek demonstrates that
the price system is the only mecha
nism capable of communicating such
information. The price system func
tions as a network of signals that al
lows us to adapt to unfamiliar
conditions under imperfect circum
stances.
The central problem of economics
is how the spontaneous interaction of
a number of people, each possessing
only certain bits of knowledge,
creates circumstances that could be
brought about only by somebody who
possessed the combined knowledge
of all these individuals. Our whole
modern order and well-being rest on
the possibility of adapting to
processes that we do not know.
Where Orwell's novel was a work of
fiction, "The Road to Serfdom" was
what the author described as "a
genuine search for truth." In perhaps
a more subtle way than Orwell's,
Hayek's work and influence have en
lightened us to the realities of the col
lectivist state.

calls "an alteration in the character of

up their individuality until they are
just a part of the collectivist mass.
It becomes clear that the political
ideals of a population and its attitude
toward authority are as much an ef

Hayek claims that no variety of
socialism, no matter its name or

posit any adequate provision for the
preservation of political and eco

believes that a socialist state in

"The Road to Serfdom" was signif
icantly dedicated "to the socialists of
all parties." Though it aimed to ex

ernment in Germany, it served as a
general denunciation of the inherent
power of the collectivist state. And in
light of the evidence of the last 40
years, Hayek's thesis seems to main

But Hayek's book is more than a
political treatise. Hayek has never
been bound by any single discipline.
And here he offers keen economic
analysis showing that the central
problem of economics is how the
spontaneous interaction of a number
of people, each possessing only lim
ited knowledge, creates an overall or
der that could seemingly occur only
through someone possessing the
combined knowledge of all these in
dividuals.
It is a problem that boggles the
mind, yet Hayek demonstrates that
the price system is the only mecha

lows us to adapt to unfamiliar
conditions under imperfect circum
stances.
The central problem of economics
is how the spontaneous interaction of
a number of people, each possessing
only certain bits of knowledge,
creates circumstances that could be
brought about only by somebody who
possessed the combined knowledge
of all these individuals. Our whole
modern order and well-being rest on
the possibility of adapting to
processes that we do not know.
Where Orwell's novel was a work of
fiction, "The Road to Serfdom" was
what the author described as "a
genuine search for truth." In perhaps
a more subtle way than Orwell's,
Hayek's work and influence have en
lightened us to the realities of the col
lectivist state.

It is 1984, and lest we forget, we
have the media's incessant barrage of
features on George Orwell's "1984"
to remind us. Yet, in the fury, surpris
ingly little attention has been paid to
the 40th publication anniversary of
Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek's
classic "The Road to Serfdom." a
book which markedly influenced Or
well's writing.
"The Road to Serfdom" was
reviewed by Orwell for a leading

VIEWPOINT

British Sunday newspaper. The Ob
server, shortly after the book's
publication in 1944. While not in
total agreement with Hayek's thesis,
which details the dangers of collec
tivism, Orwell described it as "an ele
gant defense of laissez-faire
capitalism."
Later in the review he adds. "...
collectivism is not inherently demo
cratic but, to the contrary, gives to a
tyrannical minority such powers as
the Spanish Inquisitors never
dreamed of."
Though it would be false to claim
that Hayek's work was entirely re
sponsible for inspiring Orwell to
seclude himself in Scotland to write
"1984," his influence, not only on
Orwell but on the entire intellectual
and political community, was im
mense.
Much to Hayek's surprise, "The
Road to Serfdom" was an instant hit
both in America and England. What
was originally intended solely as "a
warning to the socialist intelligentsia
of England," became the first con
densed book to appear on page one
of Reader's Digest magazine, subse
quently selling out the off-prints, a
rare feat. Within two years of
publication, Hayek's message had
reached millions.
It has since been translated into 16
languages including, recently, Rus
sian and Polish. Most important,
Hayek's book has profoundly in
fluenced many of the world's leaders:
from Churchill and Erhard in the

post-war era, to Reagan and
Thatcher today, to those who have
shaped the economic policy of the
few lesser-developed countries to
emerge from poverty such as Sin
gapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. It is
clearly a book which, in 1984,
deserves careful attention.
At the time of publication, and
continuing today, "The Road to
Serfdom" sparked fierce discussions
between advocates of a planned eco
nomy and those who favor a free soci
ety. Hayek offers extensive warnings
against the dangers of central plan
ning, planning with the goal of replac
ing market solutions and results.
Hayek argues that in a collectivist
economy the individual becomes little
more than a means to "higher" ends.
As Orwell echoed shortly after
reviewing Hayek's book, it is a com
mon, even dangerous, fallacy that
"under a dictatorial government you
can be free inside." Rather, the gov
ernment, sometimes subtly,
sometimes brutally, coerces the indi
vidual to alter his wants and desires to
accord with those of the ruling body,
thus offering merely the illusion of
freedom.
The most important change occur

control is not economic, or even poli
tical, but psychological, what Hayek
