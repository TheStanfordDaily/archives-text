## 'I U.S.'? 
### 
At dinner the other night, I was talking to a Reagan
supporter. Despite the fact that she disagreed with Reagan on
almost all issues, and even admitted that he "has no
brain," she said she was going to vote for him because he
demonstrated "leadership," as opposed to Walter
Mondale, whom she apparently saw as some sort of
walking jellyfish.
This kind of attitude is common these days — Reagan is
a leader, makes people feel good, allows them to read
Time's "I V U.S." issue without blushing. All this is
true. But at the risk of being a spoilsport, I think it's im
portant to ask ourselves why Reagan makes us feel good
and where he is leading us.
Let's look at the Reagan puzzle one piece at a time, and
then put them all together and see what it looks like.
Reagan stands for Americanism. He promises an
America in which every day is the Fourth of July. And his
popularity climbs parallel to the curve of what tren
dologists call the New Patriotism. The most prominent
display of this was, of course, the Olympics. Mondale said
we "won" the Olympics — we certainly took the gold in
jingoistic announcing and mass chanting. America ap
peared to trounce the world, and we felt good about that.
One cannot talk about Reagan-style patriotism,
however, without talking about its official expression:
militarism. The invasion of Grenada was Reagan's
proudest day: all the "thrill of victory without having it
drag on and on like a real war. It pays to make sure your
enemies have one-half of one-tenth of 1 percent of your
population.
I think the invasion of Grenada was a travesty (and the
U.N. agrees); many others will defend it. But justified or
not, the point is that America got a kick out of going into a
tiny country with guns blazing and wiping it up. At best,
Grenada might have been a regrettable necessity; instead,
it was treated as though every football team in America
had just won the Super Bowl.
To Reagan, nuclear missiles are just like gold medals —
having a lot of them is good because if you have more,
then you are winning. U.S. foreign policy seems to consist
of little but the accumulation of armaments, which are
treated as ends in themselves. They didn't help in
Lebanon, or Central America, or Poland or the Falkland
Islands, but nevertheless they give Americans a sense of
power and security.
Reagan also calls for a return to "traditional values":
He wants constitutional amendments banning abortion
and allowing organized prayer in schools.
Reagan's rhetoric about abortion is pro-life. But the
fact that he supports restrictions on teenage contraception
indicates that he is not so much pro-life as anti-sex.

Reagan is against homosexuals, against the Equal Rights
Amendment, against working women (this is known as being
"pro-family"). Reagan and the New Right stand for sexual
repression (at least for women who are forced to bear the
consequences) and traditional roles for both men and wo
men. This idea, too, is appealing to many Americans.
Similarly, the school prayer crusade appears to have
less to do with religion than with making sure that every
one professes the same beliefs at the same time.
"Voluntary" prayer means that those who don't share the
faith of the majority have to mark themselves as deviants.
Sadly enough, I think another large source of Reagan's
support is a hidden racist agenda. When Reagan talks
about welfare cheaters and the undeserving poor, he's
sending a subtle message to his white supporters, many of
whom see blacks in those terms. And when Reagan sug
gests tax breaks for segregated schools, he makes his sym
pathies clear to those who fear the rise of black political
power.
Reagan will deny that he is playing to such fears, but it's
no accident that he is opposed by 85 percent of black
voters. They see the signals Reagan is putting out;
see them too, though they may not care to admit it.
We've got just about all the pieces now, and the picture
is beginning to appear: What sort of politics is based on
nationalism, militarism, moralism and racism? Don't an
swer until we put in the last piece: Ronald Reagan him
self.
Reagan is America's father figure: a benign yet power
ful national dad. He has led America out of a period of
despair and hopelessness into a supposed golden era of
strength and prosperity. In times of social change and eco
nomic stress, people tend to turn to authority figures as
leaders — the "Man on Horseback" was popular long
before Reagan. When people feel powerless, they identify
with a figure of power.
Reagan — the charismatic authority figure — com
pletes our picture puzzle. What we are witnessing in
America today is a phenomenon disturbingly similar to
the rise of fascism in pre-war Europe. It takes many of the
same forms and springs from the same psychological
roots. The word "fascist" scares people — it sounds
paranoid and extreme — but I can't think of a more accu
rate word to describe the irrational appeal that Reagan
has for America.
Americans feel good about themselves, and there's
nothing necessarily wrong with that. But watching the
Olympics of 1984,1 kept hearing echoes of Berlin in 1936
and wondered, as I often do, where Reagan is leading
America.
