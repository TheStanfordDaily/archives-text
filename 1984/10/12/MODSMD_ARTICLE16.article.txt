## Editorial unfair 
### 
The editorial entitled "No union
busting," in The Daily of Oct. 11,
takes the position that Stanford
workers should vote in favor of repre
sentation by United Stanford
Workers, Local 680, and argues that

VIEWPOINT

the benefits now enjoyed by Stanford
employees are largely the result of
union efforts.
I happen to disagree with both
those positions, but they are certainly
not unreasonable ones. Indeed, it is
over these very issues that the elec
tion will probably be decided. Stan
ford is taking the position that it has
treated unrepresented workers well,
and that this particular union has not
been in the best interest of members
of the bargaining unit. That is what I
meant when I told the Faculty Senate
that we would "run on the record."
So far, what we have is a legitimate
disgreement, but the editorial goes
beyond the merits of the issue, and
makes the ad hominem suggestion
that it is somehow inconsistent of me
to favor such "enlightened liberal"
values as open discussion, diversity
and public service and, at the same
time, oppose representation by a par
ticular union in a particular election.
That strikes me as both unfair and ir
rational.
In addition to the values men
tioned, there is another one for which
I have often argued: it is the impor
tance of thinking through one's own
position on each case according to its

own merits, setting aside doctrine and
rhetoric. The fact is that neither I nor
this administration have taken a posi
tion against unions generally. What
we have done, and what we are
obliged to do, is to take a position re
garding the merits of this particular
representation. To call that "union
busting" is to accept the premise that
under all possible circumstances, in
all possible settings, union represen
tation is always better than non-

representation. Even most of us
"enlightened liberals" don't believe
that is true!
In its closing paragraph, The Daily
editorial says "we hope University of
ficials behave reasonably in the event
of a USW victory and begin dealing
with the union in a responsible man
ner." We think we have been dealing
responsibly all along: Indeed, our ac
tions have brought about an election
whereby Stanford workers can exer
cise their choice. If their choice is for
representation, then we shall bargain
in good faith with that representative.
