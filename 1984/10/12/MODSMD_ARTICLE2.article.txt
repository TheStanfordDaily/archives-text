# Faculty affirms research policies

### JEANNE COOPER Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday reaffirmed the
University's policy not to restrict research based on
its possible end uses.
Following a lengthy discussion by an unusually
high turnout of faculty members and guests, the
senate voted to approve all four policy proposals
presented by the Committee on Research (C-Res).
Besides upholding the University's research
guidelines, the committee also recommended that
the University 'make reasonable efforts to find ac
ceptable alternative employment within Stanford"
for staff members who would have to participate in
research they found "morally objectionable."
The senate also agreed with C-Res's final two
proposals that academic departments should in
form prospective graduate students of potential
funding sources in addition to research options, and
that the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
should determine how their contractual obligations

affect the academic freedom of their staffs. The two
organizations will report their findings by the end
of winter quarter.
The senate had charged C-Res to study Univer
sity policy last year after staff scientists at SLAC
protested the use of their facility by SSRI for basic
research with nuclear-weapons applications. In
February, 1983,15 faculty and 280 staff members
at SLAC decried their "involuntary servitude" for
SSRL work with results they found morally objec
tionable.
According to SLAC Director Burton Richter,
four of the five researchers who were the principal
protesters have since been able to find alternate
projects within the University, while the fifth has
left SLAC for a position elsewhere.
According to C-Res chairman David Korn, new
dean of the Stanford Medical School, the commit
tee "wrestled long and hard, well into June with is
sues considered very substantial and complex"
before deciding "research could not be monitored
because of the nature of science itself."

The group then voted 8-2 to "reaffirm Stanford
University's existing policy in research that
freedom of inquiry and expression of final results
should not be abridged by speculations concerning
political or moral impropriety of the uses which
might be made of the results."
Mary James, a graduate student in physics, sum
marized the minority position for the senate: "The
model for the university was traditionally a collec
tion of scholars with individual interests, engaged
in social criticism, with freedom to study what they
wanted. Academic freedom was important to
protect scholars from the wrath of their colleagues
or the institution. Our present guidelines reflect
that model.
"The institution I see today is very different,"
she said. "(The) large-scale contract research, with
millions and millions of dollars, places tremendous
pressures on researchers. Many scholars here have
different commitments to other than individual re-
