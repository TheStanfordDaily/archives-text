# Faculty affirms research policies
## 
### JEANNE COOPER Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday reaffirmed the
University's policy not to restrict research based on
its possible end uses.
Following a lengthy discussion by an unusually
high turnout of faculty members and guests, the
senate voted to approve all four policy proposals
presented by the Committee on Research (C-Res).
Besides upholding the University's research
guidelines, the committee also recommended that
the University 'make reasonable efforts to find ac
ceptable alternative employment within Stanford"
for staff members who would have to participate in
research they found "morally objectionable."
The senate also agreed with C-Res's final two
proposals that academic departments should in
form prospective graduate students of potential
funding sources in addition to research options, and
that the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
should determine how their contractual obligations

affect the academic freedom of their staffs. The two
organizations will report their findings by the end
of winter quarter.
The senate had charged C-Res to study Univer
sity policy last year after staff scientists at SLAC
protested the use of their facility by SSRI for basic
research with nuclear-weapons applications. In
February, 1983,15 faculty and 280 staff members
at SLAC decried their "involuntary servitude" for
SSRL work with results they found morally objec
tionable.
According to SLAC Director Burton Richter,
four of the five researchers who were the principal
protesters have since been able to find alternate
projects within the University, while the fifth has
left SLAC for a position elsewhere.
According to C-Res chairman David Korn, new
dean of the Stanford Medical School, the commit
tee "wrestled long and hard, well into June with is
sues considered very substantial and complex"
before deciding "research could not be monitored
because of the nature of science itself."

The group then voted 8-2 to "reaffirm Stanford
University's existing policy in research that
freedom of inquiry and expression of final results
should not be abridged by speculations concerning
political or moral impropriety of the uses which
might be made of the results."
Mary James, a graduate student in physics, sum
marized the minority position for the senate: "The
model for the university was traditionally a collec
tion of scholars with individual interests, engaged
in social criticism, with freedom to study what they
wanted. Academic freedom was important to
protect scholars from the wrath of their colleagues
or the institution. Our present guidelines reflect
that model.
"The institution I see today is very different,"
she said. "(The) large-scale contract research, with
millions and millions of dollars, places tremendous
pressures on researchers. Many scholars here have
different commitments to other than individual re-
search. Why do we allow research to
develop weapons of mass destruc
tion? Is that our inquiry or that of an
outside agent?
David Abernethy, professor of po
litical science, agreed with James that
the University already curtails aca
demic freedom, frequently by looking
at research's possible end uses. He
said that faculty are "not free to con
duct classified research, not free to
conduct research that will harm
humans or excessively harm animals,
and are not free to conduct research
when there are no funds."
Abernethy noted, "We do use end
reasonings in determining whether to
do certain research, for example,
when there's a likely positive use,
such as medical school research on
cancer."
He said the majority report used
end reasoning when it mentioned that
some in the Stanford community
believe nuclear weapons are a deter
rent to war, and so research sur

rounding them should not be neces
sarily restricted.
Abernethy said that the University
should examine research proposals in
five areas: clarity of purpose, possi
bility of harm, likelihood of harm
being realized, balance between
negative and positive possible
outcomes, and a direct linkage be
tween the research and its negative
use.
Arthur Bienenstock, director of
SSRL, then observed that much of
the contested research has basic sci
entific as well as military value, al
though the lab's proposal panel as
sesses projects only on being
"sufficiently meritorious" as basic re
search.
Some of SSRL's research with
nuclear-weapons use includes mea
surement of X-ray absorption coeffi
cients, high-pressure X-ray diffrac
tion, X-ray detector development, X
ray optics and lasers.
However, Bienenstock said SSRL
conducted these projects because of
their high value to basic science re
search.
Bienenstock and Richter both
asserted during the meeting that

Stanford researchers use about 25
percent of SLAC's accelerator beam
time, although SLAC and SSRL
are government facilities.
Bienenstock further emphasized that
his institution is still guided by Stan
ford's existing research policy.
"That policy means to me that we
should not restrict any inquiry which
is an attempt by man to understand
nature. A large portion of our society
believes our safety results from weap
ons; another large segment believes
the opposite. It's easy to speak about
mass destruction; what about individ
ual destruction? Some would seek to
limit research on processes which
could lead to abortion, or the study of
intelligence, for fear of what it might
do to our society. If we begin to place
limits, we will open ourselves up as
prey to society and rip the University
apart."
Korn said, "The issue is really cen
sorship, infringing on freedom of ex
pression of our colleagues in this
community. Is it only the output of
natural sciences that is pervertable
and corruptible? Where do you want
to draw the line â€” with literature,
sociology, history?"
