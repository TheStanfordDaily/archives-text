## Cardinal to face nation's top defense 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford's last two football oppo
nents — Arizona State University
and UCLA — both were ranked No.
1 in preseason polls. Sport Magazine
said Arizona State was the nation s
best team, and Sports Illustrated gave
UCLA top honors.
Washington, Stanford's opponent
tomorrow at Stanford Stadium at
12:40 p.m., wasn't ranked high by
anyone. Perhaps that was a mistake.
Arizona State is 2-3, has lost three
of four home games, and is unranked.
UCLA is 3-2 overall, 0-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, and is also un
ranked.
Meanwhile, Washington is 5-0
overall, 1-0 in the Pac-10, and is
ranked No. 2 by the Associated Press.
Unlike Arizona State and UCLA, the
Huskies appear to be legitimate.
"I got a chance last night to look at
the Washington films," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said at his weekly
press conference Monday. "It shor
tened our celebrations from the
UCLA game."
Stanford, 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the
Pac-10, made it look easy in the first
half against the Bruins Saturday,
but had to hold on in the second half,
winning, 23-21, after leading, 20-0, in
the second quarter.
The Cardinal probably won't have
that luxury tomorrow.
Although Washington has sput
tered at times on offense, its defense
might be one of the best in the nation.
Statistically speaking, it is currently
considered the best.

The Huskies are ranked first in
scoring defense, giving up an average
of 6.4 points per game, and total
defense, holding the opponent to
229.2 yards per game. Washington,
which has 25 takeaways in five
games, is second in turnover ratio,
with 17 more takeaways than
giveaways.
"They are very physical, they are
very disciplined," Elway said. "They
have a total defensive football team,
and I think we will have to play our
best offensive game to beat them."
In its 28-10 loss to Arizona State,
the Cardinal was held to 164 yards in
total offense, its worst offensive effort
since it had 116 yards against Tulane
in 1979. Although the rushing attack
was productive Saturday against UCLA,
quarterback Fred Buckley, replaced
injured John Paye, completed only 9-
of-21 passes for 83 yards.
Besides Paye, who will miss at least
another two games, leading Cardinal
rusher Thomas Henley is doubtful to
morrow because of a badly bruised
left shoulder, Elway said. Kevin Scott
will start at tailback and Brad Muster,
who had 82 yards on 24 carries last
week, will start at fullback.
Washington, whose easy schedule
(it doesn't play UCLA or Arizona
State) gives it the inside track in the
Rose Bowl race, is favored to win by
more than a touchdown tomorrow,
but Coach Don James isn't taking
Stanford lightly.
"I think [it is] the most improved
team in our league," James said. "It's

will have to play a major role tomorrow if the Cardinal is to beat the
University of Washington.
