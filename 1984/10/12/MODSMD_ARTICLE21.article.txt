## Cardinal to face nation's top defense 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford's last two football oppo
nents — Arizona State University
and UCLA — both were ranked No.
1 in preseason polls. Sport Magazine
said Arizona State was the nation s
best team, and Sports Illustrated gave
UCLA top honors.
Washington, Stanford's opponent
tomorrow at Stanford Stadium at
12:40 p.m., wasn't ranked high by
anyone. Perhaps that was a mistake.
Arizona State is 2-3, has lost three
of four home games, and is unranked.
UCLA is 3-2 overall, 0-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, and is also un
ranked.
Meanwhile, Washington is 5-0
overall, 1-0 in the Pac-10, and is
ranked No. 2 by the Associated Press.
Unlike Arizona State and UCLA, the
Huskies appear to be legitimate.
"I got a chance last night to look at
the Washington films," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said at his weekly
press conference Monday. "It shor
tened our celebrations from the
UCLA game."
Stanford, 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the
Pac-10, made it look easy in the first
half against the Bruins Saturday,
but had to hold on in the second half,
winning, 23-21, after leading, 20-0, in
the second quarter.
The Cardinal probably won't have
that luxury tomorrow.
Although Washington has sput
tered at times on offense, its defense
might be one of the best in the nation.
Statistically speaking, it is currently
considered the best.

The Huskies are ranked first in
scoring defense, giving up an average
of 6.4 points per game, and total
defense, holding the opponent to
229.2 yards per game. Washington,
which has 25 takeaways in five
games, is second in turnover ratio,
with 17 more takeaways than
giveaways.
"They are very physical, they are
very disciplined," Elway said. "They
have a total defensive football team,
and I think we will have to play our
best offensive game to beat them."
In its 28-10 loss to Arizona State,
the Cardinal was held to 164 yards in
total offense, its worst offensive effort
since it had 116 yards against Tulane
in 1979. Although the rushing attack
was productive Saturday against UCLA,
quarterback Fred Buckley, replaced
injured John Paye, completed only 9-
of-21 passes for 83 yards.
Besides Paye, who will miss at least
another two games, leading Cardinal
rusher Thomas Henley is doubtful to
morrow because of a badly bruised
left shoulder, Elway said. Kevin Scott
will start at tailback and Brad Muster,
who had 82 yards on 24 carries last
week, will start at fullback.
Washington, whose easy schedule
(it doesn't play UCLA or Arizona
State) gives it the inside track in the
Rose Bowl race, is favored to win by
more than a touchdown tomorrow,
but Coach Don James isn't taking
Stanford lightly.
"I think [it is] the most improved
team in our league," James said. "It's

obvious that Jack Elway has done a
great job in getting the most out of his
players.
James said Monday in Seattle that
it is "highly unlikely" the Huskies will
remain undefeated this season. "It
doesn't appear to me that any team in
our league is capable of going out and
waltzing [its] way through the
league," he said.
The last time James took an unde
feated Husky team into Stanford
Stadium was in 1982, when Washing
ton entered the Stanford game with a
7-0 record and a No. 1 ranking. The
Cardinal, led by John Elway, came
from behind for a 43-31 victory.
If the Huskies are going to lose this
season, it's "highly unlikely" the loss
will be blamed on their defense. The
only candidate as an Achilles' heel on
the Husky team is the offense. Wash
ington lost its leading passer, Pac-10
Player of the Year Steve Pelluer, and
leading rusher. Sterling Hinds, to
graduation after last season.
Junior Hugh Millen has taken over

at quarterback, but is still riot at I el
luer's level. Millen has completed 58
of 107 passes for 733 yards and three
touchdowns. .
Should Stanford achieve a repeat
of 1982, a victory many consider to
be the biggest in John Elway s career,
i, would be 2-1 in the Pac-10 with the
easier part of its conference schedu e
ahead. In other words, Stanford
would be in the thick of the Rose
Bowl race.
"1 think it's in the back of our
minds," defensive tackle Mike
Wyman said. "But it's not the type of
thing we're talking about yet. Right
now, Washington's our Rose Bowl.
That's all we're talking about."

Washington, whose easy schedule
(it doesn't play UCLA or Arizona
State) gives it the inside track in the
Rose Bowl race, is favored to win by
more than a touchdown tomorrow,

Stanford lightly.

obvious that Jack Elway has done a
great job in getting the most out of his
players.
James said Monday in Seattle that
it is "highly unlikely" the Huskies will
remain undefeated this season. "It
doesn't appear to me that any team in
our league is capable of going out and
waltzing [its] way through the
league," he said.
The last time James took an unde
feated Husky team into Stanford
Stadium was in 1982, when Washing
ton entered the Stanford game with a
7-0 record and a No. 1 ranking. The
Cardinal, led by John Elway, came
from behind for a 43-31 victory.
If the Huskies are going to lose this
season, it's "highly unlikely" the loss
will be blamed on their defense. The
only candidate as an Achilles' heel on
the Husky team is the offense. Wash
ington lost its leading passer, Pac-10
Player of the Year Steve Pelluer, and
leading rusher. Sterling Hinds, to
graduation after last season.
Junior Hugh Millen has taken over

at quarterback, but is still riot at I el
luer's level. Millen has completed 58
of 107 passes for 733 yards and three
touchdowns. .
Should Stanford achieve a repeat
of 1982, a victory many consider to
be the biggest in John Elway s career,
i, would be 2-1 in the Pac-10 with the
easier part of its conference schedu e
ahead. In other words, Stanford
would be in the thick of the Rose
Bowl race.
"1 think it's in the back of our
minds," defensive tackle Mike
Wyman said. "But it's not the type of
thing we're talking about yet. Right
now, Washington's our Rose Bowl.
That's all we're talking about."

CBS will telecast the game live to a
split-national audience (approx

the United States). Air time is 12:30

(90.1 FM) will carry the radio broad

Those attending tomorrow's game
are asked by the Stanford Athletic
Department not to blow whistles during
the game. The noises are disruptive to
players, and the home team can be
penalized for such sounds from the
stands.
Stanford's last two football oppo
nents — Arizona State University
and UCLA — both were ranked No.
1 in preseason polls. Sport Magazine
said Arizona State was the nation s
best team, and Sports Illustrated gave
UCLA top honors.
Washington, Stanford's opponent
tomorrow at Stanford Stadium at
12:40 p.m., wasn't ranked high by
anyone. Perhaps that was a mistake.
Arizona State is 2-3, has lost three
of four home games, and is unranked.
UCLA is 3-2 overall, 0-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, and is also un
ranked.
Meanwhile, Washington is 5-0
overall, 1-0 in the Pac-10, and is
ranked No. 2 by the Associated Press.
Unlike Arizona State and UCLA, the
Huskies appear to be legitimate.
"I got a chance last night to look at
the Washington films," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said at his weekly
press conference Monday. "It shor
tened our celebrations from the
UCLA game."
Stanford, 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the
Pac-10, made it look easy in the first
half against the Bruins Saturday,
but had to hold on in the second half,
winning, 23-21, after leading, 20-0, in
the second quarter.
The Cardinal probably won't have
that luxury tomorrow.
Although Washington has sput
tered at times on offense, its defense
might be one of the best in the nation.
Statistically speaking, it is currently
considered the best.

The Huskies are ranked first in
scoring defense, giving up an average
of 6.4 points per game, and total
defense, holding the opponent to
229.2 yards per game. Washington,
which has 25 takeaways in five
games, is second in turnover ratio,
with 17 more takeaways than
giveaways.
"They are very physical, they are
very disciplined," Elway said. "They
have a total defensive football team,
and I think we will have to play our
best offensive game to beat them."
In its 28-10 loss to Arizona State,
the Cardinal was held to 164 yards in
total offense, its worst offensive effort
since it had 116 yards against Tulane
in 1979. Although the rushing attack
was productive Saturday against UCLA,
quarterback Fred Buckley, replaced
injured John Paye, completed only 9-
of-21 passes for 83 yards.
Besides Paye, who will miss at least
another two games, leading Cardinal
rusher Thomas Henley is doubtful to
morrow because of a badly bruised
left shoulder, Elway said. Kevin Scott
will start at tailback and Brad Muster,
who had 82 yards on 24 carries last
