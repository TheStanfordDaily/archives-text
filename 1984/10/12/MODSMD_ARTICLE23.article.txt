### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford water polo team will
play the top four teams from the
Pacific Coast Athletic Association
this weekend in the PCAA/Pacific 10
Tournament at Long Beach.
The Cardinal will play the Univer
sity of California at Santa Barbara to
morrow morning at 9:30 and will play
Pepperdine University at 3:45 p.m.
On Sunday, Stanford will play the
University of California at Irvine at 7
a.m. and Cal State-Long Beach at
1:45 p.m.
According to Coach Dante Detta
manti, Stanford's most difficult op
ponent will be top-ranked Pep

perdine. Stanford defeated Pep
perdine two weeks ago, 13-5, but
Dettamanti does not feel this will give
the Cardinal any advantage in its
match against the Waves.
"Pepperdine is an overall strong
team and they will be very difficult to
beat," Dettamanti said. "They rely
very heavily on their holeman, Mike
Grier, and on their outside shooting.
Since both of our teams follow such a
different style of play, it should prove
to be a very close and exciting
match."
Stanford's match against Irvine
should also be close, according \o
Dettamanti. The Anteaters are
ranked fourth in the nation with only
three losses this season, one of them
to Stanford.
The PCAA/Pac-10 Tournament is

often the turning point of the season
for many teams, and Dettamanti feels
certain this weekend could be a good
turning point for the Cardinal^
"The players have really turned on
this week, and after their exceptional
play in practice, I feel they will be
playing at their peak for all four
games," Dettamanti said.
