# Cardinal to begin homestand
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
So it was only a non-conference match. But the Stan
ford women's volleyball team's 15-8, 15-5, 2-15, 12-15,
11-15 loss to rival University of the Pacific Tuesday night
was a difficult one to swallow.
The Cardinal dropped the five-game match in front of a
large vocal crowd at Stockton. According to Cardinal
Asst. Coach Don Shaw, outside factors affected the
outcome of the match.
"I hope we learned, if anything, from the UOP game
that no matter how well the other team is playing, or how
much the crowd is a factor, nothing should ever affect our
playing," Shaw said.
The Cardinal, perhaps taking its lesson, will settle into a
seven-game homestand beginning tonight with a match
against the Cal State-Long Beach 49ers. A match against
Stanford alumni will be played tomorrow evening.
Stanford's conference matchup against Cal State-Long
Beach will begin the longest homestand of this season,
during which Stanford will play top-ranked teams such as
No. 1-ranked USC, third-ranked UCLA, and sixth-ranked
San Diego State University.
Stanford is ranked second in the nation in this week's
Collegiate Volleyball Coaches Association poll. Cal State-
Long Beach, 9-6 overall and 1-4 in the Western Col
legiate Athletic Association, is not ranked.
But according to Cardinal Head Coach Fred Sturm, the
49ers' statistics might be misleading. "They are definitely

the most improved team in the conference this year —
perhaps the most improved team in the nation," he said.
"They are good enough to catch somebody good by
surprise. We don't want to be that team."
Cal State-Long Beach has already produced one upset
this season, over Arizona State University in a three-game
victory on Sept. 22, but the 49ers' most recent match was
a loss to UCLA Wednesday night.
"Cal State is a very young and unpredictable team,"
Shaw said. "They have some talent now and are definitely
capable of playing well."
The 49ers' "talent" is led by hitter and middle blocker
Connie Watson, who redshirted last season but has
returned as this season's leading hitter in percentage and
kills. LeValley Pattison will be a setter for Cal State-Long
Beach. Sturm said, "She (Pattison) has a lot of savvy. She
knows exactly what to do at the right times — a good
tactical setter."
Sturm said the Cardinal will concentrate on "harnessing
our feelings and disciplining our concentration" to avoid
mental mistakes and "unaggressive errors" present in the
final three games against UOP.
The alumni game tomorrow night will match the pres
ent Cardinal against standout players of the past such as
setter Kari Rush (sister of freshman setter Wendi Rush),
and hitter Julie Baker. "It should be a lot of fun," Shaw
said. "It's good game experience for the whole team, as
well." The match will begin at Maples Pavilion at 7:30.
