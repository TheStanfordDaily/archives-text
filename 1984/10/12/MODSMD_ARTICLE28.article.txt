Moscow on the Hudson (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Or "You Can't Go Home Again
Robin Williams gives a brilliant perfor
mance as a saxophonist with a Moscow
circus playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to defect. On
one level Paul Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos) deals
with the movement from repression to
freedom, what freedom implies and what
its constraints and contradictions are; on
another level it's a comedy about the
seductive appeal of American decadence
for Russians (like "Ninotchka" wus):
centrally, though, it's about what hap
pens to a man who makes the choice to
cut himself off from home and famiK
forever. When Mazursky's in high gear,
few directors can touch him: The whole
cast (Cleavant Derricks, Maria Conchita
Alonso, Tiger Haynes, Savely
Kramarov, Elya Baskin, Alexander
Beniaminov) is marvelous, and
sometimes Mazursky engages so many
emotional tracks simultaneously that you
can't analyze exactly which element is af
fecting you most profoundly.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Casablanca (1943)
Kresge Auditorium
In some theaters, when this movie is
shown, audiences bring wine to toast the
"Marseillaise" scene and everyone
knows all the famous lines, from"I stick
my head out for nobody" to "Louis, this
could be the start of a beautiful
friendship." Humphrey Bogart, at his
most romantic, plays Rick, who owns a
cafe in wartime Casablanca; lngrid
Bergman, at her most beautiful, is Use.
who deserted him in Paris and now walks
into his club with Paul Henreid, w(io
plays Victor Lazlo — the Resistance
leader the Nazis can't stop. Dooley \Mil
son, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstrqet
are in it, and so is "As Time Goes By"] it
won the Academy Award for Bist
Picture. Of course, nobody really

believes a word of it, but who cares? It is
one of the most wonderfully appealing
bad movies ever to come out of Holly
wood. Michael Curtiz directed; the script
is by Howard Koch.
Plays tonight at 7 and 9:30.
Black and White as Day and Night
(1981)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Wolfgang Petersen's film about the
growing paranoia of an obsessive chess
player (Bruno Ganz) is well made and
effectively structured — like a modest
thriller — but glum and almost humor
less. To really draw us into the hero's
aberrant psychological state, Petersen
would need to find a wilder, more
baroque style, preferably a comic one.
There's only one scene in which he offers
a sharp visual definition of obsession: On
a beach, Ganz improvises a chess board
using sea shells, liie rest of the time it's
only a movie about chess, which is not a
terribly photogenic subject.
Plays Thursday evening at 7:30.
The 39 Steps (1935)
Terman Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock filmed the John
Buchan novel (as adapted by Charles
Bennett and Alma Reville) in 1935, and
though there have been two versions
since, no one has taken much notice of
them. Robert Donat, the most debonair
and best-spoken hero of Hitchcock's
British period, plays the innocent who
gets involved in a spy plot — and is
handcuffed to gorgeous, blonde
' Madeleine Carroll. This movie contains
one of the few poignant scenes in any
Hitchcock picture: a brief study of an un
happy .marriage. (Peggy Ashcroft and
John Laurie play the couple.) With
Godfrey Tearle, Lucie Mannheim, Wylie
Watson, Helen Haye and Frank Collier.
"The 39 Steps" contains the blueprint
for jnany of the thrillers Hitchcock was
to make over the next 25 years (notably
"Foreign Correspondent" and "North

by Northwest").
Plays Wednesday evening at 7:30.
As You Like It (1936)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
J.M. Barrie and Barry Cullen adapted
what may be Shakespeare's most rap
turous comedy, cutting it by about half,
and the director, Paul Czinner, makes it
all seem a little academic. But the very
young, astonishingly handsome
Laurence Olivier plays Orlando, and he
makes the film worth seeing. (It also has
delightful, slightly mad late Medieval
costumes.) Rosalind is played by Czin
ner's wife, Elisabeth Bergner, who had
left Germany in the early days of the
Third Reich to become as famous in En
gland as she had been in her homeland.
(Klaus Mann's "Mephisto," written the
same year as this film, includes a charac
ter based on Bergner.) She has a lovely,
lithe camera presence, but she's not right
for the role; her line readings are musi
cal, but she seems to have the tune
wrong. With Sophie Stewart as Celia,
Leon Quartermaine as Jaques, Felix
Aylmer as Duke Frederick, Henry Ain
ley as Duke Senior, Mackenzie Ward as
Touchstone, John Laurie as Oliver,
Dorice Fordred as Audrey, Richard Ain
ley as Silvius, Joan White as Phebe, and
Fisher White as Adam.
Plays Monday with "Twelfth Night."
The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Basil Rathbone plays Sherlock
Holmes and Nigel Bruce Dr. Watson in
the first of 14 films based on the Arthur
Conan Doyle mysteries — and, Holmes
buffs aver, the best. ("Baskervilles" and
"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"
were made at 20th Century-Fox in 1939;
the remaining dozen, released between
1942 and 1946, were done at Universal.)
Sidney Lanfield directed this relaxed,
entertaining picture, from a script by

Ernest Pascal. With Lionel Atwill, John
Carradine, Wendy Barrie, Richard
Greene, Beryl Mercer, Morton Lowry,
E.E. Clive, Ralph Forbes, Barlowe Bor
land and Eily Malyon.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock
(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
This picture squeaks by for the first
half hour on the good will "Star Trek II:
The Wrath of Khan" built up, but that
fades when you realize that no one with
either wit or taste exerted any control
over the project. Leonard Nimoy offers
his typical out-of-whack performance,
only this time from the director's chair:
If you tried to recount the story, it would
make more sense than it does while
you're watching it, because you would
naturally supply the dramatic accents
Nimoy leaves off. Harve Bennett's script
sets up one big scene after another, but
you get the feeling Nimoy hasn't grasped
the logic or the flow of the story — that
he's still waiting for someone to walk
him through it. About two-thirds of the
way through, when the Planet Genesis
(where Spock's body is buried) disin
tegrates, you begin to enjoy the dumb
picture for its colossal ineptitude. With
William Shatner and all the regulars, as
well as Dame Judith Anderson as the
Vulcan high priestess; it's amazing to
hear that richly cadenced voice wrapped
around artificial language that might
have clunked happily through any Maria
Montez film.
Plays today with "Android."
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often hilarious
parody of heavy metal rock, featuring
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean
and Harry Shearer (in a walrus mous
tache) as the main members of the group

whose descent from fame the mock doc
umentary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical numbers aren't
as witty as they might be, except for an
imitation British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays Thurdsay with "Top Secret!"
Rumble Fish (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
All of Francis Ford Coppola's film
version of an adolescent novel by S.E.
Hinton looks like the dream clouds in
"The Elephant Man" — we never get to
wake up in this movie. Stephen Burum
laid his black-and-white photography on
with a trowel: it's so film noir that the
Xanadu scenes in "Citizen Kane" look
naturalistic in comparison. Steam erupts
from every corner, street signs seem to
float in space, and the camera looms so
close to faces that they distort and age.
This must be one of the craziest movies
ever made commercially in this country.
You'd never guess that Coppola was
trying to make a picture about anything
as accessible as frustrated teenagers or
restless young nomads; he's so in love
with his own dumb metaphors and his
own amazing technical skills that they
take over the film. The large cast is full
of talent, but Coppola lets them act and
act, never imposing any controls, until fi
nally they become excessive, narcissistic.
With Mickey Rourke, Matt Dillon,
Diane Lane, Nicolas Cage, Vincent
Spano, and — giving the blue ribbon
dreadful performances — Diana Scarwid
and Dennis Hopper.
Plays Sunday with "Apocalypse
Now."
Heart Like a Wheel (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ken Friedman's script about Shirley
Muldowney, the only driver ever to win
the National Hot Rod Association
World Championship three times, has
clarity, narrative logic and even polish,
and the director, Jonathan Kaplan,
demonstrates intelligence and an unfussy
control of the actors and the material.
The cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto,
has given the film a clean, classically
small-town American look, and the
major emotional encounters are staged
shrewdly and economically. But the
filmmakers show a worse deficiency than
sloppy craftsmanship or histrionic ex

cessiveness: They have ordinary eyes.
They take a predictable, non
exploratory approach to their subject,
and Bonnie Bedelia's competent but un
imaginative performance in the central
role doesn't help. The warm, big-old
bear presences of Beau Bridges (as Shir
ley's partner/lover Connie Kalitta) and
Hoyt Axton (in a much-too-brief bit as
Shirley's father Tex Roque) dominate
the movie.
Plays Wednesday with "Lianna."
Dr. Strangelove (1964)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This black comedy about the series of
blunders leading to a nuclear war is one
of the high points of American film
writing: Few screenplays can compare to
what Terry Southern, Stanley Kubrick
and Peter George have accomplished
here. It is one of Kubrick's best movies
— and his last unpretentious, energetic
one. (At this point he still knew how to
pace and edit.) Peter Sellers is triple cast
as the low-key American president, an
officer who is a perfect parody of British
reserve, and Strangelove, the mad Nazi
scientist whose scenes invade the terri
tory of the surrealists. He gives a bravura
performance that is nearly matched by
George C. Scott's randy, growling gen
eral. With Sterling Hayden as the
megalomaniac who starts the whole
mess, Slim Pickens as a gung-ho pilot,
Keenan Wynn and James Earl Jones.
Plays Thursday with "A Clockwork
Orange."
Lianna(l9B3)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A hopscotch movie — good and bad
scenes, cliches and fresh insights alter
nate straight through. Lianna (Linda
Griffiths) is married to a film instructor,
Dick (Jon DeVries), at a small, inces
tuous East Coast college; fed up with the
life of a faculty spouse, she enrolls in a
child psychology course taught by a visit
ing professor, Ruth (Jane Hallaren), who
becomes her lover. John Sayles wrote,
directed and edited this movie, which is
rewarding and memorable even when it's
awful. Dreadful, implausible encounters
are balanced by funny, offbeat passages
— you can't guess which moments Sayles
is going to pull off. He has a taste for ac
tors who don't come off as actors on
camera, and there are good perfor
mances by Griffiths, Hallaren, Maggie

Renzi and Sayles himself; with others
(De Vries, Jo Henderson as Lianna's
best friend). The near-documentary style
he is trying for fails. Sayles isn't really a
director yet, but he's daring, and he
keeps pushing his writing talents
through.
Plays Wednesday with "Heart Like a
Wheel."
El Norte (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Two young Guatemalans, brother and
sister, whose village has been wiped out
by the army, use their godmother's piti
ful savings to travel into Mexico and —
illegally — into California, the land of
promise the Guatemalans call "el norte"
("the north"). The story is an authentic
tragedy, and one admires Gregory Nava,
the director, and his wife, Anna Thomas,
the screenwriter (they co-produced the
picture), for their persistence in working
on a project of such questionable com
mercial potential. But devotion and in
tegrity and right-mindedness don't nec
essarily produce good movies, and "El
Norte" is an enervating one, featuring
those noble peasant icons who have been
with us since the intellectuals of the left
invented them in the '30s.
Plays tomorrow with "Sugar Cane Al
ley."
A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire
on the polarized state he felt Western so
ciety was approaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is "rehabilitated"
by behavioral psychologists, i.e., reduced
to a benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alternatives — so
cial and anti-social conduct — are
equally repugnant. But in Stanley
Kubrick's film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of society's repre
sentatives are such megalomaniacal half
wits — that we are manipulated into
cheering for his highly objectionable acts
of rebellion. Shrewdly, Kubrick has cast
vivacious, winning Malcolm McDowell
— a performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex. This is a
morally questionable film, directed in
such an impersonal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it seems to
transpire in a vacuum.
Plays Thursday with "Dr. Stran
gelove."


Cat People (1942)
Terman Auditorium
Val Lewton, the horror king at RKO in the 1940sJH
made his name by producing inexpensive, imaginative
scare pictures with a minimum of big set pieces and a
maximum of heightened mood and carefully or
chestrated suggestion. "Cat People," on which he
worked with the director Jacques Tourneur, is the best
remembered of his movies. It contains two famous
scenes — on a street at night where an invisible pres
ence stalks one of the characters, and in a swimming
pool. (Paul Schrader's 1982 remake, which has little
connection to the original, tries to evoke both those se
quences — and fails.) Don't go expecting too much:
DeWitt Bodeen's script is fairly primitive, and the act
ing (by Simone Simon, Kent Smith, Tom Conway, Jane
. Randolph, Jack Holt and others) is wooden, but the
L film is memorably offbeat and creepy.
Plays tomorrow evening at 7:30 and 9:30.

centrally, though, it's about what hap
pens to a man who makes the choice to
cut himself off from home and famiK
forever. When Mazursky's in high gear,
few directors can touch him: The whole
cast (Cleavant Derricks, Maria Conchita
Alonso, Tiger Haynes, Savely
Kramarov, Elya Baskin, Alexander
Beniaminov) is marvelous, and
sometimes Mazursky engages so many
emotional tracks simultaneously that you
can't analyze exactly which element is af
fecting you most profoundly.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Casablanca (1943)
Kresge Auditorium
In some theaters, when this movie is
shown, audiences bring wine to toast the
"Marseillaise" scene and everyone
knows all the famous lines, from"I stick
my head out for nobody" to "Louis, this
could be the start of a beautiful
friendship." Humphrey Bogart, at his
most romantic, plays Rick, who owns a
cafe in wartime Casablanca; lngrid
Bergman, at her most beautiful, is Use.
who deserted him in Paris and now walks
into his club with Paul Henreid, w(io
plays Victor Lazlo — the Resistance
leader the Nazis can't stop. Dooley \Mil
son, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstrqet
are in it, and so is "As Time Goes By"] it
won the Academy Award for Bist
Picture. Of course, nobody really

believes a word of it, but who cares? It is
one of the most wonderfully appealing
bad movies ever to come out of Holly
wood. Michael Curtiz directed; the script
is by Howard Koch.
Plays tonight at 7 and 9:30.
Black and White as Day and Night
(1981)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Wolfgang Petersen's film about the
growing paranoia of an obsessive chess
player (Bruno Ganz) is well made and
effectively structured — like a modest
thriller — but glum and almost humor
less. To really draw us into the hero's
aberrant psychological state, Petersen
would need to find a wilder, more
baroque style, preferably a comic one.
There's only one scene in which he offers
a sharp visual definition of obsession: On
a beach, Ganz improvises a chess board
using sea shells, liie rest of the time it's
only a movie about chess, which is not a
terribly photogenic subject.
Plays Thursday evening at 7:30.
The 39 Steps (1935)
Terman Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock filmed the John
Buchan novel (as adapted by Charles
Bennett and Alma Reville) in 1935, and
though there have been two versions
since, no one has taken much notice of
them. Robert Donat, the most debonair
and best-spoken hero of Hitchcock's
British period, plays the innocent who
gets involved in a spy plot — and is
handcuffed to gorgeous, blonde
' Madeleine Carroll. This movie contains
one of the few poignant scenes in any
Hitchcock picture: a brief study of an un
happy .marriage. (Peggy Ashcroft and
John Laurie play the couple.) With
Godfrey Tearle, Lucie Mannheim, Wylie
Watson, Helen Haye and Frank Collier.
"The 39 Steps" contains the blueprint
for jnany of the thrillers Hitchcock was
to make over the next 25 years (notably
"Foreign Correspondent" and "North

by Northwest").
Plays Wednesday evening at 7:30.
As You Like It (1936)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
J.M. Barrie and Barry Cullen adapted
what may be Shakespeare's most rap
turous comedy, cutting it by about half,
and the director, Paul Czinner, makes it
all seem a little academic. But the very
young, astonishingly handsome
Laurence Olivier plays Orlando, and he
makes the film worth seeing. (It also has
delightful, slightly mad late Medieval
costumes.) Rosalind is played by Czin
ner's wife, Elisabeth Bergner, who had
left Germany in the early days of the
Third Reich to become as famous in En
gland as she had been in her homeland.
(Klaus Mann's "Mephisto," written the
same year as this film, includes a charac
ter based on Bergner.) She has a lovely,
lithe camera presence, but she's not right
for the role; her line readings are musi
cal, but she seems to have the tune
wrong. With Sophie Stewart as Celia,
Leon Quartermaine as Jaques, Felix
Aylmer as Duke Frederick, Henry Ain
ley as Duke Senior, Mackenzie Ward as
Touchstone, John Laurie as Oliver,
Dorice Fordred as Audrey, Richard Ain
ley as Silvius, Joan White as Phebe, and
Fisher White as Adam.
Plays Monday with "Twelfth Night."
The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Basil Rathbone plays Sherlock
Holmes and Nigel Bruce Dr. Watson in
the first of 14 films based on the Arthur
Conan Doyle mysteries — and, Holmes
buffs aver, the best. ("Baskervilles" and
"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"
were made at 20th Century-Fox in 1939;
the remaining dozen, released between
1942 and 1946, were done at Universal.)
Sidney Lanfield directed this relaxed,
entertaining picture, from a script by

Ernest Pascal. With Lionel Atwill, John
Carradine, Wendy Barrie, Richard
Greene, Beryl Mercer, Morton Lowry,
E.E. Clive, Ralph Forbes, Barlowe Bor
land and Eily Malyon.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock
(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
This picture squeaks by for the first
half hour on the good will "Star Trek II:
The Wrath of Khan" built up, but that
fades when you realize that no one with
either wit or taste exerted any control
over the project. Leonard Nimoy offers
his typical out-of-whack performance,
only this time from the director's chair:
If you tried to recount the story, it would
make more sense than it does while
you're watching it, because you would
naturally supply the dramatic accents
Nimoy leaves off. Harve Bennett's script
sets up one big scene after another, but
you get the feeling Nimoy hasn't grasped
the logic or the flow of the story — that
he's still waiting for someone to walk
him through it. About two-thirds of the
way through, when the Planet Genesis
(where Spock's body is buried) disin
tegrates, you begin to enjoy the dumb
picture for its colossal ineptitude. With
William Shatner and all the regulars, as
well as Dame Judith Anderson as the
Vulcan high priestess; it's amazing to
hear that richly cadenced voice wrapped
around artificial language that might
have clunked happily through any Maria
Montez film.
Plays today with "Android."
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often hilarious
parody of heavy metal rock, featuring
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean
and Harry Shearer (in a walrus mous
tache) as the main members of the group

whose descent from fame the mock doc
umentary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical numbers aren't
as witty as they might be, except for an
imitation British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays Thurdsay with "Top Secret!"
Rumble Fish (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
All of Francis Ford Coppola's film
version of an adolescent novel by S.E.
Hinton looks like the dream clouds in
"The Elephant Man" — we never get to
wake up in this movie. Stephen Burum
laid his black-and-white photography on
with a trowel: it's so film noir that the
Xanadu scenes in "Citizen Kane" look
naturalistic in comparison. Steam erupts
from every corner, street signs seem to
float in space, and the camera looms so
close to faces that they distort and age.
This must be one of the craziest movies
ever made commercially in this country.
You'd never guess that Coppola was
trying to make a picture about anything
as accessible as frustrated teenagers or
restless young nomads; he's so in love
with his own dumb metaphors and his
own amazing technical skills that they
take over the film. The large cast is full
of talent, but Coppola lets them act and
act, never imposing any controls, until fi
nally they become excessive, narcissistic.
With Mickey Rourke, Matt Dillon,
Diane Lane, Nicolas Cage, Vincent
Spano, and — giving the blue ribbon
dreadful performances — Diana Scarwid
and Dennis Hopper.
Plays Sunday with "Apocalypse
Now."
Heart Like a Wheel (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ken Friedman's script about Shirley
Muldowney, the only driver ever to win
the National Hot Rod Association
World Championship three times, has
clarity, narrative logic and even polish,
and the director, Jonathan Kaplan,
demonstrates intelligence and an unfussy
control of the actors and the material.
The cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto,
has given the film a clean, classically
small-town American look, and the
major emotional encounters are staged
shrewdly and economically. But the
filmmakers show a worse deficiency than
sloppy craftsmanship or histrionic ex

cessiveness: They have ordinary eyes.
They take a predictable, non
exploratory approach to their subject,
and Bonnie Bedelia's competent but un
imaginative performance in the central
role doesn't help. The warm, big-old
bear presences of Beau Bridges (as Shir
ley's partner/lover Connie Kalitta) and
Hoyt Axton (in a much-too-brief bit as
Shirley's father Tex Roque) dominate
the movie.
Plays Wednesday with "Lianna."
Dr. Strangelove (1964)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This black comedy about the series of
blunders leading to a nuclear war is one
of the high points of American film
writing: Few screenplays can compare to
what Terry Southern, Stanley Kubrick
and Peter George have accomplished
here. It is one of Kubrick's best movies
— and his last unpretentious, energetic
one. (At this point he still knew how to
pace and edit.) Peter Sellers is triple cast
as the low-key American president, an
officer who is a perfect parody of British
reserve, and Strangelove, the mad Nazi
scientist whose scenes invade the terri
tory of the surrealists. He gives a bravura
performance that is nearly matched by
George C. Scott's randy, growling gen
eral. With Sterling Hayden as the
megalomaniac who starts the whole
mess, Slim Pickens as a gung-ho pilot,
Keenan Wynn and James Earl Jones.
Plays Thursday with "A Clockwork
Orange."
Lianna(l9B3)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A hopscotch movie — good and bad
scenes, cliches and fresh insights alter
nate straight through. Lianna (Linda
Griffiths) is married to a film instructor,
Dick (Jon DeVries), at a small, inces
tuous East Coast college; fed up with the
life of a faculty spouse, she enrolls in a
child psychology course taught by a visit
ing professor, Ruth (Jane Hallaren), who
becomes her lover. John Sayles wrote,
directed and edited this movie, which is
rewarding and memorable even when it's
awful. Dreadful, implausible encounters
are balanced by funny, offbeat passages
— you can't guess which moments Sayles
is going to pull off. He has a taste for ac
tors who don't come off as actors on
camera, and there are good perfor
mances by Griffiths, Hallaren, Maggie

Renzi and Sayles himself; with others
(De Vries, Jo Henderson as Lianna's
best friend). The near-documentary style
he is trying for fails. Sayles isn't really a
director yet, but he's daring, and he
keeps pushing his writing talents
through.
Plays Wednesday with "Heart Like a
Wheel."
El Norte (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Two young Guatemalans, brother and
sister, whose village has been wiped out
by the army, use their godmother's piti
ful savings to travel into Mexico and —
illegally — into California, the land of
promise the Guatemalans call "el norte"
("the north"). The story is an authentic
tragedy, and one admires Gregory Nava,
the director, and his wife, Anna Thomas,
the screenwriter (they co-produced the
picture), for their persistence in working
on a project of such questionable com
mercial potential. But devotion and in
tegrity and right-mindedness don't nec
essarily produce good movies, and "El
Norte" is an enervating one, featuring
those noble peasant icons who have been
with us since the intellectuals of the left
invented them in the '30s.
Plays tomorrow with "Sugar Cane Al
ley."
A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire
on the polarized state he felt Western so
ciety was approaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is "rehabilitated"
by behavioral psychologists, i.e., reduced
to a benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alternatives — so
cial and anti-social conduct — are
equally repugnant. But in Stanley
Kubrick's film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of society's repre
sentatives are such megalomaniacal half
wits — that we are manipulated into
cheering for his highly objectionable acts
of rebellion. Shrewdly, Kubrick has cast
vivacious, winning Malcolm McDowell
— a performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex. This is a
morally questionable film, directed in
such an impersonal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it seems to
transpire in a vacuum.
Plays Thursday with "Dr. Stran
gelove."


Cat People (1942)
Terman Auditorium
Val Lewton, the horror king at RKO in the 1940sJH
made his name by producing inexpensive, imaginative
scare pictures with a minimum of big set pieces and a
maximum of heightened mood and carefully or
chestrated suggestion. "Cat People," on which he
worked with the director Jacques Tourneur, is the best
remembered of his movies. It contains two famous
scenes — on a street at night where an invisible pres
ence stalks one of the characters, and in a swimming
pool. (Paul Schrader's 1982 remake, which has little
connection to the original, tries to evoke both those se
quences — and fails.) Don't go expecting too much:
DeWitt Bodeen's script is fairly primitive, and the act
ing (by Simone Simon, Kent Smith, Tom Conway, Jane
. Randolph, Jack Holt and others) is wooden, but the
L film is memorably offbeat and creepy.
Plays tomorrow evening at 7:30 and 9:30.
Moscow on the Hudson (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Or "You Can't Go Home Again
Robin Williams gives a brilliant perfor
mance as a saxophonist with a Moscow
circus playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to defect. On
one level Paul Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos) deals
with the movement from repression to
freedom, what freedom implies and what
its constraints and contradictions are; on
another level it's a comedy about the
seductive appeal of American decadence
for Russians (like "Ninotchka" wus):
centrally, though, it's about what hap
pens to a man who makes the choice to

Casablanca (1943)
Kresge Auditorium
In some theaters, when this movie is
shown, audiences bring wine to toast the
"Marseillaise" scene and everyone
knows all the famous lines, from"I stick
my head out for nobody" to "Louis, this
could be the start of a beautiful
friendship." Humphrey Bogart, at his
most romantic, plays Rick, who owns a
cafe in wartime Casablanca; lngrid
Bergman, at her most beautiful, is Use.
who deserted him in Paris and now walks
into his club with Paul Henreid, w(io
plays Victor Lazlo — the Resistance
leader the Nazis can't stop. Dooley \Mil
son, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstrqet
are in it, and so is "As Time Goes By"] it
won the Academy Award for Bist
Picture. Of course, nobody really

believes a word of it, but who cares? It is
one of the most wonderfully appealing
bad movies ever to come out of Holly
wood. Michael Curtiz directed; the script
is by Howard Koch.
Plays tonight at 7 and 9:30.
Black and White as Day and Night
(1981)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Wolfgang Petersen's film about the
growing paranoia of an obsessive chess
player (Bruno Ganz) is well made and
effectively structured — like a modest
thriller — but glum and almost humor
less. To really draw us into the hero's
aberrant psychological state, Petersen
would need to find a wilder, more
baroque style, preferably a comic one.
There's only one scene in which he offers
a sharp visual definition of obsession: On
a beach, Ganz improvises a chess board
using sea shells, liie rest of the time it's
only a movie about chess, which is not a
terribly photogenic subject.
Plays Thursday evening at 7:30.
The 39 Steps (1935)
Terman Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock filmed the John
Buchan novel (as adapted by Charles
Bennett and Alma Reville) in 1935, and
though there have been two versions
since, no one has taken much notice of
them. Robert Donat, the most debonair
and best-spoken hero of Hitchcock's
British period, plays the innocent who
gets involved in a spy plot — and is
handcuffed to gorgeous, blonde
' Madeleine Carroll. This movie contains
one of the few poignant scenes in any
Hitchcock picture: a brief study of an un
happy .marriage. (Peggy Ashcroft and
John Laurie play the couple.) With
Godfrey Tearle, Lucie Mannheim, Wylie
Watson, Helen Haye and Frank Collier.
"The 39 Steps" contains the blueprint
for jnany of the thrillers Hitchcock was
to make over the next 25 years (notably
"Foreign Correspondent" and "North

by Northwest").
Plays Wednesday evening at 7:30.
As You Like It (1936)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
J.M. Barrie and Barry Cullen adapted
what may be Shakespeare's most rap
turous comedy, cutting it by about half,
and the director, Paul Czinner, makes it
all seem a little academic. But the very
young, astonishingly handsome
Laurence Olivier plays Orlando, and he
makes the film worth seeing. (It also has
delightful, slightly mad late Medieval
costumes.) Rosalind is played by Czin
ner's wife, Elisabeth Bergner, who had
left Germany in the early days of the
Third Reich to become as famous in En
gland as she had been in her homeland.
(Klaus Mann's "Mephisto," written the
same year as this film, includes a charac
ter based on Bergner.) She has a lovely,
lithe camera presence, but she's not right
for the role; her line readings are musi
cal, but she seems to have the tune
wrong. With Sophie Stewart as Celia,
Leon Quartermaine as Jaques, Felix
Aylmer as Duke Frederick, Henry Ain
ley as Duke Senior, Mackenzie Ward as
Touchstone, John Laurie as Oliver,
Dorice Fordred as Audrey, Richard Ain
ley as Silvius, Joan White as Phebe, and
Fisher White as Adam.
Plays Monday with "Twelfth Night."
The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Basil Rathbone plays Sherlock
Holmes and Nigel Bruce Dr. Watson in
the first of 14 films based on the Arthur
Conan Doyle mysteries — and, Holmes
buffs aver, the best. ("Baskervilles" and
"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"
were made at 20th Century-Fox in 1939;
the remaining dozen, released between
1942 and 1946, were done at Universal.)
Sidney Lanfield directed this relaxed,
entertaining picture, from a script by

Ernest Pascal. With Lionel Atwill, John
Carradine, Wendy Barrie, Richard
Greene, Beryl Mercer, Morton Lowry,
E.E. Clive, Ralph Forbes, Barlowe Bor
land and Eily Malyon.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock
(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
This picture squeaks by for the first
half hour on the good will "Star Trek II:
The Wrath of Khan" built up, but that
fades when you realize that no one with
either wit or taste exerted any control
over the project. Leonard Nimoy offers
his typical out-of-whack performance,
only this time from the director's chair:
If you tried to recount the story, it would
make more sense than it does while
you're watching it, because you would
naturally supply the dramatic accents
Nimoy leaves off. Harve Bennett's script
sets up one big scene after another, but
you get the feeling Nimoy hasn't grasped
the logic or the flow of the story — that
he's still waiting for someone to walk
him through it. About two-thirds of the
way through, when the Planet Genesis
(where Spock's body is buried) disin
tegrates, you begin to enjoy the dumb
picture for its colossal ineptitude. With
William Shatner and all the regulars, as
well as Dame Judith Anderson as the
Vulcan high priestess; it's amazing to
hear that richly cadenced voice wrapped
around artificial language that might
have clunked happily through any Maria
Montez film.
Plays today with "Android."
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often hilarious
parody of heavy metal rock, featuring
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean
and Harry Shearer (in a walrus mous
tache) as the main members of the group

whose descent from fame the mock doc
umentary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical numbers aren't
as witty as they might be, except for an
imitation British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays Thurdsay with "Top Secret!"
Rumble Fish (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
All of Francis Ford Coppola's film
version of an adolescent novel by S.E.
Hinton looks like the dream clouds in
"The Elephant Man" — we never get to
wake up in this movie. Stephen Burum
laid his black-and-white photography on
with a trowel: it's so film noir that the
Xanadu scenes in "Citizen Kane" look
naturalistic in comparison. Steam erupts
from every corner, street signs seem to
float in space, and the camera looms so
close to faces that they distort and age.
This must be one of the craziest movies
ever made commercially in this country.
You'd never guess that Coppola was
trying to make a picture about anything
as accessible as frustrated teenagers or
restless young nomads; he's so in love
with his own dumb metaphors and his
own amazing technical skills that they
take over the film. The large cast is full
of talent, but Coppola lets them act and
act, never imposing any controls, until fi
nally they become excessive, narcissistic.
With Mickey Rourke, Matt Dillon,
Diane Lane, Nicolas Cage, Vincent
Spano, and — giving the blue ribbon
dreadful performances — Diana Scarwid
and Dennis Hopper.
Plays Sunday with "Apocalypse
Now."
Heart Like a Wheel (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ken Friedman's script about Shirley
Muldowney, the only driver ever to win
the National Hot Rod Association
World Championship three times, has
clarity, narrative logic and even polish,
and the director, Jonathan Kaplan,
demonstrates intelligence and an unfussy
control of the actors and the material.
The cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto,
has given the film a clean, classically
small-town American look, and the
major emotional encounters are staged
shrewdly and economically. But the
filmmakers show a worse deficiency than
sloppy craftsmanship or histrionic ex

cessiveness: They have ordinary eyes.
They take a predictable, non
exploratory approach to their subject,
and Bonnie Bedelia's competent but un
imaginative performance in the central
role doesn't help. The warm, big-old
bear presences of Beau Bridges (as Shir
ley's partner/lover Connie Kalitta) and
Hoyt Axton (in a much-too-brief bit as
Shirley's father Tex Roque) dominate
the movie.
Plays Wednesday with "Lianna."
Dr. Strangelove (1964)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This black comedy about the series of
blunders leading to a nuclear war is one
of the high points of American film
writing: Few screenplays can compare to
what Terry Southern, Stanley Kubrick
and Peter George have accomplished
here. It is one of Kubrick's best movies
— and his last unpretentious, energetic
one. (At this point he still knew how to
pace and edit.) Peter Sellers is triple cast
as the low-key American president, an
officer who is a perfect parody of British
reserve, and Strangelove, the mad Nazi
scientist whose scenes invade the terri
tory of the surrealists. He gives a bravura
performance that is nearly matched by
George C. Scott's randy, growling gen
eral. With Sterling Hayden as the
megalomaniac who starts the whole
mess, Slim Pickens as a gung-ho pilot,
Keenan Wynn and James Earl Jones.
Plays Thursday with "A Clockwork
Orange."
Lianna(l9B3)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A hopscotch movie — good and bad
scenes, cliches and fresh insights alter
nate straight through. Lianna (Linda
Griffiths) is married to a film instructor,
Dick (Jon DeVries), at a small, inces
tuous East Coast college; fed up with the
life of a faculty spouse, she enrolls in a
child psychology course taught by a visit
ing professor, Ruth (Jane Hallaren), who
becomes her lover. John Sayles wrote,
directed and edited this movie, which is
rewarding and memorable even when it's
awful. Dreadful, implausible encounters
are balanced by funny, offbeat passages
— you can't guess which moments Sayles
is going to pull off. He has a taste for ac
tors who don't come off as actors on
camera, and there are good perfor
mances by Griffiths, Hallaren, Maggie

Renzi and Sayles himself; with others
(De Vries, Jo Henderson as Lianna's
best friend). The near-documentary style
he is trying for fails. Sayles isn't really a
director yet, but he's daring, and he
keeps pushing his writing talents
through.
Plays Wednesday with "Heart Like a
Wheel."
El Norte (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Two young Guatemalans, brother and
sister, whose village has been wiped out
by the army, use their godmother's piti
ful savings to travel into Mexico and —
illegally — into California, the land of
promise the Guatemalans call "el norte"
("the north"). The story is an authentic
tragedy, and one admires Gregory Nava,
the director, and his wife, Anna Thomas,
the screenwriter (they co-produced the
picture), for their persistence in working
on a project of such questionable com
mercial potential. But devotion and in
tegrity and right-mindedness don't nec
essarily produce good movies, and "El
Norte" is an enervating one, featuring
those noble peasant icons who have been
with us since the intellectuals of the left
invented them in the '30s.
Plays tomorrow with "Sugar Cane Al
ley."
A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire
on the polarized state he felt Western so
ciety was approaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is "rehabilitated"
by behavioral psychologists, i.e., reduced
to a benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alternatives — so
cial and anti-social conduct — are
equally repugnant. But in Stanley
Kubrick's film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of society's repre
sentatives are such megalomaniacal half
wits — that we are manipulated into
cheering for his highly objectionable acts
of rebellion. Shrewdly, Kubrick has cast
vivacious, winning Malcolm McDowell
— a performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex. This is a
morally questionable film, directed in
such an impersonal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it seems to
transpire in a vacuum.
Plays Thursday with "Dr. Stran
gelove."


Cat People (1942)
Terman Auditorium
Val Lewton, the horror king at RKO in the 1940sJH
made his name by producing inexpensive, imaginative
scare pictures with a minimum of big set pieces and a
maximum of heightened mood and carefully or
chestrated suggestion. "Cat People," on which he
worked with the director Jacques Tourneur, is the best
remembered of his movies. It contains two famous
scenes — on a street at night where an invisible pres
ence stalks one of the characters, and in a swimming
pool. (Paul Schrader's 1982 remake, which has little
connection to the original, tries to evoke both those se
quences — and fails.) Don't go expecting too much:
DeWitt Bodeen's script is fairly primitive, and the act
ing (by Simone Simon, Kent Smith, Tom Conway, Jane
. Randolph, Jack Holt and others) is wooden, but the
L film is memorably offbeat and creepy.
Plays tomorrow evening at 7:30 and 9:30.
Moscow on the Hudson (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Or "You Can't Go Home Again
Robin Williams gives a brilliant perfor
mance as a saxophonist with a Moscow
circus playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to defect. On
one level Paul Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos) deals
with the movement from repression to
freedom, what freedom implies and what
its constraints and contradictions are; on
another level it's a comedy about the
seductive appeal of American decadence
for Russians (like "Ninotchka" wus):
centrally, though, it's about what hap
pens to a man who makes the choice to
cut himself off from home and famiK
forever. When Mazursky's in high gear,
few directors can touch him: The whole
cast (Cleavant Derricks, Maria Conchita
Alonso, Tiger Haynes, Savely
Kramarov, Elya Baskin, Alexander
Beniaminov) is marvelous, and
sometimes Mazursky engages so many
emotional tracks simultaneously that you
can't analyze exactly which element is af

Plays tonight at 7 and 9:30.
Black and White as Day and Night
(1981)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Wolfgang Petersen's film about the
growing paranoia of an obsessive chess
player (Bruno Ganz) is well made and
effectively structured — like a modest
thriller — but glum and almost humor
less. To really draw us into the hero's
aberrant psychological state, Petersen
would need to find a wilder, more
baroque style, preferably a comic one.
There's only one scene in which he offers
a sharp visual definition of obsession: On
a beach, Ganz improvises a chess board
using sea shells, liie rest of the time it's
only a movie about chess, which is not a
terribly photogenic subject.
Plays Thursday evening at 7:30.
The 39 Steps (1935)
Terman Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock filmed the John
Buchan novel (as adapted by Charles
Bennett and Alma Reville) in 1935, and
though there have been two versions
since, no one has taken much notice of
them. Robert Donat, the most debonair
and best-spoken hero of Hitchcock's
British period, plays the innocent who
gets involved in a spy plot — and is
handcuffed to gorgeous, blonde
' Madeleine Carroll. This movie contains
one of the few poignant scenes in any
Hitchcock picture: a brief study of an un
happy .marriage. (Peggy Ashcroft and
John Laurie play the couple.) With
Godfrey Tearle, Lucie Mannheim, Wylie
Watson, Helen Haye and Frank Collier.
"The 39 Steps" contains the blueprint
for jnany of the thrillers Hitchcock was
to make over the next 25 years (notably
"Foreign Correspondent" and "North

by Northwest").
Plays Wednesday evening at 7:30.
As You Like It (1936)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
J.M. Barrie and Barry Cullen adapted
what may be Shakespeare's most rap
turous comedy, cutting it by about half,
and the director, Paul Czinner, makes it
all seem a little academic. But the very
young, astonishingly handsome
Laurence Olivier plays Orlando, and he
makes the film worth seeing. (It also has
delightful, slightly mad late Medieval
costumes.) Rosalind is played by Czin
ner's wife, Elisabeth Bergner, who had
left Germany in the early days of the
Third Reich to become as famous in En
gland as she had been in her homeland.
(Klaus Mann's "Mephisto," written the
same year as this film, includes a charac
ter based on Bergner.) She has a lovely,
lithe camera presence, but she's not right
for the role; her line readings are musi
cal, but she seems to have the tune
wrong. With Sophie Stewart as Celia,
Leon Quartermaine as Jaques, Felix
Aylmer as Duke Frederick, Henry Ain
ley as Duke Senior, Mackenzie Ward as
Touchstone, John Laurie as Oliver,
Dorice Fordred as Audrey, Richard Ain
ley as Silvius, Joan White as Phebe, and
Fisher White as Adam.
Plays Monday with "Twelfth Night."
The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Basil Rathbone plays Sherlock
Holmes and Nigel Bruce Dr. Watson in
the first of 14 films based on the Arthur
Conan Doyle mysteries — and, Holmes
buffs aver, the best. ("Baskervilles" and
"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"
were made at 20th Century-Fox in 1939;
the remaining dozen, released between
1942 and 1946, were done at Universal.)
Sidney Lanfield directed this relaxed,
entertaining picture, from a script by

Ernest Pascal. With Lionel Atwill, John
Carradine, Wendy Barrie, Richard
Greene, Beryl Mercer, Morton Lowry,
E.E. Clive, Ralph Forbes, Barlowe Bor
land and Eily Malyon.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock
(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
This picture squeaks by for the first
half hour on the good will "Star Trek II:
The Wrath of Khan" built up, but that
fades when you realize that no one with
either wit or taste exerted any control
over the project. Leonard Nimoy offers
his typical out-of-whack performance,
only this time from the director's chair:
If you tried to recount the story, it would
make more sense than it does while
you're watching it, because you would
naturally supply the dramatic accents
Nimoy leaves off. Harve Bennett's script
sets up one big scene after another, but
you get the feeling Nimoy hasn't grasped
the logic or the flow of the story — that
he's still waiting for someone to walk
him through it. About two-thirds of the
way through, when the Planet Genesis
(where Spock's body is buried) disin
tegrates, you begin to enjoy the dumb
picture for its colossal ineptitude. With
William Shatner and all the regulars, as
well as Dame Judith Anderson as the
Vulcan high priestess; it's amazing to
hear that richly cadenced voice wrapped
around artificial language that might
have clunked happily through any Maria
Montez film.
Plays today with "Android."
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often hilarious
parody of heavy metal rock, featuring
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean
and Harry Shearer (in a walrus mous
tache) as the main members of the group

whose descent from fame the mock doc
umentary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical numbers aren't
as witty as they might be, except for an
imitation British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays Thurdsay with "Top Secret!"
Rumble Fish (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
All of Francis Ford Coppola's film
version of an adolescent novel by S.E.
Hinton looks like the dream clouds in
"The Elephant Man" — we never get to
wake up in this movie. Stephen Burum
laid his black-and-white photography on
with a trowel: it's so film noir that the
Xanadu scenes in "Citizen Kane" look
naturalistic in comparison. Steam erupts
from every corner, street signs seem to
float in space, and the camera looms so
close to faces that they distort and age.
This must be one of the craziest movies
ever made commercially in this country.
You'd never guess that Coppola was
trying to make a picture about anything
as accessible as frustrated teenagers or
restless young nomads; he's so in love
with his own dumb metaphors and his
own amazing technical skills that they
take over the film. The large cast is full
of talent, but Coppola lets them act and
act, never imposing any controls, until fi
nally they become excessive, narcissistic.
With Mickey Rourke, Matt Dillon,
Diane Lane, Nicolas Cage, Vincent
Spano, and — giving the blue ribbon
dreadful performances — Diana Scarwid
and Dennis Hopper.
Plays Sunday with "Apocalypse
Now."
Heart Like a Wheel (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ken Friedman's script about Shirley
Muldowney, the only driver ever to win
the National Hot Rod Association
World Championship three times, has
clarity, narrative logic and even polish,
and the director, Jonathan Kaplan,
demonstrates intelligence and an unfussy
control of the actors and the material.
The cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto,
has given the film a clean, classically
small-town American look, and the
major emotional encounters are staged
shrewdly and economically. But the
filmmakers show a worse deficiency than
sloppy craftsmanship or histrionic ex

cessiveness: They have ordinary eyes.
They take a predictable, non
exploratory approach to their subject,
and Bonnie Bedelia's competent but un
imaginative performance in the central
role doesn't help. The warm, big-old
bear presences of Beau Bridges (as Shir
ley's partner/lover Connie Kalitta) and
Hoyt Axton (in a much-too-brief bit as
Shirley's father Tex Roque) dominate
the movie.
Plays Wednesday with "Lianna."
Dr. Strangelove (1964)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This black comedy about the series of
blunders leading to a nuclear war is one
of the high points of American film
writing: Few screenplays can compare to
what Terry Southern, Stanley Kubrick
and Peter George have accomplished
here. It is one of Kubrick's best movies
— and his last unpretentious, energetic
one. (At this point he still knew how to
pace and edit.) Peter Sellers is triple cast
as the low-key American president, an
officer who is a perfect parody of British
reserve, and Strangelove, the mad Nazi
scientist whose scenes invade the terri
tory of the surrealists. He gives a bravura
performance that is nearly matched by
George C. Scott's randy, growling gen
eral. With Sterling Hayden as the
megalomaniac who starts the whole
mess, Slim Pickens as a gung-ho pilot,
Keenan Wynn and James Earl Jones.
Plays Thursday with "A Clockwork
Orange."
Lianna(l9B3)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A hopscotch movie — good and bad
scenes, cliches and fresh insights alter
nate straight through. Lianna (Linda
Griffiths) is married to a film instructor,
Dick (Jon DeVries), at a small, inces
tuous East Coast college; fed up with the
life of a faculty spouse, she enrolls in a
child psychology course taught by a visit
ing professor, Ruth (Jane Hallaren), who
becomes her lover. John Sayles wrote,
directed and edited this movie, which is
rewarding and memorable even when it's
awful. Dreadful, implausible encounters
are balanced by funny, offbeat passages
— you can't guess which moments Sayles
is going to pull off. He has a taste for ac
tors who don't come off as actors on
camera, and there are good perfor
mances by Griffiths, Hallaren, Maggie

Renzi and Sayles himself; with others
(De Vries, Jo Henderson as Lianna's
best friend). The near-documentary style
he is trying for fails. Sayles isn't really a
director yet, but he's daring, and he
keeps pushing his writing talents
through.
Plays Wednesday with "Heart Like a
Wheel."
El Norte (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Two young Guatemalans, brother and
sister, whose village has been wiped out
by the army, use their godmother's piti
ful savings to travel into Mexico and —
illegally — into California, the land of
promise the Guatemalans call "el norte"
("the north"). The story is an authentic
tragedy, and one admires Gregory Nava,
the director, and his wife, Anna Thomas,
the screenwriter (they co-produced the
picture), for their persistence in working
on a project of such questionable com
mercial potential. But devotion and in
tegrity and right-mindedness don't nec
essarily produce good movies, and "El
Norte" is an enervating one, featuring
those noble peasant icons who have been
with us since the intellectuals of the left
invented them in the '30s.
Plays tomorrow with "Sugar Cane Al
ley."
A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire
on the polarized state he felt Western so
ciety was approaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is "rehabilitated"
by behavioral psychologists, i.e., reduced
to a benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alternatives — so
cial and anti-social conduct — are
equally repugnant. But in Stanley
Kubrick's film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of society's repre
sentatives are such megalomaniacal half
wits — that we are manipulated into
cheering for his highly objectionable acts
of rebellion. Shrewdly, Kubrick has cast
vivacious, winning Malcolm McDowell
— a performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex. This is a
morally questionable film, directed in
such an impersonal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it seems to
transpire in a vacuum.
Plays Thursday with "Dr. Stran
gelove."


Cat People (1942)
Terman Auditorium
Val Lewton, the horror king at RKO in the 1940sJH
made his name by producing inexpensive, imaginative
scare pictures with a minimum of big set pieces and a
maximum of heightened mood and carefully or
chestrated suggestion. "Cat People," on which he
worked with the director Jacques Tourneur, is the best
remembered of his movies. It contains two famous
scenes — on a street at night where an invisible pres
ence stalks one of the characters, and in a swimming
pool. (Paul Schrader's 1982 remake, which has little
connection to the original, tries to evoke both those se
quences — and fails.) Don't go expecting too much:
DeWitt Bodeen's script is fairly primitive, and the act
ing (by Simone Simon, Kent Smith, Tom Conway, Jane
. Randolph, Jack Holt and others) is wooden, but the
L film is memorably offbeat and creepy.
Plays tomorrow evening at 7:30 and 9:30.
Moscow on the Hudson (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Or "You Can't Go Home Again
Robin Williams gives a brilliant perfor
mance as a saxophonist with a Moscow
circus playing a New York tour, who
decides at the last moment to defect. On
one level Paul Mazursky's tragicomedy
(written with Leon Capetanos) deals
with the movement from repression to
freedom, what freedom implies and what
its constraints and contradictions are; on
another level it's a comedy about the
seductive appeal of American decadence
for Russians (like "Ninotchka" wus):
centrally, though, it's about what hap
pens to a man who makes the choice to
cut himself off from home and famiK
forever. When Mazursky's in high gear,
few directors can touch him: The whole
cast (Cleavant Derricks, Maria Conchita
Alonso, Tiger Haynes, Savely
Kramarov, Elya Baskin, Alexander
Beniaminov) is marvelous, and
sometimes Mazursky engages so many
emotional tracks simultaneously that you
can't analyze exactly which element is af
fecting you most profoundly.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Casablanca (1943)
Kresge Auditorium
In some theaters, when this movie is
shown, audiences bring wine to toast the
"Marseillaise" scene and everyone
knows all the famous lines, from"I stick
my head out for nobody" to "Louis, this
could be the start of a beautiful
friendship." Humphrey Bogart, at his
most romantic, plays Rick, who owns a
cafe in wartime Casablanca; lngrid
Bergman, at her most beautiful, is Use.
