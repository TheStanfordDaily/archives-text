## Soccer team to battle USIU 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
U.S. International University comes to Stanford
tomorrow at 11 a.m. to play the Cardinal men's
soccer team in a non-conference match.
The Cardinal goes into the game after a 1-0 vic
tory over St. Mary's College Wednesday. Sopho
more fullback Tom Rafalovich scored his third goal
of the season, and senior goalkeeper Willy
Burkhardt recorded his third shutout this year to
lead Stanford to the victory.
The shutout was Burkhardt's 22nd of his career.
He broke the school record for career shutouts last
year, finishing with 19, so every shutout this year
adds to his record. His 55 saves and 1.38 goals
against average put him among the top Pacific Soc

cer Conference goalkeepers.
U.S. International is from San Diego. True to its
name, its roster lists a number of foreign players,
according to Stanford's sports information office.
Although U.S. International's record is 7-6, Stan
ford Head Coach Sam Koch said USIU beat Bos
ton University and the University of Rhode Island,
both good teams, during an East Coast road trip.
"They are tough, even though their record is 7-
6," Koch said. "They have the capability to beat
good teams."
Stanford will have to pay close attention to U.S.
International striker Andy Walker, who has nine
goals and four assists this season. But Walker will
face a Stanford defense that has stiffened in its last
few games.
"Our defense has improved," said Koch, who

made a change recently in the Cardinal lineup,
from three forwards and three midfielders to two
forwards and four midfielders.
"It (the new formation) is tougher to defend
against and strengthens our defense in the middle
of the field," Koch said. "For our game plan, it is
the best formation to use."
The Cardinal's injury list will soon be shorter by
two midfielders, according to Koch. Freshman
Brian Mahaffey is expected to be ready to play this
weekend, and Mike Mossmer, a sophomore, should
be ready some time next week, although Koch calls
Mossmer's situation "touch and go." But they
won't automatically return to the starting spots,
Koch said. "They're going to have to win their way
back into the lineup."
