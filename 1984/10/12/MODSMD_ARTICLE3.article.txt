# SF police OK rally
## Big Game route to change 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN 
The Big Game Rally in San Fran
cisco next month will be five or six
blocks longer than last year's, thanks
to yesterday's negotiations between
the University and San Francisco
police.
The very existence of the rally "is
an achievement in itself," said Band
Manager Scott Gode. Gode and
Larry Watson, an executive member
of the Stanford Axe Committee, met
with Sgt. Joseph Rosset of the San
Francisco Police Department to dis
cuss the possibility of obtaining a
parade permit for the Big Game rally.
"When we first arrived, he
(Rosset) wasn't going to let Stanford
have a rally," Gode said. Rosset
pulled a file containing numerous ex
amples over the past years of student
behavior inappropriate to a rally, in
cluding the destruction of private
property of San Francisco residents.
Rosset became increasingly con
ciliatory, however, after hearing plans
to improve the organization of busing
students to the rally and to encourage
stricter alcohol policies, Gode said.
Gode and Watson also showed
Rosset letters and past articles from
the Stanford community supporting
the continuation of the rally, and sug
gested alternative routes, starting at
either Columbus Avenue or the
Hyatt Hotel, which would cover more
visual areas of the City.
These proposals were denied,
however, because the police are still
concerned about the injuries and lack
of control of two years ago, Gode
said. The compromise of moving the
starting point of the parade five to six
blocks farther southeast is designed
to alleviate the shortness of the route,
allowing the buses to arrive at Fisher
man's Wharf before the Band starts
playing.
A similar meeting took place yes
terday on campus among Norm Rob
inson, associate dean of Residential
Education, Jim Kohn, drum major of
the Band, and Jeff Stevens, member

of the Axe Committee. It is the first
in a series of meetings designed to or
ganize the rally.
"I had concerns," Robinson said.
"I felt last year's rally went very well.
I want the care that went into the
planning of last year's to go into this
year's. I am looking forward to a
great rally in the City."
The behavior of students in past
rallies, especially concerning the use
of large quantities of alcohol, led to
numerous complaints both by citizens
and police officers of San Francisco.
Furthermore, the shortness of last
year's parade route dampened the
spirits of some students.
The University has agreed to pay a
$2,500 bond to Aquatic Park and
take out a $1 million insurance
policy, clearing the city of responsi
bility for any potential damages. Wat
son said he was told by the park ser
vice last year that "Aquatic Park had
never been left in better shape."
Sponsors and financing of the rally
are still undetermined. The Axe
Committee placed calls to both Pepsi
and Miller, which sponsored the
parade last year. Committee mem
bers are also looking for new spon
sors, such as Stroh's and Adidas.
Committee members had hoped to
obtain additional funds from blotters
distributed at the beginning of the
school year, but they only broke
even.
Plans by the Axe Committee are
already under way to coordinate
busing to and from the rally. The
committee hopes to contract out
buses to dorms and fraternities,
thereby having more control ovai the
amount of alcohol brought into San
Francisco.
The number of rally monitors will
be increased from 100 to 120. The
monitors will be situated at the end of
the parade, where much of the distur
bance has occurred. They will wear
green caps and shirts, as they did last
year. Fraternities as well as volunteer
groups are under consideration for
these positions.
