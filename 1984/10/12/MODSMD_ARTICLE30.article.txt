## Adventure's just outside and down the street 
### 
Students at UCLA, the University
of California at Berkeley, Arizona
State University and many other
schools are proud that their presence,
which may be somewhat obnoxious to
the surrounding community, spurred
The growth of a college town around
their respective campuses.
They find as much, if not more, to
do off campus as they do on. Most
students at Stanford have searched —
in vain it seems — for something even
remotely resembling "life" off
campus. But for those of you who
gave up in despair, read on. Though
Palo Alto is no college town when
compared to Westwood, there is
indeed "life" off campus, and Uni
versity Avenue is living proof.
Two theaters, the New Varsity on
University Avenue and the Bijou, lo
cated at 640 Emerson St., both offer
a selection of films as well as live en

tertainment definitely worthy of the
admission price and aimed to appeal
to younger crowds.
Not far from the Bijou is Water
course Way, a hot-tub center at 165
Channing Avenue. You can't find a
better way to relax after a tough in
tramural competition, a frustrating
problem set or paper, or an enjoyable
lunch or dinner with a friend.
Back on University Avenue proper
are the Stanford Theatre, bookstores,
sporting goods stores, a thrift store
and a number of other shops. If
you're hungry, there are numerous
restaurants, bars and pubs as well as
more ice cream, gelato and yogurt
places than are possible to mention
by name. And University Creamery is
open 24 hours every day except Sun
day.
Perhaps most extraordinary is Lid
dicoat's. Outside is a patio with tables

and a flower cart. Inside is an odd as
sortment of cafes and tiny restaurants
serving foods from numerous
cultures.
Whether you dine at one of the
many little restaurants in Liddicoat's,
one of the other restaurants
reviewed, or opt for food service, you
may want to go out afterward. Trans
portation need not be a concern, for
everything we'll review on these
pages is within bicycling or even
walking distance.
Of course, if you feel like going to
Watercourse Way to immerse your
self in the soothing waters of one of
their hot tubs, you may be too relaxed
to walk home. Not to worry. Splurge,
and call a taxi or a friend!
Watercourse Way is intended to be
restful to the mind, body and spirit.
Open seven days a week from 9 a.m.
to 11 p.m., guests can choose to relax

in a room complete with a hot tub,
sauna or steam, and a cold plungt.
Some of the tubs are wood which are
very appealing aesthetically. But
what probably makes the wood tubs
so desirable is their rich, earthy
aroma. The acrylic tubs, however, are
just as soothing and refreshing.
Rooms with a tub only are less expen
sive ($l5 per hour for two people
during the evening and $5.50 per per
son before 5:30 p.m.); however, the
more lavish rooms are worth the ad
ditional $3.
The combination of hot tub and
sauna or steam followed by a dip in
the cold plunge is sure to rejuvenate.
So remember Watercourse Way the
next time you need to relieve built-up
tensions or just want to treat yourself
to a warm and wonderful bathing ex
perience. For more information, the
telephone number is 329-8827.
