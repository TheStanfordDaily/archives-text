to be low-fat, low-cholesterol, and
dietetic. And it has to taste great.
Who ya gonna call? Peppino's!
Located in Liddicoat's in beautiful
downtown Palo Alto, Peppino's is
what its owner claims it to be: the
only vegetarian-dietetic-Italian fast
food restaurant in the world.
The atmosphere is simple: a stylish
neon sign, several modest tables, a
jug of wine and a loaf of bread. All of
the food is cooked from scratch, by
Peppino, and is proudly displayed in a
heated glass case in front. The menu
ranges from whole wheat pizza to ric
cotta ravioli to stuffed peppers and
various pasta dishes.

Drinks include freshly made juices,
and for dessert there is gelato a la
Peppino and homemade cakes and
pies a la "Mama" (Peppino's mo
ther). Peppino uses no salt and no
sugar in his dishes and everything is
either cooked or baked â€” nothing is
fried.
The taste is sensational: flavorful

tomato sauce with a special blend of
herbs, sweet ravioli which not
hide the taste of the cheese, tender
lasagna which makes one think it was
never supposed to contain meat. We
sampled all of these entrees as well as
a triple pasta dish, freshly baked
bread, whole wheat pizza, fresh or
ange juice and, for dessert, banana
seedless-grape gelato.
The meal was outstanding, unusual
and entertaining. Best of all, when we
finished the gelato, we did not feel
stuffed. The absence of heavy oils and
rich seasonings left a refreshingly
clean taste in our mouths and a

smooth, satisfying feeling in our
stomachs.
When we asked Peppino about his
ideas on cooking, he gave us his phil
osophy of culinary art. Having
worked at the Stanford Research In
stitute (now SRI-lnternational) for
twenty years, Peppino has a consider
able background in heath research.
He has tried to incorporate his sci
entific background into his cooking.
That is, his goal has been to create
food which is as pleasing to the palate
as it is healthy for the body.
Indeed he has been successful in
removing the fats, oils and cholesterol
of classical recipes while retaining
their traditional flavor. But we feel
the best part about Peppino's is the
personal attention you receive from
the chef. Very few places offer the
warmth and "at home" feeling found
at Peppino's.
But don't go for the warmth; don't
go for the atmosphere; don't go for
the food; don't even go for the neon
sign. Go to Peppino's because we told
you to . . . and because it's great.
Peppino's is open Sunday through
Friday for lunch and dinner until 8
p.m. Entrees range in price from $3
to $5.
