# Laughter shakes the Bijou Theatre
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
Bijou Theatre
640 Emerson Street
Palo Alto
326-6127
Beginning Saturday, the Bijou
Theatre will regularly feature two live
comedy acts at 7 and 9:30 p.m. on
Saturdays.
The Bijou regularly plays new
releases and classic film series.
However, due to increasing
popularity, it has decided to reserve
Saturdays for live comedy entertain
ment.
Each week it will host a differ
ent guest or guests. Saturday, Barry
Sobel, a local comic and one of San
Francisco's fastest-rising comedy
stars, will be the main attraction. At
23, Sobel is one of the youngest com
ics in the area.
The shows are open to persons of
all ages, so no I.D. is required unless
you want to purchase a beer. The re
duced admission price for students is
$5 if paid in advance. A special pass
is also available, entitling the holder
to five shows for $20.
Inside, the Bijou looks like most
other theaters, although it is perhaps
slightly older and more dilapidated.
However, the seats are comfortable
and the coffee is good. The Bijou
prides itself on its quality concessions.
Instead of Milk Duds and M&Ms, it
sells Toblerone chocolate, truffles
and home-made pastries. Also on the
menu is cafe au lait and other fancy
coffees, beer and soft drinks.
Saturday won't be the first time the
Bijou has brought top quality com
edians to Palo Alto. A few weeks ago

a line formed early as people waited
to see Will Durst, the winner of the
San Francisco Comedy Award.
Following Sobel will be Rick and
Ruby Oct. 27. Their claim to fame in
cludes an appearance on "Mork and
Mindy."
Duck's Breath Mystery Theater
will make two special appearances on
Nov. 2 and 3. This group of college

cronies got its start on National
Public Radio. In his guise as" Mr. Sci
ence," one of the group explains that
dandruff is dead brain cells. There are
Duck's Breath films and Duck's
Breath commercials and even
records. Its motto is "Dare to be
stupid" and its zany antics, non-stop
satire and madcap hilarity will keep
you laughing.

When you're feeling the effects of
the sun and beer after the game on
Saturday, don't complain that there's
nothing to do. Just head for Univer
sity Avenue. And when you end up at
the Bijou buying tickets for Sobel's
show, ask for a program listing up
coming events as well.
