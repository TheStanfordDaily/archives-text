### CATHY JANUS 
La Tour
525 University Ave., third floor
Palo Alto
321-6954
Choose me to review a French res
taurant, I pleaded, and they did. I
visibly relaxed when the selecting
panel didn't bother to delve too
deeply into the facts as I presented
them. 1 knew this was the year of im
agery and 1 could act as well as the
next person.
Have I traveled in France? Yes,
and consequently Miave eaten in
France as well. Fortunately I didn't
have to reveal where. My first
venture into a restaurant in France
could hardly be classified as fine
cuisine. My hosts thought to please
their 14 year old visitor by treating
her to the favorite American repast
— namely, a hamburger. And so I ate
at Wimpy's where a hamburger is a
ground beef patty with a fried egg on
top. So, yes I know what awful food
looks and tastes like.
But now I have experienced real
French table d'hote and I didn't visit
France to do so either. La Tour, an
elegant but not at all stuffy French
restaurant,' is located on the third
floor of the tall office complex on
University Avenue. My date and I
were as much in awe of the view of
the rising moon as the rich decor
inside.
Next we turned to our menus, writ
ten in both French and English. If you
still are not sure what to order, the
waiters, as authentically French as the
food and decor, are also very helpful.
Prices were not outrageous, which
surprised me. (So, maybe I do have
some knowledge of French restau
rants!) A good bottle of California
white wine cost $10.50, and if even
this is too steep, you can order wine
by the glass or a non-alcoholic altern
ative.
The menu features hors d'oevres,
soups, salads, desserts and the
entrees. Perhaps desserts precede the
main courses to remind guests who
plan to order the Souffle Gran Mar
nier or the Souffle Rothschild (with
fruit) to allow 45 minutes preparation
time. Unless you don't mind waiting,
it is advisable to order the souffle at
the same time as the main course.

My friend and I decided to begin
with Escargots de Bourgogne aux
Noisettes ($5.75). While we waited
we were served French bread and bis
cuits. The waiter then returned push
ing a cart upon which perched five . . .
pastries? He nonchalantly asked us
how he should split the five creations
between the two of us, and it was
decided the "lady" would receive
three. Once they sat on my plate, I
saw that underneath these flaky
pastry puffs lay my escargot. Not only
was this concoction attractive, it was
practical. The delicious escargot were
piping hot.
Once again the waiter came to our
table, but this time his cart was laden
with delicacies. My main course did
not even fit on a single plate. I or
dered La Brochette de Crevettes
Monte Carlo ($l6), which in English
is broiled prawns with tomatoes and
spices. Circling the prawns were more
flaky pastries, this time in the shape
of crescents, tiny steamed broccolli
flowers, and small russet potatoes.
The meal also included a side dish of
spinach, which tasted incredibly
good. My friend ordered Filet aux
Trois Poivres ($15.75), or fillet saute
with sauce of three types of pepper
corns. He was sold on La Tour, claim
ing it was the best restaurant, French
or otherwise, at which we have eaten.
Similar to my entree, his was also ar
tistically arranged, including a variety
of colorful, perfectly prepared
vegetables.
Perhaps what I appreciated as
much as the quiet, tasteful atmo
sphere and the delicious meal was the
fact that I did not feel stuffed when
our plates were cleared away. I could
look forward to dessert, confident
that when I left La Tour I would be
satiated, not sick.
Our Souffle Gran Marnier ($11.50
for two) was a masterpiece. Light and
fluffy, the souffle was a perfect finale.
La Tour is a restaurant for special
occasions, perfect when your parents
visit, you want to celebrate your own
or a friend's birthday, high LSAT
scores or any other excuse you can
think of to treat yourself to a fine
dining experience. La Tour is a
temptation not to be resisted.

cuisine. My hosts thought to please
their 14 year old visitor by treating
her to the favorite American repast
— namely, a hamburger. And so I ate
at Wimpy's where a hamburger is a
ground beef patty with a fried egg on
top. So, yes I know what awful food
looks and tastes like.
But now I have experienced real
French table d'hote and I didn't visit
France to do so either. La Tour, an
elegant but not at all stuffy French
restaurant,' is located on the third
floor of the tall office complex on
University Avenue. My date and I
were as much in awe of the view of
the rising moon as the rich decor
inside.
Next we turned to our menus, writ
ten in both French and English. If you
still are not sure what to order, the
waiters, as authentically French as the
food and decor, are also very helpful.
Prices were not outrageous, which
surprised me. (So, maybe I do have
some knowledge of French restau
rants!) A good bottle of California
white wine cost $10.50, and if even
this is too steep, you can order wine
by the glass or a non-alcoholic altern
ative.
The menu features hors d'oevres,
soups, salads, desserts and the
entrees. Perhaps desserts precede the
main courses to remind guests who
plan to order the Souffle Gran Mar
nier or the Souffle Rothschild (with
fruit) to allow 45 minutes preparation
time. Unless you don't mind waiting,
it is advisable to order the souffle at
the same time as the main course.

My friend and I decided to begin
with Escargots de Bourgogne aux
Noisettes ($5.75). While we waited
we were served French bread and bis
cuits. The waiter then returned push
ing a cart upon which perched five . . .
pastries? He nonchalantly asked us
how he should split the five creations
between the two of us, and it was
decided the "lady" would receive
three. Once they sat on my plate, I
saw that underneath these flaky
pastry puffs lay my escargot. Not only
was this concoction attractive, it was
practical. The delicious escargot were
piping hot.
Once again the waiter came to our
table, but this time his cart was laden
with delicacies. My main course did
not even fit on a single plate. I or
dered La Brochette de Crevettes
Monte Carlo ($l6), which in English
is broiled prawns with tomatoes and
spices. Circling the prawns were more
flaky pastries, this time in the shape
of crescents, tiny steamed broccolli
flowers, and small russet potatoes.
The meal also included a side dish of
spinach, which tasted incredibly
good. My friend ordered Filet aux
Trois Poivres ($15.75), or fillet saute
with sauce of three types of pepper
corns. He was sold on La Tour, claim
ing it was the best restaurant, French
or otherwise, at which we have eaten.
Similar to my entree, his was also ar
tistically arranged, including a variety
of colorful, perfectly prepared
vegetables.
Perhaps what I appreciated as
much as the quiet, tasteful atmo
sphere and the delicious meal was the
fact that I did not feel stuffed when
our plates were cleared away. I could
look forward to dessert, confident
that when I left La Tour I would be
satiated, not sick.
Our Souffle Gran Marnier ($11.50
for two) was a masterpiece. Light and
fluffy, the souffle was a perfect finale.
La Tour is a restaurant for special
occasions, perfect when your parents
visit, you want to celebrate your own
or a friend's birthday, high LSAT
scores or any other excuse you can
think of to treat yourself to a fine
dining experience. La Tour is a
temptation not to be resisted.
