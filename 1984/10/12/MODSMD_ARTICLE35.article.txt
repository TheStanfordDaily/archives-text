Le Normandie Cafe's combination
of quaint French sidewalk cafe atmo
sphere with delicious French food
makes it a good place for a leisurely,
romantic dinner.
The prices at the University Ave
nue cafe are a little steep for most
students, though rather typical for
nice French restaurants in the area:
The dinner entrees range from about
$8.95 to $13.50.
But the cafe definitely offers

Perhaps the most appealing aspect of
Le Normandie is its traditional French
cafe atmosphere. Small, white-draped
tables inside and out provide an au
thentic French touch.

veal cordon bleu ($8.50), French
pastries ($2.50), crepes ($5.50) and
duck a P orange ($10.50).
Le Normandie's fresh seafood
entrees, featuring halibut ($9.50),
fresh trout ($9.50), and grilled sal
mon with hollandaise sauce ($11.50),
are brought in daily from Half Moon

The service at the restaurant is
friendly and helpful, though the pace

Le Normandie offers a number of
traditional French appetizers, includ

minded. A wide variety of continental
coffees are also available.

We ordered the coeur de filet
provencale ($13.50) and the shrimp
scampi ($8.95), both of which were
steeped in a delectable, delicately
spiced sauce. The thick, juicy filet,
recommended by our waiter, was
served on a bed of potatoes and sur
rounded by expertly cooked carrots.
The shrimp scampi, covered by a
mouth-watering sauce, was compli
mented by lightly spiced carrots and
rice.
We were somewhat disappointed
with the size of the servings, however;
if it hadn't been for the complimen
tary basket of baguette that was
replenished throughout the meal, our

hunger wouldn't have been com
pletely satisfied.
The cafe offers a delicious assort
ment of desserts, including mousse au
chocolat ($3.50) and crepes suzette
($5.95).
Perhaps the most appealing aspect
of Le Normandie is its traditional
French cafe atmosphere. Small,
white-draped tables inside and out
provide an authentic French touch.

offers less expensive breakfasts and
lunches without waiter service.
