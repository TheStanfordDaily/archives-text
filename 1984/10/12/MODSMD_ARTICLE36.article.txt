Only the word "eclectic" can do
justice to the New Varsity, the self
proclaimed movie palace/cafe/bar a
few blocks down University Avenue.
Omitted in the New Varsity's appel
lation are its performance showcases
of classical, rock, folk and jazz music
and its private party services. Did I
mention the videos at the bar and a
high people-watching potential'.'
Yet I went there to eat, not to
praise them. That pun would have
been better if the New Varsity served

The end of the meal doesn't mean the
end of the evening at the New Varsity.

Caesar salad, but the cafe offers a va
riety of spinach salads, all less than
$3. Sitting in the cool environs
outside (you have a choice), however,
my date and I opted tor soup as an
appetizer.
We took the New Varsity's eclec
ticism to heart; 1 ordered French
onion soup gratinee ($2.60) while he
chose a bowl of black bean soup with
sour cream ($2.25/$ 1.50 a cup). In
doing so we dangerously risked the
fear of parents everywhere: spoiling
our appetites. My ramekin of soup for
once had a hearty portion of cheese
over a generous crouton, making a
wonderfully gooey mess down to the
last drops. A fair amount of onions
also put in an appearance. My one
regret was succumbing to the tempta
tion to taste the liquid before it had
properly cooled. How do you say
"yumm" and "ouch at the same
time?
Although the dollop of sour cream
on the black bean soup seemed
token, my date devoured the ethnic
but-wholesome (Yucatan cuisine
doesn't usually pop into mind as a
nutritionist's buzzword) concoction
happily. A piece of French bread and
a pat of butter accompanied the black
bean soup.
As we were finishing our soup, the
competent waitress brought our
entrees. Although small, the New
Varsity menu balances a variety of
cuisines. Skipping the selection ol
California-style hamburgers
(available with chili, mushrooms and
the übiquitous avocado from $3.75-
$4.40), we had chosen the Greek dish
moussaka ($5.50) and chicken Orien
tal salad ($4.75). The latter is also
available on the Wonder Bread of the
elite, the croissant, for $4.25.

I must admit, my date and I often
split on questions of taste along quan
tity vs. quality lines. He enjoyed the
well-seasoned moussaka (a Greek
casserole of ground beef, eggplant
and tomato sauce topped with a be
chamel sauce), although he's had
"Greeker" renditions, especially for
its filling portion.
1 had debated whether to order the
chicken salad or the burrito made
with grilled chicken breast, black
beans, cheese, tomato, onions and
cilantro in a flour tortilla ($4.95).
With meat salads, there's always the
question of how much fat lurks under
an obscuring sauce. (The thicker the

sauce, the more suspiciously I chew.)
My fat phobia need not have flared,
however, in apprehension of the New
Varsity's recipe. The light, surpris
ingly tangy dressing enhanced the
deliciously lean chunks of chicken,
tossed with water chestnuts, raisins,
almond wafers and chow mein
noodles over fresh lettuce leaves.
The New Varsity is a place where
the coffee list outstrips the wine list,
but my date thought his glass of the
house burgundy, a C. K. Mondavi
vintage, palatable at $1.50.
We turned to the coffee after
having consumed the entrees, with
help from my date for my portion.
The espresso at 90 cents was a
good deal, except for its lack of lemon
rind, and the powerful brew helped
offset the sinful desserts we indulged
in.
Showing remarkable blood-sugar
tolerance, my date feasted on a slice
of pitch-black chocolate mousse torte
($1.95) while I savored one of
raspberry mazarin ($1.95). Mine
topped a baklava-like base of honey,
nuts and pastry flakes with a thick
fruit jam. His can only be described
as equivalent to mainlining a melted
bag of chocolate chips. All of the New
Varsity's sweetmeats come from the
Sweet Things bakery a few doors
down University Avenue.
The end of the meal doesn't mean
the end of the evening at this eatery.
Our waitress, who was affable with
out being chatty, informed us that
purchase of a dinner entree meant we
could see the film du jour for only $1
each (regularly $4.00 for adults,
$2.50 twilight/matinee.) Serendipity,
that aptitude for accidental fortunate
discoveries, had struck: "The Return
of Martin Guerre" with Gerard

Depardieu, a movie I had meant to
see but hadn't yet, was the night's
feature.
Waiting in the bar for showtime,
we began to understand the hostess's
comments on the diversity of the New
Varsity's patrons. The mulling crowd
mixed Palo Alto high school post
punks with Silicon Valley white
("ring around the. . .") collar execu
tives, granny glasses with Vuarnets,
and drop-dead fashion with the
merely drooped. You will find other
Stanford students there, but they
won't be advertising it. This gives a

welcome sense of privacy without
alienation, as often happens at a
town-favored hangout.
The theater was comfortably plush
without being formal. Like most good
repertory movie houses, this one
presents daily double features of clas
sics, foreign films and recent com
mercial releases. Check local listings
or call 323-6411 for schedule details.
The New Varsity also provides live
entertainment; it will branch into big
time acts tomorrow (Oct. 13) when
Romeo Void performs; audience

members at all special acts receive
preferred seating with dinner.
Ambiance and aliment (fun and
food?) combined for a pleasant even
ing for us at the New Varsity; given
the eclectic offerings in meals, movies
and music, it could happen for you
too.
Conveniently located next door to
the New Varsity is Swensen's Ice
Cream Parlour. Immediately inside
the door ar®' couple* o# tables and
some bar stools. You'll always see a
variety of people sitting and standing
just inside the entrance with their

oversized ice cream cones, milk
shakes or sundaes. Judging by the
number of dessert parlors springing
up on University Avenue, ice cream
must be a favorite of everyone. Swen
son's is one of the oldest, and if you
ask them, also one of the finest. They
still make their ice-cream fresh on the
premises. To further entice healthy
Stanford students, they periodically
advertise in The Daily, offering two
for-one sundaes. This coupon is
definitely worth clipping out.
