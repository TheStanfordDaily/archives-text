# Ex-CIA agents decry U.S. foreign policies
## 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
Former CIA agents David Mac-
Michael and John Stockwell called
the Reagan administration's policy of
covert action against Nicaragua a
prelude to full-scale war as the two
addressed an overflow crowd in
Kresge Auditorium last night.
"Our current policy is based on the
childish insecurity rooted in the gov
ernment of the United States to give
up the direct hegemonic control over
the nations of Central America," said
Mac Michael, a high-level Central
American analyst for the CIA from
1981-1983.
Mac Michael challenged the
Reagan administration's claim that
Nicaragua's Sandinista government
has been exporting massive ship
ments of arms to the FLMN, the Sal
vadoran guerilla group.
"The current president has falsely
justified his reason for opposing the
Sandinistas and for this reason does

not deserve to be heard with
respect," Mac Michael said. "This ad
ministration has provided documents
all of which are either weak or a hoax.
"If you had the temerity to deliver
any papers like these to your profes
sors, your tenure at this university of
higher learning would be seriously
held in jeopardy," Mac Michael con
tinued.
Stockwell also had harsh words for
America's policy of covert war.
"The U.S. policy of destabilization
in Nicaragua is one example of many
where the U.S. does not like the gov
ernment in power and tries to take it
apart by punishing the people so
much that the fabric of the country
simply collapses," Stockwell said.
Stockwell was commander of the
ClA's covert war in Angola, CIA
chief of station in Vietnam, and ad
viser to the National Security Council
under Henry Kissinger. He resigned
from the CIA in 1977 and is looked
upon as the highest-ranking CIA offi

cial ever to "defect" from the agency.
"These people dying under CIA
covert action aren't communists but
[are] all of the Third World
denomination," Stockwell said. "We
try to suppress revolution and subver
sion by teaching torture."
Stockwell called the CIA "the larg
est terrorist organization in the
world."
"The direct victims of U.S. covert
action total between one and three
million killed," Stockwell said. "The
U.S. talks peace and greatness and is
one of the most militaristic societies
in the world."
Stockwell, in addition, sees the
Vietnam and Korean wars as direct
consequences of covert war, and
believes a war in Nicaragua will be
the next result of U.S. policy.
"President Reagan has said, 'We
will do whatever it takes to get rid of
the Sandinistas.' The result of such
thinking is war," Stockwell said.
