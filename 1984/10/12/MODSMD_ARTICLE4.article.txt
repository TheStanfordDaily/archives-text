# Fraternities give critical response
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A letter from Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons about the future of
the fraternal system at the University
got mixed reactions from the heads of
fraternities here.
The five-page letter, sent last
Friday, presented an agenda for dis
cussion between the University and
Greek organizations. The letter also
said an atmosphere of mutual trust
must be cultivated between the two
groups.
According to Rick Hoskins, chair
man of the Interfraternity Council,
the University is looking too much at
the negative aspects of fraternities.
He said the University "can't make a
valid decision" about fraternities
without first examining the strengths
of the organizations and the "things
that fraternities have the potential of
doing."
Some of these strengths are com
munity service projects and
leadership-building within the
houses, Hoskins said.
When one fraternity is in trouble,
Hoskins said, the University points a
finger at the entire fraternity system.
He added that when an organization
such as Sigma Chi has a successful
community service record, the Uni
versity asks why other fraternities
aren't doing the same.
On a positive note, Hoskins said he
is excited about the implementation
of the fourth recommendation made
last spring by the Task Force on Fra
ternities and Sororities.

That recommendation, one of six
made by the task force, states, "The
University should acknowledge the
value provided students by fraternal
organizations, and should afford
them University support and guid
ance."
Hoskins is also pleased with the
University's move to establish a
fraternal affairs adviser. He said last
spring there was "a gap between what
the task force was really trying to ac
complish and how fraternities were
responding."
The draft for the position of frater
nal affairs adviser states that the ad
viser will "provide service, counsel,
and training to Stanford fraternities
and sororities, and will act as a liaison
between those groups and University
departments, alumni and national
fraternity organizations."
John Peterson, president of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, said he is "quite hear
tened" by Lyons' letter for two
reasons.
He said the University has outlined
its dilemma for the first time and
given the reasons behind the task
force's study of fraternities. He said
the task force pursued "a behind-the
back approach" last spring, adding
that he was "pleased to see Dean
Lyons pushing for mutual trust."
He said the first step in clearing up
the problems surrounding the frater
nal system is "coming up with a set of
standards for existing fraternities."
He added that in the past no one was
sure what the University expected
from fraternities.
Peterson agreed with Hoskins that
a fraternal adviser "should prove to
facilitate the process" of dealing with
affairs between fraternities and the
University.
Ethan Orlinsky, president of the
unhoused fraternity Sigma Alpha
Mu, said that Lyons is posing
legitimate questions about the equity
of subjective selection in housing.
"And furthermore, he suggests that
the present situation, where many of
the fraternal organizations are un
housed, is somewhat unfair," he said.
Orlinsky added that while he is
"pleased to have the University's
support" as a member of an un
housed fraternity, he is "wary, still, of
putting too much trust in an institu
tion, i.e., Stanford, that not only has
never before spoken out in favor of
fraternities, but has also tried to
prevent the growth of the Greek sys
tem in years past."
