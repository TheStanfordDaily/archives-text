### MARK BEYREIS 
A panel of three professional journalists
judged Democratic vice-presidential nominee
Geraldine Ferraro to be the winner over Vice
President George Bush in last night's debate.
John Jacobs, a political reporter for the San
Francisco Examiner, said Ferraro won an upset
for two reasons. "First, when you have com
paratively little experience and don't make any
serious mistakes and can stand on the same
stage without embarassing yourself, you have
won," Jacobs said.
"Second, she won because she won," 1 he
added. "She was sharp and precise."
Jacobs said Ferraro's closing statement was
"as eloquent a statement as I have heard in this
campaign year."

"She introduced a new idea of the definition
of patriotism," Jacobs added.
Paul Voakes, editorial writer for the Penin
sula Times Tribune, agreed that Ferraro won.
He said that Ferraro capitalized on the fact that
Bush was the underdog.
It was up to Bush, Voakes said, to prove he
could stand up to a female candidate. "Ferraro
handled him like a calm and collected mother
handles a rebellious teenager," Voakes said.
Evelyn Fierro, a producer and writer for
KNBC-TV in Burbank, Calif., also described
Ferraro as being tough but motherly. "I think
she won your hearts," Fierro said. "She had a
motherly but knowledgable school-marm

quality. She is strong and has a swift
rebuttal."
The panel members agreed that the
tone each candidate set was impor
tant. Jacobs said Ferraro has a
reputation for being sassy but that in
this case she set the right tone. He
said that though Bush was
knowledgable and factual, through
out the debate he had a "gee-whiz"
attitude.
Fierro agreed that Ferraro
projected the right image. Bush, she
said, had a reputation of being un
emotional, but last night he came out
ready for battle with the "brassier"
Ferraro.
Fierro said that the two candidates
reversed roles: Ferraro was more
composed and more charismatic than
her opponent. "She has an air of the
Kennedys. By naming the families in
the cities, she was talking to the
viewer on a one-to-one basis," Fierro
said.
Voakes said the style of the candi
dates is perhaps even more important
than the substance of their state
ments.
"You look at a debate like this in
terms of substance and style,"
Voakes said. "Vice-presidental can
didates have to toe the party line.
There is, on the other hand, quite a
considerable difference in style. Style
is what you judge."
The journalists agreed that the can
didates made no major gaffes. But
Jacobs did say Bush's statement that
Nicaragua was worse off than El Sal
vador was "appalling and ludicrous."
He added that Ferraro should have
addressed Bush's claim.
Voakes also criticized Bush, saying
he had been unable to capitalize on
his experience in foreign policy. He
added that Ferraro was able to turn
around Bush's statement about the
president taking responsibility for
foreign affairs.
The panelists agreed that the two
debates could make the presidenta!
race a closer contest but that the
debates alone would not make the
Mondale-Ferraro ticket a winner. "I
think it will make it tighter, but he
(Mondale) will lose in the end, v
Jacobs said.
The importance of a Ferraro vic
tory might also appear in the next
debate. "A second debate victory for
Mondale and Ferraro would give
Mondale terrific momentum goinÂ£
into the second presidential debate,"
Voakes said.
