# Soviet scholar is in demand

### KATHY OLMSTED Daily staff 
Being a world-renowned expert on the Soviet Union
has its price.
For Alexander Dallin, that price includes being
awakened by CBS News at 1 a.m., just after he had fallen
asleep. It includes being asked, while in a less-than-alert
state, to make sage comments about Yuri Andropov's
death, or Leonid Brezhnev's death, or whatever major
Soviet event is currently worrying the press.
Being a Soviet expert means trying to predict Soviet ac
tions, and it means taking criticism when those predictions
are wrong.
But Dallin doesn't allow the pressures of his profession
to overwhelm him. The stocky, amiable professor of his
tory and political science smiles wryly when he talks about
the value of "expert" predictions about the Soviet Union.
"All I can say is, 'The range of the possible includes the
following,' " he says. "If what happens falls into that
range, fine. Beyond that, it's hard to predict."
The press is not the only group that regularly seeks the
60-year-old professor's advice and expertise. As he
speaks in his crowded but neat office, someone knocks at
the door. A student would like to see him. The phone
rings. Someone would like him to review a book.
Yet Dallin still has time to teach an undergraduate
lecture course and a graduate seminar this fall. He still is
able to devote so much attention to his classes that his stu
dents are nearly always enthusiastic about his teaching.
He also has the time to speak out about matters of prin
ciple. Sometimes his candor about controversial issues
causes some of his colleagues to make "responses that are
not the most friendly kind," says Political Science Prof.
Jan Triska.
But most of all, Dallin has the time to produce the type
of research that earns him the respect of his colleagues.
Triska says Dallin is "one of the leaders in the profes
sion," as well as "a man of intellectual integrity."
