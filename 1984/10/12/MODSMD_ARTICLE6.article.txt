# Soviet scholar is in demand
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Daily staff 
Being a world-renowned expert on the Soviet Union
has its price.
For Alexander Dallin, that price includes being
awakened by CBS News at 1 a.m., just after he had fallen
asleep. It includes being asked, while in a less-than-alert
state, to make sage comments about Yuri Andropov's
death, or Leonid Brezhnev's death, or whatever major
Soviet event is currently worrying the press.
Being a Soviet expert means trying to predict Soviet ac
tions, and it means taking criticism when those predictions
are wrong.
But Dallin doesn't allow the pressures of his profession
to overwhelm him. The stocky, amiable professor of his
tory and political science smiles wryly when he talks about
the value of "expert" predictions about the Soviet Union.
"All I can say is, 'The range of the possible includes the
following,' " he says. "If what happens falls into that
range, fine. Beyond that, it's hard to predict."
The press is not the only group that regularly seeks the
60-year-old professor's advice and expertise. As he
speaks in his crowded but neat office, someone knocks at
the door. A student would like to see him. The phone
rings. Someone would like him to review a book.
Yet Dallin still has time to teach an undergraduate
lecture course and a graduate seminar this fall. He still is
able to devote so much attention to his classes that his stu
dents are nearly always enthusiastic about his teaching.
He also has the time to speak out about matters of prin
ciple. Sometimes his candor about controversial issues
causes some of his colleagues to make "responses that are
not the most friendly kind," says Political Science Prof.
Jan Triska.
But most of all, Dallin has the time to produce the type
of research that earns him the respect of his colleagues.
Triska says Dallin is "one of the leaders in the profes
sion," as well as "a man of intellectual integrity."
Russian ancestry
Dallin's interest in Soviet studies stems in
part from his Russian ancestry. His parents left
the Soviet Union in 1921 and settled temporar
ily in Berlin, where Dallin was born. His father,
an economist who was active in politics and
journalism in Russia, decided it might be
"healthy" to leave his home country.
Dallin spent a few years in France before
moving to New York in time to finish high
school. His years in France, Germany and the
United States, combined with the "salami-and
underwear" Russian vocabulary he learned
from his parents, helped him to become fluent
in four languages.
During World War 11, Dallin served the
Army by interrogating prisoners of war. His
contact with one group of Soviets that had been
captured and pressed into service by the Ger
mans kindled his interest in Soviet studies.
After the war, Dallin got his master's and
doctoral degrees at Columbia, then one of the
few universities offering programs in Soviet
studies.
His dissertation topic, the German occupa
tion in the Soviet Union in World War 11, was
the basis of one of his books, "German Rule in
Russia: 1941-45."
"It's probably the most idiotic thing I've ever
done. I never should have been allowed to take
as big a topic as that for a dissertation," he
laughs now.
The 1,000-page treatise took him six years,
but the resulting book is regarded as a "seminal
work," Triska says.
"I have no reason to be ashamed of it," Dal
lin says with characteristic modesty.
Stanford 'no mistake'
Dallin originally came to Stanford on a year's
sabbatical leave from Columbia's prestigious
Russian Institute. Once here, though, he
decided to stay.
"At the end of the year, I couldn't think of
any good reason to go back," he says.
Dallin left the Russian Institute, where he
had served as director, for the less-established
program here partly because he was
"overloaded" at Columbia, he says."I kidded
myself that one could do research, teaching and
administration," he says.
Dallin returned to Columbia during 1983-84
while on leave from Stanford. He says he
enjoyed both the university and New York City.
"There's plenty in New York to enjoy," he
says. "Of course, much of it is both expensive
and fattening."
However, he says he was not tempted to
remain in New York. "On the whole it only
convinced me that I had not made a mistake in
coming out here."
Although Stanford still hasn't caught up to
Columbia in terms of numbers of scholars or
graduate students, Dallin says the joint
Stanford-Berkeley program in Soviet studies is
"very promising." ' ono tot >■'
A recent Rockefeller Foundation grant for
the study of Soviet international behavior to the

joint Stanford-Berkeley program "gave us both
an opportunity and an obligation" to integrate
the two programs, Dallin says.
In fact, the joint program "promises to
become the West Coast center in Soviet
studies," he says.
Scarcity of experts
The Rockefeller grant is an example of the
recent turnaround in funding for Soviet and
East European studies. Funds for the field are
only recently increasing after being drastically
reduced in the 1960s and 19705.
Dallin says that the improved relations be
tween the superpowers in the early 1970s may
have been part of the cause of the decrease.
"One of the things that had stimulated the
field, for better or for worse, had been kind of a
know-your-enemy attitude," he says."I think in
some ways it was unfortunate, but it made it a
lot easier to get money."
But, in the same way, the recent worsening of
U.S.-Soviet relations may have contributed to
the current increase.
"In a paradoxical way," Dallin says, "as rela
tions got worse, it became easier again to con
vince people that we needed to do something
about it."

The lack of an adequate number of Soviet
scholars has been particularly evident in the
Reagan administration, Dallin says.
"I don't think ever since 1945 have there
been so few people in Washington in any posi
tion of authority who know anything about the
Soviet Union," he says.
While academics don't necessarily make good
government officials, Dallin says, they do offer
a degree of expertise that is lacking in this ad
ministration.
Predictability at Hoover
Dallin feels that academics should be con
sulted in political affairs, but he doesn't think
that institutions associated with universities
should reflect one particular political orienta
tion. That is his objection to the Hoover Institu
tion, where he was a senior research fellow for
seven years.
While Dallin is quick to point out that he was
treated "very decently" at Hoover, he says he
does not think that an institution with a specific
political orientation has a place on a university
campus.
"The thrust of any kind of research that is
done by some people over there is terribly

predictable," he says."I can almost guess in ad
vance what the conclusions are going to be."
That's not the way that "open-minded aca
demic research" should be conducted, Oallin
says.
While not everyone associated with Hoover
has the same political orientation, he says, a
random selection of fellows would not yield so
many conservatives.
This "clustering" of scholars at one end of the
political spectrum indicates that "there are
criteria other than scholarship that enter into
their selection," Dallin says.
"And that I consider wrong," he says.
KAL research
Dallin's latest book, on the Soviet downing of
Korean Air Lines Flight 007, is due out in
February. The book, called "Black Box," offers
"no single dramatic conclusion," he says. But he
was able to eliminate many of the dozens of hy
potheses about how and why the incident oc
curred, he says, and to indicate which are the
most plausible.
Dallin says he enjoyed doing the research for
the book, which included both the documentary
research and interviews in Moscow and Wash
ington. He hopes the work will be useful both
for its substantive conclusions and for the meth
odology used in investigating the incident.
It is especially important to look at the reac
tions and conclusions both of the Soviet and of
the American governments, Dallin says.
"As far as I'm concerned," he says, "there
was a series of mistakes made on both sides."
Alliance between extremes
The general deterioration of Soviet-
American relations has also been aggravated by
mistakes by both sides, Dallin says.
"The Reagan administration paradoxically
has strengthened the hand of the hard-liners in
Moscow, and Soviet policy has made it easier
for the Reagan administration to carry the day
here," he says. As a result, there is an
"unwitting, tacit alliance between the extremes
on both sides."
But the generation of Soviet leaders that will
follow the old guard in the Kremlin will not nec
essarily be more "pliable," Dallin says.
"I think they may be more sensible," he says.
"On the other hand, they're also more aware of
Soviet strength; they take for granted Soviet
great-power status."
What fr£e time?
Dallin obviously doesn't have much time for
non-academic pursuits. But when the father of
three does get a few non-harried moments, he
likes to garden, play the piano, listen to opera
and play tennis.
He also likes to travel. After finishing a con
ference junket through Europe this summer, he
rented a place on Corfu, unloaded his
"footlocker full of papers and books" and wrote
for a month.
"One of the fortunate things in this field is
that one gets around," he says. "That I enjoy."
He always manages to find the time to take
"fairly decent" vacations. After all, he says, his
eyes twinkling at the understatement, "I think I
work fairly intensively when I'm at it here."
