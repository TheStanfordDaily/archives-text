Laxalt says briefings tired Reagan
WASHINGTON — Presidential adviser Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.)
said yesterday that President Rei gan fared poorly in his debate with
Democratic nominee Walter MonJale because he had been "brutalized
by a briefing process" that overloaded him with statistics.
Reagan, without conceding that he lost the debate, gave a more
subdued version of what had happened, saying he had«done "a lot of
homework myself, probably too much of it, without sitting back and
relaxing."
Laxalt's sharp-tongued criticism of the debate preparation brought
into the open private soul-searching in the Reagan campaign since the
Sunday debate.
The president's advisers, pressed to find an explanation for a pefor
mance they consider unusually ineffective, are trying to defend Reagan,
73, from the charge that he is showing his age while also trying to find a
way to prepare him better for his second debate with Mondale Oct. 21.
Campaigning in Ohio yesterday, Mondale intensified his call for
wayward Democrats to come home and criticized Reagan for
"impersonating" former president Harry Truman.
Laxalt, the Reagan campaign chairman and longtime friend of the
president, told a news conference that Reagan "had an off night. . . but
it wasn't because of any physical or mental deficiency. He was brutalized
by a briefing process that didn't make any sense."
Laxalt called the age issue "the colossal red herring" of the campaign.
"The man was absolutely smothered" with figures, he said, adding that
" Ronald Reagan today — physically, emotionally and in know-how — is
better than when he took office."
Later in the day, in an interview from Philadephia where he accompa
nied Vice President Bush, Laxalt said of the president's debate prepara
tion, "It filled his head with so many facts and figures that he lost his
spontaneity and his visionary concepts."
He vowed that preparations would be different for Reagan's second
debate with Mondale, scheduled for Oct. 21 in Kansas City.
Sullivan makes historic spacewalk
HOUSTON — With an enthusiastic "I love it," astronaut Kathryn
Sullivan yesterday became the first American woman to step out of a
spacecraft into the weightless void of space.
Sullivan, a 33-year-old geologist, joined astronaut David Leestma, 35,
as America's first coed spacewalkers, easing out of the shuttle Chal
lenger at 8:42 a.m. EDT as their spaceship sailed 137 miles above
Canada at a speed of 17,500 m.p.h.
The two astronauts, who both grew up in Southern California, obvi
ously enjoyed their work as they moved about the open 60-foot cargo
bay of the Challenger, to which they were connected by lifelines.
"This is really great," Sullivan said just seconds into the spacewalk,
the 39th by American astronauts'. If she was disappointed about having
been upstaged by Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya earlier this
year, it did not show.
Leestma, paraphrasing a country-Western song made famous by Gene
Autry, at one point broke out singing, "I'm back in the bag again." The
astronauts refer to their bulky $2.1 million spacesuits as bags.
The two astronauts, with Leestma leading and Sullivan playing
photographer and backup plumber, hooked up a valve and other con
nections that will permit rocket fuel to be transferred from one tank in
the shuttle to another. The experiment was designed to show it is possi
ble to refuel maneuvering rockets on satellites already in space.
Panama swears in new president
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Nicolas Ardito Barletta, a 45-year-old
economist backed by his country's military and the United States, was
inaugurated as president of Panama yesterday and pledged immediately
to respect the terms of his country's treaty on the Panama Canal.
Barletta. speaking before an audience that included Secretary of State
George Shultz and former President Carter, rebuffed a demand by out
going President Jorge Illueca that the United States give full control of
the canal to Panama in 1990, instead of 1999 as called for in the treaty.
"We will scrupulously respect our international obligations and
treaties, and we hope that the nations of the international community
will do the same for us, especially the United States with respect to the
Torrijos-Carter Treaty on the Panama Canal and its neutrality," Bar
letta said.
The treaty, signed in 1977 by Carter and the late Panamanian leader
Gen. Omar Torrijos, provides that the United States will gradually
transfer control of the canal to Panama but also gives the United States
the right to intervene to keep the waterway open to all international
shipping.
Panamanian leftists have complained that the treaty allows U.S. forces
to remain at the canal too long.
President Reagan, on the other hand, attacked the treaty when it was
signed as a "giveaway." But Shultz, on his arrival here, praised the treaty
for "showing the world that we can successfully resolve the most compli-'
cated and important of issues by means of skillful negotiation."
Shultz and other U.S. officials were clearly pleased with Barletta's as
cendancy to the presidency. The new Panamanian president was a
graduate student at the University of Chicago when Shultz was a profes
sor there.
Czech poet wins Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — Jaroslav Seifert, an 83-year-old Czechos
lovakian poet and longstanding political maverick, yesterday became his
country's first winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Seifert, a prolific lyricist whose two dozen collections are virtually un
known and rarely translated outside Eastern Europe, was cited by the
Swedish Academy of Letters for poetry "which, endowed with freshness,
sensuality and rich inventiveness, provides a liberating image of the in
domitable spirit of man."
The laureate was unable to travel to Stockholm because he is under
going hospital treatment following a heart attack earlier this month. He
was informed of the award yesterday at his bedside by the Swedish cul
tural attache in Prague, who told reporters that "at first he didn't quite
understand. But he's very old, and nothing surprises him much any
more. But he was very, very happy."
Ford presents proposal to UAW
DETROIT — With just one day left before a union-imposed settle
ment deadline, Ford Motor Co. yesterday presented what it
called a comprehensive contract proposal to the United Auto Workers.
Company officials said the offer included a wage-and-benefit package
for its 114,000 union workers similar to the one hammered out between
the union and General Motors Corp. last month.
Without providing details of Ford's latest offer, Peter Pestillo, Ford's
chief negotiator, said in a statement that it "narrows the differences be
tween the two sides." Pestillo added that the proposal "needs more
work," but he said he hopes that the company and the union can "move
from here to a final agreement."
A company spokesman said the new offer, Ford's first since last
Friday, included provisions for wage increases similar to those called for
in the GM agreement, and he added that further negotiations were likely
to make the Ford wage package almost "identical" to the GM settle
ment.
The UAW selected GM as its strike target in this year's round of labor
negotiations with the auto industry in order to hammer out a new con
tract that could be used as a pattern in its talks with Ford.
Wall Street records definite gain
NEW YORK — The stock market recorded its first clear-cut gain in a
week yesterday, helped by falling open-market interest rates.
Bank stocks ranked among the top performers in a session of
moderate activity.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.85 to 1,183.08, and
other, broader market measures showed similar strength.
Today's weather
Cloudy this morning but clearing later on in the day. The high temper
ature will be in the 60s.

it wasn't because of any physical or mental deficiency. He was brutalized
by a briefing process that didn't make any sense."
Laxalt called the age issue "the colossal red herring" of the campaign.
"The man was absolutely smothered" with figures, he said, adding that
" Ronald Reagan today — physically, emotionally and in know-how — is
better than when he took office."
Later in the day, in an interview from Philadephia where he accompa
nied Vice President Bush, Laxalt said of the president's debate prepara
tion, "It filled his head with so many facts and figures that he lost his
spontaneity and his visionary concepts."
He vowed that preparations would be different for Reagan's second
debate with Mondale, scheduled for Oct. 21 in Kansas City.
Sullivan makes historic spacewalk
HOUSTON — With an enthusiastic "I love it," astronaut Kathryn
Sullivan yesterday became the first American woman to step out of a
spacecraft into the weightless void of space.
Sullivan, a 33-year-old geologist, joined astronaut David Leestma, 35,
as America's first coed spacewalkers, easing out of the shuttle Chal
lenger at 8:42 a.m. EDT as their spaceship sailed 137 miles above
Canada at a speed of 17,500 m.p.h.
The two astronauts, who both grew up in Southern California, obvi
ously enjoyed their work as they moved about the open 60-foot cargo
bay of the Challenger, to which they were connected by lifelines.
"This is really great," Sullivan said just seconds into the spacewalk,
the 39th by American astronauts'. If she was disappointed about having
been upstaged by Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya earlier this
year, it did not show.
Leestma, paraphrasing a country-Western song made famous by Gene
Autry, at one point broke out singing, "I'm back in the bag again." The
astronauts refer to their bulky $2.1 million spacesuits as bags.
The two astronauts, with Leestma leading and Sullivan playing
photographer and backup plumber, hooked up a valve and other con
nections that will permit rocket fuel to be transferred from one tank in
the shuttle to another. The experiment was designed to show it is possi
ble to refuel maneuvering rockets on satellites already in space.
Panama swears in new president
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Nicolas Ardito Barletta, a 45-year-old
economist backed by his country's military and the United States, was
inaugurated as president of Panama yesterday and pledged immediately
to respect the terms of his country's treaty on the Panama Canal.
Barletta. speaking before an audience that included Secretary of State
George Shultz and former President Carter, rebuffed a demand by out
going President Jorge Illueca that the United States give full control of
the canal to Panama in 1990, instead of 1999 as called for in the treaty.
"We will scrupulously respect our international obligations and
treaties, and we hope that the nations of the international community
will do the same for us, especially the United States with respect to the
Torrijos-Carter Treaty on the Panama Canal and its neutrality," Bar
letta said.
The treaty, signed in 1977 by Carter and the late Panamanian leader
Gen. Omar Torrijos, provides that the United States will gradually
transfer control of the canal to Panama but also gives the United States
the right to intervene to keep the waterway open to all international
shipping.
Panamanian leftists have complained that the treaty allows U.S. forces
to remain at the canal too long.
President Reagan, on the other hand, attacked the treaty when it was
signed as a "giveaway." But Shultz, on his arrival here, praised the treaty
for "showing the world that we can successfully resolve the most compli-'
cated and important of issues by means of skillful negotiation."
Shultz and other U.S. officials were clearly pleased with Barletta's as
cendancy to the presidency. The new Panamanian president was a
graduate student at the University of Chicago when Shultz was a profes
sor there.
Czech poet wins Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — Jaroslav Seifert, an 83-year-old Czechos
lovakian poet and longstanding political maverick, yesterday became his
country's first winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Seifert, a prolific lyricist whose two dozen collections are virtually un
known and rarely translated outside Eastern Europe, was cited by the
Swedish Academy of Letters for poetry "which, endowed with freshness,
sensuality and rich inventiveness, provides a liberating image of the in
domitable spirit of man."
The laureate was unable to travel to Stockholm because he is under
going hospital treatment following a heart attack earlier this month. He
was informed of the award yesterday at his bedside by the Swedish cul
tural attache in Prague, who told reporters that "at first he didn't quite
understand. But he's very old, and nothing surprises him much any
more. But he was very, very happy."
Ford presents proposal to UAW
DETROIT — With just one day left before a union-imposed settle
ment deadline, Ford Motor Co. yesterday presented what it
called a comprehensive contract proposal to the United Auto Workers.
Company officials said the offer included a wage-and-benefit package
for its 114,000 union workers similar to the one hammered out between
the union and General Motors Corp. last month.
Without providing details of Ford's latest offer, Peter Pestillo, Ford's
chief negotiator, said in a statement that it "narrows the differences be
tween the two sides." Pestillo added that the proposal "needs more
work," but he said he hopes that the company and the union can "move
from here to a final agreement."
A company spokesman said the new offer, Ford's first since last
Friday, included provisions for wage increases similar to those called for
in the GM agreement, and he added that further negotiations were likely
to make the Ford wage package almost "identical" to the GM settle
ment.
The UAW selected GM as its strike target in this year's round of labor
negotiations with the auto industry in order to hammer out a new con
tract that could be used as a pattern in its talks with Ford.

Laxalt says briefings tired Reagan
WASHINGTON — Presidential adviser Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.)
said yesterday that President Rei gan fared poorly in his debate with
Democratic nominee Walter MonJale because he had been "brutalized
by a briefing process" that overloaded him with statistics.
Reagan, without conceding that he lost the debate, gave a more
subdued version of what had happened, saying he had«done "a lot of
homework myself, probably too much of it, without sitting back and
relaxing."
Laxalt's sharp-tongued criticism of the debate preparation brought
into the open private soul-searching in the Reagan campaign since the
Sunday debate.
The president's advisers, pressed to find an explanation for a pefor
mance they consider unusually ineffective, are trying to defend Reagan,
73, from the charge that he is showing his age while also trying to find a
way to prepare him better for his second debate with Mondale Oct. 21.
Campaigning in Ohio yesterday, Mondale intensified his call for
wayward Democrats to come home and criticized Reagan for
"impersonating" former president Harry Truman.
Laxalt, the Reagan campaign chairman and longtime friend of the
president, told a news conference that Reagan "had an off night. . . but
it wasn't because of any physical or mental deficiency. He was brutalized
by a briefing process that didn't make any sense."
