### 
BRIGHTON, England â€” A ter
rorist bomb blasted a gaping hole
early today in the hotel where Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher was
staying. Thatcher was unhurt, but the
blast killed at least two persons and
injured 25, including a Cabinet mem
ber.
Thatcher, at the seafront Grand
Hotel along with most of her 22-
member cabinet for the Conservative
Party's annual conference, said the
explosion blew out the windows of
her second-floor room. She was taken
to a police station in this English
Channel resort rind told reporters:
"I'm very well, thank you."
She said she was still awake when
the blast occurred at 3:10 a.m.,
working on a speech she planned to

deliver to the conference today. Her
husband Denis was in bed. "All the
windows went, and the bathroom was
extremely badly damaged. We were
very lucky," Thatcher said.
Thatcher's office said in London
that she intended to stay in
Brighton and deliver her speech.
Home Secretary Leon Brittan told
a news conference that police officials
had determined the explosion was
caused by a bomb containing 15-20
pounds of explosives. There was no
immediate claim of responsibility.
"We don't know for sure, but it

would appear that the bomb may
have been in the foyer' of the hotel,
Brittan said. "It is clear that the inci
dent was caused by an explosive
device from inside the hotel."
Emma Nicholson, a vice chairman
of the Conservative Party who tied
from the hotel in her dressing gown,
said: "There was an enormous explo
sion, then the smell of acrid smoke. It
was horrid."
The explosion severely damaged
the top three floors of the eight-story
hotel.
Almost four hours after the blast.

Trade Secretary Norman Tebbit, 53,
was dug out of the rubble and was ad
mitted to Royal Sussex County
Hospital. .
Deputy District Administrator
Simon Strachan said Tebbit had a
broken leg and other leg injuries but
was able to move all his limbs. Strac
han said 24 others were being treated
in the hospital.
The closing session of the four-day
Conservative conference was due to
open today with a debate on a resolu
tion praising police and the British
army in strife-torn Northern Ireland.
Suspicion for the bomb fell on guer
rillas of the mainly Roman Catholic
Irish Republican Army fighting t 0
drive the British from Northern
Ireland.
