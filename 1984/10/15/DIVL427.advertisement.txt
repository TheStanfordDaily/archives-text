HIGH TECHNOLOGY. . .
Retailing is a business like no other. It is an entrepreneurial
approach to business involving computerized resources, fore
casting trends, setting strategy, and maximizing opportunity. It
involves risk-taking, innovation, and decisiveness. The envi

We've come to the conclusion that Stanford produces the qual
ity individual capable for success in our industry — easily
adaptable, competitive,-and assertive.
That confidence we place in Stanford graduates is reflected in
a competitive starting salary and a merit system that insures
people are rewarded for strong performances.
We would like you to meet some of our executives at an infor
mal presentation open to all students Thursday, October 30, at
4:00 pm in Tresidder Student Union, Room 132.
We invite you to participate in our campus interviewing
scheduled October 31. Please contact the CPPC for further
details.
