IRA claims responsibility
BRIGHTON, England — The Irish Republican Army's
Provisional Wing claimed responsibility Friday for the
bomb blast that killed four persons and injured 32 others
at a Brighton hotel housing key members of the British
government.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was in
Brighton for a meeting of the Conservative Party
Congress, was unhurt in the blast.
The statement was issued through the IRA publicity
bureau in Dublin, and was signed, "P. O'Neill."
Thatcher, calling the blast an "inhuman act," said
that the Conservative Party would not be intimidated by
such attacks.
The bomb was apparently planted to coincide with the
Conservative Party's debate on Northern Ireland.
Home Secretary Leon Brittan told a press conference
that a second bomb was discovered and detonated in a
controlled explosion near the Grand Hotel, the target of
the first blast.
Norman Tebbit, the British trade and industry minister,
is improving in the hospital after sustaining chest and leg
injuries that required surgery.
Tebbit, who was buried for four hours under rubble,
and his wife were sleeping at the time of the blast. Fire of
ficials said Tebbit plunged three or four stories and was
trapped under the rubble. They said it was almost a
miracle that he was still alive.
John Wakeman, the government chief whip in the
House of Commons, is in serious condition after being
pinned for six hours in the rubble. Wakeman's wife,
Rebecca, who was also a member of Commons, died in
the blast.
Also killed were Sir Anthony Berry, a member of Parli
ament and a former Conservative whip, and Eric Taylor,
chairman of the party's northwest England chapter. A
search of the rubble was continuing for the fourth victim,
who has not yet been identified.
The bomb is believed to have been planted several
weeks ago with a sophisticated long-term timing device, a
Scotland Yard expert said Saturday.
"The IRA now has the ability to put down time bombs
on a far longer delay than we have experienced hitherto,"
the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, Cmdr.
William Hucklesby, said. Political observers believe the
development adds a new, terrifying and almost uncon
trollable element to security problems everywhere.
"They (the IRA) can put down a bomb, for example,
three weeks, two days, three hours, 30 seconds in ad
vance," Hucklesby said. "This could well have been put
there while the hotel was open for normal business."
Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist chief said that the bomb
may have been assembled using a new type of explosive
that police dogs used for bomb detection have not yet

been trained to sniff. It may also have been wrapped
tightly in cellophane or some other material to deceive
police dogs.
Congress adjourns
WASHINGTON — Congress finally staggered across
the finish line Friday, adjourning after an election-year
ploy by Senate Democrats forced grudging Republicans to
vote for a record increase in the government's borrowing
authority.
The Senate's 37-30 approval of a bill to raise the debt
ceiling by $248 billion (to $1.82 trillion) came only after
Majority Leader Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) reeled in
15 absent Republicans to supply the decisive votes. Three
of the absentees — Sens. John Tower of Texas, Jeremiah
Denton of Alabama and Thad Cochran of Mississippi —
were fetched from their home states by Air Force jets at a
cost to taxpayers of $4,100.
But the delay in congressional action on the debt ceiling
could have far more serious financial consequences. The
Department of the Treasury has been forced to postpone
the sale of more than $9 billion in securities in recent
days, and that means that financial markets will face a
congested calendar involving the sale of $42 billion worth
of government securities in the coming month.
Skeptical buyers typically demand higher interest rates
when the government floods the market with its securities,
and a boost of just 0.1 percent in the interest rates at
tached to the $42 billion sale would add $400 million to
federal outlays.
The Senate approval of the debt ceiling bill, rejected
hours earlier by a vote of 46-14, cleared the way for the
98th Congress to adjourn seven tumultuous days later
than scheduled. The new 99th Congress will convene Jan.

Shuttle lands in Florida
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Carrying the largest
crew in space flight history, the shuttle Challenger Satur
day returned to the Kennedy Space Center where the five
men and two women were launched into earth orbit 10
days ago.
The 100-ton Challenger glided out of clear Florida
skies and touched down on runway 33 at 12:27 p.m. EDT
after crossing over the heartland of North America from
Alaska, western and central Canada down to Cape
Canaveral.
The landing here of the 13th space shuttle flight means
that the government can move ahead with a stepped-up
schedule of shuttle flights.
It was the second time in four attempts that a shuttle
crew landed in Florida instead of at California's Edwards

Bush boast is overheard
ELIZABETH, N.J. — Vice President George Bush,
ebullient over his performance in Thursday night's vice
presidential debate, boasted here Friday that "we tried to
kick a little ass last night" in his face-off with Democratic
vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro.
Bush appeared to be unaware that he was within ear
shot of reporters as he made the remark to an official of
the International Longshoremen's Association while
working a raucous crowd of dockworkers at a GOP rally
here. "Whoops, oh God, he heard me," Bush exclaimed
when he spotted a television crewman holding a boom
microphone. "Turn that thing off."
Minutes earlier, Bush had praised Ferraro to reporters
as "gracious" and declined to declare himself the winner.
The remarks were recorded by New York station
WNEW-TV, which made them available to other
reporters.
Bush defended his remark later at a news conference in
Birmingham, Ala., saying it is a common way of express
ing victory among athletes. Asked if it would hurt his cam
paign, he predicted that it would help, adding that he did
not intend to apologize to Ferraro.
"I stand behind it, I use it all the time," Bush said of his
remark. "My kids use it, everybody who competes in
sports uses it." He said Ferraro would understand because
"she's a good competitor."
It was the third time this week that Bush or members of
his entourage have uttered controversial remarks aimed at
Ferraro. Bush's wife, Barbara, called the House member
from Queens "that $4 million — I can't say it but it
rhymes with rich"; and his press secretary, Peter Teeley,
on Thursday called her "too bitchy" for voters' tastes.
Reagan takes to the rails
OTTAWA, Ohio — President Reagan cast himself as a
latter-day Harry Truman Friday in a whistle-stop cam
paign swing across Ohio, borrowing Truman's old U.S.
Car One and evoking his combative rhetoric — but direct
ing it at today's Democrats.
"You know, Harry Truman rode this state in his
whistle-stop tour of 1948, and he spoke some very blunt
truths," Reagan told a sprawling crowd by the rail tracks
in Sidney. "And that's what I'm going to do."
■ Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale has
accused Reagan of "grave-robbing" Democratic heroes,
and Reagan taunted his rival Friday by summoning up
memories of Truman and Franklin Roosevelt to reinforce

his own appeal to Democratic voters.
Roosevelt "told us the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself," Reagan said. "The only thing my opponent has to
offer is fear itself."
Mondale's "philosophy can be summed up in four sen
tences," Reagan declared. "If it's income, tax it. If it's rev
enue, spend it. If it's a budget, break it. And if it's a prom
ise, make it."
On Saturday, during his weekly paid political broadcast
from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., Presi
dent Reagan gibed that Walter Mondale was peddling a
"gloomy vision of weakness" while his own "vision of
strong economic growth . . . can continue to get better . . .
offering new hope for everyone."
"Asking you to buy his failed policies is a little like
someone expecting you to go to a used car lot to buy back
the lemon you got rid of four years ago," Reagan said.
Soviet missiles deployed
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union announced Saturday
night that it has begun deploying long-range cruise
missiles aboard Soviet strategic aircraft and on Soviet sub
marines.
A statement issued by the Ministry of Defense said
these deployments were designed to offset a "massive
deployment" by the United States of air-, sea- and land
based cruise missiles, including those stationed in several
West European countries.
Implicit in the Soviet statement was that newly
developed long-range cruise missiles — unpiloted drones
capable of carrying nuclear warheads to distant targets at
very low altitudes — were targeted at the United States.
In August, Moscow announced successful tests of land
based, long-range cruise missiles. That statement was seen
primarily as having propaganda impact, since land-based
drones have a range of between 1,000 to 1,500 miles and
could not reach U.S. territory.
In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said,
"The Soviet Unioft has long deployed cruise missiles,"
and added that Washington "has proposed a global ban
on all ground-launched cruise missiles."
"If the Soviets are seriously interested in limiting cruise
missiles they should be willing to resume the negotiations
to reduce offensive nuclear weapons," she said.
The new deployments are believed to involve a new and
more sophisticated generation of Soviet cruise missiles
tested successfully in late 1982 with guidance systems
similar to those developed by the United States several
years ago.

Congress adjourns
WASHINGTON — Congress finally staggered across
the finish line Friday, adjourning after an election-year
ploy by Senate Democrats forced grudging Republicans to
vote for a record increase in the government's borrowing
authority.
The Senate's 37-30 approval of a bill to raise the debt
ceiling by $248 billion (to $1.82 trillion) came only after
Majority Leader Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) reeled in
15 absent Republicans to supply the decisive votes. Three
of the absentees — Sens. John Tower of Texas, Jeremiah
Denton of Alabama and Thad Cochran of Mississippi —
were fetched from their home states by Air Force jets at a
cost to taxpayers of $4,100.
But the delay in congressional action on the debt ceiling
could have far more serious financial consequences. The
Department of the Treasury has been forced to postpone
the sale of more than $9 billion in securities in recent
days, and that means that financial markets will face a
congested calendar involving the sale of $42 billion worth
of government securities in the coming month.
Skeptical buyers typically demand higher interest rates
when the government floods the market with its securities,
and a boost of just 0.1 percent in the interest rates at
tached to the $42 billion sale would add $400 million to
federal outlays.
The Senate approval of the debt ceiling bill, rejected
hours earlier by a vote of 46-14, cleared the way for the
98th Congress to adjourn seven tumultuous days later
than scheduled. The new 99th Congress will convene Jan.

Shuttle lands in Florida
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Carrying the largest
crew in space flight history, the shuttle Challenger Satur
day returned to the Kennedy Space Center where the five
men and two women were launched into earth orbit 10
days ago.
The 100-ton Challenger glided out of clear Florida
skies and touched down on runway 33 at 12:27 p.m. EDT
after crossing over the heartland of North America from
Alaska, western and central Canada down to Cape
Canaveral.
The landing here of the 13th space shuttle flight means
that the government can move ahead with a stepped-up
schedule of shuttle flights.
It was the second time in four attempts that a shuttle
crew landed in Florida instead of at California's Edwards

Bush boast is overheard
ELIZABETH, N.J. — Vice President George Bush,
ebullient over his performance in Thursday night's vice
presidential debate, boasted here Friday that "we tried to
kick a little ass last night" in his face-off with Democratic
vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro.
Bush appeared to be unaware that he was within ear
shot of reporters as he made the remark to an official of
the International Longshoremen's Association while
working a raucous crowd of dockworkers at a GOP rally
here. "Whoops, oh God, he heard me," Bush exclaimed
when he spotted a television crewman holding a boom
microphone. "Turn that thing off."
Minutes earlier, Bush had praised Ferraro to reporters
as "gracious" and declined to declare himself the winner.
The remarks were recorded by New York station
WNEW-TV, which made them available to other
reporters.
Bush defended his remark later at a news conference in
Birmingham, Ala., saying it is a common way of express
ing victory among athletes. Asked if it would hurt his cam
paign, he predicted that it would help, adding that he did
not intend to apologize to Ferraro.
"I stand behind it, I use it all the time," Bush said of his
remark. "My kids use it, everybody who competes in
sports uses it." He said Ferraro would understand because
"she's a good competitor."
It was the third time this week that Bush or members of
his entourage have uttered controversial remarks aimed at
Ferraro. Bush's wife, Barbara, called the House member
from Queens "that $4 million — I can't say it but it
rhymes with rich"; and his press secretary, Peter Teeley,
on Thursday called her "too bitchy" for voters' tastes.
Reagan takes to the rails
OTTAWA, Ohio — President Reagan cast himself as a
latter-day Harry Truman Friday in a whistle-stop cam
paign swing across Ohio, borrowing Truman's old U.S.
Car One and evoking his combative rhetoric — but direct
ing it at today's Democrats.
"You know, Harry Truman rode this state in his
whistle-stop tour of 1948, and he spoke some very blunt
truths," Reagan told a sprawling crowd by the rail tracks
in Sidney. "And that's what I'm going to do."
■ Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale has
accused Reagan of "grave-robbing" Democratic heroes,
and Reagan taunted his rival Friday by summoning up
memories of Truman and Franklin Roosevelt to reinforce

his own appeal to Democratic voters.
Roosevelt "told us the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself," Reagan said. "The only thing my opponent has to
offer is fear itself."
Mondale's "philosophy can be summed up in four sen
tences," Reagan declared. "If it's income, tax it. If it's rev
enue, spend it. If it's a budget, break it. And if it's a prom
ise, make it."
On Saturday, during his weekly paid political broadcast
from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., Presi
dent Reagan gibed that Walter Mondale was peddling a
"gloomy vision of weakness" while his own "vision of
strong economic growth . . . can continue to get better . . .
offering new hope for everyone."
"Asking you to buy his failed policies is a little like
someone expecting you to go to a used car lot to buy back
the lemon you got rid of four years ago," Reagan said.
Soviet missiles deployed
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union announced Saturday
night that it has begun deploying long-range cruise
missiles aboard Soviet strategic aircraft and on Soviet sub
marines.
A statement issued by the Ministry of Defense said
these deployments were designed to offset a "massive
deployment" by the United States of air-, sea- and land
based cruise missiles, including those stationed in several
West European countries.
Implicit in the Soviet statement was that newly
developed long-range cruise missiles — unpiloted drones
capable of carrying nuclear warheads to distant targets at
very low altitudes — were targeted at the United States.
In August, Moscow announced successful tests of land
based, long-range cruise missiles. That statement was seen
primarily as having propaganda impact, since land-based
drones have a range of between 1,000 to 1,500 miles and
could not reach U.S. territory.
In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said,
"The Soviet Unioft has long deployed cruise missiles,"
and added that Washington "has proposed a global ban
on all ground-launched cruise missiles."
"If the Soviets are seriously interested in limiting cruise
missiles they should be willing to resume the negotiations
to reduce offensive nuclear weapons," she said.
The new deployments are believed to involve a new and
more sophisticated generation of Soviet cruise missiles
tested successfully in late 1982 with guidance systems
similar to those developed by the United States several
years ago.


IRA claims responsibility
BRIGHTON, England — The Irish Republican Army's
Provisional Wing claimed responsibility Friday for the
bomb blast that killed four persons and injured 32 others
at a Brighton hotel housing key members of the British
government.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was in
Brighton for a meeting of the Conservative Party
Congress, was unhurt in the blast.
The statement was issued through the IRA publicity
bureau in Dublin, and was signed, "P. O'Neill."
Thatcher, calling the blast an "inhuman act," said
that the Conservative Party would not be intimidated by
such attacks.
The bomb was apparently planted to coincide with the
Conservative Party's debate on Northern Ireland.
Home Secretary Leon Brittan told a press conference
that a second bomb was discovered and detonated in a
controlled explosion near the Grand Hotel, the target of
the first blast.
Norman Tebbit, the British trade and industry minister,
is improving in the hospital after sustaining chest and leg
injuries that required surgery.
Tebbit, who was buried for four hours under rubble,
and his wife were sleeping at the time of the blast. Fire of
ficials said Tebbit plunged three or four stories and was
trapped under the rubble. They said it was almost a
miracle that he was still alive.
John Wakeman, the government chief whip in the
House of Commons, is in serious condition after being
pinned for six hours in the rubble. Wakeman's wife,
Rebecca, who was also a member of Commons, died in
the blast.
Also killed were Sir Anthony Berry, a member of Parli
ament and a former Conservative whip, and Eric Taylor,
chairman of the party's northwest England chapter. A
search of the rubble was continuing for the fourth victim,
who has not yet been identified.
The bomb is believed to have been planted several
weeks ago with a sophisticated long-term timing device, a
Scotland Yard expert said Saturday.
"The IRA now has the ability to put down time bombs
on a far longer delay than we have experienced hitherto,"
the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, Cmdr.
William Hucklesby, said. Political observers believe the
development adds a new, terrifying and almost uncon
trollable element to security problems everywhere.
"They (the IRA) can put down a bomb, for example,
three weeks, two days, three hours, 30 seconds in ad
vance," Hucklesby said. "This could well have been put
there while the hotel was open for normal business."
Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist chief said that the bomb
may have been assembled using a new type of explosive
that police dogs used for bomb detection have not yet

been trained to sniff. It may also have been wrapped
tightly in cellophane or some other material to deceive

Bush boast is overheard
ELIZABETH, N.J. — Vice President George Bush,
ebullient over his performance in Thursday night's vice
presidential debate, boasted here Friday that "we tried to
kick a little ass last night" in his face-off with Democratic
vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro.
Bush appeared to be unaware that he was within ear
shot of reporters as he made the remark to an official of
the International Longshoremen's Association while
working a raucous crowd of dockworkers at a GOP rally
here. "Whoops, oh God, he heard me," Bush exclaimed
when he spotted a television crewman holding a boom
microphone. "Turn that thing off."
Minutes earlier, Bush had praised Ferraro to reporters
as "gracious" and declined to declare himself the winner.
The remarks were recorded by New York station
WNEW-TV, which made them available to other
reporters.
Bush defended his remark later at a news conference in
Birmingham, Ala., saying it is a common way of express
ing victory among athletes. Asked if it would hurt his cam
paign, he predicted that it would help, adding that he did
not intend to apologize to Ferraro.
"I stand behind it, I use it all the time," Bush said of his
remark. "My kids use it, everybody who competes in
sports uses it." He said Ferraro would understand because
"she's a good competitor."
It was the third time this week that Bush or members of
his entourage have uttered controversial remarks aimed at
Ferraro. Bush's wife, Barbara, called the House member
from Queens "that $4 million — I can't say it but it
rhymes with rich"; and his press secretary, Peter Teeley,
on Thursday called her "too bitchy" for voters' tastes.
Reagan takes to the rails
OTTAWA, Ohio — President Reagan cast himself as a
latter-day Harry Truman Friday in a whistle-stop cam
paign swing across Ohio, borrowing Truman's old U.S.
Car One and evoking his combative rhetoric — but direct
ing it at today's Democrats.
"You know, Harry Truman rode this state in his
whistle-stop tour of 1948, and he spoke some very blunt
truths," Reagan told a sprawling crowd by the rail tracks
in Sidney. "And that's what I'm going to do."
■ Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale has
accused Reagan of "grave-robbing" Democratic heroes,
and Reagan taunted his rival Friday by summoning up
memories of Truman and Franklin Roosevelt to reinforce

his own appeal to Democratic voters.
Roosevelt "told us the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself," Reagan said. "The only thing my opponent has to
offer is fear itself."
Mondale's "philosophy can be summed up in four sen
tences," Reagan declared. "If it's income, tax it. If it's rev
enue, spend it. If it's a budget, break it. And if it's a prom
ise, make it."
On Saturday, during his weekly paid political broadcast
from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., Presi
dent Reagan gibed that Walter Mondale was peddling a
"gloomy vision of weakness" while his own "vision of
strong economic growth . . . can continue to get better . . .
offering new hope for everyone."
"Asking you to buy his failed policies is a little like
someone expecting you to go to a used car lot to buy back
the lemon you got rid of four years ago," Reagan said.
Soviet missiles deployed
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union announced Saturday
night that it has begun deploying long-range cruise
missiles aboard Soviet strategic aircraft and on Soviet sub
marines.
A statement issued by the Ministry of Defense said
these deployments were designed to offset a "massive
deployment" by the United States of air-, sea- and land
based cruise missiles, including those stationed in several
West European countries.
Implicit in the Soviet statement was that newly
developed long-range cruise missiles — unpiloted drones
capable of carrying nuclear warheads to distant targets at
very low altitudes — were targeted at the United States.
In August, Moscow announced successful tests of land
based, long-range cruise missiles. That statement was seen
primarily as having propaganda impact, since land-based
drones have a range of between 1,000 to 1,500 miles and
could not reach U.S. territory.
In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said,
"The Soviet Unioft has long deployed cruise missiles,"
and added that Washington "has proposed a global ban
on all ground-launched cruise missiles."
"If the Soviets are seriously interested in limiting cruise
missiles they should be willing to resume the negotiations
to reduce offensive nuclear weapons," she said.
The new deployments are believed to involve a new and
more sophisticated generation of Soviet cruise missiles
tested successfully in late 1982 with guidance systems
similar to those developed by the United States several
years ago.


IRA claims responsibility
BRIGHTON, England — The Irish Republican Army's
Provisional Wing claimed responsibility Friday for the
bomb blast that killed four persons and injured 32 others
at a Brighton hotel housing key members of the British
government.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was in
Brighton for a meeting of the Conservative Party
Congress, was unhurt in the blast.
The statement was issued through the IRA publicity
bureau in Dublin, and was signed, "P. O'Neill."
Thatcher, calling the blast an "inhuman act," said
that the Conservative Party would not be intimidated by
such attacks.
The bomb was apparently planted to coincide with the
Conservative Party's debate on Northern Ireland.
Home Secretary Leon Brittan told a press conference
that a second bomb was discovered and detonated in a
controlled explosion near the Grand Hotel, the target of
the first blast.
Norman Tebbit, the British trade and industry minister,
is improving in the hospital after sustaining chest and leg
injuries that required surgery.
Tebbit, who was buried for four hours under rubble,
and his wife were sleeping at the time of the blast. Fire of
ficials said Tebbit plunged three or four stories and was
trapped under the rubble. They said it was almost a
miracle that he was still alive.
John Wakeman, the government chief whip in the
House of Commons, is in serious condition after being
pinned for six hours in the rubble. Wakeman's wife,
Rebecca, who was also a member of Commons, died in
the blast.
Also killed were Sir Anthony Berry, a member of Parli
ament and a former Conservative whip, and Eric Taylor,
chairman of the party's northwest England chapter. A
search of the rubble was continuing for the fourth victim,
who has not yet been identified.
The bomb is believed to have been planted several
weeks ago with a sophisticated long-term timing device, a
Scotland Yard expert said Saturday.
"The IRA now has the ability to put down time bombs
on a far longer delay than we have experienced hitherto,"
the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, Cmdr.
William Hucklesby, said. Political observers believe the
development adds a new, terrifying and almost uncon
trollable element to security problems everywhere.
"They (the IRA) can put down a bomb, for example,
three weeks, two days, three hours, 30 seconds in ad
vance," Hucklesby said. "This could well have been put
there while the hotel was open for normal business."
Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist chief said that the bomb
may have been assembled using a new type of explosive
that police dogs used for bomb detection have not yet

been trained to sniff. It may also have been wrapped
tightly in cellophane or some other material to deceive
police dogs.
Congress adjourns
WASHINGTON — Congress finally staggered across
the finish line Friday, adjourning after an election-year
ploy by Senate Democrats forced grudging Republicans to
vote for a record increase in the government's borrowing
authority.
The Senate's 37-30 approval of a bill to raise the debt
ceiling by $248 billion (to $1.82 trillion) came only after
Majority Leader Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) reeled in
15 absent Republicans to supply the decisive votes. Three
of the absentees — Sens. John Tower of Texas, Jeremiah
Denton of Alabama and Thad Cochran of Mississippi —
were fetched from their home states by Air Force jets at a
cost to taxpayers of $4,100.
But the delay in congressional action on the debt ceiling
could have far more serious financial consequences. The
Department of the Treasury has been forced to postpone
the sale of more than $9 billion in securities in recent
days, and that means that financial markets will face a
congested calendar involving the sale of $42 billion worth
of government securities in the coming month.
Skeptical buyers typically demand higher interest rates
when the government floods the market with its securities,
and a boost of just 0.1 percent in the interest rates at
tached to the $42 billion sale would add $400 million to
federal outlays.
The Senate approval of the debt ceiling bill, rejected
hours earlier by a vote of 46-14, cleared the way for the
98th Congress to adjourn seven tumultuous days later
than scheduled. The new 99th Congress will convene Jan.
3.
Shuttle lands in Florida
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Carrying the largest
crew in space flight history, the shuttle Challenger Satur
day returned to the Kennedy Space Center where the five
men and two women were launched into earth orbit 10
days ago.
The 100-ton Challenger glided out of clear Florida
skies and touched down on runway 33 at 12:27 p.m. EDT
after crossing over the heartland of North America from
Alaska, western and central Canada down to Cape
Canaveral.
The landing here of the 13th space shuttle flight means
that the government can move ahead with a stepped-up
schedule of shuttle flights.
It was the second time in four attempts that a shuttle
crew landed in Florida instead of at California's Edwards
