Ronald Reagan, Konstantin Chernenko, Fidel
Castro and Daniel Ortega ought to take a lesson
from Jose Napoleon Duarte. These men figure
prominently in Central America's political tur
moil â€” sporadic eruptions of war which El Sal
vador's President Duarte took a bold step toward
ending last week.
By proposing negotiations with his country's
Marxist guerrillas in rebel-held territory, Duarte
once again earns the title of "Champion of the
Poor." For it is the poor campesinos who bear the
bloody burden of the region's strife.
But Duarte's courage will be fruitless unless
the United States, Cuba and the Soviet Union put
pressure on the opposing factions under their in
fluence to cooperate in the peace process and
abide by its results. For its part, the United States
must make it clear that it will not tolerate any un
dermining of Duarte's efforts by either the mili
tary or right-wing paramilitary groups. The Se
cret Anticommunist Army has already
threatened reprisals against Duarte. The Soviet
Union must cease arms shipments to the rebels
through Nicaragua, and Cuba should halt its
training of the guerrillas.
Duarte's initiative also provides a ray of hope
for Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega and the other
members of the Sandinista junta should begin
similar negotiations with the contras. To dismiss
these rebels as "CIA-backed Somocistas" is an
oversimplification. Somocistas there are, to be
sure, especially among the ranks of the
Honduran-based Nicaraguan Democratic Force
(FDN). But the two top leaders of the FDN have
certified anti-Somoza credentials, and the bulk of

the guerrillas were never in the former dictator's
national guard.
The Costa Rica-based Democratic Revolution
ary Alliance is led by disillusioned ex-
Sandinistas, including Eden Pastora, the military
hero of the revolution who as "Comandante
Zero" led the assault on Somoza's national
palace in 1979. In the northeast, the MISURA
Coalition comprises Miskito, Sumos and Ramas
Indians, many of whom were brutally evicted
from their homelands by the Sandinistas.
But we cannot expect Ortega and the Sandi
nista government to reach put to the rebels as
long as the United States maintains its bellicose
posture toward Nicaragua. While Ortega's
prediction that the U.S. would invade his country
today has proven false, the Sandinistas rightly
fear escalating military aid to the contras. The
Reagan administration's Big Pine operations with
the Honduran military were clearly a rehearsal of
an invasion of Nicaragua.
Nicaragua has given its verbal assent to the
conditions of the Contadora treaty. The United
States should stop balking and indicate its inten
tion to support the accords. Congress adjourned
last week without approving further aid to the
financially-strapped contras. This provides some
breathing room for Ortega to take the kind of
peace initiative taken by Duarte in El Salvador.
If he does so, and if Nicaragua holds fair elec
tions next month and agrees to halt arms ship
ments to El Salvador, then Congress in its next
session should take final action to end support for
the contras. And the Reagan administration
should sit down in negotiations with the Sandinis
tas.
