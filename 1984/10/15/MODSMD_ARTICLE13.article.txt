## Prop. 39: partisan squabble 
### 
Proposition 39 on the November ballot could be the
most important issue to face Californians for years.
Having just graduated from college myself, 1 am con
cerned that students may write off Proposition 39 as mere
political squabbling. Most of the clamor on both sides will
be heavily financed by politicians and special interests, all
seeking to advance their own short-term political goals.

VIEWPOINT

Californian voters will need to be conscious of the inter
ests involved in this highly visible, highly partisan fight for
control of the state legislature and the state's congres
sional delegation.
But there is much more at stake with Proposition 39
than just which party will gain seats and which will lose.
Students and other young people, who will have to live
with the long-term effects of Proposition 39, need to look
beyond the shortsighted political gains and losses to the
permanent, structural changes that the measure will make
in the reapportionment process and in the state's
judiciary.
The big claim of the proponents of Proposition 39 is
that it will take the politics out of reapportionment. That
is absurd. Reapportionment is politics, no matter who
does it. A commission of retired judges, such as that set up
by Proposition 39, would be subject to all the same pres
sures as the legislature is now. It is nice to think that after
serving as impartial jurists these retired judges will behave
perfectly impartially as redistricting commissioners, but in
reality we need to recognize that they are people, too.
They have their own political views, leanings and al
legiances.
If we pretend that we have removed the politics from
the reapportionment process, we fall into the seductive
trap of Proposition 39. Far from removing the politics,
Proposition 39 would hide them behind closed doors.
Whereas the present legislative redistricting process al
lows for public input, referenda on the reapportionment
plans and voting against legislators who act against their
constituents' wishes, all these avenues are closed by
Proposition 39.
There is no doubt that politicians and special interests
will still have their input into the process. Whether others
will have their say is questionable. The pool from which

commissioners will be drawn contains no women, almost
no minorities and no one under the age of 58. In fact, the
average age is 74!
In order to guarantee the fairness of the reapportion
ment process, it is imperative that the public be able to ex
press its views and have them reflected in the reapportion
ment plan.
Even more important than the distortion of the reap
portionment process, though, is one of the side effects of
Proposition 39. In a futile attempt to flush politics out of
redistricting, Proposition 39 will inject politics into the
state judiciary.
It is widely believed that because appellate court judges
are appointed by the governor, they must all be the gover
nor's political cronies. An examination of recent history
proves that such is not the case. All recent California
governors, including George Deukmejian, Ronald
Reagan and both of the Browns appointed members of
the opposing party to the appellate court because they
were qualified.
Qualification should be the consideration for judicial
appointments, not party loyalty. Should Proposition 39
pass, however, California governors will have to make
their judicial choices with the knowledge that these judges
will become part of the process that partitions political
party power.
California's appellate courts have always been among
the best and fairest in the nation, largely because they are
non-partisan. Is it really worth tainting the entire Califor
nia judicial system in an attempt to "remove" politics
from reapportionment?
The current reapportionment process may not seem
ideal, but it works. Passage of Proposition 39 would re
quire another reapportionment in 1986, meaning the
fourth set of different districts used in this decade.
Proposition 39 is a short-sighted, partisan, political
ploy. Its legacy, regardless of short-term winners and
losers, will be backroom reapportionment and a
politicized judiciary. A "No" vote on Proposition 39 on
Nov. 6 will preserve a political process that protects the
rights of everyone, and will keep the justice in our
judiciary.
