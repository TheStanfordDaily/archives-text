## Election year considerations 
### 
"I can't stand either candidate — with such a
poor choice, why should I vote at all?" This is the
political opinion I've heard most frequently on
campus as the presidential election approaches. It
is a dangerous view, one that leads to voter apathy,
which in turn threatens to break down the demo
cratic system. Don't let it happen! If you think you
have no choice, you're wrong — just check the list
below. Why not try:
1) voting Communist? Here's one that probably
doesn't come to mind right away, but is certainly a
possibility. If you are bored with the Democrats
and the Republicans, and you're tired of getting up
to change the television channel when they come
on, then this could be a nice break. How about the
American communists' intention to abolish the
U.S. government in its present form as a refreshing
change from the old, familiar planks of the two
major parties? A more novel plan for cutting the
deficit would be hard to find. Besides, as a Stanford
student, one has another reason to vote commu
nist: appeasing the conscience. I know I've felt
guilty now and again for having it so good. If you
cast your vote for these folks, you can be proud that
you've done your part in combating that embar
rassing Stanford elitism! Don't be shy: Get out
your favorite red shirt, put on your best Josef Stalin
stone face and head for the polls. Gus Hall and An
gela Davis need you!
2) voting Libertarian? On the flip side of the
obscure parties coin, we have Ed Clark and friends.
Basically, they're as laissez-faire as can be. If you
want a government that just "provides national se
curity and delivers the mail," flick the Libertarian
switch. Feel the surge of adrenalin as the entrepre
neur within you rises to the surface and takes com
mand. A vote here may be just what you need to
show your friends and family what an independent
person you are. And you'll give that formidable im

pression of being well-informed. No one wants to
admit it, but who's heard of the Libertarians?
3) letting fate decide? A little voice inside of you
keeps saying that "fate," that mysterious guiding
force, has already settled the outcome of the elec
tion, although somehow it hasn't gotten around to
dropping you a card to name the lucky candidate.
Well, instead of surrendering to the feelings of in
significance that are sure to set in, why not make
"fate" reveal its choice to you before you vote?

Flipping a coin inside the voting both or covering
your eyes and flicking a lever at random are possi
bilities, albeit chancy ones. Or, pick a given day to
look in the newspaper and see which candidate
made the least number of stupid claims and accusa
tions — then vote for him. You might even want to
invite President Reagan and challenger Mondale to
a dorm party to have them thumb-wrestle for your
vote. Whatever method you use, you can be sure
that "fate" will show its true leaning, enabling you

to cast your vote with confidence.
4) selling your vote? This alternative is really an
indirect vote for simple capitalism. Call the local
party representatives for both parties, and ask them
what their best offer is for your support in Novem
ber. Hint that you know other students who might
also sell their votes and that you might be willing to
work out a package deal. The party with the most
money will undoubtedly win the bidding war you
have created; obviously they have been more suc
cessful capitalists than the other party and are the
best choice if you want a firmly capitalist govern
ment. In this instance, voting returns a double
profit — in office and in your wallet.
5) writing in a candidate? Under our wonderful
system of elections, you have the option of putting
up whoever you please as a candidate, a last resort
for times like these when you can't stand the selec
tion. And you have the perfect person for the job:
you. Be honest — you know that the politicians on
the ballot already are either incompetent or hold
beliefs contrary to your own (otherwise you'd vote
for them). So, vote for yourself, a person who has
your goals in mind and can see where the other
guys are wrong. Didn't mom say you could be pres
ident one day if you ate your asparagus?
If your sense of modesty prevents you from put
ting your name down, no problem. Write me in.
Why not? I'll need a job when I graduate, and I've
always wanted to live in Washington, D.C. Think
about it.
You can use any one of the alternatives above, or
come up with one on your own to make this elec
tion work for you. Just be sure that you do vote, so
that the democratic system is a success for
everybody. You'll be glad you did.

indirect vote for simple capitalism. Call the local
party representatives for both parties, and ask them
what their best offer is for your support in Novem
ber. Hint that you know other students who might
also sell their votes and that you might be willing to
work out a package deal. The party with the most
money will undoubtedly win the bidding war you
have created; obviously they have been more suc
cessful capitalists than the other party and are the
best choice if you want a firmly capitalist govern
ment. In this instance, voting returns a double
profit — in office and in your wallet.
5) writing in a candidate? Under our wonderful
system of elections, you have the option of putting
up whoever you please as a candidate, a last resort
for times like these when you can't stand the selec
tion. And you have the perfect person for the job:
you. Be honest — you know that the politicians on
the ballot already are either incompetent or hold
beliefs contrary to your own (otherwise you'd vote
for them). So, vote for yourself, a person who has
your goals in mind and can see where the other
guys are wrong. Didn't mom say you could be pres
ident one day if you ate your asparagus?
If your sense of modesty prevents you from put
ting your name down, no problem. Write me in.
Why not? I'll need a job when I graduate, and I've
always wanted to live in Washington, D.C. Think
about it.
You can use any one of the alternatives above, or
come up with one on your own to make this elec
tion work for you. Just be sure that you do vote, so
that the democratic system is a success for
everybody. You'll be glad you did.

"I can't stand either candidate — with such a
poor choice, why should I vote at all?" This is the
political opinion I've heard most frequently on
campus as the presidential election approaches. It
is a dangerous view, one that leads to voter apathy,
which in turn threatens to break down the demo
cratic system. Don't let it happen! If you think you
have no choice, you're wrong — just check the list
below. Why not try:
1) voting Communist? Here's one that probably
doesn't come to mind right away, but is certainly a
possibility. If you are bored with the Democrats
and the Republicans, and you're tired of getting up
to change the television channel when they come
on, then this could be a nice break. How about the
American communists' intention to abolish the
U.S. government in its present form as a refreshing
change from the old, familiar planks of the two
major parties? A more novel plan for cutting the
deficit would be hard to find. Besides, as a Stanford
student, one has another reason to vote commu
nist: appeasing the conscience. I know I've felt
guilty now and again for having it so good. If you
cast your vote for these folks, you can be proud that
you've done your part in combating that embar
rassing Stanford elitism! Don't be shy: Get out
your favorite red shirt, put on your best Josef Stalin
stone face and head for the polls. Gus Hall and An
gela Davis need you!
2) voting Libertarian? On the flip side of the
obscure parties coin, we have Ed Clark and friends.
Basically, they're as laissez-faire as can be. If you
want a government that just "provides national se
curity and delivers the mail," flick the Libertarian
switch. Feel the surge of adrenalin as the entrepre
neur within you rises to the surface and takes com
mand. A vote here may be just what you need to
show your friends and family what an independent
person you are. And you'll give that formidable im

pression of being well-informed. No one wants to
admit it, but who's heard of the Libertarians?
3) letting fate decide? A little voice inside of you
keeps saying that "fate," that mysterious guiding
force, has already settled the outcome of the elec
tion, although somehow it hasn't gotten around to
dropping you a card to name the lucky candidate.
Well, instead of surrendering to the feelings of in
significance that are sure to set in, why not make
"fate" reveal its choice to you before you vote?

Flipping a coin inside the voting both or covering
your eyes and flicking a lever at random are possi
bilities, albeit chancy ones. Or, pick a given day to
look in the newspaper and see which candidate
made the least number of stupid claims and accusa
tions — then vote for him. You might even want to
invite President Reagan and challenger Mondale to
a dorm party to have them thumb-wrestle for your
vote. Whatever method you use, you can be sure
that "fate" will show its true leaning, enabling you

to cast your vote with confidence.

party representatives for both parties, and ask them
what their best offer is for your support in Novem
