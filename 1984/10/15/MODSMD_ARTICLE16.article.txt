Reagan doesn't care
In choosing our nation's future at
the polls next month, we must not let
the imagery and hype of campaign
ing obscure the larger issues of this
election. Although tax proposals and
the deficit are getting the greatest
attention, the most telling difference
between the candidates is their view
of the nuclear arms race. President
Reagan believes that building more
nuclear missiles makes us more
secure; presidential candidate
Mondale believes a bilateral,
verifiable nuclear freeze would con
tribute most to our national security.
This election will decide the future
of arms control. President Reagan's
"Star Wars" plan to install a missile
defense system such as nuclear
powered lasers in space would vio
late three of our most important
arms treaties â€” the limited test ban,
the outer space treaty and SALT I.
What would be the future of Soviet-
American relations if these agree
ments, which took almost two
decades to negotiate, were allowed
to be ruined by Reagan's ill
conceived scheme? Having opposed
every arms control treaty negotiated
under any administration, Demo
cratic or Republican, Reagan prob
ably just does not care.
Mondale, on the other hand, has
demonstrated his concern about
these issues. Regarding the
Euromissile talks, he has said there is
no reason why the Soviets and the
Americans couldn't have agreed to
the "Walk in the Woods" compro
mise of 75 cruise missiles and 75
SS-20s. Instead these talks broke
down under the Reagan administra
tion, which led to our deployment of
472 cruise and Pershing II missiles
on straining the At
lantic alliance and getting no limit on
future Soviet deployment of SS-20s.
Beyond his inability or lack of
desire to achieve any arms control
agreement, Reagan is frighteningly
misinformed about the real nature of
nuclear war. Until very recently,
Reagan believed, and stated publicly,
that missiles launched from sub
marines could be recalled after
launching. Reagan administration
officials repeatedly have spoken of
"nuclear-war-fighting capability"
and made alarming statements about

the impact of nuclear war such as "it
would be a terrible mess, but it
wouldn't be unmanageable" and "if
there are enough shovels to go
around, everybody's going to make
it." These views are so extremist
even most Republicans don't agree
with them. More than 50 percent of
the delegates to the Republican
National Convention last August
said they support a nuclear freeze.
There is a broad-based consensus
in this country that something needs
to be done about the arms race, and
clearly the Reagan administration is
not representing the American
people in this regard. If all the
people who are concerned about the
dangers of nuclear war mobilize
behind the Mondale/Ferraro ticket,
we can pull Ronald Reagan's finger
off the button and start anew on the
path toward peace.

USW representation
In the United States, where the
interests of groups may clash or
where there may be competing inter
ests for a limited pool of resources,
you will find organizations represent
ing those varying groups, vying for
their share, protecting their interests,
compromising, negotiating, lobbying
and coming to agreements, under
standings and settlements with the
powers that they deal with and/or
work for. This process is at the heart
of our own domestic American
pluralism.
Professionals have their associa
tions and guilds: the doctors, their
American Medical Association;
lawyers, the American Bar Associa
tion; actors, the Screen Actors
Guild. Workers, who are aware of
the need for organization within our
pluralistic society, have unions.
Technical, maintenance and service
workers here on campus have their
organization, the United Stanford
Workers (USW) Local 680 of the
Service Employees International
Union. USW is important to all of us
who work here at Stanford, for, as
we all know, the contract gains which
USW representatives can negotiate
with the University administration
directly affect benefits and pay here

whether one is in the bargaining unit
or not. To be aware of this, shall we
say, multiplier effect, it is only neces
sary to think back a few years to the
time when Stanford workers and
professionals had no dental plan.
Therefore, I urge all who are
eligible to vote in the Oct. 30 elec
tion to cast their ballots for represen
tation by their union, the United
Stanford Workers. Further, I urge all
Stanford employees to join with
Cesar Chavez, Martin Carnoy and
others in attending the rally for USW
on Thursday at noon in White Plaza.

Hold the anchovies
I just finished reading the article,
by Marilyn Wann on Domino's
drivers (Daily, Oct. 8), and being a
delivery person myself I would like
to point out we all don't share the
same views on students as our assis
tant manager. Sure they don't always
tip, but it's not that they never tip.
Just last night I made $10 in tips
from students alone. And, there are
some students who are rude, like iWe
one who dove on the hood of my
little car in a revolting state of
drunkenness. Or, those who think
it's funny to place an order for a
room that didn't order; we drivers
don't get paid for the pizzas we don't
deliver, so we don't get any compen
sation for our gas on those deliveries.
Experiences like that are probably
what prompted the negative remarks
from our assistant manager. But,
speaking as a veteran driver of five
years and four campus stores, I can
honestly say that the students on this
particular campus are much nicer,
more generous and helpful by far
than any others I've delivered to in
the past. I would like to ask one
favor of them, though: When your
pizza is really late, that means we're
so busy we can't keep up no matter
how fast we run. So, the next time a
driver is standing in your doorway
out of breath, shirt soaked with
sweat, please, show some under
standing and try not to be too un
pleasant. It's not that we're not
trying.
