## Dogs make Card turnover and play dead 
### MARK ZEIGLER

Stanford found out what happens
when a football team plays poorly
against a not-so-poor team.
It loses. Big.
The Cardinal, now 3-3 overall and
1-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference, for
got its umbrella Saturday and was
soaked in the purple rain — and reign
— of the purple-and-gold-clad Wash
ington Huskies.
The final score was 37-15, but it
wasn't even that close.
Washington improved to 6-0 over
all and 2-0 in the Pac-10. Saturday's
win also makes the Huskies, ranked
second last week by the Associated
Press, the leading candidate to move
into the No. 1 spot after top-ranked
Texas tied Oklahoma, 15-15.
Stanford won Saturday's game on
the final team statistics sheet. The
Cardinal had more first downs (19 to
18), more total yards (425 to 306), a
greater average gain per play (5.9 to
4.4) and held the ball longer (32:13
to 27:47) than the Huskies.
Stanford also had more turnovers
(six to one) than Washington. Quar
terback Fred Buckley threw five in
terceptions, four of them in the first
half, and tailback Kevin Scott
fumbled once, also in the first half. So
it was no mystery why the scoreboard
told a radically different story than
the statistics sheet.
"We gave it away on turnovers," a
downcast Stanford Coach Jack Elway
told reporters after the game. "We
turned the ball over early. It's tough
to do that against an outstanding
football team. It really puts you in a
bind."
Those turnovers put the Stanford
offense in such a bind that it didn't
get things rolling until the fourth
quarter. By then, however, the issue
was no longer in doubt and a good
portion of the small crowd of 44,500
in Stanford Stadium was beating the
traffic home.
Washington led 27-3 at halftime
and 34-3 five seconds into the fourth
quarter. Stanford scored a pair of ex
tra point-less touchdowns late in the
game to gain back an ounce or two of
respectability.

Washington could very easily have
made it worse, though. The Huskies
graciously kicked a field goal from
the Stanford four yard line with 1:34
left and, after Buckley's fifth inter
ception, finished the game on the
Cardinal two.
There were bright spots for Stan
ford, two of them to be exact —
linebacker Dave Wyman and fullback
Brad Muster.
Wyman, last week's Pac-10 Defen
sive Player of the Week, had 17 total
tackles, eight unassisted and two for
losses. "I thought the defense played
well," Elway said of the Wyman-led
defense that held the Huskies to 20
points when they didn't gain posses
sion on a Stanford turnover.
Muster was even more of a force on
offense. In fact, except for a few big

pass plays in the fourth quarter,
Muster was the offense. The sopho
more fullback rushed for 146 yards
on 25 carries, including a 34-yard run
in the first quarter, Stanford's longest
run this season. Muster also became
the first Cardinal running back to
rush for over 100 yards since Vincent
White did it in 1982.
And, with five games remaining,
Muster has already rushed for more
yards (272 yards on 57 carries) than
any Stanford runner did last season.
"It was the (offensive) line, it
wasn't me," the modest Muster said.
"The line is doing the tough stuff
opening the holes. My job is easy —
to run through them. I don't know if
this (146 yards) takes the edge off of
losing. I hate losing no matter what."

But the way Stanford played in the
first half, Muster could have rushed
for 500 yards and it still probably
wouldn't have mattered.
So just how bad was the first half?
• Buckley completed twice as many
passes to Washington as he did to
Stanford. He was 2-of-15 for 60
yards, no touchdowns and four inter
ceptions in the half.
• The Washington defense outscored
the Stanford offense, 7-3.
"Those turnovers can get out of
hand," Elway said. "They kind of
snowball against you, and it's easy to
get taken out of it (the game) against
a team like Washington. It was just
one of those days.
"I'm sure some of those turnovers
were created" by Washington's
defense, ranked first nationally last

week in fewest average yards and
points allowed per game, Elway said.
"But some were the result of poor ex
ecution on our part."
Washington Coach Don James was
more thankful than complimentary for
the turnovers. "We got every break in
the world in the first half," he said.
They did. Stanford scored first on
Mark Harmon's 43rd career field
goal, which broke Rod Garcia's Stan
ford record of 42. The Huskies took
the ensuing kick-off and went 80
yards in 13 plays to take a 7-3 lead.
Sixty-one seconds later, Buckley
completed his first pass — to Wash
ington linebacker Joe Kelly. Kelly, a
running back in high school, raced 40
yards down the right sideline into the
end zone and it was 14-3.
The teams traded punts and, with

13:43 remaining in the half, Scott
took a pitch right, took a big hit and
Husky cornerhack Vestee Jackson
took the hall. And five plays and 2:31
later, Washington took a 21-3 lead.
The Huskies added a pair of Jeff
Jaeger field goals before the half and
another touchdown early in the
fourth quarter before Stanford could
get into the end zone.
Buckley finally found the range
and tossed a four-yard touchdown
pass to Jeff James with 6:58 to go.
Less than two minutes later, he con
nected with Emile Harry on a 61-
yard scoring strike, Stanford's longest
pass play this season. Although they
were late in coming, the touchdown
passes helped ease the pain for Buck
ley.
"I'm not placing the blame for the
game on my inexperience," said a
dejected Buckley. "1 felt comfortable
coming into the game. I think the fans
were gracious to me (for not booing).
I've always thought that it's far better
to have tried and failed than not to
have tried at all.
"The fact that I had a shaky first
half is not going to alter my confi
dence," he continued. "It's a tough
setback. But you saw the flashes of
brilliance that our offense can do."
Card notes
Both Elway and Buckley were able
to retain their sense of humor in the
midst of their disappointment. Asked
if he considered replacing Buckley,
Elway said, "My eligibility's out.
No." Asked if his five interceptions
were the most in his career, Buckley
said, "Yeah, even in my backyard."
Stanford's special teams play was
below par again. Freshman Doug
Robison punted three times for an
average of 29.3 yards per kick. Harry
returned two punts for four yards.
Harmon was not the only
placekicker who broke or tied a
school record Saturday. Washington's
Jaeger kicked three field goals Satur
day, extending his streak of games in
which he has kicked at least one field
goal to 15. That ties the Washington
record held by Chuck Nelson. Jaeger
has also kicked at least two three
pointers in seven straight games.
