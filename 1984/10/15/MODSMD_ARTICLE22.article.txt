# Huskies' defense may vault them to top
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It's one thing when a defensive
player or coach touts the defense. But
when players on the offense admit the
defense is carrying the team, then
you've got something.
And for the University of Washing
ton, 37-15 winners over Stanford
Saturday, it's the offensive players
that are praising the defense.
Take, for example, running back
Jacque Robinson, the fifth leading
all-time rusher in Washington his
tory. "Everyone says that defense
wins football games," he said. "And
they've been doing that this year. We
(on offense) feel that all we have to
do is show up for the game and the
defense will take care of everything
else."
The Huskies went into the game
ranked No. 2 nationally by the Asso
ciated Press. Their win and No. 1-
ranked University of Texas' tie with
No. 3-ranked University of Okla
homa should put Washington in the
top spot in this week's rankings.
Washington also entered the game
ranked first in two defensive
categories — fewest total yards and
fewest points allowed. The Huskies
were second in turnover ratio, with
17 more takeaways than giveaways.
So does that make it the best
defense in the nation? It depends on
whom you ask. The offense says yes,
the defense avoids the question.

"It's a goal to be the best defense,"
said linebacker Joe Kelly, "but I can't
say we are the best because I haven't
seen everyone else play. Our offense
is coming along, but we have to help
out the offense a little, so we see what
we can do."
What Kelly and his teammates did
Saturday against Stanford was force
six turnovers — five pass intercep
tions and one fumble. Kelly had two
interceptions, the first of which he
returned 40 yards for a touchdown in
the first quarter.
"The defensive line put a lot of
pressure and made him (Stanford
quarterback Fred Buckley) hurry his
pass," Kelly said of the first intercep
tion. "He was looking at our other
(inside) linebacker and just threw it.
"As soon as I caught it, I just said 1
didn't want to get caught (from be
hind)," he continued, "because if I
had got caught, the team would have
talked about me."
When Kelly says team, he means
team in the true sense of the word.
"Everybody's like best friends,"
linebacker Tim Meamber said.
"Everybody respects each others'
abilities out there."
However, it hasn't always been that
way, according to Kelly. "Last year,
we were together, but we weren't
family," he said. "We take the atti
tude that we're a family and just can't
let some team break up our family."
Kelly and Meamber said the key to

this year s defensive success is aggres
siveness. "We just try to be ag
gressive and attack," he said. "We
just try to get good breaks. If you at
tack the ball, pretty soon something's
going to happen. So we attack, attack,
attack."
Meamber said, "We try to be more

offensive than the offense. We say,
'Let's attack them and not wait for
them to attack us.' "
Meamber said Washington's plan
was not to let Buckley complete
passes early and "build his confi
dence." You might say the Huskies
succeeded, considering Buckley

didn't complete a pass until the 10:50
mark in the second quarter.
"We didn't need many blitzes to
put pressure on him (Buckley),"
Meamber said. "If you've got guys
like (6-foot-4, 255-pound) Ron
Holmes rushing, you don't need
many more than three guys rushing."

Despite the six turnovers, Kelly,
Meamber and the rest of the defense
weren't overly pleased with their per
formance. "We gave up too much
yardage," Kelly said. "This was prob
ably our worst day this season."
And for that, Stanford can truly be
thankful.

The Washington defense was designed to keep Stanford quarterback Fred Buckley
from "building his confidence" in the first half. That design worked very well as
Buckley completed only two of 15 passes.


Washington linebacker David Rill had one of five interceptions of Fred
Buckley's passes, as the Huskies harassed the Cardinal with their ag-

Adam Grossman/Daily
gressive defense. Despite the victory, several Huskies were disap
pointed with having given up so many yards.


The Stanford offense dominated the game's statistics. Unfortun
ately, those statistics included turnovers, where the Cardinal

Rod Searcey/Daily
had six to Washington's one. Kevin Scott's first-half fumble set
up a touchdown by the Huskies.
