# Water polo finishes third after upset
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
Two poor quarters of play ruined
an otherwise flawless weekend for the
Stanford water polo team as it came
out of the Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation/Pacific 10 Tournament at
Long Beach with three wins and one
loss.
The Cardinal, now 17-3 overall,
defeated the University of California
at Santa Barbara, Pepperdine Uni
versity and Cal State-Long Beach and
lost to the University of California at
Irvine 7-6.
According to Coach Dante Detta
manti, the first half of the Irvine game
was one of the worst halves of play his
team has had all season.
"In the first half of the Irvine game
none of our players could get the ball
into the net, " Dettamanti said. "We
had a great turnaround and came
into the second half playing really
well, but we just didn't have enough

time to win the game, the first half
had hurt us too much."
The Anteaters, ranked fifth in the
nation last week, were led by the
"awesome" play of J.R. Salvatore,
according to Dettamanti. Salvatore, a
junior, scored four goals. "Our
defense was unable to stop the
scoring of Salvatore, and in the end,
that was really the key to their vic
tory," Dettamanti said.
Stanford started off the tourna
ment on Saturday morning with a 15-
9 victory over Santa Barbara. Al
though the Gauchos came within
three goals in the second quarter, the
Cardinal scored five goals in the third
quarter to regain its six-goal margin.
Stanford defeated last week's No.
1-ranked team, Pepperdine, 9-7,
later that day. According to Detta
manti, his team's excellent defensive
play was the key to the victory.
"Our defense really put the pres

sure on Pepperdine's holemen," Det
tamanti said. "Both of the Waves'
key holemen, Grier and DeLaVega,
fouled out in the third quarter and we
were able to capitalize on their ab
sence."
After falling to Irvine yesterday
morning, Stanford went on to defeat
Long Beach 8-2 at 1 p.m. According
to Dettamanti, sophomore Chris
Thompson played his best game of
the season, scoring three goals.
Overall, Dettamanti was very
pleased with his team's performance
over the weekend. "We lost one
game, but I was very happy with the
way my players jumped right back
and made a major attempt to keep
playing their best," Dettamanti said.
"Every team loses once in a while,
and I am glad we lost this game rather
than a Pacific 10 league game."
Stanford will play UCLA Friday at
3 p.m. at DeGuerre Pool.
