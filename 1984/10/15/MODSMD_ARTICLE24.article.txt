### 
DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Tigers capped a
classic runaway season and captured their first World
Series since 1968 by defeating the San Diego Padres,
8-4, yesterday in the fifth game, as Kirk Gibson drove
in five runs with two homers.
Gibson's second homer, in the eighth inning, came
off relief ace Goose Gossage, who had not allowed a
run in seven previous World Series appearances. Lance
Parrish also homered off Gossage in the seventh in
ning.
The victory completed a three-game sweep of the
Padres at Tiger Stadium after the two teams had split
at San Diego.
In the final game, the American League champions
untracked a potent offense that led the major leagues
with 829 runs and 187 homers during the season. They
combined the timely hitting of Gibson in this game,
Alan Trammell throughout the Series and two
complete-game victories by Jack Morris to dominate
the Padres. Trammell went 0-for-4 Sunday, but he still
hit .450 with six runs batted in throughout the series.
The Tigers also took advantage of shoddy Padre
fielding and baserunning to turn a 3-3 game into a

runaway. „
Sparky Anderson became the first manager to win
World Series titles in both leagues. Anderson managed
Cincinnati of the National League to World Series
titles in 1975 and 1976.
The Tigers finally saw their starting pitching fail in
this game, a problem that had plagued San Diego
throughout the series, but Aurelio Lopez bailed the
Tigers out with some overpowering relief and Willie
Hernandez finished up.
Gibson, the American League playoff Most
Valuable Player, had slumped early in the series but he
quickly made up for it with a two-run, upperdeck
homer in Detroit's three-run first inning. He then
scored from third on a shallow fly ball to right field to
break a 3-3 tie in the fifth inning.
Left-hander Mark Thurmond lasted only one-third
of an inning for the Padres, giving up those three first
inning runs, but the telling run came off Andy Haw
kins, who had pitched 12 innings of relief in this series
before giving up a run.
