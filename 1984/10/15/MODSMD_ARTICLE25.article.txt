# Women lose to Hayward
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS 
After a 10-day layover, the Stanford women's soccer
team suffered a 2-1 defeat to Cal State-Hayward yester
day.
Stanford scored first when Hillary Lauer, who just
recovered from a foot injury, sent a cross into the middle
where leading Cardinal scorer Sue Moore received it and
scored.
The Cardinal defense kept Hayward's quick attack
scoreless until 30 seconds remained in the first half when
Hayward's all-league midfielder Laurie Powell tied the
score at one.
"They're a long ball team. They send it down to the
wings while pushing their full backs foward," Cardinal
winger Betsy Swann said. "In the first half we stopped

that."
Cal State-Hayward, ranked fifth in the Far West region,
established momentum in the second half and scored the
decisive goal with about 10 minutes remaining. For the
game. Hay ward outshot Stanford, 19-6.
Yesterday's game against Hayward marked the fourth
time that Stanford (1-4) has played a nationally- or West
Coast-ranked team in five games. The last three Cardinal
losses have been decided by one goal.
"We played well again, only to lose by a goal. It's get
ting harder to swallow," Stanford Coach Helen Keohane
said. "We need to channel our frustration in a positive
manner. We can't get down on ourselves."
Stanford will play Sacramento State at Sacramento
tomorrow.
