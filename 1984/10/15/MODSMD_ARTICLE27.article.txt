# Volleyball gets tough victory
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Cal State Long Beach 49ers
did not play as good as the "gold"
they might have been prospecting,
but they did make the Stanford wo
men's volleyball team work for a two
hour, 15-10, 15-9, 11-15, 15-8 Car
dinal victory Friday night.
The conference triumph gives the
Cardinal a 4-1 Western Collegiate
Athletic Association record, which is
good enough to put them in fourth
place behind USC, UCLA and first
place San Diego State. Long Beach is
in sixth place with a 1-5 WCAA
record.
"Cal State really played well,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Don Shaw said.
"They made us work for it. It was a
struggle at times. Long Beach gave us
some problems and we were making
mental errors."
The match was characterized by a
slow tempo because of sideouts and
turnovers.
Cardinal setter Deidra Dvorak at
tributed much of the seesaw game
style to Long Beach's inconsistency.
"We expected them to be off and on
â€” to play fantastically during a string
of points and then fall off," she said.
"And that's what happened. They
were hot at some times and inconsis
tent at others."
The 49ers appeared to be "hot" at
the beginning of each of the first
three games, taking leads of 4-1, 3-0,
and 3-0, respectively. Throughout the
match. Long Beach relied on ag

gressive defense. The 49ers' digs
were often uncontrolled, however,
and players fell over each other
several times in attempts to reach the
ball. But the team usually was able to
get the ball over the net, keeping it in
play.
The Cardinal offense did not ap

pear to become frustrated with the
length of the match. Stanford hit
ter/middle blocker Kim Oden played
well, getting several hits that landed
in front of the 49ers' 10-foot line.
The spikes seemed to get the home
crowd and the team going.
Senior hitter Bobbie Broer also

had several kills, complementing
Oden's angled shots with deep hits to
the back court.
After losing the first two games of
the match, the 49ers came out strong
in the third and made several impres
sive blocks en route to their only
game victory.
