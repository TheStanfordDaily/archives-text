## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's soccer team
beat the visiting U.S. International
University, 2-0, Saturday in a
game marred by four cautions and
36 total fouls.
Most of the fouls were results of
hard tackles, and several players,
including Stanford's Tom McGan
non, had to be taken out for much
of the game due to injuries.
The non-conference victory
raised the Cardinal's record to 7-
4-3, while USIU dropped to 7-7.
Senior striker Giancarlo Fer
ruzzi opened the scoring after 10
minutes, curving a corner kick di
rectly into the net. The goal,
however, was not Ferruzzi's
original intention.
"I was aiming for Rob (West, a
junior forward/midfielder) at the
near post," Ferruzzi said. "It just
so happens I got a draft of wind."
Although the goal was some
thing of a fluke, Ferruzzi said, "It
balances out, because 1 missed a
'gimme' in the 2nd half." He had
missed an open net from close
range early in the half.
Stanford's final goal came with
26 minutes gone in the first half.
Tom Rafalovich headed in a per
fect cross from Ferruzzi to provide
the winning margin.
Ferruzzi, Rafalovich and West
each have four goals and are 1-2-3

in Stanford scoring. Ferruzzi has
eight assists as well for 16 points,
Rafalovich has three assists for 11
points, and West has one assist for
nine points.
Senior goalkeeper Willy
Burkhardt had three saves. He
dove to push one corner kick that
was curving into the net over the
bar, and positioned himself per
fectly to smother another danger
ous shot that an USIU player
backheeled off a corner kick. He
recorded his fourth shutout of the
season and the 23rd of his career.
Stanford Assistant Coach
Hunter Stern said he felt that a
strong first half gave the Cardinal
the victory. "I was pleased with
the first half," Stern said. "We
created space, (and) knocked the
ball around well. We played effec
tively but not smart in the second
half-

said that Burkhardt, who has
started for four years and set Stan
ford goalkeeping records for saves
in a season and career shutouts,
has improved this season.
