# Bowl to bring limited bucks

Super Bowl XIX, a spectacle that
will bring nearly 90,000 free
spending fans and journalists to Stan
ford Stadium Jan. 20, won't bring as
much money into the community as

SUPERBOWL

most people imagine, according to
University and Palo Alto officials.
While local shops, restaurants and
hotels stand to benefit most from the
event, Stanford and the city of Palo
Alto will turn modest profits at best.
In addition to $2.3 million worth of
stadium improvements, many of
which were already planned, the Uni
versity will probably reap between
$200,000 and $250,000 from
souvenir, food and beverage sales, ac
cording to Athletic Department es
timates. The National Football

League is kicking in $500,000 of this
$2.3 million in exchange for rent-free
use of the stadium.
"I don't see an economic benefit to
Stanford per se," said Alan Cum
mings, associate director of athletics.
The University earned approxi
mately $300,000 for hosting nine
Olympic soccer games in the stadium
this summer.
Palo Alto officials estimate the city
will make a net profit of only $30,000
from the contest and its related activi
ties.
Palo Alto Mayor Larry Klein, in a
letter last March, said having the
Super Bowl at Stanford was "nice but
hardly a bonanza for this particular
city."
June Fleming, assistant city
manager, confirmed that the city will
take in approximately $130,000 from
sales'and hotel tax revenue, but will
spend $100,000 in police, fire, traffic,
cleaning and public relations costs.

Preparations for the 1985 Super Bowl are well underway in Stanford Stadium. But local
entrepreneurs may be disappointed. Palo Alto officials predict the city will garner only
about $30,000 from the game.
