## Dean Fred takes a bite of the Big Apple 
### JENNIFER ROSEN 
"It's great," said Fred Hargadon. These days his well
known catch-all phrase is being used to describe places
other than Stanford. "Living in New York is great."
Although "Dean Fred," as he was generally known by
students, may have left a 15-year career as dean of under
graduate admissions here, he does not seem to feel that he
has left Stanford behind.
"All of the Stanford grads yell to me on the street as I'm
walking through Central Park. Three different people
came racing by on bikes today," he said during a phone
interview last week.
Currently acting as senior vice president for administra
tion of the College Board, Hargadon says that although he
misses Stanford he invariably encounters students and
faculty in New York.
"I've seen at least one every day that I've been here —
of course it helps that I'm tall," he joked. "It's amazing
how many I run into — it makes New York City seem like
a small town."
"I had dinner with (Art History) Prof. (Albert) Elsen
and saw a slide show of the Rodins on campus. Students
call to keep up with things and are good about sending
cards and letters. With all of the crazy stuff I get on the
envelopes, everyone here is wondering who lives in this
apartment."
Hargadon said he is still unaccustomed to the East
Coast, and is finding himself a bit bewildered by city life in
general.
"I'm proabably going to get hit by a car gawking at
everything. I just walk around everywhere, see the archi
tecture and the people — it's just like watching TV," he
said.
"The cops really look like cops, the firemen really look

like firemen, the models really look like models. There is
a lot of fashion everywhere, and when everyone else is
rushing on to work, I stop and turn around to look."
East Coast weather is another new phenomenon which
Hargadon likes.
"My office looks out straight over Central Park. As
soon as the trees turn color, it will be a pretty picture
compared to Stanford's brown grass. It's a little cool and
I'm looking forward to fall."
As for work at the College Board, the organization re
sponsible for advising the Educational Testing Service on
the SAT and Advanced Placement examinations, and ad
ministering the College Scholarship Service, Hargadon
said that he is superintending the organization, while
learning his job.
"I'm doing a bit of everything. Overseeing the whole
operation and finances. I'm also learning what on the job
training is. I already know all of the people that work here
and that really helps."
A loyal sports fan, Hargadon is still following the foot
ball scores. "We've already won twice as many games as
last year; maybe it helps that I'm not there." he said.
His license plates still read ADMITS, and in a sense
Hargadon says that he has not really abandoned his
former job.
"There was a lump in my throat the day I knew the
frosh were arriving," he said "I'm going to miss not going
to dorms to talk. Stanford is the land of play, but it's also
the best university around, and I'm probably recruiting
just as many people out here as there."
However, there are some drawbacks to Stanford ties.
"I'm not very anonymous — I can't get away with any
thing back here. Got to be careful with so many Stanford
people around," he said.
