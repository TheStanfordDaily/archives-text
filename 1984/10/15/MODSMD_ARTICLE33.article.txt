# Popcorn: a tasty, trendy snack grows in popularity

Unlike Jack's Corn Crib, which has
become a franchise with over 25
stores in the East, Corn of Plenty, lo
cated in Georgetown, District of Co
lumbia, has been in business just over
a year. Owned by Colonel Benton,
the store offers over 40 flavors.
"I like to say that we offer a cor
nucopia of gourmet flavors prepared
in various cornfigurations! I believe

that the number of flavors that can be
produced is as infinite as the imagina
tion. One of my favorites is Colonel
Ben's apple pie," said Benton.
A graduate of Georgetown Univer
sity, Benton majored in linguistics.
He then went on to become a profes
sional musician. From there he taught

at Harvard University for a while,
and tiring of that he went into televi
sion production. "I've done a lot of
different things. This is my first time

in the food business, though. I've al
ways loved popcorn but I attribute
this venture to my little 12—year-old
daughter who adores the stuff."
Benton sees popcorn as a growing
industry. "Just being in Georgetown,
which is kind of a boardwalk, I see
how people like to try new things. It's
my dream to become the Famous
Amos of popcorn and open an inter
national franchise."
The fact that this new kind of pop
corn is so readily available has posed
some problems for those companies

that produce ready-pop types of corn.
After all, it seems that it's no longer
acceptable to pop Jiffy-Pop on the
stove.
"The popcorn conoisseur will buy
Orville Redenbacher's gourmet pop
ping corn." said a stock person at
Safeway.
What about Stanford students? "I
like popcorn because it's one of the
few things that's easy to make, tastes
good, is good for you and low in
calories," said junior Eric Rosenfeld .
Ted Coen agrees, "It's a cheap
source of filling food." So the next
time you see a popcorn popper, just
remember it has more uses than just
drying wet socks.
