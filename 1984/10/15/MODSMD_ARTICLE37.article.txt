committed to hosting a quality event
and won't pinch pennies in order to
turn a profit.
"We're going to spend whatever is
necessary to make it successful,"
Cummings said. "When it's all said
and done, if we have a modest profit
I'll be pleased.
"Our goal is not to maximize
income," Cummings stressed.
He said local entrepreneurs who
are hoping to rent out their dorm
rooms or homes for the weekend are
likely to be disappointed. According
to Cummings, San Francisco busi
nesses will benefit most from the
game.
"People are on vacation, and they
will be at Stanford really only on Sun
day, Jan. 20," he said. "The main
center of activity for people coming
from all over the country is San Fran
cisco."
Cummings said he has heard
people saying they plan to "make big
killings [from the game J. . . and that's
just a bunch of nonsense. I don't
think that's going to happen to the
extent that people would like."
Vicki Rudin, executive assistant to
Palo Alto's city manager, agreed:
"Most of the benefits are probably
going to go to San Francisco."

According to Super Bowl planners
in San Francisco, one of the teams
will stay in San Mateo and the other
will stay in Oakland. In addition, one
will practice in Candlestick Park and
the other in the Oakland Coliseum.
Out-of-town visitors are expected to
stay in San Francisco and take buses
to the game.
Nevertheless, many local hotels
have been booked for months. The
Stanford Park Hotel in Menlo Park
and Palo Alto's Holiday Inn. Rickey's
Hyatt and the Palo Alto Hyatt hotels
all report no vacancies for Super
Bowl weekend.
All four hotels will be hosting large
groups and organizations — but not
the average fan, according to hotel
spokepersons. ABC Television has
reserved approximately 100 rooms in
the two Hyatt hotels, said reserva
tions agent Lamont Goring.
Goring said the Hyatts' combined
550 rooms were all booked
"technically as soon as it [the game]
was announced" in January. He said
a Hyatt executive committee reserved
the rooms for media and sports repre
sentatives, and has since rented the
rooms out to such groups.
Because the game will take place
on a weekend — a time when these
hotels are generally only 40 to 70
percent filled — each hotel stands to
make a substantial profit.
"It'll be a little bonus for us,"
Goring said. "There's a weekend in
volved, so we're talking 100 percent
for that period."
Maria Lonsdale, a reservations
agent at the new Stanford Park Hotel,
said the hotel's 163 rooms were
booked for the weekend "before we
opened" last June. Like the Hyatt
hotels, nearly all the rooms are
reserved for Super Bowl-related offi
cials.
Lynn Scheinberg, a sales official at
Holiday Inn, said the hotel was
already inundated with room requests
early in the year.
"We had TV people here as if we
were giving rooms away," Scheinberg
said.
On the day of the game, the crowd
will be sitting in a stadium sporting a
newly renovated press box, a new

locker room at the open end of the
stadium, a permanent ticket office
and expanded concession stands and
restrooms.
Of this $2.3 million in stadium im
provements, the NFL will foot
$500,000. Donors chipped in $1.2
million in gifts, and the University is
giving $300,000 in utility improve
ments, which it expects to recover
with lower utility rates. The rest, ac
cording to Cummings, will be shared
by the NFL and ABC and other com
munications groups.
Cummings said many of these im
provements are already pending,
"but the advent of the Super Bowl
kind of accelerated our timing on
these things."
The NFL will give Stanford
$125,000 to provide for stadium
clean-up, preparations and security,
Cummings said.
Stanford's estimated $200,000 to
$250,000 profit represents a
percentage of concession sales at the
game, he said.
