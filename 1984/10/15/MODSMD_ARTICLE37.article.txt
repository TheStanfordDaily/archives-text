committed to hosting a quality event
and won't pinch pennies in order to
turn a profit.
"We're going to spend whatever is
necessary to make it successful,"
Cummings said. "When it's all said
and done, if we have a modest profit
I'll be pleased.
"Our goal is not to maximize
income," Cummings stressed.
He said local entrepreneurs who
are hoping to rent out their dorm
rooms or homes for the weekend are
likely to be disappointed. According
to Cummings, San Francisco busi
nesses will benefit most from the
game.
"People are on vacation, and they
will be at Stanford really only on Sun
day, Jan. 20," he said. "The main
center of activity for people coming
from all over the country is San Fran
cisco."
Cummings said he has heard
people saying they plan to "make big
killings [from the game J. . . and that's
just a bunch of nonsense. I don't

Hyatt and the Palo Alto Hyatt hotels
all report no vacancies for Super
Bowl weekend.
All four hotels will be hosting large
groups and organizations — but not
the average fan, according to hotel
spokepersons. ABC Television has
reserved approximately 100 rooms in
the two Hyatt hotels, said reserva
tions agent Lamont Goring.
Goring said the Hyatts' combined
550 rooms were all booked
"technically as soon as it [the game]
was announced" in January. He said
a Hyatt executive committee reserved
the rooms for media and sports repre
sentatives, and has since rented the
rooms out to such groups.
Because the game will take place
on a weekend — a time when these
hotels are generally only 40 to 70
percent filled — each hotel stands to
