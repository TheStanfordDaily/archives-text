# Ethics of voter registration in question
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
In the wake of a record drive by Stan
ford and Bay Area groups to register
voters for the Nov. 6 election, charges of
unethical and illegal registration practices
have been traded between partisan groups
on campus.
The Valley Oak Institute for Voter Par
ticipation, an umbrella registration pro
gram composed both of Stanford students
and community volunteers, claims to have
registered 20,000 voters in the Bay Area.
The institute, founded in April, ended its
registration drive Oct. 9 and has ceased
activities.
While the institute, which is one of
three registration blocks on campus,
professes to be non-partisan. Republican
leaders here are asking whether Valley
Oak has sacrificed ethics in its zeal to
recruit voters.
Steve Dauber, president of Stanford
College Republicans said he thinks it
"unfortunate" that partisanship has to
seep into registration drives, "but it hap
pens on both sides of the political spec
trum, and nobody likes it."
Nobody, Dauber says, but the
Democrats. Dauber, a sophomore major
ing in electrical engineering, called to task
both Democratic registration groups and

supposedly non-partisan groups like the
Valley Oak Institute that, he said, trick
the University and the public into believ
ing their efforts are non-partisan when
they're really not.
"I don't have any problem with these
groups registering (people) to vote,"
Dauber said, "but I definitely think
they're partisan." Dauber specifically at
tacked the Valley Oak Institute for several
instances of what he claimed were unethi
cal activities in the name of non-partisan
voter registration. Most specifically, he
spoke of instances of what he called
"targeting" of heavily Democratic areas
by the institute.
But he adds, "I have no evidence" to
back up the targeting charge.
The major indictment against the Val
ley Oak Institute, in Dauber's view, is a
piece of literature it distributed at its
registration tables until Republican
registration groups began to complain.
Titled "1984 Elections: The Candidates,
the Issues, and Our Future," it lists, in
tabular form, the Democratic and Repub
lican candidates for president and con
gressman (12th District) and their posi
tions on varying issues.
Dauber claimed the sheet was written in
such a way as to make the Democratic
candidates' stand on issues like the eco

nomy and Central America attractive,
while making the Republicans' stand look
unappealing. There was a "minor alterca
tion" between the Republican and the
Valley Oak tables when the Republicans
tried to get the Valley Oak workers to dis
continue distribution of the sheet, Dauber
said. The case was finally taken to the
ASSU, and it was only then that the Val
ley Oak Institute decided to stop using the
sheet.
Brad Barham, the president of the Val
ley Oak Institute, responded to Dauber's
claim by saying the Republican groups
that have been on campus to register
voters have "dirty laundry of their own"
to air. Barham cited the instance of a
black student in Escondido Village he at
tempted to give a registration form to, and
who said, "Get the hell away from me" to
Barham before he realized it wasn't "the
Republicans in White Plaza" at his door
again — refusing to give him a form be
cause he wouldn't pledge to vote Republi
can.
Barham added that the Valley Oak In
stitute was "more than forthcoming" in its
response to Republican demands that it
pull the offending literature from its drive
efforts.
In response to Dauber's claim that the

institute was "targeting" heavily Demo
cratic areas in its efforts, Barham said that
the impression that non-partisan groups
"target" Democrats arises from the fact
that disenfranchised voters — the in
stitute's only real "target," according to
Barham — tend to be Democrats, or live
in heavily Democratic areas.
Barham, in defining "partisanship,"
termed it "recommending whom to vote
for and taking a stand on what candidates
to vote for in particular." The Valley Oak
Institute does not takes stands on whom to
vote for, said Barham; its aim is to in
crease the number of voters overall.
In that regard, Barham added, "We
registered way more Republicans than
they'll ever register."
Campus Democrats seem enthusiastic
about their efforts to get people to vote
for a Mondale-Ferraro ticket, despite
predictions by much of the national media
of a Reagan victory, if not a landslide.
"There's a total turnaround in this elec
tion in the way voter registration has been
approached," said Michelle Dreyfus, an
undeclared sophomore working for Stu
dents for Mondale-Ferraro. "Voter
registration is something everyone knows
about now."

the impression that non-partisan groups
"target" Democrats arises from the fact
that disenfranchised voters — the in
stitute's only real "target," according to
Barham — tend to be Democrats, or live
in heavily Democratic areas.
Barham, in defining "partisanship,"
termed it "recommending whom to vote
for and taking a stand on what candidates
to vote for in particular." The Valley Oak
Institute does not takes stands on whom to
vote for, said Barham; its aim is to in
crease the number of voters overall.
In that regard, Barham added, "We
registered way more Republicans than
they'll ever register."
Campus Democrats seem enthusiastic
about their efforts to get people to vote
for a Mondale-Ferraro ticket, despite
predictions by much of the national media
of a Reagan victory, if not a landslide.
"There's a total turnaround in this elec
tion in the way voter registration has been
approached," said Michelle Dreyfus, an
undeclared sophomore working for Stu
dents for Mondale-Ferraro. "Voter
registration is something everyone knows
about now."
In the wake of a record drive by Stan
ford and Bay Area groups to register
voters for the Nov. 6 election, charges of
unethical and illegal registration practices
have been traded between partisan groups
on campus.
The Valley Oak Institute for Voter Par
ticipation, an umbrella registration pro
gram composed both of Stanford students
and community volunteers, claims to have
registered 20,000 voters in the Bay Area.
The institute, founded in April, ended its
registration drive Oct. 9 and has ceased
activities.
While the institute, which is one of
three registration blocks on campus,
professes to be non-partisan. Republican
leaders here are asking whether Valley
Oak has sacrificed ethics in its zeal to
recruit voters.
Steve Dauber, president of Stanford
College Republicans said he thinks it
"unfortunate" that partisanship has to
seep into registration drives, "but it hap
pens on both sides of the political spec
trum, and nobody likes it."
Nobody, Dauber says, but the
Democrats. Dauber, a sophomore major
ing in electrical engineering, called to task
both Democratic registration groups and

supposedly non-partisan groups like the
Valley Oak Institute that, he said, trick
the University and the public into believ
ing their efforts are non-partisan when
they're really not.
"I don't have any problem with these
groups registering (people) to vote,"
Dauber said, "but I definitely think
they're partisan." Dauber specifically at
tacked the Valley Oak Institute for several
instances of what he claimed were unethi
cal activities in the name of non-partisan
voter registration. Most specifically, he
spoke of instances of what he called
"targeting" of heavily Democratic areas
by the institute.
But he adds, "I have no evidence" to
back up the targeting charge.
The major indictment against the Val
ley Oak Institute, in Dauber's view, is a
piece of literature it distributed at its
registration tables until Republican
registration groups began to complain.
Titled "1984 Elections: The Candidates,
the Issues, and Our Future," it lists, in
tabular form, the Democratic and Repub
lican candidates for president and con
gressman (12th District) and their posi
tions on varying issues.
Dauber claimed the sheet was written in
such a way as to make the Democratic
candidates' stand on issues like the eco

nomy and Central America attractive,
while making the Republicans' stand look
unappealing. There was a "minor alterca
tion" between the Republican and the
Valley Oak tables when the Republicans
tried to get the Valley Oak workers to dis
continue distribution of the sheet, Dauber
said. The case was finally taken to the
ASSU, and it was only then that the Val
ley Oak Institute decided to stop using the
sheet.
Brad Barham, the president of the Val
ley Oak Institute, responded to Dauber's
claim by saying the Republican groups
that have been on campus to register
voters have "dirty laundry of their own"
to air. Barham cited the instance of a
black student in Escondido Village he at
tempted to give a registration form to, and
who said, "Get the hell away from me" to
Barham before he realized it wasn't "the
Republicans in White Plaza" at his door
again — refusing to give him a form be
cause he wouldn't pledge to vote Republi
can.
Barham added that the Valley Oak In
stitute was "more than forthcoming" in its
response to Republican demands that it
pull the offending literature from its drive
efforts.
