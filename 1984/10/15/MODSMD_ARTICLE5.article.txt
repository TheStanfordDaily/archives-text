# "Christa" no ordinary cross

### MARY YUH 
Propped up against the wall in Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-Kelly's office in Memorial Church is a
crucifix. But it's no ordinary crucifix.
"Christa," created by Edwina Sandys in 1975 for the
United Nations' Decade for Women, represents Christ as
female. Until earlier this year, the controversial bronze
work had been quietly displayed in secular settings, such
as museums and art shows.
But during Holy Week in April, "Christa" was placed
near the high altar in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine
(Episcopal) in New York City, where it raised a furor. The
Suffragan Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York
called the sculpture "theologically and historically in
defensible," and "Christa" was subsequently removed.
But Hamerton-Kelly, who arranged to have the crucifix
displayed here, said the work is "wonderful."
"I believe it appeals to the spirit in a new and powerful
way," he said. "It has been here for several days now and
has had a profound spiritual effect on me."
On Wednesday, "Christa" will be officially welcomed
into Memorial Church with a public panel discussion
chaired by Hamerton-Kelly. The panel will include the
artist and Marilyn Yalom, acting director of the Center for
Research on Women at Stanford (CROW). The sculpture

will be displayed
through Decem
ber.
Hamerton-
Kelly said that
the crucifix is a
symbol with sig
nificance that
overrides the his
torical facts of
both Christ's race
and gender.
"Christa" does
"not challenge
the fact that
Christ is male,"
he said. "It does
not celebrate

Christ as an historical fact, but celebrates an eternal truth
about humanity and its relationship with God. Theology
at its most basic level sees Christ as representative of the
whole human race to God, and of the Divinity to the
whole human race."
With that view, Hamerton-Kelly said he has always felt
the need for something like "Christa." He said it was
providential that he read about "Christa" and then imme
diately began arrangements to bring it to Stanford.
"A university's function is to teach and make the intel
lectual world bigger, but also to make the emotional, spir
itual world bigger," he said. " 'Christa' makes the emo
tional and spiritual world bigger."
Yalom points out that "Christa" hits the Church in an
especially vulnerable spot. In particular, Catholic doctrine
purports that since the priest is representative of Christ
and the disciples, and they are male, women cannot be or
dained as priests.
" 'Christa' is a manifestation of the mystical and
theological notion of the body of Christ that 'makes
visible the feminine aspects of Christ,' " she said. "It is
provocative in the best sense of the word in that it raises
questions about the traditional place of women in the


Robert Hamerton-Kelly
"I see it with positive curiosity. It is
a part of a larger movement to revi
talize traditional religion, to make it
more meaningful and more appropri
ate for our times. But I do have a
little trouble with the visual represen
tation of Christ as female, because of
the historical fact that he was male,
even though I agree with the con
cept," Yalom added.
As a religious work of art,
" 'Christa' leaves so much room for
interpretation," according to Wendy
Smith, associate dean of the Chapel.
"Those who object to the sculpture
tend to interpret it literally and his
torically," she said. "I view it sym
bolically. Jesus came to save women
as well as men and both women and
men are a part of the body of Christ,
therefore a woman can represent
Christ."
In recent years, several artists have
noted that there have been many
crucifixes that are historically inac
curate in that they represent Christ as
other than a Jew — as black or Asian,
for example. These have not encoun
tered the controversy that "Christa"
has aroused. Rather, they are viewed
as representing the spirit that Christ is
for all of mankind.

" 'Christa' leaves so much room for
interpretation," according to Wendy
Smith, associate dean of the Chapel.
