Ford, UAW reach tentative accord
DETROIT — Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto Workers union
reached a tentative agreement yesterday on a new three-year contract,
while UAW locals voting at General Motors Corp. appeared to have
clinched ratification of a similar pact.
The accords would give the nation's two leading automakers three
years of labor peace and establish worker assistance programs unprece
dented in American industry.
The Ford agreement, which covers 114,000 hourly workers in the
United States, was struck after a marathon 25-hour weekend bargaining
session, highlighted by a two-hour meeting between UAW President
Owen Bieber and Ford Chairman Philip Caldwell Saturday night.
"The tentative agreement follows closely the pattern established by
the UAW at GM," Bieber said yesterday. "Like GM, here too at Ford,
job security was the key issue, and the tentative agreement that we have
just reached follows the (GM) pattern."
However, Ford said it had preserved its demands that the contract be
tailored to fit its smaller size and resources. When asked if the agree
ment would be costly to Ford, Stan Surma, executive director of the
company's labor relations staff, replied, "We don't think so."
The GM agreement, hammered out last month following a six-day
strike against 17 selected plants, was virtually assured of ratification by
the union's 350,000 members at GM. By yesterday afternoon, the pact
was winning approval from about 59 percent of those voting, and the
UAW was expected to release the final voting results late last night.
Mondale criticizes Reagan plan
MINNEAPOLIS — Presidential candidate Walter Mondale charged
yesterday that President Reagan's "Star Wars" proposal to protect the
United States with an anti-missile space shield is "a hoax" that relegates
decisions about starting a nuclear war to a computer.
He renewed his challenge to the president to offer the Soviet Union a
"space freeze" on weaponry in the heavens — but seemed to doubt that
Reagan would accept it.
Mondale summarized Reagan's policy this way: "If there's an arms
agreement, oppose it. If there's a dangerous weapon, buy it. If the Pent
agon wants a blank check, sign it. If there's a crucial fact, don't learn it. If
there's a diplomatic problem, militarize it. If there's a regional conflict,
Americanize it. If your policies fail, blame someone else."
The Democratic presidential candidate's remarks, during his weekly
paid radio broadcast and at a news conference afterward on a sidewalk
in downtown Minneapolis, set what his advisers said would be the tone
for an abbreviated week of campaigning on foreign policy and arms con
trol. Both men meet in their second debate, a session devoted to these
topics, Sunday.
Hussein says he'll buy Soviet arms
WASHINGTON — Jordan's King Hussein has informed U.S. officials
that he expects to turn to the Soviet Union for arms later this year fol
lowing unsuccessful efforts to arrange weapons purchases here.
That prospect is said to concern U.S. diplomats who have tried un
successfully to help the Jordanians buy air defenses and other arma
ments from France, Britain or Austria following the collapse of an
American deal last spring, according to U.S. officials.
Hussein reportedly has said credit terms are an important factor in his
decision to go to Moscow.
"There are only two stores in town that offer credit terms and that's
the United States and the Soviets," said one U.S. official. "Everything
else is pretty much a cash-and-carry deal. That's money up front, and
that's money they don't have."
The Reagan administration had proposed to sell Jordan Stinger anti
aircraft missiles and to spend $220 million to create a Jordanian mobile
strike force for the Persian Gulf.
But Hussein rejected the plan in March after it encountered intense
opposition from the American Jewish community and supporters of Is
rael on Capitol Hill.
Since then, the Jordanian monarch has said the Middle East policy of
the United States is so tilted toward Israel that it precludes any role as an
evenhanded broker with Arab moderates.
Israel moves toward withdrawal
CAIRO, Egypt — A top Egyptian official and Israel's prime minister
made separate statements yesterday indicating some movement toward
an arrangement to withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.
A senior advisor to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that
recent talks intended to lead to the troop withdrawal had made
"significant progress" and that the remaining obstacles could be
overcome.
And in Tel Aviv, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres told reporters
upon his return from a weeklong visit to the United States that his
Defense Ministry would present to the Cabinet within a month a
withdrawal plan that could be implemented within six to nine months of
its acceptance.
But well-placed U.S. officials visiting Cairo with Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weitiberger cast doubt on the Egyptian report, saying that they
were unaware of any basis for it. Weinberger is traveling to Israel tomor
row afternoon after reviewing separate maneuvers by Egyptian forces
and the multinational peacekeeping forces in the Sinai.
Student held suspect in slaying
FULLERTON — A 20-year-old Vietnamese student has been ar
rested on suspicion of killing his former physics professor in his office at
Cal State-Fullerton Saturday.
Edward Cooperman, a nuclear physics professor for 16
years at Fullerton, had conducted cooperative studies with Vietnamese
scientists on the effects of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange. He was
seen by some Vietnamese refugees as a supporter of the communist
government in Hanoi, some students and community residents said yes
terday.
Minh Van Lam, of Westminster, Calif., who was arrested in connec
tion with the slaying, told campus police hours before his arrest on
campus that he discovered Cooperman's body when he visited the pro
fessor's office shortly after 3 p.m., said Sgt. Bruce Evans of the univer
sity police force.
Cooperman, 48, had been shot, campus police said, but they declined
to release any details. No motive for the murder has been established,
Evans said.
Cooperman's wife, Klaaske, said yesterday that her husband had
received death threats in recent months in connection with his scientific
work with Vietnam and was advised by FBI agents to "buy a gun and
learn how to use it."
Fred Reagan, FBI spokesman in Los Angeles, said yesterday he knew
nothing about threats or of any investigation involving Cooperman.
Afghan soldiers ask for asylum
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — An Afghan army officer and two of his
subordinates who crossed over to Pakistan on Friday in their armored
personnel carrier have sought political asylum, officials reported here
Sunday.
The Pakistan government is considering the request of the officer,
identified as Lt. Mirajuddin, and his two crew members,
Mohammad Sharif and Mohammad Nabi, the officials said.
They said the armored carrier was a Soviet-made BTR-60 version ca
pable of carrying 14 fully armed personnel and equipped with a 42.5 mm
gun and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine-gun.
It was driven into Pakistan at Saeed Thana, near Pishin, about 400
miles southwest of Islamabad.
The Pakistan government does not make public its its decision on
asylum requests by defecting Afghan military personnel.
