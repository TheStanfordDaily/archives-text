## Rebels set for peace talks 
### 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador —
In a first step toward hoped-for
peace, two leaders of the political
wing of the leftist rebel forces fighting
the U.S.-backed government of El
Salvador arrived here yesterday for
talks aimed at ending five years of
civil war.
Guillermo Ungo and Ruben
Zamora of the Revolutionary Demo
cratic Front landed at this capital's in
ternational airport at 12:21 p.m. in a
small turboprop plane of the Colom
bian air force that had flown them
here from Panama.
They were to leave soon afterward
for the mountain town of La Palma
63 miles away to meet with leaders of
their guerrilla wing, the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, and
make preparations for talks with
President Jose Napoleon Duarte
scheduled to take place in La Palma
today. The International Red Cross
extended them the security of an es
cort under the Red Cross flag.
Duarte, addressing the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly in New York a week

ago, invited the rebels to the talks.
It was the first public appearance of
rebel leaders here in several years.
Soldiers and travelers looked on im
passively as Ungo and Zamora en
tered the passenger terminal, carrying
their own bags. They were accompa
nied on the trip here by diplomats
from the French and Colombian em
bassies in Panama and a Panamanian
government official.
They were met by a single Sal
vadoran official, spokesman Gerardo
Le Chevalier, and by the ambas
sadors to El Salvador of Panama,
Colombia and France, and Red Cross
officials. Le Chevalier did not shake
hands with the rebels.
Ungo and Zamora are both dissi
dent Salvadoran politicians who fled
the country during the ascendency of
right-wing death squads in the early
years of the civil war.
Ungo, president of the Revolution
ary Democratic Front, headed a
military-civilian junta that governed
El Salvador briefly after a 1979 coup
by liberal army officers. The junta

collapsed as rightist and leftist vio
lence erupted into civil war.
After quitting the junta in 1980,
Ungo traveled in and out of El Sal
vador, denouncing death squad activ
ities. Terrorists twice blew up a print
ing shop that he owned. By spring, he
had taken exile in Panama and joined
the rebel movement.
Zamora, a former government
minister, is now a leading spokesman
for the Revolutionary Democratic
Front. He also fled El Salvador in
1980 after his brother, Mario, was
killed, presumbably by right-wing as
sassins.
Neither had returned to San Sal
vador until yesterday.
It was still unclear who would rep
resent the Farabundo Marti front at
the La Palma talks. Farabundo Marti
is the umbrella organization of guer
rillas under arms.
Ungo and Zamora expressed some
doubt yesterday that the talks will
make progress toward peace.
"We have reservations about its
being a serious dialogue," Zamora

said during a brief airport news con
ference. "But we are determined to
give this dialogue the real content and
seriousness that it deserves."
They emphasized that they did not
come to negotiate from a position of
weakness. The rebel political and mil
itary wings "will have sufficient
power to develop and conduct
negotiations," Zamora said.
Ungo told reporters: "We are
demonstrating unity after more than
three years of struggle. We are offer
ing our part toward a dialogue of
serious content."
The rebel politicians complained
that security for the talks is deficient
"We are taking so many risks. But 1
think peace is worth it," Zamora said.
Saturday, a communique from a
right-wing death squad threatened
anyone who supported the talks, spe
cifically President Duarte.
Red Cross officials said that thev
are handling the transportation of the
rebel leaders but are not arranging
their lodging.
