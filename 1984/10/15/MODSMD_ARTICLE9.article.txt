# Candidates' stereotypes may be false

### 
WASHINGTON — The way their opponents
tell it, President Reagan's inclination in any foreign
policy crisis is to send in the Marines, while
presidential candidate Walter Mondale's instinct is
to avoid the use of military force even at the cost of
national humiliation.
But like so many issues in this year's presidential
campaign, it isn't that simple. There is very little in
the record or rhetoric of either candidate to sup
port the stereotype that the election pits "the mad
bomber versus the wimp."
In fact, some recent statements and actions by
the candidates contradict the stereotypes.
When Mondale, for example, suggested a mili
tary "quarantine" of Nicaragua if that nation used
force beyond its borders, he was effectively advo
cating deployment of U.S. combat forces in an area
where Reagan has authorized nothing more than
training and financial assistance for rebels opposing
the leftist government.
And Reagan chose restraint over vengeance in
refusing to order military retaliation against the
terrorist suicide bombers who have attacked three
U.S. facilities in Beirut and taken 260 American
lives.

Despite differences in emphasis, both Reagan
and Mondale have said they would use force only if
peaceful diplomacy failed. But despite the
"Vietnam syndrome" — America's reluctance to
back diplomacy with military muscle in the wake of
the Vietnam war — neither has disavowed the use
of force.
Reagan's reputation as an advocate of military
solutions to political problems began with a series
of hardline speeches before he became president.
Once he entered the White House, he engineered a
massive military buildup, implying a willingness to
use the new hardware. Contributing to his belliger
ent image were some offhand — and sometimes
off-the-record — comments, such as his musings in
a 1981 meeting with newspaper editors that it
might be possible to have "the exchange of tactical
weapons against troops in the field" without es
calating to World War 111, and his joking reference
during a recent radio microphone test to bombing
the Soviet Union.
The record shows that Reagan was willing to
send an invasion force of about 6,000 Marines and
Army paratroopers to the Caribbean island of
Grenada, where they overcame a force of several

hundred Cuban military personnel and construc
tion workers and the fast-disintegrating Grenadan
army.
Moreover, the president sent a Marine contin
gent to Lebanon to support a diplomatic effort
aimed at shoring up the faltering government of
President Amin Gemayel. And when some of
Gemayel's domestic enemies directed sniper fire at
the Marines, Reagan responded by authorizing the
use of the battleship New Jersey's fearsome 16-
inch guns in an effort to intimidate the opposition.
But when a suicide truck bomber destroyed the
Marine barracks, killing 241 U.S. servicemen.
Reagan choose to withdraw rather than increase
the military pressure. The senior official said the
president chose not to retaliate "despite the
outrage and some pretty good intelligence as to
who did it."
Where Reagan has acted — in Grenada and
Beirut — Mondale's words have been no less
militaristic than Reagan's deeds.
