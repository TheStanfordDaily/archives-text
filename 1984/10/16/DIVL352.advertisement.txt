And we put them in the fast lane as fast as
possible. Often, from day one.

elite corps of engineering, computer and
marketing professionals. And you'll thrive in an
atmosphere of creative freedom.

expanding product lines. In memory systems. In

communications. Plus exciting new areas just now
emerging.
And as part of United Technologies, one of
the world's largest broad-based high technology
