A Guide for Improving Thinking, m
Learning, and Creativity
John D. Bransford and Barry S. Stein
This highly readable book by two
cognitive psychologists teaches a
sound, methodical approach for resolving problems. The authors
suggest new strategies for improving memory, for overcoming blocks to
creativity, and for communicating more effectively with a wider range of
people. Liberally sprinkled with everyday examples, brain-teasing drawings,
and amusing anecdotes, The IDEAL Problem Solver is the ideal remedy for
the myriad problems that confront and confound us daily.
