As the last hours of daylight slipped away yes
terday, members of Democratic presidential can
didate Walter Mondale's advance team and con
struction workers were busy arranging and rear
ranging White Plaza for Mondale's speech today
at noon.
Mondale arrived from St. Louis at San Fran
cisco International Airport yesterday at 5 p.m.
and spent the night at the San Francisco Airport
Hilton. Upon his arrival at the airport, Mondale
held a short press conference, where he criticized

President Reagan's knowledge about nuclear
weapons. The comments came as part of a week
long offensive gearing up for Sunday night's
presidential debate, which will focus on foreign
policy issues.
In addition to Mondale, Sen. Gary Hart (D.-
Colo.) and singer/songwriter Stephen Stills are
scheduled to appear in White Plaza today.
Allegra Wilde, lead press coordinator for the
Mondale campaign, said Hart will begin speaking
at approximately noon and will introduce
Mondale around 12:10. The candidate is ex
pected to speak for 25 to 30 minutes.
Mike Burns, coordinator for the California
Democratic Victory Drive, told The Daily Sun
day that Mondale will speak on the topics of
nuclear-arms control, women's issues, environ
mental issues, toxic wastes and financial aid.
Mark Lemley, a member of Stanford Students
for Mondale-Ferraro, said there are plans for a
"Reaganbuster" skit, in addition to an appear
ance by the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Vince Vizza, a member of the advance team
who has been in town for five days, haggled yes
terday with other workers in an attempt to find
the perfect angle for the flatbed trailer from
which Mondale will make his address.

Vizza said he has arranged speaking areas for
Mondale in at least 10 cities since Memorial Day.
That truck trailer, which will be decked with
bunting, balloons and drapery, is at an angle be
tween the steps of the post office and the grassy
area in the center of the plaza. Directly opposite
the truck about 50 yards away sits another
flatbed where approximately 150 members of the
national press are expected to be scrapping for
the perfect view of Mondale, who will face
Tresidder Union.
As of 4:30 p.m. yesterday, Mondale was
scheduled to enter from behind the platform and
climb stairs located on the side closest to the post

office. At the conclusion of the rally, Mondale
will "maybe shake some hands when he comes
down across the front," Vizza said.
Vizza said he would still be at White Plaza this
morning at 2, looking at the setup. A work crew
will begin putting the final touches on the area
this morning at 6:30 and should be finished by 9.
More than 30 risers will be placed near the
speakers' platform and throughout the plaza for
people to catch a glimpse of the Democratic
hopeful.
Vizza said he didn't want to predict the crowd
size, but added he doubted that White Plaza
would hold the earlier predicted figures of 8,000
to 10,000 people.
