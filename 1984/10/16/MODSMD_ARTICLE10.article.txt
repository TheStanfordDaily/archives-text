## The 						infamous incomplete: cop-out or quick fix? 
### AMY BIRD 
It's the middle of dead week. The
image of your face in the mirror gives
the term "dead week" graphic ac
curacy. Everything would be OK if
you didn't have to finish that final
paper by Monday. You pray for the
miracle that will get you through, and
your prayer is answered. You take an
incomplete.
Some students owe their lives to in
completes. Others see them as cop
outs symptomatic of a lackadaisical
attitude toward academic learning.
The University has a written policy
about incompletes, but it's general
and leaves much to the discretion of
professors and students.
A definition of the incomplete ap
pears on page 42 of the 1984 Stan
ford University Information Bulletin.
It reads as follows:
"This grade should be restricted to
cases where the student has satisfac
torily completed a substantial part of
the course work. The time limit for
satisfactory completion of the course
work will be determined by the in
structor, but ordinarily should not be
more than one calendar year from the
date of the final examination in the
course in question. No credit is given
until the course is completed and a
passing grade is received. The I grade
is not changed in a student's record
until another grade is received from
the instructor. A passing grade
removes all reference to the intial I
grade. An NC received from the in
structor will be treated the same as an
initial NC. A student may petition
that a course with an I grade be
removed from his or her record."
Associate Registrar Robert
Houghton commented on the

meaning of the incomplete in Stan
ford's grading policy. He said that the
incomplete has always been a part of
the grading policy, and that the me
chanics of the incomplete have
changed little over the years. It is
reserved for those cases when stu
dents, for various reasons, opt to
complete course work at a later date
than the end of the term during which
they were enrolled in the course.
Houghton said, however, that the
University's attitude toward incom
pletes has changed in the last few
years. This change reflects a change
in the University's philosophy toward
grading.
Before 1970, the University's phi
losophy toward grading was best ex
pressed by the word "commitment."
"We felt that when students enrolled
themselves in a course they commit
ted themselves to the work in the
course and to the outcome,"
Houghton said.
At that time, an incomplete meant
a failure to honor the commitment to
a course. It was a blemish on a stu
dent's transcript until the work was
completed and a grade was reported.
In 1970, the University's philoso
phy toward grading changed. "Our
philosophy changed in 1970 to one of
achievement. We wanted the tran
script to demonstrate what the stu
dent had accomplished," Houghton
said. Since then an incomplete has
represented a neutral state of limbo
until the grade measuring the stu
dent's real achievement comes in.
There are some guidelines that
keep students from using incompletes
to circumvent all the time pressures
of their studies. Failure to complete a
minimum number of course units

over three quarters results in aca
demic probation. Again, academic
probation is not the kiss of death,
merely a restatement of the necessity
of completing course work on time.
Experiences of students with in
completes vary depending on the cir
cumstances of the incomplete. Fran
cesca Flynn, a senior majoring in
human biology, has taken two incom
pletes during her years at Stanford.
One of them she took for a SCIRE
(Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education) project.
"Projects always take longer than you
think to finish. It would have been
absurd not to be able to take an in
complete and finish the work like I
wanted it finished," Flynn said.
She added that she felt it was im
portant for students to have a choice
about when or whether to finish a
course they had started. "You're a lot
more important than any grade you
ever get or any class you do or don't
complete," she explained.
Refering to another class she had
taken an incomplete in, Flynn said
that she didn't know if she would
finish it or not. "But the class was
valuable to me. I'm glad that even
though I didn't feel able to finish it
then I didn't have to lose it forever
like it didn't matter to m.e."
Flynn said that taking an incom
plete is not always the right choice. "I
would ask anyone thinking about
taking an incomplete if it really
makes any difference if they finish the
course now or later, and to look at
their motivation for taking an incom
plete."
