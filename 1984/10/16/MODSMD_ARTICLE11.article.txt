## The 						Stanford Daily Dear Mr. Mondale: 
### 
When you address the Stanford community
today, we will have a chance to see what you
stand for. But it is also a chance for you to see
what we stand for. Students are an increasingly
important part of the voting population. There
are 7,376 voters registered at Stanford, many of
whom are voting in their first presidential elec
tion. There are several issues that are important
to students, here and elsewhere, which deserve
your attention.
• Student loans: In 1981 the Reagan administra
tion cut $2 billion in Social Security education
benefits and imposed income restrictions on the
Guaranteed Student Loan program. Under the
revisions, students must now demonstrate need if
their family income is above $30,000. These low
cost loans were previously available to all stu
dents regardless of need. By the end of this year,
3,000 to 3,500 students at Stanford will be de
pendent on GSLs to finance their educations.
• Draft registration: The Solomon Amendment
denies federal financial aid to students who have
not registered for the draft. Most men attending
college are between 18 and 24 years old and are
therefore required by law to register for the draft,
whether or not registration goes against their
moral beliefs. Women, however, are not required
to register at all.
• United Stanford Workers: USW, Local 680, is
currently struggling with the University for its
right to exist. An election to be held Oct. 30 will
determine whether or not 1,300 workers at Stan
ford will have a union to represent them. Blue
collar workers nationwide have given you their

support. What is your position on this labor
management conflict?
• Poverty and jobs: President Reagan points to a
lower unemployment rate and lower interest
rates as signs of recovery. Indeed they are, but
the recovery has been uneven. The people who
need the most help are not getting it. The poverty
rate is still high and millions are still out of work.
• Nicaragua: Your recent comment that you
would consider a military "quarantine" of
Nicaragua if that nation employed force beyond
its borders has raised questions about your view
of the role of the United States in Nicaragua and
Central America.
• The Contadora treaty: Nicaragua's latest
overture for peace — its support of the conditions
of the Contadora treaty — has been coolly
received by the current administration.
• Grenada: Last year's invasion was originally
denounced by Democrats, including you, as an
unnecessary use of U.S. force. More recently,
however, you said you have changed your mind.
Should the United States be exerting its influence
militarily in situations like Grenada? And what
does that portend for Central America?
• South Africa: The United States continues to
trade with South Africa despite that country's
failure to end apartheid. The United States and
Britain were the only two nations that voted
against the recent United Nations condemnation
of South Africa's new racist constitution.
The 1984 presidential race has been a combi
nation of images and issues. Today we get to see
the real thing. We challenge you to address issues
appropriate to a college environment.
