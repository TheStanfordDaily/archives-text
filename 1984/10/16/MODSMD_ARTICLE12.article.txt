## A
						Stern warning on food 
### 
Complacency in the hierarchy of an
institution is a terrible thing, espe
cially when it causes the needless suf
fering of hundreds of people. The
institution of which I am speaking is
Stern Hall food service. For as far
back as any student can remember,

VIEWPOINT

Stern Hall has had a notorious
reputation for the worst food on
campus, yet nothing has ever been
done to rectify this terrible injustice.
As money and resources are used to
build a new Inner Quad, a new music
building, a renovated stadium and a
beautiful, posh new group of
residences for a fortunate handful of
students, not a finger is lifted nor a
penny spent to improve one of the
most important aspects of the lives of
more than 600 Stanford students:
their daily bread.
I have lived in Stern for less than a
month, but already I have had
enough. At first, I accepted the uni
dentifiable casseroles, hamburgers
laden with bone chips and leather
pork chops stoically, figuring it was
an unavoidable element of my stu
dent life. But after dining with friends
at Sterling Quad, Yost House and
even my freshman residence, Wilbur
Hall, I discovered that Stern food was
exceptional in its awesome repulsive
ness. As fraternity, row house and
Governor's Corner residents dined
like royalty, my fellow Stern residents
and 1 were forced to suffer the indig
nity and horror of our dreadful fare.
In the famous words of Mahatma
Ghandi, "Where there is injustice, I
always believe in fighting."
Therefore, I feel that the time for ac-

tion on this matter is at hand. If the
quality of the food does not markedly
improve, and if University President
Donald Kennedy and the con
glomerate that controls University Food
Service do not take immediate
investigative, dynamic action, I pro
pose an all-Stern hunger strike. For
one day, every resident shall abandon
his sub-trough-quality food and dine
at locations all around campus, while
the slop of Stern rots in the kitchens.
Finally the message will be clear. We
have one of the most expensive meal
plans in the United States, and we at
tend the finest educational institution

The time for ac
tion on this matter
is at hand.

in the world. It is time for the Stan
ford administration to realize that
Stern food service is much more
than a point of shame and embarrass
ment, much more than a joke and a
reputation: It is what some 600 stu
dents must force into their mouths
every day of their school lives.
Granted, Stern prepares for a
relatively large number of students in
comparison to the row houses and
fraternities. But the geniuses who run
food service need look no further
than Governor's Corner or the eating
clubs for a way to improve the situa
tion. Instead of ignoring Stern Hall

and its residents, some effort should
be made on the part of the adminis
tration to reassess the situation. Until
the glorious day when Stern Hall is
destroyed for good, people will have
to eat there. Why not break the ser
vice up into several smaller kitchens
or institute the Governor's Corner
point system in order to upgrade the
quality and preparation of the food?
Or, why not investigate the feasibility
of setting up eating clubs in Stern,
similar to the famous Toyon system,
known for providing creative, high
quality meals at a lower price than
food service, which I envision as a
miniature version of the Department
of Defense, spending $75 on a baked
potato, or signing corruptly lucrative
contracts with illicit farmers and meat
packers. One must wonder how much
of our board fee actually goes to pay
for our food, and how efficiently the
system is run. If, as it has been staled,
inflated board fees are allocated to
pay for sundry administrative debts,
should this burden not be spread
more evenly, rather than being taken
out on those who are forced to pur
chase a meal plan by virtue of their
residence? Considering that residents
of Stern pay the same or more than
students at other locations around
Stanford and more than almost any
other university, it is a disgrace that
they are served food of lower quality
and, as it would seem, less skillful
preparation. This is just not right; it is
imperative that the era of inef
ficiency, injustice and complacency
come to an end. We're not gonna
take it anymore.
