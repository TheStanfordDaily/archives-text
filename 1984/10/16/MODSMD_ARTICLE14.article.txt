## Voting is not meaningless 
### 
Columnist Tim Quirk's "The Rites of Passage" (Daily,
Oct. 10) has made an art form out of the sort of unin
formed apathy for which our generation is becoming in
famous. His theme, such as it is, is loosely organized
around the following logic:
1) Both candidates are losers. Former Vice President
Walter Mondale in particular is "no fun."
2) The forces shaping the public's views are beyond our
control and rest largely with the major media.
3) Hence, voting is neither inspiring nor meaningful. In
fact, as rights go, it's a pretty dull one.
Let's handle these one at a time.
As for President Reagan, I applaud Quirk's charac
terization of him as someone who would be laughable
were he not so dangerous. Mondale, however, is about as
far from a "loser" as our candidates have come. Tutored
under Sen. Hubert Humphrey before Humphrey's fall
from grace over Vietnam, Mondale fought for everything
that was best in the social reform movement following

VIEWPOINT

World War 11. He was working for an idea called "civil
rights" before the Supreme Court made it a law and long
before the Kennedys knew what poverty or discrimination
were. (They were still chasing communists on the Hill.)
For 12 years he amassed one of the most liberal voting
records in the U.S. Senate in modern history. Yes, he sup
ported tax hikes. He also supported the progressive public
works, educational aid, foreign aid and environmental
protection programs those revenues helped to finance. In
his honesty, industry and representation of his constitu
ents he was above reproach. The Democratic Party was
elated to see him chosen for the vice presidency in 1976, a
job he handled with more responsibility and influence
than any previous occupant.
As to Quirk's criticism, yes, I would proabably rather
party with Bill Murray than Fritz Mondale. The candidate
could stand a dose of humor; he refreshed us all by ex
hibiting some during the last presidential debate. But in
this most important of elections, humor seems almost to
mislead us. We embrace it because we think it evinces a
good heart. Yet Quirk himself admits that ordering 2,000
Marines, under questionable legality, to dispatch a few
hundred Cubans is hard to reconcile with a good heart no
matter how much the Great Communicator might make
us laugh. On the other hand, Mondale's entire profes
sional life has spoken to equity at home and sanity abroad.
Enough said.
Shaping public opionion has, indeed, been one product
of the vigorous growth of the media and its influence. But
any advertising mogul will tell you that word of mouth is
by far the best sales booster. Granted, Quirk's vote counts
no more than anyone else's and therefore fails to register
his intensity of commitment. Even the Greeks recognized
that as a drawback of democracy. In our age, however,
word of mouth can supplement a vote.

So I challenge Quirk to take a clue from the ad people
and overcome his professed helplessness. At the northeast
corner of El Camino Real and Castro Street in Mountain
View sits a building at an angle to the streets with a
Mondale-Ferraro sign the size of the deficit atop it.
You can't miss it. Head down any day between 10 a.m.
and 7 p.m. and ask what you can do for your country.
If Quirk truly wants to be useful, I'll see him soon at
work on the campaign. If not, we can presume his piece
was merely another sophomore's exercise in self-serving
sophistry.
And finally, as to the right to vote. I can suggest alter-

native residences far more haunting and relevant than
"some unnamed Eastern Bloc country": try Mississippi,
Alabama, or Georgia. Or try any of dozens of northern
cities where gerrymandering and at-large elections effec
tively stymied minority particpation until well into the last
decade.
Voting isn't one of those quirky rights inherited from
the founding fathers at which many now snicker; it's not
like the right not to quarter soldiers in your home. Nor has
it been rendered constitutionally meaningless, like the
equal protection clause. In fact, it remains one of the Con
stitution's most vigorous provisions. Of the surviving
amendments passed since the Civil War, a majority have
been devoted to expanding the franchise.
If none of this has reached Quirk, it is my failing. But I
ask him in closing to remember one thing: Somebody paid
the price for his right. Forget about 200 years ago and for
get Gettysburg. He doesn't have to look back any farther
than his own lifetime: Dallas, Memphis, Selma, Los An
geles, and others. And while I'm sure Quirk respects their
sacrifice, I suppose he thinks he doesn't owe them any
thing. And he may be right.
But we owe ourselves more.
