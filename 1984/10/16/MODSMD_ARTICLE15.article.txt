## Out of the teflon frying pan 
### 
Every four years the United States experiences
its own specialized, made-to-order revolution: the
presidential election. It is a time during which we,
the American public, examine the principles and
actions of our government and decide whether we
have enjoyed our course. On Nov. 6, we may opt
for dessert and compliment the chef or demand a
barf-bag and elect another cook. President Reagan
has prepared us pride-in-apple-pie continental
fare. He has served hot dogs and pull-up-your
bootstraps ethics, jellybeans and old actor
amiability. If we look at his teflon-coated pots and
pans, however, we will find a tasteless residue. Per
haps Reagan's mistakes have not stuck to him, but
the garbage is still there.
Reagan argues that a $600 billion-per-year
defense budget is necessary to defend democracy,
to preserve our right to peace and liberty. We must
stockpile nuclear weapons, because we can
negotiate only from strength. Might makes right,
and we should be more than wholly comfortable
with Reagan's policies, because he possesses,
ahem, privileged information and intelligence. Fa
ther knows best: He will protect us, making us
strong and proud.
Crusading for peace during Reagan's four years
in office, the United States invaded Grenada and
established a military outpost, excluding the press
to expedite the military's endeavors. Hundreds of
American soldiers died in Lebanon for a mission
and for a cause that no one understands. The CIA
mined the harbors of Nicaragua; it destroyed
Nicaraguan crops, physical facilities and 1,300
civilians. And then Reagan ignored the World
Court decision condemning his terrorism. He main
tains that all his policies are based on what he con
siders "morally good and right."

Reagan claims that the United States is the most
peaceful nation on this earth. And yet, he has es
calated the arms race and antagonized the Soviet
Union. He has opposed all nuclear arms agree
ments, and he proposes building death-stars to
defend ourselves against the "evil empire." He
jokes that he has passed legislation proclaiming the
Soviet Union off-limits, that he will begin bombing
in five minutes.
The joke is not funny. When you consider that
Reagan has said we can survive a limited nuclear
war if we build enough shelters, the joke is insane.
When you consider that the Soviet Union declared
war on the United States in retaliation for Reagan's
remarks, that programmers have corrected com
puter malfunctions three seconds short of reeling us
into nuclear holocaust and that our president
believes we can recall launched missiles, Reagan's
war-of-the-apes deterrence is lethal. Negotiating
degrees of annihilation is inane. Crushing countries
and waving clubs creates fear and terror, not
respect. You cannot eradicate an idea by force.
You can dream of a better way. Father does not
know best. He condemns the Soviet Union's inva
sion of "Pakistan." He sleeps during summits.
Reagan's air of infallible, democratic justice reeks
of ignorance and lies.
The Ku Klux Klan endorses Reagan, because our
president has opposed every major piece of civil
rights legislation. He has rejected the Equal Rights
Amendment, and he allows the U.S. Treasury to
back a $1.1 billion International Monetary Fund
loan to the white regime in South Africa. A univer
sity may now receive tax-exempt status, even
though some of its departments may discriminate.
And, the Supreme Court ruled that seniority

overrides affirmative action in determining job ten
ure. Reagan chastises his opponents for intolerance
and bigotry, and yet he hopes to impose voluntary
school prayer.
All of these flaws, reflecting Reagan's shattered
morality, deserve closer attention, but no political
issue will gain more attention than the economy.
Women today earn 57 cents to a man's dollarâ€” a
figure worse than it was 10 years ago. Forty percent
of black families live below the poverty level. The
disposable income of the poorest one-fifth of all
American families has declined 7.6 percent since
1980. The budget deficit is $176 billion. Despite
these shortcomings, the economy is Reagan's
cherry, because the disposable income of the
middle class, three-fifths of all American families,
has increased 0.9 percent since 1980. The richest
one-fifth of the economic stratum increased their
income 8.7 percent during the same time period. In
other words, four-fifths of all American families
are better off financially than they were four years
ago.
We are faced, then, with serious questions con
cerning the course of our country. Is the United
States a land of knuckles and nickles or of peace
and opportunity? Do we, the public, value our
pocketbooks or our morals? Or are the two ends
actually the same? The American public is obvi
ously deaf to Mondale's tax cry so far, and will
probably call for Reagan's dessert on Nov. 6. We
tend to ignore the flies in our salad when it is prop
erly dressed and the roaches in the entree when it is
covered in an appealing sauce. The golden apple,
however, is poisonous, and we may die.
