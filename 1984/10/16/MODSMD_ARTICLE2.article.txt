# RAs pan alcohol inquiry

### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
In an attempt to determine the na
ture of alcohol use and abuse on
campus, Residential Education has
asked resident assistants to report
"each alcohol-related incident which
you observe and which you learn of'
in University residences.
"This report wasn't intended to put
RAs in a position of snitching on resi
dents," said Res Ed Dean Norm
Robinson. "We don't want every
drink a student drinks recorded, but
just clearly problem-related inci
dents, such as when a resident gets
sick, passes out or trashes a dorm."
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Res
Ed, said the survey, which is slated to
last for the rest of the year, is part of
the University's commitment "to do

everything we can to help students
make safe choices about alcohol
u.iage."
"We're interested in what's hap
pening in a simple, descriptive way,"
she said. "We can have no idea of
what kind of problem we're dealing
with until we gather sufficient infor
mation."
"We need to gather some kind of
baseline data in order to know if what
we try in the way of educational pro
grams is useful later on. This is a long
time process, and we're certainly not
relying just on these reports from the
RAs," Supton said.
But the survey has not been
warmly received by everyone on
campus. Yvonne Campos, an RA at
Branner, said the survey "has a ter
rible, terrible format" that provides a

limited look at alcohol use here.
41 You have no incentive to turn
[the survey sheets] in because they
ask you to identify your house,"
Campos said. "Every RA I know
threw them away."
Tod Bergstrom, another Branner
RA, said he finds the survey's mission
confusing and "not exactly conducive
to RA-student relationships."
Robinson emphasized that the sur
vey "is not an attempt to identify any
students, but simply what kind of
problems if any we have regarding al
cohol use at Stanford."
"Our purpose, really," Robinson
said,"is to point ourselves in a direc
tion for the future betterment of our
educational programs."
But Bergstrom said, "The bottom
line is that the RAs don't really un

derstand why Res Ed asked us to
complete this form. If they were
going to use these incidents as a basis
to turn around and prohibit alcohol in
the dorm, then I would have lost all
control as an RA, especially since the
students will go ahead and drink
anyway."
The survey, which is slated to con
tinue for the rest of the year, is a way
to garner information in a very
decentralized housing system, Supton
said. "We have no overall informa
tion as to how many students drink to
the point of passing out or getting
abusive," she said. "When these
things happen, it may be discussed
among the RAs and RFs, but it may
or may not get to Res Ed."
Supton acknowledged that the
reporting system has caused confu
sion among some RAs, and that Res
Ed may have "to do a better job" ex
plaining the purpose of the survey.
Heather Millar, an RA in Donner,
said, "The reports are not that big of
a deal, but they do seem to put an RA
in a position of being a 'reporter' on
our residents' activities. I'm also not
so sure of how accurate the survey
will be because RAs don't know
every tirpe a student gets drunk, or
they don't want to go and write it
down and file the fact within three
days as is requested."
