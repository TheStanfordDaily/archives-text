## A
						quick sightseeing trip down route 280 
### FELICIA WONG 
Those who think that Stanford
University, with its imposing Hoover
Tower and formidable Claw, has a
monopoly on famous local landmarks
might want to think again. Perhaps a
leisurely drive down famed Interstate
280 would change some minds.
1-280 is no ordinary thoroughfare.
Not only are its wide lanes and
sloping turns welcome relief for
drivers weary of traversing truck
riddled Highway 101 or permanently
congested Highway 92, hut its
route through scenic San Mateo
County is dotted with impressive, of
ten controversial, but always intrigu
ing landmarks.
About five miles north of Stanford
is the first of I-280's vista points. Fol
lowing the exit and driving up the
winding hill leads to a spectacular
view of the lakes which line the high
way and the Filoli Estate. If the latter
seems oddly familiar, there is good
reason — the estate is the setting for
both Hollywood's successful movie
"Heaven Can Wait" and television's
prime-time soap, "Dynasty."
Dynasty House
From the vista point, the view of
the Filoli Estate is almost identical to
the helicopter shot which opens
"Dynasty" each week. The estate and
its gardens, both of which were
private property until they were
deeded by owner Mrs. William Roth
to the National Trust for Historic
Preservation in 1975, are truly mag
nificent even in San Mateo County,
an area where stately homes are a
dime-a-dozen.
The red brick mansion was de
signed in 1916 by California architect
Willis Polk. The formal gardens,
world-famous for their stunning
design and colorful foilage, were laid
out by multi-media artist Bruce
Porter.
Today, besides serving as a Holly
wood backdrop, Filoli sponsors its
own charity functions, chamber and
operatic music concerts, lecture series
and dinner-dances. The entire estate
exudes an opulent air befitting
"Dynasty's" filthy-rich Carrington
clan.
For the show's 1980 pilot, many
"Dynasty" regulars, including John
Forsythe, Linda Evans, and Pamela
Sue Martin, were filmed extensively

on location at Filoli. (Interestingly
enough, the pilot had to be shot
twice; the first one, starring George
Peppard rather than John Forsythe as
patriarch Blake Carrington, was
never shown.)
Now, "Dynasty" film crews travel
to Filoli each year to film stock shots
of the estate and of extras posing as
members of the Carrington family, a
tour of Filoli, which must be booked
in advance by telephone, includes the
famous "Dynasty" staircase, the
often-seen library and the fabulous
ballroom in which Crystal and Blake
were married (and which Warren
Beatty converted into a gymnasium in
"Heaven Can Wait").
The trip to Filoli is certainly worth
the necessary efforts required to ar
range one.
Father Serra
The next landmark on this "280
Tour" is the infamous Father Serra
Statue, which overlooks Crystal
Springs Reservoir in Hillsborough. A
glimpse of the imposing, 22-foot-high
likeness of California's patron saint
can't be missed from the highway,
The statue's presence has sparked
both controversy and mischief ever
since the work's completion in June
of 1976.
The statue itself was the culmina
tion of a 40-year dream for sculptor
Louis Dubois. A self-dubbed "Serra
buff," Dubois spent $6,000 of his
own money to create the steel
reinforced cement statue and then
donated the sculpture to the State of
California.
Father Serra's rugged appearance,
which was intended by the sculptor to
represent the "rough-hewn qualities
of (Father Serra's) character" has led
to several local protests. The San
Mateo County Arts Council in 1976
denied any ties to the statue, its
design and its construction.
In 1978, local residents half
jokingly started a "Topple the Troll"
campaign which employed buttons
and bumper stickers to publicize its
message. In 1982, police made
numerous sex arrests at the statue
and the Caltrans rest stop at its base.
Reportedly, the area is a
"homosexual trysting spot" for local
men, who use the nearby telephone
to arrange appointments and then
meet in the men's restroom to fulfill
their obligations.

Also, thanks to pranksters, at
various times during the past eight
years the statue has worn a Santa
Claus hat and a Christmas wreath; a
paper-mache beanie complete with
propeller and an automobile-tire yo
yo; a "Go 49'ers — Super Bowl
XVI" banner; and has served as
placekick-holder for a gigantic Stan
ford football bearing the words
"Beat Cal."
The statue, which was dubbed by a
local journalist "The Pointing
Padre," is located directly across
from a third 1-280 landmark, a collec
tion of igloo-like domes fondly
named "The Flintstone House."
Dome Home
Like the Father Serra statue, this
mushroom-like structure has experi
enced its share of unforseen prob
lems. The house was built in 1976 by
Fame Homes, Inc. for Norma and
Tyrone Thompson. The couple hoped
that their "Dome Home," with its

The next landmark on this '280 Tour'
is the infamous Father Serra Statue,
which overlooks Crystal Springs Res
ervoir in Hillsborough. A glimpse of
the imposing, 22-foot-high likeness
. . . can't be missed from the highway.
The statue's presence has sparked
both controversy and mischief ever
since the work's completion.

3,200 "round feet" of living space, 16
stained glass windows, and two-acre
lot of prime Hillsborough property,
would start a trend.
Unfortunately, the Dome Home
started only a wave of architectural
guidelines devised to prevent another
such structure in Hillsborough. It also
provoked comments lamenting the
fact that "one can't legislate against
bad taste" along with remarks liken
ing it to "some kind of experimental
nuclear reactor."
Neighbors claimed that the home,
which was constructed by spraying
enormous, balloon-like devices with
liquid cement, lowered surrounding
property values.

When the Thompsons vacated a
few years after the home's comple
tion, the house, whose original asking
price was $765,000, brought only
$340,000 in an area where two acres
of prime land alone are worth as
much.
The home was subsequently rented
out but was then abandoned early in
1983 when winter rains permeated
the entire structure. The rain left the
interior damp and cracking.
According to local journalists, the
home was barely more than a
"potential mushroom farm" smelling
"like a wet fish tank" when it was
purchased by Herb Kritz in April
1983 for $295,000.
The home's odd design (which en
abled people to bump their heads on
the walls) and structural flaws had left
it vacant for months, but Kritz vowed
to spend $60,000 repairing his new
possession, claiming he would not
move after he fixed the damages.
Suddenly in July 1983, Kritz, citing

"personal changes", put the com
pletely restored home back onto the
auction block. It drew disappointingly
less than the $600,000 asking price
and was finally sold in October 1983
to Miles Foster, the owner of a
boating store in San Carlos who
claimed to "like the unusual."
Perhaps the once-exalted Dome
Home's ownership woes were due to
its conservative Hillsborough locale.
One resident said, "In Marin County,
it might have sold like hotcakes."
But the Dome Home isn't in Marin
County. Along with the Father Serra
statue and the Filoli Estate it sits on
what has been called "one of the most
beautiful highways in the world."


The Filoli Estate is a familiar sight to those who travel on 1-280, and to
viewers of the night-time soap "Dynasty." The lavish estate was also

of the mansion deeded it to the National Trust.

The Filoli Estate is beautifully landscaped. Surrounded by well
groomed gardens, the reflection of the greenery can be seen in the
pools on tne estate.

The "Pointing Padre," or the statue of Father Junipero Serra, points to
motorists on 1-280. The Father has been known to be a Cardinal fan —
he was seen holding a football that read "Beat Cal."
