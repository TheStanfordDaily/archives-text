## 'Sexual Perversity' thought-provoking 
### NANCY HENRY 
David Mamet's "Sexual Perversity
in Chicago" examines the
"perversions" — sexual, psychologi
cal, and emotional — that develop
within and among human beings as a
consequence of social impositions
and expectations. In a series of short
scenes, the play analyzes the complex
sexual interactions between four
characters, two men and two women.
Though the scenes at first seem dis
jointed, they eventually form a con
tinuum, revealing the evolution and
degeneration of relationships and in
dividual personalities. Given only the
dialogue and distinct characterization
of the men, specifically the uncouth,
insensitive, macho womanizer Bernie
Litko, one might take this to be solely
a merciless indictment of society's ob
jectification of women and a disgust
ingly realistic portrait of the "man" at
fault.

It is that; yet it also contains ele
ments within the script, and particu
larly in director Lewis Anthony's in
novative approach to the production,
that save the audience from smother
ing in an atmosphere of radical
feminist protest. The play is not an at
tempted atonement by a male
playwright for suppression of women,
nor a balm for the collective con
science of the American male. This is
an honest treatment of human
relationships, significantly insightful
and universal in its confrontation with
the complications of modern society
due to the perversions it has both in
herited and created.
The range of topics Mamet is able
to integrate both directly and subtly
into his dialogue, is impressive.
Scraps of information carelessly
tossed out as well as the intense
monologues allude to sexual abnor

malities and psychological problems
that originate in childhood. The num
ber of "perversions" the play suggests
is as disturbing as the reality of those
it examines. The stereotypes and un
inhibited conversations that charac
terize each glimpse into the lives of
seemingly normal people, call atten
tion to the narrowness of traditional
definitions, leaving little doubt that
behavior and attitudes society com
monly accepts are every bit as per
verse as those it shuns.
Masochism, pedophilia, and
sodomy are a few subjects touched
upon but ultimately de-emphasized.
Rather, it is dehumanization in the
singles bar, blind prejudice against
homosexuals and preoccupation with
gender roles that emerge as perverse
and contemptible. The play, simply
staged and acted, is a portrait of emo
tional vacuity as it is reflected in
sexual practice. The character that

embodies the majority of these social
ills is Bernie.
Crass, conceited, vulgar and
bigoted, Bernie speaks in typical
locker-room language with which
many males can identify. It is doubtful,
however, that they will identify with
or feel comfortable with this Bernie
and what he says.
It is the distinction of "Theatre in
Progress" to present this play with an
all-female cast. Bernie and Danny
are distinguished physically from
Deborah and Joan only by the ties
they wear. This adds dimension to the
themes, yet poses obvious problems,
especially with Bernie. In the opening
scene, actress Pamela Ponich comes
dangerously close to slapstick humor
in her eagerness to establish Bernie as
a chauvinistic jerk. Though the char
acter is comic in his extremity, to
overact would prove self-defeating.
Ponich slowly warms up and tones

down, maintaining character ad
mirably throughout.
Danny is, after all, a chauvinistic
jerk. Danny, Bernie's tyro, admirer
and victim, is appropriately under
played by Diane Halcomb, who suc
cessfully transforms her Danny under
the corruptive influence of Bernie.
Carol Alexander is convincingly
whimsical as the liberated Deborah
who loves to love men and women.
Jeannie Alexander's Joan conveys
the tragedy of a woman so victimized
by both male and female lovers that
she perpetuates unknowingly the very
mentality that oppresses her.
The fact that all the actors are of
the same gender, dressed identically,
underscores the androgyny of the
problems, the universality of the situ
ations and the tragedy of these
"perversions." The play is at once
suggestive and implicit, ambiguous
and exact as it offers the social in

equities, abuses and perversities for
us to see. In any one person or rela
tionship on stage we might recognize
ourselves or someone we know. Or
we may identify with them all; it is a
thought-provoking concept.
This producton is a modest one, in
finitely less ambitious than the com
pany and director's glorious first ef
fort, last spring's "Hair." Though
falling short of the professionalism
and polish it might have acheived,
and decisively not a major dramatic
event, the play has few pretensions; it
certainly deserves more attention
than it received from the handful of
people who attended the opening
night performance. "Sexual Perver
sity in Chicago" runs again Oct. 18
and 19 in Cubberley Auditorium (in
which this play will lose much of its
intended intimacy). Its value is in the
questions it raises; they concern us
all.
