# 'Scapino!': unrelated noises into harmony
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
Have you ever heard a number of unrelated noises
which seemed to come together in perfect harmony?
There is great satisfaction in hearing such unity in ran
domness. 1 found such satisfaction in seeing the produc
tion of "Scapino!" at the Stanford Theater.
Frank Dunlop and Jim Dale have created a modern
adaptation of Moliere's "Les Fourberies de Scapin."
Dunlop and Dale are faithful to Moliere's plot. Under the
direction of David Ogden Stiers, the Old Globe Theater
Company is faithful to Moliere's comic vision.
Set in modern Naples, "Scapino!" consists of a number
of improbable events which involve two youths, Ottavio
and Leandro, and their fathers, Argante and Geronte.
Both Ottavio and Leandro have fallen in love with women
who are unacceptable to their fathers, and they beg the
cunning and amiable Scapino to help them solve their
problems.
Scapino agrees, and what follows is a tortuous and often
incomprehensible plot. But the plot hardly matters. In
fact, this production minimizes its importance with such
clever techniques as the speed-telling of a plot summary
and the display of a sign reading "AUTHOR'S
MESSAGE" during one of the rare serious moments.
The beauty of "Scapino!" lies in its characters. Each
role is carefully crafted and holds great comic potential.
With very few exceptions, the actors of the Old Globe
Company succeed in tapping their parts for their essential
humor.
As these characters go off on their various tangents, it is
the task of Scapino (Harry Groener) to tie them all to
gether. Groener performs the task like a ringmaster. He
commands the stage with confidence and expertly controls

both the cast and the audience. Groener displays his abil
ity to take charge in a scene which exemplifies Scapino's
command of every situation.
In this scene Scapino convinces Geronte (Jonathan
' McMurty) that a number of the old man's enemies are
after him. Scapino tells Geronte to hide in a sack while he
gets rid of these villains. With Geronte in the metaphori-

cal bag, Scapino plays the parts of these enemies: a pirate,
an "Eastern type" and a commander of British troops.
The first two parts are easy for Scapino. He converses
with himself until the enemy decides to vent his anger by
hitting the sack with a long sausage. However, the British
officer needs troops.
No problem.
Resourceful Scapino gets the audience involved. We
are his troops. Groener executes this scene beautifully. He
is excellent at dominating the scene. On some occasions
his tendency to steal the show works against the produc
tion, but these moments are few and far between.
