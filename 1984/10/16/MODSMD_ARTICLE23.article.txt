# 'Scapino!': unrelated noises into harmony
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
Have you ever heard a number of unrelated noises
which seemed to come together in perfect harmony?
There is great satisfaction in hearing such unity in ran
domness. 1 found such satisfaction in seeing the produc
tion of "Scapino!" at the Stanford Theater.
Frank Dunlop and Jim Dale have created a modern
adaptation of Moliere's "Les Fourberies de Scapin."
Dunlop and Dale are faithful to Moliere's plot. Under the
direction of David Ogden Stiers, the Old Globe Theater
Company is faithful to Moliere's comic vision.
Set in modern Naples, "Scapino!" consists of a number
of improbable events which involve two youths, Ottavio
and Leandro, and their fathers, Argante and Geronte.
Both Ottavio and Leandro have fallen in love with women
who are unacceptable to their fathers, and they beg the
cunning and amiable Scapino to help them solve their
problems.
Scapino agrees, and what follows is a tortuous and often
incomprehensible plot. But the plot hardly matters. In
fact, this production minimizes its importance with such
clever techniques as the speed-telling of a plot summary
and the display of a sign reading "AUTHOR'S
MESSAGE" during one of the rare serious moments.
The beauty of "Scapino!" lies in its characters. Each
role is carefully crafted and holds great comic potential.
With very few exceptions, the actors of the Old Globe
Company succeed in tapping their parts for their essential
humor.
As these characters go off on their various tangents, it is
the task of Scapino (Harry Groener) to tie them all to
gether. Groener performs the task like a ringmaster. He
commands the stage with confidence and expertly controls

both the cast and the audience. Groener displays his abil
ity to take charge in a scene which exemplifies Scapino's
command of every situation.
In this scene Scapino convinces Geronte (Jonathan
' McMurty) that a number of the old man's enemies are
after him. Scapino tells Geronte to hide in a sack while he
gets rid of these villains. With Geronte in the metaphori-

cal bag, Scapino plays the parts of these enemies: a pirate,
an "Eastern type" and a commander of British troops.
The first two parts are easy for Scapino. He converses
with himself until the enemy decides to vent his anger by
hitting the sack with a long sausage. However, the British
officer needs troops.
No problem.
Resourceful Scapino gets the audience involved. We
are his troops. Groener executes this scene beautifully. He
is excellent at dominating the scene. On some occasions
his tendency to steal the show works against the produc
tion, but these moments are few and far between.


Nathan Haas, Harry Groener and Dennis Bailey play in "Scapino!", Stanford Theater's madcap farce
McMurty also gives an outstanding performance. His
whining graveness is especially funny within the context of
the other characters' silliness. Argante (Dakin Mathews)
is a wrathful, chubby capitalist. Mathews plays the role
with a passionate ego which becomes perfect prey for
Scapino's tricks and deceits.
Some of " Scapino!'s" most hilarious moments are pro
vided by Sylvestro (Don Sparks), who is Ottavio's friend
and guardian. Sparks plays the guardian with excellent
physical humor. He contorts his body in awkward ways
and has an air of naivete reminiscent of Ed Norton ("The

On a few occasions, the actors take liberties with
improvisations which detract from the play. But when
they remain within Stiers' parameters, they are always
on solid ground.

Honeymooners").
Dennis Bailey and Nathan Haas are dynamic as Ottavio
and Leandro. Bailey is especially clever in his parody of
the Italian youth's stereotypic passion for his woman and
fear of his father.

Dawn Didawick gives the production's weakest perfor
mance as Zerbinetta, Leandro's love. Zerbinetta is a
giddy gypsy who unwittingly ridicules Geronte by telling
him the story of his own humiliation. Didawick overdoes
it. Her laughter is annoying, when it should be infectious.

The costumes (Robert Morgan) and the scenery
(Douglas Schmidt) form a festive collage of pastels which
contributes to the production's circus atmosphere. David
Ogden Stiers has made this production greater than the
sum of its parts. He has added acrobatics and music, and
has manipulated Dunlop and Dale's script in clever and
often ingenious ways, while preserving the essence of
Moliere's wonderful characters. On a few occasions the
actors take liberties with improvisations which detract
from the play. But when they remain within Stiers'
parameters, they are always on solid ground.
"Scapino!" is truly high comedy. It is also a lot of fun.
We are fortunate to have such theater at our fingertips.
"Scapino!" will be at the Stanford Theater through
Nov. 4.
