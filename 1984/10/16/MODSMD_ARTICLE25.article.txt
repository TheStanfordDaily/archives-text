# 'Country' propagandists and inert
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
Does Jessica Lange think she's
giving a great performance in
"Country"? This extraordinarily
beautiful actress and comedian, who
may be the most exquisite camera
subject since Marilyn Monroe, who
can hold the screen simply by the
force of her gaze, who did splendid
work in "King Kong," "The
Postman Always Rings Twice,"
"Tootsie" and even in parts of
"Frances" (in a role that was nothing
but a series of hysterical fits), seems
frozen in the role of the farmer's wife
who won't give up her land. It's as if
the immense importance of the
picture, which she co-produced, so
overwhelmed her that all her actress'
instincts drained out of her; in the big
scenes, she can't think of anything to
do but speak through her tears.
When I read that Lange and her
lover, Sam Shepard, had undertaken
a film together, I anticipated a sexy
good time — after all, they must be
the most amazing looking couple
since Gable and Lombard. But this
entire picture has exactly one mo
ment that ailows them to transmit any
erotic energy; the rest of the time we
have to see them as the embodiment
of all rural virtues, as The People (in
the Steinbeckian sense), The Salt of
the Earth. Gil and Jewell Ivy (names
that stick in the craw) farm the "best
land in the world" — Blackhawk
County, lowa — but the failing eco
nomy obliges them to live on loans
from the government-run Farmers
Home Administration. Now the FHA
has decided that the Ivys and many of

their neighbors are bad credit risks,
so they demand immediate pay-off on
their loans, knowing that the only
possible route for these trapped farm
ers is foreclosure. But the govern
ment has underestimated the
resilience of Those Who Are Close to
the Soil. The situation has an adverse
effect on Gil for a while and threatens

Mostly the movie sells us the good
old-fashioned qualities it ascribes to its
hero and heroine, who may slip a bit
but can always be counted on to rally
because they're basically decent.. . .
But it also sells us the American
farmer, and that's an insult.

to break up his marriage, but Jewell,
whose land has been in her family for
more than a century and who gets her
obstinacy from her clear-eyed, good
hearted old dad (Wilford Brimley, of
course), rallies her neighbors and
protests the iniquities of the system
— so loudly and forcefully, the
picture leads us to believe, that a
judge finally outlaws the FHA's pres
sure tactics. ("Country" offers a
fairy-tale version of how protest
achieves results that makes "Norma

Bae" look like a documentary.)
The rural virtues the Ivys represent
include parental devotion (they have
two teenagers), piety (they attend
church regularly and say grace before
meals), neighborly concern, fairness
in all things and, above all, love for
the land. Lange, Shepard, the writer
(William D. Witliff) and the director

(Richard Pearce, whose earlier effort,
"Heartland," also made me choke)
work hard to earn their place in
heaven: They preach so long and
hard that they forget to supply any
drama — the movie is inert. Even the
photographer, David Walsh, par
ticipates in the propagandistic nature
of the enterprise by lighting the film
as if it were an altar. Mostly the
movie sells us the good old-fashioned
qualities it ascribes to its hero and
heroine, who may slip a bit (Gil gets

drunk and violent when he begins to
despair) but can always be counted
on to rally because they're basically
decent; this point of view is
sanctimonious and antiquated. But it
also sells us the American farmer,
and that's an insult — both to farm
ers, who presumably don't need
defending, and to us.
Pearce is a hopelessly enervated
director, but he isn't stupid; he
resorts to the shameless trick of intro
ducing a mentally handicapped boy,
the son of the Ivys' friends the
Brewers, as a symbol of the misery
these farmers have to bear. (The fact
that he's only a symbol is evidenced
by the way the movie disposes of him
without any follow-up explanation in
order to provoke his father's suicide.)
Pearce features this character in in
terminable close-ups, fingering his
guitar in the back of a pickup truck,
laughing in church, attacking the
FHA men who have come for his
daddy's sheep. (He may be damaged,
but he has an instinctual grasp of the
melancholy of the farmer's life; he's a
holy fool.) Last year Lynne Littman
made a mentally handicapped boy
one of the last survivors on earth in
"Testament"; she even had the cheek
to call him "Hiroshi." Witliff and
Pearce call their mascot "Cowboy,"
which is just as obnoxious and just as
unlikely — but then, "Country" isn't
the kind of movie you look to for auth
enticity. I saw this film with a friend
who grew up on a farm in lowa, and
at one point he muttered, "Life in
lowa resembles this about as much as
life in L.A. resembles 'Blade Run
ner.' "

work in "King Kong," "The
Postman Always Rings Twice,"
"Tootsie" and even in parts of
"Frances" (in a role that was nothing
but a series of hysterical fits), seems
frozen in the role of the farmer's wife
who won't give up her land. It's as if
the immense importance of the
picture, which she co-produced, so
overwhelmed her that all her actress'
instincts drained out of her; in the big
scenes, she can't think of anything to
do but speak through her tears.
When I read that Lange and her
lover, Sam Shepard, had undertaken
a film together, I anticipated a sexy
good time — after all, they must be
the most amazing looking couple
since Gable and Lombard. But this
entire picture has exactly one mo
ment that ailows them to transmit any
erotic energy; the rest of the time we
have to see them as the embodiment
of all rural virtues, as The People (in
the Steinbeckian sense), The Salt of
the Earth. Gil and Jewell Ivy (names
that stick in the craw) farm the "best
land in the world" — Blackhawk
County, lowa — but the failing eco
nomy obliges them to live on loans
from the government-run Farmers
Home Administration. Now the FHA
has decided that the Ivys and many of

their neighbors are bad credit risks,
so they demand immediate pay-off on
their loans, knowing that the only
possible route for these trapped farm
ers is foreclosure. But the govern
ment has underestimated the
resilience of Those Who Are Close to
the Soil. The situation has an adverse
effect on Gil for a while and threatens

Mostly the movie sells us the good
old-fashioned qualities it ascribes to its
hero and heroine, who may slip a bit
but can always be counted on to rally
because they're basically decent.. . .
But it also sells us the American
farmer, and that's an insult.

to break up his marriage, but Jewell,
whose land has been in her family for
more than a century and who gets her
obstinacy from her clear-eyed, good
hearted old dad (Wilford Brimley, of
course), rallies her neighbors and
protests the iniquities of the system
— so loudly and forcefully, the
picture leads us to believe, that a
judge finally outlaws the FHA's pres
sure tactics. ("Country" offers a
fairy-tale version of how protest
achieves results that makes "Norma

Bae" look like a documentary.)
The rural virtues the Ivys represent
include parental devotion (they have
two teenagers), piety (they attend
church regularly and say grace before
meals), neighborly concern, fairness
in all things and, above all, love for
the land. Lange, Shepard, the writer
(William D. Witliff) and the director

(Richard Pearce, whose earlier effort,
"Heartland," also made me choke)
work hard to earn their place in
heaven: They preach so long and
hard that they forget to supply any
drama — the movie is inert. Even the
photographer, David Walsh, par
ticipates in the propagandistic nature
of the enterprise by lighting the film
as if it were an altar. Mostly the
movie sells us the good old-fashioned
qualities it ascribes to its hero and
heroine, who may slip a bit (Gil gets

drunk and violent when he begins to
despair) but can always be counted
on to rally because they're basically
decent; this point of view is
sanctimonious and antiquated. But it
also sells us the American farmer,
and that's an insult — both to farm
ers, who presumably don't need
defending, and to us.
Pearce is a hopelessly enervated
director, but he isn't stupid; he
resorts to the shameless trick of intro
ducing a mentally handicapped boy,
the son of the Ivys' friends the
Brewers, as a symbol of the misery
these farmers have to bear. (The fact
that he's only a symbol is evidenced
by the way the movie disposes of him
without any follow-up explanation in
order to provoke his father's suicide.)
Pearce features this character in in
terminable close-ups, fingering his
guitar in the back of a pickup truck,
laughing in church, attacking the
FHA men who have come for his
daddy's sheep. (He may be damaged,
but he has an instinctual grasp of the
melancholy of the farmer's life; he's a
holy fool.) Last year Lynne Littman
made a mentally handicapped boy
one of the last survivors on earth in
"Testament"; she even had the cheek
to call him "Hiroshi." Witliff and
Pearce call their mascot "Cowboy,"
which is just as obnoxious and just as
unlikely — but then, "Country" isn't
the kind of movie you look to for auth
enticity. I saw this film with a friend
who grew up on a farm in lowa, and
at one point he muttered, "Life in
lowa resembles this about as much as
life in L.A. resembles 'Blade Run
ner.' "


Jessica Lange stars as Jewell Ivy in "Country."
Does Jessica Lange think she's
giving a great performance in
"Country"? This extraordinarily
beautiful actress and comedian, who
may be the most exquisite camera
subject since Marilyn Monroe, who
can hold the screen simply by the
force of her gaze, who did splendid
work in "King Kong," "The
Postman Always Rings Twice,"
"Tootsie" and even in parts of
"Frances" (in a role that was nothing
but a series of hysterical fits), seems
