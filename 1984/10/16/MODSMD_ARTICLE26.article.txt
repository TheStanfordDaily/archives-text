## Dave Dutcher Saturated with excitement 
### 
As a post-mortem to Stanford's
37-13 loss to Washington Satur
day, I can only offer this: 1 feel
sorry for the 18 percent of the
country, including the local mar
ket, that watched the Cardinal-
Huskies game on CBS and could
not watch the more exciting game
that was broadcast to the rest of
the nation.
I'm referring to the Illinois-
Ohio State game, which was an of
fensive shootout. Eighth-ranked
Ohio State defeated the Univer
sity of Illinois, 45-38, by scoring a
touchdown with 36 seconds
remaining. The victors had been
behind by 24 points at one
juncture in the game.
Fortunately for this TV market
and the rest of the so-called
saturated television audience, it
could turn its collective dial to
ABC and watch the top- and
third-ranked teams play. Again, a
game decided in the final seconds
— No. 1-ranked Texas got a late
field goal to tie Oklahoma, 15-15.
I like college football as much as
the next guy, and I don't think I
would have been "saturated" by
this past weekend's television
lineup.
I would've loved to watch Air
Force beat Notre Dame, 21-7.
After all, it's one of the few
chances remaining to see the Irish
coached by Gerry Faust.
The Missouri-Nebraska game
probably was interesting. People
are realizing the Cornhuskers
aren't invincible, and the Tigers
made it close, scoring 23 points
against Nebraska's highly-touted
defense and losing by 10.
Add this to the football menu: a
small event called the World Se
ries.
While all this exciting stuff was
going on, I and an estimated
44,500 others at Stanford Stadium
were watching Washington, with

the aid of Stanford's turnovers,
make its sales pitch for the top po
sition in the polls.
I wonder if the Huskies were
bored on Saturday. From what
some of them were saying after the
game, that might have been the
case. Or, if they weren't bored,
perhaps they enjoyed knowing
what Stanford's defense was going
to do against them.
"They pretty much showed
what we expected," Washington
quarterback Hugh Millen said.
"They play mostly basic stuff . . .
they didn't show anything we
hadn't seen."
According to Huskies defensive
back Vestee Jackson, Stanford
also looked telltale on offense.
"They came out and did the same
things we saw on film," Jackson
said.
Draw your own conclusions.

The University of California at
Berkeley wins this week's Consis
tency Award. The Bears defeated
A/izona State University, 19-14,
at Tempe, Ariz. Oct. 6. Then Cal
traveled to Corvallis, Ore. Satur
day and lost to Oregon State, 9-6.
The Bears thus became the
second conference squad to lose to
the Beavers since Joe Avezzano
became Oregon State's coach in
1980. The first? Stanford last
season, 31-18.

Washington State took its act to
the Rose Bowl Saturday and lost
to still-struggling UCLA, 27-24.
In this version of "Sleeping
Cougar," Washington State
trailed, 24-7. UCLA was saved
again by the foot of John Lee, who
kicked a field goal with time run
ning out to provide the margin of
victory.
By himself, Lee could be saving
the Bruins — and Coach Terry
Donahue.
