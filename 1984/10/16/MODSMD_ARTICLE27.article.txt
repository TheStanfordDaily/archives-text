# Hockey wins

The Stanford women's field hockey
team got an easy victory yesterday as
it defeated visiting Northern Illinois
University, 6-0.
Despite the ease of the victory,
Head Coach Onnie Killefer was not
completely pleased. "They weren't
particulary strong. We weren't either.
But we put together a more balanced
attack in the second half," she said.
Stanford not only dominated the
score but also the total shots on goals.
The Cardinal piled up 48 shots to
Northern Illinois' three. In the second
half, according to Killefer, "the team
as a whole got to the ball and moved
to their tempo, rather than allowing
the other team to do that."
The Cardinal was led by Patsy
Huntington, who had three goals, and
Ami Chitwood who had one goal and
two assists. Senior Jen Bleakley
missed her second game, but Killefer
said she might be ready to play by
Friday.
