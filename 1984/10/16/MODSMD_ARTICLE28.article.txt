# Soccer plays Sacramento

The Stanford women's soccer
team will try to improve it's 1-4
record today at Sacramento State.
According to Stanford Head Coach
Helen Keohane, Sacramento State
was a surprise team last year in the
Western region. This year, Keohane
admitted, "they are relatively un
known."

As a whole, Stanford has played in
a West Coast League that has become
much more competitive from top to
bottom. "Three or four years ago,
only one or two teams dominated,"
Keohane said. "Now everyone is
tough."
After today's match, the Cardinal
will prepare for a six-team invitational
at the University of Central Florida.
