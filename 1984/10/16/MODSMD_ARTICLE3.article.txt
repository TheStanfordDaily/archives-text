# Kennedy delays campus housing

### JEANNE COOPER Staff writer 
Stanford University President
Donald Kennedy delivered a "state
of the University" address to a
subdued Palo Alto City Council last
night. Kennedy and Vice Provost
Larry Crowley spoke briefly on a va
riety of Stanford development
related topics before responding to
the few questions posed by council
members.
Palo Alto Mayor Larry Klein intro
duced Kennedy's now-annual speech
as "one of our more pleasant
evenings each year." He continued
his conciliatory tone, saying, "We all
know the University has made this
city what it is, we're glad we're adja
cent to it, and wish it well, even when
it has bad football games like last Sat
urday."
Kennedy returned Klein's con
genial sentiments, expressing ap
preciation that the council had earlier
approved hospital modification and
the Sand Hill Road projects. "We
think they will be of conspicuous
value to Palo Alto and the surround
ing communities, although that may
not have sunk in everywhere yet,"
said Kennedy.
"We are also very satisfied with the
progress on the project at 1100
Welch Road," Kennedy said. The
council has already approved the ini
tial designs for the project, still in the
planning, which call for one 42-unit
and one 108-unit housing structure.
Kennedy described the 42-unit
building as an "op-tel" or "home-tel"
for persons needing constant out
patient care from the Stanford Medi
cal Center and their families. "[This]
will be a facility long sought by volun
teer agencies in this county," he
predicted.
The 108-unit building will house
faculty and staff members of the
medical center, particularly the young
professionals who most need to be
close to their work, said Kennedy.
Referring to earlier debates between
the council and the University, Ken
nedy said, "We believe this will lessen
rather than increase the burden on
city streets."
Klein's friendly comments marked
somewhat of a change in recent
University-city relations. Last fall,
the University shelved plans for Stan
ford West, a 46-acre, 1,100-unit
housing development on Sand Hill
Road, after the city attached condi
tions the University claimed were un
reasonable.
At that time, Palo Alto said Stan
ford's development of that land was
contingent on city approval of plans
for a separate 86-acre parcel across

the street. This land would normally
not be subject to city control.
The University and the city also
clashed on plans for the Sand Hill
Road extension for a number of years
before finally reaching an agreement
last month.
Vice Provost Crowley then
updated the council on the hospital
modification and children's hospital
projects, already under way. Crowley
said the University is in the process of
receiving and reviewing construction
bids for the hospital modification. Al
though preliminary site construction
has begun, Crowley said no comple
tion date has been set for the build
ing, and financing is still uncertain.
"The Hospital Board will consider
in November floating some six-month
tender bonds (for the project),"
Crowley said. If approved, the bonds
should go on sale before December.
Construction on the Children's HogDi
tal should begin by summer 1986,

said Crowley, but the date is not
fixed. Planning for the structure will
be completed next month.
Crowley said the University is
"closely following legislative and
regulatory changes" in medical care
financing, including the recent
proposals to reduce Medi
care/Medicaid benefits. "We're
particularly concerned about
Proposition 41," Crowley said.
The measure, if approved by Cali
fornia voters, will "not only cost
hospitals millions of dollars" but
could also "very well cause a very
serious deterioration in the health
care of the least fortunate members
of our society ," Crowley said.
Kennedy then briefed the council
on more controversial developments
of the University. Noting that Stan
ford has spent "considerable atten
tion and considerable amounts of
money" on a new environmental
safety center, he stressed that the
