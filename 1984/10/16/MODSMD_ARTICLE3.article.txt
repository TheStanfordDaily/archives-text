# Kennedy delays campus housing

### JEANNE COOPER Staff writer 
Stanford University President
Donald Kennedy delivered a "state
of the University" address to a
subdued Palo Alto City Council last
night. Kennedy and Vice Provost
Larry Crowley spoke briefly on a va
riety of Stanford development
related topics before responding to
the few questions posed by council
members.
Palo Alto Mayor Larry Klein intro
duced Kennedy's now-annual speech
as "one of our more pleasant
evenings each year." He continued
his conciliatory tone, saying, "We all
know the University has made this
city what it is, we're glad we're adja
cent to it, and wish it well, even when
it has bad football games like last Sat
urday."
Kennedy returned Klein's con
genial sentiments, expressing ap
preciation that the council had earlier
approved hospital modification and
the Sand Hill Road projects. "We
think they will be of conspicuous
value to Palo Alto and the surround
ing communities, although that may
not have sunk in everywhere yet,"
said Kennedy.
"We are also very satisfied with the
progress on the project at 1100
Welch Road," Kennedy said. The
council has already approved the ini
tial designs for the project, still in the
planning, which call for one 42-unit
and one 108-unit housing structure.
Kennedy described the 42-unit
building as an "op-tel" or "home-tel"
for persons needing constant out
patient care from the Stanford Medi
cal Center and their families. "[This]
will be a facility long sought by volun
teer agencies in this county," he
predicted.
The 108-unit building will house
faculty and staff members of the
medical center, particularly the young
professionals who most need to be
close to their work, said Kennedy.
Referring to earlier debates between
the council and the University, Ken
nedy said, "We believe this will lessen
rather than increase the burden on
city streets."
Klein's friendly comments marked
somewhat of a change in recent
University-city relations. Last fall,
the University shelved plans for Stan
ford West, a 46-acre, 1,100-unit
housing development on Sand Hill
Road, after the city attached condi
tions the University claimed were un
reasonable.
At that time, Palo Alto said Stan
ford's development of that land was
contingent on city approval of plans
for a separate 86-acre parcel across

the street. This land would normally
not be subject to city control.
The University and the city also
clashed on plans for the Sand Hill
Road extension for a number of years
before finally reaching an agreement
last month.
Vice Provost Crowley then
updated the council on the hospital
modification and children's hospital
projects, already under way. Crowley
said the University is in the process of
receiving and reviewing construction
bids for the hospital modification. Al
though preliminary site construction
has begun, Crowley said no comple
tion date has been set for the build
ing, and financing is still uncertain.
"The Hospital Board will consider
in November floating some six-month
tender bonds (for the project),"
Crowley said. If approved, the bonds
should go on sale before December.
Construction on the Children's HogDi
tal should begin by summer 1986,

said Crowley, but the date is not
fixed. Planning for the structure will
be completed next month.
Crowley said the University is
"closely following legislative and
regulatory changes" in medical care
financing, including the recent
proposals to reduce Medi
care/Medicaid benefits. "We're
particularly concerned about
Proposition 41," Crowley said.
The measure, if approved by Cali
fornia voters, will "not only cost
hospitals millions of dollars" but
could also "very well cause a very
serious deterioration in the health
care of the least fortunate members
of our society ," Crowley said.
Kennedy then briefed the council
on more controversial developments
of the University. Noting that Stan
ford has spent "considerable atten
tion and considerable amounts of
money" on a new environmental
safety center, he stressed that the

chemical treatment plant is
"absolutely essential if we are to con
tinue the kinds of investigation and
kinds of treatment we do at Stanford
Hospital."
Kennedy said the center will both
deal with chemical wastes on site and
offer self-contained storage and
packing of wastes. The University
wanted to locate the center "as close
as possible to the source" of wastes,
said Kennedy, in order to "minimize
risks to everyone by least transporta
tion." He remarked that most com
munities do not take this precaution.
On the rejected Stanford West de
velopment proposal, Kennedy said,
"We've danced one long dance over
this already, and we're going to try to
bring back something you like a little
better." Acknowledging that the city
also recognizes the need for addi
tional housing, he said the University
will present a new proposal "as soon
as we can after beginning the 1100
Welch Road project." Kennedy ex
plained that the Welch Road project

has "tied up the same resources" that
Stanford West needs.
When Councilmember Michael
Cobb questioned Kennedy later, the
president said he had hoped to
deliver a revised Stanford West pro
posal to the council before the end of
the year, but he was "very reluctant
to promise that now." Kennedy now
projects "very early 85 at the latest"
for bringing the plans back.
Kennedy reported that the site
committee for the controversial
Reagan library has nearly completed
its work and will soon present several
sites to the University. The final ap
proval for the site will come from the
presidential library foundation,
"pending other jurisdiction's ap
provals, depending where it's lo
cated," said Kennedy, in reference to
the various authorities which control
Stanford land use according to its ge
ography.
Kennedy emphasized the Univer
sity's sensitivity to local interests,
saying, "We have told the site com
mittee that the communities here are
concerned with planned land use."
Earlier in the meeting, two Palo Alto
citizens had complained to the coun
cil that the city's Architectural

Review Board, which must approve
all development, does not adequately
consider the environmental effects of
proposed construction.
Turning to University growth in
general, Kennedy said that reduced
government funding for capital sup
port of basic research facilities and a
new generation of academic ques
tions have forced the university to in
crease its scholastic-oriented
structures. "Much of what we build
will be newer and more attractive
buildings on old footprints," he said.
The council had few questions for
either of the University officials. Vice
Mayor Leland Levy quizzed Kennedy
on the Reagan library's possible em
ployment level and on overall em
ployment and enrollment growth at
Stanford. Commenting that "whether
this will be a one- or two-term (U.S.)
presidency will have an impact on the
size of the archives," Kennedy an
swered that he does not expect total
enrollment to vary much from the
current level of 12,500-13,500.
"That doesn't give you any guaran
tee over employment," he cautioned,
however.
