# Davis must fill scoring void
## Practice opens for basketball 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Maples Pavilion is less than 1,000 seats from
being sold out for the 1983-84 basketball season,
indicating that Director of Marketing Jim Colton
and his staff have all but finished their job.
Now men's basketball Coach Tom Davis and his
staff start their job — to keep the fans coming back.
Fall practice officially began yesterday afternoon.
But Davis will have a harder time this season en
couraging fans to use their season tickets than he
did last. Although Stanford, which finished with a
19-12 record, is coming off its first winning season
in 11 years, it is also facing the grizzly prospect of
playing the 1983-84 season without last year's top
three scorers.
Guard Keith Jones and center John Revelli both
walked in graduation ceremonies last June and
senior team captain Steve Brown sustained a stress
fracture that will keep him walking — and not run
ning — for the entire season. Another forward, 6-
foot-7 Hans Wichary, has decided to forego his
final year of eligibility.
Jones, Revelli, Brown and Wichary accounted
for 70.3 percent of the Cardinal's offense last year,
averaging a combined 52.4 of the team's 74.5
points per game. Revelli and Jones finished their
careers ranked second and fourth, respectively, on
the all-time Stanford men's basketball scoring list.
That makes 6-5 junior forward Earl Koberlein,
who averaged 6.1 points and 4.4 rebounds per con
test last season, Stanford's leading returning scorer
and rebounder.

"I don't see myself as the leading scorer (this
season)" Koberlein said yesterday at a team press
conference. "But I do see myself as having to pick
up some of the slack. It's a team thing — everyone
will have to help out. But I will be looking to shoot
more."
Besides Koberlein, Davis will be relying on
junior point guard Keith Ramee and junior for
ward Andy Fisher for their experience on a team
that has only four two-time lettermen. Davis is also
hoping sophomore quarterback John Paye will play
basketball when football season is over, something
he did last year quite successfully.
''My whole philosophy is not to treat it as a
building year," said Davis, who has never suffered
a losing season as a head coach, "but just to go out
and do as well as we can.
"Not everybody can shoot, not everybody can
rebound, not everybody can play good defense," he
continued. "But somewhere in there you find a
blend. And in this particular year with so many
young guys, it's really critical that I do that well. I
have to be sure to get the most out of the talent we
have."
A good deal of that talent is in the freshman
class. Greg Butler, whose brother Dave plays bas
ketball at the University of California at Berkeley,
and Eric Reveno, who played with John Paye on
Menlo School's California state championship team
in 1982, are the two who may see the most action.
Davis likes to bring his freshmen along slowly
and give them ample time to adjust to the rigors of
college life, but he said both the 6-11, 230-pound

Butler and the 6-8, 245-pound Reveno will figure
in the Cardinal's fortunes this season.
"They will play," he said. "I don't see how you
can keep them out of the first eight or nine guys. 1
think these two kids are the hardest working guys
on the team."
Davis' third freshman recruit is 6-2 guard Scott
Meinert, whose quickness and deadly outside shot
could come in handy in the Cardinal backcourt.
Speedy sophomore Novian Whitsitt and junior
John Williams will battle with Meinert for the
shooting guard position.
Perhaps Davis' biggest obstacle will be his Pacific
10 Conference schedule. "This is by far the best
Pac-10 in the last few years," said Davis, whose
Cardinal is picked to finish ninth in the Pac-10
coaches poll. "I think if the league is as strong as I
think it will be, we could play very well and still be
stuck in the bottom five of the league."
But the way season tickets have been selling,
you'd never know Stanford is facing such a tough
challenge.
"We are within 61 season tickets of selling as
many season tickets as we did last season," Colton
said. "And all this is without a push to the outside
public. In the next few weeks we will try to sell out
Maples Pavilion to the general public."
Nearly 3,500 season tickets were sold to students
last year and according to Steve Odell, the director
of marketing for Stanford basketball, that number
could be surpassed this year. Odell said 2,800 stu
dent season tickcts have already been sold this year
without yet pushing sales at dormitory meetings.

Stanford Head Coach Tom Davis will have to replace more than 70
percent of last year's scoring. Most Pacific 10 Conference coaches
have doubts about his ability to do that and predict that the Cardinal
will finish ninth in the conference.
