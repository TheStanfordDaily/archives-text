# Week of Oct. 8-15
## Police Blotter 
### 
The week of Oct. 8-15 saw a 40 percent decrease in bicycle thefts over
the previous week. Six owners found their bikes gone last week, with
most thefts reported over the weekend. It should be noted that details
for all weekend crimes were unavailable from the Stanford Police De
partment at press time.
Cyclists also had an easier time riding around campus; only one colli
sion involving a bicycle was reported last week. Car drivers had no such
luck, though, as six accidents befell the four-wheeled vehicles. Mohamed
Fathipour rear-ended one victim on Oct. 12 while driving on Palm Drive
but refused to identify himself to the victim and drove away. Police, who
later caught up with him, did not release additional information on Fat
hipour.
Burglars again focused on appliances and personal property over the
week. An unknown party entered a residence on 521 Campus Drive on
Oct. 9 around noon to remove a dweller's wallet, while on Oct. 10 per
sonal property was taken from a Synergy room in the morning.
Sometime during the night of Oct. 10-11, a burglar or burglars
absconded with a television set from ATO. They may have struck later
in the pre-dawn hours of Oct. 11 at Lambda Nu; occupants reported
their oven was taken between 2 and 7 a.m.
Automobiles on campus were not inviolate to prying hands last week,
although the number of reported vehicle burglaries and attempts was
down overall from the week before. The driver of a car parked near
Lasuen Street and Campus Drive discovered that someone had stolen
the radio from the dashboard on Oct. 9 between 9:45 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
An unsuccessful attempt on a different auto had been made on Oct. 7,
when a burglar tampered with the dashboard of a vehicle in Escondido
Village.
The single case of grand theft, in which the property taken is worth
$400 or more, occurred in the Coffee House on Oct. 8. Between 10 and
11 p.m., a victim fell prey to a light-fingered criminal who managed to
lift her jewelry and her wallet from her purse. Another student lost a less
er amount when a thief took the wallet from his backpack in Green Li
brary between 8 and 10 p.m. on Oct. 8. A white male juvenile contrib
uted to the total of five petty theft incidents when he attempted to
shoplift some items from the Campus Bookstore on Oct. 11 around 5
p.m. A store employee spotted the youth. Later that evening someone
stole personal belongings which were hanging on a clothesline near an
Escondido Village resident's apartment.
The Stanford police made a total of 11 arrests last week, two on felony
and nine on misdemeanor charges. Two people were stopped for driving
under the influence over the weekend, while Madeline Gurnee of Palo
Alto went to Elmwood Jail after police charged her with being drunk in
public in Escondido Mall about 10 p.m. on Oct. 9.
