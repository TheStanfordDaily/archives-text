# Zschau, Carnoy clash

### TODD RAMMING 
Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Sunnyvale) and Democratic chal
lenger Martin Carnoy locked horns last night at Bishop
Auditorium, clashing over the format for a U.S. industrial
policy while agreeing over the urgent need to reduce the
overwhelming federal deficit.
The meeting, one of ten scheduled between the two
candidates prior to the Nov. 6 election, focused on the
topic of "Industrial Policy and U.S. Competitiveness."
More than 100 persons gathered to watch the intense, but
structured, two-hour debate.
Although the candidates shared surprisingly similar
wiews on a variety of topics, Zschau and Carnoy became
vehement opponents on the question of the government's
role in stimulating the economy.
Zschau, who recently served as chairman of the Con
gressional Task Force on High Technology Initiatives,
stressed the need for the private sector to rejuvenate the
economy through research and innovation in both high
tech and traditional smokestack industry.
Carnoy, a Stanford education professor, fiercely
rebutted by claiming that Zschau and the Republicans
"talk about supply-side economics but give us perverse
Keynesianism." While agreeing that innovation is neces
sary in certain industries, Carnoy stressed that cuts in
skyrocketing health costs, farm subsidies and military
spending would form the basis for continued economic
recovery.
The differing philosophies of the two candidates came
to a head on the topic of accelerated depreciation, a tax
credit that allows corporations substantial deductions for
capital losses. Carnoy said that this "loophole" went into
effect during a period of high inflation and that it no
longer applies to today's business world where inflation
remains around 4 percent.
Carnoy also ridiculed the tax credit as an aid for capital
intensive rather than labor-intensive industry. Zschau,

however, maintained that basic manufacturing companies
require the accelerated depreciation credit to permit them
to risk more capital in research and development.
Zschau and Carnoy also butted heads over the issue of
unemployment in a technological age. Carnoy expressed
his fear that automation, although it very well might boost
the American competitive edge, would also displace the
common laborer from the work force.
Carnoy proposed that a committee be formed to cope
with, though certainly not prevent, innovation and
automation. Zschau, on the other hand, claimed that, ac
cording to history, innovation moves the common worker
not out of the work force but rather into a new and more
productive job.
To aid workers during the transition out of simple labor
into more skilled work, Zschau proposed the creation of
government-sponsored retraining programs and the es
tablishment of tax-free-accounts, similar to IRAs, to give
the workers a source of money during the transition per
iod. Maintained Zschau, "We should be exploiting change
rather than fighting it."
In other areas, the candidates shared surprisingly
similar, though certainly not identical, views. Both Zschau
and Carnoy stressed the grave importance of reducing the
national deficit, which is estimated at $175 billion for this
fiscal year.
In his opening remarks, Zschau termed the deficit an
"urgent problem," while Carnoy asserted that '"we must
face deficits squarely" to avoid "passing down an enor
mous debt to our children."
Both candidates based their plans for reducing the defi
cit on a cutback in military spending. Zschau proposed
that Congress limit spending by the Department of
Defense at 5 percent above the previous year's total.
