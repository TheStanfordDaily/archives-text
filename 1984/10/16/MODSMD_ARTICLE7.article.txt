Three Europeans awarded Nobel
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The 1984 Nobel Prize in medicine was
awarded yesterday to three Europeans whose studies pioneered modern
understanding of the body's immune system and paved the way for a
promising array of practical applications across all areas of medicine,
from AIDS detection to cancer treatment.
Stockholm's Karolinska Institute honored Niels Jerne, 72, a British
born Dane who has worked in Switzerland, as the "leading theoretician
in immunology during the past 30 years."
He will share the $193,000 prize equally with Georges Koehler, 38, a
West German scientist, and Cesar Milstein, 57, an Argentine-born
British researcher, who were cited for discovery of a new technology for
manipulating antibodies that "represents one of the most important
methodological advances in biomedicine during the 19705."
In less than a decade, the production of so-called "monoclonal an
tibodies" has "opened up completely new fields for theoretical and ap
plied biomedical research and allows precise diagnosis and also treat
ment of disease," said the Karolinska committee that selected the win
ners.
It compared the importance of this new medical tool to the develop
ment in the 1970s of genetic-engineering technology, whose developers
have already been honored with several Nobel prizes.
Westmoreland receives support
NEW YORK — Walt Rostow, one of former President Lyndon
Johnson's closest advisers at the height of the Vietnam war, yesterday
denied an assertion by CBS that General William Westmoreland gave
the president "mostly good news" about Vietnam, leaving him unpre
pared for the communists' massive Tet Offensive in 1968.
Testifying on behalf of Westmoreland in his $120 million libel suit
against CBS Inc., Rostow said his memory of the substance and tone of a
crucial April 1967 session at the White House was different from the
version CBS broadcast in its 1982 documentary "The Uncounted
Enemy: A Vietnam Deception."
In the documentary charging a conspiracy by top military leaders to
suppress information about enemy strength from the president and the
public, CBS interviewer Mike Wallace said Westmoreland assured
Johnson that day that the Viet Cong's army had leveled off at 285,000
men and that the United States was "winning the war of attrition."
But on the stand Rostow, Johnson's special assistant and a member of
the National Security Council, said it was "not my recollection" that
Westmoreland made such a claim. Instead, he said Westmoreland —
commander of ground troops in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968 — told the
president he needed 200,000 more soldiers to end the war in two years.
Otherwise, Rostow said, the general predicted a five-year war in South
east Asia.
According to transcripts made available by CBS during the lunch
break yesterday, Westmoreland said in an unbroadcast segment of the
Wallace interview that he was "ordered" back from the front to brief the
president and that he told Johnson that enemy troop strength had
leveled off at 285,000.
Mondale pokes fun at Reagan
SAN FRANCISCO — Presidential candidate Walter Mondale poked
fun at President Reagan from St. Louis to San Francisco yesterday,
refering to him as a man ignorant of the facts in foreign affairs and as a
cynical politician on the environment.
At the airport here, he recalled reports that the president had thought
submarine-launched ballistic missiles could be recalled after they had
taken off.
"Now think about that for a minute," Mondale said. "You fire the
missiles. They come out of the submarine holes. They go through the
water. They go through the air for several thousand miles. And then you
decide you didn't want to fire them. So they stop. And then like a movie
rolling backwards, the missile backs up, goes down through the water
and back to the submarine holes."
It was six days before his scheduled foreign policy debate with
Reagan, and he was taunting the president in Reagan's home state.
Mondale has narrowed the gap in the California polls to under 10 points
— gaining 10 points since their first debate.
Earlier yesterday, there had been a blunt announcement of a change
in theme away from foreign policy. "This is national toxic dump day in
the Mondale-Ferraro campaign," said an aide as the Democratic
presidential candidate toured a radioactive toxic waste dump in the St.
Louis suburb of Weldon Spring.
All over America, including Babylon, where Rep. Tom Downey (D-
Amityville) and New York Attorney General Robert Abrams were
presiding, there were events pointing to the existence and lack of treat
ment of toxic waste dumps under the Republican president. At
Moravian College in Pennsylvania, vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro lashed into the Reagan administration for the "worst
environmental record since Sherman marched through Georgia."
Bush faces silent protest at (JSC
LOS ANGELES — About 40 students holding signs and wearing yel
low tape over their mouths silently demonstrated yesterday during a
speech by Vice President George Bush at the University of Southern
California. /
The protest was in contrast to noisy heckling that repeatedly inter
rupted former Vice President Walter Mondale when he spoke at the
private university on Sept. 18.
"We are silent demonstrators," said Clarence Espinoza. "This is a
peaceful demonstration, which was totally different than when Mondale
was here."
Signs held up by the students said "Choose Human Race over Nuclear
Race," "Grenada — a Shameful Invasion," and "Ferraro — Kick a
Little White Trash."
The latter was a spinoff from Bush's comment after last week's debate
with Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro that "we
tried to kick a little ass."
The protest group was orgnaized by Black Student Union President
Bernard Walker, who said the purpose was "to show another side of
USC youth — the real student."
University officials had roped off an area in front of the platform
where Bush was to speak on the steps of Doheny Library, and admitted
only those protesters who had been issued passes by student groups.
After the heckling of Mondale, there were allegations that Republican
campaign officials encouraged the heckling.
GOP officials said they supplied Reagan-Bush signs to students, but
an investigation by USC officials concluded the heckling was
"spontaneous."
Evidence of new star system found
PASADENA — A disk of solid material has been photographed
clearly for the first time around a large, luminous star in the southern
skies, and there are hints that planets either have formed or are forming
there, according to a Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist.
Richard Terrile of the laboratory and fellow astronomer Bradford
Smith of the University of Arizona believe that their work may be the
most persuasive evidence so far of a system of planets around a star
similar to our own solar system.
Terrile and Smith took the first visible images of the disk around Beta
Pictoris last spring, using a special electronic camera attached to a 100-
inch diameter telescope at Las Campanas, Chile. It took several months
of detailed study, including computerized enhancement of the faint
images, before Terrile and Smith could determine that a disk surrounds
the star like the ring of particles around the planet Saturn.
Prime rate cut raises stocks

water. They go through the air for several thousand miles. And then you
decide you didn't want to fire them. So they stop. And then like a movie
rolling backwards, the missile backs up, goes down through the water
and back to the submarine holes."
It was six days before his scheduled foreign policy debate with
Reagan, and he was taunting the president in Reagan's home state.
Mondale has narrowed the gap in the California polls to under 10 points
— gaining 10 points since their first debate.
Earlier yesterday, there had been a blunt announcement of a change
in theme away from foreign policy. "This is national toxic dump day in
the Mondale-Ferraro campaign," said an aide as the Democratic
presidential candidate toured a radioactive toxic waste dump in the St.
Louis suburb of Weldon Spring.
All over America, including Babylon, where Rep. Tom Downey (D-
Amityville) and New York Attorney General Robert Abrams were
presiding, there were events pointing to the existence and lack of treat
ment of toxic waste dumps under the Republican president. At
Moravian College in Pennsylvania, vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro lashed into the Reagan administration for the "worst
environmental record since Sherman marched through Georgia."
Bush faces silent protest at (JSC
LOS ANGELES — About 40 students holding signs and wearing yel
low tape over their mouths silently demonstrated yesterday during a
speech by Vice President George Bush at the University of Southern
California. /
The protest was in contrast to noisy heckling that repeatedly inter
rupted former Vice President Walter Mondale when he spoke at the
private university on Sept. 18.
"We are silent demonstrators," said Clarence Espinoza. "This is a
peaceful demonstration, which was totally different than when Mondale
was here."
Signs held up by the students said "Choose Human Race over Nuclear
Race," "Grenada — a Shameful Invasion," and "Ferraro — Kick a
Little White Trash."
The latter was a spinoff from Bush's comment after last week's debate
with Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro that "we
tried to kick a little ass."
The protest group was orgnaized by Black Student Union President
Bernard Walker, who said the purpose was "to show another side of
USC youth — the real student."
University officials had roped off an area in front of the platform
where Bush was to speak on the steps of Doheny Library, and admitted
only those protesters who had been issued passes by student groups.
After the heckling of Mondale, there were allegations that Republican
campaign officials encouraged the heckling.
GOP officials said they supplied Reagan-Bush signs to students, but
an investigation by USC officials concluded the heckling was
"spontaneous."
Evidence of new star system found
PASADENA — A disk of solid material has been photographed
clearly for the first time around a large, luminous star in the southern
skies, and there are hints that planets either have formed or are forming
there, according to a Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist.
Richard Terrile of the laboratory and fellow astronomer Bradford
Smith of the University of Arizona believe that their work may be the
most persuasive evidence so far of a system of planets around a star
similar to our own solar system.
Terrile and Smith took the first visible images of the disk around Beta
Pictoris last spring, using a special electronic camera attached to a 100-
inch diameter telescope at Las Campanas, Chile. It took several months
of detailed study, including computerized enhancement of the faint
images, before Terrile and Smith could determine that a disk surrounds
the star like the ring of particles around the planet Saturn.

Three Europeans awarded Nobel
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The 1984 Nobel Prize in medicine was
awarded yesterday to three Europeans whose studies pioneered modern
understanding of the body's immune system and paved the way for a
promising array of practical applications across all areas of medicine,
from AIDS detection to cancer treatment.
Stockholm's Karolinska Institute honored Niels Jerne, 72, a British
born Dane who has worked in Switzerland, as the "leading theoretician
in immunology during the past 30 years."
He will share the $193,000 prize equally with Georges Koehler, 38, a
West German scientist, and Cesar Milstein, 57, an Argentine-born
British researcher, who were cited for discovery of a new technology for
manipulating antibodies that "represents one of the most important
methodological advances in biomedicine during the 19705."
In less than a decade, the production of so-called "monoclonal an
tibodies" has "opened up completely new fields for theoretical and ap
plied biomedical research and allows precise diagnosis and also treat
ment of disease," said the Karolinska committee that selected the win
ners.
It compared the importance of this new medical tool to the develop
ment in the 1970s of genetic-engineering technology, whose developers
have already been honored with several Nobel prizes.
Westmoreland receives support
NEW YORK — Walt Rostow, one of former President Lyndon
Johnson's closest advisers at the height of the Vietnam war, yesterday
denied an assertion by CBS that General William Westmoreland gave
the president "mostly good news" about Vietnam, leaving him unpre
pared for the communists' massive Tet Offensive in 1968.
Testifying on behalf of Westmoreland in his $120 million libel suit
against CBS Inc., Rostow said his memory of the substance and tone of a
crucial April 1967 session at the White House was different from the
version CBS broadcast in its 1982 documentary "The Uncounted
Enemy: A Vietnam Deception."
In the documentary charging a conspiracy by top military leaders to
suppress information about enemy strength from the president and the
public, CBS interviewer Mike Wallace said Westmoreland assured
Johnson that day that the Viet Cong's army had leveled off at 285,000
men and that the United States was "winning the war of attrition."
But on the stand Rostow, Johnson's special assistant and a member of
the National Security Council, said it was "not my recollection" that
Westmoreland made such a claim. Instead, he said Westmoreland —
commander of ground troops in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968 — told the
president he needed 200,000 more soldiers to end the war in two years.
Otherwise, Rostow said, the general predicted a five-year war in South
east Asia.
According to transcripts made available by CBS during the lunch
break yesterday, Westmoreland said in an unbroadcast segment of the
Wallace interview that he was "ordered" back from the front to brief the
president and that he told Johnson that enemy troop strength had
leveled off at 285,000.
Mondale pokes fun at Reagan
SAN FRANCISCO — Presidential candidate Walter Mondale poked
fun at President Reagan from St. Louis to San Francisco yesterday,
refering to him as a man ignorant of the facts in foreign affairs and as a
cynical politician on the environment.
At the airport here, he recalled reports that the president had thought
submarine-launched ballistic missiles could be recalled after they had
taken off.
"Now think about that for a minute," Mondale said. "You fire the
missiles. They come out of the submarine holes. They go through the
water. They go through the air for several thousand miles. And then you
decide you didn't want to fire them. So they stop. And then like a movie
rolling backwards, the missile backs up, goes down through the water
