# Duarte meets rebel leaders

### 
LA PALMA, El Salvador — Government and
rebel leaders sat down together in a country church
yesterday to talk about ending El Salvador's war, a
historic first meeting after five years of bloodshed
and bitterness. They agreed to meet again in No
vember.
The initial, 65-hour session in this isolated
mountain town near the Honduran border
produced no major breakthroughs. President Jose
Napoleon Duarte called on the leftist guerrillas to
take part in Salvadoran elections. The rebels called
for social reforms and war-crimes trials.
Afterward, Duarte told an estimated 20,000 Sal
vadorans waiting outside, "It was not possible to
have a solution in just one meeting But we came
out of the church with a communique with hopes of
peace."
Rebel negotiator Guillermo Ungo called it"the
first stage of a process of talks, but there are many
steps to go."
In the joint communique read by Monsignor Ar
turo Rivera y Damas, the Roman Catholic arch
bishop of San Salvador, the negotiators agreed to
form a joint commission, made up of four members
from each side, to study the issues raised yesterday,
and to meet again in late November.
The crowd thronging the church plaza and sur
rounding streets knew it was an important moment
in their country's violent history. During the
closed-door talks, they cheered announcements by
the two sides and waved white flags and banners
declaring, "Paz y Democracia" — Peace and
Democracy.
In the United States, President Reagan called the
La Palma talks a "momentous event for peace in
Central America."
Although both sides had expressed concern

about security surrounding the talks, the meeting
took place without incident.
Duarte made his surprise offer for peace talks in
a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New
York on Oct. 8. The leaders of the rebel groups —
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 112 ront
(FMI.N) guerrillas and their political arm, the
Democratic Revolutionary Front (112 DR) quickly
accepted, saying Duarte's invitation was a response
to suggestions they made through Roman Catholic
Church intermediaries.
An estimated 59,000 people have been killed in
El Salvador in the past five years as the leftist guer
rillas struggled against U.S.-supported govern
ments moving slowly from rightist military domina
tion to democratic civilian control. Most of the
dead were civilians killed by right-wing death
squads. .
An hour after the closed-door talks began in this
town 50 miles north of San Salvador, the capital,
Duarte's seven pages of opening proposals were
outlined by government spokesmen on national
television and by loudspeaker to the La Palma
crowd.
The president offered a blanket amnesty to the
guerrillas if they accept the "democratic process,"
said he would propose legislative guarantees of the
rebels' right to political association and safety from
army reprisals, and proposed a joint commission of
six members from each side to plan further negotia
tions.
Duarte stopped short of calling for a cease-fire,
and apparently offered the guerrillas no protection
from underground right-wing death squads that
have been blamed for thousands of political mur
ders over the past five years.
The rebels then responded by circulating a docu

ment in La Palma containing their demands:
Cessation of military operations "against the ci
vilian population"; general wage increases f or
workers and peasants; the right to "life, dignity
health and education for all Salvadorans"; release
of rebel prisoners and an accounting of the missing
and justice for "criminals of war."
High-ranking members of the Salvadoran church
hierarchy acted as mediators and observers as rep
resentatives of the two sides met inside the I ;t
Palma church, whose bell tower was adorned with a
papier-mache white dove for the occasion.
With Duarte in the talks were Gen. Carlos
Eugenio Vides Casanova, the Salvadoran defense
minister; Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes, the presiden
tial chief of staff, and the two men chosen by the
National Assembly to succeed Duarte should he
die or be removed from office, Rene Fortm
Magana, a Democratic Action Party leader, and
Abraham Rodriguez, a leader of Duarte's Christian
Democrat Party.
The rebel delegation was led by Ruben Zamora
and Guillermo Ungo, the top political leaders of
the revolutionary movement. With them were one
of the movement's five military commanders
Eduardo Sancho Casteneda, known as Ferman
Cienfuegos; Facundo Guardado, a member of the
rebel military coalition's directorate, and Lidia
Diaz, described as an adviser.
Guardado was substituting for Joaquin Vil
lalobos, regarded as probably the most powerful
guerrilla commander. Rebel spokesman Alfredo
Zamora said Villalobos was in eastern El Salvador
and had been unable to get to the conference be
cause Duarte refused to provide a helicopter.
