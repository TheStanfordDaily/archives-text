# U.S. defers Israeli payment
## 
### 
JERUSALEM â€” The United
States has offered to defer for at least
three months $500 million in sched
uled Israeli debt repayments in order
to help the country through its eco
nomic crisis, Prime Minister Shimon
Peres reported to his Cabinet here
yesterday.
"In a way, it is equivalent to direct
aid in this sum," Cabinet secretary
Yossi Beilin told reporters of the pre
viously undisclosed American offer.
The proposal, which the govern
ment stressed was made by Washing
ton "on its own initiative," came to
light as Peres briefed the Israeli
Cabinet on his talks with Reagan ad
ministration officials in Washington
and New York last week.
It corresponded with a government
report that the ailing Israeli economy
posted a record 21.4 percent rise in

the cost of living last month. That
eclipsed the previous monthly high of
21.1 percent set in October 1983, and
meant that if such monthly rates con
tinued for a year, Israel's runaway in
flation rate would be more than 900
percent.
The proposal to defer even one
payment on Israel's $10 billion debt
to the United States was considered
particularly significant since Israeli
governments have long boasted that
they have always paid their debts on
time.
As recently as early this month, on
the eve of Peres' departure for the
United States, his top political ad
viser, Nimrod Novik told newsmen
that "the thought (of seeking suspen
sion of debt repayments) does not
even cross anybody's mind."
Yesterday's announcement said the

postponement would be until "the
beginning of next year, when (the
U.S.) Congress reconvenes," but did
not make clear if there were hopes
that the U.S. lawmakers might ap
prove any additional debt reschedul
ing at that time.
However, Israel radio reported
that the postponement will be only
temporary, meant to give the country
breathing space while Washington
weighed the possibility of forgiving
the $500 million entirely.
Briefing reporters after the Cabinet
meeting, Beilin stressed that the U.S.
offer was "not a question of forgiving
debts" and emphasized that most of
the money involved had been spent
on U.S. military equipment.
On another subject, a Cabinet
source said Peres had outlined to his
ministers a plan for a partial Israeli

withdrawal from southern Lebanon
that would not require Syrian agree
ment. The source stressed that the
idea was only one possible option at
this stage.
An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Is
raeli troops remain in Lebanon 28
months after they invaded the
country in June 1982 to drive
Palestine Liberation Organization
guerrillas out of the country. Peres'
new government, which took office a
month ago, has made withdrawal
from Lebanon a top priority, al
though officials have previously
stressed that they must have
Lebanese and Syrian guarantees of
the security of Israel's northern bor
der first.
