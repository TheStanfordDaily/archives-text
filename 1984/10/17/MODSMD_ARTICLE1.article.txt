# Fritz makes a splash at the Farm
## Crowd endures elements 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Inclement weather prevented much
of yesterday's throng of students,
University employees, and commu
nity folk from seeing Democratic
presidential candidate Walter
Mondale in action.
The Mondale rally, originally
scheduled to be held in White Plaza,
underwent a last-minute location
change that left at least a quarter of
the crowd standing in the rain outside
Memorial Auditorium for the dura
tion of the event.
The crowd outside got predictably
restless during the course of the wait,
and even thinned out at one point in
the afternoon. The remaining rain
bravers, however, responded warmly
to Mondale's address, and they
seemed afterward to place blame on
the event's organizers rather than on
the Mondale campaign itself.
It was at 11:15 a.m. that the shift
took place. A large crowd had
already gathered at White Plaza, and
when word spread that the location
was being changed, the throng surged
toward Memorial Auditorium.
Inside the auditorium, Secret Ser
vice agents and volunteers were
frantically scurrying about, attempt
ing to get everything in order before
the big crowd arrived. There were
already about 80 people who had
anticipated the move camped out
in the auditorium. A campaign offi
cial appeared on the stage, however,
and told them, "If you're not one of
the volunteers helping us, please
leave."
One of the campers was heard to
say, "Is it too late to volunteer?''
The Stanford Band arrived with the
crowd, playing such tunes as "Don't You
Worry 'Bout a Thing" and "Bitch." And
the long wait began, with people
crowding around the front of the
auditorium and extending all the way
back to the far end of Tanner Foun
tain. The side doors were open only
Mo press and VIPs, but others in
evitably seeped through.
When the wait stretched out for
over a half-hour, the crowd, many

A wet crowd waits impatiently in front of Memorial Auditorium yesterday. The auditorium quickly filled to
capacity and many disheartened fans left. Only the brave stayed to listen to presidential candidate Walter
Mondale's speech via a public address system. Please see more photos, page 3.
members of whom had come without
rain gear, grew restless. Chants of
"Losing votes! Losing votes!" arose
from people closest to the door,
who were so near to the event and yet
so far.
People seemed willing to wait,
however, and were more than patient
with the Mondale campaign itself.
"I'll still vote for Mondale," said one
sopping girl. A man next to her shot
back, "I won't vote for Stanford,

though."
Eventually, a voice came over the
P.A. system to say no more people
would be let in. A hiss arose from the
drenched crowd, and about half of it
filtered away. But the people who
remained gave Mondale a hearty
reception, chanting in response to his
"It just ain't so" litany and roaring at
his Reagan Library joke.
The organizers of the event said the
circumstances that left nearly a
thousand people outside the
auditorium were unavoidable.
Gary Cole, one of the five student
organizers of the rally, said there
wasn't anything that could have been

done about the situation. "You have
to do the best you can with what you
have," he said. "Ideally, it would
have been best to have the event
outside, but we finally decided that
some of the people should be inside
rather than everybody be miserable."
Cole added that Memorial
Auditorium was the original contin
gency location in case of rain. Maples
Pavilion was considered, he said, but
the Athletic Department already had
it booked.
"To wake up this morning and see
what we saw was terribly depressing,"
Cole said. Nevertheless, Cole termed
the rally an "absolute" success.
