## The 						Stanford Daily Right idea, wrong plan 
### 
A lot of candidates are saying they'll "give
peace a chance" for a few more votes, but rarely
does an underdog have the backbone to offer a
specific agenda at a decisive stage in a national
election.
It took guts for presidential hopeful Walter
Mondale to unveil his "Assembly for
Democracies" plan yesterday. That kind of lead
ership commands respect. But the plan, which
seeks to nurture and project democracy, prom
ises little and would accomplish even less.
Mondale's intentions are good, but as the candi
date says, "Good intentions are not enough."
Under the plan, Mondale would "call together
the leaders of the world's major democratic na
tions for a summit" to discuss "the difficult, but
essential, task of organizing an assembly for all
the world's democracies for the promotion of
democratic values."
In other words, U.S. leaders would take it upon
themselves to determine which nations are
democracies and, perhaps even more fatefully for
relations with our allies, which nations are major
democracies.
If Mondale tries to put his Big Stick selection

process aside, he opens the door to those spirited
"democratic" regimes in places like Turkey and
South Africa.
But in the final analysis, whether Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos captains a major or
minor democracy isn't really all that important.
The crux is whether a born-again League of Na
tions that excludes most of the nations of the
world would help bring the world closer together.
To expedite peace, you have to work within the
bulwark of statesmanship that holds the world to
gether. It's absolutely essential, as Mondale sug
gests, to support "democratic parties in non
democratic states," like Poland's Solidarity. But
at the same time, you have to deal with the real
power in Poland — a highly un-democratic gov
ernment with tanks and water cannons — if you
expect repression to come to an end.
Fritz's heart is in the right place, but we can't
"establish and perfect democracies" in an exclu
sive assembly where lending a "helping hand"
starts with hand-holding and ends with making a
fist without enough muscle to throw a punch.
