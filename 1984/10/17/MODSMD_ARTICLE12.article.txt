## Constitution merits celebration 
### 
Less than a decade ago, in the wake of
Watergate and Vietnam, America witnessed a
spontaneous outpouring of parades, flags, fife
and drum corps and tall ships on a scale that
would rival a current incumbent's television
commercials. The bicentennial of the Ameri
can Revolution did indeed provide a
welcomed respite in an uneasy time. It in
spired communities to band together in a col
lective celebration. It affixed a handful of
images in our national consciousness. Yet,
beyond such subjective impressions, it
represented an opportunity for thought,
reflection and genuine civic education that
was largely lost. In retrospect, such efforts
seem as perfunctory and fleeting as a
"bicentennial minute."
Less than three years from today, America
will have another — perhaps more appropri
ate — opportunity to engage in the kind of
unflinching self-assessment that brings
rejuvenation and renewal. Historians will
forever marvel at the curious chain of events
that severed the 13 colonies from the English
crown. What remains remarkable, however, is
not that a band of revolutionaries could over
throw colonial rule but rather that, after the
guns of war were silenced, these same individ
uals could set down a system of government
that would secure ordered liberty for nearly

-200 years.
The notion of a bicentennial of the United
States Constitution seems an obscure
curiousity perhaps because it does not lend it
self to visual imagery as readily as its
predecessor. It is more conceptual, more
philosophical; at least in the popular percep
tion, it should gain recognition primarily as a
topic for specialized legal symposia. Why
celebrate a tattered piece of parchment? It
fails to tell us anything about nuclear mag
netic resonance. It provides no insights into
the linguistic style of Joyce's "Ulysses." It
cannot help us manipulate complex data
structures.
One of the profound tragedies of higher
education — one particularly apparent in the
Stanford community — is the common as
sumption that the various academic disci
plines have nothing to say to one another. A
person need not endure three years of law
school to realize that the Constitution sets
forth the fundamental preconditions for the
pursuit of all academic endeavors. There
exists no inherent guarantee, divine or other
wise, that aspiring authors be allowed to read
"Ulysses" or that imaginative scientists be
permitted to explore the wonders of the
physical universe unencumbered by the state.
Amid the unprecedented material comfort
of this nation, most citizens may not realize

how deeply the constitutional structure per
meates American life. In an oft-quoted
remark, Alexis de Tocqueville observed:
"Hardly a question arises in the United States
that is not resolved sooner or later into a judi
cial question."
Not surprisingly, the provisions of the Con
stitution played an integral role in the recent
presidential debate. While the founders of
1787 established the right to vote, they did so
on the presumption of an informed citizenry,
one that possessed a basic understanding of
the words of the document and the
jurisprudence surrounding them.
Two contemporary issues raised in last
week's debate provide cases in point. Both
camps in the abortion controversy, for all
their rhetorical flair, fail to recognize that the
Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the
taking of life per se but rather the taking of
life without due process of law.
In a separate matter, the Constitution
rejects the "establishment of religion" but
also states that Congress shall make no law
"prohibiting the free exercise thereof." While
the Supreme Court has affirmed the so-called
"wall of separation" between church and
state, that same body has also recognized
wide latitude for "accommodation" with reli
gious groups. Many may be surprised to dis

cover that Justice William Douglas — hardly
an ideologue of the Moral Majority — wrote
in one such opinion of the Court: "We are a
religious people whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being. . . . When the
state encourages religious instruction or
cooperates with religious authorities by ad
justing the schedule of public events to sec
tarian needs, if follows the best of our
traditions."
Beyond the issues of the 1984 campaign,
the popular view of the Constitution reflects a
basic misconception of our quintessential po
litical document. As Alexander Hamilton em
phasized in "Federalist" 84, the framers did
not intend their work to be merely a recitation
of positive rights. Indeed, the original Consti
tution did not contain a bill of rights. The
freedoms set forth in the first 10 amendments
take on significance only as they relate to the
broader process envisioned by the document
as a whole. Above all, the Constitution estab
lishes an ongoing process within which the
moral judgements of society — regarding
liberty, justice and equality — may evolve. In
advance of any particular dispute, it seeks to
guarantee that certain means will be available
to all and that other means will be granted to
none.
While we may marvel at the durability of
the Constitution (with its mere 15 amend

ments since 1800), it would be illusory to
think that a set of words alone can secure
liberty. As comparative legal scholars would
note, many nations — most prominently, the
Soviet Union -r- possess written constitutions
but lack constitutionalism.
In the pursuit of its diverse interests, Amer
ican society — particularly academia — has
turned increasingly to legal institutions for the
preservation of our rich constitutional lore.
Perhaps due to strident assertions of exclusive
expertise by the legal profession, such a sur
render of control has come to pass. In
seeming anticipation of this uninterest, Judge
Learned Hand more than a generation ago
expressed his conviction "that a society so
riven that the spirit of moderation is gone, no
court can save; that in a society which evades
its responsibility by thrusting upon the courts
the nurture of that spirit, that spirit in the end
will perish."
The American Revolution Bicentennial
Commission began its work in 1967, nearly a
decade before the celebrations of 1976. With
"the other" bicentennial less than three years
away, an equivalent organization on the Con
stitution remains a mere vision.
