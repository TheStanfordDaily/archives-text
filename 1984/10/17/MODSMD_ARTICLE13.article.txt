## Vision of Residential Education lost 
### 
Once upon a time, long ago, longer than anyone
now seems able to remember, someone had a mag
nificent dream for unleashing energies of students
and faculty in an informal and relaxed setting.
It must have been spectacular, because pieces of
this vision exist sometimes in places like the theme
houses, Branner Hall and sporadically in other
campus residences.

VIEWPOINT

This was a vision not only of students and profes
sors attending pro forma cocktail hours or special
dinners, but of visits to the residences by renowned
speakers as well as people from all walks of life, not
otherwise likely to be seen on campus, of great
recitals and demonstrations, exhibits of history and
art, of workshops and seminars in topics ranging
from auto mechanics to Moroccan cooking, of field
trips to factories and courtrooms, ghettos and gar
dens, and of original displays of student talent in
every area possible trough projects inspired from
within the residence
This vision was call "residential education."
It isn't clear why th lea lost its sparkle, though
perhaps its time has y*. io come.
Probably through no fault of anyone, but just by
virtue of the way things happen, Stanford just
never has been able to get around to carrying out
that vision in any meaningful way.
Although Stanford has an Office of Residential
Education, its primary function is really not educa
tion at all.
To a faithful reader of this newspaper, it would
appear that the Office of Residential Education
spends most of its time devising means to control
alcohol consumption, regulate fraternities and co
ops, advise on academic programs and to protect
the buildings and grounds from damage.
This isn't a wholly unfair portrait. Much of the
work of Residential Education is really social con
trol â€” protecting facilities and fostering students'

physical and emotional well-being. Under the
rubric of Res Ed's activities, though not necessarily
originating within Res Ed, lie the duties of inform
ing students about police, fire and safety measures,
promoting awareness of psychological counseling
services and contraceptives, helping orient students
to the University, providing information about re
sources and programs, preventing discrimination,
upholding the fundamental standards of the Uni
versity and spotting individual problems before dis
aster strikes.
In this area. Res Ed has been a great success. It
has done an outstanding job of catering to student
needs and helping to make Stanford the very spe
cial, caring and supportive place that it is, which dis
tinguishes it from other great universities.
The problem is that any organization can be
asked to do too much, and with its advising and
counseling tasks alone, Res Ed already has a heavy
burden.
The solution is not just to patch up the existing
office. The problem is systemic and the only solu
tion is for the University to make a major commit
ment to residential education as an idea whose time
has come and which deserves a special priority, as
the University continues to follow the trend toward
decentralized education.
Here's why.
The problem with Res Ed is not its staff. The
bulk of Res Ed's staff is amazingly devoted and
talented. Yet even with a superhuman staff with
seemingly boundless energy and talent, it is difficult
to create very much intellectual programming in
the residences.
Compared to student counselors in other elite
schools, residential assistants (RAs) at Stanford are
underpaid and overworked. And even when suffici
ent interest and time permit the creation of intel
lectual programs, there is very little institutional
support available in either funds or experienced
leadership in this area.
Although resident fellows, generally faculty

members, can pave the way, those most dedicated
to the ideal of residential education feel shackled at
every turn.
Kennell Jackson, professor of history and resi
dent fellow in Branner, an inspirational figure in
the residences, has spent years trying to build his
vision of residential education into a reality. Yet it
is a constant frustration for devoted professors like
Jackson that there is neither enough funding nor
enough time for educational programs of any sig
nificant scope.
Frustrating, too, is that by design, Res Ed does
not make education its priority because the physi
cal and psychological well-being of students comes
first, as it should.
The solution, in a situation of conflicting
priorities, is to divide the organization in two. The
solution here appears to be to create a new Office
of Residential Education and to change the current
Office of Residential Education into the Office of
Residential Counseling and Advising.
Not only through organizational change, but also
by making funds available and by providing more
official recognition to speakers series, seminars and
special workshops in the residences, can the Uni
versity demonstrate its commitment to residential
education.
In addition, following the lead of some of the
theme houses in relying on both RAs and theme as
sistants, it would be wise to expand residence staff
to include both student residential counselors
(RAs) as well as student resident educators, to rep
resent the two different offices and to fulfill two
different but complementary roles.
Until then, though, Jackson and others like him
will have to remain out in the cold, building pro
grams on determination and shoestring budgets
alone.
