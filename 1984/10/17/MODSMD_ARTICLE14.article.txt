Worldly affairs
Western Culture is World Culture,
and it is becoming more so all the
time. The social sciences, the
humanities, the natural sciences, law,
medicine, education, business, engi
neering, all are Western although
they are part of World Culture and
although non-Westerners have made
great contributions. The "myth that
the Western world developed solely
from European roots" (The Daily,
Oct. 10) is not part of Western C ul
ture: Israel, Egypt and Babylonia are
among the "roots' of Western Cul
ture.
The notion that the culture and

history of women is not important is
equally alien to Western Culture; in
fact, the recognition of the role and
contribution of women, and
feminism itself, are Western. It is
true that people should know and
understand each other; this is a
Western idea and it is promoted by
Western Culture which has
developed the concepts of the brot
herhood of man and of universal
natural law.
Thus, we make a great effort to
teach World Culture. Why don't you
join us.

Space to think
Amid the usual barrage of jour
nalistic muscle-flexing and contro
versial editorials by embittered
students and pseudo-politicians, it
was a pleasure to read Wallin and
Work's upbeat review of Andy Sum
mers' and Robert Fripp's new
"Bewitched" album. Rarely have 1
seen such a favorable clipping
analyzing a work with which so many
people are unfamiliar. David Bowie,
Men Without Hats and who?
"Bewitched" has the ability to
transport listeners from the harried
pace of our 20th-century, high
octane society to an imaginary yet

vivid world almost devoid of prob
lems. The music induces a space to
think; it is as ignorable as it is lis
tenable.
So what, you say? "Why buy this
when I could get the new Duran
Duran album?" you protest. Because
this is stuff you won't hear on
KYUU.
More important things, you
respond? A presidential election?
Midterms? Heed a bit of advice for
election day and midterms week: (1)
cast your vote or take your test, (2)
put on your Walkman, (3) pop in
side two of "Bewitched" and (4) ride
the "Train" to distant lands. Enjoy!
