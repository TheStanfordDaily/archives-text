# Candidate calls Reagan 'confused'
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Democratic presidential candidate
Walter Mondale, invigorated by what
he called "the beginning of the
Mondale-Ferraro victory march,"
charged yesterday that President
Reagan is "out of touch with reality"
and "uninformed" and "confused"
on matters of foreign policy.
Speaking before an overflow crowd
of more than 2,000 people in
Memorial Auditorium, Mondale also
unveiled his plan for a summit
meeting of the leaders of the world's
major democratic nations.
Police estimated an additional
3,000 to 5,000 people stood in the
rain outside the auditorium and lis
tened to the 75-minute program on a
public address system. The steady
rain forced organizers to move
Mondale's appearance from White
Plaza just 30 minutes before the
scheduled start.
Mondale, in a rousing 20-minute
address, criticized Reagan's policies
in Central America, questioned his
commitment to arms negotiations and
lambasted his leadership, asserting
that the president has "a naive and
primitive notion of national
strength."
The appearance marked the begin
ning of a critical California campaign
swing in which Mondale must try to
wrestle control of his opponent's
home state. Yesterday's speech, com
ing three weeks before the election
and five days before the Reagan-
Mondale debate on national security
and foreign policy, laid the
groundwork for this effort.
Digging into Reagan for not being
"in touch and in charge," Mondale
assailed the president for confusing
the facts.
"Mr. President, if you want to
debate about making America strong,
if you want to debate on who's
confused and who's baffled, if you
want this campaign to turn on who's
out of touch with reality, you will
have that debate and it begins this
morning on the Stanford campus,"
Mondale said.
Responding to a buoyant crowd
waving flags, signs and pompons and
bursting into frequent chanting and
applause, Mondale asked the audi
ence, "Can I take you with me? I
think I could use you."

When supporters began cheering,
"Go, Fritz, go," Mondale smiled and
said firmly, "I'm planning to do just
that."
The former vice president said the
candidates' first debate last week in
Lousville, Ky., "stripped away the il
lusion that Ronald Reagan is govern
ing."
Quoting Will Rogers, as he did in
the debate, Mondale used the
humorist's words to ridicule Reagan's
"record of profound confusion."
"Mr. Reagan may know for sure
that he can recall a missile after it has
been launched, but it just ain't so. .. .
And Mr. President, you may think
you've won this election, but it just
ain't so," said Mondale, as an enthu
siastic crowd joined him in the
refrain.
Mondale's proposed Assembly for
Democracies, first introduced yester
day, is designed to promote demo
cratic values, support the develop-

ment of free institutions throughout
the world, encourage the struggle for
human rights, facilitate communica
tion among democracies and promote
economic and social development in
poor nations.
According to Mondale's plan, dem
ocratic parties in non-democratic
countries might also be invited to par
ticipate.
Mondale, appealing to the mostly
student audience, also stressed edu
cation, arms negotiations, the deficit
and the environment as major issues
of the campaign.
