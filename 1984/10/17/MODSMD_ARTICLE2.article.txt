# Candidate calls Reagan 'confused'
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Democratic presidential candidate
Walter Mondale, invigorated by what
he called "the beginning of the
Mondale-Ferraro victory march,"
charged yesterday that President
Reagan is "out of touch with reality"
and "uninformed" and "confused"
on matters of foreign policy.
Speaking before an overflow crowd
of more than 2,000 people in
Memorial Auditorium, Mondale also
unveiled his plan for a summit
meeting of the leaders of the world's
major democratic nations.
Police estimated an additional
3,000 to 5,000 people stood in the
rain outside the auditorium and lis
tened to the 75-minute program on a
public address system. The steady
rain forced organizers to move
Mondale's appearance from White
Plaza just 30 minutes before the
scheduled start.
Mondale, in a rousing 20-minute
address, criticized Reagan's policies
in Central America, questioned his
commitment to arms negotiations and
lambasted his leadership, asserting
that the president has "a naive and
primitive notion of national
strength."
The appearance marked the begin
ning of a critical California campaign
swing in which Mondale must try to
wrestle control of his opponent's
home state. Yesterday's speech, com
ing three weeks before the election
and five days before the Reagan-
Mondale debate on national security
and foreign policy, laid the
groundwork for this effort.
Digging into Reagan for not being
"in touch and in charge," Mondale
assailed the president for confusing
the facts.
"Mr. President, if you want to
debate about making America strong,
if you want to debate on who's
confused and who's baffled, if you
want this campaign to turn on who's
out of touch with reality, you will
have that debate and it begins this
morning on the Stanford campus,"
Mondale said.
Responding to a buoyant crowd
waving flags, signs and pompons and
bursting into frequent chanting and
applause, Mondale asked the audi
ence, "Can I take you with me? I
think I could use you."

When supporters began cheering,
"Go, Fritz, go," Mondale smiled and
said firmly, "I'm planning to do just
that."
The former vice president said the
candidates' first debate last week in
Lousville, Ky., "stripped away the il
lusion that Ronald Reagan is govern
ing."
Quoting Will Rogers, as he did in
the debate, Mondale used the
humorist's words to ridicule Reagan's
"record of profound confusion."
"Mr. Reagan may know for sure
that he can recall a missile after it has
been launched, but it just ain't so. .. .
And Mr. President, you may think
you've won this election, but it just
ain't so," said Mondale, as an enthu
siastic crowd joined him in the
refrain.
Mondale's proposed Assembly for
Democracies, first introduced yester
day, is designed to promote demo
cratic values, support the develop-

ment of free institutions throughout
the world, encourage the struggle for
human rights, facilitate communica
tion among democracies and promote
economic and social development in
poor nations.
According to Mondale's plan, dem
ocratic parties in non-democratic
countries might also be invited to par
ticipate.
Mondale, appealing to the mostly
student audience, also stressed edu
cation, arms negotiations, the deficit
and the environment as major issues
of the campaign.
He criticized Reagan's presidency


Walter Mondale
as one of style, not substance.
"Good intentions are no substitute
for discipline, and geniality no substi
tute for leadership," he said.
Speaking from a stage decorated
with American flags and a huge
"Stanford University Welcomes Fritz
Mondale" banner and framed by a
crescent of red, white and blue bal
loons overhead, Mondale said he was
"delighted to be back on the Stanford
campus.
"I understand this is where they're
going to build the Reagan Library,"
Mondale said amid a chorus of boos.
Quickly hushing the audience, he ex
plained, "No, you've got it all wrong.
People will come from all over the
world, because in that reference li
brary you will see facts you won't see
anywhere else."
After one of the more than 30 en
thusiastic crowd interruptions,
Mondale said, "I knew I'd get help if
I came here."
Mondale's speech, which began 50
minutes behind schedule, at 1:20
p.m., was preceded by an introduc
tion from Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.),
two songs from Steven Stills, short
speeches from Rep. Tom Lantos CD-
San Mateo), State Assemblyman
Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), Demo
cratic congressional candidate Martin
Carnoy and several student leaders,
selections from the Stanford
Band and a " Reaganbusters" mu
sical skit performed by members of
Students Against Reaganism.
Several of the speakers insisted the
Democrats would win in California
on Nov. 6.
"We're going to carry California
and we're going to carry the
country," Sher said. He said
Mondale's "presence here on
campus" is proof that the Democrats
never abandoned the state.
"Fritz Mondale day in and day out
is moving ahead," Lantos said. "He is
within striking distance nationally.
He is going to take California."
Hart, in his five-minute introduc
tion, said, "Three weeks from
tonight, with your help, we are going
to carry California."

Calling the election "a referendum
on the nation's future." Hart urged
his former supporters to embrace
Mondale.
"Ronald Reagan does not deserve
your support," Hart said. "Walter
Mondale does."
After the event, Eric Diesel, coord
inator of Stanford Students For
Mondale-Ferraro, said, "the audi
ence was unbelievably pro-Mondale.
"This is no longer Ronald Reagan
university," Diesel said. "This is Fritz
Mondale country."
Steve Dauber, president of Stan
ford College Republicans, said his
group was inadvertently split up
during the migration from White
Plaza to Memorial Auditorium, and
several spirited Republicans were
stuck outside when the building filled
up.

"It was just the circumstances of
the situation that made it impossible
to mount much of a demonstration,"
Dauber said. He had hoped for 100
Republicans to come out in support
of Reagan-Bush, but only 10 students
were able to get seats together in the
back of the balcony.
The appearance of the Stanford
Band ensured that the already-festive
atmosphere verged on frenzy. In ap
parent tribute to running mate Ger
aldine Ferraro, the band opened with
"She's Not There." Immediately before
Mondale's appearance. Band mem
bers belted out, "Don't You Worry
About a Thing."
KZSU-FM radio will rebroadcast
the program tomorrow at 7 p.m. Stu
dents For Mondale-Ferraro will proj
ect it on a movie screen Sunday at 5
p.m., followed by the second
presidential debate.
