Moscow hotline?
The Daily is not error-free, but some of the
headlines at other campus papers are rather
humorous. For example:
"Moscow phone calls may soon be tree.'"
No, Washington State University is not set
ting up a hotline to the Kremlin for its stu
dents. Free calls may soon be made to nearby
Moscow, Idaho, the Daily Evergreen reports.
In the incredibly-obvious category, a tie
between the Daily Evergreen and the Mon
tana State Exponent: The homecoming issue
of the Evergreen featured this headline:
"Alumni come home." The Exponent dis
played the following insight in a headline:
"Sex maintains popularity for most college
students."
"Stickwomen edge Syracuse," blared a
sports-page headline in Penn State's weekly
paper. What is a stickwomen? Didn't we
draw those during art in the third grade? It
turns out they're referring to the women's
field hockey team.

For years, Stanford students have mocked
the tendency of USC students to go through
more checks than texts in their collegiate
careers.
Whether that reputation is deserved or not,
a new board game developed by two USC
alums can only enhance that perception.
The game has two sets of cards similar to
the Community Chest and Chance cards in
Monopoly. Picking a card "usually results in
a gain or loss of money," writes the Daily
Trojan. Ideas for the cards reportedly
originated in the experiences of the game's
designers. Yep.
Players of the game begin with $6,000 in
credit and start the game by paying tuition on
their first move. The game's concept is
similar to Monopoly with USC landmarks
substituted for Monopoly's streets and
utilities.




A picture tells a thousand words. This Northwestern foible proves that The Daily isn t
the only paper that makes mistakes.
