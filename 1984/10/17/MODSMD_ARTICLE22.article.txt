# USC administrators in on the act

Picking on USC twice in one column is not
fair, but this cannot be passed up.
The Oct. 1 edition of the Trojan Daily in
cludes an article about USC's Student Ac
counts and Cashier's offices.
It turns out that the offices were combined
over the summer to "increase efficiency . . .
and provide faster service for students set
tling their fee bills," says the Daily Trojan.
That the university can collect its bills
faster doesn't seem so evil, but the Oct. 4
Daily Trojan also reports that "10 percent of
all full-time university students are still
waiting" for their financial aid entitlements.
The guys that set that system up should
play Trojan Challenge.
