## Cardinal adopts new image 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford football players don't eat
quiche. They're also not wimps or
spoiled children.
If you disagree, lodge all com
plaints with 6-foot-3, 231-pound
linebacker Dave Wyman. Or his 6-6,
253-pound brother, defensive
lineman Mike Wyman. Or 6-3, 275-
pound offensive tackle Jeff Deaton.
Or anyone else on the Cardinal foot
ball roster, for that matter.
Or, if you prefer, you can talk to
Stanford's opponents. Last week's
opponent. No. 1-ranked Washington,
is a fine example.
"They used to be a nice, easy
team," Husky running back Jacque
Robinson said after Saturday's 37-15
victory over Stanford. "But now
they're all aggressive and they talk
bad to me."
Deaton makes no denials. "You
can talk a little more when you're
winning," he said. "I just see us being
a lot more aggressive. There's talk
that the Wyman brothers are bringing
a new attitude of aggressiveness to
the defense.
"But Matt (Moran) and I, as long
as I can remember, have been getting
in people's faces and talking (on of
fense),' 1 Deaton continued. "But I
think this season we have our legs un
der us a little more."
Washington linebacker Tim
Meamber's post-game comments
echoed those of Robinson. "1 think
Jack Elway has come in here and
rekindled the fire," Meamber said. "1
think in the past they haven't been as
aggressive as the USCs or UCLAs"
of the Pacific 10 Conference.
The new "fire" Meamber speaks of
wasn't lit Saturday. In fact, Stanford
players brought the subject up at
their first press conference in August.
Dave Wyman was the first to strike
down what he called the "Stanford
image," and before the interview ses

sion was over, his teammates had
joined in.
All was relatively quiet on the
"Stanford image" front until last
week, when Dave's brother Mike
spoke out at a press conference the
Monday before the game against
Washington.
"People want to pin that thing on
Stanford — that we're not tough,"
Wyman said. "We were tough last
year, but the other team would win
the game and say, 'Well, Stanford's
just not physically tough.' I know
those guys couldn't go to sleep feeling
good about that."
Mike Wyman didn't stop there. "A
lot of people think that since some
Stanford students are rich, the foot

ball players are also all rich and grew
up in castles," he continued. "But
we're just football players that went
to public high schools like everyone
else."
And he didn't stop there, either.
"We're the same guys that play foot
ball at UCLA. It's just that we can
read."
True, the average Stanford football
player might be more academically
inclined than the average player at,
say, UCLA or USC. And, especially
during football season, that can
create a conflict of interest for some
Cardinal players.
But when Elway came to coach at
Stanford, he also came equipped with
a new priority system for his players.

Instead of deciding if athletics or
academics were No. 1, he made them
both No. 1.
So far his new attitude is working.
Stanford, with a 3-3 record, has
already won three times as many
games as it did last season, when it
was 1-10. More important, the Car
dinal has been winning with emotion.
Mike Wyman thinks such emotion
can have by-products on the field.
"Some people say you're lucky, but I
always say that you make your own
luck," he said. "We're making our
own breaks this year. A lot of it is at
titude. Sometimes that little bit of ex
tra effort can make the play."
Or the difference between 1-10
and 3-3.

wasn't lit Saturday. In fact, Stanford
players brought the subject up at
their first press conference in August.
Dave Wyman was the first to strike
down what he called the "Stanford
image," and before the interview ses

sion was over, his teammates had
joined in.
All was relatively quiet on the
"Stanford image" front until last
week, when Dave's brother Mike
spoke out at a press conference the
Monday before the game against
Washington.
"People want to pin that thing on
Stanford — that we're not tough,"
Wyman said. "We were tough last
year, but the other team would win
the game and say, 'Well, Stanford's
just not physically tough.' I know
those guys couldn't go to sleep feeling
good about that."
Mike Wyman didn't stop there. "A
lot of people think that since some
Stanford students are rich, the foot

ball players are also all rich and grew
up in castles," he continued. "But
we're just football players that went
to public high schools like everyone
else."
And he didn't stop there, either.
"We're the same guys that play foot
ball at UCLA. It's just that we can
read."
True, the average Stanford football
player might be more academically
inclined than the average player at,
say, UCLA or USC. And, especially
during football season, that can
create a conflict of interest for some
Cardinal players.
But when Elway came to coach at
Stanford, he also came equipped with
a new priority system for his players.

Instead of deciding if athletics or
academics were No. 1, he made them
both No. 1.
So far his new attitude is working.
Stanford, with a 3-3 record, has
already won three times as many
games as it did last season, when it
was 1-10. More important, the Car
dinal has been winning with emotion.
Mike Wyman thinks such emotion
can have by-products on the field.
"Some people say you're lucky, but I
always say that you make your own
luck," he said. "We're making our
own breaks this year. A lot of it is at
titude. Sometimes that little bit of ex
tra effort can make the play."
Or the difference between 1-10
and 3-3.

According to Stanford defensive tackle Mike Wyman, Cardinal football players are as tough as those at
UCLA — but the Stanford players can read.
