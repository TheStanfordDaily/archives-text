# Volleyball team to face '83 rival
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team takes on UCLA tonight
at 7:30, and a Cardinal victory
would best be described as sweet
revenge.
The Bruins, who finished
second nationally last season and
won the 19K3 Western Collegiate
Athletic Association champion
ship, beat the Cardinal in three
matches last year. All the matches
went five games, however, and
could have been won by the Car
dinal, said Stanford Asst. Coach
Don Shaw.
"In all of the three games we
(Stanford) held the lead at some
point — either two games to one,
or in the fifth game," Shaw said.
"That's incentive enough (to beat
UCLA). We could have won
league with those matches."
If the incentive of revenge isn't
enough, the Cardinal will have to
beat UCLA this season if it hopes
to win a National Collegiate Ath

letic Association championship. In
last week's Tachikara Coaches
poll, the Cardinal was ranked No.
2 in the nation, with UCLA No. 3
and USC No. 1.
The Bruins are led by outside
hitter Liz Masakayon. who "sets
the tone" for UCLA, according to
Shaw. "If she plays well, the rest
of the team follows," Shaw said.
"They set her a lot and she is a
great defensive player as well.
She's a take-charge type, and if
things get tight they'll almost al
ways go to her."
In order to beat UCLA, Shaw
said, "We are going to have to
play really well — to put it very
mildly."
Cardinal setter Deidra Dvorak
said, "We're really going to have
to be aggressive against UCLA.
We'll have to be a little less
hesitant and really want the ball.
. . . Passing will also be important.
If we have our passing down, it
makes it a lot easier to run our of
fense."
