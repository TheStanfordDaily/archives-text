# Stanford takes streak to UNLV
## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's soccer team travels to the
city of glitter to take on the nationally ranked
University of Nevada-Las Vegas Rebels tonight
in a non-conference match.
The Cardinal, 7-4-3 overall, has a two-game
win streak after shutout victories over St. Mary's
College Oct. 10 and United States International
University Oct. 13. The two shutouts lowered
goalkeeper Willy Burkhardt's goals-against
average to 1.29, placing him fourth among
Pacific Soccer Conference goalkeepers.
The Cardinal offense has increased its produc

tion as well, scoring seven goals in its past four
games. Giancarlo Ferruzzi, a senior striker, is
fifth in the FSC in scoring and leads Stanford
with four goals and eight assists, while Tom
Rafalovich and Rob West also have four goals
each.
But Stanford Head Coach Sam Koch cites im
proved defense for the Cardinal's past two vic
tories.
"We played well (against St. Mary's and
USIU)," Koch said. "The defense came together.
The whole defense has played well — Tom
Rafalovich and Tom McGannon — and Phil
Horvath has done a great job. Charlie Crane has

done a good job of stabilizing the back four."
Crane, a fifth-year senior who walked on as a
sophomore and earned a scholarship this season,
has drawn repeated praise from Koch for his
steady, unselfish play at right fullback.
UNLV, 7-2-2, was ranked 16th in the country
at the beginning of this season and is currently
ranked fifth in the West.
The Cardinal's new-found defensive strength
will be tested by two Rebel strikers. Robbie
Ryerson, who scored a goal in the Rebels' 2-0
victory over Stanford last season, has nine goals
and five assists this season. Gavin Spaulding, a
freshman from South Africa, has scored six goals.
