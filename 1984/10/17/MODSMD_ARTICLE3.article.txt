# Biz School garners fewer applicants
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN 
"Quality not quantity" may become the
Stanford Business School's new motto,
owing to a decline in master of business ad
ministration applications over the past few
years.
Applications for the class of 1986 are
down 11 percent from that of the previous
year. The 4,160 applicants to the most
recent class seem especially few in compar
ison with the peak 5,192 in 1981. The busi
ness school admits only 315 to 320 stu
dents to each class.
Kathleen Gwynn, director of business
school admissions, is concerned about the
downward trend of applications to the
business school, b i believes that the MBA
program has not suffered from the decline.
"We are certainly getting the best
quality of students," Gwynn said. "My

concern would be if we were not getting
the best applicants. I do not think that has
happened yet. We are still denying nine out
of 10 applications."
Gwynn said she does not believe the
drop in applications is a fluke — she ex
pects it will continue for another few years.
Her first explanation is demographic
changes throughout the country. As the
overall population decreases, the pool of
applications will decline as well.
Another reason she cited is that a lower
percent of the applications now come from
college seniors. She compared the entering
class of 1983, which had a pool composed
of 25 percent college seniors, to this year's
entering class, in which only 18.5 percent
were college seniors.
Gwynn said that today more seniors
desire work experience prior to applying to

business school than have in previous
years. Stanford Business School encour
ages full-time work experience and has ex
panded its recruiting program in the urban
workforce, while limiting its recruiting on
college campuses. The average age of an
incoming student to the business school is
currently 26.5 years. Ninety-three percent
have at least one year of full-time work ex
perience.
Gwynn said another cause of the drop in
applications over the last three years is a
growing sentiment that the MBA does not
guarantee success.
"We never said it was [a guarantee], but
people thought that it was. We have people
applying now who want an education that
is valuable in and of itself," she said.
An increase in fees to apply to the busi
ness school and to take the Graduate Man

agement Admission Test (GMAT) has dis
suaded other potential applicants.
"Our application fee has been $60 for
the last three years and other major
schools have comparable fees," Gwynn
said. "Where three to four years ago,
people might have applied to four or five
schools, application costs may now cause
them to be much more selective in where
they [apply]."
Stanford is not the only business school
losing applicants. There has been a
nationwide drop in the pool of applicants,
Gwynn said.
"Relative to others, we have done well,"
she said.
Applications at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley's business school have
dropped in 1984 from approximately
2,500 to 2,300 for a possible 700 spaces.
