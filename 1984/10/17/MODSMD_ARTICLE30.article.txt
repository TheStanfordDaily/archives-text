Stanford junior wins praise
Junior Darieck Scott has been get
ting a lot of praise lately for his work.
First he won the University's
Boothe Prize for his analysis of a
character in a D.H. Lawrence short
story — the best essay written in a
Freshman English class that quarter.
Then his paper on Nietzsche's
views of Christian ethics won the
coveted Craig Prize as one of the two
best essays in History 1-2-3. Then he
won the President's Award for over
all academic excellence in his fresh
man year.
This year, at the second annual
Sophomore Celebration, he turned
many heads — including those of
University President Donald Ken
nedy and Assoc. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Carolyn Lougee — with
a thoughtful speech to his peers about
avoiding the dreaded "sophomore
slump" through extracurricular activ
ities.
"I firmly believe that one of the
best things about Stanford is that
there are many bizarre and fascinat
ing personalities here. If you refuse to
close channels, if you remain open to
new things, there is no limit to the
number of great people you can meet
and the experiences you can gain
from them," he said.
"These personalities and experi
ences may provide welcome relief

from what might otherwise be a year
of discontent.
Disease prevention center
The Stanford Center for Research
in Disease Prevention has been
formed to reflect the expanded activi
ties of the Stanford Heart Disease
Prevention Program (SHDPP), an
nounced Medical Prof. John Far
quhar.
Farquhar, who has directed the
SHDPP since its inception 13 years
ago, said the move was prompted by
an evolution of the group's activities,
including an increasing public
recognition and new scientific
evidence that many of the risk factors
for heart disease affect other condi
tions as well.
"While the majority of our re
search still concerns cardiovascular
disease primarily, much of what we
do is applicable to cancer, alcoholism
and accidents," Farquhar said in a
Sept. 17 memo to colleagues. The
SHDPP will retain its name and activ
ities as a component of the new ex
panded center, he said.
Professor wins fellowship
English Prof. John Felstiner has
been awarded a $16,000 fellowship
from the National Endowment for
the Arts for translation of creative
literature.

Felstiner was honored for his trans
lation from German of the poetry of
Paul Celan, a Rumanian-born,
German-speaking survivor of the
Holocaust.
The fellowships are awarded to
published translators of creative
literature to enable them to set aside
time for specific translation projects.
Head chosen for medical program
Nobel Prize winning biochemist
Paul Berg has been appointed direc
tor of Stanford Medical School's
proposed Center for Molecular and
Genetic Medicine (CMGM).
Vice President for Medical Affairs
Lawrence Crowley said Berg will
oversee the further development of
CMGM's academic program and the
design and fund-raising efforts for the
building that will house the faculty re
search.
The field of molecular and genetic
medicine promises dramatic changes
for medicine in the future, Crowley
predicted.
He said he and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy believe that "a
strong program with emphasis on the
continued discovery of new biomedi
cal knowledge and its transfer into
clinical applications and the
amelioration of human misery is criti
cally important for the future of Stan
ford Medical School."
