# Alarcon charges dismissed
## 
### 
A Stanford graduate student was cleared of sex- and
drug-related charges yesterday at a hearing in San
Francisco.
Last month, San Francisco police charged Francisco
Alarcon, a graduate student in Spanish and Por
tuguese, with two counts of oral copulation with
minors and additional counts of providing marijuana to
minors. Police said they discovered the alleged crimes
during the course of an investigation into the stabbing
death of Ted Gomez, a 15-year-old runaway from
Alameda, whose body was found last month in Golden
Gate Park.
Alarcon, 30, turned himself in to police on Sept. 27
after police issued an all-points bulletin for his arrest,
based both on the sex and drug charges and their desire
to question him about the Gomez murder.
Homocide Investigator James Crowley said yester
day that "more investigation will be done" on the
Gomez case, but that "pending a witness, all charges
were dismissed" against Alarcon.
Alarcon's attorney, Tony Tamburello, said he s
believes the Gomez case no longer involves his client.
"Police always say it's still under investigation,"
Tamburello said. "It doesn't appear to be ongoing."
"It's been a long, agonizing ordeal," Tamburello
said in response to a question concerning Alarcon's re
action to the dismissal of charges. "He has a sense of
outrage."
