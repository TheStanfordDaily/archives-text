B-52 crashes in Arizona desert
K.AYENTA, Ariz. — An unarmed B-52 bomber on a low-level train
ing flight crashed last night in Monument Valley with seven people on
board, authorities said. Officials said there were at least some survivors,
but bad weather was hampering rescue efforts.
Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Anthony Baca said
the plane, based at Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Wash., ap
parently crashed into the side of a mesa around 8:15 p.m.
"As tar as we know there were seven souls on board," said Major
John Higginbotham at Fairchild. "There were survivors, but details
other than that were unavailable." He called it a "routine training mis
sion."
Iribal police from the Kayenta station said they could see survivors,
but said no one had been able to reach the scene immediately.
Becky Castillo, a DPS dispatcher, said a helicopter was flying in to
pick up survivors.
Storms hampered search efforts in the rugged Navajo Reservation ter
ritory in northeastern Arizona, authorities said.
A Strategic Air Command statement released in Omaha, Neb., said
the plane was from the 92nd bomb wing and "was on a routine, low-level
training mission."
An Air Force spokesperson said the plane was not carrying any nu
clear weapons.
Duarte, rebels say talks successful
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Both President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and his rebel opponents have assessed Monday's historic peace
talks as a success, but statements made Monday night and yesterday by
each side indicated that their positions on how to end the five-year-old
civil war remain far apart.
Spokesmen for each delegation said yesterday that neither of the two
most divisive issues between them had come up during the talks in the
northern town of La Palma.
One was the insistence by the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti Na
tional Liberation Front and its political ally the Democratic Revolution
ary Front, that they be allowed initially to share power in the govern
ment without participating in elections.
The other was Duarte's insistence that no serious negotiations can
take place until the guerrillas lay down their arms.
Most of the public statements so far have been positive. Both sides in
terpreted the decision made at the meeting to set up a joint committee to
hold a round of further peace talks beginning next month as an impor
tant step toward ending the war.
Although yesterday in Washington the Reagan administration ex
pressed more public enthusiasm over Duarte's peace talks with leftist
rebels, officials warned privately that the negotiations were unlikely to
end El Salvador's civil war soon.
Bush defends 'shame' remark
LOS ANGELES— Vice President George Bush brought photocopies
of dictionary pages to a news conference podium yesterday to try again
to end the controversy over his debate remark about "shame" and U.S.
deaths in Beirut.
Humiliation is a lot like shame, he asserted, and therefore to say that
the United States was humiliated in Lebanon, as the Democrats have
done, is to suggest that American servicemen died there in shame.
Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale a short time later
rejected Bush's contention as "a lame excuse" and again vehemently
denied that either he or his running mate. New York Rep. Geraldine
Ferraro, ever suggested that U.S. Marines "died in shame" in Lebanon.
Meanwhile, while campaigning in Illinois yesterday, President Reagan
said that the United States had "unilaterally disarmed" in the face of a
Soviet arms buildup before he took office, and he laid the responsibility
on Walter Mondale and the Carter administration.
In a preview of his expected lines of attack in Sunday's foreign policy
debate, Reagan also criticized Mondale for the Iranian hostage crisis,
suggested that Mondale was naive about the Sandinista revolution in
Nicaragua and said Mondale had "failed to repudiate" Jesse Jackson's
sympathetic comments about Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
Rockies, Midwest hit by storms
A blizzard paralyzed much of Colorado with up to three feet of snow
yesterday, forcing the Air Force Academy to cancel classes and bringing
business and travel to a crawl. Snow and heavy rain also fell over a wide
area of the Plains, while tornadoes and hail besieged Missouri and
Arkansas.
"It's bad, definitely bad," said Mayme Thayer, a cook at the Rip Grif
fin Truck Stop west of Limon, Colo., where about 150 people were gath
ered. "It's blowing pretty hard, trucks are getting blown in the parking
lot."
The storm, which was blamed for one traffic death in Colorado and
one in Nevada, lashed snow into four-foot drifts at Limon, 100 miles east of
Denver. Ten inches was reported on the ground in Denver, a foot in
Colorado Springs and greater depths in the mountain foothills — 36
inches in Woodland Park and 25 inches at Cripple Creek.
Heavy snow fell in parts of northern Nevada and the Sierras, and a
winter storm warning covered all of the western mountain area, includ
ing the Lake Tahoe Basin.
Although clouds cleared later in the day, forecasters said a new
snowstorm was brewing in the Rockies and could strike Colorado today.
Friedman has minor heart attack
NEW ORLEANS— Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman suf
fered a mild heart attack yesterday and was hospitalized for observation
at Tulane Medical Center's Cardiac Care Unit, officials said.
Friedman, 72, was resting comfortably and will be going home to San
Francisco in a few days, said Dr. Antonio Quiroz.
Friedman, professor emeritus at the University of Chicago who won
the Nobel Prize in 1971, was scheduled to speak yesterday at the dedica
tion ceremonies for the new A.B. Freeman School of Business at Tulane.
The conservative economist is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and
has advised President Reagan and other world leaders on economic
policy.
U.S., Canada to study acid rain
TORONTO — Secretary of State George Shultz and Joe Clark,
Canada's new external affairs minister, agreed yesterday to launch a
joint research project into causes and cures for acid rain, but Clark said
Canada wants immediate action, not just more study.
The longstanding dispute over U.S. air pollution, which is blamed for
acid damage to Canada's streams and forests, was the only major cause
of friction to emerge from two davs of meetings between Shultz and
Clark.
Ihe 45-year-old Canadian minister, in office for just six weeks,
stressed that the new government in Ottawa planned to seek close and
pragmatic relations with the United States in place of the
"confrontational" approach that he said marked the administration of
former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
In an obvious swipe at Trudeau's widely publicized effort to persuade
the world's nuclear powers to end the arms race, Clark told Shultz that
Canada supports arms control "but it is not seeking a mediation role,"
according to a Canadian official who attended the meeting.
Modest drop on Wall Street
NEW YORK — The stock market posted a modest loss yesterday,
pulling back after its strong advance in the previous session.
Analysts said traders were a bit disappointed when many banks
decided to cut their prime lending rates by only a fourth, rather than a
half, of a percentage point.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 12.26 on Monday,
dropped back 5.19 to 1,197.77.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today with a chance of morning showers. Highs in the
upper 50s to 60s today, dropping to a low in the mid 40s tonight.
