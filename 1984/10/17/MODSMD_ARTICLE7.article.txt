## Chernenko stresses arms issues 
### 
MOSCOW — Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko said in an in
terview yesterday that Soviet-
American relations could be im
proved if the United States would
demonstrate a genuine interest in
reaching an equitable agreement "at
least on one of the essential ques
tions" of arms control.
He singled out four such issues and
made it clear that a resolution of "at
least some of them" would open the
way for the resumption of negotia
tions on strategic and medium-range
nuclear arms.
The four issues included Moscow's
proposal to prevent the militarization
of outer space, a mutual freeze on nu
clear weapons, ratification by the
United States of test-ban treaties and
a pledge by the United States not to
be the first to use nuclear weapons.
Chernenko's proposals for the
most part have been advanced previ
ously by the Soviet Union, and they
are believed to have been raised
again by Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko during his recent
talks with President Reagan and Sec
retary of State George Shultz, but a
senior Soviet official underscored the
stress Chernenko had placed on
making progress in "some" areas, or
even one of them.

This point was made twice in the
first section of the Soviet leader's
carefully phrased written response to
a series of questions, and a source
familiar with Chernenko's intent said
it was meant to convey a signal that a
"positive" U.S. response in any area
could lead to a broader arms control
dialogue, possibly including the re
sumption of the now-stalled negotia
tions on strategic or intermediate
range missiles in Geneva.
The 73-year-old Soviet leader was
responding to written questions sub
mitted to him by The Washington
Post Thursday and to direct question
ing during a 2()-minute interview in
his Kremlin office yesterday.
Chernenko appeared fit, his hand
shake was firm and his complexion
ruddy during his first interview with a
foreign journalist since he became
general secretary of the Soviet Com
munist Party in February.
He described what he called Mos
cow's persistent efforts to safeguard
peace as "the main question for us."
He said that, given the nature of nu
clear weapons, he believes any Amer
ican president also must think about
that issue.
Soviet policy, he said, will remain
unchanged irrespective of the
outcome of the U.S. presidential elec

tion next month. And, he said,
"naturally we would like to see in the
face of the American president a
partner in this sacred human task —
for peace." Referring to the recent
meeting between President Reagan
and Gromyko in Washington, Cher
nenko said that "unfortunately"
there has been no specific shift in
U.S. policies.
But, he said, "if what the president
has said about readiness to negotiate
is not merely a tactical move, I wish
to state that the Soviet Union will not
be found wanting." Political obser
vers here noted Chernenko's con
ciliatory tone and linked his interview
to the forthcoming debate on foreign
policy between Reagan and Demo
cratic presidential candidate Walter
Mondale on Sunday.
Political observers here believe
that Chernenko also wanted to renew
his effort to get a dialogue with the
United States under way. He also
may have wanted to squelch specula
tion in the West that he is in ill health
and that he may not be in charge of
the ruling Kremlin council.
It was Chernenko's first comment
on the state of Soviet-American rela
tions following the Reagan-Gromyko
meeting. The Soviet leader appeared
to articulate his hopes for an im

provement in bilateral relations while
underscoring his disappointment with
the fact that the Washington meeting
had not been followed up by what
Moscow calls "concrete" and positive
steps by the Reagan administration.
The Soviet leader outlined the fol
lowing four areas where "positive"
U.S. steps could lead the two
countries out of the present impasse:
• The opening of talks "with a view to
working out and concluding an agree
ment to prevent the militarization of
outer space, including complete
renunciation of anti-satellite systems,
with a mutual moratorium to be es
tablished from the date of the begin
ning of the talks on testing and
deployment of space weapons."
• An agreement to freeze the nuclear
arsenals of both the United States
and the Soviet Union.
• Ratification by the United States of
the "Soviet-American treaties on un
derground nuclear explosions" signed
in 1974 and 1976.
• Washington's assumption of an ob
ligation not to be the first to use nu
clear weapons, an obligation that the
Soviets have assumed unilaterally.

U.S. steps could lead the two
countries out of the present impasse:
• The opening of talks "with a view to
working out and concluding an agree
ment to prevent the militarization of
outer space, including complete
renunciation of anti-satellite systems,
with a mutual moratorium to be es
tablished from the date of the begin
ning of the talks on testing and
deployment of space weapons."
• An agreement to freeze the nuclear
arsenals of both the United States
and the Soviet Union.
• Ratification by the United States of
the "Soviet-American treaties on un
derground nuclear explosions" signed
in 1974 and 1976.
• Washington's assumption of an ob
ligation not to be the first to use nu
clear weapons, an obligation that the
Soviets have assumed unilaterally.

MOSCOW — Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko said in an in
terview yesterday that Soviet-
American relations could be im
proved if the United States would
demonstrate a genuine interest in
reaching an equitable agreement "at
least on one of the essential ques
tions" of arms control.
He singled out four such issues and
made it clear that a resolution of "at
least some of them" would open the
way for the resumption of negotia
tions on strategic and medium-range
nuclear arms.
The four issues included Moscow's
proposal to prevent the militarization
of outer space, a mutual freeze on nu
clear weapons, ratification by the
United States of test-ban treaties and
a pledge by the United States not to
be the first to use nuclear weapons.
Chernenko's proposals for the
most part have been advanced previ
ously by the Soviet Union, and they
are believed to have been raised
again by Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko during his recent
talks with President Reagan and Sec
retary of State George Shultz, but a
senior Soviet official underscored the
stress Chernenko had placed on
making progress in "some" areas, or
even one of them.

This point was made twice in the
first section of the Soviet leader's
carefully phrased written response to
a series of questions, and a source
familiar with Chernenko's intent said
it was meant to convey a signal that a
"positive" U.S. response in any area
could lead to a broader arms control
dialogue, possibly including the re
sumption of the now-stalled negotia
tions on strategic or intermediate
range missiles in Geneva.
The 73-year-old Soviet leader was
responding to written questions sub
mitted to him by The Washington
Post Thursday and to direct question
ing during a 2()-minute interview in
his Kremlin office yesterday.
Chernenko appeared fit, his hand
shake was firm and his complexion
ruddy during his first interview with a
foreign journalist since he became
general secretary of the Soviet Com
munist Party in February.
He described what he called Mos
cow's persistent efforts to safeguard
peace as "the main question for us."
He said that, given the nature of nu
clear weapons, he believes any Amer
ican president also must think about
that issue.
Soviet policy, he said, will remain
unchanged irrespective of the
outcome of the U.S. presidential elec

tion next month. And, he said,
"naturally we would like to see in the
face of the American president a
partner in this sacred human task —
for peace." Referring to the recent
meeting between President Reagan
and Gromyko in Washington, Cher
nenko said that "unfortunately"
there has been no specific shift in
U.S. policies.
But, he said, "if what the president
has said about readiness to negotiate
is not merely a tactical move, I wish
to state that the Soviet Union will not
be found wanting." Political obser
vers here noted Chernenko's con
ciliatory tone and linked his interview
to the forthcoming debate on foreign
policy between Reagan and Demo
cratic presidential candidate Walter
Mondale on Sunday.
Political observers here believe
that Chernenko also wanted to renew
his effort to get a dialogue with the
United States under way. He also
may have wanted to squelch specula
tion in the West that he is in ill health
and that he may not be in charge of
the ruling Kremlin council.
It was Chernenko's first comment
on the state of Soviet-American rela
tions following the Reagan-Gromyko
meeting. The Soviet leader appeared
to articulate his hopes for an im

provement in bilateral relations while
underscoring his disappointment with
the fact that the Washington meeting
had not been followed up by what
Moscow calls "concrete" and positive
steps by the Reagan administration.
