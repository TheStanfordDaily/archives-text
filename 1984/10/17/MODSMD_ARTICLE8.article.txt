# Winner critical of apartheid
## S. African gets Nobel Peace Prize 
### 
OSLO, Norway — The 1984 Nobel Peace Prize
was awarded here yesterday to black South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu, 53, a leading critic of apar
theid.
The award citation stressed Tutu's "role as the
unifying leading figure in the campaign to resolve
the problems of apartheid in South Africa."
The Norwegian Nobel committee said it wished
to "direct attention to the nonviolent struggle for
liberation to which Desmond Tutu belongs, a
struggle in which black and white South Africans
unite to bring their country out of conflict and
crisis."
Tutu is head of South Africa's Angolan Church
and secretary general of the South African Council
of Churches.
He is the second South African to win the prize.
In 1961 it went to the then-president of the African
National Congress, the late Zulu Chief Albert
Lutuli, for his advocacy of nonviolent opposition to
racial discrimination. Lutuli died in 1967.
For Tutu, who currently is in the United States
on an extended visit, the prize is worth 1.65 million
kronor ($190,000).
Tutu is a highly controversial figure in South
Africa, where the whites in power regard the self
confident church leader as a revolutionary who can
scarcely conceal his seditious intentions, even in his
priestly robes.
Among the black population, however, he is seen

as the fearless critic of apartheid and as a man
prepared to compromise.
Tutu, who is officially considered to be a member
of the Tswana tribe, was born the son of a teacher
in impoverished Klerksdorp, in the shadow of
Johannesburg.
He wanted to study medicine, but due to lack of
money had to choose the less expensive path of
studying to be a teacher. In 1958 he enrolled at a
Johannesburg seminary to study for the priesthood
and was ordained three years later.
He moved to Britain in 1962 and served at a
parish in Golders Green, London, until 1966. He
also saw service in Cape Town and the kingdom of
Lesotho, and was later active in the World Council
of Churches in Britain.
In 1975 he was appointed Anglican deacon in
Johannesburg and a year later became bishop of
Lesotho.
The clergyman sees himself as having been
"grabbed by God by the scruff of the neck in order
to spread His word, whether it is convenient or not.
"In a situation of injustice and oppression it is
impossible to remain neutral. Apartheid is funda
mentally and of its very nature evil and immoral
and totally at variance with the gospel," he
declared.
In his view, apartheid can be defended only by
"evil, immoral and totally un-Christian methods."

Bishop Tutu, who describes himself as being "a
simple pastor passionately concerned for justice,
peace and reconciliation," holds honorary doc
torates from universities in England, Scotland and
the United States as well as from West Germany's
Ruhr University in Bochum.
After he had called on governments in Europe
and the United States to exercise economic pres
sure to change South Africa's attitude towards its
majority black population, Pretoria withdrew his
passport in 1981.
Since then he has been allowed abroad with a
travel document for only specific countries and for a
specific duration. This document enabled him to
travel to the United States, where he will be staying
until the end of this year with his wife.
Tutu was the driving figure behind the associa
tion in 1978 of the mainly Protestant churches in
South Africa. The award citation said the way in
which Tutu and the Council of Churches have
struggled to resolve the apartheid problem was of
"vital significance for the entire African continent"
and for the "cause of peace throughout the world."
Observers believe that Tutu's international
standing — further strengthened now by the Nobgj
award — has been partly to thank for his esc&pesqk
far from detention or exile by South African auth
orities.
