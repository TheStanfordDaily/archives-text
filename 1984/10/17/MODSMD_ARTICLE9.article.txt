Rain may have dampened the spirits outside, but you would never have
guessed it inside Memorial Auditorium yesterday afternoon, as more than
2,000 people packed the hall to see Democratic presidential contender
Walter Mondale and Colorado Sen. Gary Hart. The rain forced organizers
to move the rally from White Plaza to Memorial Auditorium just 30
minutes before the scheduled showtime, leaving volunteers and construc
tion workers a long afternoon if work disassembling the outdoor arena
left behind. A '"Reaganbusters ' dance routine kicked off the show, and
Stephen Stills kept the crowd going with two songs of his own. Finally,
Hart stepped to the microphone to introduce his former rival, who took
the stage amid the roar of supporters and the final notes of the Stanford
Band's version of the "William Tell Overture." Outside, meanwhile, a few
very wet Republican supporters made overtures of their own.
