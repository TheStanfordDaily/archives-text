# Senate receives petition
## Limits re-election 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Students working to limit ASSU
senators to three terms said yesterday
they have gathered more than enough
signatures to place their proposal
before student voters and will meet
with the ASSU elections commis
sioner this afternoon.
The student petitioners need 650
signatures to get the measure, a con
stitutional amendment, placed on a
ballot. "We've gotten well over that,"
said Karen Easterbrook, a backer of
the proposal.
Exactly when the amendment will
go before students is unknown, since
getting it into the ASSU elections
scheduled for the end of this month
would require some "strange per
mutations," according to graduate
senator James McGrath.
Sources close to the drive spec
ulated that the amendment is tar
geted specifically at Senate Chair Eric
Berg and McGrath.
However, only McGrath and
graduate Senator Roland Van Gaalen
would be affected were the amend
ment to be approved by spring quar
ter. Senator Derek Passarelli, one of
the proponents of the move, denied
that this is a personal attack on cer
tain senators. "I really take offense at
that," he said.
The amendment's proponents con
tend that the senate needs to make
room for new people to operate.
When a relatively inexperienced
senator tries to initiate new ideas, the
older senators are "like a filter you
have to work through," said Senator
Yvonne Campos.
Senators who have been in the
ASSU longer than three years have
"definite advantages as far as
knowing the inner workings of the
senate, and can therefore manipulate
what's going on," said Campos.
McGrath. who says that the mea
sure will not affect him since he will
not run for re-election, counters that
the elder senators are performing
"more than their share of institu
tional maintenance."

In addition, re-election forces
senators to remain responsive to the
desires of their constituents, McGrath
said. "Re-election is what keeps
people in line in the real world," he
said.
The bill's primary impact would be

on graduate senators, since only co
terminal undergraduates would be at
Stanford long enough to serve more
than three terms.
On that point, McGrath observed
that it is "strange to limit graduate
students from serving when the
ASSU can't get enough to run now."
The special elections to be held at
the end of this month were made ne
cessary by a shortage of graduate
senators.
Passarelli, who will introduce the
amendment to the senate, said he
thinks that approval of the amend
ment would make people more will
ing to serve in the senate.
Although students have ideas for
improving Stanford, they don't run
for the senate now because "they see
the senate as not accomplishing
things," said Passarelli.
Entrenched senators are one of the
things impeding the efficiency of the
senate, he said.
But McGrath asserted that the sen
ate needs the continuity that experi
enced senators provide. "It helps the
current senate to know what hap
pened in the past senate and to know
what priorities to have," he said.
The current senate has only four
returning senators to give it any con
tinuity, and half of those are graduate
students, he said.
Easterbrook maintained, however,
that the amendment still provides
that continuity. "Three years is a long
time," she said.
The measure will come before the
senate at Tuesday's meeting.
