# Senate receives petition
## Limits re-election 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Students working to limit ASSU
senators to three terms said yesterday
they have gathered more than enough
signatures to place their proposal
before student voters and will meet
with the ASSU elections commis
sioner this afternoon.
The student petitioners need 650
signatures to get the measure, a con
stitutional amendment, placed on a
ballot. "We've gotten well over that,"
said Karen Easterbrook, a backer of
the proposal.
Exactly when the amendment will
go before students is unknown, since
getting it into the ASSU elections
scheduled for the end of this month
would require some "strange per
mutations," according to graduate
senator James McGrath.
Sources close to the drive spec
ulated that the amendment is tar
geted specifically at Senate Chair Eric
Berg and McGrath.
However, only McGrath and
graduate Senator Roland Van Gaalen
would be affected were the amend
ment to be approved by spring quar
ter. Senator Derek Passarelli, one of
the proponents of the move, denied
that this is a personal attack on cer
tain senators. "I really take offense at
that," he said.
The amendment's proponents con
tend that the senate needs to make
room for new people to operate.
When a relatively inexperienced
senator tries to initiate new ideas, the
older senators are "like a filter you
have to work through," said Senator
Yvonne Campos.
Senators who have been in the
ASSU longer than three years have
"definite advantages as far as
knowing the inner workings of the
senate, and can therefore manipulate
what's going on," said Campos.
