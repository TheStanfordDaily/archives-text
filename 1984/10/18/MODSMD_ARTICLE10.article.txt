## Corporate Coffee Break — Greg Crossfield Magowan climbs up ladder the Safeway 
### GREG CROSSFIELD 
This marks the beginning of a bi-weekly column that will ex
plore the lives of Stanford alumni who have become successful
in the world of business.
There is one Stanford alumnus whose company has
problably touched the lives of more of his fellow graduates
than any other. His name is Peter Magowan, the chairman of
the board and chief executive officer of Safeway Stores Inc.,
the world's largest grocery chain.
Although it's not unusual for Stanford graduates to reach the
top of their fields, the speed at which he ascended the corpor
ate ladder makes his story worth investigating. Magowan, 42,
became chairman in January 1980 at age 38. He got this posi
tion after blazing a trail through every aspect of Safeway's
operations in twelve years.
Under four years of Magowan's guidance, Safeway has in
creased revenues from $13.7 billion to an estimated $20 billion

Under four years of
Magowan's guidance, Safeway
has increased revenues from
$13.7 billion to an estimated
$20 billion per year. Earnings
have moved from $143 million
to $210 million.

a year. Earnings have moved from $143 million to $210 mil
lion. The relatively slim increase in earnings is primarily due to
an expansion program focused on the rapidly growing Sun
Belt. This expansion program, along with the innovation
minded executive team now in place should produce some
healthy revenue and earnings gains in the near future.
You don't become the chairman of the world's largest
grocery chain this quickly without a little help. Magowan s
came in the form of his grandfather and father.
His grandfather, Charles Merrill of Merrill Lynch, was a co
founder of Safeway in 1926. Magowan's father retired in 1971,
after sixteen years as chairman of Safeway.
Despite the head start given him by his relatives, Magowan is
regarded by many as a legacy who has earned respect. "Any
executive is judged by his performance. The first two years you
can say it was the other guy's fault, but after that you are on
your own," Magowan said.
The fruits of his labors are evident in the 33 percent increase
in revenues and an organization that seems to be poised to con
tinue this growth.
Peter Magowan graduated from the Farm with a degree in
English in 1964. He then went on to Oxford where he en
hanced his writing skills. His return to the United States was

marked by a stint at Johns Hopkins School of International Af
fairs, after which he went to the State Department.
He said that the prospect of punching passports for the for
seeable future did not appeal to him. So, he began his career at
Safeway in February 1968 as a real estate negotiator in Wash
ington, D.C.
Magowan noted that Stanford played a role in his success.
"The small classes allowed me to speak often. No matter what
your walk of life, good communications skills will come in
handy."
But Magowan was not what one might call a "red hot" while
he was a student at Stanford. " I got my B's at Stanford the hard
way — late nights," he said.
In response to the suggestion that the huge number of baby
boomers might clog the few executive slots available,
Magowan said, "The average age of management is going

down. Many are retiring earlier. There are going to be fewer
25-year sluggers."
What about corporate burn-out in the future?
"Burn-out will become more of a factor because of the great
deal of pressure you are constantly under. There will be more
opportunities for the young."
Magowan admitted that he can feel the intense pressure that
comes along with a high-powered job such as his. He said that
one of the causes for this pressure is the need to keep
everybody in his operation happy.
Labor and special interests want concessions that will
negatively affect earnings, while the financial community wants
those very same earnings to rise at a steady pace. Both sides
could have a negative impact on the company should their
demands not be met.
The pain of holding his position is eased somewhat by the
$500,000 a year compensation. There is also the well
furnished corner office in Safeway's refurbished factory
headquarters and reserved parking. Finally, there is the power
and prestige of running one of the most visible companies in
the world.
Regarding young people aspiring to the top slots in corpor
ate America, "As more people do it, it will destroy the stigma
of becoming chairman at a young age," Magowan said.

board and chief executive officer of Safeway Stores,

Magowan, of the Stanford class of 1964, is 42 years old.
He took his present position at age 38.

He said that the prospect of punching passports for the for
seeable future did not appeal to him. So, he began his career at
Safeway in February 1968 as a real estate negotiator in Wash

Magowan noted that Stanford played a role in his success.
"The small classes allowed me to speak often. No matter what
your walk of life, good communications skills will come in
handy."
But Magowan was not what one might call a "red hot" while
he was a student at Stanford. " I got my B's at Stanford the hard
way — late nights," he said.
In response to the suggestion that the huge number of baby
boomers might clog the few executive slots available,
Magowan said, "The average age of management is going

down. Many are retiring earlier. There are going to be fewer
25-year sluggers."
What about corporate burn-out in the future?
"Burn-out will become more of a factor because of the great
deal of pressure you are constantly under. There will be more
opportunities for the young."
Magowan admitted that he can feel the intense pressure that
comes along with a high-powered job such as his. He said that
one of the causes for this pressure is the need to keep
everybody in his operation happy.
Labor and special interests want concessions that will
negatively affect earnings, while the financial community wants
those very same earnings to rise at a steady pace. Both sides
could have a negative impact on the company should their
demands not be met.
The pain of holding his position is eased somewhat by the
$500,000 a year compensation. There is also the well
furnished corner office in Safeway's refurbished factory
headquarters and reserved parking. Finally, there is the power
and prestige of running one of the most visible companies in
the world.
Regarding young people aspiring to the top slots in corpor
ate America, "As more people do it, it will destroy the stigma
of becoming chairman at a young age," Magowan said.


Peter Magowan grins about his job as chairman of the
board and chief executive officer of Safeway Stores,

Magowan, of the Stanford class of 1964, is 42 years old.
He took his present position at age 38.
This marks the beginning of a bi-weekly column that will ex
plore the lives of Stanford alumni who have become successful
in the world of business.
There is one Stanford alumnus whose company has
problably touched the lives of more of his fellow graduates
than any other. His name is Peter Magowan, the chairman of
the board and chief executive officer of Safeway Stores Inc.,
the world's largest grocery chain.
Although it's not unusual for Stanford graduates to reach the
top of their fields, the speed at which he ascended the corpor
ate ladder makes his story worth investigating. Magowan, 42,
became chairman in January 1980 at age 38. He got this posi
tion after blazing a trail through every aspect of Safeway's
operations in twelve years.
Under four years of Magowan's guidance, Safeway has in
creased revenues from $13.7 billion to an estimated $20 billion

a year. Earnings have moved from $143 million to $210 mil
lion. The relatively slim increase in earnings is primarily due to
an expansion program focused on the rapidly growing Sun
Belt. This expansion program, along with the innovation
minded executive team now in place should produce some
healthy revenue and earnings gains in the near future.
You don't become the chairman of the world's largest
grocery chain this quickly without a little help. Magowan s
came in the form of his grandfather and father.
His grandfather, Charles Merrill of Merrill Lynch, was a co
founder of Safeway in 1926. Magowan's father retired in 1971,
after sixteen years as chairman of Safeway.
Despite the head start given him by his relatives, Magowan is
regarded by many as a legacy who has earned respect. "Any
executive is judged by his performance. The first two years you
can say it was the other guy's fault, but after that you are on
your own," Magowan said.
The fruits of his labors are evident in the 33 percent increase
in revenues and an organization that seems to be poised to con
tinue this growth.
Peter Magowan graduated from the Farm with a degree in
English in 1964. He then went on to Oxford where he en
hanced his writing skills. His return to the United States was

marked by a stint at Johns Hopkins School of International Af
fairs, after which he went to the State Department.
