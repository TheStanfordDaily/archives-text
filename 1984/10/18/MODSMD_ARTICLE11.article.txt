# Cable TV on Farm

### NAOMI SCHECHTER 
Cable TV at Stanford is soon to be
a reality.
Arnold & Porter, the law firm act
ing as cable consultant for the Palo
Alto City Council, has recently sub
mitted a draft proposal, which nar
rows the negotiations down from four
companies bidding on the option to
two.
The four companies originally un
der consideration were Cable Com
munications Co-Operative, City
Cable Partners, Marsh Media Cable
TV and Pacific Bell. The two com
panies still in the running are Cable
Communications Co-Operative and
City Cable Partners.
Tentatively, assuming no delays by
lawsuits, a single company will be

chosen by January 1985. A final con
tract should be written by March.
The franchise agreement will
decide which company will be
allowed to provide cable services to
Palo Alto and the surrounding areas.
Representatives from Palo Alto, East
Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Redwood
City, Atherton, San Mateo and Stan
ford make up the Joint Cable
Working Group which is working
with the Palo Alto City Council to
come to a final decision.
Cable Communications Co-
Operative has proposed a $22 million
system offering 70 channels. City
Cable Partners has proposed a similar
system which, although larger in
terms of total dollars, will require less
money from individual subscribers.
Residences and individuals on
Stanford's campus will be able to
receive cable service no matter which
company is chosen.
Having expressed interest in acting
as a test-bed for cable research and in
producing its own programming,
Stanford University will probably be
given access to an institutional chan
nel.
