## The 						Stanford Daily Sexism in our time 
### 
In a society that defines masculine as John
Wayne and feminine as Christy Brinkley, it is not
surprising that sexist attitudes and practices
flourish at Stanford.
Much of the on-campus social scene is based
on relating to each other as objects of physical
beauty and gratification first, and human beings
second. An example of this is the practice —
found both in dormitories and fraternities, in
both men and women — of inviting to parties
those people who have attractive photos in the
Froshbook. Another sexist activity is choosing at
tractive females to be "little sisters" and "rush
hostesses" in order to entice young pledges.
The source of this sexism is not the male popu
lation at Stanford. It is an economic system that
uses female flesh to sell Diet Pepsi and tickets to
movies. Presented from birth with images of
macho male superiority — the flip side of sexism
— and deferential, docile female subordination,
it is no wonder that men and women at Stanford
have difficulty shedding the standards imposed
by a male-oriented society.
This arrogance toward women has unfortunate
consequences; chief of which is an attitude of dis

respect for women's issues. It is no accident that
active feminists (those women who dare chal
lenge the notion of female subservience) are
widely regarded as lesbians.
These attitudes, sadly, are not confined to the
student body. When Estelle Freedman was ap
plying for tenure in the History Department in
1983, she was turned down because her
"teaching and scholarship were too narrowly
focused on women."
If women constitute one-half of the world, how
can such a focus be too narrow? But this is the
type of attitude that exists at a university that has
1,043 men in tenure-track positions and only 120
women.
We do not wish to blame anyone in particular
for the existence of sexism. Women and men
both contribute to the current situation both by
accepting, and thus propagating, traditional
characterizations of each other.
We do wish to challenge everyone to examine
anew how we evaluate ourselves and one an
other.
