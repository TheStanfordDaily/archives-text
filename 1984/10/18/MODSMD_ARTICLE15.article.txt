## Our 'secret war' is 'state-sponsored terrorism' 
### 
A year ago at this time, I had just returned
from a summer in Nicaragua. During my
three months there, I met many inspiring and
memorable people. Among them was the son
of the Nicaraguan family I stayed with, Gas
ton. Even though it's now been a year since
I've seen him, I still think of him a lot.
Gaston was 19 years old. Superficially, he
closely resembled a typical U.S. teenager: He

was thin, gawky and shy, a diligent student, an
ardent baseball fan and an intense patriot.
But, thanks to the Reagan administration's vi
cious policy toward Nicaragua, Gaston had
undergone an ordeal his North American
counterparts would have difficulty even im
agining. When I met him, he had just returned
from six months' militia duty on the border
with Honduras, where he had been fighting
the CIA-supported contras who have been
trying for the past several years to overthrow
his country's government.
Gaston had joined the militia and gone to
the front voluntarily, even enthusiastically,

because he felt that his homeland needed him.
His commitment to defending Nicaragua's
newly won autonomy and fledgling revolution
against U.S. aggression had only been
strengthened by his tour of duty on the fron
tier, but he had returned deeply sobered by
what he had experienced there. He told me of
endless marching in the rugged terrain of
Nicaragua's northern mountain ranges, of
constant hunger and sickness, of outmoded
weapons which matched up badly against the
brand-new models with which the CIA kept
the contras equipped. He described the con
tras' tactics: kidnappings, torture and murder
of Sandinista teachers and doctors and any
civilians openly sympathetic to the Sandinista
regime, with the aim being to dry up support
for the revolution and intimidate the populace
into quiescence; economic sabotage; am
bushes; and retreats to the shelter of friendly
Honduras whenever the Nicaraguan army
tried to engage them in combat. And, finally,
Gaston talked of close friends he had lost to
contra bullets.
Gaston was lucky. He survived his six
months in the war zone with only psychic

scars. But many other Nicaraguans, just as in
nocent as he, have been less fortunate. Just in
the last couple of years, close to 2,000 have
died at the hands of the contras. Most of the
victims have either been civilians or idealistic
young social workers and militia recruits.
President Reagan likes to wax eloquent
about the threat posed by "state-sponsored
terrorism." But the Reagan administration's
so-called "secret war" against Nicaragua is
the most clear-cut case of such a phenomenon
one could ever hope to see. Reagan seeks to
mask this unpalatable truth by labeling the
contras "freedom fighters."
But, as Vice President George Bush
recently stated, "If it walks like a duck, and
looks like a duck, it is a duck." The former
members of Somoza's infamous National
Guard who compose the majority of the con
tra forces certainly have a long history of
committing atrocities, and their conduct
shows no sign of improving. If this ain't ter
rorism, folks, nothing is.
As hard as the "secret war" is on the
Nicaraguan people, things will likely get even
worse for them if Reagan is re-elected. Em

boldened by a "mandate" from the U.S.
public and freed of any need to worry about
the political impact at home of military inter
vention abroad, a second Reagan term would
probably step up the pressure on Nicaragua,
ultimately launching an air assault or even a
full-scale invasion against it. Such a move
would be a tragedy resulting in the loss of
thousands of innocent lives.
And the casualties would not all be on the
Nicaraguan side. The overwhelming majority
of the Nicaraguan people love their country,
their government and their revolution and
are prepared to fight to the death in defense
of them. Moreover, they are well-organized,
have ready access to arms and are experi
enced in guerrilla warfare.
Thus the Nicaraguan populace is both will
ing and able to put up a good fight; any
attempt to bludgeon it into submission would
prove protracted, bloody and, in the final
analysis, futile. The U.S. experience in
Nicaragua would be a reprise of Vietnam, not
of Grenada.
Even should Reagan refrain from such a
drastic escalation of his private war against

Nicaragua, he would certainly at the very least
maintain it at its current level. And even this
"low-intensity" war is inflicting uncon
scionable suffering on the Nicaraguan people.
As a visitor to Nicaragua, one quickly
becomes aware that it claims victims practi
cally every day.
Too many fine young Nicaraguan men and
women like Gaston have already been killed
and more stand to die if Reagan is allowed to
persist in his misguided policy. It is time for
us, the people of North America, to put a stop
to the senseless killing. It is time for us to take
responsibility for our government's actions
toward Nicaragua and to insist that they be
dramatically altered. One major step in the
right direction would be to elect Walter
Mondale in the coming election. Mondale's
position on Nicaragua is far from ideal, but he
has made the essential move of pledging to
end the covert war.
