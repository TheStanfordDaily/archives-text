## The 						intricate and confusing politics of partying 
### 
The English language is a very strange and confusing form of
communication indeed. So often words or expressions are redun
dant, vague or simply strange and confusing. Linguistics experts
have tried, and often failed, to discover the origins of the

VIEWPOINT

peculiarities of the English language, and to this day, many of our
oddities of communication remain a mystery.
Some of the seeming illogic which plagues the Queen's En
glish, however, is not difficult to explain. To illustrate this point,
consider the seeming ridiculousness of the use of the word
"party" to describe both an enjoyable social function, where all
in attendance presumably have a wonderful time, and a political
action group, which, by its very nature, is a thoroughly unen
joyable product of our complex system of government, a neces
sary evil at best.
Although these two "parties" may seem strange bedfellows at
first glance, upon closer examination, the relationship between
the two becomes quite obvious. To understand this, condsider

the following:
The behavior of humans at a social party and in the political
arena is quite similar.
This statement is true, mainly for one fundamental reason, this
being, that humans who attend social "parties" are almost invari
ably intoxicated and therefore do very stupid things and make
stupid or completely unintelligible statements. This is also true
for all but a very few politicians, save that they do not, for the
most part, have the excuse of being mentally inebriated.
Ridiculous statements and actions as witnessed by the rare sober
individual at the average large-scale social event are rarely more
humorous or pitiful than a press conference with a leading
politician or aspiring political candidate. Moreover, both are
invariably the product of a feeble attempt to seduce and/or
deceive (more often "and"). A drunken frat man's slurred,
"You're the only one I want to be with tonight, baby," to the
12th blonde is an obvious attempt to get his way. If No. 12
doesn't put out, he'll just move on to No. 13.
The hopeful political candidate's, or incumbent's, loud prom
ise that he cares about the working class more than the big busi

ness or high-pressure lobby that finance his campaign is again no
more than an attempt to get what he wants; if the group of voters
doesn't put out in the next poll, he'll move on to someone who
will.
Unfortunately, this is where the parallel does end. The in
ebriated undergraduate usually causes little or no major
long-term damage, and if he does, it only affects a small group of
individuals. The political inebriate, however, can screw up the
works for millions, both inside and outside the good ol' U. S. of
A. And there's no $5,000 fine or minimum jail term for them.
Perhaps the "gullible coeds" who fall for the feeble advances
of intoxicated partiers and politicians deserve what they get, but
the rest of us certainly don't deserve the social, economic and
life-threatening results which will undoubtedly trickle down in
our direction from "partisan partying."
I'm forming a coalition called "VADP" (Voters Against
Drunk Politics). It may not be as good an acronym as MADD,
but what the hell, it's the best I could think of with the hangover
from last month's convention!
