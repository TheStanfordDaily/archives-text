## The 						art of 'bovine politik' 
### 
Last year 1 spent a lot of time in the low-lying
hills behind the campus, investigating the grazing
habits of the slowmoving cows that live there. What
drew me to the gentle hillocks was not these peace
ful ambling inhabitants, though cows are indeed
fascinating creatures (1 hoped to watch them multi
ply and to determine where they went to sleep at
night). The initial reason for my pilgrimages was
the need to escape the confines of dorm life and
academic inertia. My bovine fetish arose because I
had become disillusioned with the world I found at
Stanford, and 1 sought the soothing comfort of
cows, who had no chips on their shoulders.
We were told that coming to this school entailed
the free exchange of ideas and beliefs. Ostensibly
this was true; as I remember, there was a.lot of in
tense discussion going on between me and my
friends, concerning all sorts of critical political is
sues: abortion, religion, peace, war, us, them. Oc
casionally we came up with some good talks (I
remember one of the best was between me and two
friends of mine, a Jew and a Christian, on the place
of religion in their lives and the absence of it in
mine), but only rarely.
For the most part we were unable to keep the
discussions civil for very long. I believe we lacked
the reassurance that is necessary before new ideas
can be played with; I know I was very defensive,
unsure of how my ideas would be received. Fur
thermore, as I recall, the "ideas" weren't all that
new anyway. They were mostly the residue of the
heavy political and ideological rhetoric that seems
to characterize our nation, like so many others.
It was all very uncomfortable. We'd even neglect
our schoolwork so we could argue into the wee
hours of the morning, expanding on the familiar
themes of President Reagan's blissful imbecility
and the Democrat's idealistic booshwah. And
things really got depressing as we began to express

contempt for what was loosely termed the
"bourgeois society," then contempt for ourselves
for contributing to it. It's difficult to criticize the in
justice of a society you live in without becoming
hotly defensive when someone rudely reminds you
that you live in it.
This kind of choleric bickering made us all sick.
Getting to sleep at night was difficult after another
round of brutal questioning and accusation, with no
"progress" made for anyone; it was rare, if ever,
that we cared what the other person was talking

about, short of using it to catch him up and glee
fully step on him.
After only one quarter into the year, I gave up all
political discussions, for the most part, and cheer
fully made my way up into the hills whistling a
happy tune, to bask in the sunset over the Coastal
Range and to watch the cows migrate over the hill
sides.
Such for me were the fruits of free political dis
cussion.
It was only when I dealt with my friends as
friends, rather than as opponents, that I found life
bearable here. Stuck as I was in an academic
miasma for which I felt totally unprepared, just
having people around that I felt comfortable with
made the whole process of living here easier.
Sharing the common experience of classes and par
ties, my friends and I became important to each

other. The late-night talks became friendlier as we
discussed our problems and told stories. We
became part of each others' lives, and, because we
were friends, dropped whatever seemed to compl
icate them unnecessarily. Because one of the first
complications we dropped was political discussion
and assorted "issues," it would seem that our com
mitment to them was lukewarm at best.
I believe we used the issues that involve every
one to compete with and victimize each other,
instead of using them to examine our attitudes and
explain why we held them, why they were impor
tant to us. I suppose we all did engage in that kind
of self-examination, but if my friends were like me,
they did it in the early hours of the morning,
moaning weakly into their pillows, hoping for the
knots in their stomachs to unravel as exhaustion fi
nally overcame them. I know my friends were like
me, and I know they did it all alone.
This year, in my house, in my courses and in this
column, I hope to find a much better way of living,
where I can have the reassurance necessary to play
with new ideas instead of just attacking and dis
carding them. By reopening at least some of the is
sues that still are important to me — I hope to all of
us — maybe we can intelligently discuss them and
not be afraid of them. I've heard rumors that this is
supposed to be beneficial somehow. My personal
goal is to find hope where I now find mostly
cynicism and despair.
Of course, if it doesn't work, if I find myself
fielding more than my share of abuse, if the ideas
just aren't there, then I know of some relaxing al
ternatives. I may just spend some time in my favor
ite kind of therapy, roaming the hills behind
Stanford, discussing the finer points of "Ulysses"
with the amiable, accommodating cows.
