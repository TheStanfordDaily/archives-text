Let us in
The organizers of the Mondale
visit were thoughtful enough to move
the rally out of rainy White Plaza
and into comfy Memorial
Auditorium. I can't help wondering
whose comfort they had in mind,
though. Certainly not the audience's.
If I'm going to stand in the rain for
an hour anyway, I'd prefer to do so
in White Plaza listening to Hart and
Mondale than in front of Mem Aud
listening to chants of "Let us in! Let
us in!"
Was there any reason the or
ganizers couldn't have let people sit
inside Mem Aud while they set up
scenery instead of leaving us out in
the rain while they did so?
