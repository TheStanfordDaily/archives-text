## Borrowing greatness: Peter Shaffer's inflated 'Amadeus' 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
After seeing Peter Shaffer's
"Amadeus" twice on stage (once on
Broadway and once in San Francisco)
and sitting dutifully through all two
hours and 40 minutes of the film ver
sion, directed by Milos Forman and
with a revised screenplay by Shaffer
himself, I must confess I still don't see
in it what the New York critics and so
many theatergoers apparently have,
though perhaps I understand what
lends this heavy, stuffed-shirt play its
appeal.
Shaffer has a knack for hatching
dramatic ideas that sound fascinating
until you examine them carefully, and
he is the shrewdest of used c&r sales
men when it comes to second
guessing his audience. In the 1973
"Equus," he streamlined drama for
liberal intellectuals that responded
superficially but precisely to the cur
rent fads in psychological concerns.
Writing a play about a boy with a
stereotypical strict-religious upbring
ing who commits an atrocity out of an
inability to reconcile sexuality and re
ligion, Shaffer gave his emotionally
lacerated victim/hero an analyst ex
periencing his own sexual frustra
tions. A humanitarian, he fears that
by "curing" the boy he will be taking
away his passion and consigning him
to the mediocre, emotionally dead
world in which he, the psychiatrist, is
a permanent resident.
This Laingian shell game of an
argument begged the central
sociological question of the play —
how should society deal with a boy
who has done something horrible
(blinded horses) but who clearly
deserves our sympathy for the agony
he is in in? — as well as the central
humanistic question — what can the
psychiatrist do to alleviate the boy's
suffering? — by shifting the focus to
the (considerably less interesting)
analyst.
Logically, it's nonsense to insist
that we use the doctor's jaded, embit
tered vision of the life of the psychi
cally well adapted as a normative
point of view, but Shaffer carried it
off dramatically, relying on liberal
audiences to accept his evasions as
profundities just as they had ac
cepted, in other eras, the pseudo
probing of such plays as "The

Children's Hour," "The Crucible
and "Inherit the Wind."
In "Amadeus" the shell game has
become more complicated as well as
bewigged and petticoated, since it
takes place (mostly) in the court of
Emperor Joseph II of Austria during
the 1780 sand early 17905, when An
tonio Salieri was the official court
composer and Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart a brilliant young upstart
threatening Salieri's superior posi
tion.
This time the issue is the form of
genius. Shaffer begins with what
seems to be a revisionist view of mu
sical history's most redoubtable
genius, Mozart, whose gifts are
couched in a grotesque form — a fa
cetious, arrogant, scatological twit
(played in the film by Tom Hulce)
who paws his bosomy bride-to-be
Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) un
der a sweet table in a palace reception
room while his music is being per
formed for the pleasure of the Em
peror (Jeffrey Jones) in an adjacent
salon.
The paradox is that such a revolting
spoiled brat could produce such mag
nificent music, or as Salieri (F. Mur
ray Abraham), who is watching this
display of juvenile lust unseen by the
participants, expresses it, that God
should choose "an obscene child to
be his instrument." Shaffer has rigged
it so that Salieri alone, the favorite of
the Emperor and therefore of the
cowardly, blank-minded, shoe-licking
Viennese aristocracy, has the vision
to comprehend the revolutionary
complexity of Mozart's music and
therefore (and this is Shaffer's prize
irony) to acknowledge — and rage
privately about — his own pitiful in
adequacy.
Salieri interprets this solitary curse
as God's blight on him and declares
war on God, with Mozart as the bat
tleground. He sees to it that Mozart
cannot get ahead in the Austrian
court, that he and Constanze (now
married) and their child remain on
the verge of starvation while Mozart
continues to create one glory after
another — "The Abduction from the
Seraglio," "The Marriage of Figaro,"
"Don Giovanni," "The Magic Flute"
— glories that only he, Salieri, can
appreciate.
But this kind of cynical approach to

an established view of greatness,
which would have been swallowed
whole by audiences in the late Viet
nam years, is demode for the eighties,
and Shaffer knows it. So he pulls back
from Salieri's envenomed perceptions
halfway through the drama and shows
us what Salieri himself can't see —
that Mozart is no silly, dimpled weak
ling, no foul-mouthed jerk but a
man of passion.
Passion is Shaffer's "Open
sesame!" once again — as in
"Equus," it throws everything fash
ionably out of kilter. Mozart writes
such inspired music not just because
he is prodigiously equipped, but also
because his soul, unlike Salieri's
shriveled one, bulges with the life
force, and that is why obscenities
pour unseasonably from his mouth,
For wouldn't you expect impropriety
from a man who — his pores ever
open in his all-embracing tour of Life
— laughs too heartily, drinks too
deeply and makes love with too much
gusto?
And as iron-clad proof of his moral
claim to superiority over the spiritu
ally constipated Salieri, who stuffs
himself on pastries alone, the people
adore Mozart's music — the Em
peror's servants applaud his court
performances, and the fun-loving
crowds devour "The Magic Flute" at
the Theatre auf der Wieden, where
the impressario Schikaneder (Simon
Callow) plays the first Papageno.
Never mind the extreme im
plausibility of Salieri's being the only
educated man in Vienna in the late
18th century to appreciate Mozart,
and never mind the contradiction in
herent in Shaffer's dramatic construe
tion: that Mozart is too intricate fo) -
Salieri's colleagues to understand and
yet the untutored audiences at
Schikaneder's theatre (if indeed sufch
audiences would ever have fouOd
their way to the opera in this period
or any other) sense the composer's
greatness instantly.
Never mind that the movie begins
with the tempting proposition that
the only man in Vienna smart enough
to see the visionary genius in Mozart
is in the greatest danger from it (and
therefore must plot to suffocate it)
and ends by throwing that idea out
for the democratic (and highly
debatable) one that true genius

belongs to the people, and they will
always recognize it.
Shaffer can have it both ways be
cause he puts his audience in a plum
position, congratulating us continu
ally on our hindsight. When the court
oensor, Count Orsini-Rosenberg
(JCharles Kay), urges Mozart to aban
don "The Marriage of Figaro" and
asks him why he wastes his spirit on
•uich rubbish, we can snicker because
we know what the "rubbish" will end
up sounding like.
It must have been the combination
if deep-seeming popular ideas and all
the period pomp that drew Milos For
man to this project, as well as such as
sorted luminaries as choreographer
Twyla Tharp and Czech set designer
Josef Svoboda. Forman has made his
reputation on "important' properties
— first Ken Kesey's "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest," which he turned
into terrific popular entertainment,

then "Hair," which became a
provocative, powerful but unlikable
(and financially unsuccessful) movie
musical, and finally the E.L. Doc
torow novel "Ragtime," which he
wrecked — but in such a broad,
respectable manner that it won him
praise anyway.
Because I don't care about the play
"Amadeus" the way I cared about
Doctorow's book, I could watch For
man's movie version without the
anger I felt during "Ragtime," but it's
such a heavy movie — long and
boring, and cluttered (as "Ragtime"
was) with overdressed extras who evi
dently have no idea what they're
supposed to be playing. If Forman
has a bone in his body that isn't
weighed down by his eastern
European sensibility (he's a Czech
emigre), he hasn't revealed it in any
of his movies; the "jokes" in
"Amadeus" (like the way Salieri's fa

ther meets his end in the flashback
montage near the beginning) hit the
floor like ten-ton weights, and then
Forman clears space for them as if by
staring at them we'd enjoy them bet
ter.
The only humorous moment that
really comes off is the one most de
pendent on exaggeration: When Con
stanze's overbearing mother
(Barbara Byrne, playing essentially
the same role as in "The Bos
tonians") screeches at Mozart for
failing to provide properly for her
daughter, he looks at her monstrously
overworked mouth and fierce eyes
and starts to construct the most hor
rific of all mothers-in-law, the Queen
of the Night in "The Magic Flute."
Many reviewers have praised For
man for reproducing so much of
Mozart's music in this picture, but we
don't get to enjoy it, because there
are so many distractions — bad dub
bing (I'm not sure why Forman didn't
just shoot real singers in the opera
scenes), completely unconvincing
"conducting" by Tom Hulce, and a
very odd, disjunctive conceit by
which the libretti always begin in
German or Italian and then switch
into English. Besides, that insuf
ferable Salieri is always around —
since the entire movie is framed by
his recounting the story of his rivalry
with Mozart at a distance of several
decades, to a shocked priest in a
hospital ward — to tell us how mar
velous the music is, as if we couldn't
decide for ourselves. (Shaffer absorbs
this inconsistency in his treatment of
the audience smoothly into his
scheme.)
In the hospital scenes, poor F.
Murray Abraham has to wear one of
those overaccomplished make-up
masks (designed by Paul Leßlanc)
that seem to become characters in
themselves and efface the flesh-and
blood actors behind them — like the
one Dustin Hoffman suffered in for
"Little Big Man.' Forman probably
means something by all those close
ups of Abraham's wizened old
"face," with its detailed ugliness,
while he's describing the beauty of
Mozart's music, just as he insists on
showing us a ward full of stage-set
lunatics not once but repeatedly, and
the blood all over Salieri's face when
he hemorrhages, and the most un

savory details of Mozart's burial. (It
reminded me of historical films set in
the Middle Ages in which directors
show they've done their homework
by training the camera on the excre
ment in the courtyard.)
If Forman were really interested in
authenticity, anyway, he'd have had
someone else show Tom Hulce how
to conduct, and he would have cast
someone else as Constanze — some
one who didn't have Elizabeth Ber
ridge's contemporary New York
looks.
Both F. Murray Abraham and Tom
Hulce have their moments in
"Amadeus," though as Shaffer has
built the play neither role can work
straight through. Since the script
begins by embracing Salieri and his
view of Mozart and ends by discard
ing it, Abraham is at an advantage in
the first half of the movie, when we
find Mozart unbearable, and at a dis
advantage in the second half, when
Mozart's humanity emerges and
Salieri's disappears. I saw lan McKel
len and then John Wood, both fine
actors, struggle with the role of Salieri
and fail to find a path through it.
Abraham is less mannered than
either of them, but the movie eats
him up in the final analysis.
As for Tom Hulce, whose casting
one might think utterly bizarre based
on his previous screen appearances
(most notably as the innocent in
"Animal House"), he gives a bad,
flamboyant and anachronistic perfor
mance for most of the movie's length
— though he gets to wear Paul
Leßlanc's best proto-punk wig, a
white powder puff dusted with or
ange, when he conducts one of his
operas — but surprisingly, in his
feverish, deathbed scenes he shows
some skill.
Every now and then, Forman and
Shaffer do something genuinely
clever (a sequence in which Mozart,
entering the Austrian court for the
first time, transforms Salieri's dull
welcome march in his honor into a
splendid trifle by improvising a varia
tion on it) or genuinely affecting
(Salieri transcribes Mozart's final
opus — a Mass commissioned, un
beknownst to Mozart, by Salieri him
self — from the dying Mozart's dicta
tion). But not often. Shaffer endows
Mozart's father with so much power

over him that, after the old man's
death, Salieri can throw the young
composer into a state of nervous col
lapse (and physical disrepair) by ar
riving at his door in a carnival
costume Mozart senior once wore
and demanding a Mass for the dead.
In the play, this semi-mystical,
semi-Freudian mumbo-jumbo was
rather bewildering, but in the movie,
which Shaffer has padded out with a
real on-screen version of Leopold
Mozart (played by Roy Dotrice), you
can't take it seriously for a moment.
Leopold's initial appearance, at the
top of the stairs to his son's apartment
in a black cape, his arms outstretched
like a vampire bat's wings, is meant to
be ominous (though Forman botches
the moment), but as soon as he settles
into the role of the visiting in-law,
forever nagging his son and berating

his daughter-in-law for her poor
housekeeping, he becomes so insig
nificant that Mozart's resurrection of
him, as the Commendatore in "Don
Giovanni," seems to be a joke the
filmmakers neglected to punch prop
erly.
And if Mozart is supposed to be
such a life-lover, couldn't Shaffer and
Forman have depicted his marriage to
Constanze as the nurturing force they
want us to believe it was, rather than
as a series of inane dirty jokes and
banal domestic scuffles?
It's not enough to star Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart in your movie and
fill the soundtrack with his music; you
have to be worthy of him, too. In
"Amadeus," Peter Shaffer and Milos
Forman have inflated themselves
with Mozart's greatness.
