### JOHN WALLIN TELFORD WORK 
KZSU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tonight at 6
The rating scale is one to five stars.

U2 — The Unforgettable Fire
★ ★ ★ V2
U2's influence on the music
scene can hardly be underestimated
— the guitar suffered a beating
when synth pop became fash
ionable, and became heavy
metal's equivalent of the chain saw.
U2 somehow took regular old
drums, guitar, bass, and vocals and
created its own distinctive sound.
Sometimes this sound comes across
danceable, such as in "Pride (In the
Name of Love)," and sometimes it
becomes introspective and
philosophical. There seems to be a
lot of meaning in what U2 sings
about, but it is just too difficult to
extract or fully enjoy on just a few
listenings. The album will never be
as successful as "War," nor as in
fluential as "Boy"; but if previous
U2 efforts have proved rewarding
to you, "Unforgettable Fire" will
too. Less central are the instantly
infectious guitar work by The Edge
and the immediate impact of each
song, but those willing to take the
extra time to really listen to these
selections will find the experience
worthwhile.

General Public — All The Rage
★ ★ ★
It's a disappointment that after
waiting for a year for The English
Beat part II and being tantalized by
an appetizing General Public ap
pearance on Madness' "Keep
Moving," we have to say nasty
things about yet another album. It
has a couple of hit singles, of
course, such as "Tenderness,"
which 'a la carte' would almost be
enough to save MTV from Def
Leppard. In fact, there are quite a
few worthwhile selections on "All

the Rage"; the problem is that
prolonged listening to continual
ska-pop is enough to make us hate
both. Ska's continuous beat
combines with pop's unadven
turous fluffy side to produce only
monotony. Perhaps if every other
group from the new British Inva
sion didn't hire the same program
mers for their synths and drum
machines, General Public might
stand out more. But with things the
way they are, aside from Dave
Wakeling's infectious vocals noth
ing distinguishes this effort from
the rest of the pack.

Let's Active — Cypress ★ '/2
This is one of those records you
might buy for one song, then put it
back in your record collection and
forget about it until you try to sell it
back a year later and the guy will
only give you 50 cents for it. This
sort of manufactured grass-roots
neo-paleo has got to go. The strum
min' good-timin' guitar just hangs
through each song without adding
anything, and the harmonies are
just plain bad. All this mediocrity
could be palatable without the self
righteousness of the band added to
it: It puts its own art on the cover
and inner sleeve and calls it "Art
As It Happens." A complete listen
to this record, if possible, yields
only the question of what Let's Ac
tive is trying to play. The music
resembles R.E.M. without inspira
tion — soft Southern rock which
lends itself to background but is as
soon forgotten as it is heard. Noth
ing is really terrible here — just
dull. We're going to sell ours back
now and get the $2.50 while we still
can.
