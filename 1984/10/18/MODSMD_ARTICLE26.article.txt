# West Bay 'Carmen' best yet
## 
### ELAINE WANG Daily staff 
Palo Alto's West Bay Opera Com, iny presents their
best production ever with Georges Bizet's "Carmen,"
playing tonight, Friday and Saturday at the Lucie Stern
Center.
The company's strong points have always lain in the di
rection of the drama of opera — telling the story through
barriers of language — but this time they have voices to
match. And the orchestra, under the direction of David
Sloss, is wonderfully fine-tuned.
Set in Seville, the story centers around Carmen, a flir
tatious gypsy who casts her eye on Don Jose, a corporal
with the dragoon. When he arrests her for scratching up
another village girl, she seduces him and convinces him to
let her go. Jose is arrested in her place.
While he spends two months in jail, Carmen and her
companions Frasquita and Mercedes meet the toreador
(bullfighter) Escamillo, who makes overtures to Carmen.
She rebuffs him and later refuses to accompany her com
panions on a profitable smuggling mission, claiming she is
in love with Jose.
Jose arrives then, and there is a passionate reunion. But
Carmen's delight turns to anger when he insists on res
ponding to offstage trumpets and returning to his troops.
Jose's captain comes for him, but the gypsies detain him to
allow Jose to escape. There is no choice, and Jose goes
with Carmen and her friends.
By this time, Carmen has begun to lose interest in Jose.
In the mountains, her gypsy friends tell fortunes and see
love and wealth in store for them; Carmen deals herself
the cards and can only see death.
Escamillo comes looking for Carmen, and her flirting
with him enrages Jose, who demands a duel. But Jose's
old girlfriend, Micaela, appears and tells him his mother is
dying; he hurries off but warns Carmen that she will see
him again.
At the bullfight, Carmen is at Escamillo's side.
Frasquita and Mercedes warn her that Jose is out for
revenge, but Carmen does not go in to watch the fight. As
the crowd files into the ring, Jose appears and pleads for
the two of them to try again. Carmen insists it is over and
throws his ring at him; and as the crowd in the arena
cheers for Escamillo, Jose kills her.
West Bay's Carmen, Maxine Litwak, is feisty and
volatile, though she cannot dance. Bizet's dark-haired
beauty is interpreted well by Litwak, whose sultry voice
and sexy style make a powerful Carmen. There is careful
shading, too, between the scenes where she is pure
seductress and those where she is with her gypsy friends.

With the latter she is more relaxed, more a buddy.
Keith Purdy, as Don Jose, is a formidable tenor who
needs to loosen up his shoulders and torso. But the pairing
of Litwak and Purdy as voices is one of the best I've heard
at West Bay. So is Elli Holt-Murray, the soprano who
played Micaela.
Small dramatic touches lend color and humor: the town
priest with a purple sash solemnly shuffling across. Car
men snatching a tamborine from a blind man; the only
overdone bit was the children's chorus, which sings well
but looks pained. It is also onstage too long at some
points.
But the essentials are all there in marvelous form, and
there is reason to believe that it will continue.
