# Animals lose creativity, record quality
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
It has been some 20 years since the first British Invasion
brought some of the most enduring music of rock 'n' roll's
short, but storied, history.
Some of the most prominent groups and their music,
like the Beatles, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones and the
Who, have endured. Many of the groups merely lost the
test of popularity and went the way of Buffalo Springfield.
But somewhere in the middle of fame and flop is where
the Animals are trying to exist. Judging by their latest ef
fort, "Greatest Hits Live," this may be one of the last
critiques you'll ever read about them.
As it is, the Animals may be nothing more than an Inva
sion revival group. Since late 1966, by which time all the
original members except Eric Burdon had left, the group
has reunited three times. Once in 1968, again in 1976
and this effort on New Year's Eve of 1983.
This album suffers from three major failings: It lacks
creativity, it has very little energy or inspiration and it is
very poorly recorded. Besides those problems, Burdon
has never sounded worse.
In other words, if you're not really interested in the
Animals in the first place, don't waste your time with this
record. If you are interested in the Animals, keep reading

and you'll discover why you shouldn't waste time
The biggest "problem is the poor quality of the record
ing. Most live albums are recorded through direct hook
ups to the instruments. This record sounds like it was re
corded over two stationary microphones.
At times Burdon's voice fades in and out. Logically that
shouldn't happen. If there was a direct hook-up to his

mike that wouldn't happen unless he didn't sing into the
mike. No entertainer in the world is stupid enough to not
sing into the mike.
Besides the lead vocal, the background vocals and all
the instrumental work are muffled and poorly mixed.
The quality of this recording was so poor that it was al
most not worth listening to. Recording quality is the most
important element to any album, especially a live one. Al
bums like "Rock 'n Roll Animal" by Lou Reed, "One for
the Road" by the Kinks and "Songs in the Attic" by Billy
Joel are so well recorded that the songs seemingly sound
better than the original studio recordings.
On the creativity side, this album doesn't have a whole
lot of it. In fact, aside from some slightly altered arrange
ments and a pretty good introduction to "We Gotta Get
Out of This Place," there is absolutely rone.
Some people might say that's all right. Just the mere
fact that this group is performing its music still is some
thing to be treasured. Unfortunately, the Animals have
been capitalizing on the past for quite some time. This is
the fifth greatest hits-type album that the group has
produced out of 17 total albums. Glorifying the past only
goes so far.
Live performances should also be opportunities for a
group to do something different or "stretch out" a bit. I'm

not saying that they should add some new meaning to a
song, but a little creativity is what the audience, and the
record buyer, is paying for.
Chas Chandler, John Steel and Hilton Valentine do the
songs almost verbatim. Keyboardist Alan Price is the onl\
one who seems to have "permission to do any solo work
and Burdon sounds like a bad imitation ot Bill Murray
doing a bad imitation of a bad nightclub singer.
At the very worst moment, the group does a revised
version of "House of the Rising Sun." Burdon sounds
very drunk at the beginning and by the end it sounds like
he has swallowed the mike.
Burdon's once throaty, blues sound is now plagued with
weakness and age. When the group attempts Sam Cooke's
"Bring It on Home to Me," Burdon can't hold the high
notes with any clarity and ends every line with a weak
"baby" or "yeah."
Closely related to this lack of creativity is the lack of en
ergy. The group just seems to be going through the mo
tions. On John Lee Hooker's great concert song "Boom
Boom," the group can't even get the crowd excited
enough to clap. It is the height of inadequacy.
Thus, the album is not much more than frustrating and
irritating. Unless you happen to be a diehard fan or ex
tremely curious, avoid this album.
