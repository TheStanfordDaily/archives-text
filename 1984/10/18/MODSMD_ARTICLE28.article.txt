						new plan for the fans 
### 
This column is addressed to all
of you who are going to this Satur
day's football game.
Actually, on second thought,
this column is addressed to all of
you who aren't going to this Satur
day's football game. After all,
there are more people who aren't
going than who are.
Between 33,000 and 34,000
people are expected to show up on
Saturday as Stanford takes on
Washington State. Stanford
Stadium has a capacity of 84,795.
That's a whole lot of leg room.
The obvious question is, why
isn't anybody going to show up?
Well, if you just want to talk about
this particular game, there are
some plausible answers.
First, the Cardinal didn't exactly
turn any heads in last week's
miserable performance against the
University of Washington.
Second, with John Paye still out,
the offense has become a little
dull. Third, Washington State isn't
one of the big names in college
football. About the only place that
the Cougars are well known is
Moscow. Moscow, Idaho that is.
That must explain it, right. Well,
not completely, especially when
you realize that approximately
44,500 showed up last week for
the Stanford-Washington game. In
four games this season, Stanford is
averaging less than 50,000 spec
tators a game, and that includes
the San Jose State game, which
drew a series-record 70,426.
In other words, even when Stan
ford was winning, even when Paye
was playing and even when the Op
ponent was one of the the top
rated teams in the country, no one
was showing up. That brings me
back to the original question. Why
isn't anybody showing up?
The best thing I can come up
with is a twofold answer. First, and
probably most important, fans still
don't believe that Stanford foot
ball is improving. Second, the
Athletic Department doesn't
know how to properly promote
the team.
In some ways I have a hard time
blaming the fans. The Cardinal
was 1-10 last season and had a
bunch of mediocre years before
that. During the John Elway era,
Stanford didn't have to worry as
much about winning and losing
because Elway kept the turnstiles
spinning.
When John left for the warmth

of Denver, the fans said, "Put up
or we're not coming back." Stan
ford didn't "put up" right away
and the fans left. Not one-by-one
either but in droves.
But then, albeit somewhat late,
the Athletic Department did make
some changes. A new coach, a new
attitude and even a few victories.
With a 3-3 record, including losses
to the No. 1-ranked and No. 2-
ranked teams in the nation, you
might expect that the fans would
be just a little interested.
The conclusion you might come
to is that fans are just fickle. Un
fortunately, that conclusion has
some problems as well, especially
if you work for the Athletic De
partment.
Right down the hallway from
the Stanford Football Office is the
Stanford Basketball Office.
Therein sits King Tom and the
Knights of Promotion.
On Monday, basketball Coach
Tom Davis announced the
opening of basketball practice.
With the announcement came his
general assessment of the upcom
ing season. It wasn't an optimistic
assessment, but it was expected.
As everybody already knows,
Stanford is not going to do too
well.
The polls predict that the Car
dinal will finish ninth in the Pacific
10 Conference. With more than
70 percent of last year's offense
gone and having to play in one of
the toughest conferences in the
country, that estimate is about
right.
But when Davis christened the
new season, Director of Marketing
Jim Colton also announced that
Maples Pavilion is less than a
1,000 season tickets away from
being sold out. For a team that
isn't going to win too much, ticket
sales are going phenomenally well.
The reason that the sales are
going so well is that Davis and
company don't promote Stanford
basketball. They promote Pac-10
basketball. The reason fans should
see games is that they're going to
see very good teams.
Also, if the fans do show up, the
Cardinal tends to play better, ac
cording to Davis. It is a unique
strategy, and it is working. The
strategy is much different than
what the football team does.
It's about time that Davis takes
a walk down the hall.
