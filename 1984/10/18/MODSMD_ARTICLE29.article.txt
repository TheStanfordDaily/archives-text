# Rebels defeat men's soccer
## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
High winds, very cold tempera
tures and the nationally-ranked Uni
versity of Nevada-Las Vegas added
up to trouble for the Stanford men's
soccer team, which lost a 4-0 non
conference match in Las Vegas last
night.
Cardinal Head Coach Sam Koch
said, "The weather was a key factor
in tonight's game. The game was a
little closer than the score indicated."
UNLV, 8-2-2 and ranked 16th in
the country, scored early on a 50-
yard shot from Rob Moreland. Ac
cording to Koch, the ball got caught
in the swirling winds, did "funny
things," and got by Cardinal
goalkeeper Willy Burkhardt.
The Rebels scored 20 minutes later
off a corner kick. Burkhardt deflected
Rob Taber's shot, but it hit the post
and bounced in for a 2-0 lead. Mark
Olejnik and Robbie Ryerson, who
now has 11 goals this season, added
second-half scores to wrap up the vic
tory.
Koch said Stanford had several
good chances to score, but Rebel
goalkeeper Harry Fields played very
well in lowering his goals-against
average to 0.75, making six saves.
