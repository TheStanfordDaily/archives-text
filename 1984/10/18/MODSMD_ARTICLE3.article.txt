# Fear spurs Brown suicide vote
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Undergraduates at Brown University captured
national attention last week after approving a non
binding referendum advocating the availability of
cyanide pills in the event of a nuclear war.
At the end of a two-day election period, 19 per
cent (1,044) of Brown's student body had voted in
favor of the referendum while 13 percent (687)
opposed the measure.
Brown Students for Cyanide, composed of stu
dents from various campus disarmament groups,
sponsored the referendum on last week's ballot.
The literal intent behind the referendum was that
students be able to choose suicide before dying in a
nuclear holocaust. But those in support of the mea
sure said the main point was increasing student
awareness of the threat of nuclear war.

"I think in terms of their goal of increased
awareness, they're really serious," Brown sopho
more Helen Lee said. "But as far as having health
services seriously stock up on cyanide pills, I think
that's questionable."
National media attention first focused on the
Brown cyanide issue when Brown students for
Cyanide gained enough signatures to place the ref
erendum on the election ballot. Since then, CBS,
The New York Times and other national media
have reported on the group's activity.
It was amid this media attention that results of
the election were released last week to a room full
of cameramen and reporters.
But junior Jason Salvman, a sponsor of the refer
endum and one of the organizers of Students for
Cyanide, told the Brown Daily Herald that the

media has at times misinterpreted the suicide pill
proposal.
"We don't want nuclear war to occur. We want
to end the arms race," Salvman said. "It's the mark
of a sick society when we have to think of suicide."
Since the passage of the measure, Salvman and
sophomore Chris Feguson have formed Students
Against Nuclear Society. On Nov. 2, the group
hopes to see protest rallies on college campuses
across the country.
Sophomore Cathy Kuo, one of those who
opposed the measure, said she was sympathetic to
the group's goals but did not approve of its meth
ods.
"Reading between the lines, it says stop nuclear
war but straight black and white it says suicide
