# Card finally beats UCLA
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball team played its "best
match of the season" last night en route to defeating con
ference rival UCLA, 15-13, 15-5, 15-7.
The Bruins are ranked No. 3 in the nation by this
week's Tachikara poll and were tied with Stanford and the
University of Southern California for second place in the
Western Collegiate Athletic Association. Stanford is cur
rently ranked second in the nation and had lost three
matches to the Bruins last year.
Cardinal Asst. Coach Don Shaw said, "This is the best
we've played all season. . . . Our blocking was organized,
and we really dug the ball well all night. We served tough
too. We missed some, but they were aggressive errors."
Junior hitter/middleblocker Kim Oden had an out
standing match. Her hits accounted for 22 kills for the
Cardinal. Her presence at the net was dominating in the
final two games, where her blocking played a major role
in the one-sided scores.
"We were on tonight," Oden said. "We played together
as a complete team. We jelled."
The match appeared to be a major breakthrough for the
Cardinal. Freshman hitter Teresa Smith said, "I think this
game really built up our confidence. It was definitely our
best match so far."
At the end of the first game, the match looked as if it
would be a tough one for either team to win. Both teams
played aggressively, with strong hits and smart defensive
plays.
At 13-all, Wendi Rush made a solo block for a Cardinal
side out. Stanford hitter Susan Compton then spiked for
the go-ahead point. The Bruins hit the ball out giving the
Cardinal the first game.
In the final games, Stanford kept most of the momen
tum. UCLA began making a few mental errors. The
Bruins' serving, which had been a factor in the first game,
became less effective.
