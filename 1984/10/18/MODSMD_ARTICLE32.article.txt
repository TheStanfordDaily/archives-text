# Paye's knuckle healing right

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The two pins in the lower knuckle
of Stanford quarterback John Paye's
right index finger were removed yes
terday and X-rays showed the bone is
"healing perfectly" team physician
Dr. Don Bunce said.
But Bunce also said that Paye, who
broke the metacarpal-phalange joint
of the finger in the Sept. 29 game
against Arizona State, will miss at
least two more games.
"I won't allow him to play until he
has full motion (in his finger) and a
painless joint," Bunce said. "The ear
liest possible he could play is against
USC (Nov. 3), but you can't count on

that either because the injury could
very well take longer to heal."
Paye will wear a splint on his finger
for one more week and will be able to
do light workouts in about 10 days.
Until then, however, he can only grip
a football but not throw it.
"It's still very swollen and 1 feel
like I can't put much pressure on it,"
Paye said yesterday. "You have to
have a lot of flexibility in that finger.
It's going to be hard to throw at first."
Bunce said the fracture Paye sus
tained generally takes between four
and six weeks to heal. "It's very hard
to predict (when Paye's finger will
heal) because no two injuries are ex
actly alike," Bunce said.
