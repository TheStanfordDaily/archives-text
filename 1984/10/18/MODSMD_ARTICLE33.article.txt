# EE courses face surge of students

A continuing boom in the number
of undergraduates taking electrical
engineering courses here is both a
"joy and a burden" to the depart
ment, according to Prof. Robert
White, its chairman.
Electrical engineering undergradu
ate majors have increased by 50 per
cent in the last five years, but the
number of undergraduates taking
electrical engineering courses has
grown much faster, putting great
stress on the department's financial
and professorial resources.
"Unfortunately, there have been
no increases in the number of author
ized faculty for nearly two decades,"
White said.
"The teaching gap is filled by
young unbilleted faculty (when a
tenured slot is expected to come open
through retirement), by emeritus fac
ulty recalled to teaching, by research
faculty (for whom teaching is not part
of their normal duties), by postdoc
toral research staff, by visiting faculty
and by outside lecturers, usually from
local industry," White said.
Regular University funding covers
only one-eighth the actual cost of
"other teaching" by these people,
White noted. The department covers
the resulting deficits through gifts it
raises, mainly from industrial sources.
"Without a large and continuing
flow of gift funds, the EE department
could not meet either its teaching
obligations or update its instructional
programs to 'go with the flow" tech
nologically," White said.
Although limiting electrical engi
neering courses to undergraduates
majoring in the department would
lesses the burden, White said such a
policy is completely unacceptable.
