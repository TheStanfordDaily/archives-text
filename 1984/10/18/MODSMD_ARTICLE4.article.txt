# Menlo Park vs. Stanford
## City files suit over road 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Lawyers representing the city of
Menlo Park filed suit yesterday
against Stanford and Palo Alto,
claiming that Menlo Park officials
were not properly consulted in the
plans to extend Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real.
The action could throw a monkey
wrench into the University's hopes
for beginning construction on the
$2.5 million project as early as
February.
The Palo Alto City Council ap
proved plans for the 2,400-foot ex
tension last month, ending 10 years of
exhaustive negotiations between the
University and the city and ap
parently paving the way for the road's
completion. But Menlo Park council
members attending that meeting
pledged that they would take Palo
Alto to court in an effort to make
their demands heard.
Yesterday, their lawyers filed a suit
with the Santa Clara County Superior
Court. The document asserts that
Stanford and Palo Alto neglected to
consider the environmental impact of
increased traffic and noise on Menlo
Park.
"Palo Alto and Stanford are really
a gang of two," said Jack Cosgrove,
an attorney representing Menlo Park.
'Tn pushing this through, they have
disregarded their neighbors."
According to Cosgrove, the exten
sion will increase traffic burdens on
the already clogged intersections of
El Camino and Ravenswood Avenue
and EI Camino and Middle Avenue,
as well as on Sand Hill Road itself.
"We don't want the robber barons
to rob us of our environment,''
Cosgrove said. He charged that the
project's Environmental Impact
Report a document prepared
in conjunction with all major con
struction developments, "was inade
quate."
Andy Doty, University director of
community relations, said the EIR
"was a year and a half in the making
and it was a very detailed report."
University officials estimate that
the extension will divert the more
than 6,000 cars daily that currently
traverse the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter parking lot in order to gain access
to El Camino. The extension would
be funded entirely by the University
and is slated to run from Arboretum
Road to El Camino, along the north
side of the shopping center.
Cosgrove said that, while the Uni
versity and Palo Alto are both ad
dressed in the suit, "Stanford is the
real party of interest."
Nevertheless, the decision to in
clude Stanford in the matter ap
parently caught both University and
Menlo Park officials off guard yester
day.
"I just found out that Stanford was

a party [in the suit] today," said
Menlo Park Mayor Peg Gunn last
night. The Menlo Park City Council,
of which Gunn is a member, voted to
sue at a meeting last week, but left
details up to city attorneys.
University lawyers would not com
ment on the suit yesterday, saying
they had not yet seen the document.
Cosgrove said the lawsuit seeks to
stop the project until Palo Alto and
Stanford consult with Menlo Park
and consider certain mitigating
measures.
"This entire project could have
been avoided had Palo Alto done
what it was supposed to do and con
sulted Menlo Park," Cosgrove said.
Gunn said the suit was filed as a
means of "buying time." She said she
hopes the parties can negotiate with
out going to court.
"I want to talk," Gunn said. "I do
not want to sue."
According to Gunn, "informal
talks" between Menlo Park, Palo

Alto and Stanford are already under
way.
Cosgrove and Gunn said they will
pursue a number of mitigating
measures in these talks, including a
frontage road along Sand Hill near
Santa Cruz Road, access to El
Camino going south from the inter
section of Alma Street and El
Camino, and limitations on future
University development along Sand
Hill Road.
This last mitigation proved to be a
stumbling block in last year's negotia
tions between the University and
Palo Alto on the Stanford West
housing project.
Cosgrove argued, "The real reason
for the extension is to permit the de
velopment of Stanford West and
other projects.
"You can't totally disregard your
neighbor and develop yourself to the
hilt and use his traffic patterns to ab
sorb your traffic," he said.
Doty said he is baffled and disap
pointed over Menlo Park's opposition
to the extension.


Andy Doty
"You would think Menlo Park

would be pleased," he said.
Mayor Gunn predicted the suit
would delay the project by a few
months. Cosgrove said it "could be
delayed a lot longer."
If negotiations prove futile and the
case goes before the court, Cosgrove
thinks Menlo Park will win.
"We believe we have a very strong
and legitimate case," he said.

would be pleased," he said.
Mayor Gunn predicted the suit
would delay the project by a few
months. Cosgrove said it "could be
delayed a lot longer."
If negotiations prove futile and the
case goes before the court, Cosgrove
thinks Menlo Park will win.
"We believe we have a very strong
and legitimate case," he said.
Lawyers representing the city of
Menlo Park filed suit yesterday
against Stanford and Palo Alto,
claiming that Menlo Park officials
were not properly consulted in the
plans to extend Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real.
The action could throw a monkey
wrench into the University's hopes
for beginning construction on the
$2.5 million project as early as
February.
The Palo Alto City Council ap
proved plans for the 2,400-foot ex
tension last month, ending 10 years of
exhaustive negotiations between the
University and the city and ap
parently paving the way for the road's
completion. But Menlo Park council
members attending that meeting
pledged that they would take Palo
Alto to court in an effort to make
their demands heard.
Yesterday, their lawyers filed a suit
with the Santa Clara County Superior
Court. The document asserts that
Stanford and Palo Alto neglected to
consider the environmental impact of
increased traffic and noise on Menlo
Park.
"Palo Alto and Stanford are really
a gang of two," said Jack Cosgrove,
an attorney representing Menlo Park.
'Tn pushing this through, they have
disregarded their neighbors."
According to Cosgrove, the exten
sion will increase traffic burdens on
the already clogged intersections of
El Camino and Ravenswood Avenue
and EI Camino and Middle Avenue,
as well as on Sand Hill Road itself.
"We don't want the robber barons
to rob us of our environment,''
Cosgrove said. He charged that the
project's Environmental Impact
Report a document prepared
in conjunction with all major con
struction developments, "was inade
quate."
Andy Doty, University director of
community relations, said the EIR
"was a year and a half in the making
and it was a very detailed report."
University officials estimate that
the extension will divert the more
than 6,000 cars daily that currently
traverse the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter parking lot in order to gain access
to El Camino. The extension would
be funded entirely by the University
and is slated to run from Arboretum
Road to El Camino, along the north
side of the shopping center.
Cosgrove said that, while the Uni
versity and Palo Alto are both ad
dressed in the suit, "Stanford is the
real party of interest."
Nevertheless, the decision to in
clude Stanford in the matter ap
parently caught both University and
Menlo Park officials off guard yester
day.
"I just found out that Stanford was

a party [in the suit] today," said
Menlo Park Mayor Peg Gunn last
night. The Menlo Park City Council,
of which Gunn is a member, voted to
sue at a meeting last week, but left
details up to city attorneys.
University lawyers would not com
ment on the suit yesterday, saying
they had not yet seen the document.
Cosgrove said the lawsuit seeks to
stop the project until Palo Alto and
Stanford consult with Menlo Park
and consider certain mitigating
measures.
"This entire project could have
been avoided had Palo Alto done
what it was supposed to do and con
sulted Menlo Park," Cosgrove said.
Gunn said the suit was filed as a
means of "buying time." She said she
hopes the parties can negotiate with
out going to court.
"I want to talk," Gunn said. "I do
not want to sue."
According to Gunn, "informal
talks" between Menlo Park, Palo

Alto and Stanford are already under
way.
Cosgrove and Gunn said they will
pursue a number of mitigating
measures in these talks, including a
frontage road along Sand Hill near
Santa Cruz Road, access to El
Camino going south from the inter
section of Alma Street and El
Camino, and limitations on future
University development along Sand
Hill Road.
This last mitigation proved to be a
stumbling block in last year's negotia
tions between the University and
Palo Alto on the Stanford West
housing project.
Cosgrove argued, "The real reason
for the extension is to permit the de
velopment of Stanford West and
other projects.
"You can't totally disregard your
neighbor and develop yourself to the
hilt and use his traffic patterns to ab
sorb your traffic," he said.
Doty said he is baffled and disap
pointed over Menlo Park's opposition
to the extension.
