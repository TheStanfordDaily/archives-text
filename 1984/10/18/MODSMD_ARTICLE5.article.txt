# Zschau, Carnoy debate nuclear defense policy
## 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Sunnyvale)
and Democratic challenger Martin
Carnoy agreed on the issue of a
strong national defense but clashed
on the effectiveness of a nuclear
freeze in a debate before a capacity
Kresge Auditorium crowd last night.
"I would support a 90-day
moratorium on the development and
deployment of all nuclear weapons.
Let's challenge Chernenko and the
Soviets to come to the bargaining
table," Carnoy said.
Carnoy took a harsh stance toward
the defense policy of the Reagan ad
ministration, labeling the president s
program as a "euphemism for dan
gerous nuclear policy ."
"We have enough nuclear weapons
to destroy the world many times over.
That's why I hope Congress will push

for a nuclear freeze. We will still have
more than enough force for deter
rence," Carnoy said.
Zschau agreed that "a freeze is the
ultimate goal," but stressed the need
to pursue step-by-step reductions in
nuclear armaments. He said he is
"hesitant" to make a nuclear freeze
"our cornerstone for negotiating with
the Soviet Union."
Rapid changes in technology could
render the current U.S. nuclear
deterrent "obsolete," Zschau said.
But Carnoy said. "The Reagan ad
ministration is not using nuclear
weapons simply as a deterrent but as
bargaining chips to get superiority
over the Soviet Union. All weapons
being designed now are for a first
strike offensive strategy "
While both candidates believed
that military expenditures should be
reduced, thev disagreed on a method

to achieve this goal without jeopar
dizing national defense.
Carnoy criticized Zschau's support
of the Pershing 2 missile and his ini
tial vote in favor of the MX missile
system, which he now opposes. He
also disagreed with Zschau's support
of the B-l bomber.
Both candidates opposed the de
velopment of defense systems in
space.
Carnoy called the current trend of
Pentagon spending to finance military
research in the Silicon Valley a dan
gerous one that would ultimately
make the average high-tech em
ployee hostage to military contracts.
Zschau countered by saying the in
fluence of the Pentagon in the Silicon
Valley is limited and affects only a
handful of companies.
