American among Nobel winners
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — Two European physicists and an Ameri
can chemist received Nobel science prizes yesterday for fundamental
and far-reaching discoveries — and new technologies — involving the
forces of nature hidden within the atom and the building blocks of life it
self.
The 1984 Nobel prize in chemistry went to R. Bruce Merrifield, the
first American to win a Nobel this year. The 63-year-old professor at
New York's Rockefeller University was cited by the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences for an "ingenious" method of chemical synthesis
that revolutionized the development of new drugs and gene technology.
The Nobel physics prize will be shared by Carlo Rubbia of Italy, 50,
and Simon van der Meer of the Netherlands, 59, for their "decisive con
tributions" to a large research effort in Geneva that led to last year's
dramatic discovery of new particles believed to carry one of the four
basic forces in the universe.
These "W" and "Z" particles provided experimental evidence for
"weak interaction," a force that is responsible for some types of radioac
tive decay and nuclear processes which control the power of the sun.
The award honors not only the two individuals but the effort by the
European nuclear research organization known as CERN to develop a
superaccelerator that could isolate these subatomic particles. The
facility, located on the Franco-Swiss border, is funded by 12 member na
tions.
Yesterday's announcement is a reminder that in the highly competi
tive world of high-energy physics, U.S. scientists' dominant world posi
tion has been eroded or even supplanted — at least temporarily — by
the well-funded efforts of their European colleagues.
Poll shows Mondale gaining
WASHINGTON — Heading into the last scheduled debate of the
campaign on Sunday, Democratic challenger Walter Mondale has
narrowed President Reagan's lead to 12 points in the latest Washington
Post-ABC News poll.
The sampling of 1,505 registered voters, taken between last Friday
and Tuesday nights, gave Reagan a 54-42 percent lead over Mondale.
A poll taken before the Oct. 7 Reagan-Mondale debate on domestic
policy had shown Reagan with a 55-37 percent margin. A survey taken
Oct. 8-9, in which respondents to an earlier poll were called back,
showed that Mondale's strong performance in the Louisville debate had
shaved the Reagan edge to 56-41 percent, and it has narrowed another
three points since then.
As both the president and his challenger settled in for briefings and
rehearsals for Sunday's televised debate from Kansas City, the week's
escalating rhetoric on both sides testified to the increasing stakes in that
confrontation.
Although Mondale has gained on Reagan since the debate, his 12-
point deficit is the widest gap at this point in the race since Richard
Nixon's 23-point margin over George McGovern at a similar point in
1972. In 1980, Reagan had a three-point lead over President Carter in
mid-October; in 1976, Carter had a six-point lead over President Ford;
and in 1968, Nixon had an eight-point lead over Hubert Humphrey.
Bush shielding Reagan, aides say
SAN FRANCISCO — Weeklong controversies over Vice President
George Bush and his sharp tongue, controversies that threatened to en
gulf and diminish his candidacy, are now turning to his advantage, his
strategists insisted yesterday.
Bush campaign aides said that the vice president has drawn the atten
tion and fire of Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale for a
working week, shielding President Reagan at a time when the presi
dent's age and abilities are under question.
"When you have the Democratic presidential nominee spending five
solid days aiming his broadsides at the Republican vice president, it's a
good thing for us," Press Secretary Peter Teeley said in an interview.
"All it does is free up the president to take the high road."
Teeley later told reporters that the Democrats had "wasted" five days
"by throwing bombs at us."
Meanwhile, the San Francisco Examiner reported yesterday that
Reagan, contrary to his original campaign strategy, will visit California
Monday, the day after the final presidential debate in Kansas City.
The announcement of Reagan's trip comes amid a surge in Mondale's
campaign. A recent poll conducted in the state concluded that Mondale
had lessened Reagan's lead, although the president still holds a sizeable
lead of 10 points over Mondale.
Originally Reagan was so confident of winning his home state that he
planned to campaign here only once before the Nov. 6 election, said Ed
ward Rollins, the Reagan campaign director.
Reagan opened his fall campaign in California with appearances in
Orange County and Cupertino.
Ferraro warns of 'empty promises'
SACRAMENTO — Making a strong plea for disaffected youthful
voters, a frustrated Geraldine Ferraro, Democratic vice-presidential
candidate, warned about 10,000 students yesterday not to "bank on
empty promises" by voting for President Reagan.
Democratic strategists are concerned that polls show young voters,
like those who gathered by a grove of tall evergreens under crisp autumn
skies at the Sacramento State University campus here, to be among the
73-year-old president's staunchest supporters.
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, Ferraro ac
knowledged that young people do not "have too much confidence" in
the Democrats.
"They're not looking at the whole picture," she said. "They believe
what Ronald Reagan says" about the booming economy, renewed sense
of patriotism and national defense.
"Young people should worry more than anything else about war and
peace issues," Ferraro continued. "They've got their whole lives before
them. I'm always amazed that they're not."
In her speech yesterday, Ferraro said "I understand that many young
people just like you are thinking about voting for Ronald Reagan be
cause you think he will help you get jobs. I understand your concern.
"But I am here to tell you that the Democratic Party has always stood
for opportunity," she continued. "We believe in opening doors. We
know that education unlocks opportunity. We have a plan for reducing
the massive Reagan deficits that threaten sustained economic growth."
U.S. responds to Soviet offer
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration, responding to Soviet
President Konstantin Chernenko's call for a thaw in U.S.-Soviet rela
tions, said yesterday that the United States is not willing to "pay a price"
to bring the Soviets back into nuclear arms control negotiations.
President Reagan welcomes the positive tone of the Kremlin leader's
remarks and invites the Soviets to return to nuclear arms talks, according
to a statement issued by White House spokesman Larry Speakes. But he
indicated no change in the U.S. bargaining position in response.
Privately, administration officials suggested that Chernenko's state
ment, made in an interview with The Washington Post, was timed to
take advantage of the pre-election atmosphere in the United States —
perhaps in hopes of winning concessions from Reagan.
A White House official who spoke on the condition that he not be
identified said that the administration was encouraged that Chernenko's
statement "was absent a lot of the usual Soviet rhetoric." He also noted
that the Soviet leader did not mention two items that he has previously
cited as "stumbling blocks" to better relations: NATO deployment of
Pershing 2 missiles and the disagreement over a proposed ban on chemi
cal weapons.
Stocks finish mixed
NEW YORK — The stock market was mixed yesterday in a session
marked by broad declines in energy issues.
Oil and oil-service issues sold off as the state-run British National Oil
Corp. announced cuts of as much as $1.35 a barrel in the price of its
North Sea oil.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.88 to 1,195.89.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds today with a chance of rain in the morning and with
rain likely in the afternoon. Today's highs will be in the upper 50s and
60s.
