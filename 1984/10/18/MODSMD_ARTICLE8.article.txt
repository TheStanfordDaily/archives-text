# Embassy warnings revealed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” In the weeks
before this September's terrorist
bombing of the American Embassy
annex in Beirut, the U.S. government
had specific, reliable intelligence
warnings that explosives had been
shipped into Lebanon and were tar
geted against American Embassy
personnel, according to informed in
telligence sources.
U.S. and Israeli intelligence first
tracked explosives and timed fuse
bombs in mid-August. Days before
the Sept. 20 bombing, they learned
that the explosives were designated
for use against Americans. A vul
nerability assessment narrowed the
possible points of attack to two
facilities in east Beirut: the ambassa
dor's residence in the southern hills,
and the eventual target, the embassy
annex to the north near the Mediter
ranean coast.
Reagan administration officials
who have reviewed the intelligence
and the details of the attack have
found that the failure to take more
aggressive security precautions was
even more unsatisfactory than first
reported. One official called it
"inexcusable" and another

"negligent." Sources said that too
many U.S. security forces were
deployed away from the annex,
where the most American personnel
were stationed.
The analysis of security after the
bombing shows that terrorists on
Sept. 20 could have had unimpeded
access to the embassy from a side
road that ran about 200 feet from the
annex. No barricades were in place
there. Fortunately, the sources said,
the driver of the van carrying the ex
plosives approached the building
through the front gate and was
slowed down along that route by se
curity guards and by concrete barriers
around which he had to weave.
The explosives were detonated 30
feet before the van reached the an
nex, making the damage and death
toll less than they might have been.
Sources said the new information
about security lapses accounts in part
for Secretary of State George Shultz's
directive last week that he receive a
daily briefing on embassy safety as
part of a "full-court press" on new se
curity measures.
In addition, the sources said intelli
gence reports show that some of the

explosives are still in Lebanon and
another attack is anticipated before
the American presidential election.
U.S. authorities, according to one
source, most fear another attack
against precisely the same target.
Under new security measures, all
vehicles other than the ambassador s
automobile entering the embassy an
nex in Beirut are stopped. Passengers
and deliveries are then loaded into a
shuttle service that runs from the
gates to the annex, these officials
said.
U.S. intelligence, working with
friendly intelligence services includ
ing those of Israel and Lebanon, have
traced the financing of the explosives
to an elusive financial middleman
with close ties to Iranians who have
supported terrorism in the past.
The middleman is identified,as
Hassan Hamiz, a Lebanese with high
level contacts in the Iranian govern
ment. Hamiz was paid $50,000 as
part of the operation supporting the
October 1983 bombing at Marine
headquarters in Beirut that killed
241, according to intelligence reports.
Hamiz is closely associated with
Hussein Musawi, a leader of one lac

tion of Shiite militants in Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley. Musawi's cousin, Abu
Havdar Musawi, was involved in ob
taining the pickup truck used in the
1983 Marine bombing, according to
intelligence reports. He heads his
cousin's group called "Hussein
suicide commandos," the reports say.
Intelligence has also established
the identity of the driver of the van
that carried the explosives in the most
recent bombing. The driver ap
parently had two or three aliases, but
officials said he has been traced to the
militant Shiite movement called Hez
ballah, or Party of God, which previ
ously has been identified as the group
responsible for the terrorist attack.
The group is a loose confederation.
Sources this week cautioned that in
telligence data, though concrete and
believed to be reliable, is not strong
enough to make a case in court.
Last January the Israelis arrested
12 terrorists, including some mem
bers of the Party of God, and ob
tained documents, money, opera
tional structures and target informa
tion.
