# Committee rebukes CIA manual

WASHINGTON â€” A CIA document instruct
ing Nicaraguan rebels in the techniques of political
assassination and guerrilla warfare was denounced
yesterday by the chairman of the House intelli
gence committee as "repugnant to a nation that
condemns such acts by others."
Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.) said the 44-page
document, "Psychological Operations in Guerrilla
Warfare," is further proof of the dangers in the
Reagan administration's active sponsorship of the
contras fighting the leftist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua.
In addition to rekindling questions about whe
ther the administration's aim is to overthrow the
Sandinista government, the document's detailed in
structions on how to kill fleeing civilians or govern
ment officials seem certain to stir arguments about
whether the CIA is violating rules prohibiting its
personnel from engaging directly or indirectly in
assassination.
The document's advocacy of political assassina
tion, blackmail and mob violence also poses a
major credibility problem for the administration
because it has condemned those tactics as interna
tional terrorism when practiced by groups sup
ported by such countries as Libya, Iran and Syria.
Boland charged that the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence knew nothing
about the document, which the CIA produced and
gave to the contras last year, until its existence was
revealed by the Associated Press this week. He
likened the situation to the ClA's failure earlier
this year to tell the committee about its complicity
in the mining of Nicaraguan harbors.
The controversy generated by the mining was a

key factor in Congress' decision to cut off U.S. fun
ding for the contras. In spite of administration ef
forts to get the funds restored. Congress has in
sisted on keeping the ban in effect at least until
March.
"Like the mining, the manual is a disaster for
American foreign policy," Boland said. "I am ap
palled by the image of the United States that the
manual portrays. Something such as this manual
points to the wisdom of congressional action to cut
off funding for the secret war. Unfortunately the
cutoff comes too late to repair the damage in this
instance."
Boland's sharp criticism was echoed by other
members of Congress. Rep. Michael Barnes (D-
Md.), chairman of the House Western Hemisphere
affairs subcommittee, called the manual an
"outrage and almost certainly a violation of the
rules governing the CIA." Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) said "aiding and abetting a strategy of
political assassination is unacceptable in American
foreign p01icy...." Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-
N.Y.), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said he will ask the CIA for a report on
the matter by Friday.
The CIA has refused to comment publicly on the
document, which was written in Spanish and has
been translated into English by the Congressional
Research Service. But U.S. officials have con
firmed privately that it is authentic.
The manual amounts to a course on how to orga
nize a guerrilla movement and lead it to power by
winning popular support and pursuing the tactics of
violent insurgency.

In discussing how to gain control over towns, it
says that if "it becomes necessary" to shoot a citi
zen "trying to leave the town," the guerrillas
should justify their action by claiming that the vic
tim was "an enemy of the people" who would have
"alerted the enemy" and permitted the Sandinistas
to "carry out acts of reprisals, such as rapes, pillage,
destruction, captures, etc."
At another point, the document states: "It is pos
sible to neutralize carefully selected and planned
targets, such as court judges, police and state secur
ity officials, etc."
The manual stresses that "it is absolutely neces
sary to gather together the population affected, so
that,they will be present and fake part in the act,"
with the guerrillas explaining "why it was necessary
for the good of the people" to "neutralize the tar
get official."
Boland said "this conscious targeting of individ
uals" to be eliminated "embraces the communist
revolutionary tactics that the United States is
pledged to defeat throughout the world." He also
contended that such tactics prove that the adminis
tration's aim in the covert war is not merely to halt
Sandinista aid to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, as
it has said, but "to overthrow the Sandinista gov
ernment."
Many of the tactics have been described in pub
lished works by scholars and journalists who have
analyzed guerrilla campaigns in Cuba, Malaysia,
the Philippines and several African countries.
Specialists also have noted that the techniques are
similar to those used by the Viet Cong during \Y\e
Vietnam War.
