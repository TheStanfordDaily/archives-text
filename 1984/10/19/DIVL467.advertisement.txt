\ \". . . the ballistic missile ... is the one that is the

\ \the silo in which there could be the possibility
\ \ of miscalculation. That is the one that people
\ \ know that once the button is pushed, there
\ \ is no defense; there is no recall. And it's
\ \ a matter of minutes, and the missiles reach
\ \ the other country. Those that are carried
\ \ in bombers, those that are carried in ships
\ \ of one kind or another, or submersibles,
\ \ you are dealing there with a conventional
\\ type of weapon or instrument, and
\ \ those instruments can be intercepted.
\ \ They can be recalled if there has been
\\ a miscalculation."
