# 300 attend USW rally in White Plaza

### MARK BEYREIS 
Labor leader Cesar Chavez castigated the
University's attempt to "break" the United
Stanford Workers union yesterday, saying his
United Farm Workers would support USW "all
the way."
"It is beyond our understanding how this
prestigious university, this institution of higher
learning, can stoop so low as to try to break this
union," Chavez said.
The organizer of California farm workers
spoke at a "welcome back" rally in White Plaza
yesterday that also featured Education Prof.
Martin Carnoy, a candidate for Congress. The
rally was designed to organize support for USW
before the union's Oct. 30 election.
A majority of the 300 people that attended
the rally followed union leaders in a march from
White Plaza to University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
The event was co-sponsored by USW Local
680, the Service Employees' International
Union (SEIU) and the Student Labor Support
Committee, a group formed in spring to help
USW force the University to recognize Local
680.
Linda Crouse, president of Local 680, said
the rally was a good showing of both workers
and students.
Chavez said Kennedy's actions would affect
the next generation of business leaders.
"We are sincerely concerned about the exam
ple President Kennedy is setting for the students
that will be graduating here and, in time,
leading corporations. Does this mean that they
too will break unions?" he asked.
The farm workers' organizer also said that the
battle over Local 680 could have a detrimental
effect on unions everywhere. "The future of
unions is at stake when the president of such a
prestigious university goes on record against the

union," Chavez said.
Carnoy said USWs problems with Stanford
are symptoms of national problems.
"The Reagan administration is basing its eco
nomic policy on the fact that people should not
have the right to protect themselves either as
workers or consumers," Carnoy said.
Richard Holober, executive secretary of San
Mateo Central Labor Council, pledged the sup
port of the AFL-CIO to Local 680 and joined in
the criticism of the University's conduct.
"Stanford University is a great institution in
many ways, but [its] attitude toward the
workers is a stain on [its] greatness," Holober
said.
"The attitude of the University is the attitude
of 'father knows best,' " he said.
Holober said the union members, not the
University, were in charge of the union. " The
University is demeaning itself by discussing
what is your business. It's none of [its] busi
ness," he said.
Tim Twomey, vice president of SEIU, said at
the rally that his organization believes in local
autonomy. He said the University does not
seem to share that belief.
"Apparently the president of this university
would like to decide who is going to be presi
dent (of the union), or, if who he wants to
become president doesn't, then he is going to
decide not to recognize the union," Twomey
said.
Later, Kennedy denied Twomey's claim.
"Mr Twomey's statement is confused. We want
members of the bargaining unit to vote as to
whether or not they want this particular repre
sentation," he said.
"In taking our position we, of course, consid
ered the quality of 680's leadership —as did the

leadership of 715 when it walked
away from representation," Kennedy
said.
At the rally, Crouse characterized
the days before the union was estab
lished as the "Scrooge days." When
work got slow, Crouse said, "you
were sent home without pay and
management didn't give a hoot whe
ther you could make the rent or not."
She said the USW election basi
cally consists of two issues. First, she
said, "Is no representation better
than reresentation? That's what the
administration says."
Second, she added, "Is no contract
better for us? That's what the admin
istration says."
Crouse said that without a contract
the workers would have no
guaranteed wages, no guaranteed
benefits and no guaranteed rights.
"We are proud to have built one of
the first university unions in the
country, and on Oct. 30 we are going
to be prouder still to keep it," Crouse
said.
After the rally, the speakers led a
march to Kennedy's office, chanting,
"The workers united will never be
defeated." The group arrived only to
find that Kennedy was not in his of
fice.
The protesters then sent a delega
tion of four into the outer office.
Chavez, Crouse, Father Eugene
Boyle of the Stanford Newman Cen
ter, and David Stephens, a delivery
man at the medical center, each left a
USW button on the receptionist's
desk.
Twomey later said union members
had been dissatisfied with the old
leadership after the handling of the

1982 strike. New officers were
elected and those officers, including
Crouse, had wanted the change from
Local 715 to Local 680.
Twomey also said the fight be
tween the University and USW is as
much about Crouse as it is about any
thing else.
Kennedy said he had no comment
in response to Twomey unless "he is
referring to internal union
disputes." Kennedy added that Local
715 did not think much of Crouse.
"It is none of his business so long as
she conforms to the conditions for
running for office," added Twomey.
Crouse said later that the Univer
sity had made it clear that it wants
either no union or a union with
"accommodating leadership."
"We don't cut deals. We don't look
the other way about contracting out.
and if a worker has a problem we will
not cut a deal behind his back,"
Crouse said.
In his benediction for the rally,
Boyle quoted Pope John Paul II on
the importance of unions.
"History shows that unions are an
indispensable element of social life,
especially in modern industrial
societies," Boyle said.
Boyle then criticized current atti
tudes toward unions, specifically
Stanford's recent actions toward
Local 680.
"What Pope John Paul II takes for
granted as the right of association
freely exercised guaranteed in a dem
ocratic society is often trampled upon
at this university," Boyle said.
"It is trampled upon in the pursuit
of the profit motive," he added.
Patrick Shields, a member of the
student committee sponsoring the
rally, said the group wanted to let
Stanford workers know that students
understand the workers' contribution
to the University.
