# 300 attend USW rally in White Plaza

Labor leader Cesar Chavez castigated the
University's attempt to "break" the United
Stanford Workers union yesterday, saying his
United Farm Workers would support USW "all
the way."
"It is beyond our understanding how this
prestigious university, this institution of higher
learning, can stoop so low as to try to break this
union," Chavez said.
The organizer of California farm workers
spoke at a "welcome back" rally in White Plaza
yesterday that also featured Education Prof.
Martin Carnoy, a candidate for Congress. The
rally was designed to organize support for USW
before the union's Oct. 30 election.
A majority of the 300 people that attended
the rally followed union leaders in a march from
White Plaza to University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
The event was co-sponsored by USW Local
680, the Service Employees' International
Union (SEIU) and the Student Labor Support
Committee, a group formed in spring to help
USW force the University to recognize Local
680.
Linda Crouse, president of Local 680, said
the rally was a good showing of both workers
and students.
Chavez said Kennedy's actions would affect
the next generation of business leaders.
"We are sincerely concerned about the exam
ple President Kennedy is setting for the students
that will be graduating here and, in time,
leading corporations. Does this mean that they
too will break unions?" he asked.
The farm workers' organizer also said that the
battle over Local 680 could have a detrimental
effect on unions everywhere. "The future of
unions is at stake when the president of such a
prestigious university goes on record against the

union," Chavez said.
Carnoy said USWs problems with Stanford
are symptoms of national problems.
"The Reagan administration is basing its eco
nomic policy on the fact that people should not
have the right to protect themselves either as
workers or consumers," Carnoy said.
Richard Holober, executive secretary of San
Mateo Central Labor Council, pledged the sup
port of the AFL-CIO to Local 680 and joined in
the criticism of the University's conduct.
"Stanford University is a great institution in
many ways, but [its] attitude toward the
workers is a stain on [its] greatness," Holober
said.
"The attitude of the University is the attitude
of 'father knows best,' " he said.
Holober said the union members, not the
University, were in charge of the union. " The
University is demeaning itself by discussing
what is your business. It's none of [its] busi
ness," he said.
Tim Twomey, vice president of SEIU, said at
the rally that his organization believes in local
autonomy. He said the University does not
seem to share that belief.
"Apparently the president of this university
would like to decide who is going to be presi
dent (of the union), or, if who he wants to
become president doesn't, then he is going to
decide not to recognize the union," Twomey
said.
Later, Kennedy denied Twomey's claim.
"Mr Twomey's statement is confused. We want
members of the bargaining unit to vote as to
whether or not they want this particular repre
sentation," he said.
"In taking our position we, of course, consid
ered the quality of 680's leadership —as did the
