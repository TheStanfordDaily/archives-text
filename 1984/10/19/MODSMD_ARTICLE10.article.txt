## Maintain frat housing 
### 
In June, the Task Force to Study Fraternities
and Sororities at Stanford ended six months of
deliberation, deciding that subjectively selective
student groups should not control access to Uni
versity residences. The task force recommended
dissolving current fraternity housing within three
years.
Last year The Daily's editorial board con
curred with the task force's recommendation. But
the new school year brings new members to the
editorial board, and this year's board does not
agree with the task force's recommendation.
Housed fraternities on campus should retain
control of their residences. And the University
should attempt to provide resources — most
notably, rooms for fraternal functions — to un
housed fraternities and to all sororities. In this
way, the University may strive for a more equi
table Greek system.
A strong contingent on our editorial board
argued that fraternities — as a result of subjective
selectivity — promote sexism and elitism. It
should be noted that this criticism was not denied
by the majority. Instead, our decision in favor of
housed fraternities turns on the issue of liberty.
Liberty connotes allowing others to live as they

wish. In this case, the lifestyle offered by housed
fraternities is a liberty we should respect, regard
less of whether that lifestyle meets our approval.
Abolishing fraternity housing will effectively
destroy Greek life on campus. It will terminate
any continuity currently enjoyed in the houses
and will likely cause some national fraternities to
disaffiliate from their Stanford chapters. Also,
fraternities now account for a great deal of social
life here — they throw most of Stanford's large
parties.
The University must recognize the contribu
tion now afforded by fraternities to the entire
Stanford community. Without maintaining fra
ternity housing and thereby the spirit and leader
ship resulting from living together, the University
will lose the very value provided by fraternal or
ganizations that the task force recommended it
acknowledge.
The fraternity lifestyle is not for everyone. But
because we believe Greek life is a liberty that
must be protected, we encourage the University
not to dissolve existing fraternity housing but
rather to work closely with unhoused fraternal
organizations to afford the entire Greek system
University support.
