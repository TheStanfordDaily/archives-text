## Efforts for peace 
### 
President Jose Napoleon Duarte of
El Salvador shook Central America
last week with a proposal for a sum
mit meeting with the rebel forces in
his country. I am really excited about
the new efforts for peace in Central
America. The Contadora nations
have proposed a comprehensive
peace treaty which Nicaragua has
surprisingly accepted, and Honduras
has recently given the U.S. military
the cold shoulder by no longer per
mitting the training of Salvadoran
troops at U.S. bases there. These are
not one or two isolated events, but an
entire trend of Central America turn
ing away from the U.S. gunboat
diplomacy and towards peaceful and
independent resolutions of regional
conflicts.
Mexico, Venezuela, Panama and
Ecuador recently took the initiative
to meet on the island of Contadora to
work out a comprehensive peace
treaty for Central America. The
treaty calls for free, monitored elec
tions and freedom of the press
throughout the Americas. It also pro
vides amnesty for political prisoners.
And most important, it stipulates
the removal of all foreign military ad
visers from the region and bars sup
port for insurgent forces. The Con
tadora Treaty is a clear indication
that Latin America is striving for in
ternal cooperation to end bloodshed
in the region.
The treaty's military reduction
stipulation was primarily aimed at El
Salvador and Nicaragua. In El Sal
vador. the civil war has stretched on
for five years, and more than 50,000
lives have been lost. The stalemate has
continued despite the presence of
U.S. military "advisers," but all of
this is now changing. Duarte met with
rebel forces for the first time
Monday and both sides formed
delegations to negotiate for peace.
Duarte is taking a big risk, as
evidenced by the threats from the far
right. Yet, he is showing the world a

new dedication to negotiations,
human rights and democracy â€” three
values once foreign to Central
America.
These three values are finally
gaining strength in Nicaragua too.
Once the land of the brutal Samoza
dictatorship, Nicaragua now is run by
the more benign, albeit not perfect,
Sandinistas. They have scheduled an
election for Nov. 4. which would un
fortunately not give the opposing par
ties time for a fair chance. However,
negotiations still continue for possibly
postponing the election. This hope is
real because the Sandinistas have
already surprised the world by ac
cepting the Contadora Treaty which
would mean the removal of all
Cuban, Soviet, American and any
other foreign military from the
country. The Sandinistas, in the spirit
of the treaty, seem willing to make
improvements; hut the present U.S.
administration remains the largest
obstacle to these improvements.
Nicaraguan President Daniel Or
tega Saavedra asserts that the
"mercenary forces here exist only to
the extent that the U.S. supports
them. When that support ends, they
will disappear, because they have no
social base." Furthermore, the form
of the present U.S. military presence
in Nicaragua is absolutely intolerable:
the participation of private citizens in
the war, the mining of harbors and
the covert CIA war, which has even
advised the use of political assassina
tion! An all-out U.S. invasion of
Nicaragua, which President Ortega
fears, is also not the solution. How
can we expect Nicaragua to move
toward democracy when the world's
biggest democracy only offers gun
boat diplomacy?
It is only through a well-balanced
policy that we can best prevent the
Soviets from clenching their grip on
Central America. Indeed, the Soviets
should be thwarted, since their grip is
one of oppression no country has ever

escaped, despite tearful efforts in
Poland, East Germany and Czecho
slovakia. Our current over-emphasis
of military "aid" has led Honduras to
severely reduce operations of the
U.S. military in the region. As the
Honduran minister of the interior put it:
"The U.S. thinks that the interven
tion of Marines at any time can solve
political problems with military solu
tions in 24 hours." Well, it just ain't
so; the Marines are not always the so
lution. Military assistance is indeed
necessary in lands where democracy
is new and military coups are the
norm, hut this type of assistance
should be the last resort, not the first.
A combination of economic and poli
tical support should take priority.
Where is Central America's version
of the Marshall Plan, as recom
mended by the Kissinger Report?
Honduran Foreign Minister, Edgardo
Pa/ Baarnica, rightly claims, "We
want American help to stabilize our
political system and our social system.
Without that, our ability to provide
military cooperation with the United
States would be meaningless."
The real meaning of the current
movements toward peace and
democracy in Central America lies in
the region's potential to advance to a
war-free society like Europe has
enjoyed for the past 40 years after
decades of periodic coups and wars.
Duarte's negotiations with the rebels,
Nicaragua's acceptance of the Con
tadora Treaty and Honduras' re
quests for greater non-military assis
tance should all receive full support
from the United States. The resolu
tion of Central America's problems
will not appear overnight, but a bright
ray of hope is now shining. There
ought to be a full-fledged celebration
for these historic advancements in
Central America. I'm psyched.
