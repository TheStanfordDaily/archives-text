Apocalypse now
President Reagan's final words to
the American people during the first
debate were "We have it in our
power to begin the world over
again." This statement might have
some logic behind it if he were not
the incumbent. The only sense I can
make out of it is in reference to
earlier statements such as this quote
from the Jerusalem Post of Oct. 28,
1983: "You know, I turn back to
your ancient prophets in the Old
Testament and the signs foretelling
Armageddon, and I find myself
wondering if — if we're the genera
tion that's going to see that come
about. I don't know if you've noted
any of the prophecies lately, but
believe me, they certainly describe
the times we're going through." In
my conversations with fundamen
talists, it has been made clear to me
that they consider nuclear holocaust
to be God's will in that it will herald
the second coming.
I pray this is not what Reagan
meant by his comment, hut I can
think of no other interpretation. I
ask Reagan supporters to give me a
less apocalyptic interpretation.

Total divestment
There have been frequent press
reports over the last few months on
South Africa. The focus of many of
these is on change in South Africa's
oppressive political system. There
are reports of parliamentary changes
the Nkomati Accord between South
Africa and Mozambique, elections

and an agreement between South
Africa and Angola to reduce hostili
ties in southern Angola and thus
facilitate peace in Namibia. All these
arc billed as reforms in apartheid
and in foreign policy. However, they
are not serious reforms.
The parliamentary changes leave
the vast majority, the blacks, totally
disenfranchised and let Asians and
Coloureds (the South African term
for people of mixed race) into the
parliamentary structure with a
minority of votes. The accords are
made between a threatened, but still
strong, South Africa and black
governed neighboring states
seriously weakened by poor weather
conditions and years of sabotage
from South Africa. Perhaps the best
measure of how the South African
majority is responding to these
changes is the violence which has
erupted this year over discriminatory
education policy and the divide-and
rule tactics of parliamentary reform.
The.recent efforts on the part of
the white regime to stabilize the
volatile political situation not
withstanding, apartheid remains the
only system in the world where
discrimination on the basis of race is
legitimized by constitutional law.
Stanford has invested heavily in
South Africa. It owns $215,378,000
worth of stock in 83 companies
that make money by participating
in the South African system. This
issue has been one of concern for
major campuses across the United
States for the last 10 years. There
have been divestment campaigns on
scores of campuses, with 37 schools
acting to divest from companies and
banks with holdings in South Africa.
Roughly $92,000,000 has been
divested by universities and colleges

in the last decade. It is time for
Stanford to join the list. Total divest
ment should be the goal. A first step
is a "yes" vote on the ASSU referen
dum coming up at the end of Octo
ber. Let the University know that
students as a group are vehementh
opposed to Stanford money being
used to make profits through the
oppression of others in South Africa.

Disqualified man
I was disappointed to find myself
suddenly disqualified from the
feminist movement after reading the
definition of "active feminists" as
"those women who dare challenge
the notion of female subservience"
(The Daily, Oct. 18). Feminist men
like myself play an important, albeit
minor, role in securing a non-sexist
redistribution of power.
Further, I think the lesson to be
learned from the sentence "it is no
accident that uctivc femimsA
(women) . . . are widely regarded as
lesbians" requires clarification. The
insult is not to the labeled woman,
but to homosexuals in general. The
use of lesbian or gay as pejoratives is
not legitimate, and those who at
tempt to insult a feminist woman by
calling her a lesbian reveal only their
own sexual insecurity.
Finally, implicit in the attempt to
insult a woman by calling her a les
bian is the recognition that she is an
independent sexual being, no longer
simply an outlet for male sexual
impulses. That, 1 dare say, is pro
gress.

not legitimate, and those who at
tempt to insult a feminist woman by
calling her a lesbian reveal only their
own sexual insecurity.
Finally, implicit in the attempt to
insult a woman by calling her a les
bian is the recognition that she is an
independent sexual being, no longer
simply an outlet for male sexual
impulses. That, 1 dare say, is pro
gress.

Apocalypse now
President Reagan's final words to
the American people during the first
debate were "We have it in our
power to begin the world over
again." This statement might have
some logic behind it if he were not
the incumbent. The only sense I can
make out of it is in reference to
earlier statements such as this quote
from the Jerusalem Post of Oct. 28,
1983: "You know, I turn back to
your ancient prophets in the Old
Testament and the signs foretelling
Armageddon, and I find myself
wondering if — if we're the genera
tion that's going to see that come
about. I don't know if you've noted
any of the prophecies lately, but
believe me, they certainly describe
the times we're going through." In
my conversations with fundamen
talists, it has been made clear to me
that they consider nuclear holocaust
to be God's will in that it will herald
the second coming.
I pray this is not what Reagan
meant by his comment, hut I can
think of no other interpretation. I
ask Reagan supporters to give me a
less apocalyptic interpretation.

Total divestment
There have been frequent press
reports over the last few months on
South Africa. The focus of many of
these is on change in South Africa's
oppressive political system. There
are reports of parliamentary changes
the Nkomati Accord between South
Africa and Mozambique, elections

and an agreement between South
Africa and Angola to reduce hostili
ties in southern Angola and thus
facilitate peace in Namibia. All these
arc billed as reforms in apartheid
and in foreign policy. However, they
are not serious reforms.
The parliamentary changes leave
the vast majority, the blacks, totally
disenfranchised and let Asians and
Coloureds (the South African term
for people of mixed race) into the
parliamentary structure with a
minority of votes. The accords are
made between a threatened, but still
strong, South Africa and black
governed neighboring states
seriously weakened by poor weather
conditions and years of sabotage
from South Africa. Perhaps the best
measure of how the South African
majority is responding to these
changes is the violence which has
erupted this year over discriminatory
education policy and the divide-and
rule tactics of parliamentary reform.
The.recent efforts on the part of
the white regime to stabilize the
volatile political situation not
withstanding, apartheid remains the
only system in the world where
discrimination on the basis of race is
legitimized by constitutional law.
Stanford has invested heavily in
South Africa. It owns $215,378,000
worth of stock in 83 companies
that make money by participating
in the South African system. This
issue has been one of concern for
major campuses across the United
States for the last 10 years. There
have been divestment campaigns on
scores of campuses, with 37 schools
acting to divest from companies and
banks with holdings in South Africa.
Roughly $92,000,000 has been
divested by universities and colleges

in the last decade. It is time for
Stanford to join the list. Total divest
ment should be the goal. A first step
is a "yes" vote on the ASSU referen
dum coming up at the end of Octo
ber. Let the University know that
students as a group are vehementh
opposed to Stanford money being
used to make profits through the
oppression of others in South Africa.

Disqualified man
I was disappointed to find myself
suddenly disqualified from the
feminist movement after reading the
definition of "active feminists" as
"those women who dare challenge
the notion of female subservience"
(The Daily, Oct. 18). Feminist men
like myself play an important, albeit
minor, role in securing a non-sexist
redistribution of power.
Further, I think the lesson to be
learned from the sentence "it is no
accident that uctivc femimsA
(women) . . . are widely regarded as
lesbians" requires clarification. The
insult is not to the labeled woman,
but to homosexuals in general. The
use of lesbian or gay as pejoratives is
not legitimate, and those who at
tempt to insult a feminist woman by
calling her a lesbian reveal only their
own sexual insecurity.
Finally, implicit in the attempt to
insult a woman by calling her a les
bian is the recognition that she is an
independent sexual being, no longer
simply an outlet for male sexual
impulses. That, 1 dare say, is pro
gress.
