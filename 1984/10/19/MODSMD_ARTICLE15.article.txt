## The 						history of domination and lust 
### 
Current, not inherent. Currently sexism is being
confused with lust. Too many people identify
sexism with more than what it really is, prejudice
against females or an arbitrary stereotype anyone

VIEWPOINT

applies to anyone else on the basis of his or her
gender. Some men and women believe any refer
ence to a female's body is a sexist negation of char
acter, that sexism is not "simply" the derogatory
exploitation of women in advertising, entertain
ment, businesses and homes.
Looks are never a negation of character. The
formation of any character includes how we've
responded to the way society as a whole responded
to our looks. Not being a model myself, I can al
most sympathize with some people's efforts to dis
sociate appearance from character, but it won't
work. Ever.
A million generations ago, or more, men got the
idea that since they were usually stronger than wo
men they might as well control them. When they
got used to the idea they could control women,
even by the implied threat of violence, it became
tacitly etched into male minds that because they
could control them, they must be smarter, better
leaders. Of course, they were wrong; they simply
forgot that they achieved their status from their
forefathers' muscles, not their brains. And from
whence men believed women's submissive souls
were inherent, and of no practical use to men, they
came to value one woman over another only for her
body. Male demand for cooperation and submis
sion was always extended to the male sex impulse
as well. Sexual domination is an effect of physical
domination. Someone dumber and stronger gener
ally didn't argue about feelings (especially when
there were no words for them) with someone
weaker and smarter, when he just wanted to

release his sexual and violent tensions. That is rape.
Males didn't have to learn to be compassionate and
the majority were too complacent to learn. In that
respect men were cursed by their own brawn.
But sexist oppression is not lust; it is ignorance
on a man's part about how to be emotionally inti
mate with a partner, and on many men's parts
about how to deal with lust during the workday.

But lust is not the culprit, and if it is commonly
scapegoated for some men's simplicity, then all
men feel unjustly suppressed tor something that
should be celebrated. Lust is the desire to be with
another.
Only within the last few generations, first in
America, have men been forced to learn. Women
understood they had the same potential as males,
and that by turning themselves into a single faction,
they could be the most powerful faction in the na

tion. They wanted all forms of male oppression dis
solved and demanded to he considered for their
whole character and not just the sexual aspect of it,
especially not the sexual aspect. Sexual abuse, in
timately associated with lust, had been the most
degrading effect of male domination, and so was a
primary target to dissolve. But the way some wo
men chose to make men ashamed of sexual abuse
was to make them ashamed of lust. The feminist
movement does not generally promote that rheto
ric, but some feminists do, and they are wrong to.
The effect of blaming sexism and rape on male lust
is that males who could otherwise learn to respect
women and be compassionate with lovers, continue
to call them "stupid bitches" and dismiss the entire
movement. The same men will continue to believe
that lust causes rape, and that rape might be fun.
This won't-go on for long, maybe a generation or
two, with the more men that are educated about
sexism and about rape, but it could end even
quicker if the feminists who now express nothing
but rage and call for censorship when a male con
siders appearance at all could instead concentrate
on teaching equality with all the emotion the topic
deserves.
Militant feminists are dumb. If that sentence of
fends anyone, it shouldn't. There is no such thing as
a militant feminist, no feminist group that adv
ocates the violent overthrow of men. If anyone
does consider him or herself actually militant about
the present inequality of women, he has to rethink
how he wants to help solve the problem of sexism.
I'm including this as an example of how we have to
understand what our fellow human beings mean by
certain words, literally, figuratively and ironically,
before we hate them.
I'm for anything that pisses people off and gets us
to talk to each other.
