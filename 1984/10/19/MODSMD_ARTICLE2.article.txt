# State Dept. alters decision
## May send speaker to campus for El Salvador symposium 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE 
The State Department, changing its mind for the
second time, has announced it will probably send a
speaker to a Stanford symposium on El Salvador.
Barbara Boiler, California program officer in the
Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, confirmed yester
day that her office will do its best to send a speaker to
defend the Reagan administration's El Salvador
policies in the Oct. 30 debate.
Asst. History Prof. Michael Kazin has been trying
since mid-September to have a Reagan administration
spokesperson participate in the symposium.
Kazin said he spoke with Janice Barbieri in the Of
fice of Public Diplomacy early in the quarter. At first,
he said, Barbieri indicated she "didn't see any prob
lem" with sending someone to the debate. But on Oct.
5, Barbieri informed Kazin the office would not be
able to send a speaker.
According to Kazin, the cause for the change was
bad feeling toward a speaker already scheduled to par
ticipate. Kazin said Barbieri told him no one from her
office wanted to attend the symposium after she
learned that Raymond Bonner, a former New York
Times reporter, would share the platform.
Bonner, a former foreign correspondent for The
Times, is the author of "Weakness and Deceit: U.S.
Policy in El Salvador." Bonner's book, Kazin said, is
critical of the administration's foreign policy in El Sal
vador. Bonner "believes war (in El Salvador) would
not continue the way it has without American sup
port," Kazin explained.
Barbieri said only a few of the limited number ol

speakers from the Office of Public Diplomacy were
qualified and available to speak at such a debate. "It
takes a good debate person," Barbieri said, adding that
it requires "a little hit different skill than j'ist being up
on the issues."
But Barbieri admitted that none of the speakers
available wanted to share a platform with Bonner.
"The sense I got was that Mr. Bonner's reporting
was not ... the most accurate on earth; in fact, far
from it in certain cases," Barbieri said, stressing that
her statement was not "an official State Department
position in any way."
Following the Office of Public Policy's rejection of
Kazin's request, it looked as though there would not be
an administration representative at the symposium.
But Kazin said he contacted Boiler on Wednesday
and was told "she thought they should send some
body."
Boiler confirmed today that "we think we're going
to send you a very good person." The Bureau of Inter-
American Affairs plans to send Mike Skol, the
bureau's deputy director of policy planning, to the
symposium, pending Skol's acceptance of the invita
tion. Kazin said he will contact Skol this weekend or
early next week for his decision.
Regarding the earlier refusal to send a speaker. Boi
ler said, "It was always just a question of officer
resource time." In the bureau, there are only seven of
ficers available to speak across the country, she said.
