## Pac-10 'Dangerfield' to play Cardinal 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The Washington State University
football team is the Rodney Danger
field of the Pacific 10 Conference. It
gets no respect.
The Cougars finished last season
with five straight wins, including a
season-ending victory over the Uni
versity of Washington that knocked
the Huskies out of the Rose Bowl.
Washington State finished third in the
Pac-10 with a 7-4 record and went
nowhere.
What was worse, no one this side of
the Washington-Oregon border
seemed to care.

This season, Washington State
hoped to shake its Dangerfield image
with a more difficult schedule — it
played at Ohio State, at Tennessee, at
home against USC and at UCLA in
its first six games. The Cougars, who
play Stanford tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
at Stanford Stadium, lost all four of
those games and any respect they
might have won last season.
But it's not so much the losses
(Washington State is 2-4 overall and
0-2 in the Pac-10) that have made
outspoken Coach Jim Walden "feel
shitty."
Rather, it's the way the Cougars
have been losing. In fact, so frustrat

ing were the Cougars' two Pac-10
losses (29-27 to USC and 27-24 to
UCLA last Saturday) that Walden
rambled on about them via telephone
at Stanford's press conference Mon
day.
"I can't tell you how I really feel,"
Walden said, "because you couldn't
print all the four-letter words.
"Maybe it's a lack of confidence on
our part that we don't overcome the
feeling that we can't play with the
teams in this league until it's too
late," he continued. "We get so far
behind and then start thinking that
we can play with them. Then we come
back and then we lose it in the final
seconds."
Two weeks ago against USC, the
Cougars hibernated in the first half
and found themselves behind, 20-0,
in the third quarter and 29-13 in the
fourth. But, thanks to quarterback
Mark Rypien's four second-half
touchdown passes, Washington State
closed the gap to 29-27 with 1:27 left.
However, a missed two-point conver
sion attempt after the final touch
down gave USC the victory.
Last weekend in the Rose Bowl,
the Cougars did it again. This time,
they roared back from an early deficit
to tie UCLA at 24. And with 52
seconds remaining, they had a chance
to win on a 44-yard field goal, but a
bad center snap ended those aspira
tions. Instead, it was UCLA that
kicked the winning field goal, a 47-
yarder by John Lee as time ran out.
"We have to figure out a way to
play a whole game and play intense a
whole game," Walden said. "So far,
we've played about 35 minutes of in
tense football each game.
"We get ourselves into positions
where we can win or tie games and we
still screw up," he continued. "When
we get into a position of winning a
game, this team just can't do it. That's
coaching and 1 feel shitty about it."
Walden wasn't the only coach get
ting laughs at Monday's press confer
ence. Stanford Coach Jack Elway, a
1953 graduate of Washington State,
got in a few jokes of his own.
Elway played football his first year
at Washington State, but three opera
tions, two on his knee and one on his
shoulder, ended his career his sopho
more season. Elway returned to Pull
man and was an assistant football
coach from 1972-75.
"It was so long ago that when the
game was over, you would fold up

your helmet and put it your back
pocket," Elway said of his playing
days. He was the starting quarterback
on the freshman team, but injuries
prevented him from playing varsity.-
Elway said he has "fond
memories" of Washington State, and
not all on the football field. "I was
vice president of the SAE (fraternity)
house," he recalled, "but I got im
peached after a month because I let
some guys into the refrigerator when
I shouldn't have."
All jokes will stop tomorrow at
1:30 p.m. Both teams are coming off
losses and both need a victory to get
their seasons back on track.
Ironically, it was a road triumph in
the seventh game that put the
Cougars on track last season after a
2-4 start. Washington State jour
neyed to Sun Devil Stadium, arguably
one of the toughest places to play in
the country, and returned to Pullman
with a 33-21 victory over Arizona
State University.
Washington State didn't stop there.
After three more Pac-10 victories, it

defeated Washington in Seattle, and
many called the Cougars the best
team in the Pac-10 at season's end.
Walden probably has enough talent
on offense for a repeat performance.
Rypien, a junior quarterback who
runs as well as he passes, is leading
the Pac-10 in total offense, averaging
202.5 yards per game. Running back
Rueben Mayes, averaging 107.5
yards per game, is the Pac-10's
second-leading rusher.
"It's obvious that Washington
State is a good football team and will
present some problems for us," El
way said. "They've got some balance.
They can run and throw the football.
They've also shown that they can
come back. The (Stanford) defensive
coaches think they might be as good
an offensive team as we've faced so
far."
The Washington State defense,
however, is a different story.
Although the Cougars are ranked
fourth in pass defense in the Pac-10,
they are ranked last in rushing
defense, total defense and scoring

defense. The Cougars are giving up
an average of 383.7 yards and 31.3
points per game.
When the two teams meet tomor
row, they will be playing each other
for the first time since 1982, and for
the first time in Stanford Stadium
since 1977. Stanford holds a 20-16-1
lead in the series, and has won the
past eight.
Nevertheless, Walden said he en
joys playing Stanford, especially at
Stanford. "I love Stanford," he said.
"I'd love to coach there. I'm looking
forward to seeing that guy dressed up
as a tree."
Card notes
If you thought last week's crowd of
44,500 looked small in 84,795-seat
Stanford Stadium, wait until you see
tomorrow's. Only 33,000 are ex
pected — if it doesn't rafin.
Tailback Thomas Henley, who
bruised his left shoulder against
UCLA, practiced Wednesday and
yesterday and is listed as probable for
tomorrow's game.
