# 18 teams to play in golf tourney here

### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's golf team will host the 54-hole
Stanford Fall All-Intercollegiate Tournament today and
tomorrow at the par-71, 6,835-yard Stanford Golf
Course.
The event features what Coach Tim Schaaf said "is
one of the two best fields of the fall season."
"Almost everybody good west of Oklahoma" will be on
hand this weekend, Schaaf said. That includes Brigham
Young University, Weber State University, the University
of Missouri and UCLA. Defending champion USC, last
year's Pacific 10 Conference winner, will try to protect the
championship it won here last year.

Besides the usual drama associated with major col
legiate golf events, Schaaf said this tournament might of
fer an element of surprise.
"A dozen teams have a chance to win from a very
strong intersectional group," he said.
"Eight of the 18 teams competing here were invited to
last year's NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion) spring tournament," reflecting the quality of this
weekend's field, Schaaf said.
In addition, the tournament features "the kind of field
we (the Cardinal golfers) will have to beat to get to the na
tionals," Schaaf said.
Although most people consider golf a spring sport, it is
an "all-year sport" and "everything counts from begin
ning to end," Schaaf said. The Stanford tournament thus

will have a strong bearing upon the selection process for
the NCAA's spring finale. Head-to-head competition
among Western Regional schools weighs heavily in that
selection process.
This season, the Cardinal men have had mixed results in
their three fall-season tournaments. Second-place
finishes in the Wolfpack Invitational at Lake Tahoe and
the Americana Classic at Lake Geneva, Wis. and a
"respectable" fifth-place showing at the Louisiana State
University Invitational in Baton Rouge, La. leave the
Cardinal still looking for its first victory of this season.
Schaaf hopes to exploit the home-course advantage and
improve upon last year's third-place finish in the tourna
ment. Seniors Tim Robinson, Scott Erickson and Doug

Thompson and junior Carl Wagner are the top four on
Stanford's six-man roster. John Dickey, his brother Lew,
Cole Thompson and Don Walsworth are contending for
the two remaining slots.
After the tournament this weekend, the men will travel
to the 54-hole University of the Pacific Invitational Mon
day and Tuesday at Lodi. There, the Cardinal will con
front many of the same teams that will compete in the
Stanford tournament. Two weeks later, the Cardinal men
will travel to Thousand Oaks for the Southwestern Inter
collegiate Tournament at North Ranch Country Club.
These three tournaments, the final outings of the fall
season, are the "three stiffest challenges" the Card will
face, Schaaf said.
