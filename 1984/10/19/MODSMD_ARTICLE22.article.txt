# Stanford to play 6th-rated SDSU
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team might have discovered its po
tential in its three-game victory over
UCLA Wednesday night, and the
Cardinal could establish more mo
mentum if it defeats San Diego State
University tonight.
"The match (against UCLA) was
clearly our best all-around perfor
mance," Cardinal Head Coach Fred
Sturm said. "The players found they
could believe in themselves. .. . They
saw what can happen when we play to
our peak capacities. It was an oppor
tunity for the players just to learn
about themselves and see what
they're capable of doing."
The Cardinal's triumph "was very
pleasing," said Sturm, who praised
the setting of senior Deidra Dvorak
and freshman Wendi Rush.

"Our setters did a good job of
moving the ball. They kept the
(UCLA) block off balance. Usually,
UCLA's blocking is excellent. . . .
Our setters weren't going to the same
spots every time. They kept the
(UCLA) defense where it should be
â€” on the defensive."
Tonight brings Stanford's second
important match of this week, this
time against San Diego State, 6-0 in
the Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation. The Cardinal, 5-1 in the
WCAA and ranked fourth in the na
tion, beat the Aztecs in two WCAA
matches and in the regional finals last
season. The victory in the regionals
gave the Cardinal a spot in the top
four at the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association championships.
