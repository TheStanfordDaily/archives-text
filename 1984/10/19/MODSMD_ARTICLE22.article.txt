# Stanford to play 6th-rated SDSU
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team might have discovered its po
tential in its three-game victory over
UCLA Wednesday night, and the
Cardinal could establish more mo
mentum if it defeats San Diego State
University tonight.
"The match (against UCLA) was
clearly our best all-around perfor
mance," Cardinal Head Coach Fred
Sturm said. "The players found they
could believe in themselves. .. . They
saw what can happen when we play to
our peak capacities. It was an oppor
tunity for the players just to learn
about themselves and see what
they're capable of doing."
The Cardinal's triumph "was very
pleasing," said Sturm, who praised
the setting of senior Deidra Dvorak
and freshman Wendi Rush.

"Our setters did a good job of
moving the ball. They kept the
(UCLA) block off balance. Usually,
UCLA's blocking is excellent. . . .
Our setters weren't going to the same
spots every time. They kept the
(UCLA) defense where it should be
— on the defensive."
Tonight brings Stanford's second
important match of this week, this
time against San Diego State, 6-0 in
the Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation. The Cardinal, 5-1 in the
WCAA and ranked fourth in the na
tion, beat the Aztecs in two WCAA
matches and in the regional finals last
season. The victory in the regionals
gave the Cardinal a spot in the top
four at the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association championships.

place in the WCAA, it is ranked No.
6 in the nation by this week's Tac
hikara Coaches poll. "San Diego
(State) started out ranked 10th, but
then they beat UCLA and USC early
in the season to take first place,"
Asst. Coach Don Shaw said. "The
wins weren't quite enough to con
vince the coaches in the poll, though.
UCLA and USC may have had off
nights. . . . The rankings aren't that
crucial to us — we know they are a
good team."
Leading the Aztec attack are
outside hitter Angela Rock, middle
blocker Linda Eihlers, and setter Kim
Takacs. "Angela Rock jumps very
well," Shaw said. Sturm said, "She
can hit the ball well from any posi
tion, including the backcourt." At 6-
foot-4, Eihlers is one of the confer
ence's tallest players.
Takacs is "one of the finest setters
in the country," according to Sturm.
Takacs, a senior transfer from Pep
perdine University, was a United
States Volleyball Association first
team All-America selection last
season. "She's quick and can be
deceptive. They (the Aztecs) play a
5-1 offense, and we have to be aware
when the setter is in the front row,"
Sturm said.
