# Field hockey Card in Cal Invitational
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
There are two keys to Stanford's
earning a berth in the National Col
legiate Athletic Association hockey
playoffs, according to Coach Onnie
Killefer.
"We have to stay healthy and win."
For the Cardinal to remain healthy,
Killefer is hoping to avoid days like
last Friday, when the severe
ness of a back injury to senior
forward Jen Bleakley was discovered
in practice. On the next day the Card
lost 1-0 to the University of the
Pacific.
Killefer didn't know yesterday
whether Bleakley would be able to
play with Stanford in the Cal Invita
tional, which begins in Berkeley
today and continues through Sunday.
Stanford is scheduled to play its
tournament opener against San Jose
State today at noon.

Bleakley's status "will be a factor,"
Killefer said. "Jen's our primary
playmaker. We'll need her to do well
tomorrow."
With Bleakley in its lineup, Stan
ford lost to San Jose State, 10-3,
Sept. 22. San Jose State is currently
leading the Northern Pacific Confer
ence, Stanford is second and Univer
sity of the Pacific, one of six teams in
the Cal Invitational, is third.
This time, however, Killefer is opti
mistic about the Cardinal's chances
against San Jose State.
"I think we're capable of beating
them," she said. "We're looking for
ward to playing San Jose on Astroturf
because they won't be as effective.
"Astroturf allows the ball to run
true. We're better ballhandlers than
they are. They have a tendency to hit
the ball hard, and if they do, it'll go
off the field."
