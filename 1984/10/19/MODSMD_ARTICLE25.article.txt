## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The second-ranked Stanford water
polo team will attempt to raise its
Pacific 10 Conference record to 3-0
this afternoon when it faces UCLA at
3 p.m. in DeGuerre Pool.
Stanford will also he playing to
morrow in DeGuerre, against fifth
ranked University of California,
Irvine at 10:30 a.m.
The Cardinal is 1-1 this season
against hoth the Bruins, 11-7-1 over
all, and the Anteaters, 11-6-1. Coach
Dante Dettamanti said the Cardinal
will be working to win both season se
ries this weekend, since this is the last
time the Cardinal will be playing
either team before the National Col
legiate Athletic Association cham
pionships.
Because the game against UCLA
will be a Pac-10 match, Dettamanti
said his team will be competing very
seriously.
"If we win this game, our league
record will be 3-0 and we will au
tomatically be eligible to compete in
the NCAA championships," Detta
manti said. "UCLA is the hardest
team in the league to figure out as far
as its style of play, and it will certainly
not be any easy team to beat."
According to Dettamanti, the
Bruins follow an uncommon
European offense and also have a
strong tendency to use unusual defen
sive plays.
"If we don't take over early in the
game, we will have to fight through
out the match," Dettamanti said.
"Once the Bruins get into a game,
they don't let up."
The Cardinal will also be facing
tough competition tomorrow against
Irvine. Stanford lost, 7-6, to the
Anteaters last weekend in the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association/Pac-10

Tournament, and Dettamanti said
this weekend's game could be just as
close.
"Irvine has given us more trouble
over the years than any other team in
the nation," Dettamanti said. "They
have a very strong holeman and two
very talented drivers, J.R. Salvatore
and Stefano Rossi. Our defense will
really have to work at stopping those

two players."
The Cardinal also has strong
players who probably will play impor
tant roles in both games. Sophomore
David Imbernino leads Stanford in
scoring with 41 goals. He is followed
by junior Jamie Velez with 39, soph
omore Craig Klass with 26 and fresh
man Erich Fisher with 16. Senior
Steve Moyer is the team's leading
goalie with 130 saves this season.
