# Cardinal to battle last-place Tigers
## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's soccer team
will try to rebound from Wednesday
night's 4-0 loss to the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas when rt plays a
conference match against the Univer
sity of the Pacific in Stockton tomor
row afternoon.
UOP is tied for last in the Pacific
Soccer Conference with an 0-3
record, and is 2-10 this season. The
Tigers have scored eight goals in 12
games while allowing 28. Tl>ey had a

strong showing at the University of
California, Berkeley Wednesday,
losing, 2-1, to the Bears, who are 3-0
in the PSC, 11-3 overall, and ranked
16th in the nation.
The Cardinal is second in the PSC
behind three teams — Cal, Fresno
State, and the University of San Fran
cisco — who are tied for first and un
defeated. Stanford is 2-1 in the PSC
and 7-5-4 overall.
Senior striker Giancarlo Ferruzzi,
the Cardinal's leading scorer, is fifth
in the PSC in scoring with four goals

and eight assists for 16 points.
Midfielder/forward Rob West and
Tom Rafalovich, a fullback, have
each scored four goals.
Rafalovich is tied for first with Fer
ruzzi and West in team goal scoring
despite playing sweeper, the last line
of defense except for the goalkeeper.
"I go up on all set (dead ball) plays,
on all the corners and free kicks 1
can," Rafalovich said. "I'm fairly
good in the air (heading the ball),
which is why I've scored my goals."
Despite UOP's record, Rafalovich,
whose twin brother Todd starts at
forward, is wary of the Tigers.
"We've had difficulty with them in
the past for some reason," Tom
Rafalovich said. "We seem to play
down to teams like UOP and St.
Mary's. We don't get up for the
games as much [as we do forj teams
like UCLA."
But Tom Rafalovich thinks that
might change after Stanford's loss to
UNLV, a game he called "tough to
lose." Rafalovich said, "We shouldn't
have that much problem getting up
this game (against UOP) because of
what happened against UNLV."
The four goals UNLV scored
raised senior goalkeeper Willy
Burkhardt's goals-against average to
1.46. However, one goal got into the
net with the help of a tricky wind, and
he got a hand on another shot that hit
the post and went in. Burkhardt is
still fourth among PSC goalkeepers.
The Cardinal faces perhaps its most
crucial test of this season Tuesday
when the perennially strong USF
Dons visit Stanford's Malonev Field.
