Just down the street from campus,
Chung King Royal serves fine Szech
uan cuisine, a somewhat spicier ver
sion of typical Chinese fare.
On Chung King's menu, these
spicier recipes are distinguished by a
symbol to the left of the Chinese
characters preceding the English
translation of each item. If you order
one of these dishes, the cooks prom-

ise to alter the spice to suit your taste.
Whenever you eat Chinese food,
there are few surprises. You begin
with tea, and proceed to eat a variety
of dishes guaranteed to satisfy your
hunger, and when the check is
brought to your table, you will always
be given a fortune cookie with only
good things to say about you or your
future.
The hosts in Chinese restaurants
are typically congenial, though
usually they aren't very talkative, and
the decor is simple and unorna
mented. Even prices among the
various restaurants are comparable.
Chung King is all of the above. The
restaurant offers a large selection of
dishes, and the service is commend
able. The waiters serve water with
out your having to ask for it, and they
also serve beer, wine and soft drinks.
But perhaps the most important
aspect of Chung King is its proximity
to campus. Especially if you live in

Escondido, Manzanita or Mirrielees,
you can't beat it. Just past Sundance
Mine Company and the Recyclery,
Chung King is the golden building
with blue awnings on the corner of El
Camino Real and College Avenue.
The menu features combination
dinners starting at $3.50, gourmet
dinners for $5.95 and $6.95 and a
$7.99 seafood special.
If you prefer to order single dishes,
the choice is extensive. Chung King
serves the traditional kinds of ap
petizers and soups (you can order a
large bowl of soup, or a smaller cup
for only 75 cents). Cold plates include
chicken salad ($4.95), Ma Lai
Chicken or bun bun chicken (both
$4.75).
I ordered the chicken salad, which
was very good. Mixed throughout the
greens were crumbled won tons,
crackling noodles and tender, well
seasoned pieces of chicken. I was dis
appointed that there was no sauce,
but I would still recommend this dish
if you are a salad eater.
Also served is mu shu chicken and
mu shu pork â€” both come with six
pancakes for $4.95. Specialties in
clude lobster with garlic and black
bean sauce, dry braised lobster, tea
smoked chicken and sweet and sour
fish. The lobster dishes are the most
expensive at $9.50.
As you might expect, you can also
order sweet and sour pork ($4.50).
Seafood lovers might want to opt for
sweet and sour shrimp ($5.50). Large
shrimp, fried and cut in half, are
served with onions, pineapple and
green peppers.
Chow mein and chow fun cost
$3.25 or $3.50. Chung King chow
mein is cooked with shrimp, pork,
chicken and vegetables. Also on the
menu are a variety of soup noodles,
foo yung, vegetables and fried rice.
If you can't find the beverage list,
look under desserts; both Coke and
7-Up are sold. Though not on the
menu, the waiter asked if we would
like wine or beer.
Chung King Royal is open every
day except Mondays. The restaurant
also welcomes take-out orders.
