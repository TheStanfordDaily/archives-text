### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
A protest against the suggested lo
cation of an "interfaith chapel' arose
this week following University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's approval of
the chapel proposal.
The chapel's proposed site between
Memorial Church and Building 50 of
the Quad violates architect Frederick
Law Olmsted's original plan, accord

candidate in art history here.
According to Koskovich, Art Prot.
Paul Turner agrees that the proposed
chapel site represents "a serious
threat to the architectural integrity of

Hamerton-Kelly's proposal for
the "interfaith chapel" to serve the
needs of Jewish and other religious
groups came at Yom Kippur services
on Oct. 5. Later, he announced Ken
nedy's approval of the plan.
Vojka Ivanek, project manager for
the proposed chapel, said she would
find an architect for the project, but
noted that nothing had been done

"I haven't even started yet,
Ivanek said. "I'll first have to see
what our funding looks like."
Kennedy said last week that the
project would not progress without
money. It is currently in the early
planning stages, he said.
According to Koskovich, the open
space between Memorial Church and
Building 50 is as much a part of the
Quad as are the buildings themselves.
"I think it's time the University
took the position that parts of the
campus are sacred and should be off-
