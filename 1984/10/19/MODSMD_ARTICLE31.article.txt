There are a lot of places Stanford
students go to convince themselves
how cool they are, places where they
flaunt their Stanford sweatshirts in
front of unimpressed townies or Paly
High new wavers.
There are a lot of other restaurants
that Stanford students visit to show
each other how cool they are, places
where they can throw out 50 or 60
bucks for a couple of French dinners
that are completely third-rate but oh
so-continental.
What there aren't a lot of, though,
are places where you can escape both
the Stanford sweatshirt and the
Ouality Mart-trenchcoat crowds and
eat good food at reasonable prices in
an environment completely lacking in
prefabricated Peninsula pretensions.
Cho's is such a place, and that's
why it hurts so much to write this
review.
Located nearby, on California Av
enue, Cho's is smack dab in the
middle of modern Palo Alto, but
somehow it misses out on everything
that's wrong about most of the places
around it.
The post-punk, punked-out, MTV
weaned Paly kids ("We dress,
therefore we are") tend to skip Cho's
for one of the infinitely more chic
croissant-and-cappuccino joints, and
the Stanford crowd heads for Kirk's
or Antonio's Nut House.
Who eats at Cho's, then? A lot of
Asian-speaking neigborhood folks,
the less trendy Paly kids, a good num
ber of area businessmen, police,
shoppers and a handful of Stanford
students.
And it's certainly for the best that
the crowds aren't flocking to Cho's,
because there's no room for them
there. In the 10-foot-by-1 0-foot
streetside eating area, Cho's offers
space for six diners at any one time,
and even that's pushing it. Three tiny
tables is it.
And Cho's kitchen, all 10 square
feet of it, isn't really equipped for
production-line food preparation for
the masses.

Cho (we presume that's who takes
the orders; he doesn't speak much
English) and his wife (again, a
presumption) prepare all the food
themselves, with the help of modern
appliances like a gas stove and a
couple of cast-iron frying pans. The
process isn't the speediest in the
world, but who's counting?
And if the food takes a couple of
minutes, it's still worth it.
For anybody who's ever had the
craving to just sit down and eat a
whole plate of potstickers and blow
off the rest of a Chinese meal, this is
the place to be. For $2.10, Cho's of
fers six plump potstickers, stuffed full
of meat and mysterious Oriental
vegetables, served with a bowl of red
sauce that's best left alone. These
items, usually considered appetizers
elsewhere, are more than enough for
a meal here.
Another Cho's specialty is the dim
sum bun. Barbeque Pork Buns,
Vegetable Pork Buns, Smashed Bean
Buns (I know that one sounds a little
scary) and Lotus Seed Paste Buns all
sell for 47 cents each. The buns, little
mountains of steamed white dough
filled with the appropriate meat or
vegetables, are a little bland, but tasty
and very filling, and without question
the best food buy in the area.
Cho's egg rolls are just egg rolls,
nothing terribly special, except that
they'll only set you back six bits.
Cho's Won Ton Soup, however, is
amazing at $1.85 a bowl. Unlike
similar offerings at other Chinese
places, Cho's concocotion is more
won ton than soup â€” eight big balls
of dough-wrapped meat. Again, a
meal in itself.
Unbridled enthusiasm is a rare
thing in these parts (mindless spite is
more in this reviewer's style), but
Cho's really deserves it.
One caution: Cho's maintains the
strangest restaurant hours there are.
The restaurant is open daily from
11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., with addi
tional hours from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m.
on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
Cho's is closed completely on Tues
days.
No Dean Fred legwarmers, please.
