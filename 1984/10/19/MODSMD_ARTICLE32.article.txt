# Guilt and lousy fortunes at Ming's
## Spare spareribs at an oh-so- ethnic establishment

Ming's is a big place.
When you first walk in, you don't
walk into a restaurant, exactly.
There's a large, ornate waiting room
with heavy Oriental furniture and dis
play cases full of Orientalia and
impressive-looking porcelains. You
can't see any diners.
Ming's is definitely an escapist res
taurant; this is no Universery
Creamery where you can sit in the
window and watch the mohawks
bob down toward the New Varsity.
One gets the feeling here that one is
very, very far away from El Camino
Real. However, although escaping
from Stanford happens to be one of
my favorite pastimes, Ming's prob
ably isn't the first place I would go.
Sitting in the center of a relatively
large dining room, filled with tables
just a bit too small to be really com
fortable, my partner and I sampled as
much as we could possibly swallow of
Ming's fare; our meal consisted of
soup, appetizers, several entrees and
the industry-standard fortune cookie
dessert. The food was brought to us
fairly quickly — but then, we were
eating early and the restaurant wasn't
too crowded.
The won ton soup ($5), our first
course, was salty but had a lot of won
ton extant. We were given a fairly
large bowl.
Egg rolls ($6.25) and barbequed
spareribs ($6.75) were considerably
less plentiful — the egg rolls were
probably the best I've had this side of
Chinatown, but a little on the oily
side. The spareribs were spare. One
of them refused to admit to being a

sparerib at all, preferring instead to
remain a bone bathed in a delectable
sauce, yet devoid of meat.
We had three different types of
entrees — lemon chicken ($7.50),
beef cubes with Chinese vegetables
($14.50), and prawns in garlic sauce
($9.75). These were served hot from
the kitchen, in wonderful profusion,
and we began eating eagerly.
This is the tricky part. Here 1 was,
eating this beautiful food, in this
beautiful restaurant, far from the El
Camino and miles from the Farm,
and yet — there was something about
the Ming's experience that was
grating to me. And I was feeling
damn guilty about it.
The entrees, in my blunt and not
overly refined opinion, were over
spiced. At first 1 thought they didn't
fit well together, but then 1 decided
they were just minutely too heavy
and saucy. It's hard to explain.'One

bite tasted wonderful, two bites less
than wonderful, and a plateful left me
slightly awry.
The lemon chicken was perhaps my
least favorite; it was too sweet. The
beef, with apologies to Goldilocks,
was a little too salty and the prawns
were just a little hot. I really did like
the prawns, though. By themselves,
with a fair amount of rice, they would

have been just fine.
Back to Guilt. This is a pretty
place, and if you like to watch people
who go to Chinese retuarants, you get
a veritable panorama of large Orien
tal families fighting over the check.
Also a lot of the Real People who live
outside of Stanford and are members
of the Work Force. In other words,
this ain't exactly a student hangout.
So maybe what I was feeling was
displacement. As a student, one has
the run of lots of fun, noisy places
with fun and noisy people, and when
that gets tiresome, there are always
dark and smoky rooms. Maybe
Ming's was disquieting because it
made me realize that it serves a ne
cessary fuction in the community — a
large, successful, well-known Place
To Go that just happens to have an
Oriental mien. The food may not be
wonderful, but the service is reliable,
the dining room is clean, and one can

discuss Dow Jones aptly while feeling
oh-so-slightly ethnic. Who am I to
condemn such a formidable (is the
word overbearing?) establishment?
Just don't go here if you know all the
waiters at Hamburger Mary's.
Good Tea. Good Bar. I got a lousy
fortune.
