When I first learned that I was going to review a
Chinese restaurant, my immediate reaction was to dis
cover what type of cuisine the restaurant served. For the
uninitiated, Chinese restaurants are usually divided into
two groups: Cantonese and Mandarin/Szechuan/Hunan.
China Lion, specializing in good if not outstanding
Mandarin and Szechuan cuisine, falls into the latter cate
gory. This type of cuisine emphasizes hot and spicy food, a
favorite of ours.
As we drove up to the restaurant, we noticed that there
were no cars in the parking lot. Chinese restaurants com
monly close on Mondays, and we thought China Lion was
no exception.
But to our surprise, the restaurant was open. There
were, however, very few people there, and this held true
for the rest of the evening.
Chinese restaurants' decors usually range from the non
existent to the gaudy. China Lion managed to fall some
where in between. There were several Oriental water
colors on the walls, and there was even a rickshaw tucked
in a corner of the outdoor portion of the restaurant.

We were somewhat disap
pointed with the hot and
sour soup: While it was
sour, it was not hot enough
in either the flavor or tem
perature sense.

Though most of the restaurant was tastefully decorated,
my friend and I decided that the Christmas lights outside
and the beer plaques inside had to go.
However, none of this concerned us once we were pre
sented with our menus. China Lion offers a fairly exten
sive list of dishes, ranging from appetizers and soups to
house specialties. The menu also lists some group dinners,
but I'd advise choosing each dish individually.

Several of the dishes are actually Cantonese, but there
are many authentic Mandarin and Szechuan dishes as
well.
We started off with an order of potstickers ($3.25). Al
though officially a Cantonese dish, potstickers have
become so popular that all Chinese restaurants invariably
serve them.
We found the potstickers — Chinese dumplings with
ground pork and vegetables — quite tasty, with a fragrant
aroma. The potstickers weren't quite crisp enough on the
outside, but that was not a major complaint.
After the potstickers, we were served hot and sour soup
($3.50). This soup, when properly prepared, is not for the
faint-hearted. The dish consists of a hearty beef or
chicken broth base filled with pieces of shrimp, bamboo,
eggs and chopped pork. The soup is topped off with white
pepper and vinegar, which give it the "hot-and-sour"
flavor.
We were somewhat disappointed with the soup: While
it was sour, it was not hot enough in either flavor or tem
perature. The soup was served to us lukewarm and its hot
"kick" was definitely missing.
However, we were much more pleased by the entrees.
We selected mu shu pork ($5.50) — a Mandarin dish with
sliced pork, eggs and vegetables served with Mandarin
pancakes. Plum sauce and onions enhance the flavor of
this dish.
We found China's Lion's mu shu pork very good; in ad
dition, the servings were more than generous.
I was even more pleased by the second dish, Kung Pao
Chicken ($5.75). This dish consists of diced chicken that is
stir fried with dried chili peppers, roasted peanuts and
vegetables.

Kung Pao Chicken is a very strongly spiced dish that
usually requires lots of rice to accompany it. My friend
and I both enjoyed China Lion's version of this dish very
much, although he complained about the lavish dose of
ginger. We both decided that the use of zucchini (instead
of the customary green peppers) detracted from the dish.
Overall, however, it was excellent.
China Lion is a nice place to go with friends if you're
looking for a good, relatively inexpensive Chinese meal:
Entrees here are very reasonably priced, ranging from
$5.50 for the average entree to $16 for duck. The service

is also very good: Our waiter was very friendly, if a little
rushed.
China Lion serves lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
daily. Dinner is offered from 4:30 to 9:30 p.m. Monday
through Friday, and from 4:30 to 10 p.m. on weekends.
The restaurant also offers a take-out service.
