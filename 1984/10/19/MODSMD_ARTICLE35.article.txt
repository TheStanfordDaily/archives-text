### 
Hamlet (1948)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Laurence Olivier's version. Shake
speare scholars cavil — justifiably — at
the transformation of the soliloquies into
interior monologues, and at the omission
of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, For
tinbras and the " How all occasions do in
form against me" speech. Nonetheless, it
is a first-rate movie: intelligently put to
gether, cleanly shot and designed, and
charged with energy. Olivier informs his
readings of lines like "Except my life, ex
cept my life" and "Oh, I could tell you"
with a piercing melancholia, and he is
flanked by two good actresses: Eileen
Herlie as a touchingly foolish Gertrude,
and Jean Simmons as Ophelia — the del
icate, willowy Ophelia we might associ
ate with the famous Steichen photograph
of Lillian Gish in the role. Stanley Hol
loway is a memorable Gravedigger.
Featuring Basil Sydney as Claudius,
Felix Aylmer as Polonius, Norman
Wooland as Horatio, Terence Morgan as
Laertes, Peter Cushing as Osric and An
thony Quayle as Marcellus.
Plays Monday.
Splash (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
This sparkling comedy-fantasy about a
romance between a nice young New
Yorker (Tom Hanks) and a mermaid
(Daryl Hannah) who complicates —
messes up and enriches — his life bears
some resemblance to the 1943 musical
"One Touch of Venus." The writers
(Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel and
Bruce Jay Friedman, adapting a story by
producer Brian Grazer) and the director
(Ron Howard) have given the film a
completely formed narrative shape, from
its sepia-tinted black and white prologue
to its "Brigadoon" ending. It has its sen
timental side, but Howard provides an
unusual tone: sweetly dazed. And watch
ing it, you become infected by it — you
feel as if someone had knocked you
lightly on the head or spun you around a
little too fast. With Eugene Levy as an
obsessed scientist and the irrepressible
John Candy as Tom Hanks' brother;
Candy is so unreasonably hilarious that
you start laughing whenever he shows up
in anticipation of what he's going to do.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.

Dirty Harry (1971)
Kresge Auditorium
1971 was a year of violent,
manipulative movies: "Straw Dogs," "A
Clockwork Orange," "The Cowboys"
and worst of all, this police thriller by
Don Siegel, made to appeal to a viligante
consciousness. Clint Eastwood plays a
cop who rebels against his superiors and
brings a psychotic killer to justice. The
movie sees the authorities, who refuse to
have the killer arrested on insubstantial
evidence, as milky liberals; Harry, on the
other hand, has a saint-like insight into
the truth, and the movie justifies his
most contemptible impulses. Harry
Julian Fink, Rita M. Fink and Dean
Riesner wrote the script; the cast in
cludes Harry Guardino, Reni Santoni
and John Vernon.
Plays tonight at 9.
Notorious (1946)
Terman Auditorium
The most romantic of Alfred
Hitchcock's pictures. When her father
turns out to be a fascist, Ingrid Bergman
feels she must clear her name by working
to trap another fascist — her husband
(Claude Rains). (The plot has a number
of similarities to Orson Welles' "The
Stranger," released the same year.)
Bergman looks ravishing, and her scenes
with Cary Grant, as the agent she is
allied with, are among the few genuine
examples of eroticism in American films
of this puritanical decade. Ben Hecht
wrote the screenplay. Classic sequences:
the wine cellar scene and the famous
full-screen shot of Bergman's key.
Plays Wednesday evening at 7:30.
Throne of Blood (1957)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Both Orson Welles and Roman
Polanski have had a fling at filming
"Macbeth," but Akira Kurosawa's
samurai version is much closer to the
spirit of the play. Toshiro Mifune and the
amazing Machiko Kyo star; her hand
washing scene is so terrifyingly obsessive
that it transcends the barriers of lan
guage, period and style. It is unlikely that
any director in any medium has ever
caused Birnam Wood to come so magi
cally to Dunsinane.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Kagemusha."

Unknown Chaplin (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Charlie Chaplin didn't work from a
script; he simply ran the camera while he
rehearsed sequences, shifting actors,
props and story elements until he was
satisfied with what he had constructed.
The film historians Kevin Brownlow and
David Gill located reels of unused
footage and, intercutting it with inter
views with some of his co-stars (Georgia
Hale and Virginia Cherrill, most reveal
ingly), assembled three 50-minute pro
grams for Granada Television. It's a
thrilling example of film scholarship; the
remarkably perceptive narration (read
by James Mason) points out details all
but the most devoted Chaplin
aficionados would be likely to miss, as
well as conveying the impression that we
are participating in the unraveling of a
series of long-unsolved mysteries: How
did Chaplin work out his routines? What
did he start with? How did he create his
trick effects? The first program, "My
Happiest Years," focuses on Chaplin's
hectic days at Mutual Pictures (1915-
1917), where he cranked out 12
comedies in 16 months. The second,
"The Greatest Director," covers the per
iod at First National (1917-1923) and
Chaplin's work at United Artists through
"City Lights" (1931); the last, "Hidden
Treasures," contains sequences cut from
the release prints of "Shoulder Arms,"
"The Circus," "City Lights," "Modern
Times" and others.
Plays Wednesday.
Kagemusha (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa produced this
epic of Shakespearean scope about a
thief in 16th-century Japan who must act
as the double of a war lord. (Tatsuya
Nakadai plays both roles.) Kurosawa
draws on all the styles he has embraced
in 37 years of filmmaking: In subject
matter, the movie takes him back to his
samurai pictures, but the battle scenes,
magnificent as they are, are enriched
with the humanism that has emerged in
his work since the mid-19605. They seem
like immense and tragic canvasses that
David or Delacroix might have painted.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Throne of Blood."

Gone with the Wind (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
David O. Selznick's biggest movie,
written mostly by Ben Hecht (though
Sidney Howard got the credit and the
posthumous Oscar) and directed by Vic
tor Fleming (though George Cukor
started it). "Big" is not the same as
"great," but this four-hour adaptation of
the Margaret Mitchell bestseller is
hugely entertaining, especially when
Clark Gable or Butterfly McQueen is on
the screen. And it does have one perfor
mance that should be called great:
Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett
O'Hara. With Leslie Howard, Olivia De
Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Hattie
McDaniel and many others.
Plays through Wednesday.
Coup de Torchon (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In French colonial Africa in the '30s, a
local cop (that resolute, dreary actor
Philippe Noiret) finally gets so sick of the
penny-ante villainy and cruelty around
him that he turns killer. Bernard Taver
nier's movie progresses from the morally
questionable to the morally repellent,
and as it gets uglier it also grows more
opaque. But some people seem con
vinced that Tavernier and Jean
Aurenche, who collaborated with him on
the screenplay, have something impor
tant to say to us. With Isabelle Huppert,
Stephane Audran, Guy Marchand and
Jean-Pierre Marielle, in a double role.
He's the only really fresh performer, so
when he pops up a second time he's like
a cool glass of water in all this existential
African heat.
Plays Thursday with "L'Etoile du
Nord."
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often hilarious
parody of heavy metal rock, featuring
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean
and Harry Shearer (in a walrus mous
tache) as the main members of the group
whose descent from fame the mock doc
umentary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical numbers aren't
as witty as they might be, except for an
imitation British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays today with "Top Secret!"

are participating in the unraveling of a
series of long-unsolved mysteries: How
did Chaplin work out his routines? What
did he start with? How did he create his
trick effects? The first program, "My
Happiest Years," focuses on Chaplin's
hectic days at Mutual Pictures (1915-
1917), where he cranked out 12
comedies in 16 months. The second,
"The Greatest Director," covers the per
iod at First National (1917-1923) and
Chaplin's work at United Artists through
"City Lights" (1931); the last, "Hidden
Treasures," contains sequences cut from
the release prints of "Shoulder Arms,"
"The Circus," "City Lights," "Modern
Times" and others.
Plays Wednesday.
Kagemusha (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa produced this
epic of Shakespearean scope about a
thief in 16th-century Japan who must act
as the double of a war lord. (Tatsuya
Nakadai plays both roles.) Kurosawa
draws on all the styles he has embraced
in 37 years of filmmaking: In subject
matter, the movie takes him back to his
samurai pictures, but the battle scenes,
magnificent as they are, are enriched
with the humanism that has emerged in
his work since the mid-19605. They seem
like immense and tragic canvasses that
David or Delacroix might have painted.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Throne of Blood."

Gone with the Wind (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
David O. Selznick's biggest movie,
written mostly by Ben Hecht (though
Sidney Howard got the credit and the
posthumous Oscar) and directed by Vic
tor Fleming (though George Cukor
started it). "Big" is not the same as
"great," but this four-hour adaptation of
the Margaret Mitchell bestseller is
hugely entertaining, especially when
Clark Gable or Butterfly McQueen is on
the screen. And it does have one perfor
mance that should be called great:
Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett
O'Hara. With Leslie Howard, Olivia De
Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Hattie
McDaniel and many others.
Plays through Wednesday.
Coup de Torchon (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In French colonial Africa in the '30s, a
local cop (that resolute, dreary actor
Philippe Noiret) finally gets so sick of the
penny-ante villainy and cruelty around
him that he turns killer. Bernard Taver
nier's movie progresses from the morally
questionable to the morally repellent,
and as it gets uglier it also grows more
opaque. But some people seem con
vinced that Tavernier and Jean
Aurenche, who collaborated with him on
the screenplay, have something impor
tant to say to us. With Isabelle Huppert,
Stephane Audran, Guy Marchand and
Jean-Pierre Marielle, in a double role.
He's the only really fresh performer, so
when he pops up a second time he's like
a cool glass of water in all this existential
African heat.
Plays Thursday with "L'Etoile du
Nord."
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often hilarious
parody of heavy metal rock, featuring
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean
and Harry Shearer (in a walrus mous
tache) as the main members of the group
whose descent from fame the mock doc
umentary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical numbers aren't
as witty as they might be, except for an
imitation British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays today with "Top Secret!"

Hamlet (1948)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Laurence Olivier's version. Shake
speare scholars cavil — justifiably — at
the transformation of the soliloquies into
interior monologues, and at the omission
of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, For
tinbras and the " How all occasions do in
form against me" speech. Nonetheless, it
is a first-rate movie: intelligently put to
gether, cleanly shot and designed, and
charged with energy. Olivier informs his
readings of lines like "Except my life, ex
cept my life" and "Oh, I could tell you"
with a piercing melancholia, and he is
flanked by two good actresses: Eileen
Herlie as a touchingly foolish Gertrude,
and Jean Simmons as Ophelia — the del
icate, willowy Ophelia we might associ
ate with the famous Steichen photograph
of Lillian Gish in the role. Stanley Hol
loway is a memorable Gravedigger.
Featuring Basil Sydney as Claudius,
Felix Aylmer as Polonius, Norman
Wooland as Horatio, Terence Morgan as
Laertes, Peter Cushing as Osric and An
thony Quayle as Marcellus.
Plays Monday.
Splash (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
This sparkling comedy-fantasy about a
romance between a nice young New
Yorker (Tom Hanks) and a mermaid
(Daryl Hannah) who complicates —
messes up and enriches — his life bears
some resemblance to the 1943 musical
"One Touch of Venus." The writers
(Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel and
Bruce Jay Friedman, adapting a story by
producer Brian Grazer) and the director
(Ron Howard) have given the film a
completely formed narrative shape, from
its sepia-tinted black and white prologue
to its "Brigadoon" ending. It has its sen
timental side, but Howard provides an
unusual tone: sweetly dazed. And watch
ing it, you become infected by it — you
feel as if someone had knocked you
lightly on the head or spun you around a
little too fast. With Eugene Levy as an
obsessed scientist and the irrepressible
John Candy as Tom Hanks' brother;
Candy is so unreasonably hilarious that
you start laughing whenever he shows up
in anticipation of what he's going to do.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.

Dirty Harry (1971)
Kresge Auditorium
1971 was a year of violent,
manipulative movies: "Straw Dogs," "A
Clockwork Orange," "The Cowboys"
and worst of all, this police thriller by
Don Siegel, made to appeal to a viligante
consciousness. Clint Eastwood plays a
cop who rebels against his superiors and
brings a psychotic killer to justice. The
movie sees the authorities, who refuse to
have the killer arrested on insubstantial
evidence, as milky liberals; Harry, on the
other hand, has a saint-like insight into
the truth, and the movie justifies his
most contemptible impulses. Harry
Julian Fink, Rita M. Fink and Dean
Riesner wrote the script; the cast in
cludes Harry Guardino, Reni Santoni
and John Vernon.
Plays tonight at 9.
Notorious (1946)
Terman Auditorium
The most romantic of Alfred
Hitchcock's pictures. When her father
turns out to be a fascist, Ingrid Bergman
feels she must clear her name by working
to trap another fascist — her husband
(Claude Rains). (The plot has a number
of similarities to Orson Welles' "The
Stranger," released the same year.)
Bergman looks ravishing, and her scenes
with Cary Grant, as the agent she is
allied with, are among the few genuine
examples of eroticism in American films
of this puritanical decade. Ben Hecht
wrote the screenplay. Classic sequences:
the wine cellar scene and the famous
full-screen shot of Bergman's key.
Plays Wednesday evening at 7:30.
Throne of Blood (1957)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Both Orson Welles and Roman
Polanski have had a fling at filming
"Macbeth," but Akira Kurosawa's
samurai version is much closer to the
spirit of the play. Toshiro Mifune and the
amazing Machiko Kyo star; her hand
washing scene is so terrifyingly obsessive
that it transcends the barriers of lan
guage, period and style. It is unlikely that
any director in any medium has ever
caused Birnam Wood to come so magi
cally to Dunsinane.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Kagemusha."

Unknown Chaplin (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Charlie Chaplin didn't work from a
script; he simply ran the camera while he
rehearsed sequences, shifting actors,
props and story elements until he was
satisfied with what he had constructed.
The film historians Kevin Brownlow and
David Gill located reels of unused
footage and, intercutting it with inter
views with some of his co-stars (Georgia
Hale and Virginia Cherrill, most reveal
ingly), assembled three 50-minute pro
grams for Granada Television. It's a
thrilling example of film scholarship; the
remarkably perceptive narration (read
by James Mason) points out details all
but the most devoted Chaplin
aficionados would be likely to miss, as
well as conveying the impression that we
are participating in the unraveling of a
series of long-unsolved mysteries: How
did Chaplin work out his routines? What
did he start with? How did he create his

some resemblance to the 1943 musical
"One Touch of Venus." The writers
(Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel and
Bruce Jay Friedman, adapting a story by
producer Brian Grazer) and the director
(Ron Howard) have given the film a
completely formed narrative shape, from
its sepia-tinted black and white prologue
to its "Brigadoon" ending. It has its sen
timental side, but Howard provides an
unusual tone: sweetly dazed. And watch
ing it, you become infected by it — you
feel as if someone had knocked you
lightly on the head or spun you around a
little too fast. With Eugene Levy as an
obsessed scientist and the irrepressible
John Candy as Tom Hanks' brother;
Candy is so unreasonably hilarious that
you start laughing whenever he shows up
in anticipation of what he's going to do.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.

Dirty Harry (1971)
Kresge Auditorium
1971 was a year of violent,
manipulative movies: "Straw Dogs," "A
Clockwork Orange," "The Cowboys"
and worst of all, this police thriller by
Don Siegel, made to appeal to a viligante
consciousness. Clint Eastwood plays a
cop who rebels against his superiors and
brings a psychotic killer to justice. The
movie sees the authorities, who refuse to
have the killer arrested on insubstantial
evidence, as milky liberals; Harry, on the
other hand, has a saint-like insight into
the truth, and the movie justifies his
most contemptible impulses. Harry
Julian Fink, Rita M. Fink and Dean
Riesner wrote the script; the cast in
cludes Harry Guardino, Reni Santoni
and John Vernon.
Plays tonight at 9.
Notorious (1946)
Terman Auditorium
The most romantic of Alfred
Hitchcock's pictures. When her father
turns out to be a fascist, Ingrid Bergman
feels she must clear her name by working
to trap another fascist — her husband
(Claude Rains). (The plot has a number
of similarities to Orson Welles' "The
Stranger," released the same year.)
Bergman looks ravishing, and her scenes
with Cary Grant, as the agent she is
allied with, are among the few genuine
examples of eroticism in American films
of this puritanical decade. Ben Hecht
wrote the screenplay. Classic sequences:
the wine cellar scene and the famous
full-screen shot of Bergman's key.
Plays Wednesday evening at 7:30.
Throne of Blood (1957)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Both Orson Welles and Roman
Polanski have had a fling at filming
"Macbeth," but Akira Kurosawa's
samurai version is much closer to the
spirit of the play. Toshiro Mifune and the
amazing Machiko Kyo star; her hand
washing scene is so terrifyingly obsessive
that it transcends the barriers of lan
guage, period and style. It is unlikely that
any director in any medium has ever
caused Birnam Wood to come so magi
cally to Dunsinane.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Kagemusha."

Unknown Chaplin (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Charlie Chaplin didn't work from a
script; he simply ran the camera while he
rehearsed sequences, shifting actors,
props and story elements until he was
satisfied with what he had constructed.
The film historians Kevin Brownlow and
David Gill located reels of unused
footage and, intercutting it with inter
views with some of his co-stars (Georgia
Hale and Virginia Cherrill, most reveal
ingly), assembled three 50-minute pro
grams for Granada Television. It's a
thrilling example of film scholarship; the
remarkably perceptive narration (read
by James Mason) points out details all
but the most devoted Chaplin
aficionados would be likely to miss, as
well as conveying the impression that we
are participating in the unraveling of a
series of long-unsolved mysteries: How
did Chaplin work out his routines? What
did he start with? How did he create his
trick effects? The first program, "My
Happiest Years," focuses on Chaplin's
hectic days at Mutual Pictures (1915-
1917), where he cranked out 12
comedies in 16 months. The second,
"The Greatest Director," covers the per
iod at First National (1917-1923) and
Chaplin's work at United Artists through
"City Lights" (1931); the last, "Hidden
Treasures," contains sequences cut from
the release prints of "Shoulder Arms,"
"The Circus," "City Lights," "Modern
Times" and others.
Plays Wednesday.
Kagemusha (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa produced this
epic of Shakespearean scope about a
thief in 16th-century Japan who must act
as the double of a war lord. (Tatsuya
Nakadai plays both roles.) Kurosawa
draws on all the styles he has embraced
in 37 years of filmmaking: In subject
matter, the movie takes him back to his
samurai pictures, but the battle scenes,
magnificent as they are, are enriched
with the humanism that has emerged in
his work since the mid-19605. They seem
like immense and tragic canvasses that
David or Delacroix might have painted.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Throne of Blood."

Gone with the Wind (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
David O. Selznick's biggest movie,
written mostly by Ben Hecht (though
Sidney Howard got the credit and the
posthumous Oscar) and directed by Vic
tor Fleming (though George Cukor
started it). "Big" is not the same as
"great," but this four-hour adaptation of
the Margaret Mitchell bestseller is
hugely entertaining, especially when
Clark Gable or Butterfly McQueen is on
the screen. And it does have one perfor
mance that should be called great:
Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett
O'Hara. With Leslie Howard, Olivia De
Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Hattie
McDaniel and many others.
Plays through Wednesday.
Coup de Torchon (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In French colonial Africa in the '30s, a
local cop (that resolute, dreary actor
Philippe Noiret) finally gets so sick of the
penny-ante villainy and cruelty around
him that he turns killer. Bernard Taver
nier's movie progresses from the morally
questionable to the morally repellent,
and as it gets uglier it also grows more
opaque. But some people seem con
vinced that Tavernier and Jean
Aurenche, who collaborated with him on
the screenplay, have something impor
tant to say to us. With Isabelle Huppert,
Stephane Audran, Guy Marchand and
Jean-Pierre Marielle, in a double role.
He's the only really fresh performer, so
when he pops up a second time he's like
a cool glass of water in all this existential
African heat.
Plays Thursday with "L'Etoile du
Nord."
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often hilarious
parody of heavy metal rock, featuring
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean
and Harry Shearer (in a walrus mous
tache) as the main members of the group
whose descent from fame the mock doc
umentary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical numbers aren't
as witty as they might be, except for an
imitation British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays today with "Top Secret!"
