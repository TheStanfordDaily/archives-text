# Tresidder under fire
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Keith Archuleta, ex-program co
ordinator at Tresidder Memorial
Union, is unhappy with the hiring
practices of his former employer.
"I see a pattern of discrimination
— very subtle discrimination —
within Tresidder," he said".
The former Stanford business stu
dent was not rehired after two years
in a one-year fixed-term appoint
ment. Archuleta, who is black,
charges that Tresidder discriminates
against minorities in the hiring of ad
ministrators — though he stresses
that he does not think he was per
sonally discriminated against.
Stanford needs to develop a
"pattern of hiring and promoting role
models for third-world students," Ar
chuleta said.
Since Archuleta left Tresidder, the
percentage of blacks working there in
administrative positions has dropped
to 13 percent, or one employee.
However, Archuleta said he feels
like he won because he forced the
University to review his case fully by
filing a grievance on Aug. 24.
Archuleta was employed for a
second year on the basis of merit. In
the middle of his second term, he in
formed his supervisor, Tresidder As
sistant Director Nancy Howe, that he
would like to continue in his position
on a permanent basis.
But Archuleta's term ended on
July 27, and he was replaced by "an
external non-minority woman,
Suzanne Becker . . . with Mr. Ar
chuleta's application ranked second,"
according to a summary of the griev
ance filed.
Becker's position is permanent.
The grievance report states, "The
University Reviewing Officer found
no evidence of racial discrimination
in the search process nor in the final
selection of the candidate to fill the
Program Coordinator position.
"Based on a review of the selection
process, job description, criteria used
and resumes of the finalists, the deci
sion to hire Ms. Becker appears to
have been reasonable and reached on
an objective basis."
Archuleta agrees that Becker has
somewhat more concert-planning ex
perience than he does, but felt he
should have been given the chance to
develop more talent in that field. He
is not enthusiastic about taking a job
in another field, but he may be forced
to do so.
After Becker's appointment was
announced. Archuleta sent an adden
dum to the original grievance he had
filed on Aug. 24.

In a Sept. 14 letter to Felix Bar
thelemy, Stanford manager of em
ployee relations, Archuleta wrote, "I
see now that my honesty and clarity
fell upon deaf ears, and my skills and
abilities, background and proven
record, good performance evalua
tions and references fell upon blind
eyes."
In that same correspondence, Ar
chuleta noted that three Tresidder
administrative employees were hired
without a search process. Among
those employees, Tresidder Director
Ellie Oppenheim was promoted to
the associate dean level without a
search or review committee.
University Ombudsman John
Goheen said the case was "very badly
handled ... he (Archuleta) was a
very successful person."
But Oppenheim said that Tresidder
and Archuleta have a "pretty

straightforward understanding"
about the nature of his position and
that he should therefore not be bitter.
Rachel Bagby. an Afro-American
Program and Black Performing Arts
CQordinator who helped Archuleta to
organize the case, said it is significant
that he went through with the griev
ance.
"I do think it was a very positive
turnout," she said.
Archuleta is still arguing with the
University about back-pay. He
believes he should have been given
pay after he lost his job to Becker. He
was told recently that he would be re
ceiving University paychecks again by
Oct. 2, but he hasn't received any yet,
he said.
The University has promised to
rehire Archuleta, but he will most
likely be working in some area of the
University not related to Tresidder.
