Reagan calls for CIA investigation
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday ordered the CIA and
his Intelligence Oversight Board to investigate "the possibility of im
proper conduct" in the spy agency's production of a psychological
warfare manual tor Nicaraguan rebels.
Acting four days after the existence of the manual was reported by
The Associated Press, the White House issued a statement saying the
administration "has not advocated or condoned political assassination."
Reagan's order came as the manual, which suggests "selective vio
lence" to "neutralize" some officials of Nicaragua's leftist government,
emerged as a Democratic campaign issue, and House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) demanded the ouster of CIA Director William Casey.
During a stopover in Seattle, Democratic vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro cited the manual as an example of the administra
tion's "moral blindness" on foreign policy.
Denouncing the manual as "nothing short of outrageous," O'Neill
said Casey "owes the Congress and the American people an im
mediate explanation," and added: "I want him to get out of there."
The speaker further suggested that any in-house investigation by the
CIA would be a "whitewash" and he said the matter should be inves
tigated by the congressional General Accounting Office instead.
Casey, Reagan's close friend and a leading figure in the administra
tion's Central America policies, has been under fire before over his per
sonal financial dealings and congressional complaints that he withheld
information about the ClA's mining of Nicaragua's harbors earlier this
year.
The 90-page CIA manual, entitled "Psychological Operations in
Guerrilla War," recommends hiring professional criminals to carry out
"selective jobs," creating a "martyr" by arranging a violent demonstra
tion that leads to the death of a rebel supporter and coercing
Nicaraguans into carrying out assignments again? their will.
Shultz outlines flexibile strategy
LOS ANGELES — Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday out
lined a strategy for dealing with the Soviet Union, stressing flexibility
and pragmatism rather than the demand for change in Soviet behavior
that characterized President Reagan's earlier years in office.
In particular, Shultz made clear that the administration has moved
away from the position that negotiations on issues of interest to the
Soviets be linked io improved Soviet conduct in other areas.
Instead, he said, "linkage is a tactical question" whose use should be
tempered by awareness that "it may not always make sense for us to
break off negotiations or suspend agreements."
In remarks prepared for delivery in Los Angeles last night to the
Rand-UCLA center for Soviet studies, Shultz sought to explain how the
administration hopes to build on the recent talks at the White House be
tween President Reagan and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromvko.
Other ex-Nazi services revealed
WASHINGTON — The National Aeronautics and Space Administra
tion was not the only federal agency to use the serv ices of ex-Nazis, ac
cording to federal sources. The Army, Air Force and Navy also have
used suspected ex-Nazi war criminals in high-level research positions,
the sources said.
Some are now under active investigation by the Justice Department's
Office ol Special Investigations (OSI), which has responsibility for track
ing former Nazi war criminals in this country, according to the sources.
The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Arthur Rudolph,
who developed the Saturn V rocket that took U.S. astronauts to the
moon, left the United States last March for West Germany and
renounced his U.S. citizenship rather than contest U.S. allegations that
he "worked thousands of slave laborers to death" while supervising pro
duction of V-2 missiles for the Nazis.
The West German government said yesterday that it plans to start an
investigation of Rudolph. Neal Sher, who heads OSI. said the Justice
Department is willing to provide evidence to the West Germans.
Rudolph was a close friend and a co-worker of Wern/icr vo/i Braun,
who headed rocket research for the Nazis. They were among 118 Ger
man rocket experts secretly brought to the United States by the U.S.
Army after World War II in what was called Operation Paperclip. After
rocket work for the Army, they both became NASA officials.
British economist wins Nobel
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The 1984 Nobel Prize for economics was
awarded here yesterday to Sir Richard Stone of Britain for his pioneer
ing work in developing systems of national accounting.
Stone, 71, a professor at Cambridge University, was an assistant
during World War II of John Maynard Keynes, whose own general the
ory on economics has had a pervasive international influence.
Reporting and analysis as a logically connected system of national ac
counting was, in the early 19405, an epoch-making contribution for
which Stone was "primarily responsible," the award citation said.
The collation of the mass of war-time statistical material, which
Keynes needed for his analysis of the imbalance in the British economy
at the time, provided the research environment for the development of
Stone's own analytical techniques.
Six killed in U.S. helicopter crash
MANILA, Philippines — An Air Force helicopter on a night training
flight crashed in dense jungle north of Manila Wednesday, killing all six
Americans on board, the U.S. Embassy reported here yesterday.
The HH-53 helicopter was stationed at Clark Air Base, about 50
miles north of Manila.
An Air Force spokesman said heavy fog and darkness were hampering
efforts to reach the scene of the crash, about 15 miles north of the air
base. The cause of the crash was not immediately known and the names
of the victims were not released
Scientists find 'complete' skeleton
WASHINGTON — The most complete skeleton of an early human
ancestor ever found has been dug up in Kenya. The bones are those of a
surprisingly tall 12-year-old boy of the Homo erectus species who died
some 1.6 million years ago.
The specimen is among the earliest of this species, which lived in
Africa and Eurasia until giving rise to an archaic form of Homo sapiens
about 400,000 years ago.
The completeness of the skeleton is unprecedented in a field where
discovery of a few teeth or scraps of bone is cause for celebration. The
new skeleton is missing only its left arm, lower right arm and most of the
foot bones. It is far more complete than "Lucy," a partial skeleton of
Australopithecus, which preceeded Homo erectus by about 2 million
years.
The new find reveals that these ancient people had bodies virtually in
distinguishable from our own and that, at least in some cases, they were
as tall as Americans today. The skeleton shows that the boy stood 5 feet,
6 inches, taller than many of today's 12-year-olds. In the absence of
well-preserved body bones, most anthropologists had assumed that
Horno erectus was short and stocky, averaging around 5 feet, 4 inches as
an adult.
"This is a really surprising thing," said Alan Walker, a Johns Hopkins
University anatomist who excavated the skeleton with Kenya's Richard
Leakey. "This boy would have grown up to be 6 feet tall. It's a myth that
these people were always short. In fact, I think we have to conclude that
modern people, at least in some populations, are reduced in size."
Oil news causes rise in stocks
NEW YORK — An outburst of enthusiasm over falling oil prices sent
stock prices soaring yesterday in the market's best and busiest day in
more than two months.
Gains of a point or more were common among auto, airline and other
issues that would stand to benefit from lower fuel costs.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 29.49 to 1,225.38,
for its biggest gain since it rose 36 points on Aug. 3.

In particular, Shultz made clear that the administration has moved
away from the position that negotiations on issues of interest to the
Soviets be linked io improved Soviet conduct in other areas.
Instead, he said, "linkage is a tactical question" whose use should be
tempered by awareness that "it may not always make sense for us to
break off negotiations or suspend agreements."
In remarks prepared for delivery in Los Angeles last night to the
Rand-UCLA center for Soviet studies, Shultz sought to explain how the
administration hopes to build on the recent talks at the White House be

Other ex-Nazi services revealed
WASHINGTON — The National Aeronautics and Space Administra
tion was not the only federal agency to use the serv ices of ex-Nazis, ac
cording to federal sources. The Army, Air Force and Navy also have
used suspected ex-Nazi war criminals in high-level research positions,
the sources said.
Some are now under active investigation by the Justice Department's
Office ol Special Investigations (OSI), which has responsibility for track
ing former Nazi war criminals in this country, according to the sources.
The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Arthur Rudolph,
who developed the Saturn V rocket that took U.S. astronauts to the
moon, left the United States last March for West Germany and
renounced his U.S. citizenship rather than contest U.S. allegations that
he "worked thousands of slave laborers to death" while supervising pro
duction of V-2 missiles for the Nazis.
The West German government said yesterday that it plans to start an
investigation of Rudolph. Neal Sher, who heads OSI. said the Justice
Department is willing to provide evidence to the West Germans.
Rudolph was a close friend and a co-worker of Wern/icr vo/i Braun,
who headed rocket research for the Nazis. They were among 118 Ger
man rocket experts secretly brought to the United States by the U.S.
Army after World War II in what was called Operation Paperclip. After
rocket work for the Army, they both became NASA officials.
British economist wins Nobel
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The 1984 Nobel Prize for economics was
awarded here yesterday to Sir Richard Stone of Britain for his pioneer
ing work in developing systems of national accounting.
Stone, 71, a professor at Cambridge University, was an assistant
during World War II of John Maynard Keynes, whose own general the
ory on economics has had a pervasive international influence.
Reporting and analysis as a logically connected system of national ac
counting was, in the early 19405, an epoch-making contribution for
which Stone was "primarily responsible," the award citation said.
The collation of the mass of war-time statistical material, which
Keynes needed for his analysis of the imbalance in the British economy
at the time, provided the research environment for the development of
Stone's own analytical techniques.
Six killed in U.S. helicopter crash
MANILA, Philippines — An Air Force helicopter on a night training
flight crashed in dense jungle north of Manila Wednesday, killing all six
Americans on board, the U.S. Embassy reported here yesterday.
The HH-53 helicopter was stationed at Clark Air Base, about 50
miles north of Manila.
An Air Force spokesman said heavy fog and darkness were hampering
efforts to reach the scene of the crash, about 15 miles north of the air
base. The cause of the crash was not immediately known and the names
of the victims were not released
Scientists find 'complete' skeleton
WASHINGTON — The most complete skeleton of an early human
ancestor ever found has been dug up in Kenya. The bones are those of a
surprisingly tall 12-year-old boy of the Homo erectus species who died
some 1.6 million years ago.
The specimen is among the earliest of this species, which lived in
Africa and Eurasia until giving rise to an archaic form of Homo sapiens
about 400,000 years ago.
The completeness of the skeleton is unprecedented in a field where
discovery of a few teeth or scraps of bone is cause for celebration. The
new skeleton is missing only its left arm, lower right arm and most of the
foot bones. It is far more complete than "Lucy," a partial skeleton of
Australopithecus, which preceeded Homo erectus by about 2 million
years.
The new find reveals that these ancient people had bodies virtually in
distinguishable from our own and that, at least in some cases, they were
as tall as Americans today. The skeleton shows that the boy stood 5 feet,
6 inches, taller than many of today's 12-year-olds. In the absence of
well-preserved body bones, most anthropologists had assumed that
Horno erectus was short and stocky, averaging around 5 feet, 4 inches as
an adult.
"This is a really surprising thing," said Alan Walker, a Johns Hopkins
University anatomist who excavated the skeleton with Kenya's Richard
Leakey. "This boy would have grown up to be 6 feet tall. It's a myth that
these people were always short. In fact, I think we have to conclude that
modern people, at least in some populations, are reduced in size."
Oil news causes rise in stocks
NEW YORK — An outburst of enthusiasm over falling oil prices sent
stock prices soaring yesterday in the market's best and busiest day in
more than two months.
Gains of a point or more were common among auto, airline and other
issues that would stand to benefit from lower fuel costs.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 29.49 to 1,225.38,
for its biggest gain since it rose 36 points on Aug. 3.

Reagan calls for CIA investigation
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday ordered the CIA and
his Intelligence Oversight Board to investigate "the possibility of im
proper conduct" in the spy agency's production of a psychological
warfare manual tor Nicaraguan rebels.
Acting four days after the existence of the manual was reported by
The Associated Press, the White House issued a statement saying the
administration "has not advocated or condoned political assassination."
Reagan's order came as the manual, which suggests "selective vio
lence" to "neutralize" some officials of Nicaragua's leftist government,
emerged as a Democratic campaign issue, and House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) demanded the ouster of CIA Director William Casey.
During a stopover in Seattle, Democratic vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro cited the manual as an example of the administra
tion's "moral blindness" on foreign policy.
Denouncing the manual as "nothing short of outrageous," O'Neill
said Casey "owes the Congress and the American people an im
mediate explanation," and added: "I want him to get out of there."
The speaker further suggested that any in-house investigation by the
CIA would be a "whitewash" and he said the matter should be inves
tigated by the congressional General Accounting Office instead.
Casey, Reagan's close friend and a leading figure in the administra
tion's Central America policies, has been under fire before over his per
sonal financial dealings and congressional complaints that he withheld
information about the ClA's mining of Nicaragua's harbors earlier this
year.
The 90-page CIA manual, entitled "Psychological Operations in
Guerrilla War," recommends hiring professional criminals to carry out
"selective jobs," creating a "martyr" by arranging a violent demonstra
tion that leads to the death of a rebel supporter and coercing
Nicaraguans into carrying out assignments again? their will.
Shultz outlines flexibile strategy
