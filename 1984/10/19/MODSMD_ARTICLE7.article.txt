## Oil prices predicted to fall Nigeria breaks OPEC ranks 
### 
Nigeria broke ranks with the rest of the Organi
zation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yester
day, lowering the price of its oil by $2 a barrel as
OPEC prepared to meet in an emergency session to
try to halt the downward spiral in prices.
In London, U.S. Energy Secretary Donald Hodel
predicted prices could fall even lower— dropping
the current OPEC benchmark price of $29 a barrel
to as low as $25 if there is no major supply disrup
tion or a cutback in production.
If the price cuts spread, analysts said, U.S. consu
mers can save as much as two to three cents a gal
lon on their heating oil and gasoline bills this win
ter. But the coming cold weather may prove to be
the oil cartel's best weapon in defending its pricing
structure.
OPEC announced that its oil ministers will meet
in Geneva Oct. 29 to develop strategy to halt the
price slide.
Nigeria, considered OPECs weakest link, was
under strong pressure to follow two non-OPEC
members, Norway and Great Britain, in cutting the
price of its Bonny Light, since the African nation
produces the same type of premium crude as the
European suppliers.
Britain cut the price of its oil by $1.35 a barrel, to
$28.65, on Wednesday, the day after Norway
decided to lower its price by $1.50 to $28.50.
Nigeria, vowing to match the European cuts,

lowered its prices yesterday to $28 a barrel.
Nigeria precipitated OPECs first price cut ever
in March 1983 by unilaterally dropping its oil price
to match a similar cut by Great Britain.
"To arrest a fall in oil production and revenue,
we have decided to reduce the price of our oil,"
Nigerian Oil Minister Tam David-West said in
Lagos yesterday after a meeting of the country's
Executive Council.
According to the Dow Jones news service, he
said the price cuts will take effect immediately and
added that Nigeria's own interests take precedence
over its obligations to OPEC.
There also were reports from reliable industry
sources in London that Abu Dhabi, another OPEC
member and one of the United Arab Emirates, is
offering secret discounts of 50 cents a barrel to its
major clients.
The action by Britain and Norway further
lowered the price on the volatile spot markets,
where North Sea oil not covered by long-term con
tracts fell to about $27 a barrel yesterday. Saudi
light also dropped to $27.
The effect of the OPEC meeting is likely to fur
ther depress prices, as oil buyers will hold off on
their purchases on the chance the cartel will be
forced to cut prices. An early cold snap, however,
could disrupt that strategy by strengthening the
demand for oil and moving the price upward.

Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Pe
troleum Co., advised OPEC to meet the challenge
of price cuts by restraining its production. "Prices
will firm if OPEC can change the situation by ad
justing production downward," he told a London
seminar sponsored by The International Herald
Tribune and The Oil Daily. He suggested that
Saudia Arabia could cut its output by 1 million bar
rels a day, from its current production of about 4
million barrels, to create a shortage instead of an
oil glut.
But Hodel, the U.S. energy secretary, warned
OPEC at the same meeting against trying to artifi
cially maintain higher prices against the market s
downward pressure. "You cant buck the market
for an extended period of time" without creating
wild price swings that could eventually disrupt the
world economy, he said.
Oil price cuts are a two-edged sword, helping in
dustrialized nations and non-producing Third
World countries. But heavily-in-debt oil producers
such as Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela could be
badly hurt by price cuts, and their problems could
be passed on to U.S. banks and their other lenders.
Reductions in the oil price also could make it
more difficult for Iran and Iraq to finance their 4-
year-old Persian Gulf war.
