# El Salvador launches offensive

### 
OSICALA, El Salvador — The
Salvadoran army launched a major
offensive yesterday against the left
wing guerrilla stronghold in north
eastern Morazan province, three days
after unprecedented peace talks be
tween the government and the insur
gents.
The offensive here came one day
after the army began operations
against two smaller rebel-controlled
areas in southern Usulutan and
northern San Vicente provinces, Col.
Adolfo Blandon, the armed forces
chief of staff, said. The offensive in
Morazan was "very important," he
said, because the army intends for the
first time to keep troops north of the
Torola River, which has been the
border between government and
rebel-dominated territory since late
1982.
Blandon stood yesterday morning
with Col. James Steele, chief of U.S.
military trainers in El Salvador, on
the edge of a grassy field here and
watched 12 UH-1H "Huey" helicop
ters leave to ferry 800 troops north to
the towns of San Fernando and Per
quin deep in rebel-dominated terri
tory. Initial reports said they met no
resistance.
An additional 1,500 troops were
marching north into Morazan from

five separate points, Salvadoran offi
cers said. About 500 were seen
wading the thigh-deep Torola carry
ing automatic rifles, recoilless rifles,
machine guns and heavy packs just
north of this small town.
"In the first place, the objective is
the search for and dislodging of the
terrorists in the entire zone" north of
the Torola, Blandon said. He said the
timing of the offensive had "no rela
tionship" to Monday's peace talks,
and that it was part of a strategic plan
hatched in July for the second half of
the year.
But Lt. Col. Domingo Monterrosa,
field commander for the Morazan op
eration, said he hoped to surprise
guerrilla commanders in the middle
of talks among themselves over the
Monday meeting between the left and
President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
"If Monday they met in La Palma,
it's probable that people from there
are here trying to talk with (rebel
leaders), and explain to them what
happened in La Palma," Monterrosa
said.
Northern Morazan is the strong
hold of the People's Revolutionary
Army led by Joaquin Villalobos. Vil
lalobos was supposed to participate in
Monday's talks but failed to show up
because he was unable to travel there

in time.
Monterrosa said he had hoped to
start the offensive Tuesday, but the
air force was not available because it
had been on alert in case of trouble
related to the La Palma meeting. Two
A-37 jet fighter-bombers streaked
south over this town just south of the
Torola yesterday morning Minutes
earlier a loud explosion had echoed in
from the mountains to the north
where the guerrillas hide out.
"No truce has been discussed,"
Monterrosa said. "There are times
when you have to make war to
achieve peace."
The operation here marked the
first time that the army has pushed
north of the Torola since August,
Monterrosa said, and it marked the
first time that the army used helicop
ters to carry large numbers of troops
north of the Torola. The delivery last
month of 10 additional Huey helicop
ters, supplied by the United States,
made possible this operation at this
time, Blandon said. The army now
has 28 combat Hueys, plus four for
use as medical-evacuation helicop
ters.
'•In the past, when the army moved
north, the guerrillas would see them
and retreat. Here you have a signifi
cant advantage because you can lift

(the troops) in behind," a military ob
server said.
U.S. adviser Steele, wearing
camouflaged fatigues and carrying a
semi-automatic rifle, said he had
been invited by Monterrosa to watch
the troops climb into the helicopters.
Two other U.S. military trainers also
were here: Marine Lt. Col. David
Blizzard, who is the U.S. naval at
tache, and a sergeant who is an aide
to Steele. They also were carrying
small semi-automatic rifles.
Blandon said that between 6,000
and 7,000 troops were involved in
five current army operations against
the rebels. They included operations
in Morazan, Usulutan and San
Vicente that began in the last 24
hours, plus one that opened a week
ago in central Cabanas province and a
fifth that has been under way for
months in northern San Miguel prov
ince.
Blandon and Monterrosa stressed
that they believe the guerrillas are
weak right now and noted that the
army is using fewer troops in the of
fensive against Mora-taw vVvan \n of
fensives last summer here.
