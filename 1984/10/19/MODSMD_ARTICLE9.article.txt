## Faculty Senate to review press policy 
### JEANNE COOPER Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Faculty Senate may reconsider its
policy of denying outside press access to its
meetings, according to senate Chairman John Mer
ryman, professor of law here.
Senate member Elie Abel, chairman of the com
munication department, said yesterday he is plan
ning to "re-interest" the senate's Steering Commit
tee in the issue soon.
On Wednesday, The Palo Alto Weekly submit
ted to the Steering Committee its request in
16 months to attend the Faculty Senate meetings,
only two weeks after the committee turned down a
similar petition from the San Jose Mercury News.
Current policy allows only reporters from The
Stanford Daily, KZSU radio and Campus Report,
the University's weekly faculty/staff newspaper, to
cover the meetings live.
Abel questioned the Steering Committee's deci
sion at the senate meeting Oct. 11. "None of us
relies totally on those publications," he said in ref
erence to the campus media. "I think the senate
should seriously consider reversing that policy."
Abel reiterated his sentiments in an interview
yesterday."The University ought to have no
secrets from the general public. A discussion of the
nature we had last week on faculty research is a
matter of considerable interest to the community. I
find it very difficult to justify a policy which says
the media should be disbarred."
The current policy allows reporters from outside
media to listen to an unedited recording of the
meeting immediately afterward. Bob Beyers,

director of the University's News and Publications
Service, also provides reporters with a full copy of
his notes, which he types during the meeting.
Abel, a former reporter, said this information is
not enough. " Presence in the room gives you an ad
ditional dimension of expression and feeling that
tends to get lost, with the best will in the world,
when transcribed from a tape," Abel said.
According to Merryman, the Steering Committee
refused to grant the San Jose Mercury News access
two weeks ago because "we saw no particular rea
son to change senate policy."
"The whole question of outside media coverage
had been raised last year, and the senate consid
ered it and voted against it," Merryman said.
The senate voted 22-17 in October 1983 to con
tinue its University-press-only policy after The
Palo Alto Weekly sent a letter in June 1983 asking
permission to send a reporter. At the meeting last
week, Merryman said reasons for that decision had
included preserving "the informality, congeniality
and intimacy of the senate," in addition to space
considerations.
According to Academic Council Secretary Clara
Bush, professor of linguistics, the limited number
of seats available at senate meetings particularly af
fected last year's proposal. The senate must guar
antee a place for any faculty member interested in a
meeting, Bush said, and the "significantly smaller"
room in which the senate met last year may not
have been able to accommodate all reporters desir
ing access.
"The senate would have had to make priorities,"
she said.

San Jose Mercury News representatives have
said, however, that the paper did not and does not
want access to all meetings, only to those of sub
stantial importance. Reporter Kathy Holub, who
covered the paper's Stanford beat last year, said,
"It's not like I wanted to get into every single
meeting, but there were some issues that the faculty
talked about that I needed to hear."
Holub said her 7 p.m. deadline did not give her
time to listen to a tape of the meetings, which begin
at 3:15 and may end as late as 6 p.m. "Instead, you
had to lurk outside the door, catch as many senate
members as you could by the sleeve when it was
over to ask them what they thought, and then try to
grab (University President) Donald Kennedy
before he left," she said.
"Bob Beyers was always very helpful, running
off copies of his notes," Holub said. "But there was
not enough time to write a story with a lot of back
ground and still get it in at 7 p.m. If the senate
makes a decision that's important, it's got to be in
next day's paper, so morning papers are at a disad
vantage."
Tim Clark, North Santa Clara County bureau
chief for the San Jose Mercury News, was editor of
The Palo Alto Weekly when he raised the question
of press access last year. Although he did not have
a problem with imminent deadlines then, Clark
argued that it is "fundamentally easier to cover
things firsthand than secondhand." He also chided
the senate for a policy that is "on its lace inconsis
tent if some get in and not others."


Elie Abel, chairman of the Communication Department, advocates
press access to Faculty Senate meetings.
Current Palo Alto Weekly editor
Don Kazak, who repeated the re
quest Wednesday, said he "feels
pretty strongly" that local papers
should be allowed in. "I'm sure the
secondhand reports from Information
(the University News and Publica
tions Service) and The Daily are ac
curate, but every newspaper prefers
its own coverage.
"It's hard to understand how Uni
versity newspapers can be allowed in
the room and report at length but
outside ones can not," Kazak said.
Jerry Ceppos, a managing editor at
the Mercurv News, authored the letter

rejected by the Steering Committee
last week. "I know Stanford is a
private institution, but it's such a
powerhouse in the community that our
readers have an interest, and — I'm
reluctant to say it — almost a right to
know what's going on," he said.
According to Ceppos, a press ar
rangement could be mutually benefi
cial. "I think it's a good way for Stan
ford to make itself understood in the
community," he said.
Abel agreed. "The quality of the
discussions is really quite remarkably
high, and might inspire respect if
heard and reported by those outside
Stanford," he said. "The idea that the
presence of outside press could ir
reparably damage the University is
nonsense."
