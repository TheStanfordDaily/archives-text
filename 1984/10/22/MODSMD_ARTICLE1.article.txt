# Rain slows Quad plan
## 
### AMY BIRD Staff writer 
The start of the rainy season may delay completion of
the Inner Quad renovation, according to Max Mazenko of
the Facilities Project Management Office.
"Rain is always detrimental to construction work,"
Mazenko said. "You can't expect people to work in condi
tions like that."
Project Manager Roger Cairns also said continued rain
would make the laying of the final bricks in the Inner
Quad difficult. "It's impossible to lay the bricks when the
sand below them is wet. For every day it rains, we'll need
to extend the contract by one or two days."
But Cairns added that, even taking into consideration
possible delays, he hopes to have all of the bricks laid by
the end of this month. As soon as all the bricks are firmly
set, the rope barriers around the Inner Quad will be
removed.
Mazenko said planners had originally hoped to com
plete the work in the Inner Quad before classes began.
But scheduling problems among the different contractors
and mixupa in the deliver} of niatCiiula delayed the proj
ect.
"At this point we aren't concerned as much with time.
We're just trying to work slowly and deliberately and get
the job done right," Mazenko said.
Other work remaining includes placing a stone rosette
in the center of the brick pavement. Cairns said planners
recently added the stone rosette to the project plans. A
private contractor must color-match the stones for the

rosette and cast the entire design before delivering it to
the construction site.
The final touch to the renovated Inner Quad will be
careful landscaping of the planting circles.
Cairns said he expects the landscaping work to continue
over the next few months. He said the list of plants that
will grow in the circles has not yet been agreed upon.
The controversy surrounding the choice of plants for
the Inner Quad is part of a conflict over the entire renova
tion project.
Gerard Koskovich, a doctoral candidate in art history at
Stanford and an outspoken critic of the changes that have
been made to the Inner Quad, said he considers the
landscaping of the planting circles a matter of great con
cern.
Koskovich said landscaping played an essential part in
defining the space of the Inner Quad. He cited specific
references to acceptable plants in the plans of the Inner
Quad's original architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. Ac
cording to Koskovich, Olmsted wanted the planting
circles to be lush oases supporting a variety of plants that
would contrast with the stark, paved square.
"The Univeristy has employed an architect who actu
ally proposed putting lawns in the planting circles," Kos
kovich said. "The Inner Quad is a site of historical impor
tance. Any work that is done to it should reflect the in
tegrity of the original design."
Mazenko said that to the best of his knowledge the
budget of the project is still within $1 million dollars. The
University received $1 million dollars from an anonymous
donor specifically for the renovation of the Inner Quad.

Recent rain will slow construction in the Inner Quad, but planners are still optimistic that the Quad will be
open for use again by the end of the month.
