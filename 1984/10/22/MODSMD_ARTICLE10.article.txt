## CIA plane crashes 
### PETER HAVEN 
WASHINGTON — Four American employees of the
CIA were killed Friday in El Salvador when their civilian
aircraft plowed into a mountainside during a heavy
rainstorm, the State Department said.
The four employees, all of whom were civilians, were
attempting to detect arms shipments from Nicaragua to
anti-government rebels in El Salvador when the accident

occurred, the department said in a statement. No one else
was on the unarmed plane.
The department said that the victims' next of kin had
been notified but would not release the employees'
names. It said that the CIA mission "had been fully au
thorized in accordance with applicable procedures, in
cluding notification of the responsible committees of
Congress."
CIA Director William Casey was reported to have
briefed Sens. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the panel's vice chairman, about the
accident.
At the White House, spokesman Larry Speakes said
that the CIA plane crashed early Friday outside San Sal
vador, El Salvador's capital, "during heavy rains with very
limited visibility."
A U.S. Embassy official said the plane crashed on
Guazapa Volcano, 15 miles north of the capital. On Sat
urday, intelligence sources in Washington said the plane
had been following another aircraft before it crashed.
But questions about the plane's mission appeared to be
raised Saturday when national guardsmen protecting a
communications facility near San Salvador Volcano, only
three miles from the edge of the capital, said the plane
crashed there.
The area near the capital is firmly under government
control and it is not known to be on the flight path of rebel
supply planes.
Beruit staff reduced
WASHINGTON — All family members of U.S.
diplomats in Beirut who had not left earlier were

evacuated Friday because of deteriorating security in the
Lebanese capital, the State Department announced.
On Saturday, Brian Carlson, a spokesman for the state
department, said more "substantial" cuts in the embassy
roster will be made.
Shortly after the evacuation was ordered, President
Reagan signed legislation authorizing an additional $356
million to improve security provisions at embassies
around the world. The measure also provides $10 million
to pay rewards of up to $500,000 each for information
that leads to the arrest or conviction of persons engaged in
terrorism against U.S. personnel or facilities.
State Department spokesman Alan Romberg said that
five or six family members were covered by the latest
evacuation and were given their choice of returning to
Washington or setting up a temporary residence some
where else in the Middle East. He said that the move
"reflects the overall situation in the wake of the bombing"
Sept. 20 of the embassy annex in a suburb of
predominantly Christian east Beirut.
Since the bombing, all embassy personnel have been
working at the ambassador's residence in another east
Beirut suburb. Both the east Beirut embassy annex and
the embassy proper in predominantly Moslem west Beirut
are closed.
Justice discusses packing
WASHINGTON — Justice William Rehnquist, com
menting on a issue that has been widely debated in the
presidential campaign, said Friday that presidents are jus
tified in attempting to "pack" the Supreme Court with ap
pointees who will remain loyal to the president's views.

"There is no reason in the world why a president should
not do this," Rehnquist said in a speech at the University
of Minnesota College of Law. A text of the speech was
released in Washington.
The Constitution calls for the chief executive to
nominate court members and the Senate to approve them
as a way of providing "indirect infusions" of popular will
into an otherwise politically insulated institution, he said.
But history shows that presidents have been no more
than "partially successful" 1 in court-packing attempts,
Rehnquist reminded his audience. Court appointees
become more independent the longer they serve on the
bench and often end up voting contrary to the political or
philosophical principles of the president who appointed
them, he noted.
Chinese alter economy
PEKING — China's Communist Party Saturday ap
proved a radical change in the nation s socialist economy,
including a gradual lifting of price controls, accompanying
wage increases for workers and a drastic reduction in the
role of centralized state planning.
In a 39-page document released at the end of a Central
Committee session here, China's leaders sketched out a
wide-ranging series of reforms aimed at overhauling the
nation's "rigid economic structure" and at catching up
with "the technological revolution."
While still retaining a commitment to socialism, the
party said that it intends to subject some of China's state
owned enterprises to competition and to let many prices
float in response to market forces.

National guardsmen near San Salvador reported
that a CIA plane crashed on a volcano there, not
miles farther north in Guazapa as U.S. Embassy
sources had said. All four people aboard the plane
were killed.
