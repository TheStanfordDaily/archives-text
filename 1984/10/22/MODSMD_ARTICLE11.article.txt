## The 						Stanford Daily Reagan will be Reagan 
### 
After the first presidential debate, leading Re
publican campaign officials promised President
Reagan's performance in the second debate
would be a marked improvement over his often
times confused and baffled appearance in the first
confrontation. And so it was.
Reagan performed better yesterday than he did
two weeks ago. But in terms of knowing the is
sues and backing up arguments with facts,
Reagan again displayed his cognitive infirmity
and reliance upon "image" as a substitute for
reality. Examples include:
• The CIA death manual: Reagan yesterday
denied knowledge of and responsibility for the
publication and distribution of a CIA handbook
advocating political assassination and the murder
of civilians to help overthrow the Sandinista
regime in Nicaragua.
As Democratic challenger Walter Mondale
pointed out yesterday, Reagan has acted ir
responsibly in his handling of the matter. If he
knew of the manual but did nothing to stop it,
then he behaved reprehensibly. But if he knew
nothing about it — as he claims — Reagan's lead
ership ability becomes suspect.
• Lebanon: After taking responsibility for the

death of 241 Marines last year, Reagan now finds
it politically expedient to blame local com
manders for terrorist attacks upon American in
stallations. Reagan was warned before each inci
dent that an attack was imminent. Yet yesterday,
he didn't explain why he ignored the warnings.
• "Star Wars" defense: Reagan painted a rosy
picture of how his Star Wars defense would bring
an end to the threat of nuclear annihilation. In
the course of questioning and Mondale's rebuttal,
however, it became clear that Reagan really
didn't have a good idea of how the Star Wars sys
tem would work.
Mondale was not flawless in yesterday's debate
— he evaded questions about which weapons sys
tems would be verifiable in a nuclear freeze. But
his performance showed an understanding of
detail and a willingness to confront reality.
Reagan gave a candid performance in the first
debate. He had a nebulous understanding of the
topics, and he was unable to gloss ignorance with
image.
Yesterday, Reagan was, well, Reagan. He was
glib, self-confident, grandfatherly and, on quite a
few of the issues, misinformed. But, as usual, he
hid it well. And that's too bad.
