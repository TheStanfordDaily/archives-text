A Stern reply
Chris Festa's diatribe about the
food service at Stern Hall (The
Daily. Oct. 16) is a classic and unfor
tunate example of useless and often
destructive myths that are thought
lessly perpetuated. As a former
resident, resident assistant and,
more recently, resident fellow at
Stern, 1 know that the food service
there has problems — just as all
others do. Three comments come to
mind. First, I'll wager some cash that
Festa and other chronic complainers
could not, if unaware of the kitchen
from which a meal came, discern any
difference between meals from
Stern, Wilbur, Florence Moore, and
any other large food service. Second,
Festa's column contains not one
word of constructive suggestion on
how to change things for the better.
Third, I'd be surprised if Festa has
ever approached the people who run
the food service at Stern who are in
my experience pleasant, helpful and
responsive — if approached as
human beings by someone willing to
meet them halfway.

'Lesbian' not bad
While I applaud the editorial
condemnation of sexism (The Daily,
Oct. 18), I was appalled to see a
lamentable and all-too-typical exam
ple of heterosexism used as a defense
for feminism. How is it that
"regarding feminists as lesbians"
indicates "an attitude of disrespect
for women's issues," unless one
believes that lesbians are, as a matter
of course, inferior to heterosexual
women?
I would like to point out that_
many of the most articulate, out
spoken and effective feminists are
lesbians — proudly and openly so.
Besides individuals of national note
like Andrea Dworkin, or of interna
tional reputation like Monique Wit
tig, the many hard-working and
committed lesbian-feminist activists
who have struggled for change in the
Stanford community come to mind.
We will never achieve a society

truly without the influence of
gender-based privilege until we
confront and undermine the notion
that it is superior for women (or
men, for that matter) to seek love,
support and sexual fulfillment from
the opposite sex only. The Daily,
Stanford men and those feminists
who regard the "charge" of les
bianism as an insult would do well to
bear this fact in mind.

Keep self-interest
Tuesday's rally showed Mondale
looking like a revived candidate after
his success in the first presidential
debate. But as a Mondale partisan, I
cringed when both Hart and
Mondale stated their case as self
interest vs. fairness. Fritz, baby,
don't do this to yourself. Fairness,
yes, but why in the world concede
the biggest bone, self-interest, to
Reagan when Reagan's programs are
not only unfair but are going to
screw us all, too?
The most threatening burden on
our economy and society is our
growing underclass of the un
employable: those without the edu
cation and basic skills to be produc
tive self-supporting members of
society. Doing whatever it takes to
put this class on its feet is not some
kind of socialism, but is what a
capitalist society must do if it ever
wants to be free of the burden of
supporting a class of outsiders.
Reagan's moves to cut aid to those
on the outside and to disenfranchise
them by opposing renewal of the
voting rights act is no solution.
Would he like to see them just lie
down and die? I bet he would. But it
ain't gonna happen.
Speaking on a college campus,
Mondale might also have mentioned
young people's self-interest in
prefering a dollar of taxation to a
dollar of debt. Taxes are paid by
those working now. Debt will be
paid by the audience.
Most college students won't be
hitting their stride in earnings
capacity for another five or 10 years.
Think how much the national debt

you owe will have increased if we
have Reagan's $200 billion deficits
for the next 10 years. It comes to
about one half of one year's gross
national product, or six months of
unpaid labor due from each and
every working American. That's the
burden Reagan will have shifted on
to your back. That's the plum he's
buying with everyone else's vote. Are
you really stupid enough to think it's
in your self-interest too? Ha ha.
Stanford students. (Ah me.)
Let's see . . . what else is in my
self-interest? A law telling me I must
go forth and multiply? Oh yes, that's
right, they only make you do that if
you make a mistake. That's not so
bad. These things must be put in
historical perspective. Some societies
don't have any freedoms. It's not so
bad to have to live a good Christian
life.
And nuking the anti-ballistic
missile treaty is in everybody's
self-interest: the sooner to deliver
armageddon and rise in rapture into
the arms of God.
Now come on Mondale, it's not
that hard to take self-interest away
from Reagan.

No 'wimp' factor
Having helped organize the
Mondale-Hart rally held here, I felt
somewhat enthusiastic about what
we had achieved, that is, until I
watched the CBS coverage of the
election campaign that night. CBS
and the media as a whole have a
social responsibility, yet they chose
to talk about, and that is all it was,
talk, how youth of America were
only concerned about their own
economic futures in this country and
how Democrats were running
scared. As a liberal student, I have
noticed many of my colleagues open
their eyes to the dangers of simplistic
slogans and fairy tales. There has
developed a fear of what four more
years of jingoistic nationalism and of
utter disregard for the environment
and our collective futures can do to
our nation. I have seen this fear
become a hardened resolution to
prevent such a national, and indeed

international, disaster. That is why,
despite CBS' predictions of yuppie
Republicans, the students of Stan
ford lucky enough to emerge from
rain, welcomed Mondale and his
message. The "dominant"
Republicans present at that event,
were both subdued and incredibly
outnumbered. We all heard the
inspiring words of our fellow student,
Andrea Austin, as she called upon
all of us to unite and work toward a
Mondale-Ferraro victory. It has been
all the fashion to let the media lead
us to opinions through its polls and
its clumsy attempts to understand
grass-roots America. I am glad so
many Stanford students are so un
aware of this fashion and can ignore
all the invented issues of make-up
and the "wimp" factor. And inciden
tally, I also remembered why I don't
watch TV, except for football games,
that is.

Warmongers
Peace and War. In the real world,
unpreparedness and a weak national
defense are invitations to aggression.
The historical fact is that during
one's lifetime the United States has
been in four major wars, all during
Democratic administrations and
presidents.
World War I was declared in
1917, five years after Woodrow
Wilson was elected. World War II
was declared in 1941, nine years
after Franklin Roosevelt was elected.
In 1950, Truman ordered troops into
Korea, having been president the
prior five years. In Vietnam in 1962,
John Kennedy ordered U.S. military
to fire if fired on, two years after he
was elected, and in 1964, with
Johnson as president, Congress
authorized military action in North
Vietnam.
It is historical fact, also, that
Franklin Roosevelt ordered
American-Japanese citizens to be
put into prison camps, and Truman
ordered atomic bombs to be dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
It might be arguable whether the
Democratic Party is the war party,
but, for sure, its politicians invariably

urge a weak national defense, as
Mondale does now.

Shorts and stage
In reading the article "Too much
sun and fun at Stanford?" (The
Daily, Oct. 11) 1 was disappointed
that I found no mention of the many
successes that have been achieved in
cultural and intellectual stimulation
outside of the classroom at Stanford.
In particular, the varied program
ming efforts of the resident assis
tants, resident fellows and the
Office of Residential Education have
made great strides in creating an
atmosphere in student residences
where intellectual and political issues
can be discussed. Admittedly, I have
never discussed The New York
Times book review section with my
parents as Professor Hubert Marshall
might have hoped. But, over the
course of the three years I have been
here, I have discussed issues ranging
from the origin of man and the
Equal Rights Amendment to
homosexuality and nuclear war into
the early hours of the morning with
many of my dorm friends.
I felt further insulted by the
sweeping generalizations of the two
Harvard students quoted by The
Daily as reporting the general view
of Stanford held by Harvard students
Specifically, the comments that
Stanford is "culturally barren" and
that "one wonders how rigorous
(Stanford) can be with everyone
running around in shorts all the
time." Stanford and Palo Alto have
many thriving cultural offerings,
from student performing groups to
professional companies. Participation
on stage, backstage and in the audi
ence is actively and enthusiastically
supported by Stanford's residential
education system. Furthermore, I
have enjoyed theater and opera
performances in San Francisco, as
well as the San Francisco Symphony,
all of which are quite acessible to
Stanford students.
As for my shorts, I have a drawer
full of them. Below it is my drawer
full of sweaters for those cool San
Francisco nights when the fog rolls

in. And, I still get my problem sets
done in spite of it all.

Edit includes myth
The myth of the Nicaraguan arms
flow to rebels in El Salvador,' a piece
of Reagan administration
propaganda that has been discredited
again and again, is being promoted
in the editorial "Give peace a
chance" (The Daily, Oct. 15). You
should know better by now. The
contras are there not to stop nonex
istent "arms shipments" but to des
tabilize the Nicaraguan government
at the instigation of the CIA and the
administration.
The Daily goes on to suggest that
Nicaragua should negotiate with the
contras as Duarte is doing with the
Salvadoran rebels. This idea danger
ously ignores the differences in the
two countries. The FMLN/FDR in El
Salvador has legitimacy: It is an
indigenous group, the culmination of
decades of struggle against the mili
tary and landed oligarchy that have
oppressed, exploited and murdered
the Salvadoran people. In the zones
of rebel control, people are better
fed than outside, and they don't end
up as headless bodies dumped in the
street.
It is the United States, not the
Soviet Union or Cuba, that supplies
the vast majority of arms, money and
training in Central America. And it
supplies these to the very oligarchic
military elites that have so long
oppressed and impoverished the
region — i.e., to the wrong side! The
United States should unconditionally
stop aiding the contras, and all the
various dictatorships that currently
enjoy bipartisan support. If we care
about our fellow human beings, we
should support revolution in El
Salvador, Guatemala and other
places struggling to rid themselves of
terrorist dictatorships.
As for Ortega's prediction of a
U.S. invasion proving false, potential
Reagan "freedom fighters" should
take note: The game isn't over yet.
