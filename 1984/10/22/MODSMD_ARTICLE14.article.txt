## Lottery is no chancy gamble 
### 
On Nov. 6 the California lottery proposition
(Proposition 37) will appear on the California bal
lot for the second time. Despite alleged inequity, 1
think it's a fair and effective means for raising
needed funds.
First and foremost, I believe in the goals of this
lottery. Second, I don't believe that the reported
negative aspects of the lottery are valid (in some
cases) or that the negatives are large enough to out
weigh the positives (in other cases).
I accept lotteries in general, but this lottery is es
pecially attractive because California lottery profits
are earmarked for public schools. As a result of
Proposition 13, California public schools have had
to rely largely on Sacramento for their funding.
This has undermined the ability of local school offi
cials to estimate and predict future funding levels.
Instead of being able to rely on a predictable
amount of money coming from property taxes,
local schools were left in a funding limbo subject to
the whim of state officials. The lottery funds will
obviously come through Sacramento as well, but
funding levels will ultimately be more reliable and
predictable. That constitutes a majot improvement
tor the public school system.
Lottery critics generally concede that increased
and more predictable revenues for schools are a
good thing. They tend to focus on the fact that well
over half of the tickets sold in states which now
have lotteries are sold to low income individuals.
As a result, critics claim a state lottery is really a tax
on the poor. Opponents feel the state shouldn't
entice people (via mass advertising) to waste
money on lottery tickets that they should be spend
ing elsewhere, especially when the chances of win
ning the lottery are miniscule at best. They feel the
state shouldn't condone such a practice. I disagree.
I wish low income individuals didn't buy between

60 and 80 percent of the lottery tickets available,
but they do. Nevertheless, it does not follow that a
lottery is therefore a tax on the poor. In my view, a
tax is something one is required to pay by law, not
something which one chooses to buy or chooses to
ignore.
As for the slate condoning gambling at the possi
ble expense of the poor, California has been con
doning gambling and profiting from it as long as
Sacramento has allowed racetracks to operate in

the state. Two wrongs don't make a right, but the
lottery will fit into an established practice, not
break through evil untested ground.
Clearly, part of what is behind my rejection of
lottery opponents' rationale is a fundamental liber
tarian view. I don't think it's the government's role
to determine how an individual spends his or her
money within legal contexts, and that includes
limiting certain choices available to him or her. The

label "lower income" doesn't give the government
any special right to control an individual's personal
spending habits. Neither is it society's role to deter
mine the proper spending practices of certain
income brackets.
Yet, that is what lottery critics are calling for. In
effect, they are asking voters to deny "low income"
individuals the choice to spend their money as they
may wish. Frankly, 1 don't think that's my business,
and I fear that the next proposition will involve a
group of voters asked to judge what the poor "can
handle" and what they should be able to do inde
pendently.
Clearly, the lottery is a complicated solution, and
it has drawbacks. But unfortunately there are no
simple answers. Proposition 13 showed that voters
won't (or at least didn't) accept generally increased
taxes even in support of social goods and services
like schools and police. A school-earmarked sales
tax would obviously hurt the poor more than it
would the wealthy. Property taxes to support
schools end up hitting fixed income elderly home
owners when they can least afford it. Wealthy
neighborhoods get good public schools, poor
neighborhoods get second-rate schools. In almost
every societal solution, someone gets the short end
of the stick, and it's usually the poor, the elderly,
the minorities and the underprivileged.
If we could find another more equitable and
politically feasible solution to the school funding
problem. I would support it. But, in the absence of
a general tax increase, the lottery stands as the
most feasible and equitable plan in the offing, and 1
reject opponents' claims that it is somehow moral
to limit the free choice of individuals based on their
economic status.
