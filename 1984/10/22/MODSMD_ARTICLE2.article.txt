# Program explores acquaintance rapes

### MARY YUH 
Today begins a two-week Rape
Awareness Series focusing on ac
quaintance rape. The annual series,
centering each year on a different
aspect of rape, is sponsored by the
Rape Education Project (REP).
"People don't realize that two
thirds of all rapes occur between
people who know each other," ac
cording to Doug McKenzie, a mem
ber of REP.
Acquaintance rape is the most
common and least publicized form of
rape. It occurs between relatives as
incest, between co-workers and
neighbors, and it occurs on dates. Be
cause the victim and the rapist know
each other, the stigma imposed by so
ciety on the victim is greater, the ten
dency to blame the victim is greater,
prosecution is harder and if the rapist
had been trusted and/or liked by the
victim, the emotional distress is
greater and the trauma of betrayal is
added.
'We want to create a dialogue
about the issue of rape," said Pilar
Ossorio, a REP member.
This year's Rape Awareness Series
is geared toward understanding ac
quaintance rape, its causes, its various
manifestations and the lifelong im
pact it has on the victim. "Breaking
the Silence: Understanding Incest
and Child Sexual Abuse" and
"Behind Closed Doors: Abuse in
Relationships" are programs that ex
plore coercive relationships and bring
the issue of rape to a very personal

level. In order to do that, REP ar
ranged to have as speakers women
who are both activists in rape educa
tion and survivors of rape.
It is "very important to come back
to what it feels like for the individual
— for yourself. You have to take it to
a personal level and feel the huge im
pact of rape," Ossorio said.
Rape is a "larger, societal problem
that has to do with the way we are so
cialized," said REP member Jim Os
wald. "I meet men who say 'I really
didn't think it was a man's issue.' It is.
It's a societal issue and society is
composed of women and men. But
it's a man's world. I see rape as part
of the problem of sexism, which in
turn is part of the problem of oppres
sion."
"Rape is at the extreme end of a
continuum of behavior and attitudes
concerning women — attitudes of
power and domination," added Os
sorio.
The aim of REP is to uncover these
attitudes, to educate people of their
existence throughout every level of
society and of their direct link to
rape."
"There is no specific rapist men
tality or tendency. Numerous studies
have been done on convicted rapists
and none uncovered any psychologi
cal trait common to being a rapist,"
Ossorio said. "That seems to indicate
that anyone can be a rapist. It makes
the contribution of society in tacitly
condoning rapes very important."
