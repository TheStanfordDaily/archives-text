## Fetter's admissions office applies itself 
### JOSEPH FIRSCHEIN 
The phone was ringing off the hook
as usual at the Stanford Admissions
Office. The secretary at the front
desk fielded three calls at once.
"Stanford admissions office please
hold," she said several times before
taking a call. The caller, like the pre
vious one, wanted an undergraduate
application.
The office is certainly a busy one.
In a short five minutes, as many as 10
people come in to ask about applica
tions. And the phone continues to
ring and ring.
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter
acknowledged the continuous
demand for applications. As of Oct.
7, the office had 19,501 inquiries for
undergraduate applications. Fetter
said that application inquiries are not
the only calls that the office has been
receiving.
"We constantly get calls from
people with many different types of
questions. They say, 'Tell me about
computer science at Stanford' or
'What courses do you offer in art his
tory?' or 'Does it make a difference
that I'm an alumnus' child?' " she
said.
Fetter said that it is important to
answer all of the calls and all of the
mail that comes into the office. To ac
complish this task, there are three
secretaries, in addition to the one at
the front desk, who do the immediate
dealing with the public.
The four directors of admissions
who are not visiting high schools are
also available to answer specific ques
tions about the admissions process
and about Stanford programs.
There is more to Stanford's admis
sions program than what goes on in
the office. The dean, two associate
deans and eight directors of admis
sions also spend time traveling
around the country. They visit be

tween 500 and 600 high schools each
year.
Fetter, who recently returned from
a trip to the East Coast, said that the
schedule on the road does not always
make for a relaxing life. In a typical
day they visit four schools. "We're in
a school for an hour, then jump in a
rental car, gulp down some lunch and
go to the next school."
Fetter's trip to the East was slightly
different than usual because she did
not only visit high schools. She also
went with six other Stanford admis
sions officers to a meeting of the Na
tional Association of College Admis
sions Counselors in Boston.
There were 2,600 counselors and
admissions deans at the conference
and Fetter spent an entire afternoon
handing out information on Stanford
to counselors. There were rows of
tables set up and the six people from
Stanford admissions worked in shifts
for most of the day.
After the meeting, Fetter went with
Associate Dean and Director of
Freshman Admissions John Bunnell
to visit several secondary schools and
colleges in the area. They visited
three prep schools in New England
which have had applicants to Stan
ford in the past.
With 26,000 high schools in the
United States, the admissions office
tries to be systematic in the choice of
which to visit. "It is done partly on
the basis of which schools are the
traditionally good feeder schools —
those with the most academic excel
lence and diversity," Fetter said.
Stanford gets requests from
hundreds of schools each year to visit
the campus and attend college nights.
Bunnell plans the schedule of visits,
which runs up until Thanksgiving.
According to Bunnell, the admis
sions office hopes to generate interest

in Stanford through these trips. But
Bunnell also said the high school trips
serve another function.
"They give us a better understand
ing of secondary schools on the stu
dents own turf. We also get to visit
with counselors and find out what's
happening in curriculum changes," he
said.
Once a school trip is planned, the
school will post a notice of the visit
and will hook a room. The admissions
officer spends an hour talking about
the opportunities at Stanford and the
students have a chance to ask ques
tions.
The admissions officers are ex
pected to know details about financial
aid and the admissions decision
making process. They are also ex
pected to know all of the information
in the publication "Stanford Today."
There are members of the admis
sions staff who also know about op
portunities for Chicano, black, and
Native American students.
Aside from discussing Stanford
programs, the admissions staff is also
interested in how high school pro
grams are preparing students. Fetter
stressed the importance of the link
between the college admissions office
and the high school admissions coun
selors.
This communication includes infor
mation from Stanford on the proper
academic preparation on the part of
the student entering college. The of
fice sends a letter to high schools en
titled "A Memo to Secondary
Schools, Students and Parents" which
discusses proper academic prepara
tion in high school.
The memo shows four sample high
school programs of varying strength.
The four examples are from actual
transcripts of applicants to Stanford.
They range from Student A, who
took eight solid classes in 10th grade

— to Student D, who took only two
solids and four non-solid classes.
Program B, still regarded as
"heavy" by the admissions office,
represents about 30 percent of Stan

ford applicants in a given year. Stu
dent C's program is "medium" in
strength and is the most common
among Stanford applicants.
"The memo is a way of passing our

expectations on to the schools," Fet
ter said. It is dated October 1978 and
had its l()th printing in September
1984, "There was a lot of work put
into that and it is still current."

three prep schools in New England
which have had applicants to Stan
ford in the past.
With 26,000 high schools in the
United States, the admissions office
tries to be systematic in the choice of
which to visit. "It is done partly on
the basis of which schools are the
traditionally good feeder schools —
those with the most academic excel
lence and diversity," Fetter said.
Stanford gets requests from
hundreds of schools each year to visit
the campus and attend college nights.
Bunnell plans the schedule of visits,
which runs up until Thanksgiving.
According to Bunnell, the admis
sions office hopes to generate interest

in Stanford through these trips. But
Bunnell also said the high school trips
serve another function.
"They give us a better understand
ing of secondary schools on the stu
dents own turf. We also get to visit
with counselors and find out what's
happening in curriculum changes," he
said.
Once a school trip is planned, the
school will post a notice of the visit
and will hook a room. The admissions
officer spends an hour talking about
the opportunities at Stanford and the
students have a chance to ask ques
tions.
The admissions officers are ex
pected to know details about financial
aid and the admissions decision
making process. They are also ex
pected to know all of the information
in the publication "Stanford Today."
There are members of the admis
sions staff who also know about op
portunities for Chicano, black, and
Native American students.
Aside from discussing Stanford
programs, the admissions staff is also
interested in how high school pro
grams are preparing students. Fetter
stressed the importance of the link
between the college admissions office
and the high school admissions coun
selors.
This communication includes infor
mation from Stanford on the proper
academic preparation on the part of
the student entering college. The of
fice sends a letter to high schools en
titled "A Memo to Secondary
Schools, Students and Parents" which
discusses proper academic prepara
tion in high school.
The memo shows four sample high
school programs of varying strength.
The four examples are from actual
transcripts of applicants to Stanford.
They range from Student A, who
took eight solid classes in 10th grade

— to Student D, who took only two
solids and four non-solid classes.
Program B, still regarded as
"heavy" by the admissions office,
represents about 30 percent of Stan

ford applicants in a given year. Stu
dent C's program is "medium" in
strength and is the most common
among Stanford applicants.
"The memo is a way of passing our

expectations on to the schools," Fet
ter said. It is dated October 1978 and
had its l()th printing in September
1984, "There was a lot of work put
into that and it is still current."

Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter and her admissions office crew must deal with all facets of the application
process. Stanford admissions officers often leave the Farm to spread information about Stanford to high
schools all over the country.
The phone was ringing off the hook
as usual at the Stanford Admissions
Office. The secretary at the front
desk fielded three calls at once.
"Stanford admissions office please
hold," she said several times before
taking a call. The caller, like the pre
vious one, wanted an undergraduate
application.
The office is certainly a busy one.
In a short five minutes, as many as 10
people come in to ask about applica
tions. And the phone continues to
ring and ring.
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter
acknowledged the continuous
demand for applications. As of Oct.
7, the office had 19,501 inquiries for
undergraduate applications. Fetter
said that application inquiries are not
the only calls that the office has been
receiving.
"We constantly get calls from
people with many different types of
questions. They say, 'Tell me about
computer science at Stanford' or
'What courses do you offer in art his
tory?' or 'Does it make a difference
that I'm an alumnus' child?' " she
said.
Fetter said that it is important to
answer all of the calls and all of the
mail that comes into the office. To ac
complish this task, there are three
secretaries, in addition to the one at
the front desk, who do the immediate
dealing with the public.
The four directors of admissions
who are not visiting high schools are
also available to answer specific ques
tions about the admissions process
and about Stanford programs.
There is more to Stanford's admis
sions program than what goes on in
the office. The dean, two associate
deans and eight directors of admis
sions also spend time traveling
around the country. They visit be

tween 500 and 600 high schools each
year.
Fetter, who recently returned from
a trip to the East Coast, said that the
schedule on the road does not always
make for a relaxing life. In a typical
day they visit four schools. "We're in
a school for an hour, then jump in a
rental car, gulp down some lunch and
go to the next school."
Fetter's trip to the East was slightly
different than usual because she did
not only visit high schools. She also
went with six other Stanford admis
sions officers to a meeting of the Na
tional Association of College Admis
sions Counselors in Boston.
There were 2,600 counselors and
admissions deans at the conference
and Fetter spent an entire afternoon
handing out information on Stanford
to counselors. There were rows of
tables set up and the six people from
Stanford admissions worked in shifts
for most of the day.
After the meeting, Fetter went with
Associate Dean and Director of
Freshman Admissions John Bunnell
to visit several secondary schools and
colleges in the area. They visited
three prep schools in New England
which have had applicants to Stan
ford in the past.
