# The

### 
Don't be confused by the sign over the door.
"The Stanford Dairy/' it says. Inside the barn
door you'll find a wide selection of Farm-fresh
story ideas, just waiting to be milked for all
they're worth.
So don't kowtow to academic pressures. Drop
by The Dairy and pick up an assignment today on
the bovine beat.
Moo.
