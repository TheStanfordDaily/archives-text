## Stanford lets a big lead get away 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford is not America's football
team, but on Saturday it did have one
thing in common with America's
baseball team, the Chicago Cubs.
The ability to fold.
Stanford watched the game — and
perhaps its season — slip away Satur
day afternoon against a Washington
State University team that specializes
in coming back from seemingly insur
mountable deficits.
At halftime, the Cardinal led 28-7.
In the third quarter, it had leads of
35-7 and 42-14.
And when it was over, three hours
and 15 minutes after it started, Stan
ford was on the short end of a 49-42
score.
"I'm not sure I can remember a
tougher loss," a dejected and dis
gusted Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said. "No, I don't think I can."
Stanford, which dropped to 3-4
overall and 1-3 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, now will be hard-pressed to
salvage its first winning season since
1 980. Three of its final four games
are on the road, and its sole remain
ing home contest is against Pac-10
leader USC.
"We're going to have to come back
(next week at Oregon State Univer
sity)," Elway said. "They (the
players) are emotionally down, obvi
ously. You don't like to see this hap
pen to you."
In the second half alone, the
Cougar offense rocked a lackluster
Cardinal defense for 362 yards in
total offense and seven touchdowns,
including five in the final 18:20 of the
game. The WSU defense forced four
second-half Stanford turnovers —
three pass interceptions and one
fumble.
"I think they (Stanford) relaxed." a
jubilant WSU Coach Jim Walden
said. "It's a very natural situation to
get that far ahead of someone and
relax. Then it's tough to get your
motor running again.
"It's a tragic way to get beat, hut
it's a great way to win," he continued.
"We've had our tragedies the last two
weeks, so maybe it was our turn to
win a squeaker."
Maybe it was. In its first two Pac
-10 games against USC and UCLA,
WSU came back from big third
quarter deficits only to lose both

games in the final seconds by a total
of five points.
On Saturday the Cougars again dug
themselves a hole and, again, they
climbed out. Only this time they
didn't fall back in.
"We've been down before, but we
clawed and scratched and got some
breaks that we capitalized on. That's
how it goes," Cougar running back
Rueben Mayes said. Mayes rushed
for 216 yards and scored five touch
downs.
With 3:20 left, Mayes turned a
simple pitch right into a 22-yard
touchdown run to put the Cougars
ahead for the first time, 49-42. WSU
still almost lost its third straight game
in the waning moments.
Quarterback Fred Buckley took
the Cardinal offense to WSU's 18
yard-line with 0:53 to go. Two plays
and 21 seconds later, Buckley and
company had a first and goal from the
eight.
Buckley threw passes safely out of
the end zone on first and second
down, and then ate the ball for a two
yard loss on third down. Stanford
called its final time-out with 0:15 left
to set up its fourth-and-goal play.
"I was chased out of the pocket on
the last play," Buckley said. "It was a
counter play. I faked a screen (pass)
to the right, then a draw (play) and
then went to Muster on the left (with
a screen pass)."
Muster — and Stanford's final
chance to win or tie — was knocked
out of bounds six yards short of the
goal line. On trotted quarterback
Mark Rypien and the Cougar offense.
Rypien fell on the ball and WSU had
defeated Stanford for the first time
since 1972.
"When we were down 42-14, I was
thinking that 'we have to find a way
out of this,' " Rypien said. "We finally
got the breaks to go our way, and that
proved to be the difference."
However, things didn't start going
WSU's way until midway through the
third quarter, ironically when Stan
ford was threatening to make a 35-7
lead even bigger. The Cardinal had
the ball third and six from the Cougar
seven, and Buckley dropped back to
pass.
"It was supposed to be a play
action (pass)," a dazed Buckley ex
plained. "I don't know. I was scram
bling and trying to get the ball to

Kevin Scott."
Instead, he got the ball to Cougar
saftey Ron Collins, who made his first
of three interceptions. Nine plays and
96 yards later, Rypien found Sammy
Burris in the end zone to cut Stan
ford's lead to 35-14, and completed a
14-point turnaround.
Stanford took 1 7 seconds to return
the favor, as Scott raced 70 yards
down the left sideline for his third
touchdown of the game. Scott
finished with 174 yards on 15 carries,
including another touchdown run for
47 yards.
But Scott gave WSU a touchdown
early in the fourth quarter when he
fumbled a kick-off at the five-yard
line following a WSU touchdown that
made the score 42-27. It took Mayes
one play — an option pitch left — and
a successful two-point conversion —
a pass from Rypien to John Marshall

— to pull the Cougars within one
touchdown, 42-35.
"When we scored and got the two
pointer, I had a feeling in my heart we
were going to win the football game,"
Walden said. "I really did. At that
point, 1 said, 'Hey, now they're in
trouble.' "
The Stanford defense got itself into
big trouble with 5:35 left, when it was
caught blitzing on a second-and-20
play from the Washington State 47.
Rypien made the blitzing Cardinal
defenders pay the price when he
tossed a short screen pass to Mayes
on the right side. Mayes looked up
field and saw no one in red jerseys
between him and the end zone.
Mayes: "I just said, 'Hey, touch
down.' " The scoreboard: 42-42.
Mayes fifth and final touchdown
came with 3:06 to go, after Buckley
threw his second pass to Collins —

Buckley's second-leading receiver in
the game. The Cougars turned that
miscue into seven points four plays
later, when Mayes ran 22 yards un
touched into the end zone.
"I guess it goes down as one of the
weirdest, maybe the most fun
(games) you'll ever have in your life,"
Walden said. "To be that far down
and to come back to win ... it gives
you a lot of material for speeches."
But Walden's post-game speech to
reporters wasn't all on the miraculous
comeback. In fact, he spent a good
deal of it talking about his teams'
deficiencies in the first three quarters,
particularly the two blocked punts
that led to two Cardinal touchdowns.
"I want to compliment Stanford's
ability to take advantage of our kick
ing game," Walden said. "They just
exploited us. There was one punt (the
second one Stanford blocked) when

we had only 10 guys on the field and
they stuck it up our fanny."
Although each blocked punt
yielded a touchdown, Stanford
squandered numerous other opportu
nities to build bigger leads.
"We had all kinds of chances in the
first half to catch the ball and get in
terceptions," Elway said. He was re
ferring to three sure interceptions
that Cardinal defenders dropped, the
first of which cornerback Eric Price
would have easily returned for a
touchdown.
"We're not so wishy-washy that if
we lose a couple of games like this
that we're going to pack it in," Buck
lev said.
Card notes
Tight end Eric Snelson, who was
carted off the field in the second half,
has a sprained left knee and a thigh
contusion.


The Stanford offense produced 42 points without the services of quar
terback John Paye. Unfortunately that provided little solace for Paye,

line following a WSU touchdown that
made the score 42-27. It took Mayes
one play — an option pitch left — and
a successful two-point conversion —
a pass from Rypien to John Marshall

— to pull the Cougars within one
touchdown, 42-35.
"When we scored and got the two
pointer, I had a feeling in my heart we
were going to win the football game,"
Walden said. "I really did. At that
point, 1 said, 'Hey, now they're in
trouble.' "
The Stanford defense got itself into
big trouble with 5:35 left, when it was
caught blitzing on a second-and-20
play from the Washington State 47.
Rypien made the blitzing Cardinal
defenders pay the price when he
tossed a short screen pass to Mayes
on the right side. Mayes looked up
field and saw no one in red jerseys
between him and the end zone.
Mayes: "I just said, 'Hey, touch
down.' " The scoreboard: 42-42.
Mayes fifth and final touchdown
came with 3:06 to go, after Buckley
threw his second pass to Collins —

Buckley's second-leading receiver in
the game. The Cougars turned that
miscue into seven points four plays
later, when Mayes ran 22 yards un
touched into the end zone.
"I guess it goes down as one of the
weirdest, maybe the most fun
(games) you'll ever have in your life,"
Walden said. "To be that far down
and to come back to win ... it gives
you a lot of material for speeches."
But Walden's post-game speech to
reporters wasn't all on the miraculous
comeback. In fact, he spent a good
deal of it talking about his teams'
deficiencies in the first three quarters,
particularly the two blocked punts
that led to two Cardinal touchdowns.
"I want to compliment Stanford's
ability to take advantage of our kick
ing game," Walden said. "They just
exploited us. There was one punt (the
second one Stanford blocked) when

we had only 10 guys on the field and
they stuck it up our fanny."
Although each blocked punt
yielded a touchdown, Stanford
squandered numerous other opportu
nities to build bigger leads.
"We had all kinds of chances in the
first half to catch the ball and get in
terceptions," Elway said. He was re
ferring to three sure interceptions
that Cardinal defenders dropped, the
first of which cornerback Eric Price
would have easily returned for a
touchdown.
"We're not so wishy-washy that if
we lose a couple of games like this
that we're going to pack it in," Buck
lev said.

The Stanford offense produced 42 points without the services of quar
terback John Paye. Unfortunately that provided little solace for Paye,

Rod Searcey/Daily
as the Cardinal lost a big lead and then couldn't score in the final
seconds, losing to Washington State, 49-42.
Stanford is not America's football
team, but on Saturday it did have one
thing in common with America's
baseball team, the Chicago Cubs.
The ability to fold.
Stanford watched the game — and
perhaps its season — slip away Satur
day afternoon against a Washington
State University team that specializes
in coming back from seemingly insur
mountable deficits.
At halftime, the Cardinal led 28-7.
In the third quarter, it had leads of
35-7 and 42-14.
And when it was over, three hours
and 15 minutes after it started, Stan
ford was on the short end of a 49-42
score.
"I'm not sure I can remember a
tougher loss," a dejected and dis
gusted Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said. "No, I don't think I can."
Stanford, which dropped to 3-4
overall and 1-3 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, now will be hard-pressed to
salvage its first winning season since
1 980. Three of its final four games
are on the road, and its sole remain
ing home contest is against Pac-10
leader USC.
"We're going to have to come back
(next week at Oregon State Univer
sity)," Elway said. "They (the
players) are emotionally down, obvi
ously. You don't like to see this hap
pen to you."
In the second half alone, the
Cougar offense rocked a lackluster
Cardinal defense for 362 yards in
total offense and seven touchdowns,
including five in the final 18:20 of the
game. The WSU defense forced four
second-half Stanford turnovers —
three pass interceptions and one
fumble.
"I think they (Stanford) relaxed." a
jubilant WSU Coach Jim Walden
said. "It's a very natural situation to
get that far ahead of someone and
relax. Then it's tough to get your
motor running again.
"It's a tragic way to get beat, hut
it's a great way to win," he continued.
"We've had our tragedies the last two
weeks, so maybe it was our turn to
win a squeaker."
Maybe it was. In its first two Pac
-10 games against USC and UCLA,
WSU came back from big third
quarter deficits only to lose both

games in the final seconds by a total
of five points.
On Saturday the Cougars again dug
themselves a hole and, again, they
climbed out. Only this time they
didn't fall back in.
"We've been down before, but we
clawed and scratched and got some
breaks that we capitalized on. That's
how it goes," Cougar running back
Rueben Mayes said. Mayes rushed
for 216 yards and scored five touch
downs.
With 3:20 left, Mayes turned a
simple pitch right into a 22-yard
touchdown run to put the Cougars
ahead for the first time, 49-42. WSU
still almost lost its third straight game
in the waning moments.
Quarterback Fred Buckley took
the Cardinal offense to WSU's 18
yard-line with 0:53 to go. Two plays
and 21 seconds later, Buckley and
company had a first and goal from the
eight.
Buckley threw passes safely out of
the end zone on first and second
down, and then ate the ball for a two
yard loss on third down. Stanford
called its final time-out with 0:15 left
to set up its fourth-and-goal play.
"I was chased out of the pocket on
the last play," Buckley said. "It was a
counter play. I faked a screen (pass)
to the right, then a draw (play) and
then went to Muster on the left (with
a screen pass)."
Muster — and Stanford's final
chance to win or tie — was knocked
out of bounds six yards short of the
goal line. On trotted quarterback
Mark Rypien and the Cougar offense.
Rypien fell on the ball and WSU had
defeated Stanford for the first time
since 1972.
"When we were down 42-14, I was
thinking that 'we have to find a way
out of this,' " Rypien said. "We finally
got the breaks to go our way, and that
proved to be the difference."
However, things didn't start going
WSU's way until midway through the
third quarter, ironically when Stan
ford was threatening to make a 35-7
lead even bigger. The Cardinal had
the ball third and six from the Cougar
seven, and Buckley dropped back to
pass.
"It was supposed to be a play
action (pass)," a dazed Buckley ex
plained. "I don't know. I was scram
bling and trying to get the ball to

Kevin Scott."
Instead, he got the ball to Cougar
saftey Ron Collins, who made his first
of three interceptions. Nine plays and
96 yards later, Rypien found Sammy
Burris in the end zone to cut Stan
ford's lead to 35-14, and completed a
14-point turnaround.
Stanford took 1 7 seconds to return
the favor, as Scott raced 70 yards
down the left sideline for his third
touchdown of the game. Scott
finished with 174 yards on 15 carries,
including another touchdown run for
47 yards.
But Scott gave WSU a touchdown
early in the fourth quarter when he
fumbled a kick-off at the five-yard
line following a WSU touchdown that
made the score 42-27. It took Mayes
one play — an option pitch left — and

of five points.
On Saturday the Cougars again dug
themselves a hole and, again, they
climbed out. Only this time they
didn't fall back in.
"We've been down before, but we
clawed and scratched and got some
breaks that we capitalized on. That's
how it goes," Cougar running back
Rueben Mayes said. Mayes rushed
for 216 yards and scored five touch
downs.
With 3:20 left, Mayes turned a
simple pitch right into a 22-yard
touchdown run to put the Cougars
ahead for the first time, 49-42. WSU
still almost lost its third straight game
in the waning moments.
Quarterback Fred Buckley took
the Cardinal offense to WSU's 18
yard-line with 0:53 to go. Two plays
and 21 seconds later, Buckley and
company had a first and goal from the
eight.
Buckley threw passes safely out of
the end zone on first and second
down, and then ate the ball for a two
yard loss on third down. Stanford
called its final time-out with 0:15 left
to set up its fourth-and-goal play.
"I was chased out of the pocket on
the last play," Buckley said. "It was a
counter play. I faked a screen (pass)
to the right, then a draw (play) and
then went to Muster on the left (with
a screen pass)."
Muster — and Stanford's final
chance to win or tie — was knocked
out of bounds six yards short of the
goal line. On trotted quarterback
Mark Rypien and the Cougar offense.
Rypien fell on the ball and WSU had
defeated Stanford for the first time
since 1972.
"When we were down 42-14, I was
thinking that 'we have to find a way
out of this,' " Rypien said. "We finally
got the breaks to go our way, and that
proved to be the difference."
However, things didn't start going
WSU's way until midway through the
third quarter, ironically when Stan
ford was threatening to make a 35-7
lead even bigger. The Cardinal had
the ball third and six from the Cougar
seven, and Buckley dropped back to
pass.
"It was supposed to be a play
action (pass)," a dazed Buckley ex
plained. "I don't know. I was scram
bling and trying to get the ball to

Kevin Scott."
Instead, he got the ball to Cougar
saftey Ron Collins, who made his first
of three interceptions. Nine plays and
96 yards later, Rypien found Sammy
Burris in the end zone to cut Stan
ford's lead to 35-14, and completed a
14-point turnaround.
Stanford took 1 7 seconds to return
the favor, as Scott raced 70 yards
down the left sideline for his third
touchdown of the game. Scott
finished with 174 yards on 15 carries,
including another touchdown run for
47 yards.
But Scott gave WSU a touchdown
early in the fourth quarter when he
fumbled a kick-off at the five-yard
line following a WSU touchdown that
made the score 42-27. It took Mayes
one play — an option pitch left — and
a successful two-point conversion —
a pass from Rypien to John Marshall

— to pull the Cougars within one
touchdown, 42-35.
"When we scored and got the two
pointer, I had a feeling in my heart we
were going to win the football game,"
Walden said. "I really did. At that
point, 1 said, 'Hey, now they're in
trouble.' "
The Stanford defense got itself into
big trouble with 5:35 left, when it was
caught blitzing on a second-and-20
play from the Washington State 47.
Rypien made the blitzing Cardinal
defenders pay the price when he
tossed a short screen pass to Mayes
on the right side. Mayes looked up
field and saw no one in red jerseys
between him and the end zone.
Mayes: "I just said, 'Hey, touch
down.' " The scoreboard: 42-42.
Mayes fifth and final touchdown
came with 3:06 to go, after Buckley
threw his second pass to Collins —

Buckley's second-leading receiver in
the game. The Cougars turned that
miscue into seven points four plays
later, when Mayes ran 22 yards un
touched into the end zone.
"I guess it goes down as one of the
weirdest, maybe the most fun
(games) you'll ever have in your life,"
Walden said. "To be that far down
and to come back to win ... it gives
you a lot of material for speeches."
But Walden's post-game speech to
reporters wasn't all on the miraculous
comeback. In fact, he spent a good
deal of it talking about his teams'
deficiencies in the first three quarters,
particularly the two blocked punts
that led to two Cardinal touchdowns.
"I want to compliment Stanford's
ability to take advantage of our kick
ing game," Walden said. "They just
exploited us. There was one punt (the
second one Stanford blocked) when

we had only 10 guys on the field and
they stuck it up our fanny."
Although each blocked punt
yielded a touchdown, Stanford
squandered numerous other opportu
nities to build bigger leads.
"We had all kinds of chances in the
first half to catch the ball and get in
terceptions," Elway said. He was re
ferring to three sure interceptions
that Cardinal defenders dropped, the
first of which cornerback Eric Price
would have easily returned for a
touchdown.
"We're not so wishy-washy that if
we lose a couple of games like this
that we're going to pack it in," Buck
lev said.
Card notes
Tight end Eric Snelson, who was
carted off the field in the second half,
has a sprained left knee and a thigh
contusion.


The Stanford offense produced 42 points without the services of quar
terback John Paye. Unfortunately that provided little solace for Paye,

Rod Searcey/Daily
as the Cardinal lost a big lead and then couldn't score in the final
seconds, losing to Washington State, 49-42.
