# Cougar running back has an a-Mayes-ing day
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Washington State University Coach Jim Walden was
"obviously pleased" with his team's come-from
behind 49-42 victory over Stanford Saturday.
But Walden admitted he didn't think his team had a
chance to come back when it was behind 35-7 and 42-
14 in the third quarter. However, after a Kevin Scott
fumble on a kickoff set up a Cougar touchdown that
cut Stanford's lead to 42-35, Walden changed his
mind.
"After we got that break on the kickoff," Walden
said, "I thought, 'Hey, we could make a run at them.' "
Sure enough, the Cougars made a run at Stanford
and did so successfully. But it was junior running back

Rueben Mayes who did the running.
The 6-foot, 200-pound Mayes carried 29 times for
216 yards, caught one pass for 53 yards and scored five
touchdowns. That includes touchdown runs of 53, 39
and 22 yards and the touchdown reception.
Mayes' 216-yard effort, his second 200-yard game
this season, made him the Pacific 10 Conference's
leading rusher. In seven games, he has rushed for 861
yards on 139 carries. He is averaging 123 yards per
game and 6.2 yards per carry. His five touchdowns also
gave him a league-leading total of eight.
"This was the biggest win of the season for us,"
Mayes said, "and it was the best game I've played."
Played in college, he is quick to point out. Mayes,
who attended North Battleford Comprehensive High
in Saskatchewan, Canada, said he once rushed for 380
yards and scored six touchdowns in a high school game.
In fact, Mayes averaged more than 200 yards rushing
per game in both his junior and senior years of high
school.
Besides his excellent running instincts, Mayes is flat
out fast. As a junior in high school, he ran a 10.8
second 100 meters and, as a senior, was clocked at 5.87
over half that distance.

"When I get into the open, I don't want to get caught
(from behind)," Mayes said. "1 got caught for the first
time in my life against UCLA (last week) and I said,
'That's it. I don't want to get caught again.' "
The quarterback who was handing the ball to Mayes,
Mark Rypien, agreed that Mayes had a fine day. He
also was quick to give credit where it was due.
"He had a great day, but he didn't do it by himself,"
Rypien said. "You don't make 216 yards with the
other 10 guys going out there and falling down. The of
fensive line and receivers blocked well. They are the
best blocking receivers in the nation."
Mayes also praised his line. Then he "paid" them.
"Hey, o-line," he shouted across the locker room. "I'm
taking you guys out for supper Sunday night."

Tackle Jamie White is one of those who ate last night
on Mayes' tab. "Rueben really sets up the blocks
well," 1 he said. "We try to let him make us look good."
White said the Cougars' most successful play against
the Cardinal defense was an outside dive. "It wasn't
gaining the big yards, but it got six or seven yards each
time," he said. "It forced them to respect our inside
blocks."
Mayes certainly showed his worth to the Cougars
Saturday, but the scary thing is that he may not be their
best running back. Kerry Porter, also a junior, rushed
for 1,000 yards on 195 carries last season but was lost
early this season with a shoulder injury.
"Last year, I hurt my shoulder and he (Porter) got
the ball," Mayes said. "And this year, he hurt his
shoulder and I'm getting the ball."
Walden, however, is just trying to get both players
healthy at the same time. "We've had those two guys
for two years and we can't seem to get both of them in
the backfield at the same time," he said. "But it seems
whenever one's gone, the other one seems to do what
we have to do.
"If the good Lord is good to us, maybe next year we'll
finally have them both," Walden said.
Good Lord.

healthy at the same time. "We've had those two guys
for two years and we can't seem to get both of them in
the backfield at the same time," he said. "But it seems
whenever one's gone, the other one seems to do what
we have to do.
"If the good Lord is good to us, maybe next year we'll
finally have them both," Walden said.
Good Lord.

By the end of Saturday's game this sight became very familiar, as Washington State's Reuben Mayes
runs for one his five touchdowns. Mayes took over the Pac-10 rushing lead with 216 yards on 29
carries
Washington State University Coach Jim Walden was
"obviously pleased" with his team's come-from
behind 49-42 victory over Stanford Saturday.
But Walden admitted he didn't think his team had a
chance to come back when it was behind 35-7 and 42-
14 in the third quarter. However, after a Kevin Scott
fumble on a kickoff set up a Cougar touchdown that
cut Stanford's lead to 42-35, Walden changed his
mind.
"After we got that break on the kickoff," Walden
said, "I thought, 'Hey, we could make a run at them.' "
Sure enough, the Cougars made a run at Stanford
and did so successfully. But it was junior running back

Rueben Mayes who did the running.
The 6-foot, 200-pound Mayes carried 29 times for
216 yards, caught one pass for 53 yards and scored five
touchdowns. That includes touchdown runs of 53, 39
and 22 yards and the touchdown reception.
Mayes' 216-yard effort, his second 200-yard game
this season, made him the Pacific 10 Conference's
leading rusher. In seven games, he has rushed for 861
yards on 139 carries. He is averaging 123 yards per
game and 6.2 yards per carry. His five touchdowns also
gave him a league-leading total of eight.
"This was the biggest win of the season for us,"
Mayes said, "and it was the best game I've played."
Played in college, he is quick to point out. Mayes,
who attended North Battleford Comprehensive High
in Saskatchewan, Canada, said he once rushed for 380
yards and scored six touchdowns in a high school game.
In fact, Mayes averaged more than 200 yards rushing
per game in both his junior and senior years of high
school.
Besides his excellent running instincts, Mayes is flat
out fast. As a junior in high school, he ran a 10.8
second 100 meters and, as a senior, was clocked at 5.87
over half that distance.

"When I get into the open, I don't want to get caught
(from behind)," Mayes said. "1 got caught for the first
time in my life against UCLA (last week) and I said,
'That's it. I don't want to get caught again.' "
The quarterback who was handing the ball to Mayes,
Mark Rypien, agreed that Mayes had a fine day. He
also was quick to give credit where it was due.
"He had a great day, but he didn't do it by himself,"
Rypien said. "You don't make 216 yards with the
other 10 guys going out there and falling down. The of
fensive line and receivers blocked well. They are the
best blocking receivers in the nation."
Mayes also praised his line. Then he "paid" them.
"Hey, o-line," he shouted across the locker room. "I'm
taking you guys out for supper Sunday night."

Tackle Jamie White is one of those who ate last night
on Mayes' tab. "Rueben really sets up the blocks
well," 1 he said. "We try to let him make us look good."
White said the Cougars' most successful play against
the Cardinal defense was an outside dive. "It wasn't
gaining the big yards, but it got six or seven yards each
time," he said. "It forced them to respect our inside
blocks."
Mayes certainly showed his worth to the Cougars
Saturday, but the scary thing is that he may not be their
best running back. Kerry Porter, also a junior, rushed
for 1,000 yards on 195 carries last season but was lost
early this season with a shoulder injury.
"Last year, I hurt my shoulder and he (Porter) got
the ball," Mayes said. "And this year, he hurt his
shoulder and I'm getting the ball."
Walden, however, is just trying to get both players
healthy at the same time. "We've had those two guys
for two years and we can't seem to get both of them in
the backfield at the same time," he said. "But it seems
whenever one's gone, the other one seems to do what
we have to do.
"If the good Lord is good to us, maybe next year we'll
finally have them both," Walden said.
Good Lord.
