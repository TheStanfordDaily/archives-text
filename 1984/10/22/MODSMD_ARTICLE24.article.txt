# Women's volleyball moves closer to first
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team moved a step closer to first
place in the Western Collegiate Ath
letic Association Friday evening by
beating San Diego State University,
15-11, 15-7, 15-6.
Stanford, ranked No. 4 in the na
tion, is 9-2 overall and 6-1 in the
WCAA. San Diego State is in first
place in the WCAA with an overall
record of 22-5 and a conference
record of 7-1.
Going into Friday's game, the Az
tecs were one of the most successful
teams in the nation, having won eight
consecutive matches. Stanford has
also been playing well and has not
lost a conference match since Sept.
22, when it was defeated by No. 1-
ranked USC.
In its last two matches against San
Diego State and UCLA, the Cardinal
has compiled a hitting percentage of
.505. Hitting percentages above .300
are considered good. Also, Stanford
has made only three hitting errors,
which come from balls hit into the net
or out of bounds, in its last 95 attacks.
The statistics are complimentary,
but it's more than just the offense re
sponsible for the numbers. According
to Cardinal Asst. Coach Don Shaw,
Stanford has done well against teams
like San Diego State and UCLA be
cause it has controlled opponents'
serves.
"We've done a pretty good job of
passing the ball lately," Shaw said.
"We're taking the service advantage
away with good ball control."
San Diego State relies on flat,
floating serves, but controlled Car
dinal passing and 14 service errors
hurt the Aztecs. "The sideouts
frustrated them," Cardinal setter
Deidra Dvorak said. "They depend
on their serves and we managed to
handle them pretty well."
San Diego State Head Coach Rudy
Suwara was unpleased by his team's
serving performance, and he asked
that the floor remain clear after the
match so his players could practice.
The Aztecs then served for a half
hour.
San Diego State's playing was char
acterized by several unforced errors
and mental serving errors. Early in
the first game, four Aztec players
watched a passed ball hit the floor.
There was miscommunication on
several low sets as well. In some in
stances, an Aztec setter would set low
and the hitter would be forced to
either make a late approach or no ap
proach.
San Diego State was further
plagued with problems when it lost
the second game because of a sub

stitution error. "The player (to be
substituted) had probably come in
too many times," Shaw said. "There
was a delay of game, and because San
Diego didn't have any more timeouts,
the point was called."
Despite their mistakes, the A/tecs
could look to Angela Rock for good
play. Rock and Stanford's Kim Oden
had a game-high 16 kills. "She has in
credible talent â€” she can sky," Shaw
said of Rock. "But one player can't
carry the load. We've seen that with
Kim. No one person can ever do it
all."

Helping carry the load for Stanford
were setters Deidra Dvorak, who had
27 assists, and Wendi Rush, who had
23 assists. Bobbie Broer had 10 kills,
a .563 hitting percentage and played
well defensively, with open-handed
digs from the floor.
Susan Compton and Barbara Fon
tana hit consistently from the outside
as well. Fontana, a sophomore from
Manhattan Beach, said, "We've
really been clicking since the UCLA
game. I can't explain why. We're all
just playing well at the same time. I
don't know how else to explain it."
