# Two close victories for polo team
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
It might have taken four quarters of regulation and two
three-minute overtimes, but the Stanford water polo team
defeated UCLA 6-5 Friday afternoon.
Although they try not to emphasize the highs of vic
tories or the lows of defeat, the Cardinal players seemed
more pleased than usual with their triumph.
"Our great defense, especially that of goalie Steve
Moyer, was what won the game for us," Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "We held them to five goals, and
if we can do that, then we should win. Our players knew
we should win, and we came from behind and did it."
For Moyer, a senior, the victory had special signifi
cance. "This is the last game of my career against UCLA,
and it is certainly very satisfying to be able to finish off
with a victory as sweet as this one is," he said.
Stanford was also successful Saturday morning when it
got revenge for its 7-6 Oct. 14 loss to the University of
California at Irvine with a 7-5 victory over the Anteaters.
Although behind by two goals going into the final quar
ter of the match against UCLA, the Cardinal was able to
even the score and put the game into overtime, thanks to
critical scoring plays by sophomore Craig Klass and fresh
man Erich Fisher.
Klass, who also had three assists in the match, scored
with 2:23 remaining in the fourth quarter to bring the
Cardinal within one goal, 5-4. Fisher, assisted by sopho
more Chris Thompson, scored with 1:10 left to tie the
game. According to Dettamanti, that play was perhaps the

most critical one of the game.
"The pass Thompson threw to Fisher is one we never
throw, it is usually just too difficult to score on," Detta
manti said. "Thompson read the defense, he saw Fisher
open and he acted. 1 couldn't have been happier with his
choice of action."
Thompson was also pleased with the play, as well as the
victory. "It was super to see the way the team pulled to
gether when we were behind," Thompson said. "We
didn't let ourselves get fazed, but instead we psyched our
selves up and did what we had to do to win."
The Cardinal, ranked second in the nation, raised its
Pacific 10 Conference record to 3-0 while the sixth
ranked Bruins dropped to 0-3. Stanford is now automati
cally eligible to compete in the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association championships, which will be held at
Long Beach Nov. 24 and 25.
In contrast with the UCLA game, Saturday's match
against UC-Irvine was slowly paced, according to Detta
manti.
"We dominated them very well throughout the match,
even though we were playing fairly conservative water
polo much of the time," Dettamanti said. "Our defense
was super, once again, but I don't feel our offense was
playing up to par. We just were not controlling the ball
well enough and, consequently, there were far too many
offensive turnovers that reduced our chances of scoring."
Cardinal junior Jaime Velez scored four goals against
UC-Irvine, and his 44 goals lead Stanford. David Imber
nino has scored 43 times this season.
