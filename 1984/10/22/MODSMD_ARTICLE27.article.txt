The Stanford men's soccer team won its second straight
Pacific Soccer Conference game Saturday, beating the
University of the Pacific, 3-2, in Stockton.
The victory raised the Cardinal's PSC record to 3-1 and
8-5-4 overall, while UOP fell to 0-4 in conference play
and 2-11 for the season.
The Cardinal is second in the PSC behind three unde
feated teams: the University of California at Berkeley, the
University of San Francisco and Fresno State. Stanford
lost to Fresno State earlier this season and faces Cal and
USF in upcoming games.
The Cardinal was led by Giancarlo Ferruzzi, who had a
goal and an assist in the victory. Ferruzzi leads the team in

scoring and is fifth in the PSC with 19 points on five goals
and nine assists. Fullback Tom Rafalovich scored his fifth
goal of the season in the first half, and junior ful
lback/midfielder Chris Carlsmith added a goal in the
second half with an assist from Patrick Sheehy to provide
the winning goal.
The Tigers' two goals increased senior goalkeeper Willy
Burkhardt's goals-against average to 1.5. Burkhardt has
four shutouts this season, giving him a school-record 23
for his career.
Perhaps Stanford's most crucial game of the season will
come Tuesday, when the Cardinal meets USF at 3:30 p.m.
A victory by Stanford would drop USF into a second
place tie with the Cardinal and set the Cardinal up for a
potential run at first place.
