# Women's golf finishes fourth

### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
Led by junior Kathy Kostas' "best performance at
Stanford," the Cardinal women's golf team finished
tourth this weekend in the 54-hole Nancy Lopez Invita
tional at the par-71, 6,038-yard Cedar Ridge Country
Club in Tulsa, Okla.
Stanford, in its first competition of the fall season,
finished with a total of 941, 17 strokes behind first-place
Arizona State University. The Sun Devils beat the Uni
versity of Tulsa by a stroke, 924 to 925, and the Univer
sity of Florida by four shots.
Stanford had to contend not only with a fine field of
players but also with cold conditions in Tulsa.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal was led by Kostas' three-day
performance. Kostas ended with the final day's lowest
round, a 73. Her one-under-par 34 on the back nine lifted
her into a tie for the individual all-around crown with
Tulsa's Melissa McNamara. Both needed 225 shots.
"It's Kathy's best performance at Stanford," Cardinal
Coach Tim Baldwin said. "With the difficult course and
weather conditions, and the strong field, it's a credit to
Kathy to finish first."
Stanford sophomore Kathy McCarthy's 228 was good
enough for a sixth-place tie. Kay Cornelius' 245, Julie
Carmichael's 249 and Kerry Dubinsky's 252 comprised
the rest of the Cardinal's scoring.
Stanford's fourth-place result left Baldwin optimistic.
"I strongly feel that after the first of the year, when our
lineup is solidified, that we will be competitive with those
top teams," Baldwin said. Those "top teams," Arizona
State University, Tulsa and Florida, are often considered
contenders for national honors.
"I'm proud of the girls for their great effort," Baldwin
said.
