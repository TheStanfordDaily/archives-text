1 he Stanford men s golf team did more than win a golf
tournament this weekend.
Besides gaining valuable national exposure with its vic
tory, the Cardinal sent a signal to the collegiate golfing
community: Stanford is a team to be reckoned with.
Playing on its home course in the Stanford Fall All-
Intercollegiate Tournament Friday and Saturday, the Car
dinal defeated its closest challenger, the University of
Texas-El Paso, by six strokes. Early favorite UCLA
finished third, 21 shots behind Stanford.
Defending champion USC was fourth, 23 shots behind.
First-day leader New Mexico State University faltered
during the final 27 holes and finished seventh. Brigham
Young University ended in fifth place.
For the Cardinal men, it was a satisfying victory. They
had not won a tournament in the fall seaion. The Cardinal
had second-place finishes at the Wolfpack Invitational
and the Americana Classic and a fifth-place performance
at the Louisiana State Invitational.
"We had a chance of winning every one (tournament),
but we didn't," an elated Coach Tim Schaaf said Saturday

night. "We've played fairly well this year hut just couldn't
put it all together. ... We had a little bit to prove out
there."
The Cardinal appeared to do that. The tournament
featured a field that Schaaf called "one of the two best in
the fall season. All the good schools west of Oklahoma
with the exception of Arizona State University" were on
hand this weekend. Perhaps the best indicator of the com
petition's quality was that eight of the 18 participating
teams qualified for last year's National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament.
"It was a very significant win," Schaaf said. "It's great
to win at home. This should get us some of the recognition
we feel we deserve."
The Cardinal was paced by fifth-year senior Tim Rob
inson, whose 54-hole total of 216 was sixth best individu
ally. UTEP's Rick Todd won the individual championship
with a four-under-par 209.
Doug Thompson (217), Scott Erickson (219), John
Dickey (219), Don Walsworth (220) and Carl Wagner
(223) rounded out the rest of Stanford's scoring.
