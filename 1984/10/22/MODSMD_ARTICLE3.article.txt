# Candidates clash
## But experts see no clear winner in second debate 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer With wire reports 
Last night's second and final
debate between President Reagan
and Democratic challenger Walter
Mondale showed clearly the

presidential candidates' opposing
views on a number of foreign policy
issues.
But experts here seemed to agree
that neither Reagan nor Mondale ran
away with a victory.
The two candidates traded cutting
remarks on each other's national se
curity stances, with Reagan remain
ing adamant in defense of his Central
America policy and comments he has
made on the Soviet Union and nu
clear war.
Reagan accused Mondale of being
weak on national defense, citing his
opposition to the M-l tank, the B-l
bomber and the F-14 fighter. He said
Mondale wants to bring home half of
America's forces currently stationed
in Europe.
Asked about his sharp language
regarding the Soviet Union — such as
calling it an "evil empire" —
Reagan said, "I retract nothing that I
have said."
Mondale said he favored increased
defense spending, but asserted that
Reagan's method of improving
defense was to "throw money at the
Defense Department."

He added that "the President's fail
ure to master the essential elements
of arms control has cost us dearly."
Mondale accused Reagan of failing
to pursue diplomatic opportunities to
bring peace to Central America. He
called a recently disclosed CIA
manual advocating terrorism in
Nicaragua an "embarrassment."
"The President is called the com
mander in chief and he is called that
because he is supposed to be in
charge of the facts and run our gov
ernment and strengthen our nation,"
Mondale said.
Reagan retorted that he had
vigorously pursued diplomatic efforts
in Central America. The manual,
which Reagan said violated his order
against CIA terrorism, is being inves
tigated, Reagan said. "Whoever is
guilty. . . . They will be removed."
Scholars at Stanford had only
slightly varied opinions about the
debate.
Joseph Dwyer, a Slavic bibliog
rapher and fellow at the Hoover In
stitute, said, "Mondale did very well
. . . but I think it was very even all the
way. It was a total toss-up."
Political Science Prof. Jan Triska
also said the debate was a "toss-up,"
but "with the slight edge going to
Mondale." Triska said Mondale was
"too close" to the President on issues
such as Nicaragua and space weap
ons.
"I don't know if I would call
Mondale a winner," Triska said.

"Mondale failed to deliver a knock
out."
History Prof. Alexander Dallin
said, "In my own judgment. Mondale
did the better job. But I don't think
either had all the answers."
The history professor said the

former vice president had "an edge in
the arguments . . . but toward the end
both sort of fell apart."
Dallin said both of the closing
statements were "poor."
Tod Bergstrom, a fifth-year senior
who flew to Kansas City for the day
to see the debate in person, said,
"People were a little baffled at what
Reagan was trying to get at" during
the closing statement.
Bergstrom is a resident assistant at
Branner Hall, where he conducts an
undergraduate seminar, "The
Making of the President, 1960-
1984."
