# Card field hockey loses
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
Although the Stanford varsity field
hockey team lost Friday in the Cal In
vitational to San Jose State Univer
sity, 3-1, the Cardinal has a chance
for revenge and more in its final
home game.
The 15th-ranked Cardinal will play
host to the Spartans and will have a
chance to improve its ranking. If
Stanford beats San Jose State, which
is ranked 11th in the nation, it could
have a better chance at being one of
the 12 teams to receive a bid to the

National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion playoffs scheduled to begin Nov.
9.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
defeated the University of the Pacific,
3-0.
Stanford, which has lost to San Jose
State twice this season, scored first
Friday but was ineffective offensively
the rest of the game.
"The offense sputtered. It wasn't a
sustained attack," Cardinal Coach
Onnie Killefer said. "We weren't able
to keep it (the ball) down near their
goal primarily because they have such

big hitters."
Senior All American Patsy Hunt
ington scored in the first two minutes
of the game. Killefer said Huntington
was covered "tightly all game long
wherever she went."
Huntington scored two goals and
Andi Wolpert had two assists. Jen
Bleakley, who had suffered a back in
jury, practiced last week and played
this weekend. Killefer said Bleakley's
injury appears to be a ligament strain.
Killefer said, "Her passing and
playmaking helped us."
