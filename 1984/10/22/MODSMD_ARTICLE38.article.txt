# Volunteer network helps students help
## 
### VALERIE CRITES 
A volunteer program designed to
work with the Bay Area's elderly, dis
abled, youth and economically disad
vantaged has recently been estab
lished here.
The Stanford Volunteer Network,
modeled after similiar programs at
Vale and Harvard, keeps lists of 200
local volunteer opportunities so that
it can place students in organizations
where their skills may be utilized.
The network also coordinates the
activities of student organizations
already involved in community ser
vice and encourages dorms, student
clubs, fraternities and sororities to
"adopt an agency" and sponsor
volunteer projects on their own.
"Our goal is to get every Stanford
student involved in public service or
volunteer activity at least once," ex
plained Peter Spivack, director of the
network.
Spivack, last year's winner of the
University's J.E. Wallace Sterling
award for public service, is enthusias
tic about the long-range effects of the
volunteer program.
"The purpose of the network is to
introduce students to alternative
careers — something besides invest
ment banking and financial manage
ment — and also to establish patterns
of volunteer service in college stu
dents.
"So many life patterns are set while
you're in college, that if people take a
couple of hours a week and devote
them to volunteer work while in col
lege, they're likely to continue in
some capacity when they graduate.
Later, when they raise a family,
they'll pass those values on to their
children," Spivack said.
The network is the latest in a series
of moves by Stanford to actively en
courage public service among its stu
dents, members of what is commonly
referred to as the "me-generation."
University President Donald Ken
nedy uses every possible opportunity
to drive the public service message
home.
"At a University that only a few

years ago led the nation in the
proportion of students volunteering
for Peace Corps service, we now see
too many of our able students hyp
notized by apprehension over the job
market and settling for an unneces
sarily narrow fulfillment of their
training and their promise," Kennedy
said.
"I believe that students here have a
very real sense of responsibility and a
yearning to serve which we are just
beginning to tap. That opportunity
requires us to challenge students to
expand their view of success beyond
the profit sector and to search out
creative solutions to pressing social
problems.
"The restoration of faith in public
service is important, and I want Stan
ford to be a leader in that process of
restoration," Kennedy said.
Student participation is increasing,
and many of those involved echo
Kennedy's theme of volunteer partic
ipation. "It's a great opportunity to
meet inieresting older members of
the Stanford community," said
Audrey Hemphill, a volunteer with
Friends and Helpers, an organization
that matches students with Stanford
emeriti and other elderly in the area.
"Through volunteering, I can go to
faculty members to give help instead
of requesting it from them. It's a nice
switch," Hemphill added.
Plans for the volunteer network
began in August 1983, with the ap
pointment of Catherine Milton, spe
cial assistant to Kennedy, to conduct
a study of public service activities on
campus. Her report showed that al
though volunteer activities among in
dividual groups on campus were
strong, there was a lack of central di
rection and coordination.
The current volunteer network in
cludes representatives from 17 com
munity service groups, which use
Owen House for meetings and office
space. The network's first large-scale
service project will be "Reach Out
Today," a day of community serivce,
scheduled for Saturday.
