### 
IBM signed a contract last week to participate in Stan
ford's Microdisc plan, joining Apple and Hewlett-Packard
in offering discounted products through the University.
Beginning Dec. 3, the Microdisc order office wi/J be ac
cepting orders from individuals for many of the popular
personal computers, including the PC, the XT and
iÃŸM's newest and most powerful personal computer, the
AT. Other IBM products will be available as well. Dis
counts for all the products will range from 20 to 37 per
cent.
"We've been working on this contract for some time
now and are very pleased that we have finally been able to
sign," said Jan Thomson, associate director of Informa
tion Technology Services. "We know that many people in
the community have been waiting for IBM to come in."
The exact list of products that will be available is not yet

final, but information packets and product and price lists
should be ready within the next several weeks.
AN existing Microdisc policies regarding individual
eligibility and limitations on the number of devices that
may be purchased still apply.
Potential purchasers should note the new policy
whereby peripheral items such as printers, disk drives,
modems and software may be purchased even if an indi
vidual has not previously purchased a microcomputer sys
tem through the Microdisc plan. This means, for example,
that someone already owning an IBM personal computer
system may buy peripherals for it through Microdisc.
Microdisc, sponsored jointly by Information Technol
ogy Services and Academic Computing and Information
Services, is a microcomputer discount plan for Stanford
students, faculty and staff.
