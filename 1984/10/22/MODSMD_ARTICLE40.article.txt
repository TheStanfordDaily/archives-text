"All right then, congressman, who
is your favorite Democratic co
worker from Colorado with the ini
tials T.W.?"
I call it a tee-tee
Why does Shirish never seem to be

here on Sunday, even though he's the
only one of us who has no homework
due the following day?
Why does Tim always have to ask
how, no matter how many times he's
been there?
Why does Senator Highfill sleep
through Eddie Murphy? Where does
Steve disappear to for three hours
every time we go over there? And

what did Doris really think of the
whole sordid affair?
Good luck, Sandra, making wo
men's night half as cool.
Wendy, is the water warm yet?
Hey — party! I want you all to know,
we really need you. You know, night
staffing is like so cool, and we need
fresh blood here.

Mrs. Kierkegaard
Every once in a while a freshman
walks into our offices and simply
baffles us with brilliance. But more
often, it's freshmen like Debbie
Rubenstein who show up. Freshmen
with big, eager eyes and a much-too
large vocabulary. Stick around. Red.
Now that you've met Mark Beyreis, it
can only be uphill.
