United Autoworkers strike Mack
ALLENTOWN, Pa. — Picket lines went up yesterday at four Mack
Truck Co. plants in Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey as about
9,200 members of the United Auto Workers union went on strike
against the nation's No. 2 heavy-duty truck manufacturer.
Negotiations that began Aug. 13 failed to produce a master contract
to replace the two-year agreement that expired at midnight, and no new
talks were scheduled.
UAW Vice President Bill Casstevens, director of the union's Mack
Truck department, said after talks broke off that the company and the
union "remain far apart on several key issues, most notably job security
and economics."
The affected plants are in Hagerstown, Md., Bridgewater, N.J.,
Macungie, Pa., and Allentown, where Mack has its headquarters.
"Our truck production is closed down in the United States," said
William McCullough, Mack vice president for corporate affairs. A Mack
plant in Ontario, Canada, was not included in the strike, but might be af
fected because all the plants coordinate production, he said.
McCullough said the strike was the first authorized union walkout
against Mack since 1964. Picketing was orderly yesterday and company
managers were able to enter the plants freely, he said.
"It's all very new to everybody," he said. "The major portion of these
people, I imagine, have never been on a picket line before."
Casstevens said in a statement that the UAW had "no other choice
but to strike" because "management has been unwilling to respond
seriously to our basic concerns on job security."
French director Truffaut dies at 52
PARIS — Francois Truffaut, a film critic who turned director and
became not only a major influence in French cinema's so-called "new
wave" but also an inspiration for imaginative young American
moviemakers, died yesterday in his native Paris at the age of 52.
Truffaut, many of whose films such as "The 400 Blows," "Day for
Night" and "Jules and Jim" have become classics, had been in a coma
for several days at the American Hospital of Paris, where doctors
declined to reveal the cause of his death. French television reports said,
however, he died of cancer.
While Truffaut's achievements as a director commanded countless
cinematic awards and honors, ironically, he is perhaps best-remembered
by American moviegoers as an actor in a single U.S.-made film. He
portrayed a French scientist who arranges a meeting between humans
and extra-terrestrial beings in Stephen Spielberg's 1977 film "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind."
Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas are among the
American filmmakers who have credited Truffaut with being a pivotal
influence on their own works. Truffaut himself claimed to have looked
to France's fabled Jean Renoir and Englishman-turned-American
Alfred Hitchcock as his principal inspirations.
Critics considered him the master of the "film d' auteur" — the highly
personalized motion picture written and directed by the same individual.
Shultz calls new stand untenable
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz said yesterday
that the Soviet Union may be changing its position on arms control talks
on deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe, but the new
position probably would be unacceptable.
And Shultz, interviewed on NBC's "Meet the Press," also said that
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger "very well may" have recom
mended against keeping U.S. peacekeeping troops in Lebanon in the
weeks before a truck-bombing demolished a Marine headquarters build
ing in Beirut on Oct. 23, 1983 and killed 241 servicemen.
A Soviet official was quoted Friday as suggesting that Moscow might
no longer insist that the United States withdraw all of the new cruise and
Pershing 2 missiles it has deployed in Britain, Italy and West Germany
since December as a condition for resuming negotiations aimed at limit
ing such missiles.
In the past, Moscow usually insisted that the United States would have
to dismantle all of the missiles before it would agree to resume negotia
tions.
Shultz said the official may have been suggesting "a little diffferent
stance," and that a moratorium on deployment of the American missiles
may be sufficient to get arms talks under way again.
But, he added, "to think in terms of a moratorium of some sort at the
present, very unequal level would not be to our advantage."
"To suggest it would be to their advantage," he said. "But to accept it
would not be to ours."
Contacts say Sakharovs back home
MOSCOW — Friends of dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov have re
ported receiving several telegrams and postcards from him and his wife
that indicate that the couple are now living in their apartment in Gorki.
Pieces of information in these constrained communications appear to
indicate that the exiled human rights activist had left a hospital in Gorki
some time ago and had rejoined his wife, Yelena Bonner, in the apart
ment.
Sources said that Sakharov had sent one or two telegrams to his
children from his first marriage, while all other communications were
signed by Bonner. A recent postcard, dated Oct. 10, implied that their
lives were troubled by using a Russian phrase connoting disturbances
under a calm surface.
Talks break off on restaurant strike
SAN FRANCISCO — Contract talks between striking restaurant
workers and management broke off last night and union leaders said
they would recommend a "no" vote on the latest proposal from the
Golden Gate Restaurant Association.
Charles Lamb of Local 2 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and
Bartenders Union announced that despite efforts by federal mediator
Sam Kagel, talks with the restaurant owners had ceased and the gap be
tween the two groups had widened.
"Their current proposal is a step backward of their proposal of Oct.
10," said Lamb at a news conference at the Clift Hotel.
Nonetheless, Lamb said the union will put the new proposal to a vote
tomorrow.
However, the union will recommend a no vote on the contract because
"this proposal will turn wages and working conditions in San Francisco
restaurants from among the best in the country to among the worst in the
country," Lamb said.
The strike started Sept. 1 as a limited walkout. It has spread to 18 of
the GGRA's 55 restaurants, plus 10 of 17 restaurants represented by
Mark Montobbio, with whom the union is reportedly negotiating sepa
rately.
Former Black Panther arrested
BERKELEY — Former Black Panther Party leader Eldridge Cleaver
and a woman have been arrested following their refusal to obey a court
order barring them from coming within 500 yards of a disputed house.
Cleaver, onetime Marxist and minister of information of the 1960s
militant black group, and Karen Koelker were booked Saturday for in
vestigation of a misdemeanor.
"You're a bunch of commies!" cried the house's owner, 76-year-old
Clare Morrison, to Berkeley police as they led Cleaver and Koelker
away from the house. Mrs. Morrison was in a wheelchair. She was not
arrested.
Morrison has been fighting for almost a year to regain control of her
house, which had been rented out by a conservator during the period she
spent in a convalescent hospital after the deaths of her husband and her
son.
The issue has been marking time mainly because Morrison has
declined to take legal action as a landlord over fears that the $225
monthly rent arranged by the conservator for her two-bedroom house
would become legally binding under Berkeley rent control, seriously
depreciating the house's value.
Today's weather
Today will be sunny with highs in the mid 60s to mid 70s.
