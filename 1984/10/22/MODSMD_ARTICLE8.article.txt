Democratic presidential nominee Walter
Mondale suggested last night thai President
Reagan is not sufficiently informed to lead the na
tion in shaping defense and foreign policy, setting
off some of the bluntest face-to-face exchanges
since the first presidential debates 24 years ago.
In their debate in Kansas City, Mo., Mondale
and Reagan took sharp issue with each other on the
roles of the CIA in Nicaragua and of the United
States in Lebanon, as well as on nuclear arms con-"
trol and weapons procurement.
At one point, Reagan accused Mondale of using
the forum, being watched by as many as 80 million
people, to "repeat falsehoods" concerning some of
the president's most controversial statements on
nuclear weapons. But Mondale refused to back
down from an assertion that Reagan had believed
submarine-launched nuclear missiles could be
recalled, saying he would issue a statement Monday
to prove the accuracy of his charge.
The exchanges came in the second debate be
tween the contenders and signaled the final drive
toward the Nov. 6 election.
As the candidates squared off in the Kansas City
Municipal Auditorium, polls showed Mondale sub
stantially behind Reagan in voter preference. But
the Democratic nominee hoped that the clash over
foreign and defense policy would give him an even
bigger boost than their first encounter, when voters
concluded that the former vice president had
clearly taken the measure of the president in their
debate over domestic affairs.
Mondale sought from the first question last night
to sharply focus the debate on the perception of
leadership, suggesting the world has become more
dangerous in the Reagan administration because
the president lacks knowledge about nuclear arms
and arms control.
"The bottom line of national strength is that the
president must be in command," Mondale
declared. "He must lead. And when a president. . .
says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are con
ventional, discovers three years into his administra
tion that our arms control efforts have failed

because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles
are on land — these are things that a president
must know to command."
Reagan, visibly angered by Mondale's assertion
— which the challenger has frequently used in
recent days — denied he had ever said or conceived
that missiles fired from submarines could be
recalled, labeling the assertion "entirely false."
Instead, the president said his statement had
been that submarines and airplanes are less des
tabilizing than land-based missiles because "you
could call them back before they had launched
their missiles."
"But 1 hope from here on, you will no longer be
saying that particular thing, which is absolutely
false," Reagan admonished the Democratic
nominee.
But Mondale returned to the remark moments
later, and the president countered with a charge
that Mondale, going back to his record as a senator
from Minnesota, "has a record of weakness with
regard to our national defense that is second to
none."
Accusing Reagan of opposing every nuclear arms
control agreement that has been suggested during
his administration, Mondale asserted that the So
viet Union now has "2,000 more warheads pointed
at us today than when he was sworn in," adding,
"The president's failure to master the essentials of
arms control has cost us dearly."
Mondale moved early to put the president on the
defensive, as he succeeded in doing in their Oct. 7
debate in Louisville, Ky.
After the president leveled his accusation that
Mondale has been weak on defense, reciting a list
of weapons projects that Mondale has opposed
over the years, the challenger turned directly
toward Reagan to address him.
"Mr. President," he declared, "I accept your
commitment to peace, and I want you to accept my
commitment to a strong national defense." He
accused the president of believing that the route to
a strong defense "is to throw money at the Defense
Department."

The Kansas City encounter had been gaining im
portance since the Oct. 7 debate in Louisville, Ky.
In that confrontation, Mondale emerged as a
clear winner in the perception of viewers across the
nation, and the president's closest advisers and po
litical allies acknowledged that the master ten
sion campaigner had faltered.
Although Mondale's strong showing gave his
campaign more excitement than it had seen since
the Democratic National Convention in July, it was
debatable how much it had actually improved his
prospects for the election Nov. 6.
Some polls showed Mondale gaining support
after the Louisville debate, but others — including
a Los Angeles Times Poll last week — showed that
he still had not significantly narrowed the margin
by which he trailed Reagan.
Leading up to their meeting last night, Reagan
and Mondale had both gone out of their way to set
the stage for the showdown on foreign policy and
defense issues. Mondale's advisers said they were
confident that their candidate would be in better
command of the issues, while White House aides
were equally convinced that the president would
not be subpar in two successive debates.
Mondale sharpened longstanding disagreements
Friday by demanding that CIA Director William
Casey, a close friend of Reagan, be replaced be
cause of the ClA's production of a manual that ap
parently instructs rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist
government on how to commit political assassina
tions.
The potential for angry differences in the debate
was further increased in recent days with criticism
of the Reagan administration by Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko.
As he departed for Kansas City yesterday,
Mondale predicted that the debate would end with
voters seeing clear differences between himself and
the president, telling reporters, "He (Reagan)
hasn't mastered the facts."
