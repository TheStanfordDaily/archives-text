# Investigation under way into who approved CIA manual
## McFarlane: President will act 'firmly' 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan will fire any CIA official who
approved the text of a handbook
advising Nicaraguan rebels to use as
sassination, National Security Ad
viser Robert McFarlane said yester
day.
McFarlane said he did not know
whether CIA chief William Casey
was involved. But he said initial
evidence suggested that the guerrilla
handbook was produced by a low
ranking CIA operative, and may not
have been approved by anyone at the
intelligence agency.
"I think the president has mad*
clear that if there were U.S. officials

involved in the development of this
and approval of it, then they ought to
be fired," he said in an appearance on
ABC's "This Week With David
Brinkley."
The 90-page book, which was
supplied to the CIA-directed rebels
last year, recommends assassination
of local government officials as a tool
of guerrilla warfare. It has prompted
Democrats, including presidential
nominee Walter Mondale, former
President Carter and House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.)
to demand Casey's ouster.
McFarlane said that he expects
Reagan to deal with the matter

"unequivocally, firmly (and)
promptly" once a CIA investigation
is completed, probably "within a
week or so."
Asked whether Casey had ap
proved the handbook's production,
McFarlane said, "I have no basis for
knowing."
"All of the evidence preliminarily
is that this was a subordinate official
and perhaps not even someone who
was employed by the CIA. But the
point is whoever was involved ought
to be fired," he said.
White House officials have said
that firing Casey is not under consid

eration.
Rebel officials have said that the
manual was provided to them by an
American who called himself John
Fitzgerald. The Washington Post re
ported Saturday that "Fitzgerald"
was actually John Kirkpatrick, a Viet
nam veteran who was apparently a
CIA contract employee.
Reagan has ordered the CIA to in
vestigate the matter to see if there
was improper conduct, by any of its
officers. Democrats in Congress have
asked the Department of Justice to
see if a special prosecutor should be
appointed.
