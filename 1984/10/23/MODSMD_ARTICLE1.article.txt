# IFC asks for Zete apologies

### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
In the wake of a conflict involving two members of the
Zeta Psi fraternity and residents of the Kappa Alpha
house, the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Judicial Com
mittee has asked that the two Zetes apologize for refusing
to leave the KA house upon request.
The two students were attending a Saturday night party
at the fraternity on Oct. 13 when they began "acting bel
ligerently" and "making nasty remarks" to house mem
bers, according to KA resident assistant Neil Shapiro.
When the students refused to leave the party after requests
from Shapiro and KA president Bret Sherman, the KAs
called the police.
The IFC committee, composed of a representative from
each of Stanford's 19 recognized fraternities, met last
Thursday to consider what, if any, disciplinary action
should be taken. Committee members recommended that
the two Zetes issue a formal apology to the KAs.
IFC president Rick Hoskins, a member of the Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity, plans to send a letter to this ef
fect to Zete president Sam Aronson.
Aronson said he would not comment on the episode un
til he sees a draft of Hoskin's letter, which he expects to
receive today.
According to Diana Conklin, director of the Row, the
IFC is given full responsibility for settling incidents of this
type.
"At this point, it is in the hands of the IFC," she said.
Conklin said she does not foresee any University action in
the matter.
The incident could affect whether the Zetes are permit
ted to return to campus as a housed fraternity. Their peti
tion for housing is due Jan. 1, 1985.
The Zetes lost University recognition and housing in the
fall of 1981 after a series of events culminating in an
episode in which several Zetes threw a Mills College wo
man into a shallow cement pond in the fraternity's court
yard. The University officially restored recognition to the
Zetes last winter.
Both Conklin and Aronson said it is impossible to assess
how this episode will affect the fraternity's bid for housing.
Conklin said if housing is granted, the Zetes could be back
in their former 353 Campus Drive residence by next Sep
tember.
The Oct. 13 incident began shortly before 2 a.m. when
Sherman asked the two Zetes to leave the house. He said
the party had ended and the KAs were clearing out the
house. Shapiro repeated the request, but the two refused
