PALMDALE — President
Reagan, in high spirits after his
debate with Democratic nominee
Walter Mondale, yesterday opened
the final two weeks of his campaign
by sharply attacking Mondale's
defense record.
Speaking at the Rockwell Interna
tional assembly plant where the B-l
bomber is built, Reagan said, "If it
were up to my opponent, I'm afraid
Rockwell might still be building the
B-25 — that is, if you were building
anything at all." The B-25 is a World
War 11-vintage bomber.
"The truth is, if all his votes had
prevailed (in the Senate), America
would barely have any defense, any
real means to protect the peace, any
chance to preserve freedom — and
we can't afford that kind of protec
tion," he said.

Reagan still was dogged by ques
tions yesterday about his 1982 news
conference statement suggesting that
he believed that submarine-launched
nuclear missiles could be recalled.
Mondale criticized Reagan in the
debate for the remark, and Reagan
tried again yesterday to explain it.
But these questions did not
dampen the buoyant mood in the
Reagan entourage after the debate.
Reagan political adviser Lyn Nofziger
said Mondale had lost his "last shot"
at defeating Reagan. White House
Chief of Staff James Baker 111 said
Mondale "didn't do anything to make
up the gap in polls he's going to need
to make up."
Reflecting the campaign's upbeat
mood, Nancy Reagan cheerily told
reporters in a rare conversation on
Air Force One that questions about

the president's age and competence
are "a non-issue. It's not true and
he's shown it's not true."
Picking up where he left off in the
debate, Reagan said Mondale "voted
to delay or kill virtually every new
strateic system: the B-l bomber, the
Trident submarine and the Trident
missile, the cruise missile, our ABM
system and the modernization of our
ICBM force."
Mondale's record on conventional
forces is "just as frightening,"
Reagan told several thousand aero
space workers, saying that the Demo
crat has expressed "hostility to a
strong, secure America"and that his
election would "send a signal of
decline, lessened will and weakness
to friends and adversaries alike."
"It's always easy to argue for
reductions in defense spending, just

as it's easy to pretend that one can
call the Soviet leaders, as my op
ponent has proposed, and persuade
them in a moment to alter the course
they have followed for decades,"
Reagan said.
"It's also nonsense and the Ameri
can people know it,"he added.
Reagan restored the B-l bomber
program canceled by President
Carter. The Pentagon is buying 100
bombers, designed for treetop-level
penetration of enemy air defenses, at
an estimated cost of $28.3 billion.
Critics say advances in defensive
measures will make the plane ob
solete before the 100 are delivered in
April 1988. Mondale says he sup
ports development of the Stealth
bomber instead of the B-18.
