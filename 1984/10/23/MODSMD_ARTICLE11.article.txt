## Test prep centers: worth it or a waste? 
### INDRA SEHDEV 
This year millions of college students will sit in nervous
agitation for some four to eight hours, poise their No. 2
pencils and submit to having their academic potentials as
sessed.
These students will be taking the Law School Admis
sion Test (LSAT), the Medical College Admission Test
(MCAT) or the Graduate Management Admissions Test
(GMAT) — standardized exams designed to measure
skills and knowledge gained over a period of years.
Although these prospective attorneys, doctors and
businessmen will be demonstrating to graduate schools
their career aptitudes in law, medicine and business, they
will also demonstrate how much they practiced for the
test.
Not surprising, then, are the number of test preparation
courses clamoring for student dollars. These courses give
reviews of subject matter, analysis of test formats and
explanation of question types. They say they can help stu
dents improve their scores.
For Stanford students there is a variety of test prepara
tion courses available. Pre-law and pre-business students
interested in a one-man, hometown type operation might
be interested in "The Palo Alto LSAT Program." Peter
Stern, a practicing Palo Alto lawyer, former Stanford fac
ulty member and graduate of Stanford Law School, has
been teaching this course since 1978.
He was in law school at the time he thought of starting a
test preparation program. He said he thought it would be
"a good way of keeping my hand in teaching." He
teaches his course four or five times a year.
Stanford students may have noticed the hand-colored,
mimeographed flyers advertising Stern's course on bulle
tin boards around campus. After waging his advertising
campaign and encouraging an average enrollment of 15,
Stern begins teaching. For $300 students attend eight to
10 class sessions which begin six weeks to two months
before the exam. The weekday classes are three-and-one
half-hours long; weekend classes last four hours.
Studying for the exam is "a process of incremental
learning, like building an onion from the inside out," ac
cording to Stern. He helps students build their onions by
starting with the "trickiest sections of the exam." For in
stance, students studying for the LSAT would start with
the logical reasoning section — mastery of which, said
Stern, is key to doing the rest of the test.
"A formal test preparation course is not by any means
necessary for all people," Stern said. "However, by giving
people a lot of practice, I can help them routinize their
strategies . . . mobilize their potentials," he added. "The
course provides a framework of external discipline,
namely me."
Mark Walker, a second-year Stanford law student,
learned about Stern's course through the flyers Stern had
posted around campus. Walker said he decided to take the
course "because it was cheaper than other local courses."
Walker said he soon saw other advantages to taking
Stern's course: "small classes and individual attention"
among them.
Another LSAT review course available to Stanford stu
dents is the "Juris Doctor LSAT Course." The founder of
this course is currently teaching at another test prepara
tion center and asked that his name be withheld. The
course, which started Oct. 14, is being taught temporarily

in the forum rooms of Meyer Library.
A 1984 Duke Law School graduate teaches the "J.D."
program. In fact, he is considering teaching the prepara
tion course as an alternative to practicing law. "I enjoy
working with people rather than being in an adversary po
sition," he said.
Although the Juris Doctor Program has just begun, the
Juris Doctor has been tutoring students individually for
the LSAT for five years. He said that his tutoring experi
ence has helped him develop "a comprehensive method
for helping in the mastery of the LSAT."
Although his course does not culminate in a full-length
practice LSAT, as Stern's does, the J.D. said working "in
three- to four-hour classes does an adequate job of help
ing [students] adapt to concentrating for a test-situation
length of time."
Comparing his method to the Stanley Kaplan method,
the J.D. said, "Kaplan teaches by example, which is good,
but the weakness of Kaplan is that it doesn't teach enough
approach theory." In reading comprehension, for exam
ple, the J.D. said he leads students, step-by-step, through
an analysis of a passage. He finishes by giving them an
"ideal analysis" of the passage, "rather than just throwing
more example passages at the students."

"I want my students to learn my method, but in the final
analysis I want them to internalize my method and adapt
it to their own needs."
Like Stern, the J.D. cites individualized attention as the
biggest attribute of his course. The J.D.'s advertisement
says,"The other guy gives you all the time you want with
a machine. We give you all the time you want with a Juris
Doctor."
Currently the J.D. has three students receiving individ
ual tutoring. Michelle Margolis, one of them, said the
J.D.'s course has done her "a lot of good so far." The J.D.
knows "what strengths one needs to develop for the test.
He takes the guesswork out of preparation and knows
what weaknesses to get rid of," she said.
Margolis took the Stanley Kaplan course before taking
the J.D.'s course. She said that the Kaplan approach
"addressed repetition, which was helpful. At a certain
point, though, repetition wasn't doing me any more
good."
A third preparation course is the "LSAT Preparation
Program" offered by the Fairfax Lecturn at Berkeley. The
Fairfax Lecturn is a publishing company, begun in 1981,
that supplies LSAT study materials to over 40 schools
across the country and publishes an LSAT update to be

sent to pre-law advisers across the state. Dave Scalise,
founder of the company, is the primary writer and senior
editor of the materials and teaches the preparation course.
Scalise is also an associate professor of law and business at
the University of San Francisco.
Scalise said he updates study materials at least once a
year or after each exam, as necessary. His course, though
32 hours long like the J.D.'s and Stern's, meets for two
sessions only. Students attend class on two consecutive
Saturdays and have a week in between to study take home
materials which provide "25 hours of additional prepara
tion." Saturday classes are intensive, lasting from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. "with no wasting time." In class, Scalise provides
an in-depth analysis of each exam section, practice exer
cises, critiques of students' essays and a "full-length
verisimilar exam given under exam conditions."
Scalise said that his course "teaches students to recog
nize the format, directions, timing and insides of the
exam." He added that his course is "only $95, about one
fourth the price of Stanley Kaplan." Scalise's course, ac
cording to one of the students in his last class, is "fast
paced, but not overwhelming."
Stanford students shopping around for test preparation
courses have another course to look at. The "University
of San Diego Test Preparation Courses" is an organiza
tion now offering preparatory courses for the LSAT,
GMAT, and GRE (Graduate Record Exam). Sue Sul
livan, director of test preparation at USD said that the
university will start its MCAT course early next year.
USD offers courses at seven locations: Berkeley, San
Francisco, Santa Clara, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Whit
tier and San Diego. The cost of a 32-hour course is $295;
a 40-hour course is $375.
The 32-hour course runs for two consecutive weekends,
eight hours each day. The 40-hour course runs for six
weeks, with two meetings of about three-and-a-half-hours
per week.
The teachers for the USD courses are "people who
have taken the test and scored in the 90th percentile or
above," Sullivan said. "Most of those teaching for the
GMAT are business students and most teaching for the
LSAT are second- or third-year law students."
Class is a "live lecture situation, reinforced by take
home materials which the teachers grade," she said.
Sullivan, like Stern and the J.D., cites "individual atten
tion provided" as one of the advantages of the USD
courses. "Our classes are smaller, and we help [students]
applying to law schools or business schools," she said.
There is "more of a counseling aspect to our course than
others," she added.
Sullivan said that scores of students taking the USD
programs range "three to four points higher than the na
tional average on the LSAT and 60 to 100 points higher
on the GMAT."
National Review Courses, based in Marin County, is
another organization offering test preparation. The or
ganization, which has offices in about 50 locations across
the country, offers classroom review courses for the
LSAT, GMAT, GRE and MCAT. Students preparing for
the LSAT, GMAT or GRE register for a 32-hour course
and pay $185. Those preparing for the MCAT register for
a 40-hour course that costs $250. According to Don

Kamin, president of National Review Courses, "class
length is arranged according to test length to help students
learn to concentrate for longer periods of time." For ex
ample, students preparing for the MCAT attend five
eight-hour sessions because the MCAT is eight hours.
When they go to class, students will not have one
teacher, as in the courses mentioned previously, but a
team of teachers. Kamin believes that it is important to
have people "who know their subject and who know how
to teach" present the various courses. "In fact," Kamin
said, "faculty members from Berkeley and UCSD started
National Review Courses 12 years ago. They thought that
it was important to have faculty members, specialists in
each area of an exam, rather than grad students, teach for
different sections of the exams."
Kamin said he believes the philosophy of a review
course should be "to cover the concepts, pinpoint students'
weaknesses and prepare students. We can't teach students
what they've never learned. We fine tune them."
"Students get nervous and want to know everything," he
added. "They always want more take-home materials, for
instance. We teach them what they need to know. These
exams are limited in scope. We teach students efficiently."
Kamin said that in other courses, their tape and materi
als are their strength while "the teaching is not that
good."
"Those types of courses do a better job for people
who've been out of schoolfor a while. We move rapidly so
that people who have just had the coursework can thrive."
With 128 permanent offices across the country, five in
this area (San Francisco, Palo Alto, Berkeley, Davis and
Marin), Stanley Kaplan is the biggest and probably best
known of any test preparation center in the country.
Kaplan has been operating for 46 years.
The Kaplan courses use a three-pronged approach to
test preparation: live class sessions of four to five hours
each, audio tape sessions and home study. Deborah
Bond-Upson, Kaplan administrator for Northern Califor

nia and Nevada since 1973, suggested that students "try to
enroll as early as possible — 12 to 15 or 16 weeks —
before the exam." The Kaplan philosophy. Bond-Upson
explained, is that "quick cram courses don't work, and long
term coaching is the only type of preparation that makes a
difference."
The cost for a Kaplan course is $350 plus $50 for a
deposit on home study materials. Like National Review
Courses, Kaplan offers scholarships to students who dem
onstrate financial need. Unlike the other courses men
tioned so far, enrollment in a Kaplan course is good "for
any one testing," rather than for a set number of hours.
For example, a pre-med can sign up in January and begin
preparing for the April MCAT.
The Kaplan program is time consuming. "It can turn
out that someone will spend as much time on Kaplan as
they would on one or two regular courses," Bond-Upson
said. However, Kaplan centers are open days, weekends
and evenings year-round. Therefore, students can take the
Kaplan course in summer.
The teachers for the course are "young people who
have gone through the admission process and are in the
schools the students taking the tests want to enter," ac
cording to Bond-Upson. She added, "The teachers must
be smart, capable of giving an articulate presentation and
of making the class enjoyable." In contrast to Kamin of
National Review Course, Bond-Upson said that it is "not
a benefit to have, say, a biology instructor teach for the
MCAT. It is better to have someone close to the basics,
rather than the specifics."
Kaplan teachers do not research course curriculum
themselves. In New York, the Kaplan research staff, com
prising about 60 people, researches it for them. "Small or
ganizations," Bond-Upson said, "are not apt to be thor
ough enough or time efficient enough. Kaplan offers the
depth that some 20-hour course cannot. It goes beyond
skimming the surface."
"The national Kaplan scores are higher than the na
tional median," Bond-Upson said. Also, about 80 percent
of Kaplan students learn about the course through "word
of-mouth recommendations." These two facts, among
others, tell the Kaplan people that they are "doing the
job," Bond-Upson said.
