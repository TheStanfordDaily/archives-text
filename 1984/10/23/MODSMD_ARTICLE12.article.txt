## The
						Stanford Daily Refresh the senate 
### 
Last week, student petitioners said they had
enough signatures to put an amendment to the
ASSU constitution before student voters, and
would turn in their petitions by Thursday.
The petitions — for an amendment which
would limit ASSU senators to three terms —
were never turned in to the elections commis
sioner. There is only one week until the ASSUs
special election, and the only way the amendment
can be placed on the ballot now is through a spe
cial senate vote tonight.
We hope this comes to pass.
The longer a senator serves, the greater the
time span between fresh ideas. After serving a
few terms, uninspired senators exhaust the supply
of ideas they brought to the senate. They begin
debating parliamentary procedure rather than
exploring fresh and innovative legislation.
For instance, the most exciting concepts of this
senate — the shuttle to San Francisco and the ref
erendum on South African investments — came
from senators who have served fewer than three
terms.
By comparison, many of the constitutional
amendments on the ballot — those that will have
little effect on the average student — were writ
ten by senators who have served more than three
terms.

Despite good intentions, the power accum
ulated by elder senators tends to undercut new
ideas and stifle the learning process for other
senators.
First-term Senator Yvonne Campos charac
terizes these senators as "filters you have to work
through" when trying to push a new idea.
In addition, the learning that should take place
in the senate is precluded by the elder senators
who take too much of the work upon themselves.
Tonight, for example, four of the six bills the sen
ate will consider were written by one senator wh<l
has served for well over three terms. This is the
same person other senators consult if they want
to know anything about the ASSU bylaws.
The amount of work this senator does is com
mendable, but, meanwhile, other senators are not
authoring bills, not interpreting the bylaws and
not learning.
The organizers of the petition drive found stu
dents so enthusiastic about the idea that more
than 650 signatures were acquired in only two
days. Students recognized the potential this
amendment has for making the senate more ef
fective and more interesting.
The senate should also recognize that potential
and place the amendment on next week's ballot.
