## Your professor is preparing to sing 
### 
It is 11:36 a.m. and you are sitting
in a class that you have to take for
your major. The two-minute warning
has just gone off inside your head, in
dicating that your attention span is
ready to call it quits. You have had it
with your morning classes, regardless
of how dynamic the professor or how
interesting the lecture.
Let's face it. Can we read? (Joan
Rivers would write that if she had a
column.) You would rather be

VIEWPOINT

socializing at the P.O. boxes, even if
the only letters you ever receive are
from Ed Zschau (as in now) and from
Wells Fargo (as in long lines). You
would even rather be waiting in line
at Stern for your daily dose of Chili
Egg Puff or Beef Firoshki.
To make matters even worse, you
have filled in all the answers that you
know in the Daily crossword puzzle.
But 14 minutes still remain before the
lunch whistle. Now, all of a sudden, as
you are counting the remaining min
utes in the margin of your notebook,
the professor tosses away his pointer
and picks up a conductor's stick. He
then proceeds to lead the class in the
classic rendition of "If you're happy
and you know it, clap your hands."
After this, he picks up his pointer and
beckons one side of the large lecture
hall to stand up quickly, shout
"Wave," and sit down. This is educa
tion at its finest.
It is these spontaneous actions that
keep us interested and make us pay
more actively. They also make learn
ing more enjoyable.
In a Western Culture section, for
instance, it is not that exciting to hear
again that Socrates dcank the poison
hemlock and died. But wouldn't it be
fun to sing "Eency Beency Spider"
and then find out that Plato is also
dead?

It's these creative serendipitous
(that is Dean Fred's word) attention
getters that fill life with these unex
pected pleasures and make it more
exciting. That is why you are reading
this column. You never know what
I'll write next. For all you know, I
could just tell a joke right now. I
could tell you that you will never find
a picture of Charles Manson on the
front of a Corn Flakes box. But I
won't tell you that.
1 don't mean to suggest that the
value of education should not be in
centive enough to learn or even that
lectures are not already creative and
thought-provoking. I am just saying
that we learn and remember things
better when we are entertained. And
also remember that I am writing this
because I'm here to make you laugh.
Now, obviously, some of the sug
gestions I have made so far are com
pletely frivolous. OK, check that, all
of the suggestions I have made so far
are completely frivolous. But after a
morning full of feverishly taking
notes, the student needs a little comic
relief (and I am not talking about
Danny Devito). This way, maybe
some of the notes can go into the
head, and not just onto the note
paper.
And. obviously, if a professor who
is top in his field of study starts sing
ing "If you're happy and you know it,
clap your hands," you are not going
to say to yourself, "What an intellec
tual giant! What a creative genius!"
But you are going to say to yourself
that the professor knows how to
make you listen to the subject he has
spent his life studying.
Okay, you have had your fun. Now
put away your Daily quietly without
all those crumbling noises and pay at
tention to your professor. I think he is
about to sing.
