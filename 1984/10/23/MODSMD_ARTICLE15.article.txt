## NATO's defense of Europe 
### 
The security of Western Europe poses a perplex
ing problem for NATO policy makers. It is a for
midable task to forge a credible deterrent to po
tential Warsaw Pact aggression while maintaining
public support at home, all in an atmosphere in
which political and emotional considerations often
supersede rationality. In view of this, what practical
policy prescriptions should America, as the corner
stone of NATO, advocate?
Centralized control, planning and funding of
Warsaw Pact forces allow the Soviets to indefinitely
maintain a huge standing army in Eastern Europe.
Matching these forces man for man and tank for
tank remains economically and politically un
feasible given NATO's lack of a powerful,
centralized administrative authority. Historically,
Europeans have relied on America's commitment
to launch its nuclear weapons in reply to an all-out
Warsaw Pact invasion of Europe. This appeared to
neutralize the Soviet conventional advantage until
the advent of Soviet strategic nuclear superiority,
which eroded the credibility of the American nu
clear guarantee. Would an American president
"trade" New York for Bonn? Moreover, the
nominal British and French nuclear forces don't
contribute to the security of West Berlin or West
Germany, the first targets of Warsaw Pact armies.
In addition, the Soviet SS-4 and SS-5
intermediate-range missiles deployed in Russia
were not neutralized by the shorter range Pershing
1 missiles. Despite the net asymmetry, no major
NATO modification or extension of its land-based
intermediate-range nuclear systems was being
planned. To deny the Soviets any pretext for im
proving their nuclear forces, America encouraged
the British and French not to modernize their
small, aging nuclear stockpiles.
These facts lead one to wonder why the Soviets
suddenly embarked upon a new round of missile
deployments in the late 19705. Did they foresee
some insidious, suicidal NATO invasion scheme?
Was their nuclear and conventional superiority not
sufficient to counter capitalist plotting? Whatever
the rationale, 350 mobile SS-20s, each equipped
with three accurate warheads, replaced most of the
existing SS-4s and SS-ss, profoundly altering the
European strategic balance.
When NATO replied by planning the deploy
ment of Pershing 2 and ground-launched cruise
missiles (GLCM's), it was held up by the Soviets
and by various "peace groups" as another example
of how America is fueling the arms race. Little at

tention is given to the removal of one Pershing 1
warhead for the installation of one new warhead.
And the additional scrapping of 1,000 aging nu
clear weapons systems in Europe rarely receives
mention.
There is no shortage of excuses for the SS-20
deployment, either. Apologists ruefully point out
that the Soviet Union is surrounded by hostile na
tions. What if Canada and Mexico were pointing
their guns in our direction? Moreover, they argue,
huge losses incurred by the Soviets in the last two
world wars have resulted in a penchant for national
security. But who is to blame for the hostile atti-

achieving a long-term
solution to the European
security problem is to
stay the course.

tude of nations bordering the Soviet Union?
NATO should not be compelled to suffer for the
Soviet expansionist efforts that have made poten
tial Soviet allies into Soviet enemies.
The Kremlin's "nervousness" about national se
curity suffices to explain away almost any con
ceivable Soviet aggression. Surely domination of
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and, to a
lesser extent, Yugoslavia and Rumania was the
result of this "anxiety." Clearly, Polish trade uni
ons and the turmoil in Afghanistan also impinge on
Soviet thirst for national security. And, of course,
Korean Airlines flight 007 was a cleverly disguised
CIA intelligence mission.
When we see beyond excuses for Soviet behav
ior, and when we recognize that the SS-20 deploy
ment was really the Kremlin's way of probing and
weakening NATO's cohesiveness, we can more ra
tionally decide on NATO policy and we can more
accurately assess intermediate-range nuclear force
(INF) arms control efforts.
President Reagan's "zero option" proposal,

which sought to trade our plans for deployment for
their deployed missiles, was the only proposal by
either side that would have resulted in an equitable,
stable configuration of forces. The Soviet's best of
fer, made just prior to installation of the first Persh
ing 2 missile, was to dismantle all but 162 SS-20s in
return for cancellation of Pershing and GLCM
deployments, since the Soviets insisted on counting
the 162 French and British missiles.
First off, the three accurate warheads on an SS
-20 do not make it comparable to the single
warhead, inaccurate and outdated British and
French missiles. Acceptance of this proposal would
have served to legitimize Soviet superiority.
Second, France and Britain would not be likely
to endanger their homelands for the defense of
West Germany.
Third, allowing the Soviets to include French and
British missiles would set a negotiating precedent.
From then on, the Kremlin would insist on being
allowed as many missiles as there are outside the
Soviet Union.
When Reagan rightly balked at this oSser, XYie
Soviets walked out, angrily vowing that no more
INF talks would be possible as long as there were
Pershing 2 missiles in Europe. That was on Nov.
23, 1983, and since then the Soviets have been true
to their word. Clearly, the Soviets came to the
negotiating table not intending to reach an equi
table settlement, but rather to perpetuate their own
advantage.
Now, our only hope of achieving a long-term so
lution to the European security problem is to stay
the course. With missiles in place, we have a signifi
cantly enhanced bargaining position. When the
Kremlin realizes that a vocal minority won't
succeed in undercutting the deployments, and that
the NATO plan won't be unilaterally scrapped, it
will return to the bargaining table.
In the meantime, we should look forward to that
day by improving the conventional defense of
Europe, so that deep reductions in tactical nuclear
weapons won't destabilize the military balance.
This effort should emphasize development and ac
quisition of "smart" conventional weapons, which
guide themselves to their targets. Advances in anti
tank and anti-aircraft technology shift the strategic
advantage from offense to defense. In addition,
they are cheaper, and they lend credibility to
NATO's doctrine of defense as opposed to offense.
