Residential visions
David Lempert's thought
provoking comments (The Daily,
Oct. 17) suggest that the vision of
residential education is not being
realized in most residences. Lempert
believes that preoccupation with
counseling and advising functions
leaves residence staff little time for
intellectual programming.
Like Lempert, I would welcome
more intellectual and educational
programs in the residences. I also
agree that greater institutional re
sources devoted to supporting resi
dent fellows and programming
efforts would help. But I do want to
point out the remarkable strength of
educational programming in the
residences right now. In addition to
the Branner programs which Lem
pert rightly mentions, here are just a
few of the noteworthy efforts that
are under way in the first four weeks
of this quarter:
• Residence-based courses taught by
resident fellows, such as
"Masterpieces of American
Literature," "Introduction to the
Arts," "Truth in Journalism: Fact or
Fiction" and "Chicano Lives";
• 17 Western Culture sections;
• A residence night at "A Soldier's
Play" in which more than 400 stu
dents took part, followed by various
dorm discussions and a dinner with
some of the actors;
• A series of films on American
labor history as well as a number of
discussions on labor led by Guest
Prof. A.H. Raskin;
• Numerous programs following the

presidential and vice-presidential
debates, including faculty-led discus
sions and one featuring a panel of
professional journalists;
• A noon lecture on Chicanos in the
political process;
• A group outing to the San Fran
cisco Opera to see "L'elisir
D'amore";
• Faculty talks on subjects such as
military history, the Middle East and
economics in the 1984 elections;
• A filmmaker showing and discuss
ing her film on fathers and their roles
and relationships within the family;
• A workshop with a professional
dance company;
• The Roble-Lagunita election ex
change program;
• An RF-led trip to the Getty
Museum;
• Presentations on campus educa
tional offerings such as computer
resources and Hopkins Marine Sta
tion.
Lempert is right that we expect a
great deal from resident assistants. It
is the residence staff who have the
best chance to help students see the
connection between what is studied
in the classroom and what happens
in the residences. The most success
ful RAs, and Lempert was one,
know that students respond
positively when intellectual programs
are part of an entire fabric of activi
ties which enhance students' out-of
classroom life. When residential
education works well, the various
aspects of residence life contribute to
each other — community feeling
enhances participation in educational
activities at the same time as shared

intellectual discussion and debate
build residents' knowledge of and
feeling for each other. In other
words, it is in the residences that
students integrate the various aspects
of their lives: intellectual, academic,
social, cultural, recreational, emo
tional and so on. It's a lot to ask, but
well worth the effort.

In his haste to malign opposing
viewpoints, your reporter
in "Adviser indoctrination"
(The Daily, Oct. 17) mangled his
facts. As a former editor of The
Dartmouth Review and a member of
the Dartmouth fraternity system, I
feel obliged to set the record
straight.
Dartmouth College has tradition
ally held a profile of an Indian brave
as its symbol (not mascot, with all
the demeaning aspects that word
entails). This tradition stems from
the original purpose of the college's
founder, the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock,
to educate Indian youth. Unfortun
ately, among the many positive
changes at the college in the 1970s
came the ill-advised suppression of
the Indian symbol. Contrary to your
report. The Dartmouth Review,
along with substantial numbers of
alumni and a majority of the under
graduates, advocates the
reinstatement of the Indian symbol
and not the repressive status quo. In
addition, a recent poll of over 100

Indian tribal leaders and councils
across the United States shows over
whelming support for a dignified
Indian symbol as a tribute to all
Native Americans (The Dartmouth
Review, Vol. 5, No. 2, Oct. 3, 1984)
Finally, Dartmouth is not merely
"revamping" its fraternity system.
Rather, the current college adminis
tration has brought pressure on
fraternities to make physical im
provements to their houses at exor
bitant cost, and to perform
excessively bureaucratic paperwork
and social planning, or else face loss
of recognition or college ownership.
To date, most houses have success
fully complied and resisted coercion;
as at Stanford, however, the only
lasting result has been distrust of the
administration.
In the future I hope you will label
"Campus Compendium" as the
opinions section it is, and not as the
factual reporting you purport it to
be.

Residential visions
David Lempert's thought
provoking comments (The Daily,
Oct. 17) suggest that the vision of
residential education is not being
realized in most residences. Lempert
believes that preoccupation with
counseling and advising functions
leaves residence staff little time for
intellectual programming.
Like Lempert, I would welcome
more intellectual and educational
programs in the residences. I also
agree that greater institutional re
sources devoted to supporting resi
dent fellows and programming
efforts would help. But I do want to
point out the remarkable strength of
educational programming in the
residences right now. In addition to
the Branner programs which Lem
pert rightly mentions, here are just a
few of the noteworthy efforts that
are under way in the first four weeks
of this quarter:
• Residence-based courses taught by
resident fellows, such as
"Masterpieces of American
Literature," "Introduction to the
Arts," "Truth in Journalism: Fact or
Fiction" and "Chicano Lives";
• 17 Western Culture sections;
• A residence night at "A Soldier's
Play" in which more than 400 stu
dents took part, followed by various
dorm discussions and a dinner with
some of the actors;
• A series of films on American
labor history as well as a number of
discussions on labor led by Guest
Prof. A.H. Raskin;
• Numerous programs following the

presidential and vice-presidential
debates, including faculty-led discus
sions and one featuring a panel of
professional journalists;
• A noon lecture on Chicanos in the
political process;
• A group outing to the San Fran
cisco Opera to see "L'elisir
D'amore";
• Faculty talks on subjects such as
military history, the Middle East and
economics in the 1984 elections;
• A filmmaker showing and discuss
ing her film on fathers and their roles
and relationships within the family;
• A workshop with a professional
dance company;
• The Roble-Lagunita election ex
change program;
• An RF-led trip to the Getty
Museum;
• Presentations on campus educa
tional offerings such as computer
resources and Hopkins Marine Sta
tion.
Lempert is right that we expect a
great deal from resident assistants. It
is the residence staff who have the
best chance to help students see the
connection between what is studied
in the classroom and what happens
in the residences. The most success
ful RAs, and Lempert was one,
know that students respond
positively when intellectual programs
are part of an entire fabric of activi
ties which enhance students' out-of
classroom life. When residential
education works well, the various
aspects of residence life contribute to
each other — community feeling
enhances participation in educational
activities at the same time as shared

intellectual discussion and debate
build residents' knowledge of and
feeling for each other. In other
words, it is in the residences that
students integrate the various aspects
of their lives: intellectual, academic,
social, cultural, recreational, emo
tional and so on. It's a lot to ask, but
well worth the effort.

Dartmouth Indians
In his haste to malign opposing
viewpoints, your reporter
in "Adviser indoctrination"
(The Daily, Oct. 17) mangled his
facts. As a former editor of The
Dartmouth Review and a member of
the Dartmouth fraternity system, I
feel obliged to set the record
straight.
Dartmouth College has tradition
ally held a profile of an Indian brave
as its symbol (not mascot, with all
the demeaning aspects that word
entails). This tradition stems from
the original purpose of the college's
founder, the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock,
to educate Indian youth. Unfortun
ately, among the many positive
changes at the college in the 1970s
came the ill-advised suppression of
the Indian symbol. Contrary to your
report. The Dartmouth Review,
along with substantial numbers of
alumni and a majority of the under
graduates, advocates the
reinstatement of the Indian symbol
and not the repressive status quo. In
addition, a recent poll of over 100

Indian tribal leaders and councils
across the United States shows over
whelming support for a dignified
Indian symbol as a tribute to all
Native Americans (The Dartmouth
Review, Vol. 5, No. 2, Oct. 3, 1984)
Finally, Dartmouth is not merely
"revamping" its fraternity system.
Rather, the current college adminis
tration has brought pressure on
fraternities to make physical im
provements to their houses at exor
bitant cost, and to perform
excessively bureaucratic paperwork
and social planning, or else face loss
of recognition or college ownership.
To date, most houses have success
fully complied and resisted coercion;
as at Stanford, however, the only
lasting result has been distrust of the
administration.
In the future I hope you will label
"Campus Compendium" as the
opinions section it is, and not as the
factual reporting you purport it to
be.
