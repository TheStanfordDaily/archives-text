# Stanford acquires Steinbeck papers
## 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Staff writer 
After negotiating "for quite some time," the
University has acquired an unpublished short
story and several personal letters by novelist
John Steinbeck, a Green Library official an
nounced yesterday.
Michael Ryan, director of Special Collections
at the library, said the seven letters go into detail
about many people Steinbeck found fascinating
and may have influenced the 1944 novel,
"Cannery Row."
The letters were written to Margaret Gem
mell, a former Stanford student and girlfriend of
Steinbeck, during 1925-26. They "capture in
very touching ways the loneliness and sadness of
a young man from the West Coast in the big
city," Ryan said.
The short story, which dates from the same
period, as a thinly masked "autobiographical es
say about a young man alone in New York on
Christmas Eve," he said.
The material was purchased from Heritage
Books in Los Angeles two to three weeks ago.
Though he would not name the amount paid,
Ryan called it "a not inequitable sum," funded

by the Charlotte Ashley Felton Memorial Fund.
Steinbeck, who attended classes here sporadi
cally from 1919 until 1925, left the University
"to attempt to crack the literary world," Ryan
said. "The short story and the letters . . . are our
only documentation of a very important time in
Steinbeck's life."
Carlton Sheffield, Steinbeck's former
roommate in Encina Hall, said in an interview
yesterday that the late author's frequent ab
sences "were partly because of health." The 83-
year-old Sheffield, who lives in Los Altos, said
Steinbeck sometimes had trouble making grades
here.
"In 1920 he (Steinbeck) was told that he was
flunking out. He disappeared and said he was
going to China. He ended up working in San
Francisco," Sheffield said.
In 1925 Steinbeck dropped out of Stanford
permanently. He spent the next several years in
New York trying, unsuccessfully, to get his short
stories published. The short story now housed at
Green, as well as the Gemmell letters, are
among the few documents remaining from the
unfruitful years before "Tortilla Flat" was pub
lished in 1935.


Green Library has acquired an untitled short story and seven per
sonal letters written by Nobel prize-winning author John Stein
beck. The materials date from 1925-26, after Steinbeck left the
University to break into the literary world.
