## Dave Dutcher Caught looking ahead 
### 
Stanford was ahead of Washing
ton State University, 28-7, at
halftime of Saturday's football
game. At this point, the tempta
tion to look toward the Cardinal's
12th game of the season — the
one not on the schedule — could
not be avoided by some.
"Well, after this one we've got
Oregon State up there." said one
hopeful, enjoying the exact
thoughts of many who began
looking anxiously at Stanford's
upcoming schedule. "That's 5-3.
You figure if we get a split with
USC and Arizona and beat Cal,
that puts us at 7-4 and into some
bowl game. It probably won't be
the Rose Bowl, but, hey, after last
season, it's a bowl."
A couple hours later, the 4-3
Stanford team with a chance at a
berth in at least a minor bowl
became the 3-4 Cardinal hoping to
win half its remaining games and
call 1984 an achievement over the
1-10 campaign of 1983.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway has
to hope his team can recover from
Saturday. I can't imagine much
worse than a team going into a
game shaking its head about
the past week and losing to, ahem.
Oregon State University. On the
other hand, what better way to
pick up a confidence-building vic
tory than to travel to Corvallis,
Ore. for a chippie against the
Beavers?
The latter probably was ( one of
the prevalent thoughts last season
before the Cardinal proceeded to
become one of two teams to lose
to Oregon State last year.
One of the features of the new
Elway Era supposedly includes
leaving the past weekend's loss on
the field and looking forward to
winning the next weekend.
That theory might not get much
of a test against Oregon State,
which is in ninth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
But Stanford, which is half a
game ahead of lOth-place Univer
sity of California at Berkeley,
would be wise not to put this one
in the win column ahead of time,
like it might have done against
Washington State. That's because
Oregon State was humbled, to put
it mildly, by Arizona State Univer
sity Saturday 45-10. A win against
the Cardinal would take the bad
taste out of the mouths of the
Beavers.
• • •

Believe it or not, there were
positive aspects about Stanford's
play Saturday. Whereas the game
itself had an unpredictable finish,
the performance of the Cardinal's
special teams was, for the most
part, commendable and helped
build a seemingly insurmountable
lead.
The punting game, which has
gotten its share of criticism lately,
seems to be solid, at least for the
present. Freshman Doug Robison
had a 47-yard average on five
punts.
And don't forget Mark Har
mon's 53-yard field goal, which
was good with room to spare. Har
mon became Stanford's career
field goal record holder against the
University of Washington and has
missed only one field goal attempt
this season.
Most important were the two
blocked punts, both of which were
recovered by Chris Weber, who
capitalized by falling on one in the
endzone. The second block led to
a touchdown run by Kevin Scott
that put Stanford ahead 35-7.

From the football field to the
hockey field. The Stanford field
hockey team will be fighting a
team it has lost to twice this season
as well as the "establishment."
The Cardinal, ranked 15th in
the country, will play llth-ranked
San Jose State for the third time
Saturday. Keep in mind that the
top 12 teams in the country are so
determined before participating in
the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament next
month.
Therefore, it would seem safe to
assume that a victory over San
Jose State would adequately dem
onstrate the ability of the Car
dinal, which has defeated two top
-10 ranked teams and tied one.
Not quite. According to Stan
ford Coach Onnie Killefer, teams
in the western region of the
country sometimes aren't ranked
as high as they deserve to be. "I'm
not sure that's necessarily in
dicative of hockey out west," Kil
lefer said.
The end result is that the field
hockey team's postseason hopes
depend not only upon its perfor
mance in its final two games but
also upon how n?uch it is affected
by a bias in fzvor of Eastern
teams. That's unlortunate, Killefer
said. 1 agree.

as well as the "establishment."
The Cardinal, ranked 15th in
the country, will play llth-ranked
San Jose State for the third time
Saturday. Keep in mind that the
top 12 teams in the country are so
determined before participating in
the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament next
month.
Therefore, it would seem safe to
assume that a victory over San
Jose State would adequately dem
onstrate the ability of the Car
dinal, which has defeated two top
-10 ranked teams and tied one.
Not quite. According to Stan
ford Coach Onnie Killefer, teams
in the western region of the
country sometimes aren't ranked
as high as they deserve to be. "I'm
not sure that's necessarily in
dicative of hockey out west," Kil
lefer said.
The end result is that the field
hockey team's postseason hopes
depend not only upon its perfor
mance in its final two games but
also upon how n?uch it is affected
by a bias in fzvor of Eastern
teams. That's unlortunate, Killefer
said. 1 agree.

Stanford was ahead of Washing
ton State University, 28-7, at
halftime of Saturday's football
game. At this point, the tempta
tion to look toward the Cardinal's
12th game of the season — the
one not on the schedule — could
not be avoided by some.
"Well, after this one we've got
Oregon State up there." said one
hopeful, enjoying the exact
thoughts of many who began
looking anxiously at Stanford's
upcoming schedule. "That's 5-3.
You figure if we get a split with
USC and Arizona and beat Cal,
that puts us at 7-4 and into some
bowl game. It probably won't be
the Rose Bowl, but, hey, after last
season, it's a bowl."
A couple hours later, the 4-3
Stanford team with a chance at a
berth in at least a minor bowl
became the 3-4 Cardinal hoping to
win half its remaining games and
call 1984 an achievement over the
1-10 campaign of 1983.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway has
to hope his team can recover from
Saturday. I can't imagine much
worse than a team going into a
game shaking its head about
the past week and losing to, ahem.
Oregon State University. On the
other hand, what better way to
pick up a confidence-building vic
tory than to travel to Corvallis,
Ore. for a chippie against the
Beavers?
The latter probably was ( one of
the prevalent thoughts last season
before the Cardinal proceeded to
become one of two teams to lose
to Oregon State last year.
One of the features of the new
Elway Era supposedly includes
leaving the past weekend's loss on
the field and looking forward to
winning the next weekend.
That theory might not get much
of a test against Oregon State,
which is in ninth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
But Stanford, which is half a
game ahead of lOth-place Univer
sity of California at Berkeley,
would be wise not to put this one
in the win column ahead of time,
like it might have done against
Washington State. That's because
Oregon State was humbled, to put
it mildly, by Arizona State Univer
sity Saturday 45-10. A win against
the Cardinal would take the bad
taste out of the mouths of the
Beavers.

Believe it or not, there were
positive aspects about Stanford's
play Saturday. Whereas the game
itself had an unpredictable finish,
the performance of the Cardinal's
special teams was, for the most
part, commendable and helped
build a seemingly insurmountable
lead.
The punting game, which has
gotten its share of criticism lately,
seems to be solid, at least for the
present. Freshman Doug Robison
had a 47-yard average on five
punts.
And don't forget Mark Har
mon's 53-yard field goal, which
was good with room to spare. Har
mon became Stanford's career
field goal record holder against the
University of Washington and has
missed only one field goal attempt
this season.
Most important were the two
blocked punts, both of which were
recovered by Chris Weber, who
capitalized by falling on one in the
endzone. The second block led to
a touchdown run by Kevin Scott
that put Stanford ahead 35-7.

hockey team will be fighting a
