# Spikers take on Chinese
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team will host the China Zhe Xiang
Club Team tonight in an unusual ex
hibition match.
The Chinese team, representing
the province of Zhe Xiang, is touring
the West Coast and has matches
against several collegiate teams, in
cluding the University of Washing
ton, the University of Oregon, and
Portland State University.
Stanford is helping fund the team's
trip as an exchange with the Chinese
team. According to Asst. Coach Don
Shaw, the Cardinal hopes that the
Chinese will reciprocate when, and if,
the team travels to China. Tickets will
be sold to help raise funds.
The Chinese will be the Cardinal's
toughest competition this year, Shaw
said. China's national team is chosen
from each province's club team, and
Zhe Xiang has three former national
team players on the tour.
Shaw expects them to run a fairly
fast offense characterized by quick,
low sets. He also expects the Chinese
to follow the Asian style of dis
ciplined ball control. "The Chinese
make very few mental mistakes. As
seen with the Chinese Olympic team,
they put a lot of pressure on their op
ponents to make a great play. . . . We
can't give them an easy downball or
freeball — it would be like giving the
point away," he said.

Cardinal blocking will also be chal
lenged by the Chinese. "They run so
many quick sets we will really have to
be sharp," Shaw said. "Our blockers
will have a tough time following the
ball."
Much of this burden will fall on
Stanford's middle blocker, Kim
Oden. The Western Collegiate Ath
letic Association named her Athelete
of the Week for h£r outstanding per
formances in the Cardinal's wins over
second-ranked UCLA and sixth
ranked San Diego State University
last week.
Against UCLA, Oden had 22 kills
and a .589 hitting percentage. She
followed that with 16 kills and a .667
hitting percentage against San Diego
State. TTie significance of the matches
was also taken into consideration.
The two conference wins moved the
Cardinal into second place with a 6-1
record. San Diego State is in first
place in the WCAA with a record of
7-1.
Shaw hopes for a good turnout for
the match against the Chinese. "We
would like to show them a good time
here," he said. "If it's at all possible,
we'd like to make a tour over there
sometime. .. . They are an excellent
team. You won't see any better vol
leyball from any team we play."
Tickets will be $2 for students, fac
ulty and staff and $4 for general ad
mission. The match starts at 7:30 in
Maples Pavilion.
