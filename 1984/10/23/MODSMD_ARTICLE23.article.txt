# Second place on the line for men
## Soccer needs to beat Dons 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
Second place in the Pacific Coast Conference will be on
the line today when the Stanford men's soccer team hosts
the perennially powerful University of San Francisco.
The Cardinal is coming off a 3-2 victory over the Uni
versity of the Pacific that ran its PSC record to 3-1. The
Dons are 1-0 in the conference and 6-4-2 overall. They
are one of three undefeated teams in the PSC, along with
the University of California at Berkeley, which is 2-0, and
Fresno State, which is 3-0.
USF has been a powerhouse for the last ten years or so,
winning a number of PSC titles and national champion
ships. Although it has lost four games this year, including
a 4-0 decision to UCLA (who the Cardinal tied 2-2),
Stanford Head Coach Sam Koch is not taking the Dons
lightly.
"They've been great," Koch said. "And they're still
great no matter what anybody says." To beat the Dons,
Stanford will "have to play as well as we can, and hope
that they (USF) play an average game. If they execute and
play well, we will have to play better than we have all
season to beat them."
The first step in beating the Dons, Koch said, is to play

tough defense. "We have to stop their forwards â€” they
are all very fast." USF has three players in the top 12 in
PSC scoring. But the USF defense has allowed 19 goals
and may be the Dons' achilles heel.
"They are suspect on defense," Koch said. "Their
defense plays flat, which may allow us to send the ball
through. Their defense is skilled, but they play straight
across for some reason. Once we're by them, there's no
one else there."
The Cardinal will stay with the four fullback, four
midfielder, two forward formation it has used since it tied
UCLA six games ago, although Koch said it will show
some new wrinkles against USF.
The victory over UOP on Saturday was not as close as
the score indicated, according to Koch, as the Tigers
scored on a penalty kick after what Koch said he felt was a
bad call. Also, Stanford played part of the second half
shorthanded after junior fullback Phil Horvath was red
carded.
League rules specify that Horvath, who has started all
season, must miss the next home game. In his place, fresh
man forward Robin Vasan, who has experience in the
backfield, will likely start at fullback against USF.
