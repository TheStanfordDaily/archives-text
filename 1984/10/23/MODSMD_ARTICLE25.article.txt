In "Utu," Geoff Murphy's film
about the Maori uprisings in New
Zealand .in the 1870s, Te Wheke
(Anzac Wallace), the native chieftain
whose men have taken over the house
of a white landowner named William
son (Bruno Lawrence), sits reading in
the library. While his followers set
fires and calmly toss a piano out the
window, Te Wheke remains absorbed
in a copy of "Macbeth," and later he
borrows military tactics from Shake
speare, camouflaging his rebels be
hind moving branches like Birnam
Wood coming to Dunsinane.
Te Wheke sees himself as Macduff:

Returning from a stint with the
British army, he found his vil
lage razed and his family
slaughtered by British officers, and he
declared a private war on the
"pakeha" (the Maori term for the
English rulers). Unlike his counter
part, the aboriginal Jimmie Black
smith in the majestic Australian film
"The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith,"
whose revenge against the white men
who have rejected him takes the form
of a murderous attack on their wo
men and children, Te Wheke, an im
mensely charismatic figure, or
chestrates his war into a political
movement. And through it, he
portrays himself as the justified
avenger. ("Utu!" is a Maori ven
geance cry.) But another Macduff
pursues him — Williamson, whom Te
Wheke presumed dead, is provoked
by the Maori's destruction of his
home and murder of his wife to seek
his own vengeance. And Te Wheke is
Williamson's Macbeth.
The small New Zealand film indus-

try receives almost no press in this
country, and Geokf Murphy is only
the second director whose work has
been seen over here. The first, Roger
Donaldson, brought out the
remarkable domestic drama "Smash
Palace" in I 982 and, earlier this year,
the underrated "The Bounty."
Unlikely as it may be, New Zealand
seems to have at least two first-rate
directors. "Utu" is an exhilarating
movie, filmed with as much grandeur
as wit. Murphy, who co-authored the
script with Keith Aberdein, has a
bristling intelligence. As he intro
duces more and more characters, in

triguing parallels appear and new
layers of meaning gather.
Te Wheke's declaration of war
(affected by a double act: shooting a
British soldier — a comrade — in
symbolic reprisal for the deaths of his
family, and hatcheting a fire-and
brimstone white preacher delivering a
sermon to a native congregation)
polarizes the' Maori and the pakeha,
but neither side is homogeneous.
Colonel Elliot (Tim Elliott), leader of
the British forces, numbers among his
principal aides the eccentric, un
reliable Williamson, who wields a
multi-barreled rifle that dwarfs him,
the sweet, earnest and naive young
Lieutenant Scott (Kelly Johnson),
and Wiremu (Wi Kuki Kaa), a Maori
who has chosen the pakeha side of
the conflict because, educated by the
British, he considers himself the intel
lectual superior of his native brothers.
(As it happens, he has an intricate,
finely disciplined mind that makes


formance this year (he was the
Polynesian king who handed his
daughter over to Mel Gibson in "The
Bounty"), and especially Anzac
Wallace.
Anzac Wallace, a 41-year-old
making his acting debut in "Utu,"
was the product of an unhappy home;
his Maori parents represented, he
says, the continuing cultural oppres
sion of the native New Zealanders by
the English. After serving 14 years in
prison for armed robbery and other

those of his fellow soldiers seem puny
by comparison.) And among Te
Wheke's followers, who share a com
mitment to his cause but not to his
leadership — his brutality divides
them — is Kura (Tania Bristowe), a
sensuous, playful woman who takes
on a series of roles in relation to the
inexperienced young lieutenant: She
begins as his taunter, becomes his
prisoner and ends as his lover.
Murphy can be lyrical and
humorous at the same time. His gifts
for imagery and irony complement
each other when he shows us Wil
liamson's piano splintering on the
ground outside his house in
Peckinpah-like slow motion, or when
he presents Williamson himself as a
portrait of the frontiersman, the hero
of a Hollywood Western staunchly
defending his hard-won land — and
then places a firearm in his hands that
could blow Te Wheke and his whole
crew straight to hell.
Murphy and his photographer,
Graeme Cowley, film scenes of riding
and shooting that are the best of their
kind since "The Long Riders," but he
doesn't think in epic terms — he
centers the film on his actors,
employing them as dramatic (and vis
ual) anchors. And he has a terrific
cast, all of them rich camera subjects:
Bruno Lawrence, who played the dis
possessed father in "Smash Palace,"
the radiant Tania Bristowe, Wi Kuki
Kaa in his second extraordinary per-

crimes, he worked in construction
and became active in union politics in
New Zealand. Geoff Murphy first
saw him in some documentary
footage of a labor dispute and asked
him to test for the role of Te Wheke.
Years of anger, violence and cul
tural pride surface in his perfor
mance. His face completely covered
in tattoos (an image Murphy com
ments on late in the film when he
shows us Williamson's face painted
with blood), locks of his jet hair
tightly curled like twine, his eyes
wide, revealing spheres of solid white,
his tongue darting in'and out like a
snake's, he is more than a warrior

king — he's a child's nightmare at
tacker, a predator.
Murphy, too canny to be cowed by
this grand-scale monster-avenger,
gives us a short scene in which Te
Wheke practices his tongue move
ments in front of a mirror. Murphy,
like the lovers in "A Midsummer
Night's Dream," views his
protagonist "with a parted eye,/when
everything seems double" — he
respects and abhors him, honors and
satirizes him. By the time Te Wheke

comes to trial for the killings he has
perpetrated (an event that the
filmmakers anticipate in a needlessly
complicated flashback/flash-forward
set-up), practically everyone wants
him dead, pakeha and Maori alike,
and they vie for the role of ex
ecutioner, but Murphy awards the
distinction to the only character who
can carry the sentence through with
ritual solemnity. Having undercut Te
Wheke's heroic stature throughout
"Utu," Murphy restores it in the as
tonishing last moments of the movie.
He is an exciting new director, and
"Utu" is the only picture of substance
that has appeared in months.
