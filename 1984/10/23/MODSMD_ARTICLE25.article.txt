In "Utu," Geoff Murphy's film
about the Maori uprisings in New
Zealand .in the 1870s, Te Wheke
(Anzac Wallace), the native chieftain
whose men have taken over the house
of a white landowner named William
son (Bruno Lawrence), sits reading in
the library. While his followers set
fires and calmly toss a piano out the
window, Te Wheke remains absorbed
in a copy of "Macbeth," and later he
borrows military tactics from Shake
speare, camouflaging his rebels be
hind moving branches like Birnam
Wood coming to Dunsinane.
Te Wheke sees himself as Macduff:

Returning from a stint with the
British army, he found his vil
lage razed and his family
slaughtered by British officers, and he
declared a private war on the
"pakeha" (the Maori term for the
English rulers). Unlike his counter
part, the aboriginal Jimmie Black
smith in the majestic Australian film
"The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith,"
whose revenge against the white men
who have rejected him takes the form
of a murderous attack on their wo
men and children, Te Wheke, an im
mensely charismatic figure, or
chestrates his war into a political
movement. And through it, he
portrays himself as the justified
avenger. ("Utu!" is a Maori ven
geance cry.) But another Macduff
pursues him — Williamson, whom Te
Wheke presumed dead, is provoked
by the Maori's destruction of his
home and murder of his wife to seek
his own vengeance. And Te Wheke is
Williamson's Macbeth.
The small New Zealand film indus-

try receives almost no press in this
country, and Geokf Murphy is only
the second director whose work has
been seen over here. The first, Roger
Donaldson, brought out the
remarkable domestic drama "Smash
Palace" in I 982 and, earlier this year,
the underrated "The Bounty."
Unlikely as it may be, New Zealand
seems to have at least two first-rate
directors. "Utu" is an exhilarating
movie, filmed with as much grandeur
as wit. Murphy, who co-authored the
script with Keith Aberdein, has a
bristling intelligence. As he intro
duces more and more characters, in

triguing parallels appear and new
layers of meaning gather.
Te Wheke's declaration of war
(affected by a double act: shooting a
British soldier — a comrade — in
symbolic reprisal for the deaths of his
family, and hatcheting a fire-and
brimstone white preacher delivering a
sermon to a native congregation)
polarizes the' Maori and the pakeha,
but neither side is homogeneous.
Colonel Elliot (Tim Elliott), leader of
the British forces, numbers among his
principal aides the eccentric, un
reliable Williamson, who wields a
multi-barreled rifle that dwarfs him,
the sweet, earnest and naive young
Lieutenant Scott (Kelly Johnson),
and Wiremu (Wi Kuki Kaa), a Maori
who has chosen the pakeha side of
the conflict because, educated by the
British, he considers himself the intel
lectual superior of his native brothers.
(As it happens, he has an intricate,
finely disciplined mind that makes
