# Oh, Kay' lackluster and amateurish
## 
### LIBBY RUFFING 
The Menlo Players' production of
Gershwin's "Oh, Kay" was an
agonizing experience for all involved.
I was reduced to yawns of boredom,
my date resorted to reading Plato's
"Republic," the majority of the audi
ence engaged in an exercise of pa
tience and the cast itself appeared
anxious for the show to end.
The play gave new meaning to the
expression "amateur production." 1
have seen high school musicals in the
back woods of Wisconsin performed
with more energy and excitement.
This sorry excuse for entertainment
began with a slow-moving chorus
scene. The enunciation was poor and
the volume so low that without the
use of my program, I never would
have grasped the purpose of the tune.
The final crescendo was lost in an in
discernable mumbo-jumbo of fuzzy
voices. With this inauspicious musical
beginning, I thought the dialogue
could only be better. Unfortunately, I
was sadly mistaken. The acting was
staid and stale.
Luckily, the dialogue was recited
much more clearly than the singing,
or else the entire meaning would have
perished in undertones. The story line
is a basic romantic musical plot. Set
in the 19205, it focuses on bootleg
ging among Long Island society. The
action takes place in Jimmy Winter's
East Hampton mansion â€” which re
quired imagination with the Menlo
Players' set.
Winter returns home with his new
wife to discover that his first marriage
has not been annulled. He then meets
his long lost love, Kay, and struggles
with whom he should really marry.
Domestic, legal and romantic compli
cations ensue, but predictably, all is
resolved by the finale and everyone
left the stage happily.
"Oh, Kay" is an infrequently per

formed Gershwin musical, and I can
see whv The story does not transcend
time well; many jokes are lost in the
era gap. or perhaps, were never tunny
anywa> Of course, had it been
choreographed and acted with any
semblance of professionalism, the
stor> would have been much more
appealing. 1 did not care what hap
pened to the characters because I
wasn't treated to a journey back to
the Roaring Twenties; it was simply
two long hours at the Burgess
Theater.
The characters were life-size
cardboard figures. 1 felt as if I were
watching a group of foreigners pres
ent a poorly memorized dialogue
from a textbook Constance Ap
pleton. Winter's wife, portrayed bv
Denise Basham. plodded through her
lines with monotonous consistency.
Her expressions were rehearsed. I
could almost hear director Aldo Boz
zini commanding. "Ok., smile here,
frown there."
Jimmy Winter, played b\ Russ
Bohard. was similarly disappointing.
His lines spewed forth in c. rushed
nasal tone. Bohard did not sing his
solos, he whined them. Obviously,
musical numbers were an unpleasant
interlude. I dreaded the song cues
and cringed at the insipid dialogue.
The supporting characters of Larry,
the Duke and Shorty provided unin
tentional humor. Skip Epstein's
Larry was the victim of poor makeup
application; he looked like an ironic
cross between Boy George and
Howdy Doody. The Duke (Martin
Lilley) constantly appeared uncom
fortable, as if his pants were too tight.
Shorty, played by Ray Doherty,
pranced across the stage waiting for
his cue.
When these three grown men did a
soft-shoe routine, 1 offered them a

silent prayer and stifled a snicker.
The least offensive portrayal was
Carolyn Manning's Kay, the story's
namesake. She had a certain charm
and implemented the Cockney accent
successfully, but her voice was
strained.
The choreographer made a poor
choice in creating too many dance

numbers. It is difficult for a decent
performance to have well-staged
dance numbers, and "Oh, Kay" had
an abundance of poor ones. In a tap
dance routine with Larry and the
chorus, 1 feared the girls would trip
themselves from the looks of anxiety
that shone from behind Vaselined
smiles.

One sad attempt at special effects
included a lit-tambourine chorus
routine in which the batteries failed.
The costumes of "Oh, Kay" were
futile attempts to recreate the Flap
per Era. Constance's sexy negligee
bore an uncanny resemblance to my
grandmother's polyester housecoat.
In general, the cast did not look like

wealthy socialites but like frequent
shoppers at the local Goodwill outlet.
"Oh, Kay" was not entertaining.
The singing was lackluster, the acting
forced, the dancing clumsy. It was an
amateur production of the first order,
and plays Thursdays-Saturdays
through Nov. 10.
