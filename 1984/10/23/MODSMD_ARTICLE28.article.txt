# Week of Oct. 15-22
## Police Blotter 
### 
When it comes to trailer parks, a university can't have too few. Labor
ing under this premise last week, the Stanford police thwarted two sepa
rate attempts to spread Manzanita-mania. On Oct. 19 an officer found
an adult male sleeping in a trailer near Costanzo and Cooksey streets in
the faculty ghetto and asked the dormant dweller to move. Two days
later, an officer gave another adult male, asleep in his vehicle in the
eucalyptus grove, a rather brusk awakening at 6 a.m. Since the miscreant
had been warned several times before, the officer booked him into the
North County Jail and had his vehicle towed.
Escondido Village residents reported several suspicious incidents over
the week. On Oct. 18 a woman saw an unknown man expose himself
outside her window around 10:10 p.m., while one-and-a-half hours later
another resident saw a prowler look through her window shades briefly.
The unknown man ran off when she spotted him.
Drunken behavior dropped slightly last week; police reports list only
one arrest tor driving under the influence and one arrest for being drunk
in public. The drunkards in both cases were booked into North County
Jail. Police made a total of 12 arrests, all for misdemeanors.
The mutability of ownership was ably demonstrated during this per
iod. Nine bicycles changed hands in a variety of milieux, including
Abrams House, Florence Moore, Kappa Sigma House, Lomita, Mirrielees
and Wilbur. Not even The Daily proved immune; a hapless cyclist told
police his bike was taken between 2:40 and 2:42 a.m. on Oct. 15 from
the Storke Student Publications Building area.
Burglars entered two residences and one car, making off with a
camera, recording equipment and other "contents." On Oct. 19 police
apprehended Ngo Hoc for shoplifting in the Stanford Bookstore at 5
p.m. and cited him. In the first robbery of the year, a brigand knocked a
victim to the ground and took his backpack on the bikepath near Green
Library. The backpack contained money collected from the library's
coin changer. In all the'police registered one count of grand theft and
two of petty theft over the week.
The University suffered five acts of vandalism in the interim. Un
known vandals broke a closet window in Varian Physics with an ashtray,
sprayed a fire extinguisher on the second floor of Gavilan Hall in
Florence Moore, smashed a window in Crothers Lot, took candy from a
Hulme House machine, and threw a concrete block through a glass door
in Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
