# Sunshine case may challenge state law
## Neighbors go to court over trees 
### KURT JOHNSON 
Two campus neighbors, who went to
court in August to determine whether
one family's trees have the right to block
another family's sunlight, sent a written
summation of their arguments to a judge
yesterday and expect a decision within
90 days.
Engineering Prof. Rudolph Sher and
his wife Bonnie sued Psychiatry Profs.
Gloria and Herbert Leiderman over the
Shers' right to sunlight. The Shers con
tend that the more than 20 trees in the
Leidermans' backyard constitute a
"private nuisance" because each winter
thev cast a shadow over the Sher home,
located at 740 Mayfiefd Ave.
Victor Sher, a Palo Alto lawyer
representing the plaintiffs, says the trees
have devalued his parents' property, in

terfered with its use, blocked solar heat
and light and caused emotional distress.
The Shers are asking the Santa Clara
County Superior Court to order the
Leidermans to remove two large pine
trees and to trim many others including a
eucalyptus, acacias and a redwood. The
suit was also filed "to recover for loss of
sunlight" and provides that the Leider
mans pay compensatory and punitive da
mages.
According to Leiderman, the current
suit is a result of the Shers' overall dissat
isfaction with their home: "They've been
unhappy with their house from the very,
very start." Leiderman cited a letter
written by the Shers to the Stanford
Housing Office in 1972 as a first indica
tion of the Shers' general dissatisfaction.
"They've been on a tree-cutting

crusade," Leiderman said. "I've spent
$4,000 trimming trees trying to please
them."
Regardless of who wins, the results of
the suit will be important. According to
the attorneys involved, the case could
result in a new state law recognizing sun
light as an important property right. Also
at issue is whether the Shers' house con
stitutes a "natural solar-collecting sys
tem," in which case the 1978 Solar
Shade Control Act, which prohibits
citizens from maintaining trees that
shade a pre-existing solar collector,
could apply. In addition, as Leiderman
pointed out, the suit could "cajjtse a great
deal of litigation between neighbors."
To win the case, the Shers "must
overrule at least 100 years of California
law," according to Mark Solomon, a

Redwood City attorney representing the
Leidermans.
"The Shers wish to benefit their land
at the Leidermans' expense" Solomon
said. He said the Leidermans feel the
Shers are making an "unreasonable im
position" and should have considered
that their house was situated in a
"downhill lot" when they purchased it.
But all three Shers involved noted th.it
the psychological impact of the Leider
mans trees goes far beyond blocking
sun. "It is also a matter of callous indit
ference," the Shers' attorney said.
Mrs. Sher has suffered "great depres
sion" from the lack of sunlight and the
Leidermans' recalcitrance, according to
her husband.
