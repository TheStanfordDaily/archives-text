# Senate may face plan to limit term in office
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Action at tonight's ASSU Senate
meeting will revolve around an
amendment that would limit senators
to three terms, a proposal that the
senate recommend a "yes" vote on
next week's referendum on Univer
sity investments in South Africa and
an address by the dean of Student
Affairs.
Placing the student-intiated consti
tutional amendment on next week's
special election ballot will require
tricky manuevering.
A student petition drive to get the
amendment onto the ballot ran out of
time last week. The petitioners ac
quired the required number of
signatures last month, but only
decided to present the signatures to
the elections commissioner last
Thursday — leaving only 11 days
before the election for verification.
Now, Senators Jay Alter and
Derek Passarelli have taken up the
cause and will attempt to convince
the senate to put the measure on
the ballot.
The tight time frame — the
ASSU's special election is set for next
Tuesday and Wednesday — will
necessitate some parliamentary gym
nastics by the senators.
ASSU bylaws require a proposal to
be placed on a ballot to be considered
at two separate senate hearings, and
tonight's meeting is the final one
scheduled before the elections on
Oct. 30 and 31, Alter said.
To meet that stipulation, the two
senators will introduce the amend
ment early in the meeting, and then
attempt to adjourn the meeting
before the senate does its normal
business.

At that point, Alter and Passarelli
plan to pass a petition around the
senate chamber. If six senators sign
the petition, a new meeting will be
convened five minutes later. Offi
cially then, a new meeting will have
begun, and the amendment can be
legally placed on the ballot, according
to Alter.
The senators want to get the mea
sure on this ballot and not on a spe-

cial winter ballot or on the annual
spring ballot.
If the senate does not place the
amendment on this ballot, the
amendment's organizers could submit
their petitions anyway. In that case,
there would "have to be elections
winter quarter," said Passarelli.
Holding a special election winter
quarter would cost the ASSU $2,500,
he said.
Were the amendment to be ap
proved in this spring's elections, it
would not have any effect for a year
and a half — a delay the amend
ment's sponsors say they don't want.
The senate will recommend a "yes"
vote on a referendum condemning

the University's investments in South
Africa if a bill proposed by Graduate
Senator Mark Landesmann passes
tonight.
The referendum calls for the Uni
versity to sell its 54,000 shares of
stock in Motorola Inc. and requests
the adoption of a "responsible invest
ment policy" toward other companies
operating in South Africa.
Motorola sold "non-tactical" com
munications equipment to the South
African police in 1982, and since then
has not disclosed whether additional
sales were being made. In addition,
Motorola has been complying only
minimally with black employment
guidelines followed by most multi
national corporations operating in
South Africa. '
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons will speak to the body at 7:30
p.m.
In other business, previous notice
will be given for a bill which would
deny free Sunday Flicks passes to
senators. The bill, authored by
Senator Mark Soble, would require
senators to turn in their complimen
tary passes to Sunday Flicks, since the
free passes "foster the image that the
ASSU ... is an elitist club living in
the lap of luxury."
The first round of Publications
Board allocations for this fall will also
be amended, if necessary, and ap
proved by the senate. This will be the
first round of allocations under the
new funding system, which was
adopted by the senate late last
month.
Also included in the special elec
tion will be numerous constitutional
amendments and a referendum on
whom students favor for U.S. presi
dent.
