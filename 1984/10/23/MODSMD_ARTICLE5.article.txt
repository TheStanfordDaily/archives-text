# Activists rap rape myths
## 
### MARY YUH Staff writer 
The annual Rape Awareness Series began yesterday
with a noon rally in White Plaza and an evening showing
of the film, "Killing Us Softly," followed with a talk by
Ann Simonton, a former model and current
feminist/activist.
"Rapists are husbands, brothers, teachers, priests, a
man from the office, a guy who lives down the hall, a
boyfriend. But because we are used to thinking of rape as
a crime perpetrated by deranged strangers, it is difficult
for many of us to recognize acquaintance rape when it
happens," said Pilar Ossorio, a member of the Rape Edu
cation Project in her speech at the rally.
"If she said 'no,'. . . and her words or behavior were
disregarded and she was forced, through violence or
threat of violence, through bullying, or in less physically
but equally oppressive and coercive ways, to submit to

sexual intimacies she did not want, or to have intercourse
against her will — it is rape." Asst. Dean of Residential
Education Alice Supton said at the noon rally.
"And the man who coerced the woman into sexual ac
tivity against her will is a rapist, " Supton said.
"Yes, rapes happen at Stanford'," she said. "What can
be done to prevent acqaintance rape at Stanford? I have a
one-word answer: Talk. The decision to be intimate
should be mutual."
"I have been raped," said Maria Lynn, co-coordinator
of San Jose State University's Women's Center, at the
rally. "1 kept thinking, this must be what it's like to be a
woman."
Through the media and through culture, society blames
women for being raped, for enticing the rapist, and often
the victim herself will agree with society and feel guilt and

shame, she said.
Lynn spoke of how her friend, in
whom she confided the rape, told her
that she was crazy, that she must have
wanted it, and after all, she knew the
man and had been at a party in his
apartment. Myths like this one, that

the woman wanted to have sex and
therefore was not raped, still persist,
along with many others, she said.
Supton spoke of that myth and of
the"It can't happen to me" myth.
"We know that no woman can think
herself safe,"-she said. "Because she
is a woman, she is a potential rape
victim."
Feminist Ann Simonton came from
a different perspective.

"1 was a prostitute. 1 was selling my
body," said Simonton about her ex
perience as a top fashion model.
Gang raped at knifepoint, she said
she reached a turning point and
began to realize the power and the
oppression of the media over women.
"We live in terror and we swallow
it and we accept it as part of being an
American woman," Simonton said.
