Carter plan to pay press revealed
WASHINGTON — The Carter administration set up a covert CIA
program in early 1978 to induce the European press to write favorably
about neutron weapons and expose Soviet efforts to block deployment, a
new study by Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government
says.
A former Carter administration official who was involved in the early
stages of the program said it included a plan to pay foreign journalists to
write "favorable articles" on the neutron shells, which became contro
versial in part because they were built to kill more by radiation and less
by blast than other nuclear weapons.
Supporters said neutron weapons might thus do less damage, but op
ponents said this also might make it more likely that nuclear weapons
would be used.
The Harvard study alludes to possible payments to journalists, saying
that the covert activity contemplated included "asking U.S. sympa
thizers and agents in the European press corps to give more favorable
press coverage to the bomb either for money or for free."
It is not clear whether payments were made, however. The neutron
weapons have never been deployed.
A former top CIA official said in an interview that he did not "recall [the
neutron operation] as a major program" but added that "the placement
of stories" was part of an ongoing effort by the agency "to counter So
viet propaganda."
The Harvard study, "The Press and the Neutron Bomb," written by
consultant David Whitman, says the covert action program "was
prompted by covert and semicovert Soviet infiltration of the anti
neutron bomb movement in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands."
CIA contradicts Reagan on manual
WASHINGTON — The CIA, implicitly contradicting President
Reagan, told the Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday that every
copy of a CIA-written handbook for Nicaraguan rebels contained in
structions on "neutralizing" government officials, a member of the panel
said.
Reagan claimed in Sunday night's presidential debate that CIA offi
cials excised the pages dealing with assassination. But after a three-hour
briefing. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said he did not agree. "The term
'neutralization' was in all the documents," Nunn declared.
He added: "All of the documents had questionable or objectionable
material. The book itself should not have been published or distributed
by the CIA."
Nunn said that Reagan was apparently correct when he said that the
CIA had deleted some pages from the 90-page manual — but not those
that seem to urge assassination.
But another member of the panel, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.),
said he did not believe that the word "neutralization" referred to assas
sination.
"There are all kinds of other readings you could put on it," Wallop
said. "It could mean simply to get someone out of the way, lock him in a
closet, put him in jail."
A member of the committee staff said the ClA's position was also that
"there's nothing wrong with the word 'neutralization.' "
During the debate, Reagan said that the manual had been prepared by
a CIA operative in Central America and submitted to superiors for their
approval. Reagan said "the man in charge" in the area "recognized that
what was in that manual was direct contravention of my own executive
order in December of 1981 that we would have nothing to do with
regard to political assassinations," and cut those sections out.
FBI agent, emigres plead innocent
LOS ANGELES — Former FBI agent Richard Millei and two Soviet
emigres accused of espionage activities pleaded not guilty yesterday in
federal court here to charges of spying for the Soviet.Union.
U.S. District Judge David Kenyon set a trial date of Dec. 4 for the
three accused spies, but federal prosecutors said it was likely that Miller
would be tried first on the charges that he attempted to sell secret FBI
documents to the two Soviets.
U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner said he would move next week that
Miller's case be separated from those of Svetlana Ogorodnikova, 34, and
her husband, Nikolay Ogorodnikov, 51.
While Bonner declined to say why the government would request the
severance, government officials have said that statements made by Mil
ler to the FBI before his arrest can only be used against him and would
be considered as hearsay evidence against the Russians.
The prosecution's strategy will be to attempt to convict Miller first,
then try the Ogorodnikovs.
Watching as Miller, 47, was brought into the courtroom in chains with
the other defendants, were Miller's wife, Paula, and two of his eight
children, Paul, 19, and Drew, 17, who is deaf. Miller, smiling at his fam
ily, communicated with them by sign language as he waited for the court
session to begin.
Miller and the Ogorodnikovs were arrested by FBI agents Oct. 2 and
have been held in federal custody since their arrest on the espionage
charges.
Shultz cites USSR rights violations
WASHINGTON — In a sharp departure from the Reagan adminis
tration's recent conciliatory gestures toward the Soviet Union, Secretary
of State George Shultz said yesterday that the United States was deter
mined to exact an increasing diplomatic price for Moscow's human rights
violations.
The United States will not mute its criticism of Soviet treatment of
ideological dissidents and ethnic minorities, even if negotiations resume
on arms control or other ways of easing frictions between the super
powers, Shultz said in accepting a humanitarian award from the National
Conference on Soviet Jewry.
"The Soviets know that we seek to put relations on a stable and con
structive basis for the long term," he said. "But I think they also know
that we will not stop our practice of calling them to account for their
abuses of human rights."
Shultz said the treatment of Soviet Jews wishing to emigrate had sel
dom been worse, but he emphasized that Jews "are not the only victims
of Soviet persecution."
As if to dramatize the point, the State Department said that a Uk
rainian human rights activist committed suicide in a Soviet labor camp
recently because of "willful mistreatment" by the authorities. The state
ment, attributed to reliable information obtained by the embassy in
Moscow, was the first public announcement of the death of Yuriy Litvin,
a poet and journalist who spent 20 of his 50 years as a political prisoner.
Unless the Soviet authorities soften the treatment of political oppo
nents, Shultz said, they will face increasing "international — and internal
— pressures for better performance."
"Doesn't the Soviet Union pay a price for this censure and for the iso
lation that goes with it?" Shultz said. "The price is large and steadily in
creasing. And let me add . . . that we shall continue to do all in our
power to see that the price continues to increase."
A State Department official explained that Shultz was referring to
steady U.S. diplomatic pressure intended to erode Moscow's carefully
nurtured image as a civilized world power. As an example of the results
so far, the official cited criticism of the Soviet Union that has developed
in the last few years in the "intellectual left" of France.
