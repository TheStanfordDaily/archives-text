MANILA, Philippinesâ€” President
Ferdinand Marcos this morning ac
cepted the report of the chairwoman
of the board investigating the
Benigno Aquino assassination and
said the case would be prosecuted
before a special court "because mili
tary men are involved."
The chairwoman, former Appeals
Court judge Corazon Agrava, pre
sented her findings to Marcos shortly
after announcing that she would
release her own report separately
from one to be presented by the other
members of the investigative panel.
Neither Marcos nor Agrava gave
any details of her report, which was
handed over in brief ceremonies

broadcast on national television.
Aquino, a former senator who was
considered the chief political rival to
Marcos, was killed Aug. 21, 1983, as
military police escorted him from the
airliner that brought him back from
self-imposed exile in the United
States.
Marcos made the comment about
military men off the air to reporters at
the presidential palace. The military
and Marcos had claimed Aquino was
killed by a communist a%ent.
Another member of the panel said
earlier that all five members "more or
less" agreed that Aquino was killed in
a military conspiracy. Comments
from panel members indicated

Agrava disagreed with their decision
to accuse the armed forces chief of
staff, Gen. Fabian Ver, of involve
ment in such a conspiracy.
Yesterday, a board lawyer said the
panel had finished its report and dis
regarded the retraction of a witness
who testified he saw a soldier shoot
Aquino.
Attorney Albino A'rriero said the
board was having the report
reproduced for release this week. He
made no mention of the separate
report by Agrava.
Also yesterday, a military general
who was commanding soldiers guard
ing Aquino at the time of the assas
sination claimed that a board lawyer

had offered one of his soldiers a trip
abroad as inducement to get him to
change his testimony before the
112 Luther Custodio told a news
conference that attorney Mario
Ongkiko, a board deputy counsel,
made the alleged offer to air force
Sgt. Reynaldo de la Cruz. Cruz had
testified he did not see the assassina
tion because he was looking else
where.
Custodio said other witnesses may
receive a similar offer. He did not say
how the board allegedly wanted Cruz
to change his testimony.
