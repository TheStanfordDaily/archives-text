# Mondale campaigns on leadership
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA â€” Walter Mondale yesterday
unloaded a withering critique of his debate op
ponent, calling the President Reagan of Kansas
City a dangerously "detached, remote and misin
formed" leader who tried to shuck off responsibil
, ity for his foreign policy failures.
"Last night the American people saw with their
own eyes what the problem is," Mondale told a
lunch-hour rally of 15,000 people at JFK Plaza
here. "They saw a president who cannot discuss
any major issue without making a major
mistake. .. . They saw a commander-in-chief who
is not commanding and who isn't a chief."
With his slashing reviews, Mondale was bidding
gamely to "win" the replays of a debate that most
observers, media commentary and overnight polls

had judged a draw. For a candidate so far down in
the polls with just two weeks to go, a draw was not
good enough.
Mondale's strategists conceded yesterday that
they will get no immediate momentum shift from
the televised foreign-policy exchange, but Mondale
campaign chairman James Johnson vowed that
"last night's debate won't be over until Nov. 6."
He said Reagan's statements and misstatements
had provided ammunition for Mondale to focus the
final two weeks of the campaign on questions of
war and peace and on presidential competence..
Yesterday's attacks suggested how differently
the Mondale camp viewed this debate from the first
one. After the first presidential debate in Louisville
on Oct. 7, Mondale had the liberty of letting the

media carry the criticism of Reagan's shaky perfor
mance. Yesterday, it was his turn to lob the
broadsides.
Mondale warmed to the task with ridicule and in
dignation, and he attacked from the left and the
right. For example, on the Reagan proposal to
share advanced-weapons technology with the Rus
sians, Mondale said, "That's not my idea of
strength."
"We climbed the rock of strength last night,"
said Mondale's foreign-policy adviser, David
Aaron. "Now we can really focus on the nuclear is
sues."
