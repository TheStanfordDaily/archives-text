# ASSU backs South Africa referendum
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate called a special meeting for tonight, voted
to endorse a referendum on the University's investment policy
and talked with Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons at last
night's meeting.
The senate scheduled a special meeting for tonight in order
to decide whether a last-minute constitutional amendment
should be placed on next week's special election ballot.
The amendment would limit ASSU senators to three terms.
Senate bylaws necessitated the special meeting. According
to the bylaws, the senate must be given previous notice one
meeting before it votes to place constitutional amendments
before students.
But last night's meeting was the last scheduled meeting
before next week's elections and the first meeting at which the
amendment could be presented.
Tonight's meeting was precipitated by a ruling of Senate
Chair Eric Berg, who decided that Senator Jay Alter's attempt
to make last night's meeting into two meetings — by adjourn
ing and then reconvening the senate — was out of order.
Ten senators will be required tonight for a quorum, but Al
ter doubts that a quorum will be present. "I have even greater
doubts that there will be at least 14 senators present," he con
tinued. The amendment needs the approval of 14 senators to
be placed on the ballot.
Berg disagreed, saying that because the amendment is of
sufficient interest, "I'm sure there'll be a quorum."
Regarding the amendment's chances, Berg said he had "no
idea" whether senators would vote to place it on the ballot.
In other action, the senate endorsed the referendum on
"Establishing a Responsible University Investment Policy,"
which will be on next week's ballot.
Graduate Senator James McGrath argued that the senate
should not "be discussing international policy," but the senate
voted to endorse the referendum question on the basis that
Stanford should "carefully scrutinize the uses toward which its
resources are dedicated."
Concern has been expressed about the University's holdings
in companies that do business in South Africa, and specifically
about the 94,000 shares of Motorola Inc. held by Stanford.
Motorola has sold "equipment to South African military and
police which is then used in the violent suppression of political
freedom and expression," according to the bill endorsing the
referendum.
Lyons discussed current problems on campus with fraternal
organizations.
"A condition of distrust exists among fraternal organiza
tions, the administration and the faculty," he said in a question
and answer session.
In 1977, the University altered its policy so that new frater
nities and sororities could organize at Stanford, and the unex
pected boom in new fraternal organizations took the Univer
sity by surprise, he said.
The organization of sororities and black and Jewish fraterni
ties presented an "inequitable situation," since a shortage of
houses prevented them from receiving the same treatment as
the established fraternities.
"The equity issue absolutely cannot go away," he said, add
ing that the issue must be addressed in the next two or three
years.
To get the amendment limiting senators to three terms on
the ballot, Alter revealed in yesterday's Daily that he planned
to give previous notice on the amendment early in the meeting
and then adjourn. He then planned to call a new meeting five
minutes later and ask the senate to
place the amendment on the ballot.
His move was thwarted by Berg's
ruling. Prior to the meeting. Berg dis
tributed a special report of the chair
which pre-emptively ruled that Al
ter's action would be out of order.
The earliest a special meeting could
be called would be today, Berg said in
the ruling. The adjourn-reconvene

move would set a bad precedent, he
said.
Alter appealed Berg's ruling, main
taining that a quorum of senators
would not attend a special meeting,
but his appeal was defeated 10-6, and
the special meeting was called.
Students have turned in petitions
calling for a similar amendment to be
voted on by students.
If the senate does not put the
amendment on next week's ballot,
those students will call for another
special election winter quarter at a
cost of about $3,000, Alier said.
