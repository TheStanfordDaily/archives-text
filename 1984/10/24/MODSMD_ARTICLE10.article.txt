## Research vs. teaching... Stanford Med School aims for the best of both worlds 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
If competition among medical
schools for top-notch students were a
beauty contest, Stanford's reputation
in clinical training would be a
blemish.
The problem is so serious, in fact,
that a perception of inadequate op
portunities in clinical education —
learning how to take care of patients
— was one of the two reasons most
frequently cited by those that were
accepted but turned down Stanford's
offers of admission in 1983.
The students were surveyed by the
medical school's admissions office
after a record setting 235 admissions
offers had to be made to made to fill
the 86 spots in the 1983 freshman
class. Normally, between 160 and
170 offers are made.
Director of Admissions Raymond
Clayton says he is less concerned by
the high figure now than he was a
year ago because the number of ac
ceptances depends upon "how we
play the game" of admissions. He
also points out that this year the fig
ure was down to 190 offers.
Nevertheless, Clayton and other
medical school administrators and
faculty say they recognize the serious
ness of the problem and have begun
taking steps to improve Stanford's
national image.
Measures are also being taken to
improve the quality of the clinical
training program itself, although
many students, faculty members and
administrators contend that the pro
gram is already of high quality, and
that the school is suffering unjustly
from "bad press."
Ironically, these people say, it is
Stanford's reputation as one of the
leaders in medical research which has
led to its poor clinical reputation.
This belief is evidenced by statements
such as the following, which was writ
ten by a respondent to the 1983 ques
tionnaire:
"Stanford's commitment to excel
lence, especially in research and
academics, was highly attractive," the
student wrote. "I was disappointed,
though, in what seemed to me a ne
glect in the training of basic clinical
skills as a groundwork for a career in
medicine. Stanford's reputation as
highly 'research oriented' dis
couraged me somewhat."
The applicant chose to attend the
University of Pennsylvania.
Both at the opening of the medical
school on campus in 1959 and the sil
ver anniversary ceremonies just over
a week ago, school authorities af
firmed the medical center's commit
ment to what is known as the triad of
medicine — patient care, teaching,

and research.
But the emphasis from 1959 on has
clearly been on research. Stanford
has set the pace of research in many
fields, including biochemistry, cancer
biology, genetic engineering, im
munology and cardiovascular sur
gery. In 1982-83 alone, 270 faculty
members received 479 grant awards
for research totaling more than $68
million.
The school actively encourages stu
dents to take advantage of the re
search opportunities. Students are
urged to take at least five years to get
their degrees, and Stanford's unusual
policies of charging only a nominal
fee for any studies beyond the thir
teenth quarter and helping students
get pay for their research work enable
many students to participate in basic
science and clinical research.
This year, the school graduated
only 66 students, the smallest number
in a decade. The vast majority of their
classmates stayed on to do research.
Also this year, the school inserted a
core of basic science requirements
into what had previously been an
elective curriculum. While controver
sial among students, the requirements
allay the concerns of many faculty
members that a few students were
unwisely missing out on what the fac
ulty considers to be an essential part
of a medical education.
"I think the reason this (basic sci
ence requirements) has been an issue
at all is that this school, at least since
1959, has really emphasized re
search," says first-year student
Laurel McClure. "They (the faculty)
see their mission as preparing people
to go into academic medicine."
Indeed, a study of last year's medi
cal school graduates reflects this em
phasis.
The study, conducted by the Amer
ican Association of Medical Colleges
(AAMC), evidences key differences
in orientation between Stanford
graduates and graduates from the na
tion's medical schools in general.
When comparing the career goals
of the two groups, the differences are
significant. Nationwide, the top
choice is clinical practice, the career
plan of 75 percent of the students res
ponding to the survey, compared with
39 percent of Stanford's graduates.
And 59 percent of Stanford's M.D.s
planned to pursue careers in aca
demic medicine, as opposed to only
23 percent of the nation's graduates.
John Steward, associate dean of
student affairs, points out that in ac
tuality, many students end up chang
ing their minds and only about 15
percent of every Stanford graduating
class go on to pursue careers in aca
demic medicine.

When it comes to investigational
experience in research and expected
research involvement, medical stu
dents here also differ from the norm.
While 77 percent of Stanford's re
spondents reported having been in
vestigators in research projects and
41 percent said they expected to have
significant involvement in research
during their careers, the correspond
ing national figures were 37 and 13,
respectively.

Although many leaders at the
medical school are proud of these fig
ures and of the school's research em
phasis in general, the direction of the
school has long been a source of con
tention, particulary on the part of
clinical faculty — those involved with
direct patient care — who have at
times argued that their departments
and programs have suffered from a
skewed outlook on the part of those
at the helm.
"The question of what sort of
medical school Stanford should be
has been debated from the time we

arrived from San Francisco in 1959,"
according to Clayton. "It's still being
debated and I guess it always will be."
One of the 40 students of the medi
cal school's admissions panel, who
asked not to be identified, said that
three to four years ago there was even
"a group of people who really wanted
to dismantle the clinical program at
Stanford" and who "did try very hard
to destroy clinical training at Stan
ford."

While school administrators deny
that this was the case, they concede
that the idea of turning Stanford into
purely a research institution and
limiting the class to a small number of
carefully selected individuals has
been raised in faculty discussions.
Today, however, such suggestions
are rarely made. The flow of millions
of research dollars, which the federal
government pumped into institutions
like Stanford in the 1960s and early
19705, has slowed down con
siderably, and other economic and
social conditions are affecting the

soul-searching process at the medical
school.
Indeed, with regard to its emphasis,
the school appears to be at a cross
roads.
"The philosophy of the school was
perfectly appropriate (in the 1960s
and early 1970s): Try to train as many
physicians as possible to be research
ers," Clayton says. However, re
search positions are much more diffi
cult to secure today because of fun
ding problems, and students are
seeking a more balanced medical
education. "Re-evaluation is being
forced on the school by economic cir
cumstances."
Clayton says that today's medical
school students are seeking a broader
education, in part because funding for
academic research is not as readily
available and academic posts are
harder to come by.
The selection of David Korn as the
new dean of the medical school ear
lier this month may be an indication
of the school's changing emphasis.
Korn is a noted clinician, researcher
and administrator who has chaired
the Pathology Department here since
1968.
Korn replaced Dominick Purpura,
who had earned international
reknown for his brain research before
becoming dean, and who resigned in
June to become dean at Albert
Einstein Medical College in New
York. Some say Purpura resigned un
der pressure from top officials in the
school, in part because he failed to
provide the leadership necessary to
halt faculty infighting and devoted
what some felt was too much atten
tion to research programs.
University President Donald Ken
nedy said during the search for the
new dean that the appointee would
be someone who has "a strong grasp
of the kinds of problems of an institu
tion like ours with primarily a re
search emphasis but the need to
maintain strong clinical programs as
well."
"I suspect that we're going to
retain our emphasis on basic science
and we're going to increase our atten
tion to clinical training," Stewart
says.
According to the student admis
sions panel member who asked to not
to be identified, "The medical school
is finally realizing that. .. whatever it
means to be an academic physician, it
(medical training) should never turn
into just a glorified Ph.D. program."
Many at the school are discovering,
however, that an institution's reputa
tion can be slower to change than the
institution itself.
Some administrators, faculty mem
bers and students attribute this prob

lem to a lack of emphasis on public
relations. "Stanford's taking a bad
rap might be our own fault," says
second-year student Tom Robinson,
"because we put too much emphasis
in the press on research and the clini
cal faculty don't get the kind of
recognition they should."
Steward concedes that administra
tors may have been lax when it comes
to Stanford's image in this area. "If
people have thought we were not as
strong clinically as many schools,
we've just let them think that, and
maybe that's been a mistake," he
says.
Both Steward and Clayton point
out that strengthening Stanford's
image in clinical training is high on
the school's agenda.
Some of Clayton's efforts in this
vein since he assumed his post last
year have focused on convincing ap
plicants of Stanford's devotion to
clinical medicine and training. The
Admissions Committee has made
changes in the material sent to appli
cants so that it gives greater emphasis
to clinical experience.
"We tried to emphasize the fact
that when we were asking about
scholarly experience, we were not
emphasizing just basic research,"
Clayton says."The implication that
people have read into it was that we
were mostly interested in basic re
search."
He adds that this is the first year
that members of the committee have
written "breadth of education" on
the form they use when evaluating
applicants.
Also, because medical school can
didates inevitably raise concerns
about the clinical training at Stanford,
Clayton says that "this year we have
gone out of our way to see that
clinical-year students (those beyond
their third year in medical school) will
conduct the interviews and also that
they are trained to do it."
Clayton is also in the process of
rewriting the school's brochure, and
he says the clinical programs will
receive due emphasis.
"We are trying to give a more real
istic view of the school and what it has
to offer students," Clayton said.
This "realistic view" is based in
part on substantive changes under
way in the clinical training program.
These changes are being made "in
part because we haven't given it
(clinical training) as much attention
as we might have," Steward says,
pointing out that, "our requirements

for clinical work have been con
siderably less than most schools."
Steward says that because Stanford
medical students on the average
receive less clinical training than at
most schools, the Committee on
Courses and Curriculum is consider
ing increasing the requirements to
beyond the five clerkships in
medicine, obstetrics and gynecology,
pediatrics, psychiatry and surgery.
These clerkships have been manda
tory since 1980.
The committee also has plans un
derway to introduce an intensive
clinical training course this spring,
which Associate Dean of Medical
Education Robert Cutler says will
replace what has been "an ad hoc ar
rangement" with physical diagnostic

experience gained in doctors' offices.
The course will involve 40 hours a
week to he divided between "didactic
teaching in the morning and bedside
teaching in the afternoons."
Cutler adds that the clinical depart
ments are working to improve train
ing on their own. He points especially
to the Medical Education Committee
in the Department of Medicine,
which is currently considering a pro
gram of rotations through the Stan
ford Medical Center or Veterans Ad
ministration Medical Center in Palo
Alto for four weeks and the Santa
Clara Medical Center in San Jose or
the Kaiser-Permanente Hospital in
Santa Clara for another four. Cutler
says the purpose of the program
would be to expose students to "a
wide range of medical problems be
cause of the different patient popula
tions at the different hospitals." Cur
rently, the students choose between a
full-time rotation at Stanford, the VA

or both, and a rotation in Santa Clara,
the Kaiser hospital or both.
But faculty members and adminis
trators are quick to point out that stu
dents do not graduate from the medi
cal school ill-prepared for clinical
work.
A study by the Office of Student
Affairs, which surveyed recent
graduates of the medical school,
found that 91 percent of the respon
dents felt they were adequately
prepared for the internships they en
tered after graduating from Stanford.
Of the Stanford students respond
ing to the 1984 AAMC study, two
thirds felt that the amount of time
devoted to the clinical sciences had
been appropriate, while the remain
ing third deemed it inadequate.
One fourth-year student who asked
not to be identified describes his clini
cal education so far as "spotty," but
says that he doubts his training would
be any different at any of the other

top medical schools because of
similar systems for faculty evaluation.
"The criterion for staying at any insti
tution is good research. You can be a
really horrible teacher but be a won
derful researcher and get tenure, yet
part of your responsibility will be to
teach," he says.
But second-year student Jim Rawn
says that his observations and discus
sion with other students have led him
to expect good clinical training. Rawn
notes that although Stanford is
primarily a tertiary center with a
high-technology emphasis, students
also have the opportunity to work in
different environments because the
University has four major affiliated
teaching hospitals which offer expo
sure to different patient populations
with a variety of health-care prob
lems.
Rawn says that in talking to
physicians at Columbia University
and other institutions when he was

applying to medical schools, he per
ceived the feeling that Stanford did
not offer the same quaiity of clinical
experience as schools located in
major cities.
"The sheer volume of cases and
chronic understaffing that's often
touted as a benefit puts students on
the firing line right away instead of
using physicians and residents as a
shield," Rawn says. "I'm sure that's a
different environment, but we don't
do all our clinical work here. If we
want to get down in the trenches, I
think that opportunity is available."
Even with improvements in clinical
training programs, Stanford's struggle
to attract top students may be far
from over. Another major concern
among applicants is the cost of a
medical education. At a cost of
$3,808 a quarter, Stanford keeps
pace with other top, private medical
schools.

Seventy-five percent of those res
ponding to the admissions office
study cited cost as a reason for select
ing other schools, and 42 percent of
the respondents went to lower-priced
schools in the University of California
system. The tuition at the University
of California, San Francisco is $479
per quarter for state residents and
$1,659 for non-residents.
In addition, the mean total in
debtedness of all Stanford graduates
surveyed in 1984 by the AAMC was
$27,000. The figure for all schools
was $23,000.
Clayton says the national trend is
shifting toward more merit scholar
ships, as opposed to the uniquely
need-based grants awarded by Stan
ford. Both he and Steward maintain
that discussion of creating non-need
based grants has taken place, but as
yet no actions have been taken on
these suggestions.
