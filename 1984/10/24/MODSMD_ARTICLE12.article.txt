"This office does not believe in prohibition."
That's what Alice Supton, the assistant dean of
student affairs for Residential Education, told
The Daily last September, when Res Ed began to
encourage resident assistants to "de-emphasize
drinking alcohol at orientation parties and at all
parties during the year."
And earlier this month, just after Res Ed
finished an almost alcohol-free freshman orienta
tion, complete with Res Ed officials policing the
frosh street dance, Supton said pretty much the
same thing.
"To prohibit the use of alcohol would be to
remove the choice for people," she told The
Daily. "We don't feel its our job or province to
dictate to people."
Sometimes it's pretty hard to believe what you
hear.
In the past, Res Ed has resorted to some pretty
inane tactics to limit student drinking, including
an effort to change the nomenclature of Stanford
parties from "Happy Hours" and "Daquiri par
ties" to "Fridays at Five" and "Blender Smoothie
Study Breaks."
But now Res Ed is getting tougher. Tougher,
but not smarter.
Res Ed has distributed alcohol-incident forms
to resident assistants in order to find out more

about "how students use and abuse alcohol."
There's nothing wrong with Res Ed's wanting
to know about alcohol-caused fights or van
dalism, but these forms go further than that. Res
Ed wants RAs to report every single alcohol
related incident they see, including students who
are "mildly intoxicated," "playing drinking
games" or suffering from hangovers.
Earlier this month Supton pointed to the need
to "try to help people with [an alcohol problem]
to face up to the problem and help them get rid of
that."
That's an admirable goal, but to put RAs in the
role of party police, making sure Johnny and
Suzy don't get "mildly intoxicated," is a sure way
to fail. Student problems can best be solved in an
atmosphere of mutual trust, something this
reporting system destroys.
In addition, there are questions as to exactly
how Res Ed is going to use the information it
garners in this survey. It's not hard to imagine the
information being used as ammunition in a battle
to ban alcohol from campus.
In the meantime, Res Ed tells us each year that
the University has no interest in prohibition. And
every year the alcohol policies get a little stricter.
It's enough to drive a person to drink.
