# Nuclear overdose

Nuclear war is bad. Nuclear war scares the hell
out of us. What can we do about nuclear war?
These thoughts are firmly entrenched in the
consciousness of our generation. Yet as a result of
their repeated use and the intense feelings of
hopelessness and frustration they represent,
these thoughts have been rendered essentially
meaningless.
A little over a week ago Brown University stu
dents made a statement that seems to hit home.
Their vote, in a non-binding referendum calling
on the university to stockpile cyanide pills for use
by students in case of nuclear attack, attracted
extensive national media coverage and forced

many people to think of the concrete ramifica
tions of an international situation we perhaps
don't take seriously enough.
The referendum was an extremely effective
statement and helped raise the issue of the
destructive capability of an all-out war. We un
derstand, however, why the Brown administra
tion can't stock the pills â€” and probably
shouldn't.
A sponsor of the referendum said "It's the
mark of a sick society when we have to think of
suicide." It's the mark of a sick society when we,
as a generation, have to contemplate and deal
with the prospects of a nuclear exchange.
