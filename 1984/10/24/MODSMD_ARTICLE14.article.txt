## Carnoy was 'out-Mondaled' 
### 
On Wednesday evening, I had the
pleasure of attending the discussions
on nuclear weapons and national se
curity between Congressman Ed
Zschau and Professor Martin Carnoy
at Stanford. As a stranger to local
California politics, I entered Kresge
Auditorium expecting to hear a
preview of the Mondale-Reagan

VIEWPOINT

foreign policy debate. Instead, I saw
the two candidates engage in a Walter
Mondale lookalike contest. In my
view, Zschau won. Carnoy came
across more like Gary Hart.
This is not meant as criticism of
either man. Both candidates were im
pressive. Each articulately expressed
his views on the issues and appeared
genuinely concerned about ending
the arms race and making the world a
safer place. But the fact remains that
on most matters, their differences
were in degree rather than in kind.
I sympathized with Carnoy. It was
no doubt difficult for him to debate
someone who started off by saying he
favors a nuclear freeze, opposes the
MX, endorses SALT II and wants to
see all past arms control agreements
ratified. Carnoy, in an attempt to
make things interesting, attempted to

debate President Reagan in absentia
rather than Zschau. For his part,
Zschau took great pains to keep
reminding Carnoy and the audience
of the differences between his views
and those of the present administra
tion. The evening was most in
formative, but I would hardly
characterize it as a substantial debate.
I must admit that I found myself in
general agreement with both candi
dates on most topics. However, their
stand on the nuclear freeze issue left
me a bit perplexed. Both professed to
be freeze proponents. Let me say at
the onset that I am not, although I do
see some benefit in Mondale's
moratorium proposal as a gesture
aimed at getting both sides back to
the negotiating table.
One of the major disadvantages of
the freeze concept, according to most
of its opponents, concerns the age
disparity between the strategic arsen
als of both sides. A freeze in the test
ing and production of new delivery
systems would leave the United
States at a disadvantage over time (if
not immediately), since our new sys
tems are still on the drawing boards
while the Soviet's are already in the
field. Many arms control advocates
therefore prefer a concept that would
reduce rather than freeze the number

of weapons while still allowing for
modernization of aging systems.
The candidates appeared to avoid
this problem by being in favor of both
the freeze and strategic moderniza
tion. Zschau appeared more strongly
in favor of modernization than Car
noy, although both supported the
"Midgetman" missile and a longer
range Trident missile. Carnoy drew
the line at introducing "first strike"
weapons rather than those with a de
fensive deterrent purpose (I must ad
mit that the distinction between the
two in large part escapes me). None
theless, both candidates acknowl
edged the need for some controlled
strategic modernization.
I strongly agree with both candi
dates that some form of
arms control agreement is long
overdue. I also believe that our secur
ity interests could be just as effec
tively served with a force that is
considerably smaller than the one
now in existence.
This leaves me with one basic ques
tion. Which arms control approach
does each candidate really support: a
drawdown which allows for moder
nization or an immediate nuclear
freeze? You can't have it both ways.
