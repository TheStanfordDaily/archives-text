## Big, bad Reagan 
### 
Once upon a time there was a little blond girl who lived
in the woods. She was a very good little girl. She knew
abortion was a crime, and she often dreamt about some
day marrying an upwardly mobile young business execu
tive and having babies for him. Her name was Little Red,
White and Blue Riding Hood.
One day, as she was skipping through the woods hum
ming "The Star Spangled Banner," a big old wolf jumped
out from behind a tree and startled her.
"Oh, my," said Little Red, White and Blue Riding
Hood. "You startled me. What do you want?"
"I want you to vote for me," said the big old wolf.
"Why would I vote for you?" she said. "You're a big
old wolf. Wolves can't hold office."
"They can if everybody votes for them," said the crafty
beast.
"Don't be silly. Now get out of my way. I'm carrying
this basket full of snack foods to my poor sick grand
mother." And with that, Little Red, White and Blue
Riding Hood pushed the wolf aside and trotted away.
But the wolf was not so easily put off. He took a short
cut to the grandmother's house, snuck in a window and
gobbled the old lady up. Then he put on the grand
mother's bonnet, lay down in her bed and waited for the
girl to arrive.
Of course. Little Red, White and Blue Riding Hood
wasn't fooled for a minute when she saw the waif. "You
again!!" she said. "Take off that bonnet. Where's my
grandma?"
"I gobbled her up," said the wolf, licking his chops.
Naturally, this news saddened Little Red, White and
Blue Riding Hood. She began to sniffle and cry.
"What's the matter, little girl?" asked the wolf.
"What's the matter?!!" yelled Little Red, White and
Blue Riding Hood. "What's the matter? Oh, nothing
much. You just ate my poor, sick grandmother and you
look about ready to eat me for dessert. That's all."
The wolf put a friendly paw on her shoulder. "Don't be
sad," he said. "Don't you see — I had to eat your

grandma. It's not like she tasted good or anything. But she
was a burden on the working people of this country. She
took and took, without giving anything back. What kind
of a life was she leading, anyway? And it's not all bad.
With her gone, that means less social security tax to be
taken out of your future husband's paycheck. Here,
look," the wolf said, handing Little Red, White and Blue
Riding Hood a rebate check from the IRS.
"Gee," said the girl with a final sniff. "I never thoug/if
of it that way."
The wolf smiled. "But that's not all. You don't under
stand what beautiful things I want for you." The wolf
turned out the lights and turned on a movie projector. He
showed Little Red, White and Blue Riding Hood a 20-
minute promo that depicted the world as it would be if
everyone voted for the wolf.
"My, what large stores of MX missiles you have," said
Little Red, White and Blue Riding Hood.
"All the better to protect you with, my dear. It's quite
simple. You see, the best way to cut down the number of
nuclear bombs in the world is to build more."
"Yes,' said the girl. "That makes sense. But what a
large deficit you have."
"A temporary side-effect of furthering your economic
gains, my dear. After all, your future husband will be the
senior vice president of a major corporation some day,
and he won t want to worry about being in a nasty tax
bracket, will he?"
"I guess not," said the girl. "8ut..."
"What, child?"
"Something else isn't quite right."
"What's that?"
Its... oh, never mind. I guess you're right."
Of course I am, honey. Of course I am. Now, let's eat
those snack foods."
Then everybody lived happily ever after, right?
