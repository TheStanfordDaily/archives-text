News that's fit
In the five years that I have been
reading and contributing to The
Daily, nothing has disappointed me
as profoundly as the announcement
in Greg Crossfield's article (The
Daily, Oct. 18) that the paper would
be beginning a series of what ap
peared from Thursday's article to be
puff pieces on "Stanford alumni who
have become successful in the world
of business."
It's a darn shame that The Daily
feels it has to rush to glorify business
at a time when intellectualism and
public service are nationally out of
fashion. It is particularly disturbing
to see this because it is The Daily
that is really the last bulwark against
the rising tide of anti-intellectualism
and pre-professional zombie-ism that
prompt many to refer to Stanford
disdainfully as "Hoover-Reagan
University."
There is nothing wrong with an
occasional story about a Stanford
alumnus who happens to be doing
well in industry. As a business school
student, I am among those least
likely to object.
There is something wrong,
however, with a series of articles that
will likely do no more than present
wealthy Stanford alumni as heroes
and role models for current students,
without ever asking whether these
alumni are using their Stanford
degrees for selfish interest or for
society, or whether Stanford's cur
rent curriculum and policies should
be changed in light of alumni experi
ences.

Fifteen years ago students would
have burned The Daily to the ground
for printing articles like last week's
piece on Peter Magowan, chairman
of Safeway.
Nowhere does the article explain
what Magowan has done to earn his
$500,000 salary (the equivalent of
three Nobel Prizes each year) or why
it is so astonishing and praiseworthy
for a white boy born as the grandson
of one of the wealthiest investment
bankers in the country and the son of
the chairman of the world's largest
grocery chain, to step into his
daddy's shoes at the age of 38, nine
years after his Daddy retired. Whom
did he beat out, and why?
Instead of presenting a series of
dubious role models, The Daily
ought to be examining the current
positions of Stanford alumni in order
to ask questions about whom Stan
ford ought to be admitting, the types
of careers and skills Stanford ought
to be training students for, and the
values the University ought to en
courage. Why are Stanford graduates
where they are today and what sort
of people does Stanford want to
graduate?
Let's not just blindly glorify our
alumni who happen to meet the
currently fashionable definition of
success. The alumni magazine has to
do that because Stanford needs to
solicit contributions from these
people.
The Stanford Daily does not, and
it ought to know better.

Walter Mondale's visit to Stanford
last Tuesday will most likely be one
of the biggest news events of the
year here. The rally planners care
fully staged the occasion, rain not
withstanding and rightly reserved
appropriate space in Memorial
Auditorium for the media. We
feel that some members of The Daily
staff may have abused their privilege.
As we squeezed toward the
auditorium along with everyone else,
someone passed us and worked
toward the front of the line by shout
ing "Press!" and flashing a press
pass. The pass belonged to Juliann
Anderson of The Stanford Daily,
and apparently it was she who held
the pass.
Unfortunately, we have yet to find
a story, opinion, or photograph on
the rally attributed to Anderson.
Why is it that she has nothing to say
about an event that it was so impor
tant for her (and not others) to see?
Perhaps Anderson is not specifi
cally guilty in this case, but we have
heard that there were a number of
people who used Daily press passes
just to gain entrance to the
auditorium. There is no reason that
the non-contributing members of
The Daily should have preference
over other members of the Stanford
community and The Daily should be
responsible enough to prevent this.

Right on the money
For a millenium or so, battle
weary professors, tenacious adminis
trators, and a few conscientious
peers have been telling Stanford
students to major in an academic
field in which they are truly inter
ested. In their efforts to cajole
hesitant students into choosing a
humanities major, they have merely
been invoking the motto of "Animal
House's" Faber College
("Knowledge is Good").
While admittedly this is a noble
idea, the message is unfortunately
hitting home to fewer and fewer
people. Why? An increasing
percentage of Stanford's population
is less interested in the inherent
worth of knowledge, and is more
excited about directly converting
academic formulas into financial
success. This group has generally
been overlooked or ignored by the
exasperated humanities proponents.
That is, up until now.
In his recent column "Liberal Arts
Degree Beneficial" (The Daily, Oct.
11), Jeffery Knowlton tackles the
"major" problem from both angles.
First, he urges students to " . . .
sample Stanford's delicious intellec
tual offerings." Implicit here is his
love of knowledge as an end in itself!
However, Knowlton does not stop
here. He goes on to prove that not
only is a liberal arts degree fun, it is
(gasp!) practical as well. Surely these
are terms to which any current stu
dent can relate!

trators, and a few conscientious
peers have been telling Stanford
students to major in an academic
field in which they are truly inter
ested. In their efforts to cajole
hesitant students into choosing a
humanities major, they have merely
been invoking the motto of "Animal
House's" Faber College
("Knowledge is Good").
While admittedly this is a noble
idea, the message is unfortunately
hitting home to fewer and fewer
people. Why? An increasing
percentage of Stanford's population
is less interested in the inherent
worth of knowledge, and is more
excited about directly converting
academic formulas into financial
success. This group has generally
been overlooked or ignored by the
exasperated humanities proponents.
That is, up until now.
In his recent column "Liberal Arts
Degree Beneficial" (The Daily, Oct.
11), Jeffery Knowlton tackles the
"major" problem from both angles.
First, he urges students to " . . .
sample Stanford's delicious intellec
tual offerings." Implicit here is his
love of knowledge as an end in itself!
However, Knowlton does not stop
here. He goes on to prove that not
only is a liberal arts degree fun, it is
(gasp!) practical as well. Surely these
are terms to which any current stu
dent can relate!

News that's fit
In the five years that I have been
reading and contributing to The
Daily, nothing has disappointed me
as profoundly as the announcement
in Greg Crossfield's article (The
Daily, Oct. 18) that the paper would
be beginning a series of what ap
peared from Thursday's article to be
puff pieces on "Stanford alumni who
have become successful in the world
of business."
It's a darn shame that The Daily
feels it has to rush to glorify business
at a time when intellectualism and
public service are nationally out of
fashion. It is particularly disturbing
to see this because it is The Daily
that is really the last bulwark against
the rising tide of anti-intellectualism
and pre-professional zombie-ism that
prompt many to refer to Stanford
disdainfully as "Hoover-Reagan
University."
There is nothing wrong with an
occasional story about a Stanford
alumnus who happens to be doing
well in industry. As a business school
student, I am among those least
likely to object.
There is something wrong,
however, with a series of articles that
will likely do no more than present
wealthy Stanford alumni as heroes
and role models for current students,
without ever asking whether these
alumni are using their Stanford
degrees for selfish interest or for
society, or whether Stanford's cur
rent curriculum and policies should
be changed in light of alumni experi
ences.

Fifteen years ago students would
have burned The Daily to the ground
for printing articles like last week's
piece on Peter Magowan, chairman
of Safeway.
Nowhere does the article explain
what Magowan has done to earn his
$500,000 salary (the equivalent of
three Nobel Prizes each year) or why
it is so astonishing and praiseworthy
for a white boy born as the grandson
of one of the wealthiest investment
bankers in the country and the son of
the chairman of the world's largest
grocery chain, to step into his
daddy's shoes at the age of 38, nine
years after his Daddy retired. Whom
did he beat out, and why?
Instead of presenting a series of
dubious role models, The Daily
ought to be examining the current
positions of Stanford alumni in order
to ask questions about whom Stan
ford ought to be admitting, the types
of careers and skills Stanford ought
to be training students for, and the
values the University ought to en
courage. Why are Stanford graduates
where they are today and what sort
of people does Stanford want to
graduate?
Let's not just blindly glorify our
alumni who happen to meet the
currently fashionable definition of
success. The alumni magazine has to
do that because Stanford needs to
solicit contributions from these
people.
The Stanford Daily does not, and
it ought to know better.

Press pass partiality
Walter Mondale's visit to Stanford
last Tuesday will most likely be one
of the biggest news events of the
year here. The rally planners care
fully staged the occasion, rain not
withstanding and rightly reserved
appropriate space in Memorial
Auditorium for the media. We
feel that some members of The Daily
staff may have abused their privilege.
As we squeezed toward the
auditorium along with everyone else,
someone passed us and worked
toward the front of the line by shout
ing "Press!" and flashing a press
pass. The pass belonged to Juliann
Anderson of The Stanford Daily,
and apparently it was she who held
the pass.
Unfortunately, we have yet to find
a story, opinion, or photograph on
the rally attributed to Anderson.
Why is it that she has nothing to say
about an event that it was so impor
tant for her (and not others) to see?
Perhaps Anderson is not specifi
cally guilty in this case, but we have
heard that there were a number of
people who used Daily press passes
just to gain entrance to the
auditorium. There is no reason that
the non-contributing members of
The Daily should have preference
over other members of the Stanford
community and The Daily should be
responsible enough to prevent this.
