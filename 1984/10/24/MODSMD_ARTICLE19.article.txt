## West side story... How does Governor's Corner compare? 
### DAN DELUCE 
Some call this school a "country club."
Nothing seems to provide better evidence
than Stanford's new housing — Governor's
corner, which includes Sterling Quad, the
Suites and the Independent Houses.
It lies between Santa Teresa Street and the
driving range, with houses arranged not in
rectangular formations but around oak trees
and grass lawns. Residents generally seem to
enjoy the new housing, though some say it is
isolated.
Sophomore Simone Genatt said she did not
feel isolated living in a suite. "It's like being in
a garden apartment and being a block away
from campus."
"It's luxury living," said junior Chris Fer
nandes, a Sterling Quad resident. "It's com
fortable . . . but it's also dull. People are more
concerned with studying than partying." Fer
nandes lived in Wilbur his freshman year, and
he said in Sterling, "There are more com
plaints about noise."
Sophomore Tim Quirk said he "couldn't
care less" about it being quieter in Sterling,
and that he liked "the nice, wood desks."
Sophomore Bart Manning, another Sterling
resident, said that the atmosphere of Sterling
Quad is one in which people tend to develop
cliques. "People keep their doors closed here,"
he said. "I always get this feeling like 1 wish
something was going on."
Junior Erik Hokanson echoed Manning's
observations about Sterling Quad. "People
tend to go their own ways here," he said. He
described Serra Hall, where he lived as a soph
omore, as a place where "people were unified
because we all complained together. There
was a cohesiveness . . . maybe because it was
50 percent freshmen."
Norm Robinson, head of Residential Edu
cation, said he didn't know whether freshmen
would ever live in the new housing.
"These kind of decisions change from year
to year," Robinson said. "It's an easy thing to
do once you decide." He ruled out putting

freshmen in the Suites, which he said are
"good for upperclassmen."
"The freshmen are well-served by other
places right now," said Robinson. He said
that putting freshmen in Governor's Corner
would not be considered for the next few
years.
Many students said it was easier to study in

the new housing. "I rarely go to the library,
except for reserved reading," said junior
Suites resident Tanya Rutledge.
But others don't go to the library, or
other places on campus, because it takes
too long.
"Classes and fraternities are far away," said
sophomore Indra Sehdev, who lived in Roble

last year. Suite resident sophomore Rick
Ricketts also said the distance was incon
venient. "Getting to campus is a pain in the
ass," he said.
According to Robinson, Governor's Corner
has helped to alleviate the housing crunch
here. "It's given us more housing; fewer
people live off-campus," he said.

He also said the Elliot Program Center and
the Sterling Quad dining room fulfill impor
tant needs. "It's not just that the spaces arc
attractive, but very useful, he said.
The development of Governor's Corner,
Robinson said, began with a need for more
housing. A housing study in 1974 resulted in
additions to Florence Moore, to three Row
houses and then to the construction of Gover
nor's Corner. This project allowed for more
graduate student housing in Manzanita Park.
The new housing cost approximately $34
million, according to Robinson. "When you
compare the space in constant dollars to other
campus housing costs, it actually falls in the
middle."
"We wanted to capitalize on what's best at
Stanford," he said. Robinson was the head of
a committee that had to come up with the
proper objectives lor the new housing.
He said they had three goals: to create "a
neighborhood not a monolith;" to offer diver
sity by "providing residential options"; and
"to try some things we hadn't tried before."
Lagunita Court and the Robert Moore Row
Houses served as models for Sterling Quad.
The committee. Robinson said, took the ad
vice of resident fellows — who viewed 90
people as "the limit in terms of getting to
know people" — and ot students who liked
Lagunita Court.
"Hence, the large dining room in Sterling,"
he said. "It (the dining room) gives a sense
that you belong to a larger hall, which helps to
break down territorial, attitudinal barriers
that often develop."
He said they also wanted to use the dining
room in ways that Lagunita's is used — for
performances, speeches and concerts. But he
noted that Lagunita's dining room does not
work as well as it could have because of its
length.
Robinson is pleased with the Sterling
Dining Room. "It's functional — it's a dining
room first and foremost. And it's a particulary
handsome space. The architects did a mag

nificent job in the use of light and wood."
In planning the Suites, the committee
combined the aspects of Manzanita that stu
dents liked — privacy, a living room and a
place to entertain — with eating clubs like
those in Toyon.
"It takes time for things like this to work,"
Robinson said of the eating clubs. He said
that the eating clubs in the Suites — called
Pining Societies — were incorporated into
the plan to prevent the isolation that students
can experience in Manzanita.
Another objective in Governor's Corner,
Robinson said, was "to have a variety of
rooms." As a result there are one room
doubles and triples with varying designs.
"We wanted students to live in a place that
was comfortable, but still architecturally in
teresting."
The Elliot Program Center was designed to
provide some spaces that "would normally be
in houses he said.
Elliot contains a darkroom, music practice
rooms, a project room, a large room that can
be used for dances, concerts or parties, a
smaller room for seminars or meetings and a
small lounge for computers.
"It allows us to do things we did before, but
didn't have the proper facilities for," Robin
son said.
But what about the students who drew into
the older housing? Many claim it's more ac
tive where they are.
"There are a lot of freshmen," said junior

Dawn Maeda, who is in Twain for her second
year in a row. "And the freshmen are fun."
There are more things going on here," she
continued. But Maeda admitted, "When 1 go
over there (to Sterling Quad), I get envious
sometimes."
Sophomore John Dearborn, a Soto resi
dent, said, "It's lively. This place doesn't go to
sleep until 2 a.m. Maybe it's a tradeoff. It's
certainly not as isolated."
Some residents of the "old" side of campus
said that the conditions cause people to be

more sociable. "People try to make living
here more fun because they know it's not as
nice," said sophomore Paul Choi of Wilbur
Hall. "You get to know people," he said.
There are complaints about the older
housing, though.
"They could upgrade the desks. They could
do things to each room to make the overall
quality better," said sophomore Fritz Stewart,
who lives in Wilbur.
Robinson, in reference to upgrading the
older housing, said, "Clearly, that's something

all of us are mindful of. Now we've got to
solve some of the problems that we dealt with
in Governor's Corner and Sterling."
He said students in Wilbur and Stern last
spring voiced their desire for coed floors.
The bathroom on the third floor of Trancos
in Wilbur was converted to coed at a cost of
$60,000.
According to the dean, coed halls will be
created in other dorms. "It's a matter of get
ting the money."
Robinson is aware of the criticism of the
disparity in campus housing. "I understand
people's displeasure," he said. "At any given
time, when you have something new, not
everyone gets to live there. There's a little bit
of the temporal element here."
As to graduate student criticism of being
left out of the new housing, Robinson
said, "Our biggest need for graduate student
housing is the single graduate student. That's
the population we haven't designed for in the
past."
"We need more spaces for graduate stu
dents, and we need better spaces for graduate
students," he said.
Is the new housing a "country club" that is
just too nice?
"We didn't want to build something that's
not nice. People say it looks so new," said
Robinson, "but we're not going to build
something that looks 40 years old."
On that everyone can agree — it certainly
doesn't look 40 years old.
