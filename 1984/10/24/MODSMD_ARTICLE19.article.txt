## West side story... How does Governor's Corner compare? 
### DAN DELUCE 
Some call this school a "country club."
Nothing seems to provide better evidence
than Stanford's new housing — Governor's
corner, which includes Sterling Quad, the
Suites and the Independent Houses.
It lies between Santa Teresa Street and the
driving range, with houses arranged not in
rectangular formations but around oak trees
and grass lawns. Residents generally seem to
enjoy the new housing, though some say it is
isolated.
Sophomore Simone Genatt said she did not
feel isolated living in a suite. "It's like being in
a garden apartment and being a block away
from campus."
"It's luxury living," said junior Chris Fer
nandes, a Sterling Quad resident. "It's com
fortable . . . but it's also dull. People are more
concerned with studying than partying." Fer
nandes lived in Wilbur his freshman year, and
he said in Sterling, "There are more com
plaints about noise."
Sophomore Tim Quirk said he "couldn't
care less" about it being quieter in Sterling,
and that he liked "the nice, wood desks."
Sophomore Bart Manning, another Sterling
resident, said that the atmosphere of Sterling
Quad is one in which people tend to develop
cliques. "People keep their doors closed here,"
he said. "I always get this feeling like 1 wish
something was going on."
Junior Erik Hokanson echoed Manning's
observations about Sterling Quad. "People
tend to go their own ways here," he said. He
described Serra Hall, where he lived as a soph
omore, as a place where "people were unified
because we all complained together. There
was a cohesiveness . . . maybe because it was
50 percent freshmen."
Norm Robinson, head of Residential Edu
cation, said he didn't know whether freshmen
would ever live in the new housing.
"These kind of decisions change from year
to year," Robinson said. "It's an easy thing to
do once you decide." He ruled out putting

freshmen in the Suites, which he said are
"good for upperclassmen."
"The freshmen are well-served by other
places right now," said Robinson. He said
that putting freshmen in Governor's Corner
would not be considered for the next few
years.
Many students said it was easier to study in

the new housing. "I rarely go to the library,
except for reserved reading," said junior
Suites resident Tanya Rutledge.
But others don't go to the library, or
other places on campus, because it takes
too long.
"Classes and fraternities are far away," said
sophomore Indra Sehdev, who lived in Roble

last year. Suite resident sophomore Rick
Ricketts also said the distance was incon
venient. "Getting to campus is a pain in the
ass," he said.
According to Robinson, Governor's Corner
has helped to alleviate the housing crunch
here. "It's given us more housing; fewer
people live off-campus," he said.

He also said the Elliot Program Center and
the Sterling Quad dining room fulfill impor
tant needs. "It's not just that the spaces arc
attractive, but very useful, he said.
The development of Governor's Corner,
Robinson said, began with a need for more
housing. A housing study in 1974 resulted in
additions to Florence Moore, to three Row
houses and then to the construction of Gover
nor's Corner. This project allowed for more
graduate student housing in Manzanita Park.
The new housing cost approximately $34
million, according to Robinson. "When you
compare the space in constant dollars to other
campus housing costs, it actually falls in the
middle."
"We wanted to capitalize on what's best at
Stanford," he said. Robinson was the head of
a committee that had to come up with the
proper objectives lor the new housing.
He said they had three goals: to create "a
neighborhood not a monolith;" to offer diver
sity by "providing residential options"; and
"to try some things we hadn't tried before."
Lagunita Court and the Robert Moore Row
Houses served as models for Sterling Quad.
The committee. Robinson said, took the ad
vice of resident fellows — who viewed 90
people as "the limit in terms of getting to
know people" — and ot students who liked
Lagunita Court.
"Hence, the large dining room in Sterling,"
he said. "It (the dining room) gives a sense
that you belong to a larger hall, which helps to
break down territorial, attitudinal barriers
that often develop."
He said they also wanted to use the dining
room in ways that Lagunita's is used — for
performances, speeches and concerts. But he
noted that Lagunita's dining room does not
work as well as it could have because of its
length.
Robinson is pleased with the Sterling
Dining Room. "It's functional — it's a dining
room first and foremost. And it's a particulary
handsome space. The architects did a mag

everything. Some claim that the newness of Sterling Quad
causes a "cold" atmosphere, while Wilbur and Stern are more
friendly places to live.
