## Chinese sweep volleyball team 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team was overpowered by
China's Zhe Xiang club team, 15-
1, 15-5, 15-6, in last night's ex
hibition match at Maples Pavilion.
An estimated crowd of 1,000
saw the Cardinal play the Chinese
in what turned out to be a one
sided match. Stanford, ranked in
this week's Tachikara poll as the
top collegiate volleyball team in
the nation for the first time, was
matched with a physically
dominating Chinese squad.
"The Chinese are so much
quicker," Stanford Asst. Coach
Don Shaw said. "They are all good
athletes, in fact, they're all one in a
million athletes. Ten million
people play volleyball in China,
and these players represent the
best of those volleyball players."
In three tour matches, the
Chinese have defeated the Uni
versity of Washington, the Univer
sity of Oregon, and Portland State
University. According to Shaw,
the match against the Cardinal was
an important one for the Chinese.
"This was the match of the tour
for them," he said. "This was the
one they came over to play. They
were ready to give us a good
match and to play really well."
The Chinese did give the Car
dinal difficulty, dominating the

match with hard serves and consis
tent blocking. Stanford passers
had difficulty with the flat, floating
serves of the Chinese. "Their
serves are perfect floaters. They
come over really quickly and drop
fast," Shaw said.
In the first game, the Cardinal
coaches put in only two of the reg
ular starting rotation, setters
Deidra Dvorak and Wendi Rush.
The Chinese quickly went ahead,
14-0, before Stanford got its point
on a crosscourt spike by Rush.
Stanford's entire starting rota
tion played in the second game to
put offensive pressure on China.
Hitter/middleblocker Kim Oden.
who was named the Western Col
legiate Athletic Association's Ath
lete of the Week on Monday, hit
consistently. The Cardinal also
was able to score on hits off blocks
by the Chinese.
Stanford took its largest lead of
the match, 4-0, in the third game.
Teresa Smith, a freshman from
Playa del Rey, came in and hit ag
gressively for the Cardinal, scoring
three of Stanford's six points.
The outcome of the match was
no surprise to Shaw. "You can
compare this match to a good col
legiate basketball team going over
to China, or some other country,
to play on tour. It would be no
match for the American team."
