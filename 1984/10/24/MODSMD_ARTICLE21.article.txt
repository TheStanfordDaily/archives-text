# 'Mystique' continues
## Men's soccer team defeated 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
The University of San Francisco
soccer team visited Stanford yester
day and came away with a 4-0 victory
over the CardinaJ men.
The Dons scored a pair of goals in
each half, and USF goalkeeper Mark
Powell recorded his second shutout of
this season. USF is 2-0 in Pacific Soc
cer Conference play and 7-4-2 over
all. Stanford fell to 8-6-3 and 3-2 in
the PSC.
USF opened the scoring after 16
minutes when forward Thierry Blan
son made a run down the right side of
the field and beat Cardinal
goalkeeper Willy Burkhardt from
close range. Blanson scored again a
minute later, heading a long cross
past Burkhardt at the far post.
Stanford seemed to take control of
the first 25 minutes of the second half
and threatened to score many times.
But Marshall Monroe missed two
headers, both of which went inches
over the bar, and one near score was
saved off the goal line by USF
defenders.
The Dons put the game out of
reach with 15 minutes remaining
when USF midfielder Ken
Boardman, who was left unguarded,
volleyed a lazy cross past Burkhardt
from five yards out for what proved
to be an insurmountable 3-0 lead.
About five minutes later, Steven

Torkensen beat two Stanford
defenders with a shot after a wild
scramble in front of the net during
which USF had four shots on goal and
Burkhardt had two diving saves.
Stephen Negoesco, in his 23rd year
as USFs head coach, said he was
pleased with the victory. "I feel we
played well today, except for a few
defensive lapses," Negoesco said.
USF, traditionally one of the top
teams in the country, seems to be
having a down year, but Negoesco
said, "Our talent is just as good as it
has been in the past. We've just had
some bad luck and off-games against
tough opponents."
Stanford senior forward Giancarlo
Ferruzzi could not explain USF's
dominance over the Cardinal, which
has not beaten the Dons during Fer
ruzzi's four years here. "It's some
kind of mystique," he said. "I don't
know what it is about USF. I really
thought we could beat them on the
field, but it's 'beat USF, beat USF
rather than concentrating on fun
damentals and playing good soccer."
The Cardinal has allowed 28 goals
in 17 games while scoring 25.
Burkhardt's goals-against average is
1.64, with four shutouts this season.
Stanford's next game is Tuesday
when it travels to Fresno to play
Fresno Pacific College. The Cardinal
returns home Nov. 7 to meet Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo.
