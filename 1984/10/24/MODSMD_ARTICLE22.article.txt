# OSU hoping to post another victory over Card

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Oregon State beat Stanford, 31-18,
last year in football. Big deal, huh?
For Stanford, as place kicker Mark
Harmon said, "Everything was going
bad for us last year and that (loss) was
just one more thing."
For Oregon State, however, it was
a big deal. It was the Beavers first
Pacific 10 Conference victory in
nearly four years and 30 straight con
ference games.
Naturally, Oregon State fans, par
ticularly the students, went wild. As
the final seconds ticked off the clock,
students rushed onto the field at
40,000-seat Parker Stadium. They
tore down a goalpost, carried it to the
top of the stadium, tossed it over the
edge, then paraded with it to the
Memorial Union quadrangle, almost

a mile away.
"Like most places, you don't have
adequate security to stop such a
rush," Oregon State Asst. Athletic
Director Hal Cowan said. "I imagine
the students were pretty sauced up.
And once you get something like that
going, it's hard to stop."
Tearing down a metal goalpost em
bedded in cement is also hard — and
expensive. "It cost us $5,000 to
replace," Cowan said. "So it wasn't
that funny as far as we (in the Ath
letic Department) were concerned."
While the Oregon State students
were celebrating something they
hadn't been able to celebrate for four
years, the Stanford football players
were sitting in the locker room. A
very quiet locker room.
"When we were in the locker
room, everyone was so quiet that you

could hear them in the adjacent
locker room going crazy," quarter
back John Paye said. "After the game
(former) Coach (Paul) Wiggin didn't
have much to say. The silence kind of
spoke for itself."
Cornerback Eric Price remembers
that silence even more vividly. "You
could feel this cloud of shame hover
ing over us," he said. "You could
even feel it on the plane home."
Although Stanford's 49-42 loss to
Washington State Saturday, after the
Cardinal led 35-7 and 42-14, ranks
high in terms of humiliating defeats,
many Stanford players say the loss on
that cold October afternoon in Cor
vallis, Ore., was worse.
"In humiliation, yes, it was the
worst (since I've been here)," Paye
said. "We were just asking ourselves,
'Why did it have to be us to break

their string of consecutive losses?' "
Actually, Oregon State didn't lose
30 straight Pac-10 games, it just
didn't win one. The Beavers tied
Washington State University, 14-14,
in 1982. But, as the saying goes, a tie
.is like kissing your sister.
Although Oregon State Coach Joe
Avezzano hesitated to call it the big
gest victory in his five years at
Oregon State, he tried to rank its im
portance. "Our Stanford win last year
certainly had to be the biggest in the
Pac-10 because it was our only one,"
he said.
"It was our first Pac-10 win we had
in too long a time at this school. It
also showed that the gap (between
Oregon State and the rest of the Pac
-10) was closing. When you started
where we did, you look for any little
thing as a positive."

Since then, the Beavers, 2-5 overall
and 1-3 in the Pac-10, have added
another conference victory to their
record — a 9-6 triumph at home over
the University of California at
Berkeley Oct. 13. This time,
however, no goalposts were torn
down.
That might be because the Oregon
State Athletic Department is taking
more precautions against financing
another goalpost-leveling party.
Terry Davis, a photography editor at
the (Oregon State) Daily Barometer,
said the goalposts are greased so stu
dents can't climb them and tear them
down again.
"Now whenever we start to win,"
Davis said, "the students scream,
'Goalposts, goalposts.' "

worst (since I've been here)," Paye
said. "We were just asking ourselves,
'Why did it have to be us to break

their string of consecutive losses?' "
Actually, Oregon State didn't lose
30 straight Pac-10 games, it just
didn't win one. The Beavers tied
Washington State University, 14-14,
in 1982. But, as the saying goes, a tie
.is like kissing your sister.
Although Oregon State Coach Joe
Avezzano hesitated to call it the big
gest victory in his five years at
Oregon State, he tried to rank its im
portance. "Our Stanford win last year
certainly had to be the biggest in the
Pac-10 because it was our only one,"
he said.
"It was our first Pac-10 win we had
in too long a time at this school. It
also showed that the gap (between
Oregon State and the rest of the Pac
-10) was closing. When you started
where we did, you look for any little
thing as a positive."

Since then, the Beavers, 2-5 overall
and 1-3 in the Pac-10, have added
another conference victory to their
record — a 9-6 triumph at home over
the University of California at
Berkeley Oct. 13. This time,
however, no goalposts were torn
down.
That might be because the Oregon
State Athletic Department is taking
more precautions against financing
another goalpost-leveling party.
Terry Davis, a photography editor at
the (Oregon State) Daily Barometer,
said the goalposts are greased so stu
dents can't climb them and tear them
down again.
"Now whenever we start to win,"
Davis said, "the students scream,
'Goalposts, goalposts.' "
