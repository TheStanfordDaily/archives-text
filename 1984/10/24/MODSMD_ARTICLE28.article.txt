Thrw Stanford faculty win Mac Arthur Prize
Three Stanford experts in arms control, educa
tion and psychology have received five-year, tax
free fellowships totaling more than $200,000 each
from the John D. and Catherine T. Mac Arthur
Foundation of Chicago.
They are: Sidney Drell, 58, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and co
director of the Stanford Center for International
Security and Arms Control; Shirley Heath, 45, as
sociate professor of education and well-known spe
cialist in cultural and social determinants of lan
guage acquisition and use, especially in school; and
Amos Twersky, 47, professor of psychology and an
expert in human decision-making.
The Stanford trio was among 25 winners nation
ally.
Stanford now has eight Mac Arthur prizewinners
on its faculty. Previous recipients here include
Profs. Alexander George, political science; William
Durham, anthropology; Charles Bigelow, com
puter science and art; and Bradley Efron and Persi
Diaconis, both statistics.
Family offers $5 million for mental illness research
The Pritzker family of Chicago has presented a
$5 million challenge gift to the Stanford School of
Medicine to support research on the biochemistry
of mental illness, the medical center announced
yesterday.
The gift is the first given to Stanford to endow a
research laboratory, said Jack Barchas, professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences.
The funds will support the research program of
the Nancy Pritzker Laboratory of Behavioral
Neurochemistry, headed by Barchas. The gift will
also seed a medical school drive to raise an added
$15 million to support other programs and capital
projects in the psychiatry department.
"Our gift should enable Stanford to encourage
other donors to participate in improving the finan
cial stability necessary for effective teaching and re
search in the Department of Psychiatry at Stanford,
already known worldwide for its excellence," said
Jay Pritzker, who announced the gift recently for
his family.
"This splendid endowment helps a crucial area of
mental health research, and gives other donors a
powerful incentive to support a psychiatry depart
ment that is outstanding in its commitment to
studies of biological and psychosocial factors in se
vere mental illness of adults and children," said
University President Donald Kennedy in ack
nowledging the gift.

Researchers describe unusual heart pauses
A small number of people whose hearts periodi
cally stop for more than two or three seconds
during sleep, and who complain of symptoms such
as lightheadedness or fainting, may be helped by
artificial pacemakers, reported Stanford scientists
in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Their findings are based on case reports of four
young, otherwise healthy adults, whose 24-hour
electrocardiogram readings nevertheless disclosed
up to 20 lapses in heart beat (asystole) of up to nine
seconds each during rapid eye movement sleep.
"Although we're describing what probably
amounts to a very unusual occurrence, we do know
that a small number of patients die suddenly from
bradycardia (slowed heart rate) or asystole â€”
though usually there's an underlying disease," said
Anne Gillis, a research fellow in cardiology and co
author of the study.
STAR-PAC makes $3,000 political donation
Stanford Students Against Reaganism (STAR
PAC), a student-run political action committee,
announced last Thursday that it would donate $500
to each of six democratic campaigns voted on by its

members.
STAR-PAC voted to split $3,000, raised
primarily from student contributions, among the
following democratic candidates: Stanford Educa
tion Prof. Martin Carnoy (12th District congres
sional race), San Mateo County Supervisor Arlen
Gregorio (11th District state senate contest), North
Carolina Governor James Hunt (U.S. Senate seat.
North Carolina), Lloyd Doggett (U.S. Senate seat,
Texas), lowa Congressman Tom Harkin (U.S. Sen
ate seat, Iowa) and Jerry Patterson (Southern Cali
fornia congressional seat).
A STAR-PAC press release listed the group's
criteria in selecting recipients. "The candidates
should be locked in close races where there is a
clear ideological difference between a Reagan
backer and a candidate who strongly supports civil
rights, a fairer domestic policy and a less militaristic
foreign policy.
Engineering Prof, named society fellow
James Johnston, professor of mechanical engi
neering here, has been named a fellow of the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME).
The fellow grade is conferred upon a member
who has had at least 10 years active engineering
practice and who has made significant contribu
tions to the field of engineering.
Johnston received bachelor's, master's and doc
toral degrees in mechanical engineering from MIT.
He joined the Stanford faculty in 1961 and
developed and taught undergraduate and graduate
courses in fluid dynamics. His current areas of in
terest include diffuser technology and radial flow
turbomachinery fluid dymanics.
Three graduate students win fellowships
Three first-year graduate students here have
received fellowships worth up to $4,500 from the
honor society of Phi Kappa Phi.
They are Arthur Hart, a graduate of the Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University and an
industrial engineering student here; Gregory Byrd,
a graduate of Clemson University and an electrical
engineering student here; and Rajendra Kadiyala,
a graduate of Purdue University and a medical stu
dent here.
The three were among 51 students selected for
the honor from 166 college graduates in 1984.
Phi Kappa Phi is a national scholastic honor soci
ety with headquarters on the campus of Louisiana
State University and chapters at 240 colleges and
universities throughout the nation.
