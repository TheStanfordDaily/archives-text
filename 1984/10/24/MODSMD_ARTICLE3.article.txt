With the presidential election less than two
weeks away, a campuswide straw poll indicates
that Stanford students favor Democratic candi
date Walter Mondale over incumbent Ronald
Reagan
Results of the poll show that, if the election
were held today, 56 percent of those students
surveyed would vote for Mondale, while 44 per
cent would vote for President Reagan.
A team of students Monday polled 1,141 of
their peers, mostly undergraduates, at a variety
of campus residences. Of the 1,141, 88 percent
said they were registered to vote in the Nov. 6
general election. Forty percent said they were
registered as Democrats, 32 percent as
Republicans and 28 percent as Independents.
The poll was conducted as part of a project in
an undergraduate special course, "The Making
of the President, 1960-1984." Tod Bergstrom,
a co-terminal student in history and one of the
instructors of the class, said the survey is accu
rate to within four percentage points.
Senior Bob Stocking, American studies
major and Bergstrom's co-instructor, said pol
lsters concentrated on a random sampling of
University dorms, Row houses and fraternities.
In November 1983, students in Bergstrom's
class undertook a similar poll, which showed
Reagan slightly ahead of Mondale among Stan
ford students. At that time, 40 percent of stu
dents polled said they would vote for Reagan if
Mondale were his opponent, while 38 percent
favored Mondale and 22 percent were un
decided.
In comparing the two polls, Bergstrom spec
ulated that many of those students who were
undecided a year ago "have moved to the
Mondale camp."
Results of the poll indicate the so-called

gender gap will play a large factor, at least
among students here, in the election. Nearly
half of the respondents indicated gender on
their survey, and, of these, women favor
Mondale 2:1 over Reagan, while men give just a
slight edge, 52 percent to 48 percent, to the
former vice president.
The poll also asked students to assess the can
didates' performance in the two recent
presidential debates.
One of the questions read: "As a result of the
presidential debates, is your opinion of the can
didates more favorable, less favorable or the
same?"
Of the responses, 57 percent rated Mondale
more favorably, 11 percent less favorably and
31 percent the same. For Reagan, 7 percent
viewed him more favorably in the wake of the
debates, 42 percent less favorably and 51 per
cent the same.
"I think the debate question shows that
people who were for Reagan before the debates
still like him, but some of the undecideds went
to Mondale," said Stocking, echoing
Bergstrom's opinion.
Results of the poll indicate Stanford students
"bucked the national trend," according to
Bergstrom. Going into the Oct. 21 debate, na
tional polls said Reagan was leading by
anywhere from nine to 25 points, depending on
whether you believe Harris or NBC. In addi
tion, Reagan has a commanding lead in the 18
to 24 age group nationally.
The poll also asked students to place first
themselves, and then the Stanford community,
on a scale of one to five, with one representing
"conservative" and five standing for "liberal."
Of the 1,020 responses to this question, the
average student rated himself 3.32, somewhere


between moderate and liberal, while
rating the Stanford community at
2.98.

But Stocking noted that the more
interesting aspect to this question was
the tendency for self-proclaimed
liberals to rate the campus as conser
vative, while the conservatives saw
Stanford as basically liberal.
"It's a sign that students tend to

look at themselves as being excep
tions to the rule," Stocking said.
"When students look at the campus,
they don't see themselves as typical.
They see themselves on the other side
of the political fence."
In 1980, nine campus precincts, in

eluding the "faculty ghetto," voted
overwhelmingly for Democratic in
cumbent Jimmy Carter. Carter
earned 46 percent and Independent
John Anderson garnered 29 percent
of the vote, while President Reagan
tallied 21 percent.

With the presidential election less than two
weeks away, a campuswide straw poll indicates
that Stanford students favor Democratic candi
date Walter Mondale over incumbent Ronald
Reagan
Results of the poll show that, if the election
were held today, 56 percent of those students
surveyed would vote for Mondale, while 44 per
cent would vote for President Reagan.
A team of students Monday polled 1,141 of
their peers, mostly undergraduates, at a variety
of campus residences. Of the 1,141, 88 percent
said they were registered to vote in the Nov. 6
general election. Forty percent said they were
registered as Democrats, 32 percent as
Republicans and 28 percent as Independents.
The poll was conducted as part of a project in
an undergraduate special course, "The Making
of the President, 1960-1984." Tod Bergstrom,
a co-terminal student in history and one of the
instructors of the class, said the survey is accu
rate to within four percentage points.
Senior Bob Stocking, American studies
major and Bergstrom's co-instructor, said pol
lsters concentrated on a random sampling of
University dorms, Row houses and fraternities.
In November 1983, students in Bergstrom's
class undertook a similar poll, which showed
Reagan slightly ahead of Mondale among Stan
ford students. At that time, 40 percent of stu
dents polled said they would vote for Reagan if
Mondale were his opponent, while 38 percent
favored Mondale and 22 percent were un
decided.
In comparing the two polls, Bergstrom spec
ulated that many of those students who were
undecided a year ago "have moved to the
Mondale camp."
Results of the poll indicate the so-called

gender gap will play a large factor, at least
among students here, in the election. Nearly
half of the respondents indicated gender on
their survey, and, of these, women favor
Mondale 2:1 over Reagan, while men give just a
slight edge, 52 percent to 48 percent, to the
former vice president.
The poll also asked students to assess the can
didates' performance in the two recent
presidential debates.
One of the questions read: "As a result of the
presidential debates, is your opinion of the can
didates more favorable, less favorable or the
same?"
Of the responses, 57 percent rated Mondale
more favorably, 11 percent less favorably and
31 percent the same. For Reagan, 7 percent
viewed him more favorably in the wake of the
debates, 42 percent less favorably and 51 per
cent the same.
"I think the debate question shows that
people who were for Reagan before the debates
still like him, but some of the undecideds went
to Mondale," said Stocking, echoing
Bergstrom's opinion.
Results of the poll indicate Stanford students
"bucked the national trend," according to
Bergstrom. Going into the Oct. 21 debate, na
tional polls said Reagan was leading by
anywhere from nine to 25 points, depending on
whether you believe Harris or NBC. In addi
tion, Reagan has a commanding lead in the 18
to 24 age group nationally.
The poll also asked students to place first
themselves, and then the Stanford community,
on a scale of one to five, with one representing
"conservative" and five standing for "liberal."
Of the 1,020 responses to this question, the
average student rated himself 3.32, somewhere


between moderate and liberal, while
rating the Stanford community at
2.98.

But Stocking noted that the more
interesting aspect to this question was
the tendency for self-proclaimed
liberals to rate the campus as conser
vative, while the conservatives saw
Stanford as basically liberal.
"It's a sign that students tend to

look at themselves as being excep
tions to the rule," Stocking said.
"When students look at the campus,
they don't see themselves as typical.
They see themselves on the other side
of the political fence."
In 1980, nine campus precincts, in

eluding the "faculty ghetto," voted
overwhelmingly for Democratic in
cumbent Jimmy Carter. Carter
earned 46 percent and Independent
John Anderson garnered 29 percent
of the vote, while President Reagan
tallied 21 percent.
