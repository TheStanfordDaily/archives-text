# Motorola: to sell or not to sell

### JACK ALDEN 
In the first segment of a two-part series
on the University's investments in com
panies that operate in South Africa, The
Daily explores Stanford's ownership of
stock in Motorola Inc.

When Stanford students go to the
ASSU polls next Tuesday and Wednes
day, they will not only be faced with
graduate senator elections and constitu
tional amendments, but they will also be
asked to vote on a referendum concern
ing Stanford's ownership of stock in
companies that operate in South Africa,
and more specifically, whether the Uni
versity should divest of its Motorola
stocks.
While the divestiture of the Motorola
stock is the short-term goal, ASSU
Senator Mark Landesmann, author of
the South Africa resolution, said the
long-term goal is for the University to
adopt a more responsible investment

policy with specific criteria for selective
divestiture, in policy as well as in theory.
These policies, Landesmann said, should
be applied to all companies.
"We are asking the board of trustees
to take a moderate stance on South
Africa and divestment," Landesmann
said.
Kirk Hanson, the outgoing head of the
president's Committee on Investment
Responsibility and a business professor,
agreed, "I don't think the student vote is
asking anything radical."
Motorola Inc. has a history of contro
versial operation in South Africa. Prior
to the Carter Administration's ban on
sales of military and police equipment to
South Africa in 1978, Motorola had sold
communications equipment to both
South African agencies. In 1982,
Motorola again sold communications
equipment to the South African police
and military and has since refused to

divulge information concerning any fol
lowing sales.
Although such sales are no longer ille
gal because the Reagan Administration
eased the bans, proponents of a share
holder resolution presented to Motorola
in May 1984, said that the sales are
"morally unacceptable." The resolution
requested Motorola to end all sales to
the South African military and police un
til the system of apartheid was abolished.
In response, Motorola said it believes
that the major use of its radio equipment
by police in South Africa, as elsewhere,
"is to support the protection of people
and property." It further stated that its
personnel practices in South Africa "are
incompatible with apartheid."
Stanford currently owns 94,000 shares
of Motorola in three merged endowment
funds, worth approximately $3.2 million,
according to Rodney Adams, University
treasurer.

In 1978, the board of trustees
abstained on a proposal that Motorola
make no further expansion in South
Africa, no further sales to South Africa
and that Motorola withdraw from South
Africa.
The board cited "Motorola's unusually
good record on socially affirmative ac
tions" and "its declaration that no more
sales would be made to the government
for military and police purposes."
By May 8, 1984, Stanford had
changed its tone. At that time the Uni
versity backed a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to end all sales to
the South African military and police
like the ones it made in 1982. After the
Motorola management wholeheartedly
rejected this proxy, Stanford, over a per
iod of three months, increased its owner-
