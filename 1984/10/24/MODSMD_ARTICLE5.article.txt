# Former provost suggests reforms

### ANNE LOCKE 
"I think this institution could well
plan to focus more attention on un
dergraduate education," says Albert
Hastorf, professor of psychology and
and human biology and former Uni
versity provost.
Hastorf proposes a wide scope of
educational reforms, including more
emphasis on math and natural
sciences, more stringent evaluations
of writing in upper-division courses,
and increased research and honors
opportunities for undergraduates.
Hastorf served as dean of the
school of humanities and sciences
here from 1970 to 1974. In 1979 he
accepted the post of provost, gener
ally regarded as the number two posi
tion in the University's administra
tion. He served as provost until Aug.
31 of this year.
In order to keep pace with'other
nations, Hastorf believes that
America needs to expand its mathe
matics programs, beginning at the
secondary school level.
"Mathematics is the fundamental
root of contemporary natural science
and social science," he says, asserting
we can no longer ignore its impor
tance.
He says university students gener
ally do not have a strong or sophisti
cated enough math background, and
while college math programs need to
be improved, a general curriculum

reform should begin in secondary
schools.
"By colleges and universities
paying more attention to
[mathematics], high schools will pay
more attention to it," Hastorf
predicts.
When asked where this strong
college-prep math emphasis would
put the student who does not wish to
go to college, Hastorf suggests that
certain college preparatory courses
are valuable to all students regardless

of what they plan to do.
He quickly points out, however,
that all students should be required to
go to school for 13 years, regardless
of their future plans.
Hastorf also says he is bothered by
the disregard students have for their
writing technique in non-English
classes. "I think we need to pay more
attention to the writing [done for] ad
vanced courses."
"Writing should become a way of
life," he says.

Hastorf says more senior seminars
are one way to improve writing skills,
because students receive more indi
vidual attention in a seminar setting.
He would like to see more seminar
work in the future, emphasizing
coherent writing and effective speak
ing.
In addition, Hastorf would like to
see more students conducting honors
research with a faculty member. He
calls research "the most exciting part
of undergraduate education" and
challenges the misperception that re
search is basically for graduate stu
dents.
"The way you get interested and
excited about research is by doing it,"
he said.
Hastorf suggests research teams of
three, consisting of one graduate stu
dent, one undergraduate and one fac
ulty member. In this trio, the under
graduate student would not be
relegated to purely clerical duties, al
though by virtue of experience the
graduate student and faculty member
would play more responsible roles, he
says.
Hastorf s proposed reforms would
make heavy demands on University
faculty. He would like to see the fac
ulty offer more broad lecture classes
as well as many seminars.

tional stereotyping," he says, pointing
out how these proposed lecture
courses would increase the number of
broad overviews given to students
with primary interests outside a
specific field.
"In English," Hastorf says, "senior
faculty tend to do [more general
lecture courses] because [students]
can jump right into a course on
Shakespeare." Professors in other
subjects often have to teach courses
so specialized that only students with
a great deal of background in that
area are qualified to take them.
Hastorf has definite ideas about the
hiring of new faculty. "I think this so
ciety badly needs to create posts for
young scholars," he says. Hastorf
recommends choosing "the best and
the brightest" in a field — regardless
of their intradepartmental specialty
— and creating three- to five-year
posts for both teaching and research,
similar to a post-doctorate fellowship.
Hastorf sees these teaching posts as
an opportunity for the growth of both
the junior faculty member and stu
dents, and he says he likes the idea of
"growing our own" senior professors.
However inadequate the Stanford
student seems when compared to the
educational ideal, Hastorf admits that
we do not lag behind other Univer
sities: He rates Stanford "about
average" right now. But he says Stan
ford needs to respond to a trend
toward improvement in collegiate
education to continue providing its
graduates with competetive skills.
