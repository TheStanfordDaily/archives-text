Death squads kill 3 in El Salvador
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — A right-wing death squad that
publicly has targeted President Jose Napoleon Duarte and his supporters
killed three youths last week, including the 14-year-old son of a pro-
Duarte peasant union leader, it was disclosed yesterday.
The killings, which prompted the U.S. Embassy to issue a com
munique expressing its "outrage," were discovered early Saturday
morning by the union official, Alirio Montes. Although the embassy
statement mentioned only his son, Montes said the bodies of two uni
dentified youths had been found with him.
In an interview, Montes said he discovered the deaths after he
received a telephone call early Saturday morning from a group called the
Secret Anticommunist Army. The caller told him where he could find
the body of his son, Boris.
The bodies of the three youths were found by the side of the road near
the capital's Mariona prison, an area long used by the death squads for
dumping the bodies of their victims. All three youths had been shot at
close range and each had the death squad's Spanish initials "ESA"
carved on his forehead.
The deaths provoked one of the strongest statements yet on death
squad activity from the U.S. Embassy, which had applauded a decrease
in the number of such killings following Duarte's election in May. The
communique, issued last night, said, "there are no words to properly ex
press our outrage that once again murderous thugs masquerading as
paramilitary 'patriots' have taken innocent life, this time that of a 14-
year-old boy."
The communique urged the Duarte government to "move quickly and
forcefully to bring about a full, vigorous investigation of this sickening
deed" and to bring the "full force of law to bear" on the culprits.
Nicaraguan leader criticizes U.S.
MANAGUA, Nicaragua— Deputy Foreign Minister Nora Astorga, a
former Sandinista rebel who once served as bait in a bedroom assassina
tion, yesterday accused the United States of distributing a "manual of
terrorism" to Nicaragua's current crop of insurgents.
Astorga, 36, was referring to a guerrilla handbook prepared for the
U.S.-backed anti-Sandinista rebels by the CIA.
Some copies of the booklet include "how-to" instructions that appear
to endorse such tactics as kidnapping and political assassination. Presi
dent Reagan and other administration officials have said that those ob
jectionable parts of the manual, which the administration says was
created by a low-level CIA official in Central America, were excised, but
that some copies of the original document were distributed.
"It is the manual of terrorism, something that the United States sup
posedly is completely against," Astorga said. "Nevertheless, what the
United States is supporting here is precisely organized terrorism by a
group of mercenaries whom they are financing and to whom they give
very good ideas for committing terrorism."
In Washington, Reagan administration officials announced yesterday
that members of the covert-operations division at CIA headquarters in
Washington, not senior officials, reviewed and approved the guerrilla
warfare manual advising Nicaraguan rebels on "selective use of vio
lence" to "neutralize carefully selected and planned targets."
The officials said that there was confusion about use of the word
"neutralize" and that it was not intended to mean or imply assassination,
prohibited by presidential order.
Administration officials said CIA Director William Casey and other
senior agency officials did not approve the manual and were unaware of
it until asked about it this month by the Associated Press.
Reagan heckled at Portland rally
PORTLAND, Ore. — President Reagan encountered the worst heck
ling of his presidency yesterday as he spoke through constant jeering to
5,000 mostly supportive people at the University of Portland.
Reagan, a smile on his face, sailed right through the taunts of several
dozen protesters, rarely missing a beat in his delivery.
But the demonstrators clearly irritated the bulk of the audience, creat
ing a scene in which Reagan supporters frequently shouted "shut up"
and waved fists at the president's antagonists — and sometimes even di
rected obscenities at his absent campaign rival, Democrat Walter
Mondale.
"The president loved it," campaign spokesman James Lake said after
ward. "It got his competitive juices flowing."
Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush campaigned through dairy
country yesterday, telling farmers they have a choice between expanding
world markets under Reagan administration policies or returning to such
"disastrous" programs as the 1980 grain embargo imposed by former
President Carter.
Starting his day by visiting a Minnesota dairy farm, during which he
tried his hand at milking a Guernsey cow, Bush stressed the theme of
economic progress.
"The thing that's going to determine this election is the economy," he
told a Green Bay civic and business leader's luncheon. "How do people
feel? Do people feel better off? And I'm not suggesting everyone does."
Mondale reveals Reagan letter
YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio— Democratic presidential candidate Walter
Mondale moved yesterday to summon the Democrats here home by
quoting a letter Ronald Reagan wrote to Richard Nixon in 1960 that
likened John F. Kennedy's ideas to those of Karl Marx and Adolf Hitler.
The recently unearthed, three-page handwritten letter, sent to Repub
lican presidential candidate Nixon just after the Democratic National
Convention had nominated Kennedy for president, reads in part:
"One last thought, shouldn't someone tag Mr. Kennedy's bold new
imaginative program with it's (sic) proper age? Under the tousled boyish
haircut it is still old Karl Marx — first launched a century ago. There is
nothing new in the idea of a Govt, being Big Brother to us all. Hitler
called his 'State Socialism' and way before him it was 'benevolent
monarchy.' "
Mondale, hands and face shaking, told a rally at Youngstown State
University here, "That's a big difference between the two of us. I believe
that a president who cares, who leads — just as Kennedy did — can
make and must make a difference in the lives of our country. That's not
Karl Marx. That's not Adolf Hitler. That's America. That's America at
its best."
Democratic vice-presidential contender Geraldine Ferraro, arriving
for three days of intensive campaigning in eight California cities, told
more than 4,500 cheering students in San Diego yesterday that Presi
dent Reagan's policies in Central America were "a misbegotten ad
venture"
Aides said that Ferraro's campaign trip there, her fifth to California,
indicated the high hopes and critical importance the Democrats place on
the state as the presidential race moves into its final two weeks.
By the time she leaves for Oregon and Washington tomorrow, Ferraro
will also have appeared with Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) in Los
Angeles, and at rallies and other events in Oakland, San Jose, Stockton
and San Francisco.

unfair-competition suit in U.S. District Court on behalf of writer Fred
Worth.
