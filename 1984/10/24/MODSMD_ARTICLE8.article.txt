SEBOKENG, South Africa —
Seven thousand police and soldiers
swept into three black townships yes
terday, hunting house-to-house for
dissidents, interrogating thousands of
residents and arresting more than 350
people.
Police said they were searching for
agitators they blame for two months
of sporadic rioting against the racial
policies of the white government. But
most of the 357 blacks arrested were
picked up on minor charges. No vio
lence was reported and there were no
known casualties.
The force of police and combat
ready troops moved into Sebokeng,
about 40 miles south of Johannes
burg, before dawn, then regrouped in
the afternoon and launched similar
operations in Sharpeville and
Boipatong, about six miles away.
Of 82 people who were killed in

the recent riots, one — a three-week
old boy struck in the head by a stone
in Sharpeville two weeks ago — was
white.
Yesterday's raids were the most ex
tensive deployment of the army
against the black majority since riots
began, and drew quick criticism.
Trevor Manuel, a spokesman for
the anti-apartheid, multiracial or
ganization United Democratic Front,
said the sieges were tantamount to
the start of civil war.
The raid on Sebokeng's rows of
box-like, four-room houses began
when armored personnel carriers
rumbled onto the rutted streets. Hel
meted soldiers carrying backpacks
and assault rifles took up positions 20
yards apart. Police in camouflage
fatigues raided 18,000 homes before
noon. Not a shot was fired.
Police Lt. Henry Beck said the

crackdown was a signal to other
troubled black townships that the
white government will deal forcefully
with further rioting and school
boycotts.
Beck said 120,000 of Sebokeng's
162,000 residents were interrogated.
Sharpeville is larger than Sebokeng,
and Boipatong is much smaller.
Details of the raids in those townships
were not immediately available.
Beck reported that most of the 348
people arrested at Sebokeng faced
minor criminal charges. He said the
most serious offenses were unlicensed
weapons, possession of stolen ma
terial, and living in the township with
out permission.
Police spokesman Col. Vic Haines
said nine people were arrested in
Boipatong and Sharpeville, all on
criminal — not political — charges.
Louis le Grange, minister of law

and order, said in a statement, "The
unrest situation is not only fanned by
revolutionary elements, but also i s
exploited by criminal and i n .
timidatory forces."
Le Grange said the army only as
sisted police. Beck described the
army's role as "passive" and said the
soldiers did not raid homes.
"They were on the streets when we
woke up. 1 was very scared," said ser
vice station attendant Cillie Ramphi.
The president of the South African
Council of Churches, Bishop Manas
Buthelezi, said, "We all know that
what the people of Sebokeng and
other areas want are basic human
rights."
The council's secretary general,
Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu, last
week won the Nobel Peace Prize.
Tutu now is in the United States.
