# General, 6 soldiers implicated
## Report submitted on Aquino case 
### 
MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand
Marcos yesterday ordered the confinement and
speedy prosecution of an air force general and six
soldiers implicated hours earlier by the chairman of
a citizens' board investigating last year's slaying of
opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr.
It was not clear what action Marcos would take
when the other four members of the board issue a
separate report, expected today. The separate
report is expected to go further and call for the pro
secution of Gen. Fabian Ver, the armed forces
chief of staff, and other military personnel under
investigation in the incident.
Although the board unanimously rejected the of
ficial military position that a Communist assassin
shot Aquino, the divided conclusion of the year
long inquiry was certain to displease Aquino's fam
ily and other government critics, who have long
feared a whitewash.
The board's chairman, Corazon Agrava, submit
ted a 121-page report alleging that a limited mili
tary conspiracy was responsible for Aquino's death.
The opposition leader was killed Aug. 21, 1983,
seconds after being escorted from an airliner at
Manila International Airport. Agrava urged that a
murder charge be filed against Gen. Luther Cus
todio, head of the airport security unit at the time
of the incident, and the six soldiers who escorted
Aquino from the aircraft.
The board's other members have been preparing
a far more complex and sweeping indictment of the

military establishment. Their report is expected to
implicate not only Custodio and the six escorts but
also Gen. Ver, who is Marcos' cousin and closest
aide; Gen. Prospero Olivas, the chief military in
vestigator in the case; and several other military
men who were in the area when the killing took
place.
The Los Angeles Times reported yesterday, in
correctly, that the findings of the other four board
members had been submitted simultaneously with
Agrava's report.
Neither report links Marcos or his wife, Imelda,
to the slaying.
In her report, Agrava does not establish a motive
for the slaying. She discusses evidence that a
widespread coverup took place but does not rec
ommend that any charges be filed in this connec
tion. She says it is not possible to determine
precisely who pulled the trigger but says that the
evidence indicates that this was most likely Sgt.
Rogelio Moreno, Sgt. Filomeno Miranda or Con
stable Mario Lazaga, all of whom were standing be
hind Aquino when he was shot in the back of the
head.
Although she cites what she says are lies under
oath by the escorts as the reason for believing them
to be involved in the slaying, she says a series of
"misstatements" made to the board by Ver in no
way constitutes evidence that he was part of the af
fair.
"Gen. Ver was not a plotter," Agrava, 69, a
former appeals court judge, concludes in her

report.
She cites the Reagan administration's handling
of the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and
the bombing of the U.S. military barracks there, as
a precedent for her finding. She says that Ver can
not be faulted on grounds that he had "command
responsibility" for the men who killed Aquino.
In a statement on government television, Cus
todio denied that he was a party to any conspiracy
and charged that the board had disregarded
evidence backing the official military version of the
incident. The military position is that the killer was
a Communist assassin, Rolando Galman, who was
killed in a hail of bullets fired by security forces
after he shot Aquino.
Agrava ignored a request from her four male col
leagues on the board to refrain from disclosing her
version of events until their report was completed.
As a result, the four did not appear at the presiden
tial palace yesterday for the formal submission of
Agrava's report to President Marcos.
At the ceremony, Marcos said he would refer
Agrava's document, which he called "the report of
the chairman," to a special tribunal set up to hear
criminal cases involving corruption on the part of
government officials. He made no mention,
however, of the separate report to be submitted by
the board's other members.

the board's other members.
