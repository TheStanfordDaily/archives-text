# ASSU nixes 3-year limit
## Plan will have to wait 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
In a special meeting last night, the ASSU Senate voted
to exclude from next week's election a last minute consti
tutional amendment limiting senators to three terms.
Student petitioners responsible for bringing the amend
ment to the senate's attention now say that they will
resume their efforts to have students vote on it.
Karen Easterbrook, a leader of the petition drive, said
last night that she may resurrect the amendment.
"I'll have to talk to some people and find out if they
think if s important enough — I think it is," she said. "I
think it's worth it to go for a special winter election."
The petitioners turned in about 650 signatures yester
day. But too many signatures were without ID numbers,
and the petitions were invalidated, reported Council of
Presidents member Alice Wells.
"If they want to get on the ballot winter quarter, they'll
have to start over," she said.
Holding a winter-quarter election would also be expen
sive. "If another petition drive is initiated," Senate Chair
Eric Berg said, " people will be making the choice to hold
a special winter quarter election that will cost between
$1,200 and $3,000."
The immediate concern of the senate, however, will be
interpersonal relations and not the future of the amend
ment.
Prior to tonight's meeting, speculation existed that the
amendment was targeted at certain graduate senators.
The amendment's supporters repeatedly denied this in the
course of the night's debate, but many senators remained
convinced that personal vengeance motivated the amend
ment.
"The reason for this amendment is clear. It is to elimi
nate Jim McGrath from the senate," said graduate
Senator Donald Gardner.
McGrath, a graduate senator, would be unable to run
for re-election this spring were the amendment approved
by student voters.
"1 hope very, very strongly that the conclusion will be
that there will not be personal animosity," McGrath said
after the meeting.
He added, "The senate has to operate on trust between
its members."
"To my mind, one of the most severe shocks a body like
ours can experience is an experience like tonight — the
rearing of personal animosity — because that's what
destroys trust," McGrath said.
"I am very distressed that the turn of events led to this
being interpreted as a personal vi tta.'' iid Senator
Yvonne Campos, a leading pro[ wiKolli. tnendment.
"I can only hope that it will not hinder the future coopera
tion of senators."
Senators supporting the amendment claimed that

senators who have served more than three terms tend to
obstruct the senate's consideration of new, creative ideas,
and asserted that, regardless of the merits of the bill, it
should have been placed before student voters because of
the number of petition signatures it had attracted.
