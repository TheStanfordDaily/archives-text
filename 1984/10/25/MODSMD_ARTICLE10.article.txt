# Poll finds few voters change

WASHINGTON — Few votes were changed by
the final televised debate between President
Reagan and Democratic challenger Walter
Mondale, according to the latest Washington Post-
ABC News poll.
The survey, taken Monday and Tuesday nights,
showed the president heading into the final
fortnight of the campaign with a 54-to-42 percent
lead over his Democratic challenger. That is the
same margin the Republicans held in the pre
debate Post-ABC poll taken Oct. 12-16.
The failure of Mondale to budge the numbers in
his last face-to-face confrontation with Reagan
highlighted the difficulty he faces in overcoming
the lead Reagan has held since the campaign got
under way.
Mondale pollster Peter Hart, confirming that he
had similar figures, said the phenomenon that
"amazes me is the remarkable consistency in
Reagan's numbers over the last five months. Our
challenge remains to convert some of those weak

Reagan voters,"he said, "and we have less time."
John Buckley, a spokesman for the Reagan cam
paign, said, "Our polling shows some movement
toward Reagan since the (Sunday) debate and we
believe the margin is larger than 12 points." Other
officials said the lead in Reagan's polls was about
17 points.
In a similar Post-ABC poll taken in the two days
after their first debate Oct. 7, Mondale shaved
three points from Reagan's advantage and cut an
other three points in the next week.
Mondale was judged the clear winner of that first
debate, while Reagan had a 38-to-25 percent ad
vantage over Mondale among those interviewed as
the winner of Sunday's session in Kansas City.
Among Reagan backers, 68 percent said the presi
dent won the second debate, 4 percent said
Mondale did and the rest thought neither had won.
Among Mondale supporters, 58 percent said the
former vice president won, 4 percent said Reagan
won and the rest saw neither as the winner.

The Post-ABC poll is based on call-back inter
views with 1,081 registered voters who were sur
veyed in the pre-debate poll. More than seven out
of 10 polled said they had watched some or all of
the second debate.
Three out of 10 respondents said they thought
Reagan was too old to serve a second term as presi
dent — about the same percentage who had held
that opinion before the debate.
Mondale's approval rating, which took a dra
matic leap upward after the first debate in Louis
ville, showed a slight gain this time, going to 53 to
44 percent favorable from 50 to 44 percent. But
Reagan's rating also improved slightly, from 60 to
36 percent favorable to 61 to 36 percent and
remained substantially higher than Mondale's.
There is a sharp racial polarization in the vote,
with Reagan getting six of every 10 white votes in
the surveys and Mondale getting more than eight of
every 10 black votes.
