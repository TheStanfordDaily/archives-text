## When smog gets in your eyes Why Santa Clara's air makes you wheeze and gasp 
### BRYAN WALSER 
Residents of Santa Clara County have gasped their
way through as many as 20 days per year when the air
failed to meet governmental health guidelines, accord
ing to air pollution experts.
Paul Brant, a spokesman for the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District, said the Santa Clara
area consistently has the worst air in the Bay Area,
with smog levels going over the allowable rate of
federal air quality standards by 400 percent in Sunny
vale and 1,200 percent near San Jose.
Even so, there has been a 70 percent reduction in
the amount of serious air pollution in the Bay Area
over the last 15 years. Brant said. But this improve
ment is probably not as noticeable in Santa Clara
County because of the geography of the area.
Specifically, management district officials point out
that the prevailing northerly winds tend to collect dirty
air in the north and sweep it down the Bay, until the
moving air hits the southern hills. Under certain wea
ther conditions, a layer of warm air can be formed
which sits like a cap over the hills.
This inversion layer traps the dirty air beneath it,
where the sun can bake industrial contaminants and

nitrogen oxides into a foul mixture known as photo
chemical smog. When fumes from the cumbustion of
the 1.5 million gallons of gas sold in Santa Clara
County each day are added to the industrial chemical
waste from the Silicon Valley and other area indus
tries, the potential for serious air quality problems
becomes evident.
Compared with other areas, however, the smog here
seems almost tame. Los Angeles has over 80 major
health alerts each year due to photochemical smog,
and significant health problems have developed as a
result. Eastern cities are beseiged by acid rain formed
from sulphur oxides, a problem fortunately absent
from this area.
But the local air quality problem is still serious, and
local governments are continuing their efforts to clean
up the air, according to management district officials.
Increased emphasis on enforcing motor vehicle smog
control legislation has contributed greatly to recent
decreases in air pollution, and attempts are currently
under way to regulate industrial effulents in the Silicon
Valley. In addition, after the runaway increase in vehi
cle population in Santa Clara County peaks, significant
gains in air quality are likely be realized.
