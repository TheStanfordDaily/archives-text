"Satellite Glides in Space; SRI Lis
tening for Signals."
When this headline appeared on
the front of The Daily on Oct. 7,
1957, the Stanford campus, along
with the rest of United States, was
filled with excitement and fear. The
Soviet Union, a supposedly backward
country, had just beaten the United
States in the space race.
For most people, interest in Soviet
affairs waned in the years after Sput
nik. For Richard Schupbach, the
newly-named head of the Slavic Lan
guages and Literature Department
here, curiosity about the Soviet
Union has developed into a lifetime
career.
Entering Yale University in the fall
of 1958, Schupbach was still fasci
nated by the secretive, perhaps even
mystical, Soviet Union. Upon receiv
ing his bachelor's in Russian Studies
in 1962, he continued his education
in the same field, acquiring a master's
in 1964 and a doctorate in 1969, both
at the University of California at Los
Angeles.
After one year of postdoctoral
study in Rostov-on-the-Don in the
Soviet Union and one year of teach
ing at Moorhead State University in
Minnesota, Schupbach came to Stan
ford as an associate professor of
Slavic Languages.
Now in his thirteenth year at Stan
ford, Schupbach has replaced William
Todd as chairman of the department.
Todd, who served six years as chair
man, is now on a one-year sabbatical.
Admittedly, the Slavic Languages
Department is small; it has only six
professors and graduates only eight to
10 majors a year. According to
Schupbach, a chairman's position in
such a small-department consists
largely of "plain, old-fashioned bu
reaucratic work."
In the area of student interest in
Russian, Schupbach noted that en
rollment in the Russian program has
risen steadily at a rate of 10 percent a
year over the last five years. This
year, the department intends to hire
another full-time professor. Also,
Schupbach characterized his students
as "more serious" and "more sophis
ticated in their learning of Russian"
than before.

An attempt to establish a Russian
theme house at Stanford is currently
underway by a group of students and
faculty. Schupbach believes such a
house could help keep students inter
ested in Russian. Currently, the de
partment loses one-half of its enroll
ment in each successive year of lan
guage study.
Schupbach also mentioned his
hopes that a native Russian speaker
would be hired to live in the residence
to aid the students in gaining fluency

outside the classroom. He said stu
dents who graduate from Stanford
with a degree in Slavic Languages,
while having a very good hold on the
mechanics of the language, can speak
only with "halting fluency."
Despite the obvious benefits of a
Russian theme house, the prospects
may be limited. William Todd, the
former chairman, tried it and failed.
Schupbach also doubts that the cur
rent effort will achieve success; the
Russian program does not enjoy the
same student interest as do the other
language programs and so lacks the
necessary funding for a theme house.
The problems of lack of interest
and weakness in speaking ability are
real. But Schupbach believes these
ills flow, at least in part, from a more
fundamental problem. "It simply

takes us too long to teach our stif
dents Russian," he said.
In an effort to deal with this situa>
tion, Schupbach is sponsoring the in
troduction of microcomputers into
the Slavic languages curriculum;.
When implemented, the computed
will be used to drill students on vo
cabulary and grammar. Also, in order
to gain entrance into the third and
fourth-year programs, a student wiH
have to pass a computer-based test. •
According to Schupbach, such

procedures would guarantee that
every student in these advanced pro
grams would have at least the neces
sary skills for the courseworlf,
thereby eliminating the need for the
teacher to waste time waiting for a
weaker student. Schupbach said thie
software has already been written,
but the department has not yet ac
quired the necessary hardware.
Despite the current problems,
Schupbach reaffirmed his confidence
in the future of the Slavic Languages
Department. He also said that he hafs
never lost his initial fascination with
the Soviet Union. Teaching Russian
is difficult, but the hard work pays off
when a student begins to feel the
same fascination that he does for thfc
Soviet people.
