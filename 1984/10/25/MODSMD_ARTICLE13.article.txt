## The Stanford Daily Behind closed doors
### 
Three weeks ago, the San Jose Mercury News
was denied access to Faculty Senate meetings be
cause the senate's Steering Committee "saw no
particular reason to change senate policy," ac
cording to senate Chairman John Merryman.
On the contrary, we see many reasons to
change that policy.
Currently, only campus media may attend. But
the senate discusses issues of importance to the
community and to the nation. Stanford is a major
institution of research as well as of education, and
decisions made by the Faculty Senate on issues
such as the Reagan Library affect many people
outside the University. Thus, media other than
The Daily, KZSU Radio and the University's
news service have an interest in covering senate
meetings.
Senate rules now force outside media to gather
their information on the biweekly meetings after

the faculty have adjourned. This imposition hurts
the media in two ways. First, reporters cannot
meet early deadlines if their reporting begins
when the meetings end. Second, reporters cannot
convey the atmosphere and tone of the meetings
if they are forbidden to cover the event first
hand.
It is obvious that the senate does not consider
its meetings secret: Reporters are welcome to lis
ten to an unedited version of the meeting imme
diately after it ends. Opening meetings to the
press would therefore not violate any privacy.
Nor would allowing press destroy the ambiance
of senate meetings.
Merryman said the senate has previously voted
to preserve "the informality, congeniality and in
timacy" of its meetings by limiting press
coverage. Rather, the senate should recognize
the formality, significance and newsworthiness of
its meetings by allowing press coverage.
