## The
						Philippines in turmoil 
### 
As an American, it is difficult for
me to imagine living in a country such
as the Philippines, where the viola
tion of human rights has gone so far
that even a special term, "salvage,"
exists to describe the extra-judicial
execution of individuals who perhaps
have organized a human rights

demonstration or have voiced some
protest against the government. As a
Taiwanese, however, these words —
martial law, blacklists, secret police
and spies, to name a few — sound a
little less foreign, for often I have
heard my parents, friends and visitors
speak of these things which happen in
Taiwan. Indeed, I never quite
realized how strongly I could identify
with the situation in the Philippines
until I attended a presentation en
titled "The Philippines in Turmoil"
given by journalist and Knight Fellow
Pauline Sicam.
Sicam's presentation seemed espe
cially timely; only hours before, news
of the final draft report on Philippine
opposition leader Benigno Aquino's
assassination made headlines in
various morning papers. The report,
made public this week, accuses 19
military personnel — Chief of Staff
General Fabian Ver in particular —
of conspiracy in the assassination of
Aquino last August at Manila Inter
national Airport. No finger is pointed
to Marcos or his wife in the report,
and Ver, literally Marcos' right hand
person, is likely to be acquitted if
brought to trial, according to Sicam.
The murder of Aquino, nonethe
less, cannot be left behind so easily.
In her talk, Sicam unfolded the years
of mounting tension leading to the
turbulent aftermath of Aquino's mur
der. Counting on Filipino apathy and
docility, Aquino's murderers are in
stead confronted with "a long-silent
people voicing hatred of martial
rule," as Sicam put it. A people can
only endure so much; Those who
think that Asian countries such as the
Philippines and Taiwan will continue
to prosper complacently under mar
tial law might learn from Aquino's
murderers.
On Sept. 21, 1983, the day Marcos
set aside in celebration of his regime,

half a million Filipinos joined to
gether in a "March of Sorrow" to
protest labor exploitation, the looting
of public funds, the mockery of politi
cal elections and the lack of human
rights and self-sovereignty. Catalyzed
by Aquino's assassination, the anger
of a people oppressed since the 19th
century under Spain is finally emerg
ing and fusing into a movement to
oust Marcos, whose legitimacy is
beginning to lose ground even in his
Parliament and Supreme Court.
Multi-sectorial opposition forces,
supported by the so-called
"Parliament of the Streets" of stu
dents, farmers, laborers and such,
have begun to form a coalition while
underground forces mobilize troops
in the countryside. Despite Marcos'

As long as Marcos' corrupt regime
continues to receive aid and approval
from this country, we cannot blame
the Filipinos for calling their country
the 'U.S.-Marcos Dictatorship.'

desperate attempts to enforce his
regime's songs, culture and identity
and to salvage out opposition figures,
fasts, vigils, strikes, amnesty requests
and protests are fast becoming the
Filipinos' weapons against injustice.
"Protest used to be a lonely activity.
Now it is the only accepted social
event," Sicam said wryly.
Such is but a broad overview of a
country struggling for the day when
its people can freely experience
justice and democracy. Now 1 briefly
return to Taiwan. Today it does not
seem to be a site of revolution or up
heaval, and it does not show the
crumbling economic crisis of the
Philippines. But beneath its exterior,
I believe there lies a deep, often un
voiced ache for Taiwan self
determination, human rights and an
acknowledgement of the Taiwanese

spirit and culture. February 28, 1947
brings to older Taiwanese memories
of a time when the Taiwanese
revolted against the recently estab
lished Nationalist Chinese regime. It
was to result in the slaughter of
thousands, many of them the island's
brightest, most promising young
leaders — Taiwan's Benigno
Aquinos. Since the "2-28 Revolu
tion," most of Taiwan has settled
down to almost 40 years of martial
rule, the longest in modern history. I
can only say that it is truly tragic if the
mockery of democracy and abuse of
human rights is ignored and accepted.
What is now happening in the
Philippines offers hope and most cer
tainly calls for the respect of other na-

Finally, there is the crucial question
of U.S. involvement in Asia. As long
as Marcos' corrupt regime continues
to receive aid and approval from this
country, we cannot blame the
Filipinos for calling their country the
"U.S. — Marcos Dictatorship." The
United States' controlling influence
in the International Monetary Fund,
its widespread commerce and
banking in the Philippines and most
of all U.S. military bases in the
Philippines amply justify Sicam's
comment, "The U.S. is satisfied with
martial law as long as American in
terests are served." Indeed, one feels
compassion for the Filipino cause and
at the same time challenges this na
tion which supports "democratic"
regimes.
