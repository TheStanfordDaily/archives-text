## Why are we voting for President Reagan? 
### 
Despite Democratic challenger Walter Mondale's per
formance in the debates, President Reagan will almost
certainly win the election. He will win, as most presidents
do, by receiving more votes than his opponent. In particu
lar, he will win because more people like you and me are
going to vote for him, which leads me to ask the question,
"Why are you going to vote for Reagan?"
Most of us who will vote for him will not do so because
we agree with his policies or the policies of the Republican
platform. The polls show that most of us disagree with
Reagan's stand on many of the most important issues. For
example, 70 percent of the country favors a freeze in the
production and deployment of nuclear weapons, yet
Reagan has opposed every nuclear weapons treaty since
the bomb was first dropped. Reagan favors outlawing all
abortions, even those to prevent the birth of a child con
ceived in rape or incest, while polls show that the majority
of people agree with the Supreme Court that the woman
should decide what happens to the embryo. We want
stronger schools, yet he fought for the destruction of the
Department of Education. Finally, Reagan's tax cuts were
beneficial to only a few, the rich, while the majority of us
received little or no gain from them, and the poor lost
ground.
If most of us, though not all of us, disagree with
Reagan's policies, then why are we going to vote for him?
I believe the answer lies in the psyche of this country's
citizens. People like to feel that they belong to something;
they like to feel safe. People do not like to feel they are
outcasts, or that the group does not want them. People
want to be inside the group, not outside.
During the four years that Reagan has presided over
this country, many people felt like they could belong to
America, and that they could be inside America. In the
19605, on the other hand, this country endured a tremen
dous social revolution in addition to a terribly heinous war
against Vietnam. This upheaval brought overwhelming
self-doubt to this country, and few people felt like they
were inside America. We questioned and broke all the
rules in the '60s; in the '70s we lived without guidelines,
adrift, outside. The '70s were a decade of excesses and
mediocrity. The '70s brought us Richard Nixon, and then
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. The '70s brought us AC
DC and then the Bee Gees.
Reagan happened to be at the right place at the right
time. At the beginning of this decade he gave us his vision
of America, and we bought it. He has a vision of a great
America, an America of the 19505, in which America is
strong and people go to church regularly and are Protes
tant. They pray, even at school. People are white and
healthy and drink milk. The people of America have ac
cepted this vision of America because, after the tumul
tuous '60s and drifting '70s, we need something secure to
hold onto and we need to be inside. If we vote for Reagan,
we are voting for this illusion.
We want to be inside this illusory America. We want to
wave flags at the Olympics; we want to see John Wayne,
not drug addicts, on the front of Wheaties boxes; we want
to shop at Neiman-Marcus; we want to order everything

from the Sharper Image catalog. We want to run on the
beach and drink Sunkist orange pop. We want to sit in
fancy bars with beautiful women who wear big diamond
rings and expensive furs and with handsome men who
wear beautifully tailored $2,000 suits and own big yachts.
After the last two decades, we desperately need to belong.
We need to be inside this illusion of America, to be home
again, so we vote for Reagan and his illusions.
In Reagan's simple-minded vision of America and the
world, the Soviet Union is the "evil empire" and we are
crusaders for peace, democracy, motherhood and all that
is good and virtuous. In Reagan's illusion, there are two
kinds of countries: evil communist states and good peace
loving democracies. As a good peace-loving democracy,
we halt the creeping, communist scourge in nefarious,
powerful countries like Grenada by sending in the
Marines to battle about a thousand construction workers
and a few men from the local militia. According to
Reagan's illusion, poor people are poor because they are
lazy. In America anyone can become rich if he just puts
his shoulder to the wheel, his nose to the grindstone and
works hard.
We despise Mondale. He attacks Reagan, and thus he
attacks the illusion we crave. Mondale attempts to destroy
the illusion. He speaks for the outsiders, not those out
siders like us who can share in the dream, but those out
siders whom we have locked out: the blacks, the gays, the
Hispanics and the women. Because Mondale attacks our
illusions of America and seems to want to bring us back to
the chaos of the '70s, he starts to look old and greasy and
tired. He is an outsider, and we don't like outsiders, be
cause we don't want to be left outside. We want to be in
siders, so we vote for Reagan.
Reagan manipulates the media in order to keep the
illusion strong in our minds. He rarely appears at press
conferences, and when he does, he usually reads prepared
statements. His rallies are stage productions, and, as an
actor, Reagan never misses his cue or forgets his lines.
He blatantly violates the First Amendment. For exam
ple, he used executive authority to prohibit the media
from covering the Grenadan invasion. He wants to censor
all government employees. At a rally in Cincinnati his
thought police took away the signs of the ralliers and
gave them new ones.
These violations of the First Amendment do not bother
insiders like us, or one who desperately wants to be inside,
because we see Reagan as defending our illusion. Those
on the outside, though, see a mockery of the justice that
made America great.
Finally, we must recognize that Reagan's illusion will
harm us. We do not live in Reagan's simple world. We live
in a complicated world. A nostalgic, illusory view of the
'50s will not solve the problems we face in today's compli
cated world. We need new ideas, not harmful illusions, to
help this great country overcome its weaknesses and
achieve its potential.
Why are you voting for Reagan? Don't fool yourself.

"Why are you going to vote for Reagan?"
Most of us who will vote for him will not do so because
we agree with his policies or the policies of the Republican
platform. The polls show that most of us disagree with
Reagan's stand on many of the most important issues. For
example, 70 percent of the country favors a freeze in the
production and deployment of nuclear weapons, yet
Reagan has opposed every nuclear weapons treaty since
the bomb was first dropped. Reagan favors outlawing all
abortions, even those to prevent the birth of a child con
ceived in rape or incest, while polls show that the majority
of people agree with the Supreme Court that the woman
should decide what happens to the embryo. We want
stronger schools, yet he fought for the destruction of the
Department of Education. Finally, Reagan's tax cuts were
beneficial to only a few, the rich, while the majority of us
received little or no gain from them, and the poor lost
ground.
If most of us, though not all of us, disagree with
Reagan's policies, then why are we going to vote for him?
I believe the answer lies in the psyche of this country's
citizens. People like to feel that they belong to something;
they like to feel safe. People do not like to feel they are
outcasts, or that the group does not want them. People
want to be inside the group, not outside.
During the four years that Reagan has presided over
this country, many people felt like they could belong to
America, and that they could be inside America. In the
19605, on the other hand, this country endured a tremen
dous social revolution in addition to a terribly heinous war
against Vietnam. This upheaval brought overwhelming
self-doubt to this country, and few people felt like they
were inside America. We questioned and broke all the
rules in the '60s; in the '70s we lived without guidelines,
adrift, outside. The '70s were a decade of excesses and
mediocrity. The '70s brought us Richard Nixon, and then
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. The '70s brought us AC
DC and then the Bee Gees.
Reagan happened to be at the right place at the right
time. At the beginning of this decade he gave us his vision
of America, and we bought it. He has a vision of a great
America, an America of the 19505, in which America is
strong and people go to church regularly and are Protes
tant. They pray, even at school. People are white and
healthy and drink milk. The people of America have ac
cepted this vision of America because, after the tumul
tuous '60s and drifting '70s, we need something secure to
hold onto and we need to be inside. If we vote for Reagan,
we are voting for this illusion.
We want to be inside this illusory America. We want to
wave flags at the Olympics; we want to see John Wayne,
not drug addicts, on the front of Wheaties boxes; we want
to shop at Neiman-Marcus; we want to order everything

from the Sharper Image catalog. We want to run on the
beach and drink Sunkist orange pop. We want to sit in
fancy bars with beautiful women who wear big diamond
rings and expensive furs and with handsome men who
wear beautifully tailored $2,000 suits and own big yachts.
After the last two decades, we desperately need to belong.
We need to be inside this illusion of America, to be home
again, so we vote for Reagan and his illusions.
In Reagan's simple-minded vision of America and the
world, the Soviet Union is the "evil empire" and we are
crusaders for peace, democracy, motherhood and all that
is good and virtuous. In Reagan's illusion, there are two
kinds of countries: evil communist states and good peace
loving democracies. As a good peace-loving democracy,
we halt the creeping, communist scourge in nefarious,
powerful countries like Grenada by sending in the
Marines to battle about a thousand construction workers
and a few men from the local militia. According to
Reagan's illusion, poor people are poor because they are
lazy. In America anyone can become rich if he just puts
his shoulder to the wheel, his nose to the grindstone and
works hard.
We despise Mondale. He attacks Reagan, and thus he
attacks the illusion we crave. Mondale attempts to destroy
the illusion. He speaks for the outsiders, not those out
siders like us who can share in the dream, but those out
siders whom we have locked out: the blacks, the gays, the
Hispanics and the women. Because Mondale attacks our
illusions of America and seems to want to bring us back to
the chaos of the '70s, he starts to look old and greasy and
tired. He is an outsider, and we don't like outsiders, be
cause we don't want to be left outside. We want to be in
siders, so we vote for Reagan.
Reagan manipulates the media in order to keep the
illusion strong in our minds. He rarely appears at press
conferences, and when he does, he usually reads prepared
statements. His rallies are stage productions, and, as an
actor, Reagan never misses his cue or forgets his lines.
He blatantly violates the First Amendment. For exam
ple, he used executive authority to prohibit the media
from covering the Grenadan invasion. He wants to censor
all government employees. At a rally in Cincinnati his
thought police took away the signs of the ralliers and
gave them new ones.
These violations of the First Amendment do not bother
insiders like us, or one who desperately wants to be inside,
because we see Reagan as defending our illusion. Those
on the outside, though, see a mockery of the justice that
made America great.
Finally, we must recognize that Reagan's illusion will
harm us. We do not live in Reagan's simple world. We live
in a complicated world. A nostalgic, illusory view of the
'50s will not solve the problems we face in today's compli
cated world. We need new ideas, not harmful illusions, to
help this great country overcome its weaknesses and
achieve its potential.
Why are you voting for Reagan? Don't fool yourself.

Despite Democratic challenger Walter Mondale's per
formance in the debates, President Reagan will almost
certainly win the election. He will win, as most presidents
do, by receiving more votes than his opponent. In particu

going to vote for him, which leads me to ask the question,
