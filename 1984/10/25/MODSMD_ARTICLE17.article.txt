Sperm donations
Monday's Daily (Oct. 22) included
an advertisement that I found to be
not in keeping with The Daily's
reputation for good taste. The ad
vertisement was for sperm donors.
The requests of the sponsor include
several implied and outright state
ments of racism and disconcern for
human morality that I suggest this
newspaper discontinue to print. The
advertisement specifically asks for a
complete set of attributes akin to
Hitler's "master race." In fact, if the
person possessing all of the qualities
were to show up, he wrwld be bound
for greatness had the Germans won
the war. But this could be justified if
the sponsors were identical to this
description. The greatest problem 1
see with this advertisement is the
following comment after the exten
sive physical requirements:
If the tests are Unsatisfactory, this
pregnancy will be terminated and
'repeat' services will be required from
the same Donors.
Does The Daily really condone
that Stanford students should be
bred like race horses? Should the
beginnings of "Future Shock" be
right here at Stanford University?
Don't get me wrong â€” I don't
oppose the idea that parents in such
a situation deserve the chance to
have their own baby through artifi
cial insemination. The cavalier atti
tude in which the parents are willing
to terminate pregnancy if things are
not going as well as they may desire
and the ideology behind the exact

specification of race and personal
attributes do not belong on the Stan
ford campus. This advertisement
takes the whole situation a step too
far and I ask that you re-evaluate
your decision to include it in The
Daily. We should not be in the busi
ness of breeding people.

AuHiO absurdity
1 had hoped that after Sen. Barry
Goldwater (R-Ariz.) had brought up
the old argument that the Demo
cratic Party has been in office each
time the United States has become
involved in a war in the 20th cen
tury, and by implication is
responsible for each of these wars,
that the "issue" would be dropped.
But no. Richard Frisk (The Daily,
Oct. 22) seems to agree with this
absurd notion. I remind the Stanford
community of the 1976 vice
presidential debate between Sen.
Robert Dole (R-Kansas) and then
Sen. (soon to be President) Walter
Mondale. In that debate. Dole tried
the same argument about
Democratic wars. Vice President
Mondale hit that one out of the park
the way he did Reagan's, "There you
go again" line. He said, "Surely Sen.
Dole doesn't meant to imply that the
war against Nazi Germany was a
partisan cause?"
Perhaps Frisk does. Perhaps he
and the Republican Party would
have had the United States let Japan
proceed from Pearl Harbor onto the

California coast. I suppose that he
and his holier than thou party would
have minded had we allowed South
Korea "to fall to Communism." As
political satirist Mark Russell has
said, "I can understand pardoning
Nixon, but Hitler?"

Don't bust Reagan
Some things need to be said in
regard to your editorial "Reagan will
be Reagan" (The Daily, Oct. 22). To
begin with, it is time that some mis
conceptions of the space-weapons
system be corrected. The "Star
Wars" defense is just that, a defen
sive system. President Reagan does
not have a clear idea of how it works
because it is only theory and not a
definite reality as of yet. It is not a
weapons system as Walter Mondale
seemed to express in the debate
Sunday. This shows Mondale's own
lack of knowledge of the proposal.
Now, the deficiencies of Mondale's
stance, which The Daily conveniently
avoided, need to be explored.
First of all, while Mondale said the
Star Wars system would lead to an
arms buildup, his own mobile
Midgetman proposal would be far
more dangerous. By making our
missiles impossible to locate, we will
incite much more paranoia in the
Soviet leadership than a possible
space defense system would. This
paranoia would lead to a full-scale
arms race. While Reagan's plan
might be theory, Mondale's proposal

is feasible and far more provocative.
As to his brilliant "quarantine"
idea, Mondale again would set the
stage for conflict. By naively leaving
Nicaragua alone as long as they are
good, Mondale will have little choice
but to take drastic, catch-up action
when the Sandinistas, no longer
pressured, return to their subversive
ways. Mondale's reliance on sudden
recourse would drastically increase
the chance of war.
In the field of American-Soviet
relations, Mondale again shows his
naivete. His proposal for yearly
summits is an excellent example.
Summits are only staged when there
is a definite possibility for progress.
Summits held simply because it is
"that time of the year again" are not
for progress, they are for
propaganda. In arms control,
Mondale is quick to show that
Reagan has not negotiated a treaty,
but let us remember that the pact
Mondale helped to formulate, SALT
11, was so poor that even his own
party, which controlled the Senate at
the time, rejected it. Rushing into a
foolish pact carries much more dan
ger than holding out for optimum
terms. Finally, let Democrats recall
that several of the stances of the
supposedly liberal stalwart Mondale
were further right than Ronald
Reagan's. In the debate, Mondale
was Mondale. To elect such a man,
naive and idealistic, would be unfor
tunate, perhaps even catastrophic.
Luckily, Reagan was Reagan.
