## 'Witness': sympathies out of experience 
### KEN MILLER Charles Clements, M. D 
"Witness to War: an American
Doctor in El Salvador"

Bantam hardcover, $15.95
The peasant woman had been in
labor for 24 hours, and her contrac
tions were now coming every five
minutes. Her strength and spirit were
spent. The doctor, summoned at
night, had followed the woman's
uncle carefully and silently for an
hour's hike up the steep slopes of the
Guazapa volcano to the woman's vil
lage; silently, for barely a stone's
throw away camped the government
troops who would invade in a few
days.
The doctor prepared a mix of
sugar, salt and lemon juice to buy the
woman some strength and a few pre-

Clements spent the year March 1982-
March 1983 working as the only
civilian doctor for 9,000 civilians and
1,000 guerrillas of Guazapa, a
guerrilla-controlled area of El Sal
vador.

cious moments of rest. When she
awoke, he made a birthing chair out
of a few boards. Midwife, uncle, doc
tor and mother worked together, and
the baby soon began to emerge. Just
as it was born, the ground began to
shake. It was an earthquake. The
doctor clamped the umbilical cord,
and mother and newborn were pulled
onto a bed under a roofbeam as
adobe bricks fell. When the first
tremors had passed, the umbilical
cord was cut and all rushed out of the
house before aftershocks could trap
them. There, in the mud and the rain
and fhe swaying earth, the midwife
helped the woman deliver the
placenta, and the mother held her
newborn daughter for the first time.
This was one of the hopeful mo
ments in a year both inspiring and
grueling for Dr. Charlie Clements.
Clements spent the year March 1982-
March 1983 working as the only civil
ian doctor for 9,000 civilians and
1,000 guerrillas of Guazapa, a 200-
square-mile, guerrilla-controlled area
of El Salvador. Clements, who will be
speaking at Stanford Friday night,
was and is committed to maintaining
medical neutrality, acting as a non
violent observer and a healer. In
"Witness to War" he reports his ex
periences as he comes to know the
lives of the people who live under
guerrilla authority.
Charlie Clements grew up in an Air
Force family, was a Distinguished
Graduate of the U.S. Air Force
Academy, and flew more than 50
combat missions in Vietnam before

disillusionment with the war con
vinced him he could no longer partici
pate. He subsequently became a
Quaker, committed to non-violence
and the Quaker notion of an inner
light — a conscience — as a person's
highest authority.
Clement's first contact with the war
in El Salvador came as he served a
year of residency at the County
Hospital in Salinas, California in
1980. The influx of Salvadoran
refugees fleeing the violence had
begun — currently it's estimated that
1 in 4 Salvadorans are refugees,
nearly half of whom live in the United
States. Clements began to see his first
evidence of torture: the mutilated
breasts, the infected genitals, the tales
of horror at the hands of the govern
ment police. As the Reagan adminis
tration's military commitment to that

government escalated, Clements
began to see another Vietnam in the
making: "If I had the courage of my
convictions, I was obliged to search
for a way to prevent such a tragedy.
. . . There is always a need for healing
in the midst of so much suffering, al
ways a place to bear witness in the
midst of injustice." So began his odys
sey.
Clements gives us an intimate view
of day-to-day life in the guerrilla
controlled zones. We see intense
hunger and malnutrition, aggravated
when the government army succeeds
in destroying the crops before har
vest; air raids and periodic flights of
all civilians to avoid invading govern
ment troops; and an incredible lack of
basic medical supplies. Yet the popu
lation persists in living a life: growing
crops, distributing food, setting up a
health care system, working in
agricultural and fishery co-ops,
educating children, celebrating Mass.
The medics organize 16 clinics
throughout the region; Clements tries
to visit each every two weeks, seeing
50-100 patients at each clinic. Sur
gery with razor blades by candlelight,
suturing with dental floss, even giving
his own blood to a patient while he is
performing an operation, become al
most routine. Paper is scarce and
records almost nonexistent. The
medics succeed in healing, sometimes
almost miraculously; but Clements
also has to watch dozens of patients
die for lack of medication or ordinary
diagnostic equipment.
The gringo doctor has knowledge,

witness, reporting extraordinary

sympathies forming out of his
experiences.

if not equipment, but this is only half
the battle. He must also learn to put
his knowledge to use in the context of
the local culture. Janet, a local health
care leader, teaches Clements how
leadership is exercised by example.
To get a campesino (a peasant
farmer) to dig a latrine, you first must
persuade the local medics to dig one
for the clinic. When health workers
are taught that diarrhea kills because
of dehydration and are shown how to

mix a rehydrating mix of boiled
water, sugar and salt, they can take
the remedy into campensino homes
and demonstrate to the skeptical
mothers that this will indeed save
their babies.
We meet Federico, Janet's father,
a tenant farmer. He tells how the
community was organized by two
priests, who helped give the peasants
a sense of diginity, preaching non
violence and social justice. After one

priest and other local leaders were
killed, and the other priest was driven
into exile, people began to turn to
guerrilla tactics.
We see the diversity of life in the
guerrilla zones as we meet the 14
members of Federico's family, unus
ual in Guazapa because the entire
family is intact and because every
member is "incorporated' into the
work for a new society. Federico s
wife Isabel runs the house and leads
the local Women's Association. Janet
runs the health-care organization in
Guazapa's eastern sector, while
taking adult literacy classes at night.
A son is in charge of agricultural pro
duction in the same sector; his wile, a
seamstress, is in charge of the village
shop where hats, packs and uniforms
are sewn. Another son is away fight

schoolteacher. Two younger sons
belong to the local militia, which
defends the community. An uncle is a
leader of the local Christian Base
Community. (All but the guerrilla
were subsequently killed in an army
roundup and massacre of more than
100 civilian "leftist sympathizers" in
November 1983.)
Clements allows us to share his ex
periences, and we come to know
peasants, health workers, guerrillas.
But is Clements swept away by the
beauty of the many individuals he
encounters? Can he give us insight
into the more strategic questions be
hind U.S. involvement?
Clements expects to find Cuban,
Soviet or Nicaraguan advisers
somewhere. Yet he finds only a fierce
rejection of outside meddling. "This
is our revolution. If Che (Guevara)
himself were to appear here tomor
row, he wouldn't understand our
reality any better than we do," one
campesino says at a meeting. Cle
ments must contend with this attitude
himself: When he jokingly disparages
the Salvadoran national anthem, a
man curtly responds "We do not sing
the song for you, gringo."
Does the government have support
in other regions? Clements cannot
comment on this directly. But we see
government soldiers who are widely
regarded as cowards. They fight nine
to-five wars, playing their radios at
night so the guerrillas and civilians
can pass freely without accidentally
stumbling into them and forcing them
to fight. We see several POWs so

moved by what they have seen behind
guerrilla lines that they choose to stay
to fight as guerrillas at grave risk to
their families, rather than be released
to the Red Cross.
Americans are often confused by
the high turnout in Salvadoran elec
tions. Does this indicate endorsement
of the government? A simple expla
nation is that all Salvadorans must
have their identification booklets —
cedulas — stamped at each election.
Failure to do so can carry grave con
sequences. Clements tells of a woman
from Guazapa who was making a trip
to San Salvador. She was asked to
bring back diapers for the medics, to
be used as dressings. On the return
trip her bus was stopped and all
cedulas routinely checked by govern
ment soldiers. Hers lacked an elec
tion stamp. She was immediately

hauled off the bus. Her bags were
ransacked, the diapers found, and she
was dragged off to her death.
Clements remains a calm, clear wit
ness, reporting extraordinary experi
ences without polemic or rhetoric.
Though his sympathies become clear,
one sees these sympathies forming
out of, rather than coloring, his expe
riences. In the end, Clements must
endure a very personal struggle to
remain true to his neutral role as a
witness and healer; he will not carry a
weapon, he will not give military ad
vice. He is swept up in the daily life
and death, and yet he is an outsider:
"We do not sing the song for you,
gringo." It is not his battle.
The book is not flawless. Many
characters are encountered briefly
several times, and at times it is diffi
cult to remember who is who. At
times one feels Clements' pride in a
slightly uncomfortable way — he not
only knows more about medicine
than anyone else in Guazapa, but also
more about military strategy, security
and U.S. weaponry than mosl. But
these are slight and hardly detract
from the power and achievement of
this magnificent book.
Charlie Clements has given us the
deeply moving experience of one
man, in one extraordinary place,
during one year. In so doing, he has
brought back the testimony of a wit
ness to a world our current adminis
tration has committed itself to
destroy.

cious moments of rest. When she
awoke, he made a birthing chair out
of a few boards. Midwife, uncle, doc

the baby soon began to emerge. Just
as it was born, the ground began to
shake. It was an earthquake. The

and mother and newborn were pulled
onto a bed under a roofbeam as
adobe bricks fell. When the first
tremors had passed, the umbilical

house before aftershocks could trap
them. There, in the mud and the rain
and fhe swaying earth, the midwife
helped the woman deliver the
placenta, and the mother held her
newborn daughter for the first time.
This was one of the hopeful mo

grueling for Dr. Charlie Clements.
Clements spent the year March 1982-
March 1983 working as the only civil
ian doctor for 9,000 civilians and
1,000 guerrillas of Guazapa, a 200-
square-mile, guerrilla-controlled area
of El Salvador. Clements, who will be
speaking at Stanford Friday night,
was and is committed to maintaining
medical neutrality, acting as a non
violent observer and a healer. In
"Witness to War" he reports his ex
periences as he comes to know the
lives of the people who live under
guerrilla authority.
Charlie Clements grew up in an Air
Force family, was a Distinguished
Graduate of the U.S. Air Force
Academy, and flew more than 50
combat missions in Vietnam before

disillusionment with the war con
vinced him he could no longer partici
pate. He subsequently became a
Quaker, committed to non-violence
and the Quaker notion of an inner
light — a conscience — as a person's
highest authority.
Clement's first contact with the war
in El Salvador came as he served a
year of residency at the County
Hospital in Salinas, California in
1980. The influx of Salvadoran
refugees fleeing the violence had
begun — currently it's estimated that
1 in 4 Salvadorans are refugees,
nearly half of whom live in the United
States. Clements began to see his first
evidence of torture: the mutilated
breasts, the infected genitals, the tales
of horror at the hands of the govern
ment police. As the Reagan adminis
tration's military commitment to that

government escalated, Clements
began to see another Vietnam in the
making: "If I had the courage of my
convictions, I was obliged to search
for a way to prevent such a tragedy.
. . . There is always a need for healing
in the midst of so much suffering, al
ways a place to bear witness in the
midst of injustice." So began his odys
sey.
Clements gives us an intimate view
of day-to-day life in the guerrilla
controlled zones. We see intense
hunger and malnutrition, aggravated
when the government army succeeds
in destroying the crops before har
vest; air raids and periodic flights of
all civilians to avoid invading govern
ment troops; and an incredible lack of
basic medical supplies. Yet the popu
lation persists in living a life: growing
crops, distributing food, setting up a
health care system, working in
agricultural and fishery co-ops,
educating children, celebrating Mass.
The medics organize 16 clinics
throughout the region; Clements tries
to visit each every two weeks, seeing
50-100 patients at each clinic. Sur
gery with razor blades by candlelight,
suturing with dental floss, even giving
his own blood to a patient while he is
performing an operation, become al
most routine. Paper is scarce and
records almost nonexistent. The
medics succeed in healing, sometimes
almost miraculously; but Clements
also has to watch dozens of patients
die for lack of medication or ordinary
diagnostic equipment.
The gringo doctor has knowledge,

experiences.

if not equipment, but this is only half
the battle. He must also learn to put
his knowledge to use in the context of
the local culture. Janet, a local health
care leader, teaches Clements how
leadership is exercised by example.
To get a campesino (a peasant
farmer) to dig a latrine, you first must
persuade the local medics to dig one
for the clinic. When health workers
are taught that diarrhea kills because
of dehydration and are shown how to

mix a rehydrating mix of boiled
water, sugar and salt, they can take
the remedy into campensino homes
and demonstrate to the skeptical
mothers that this will indeed save
their babies.
We meet Federico, Janet's father,
a tenant farmer. He tells how the
community was organized by two
priests, who helped give the peasants
a sense of diginity, preaching non
violence and social justice. After one

priest and other local leaders were
killed, and the other priest was driven
into exile, people began to turn to
guerrilla tactics.
We see the diversity of life in the
guerrilla zones as we meet the 14
members of Federico's family, unus
ual in Guazapa because the entire
family is intact and because every
member is "incorporated' into the
work for a new society. Federico s
wife Isabel runs the house and leads
the local Women's Association. Janet
runs the health-care organization in
Guazapa's eastern sector, while
taking adult literacy classes at night.
A son is in charge of agricultural pro
duction in the same sector; his wile, a
seamstress, is in charge of the village
shop where hats, packs and uniforms
are sewn. Another son is away fight

belong to the local militia, which
defends the community. An uncle is a
leader of the local Christian Base
Community. (All but the guerrilla
were subsequently killed in an army
roundup and massacre of more than
100 civilian "leftist sympathizers" in
November 1983.)
Clements allows us to share his ex
periences, and we come to know
peasants, health workers, guerrillas.
But is Clements swept away by the
beauty of the many individuals he
encounters? Can he give us insight
into the more strategic questions be
hind U.S. involvement?
Clements expects to find Cuban,
Soviet or Nicaraguan advisers
somewhere. Yet he finds only a fierce
rejection of outside meddling. "This
is our revolution. If Che (Guevara)
himself were to appear here tomor
row, he wouldn't understand our
reality any better than we do," one
campesino says at a meeting. Cle
ments must contend with this attitude
himself: When he jokingly disparages
the Salvadoran national anthem, a
man curtly responds "We do not sing
the song for you, gringo."
Does the government have support
in other regions? Clements cannot
comment on this directly. But we see
government soldiers who are widely
regarded as cowards. They fight nine
to-five wars, playing their radios at
night so the guerrillas and civilians
can pass freely without accidentally
stumbling into them and forcing them
to fight. We see several POWs so

moved by what they have seen behind
guerrilla lines that they choose to stay
to fight as guerrillas at grave risk to
their families, rather than be released
to the Red Cross.
Americans are often confused by
the high turnout in Salvadoran elec
tions. Does this indicate endorsement
of the government? A simple expla
nation is that all Salvadorans must
have their identification booklets —
cedulas — stamped at each election.
Failure to do so can carry grave con
sequences. Clements tells of a woman
from Guazapa who was making a trip
to San Salvador. She was asked to
bring back diapers for the medics, to
be used as dressings. On the return
trip her bus was stopped and all
cedulas routinely checked by govern
ment soldiers. Hers lacked an elec
tion stamp. She was immediately

hauled off the bus. Her bags were
ransacked, the diapers found, and she
was dragged off to her death.
Clements remains a calm, clear wit
ness, reporting extraordinary experi
ences without polemic or rhetoric.
Though his sympathies become clear,
one sees these sympathies forming
out of, rather than coloring, his expe
riences. In the end, Clements must
endure a very personal struggle to
remain true to his neutral role as a
witness and healer; he will not carry a
weapon, he will not give military ad
vice. He is swept up in the daily life
and death, and yet he is an outsider:
"We do not sing the song for you,
gringo." It is not his battle.
The book is not flawless. Many
characters are encountered briefly
several times, and at times it is diffi
cult to remember who is who. At
times one feels Clements' pride in a
slightly uncomfortable way — he not
only knows more about medicine
than anyone else in Guazapa, but also
more about military strategy, security
and U.S. weaponry than mosl. But
these are slight and hardly detract
from the power and achievement of
this magnificent book.
Charlie Clements has given us the
deeply moving experience of one
man, in one extraordinary place,
during one year. In so doing, he has
brought back the testimony of a wit
ness to a world our current adminis
tration has committed itself to
destroy.

cious moments of rest. When she
awoke, he made a birthing chair out
of a few boards. Midwife, uncle, doc
tor and mother worked together, and
the baby soon began to emerge. Just
as it was born, the ground began to
shake. It was an earthquake. The
doctor clamped the umbilical cord,
and mother and newborn were pulled
onto a bed under a roofbeam as
adobe bricks fell. When the first
tremors had passed, the umbilical
cord was cut and all rushed out of the
house before aftershocks could trap
them. There, in the mud and the rain
and fhe swaying earth, the midwife
helped the woman deliver the
placenta, and the mother held her
newborn daughter for the first time.
This was one of the hopeful mo
ments in a year both inspiring and
grueling for Dr. Charlie Clements.
Clements spent the year March 1982-
March 1983 working as the only civil
ian doctor for 9,000 civilians and
1,000 guerrillas of Guazapa, a 200-
square-mile, guerrilla-controlled area
of El Salvador. Clements, who will be
speaking at Stanford Friday night,
was and is committed to maintaining
medical neutrality, acting as a non
violent observer and a healer. In
"Witness to War" he reports his ex
periences as he comes to know the
lives of the people who live under
guerrilla authority.
Charlie Clements grew up in an Air
Force family, was a Distinguished
Graduate of the U.S. Air Force
Academy, and flew more than 50
combat missions in Vietnam before

disillusionment with the war con
vinced him he could no longer partici
pate. He subsequently became a
Quaker, committed to non-violence
and the Quaker notion of an inner
light — a conscience — as a person's
highest authority.
Clement's first contact with the war
in El Salvador came as he served a
year of residency at the County
Hospital in Salinas, California in
1980. The influx of Salvadoran
refugees fleeing the violence had
begun — currently it's estimated that
1 in 4 Salvadorans are refugees,
nearly half of whom live in the United
States. Clements began to see his first
evidence of torture: the mutilated
breasts, the infected genitals, the tales
of horror at the hands of the govern
ment police. As the Reagan adminis
tration's military commitment to that

government escalated, Clements
began to see another Vietnam in the
making: "If I had the courage of my
convictions, I was obliged to search
for a way to prevent such a tragedy.
. . . There is always a need for healing
in the midst of so much suffering, al
ways a place to bear witness in the
midst of injustice." So began his odys
sey.
Clements gives us an intimate view
of day-to-day life in the guerrilla
controlled zones. We see intense
hunger and malnutrition, aggravated
when the government army succeeds
in destroying the crops before har
vest; air raids and periodic flights of
all civilians to avoid invading govern
ment troops; and an incredible lack of
basic medical supplies. Yet the popu
lation persists in living a life: growing
crops, distributing food, setting up a
health care system, working in
agricultural and fishery co-ops,
educating children, celebrating Mass.
The medics organize 16 clinics
throughout the region; Clements tries
to visit each every two weeks, seeing
50-100 patients at each clinic. Sur
gery with razor blades by candlelight,
suturing with dental floss, even giving
his own blood to a patient while he is
performing an operation, become al
most routine. Paper is scarce and
records almost nonexistent. The
medics succeed in healing, sometimes
almost miraculously; but Clements
also has to watch dozens of patients
die for lack of medication or ordinary
diagnostic equipment.
The gringo doctor has knowledge,

witness, reporting extraordinary

become clear, one sees these
sympathies forming out of his
experiences.

if not equipment, but this is only half
the battle. He must also learn to put
his knowledge to use in the context of
the local culture. Janet, a local health
care leader, teaches Clements how
leadership is exercised by example.
To get a campesino (a peasant
farmer) to dig a latrine, you first must
persuade the local medics to dig one
for the clinic. When health workers
are taught that diarrhea kills because
of dehydration and are shown how to

mix a rehydrating mix of boiled
water, sugar and salt, they can take
the remedy into campensino homes
and demonstrate to the skeptical
mothers that this will indeed save
their babies.
We meet Federico, Janet's father,
a tenant farmer. He tells how the
community was organized by two
priests, who helped give the peasants
a sense of diginity, preaching non
violence and social justice. After one

priest and other local leaders were
killed, and the other priest was driven
into exile, people began to turn to
guerrilla tactics.
We see the diversity of life in the
guerrilla zones as we meet the 14
members of Federico's family, unus
ual in Guazapa because the entire
family is intact and because every
member is "incorporated' into the
work for a new society. Federico s
wife Isabel runs the house and leads
the local Women's Association. Janet
runs the health-care organization in
Guazapa's eastern sector, while
taking adult literacy classes at night.
A son is in charge of agricultural pro
duction in the same sector; his wile, a
seamstress, is in charge of the village
shop where hats, packs and uniforms
are sewn. Another son is away fight

schoolteacher. Two younger sons
belong to the local militia, which
defends the community. An uncle is a
leader of the local Christian Base
Community. (All but the guerrilla
were subsequently killed in an army
roundup and massacre of more than
100 civilian "leftist sympathizers" in
November 1983.)
Clements allows us to share his ex
periences, and we come to know
peasants, health workers, guerrillas.
But is Clements swept away by the
beauty of the many individuals he
encounters? Can he give us insight
into the more strategic questions be
hind U.S. involvement?
Clements expects to find Cuban,
Soviet or Nicaraguan advisers
somewhere. Yet he finds only a fierce
rejection of outside meddling. "This
is our revolution. If Che (Guevara)
himself were to appear here tomor
row, he wouldn't understand our
reality any better than we do," one
campesino says at a meeting. Cle
ments must contend with this attitude
himself: When he jokingly disparages
the Salvadoran national anthem, a
man curtly responds "We do not sing
the song for you, gringo."
Does the government have support
in other regions? Clements cannot
comment on this directly. But we see
government soldiers who are widely
regarded as cowards. They fight nine
to-five wars, playing their radios at
night so the guerrillas and civilians
can pass freely without accidentally
stumbling into them and forcing them
to fight. We see several POWs so

moved by what they have seen behind
guerrilla lines that they choose to stay
to fight as guerrillas at grave risk to
their families, rather than be released
to the Red Cross.
Americans are often confused by
the high turnout in Salvadoran elec
tions. Does this indicate endorsement
of the government? A simple expla
nation is that all Salvadorans must
have their identification booklets —
cedulas — stamped at each election.
Failure to do so can carry grave con
sequences. Clements tells of a woman
from Guazapa who was making a trip
to San Salvador. She was asked to
bring back diapers for the medics, to
be used as dressings. On the return
trip her bus was stopped and all
cedulas routinely checked by govern
ment soldiers. Hers lacked an elec
tion stamp. She was immediately

hauled off the bus. Her bags were
ransacked, the diapers found, and she
was dragged off to her death.
Clements remains a calm, clear wit
ness, reporting extraordinary experi
ences without polemic or rhetoric.
Though his sympathies become clear,
one sees these sympathies forming
out of, rather than coloring, his expe
riences. In the end, Clements must
endure a very personal struggle to
remain true to his neutral role as a
witness and healer; he will not carry a
weapon, he will not give military ad
vice. He is swept up in the daily life
and death, and yet he is an outsider:
"We do not sing the song for you,
gringo." It is not his battle.
The book is not flawless. Many
characters are encountered briefly
several times, and at times it is diffi
cult to remember who is who. At
times one feels Clements' pride in a
slightly uncomfortable way — he not
only knows more about medicine
than anyone else in Guazapa, but also
more about military strategy, security
and U.S. weaponry than mosl. But
these are slight and hardly detract
from the power and achievement of
this magnificent book.
Charlie Clements has given us the
deeply moving experience of one
man, in one extraordinary place,
during one year. In so doing, he has
brought back the testimony of a wit
ness to a world our current adminis
tration has committed itself to
destroy.

The peasant woman had been in

minutes. Her strength and spirit were
