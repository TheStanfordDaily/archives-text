"So we set off together anew
Spinning through life, just me and
you
And we whirl through life this way
Embracing till this day
Embracing till this day."
- Bassiak, "Le Tourbillon" ("The
Whirlwind"), sung by Jeanne Moreau
in "Jules and Jim"
Francois Truffaut's "Jules and
Jim," which he brought out in 1961

(and in this country in 1962),
represented the lyrical peak of the
New Wave movement — a movement
with which he had been associated in
fact since 1955, when he turned from
writing criticism for the highly
respected Cahiers du Cinema to
directing, and publicly since his first
full-length feature, "The 400 Blows,"
four years later.
Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and the
other New Wave pioneers (Jacques
Rivette, Claude Chabrol and Alain

Resnais among them), challenged by
the new intellectual demands put on
directors and moviegoers by the critic
Andre Bazin, had sought to vivify
French cinema, stagnant since the
war, by combining a fresh, outdoors,
wide-open cinematographic style —
the legacy of Jean Renoir — with a
jazzy, modernist approach to editing.
In the two most astonishing early
New Wave works, Godard's
"Breathless" (1959) and Truffaut's


Francois Truffaut with Jeanne Moreau during the filming of "Jules and Jim."
"Shoot the Piano Player" (1960), the direc
tors spun off the pictures they had reveled in
as movie-mad youths in the 1940s and early
'50s, when their countrymen disappointed
them: the American gangster melodramas.
And then they moved off in radically different
directions. Godard created, through 1968, a
series of intellectually bracing and stylistically
astonishing contemporary pieces, the best of
them (like "Band of Outsiders" and
"Masculine Feminine") as resolutely lyrical as
they were witty. Truffaut, on the other hand,
stuck to narrative film, leaving the Brechtian
experiments to Godard, and he soon proved
that the incisiveness and economy of the New
Wave could produce period pieces, too — and

not only period pieces, but expansive, roman
tic, humanistic films to compare with Renoir's
and Max Ophul's. That is, he gave us "Jules
and Jim."
Between 1961 and his untimely death Sun
day at the age of 52, Francois Truffaut di
rected 18 more movies, but "Jules and Jim"
was his masterpiece. Set in France in the
1910s and '20s, it chronicled the relationship
of a vivacious, self-destructive woman, Cath
erine (Jeanne Moreau, in what remains her
greatest performance), to two young suitors
(Oskar Werner and Henri Serre). They adore
her so much that they are willing to share her,
and so, through the years, she alternates be
tween them, often infuriating them but always
defining their lives; they cannot conceive of
themselves without her. In "Jules and Jim"
Truffaut, adapting a disguised autobiography
by Henri-Pierre Roche, infused a fiercely
cinematic exploration of a folie a trois with a
novelistic complexity and sophistication. Seen

today, it strikes us as the most remarkable
film achievement of the 19605.
Everyone has his favorite Truffauts; mine,

Itard's document about the boy, one of the
key socio-political works of the 18th century,
defends reason and humanism — two forces
Truffaut stood behind in his most memorable
films.

in addition to "Jules and Jim," include "The
400 Blows," "Shoot the Piano Player," "The
Wild Child," and two mostly neglected
pictures, "Two English Girls" (based on
Roche's only other novel) and"The Story of

Adele H." "Adele H." (1975) is, I believe,
his best film after "Jules and Jim" — a Dos
toevskian account of a woman whose passion

for a young man in every way beneath her
transcends the paltriness of the affair itself
and becomes its own raison d'etre. (Adele is
the daughter of Victor Hugo, and her insis
tence on taking up with a young English

lieutenant is meant on one level as a slap in
her father's celebrated face; the irony that
escapes her is that she ends up concocting a
romantic fiction worthy of her father's pen.)
Truffaut made a number of inferior films,
among them several of the frothy comedies he
was most popular for, but in his grandest mo
ments he could create something like "Adele
H." or "The Wild Child," in which he played
the leading role. "The Wild Child" is the story
of the Wild Boy of Aveyron, raised by forest
beasts, captured and then tutored by the great
French humanist Jean Itard. Itard's document
about the boy, one of the key socio-political
works of the 18th century, defends reason and
humanism — two forces Truffaut stood be
hind in his most memorable films. Watching
him actually playing Itard, you think you're
seeing double, and perhaps now, in the sad af
termath of his death, audiences will turn once
more to "The Wild Child" for a final vision of
Francois Truffaut.
