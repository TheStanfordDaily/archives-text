"So we set off together anew
Spinning through life, just me and
you
And we whirl through life this way
Embracing till this day
Embracing till this day."
- Bassiak, "Le Tourbillon" ("The
Whirlwind"), sung by Jeanne Moreau
in "Jules and Jim"
Francois Truffaut's "Jules and
Jim," which he brought out in 1961

(and in this country in 1962),
represented the lyrical peak of the
New Wave movement — a movement
with which he had been associated in
fact since 1955, when he turned from
writing criticism for the highly
respected Cahiers du Cinema to
directing, and publicly since his first
full-length feature, "The 400 Blows,"
four years later.
Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and the
other New Wave pioneers (Jacques
Rivette, Claude Chabrol and Alain

Resnais among them), challenged by
the new intellectual demands put on
directors and moviegoers by the critic
Andre Bazin, had sought to vivify
French cinema, stagnant since the
war, by combining a fresh, outdoors,
wide-open cinematographic style —
the legacy of Jean Renoir — with a
jazzy, modernist approach to editing.
In the two most astonishing early
New Wave works, Godard's
"Breathless" (1959) and Truffaut's


Francois Truffaut with Jeanne Moreau during the filming of "Jules and Jim."
