KZSU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tonight at 6
The rating scale is one to five stars.

Talking Heads — Stop Making Sense ★ ★ ★ l /i
First of all, "Burning Down the House," the Stan
ford Community's Pet Song of 1983-84, is virtually un
changed. In fact, with the exception of a few tracks
such as "Psycho Killer," most of the songs on this con
cert album are just live rehashes of their studio ver
sions. This is too bad, because when the Heads do oc
casionally experiment, they transform once-familiar
songs into voyages into the unknown, and the
creativity they exhibit changes an otherwise run-of
the-mill collection into something special. The produc
tion and sound quality are excellent for a live release,
and all the instruments retain the kick they have in the
studio. But the overall flavor of the record gets a bit
stale by the end; the instruments seem layered over
each other instead of integrated into an artistic whole,
and improvisation rarely attains the sophistication that
makes it worthwhile. And the most exciting element in
a live recording, audience-performer interplay, is mys
teriously missing here. But overall, "Stop Making
Sense" is a reasonably challenging and creative collec
tion which delivers more hype than inspiration.

XTC — The Big Express ★ ★ Vi
XTC has consistently experimented with every one
of their seven albums — and some results turn out bet
ter than others. We just can't figure out the point of
"The Big Express." Some of the songs are attractive
enough to receive some airplay — their accessible pop
is rejuvenated by various other styles and ends up
unique and refreshed. Others, however, seem to
merely pound relentlessly with no apparent structure
or melodic content. And where previous XTC lyrics
dealt artistically and effectively with real-life issues,
here the band seems to be putting clever syntax before
real meaning or clarity. At times Andy Partridge's
rambling becomes almost intolerable, and even hard
ened reviewers (and fans) like us feel like turning him
off. This all-around lack of appeal is downright
depressing considering the merit of XTC's earlier
releases such as "Mummer" or "English Settlement."
If XTC must incorporate different styles and textures
into its pop, why can't it perfect the mixture before it
releases it to the public?

ÜB4O — Geffery Morgan ★ ★ ★ V2
Reggae, Jamaica's second major export, now
stretches between pure, unretouched ethnicity to
polished, commercial pop — but its infectious rhythms
and simple melodies mean a plethora of good, easy
skanking for Bob Marley fans and Police fans alike.
And in between is ÜB4O, an English-speaking but
Jamaican-sounding group that incorporates "modern"
instruments into its basic reggae formula to accommo
date both progressive and traditional followers.
"Geffery Morgan" delivers forty minutes of good
feelings and satisfaction, though this album's quantity
and consistency are nowhere near the classic "Labour
of Love," where the group covered the reggae anthems
they had loved since their youth. ÜB4O tends to ar
range everything the same way, and though its crea
tive segues and introductions distinguish each song
from the others, all the songs have a similar basic
structure which gets tiring after a while. "Geffery Mor
gan" is not an ideal introduction to ÜB4o's music, but
it is a solid effort worthy of some attention.
