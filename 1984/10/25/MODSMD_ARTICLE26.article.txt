# 'Drummer Girl' lacks imagination
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
The disastrous errors filmmakers
have made recently in attempting to
transcribe great literature to the
screen are understandable, if not al
ways forgivable, but it's more difficult
to see why director George Roy Hill
and screenwriter Loring Mandel
failed to turn John Le Carre's spy en
tertainment "The Little Drummer
Girl" into a good movie. Surely they
Wouldn't have misread the novel? It's
not exactly Malcolm Lowry or Henry
James. But it's a compelling thriller,
despite Le Carre's sometime affecta
tions and the excessive length (no spy
novel should run to 515 pages), be
cause the familiar thematic ground —
the realm in which reality and fantasy
'intersect — is trod by an enthralling
Character, Charlie, an actress enlisted
by a company of Israelis to help them
'infiltrate a Palestinian terrorist group.
Charlie is a chronic political and
emotional malcontent whose
tentative association with a number
of left-wing causes may represent a
serious quarrel with the injustices of
the society she lives in (she is British),

The whole movie has a thick, lethargic
feeling to it, as if Hill and his crew had
spent too much time on location and
brought back too much footage for the
editor, William Reynolds, to
shape. . . . Somehow Hill missed the
key to Le Carre's craftsmanship.

or an outgrowth of her sexual in
volvement with an activist actor, or it
may simply provide an outlet for her
restless, aggressive spirit. A gifted
performer with an unexciting but not
unsuccessful career, she has rewritten
her own childhood in an effort to etch
an image for herself and then learned
it so well that she half believes the fic
tion. The Israelis wish to channel all
these qualities — her restlessness, her
•compassion for underdog causes
(though in fact she has lately been at
tending "revolutionary training ses
sion" given by Palestinian sympa
thizers), and most of all her
believability on stage — into a single
role. They want her to pose as the
lover of a handsome young terrorist,
Michel, whom they have captured
and plan to kill — and then as the
young woman in mourning who, out
of devotion to her dead sweetheart's
politics and fury toward his enemies,
joins the Palestinians herself.
In Charlie, romantic passion and a
passion for acting — acting that
fosters an almost neurotic commit
ment to a part — overlap. Charlie
falls in love with the Israeli who

recruits her; in fact, having studied
her personality, the anti-terrorist
team has set up a romance to lure her
in. And it is this man, whom she has
named "Joseph," who serves as her
tutor, standing in for the real Michel
as together they concoct a text of
"memories" for her to draw on when
she encounters the real Arabs.
Charlie, whose consciousness pro
vides the narrative voice for most of
the book, calls the assignment "the
theater of the real," and this paradox,
working on the mind of a woman
already prone to emotional overin
volvements of various kinds, gives
"The Little Drummer Girl" its en
ergy on the page. Le Carre takes the
concept of the double agent to its
logical extreme by making this one a
professional actress, and then il
lustrates how spies and actors are
really different by showing us the psy
chological effect of "the theater of
the real" on Charlie.
The casting of the central role
sounded promising: Diane Keaton,
whose last two performances (in
"Reds" and especially in "Shoot the
Moon") were enormously risky and

finally extraordinary. (One should
really go beyond that to describe
what Keaton accomplished as the dis
enchanted wife in "Shoot the Moon":
It was the best performance an
American actress had given in more
than a decade.) Keaton is too old and
too American to play an English
stage performer in her twenties, but a
slight adjustment on Mandel's part
takes care of the second problem
(Charlie came over to London to
study at the Royal Academy of Dra
matic Art and stayed), and it would
have taken little invention to tidy up
the first as well. But apparently no
one in on the filming volunteered
any, so we face an uncomfortable mo
ment when Charlie tells the (fake)
autobiographical story of her fathers
bankruptcy 10 years earlier during
her adolescence, and though her Is
raeli audience challenges her other
"facts," no one suggests that she
couldn't possibly have aged 20 or 25
years in a decade. I point out this
minor inconsistency merely to under
score the dull-wittedness and lack of
imagination of the people who made
"The Little Drummer Girl," which

botches Charlie's story and botches
the spy thriller elements in Le Carre
as well.
Diane Keaton, martyred by yet an
other dreadful hairstyle (spaghetti
curls that hang too low in back but
not low enough on the side, so that
when she wears earrings everything
seems to be hanging off her like orna
ments on a Christmas tree, and when
she doesn't her ears stick out like
Peter Pan's), is playing Shaw's "Saint
Joan" when Joseph (Yorgo Voyagis)
first appears to her. In order for the
narrative strategy of the movie to
work. Charlie should be brilliant as
Joan, or at least have a special
quality. But what we see of her in the
last moments of the epilogue doesn't
convince us that anyone would hire
her to convince a crew of bombers
that she wants to join their ranks.
(Later, she tells Joseph she scored
hits as Jo in "A Taste of Honey" and
Laura in "A Glass Menagerie" —
hardly roles one would choose for
Diane Keaton.) Similarly, her
"performance" as the embittered
child of a bankrupt father in her ac
count of herself to the Israelis doesn't
ring true for a moment; Keaton
seems to want us to register that she's
lying.
And so from the outset we retain
our distance from Charlie's role
playing, and in fact Keaton never

bridges that distance. Much of this is
not her fault. Yorgo Voyagis doesn't
have the commanding, ambiguous
presence to carry off the scenes in
which he and Charlie manufacture
her affair with Michel, and these
scenes form the basis of Charlie's
emotional/theatrical tie to both the
world of the Israelis, symbolized by a
man she wants to think of as her
lover, and the world of the Pales
tinians, allegedly introduced to her by
a lover who never existed.
In fact, Voyagis has such standard
movie Arab looks that Charlie's im
mediate fascination with him may
strike us as a little bewildering (it cer
tainly puts her imaginative faculties in
doubt), and he has such a limited per
sonality that we can't comprehend
why she falls so deeply in love with
him. Therefore we're always in the
dark about Charlie's decision to take
on this dangerous role; it seems will
fully self-destructive, and that can't
have been the filmmakers' intention.
Sami Frey, who plays the Palestinian
chief (Michel's older brother) to
whose bed Charlie eventually gains
access, has a far more intriguing
sexual forcefulness on camera (and
that mostly accounts for the tension
in their scenes together.)
Keaton doesn't give a bad perfor
mance, just a disappointing one; she

saves all her best marbles for the last
10 minutes of the film, at which point
it's too late to make sense out of what
she's doing (unless you've read the
book). We wait and wait for the
Pirandellian twists in Charlie's char
acter to surface, but she sticks to a
fairly frontal approach to a woman
caught in a perilous espionage plot.
George Roy Hill not only refuses
to direct her to take advantage of the
possibilities in the material; he actu
ally sabotages them on several occa
sions. When the Israelis (led by Klaus
Kinski in a surprisingly lively perfor
mance) exhibit the captured, drugged
Michel to Charlie as part of her role
preparation, Hill fixes his camera on
the limp, naked body as Kinski points
out all its distinguishing features.
Why doesn't he forget Michel and
show us Charlie's response to the ob
jectification of the attractive boy,
sentenced to death, who's supposed
to be her inamorato? And when an
accessory member of the Palestinian
group, Helga (Kerstin de Ahna, who
foolishly plays her like a Nazi), in
forms her of Michel's death. Hill robs
us of the opportunity to see how
Charlie will act the role of the griev
ing lover by cutting away to the busy
Israelis listening in on their exchange.
He makes the same mistake over and
over again — he doesn't appear to
know how to locate the most interest

ing dramatic focus.
I've never been a George Roy Hill
fan, but he usually rises to the occa
sion when he's adapting a novel he
cares about — "Hawaii" or (in
places) "Slaughterhouse Five" and
"The World According to Garp." But
the dramatic logic of "The Little
Drummer Girl" evidently eluded
him, because even the suspense in it
never takes hold: He cuts to the Is
raelis so often that we don't have to
worry about whether they'll be in
time to save Charlie in the event of an
emergency, and he and Mandel an
ticipate plot developments that Le
Carre wisely holds back and then
springs as little surprises. The whole
movie has a thick, lethargic feeling to
it, as if Hill and his crew had spent too
much time on location and brought
back too much footage for the editor,
William Reynolds, to shape. (It cer
tainly goes on a good half hour too
long.) Somehow Hill missed the key
to Le Carre's craftsmanship: In his
novel character creates suspense,
since Charlie's commitment to each
of her roles gives them both a chilling
authenticity, and Le Carre refuses to
get ahead of her when she confronts
each loaded situation. Hill tries to
divide character and suspense up, as
though he were directing two movies
in a single package, and then he can't
make either of them work.


Involved over her head with PLO terrorists, Charlie (Diane Keaton) learns to take apart and assemble a gun in "Little Drummer Girl."

spent too much time on location and
brought back too much footage for the
editor, William Reynolds, to
shape. . . . Somehow Hill missed the
key to Le Carre's craftsmanship.

or an outgrowth of her sexual in
volvement with an activist actor, or it
may simply provide an outlet for her
restless, aggressive spirit. A gifted
performer with an unexciting but not
unsuccessful career, she has rewritten
her own childhood in an effort to etch
an image for herself and then learned
it so well that she half believes the fic
tion. The Israelis wish to channel all
these qualities — her restlessness, her
•compassion for underdog causes
(though in fact she has lately been at
tending "revolutionary training ses
sion" given by Palestinian sympa
thizers), and most of all her
believability on stage — into a single
role. They want her to pose as the
lover of a handsome young terrorist,
Michel, whom they have captured
and plan to kill — and then as the
young woman in mourning who, out
of devotion to her dead sweetheart's
politics and fury toward his enemies,
joins the Palestinians herself.
In Charlie, romantic passion and a
passion for acting — acting that
fosters an almost neurotic commit
ment to a part — overlap. Charlie
falls in love with the Israeli who

recruits her; in fact, having studied
her personality, the anti-terrorist
team has set up a romance to lure her
in. And it is this man, whom she has
named "Joseph," who serves as her
tutor, standing in for the real Michel
as together they concoct a text of
"memories" for her to draw on when
she encounters the real Arabs.
Charlie, whose consciousness pro
vides the narrative voice for most of
the book, calls the assignment "the
theater of the real," and this paradox,
working on the mind of a woman
already prone to emotional overin
volvements of various kinds, gives
"The Little Drummer Girl" its en
ergy on the page. Le Carre takes the
concept of the double agent to its
logical extreme by making this one a
professional actress, and then il
lustrates how spies and actors are
really different by showing us the psy
chological effect of "the theater of
the real" on Charlie.
The casting of the central role
sounded promising: Diane Keaton,
whose last two performances (in
"Reds" and especially in "Shoot the
Moon") were enormously risky and

finally extraordinary. (One should
really go beyond that to describe
what Keaton accomplished as the dis
enchanted wife in "Shoot the Moon":
It was the best performance an
American actress had given in more
than a decade.) Keaton is too old and
too American to play an English
stage performer in her twenties, but a
slight adjustment on Mandel's part
takes care of the second problem
(Charlie came over to London to
study at the Royal Academy of Dra
matic Art and stayed), and it would
have taken little invention to tidy up
the first as well. But apparently no
one in on the filming volunteered
any, so we face an uncomfortable mo
ment when Charlie tells the (fake)
autobiographical story of her fathers
bankruptcy 10 years earlier during
her adolescence, and though her Is
raeli audience challenges her other
"facts," no one suggests that she
couldn't possibly have aged 20 or 25
years in a decade. I point out this
minor inconsistency merely to under
score the dull-wittedness and lack of
imagination of the people who made
"The Little Drummer Girl," which

botches Charlie's story and botches
the spy thriller elements in Le Carre
as well.
Diane Keaton, martyred by yet an
other dreadful hairstyle (spaghetti
curls that hang too low in back but
not low enough on the side, so that
when she wears earrings everything
seems to be hanging off her like orna
ments on a Christmas tree, and when
she doesn't her ears stick out like
Peter Pan's), is playing Shaw's "Saint
Joan" when Joseph (Yorgo Voyagis)
first appears to her. In order for the
narrative strategy of the movie to
work. Charlie should be brilliant as
Joan, or at least have a special
quality. But what we see of her in the
last moments of the epilogue doesn't
convince us that anyone would hire
her to convince a crew of bombers
that she wants to join their ranks.
(Later, she tells Joseph she scored
hits as Jo in "A Taste of Honey" and
Laura in "A Glass Menagerie" —
hardly roles one would choose for
Diane Keaton.) Similarly, her
"performance" as the embittered
child of a bankrupt father in her ac
count of herself to the Israelis doesn't
ring true for a moment; Keaton
seems to want us to register that she's
lying.
And so from the outset we retain
our distance from Charlie's role
playing, and in fact Keaton never

bridges that distance. Much of this is
not her fault. Yorgo Voyagis doesn't
have the commanding, ambiguous
presence to carry off the scenes in
which he and Charlie manufacture
her affair with Michel, and these
scenes form the basis of Charlie's
emotional/theatrical tie to both the
world of the Israelis, symbolized by a
man she wants to think of as her
lover, and the world of the Pales
tinians, allegedly introduced to her by
a lover who never existed.
In fact, Voyagis has such standard
movie Arab looks that Charlie's im
mediate fascination with him may
strike us as a little bewildering (it cer
tainly puts her imaginative faculties in
doubt), and he has such a limited per
sonality that we can't comprehend
why she falls so deeply in love with
him. Therefore we're always in the
dark about Charlie's decision to take
on this dangerous role; it seems will
fully self-destructive, and that can't
have been the filmmakers' intention.
Sami Frey, who plays the Palestinian
chief (Michel's older brother) to
whose bed Charlie eventually gains
access, has a far more intriguing
sexual forcefulness on camera (and
that mostly accounts for the tension
in their scenes together.)
Keaton doesn't give a bad perfor
mance, just a disappointing one; she

saves all her best marbles for the last
10 minutes of the film, at which point
it's too late to make sense out of what
she's doing (unless you've read the
book). We wait and wait for the
Pirandellian twists in Charlie's char
acter to surface, but she sticks to a
fairly frontal approach to a woman
caught in a perilous espionage plot.
George Roy Hill not only refuses
to direct her to take advantage of the
possibilities in the material; he actu
ally sabotages them on several occa
sions. When the Israelis (led by Klaus
Kinski in a surprisingly lively perfor
mance) exhibit the captured, drugged
Michel to Charlie as part of her role
preparation, Hill fixes his camera on
the limp, naked body as Kinski points
out all its distinguishing features.
Why doesn't he forget Michel and
show us Charlie's response to the ob
jectification of the attractive boy,
sentenced to death, who's supposed
to be her inamorato? And when an
accessory member of the Palestinian
group, Helga (Kerstin de Ahna, who
foolishly plays her like a Nazi), in
forms her of Michel's death. Hill robs
us of the opportunity to see how
Charlie will act the role of the griev
ing lover by cutting away to the busy
Israelis listening in on their exchange.
He makes the same mistake over and
over again — he doesn't appear to
know how to locate the most interest

ing dramatic focus.
I've never been a George Roy Hill
fan, but he usually rises to the occa
sion when he's adapting a novel he
cares about — "Hawaii" or (in
places) "Slaughterhouse Five" and
"The World According to Garp." But
the dramatic logic of "The Little
Drummer Girl" evidently eluded
him, because even the suspense in it
never takes hold: He cuts to the Is
raelis so often that we don't have to
worry about whether they'll be in
time to save Charlie in the event of an
emergency, and he and Mandel an
ticipate plot developments that Le
Carre wisely holds back and then
springs as little surprises. The whole
movie has a thick, lethargic feeling to
it, as if Hill and his crew had spent too
much time on location and brought
back too much footage for the editor,
William Reynolds, to shape. (It cer
tainly goes on a good half hour too
long.) Somehow Hill missed the key
to Le Carre's craftsmanship: In his
novel character creates suspense,
since Charlie's commitment to each
of her roles gives them both a chilling
authenticity, and Le Carre refuses to
get ahead of her when she confronts
each loaded situation. Hill tries to
divide character and suspense up, as
though he were directing two movies
in a single package, and then he can't
make either of them work.


Involved over her head with PLO terrorists, Charlie (Diane Keaton) learns to take apart and assemble a gun in "Little Drummer Girl."
The disastrous errors filmmakers
have made recently in attempting to

screen are understandable, if not al

to see why director George Roy Hill

passion for acting — acting that
fosters an almost neurotic commit
ment to a part — overlap. Charlie
falls in love with the Israeli who

recruits her; in fact, having studied
her personality, the anti-terrorist
team has set up a romance to lure her
in. And it is this man, whom she has
named "Joseph," who serves as her
tutor, standing in for the real Michel
as together they concoct a text of
"memories" for her to draw on when
she encounters the real Arabs.
Charlie, whose consciousness pro
vides the narrative voice for most of
the book, calls the assignment "the
theater of the real," and this paradox,
working on the mind of a woman
already prone to emotional overin
volvements of various kinds, gives
"The Little Drummer Girl" its en
ergy on the page. Le Carre takes the
concept of the double agent to its
logical extreme by making this one a
professional actress, and then il
lustrates how spies and actors are
really different by showing us the psy
chological effect of "the theater of
the real" on Charlie.
The casting of the central role
sounded promising: Diane Keaton,
whose last two performances (in
"Reds" and especially in "Shoot the
Moon") were enormously risky and

finally extraordinary. (One should
really go beyond that to describe
what Keaton accomplished as the dis
enchanted wife in "Shoot the Moon":
It was the best performance an
American actress had given in more
than a decade.) Keaton is too old and
too American to play an English
stage performer in her twenties, but a
slight adjustment on Mandel's part
takes care of the second problem
(Charlie came over to London to
study at the Royal Academy of Dra
matic Art and stayed), and it would
have taken little invention to tidy up
the first as well. But apparently no
one in on the filming volunteered
any, so we face an uncomfortable mo
ment when Charlie tells the (fake)
autobiographical story of her fathers
bankruptcy 10 years earlier during
her adolescence, and though her Is
raeli audience challenges her other
"facts," no one suggests that she
couldn't possibly have aged 20 or 25
years in a decade. I point out this
minor inconsistency merely to under
score the dull-wittedness and lack of
imagination of the people who made
"The Little Drummer Girl," which

botches Charlie's story and botches
the spy thriller elements in Le Carre
as well.
Diane Keaton, martyred by yet an
other dreadful hairstyle (spaghetti
curls that hang too low in back but
not low enough on the side, so that
when she wears earrings everything
seems to be hanging off her like orna
ments on a Christmas tree, and when
she doesn't her ears stick out like
Peter Pan's), is playing Shaw's "Saint
Joan" when Joseph (Yorgo Voyagis)
first appears to her. In order for the
narrative strategy of the movie to
work. Charlie should be brilliant as
Joan, or at least have a special
quality. But what we see of her in the
last moments of the epilogue doesn't
convince us that anyone would hire
her to convince a crew of bombers
that she wants to join their ranks.
(Later, she tells Joseph she scored
hits as Jo in "A Taste of Honey" and
Laura in "A Glass Menagerie" —
hardly roles one would choose for
Diane Keaton.) Similarly, her
"performance" as the embittered
child of a bankrupt father in her ac
count of herself to the Israelis doesn't
ring true for a moment; Keaton
seems to want us to register that she's
lying.
And so from the outset we retain
our distance from Charlie's role
playing, and in fact Keaton never

bridges that distance. Much of this is
not her fault. Yorgo Voyagis doesn't
have the commanding, ambiguous
presence to carry off the scenes in
which he and Charlie manufacture
her affair with Michel, and these
scenes form the basis of Charlie's
emotional/theatrical tie to both the
world of the Israelis, symbolized by a
man she wants to think of as her
lover, and the world of the Pales
tinians, allegedly introduced to her by
a lover who never existed.
In fact, Voyagis has such standard
movie Arab looks that Charlie's im
mediate fascination with him may
strike us as a little bewildering (it cer
tainly puts her imaginative faculties in
doubt), and he has such a limited per
sonality that we can't comprehend
why she falls so deeply in love with
him. Therefore we're always in the
dark about Charlie's decision to take
on this dangerous role; it seems will
fully self-destructive, and that can't
have been the filmmakers' intention.
Sami Frey, who plays the Palestinian
chief (Michel's older brother) to
whose bed Charlie eventually gains
access, has a far more intriguing
sexual forcefulness on camera (and
that mostly accounts for the tension
in their scenes together.)
Keaton doesn't give a bad perfor
mance, just a disappointing one; she

saves all her best marbles for the last
10 minutes of the film, at which point
it's too late to make sense out of what
she's doing (unless you've read the
book). We wait and wait for the
Pirandellian twists in Charlie's char
acter to surface, but she sticks to a
fairly frontal approach to a woman
caught in a perilous espionage plot.
George Roy Hill not only refuses
to direct her to take advantage of the
possibilities in the material; he actu
ally sabotages them on several occa
sions. When the Israelis (led by Klaus
Kinski in a surprisingly lively perfor
mance) exhibit the captured, drugged
Michel to Charlie as part of her role
preparation, Hill fixes his camera on
the limp, naked body as Kinski points
out all its distinguishing features.
Why doesn't he forget Michel and
show us Charlie's response to the ob
jectification of the attractive boy,
sentenced to death, who's supposed
to be her inamorato? And when an
accessory member of the Palestinian
group, Helga (Kerstin de Ahna, who
foolishly plays her like a Nazi), in
forms her of Michel's death. Hill robs
us of the opportunity to see how
Charlie will act the role of the griev
ing lover by cutting away to the busy
Israelis listening in on their exchange.
He makes the same mistake over and
over again — he doesn't appear to
know how to locate the most interest

ing dramatic focus.
I've never been a George Roy Hill
fan, but he usually rises to the occa
sion when he's adapting a novel he
cares about — "Hawaii" or (in
places) "Slaughterhouse Five" and
"The World According to Garp." But
the dramatic logic of "The Little
Drummer Girl" evidently eluded
him, because even the suspense in it
never takes hold: He cuts to the Is
raelis so often that we don't have to
worry about whether they'll be in
time to save Charlie in the event of an
emergency, and he and Mandel an
ticipate plot developments that Le
Carre wisely holds back and then
springs as little surprises. The whole
movie has a thick, lethargic feeling to
it, as if Hill and his crew had spent too
much time on location and brought
back too much footage for the editor,
William Reynolds, to shape. (It cer
tainly goes on a good half hour too
long.) Somehow Hill missed the key
to Le Carre's craftsmanship: In his
novel character creates suspense,
since Charlie's commitment to each
of her roles gives them both a chilling
authenticity, and Le Carre refuses to
get ahead of her when she confronts
each loaded situation. Hill tries to
divide character and suspense up, as
though he were directing two movies
in a single package, and then he can't
make either of them work.


Involved over her head with PLO terrorists, Charlie (Diane Keaton) learns to take apart and assemble a gun in "Little Drummer Girl."
The disastrous errors filmmakers
have made recently in attempting to
transcribe great literature to the
screen are understandable, if not al
ways forgivable, but it's more difficult
to see why director George Roy Hill
and screenwriter Loring Mandel
failed to turn John Le Carre's spy en
tertainment "The Little Drummer
Girl" into a good movie. Surely they
Wouldn't have misread the novel? It's
not exactly Malcolm Lowry or Henry
James. But it's a compelling thriller,
despite Le Carre's sometime affecta
tions and the excessive length (no spy
novel should run to 515 pages), be
cause the familiar thematic ground —
the realm in which reality and fantasy
'intersect — is trod by an enthralling
Character, Charlie, an actress enlisted
by a company of Israelis to help them
'infiltrate a Palestinian terrorist group.
Charlie is a chronic political and
emotional malcontent whose
tentative association with a number
of left-wing causes may represent a
serious quarrel with the injustices of
the society she lives in (she is British),

The whole movie has a thick, lethargic

or an outgrowth of her sexual in
volvement with an activist actor, or it
may simply provide an outlet for her
restless, aggressive spirit. A gifted
performer with an unexciting but not
unsuccessful career, she has rewritten
her own childhood in an effort to etch
an image for herself and then learned
it so well that she half believes the fic
tion. The Israelis wish to channel all
these qualities — her restlessness, her
•compassion for underdog causes
(though in fact she has lately been at
tending "revolutionary training ses
sion" given by Palestinian sympa
thizers), and most of all her
believability on stage — into a single
role. They want her to pose as the
lover of a handsome young terrorist,
Michel, whom they have captured
and plan to kill — and then as the
young woman in mourning who, out
of devotion to her dead sweetheart's
politics and fury toward his enemies,
joins the Palestinians herself.
