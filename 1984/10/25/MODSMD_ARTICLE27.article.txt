# Next Stage one-acts experimental
## 
### MARC FAJER 
If you are going up to the City this
weekend and are looking for some
thing a little different, you might try
checking out the pair of one-act plays
being performed by the Front Row
Theater Company at The Next Stage
at 3844 Mission St. (in the Mission
District). The two shows, "Play" by
Robert Locke and "Piccolo Pete" by
Mark London Williams, are far from
the average mindless bill of fare, and,
while not perfect, are thought
provoking and fun.
"Play" is experimental. It is diffi
cult to describe the piece while doing
justice to the creative work that went
into its conception. It is (more or less)
a supposed performance of a differ
ent play by the same author which is
marred by various (apparently real)
interruptions. The actors (among

other things) complain about cuts in
the script and discuss their experi
ences as actors with the audience. It
builds to a weird climax, in which it is
not clear whether the victim is a char
acter or the actor playing him.
If this all sounds odd and rather
self-indulgent, it was. However, the
strange juxtaposition of ideas about
theater was thought-provoking and
different. As one character/actor
pointed out, if we saw a group of
Martians going to watch a second
group of Martians pretend to be a
third group of Martians, we'd think
they were a bit off the wall, too.
The experience that "Play" was
supposed to create for the audience
was marred somewhat by perfor
mances that were not quite up to par.
For this sort of thing to work, the ac
tors have to be absolutely believable

when they are pretending not to be
acting. Blaine Souza as the director of
the supposed play and Greg De Graf
as an actor confused by the weird
changes in his script did not quite
capture this level of reality (this is not
a major criticism; it is extremely hard
to do), and so lessened the impact of
the piece. Sandy Hillard and Dan
Ouinn, on the other hand, did
manage to reach that level, and, in
addition, were very funny in their
roles in the play within the play.
Locke, who directed "Play" as well
as authoring it, has borrowed con
cepts from a variety of places to
create an intriguing and different pro
duction. It questions how an audience
is supposed to deal with the perfor
mance it observes; a question rarely
examined carefully. The fact that it
does not work quite as well as it could
does not prevent it from being
thought-provoking and worth looking
at.
The second piece, "Piccolo Pete,"
is in a slightly more traditional vein,
and carries off its concept more suc
cessfully due to fine, tight direction
by Terrell Hillard and excellent per
formances by the whole cast. The
play is about a motley band of would
be terrorists who have blown up a
fireworks factory and are hiding out
waiting for the police. They face their
impending doom listening to a
retrospective of the music of
Amarillo Jordan (a country singer
who has recently committed suicide).
The five characters are fascinating,
well-drawn and well-portrayed. The
most memorable performance was
that of Sandy Hillard as Rum, the
housewife turned terrorist. She is
warm, concerned, very vulnerable
and very real. Her monologue
describing her descent into terrorism
and her current view of herself is
moving and powerful, as is her in
creasing concern at the fact that
people were killed in the blaze in the
factory. Dan Quinn is superb as a

spaced-out kid living vicariously
through a Walkman radio. When the
machine is on, he sings or recites
whatever is on the air. The number of
vocal changes he goes through is im
pressive, as is his singing, and his
impressions of radio announcers and
commercials are very funny. Quinn
accomplishes a frightening discon
nectedness from reality that is almost
painful to watch on stage.
Greg De Graf does a very touching
and funny turn as Buck, a gay hustler
turned terrorist who drinks his way
into oblivion during the tense
stakeout. He does a very fine and
realistic drunk (something which is
not done often). Terry Gault is very
funny as Spider, who plays James
Cagney during the whole stakeout,
and seals the doom of the group by
shooting at the police who have sur
rounded the hideout. Finally, Blaine
Souza is touching as Hogwash, the

watchman at the fireworks company
who was fired for no apparent reason.
He has recruited the others and is
referred to on the radio as the leader
of the gang.
Part of the power of "Piccolo Pete"
is that it makes it possible to under
stand how people can get involved in
abhorrent activities resulting in
destruction and death. All of the
characters are missing something in
their lives which they attempt to fill
with their terrorist activities. The
havoc they can wreak is contrasted
with the pathetic nature of their abili
ties and their essentially benign inten
tions. This leads to the realization
that there is really not that wide a line
separating the destructive elements in
society from the rest of us.
Director Hillard has done a fine
job of pacing the show. It is suspense
ful, funny and riveting and tosses its

ideas around without becoming over
whelmingly intellectual. There are a
number of very humorous bits,
notably those involving the boy
scouts coming to the stakeout, and
the fate of the poor woman who
brings a rhubarb pie to the SWAT
team. One is left, though, after the
tension and laughter die down, with a
sense of sadness for these people and
for their victims, and perhaps also for
a world that leaves people with voids
they feel they must fill with fire and
destruction.
"Play" and "Piccolo Pete" will be
performed this Thursday through
Sunday only. The theater is tiny, so if
you are interested, you may want to
call for reservations (843-9717). All
in all, these plays are worth your
time, especially if you are looking for
something out of the ordinary (with
the football team on the road this
weekend).
