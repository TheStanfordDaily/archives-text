# Apartheid referendum raises issues

In the second of a two-part series on the
University's investments in companies
that operate in South Africa, The Daily
explores Stanford's stock ownership in
light of South Africa's apartheid policies.

"Despite the fact that the South
African military and police are the in
struments which enforce apartheid,
Motorola appparently believes that so
long as it violates no U.S. law, it should
be free to sell the military or police prod
ucts which assist them in killing or
repressing the black majority popula
tion," wrote proponents of a May 1984
shareholder resolution presented to
Motorola, Inc. The resolution asked
Motorola to stop sales of its communica
tion equipment to South African police
and military until apartheid was ended.
"Under this logic, Motorola ap
parently would have been willing to sell
cyanide gas to the Nazis for use in the gas
chambers, so long as no U.S. law was
violated," the statement continued.

Motorola responded to the charge by
saying that its equipment was used to
help protect the people and property of
South Africa. It continued to say that as
a company, its practices were not com
patible with the system of apartheid.
Yet Motorola only met the basic re
quirements of the Sullivan employment
principles in 1981, 1982 and 1983. The
Sullivan principles were developed by a
Philadelphia minister and black employ
ment activist, Leon Sullivan, who also
was a member of the General Motors'
board of directors. The principles were
introduced in 1977 and were endorsed by
12 companies; as of Oct. 1983, there
were 120 signatories.
The original six principles called for:
non-segregation of the races in all eating,
comfort and work facilities; equal and
fair employment practices for all
employees; equal pay for all employees
doing equal or comparable work for the
same period of time; initiation and de
velopment of training programs that will
prepare, in substantial numbers, blacks

and other non-whites for supervisory,
administrative, clerical and technical
jobs; an increase in the number of blacks
and other non-whites in management
and supervisory positions; and improve
ment in the quality of employees' lives
outside the work environment in such
areas as housing, transportation, school
ing, recreation and health facilities.
Sullivan has subsequently amplified
the principles, committing signatory
companies to acknowledge the rights of
Africans to form and belong to trade uni
ons, whether registered with the govern
ment or not; support changes in South
Africa's influx control laws to provide for
the right of African migrant workers to
normal family life; and to assist in the de
velopment of African and black business
enterprises, including distributors, sup
pliers of goods and services, and
manufacturers.
In a recent study of Sullivan principle
signatories preformed by an outside con
sulting firm, Motorola received the

second lowest rating possible. Specifi
cally, the study said Motorola has passed
the basic requirements of the Sullivan
priniciples but needs to become more ac
tive in their implementation.
Many investors, however, think that
the adherence to the Sullivan principles
is the absolute minimum social responsi
bility standard for companies operating
in South Africa.
But the debate on South Africa is not
limited to the Sullivan principles. Some
people say that a mere presence in
South Africa is wrong because corporate
involvement in the country sustains apar
theid. A number of people press for
divestment â€” they want all companies
out of South Africa. This is different from
divestiture, the selling of stocks of a com
pany.
Apartheid is South Africa's system of
laws that maintains a white minority rule
over 24 million disenfranchised blacks.
