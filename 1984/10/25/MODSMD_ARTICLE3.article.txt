# Apartheid referendum raises issues
## 
### JACK ALDEN 
In the second of a two-part series on the
University's investments in companies
that operate in South Africa, The Daily
explores Stanford's stock ownership in
light of South Africa's apartheid policies.

"Despite the fact that the South
African military and police are the in
struments which enforce apartheid,
Motorola appparently believes that so
long as it violates no U.S. law, it should
be free to sell the military or police prod
ucts which assist them in killing or
repressing the black majority popula
tion," wrote proponents of a May 1984
shareholder resolution presented to
Motorola, Inc. The resolution asked
Motorola to stop sales of its communica
tion equipment to South African police
and military until apartheid was ended.
"Under this logic, Motorola ap
parently would have been willing to sell
cyanide gas to the Nazis for use in the gas
chambers, so long as no U.S. law was
violated," the statement continued.

Motorola responded to the charge by
saying that its equipment was used to
help protect the people and property of
South Africa. It continued to say that as
a company, its practices were not com
patible with the system of apartheid.
Yet Motorola only met the basic re
quirements of the Sullivan employment
principles in 1981, 1982 and 1983. The
Sullivan principles were developed by a
Philadelphia minister and black employ
ment activist, Leon Sullivan, who also
was a member of the General Motors'
board of directors. The principles were
introduced in 1977 and were endorsed by
12 companies; as of Oct. 1983, there
were 120 signatories.
The original six principles called for:
non-segregation of the races in all eating,
comfort and work facilities; equal and
fair employment practices for all
employees; equal pay for all employees
doing equal or comparable work for the
same period of time; initiation and de
velopment of training programs that will
prepare, in substantial numbers, blacks

and other non-whites for supervisory,
administrative, clerical and technical
jobs; an increase in the number of blacks
and other non-whites in management
and supervisory positions; and improve
ment in the quality of employees' lives
outside the work environment in such
areas as housing, transportation, school
ing, recreation and health facilities.
Sullivan has subsequently amplified
the principles, committing signatory
companies to acknowledge the rights of
Africans to form and belong to trade uni
ons, whether registered with the govern
ment or not; support changes in South
Africa's influx control laws to provide for
the right of African migrant workers to
normal family life; and to assist in the de
velopment of African and black business
enterprises, including distributors, sup
pliers of goods and services, and
manufacturers.
In a recent study of Sullivan principle
signatories preformed by an outside con
sulting firm, Motorola received the

second lowest rating possible. Specifi
cally, the study said Motorola has passed
the basic requirements of the Sullivan
priniciples but needs to become more ac
tive in their implementation.
Many investors, however, think that
the adherence to the Sullivan principles
is the absolute minimum social responsi
bility standard for companies operating
in South Africa.
But the debate on South Africa is not
limited to the Sullivan principles. Some
people say that a mere presence in
South Africa is wrong because corporate
involvement in the country sustains apar
theid. A number of people press for
divestment — they want all companies
out of South Africa. This is different from
divestiture, the selling of stocks of a com
pany.
Apartheid is South Africa's system of
laws that maintains a white minority rule
over 24 million disenfranchised blacks.
While segregation is the most visible aspect of the South
African policy, it is not the only goal of apartheid; the
creators of apartheid also want to remove any claims of
citizenship from blacks in a white South Africa.
Under South African law, political activity is restricted.
The government has been given the authority to arrest
and indefinitely detain persons suspected of political of
fenses without charging them.
Most recently, 7,000 police and combat-ready troops
swept into three townships south of Johannesburg, arrest
ing 354 blacks and interrogating at least 120,000 more.
Of the 82 people killed in recent riots, only one was white.
Under another act, the government has the power to
"ban" an individual; the person cannot leave his house at
night, meet with more than one person at a time or be
quoted in print. Records show that fron 1961 to 1981
more than 1,400 individuals have been banned and 5,000
detained without trial.
A second way in which the South African government
applies its apartheid policies is through influx control or
"pass" laws. Under these laws, only a minority of Africans
are allowed to live permanently with their families in ur
ban areas the government has set aside for whites, who
compose 30 percent of the population. The majority of
Africans are assigned to impoverished rural areas known
as homelands.
For most Africans, the ability to work in the common
areas reserved for whites, which comprise 86 percent of
South Africa's land, is crucial to obtaining enough income
to support oneself and family. Yet access is limited to this
economy by the pass laws which govern residence rights
and movements of the Africans. Each year, an average of
a quarter-million Africans are held for pass-law violations
and one-third of South Africa's prison population are pass
law violators.
The mechanics of the apartheid system are well-known;
the road to change is not as clear. As University Treasurer
Rodney Adams says,"The issue (that is being debated in
the ASSU resolution) is not a rejection of apartheid as a
policy. It has been very clear over the years . . . the oppo
sition to apartheid. Given the opposition and repugnance
to such a state mandated policy, what are the most effec
tive means to change this (policy)? How best do we effect
change?"
One proposal to change the apartheid system was given
by South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, this year's
Nobel Peace Prize winner and the head of the South
African Council of Churches, in a speech given to SACC
in June of last year.
Tutu's conditions for investment in South Africa say
that foreign companies should inform the South African
government that they are prepared to stay in South Africa
only if they are allowed to do the following: ensure that all
their black workers are permitted to live with their
families near the place of work; recognize representative
black unions whether or not they are registered with the
government; freely hire black labor without regard to the
South African laws restricting the movement of Africans
within the country; and to enforce fair labor practices and
invest massively in black education and training.
Tutu's second and fourth principles are part of the Sul
livan principles and can be effected without breaking any
South African laws, but the first and thrid points call on
companies to oppose the influx laws, the cornerstone of
apartheid.
These principles, in contrast to Sullivan's, emphasize
that companies should oppose South African laws and use
the threat of withdrawal as a lever in negotiations with the
government.
According to Kirk Hanson, outgoing head of the presi
dent's Committee on Investment Responsibility and a
business professor, Stanford's longstanding policy is that
companies ought to comply with the Sullivan principles.
In 1983, the University ammended its policies to include
Tutu's principles.
Stanford currently owns approximately $400 million in
common stock, according to Adams, and he said he would
not be surprised to learn that half of that stock had some
interests in South Africa. However, Adams said that in
1978 there was a lengthy analysis of the University's
policy on companies that have holdings in South Africa. It
was found that of the stocks in Standard and Poor's 500,
almost all had some presence in South Africa, although it
is usually than 1 percent of the companies' sales.
Among the stocks that Stanford owns that have opera

tions in South Africa are Mobil, Standard Oil of Califor
nia, Texaco and Xerox, all of whom were asked at share
holder meetings in 1984 to adopt the Tutu principles or
withdraw from South Africa. In addition, Stanford Board
of Trustees member John Grey is the President of Stan
dard Oil of California while the Timken Company —
with Trustee William Timken Jr. a member of the
board of directors — is one of the 25 largest U.S. corpora
tions in South Africa that has not signed the Sullivan prin
ciples as of Feb. 29, 1984.
In May 1977, 450 students demonstrated for the divest
ment of Caltex, a Standard Oil of California and Texaco
joint subsidiary, from South Africa; the board of trustees
abstained from voting on a proxy that would have accom
plished this. Later in the month students held a 16-hour
sit-in at Old Union protesting that vote, and 294 people
were arrested. In November 1977 the ASSU Senate
called for the total divestiture of South African stocks.
As a result of these incidents, the Stanford Committee
on Investment Responsibility was developed, Trustee
James Ware said.
Ware said the committee is appointed by the University
president, and the board of trustees has a similar commit
tee, of which Ware is a member.
Ware said the idea of the Committee on Investment
Responsibility is to respond to resolutions like ASSU
Senator Mark Landesmann's that calls for the University's
divestment of its 94,000 shares of Motorola stock and to
adopt a responsible investment policy towards other com
panies that operate in South Africa. The University's cur
rent policy, Ware said, is if it finds that a corporation has
caused great social injury that it will make a response.
The committee is authorized to advise trustees on in
vestments and to recommend that Stanford vote its
shares, make a representation to management or to divest
its shares, according to Hanson. Divestiture, Hanson
said, "is a last resort that is unlikely to occur.
"I think the proxy route is still a very effective vehicle
for the University to express its views on social questions.
And it's an effective vehicle for social activists, too.
"I think in most cases, the University should not divest
itself of stocks of corporations that misbehave socially,"
Hanson continued. "We can have more influence by
owning the stocks and voting against the management.
But there may be a few corporate outlaws that are totally
insensitive to pressure and divestiture may be appropriate
in those cases."
Landesmann said the problem with shareholder proxies
and resolutions is that they only have an effect on those
companies which behave well in South Africa. To other
types of companies, those that are indifferent to
people's suffering, "proxies mean nothing. Profit is their
sole motive," Landesmann said. Those companies should
withdraw from South Africa or the University should
divest of them, Landesmann said.
There are two questions that Stanford has to ponder,
according to Hanson; should it consider divestiture of cer
tian stocks of outlaw companies, or should it have a total
and complete divestiture of all companies in South
Africa?
The two groups most interested in total divestiture are
activists and corporate secretaries and board members,
Adams said. If one sells his interest in a company, he no
longer has a voice to influence change within that com
pany. Adams said that corporate secretaries and board
members like this because they no longer have to deal
with protesting shareholders.
Other universities, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Amherst and Brown, acting upon student referendums,
have selectively divested of companies that have
operations in South Africa or deal with South Africa.
No university, Hanson said, has divested of all stocks in
South Africa. Harvard considered it last year, but the
Harvard Corporation split 8-8 on divestiture. In December
1982,the governor of Michigan signed a bill that prohibits
state universities and community colleges from investing
funds in companies and banks doing business in South
Africa.
Landesmann feels "the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility is going to be very responsive to student con
cerns," even though "it's (the South African question) a
controversial issue on the board of trustees."
Talks with University President Donald Kennedy were
encouraging, Landesmann said, although he said he
"didn't want to go into specifics.
"We have a lot of faith in the board of trustees' mem
bers and that they'll react in a manner that is respectful of
our concerns."
