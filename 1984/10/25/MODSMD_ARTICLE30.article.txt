# Kenny G: wild jazz/fusion on saxophone
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
When you see jazz/fusion saxo
phonist Kenny Gorelick, known on his
albums and to his followers as just
Kenny G, walk on stage for the first
time, you have no choice but to laugh.
Here comes this short, skinny guy
with a head of tight, natural curls.
There's this huge smile on his face
and you've got to believe he just got
off the phone with Mom.
And then there are his clothes. No,
no argyle sweater, button-down Ox
ford shirt, khaki pants and topsiders
to match his "I chopped down the
cherry tree" face. He's wearing black
leather pants, a black tank-top, a
four-sizes-too-big leather jacket and
red sneakers.
And as he walks to the center of
the stage, his five-piece band is
playing this wild, funky music, not
even close to the "Rocky Mountain
High" stuff you'd expect just looking
at him.
Ha, ha, you think. This must be
some kind of joke.
Then Gorelick picks up his
saxophone and starts to play. And
you stop laughing.
Gorelick can try all he wants to be
cool. He could buy all the leather
clothes he wants and grow his hair as
long as he wants. He could even stop
smiling. It still wouldn't work.

But Gorelick, whose sister is a
Stanford graduate, doesn't have to try
any harder to be a good musician. His
two solo albums are better than
average jazz/fusion recordings and his
concert performance is even better.
Gorelick and his band, called G
Force, let that be known last
Thursday before a packed house at
Wolfgang's in San Francisco.
Wolfgang's was the club where they
made their touring debut last year
and, as Gorelick said, "We love it
here. We'll be sure to come back reg
ularly."
Gorelick is new at being the main
attraction. He spent three years prior
to going solo with the Jeff Lorber Fu
sion band as its saxophone and flute
player, and the influence of his old
group on his solo music is obvious.
Like the Jeff Lorber Fusion, vocals
are out and instrumental solos are in.
But Gorelick is taking his music a
step further. His music is funkier than
Jeff Lorber's and, more important,
he isn't afraid to take a chance.
Gorleick took a big chance last
year when he lived with
producer/songwriter Kashif for six
months in New York putting together
his most recent album, called "G
Force." Though a few songs from the
album did receive some air-play, "G
Force" suffered in sales because,
well, it all sounded the same, with

those Kashif trademarks— handclaps
and synthesized baselines.
Gorelick played all of side one off
"G Force" at Wolfgang's but made
enough changes in the concert ver
sions of the songs so that they all
sounded different. The biggest
change was more and longer solos,
especially by other members in the
band, giving the impression that it
wasn't just Gorelick and his
saxophone on stage.
And the other members of the
band were all good. The bassist,
Danny Wilson, is a hold-over from
Gorelick's Jeff Lorber Fusion days
and is probably the most-talented
member of G Force. The band also
consisted of two keyboard players, a
guitarist and a drummer.
Besides the four songs off "G
Force," Gorelick and company
played only two more songs — one
from a Jeff Lorber album and one
from Gorelick's debut album. As a
result, each song was at least 10
minutes long and filled with at least
two or three solos.
Still, as good as the music and the
musicians were, you have to wonder
if Gorelick will ever make it big. Un
fortunately, the answer that keeps
popping up is, "No."
There is simply too much not in
Gorelick's favor. First, there is his
music. Jazz/fusion has never made it

on the pop charts and probably never
will. A jazz/fusion artist could be at
the top of his field and still be a rela
tive unknown to those who religously
listen to American Top 40 each week.
There is also Gorelick's recent af
finity for funky basslines. As if his po
tential audience isn't already small
enough, now he eliminates those who
opt for the more conventional, rock
oriented backbeats.
And finally, there is Gorelick's in
strument. Sure, Grover Washington,
Jr., made it semi-big with a
saxophone, but that was playing it
softly, and not with a heavily syn
thesized bassline behind it. Gorelick's
louder, wilder style can only take him
so far, and that isn't very far.
Nonetheless, the fact remains that
Gorelick is good at what he does. He
plays the saxophone as well as anyone
in the jazz/fusion industry and he
writes almost all his own songs. And
anyone who didn't realize that after
Gorelick's first solo last Thursday
certainly did after his last, a 10-
minute solo which he played while
walking through the crowd and even
up on the balcony at Wolfgang's.
Gorelick doesn't look like he plays
or plays like he looks. He'll never be
able to change that momma's boy
image of his, but he can — and has —
changed his music for the better.

And that was never more apparent
than midway through the concert. At
the conclusion of a song, someone in
the audience yelled out, "I've never

heard a white boy play like that."
Gorelick didn't break stride. He
just smiled and said, "Hey, it's
1984."
