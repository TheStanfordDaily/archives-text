# 'Sylvia Plath' transcends mere reading
## 
### NANCY HENRY 
Poet Sylvia Plath wrote extensively about the pain and
despair in her life. Her images of death are among the
most powerful in modern poetry. It is for these images and
for her own tragic suicide that she is primarily known.
Plath was also capable of keen insight into the world
around her, commenting on it with the wit and apprecia
tion that color her verse.
"Sylvia Plath: A Dramatic Portrait" showing in the ap
propriately intimate atmosphere of Studio Eremos in
Project Artaud, San Francisco, at times achieves a dra
matic intensity that can only be attributed the poetry it
self. Depending on one's interest in and familiarity with
Plath, it may prove a play well worth seeing.
First produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in
1976, the play demands little in the way of creative inter
pretation by the actors. The contribution of Barry Kyle,
who adapted the portrait from the entire body of Plath's
autobiograpical, fictional, and poetic work, is to select

pieces representative of the writer's mental state at
various phases in her life and arrange them chronologi
cally to convey the manic nature of her moods and the
evolution of her genius.
An image and myth have grown around Plath: that of
the victimized artist and woman, the sacrificial lamb to so
ciety's brutal insensitivity. If this play leaves any one im
pression, it Is that of a woman not victimized by, but
misplaced, in society. Plath could live only in the world of
her creation, the world of words, and that is also where
she died.
Indeed, listening to the words is often frightening. This
particular production is flawed in several ways, but the ap
parent sensitivity of the actors to the emotions they ex
press and the sheer power of the images themselves to
gether manage to communicate the messages inherent in
the words.
The play risks discontinuity by dividing the main char
acter into three. Success depends heavily on the perfor
mances of the actresses. "Sylvia One," Lydia Woods,

battled with larengitis for the possession of her voice, but
won out in a performance that perhaps showed more real
concentration and determination than the other two. Jude
Haukom and Marjory Panetti as Sylvias "Two" and
"Three" respectively, demonstrated a feeling for the
lyricism and meaning of their lines. All three were prone
to minor slips which tended to interrupt the momentum
and lessen the overall effect of a given monologue.
More distracting to actors and audience were the
sounds of a train, a telephone, and rock music which
somehow penetrated the studio last Friday. Though the
nojse did not detract from the play's best moments —
when these -actresses are good, they are excellent — it
prevented the play from sustaining the magical quality it
occasionally achieved.
The show's greatest asset is the harmony of the three
Sylvias' performances. Their timing and congeniality on
stage imply that Plath was not so much in conflict with
herself as with the world around her.
The shapeless, flowing white robes that drape the

actresses seem to suggest Plath's lack of identity with the
outside world she saw so clearly. The set of simple
wooden boxes arbitrarily arranged for sitting, standing,
and lying, contributes to the concept that all the world was
a podium from which Plath expressed her impressions of it
and herself.
That is the essential element of this play: expression, of
love, hate, anger, joy, frustration, humor. Plath was a
multidimensional person whose art beautifully if painfully
reflects both her complex and simple emotions. For those
who know and appreciate Plath, this is a chance to tran
scend the experience of a mere reading , and to encounter
visually and emotionally this most unique and moving
poetry.
Those unfamiliar with Plath will find the play in
formative and perhaps disturbing. It could prove an in
fluential introduction to her work, but not a substitution
for reading it. The show runs this Friday, Saturday and
Sunday. It does justice to a poet whose work deserves just
this sort of honest, objective treatment.
