Old problem, bad solutions

Last week, Heisman Trophy
winner Mike Rozier admitted he
was taking money from his agent
and had already signed a pro foot
hall contract before he finished the
1983 college football season.
Two weeks ago. University of
Oklahoma defensive back Keith
Stanberry testified that he was of
fered a car by a Southern Method
ist University alumnus if he would
sign a letter of intent to attend
SMU.
In March 1982, University of
Notre Dame basketball Coach
Digger Phelps said some colleges
were paying a standard rate of
$ 10,000 a year to outstanding bas
ketball players.
Two weeks ago. National Col
legiate Athletic Association Exec
utive Director Walter Byers, who
had previously disagreed with
Phelps analysis, concurred with
Phelps and said some athletes are
receiving payments of $20,000 or
more a year.
For the past six years (including
this one), at least one football
team in the Pacific 10 Conference
has been on probation.
Since 1 became interested in
sports, the stories of illegal activi
ties, recruiting violations and
classes for jocks have surfaced in
newspapers at a very consistent
rate.
So what's the big deal? These
things happen, it's just a fact of
life. Everybody knows that Okla
homa is nothing but a football fac
tory. The University of Texas is
devoted to nothing but winning a
national championship.
Evidently, Byers thinks there's a
problem. Over the past month, he
has made two suggestions to solve
the problem. The first, in an inter
view with Sports Illustrated, was
to create an open division of col
lege football in which teams could
compete without as many restric
tions.
It's not a bad idea, if you want
to have an even more profes
sionalized standard of play. Un
fortunately for Byers, most uni
versity administrators don't agree
with that scenario.
Byers' second solution was to
have stricter enforcement of the
current rules, including curtail
ment of scholarships, dismissals of
coaching staffs and suspensions of
team schedules for one year or

That's not a bad idea either. If
you can catch a few of the big
cheaters and really rake them over
the coals then maybe everybody
will shape up.

But Dr. John Ryan, the presi
dent of Indiana University and
chairman of the NCAA Presidents
Commission, said in an interview
with the New York Times that al

though he agreed with Byers'
assessment, "I'm not ready to do
something about the problem like
jacking up the penalties. . . . It's
not how hard you come down but
generating the will to purge ath
letics of the practices and people
not consistent with values of the
institution. There is no sense shut
ting down a bank because the
president is embezzling money.
I'm not vengeful or retribution
minded."
That's an honorable solution, at
least. The NCAA should be trying
to encourage self-policing. Uni
versity administrators should turn
themselves in when they have
problems and should discourage
wealthy alumni from offering cars
and cash.
So what you're left with are two
not-so-bad solutions and one pipe
dream. All of these have one thing
in common. They all are trying to
stop the cough without curing the
cold. In other words, all of these
solutions ignore the source of the
problem.
The source is the pressure to
win and the spoils of victory.
At every university that par
ticipates in major college athletics,
the pressure to win is ever present.
When things go badly and the
team doesn't win, the cries of "Ax
the coach" begin to reverberate
like the rumble of a steamroller.
There are also administrators of
athletic departments around the
nation who like the huge gate
receipts that alumni and students
generate for winning football pro
grams.
So with the dollar signs flashing
in front of everyone's face, what
do you think is supposed to hap
pen? In the words of a friend of
mine, "If you can't win, cheat."
I'm not saying that less empha
sis should be placed on winning,
that's just as much a pipe dream as
Ryan's suggestion. But if the
NCAA expects to solve this prob
lem, it has to be able to put win
ning in the proper perspective.
The way to do this is to have
people who are committed to
academics and not just to produc
ing refrigerator-sized linemen.
This means not only coaches, but
players as well.

Student-athletes must be ex
actly that. A great many athletes
don't want to be in school in the
first place. Colleges pretend that
they are giving an athlete some
great opportunity to make some
thing of himself.

Unfortunately, somewhere
along the way from the locker
room to the classroom that oppor
tunity gets lost. Players lose,
coaches and administrators cheat
and, so far, the fans pretend it's

compete without as many restric
tions.
It's not a bad idea, if you want
to have an even more profes
sionalized standard of play. Un
fortunately for Byers, most uni
versity administrators don't agree
with that scenario.
Byers' second solution was to
have stricter enforcement of the
current rules, including curtail
ment of scholarships, dismissals of
coaching staffs and suspensions of
team schedules for one year or

That's not a bad idea either. If
you can catch a few of the big
cheaters and really rake them over
the coals then maybe everybody
will shape up.

But Dr. John Ryan, the presi
dent of Indiana University and
chairman of the NCAA Presidents
Commission, said in an interview
with the New York Times that al

though he agreed with Byers'
assessment, "I'm not ready to do
something about the problem like
jacking up the penalties. . . . It's
not how hard you come down but
generating the will to purge ath
letics of the practices and people
not consistent with values of the
institution. There is no sense shut
ting down a bank because the
president is embezzling money.
I'm not vengeful or retribution
minded."
That's an honorable solution, at
least. The NCAA should be trying
to encourage self-policing. Uni
versity administrators should turn
themselves in when they have
problems and should discourage
wealthy alumni from offering cars
and cash.
So what you're left with are two
not-so-bad solutions and one pipe
dream. All of these have one thing
in common. They all are trying to
stop the cough without curing the
cold. In other words, all of these
solutions ignore the source of the
problem.
The source is the pressure to
win and the spoils of victory.
At every university that par
ticipates in major college athletics,
the pressure to win is ever present.
When things go badly and the
team doesn't win, the cries of "Ax
the coach" begin to reverberate
like the rumble of a steamroller.
There are also administrators of
athletic departments around the
nation who like the huge gate
receipts that alumni and students
generate for winning football pro
grams.
So with the dollar signs flashing
in front of everyone's face, what
do you think is supposed to hap
pen? In the words of a friend of
mine, "If you can't win, cheat."
I'm not saying that less empha
sis should be placed on winning,
that's just as much a pipe dream as
Ryan's suggestion. But if the
NCAA expects to solve this prob
lem, it has to be able to put win
ning in the proper perspective.
The way to do this is to have
people who are committed to
academics and not just to produc
ing refrigerator-sized linemen.
This means not only coaches, but
players as well.

Student-athletes must be ex
actly that. A great many athletes
don't want to be in school in the
first place. Colleges pretend that
they are giving an athlete some
great opportunity to make some
thing of himself.

Unfortunately, somewhere
along the way from the locker
room to the classroom that oppor
tunity gets lost. Players lose,
coaches and administrators cheat
and, so far, the fans pretend it's

Old problem, bad solutions

Last week, Heisman Trophy
winner Mike Rozier admitted he
was taking money from his agent
and had already signed a pro foot
hall contract before he finished the
1983 college football season.
Two weeks ago. University of
Oklahoma defensive back Keith
Stanberry testified that he was of
fered a car by a Southern Method
ist University alumnus if he would
sign a letter of intent to attend
SMU.
In March 1982, University of
Notre Dame basketball Coach
Digger Phelps said some colleges
were paying a standard rate of
$ 10,000 a year to outstanding bas
ketball players.
Two weeks ago. National Col
legiate Athletic Association Exec
utive Director Walter Byers, who
had previously disagreed with
Phelps analysis, concurred with
Phelps and said some athletes are
receiving payments of $20,000 or
more a year.
For the past six years (including
this one), at least one football
team in the Pacific 10 Conference
has been on probation.
Since 1 became interested in
sports, the stories of illegal activi
ties, recruiting violations and
classes for jocks have surfaced in
newspapers at a very consistent
rate.
So what's the big deal? These
things happen, it's just a fact of
life. Everybody knows that Okla
homa is nothing but a football fac
tory. The University of Texas is
devoted to nothing but winning a
national championship.
Evidently, Byers thinks there's a
problem. Over the past month, he
has made two suggestions to solve
the problem. The first, in an inter
view with Sports Illustrated, was
to create an open division of col
lege football in which teams could
compete without as many restric
tions.
