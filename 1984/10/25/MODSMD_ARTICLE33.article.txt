# Women's soccer team needs victory over St. Mary's
## Winning record on the line 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's soccer team will try to add to its
three-game winning streak today at St. Mary s College.
Recently, the Cardinal has won some tightly-contested
games, something it could not do earlier in the season.
The team is 5-5 overall but has lost three games by one
goal.
Stanford Head Coach Helen Keohane attributed much
of the recent success to the team's attitude. "We ve been
up psychologically," she said. "We know we can win.
We're starting to put it together and settle into a pattern."
According to Keohane, St Mary's is a very good team
which has had its fair share of tough defeats.
"They're a tough team, even though their record may
not be that good," Keohane said. "They're similar to us.
They have lost games by a goal or two."
"They are a well coached team," added Keohane.
"With two former State-select players in the lineup."
Keohane considered it a "toss-up" as to who would
start today's game, describing Stanford senior goalkeepers
Helen Norton and Teresa Greaney as "about equal" in
ability.
Norton has a 1.75 goals-against average in eight games,
recording a total of 38 saves. Greaney, who has a 2.00
goals-against average, has notched 21 saves in only two
games.
Forward Sue Moore, the main Cardinal offensive
threat, leads the team with nine goals, scoring four goals
in the last three games. Moore has contributed a goal in
every game that Stanford has scored. Amy Geisse, Hil
liary Lauer, Lisa Schaffer and Molly Barnes all follow
with two goals apiece.
For the season, Stanford has scored 20 goals while al
lowing 18. Keohane praised the Cardinal defensive efforts
and said that most of the players in the defense are trying
out new positions. The Cardinal defense has not allowed
more than two goals in the last three games including one
shutoutâ€”the first one of the season.
If the Cardinal wins today, it will go over the .500 mark
for the first time all season.
