# U.N. official blasts delusions

### JOHN CALLON 
Swadesh Rana, senior political offi
cer of the United Nations Developent
and Defense Department, told a
small gathering at the Bechtel Inter
national Center yesterday to
"disabuse yourselves of the notion
that poverty among lower-developed
countries is linked to military spend
ing."
"People equate military spending
with military regimes, militarization
and totalitarianism," Rana said.
"There is a plain, simple, stark-naked
truth of becoming a nation-state with
only two palm trees and a strip of
land. All the developing countries
represent only 14 percent of global

military spending. $120 billion spread
over 140 countries is insignificant."
She said she feels people in the
United States are particularly prone
to misconceptions about the Third
World because "this country has the
tightest control of the minds of its
constituents. I have never seen such a
closed media."
Rana's visit, arranged through the
Stanford International Development
Organization (SIDO), is part of a
larger U.N. effort to promote greater
awareness of development
disarmament issues during "U.N.
Disarmament Week."
Rana described the link between

disarmament and development as a
"resource-based linkage," arguing
that the U.S.-Soviet arms race leads
to a misapplication of resources.
"Eighty-five percent of military
[research and development] in the
world is conducted by the U.S. and
the Soviets, and only 20 percent of it
can be used commercially," she said.
Rana called for the creation of a
"mutuality of interest ... basing de
velopment programs on a country's
specific resources. In the past, the
emphasis has been on high
technology." These countries could
then in turn alleviate future demand
side strains on industrialized Western
economies, she said.
