The Western Culture subcommittee on the is
sues of women and minorities which was ap
proved last spring will commence operations next
week, according to Carolyn Lougee, associate
dean of humanities and sciences.
Lougee said the subcommittee, formed in
response to concerns about the content of the
Western Culture program, will consist of her,
three faculty members and a group of students
appointed by the ASSU. The other committee
members have yet to be named.
The committee will look into ways to
restructure the existing Western Culture program
to include minorities and women, Lougee said.
She stressed that her involvement with the com
mittee is not as dean, but as an associate history
professor.
"Last year there was a very well focused and
articulated concern from minority students,
largely black," Lougee said. In response to these
concerns and a "perennial current of question
ing" among faculty members, Lougee recom
mended establishing the subcommittee to the
chairman of the Western Culture program.
Though she was asked to set up the subcom
mittee, Lougee said, "I simply have been so busy
with other things that I haven t had time to. She
hopes "to have it set up in about a week.
The Black Student Union was an active partici
pant in the debate over Western Culture. Last
winter the BSU Subcommittee for the Revision of
the Western Culture program issued a report to

the Western Culture Committee outlining the
black community's complaints against the pro
gram.
According to David Troutt, chairman and
founder of the BSU subcommittee, the report of
fered "a structural criticism of the course," and
stated problems with the program and how it
could be improved upon.
The report said "that the assumptions underly
ing the program are not only inaccurate, but
they're dangerously deficient in that they im

plicitly legitimate an ethno-centric view of West
ern culture," Troutt said.
The basic argument put forth by the BSU and
other critics of the existing Western Culture pro
gram states that the program is ethno-centric,
treating Western Culture as though it were created
in a vacuum and thereby ignoring the contribu
tions of women and minorities.
"It's important to restructure [the program] so
that it's much more academically sound and more
interesting," Troutt said.
