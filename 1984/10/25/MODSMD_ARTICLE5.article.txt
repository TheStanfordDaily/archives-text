# C-US eyes undergrad residences

### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will review a key University com
mittee's report detailing recommendations on University
housing policies at its meeting this afternoon.
The recommendations, part of an annual report issued
by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US), will
be sent to University President Donald Kennedy for his
evaluation.
A committee with faculty and student members, C-US
presented one recommendation which deals with fraterni
ties. Six of the twelve housing recommendations in the
report concern theme houses.
While the report encourages "active support" of theme
houses, it also recommends that "assignment to theme
houses be made solely on the basis of a student's demon
strated interest."
The recommendations that deal with theme houses are
revised versions of preliminary recommendations issued
earlier to the Faculty Senate.
According to C-US Chairman Bruce Parker, professor
of radiology and pediatrics, the preliminary recommenda
tion that freshmen be excluded from ethnic theme houses
met with considerable opposition in the Faculty Senate.
The recommendation in the current report is a modified
version that, Parker says, is the result of meetings held
last year with students.
The current report urges that "cultural theme houses be
open only to students who request to live in them," and
also states that "freshmen in cultural theme houses should
not be required to make the same formal commitment to
the educational theme" as upperclassmen.
"The reason we modified the version is that we met
with a very large number of students," Parker said. "The
committee was convinced that there was more to be
gained by living in a theme house than in not being
allowed to."
According to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, the
theme house recommendations are significant in that "this
is the first time we've seen the outcome of that debate."
However, Lyons was quick to emphasize that the C-US
report is intended for the senate's review and is not to be
acted upon.
"This is just a report on what the committee did last
year," Lyons said. "It's solely for their information, not
for action."
According to Parker, the final report to be sent to Ken
nedy will be prepared in one to two weeks.
Of 12 recommendations issued by C-US, one has
already received attention since being presented last year
to the Task Force to Study Fraternities and Sororities at
Stanford.
The report recommends that "all upper-class housing
assignments, including residential fraternities, be filled
through the residential draw."
Both Lyons and Parker agreed that the appearance of
the fraternity recommendation in the report should not
make a difference in the current situation.
"I think the task force took it as serious advice when we
sent it to them last year," Parker said. "I shouldn't think it
