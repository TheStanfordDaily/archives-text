# Linear collider work progresses

Next Wednesday will mark the
first anniversary of the
groundbreaking for the Stanford
Linear Collider (SLC). But at least
three more years will pass before the
completion of the new high-energy
physics device.
The collider will be completely in
stalled at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) in late win
ter or early spring of 1987, if plans
continue on schedule. After comple
tion there will be a three or four
month testing period before the
linear collider is running daily and
producing data, according to SLAC
Director Burton Richter.
Richter said the collider is being
constructed with assistance from
foreign countries, including Canada,
England and Italy. Researchers from
those countries are currently at Stan
ford working on the project.
The foreigners are supplying some
parts and materials, but they have
given no direct financial aid. "They
aren't sending us cash or checks,"
Richter said. The U.S. government is
funding the $116 million project.
"There is no formal international
agreement in this," the SLAC direc
tor said, explaining that SLAC simply
receives supplies for the linear col
lider from other nations. He said the

collaboration with the other countries
is a significant precedent in the world
of physics.
U.S. Energy Secretary Donald
Hodel gave the go-ahead for the
project last Oct. 31. Hodel said the
collider demonstrates "the adminis
tration's commitment to funding pure
research."
The two major goals of the new
device are to find the structure of
matter and the forces of nature.
Though several forces of nature have
been known for many years, re
searchers at SLAC will attempt to
find the "true" forces, according to
Sidney Drell, former deputy director
of SLAC and a major adviser in the
SLC planning.
Gravity, often considered a force of
nature, should actually not be put in,
that classification, Drell said, adding
that the definition of a force of nature,
"has changed a lot."
The linear collider will be two miles
long and will be added on to the exist
ing approximately two-kilometer
storage ring at SLAC, thereby saving
the cost of building an entirely new
facility.
In a conventional linear collider,
two accelerators fire intense clumps
of electrons and positrons at each
other and that collision releases en-;
ergy which can be used for another
collision to occur.
