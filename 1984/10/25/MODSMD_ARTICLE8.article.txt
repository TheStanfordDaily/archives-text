Social Security benefits to rise
WASHINGTON — Social Security benefits will go up 3.5 percent in
January, putting an extra $15 a month in the check of the average retired
worker and $26 for an elderly couple, the government announced yes
terday.
It will cost Social Security's trust funds $6.2 billion to pay the extra
benefits to the system's 36.1 million retired or disabled workers and
their families in the year ahead.
But when benefits go up, so does the ceiling on Social Security taxes.
The payroll tax in 1985 will be levied on earnings up to $39,600 in 1985,
up from $37,800 this year.
Coupled with a scheduled tax rate increase to 7.05 percent from 6.7
percent, that will cost 8.9 million workers up to $259.20 apiece, boosting
the maximum annual levy to $2,791.80. Employers will see their taxes
rise by $145.80 per worker at the top.
The Social Security system expects to take in $2 billion from raising
the wage base and $1.8 billion from the tax rate increase.
The benefit increase is the second consecutive annual 3.5 percent
hike, the smallest since benefits were tied to inflation in 1975. It became
official yesterday when the government released the Consumer Price In
dex for September.
Benefits now have climbed 108 percent since 1975. The biggest jumps
were in 1980 and 1981 — 14.3 and 11.2 percent.
FEMA director accused of fraud
WASHINGTON — Federal Emergency Management Agency Direc
tor Louis Giuffrida and his wife attended a $250-a-plate reception for
Vice President George Bush in February at the expense of a FEMA con
sulting firm, which then charged the evening to the government, accord
ing to documents made public yesterday.
The documents show that the contractor, the Triton Corp., paid
$2,000 after its executives took top FEMA officials to the Bush dinner,
which was held to raise funds for the National Republican Club. Accord
ing to an agency invoice, the firm later billed FEMA $2,000 for an un
specified "conference" at the Capitol Hill Club, as the Republican club
is commonly called, and FEMA says it paid the bill.
The documents also show that the agency has spent $5,000 in the last
year for Giuffrida's wife, Genevieve, to accompany her husband on first
class flights to Rome, Paris, Brussels, Tel Aviv and Mexico City.
And they show that Triton financed receptions for FEMA officials in
Washington and during Giuffrida's trips to Europe and Mexico, billing
the agency hundreds of dollars for hors d'oeuvres and liquor.
The records were among dozens of internal FEMA documents
released by Rep. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), chairman of the House Sci
ence and Technology investigations subcommittee.
Reagan honors Grenada invasion
WASHINGTON — At a White House ceremony heavy with cam
paign overtones, President Reagan yesterday celebrated the invasion of
Grenada a year ago today as "an anniversary of honor for America" that
demonstrated "the meaning of peace through strength."
Speaking in the East Room to an applauding audience of medical stu
dents who were taken off Grenada by U.S. troops, Reagan said the oper
ation marked a turning point in U.S. foreign policy away from the "self
doubt and national confusion" of the Carter administration.
Only once during the day did Reagan mention another recent anniver
sary, the Oct. 23 suicide bombing of the Marine headquarters in Beirut
where 241 U.S. servicemen were killed after a deployment that was
highly controversial within U.S. military circles. These dead servicemen,
Reagan said, "were heroes every bit as much in their peace-keeping mis
sion as were our soldiers in their rescue mission in Grenada."
Ferraro campaigns in Oakland
OAKLAND — Vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, saying
the nation was "going backwards" under President Reagan, appealed to
blacks and farmers yesterday before large and enthusiastic crowds on
her second day of campaigning across California.
Speaking to more than 8,000 people who sat in office windows and
packed the city hall plaza here for a sunny midday rally, the Democratic
vice-presidential nominee said Reagan's policies had been
"bad for America. But let's face it, they've been a disaster for blacks,
Hispanics and women."
She criticized Reagan for federal budget cuts in child nutrition pro
grams, public housing, student aid, and enforcement of civil rights laws
and praised her running mate, presidential nominee Walter Mondale for
"fighting for social justice."
Meanwhile, traveling by bus through farm towns in Illinois, Missouri
and lowa, Mondale yesterday recalled that rural voters were responsible
for Harry Truman's surprise victory in 1948 and pleaded for a Truman
like upset of his own.
Mondale and his entourage set out from Quincy, 111., in six buses
before dawn on a crisp autumn morning and traveled 117 miles north
along the Mississippi River — visiting four small towns, two family farms
and a package liquor store on the Missouri-lowa border. At each stop,
Mondale drew an enthusiastic crowd, and supporters rushed up to shake
his hand.
Contras not recalling pamphlets
WASHINGTON — Nicaraguan rebel officials said yesterday that
they have not ordered the recall of a CIA-produced guerrilla handbook
calling for the violent "neutralization" of Sandinista officials, despite
reports that the CIA had decided to withdraw the pamphlet.
They also claimed they never distributed the book widely — because,
one said, "we considered parts of it to be objectionable."
"I don't know of any order to recall it," said Alfonso Callejas, a mem
ber of the seven-member directorate of the Nicaraguan Democratic
Force, the largest rebel organization. "We never used it anyway, so how
could we recall it?"
Another official of the group said he was unaware of any move to
withdraw the manual, which has caused a furor in Congress.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), a member of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said on Tuesday that CIA officials told him they were recall
ing the pamphlet. Officials have said some 2,000 copies of the handbook
were printed for distribution to the rebels, who were financed by the
CIA until Congress cut off the program last spring.
S. African police sweeps criticized
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Opposition politicians and
several newspapers yesterday condemned a major police and army
search for "criminal and revolutionary elements" in black-African settle
ments.
Police reports described Tuesday's security operation in the sealed-off
townships of Sebokeng and Evaton, south of Johannesburg, as
"extremely successful." They said police searched the homes of 120,000
people and arrested 354 of them.
The defense spokesman of the opposition Progressive Federal Party,
Philip Myburgh, said of the raids, "The presence of the military creates
the impression among black South Africans that they are the enemies of
the state."
The newspaper Sowetan mainly directed at black readers, wrote, "The
occupation of Sebokeng by the army and police was to all intents and
purposes the kind of saber rattling that is disastrous. It is really about
time the government stopped such insane measures and sat down to talk
to the people."
Little change in stock prices
NEW YORK — Stock prices closed with little overall change for the
second straight session yesterday drawing no great inspiration from
declining interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.42 to 1,216.43,
recouping most of Tuesday's 4.19-point loss.

ing to documents made public yesterday.
The documents show that the contractor, the Triton Corp., paid
$2,000 after its executives took top FEMA officials to the Bush dinner,
which was held to raise funds for the National Republican Club. Accord
ing to an agency invoice, the firm later billed FEMA $2,000 for an un
specified "conference" at the Capitol Hill Club, as the Republican club
is commonly called, and FEMA says it paid the bill.
The documents also show that the agency has spent $5,000 in the last
year for Giuffrida's wife, Genevieve, to accompany her husband on first
class flights to Rome, Paris, Brussels, Tel Aviv and Mexico City.
And they show that Triton financed receptions for FEMA officials in
Washington and during Giuffrida's trips to Europe and Mexico, billing
the agency hundreds of dollars for hors d'oeuvres and liquor.
The records were among dozens of internal FEMA documents
released by Rep. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), chairman of the House Sci
ence and Technology investigations subcommittee.
Reagan honors Grenada invasion
WASHINGTON — At a White House ceremony heavy with cam
paign overtones, President Reagan yesterday celebrated the invasion of
Grenada a year ago today as "an anniversary of honor for America" that
demonstrated "the meaning of peace through strength."
Speaking in the East Room to an applauding audience of medical stu
dents who were taken off Grenada by U.S. troops, Reagan said the oper
ation marked a turning point in U.S. foreign policy away from the "self
doubt and national confusion" of the Carter administration.
Only once during the day did Reagan mention another recent anniver
sary, the Oct. 23 suicide bombing of the Marine headquarters in Beirut
where 241 U.S. servicemen were killed after a deployment that was
highly controversial within U.S. military circles. These dead servicemen,
Reagan said, "were heroes every bit as much in their peace-keeping mis
sion as were our soldiers in their rescue mission in Grenada."
Ferraro campaigns in Oakland
OAKLAND — Vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, saying
the nation was "going backwards" under President Reagan, appealed to
blacks and farmers yesterday before large and enthusiastic crowds on
her second day of campaigning across California.
Speaking to more than 8,000 people who sat in office windows and
packed the city hall plaza here for a sunny midday rally, the Democratic
vice-presidential nominee said Reagan's policies had been
"bad for America. But let's face it, they've been a disaster for blacks,
Hispanics and women."
She criticized Reagan for federal budget cuts in child nutrition pro
grams, public housing, student aid, and enforcement of civil rights laws
and praised her running mate, presidential nominee Walter Mondale for
"fighting for social justice."
Meanwhile, traveling by bus through farm towns in Illinois, Missouri
and lowa, Mondale yesterday recalled that rural voters were responsible
for Harry Truman's surprise victory in 1948 and pleaded for a Truman
like upset of his own.
Mondale and his entourage set out from Quincy, 111., in six buses
before dawn on a crisp autumn morning and traveled 117 miles north
along the Mississippi River — visiting four small towns, two family farms
and a package liquor store on the Missouri-lowa border. At each stop,
Mondale drew an enthusiastic crowd, and supporters rushed up to shake
his hand.
Contras not recalling pamphlets
WASHINGTON — Nicaraguan rebel officials said yesterday that
they have not ordered the recall of a CIA-produced guerrilla handbook
calling for the violent "neutralization" of Sandinista officials, despite
reports that the CIA had decided to withdraw the pamphlet.
They also claimed they never distributed the book widely — because,
one said, "we considered parts of it to be objectionable."
"I don't know of any order to recall it," said Alfonso Callejas, a mem
ber of the seven-member directorate of the Nicaraguan Democratic
Force, the largest rebel organization. "We never used it anyway, so how
could we recall it?"
Another official of the group said he was unaware of any move to
withdraw the manual, which has caused a furor in Congress.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), a member of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said on Tuesday that CIA officials told him they were recall
ing the pamphlet. Officials have said some 2,000 copies of the handbook
were printed for distribution to the rebels, who were financed by the
CIA until Congress cut off the program last spring.
S. African police sweeps criticized
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Opposition politicians and
several newspapers yesterday condemned a major police and army
search for "criminal and revolutionary elements" in black-African settle
ments.
Police reports described Tuesday's security operation in the sealed-off
townships of Sebokeng and Evaton, south of Johannesburg, as
"extremely successful." They said police searched the homes of 120,000
people and arrested 354 of them.
The defense spokesman of the opposition Progressive Federal Party,
Philip Myburgh, said of the raids, "The presence of the military creates
the impression among black South Africans that they are the enemies of
the state."
The newspaper Sowetan mainly directed at black readers, wrote, "The
occupation of Sebokeng by the army and police was to all intents and
purposes the kind of saber rattling that is disastrous. It is really about
time the government stopped such insane measures and sat down to talk
to the people."
Little change in stock prices
NEW YORK — Stock prices closed with little overall change for the
second straight session yesterday drawing no great inspiration from
declining interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.42 to 1,216.43,

Social Security benefits to rise
WASHINGTON — Social Security benefits will go up 3.5 percent in
January, putting an extra $15 a month in the check of the average retired
worker and $26 for an elderly couple, the government announced yes
terday.
It will cost Social Security's trust funds $6.2 billion to pay the extra
benefits to the system's 36.1 million retired or disabled workers and
their families in the year ahead.
But when benefits go up, so does the ceiling on Social Security taxes.
The payroll tax in 1985 will be levied on earnings up to $39,600 in 1985,
up from $37,800 this year.
Coupled with a scheduled tax rate increase to 7.05 percent from 6.7
percent, that will cost 8.9 million workers up to $259.20 apiece, boosting
the maximum annual levy to $2,791.80. Employers will see their taxes
rise by $145.80 per worker at the top.
The Social Security system expects to take in $2 billion from raising
the wage base and $1.8 billion from the tax rate increase.
The benefit increase is the second consecutive annual 3.5 percent
hike, the smallest since benefits were tied to inflation in 1975. It became
official yesterday when the government released the Consumer Price In
dex for September.
Benefits now have climbed 108 percent since 1975. The biggest jumps
were in 1980 and 1981 — 14.3 and 11.2 percent.
