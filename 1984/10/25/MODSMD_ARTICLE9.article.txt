MANILA, Philippines — Political
opponents of President Ferdinand
Marcos yesterday demanded his res
ignation and threatened to seek par
liamentary impeachment proceedings
against him. The call came after a
majority report by an official fact
finding board implicated a close asso
ciate and long-time confidant, armed
forces chief of staff Gen. Fabian Ver,
in a wide-ranging military conspiracy
to assassinate opposition leader
Benigno Aquino Jr. last year.
In response to the report yesterday,
Marcos in effect temporarily relieved
Ver and another top general of their
commands and ordered their prose
cution along with 23 other military
men and one civilian named by the
board's majority as "indictable" for
premeditated murder.
A separate dissenting report issued
Tuesday by the chairman of the five
member board did not name Ver —
only seven military men, including a
third general — in a limited "criminal
plot" to assassinate Aquino on Aug.
21, 1983, seconds after he arrived in
Manila after three years of self

imposed exile in the United States.
The seven were also named in the
majority report.
Marcos sent both reports to the
Justice Ministry for referral to an om
budsman and trial before a special ci
vilian court that usually hears corrup
tion cases against government offi
cials.
All three generals named in the
reports professed their innocence in
the Aquino case and demanded
speedy trials to clear their names.
The majority report, presented to
Marcos yesterday morning and subse
quently issued to the public, said that
26 persons were found "indictable for
the premeditated killing of Sen.
Benigno Aquino Jr. and Rolando
Galman." It said Galman, a small
time hoodlum gunned down immedi
ately after Aquino was shot, was set
up to take the blame for the assas
sination as part of the military con
spiracy.
Besides Ver, the report named
Maj. Gen. Prospero Olivas, the chief
of the Philippine Constabulary in
metro Manila; Brig. Gen. Luther

Custodio, the former commander of
the Aviation Security Command as
signed to protect the country's air
ports; 20 officers and men under Cus
todio's command; Col. Vicente Tigas,
a press relations officer at the
Malacanang presidential palace; Col.
Arturo Custodio (no relation to the
general), a friend of Galman who
fetched him at his home four days
before the assassination; and Her
milio Gosuico, a businessman who
accompanied Col. Custodio.
To replace Ver during his
"temporary leave of absence,"
Marcos appointed the deputy chief of
staff and Philippine Constabulary
Commander, Gen. Fidel Ramos, 56,
as "acting chief of staff." Both Ramos
and Ver are distant cousins of
Marcos, and both hail from his home
region of Ilocos in the northern
Philippines.
Ramos, a West Point graduate who
served with Philippine forces in
Korea and Vietnam, is widely
respected among Philippine officers
and foreign military attaches, accord
ing to military sources. They see in his

appointment a chance to improve the
image of the increasingly beleaguered
Philippine armed forces and remove
the taint of the Aquino assassination.
The assassination of Aquino, 50, as
he was leaving a China Airlines plane
at the Manila International Airport
under military escort, plunged the
Philippines into a political and eco
nomic crisis at a time of mounting
pressure on the government by Com
munist insurgents. The military and
the Marcos government blamed the
Communists for Aquino's murder,
but both reports of the fact-finding
board rejected that contention after
nearly a year of investigation.
In Washington, the State Depart
ment welcomed as "a positive devel
opment" Marcos' actions in sending
both majority and minority reports to
a special court for prosecution. The
department, in an unusually strong
public signal of its views, had issued a
statement Tuesday suggesting that
Ver be prosecuted if commission
charges were made against him.
