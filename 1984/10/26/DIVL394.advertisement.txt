Announcement of
SPECIAL GRANT-IN-AID PROGRAM
Graduate Division
Last spring, Gerald J. Lieberman, Vice Provost and Dean of
Graduate Studies and Research, established a special Grant-in-Aid
program to help meet the problem of graduate students with un
usual financial hardship. The program continues in 1984-85. Eligi
bility and application procedures are as follows:
Students admitted to study for a doctoral level degree (PhD, DMA,
EdD) in the Schools of Earth Science, Education, Engineering,
Humanities and Sciences, and Medicine (PhD programs) are eligi
ble to apply. Applications are encouraged from students ex
periencing financial hardship, associated particularly with family or
medical circumstances, who cannot reasonably be expected to al
leviate the financial difficulty through fellowship or loan sources.
Preference is given to students nearing completion of their degree.
This grant is not intended to be used as complete support for stu
dents where other sources of aid have ceased, nor can grants be
made for dissertation costs under this program.
All non-immigrant foreign students must have reviewed their finan
cial needs with an advisor at the Bechtel International Center be
fore submitting an application for a special grant-in-aid. The Inter
national Center advisor will submit to the Grant-in-Aid Committee a
review and recommendation for each foreign applicant.
Every applicant is required to submit the following documents to the
Committee.
1. A completed financial summary sheet.
2. Student and spouse's latest income tax statement and parents' state
ment if student is dependent (as defined by federal criteria).
3. A detailed statement from advisor on status toward completion of de
gree. This should be a separate statement that includes progress on the
thesis, rate of progress and expected time of completion of the degree.
4. GAPSAS form with parental information, if dependent by federal criteria,
if a current form is not on file with the University.
5. An academic progress statement on Grant-in-Aid form.
6. A statement of consent that documents submitted may be reviewed by
all members of the Grant-in-Aid Committee, which includes two student
representatives.
Further information on the program can be obtained from
Carolyn Smith in the Graduate Awards Office.
