# Rally recalls Grenada invasion
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
The invasion of Grenada last year symbolizes the
"discriminatory and oppressive" policies of the
Reagan administration toward the Third World,
according to speakers at a rally in White Plaza yes
terdaju*- -
About 120 people attended the last-minute rally,
which was organized by a coalition of student
groups to mark the anniversary of the U.S. invasion
of Grenada.
Afterward, about 20 of those people marched to
a CIA recruiting station in the business school to
demonstrate against the recruiters' presence on
campus.
Four speakers — one journalist and three stu
dents — gave speeches at the rally connecting the
theme of last year's invasion with several other in
stances of what Alice Stauffer, one of the coordina
tors of Students Against Reaganism (STAR),
termed "discriminatory and oppressive policies
that symbolize this administration's attitude toward
Third-World people, both here and abroad."
The Reagan administration has said the chief

reasons for its invasion of Grenada were to liberate
American medical students there and to stop the
development of an airport it said was going to be
used for military purposes by the Soviet Union and
Cuba.
The speeches given at the rally were intended to
disprove those justifications and to present oppos
ing viewpoints to the administration's policies in
Central America and South Africa and toward
minorities in this country.
The emotional highlight of the rally came during
a speech by Steve Phillips, a member of the Third
World Caucus of STAR. He indicted the Reagan
administration and what he called the
"conservative right wing" for opposing progressive
movements for human and civil rights "every step
of the way."
"Ronald Reagan did not invade Grenada to
restore democracy," Phillips said. "If he wanted
democracy, he would have invaded South Africa.
"Freedom is contagious," he continued. "If one
gets free, everyone wants to be free. The conserva
tive right wing could not stand to see an indepen
dent black nation too close to the American South.

American blacks might start getting ideas from
their brothers and sisters in Grenada.
"You can make a difference," Phillips con
cluded, exhorting his audience to become involved
in efforts to "support all people who are fighting
for freedom, justice and equality" in the world.
"I am only one, but I am one," Phillips said. "I
cannot do everything, but I can do something. And
what I can do, 1 ought to do. And what I ought to
do, I must do. And what I must do, by the grace of
God Almighty, I shall do."
After the rally ended, about 20 students took up
cries of "Neutralize the CIA " and "No more se
cret wars " as they marched to the business school
to picket a CIA recruiting station there. The
demonstration lasted fewer than five minutes, after
which the students went their separate ways.
Steve Dauber, president of the Stanford Cpllege
Republicans, said the statements made at the rally
discredit the Democrats' cause.
"I would like you to publish all those quotes, be
cause they aptly characterize the ludicrousness of
the position of the left," he said.
