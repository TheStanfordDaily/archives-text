## Wanderings by Marilyn Wann Yes, Mom and Dad, I joined the team 
### 
Dear tuition-paying parents:
Welcome to your daughter's first
letter home from college. Please fas
ten seatbelts and extinguish all
cancer-causing combustibles. Prepare
for communication.
Remember when you dropped me
off here a month ago? Well, I just did
my first load of wash, and .. . no,
Mom, stop choking on your Sanka.
I'm kidding.
I was thinking of your admonition
(and I quote), "Get our $15,000
worth out of this place or forget about
coming home for Thanksgiving din
ner."
Well, start saving up for the turkey,
because sweet, demure, barely 18-
year-old Marilyn has joined the foot
ball team. Yes, Dad, football. As in
knee operations, sweaty socks and
Gatorade.
Stop that giggling, now. You think
that just because I once needed 17
stitches after playing Nerf football
with some kids I was babysitting, I
can't make the team?
So what if I rigged our TV set to
show "Brady Bunch" reruns
whenever "Monday Night Football"
with my hero and yours, Howard
Cosell, came on. It was just a phase I
was going through.

Seriously, my qualifications got me
on the team for a whole day.
Think about it. You remember in
third grade when I saved the kickball
game with a wild shot that rebounded
off Mrs. Lyday and rolled across the
playground? All that athletic energy
has just been building up since then.
I spent a year carrying a glock
enspiel in the high school marching
band, too, so you could say I know
my way around a football field.
I don't even mind having to abide
by all the traditions of the sport â€”
players congratulating each other
with friendly fanny pats and all.
So I became a walk-on, a term that
is usually applied to players who
weren't recruited from high schools,
but who trained and tried out once
they got to Stanford.
In my case, I just walked on down
to a pre-game recruit meeting at the
Athletic Department one Saturday.
There were some really big recruits
there who had driven down from
Washington, so 1 didn't say too much
about my arduous walk from Flo Mo.
One cucumber sandwich, a bag of
Fritos and some small talk later, the
head recruiter, Dick James, started
introducing everybody by their stats
and home towns.

When he got lo me, he said, "This
is a recruit from The Daily. She came
here today to be treated like you
men."
It seems every time I try to connect
myself with football I get giggles.
I was talking to freshman kicker
David Sweeney about this and he
said, "Well, I think you lack the ne
cessary, um . . . height."
What a reason. Of course, he had
nine inches on me at the time, and
even then he had to look up to most
of his teammates.
Being recruited would have been
flattering. Lucrative, too, since 90
percent of the team is on full scholar
ship. Yeah, now I bet you wish you'd
given me a pair of cleats and sent me
out to play ball instead of paying tor
nine years of piano lessons.
After the Washington State game, I
thought going to Monday's practice
would be a grim experience, but the
only hard part was wearing the uni
form.
It was worse than the first day ot
kindergarten when you pinned my
lunch money to my shirt in a manila
envelope, Mom. Don't deny it, you
did do that.
Seeing me wearing shoulder pads,
jersey and helmet is about equivalent

to seeing Tom Selleck in black fish
nets and four-inch heels, judging by
the looks I got.
Putting on the contraption is diffi
cult enough. All the helmets
anywhere near my size gave me ear
lobectomies, so I took one that would
have accommodated H.R. Puf
fenstuff. Very becoming.
Shoulder pads are a broadening ex
perience, too. Wearing them for
prolonged periods feels something
like roller skating for too long. You
develop this new view of yourself
with doorway-wide shoulders and
useless, dangling arms.
It's a good thing there are no mir
rors between Encina Gym and the
field behind Maples Pavilion, or I
never would have made it to practice.
Once 1 got to the field, I saw
players doing warm-up exercises that
didn't look like anything I've ever
seen on a Jane Fonda video.
They started with rhythmic clap
ping that crescendoed into a primal
yell/grunt and then did about five
minutes of contortions followed by
another 10 minutes of the type of
running one would expect from a
ballroom dancer sprinting through a
minefield.
I tried to picture myself even at
tempting those gaits and my
shoelaces came untied.
Most of the two-hour practice is
spent doing skeleton plays, where the
offense works on its timing or both
groups work on adjusting to the next
opponent's patterns.
Eric Price, a senior at defensive
back, stood at the sidelines on an
ankle he twisted in the last game and
yelled at me, "What are you doing
suited up? You're late for practice.
Go run over those strings 10 times."
Then he flashed a well-practiced
"Hi Mom" grin and started explain
ing the four basic defensive responses
to most offensive plays.
I can't tell you much about it even
now. I had hoped there would be a dic
tionary on it in the bookstore. Some
thing like "Tackling to Maim" or
"The Book of Basic Blocks."
I gave up my dream to become the
first 5-foot-3 linebacker when some
players roared off the field in front of
my toes after one play. They sounded
more powerful than the Clydesdales
in Budweiser commercials and

looked more intimidating than the
automated teller window at Tresid
der.
Maybe the fact that Price had a
congenial nickname like Hitman dis
suaded me, too.
I did find one person I could iden
tify with at practice. Twelve-year-old
Brian Nelson comes from San Carlos
every Monday to snag balls for the
kickers and punters.
He had a mortal-sized football that
I could hold without dislocating my
thumb, so we tossed a few to keep me
from looking too useless and or
namental.
I made the mistake of standing in
the path to the weightroom at the end
of practice, and my final impression
was one of bewilderment. "What do I

look likfe cringing in the middle of a
stampeding throng of well-trained
athlete-giants?" I wondered. So
much for trying to fit in.
Once again, I made my way past
people's obvious stares to Encina
Gym's equipment room.
On the way, two guys demon
strated the compelling power of
curiosity and asked if I played on the
girls' football team.
The idea was so absurd, I had to
answer accordingly.
"Of course, haven't you ever heard
of Title IX?" I quipped.
It's too bad I can't be on the team
full time, though. Think of what Td
save on season tickets.
Send money,
Marilyn

Here I am with Dwain Hamilton, Bill Jackson, Eric Price and Toi Cook. These guys filled me in on offensive
and defensive strategy.

Stylish, huh? I like the H.R. Puffenstuff effect.
