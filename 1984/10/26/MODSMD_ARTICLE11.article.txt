## The 						Stanford Daily A 						disturbing pattern 
### 
Will Rogers said it best 50 years ago when he
asked, "What the hell are we doing in
Nicaragua?"
For four years the CIA has been engaging in
the most public "covert" war in history. Last
March, President Reagan said that the United
States did not want to "destabilize or overthrow
the government of Nicaragua."
Then it was revealed that the CIA was mining
the harbors of Nicaragua, violating international
law and incurring the wrath of the world commu
nity.
Now we find that the CIA has been distributing
a manual on terrorism to the Nicaraguan contras.
In this manual are instructions on how to assas
sinate — or " neutralize " — Nicaraguan officials.
What we have suspected for years has now
become quite evident. The United States is trying
to overthrow the sovereign government of the
people of Nicaragua. And that is illegal.
Reagan said the manual was prepared by a
"gentleman" in that region who was contracted
to do the job. But that claim lacks credence. The
leadership of the CIA has known about the
manual for at least a year. Clearly, the policy was,
if not sanctioned, at least condoned by this ad
ministration.

For 40 years, the United States supported the
ruthless dictatorship of the Somoza family. Five
years ago, the people rose up and revolted (much
like a larger country to the north did in 1776).
The Sandinistas have the support of the
Nicaraguan people. Just because they have cho
sen a Marxist economic structure does not give
the United States the right to intervene in their
internal affairs.
The ClA's actions in Nicaragua are part of a
disturbing pattern. Before we invaded Cuba, the
CIA tried to kill Castro. Before we invaded Viet
nam, we supported the assassination ot Ngo Dinh
Diem. And before we invaded Grenada, the CIA
supported attempts to kill Maurice Bishop. In
this light, Daniel Ortega's warning of an im
minent invasion should not be taken lightly.
Our own Declaration of Independence says
that people have a right to overthrow govern
ments that suppress their "unalienable rights."
Why, then, does the Reagan administration
oppose the will of the people in South Africa,
Chile, the Philippines and Nicaragua?
It's good that Reagan wasn't King of England
in the 17705. He would have sent the CIA to as
sassinate George Washington.
