Need continuity
The editorial (The Daily, Oct. 23)
concerning the number of terms
which a ASSU senator can hold
office, while reasonable on the
surface, disregards a few important
realities of the representative system
which the ASSU is supposed to
uphold.
First, the ASSU Senate is a repre
sentative body which, by definition,
allows the students to select the
people who they feel are most com
mitted to representing their interests.
Second, because of the nature of
the senate, this amendment would
only affect graduate senators, since
most undergraduates are not eligible
to be elected for more than three
terms. The impact of this becomes
obvious when it is pointed out â€” the
graduate students historically have a
problem filling their senate seats.
Third, the limitation of terms
destroys the badly needed continuity
which the ASSU so desperately
needs.
Finally, the editorial is incorrect
when it states that "the power ac
cumulated by elder senators tends to
undercut new ideas." As a member
of the senate for two years, I learned
that input is not related to the num
ber of years a senator has served.
Contrary to The Daily's editorial
position, I believe that the few
people who have given so much of
their time in service to students
should be commended, not punished.

Leave Reagan alone
I wonder if it ever occurred to the
many Ronald Reagan-hating
Democrats on campus that perhaps
some of their friends and/or class
mates do not appreciate their acid
criticisms of the president of the
United States, especially those of a
personal nature that are blatantly
untrue (Reagan is senile, stupid,
etc.).
Like the majority of the American
people, including many members of
the Stanford community, I support

Reagan and plan to vote for him in
November. 1 am offended by the
senseless and cruel remarks which
are made about my candidate, as
well as hurt by the total disregard for
my feelings with which these com
ments are made.
Considering both viewpoints is
essential before an election, and I
enjoy intelligent repartee with those
who support Vice President Walter
Mondale. I'm tired of walking away
from potentially meaningful con
versations that seem to digress due
to unsubstantiated name-calling.

Fraternity games
This letter is to express my outrage
at the conduct of certain members of
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at the
Stanford-University of Washington
football game on Oct. 13.
From the time they arrived at their
seats until the end of the game, these
"boys" drank heavily, moving from
bourbon and Coke to a keg of beer.
Whether due to their heavy con
sumption of liquor or to their innate
insensitivity, they continually
spouted the most vulgar commentary
1 have ever heard at a football game.
Throughout the game, led by some
apparently visiting fraternity bro
thers from the University of Washing
ton, the members of Phi Kappa Psi
made crude and vulgar jokes about
every girl who passed down the aisle,
about Geraldine Ferraro and about
female anatomy in general. They
loudly sang "drinking" songs which
contained numerous references to
female anatomy and sexuality of the
type found in Hustler magazine.
In this day and age, and at a uni
versity as well-respected as Stanford,
it is both disheartening and aggravat
ing to hear post-adolescent fraternity
boys spend an entire football game
spouting crude and obscene remarks
in front of a captive audience includ
ing many women. Certainly they
can't be stopped from thinking a
certain way, but isn't it time some
one told them that this type of lewd
behavior is no longer acceptable in

public? At a public event where tight
seating arrangements make it vir
tually impossible to move, it is
inexcusable that such garbage should
be tolerated.

Full page payment
I guess only a Republican could
afford to take out a full-page ad in
support of his candidate.

Being truly pro-life
Come on. President Reagan and
all you Reagan "pro-lifers." Get off
your self-righteous stumps and admit
that you're using the abortion issue
for political gain! You don't really
care about the unborn; obviously this
is true because you don't care about
those already born. Cut food stamps,
cut hot lunches, cut Aid to Families
with Dependent Children, cut educa
tional loans, cut disability benefits,
cut off all lifelines and let each indi
vidual struggle for survival in this
dog-eat-dog country of ours. Then,
increase nuclear weapons, increase
covert aid, increase the level of
hostility in the world and leave its
people dangling on the precipice of
disaster.
To be pro-life, ladies and
gentlemen, means to hold all life in
the highest regard, whether it be the
life of an unborn child, a hardened
criminal, a ghetto teen, a homeless
senior, a "sitting-duck" Marine, even
an "evil. Godless" communist. Of
course, we shouldn't forget animals
and the environment. Your defini
tion is narrow, self-serving and a
disgraceful example of how low some
people will go to cover up insen
sitivity and economic selfishness. As
a loyal American and a good Catho
lic, I am ashamed of the present
administration and ashamed of those
who support them in their anti-life
policies.
