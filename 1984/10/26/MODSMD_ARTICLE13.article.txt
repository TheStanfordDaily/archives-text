## More fraternities needed for equity 
### 
I applaud The Daily on its recent editorial en
dorsing continued housing for Stanford fraternities
(The Daily, Oct. 1 9). I wish the issue could be so
easily resolved. However, the editorial board's sud
den shift in opinion only indicates that the prob-

VIEWPOINT

lems ot traternities, sororities and housing are far
too complex to go away with the stroke of a pen.
Stanford's current policies are clearly unsuitable.
Thirteen groups, each predominantly white and all
male. have special rights to University housing; an
equal number of newer fraternal organizations, in
cluding several sororities and predominantly black
groups, do not. Furthermore, these groups cannot
even apply for housing, thanks to a moratorium
imposed in 1982 by an administration fearful of un
controlled expansion of Greek housing.
One year ago, Dean of Student Affairs James Ly
ons appointed a task force to study the issue and re
solve these inequities. After five months of extensive
review, the task force recommended the elimina
tion of subjective student control over access to
housing — a solution which is unpalatable to many
on campus. This recommendation, if taken literally,
would bring an end to Stanford's tradition of frater
nal housing.
Does it make sense to eliminate a form of stu
dent living merely because admission is
"subjectively selective"? Stanford defines its ob
jectives for undergraduate housing by such phrases
as "building strong communities" and "residential
education." Most fraternities provide stronger
communities than draw-filled housing, and their
educational value is fairly typical of upperclass
residences. The winning argument within the task
force was that subjective selectivity is morally ques
tionable and should not be rewarded with housing
privileges. But is it wise for Stanford to eradicate a
popular way of life, merely on the basis of a highly

questionable moral principle?
Admittedly, subjective selection can hurt people.
So can a bad draw number, though that sort of re
jection often isn't taken as personally. Stanford's
experience has been that selection is more harmful
in non-housed than in housed fraternal groups, and
I doubt that male-female differences adequately
explain this phenomenon. In a house, selection
tends to be more objective, focusing more on a per
son's real contributions to a living group than on

Subjective selection,
despite its negative con
notations, can also pro
vide great benefits.

surface factors of status and appearance. Hence,
the "evils" of subjectivity fail to justify the task
force's proposed move toward a non-housed Greek
system.
Subjective selection, despite its negative conno
tations, can also provide great benefits. In such
areas as college admissions and job interviewing,
subjectivity has long been valued in building effec
tive communities and teams to accomplish impor
tant goals. In fraternity houses, personal selection
gives residents a reason to trust each other and to
take responsibility for one another. These commu
nity bonds are occasionally found in draw-filled
houses, but only with hard work and a dose of luck;
they are almost inevitable in a fraternity house.
What, then, is wrong with the status quo at Stan
ford? It is simply unfair and irrational that some
gtoups are housed while others are permanently
frozen out. If the moratorium is lifted, so that all

groups (fraternal and otherwise) may have an equal
chance at the benefits of group-filled housing, the
existing inequities disappear. The University might
be unable to accommodate all groups who would
then apply for houses. If so, houses ought to be al
located on the basis of self-sufficiency and educa
tional criteria — not by grandfathered rights for
those now housed, nor by automatic exclusion of
subjectively selective groups.
I am not suggesting that all of Stanford's fraterni
ties deserve their houses. For many years, fraterni
ties have understood that University housing is
theirs only so long as they comply with communis
standards for behavior, go.ernance and education.
Perhaps Stanford should raise its expectations of
fraternal groups in light of heightened concern over
subjective selection. Some existing groups might
then fall short. The number of housed fraternities
and sororities might decrease, or it might increase.
While numbers are a valid concern, it is far more
important that housing opportunities be available
to all groups on an equitable basis. Fraternal organ
izations serve a valid purpose on campus, and Stan
ford's goal should be to strengthen them — not to
take away existing resources.
The task force's report has not yet been released.
Lyons, who must respond to the recommendations,
has indicated that the housing issue will not be
decided until next year. Until then, Stanford frater
nities and sororities have an ideal opportunity to
make their case for continued Greek housing on
campus. Do fraternal groups really benefit the
Stanford community? Are there some viable, equi
table alternatives to the task force's recommenda
tion? Fraternities and sororities must provide the
answers to these questions. Above all, the campus
wide dialogue must go on.
