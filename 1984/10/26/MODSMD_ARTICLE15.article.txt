## The 						other election 
### 
With all attention focused on the U.S. elections Nov. 6,
another election might be forgotten — one that might
have even greater historical consequences.
On Nov. 4, Nicaragua will become the first socialist
revolution to hold democratic elections. If these elections
are a success, they will be a milestone of the same impor
tance as, say, the signing of the Declaration of Indepen
dence: They will mark the beginning of the first socialist
democracy.
Not that democracy and socialism haven't been tried to
gether before. Salvador Allende showed in Chile that a
radical left movement could take power through electoral
politics. What he also proved, unfortunately, was that the
opponents of socialism, both at home and abroad, are
willing to destroy democracy to prevent this kind of
popular movement from effecting real change.
Latin America has a long tradition of vote fraud, cor
ruption and political violence that has made elections
largely meaningless, and an equally long tradition of mili
tary dictators who have stepped in when they weren't. It
took the grass-roots revolution of the Sandinistas to pro
vide the prerequisites for democratic participation in
Nicaragua.
But are the Sandinistas allowing this democratic poten
tial to develop? President Reagan says that the
Nicaraguans intend to hold "Soviet-style sham elections."
An examination of the political situation in Nicaragua
reveals where the sham really is: in a U.S.-style disin
formation campaign.
Nicaragua is not the 'totalitarian dungeon' of Reagan
rhetoric. The government does not execute people or
condone extrajudicial murders. There are no death
squads, unless you count the U.S.-backed contras. Oppo
sition leaders speak out without fear of arrest. In short,
the picture of Nicaragua presented to the American
people — as in George Bush's bug-eyed debate perfor
mance — is almost totally distorted.
The issue of press freedom is a serious one. There is
censorship in Nicaragua, which has sometimes been
heavy-handed. But there is an opposition paper, which
bitterly criticizes the government: La Prensa.
La Prensa is touted by our administration as the last
voice of independent thought in Nicaragua. Actually,
there is another independently-owned daily paper in
Managua, El Nuevo Diario. It's published by the uncle of
the owner of La Prensa, and took most of La Prensa's staff
when it started publishing. But it generally supports the
Sandinistas, so it doesn't provide much grist for the
propaganda mill.
To put things in perspective, before the revolution there
was a 55 percent illiteracy rate, and now it is less than 15
percent. The government has to be given some credit for
educating many Nicaraguans who would otherwise not
even be able to read La Prensa's criticisms.
This is the situation in which the Nov. 4 elections are
being held. Seven parties are participating, ranging from

the Democratic Conservative Party to parties which
criticize the Sandinistas for not being more Marxist-
Leninist. Each party gets campaign money and 15 minutes
a day of free TV time.
The U.S. press has ignored the wide degree of alterna
tives present in the election — much wider, for example,
than in El Salvador — and has chosen instead to focus on the
boycott led by Arturo Cruz. The election is portrayed as
meaningless without the participation of his right-wing

There has been talk of a

vasion or escalation of the
war against Nicaragua.

coalition, who are boycotting because the Sandinistas
refuse to postpone the election from Nov. 4 to sometime
in January.
Five years after the revolution, almost a year since the
date of the election was set, Cruz decides he hasn't had
enough time to campaign. One would think that if
Nicaragua were the gulag Reagan makes it out to be,
people would leap at the chance to vote for Cruz.
But everyone — from the Sandinistas to the State De
partment — is predicting a Sandinista victory. Cruz —
who, by the way, is endorsed by the contras would lose
just as surely if the election were held in January or No
vember.
So why is Cruz, and the Reagan administration, pres
suring the Sandinistas to postpone their election, after five
years of criticism for not having them soon enough? The
placement of the election, two days before ours, is no acci
dent. There has been talk of a "December surprise," an
invasion or escalation of the war against Nicaragua, when
Reagan would not be constrained by the need for re
election. It will be harder for him to move against a gov
ernment legitimated by elections.
Reagan is right about one thing: The Sandinistas are a
threat to American hegemony. They have a chance to
demonstrate that a socialist democracy — one that can
provide food, health care, and education to its people — is
possible. Worse, they show that a revolution is necessary
to achieve it. Reagan will go to great lengths to prevent
this from being an example to the rest of the world.
