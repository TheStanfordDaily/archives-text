# Food service supports system
## Meal-card computer crashes 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
Despite a recent major crash of the
magnetic meal-card computer sys
tem, University Food Service officials
say the new cards are relatively fault
free and living up to expectations.
"The new system adds flexibility
and options. Students (with a 10- or
14-a-week plan) can eat any meal,"
said Kay Gaskin, Food Service ad
ministrative assistant. "1 think it will
work."
Under the new computerized sys
tem, students are no longer forced to
eat a precise combination of meals —
dinners with only breakfasts or
lunches. The cards, which are de
signed to be issued only once during a
student's undergraduate career, also
make the counting of diners more ac
curate and cut down on the fraud
common in the previous flash-card
method.
Yet last week, the system suffered
a serious setback when the campus
computer network went down, allow
ing students to eat without a lowering
of their weekly food total.
"We first thought there was a prob
lem in the software. - ' Gaskin ex
plained in reference to some initial,
smaller problems that had occurred in
approximately 60 students cards.
"But when the CPU (central process
ing unit) went crazy and when the

memory shut down, we traced the
problem to the mainframe."
The computer broke down last
Friday and was fixed by Monday
morning, Gaskin said. Only minor
problems occurred since the student
count, which determines the food ser
vice income, was taken manually.
Although Gaskin does expect to
have a few problems with card
mutilation and magnetization in the
future, she said she believes that "the
main problem — the hardware — is
solved."
Food service's apparent satisfac
tion with the workings of the new
cards is not echoed by several skepti
cal students.
"It's easier now to go to Sterling
Quad with the meal exchange," said
sophomore Katrina Lane, but she
contends that "we ought to be able to
let our guests eat on the cards instead
of paying cash."
According to Gaskin, allowing
guests to eat on students' cards would
upset the price structure of the sys
tem.
"Meal prices are based on an ab
sentee factor," Gaskin said. "We
have found that students who are on a
19-meal plan cat only 75 percent [of
the available meals]." Students with
14-meal plans eat about 80 percent of
their meals, and those with 10-meal

plans eat 90 to 93 percent.
Gaskin explained that this factor is
"built in before setting the prices." A
restructuring of the system to allow
for students eating 100 percent of
their meals would mean that the
"price would have to go up," she said.
Other complaints focus on the
cards' versatility.
"They kind of annoy me," said
senior Tina Lee, "because they have
the capacity for doing a lot of good
things and all they do is count."
The card, which is produced by
Valadine Company and is in use at
the University of the Pacific, Univer
sity of Virginia, Dartmouth College
and the Claremont Colleges, was cho
sen because of its potential for ex
panded use at places such as the Stan
ford Bookstore and libraries.
A committee is currently examin
ing the possibility of a magnetic iden
tification card which could be used
University-wide and meet the needs
of different departments.
But until the full capacity is
realized, complaints will likely con
tinue.
"If they try to improve food ser
vice, this isn't the way to go," said
senior Weike Liem. "When you
design a system, you might as well
design i! right. "
