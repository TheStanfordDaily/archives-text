## The 						horrors of Halloween begin tonight 
### 
A group of dark-robed figures
moves mysteriously, hands joined, in
a circle. At the center of the circle
barns a bonfire into which each of the
figures casts an object — a handful of
apple parings, a stalk of wheat. Sud
denly, one of the robed figures stops
with a cry: An apparition, he an
nounces, has risen from the flames.
Sound typical of the way you
usually spend your Halloween?
"Hallowed evening," the night before
All Saints Day, was the night to
honor the souls of the dead in Druid
days. Because all things supernatural
roamed the earth that night —
demons, witches, and goblins — it
was also the night to exorcise evil
spirits.
The spirit of Halloween has
changed quite a bit since then, but
many of our current fanciful activities
have their origins in such ominous
ceremonies. We still carve pumpkins,
wear costumes, go to dances, play a
game with apples and enact spirited
mischief.
Where can you find and practice
such rites this Halloween season? If
you're looking for some off-campus
fun, there's plenty to be found in the
area. The New Varsity on University
Avenue will host its annual costume
party on Wednesday, Halloween
night. Besides free popcorn, a fog
machine and general Halloween ac
tivities, the Varsity will be showing
that cult classic, "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show," along with "Phantom
of the Paradise." If you're hoping to
see some horrors and get a thrill out
of screaming at a scary motion
picture, but can do without a party,
the Bijou is showing "Night of the
Living Dead" and "Creepshow" on
Halloween.
Casa Maria, a Mexican Restaurant
on El Camino Real in Los Altos, will
hold a Halloween night costume
party from 8:00 until closing. Activ
ities will include bobbing for apples;
the house specialty is pumpkin mar
garitas.
Prizes will be awarded for best
costumes at most of these events,
which brings us to the crucial ques
tion that everyone seems to agonize
over on Halloween afternoon: What
will you wear? Where will you get
your costume, or how will you create
your own?

Masks, accessories and ghoulish
supplies can he found at drug stores,
beauty supply stores, and novelty
shops in Palo Alto. Character
Costumes on Cambridge Avenue also
rents costumes at prices ranging from
$20-$45. According to the manager
of Character Costumes, there is no
new trend in disguises this year,
though Boy George and gremlins ap
pear to be particularly popular with
the high-school set. Darth Vader will
make the rounds again; Character
Costume's version rents for $70.
You're likely to see much of the usual
fare this year — devils, gangsters, and
pregnant nuns. Character Costumes
recommends starting early on
costume hunting. Many of us know
from experience what it's like trying
to get a costume together in a
jammed store the day of the party.
Of course, Halloween is on a
weeknight. Does that mean you'll
have to miss all the fun if you stay
home and study Wednesday night?
No, of course not. A drive down to
Santa Cruz isn't too far for a weekend
night out, and the Santa Cruz Beach
Boardwalk amusement park will be
the scene for a costume ball Sunday,
, Oct. 28 at 7:30 p.m. The annual sell
out dance, sponsored by Santa Cruz's
"Good Times" publications, features
the Elvin Bishop Band. Tickets are
available through BASS, $8 in ad
vance or $9.50 at the door.
Also down south is Marriott's
Great America amusement park in
Santa Clara. Great America's Hallo
ween escapade, "Friday Night IV,"
spans three nights, Oct. 27, 28 and
31. At Great America you'll be able
to visit the Chamber of Horrors and
Von Dark's crumbling estate, com
plete with cemetary, giant lizards and
ghosts. Costume contests are slated
for 8:30 each evening in the Theatre
Royale. Admission is $9.95.
Halloween may be Wednesday, but
the Stanford Band is starting things
off tonight at Pier 39 in San Fran
cisco. The Pier is the site of tonight's
"Monster Dash," a five-kilometer
race that will take up to 1,500 run
ners around Fisherman's Wharf. Pre
race events, starting a 10 p.m., will
feature the Stanford Band, in
costume. After the race, a midnight
bash ($3 cover charge) on the pier
will feature more live music, refresh
ments, and a costume contest.

Santa Clara. Great America's Hallo
ween escapade, "Friday Night IV,"
spans three nights, Oct. 27, 28 and
31. At Great America you'll be able
to visit the Chamber of Horrors and
Von Dark's crumbling estate, com
plete with cemetary, giant lizards and
ghosts. Costume contests are slated
for 8:30 each evening in the Theatre
Royale. Admission is $9.95.
Halloween may be Wednesday, but
the Stanford Band is starting things
off tonight at Pier 39 in San Fran
cisco. The Pier is the site of tonight's
"Monster Dash," a five-kilometer
race that will take up to 1,500 run
ners around Fisherman's Wharf. Pre
race events, starting a 10 p.m., will
feature the Stanford Band, in
costume. After the race, a midnight
bash ($3 cover charge) on the pier
will feature more live music, refresh
ments, and a costume contest.

A group of dark-robed figures
moves mysteriously, hands joined, in
a circle. At the center of the circle
barns a bonfire into which each of the
figures casts an object — a handful of
apple parings, a stalk of wheat. Sud
denly, one of the robed figures stops
with a cry: An apparition, he an
nounces, has risen from the flames.
Sound typical of the way you
usually spend your Halloween?
"Hallowed evening," the night before
All Saints Day, was the night to
honor the souls of the dead in Druid
days. Because all things supernatural
roamed the earth that night —
demons, witches, and goblins — it
was also the night to exorcise evil
spirits.
The spirit of Halloween has
changed quite a bit since then, but
many of our current fanciful activities
have their origins in such ominous
ceremonies. We still carve pumpkins,
wear costumes, go to dances, play a
game with apples and enact spirited
mischief.
Where can you find and practice
such rites this Halloween season? If
you're looking for some off-campus
fun, there's plenty to be found in the
area. The New Varsity on University
Avenue will host its annual costume
party on Wednesday, Halloween
night. Besides free popcorn, a fog
machine and general Halloween ac
tivities, the Varsity will be showing
that cult classic, "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show," along with "Phantom
of the Paradise." If you're hoping to
see some horrors and get a thrill out
of screaming at a scary motion
picture, but can do without a party,
the Bijou is showing "Night of the
Living Dead" and "Creepshow" on
Halloween.
Casa Maria, a Mexican Restaurant
on El Camino Real in Los Altos, will
hold a Halloween night costume
party from 8:00 until closing. Activ
ities will include bobbing for apples;
the house specialty is pumpkin mar
garitas.
Prizes will be awarded for best
costumes at most of these events,
which brings us to the crucial ques
tion that everyone seems to agonize
over on Halloween afternoon: What
will you wear? Where will you get
your costume, or how will you create
your own?

Masks, accessories and ghoulish
supplies can he found at drug stores,
beauty supply stores, and novelty
shops in Palo Alto. Character
Costumes on Cambridge Avenue also
rents costumes at prices ranging from
$20-$45. According to the manager
of Character Costumes, there is no
new trend in disguises this year,
though Boy George and gremlins ap
pear to be particularly popular with
the high-school set. Darth Vader will
make the rounds again; Character
Costume's version rents for $70.
You're likely to see much of the usual
fare this year — devils, gangsters, and
pregnant nuns. Character Costumes
recommends starting early on
costume hunting. Many of us know
from experience what it's like trying
to get a costume together in a
jammed store the day of the party.
Of course, Halloween is on a
weeknight. Does that mean you'll
have to miss all the fun if you stay
home and study Wednesday night?
No, of course not. A drive down to
Santa Cruz isn't too far for a weekend
night out, and the Santa Cruz Beach
Boardwalk amusement park will be
the scene for a costume ball Sunday,
, Oct. 28 at 7:30 p.m. The annual sell
out dance, sponsored by Santa Cruz's
"Good Times" publications, features
the Elvin Bishop Band. Tickets are
available through BASS, $8 in ad
vance or $9.50 at the door.
Also down south is Marriott's
Great America amusement park in
