# The 						practicalities of pumpkin patches, pies
## 
### MARK KING CATHY JANUS 
What would Halloween be without
pumpkins? The jack-o'-lantern
carved from a pumpkin is an Ameri
can variation on a Scotch-Irish theme
in which turnips, and not bright or
ange pumpkins, were used.
The search for that perfect
pumpkin will take you to Cocco's
Pumpkins on Willow Road, near the
entrance to Stanford Hospital. In a
rustic pumpkin patch, Cocco's has
dozens of beautiful orange pumpkins
to choose from. Prices range from $1
for the smallest to $10 for the largest
of these Pescadero-grown pumpkins.
(You might also enjoy a look at the
two baby pigs — and a pony, if it has
been recaptured — in the pumpkin
patch.) Cocco's also has sugar-pie

pumpkins and squash for baking.
Kevin's Pumpkins at the Town and
Country Shopping Center sells white
pumpkins, a kind of squash, for
cooking, as well as the regular
"jacks" for carving. Prices at Kevin's
pumpkin patch are competitive; both
Cocco's and Kevin's offer group dis
counts.
Once you've carved your pumpkin,
you might start thinking about what
to do with the sticky insides. You'll
probably opt to throw the mess away:
Even the most ambitious of us usually
don't make pumpkin pies completely
from scratch. In fact, why bother even
to cook a pie when so many bakeries
will do all the work for you?

Whether you want only a single
slice or a number of pies for a dorm
study-break or party this Halloween,
there are countless bakeries and
stores selling pumpkin pies, cookies
and other Halloween treats. Beware,
however, of assuming you can just
walk into a store and make your pur
chase. It's best to call ahead and place
an order to ensure getting what you
want.
Marie Callender's (941-6989) is
located at 4710 El Camino Real. The
pie store/coffee shop offers a wide se
lection of pies, including pumpkin for
$4.95. If you're comparing prices,
Marie Callender's homemade pies
are very reasonable and tasty.
If vou prefer sheet cakes or cookies

decorated in Halloween motifs, the
Pink Pastry Shop at 785 Santa Cruz
Ave. is your best bet. Cookies cost
between 35 and 65 cents each and are
made on the premises. The Pink
Pastry Shop also sells Napoleons and
other fine pastries, many decorated
for Halloween, for $1.00 to $1.50
each. Judging by the crowd, the Pink
Pastry Shop is a popular Menlo Park
bakery and it's very close to campus.
To place orders call 326-6282.
McGavin's Bakery (324-4167) at
the Stanford Shopping Center also
sells Halloween cookies and cakes.
Though McGavin's is the closest
bakery to campus, the prices there
are a little higher than you might
want to pay.

If you're looking for the pie that
takes the cake, try the Prolific Oven.
The pumpkin pie there is rich with
spices and topped with whipped
cream rosettes. Its smooth, creamy
texture melts in your mouth. Unfor
tunately, the pie costs $8.75, which
seems a little high if you're planning a
larger party and need more than one
pie.
The Prolific Oven also sells coffee
and other beverages as well as an as
sortment of cakes, pastries, cookies
and breads. The remodeled interior is
very cozy, and you might decide to
eat something right there when you
go to pick up your order. The choco
late Amaretto cream was especially

tempting. The Prolific Oven is off
University Avenue at 550 Waverley
St. Call 326-8485 to place an order.
If you want to serve something
unique and creative, you might try
Bud's. For the first time. Bud's Ice
Cream at 3590 Alameda De Las
Pulgas is experimenting with a
pumpkin ice cream cake. Bud's will
prepare treats to order, so call ahead
at 854-5335. Bud's even appeals to
students with a tight budget. If you
come in wearing your costume Hallo
ween night, Bud's will give you a free
small ice cream cone.

walk into a store and make your pur
chase. It's best to call ahead and place
an order to ensure getting what you
want.
Marie Callender's (941-6989) is
located at 4710 El Camino Real. The
pie store/coffee shop offers a wide se
lection of pies, including pumpkin for
$4.95. If you're comparing prices,
Marie Callender's homemade pies
are very reasonable and tasty.
If vou prefer sheet cakes or cookies

decorated in Halloween motifs, the
Pink Pastry Shop at 785 Santa Cruz
Ave. is your best bet. Cookies cost
between 35 and 65 cents each and are
made on the premises. The Pink
Pastry Shop also sells Napoleons and
other fine pastries, many decorated
for Halloween, for $1.00 to $1.50
each. Judging by the crowd, the Pink
Pastry Shop is a popular Menlo Park
bakery and it's very close to campus.
To place orders call 326-6282.
McGavin's Bakery (324-4167) at
the Stanford Shopping Center also
sells Halloween cookies and cakes.
Though McGavin's is the closest
bakery to campus, the prices there
are a little higher than you might
want to pay.

If you're looking for the pie that
takes the cake, try the Prolific Oven.
The pumpkin pie there is rich with
spices and topped with whipped
cream rosettes. Its smooth, creamy
texture melts in your mouth. Unfor
tunately, the pie costs $8.75, which
seems a little high if you're planning a
larger party and need more than one
pie.
The Prolific Oven also sells coffee
and other beverages as well as an as
sortment of cakes, pastries, cookies
and breads. The remodeled interior is
very cozy, and you might decide to
eat something right there when you
go to pick up your order. The choco
late Amaretto cream was especially

tempting. The Prolific Oven is off
University Avenue at 550 Waverley
St. Call 326-8485 to place an order.
If you want to serve something
unique and creative, you might try
Bud's. For the first time. Bud's Ice
