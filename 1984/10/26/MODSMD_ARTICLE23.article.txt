# Halloween in the City
## 
### MARK KING 
If you want to be wild and wicked
this Halloween, or just want to watch
other outrageously garbed, unin
hibited individuals, join the fes
tivities and celebrations going on in
San Francisco. No matter what your
inclination this Halloween, you'll find
something fun to do or watch if you
go to the City.
For a start is the adventuresome,
unique and much-ballyhooed Exotic
Erotic Ball. This event takes place
Saturday from 8 p.m. until 2:00 a.m.
at Pier 45 on Fisherman 's Wharf.
The party promises exotic acts, erotic
dancers and non-stop dancing to
rock'n'roll music.
Of course, your costume might
take a little more ingenuity for the oc
casion — or should that be less inge

nuity? Tickets ($12.50 in advance,
$15 day of show) are available
through BASS.
On Halloween night, one of the
first places you might want to stop at
in the City is the I-Beam. The I-Beam
will have a Halloween night costume
ball which they're calling '"Dressed to
Kill." Admission is regularly $6, but
since Halloween falls on Wednesday,
or "student night," students will be
admitted free with valid I.D. The I-
Beam, located at 1748 Haight St., is
filled with an odd assortment of
people even on regular evenings so
Halloween promises to be a spectacu
lar event. You'll be in the famed
Haight-Ashbury district, whose new
wave cafes and gelato shops are open
until late in the evening.

While you're in San Francisco, you
might want to check out the Kabuki
Nightclub's second-annual
"Halloween Dance Dance." Dance
Dance begins at 9 p.m. on Oct. 31;
tickets are $7 in advance and $10 at
the door.
Or if you're in the mood for
fabulous '50s music, you might drop
by Fisherman's Wharf Halloween
night. Earthquake McGoon's on Pier
39 is having a costume party with a
punk/'sos theme; music is by the
"Hollywood Spectaculars." The party
begins at 8 p.m., and there's no cover
charge.
