## Card to play Avezzano's 'best team' 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Sixth-year coach Joe Avezzano
says he now has, without a doubt, his
best football team ever.
That might mean something if
Avezzano were coaching at Ohio
State University or the University of
Nebraska or even Stanford. He's not,
though. Avezzano coaches at Oregon
State University, where saying you've
got your best football team "in quite
a while" isn't saying a whole lot.
In the past few years, Oregon
State, Stanford's opponent tomorrow
at 1 p.m. at Parker Stadium in Cor
vallis, Ore., has fielded bad football
teams. The Beavers are 6-43-2 under
Avezzano, 22-115-3 since 1972, and
have won just two of their last 37
Pacific 10 Conference games.
One of those conference victories
came last Oct. 29 and, as far as the
Oregon State students were con
cerned, it was long overdue. That was
when the Beavers won their first Pac
-10 game in nearly four years by
beating Stanford, 31-18, and all hell
broke loose on the Oregon State
campus.
"I think the loss last year at Oregon
State was the worst loss I've had
here," fifth-year senior offensive
guard Matt Moran said. "To see them
tearing down the goalpost and all

made it worse."
Since then, however, both teams
have improved. Stanford finished last
season with a 1-10 record and in last
place in the Pac-10. Oregon State
wasn't much better, finishing 2-8-1
and ninth.
Stanford is 3-4 overall and 1-3 in
the Pac-10 this year, while Oregon
State, 2-5 and 1-3, has a chance at its'
first three-victory season since 1978.
"Overall, we're a bigger, stronger
football team that can line up with
other teams in this conference and go
toe-to-toe with people," Avezzano
said of the 1984 Beavers. "We're in>
proved. We've closed the gap on an
awful lot of people.
"We're not a great football team by
any means, but we are the best team
we've had at Oregon State in quite a
while."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway cer
tainly isn't taking the Beavers lightly,
especially after what happened last
season.
The Beavers "are a much better
football team than you've been
familiar with in the past," Elway said.
"They're a very good defensive foot
ball team."
Although the Beavers give up an
average of 24.9 points and 338.3

yards per game, they have been tough
at home. Oregon State is allowing its
opponents just 13 points per game
this season in 40,593-seat Parker
Stadium, where it is 2-1 in 19K4.
"Their down linemen are very
physical and strong," Elway said of
Oregon State's defense, which hasn't
allowed a rushing touchdown in its
past three games. '"Their defensive
backs are good, and their linebackers
are also good."
Offensively, the Beavers are a little
less solid and a little more suspect.
There's talent at the skill positions,
but the offensive line, with only one
senior starter, lacks experience.
"On offense, we have not been
productive," Avezzano said, "and the
reason, we think, is that our offensive
line is not playing as well as we think
it could."
When the Beaver offense has been
productive, it's been running backs
Donald Beavers and Darvin Malone
and wide receivers Reggie Bvnum

and Claude Dixon who have
produced.
Beavers, third in the Pac-10 in all
purpose yards, and Malone are
averaging a combined 81.9 rushing
yards per game. Bynum, from San
Jose's Independence High School, is
first in the Pac-10 and 11 th in the na
tion with 34 receptions for 447 yards.
Dixon has 25 catches for 318 yards.
The same quarterback, however,
has not been throwing those passes to
Bynum and Dixon. Junior Ricky
Greene began the season as the
starter, but completed fewer than 50
percent of his passes and threw seven
interceptions. Another junior, Steve
Steenwyk, will start at quarterback
tomorrow, Avezzano said.
Tomorrow's game is important for
the Cardinal, if only in setting the
tone for the rest of this season. "The
coaches told us that we'll separate the
men from the boys this week," Moran
said, "and see who wants to come out
and make things happen and who
wants to accept things as they are."
Card notes
Tomorrow's game is one of the few
that will not be televised live in the
Bay Area. Only KSFO (560 AM) will
broadcast the game live on radio.
