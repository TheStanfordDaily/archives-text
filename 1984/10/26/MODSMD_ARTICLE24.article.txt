## Card to play Avezzano's 'best team' 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Sixth-year coach Joe Avezzano
says he now has, without a doubt, his
best football team ever.
That might mean something if
Avezzano were coaching at Ohio
State University or the University of
Nebraska or even Stanford. He's not,
though. Avezzano coaches at Oregon
State University, where saying you've
got your best football team "in quite
a while" isn't saying a whole lot.
In the past few years, Oregon
State, Stanford's opponent tomorrow
at 1 p.m. at Parker Stadium in Cor
vallis, Ore., has fielded bad football
teams. The Beavers are 6-43-2 under
Avezzano, 22-115-3 since 1972, and
have won just two of their last 37
Pacific 10 Conference games.
One of those conference victories
came last Oct. 29 and, as far as the
Oregon State students were con
cerned, it was long overdue. That was
when the Beavers won their first Pac
-10 game in nearly four years by
beating Stanford, 31-18, and all hell
broke loose on the Oregon State
campus.
"I think the loss last year at Oregon
State was the worst loss I've had
here," fifth-year senior offensive
guard Matt Moran said. "To see them
tearing down the goalpost and all

made it worse."
Since then, however, both teams
have improved. Stanford finished last
season with a 1-10 record and in last
place in the Pac-10. Oregon State
wasn't much better, finishing 2-8-1
and ninth.
Stanford is 3-4 overall and 1-3 in
the Pac-10 this year, while Oregon
State, 2-5 and 1-3, has a chance at its'
first three-victory season since 1978.
"Overall, we're a bigger, stronger
football team that can line up with
other teams in this conference and go
toe-to-toe with people," Avezzano
said of the 1984 Beavers. "We're in>
proved. We've closed the gap on an
awful lot of people.
"We're not a great football team by
any means, but we are the best team
we've had at Oregon State in quite a
while."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway cer
tainly isn't taking the Beavers lightly,
especially after what happened last
season.
The Beavers "are a much better
football team than you've been
familiar with in the past," Elway said.
"They're a very good defensive foot
ball team."
Although the Beavers give up an
average of 24.9 points and 338.3


Stanford running back Brad Muster recovers one of two Cardinal
fumbles against Washington State University Saturday. Mistakes could

sity, which is 2-1 in home games this season.
