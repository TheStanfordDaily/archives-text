# Field hockey team to host Spartans

### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford field hockey team's
final home game tomorrow against
: San Jose State University might be its
most important game this season.
The Cardinal, 9-5 overall and
ranked 15th in the country, is hoping
to be one of 12 teams to receive a bid
for the National Collegiate Athletic

Association tournament, which
begins Nov. 12.
Stanford might help its cause by
beating San Jose State, a team that
has beaten the Cardinal twice this
season, in a game beginning at 11

a.m.
The Spartans defeated the Car
dinal, 10-3, Sept. 22. That was one of
Stanford's two Northern Pacific Con
ference losses in six games. San Jose
State, 4-0-1 in the NorPac, beat the
Cardinal last Friday, 3-1, at the Cal
Invitational in Berkeley.
"We're going to be doing a few
things differently," Stanford Coach

Onnie Killefer said yesterday."The
midfield will be allowed more move
ment to create an attack. Some will
be involved in the attack and some
will be sharing defensive responsibili
ties."
