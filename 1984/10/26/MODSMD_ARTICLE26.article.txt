Perhaps suffering from
fatigue, the Stanford women's
soccer team lost, 1-0, to host
St. Mary's College yesterday.
"I think we played flat be
cause we played in Florida,"
Cardinal Coach Helen
Keohane said. "It's hard to get
up game after game."
Stanford, 5-6, finished third
in the University of Central
Florida Tournament at Or
lando, Fla. last weekend and
defeated Texas A & M, 1-0, on
Sunday after the tournament.
St. Mary's scored its goal 18
minutes into the second half.
"We were forced to play
their game," Keohane said.
"We couldn't settle the ball and
play the way we're capable of.
.. . I think St. Mary's was a lot
more up for it than we were."
The Cardinal will host the
University of Santa Clara to
morrow at 11 a.m., and
Keohane said her team will
"definitely" be more ready for
that game than it was yester
day.
"We played a scrimmage
with Santa Clara early in the
year after about four days of
practice (in early September),"
Keohane said. "We lost, 2-0,
and we've improved a lot since
then. Of course, I'm sure
they've improved too."
Santa Clara is coached by
Phil Wright, who was the first
women's soccer coach at Stan
ford.
"They're a good team,"
Keohane said of the Bruins.
"Their sweeper is good, and
they've got a pretty good for
ward — Jennifer Fechner —
and their goalie used to play on
Washington's (18 years of age
and under) select team."
