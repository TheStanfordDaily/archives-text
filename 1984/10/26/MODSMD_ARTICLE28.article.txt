### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team will play its final home confer
ence matches tonight and tomorrow
night against Cal State Fullerton and
USC. The Cardinal is ranked No. 1 in
the country by this week's Tachikara
Coaches and NCAA polls for the first
time in history.
Stanford also leads the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association with
a 6-1 record. Cal State Fullerton is in
last place in the WCAA. The Titans
have lost all their conference matches
this year and have gone 0-22 in con
ference play over the past two
seasons. USC is ranked second in the
nation and is fourth in the WCAA at
5-2 behind UCLA, 6-2, and San
Diego State, 7-2.
The Cal State Fullerton match will
be one of "redemption," according to
Cardinal Head Coach Fred Sturm.
Stanford defeated the Titans in its
first league match this season Sept.

Stanford's Kim Oden spikes against the China Zhe Xiang club team Tuesday night. The Cardinal will play its
first conference game as the nation's No. 1-ranked team tonight at 7:30 against Cal State-Fullerton.
-21, but took four games to do it.
"Just because they're in last place
doesn't mean they're weak," Asst.
Coach Don Shaw said. "It was a
struggle to get out of there. We kind
of overlooked them."
"Redemption is good motivation."
Sturm said. "Our focus on this match
will be the same as always — to play
well and execute."
Hitter Joan McGhee leads the
Titans with 159 kills this season.
Jackie Bougie is another standout.
She directs the Titans 5-1 offense,
and according to Shaw, is "probably
their best player." Bougie has 94 kills

this season.
The USC-Stanford matchup is of
prime importance to both teams.
With a victory, the Cardinal could
give the Trojans their third confer
ence loss. "If we can put room be
tween them and us it would be nice,"
Shaw said.
On the other hand, USC could give
Stanford a second conference loss
and put the WCAA in a four-way
scramble with Stanford, UCLA, USC
and San Diego State University each
having two-loss records.
"This is a very important match for
us," Sturm said. "We basically have
three things to focus on — getting the
sideouts, staying organized at the net
and in the backcourt and sustaining
our best effort throughout the entire
match.
"USC is a very complete, organ

ized team," Shaw said. "The players
are experienced."
Leading the Trojans in experience
is setter Kim Ruddins. A junior from
Los Angeles, Ruddins is returning
after taking a year off to compete as
the backup setter to Debbie Green on
the 1984 U.S. Olympic volleyball
team.
Tracy Clark, averaging 13.2 kills
per match, is the Trojans' greatest
threat from the outside hitting posi
tion. Freshman hitter Yvonna Lewis
has USC's best hitting percentage of
.306. In comparison, Stanford's Kim
Oden leads the league in hitting
percentage at .451.
Going against Oden will be 6-foot
-2 middle blocker Leslie Devereaux.
According to Shaw, Devereaux, like
most of the Trojans, is an excellent
and "physically impressive" athlete.
