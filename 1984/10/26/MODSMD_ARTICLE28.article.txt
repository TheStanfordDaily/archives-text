The Stanford women's volleyball
team will play its final home confer
ence matches tonight and tomorrow
night against Cal State Fullerton and
USC. The Cardinal is ranked No. 1 in
the country by this week's Tachikara
Coaches and NCAA polls for the first
time in history.
Stanford also leads the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association with
a 6-1 record. Cal State Fullerton is in
last place in the WCAA. The Titans
have lost all their conference matches
this year and have gone 0-22 in con
ference play over the past two
seasons. USC is ranked second in the
nation and is fourth in the WCAA at
5-2 behind UCLA, 6-2, and San
Diego State, 7-2.
The Cal State Fullerton match will
be one of "redemption," according to
Cardinal Head Coach Fred Sturm.
Stanford defeated the Titans in its
first league match this season Sept.
