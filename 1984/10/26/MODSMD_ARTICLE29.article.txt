### DARREN WOODRUFF Staff sportswriter 
After a two-week vacation from
competition, the men's and
women's cross country teams
return to action this weekend and
Monday in their conference cham
pionships.
The second-ranked Cardinal
women will be running tomorrow
in the Western Collegiate Athletic
Association championships in
Long Beach. The Stanford men
will he running in the Pacific 10
Conference championships Mon
day at the Stanford Golf Course.
Coach Brooks Johnson said "as
a team, the women are performing
up to their potential." One of the
individuals who is performing up
to her potential is senior Regina
Jacobs, who won the WCAA indi
vidual championship last season.
"Regina has done a lot of hard
work. Now she is bearing the fruit
of her effort," Johnson said.
Jacobs has been a consistent per
former for the Cardinal, leading
her teammates to victories in their
three races this season â€” the
Fresno, Stanford and Cal/Nike In
vitationals.
Jacobs, an Al I-American,
wouldn't predict a first-place
finish for herself in the champion
ships, but she predicted victory for
the team. "1 think Stanford's going
to win," she said. Asked about her

physical condition, she said, "I feel
pretty good."
Junior Alison Wiley, another
Ail-American, has also run well for
Stanford. She finished third at
Fresno, second at the Stanford In
vitational and second at the
Cal/Nike meet.
The Cardinal will be trying for
its third straight conference title
against primary challenge.s
UCLA, Arizona State University
and five other teams. Last year,
Stanford beat second-place
UCLA by 26 points.
Coming off a victory in the
Cal/Nike Invitational Oct. 13, the
Cardinal men will be led by Marc
Oleson, a sophomore.
"Marc has done surprisingly
well given his condition," Johnson
said. "He's competed his butt off."
The Stanford men hope to bet
ter their fourth-place finish behind
the University of Arizona, the
University of Oregon and UCLA
in the Pac-10 championships last
year. Their main challenge is ex
pected to come from Oregon and
Arizona, which returns two of its
runners who finished in the top 10
last season.
Last year, Oleson finished
eighth, 39 seconds out of first
place and 17 seconds out of
second. Stanford's Charles Alex
ander was 20th in the 1983 cham
pionships.
