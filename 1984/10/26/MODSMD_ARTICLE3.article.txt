# Senate hears housing report
## Reagan library site to be announced 
### JEANNE COOPER Senior staff writer 
The Ronald Reagan Library Plan
ning Committee should recommend
three possible sites for the library
within a week, according to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
Addressing the Faculty Senate
meeting yesterday, Kennedy said
none of the locations will be on the
campus side of Junipero Serra
Boulevard. After Kennedy reviews
the recommendations, he will send
them to the University Committee on
Land and Building Development and
to the board of trustees for approval.
The committee began with a list of
20 possible spots for the library, in
cluding a site near Interstate 280 and
Page Mill Road and another near the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences behind Lake
Lagunita.
Noting that the committee has met
11 times since it was formed in March
1984, Kennedy said several commit
tee members have also visited the li
braries of Lyndon Johnson in Austin,
Texas and Gerald Ford in Ann Ar
bor, Mich., to speak with their plan
ners and faculty users.
"Looking first-hand at the interac
tion of scholarship in the library, their
impressions of the value, vigor and
liveliness of such an institution was
substantially more positive than what
the committee received from this fac
ulty," Kennedy said. "They were im
pressed with the quality of interaction
and the value these facilities repre
sent to the universities at which
they're located."
C-US residence report
Prof. Bruce Parker, chairman of
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US), presented the Fac
ulty Senate with his committee's
recommendations on undergraduate
housing. The recommendations did
not call, however, for any senate ac
tion; Parker will send Kennedy the
final version of the recommendations
next week.
Parker, a professor of radiology
and pediatrics, contrasted the recom
mendations of C-US with those made
by the 1981-83 Subcommittee on
Residential Education and Advising
(S-REA) in fall 1983. The question
of all-freshman housing marks the
major difference between the com
mittees' suggestions: the S-REA

report called for all freshmen to live
in freshman-only housing, while the
C-US study gives freshmen a choice.
The C-US recommendation reads,
"Freshmen should be housed either
in all-freshman houses or in four
class houses in large residential com
plexes so that there will be increased
opportunities for interaction between
freshmen, participation in house
based courses, and access to advisers,
especially pre-professional advisers."
Parker commented, "Nevertheless,
the importance of all-freshman
housing cannot be denied." Thus the
recommendation concludes,
"Enough all-freshman housing
should be available to accommodate
all incoming freshmen who prefer
that option."
The C-US also reversed an interim
recommendation that would prohibit
freshmen from living in "ethnic" or
"cultural" theme houses.
Although the new theme-house
proposal enlarges freshman housing
possibilities, it also limits freshman
participation in theme houses:
"Freshmen in cultural theme houses
should not be required to make the
same formal commitment to the edu
cational theme as is required of soph
omores, juniors and seniors."
Nevertheless, Parker urged a
"strengthening of themes, and a com
mitment to them by the people."
Remarking that the so-called
"ethnic" theme houses often have the
strongest educational programs,
Parker said the committee hopes to
"encourage increased participation
by members of the Academic Council
in residential education." The group
has asked Assoc. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Carolyn Lougee to help
think of ways to make the association
between houses and faculty members
more attractive.
The first C-US recommendation,
which calls for "physically attractive
student housing for all Stanford un
dergraduates," has "enormous finan
cial implications" but will have little
immediate effect, Kennedy said.
"Don't expect things to go terribly
quickly."
The rest of the recommendation
reads, "The University administra
tion and the board of trustees should
be encouraged to make undergradu
ate housing and construction and
renovation a major priority for the
immediate future. Enough desirable
housing should he available to en
courage and permit students to have
continuity of housing in three upper
class years."
Responding to questions from
various senate members, Parker
noted that the committee did not feel
it should make specific recommen
dations for building and renovation
projects and funding allocation, nor
could it address graduate housing
needs.
Several senate members supported
establishing a housing rate scale
based on the relative attractiveness of
residences, a policy some senate
members said could lead to greater
continuity of residents.
Kennedy argued, however, that
"there is not a uniform gradience of

housing" and that it could be
"difficult to reflect others'
preferences in differential rates. He
also noted that "a lot could be done
to level out [inadequacies] in en
hancements of older buildings.
Norm Robinson, dean of Residen
tial Education, also said his ottice did
not want to create "economic zones

Steering Committee ( hairman
John Merryman said his group has
had a "preliminary discussion - ' of
Communication Prof. Elie Abel's re
quest for outside press access to sen

with the Steering Committee to speak
formally on changing the current
policy, which permits only campus
media representatives to attend
meetings. Merryman said the issue
"eventually, of course, will be
brought to the senate."

Several senate members supported

Kennedy argued, however, that

The Ronald Reagan Library Plan
ning Committee should recommend
three possible sites for the library
within a week, according to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
Addressing the Faculty Senate
meeting yesterday, Kennedy said
none of the locations will be on the
campus side of Junipero Serra
Boulevard. After Kennedy reviews
the recommendations, he will send
them to the University Committee on
Land and Building Development and
to the board of trustees for approval.
The committee began with a list of
20 possible spots for the library, in
cluding a site near Interstate 280 and
Page Mill Road and another near the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences behind Lake
Lagunita.
Noting that the committee has met
11 times since it was formed in March
1984, Kennedy said several commit
tee members have also visited the li
braries of Lyndon Johnson in Austin,
Texas and Gerald Ford in Ann Ar
bor, Mich., to speak with their plan
ners and faculty users.
"Looking first-hand at the interac
tion of scholarship in the library, their
impressions of the value, vigor and
liveliness of such an institution was
substantially more positive than what
the committee received from this fac
ulty," Kennedy said. "They were im
pressed with the quality of interaction
and the value these facilities repre
sent to the universities at which
they're located."
C-US residence report
Prof. Bruce Parker, chairman of
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US), presented the Fac
ulty Senate with his committee's
recommendations on undergraduate
housing. The recommendations did
not call, however, for any senate ac
tion; Parker will send Kennedy the
final version of the recommendations
next week.
Parker, a professor of radiology
and pediatrics, contrasted the recom
mendations of C-US with those made
by the 1981-83 Subcommittee on
Residential Education and Advising
(S-REA) in fall 1983. The question
of all-freshman housing marks the
major difference between the com
mittees' suggestions: the S-REA

report called for all freshmen to live
in freshman-only housing, while the
C-US study gives freshmen a choice.
The C-US recommendation reads,
"Freshmen should be housed either
in all-freshman houses or in four
class houses in large residential com
plexes so that there will be increased
opportunities for interaction between
freshmen, participation in house
based courses, and access to advisers,
especially pre-professional advisers."
Parker commented, "Nevertheless,
the importance of all-freshman
housing cannot be denied." Thus the
recommendation concludes,
"Enough all-freshman housing
should be available to accommodate
all incoming freshmen who prefer
that option."
The C-US also reversed an interim
recommendation that would prohibit
freshmen from living in "ethnic" or
"cultural" theme houses.
Although the new theme-house
proposal enlarges freshman housing
possibilities, it also limits freshman
participation in theme houses:
"Freshmen in cultural theme houses
should not be required to make the
same formal commitment to the edu
cational theme as is required of soph
omores, juniors and seniors."
Nevertheless, Parker urged a
"strengthening of themes, and a com
mitment to them by the people."
Remarking that the so-called
"ethnic" theme houses often have the
strongest educational programs,
Parker said the committee hopes to
"encourage increased participation
by members of the Academic Council
in residential education." The group
has asked Assoc. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Carolyn Lougee to help
think of ways to make the association
between houses and faculty members
more attractive.
The first C-US recommendation,
which calls for "physically attractive
student housing for all Stanford un
dergraduates," has "enormous finan
cial implications" but will have little
immediate effect, Kennedy said.
"Don't expect things to go terribly
quickly."
The rest of the recommendation
reads, "The University administra
tion and the board of trustees should
be encouraged to make undergradu
ate housing and construction and
renovation a major priority for the
immediate future. Enough desirable
housing should he available to en
courage and permit students to have
continuity of housing in three upper
class years."
Responding to questions from
various senate members, Parker
noted that the committee did not feel
it should make specific recommen
dations for building and renovation
projects and funding allocation, nor
could it address graduate housing
needs.
