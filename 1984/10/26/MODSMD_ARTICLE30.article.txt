## Card to play Long Beach 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
Following a week of difficult
workouts, the Stanford water polo
team will face Long Beach State in
DeGuerre Pool at 3 this afternoon.
According to Coach Dante Detta
manti, the Cardinal "is going to have
to win the game being a little tired."
Although the Cardinal defeated
the 49ers two weeks ago, 8-2, in the
Pacific Coast Athletic Associa
tion/Pacific 10 Tournament, Detta
manti does not feel Stanford should
take Long Beach State too lightly.
"This is a rebuilding year for Long
Beach and they are working with a lot
of new players, " Dettamanti said.
"They do have the potential to play
really well, and we are going to have
to go into the game seriously if we
want to win it."
The 49ers, 7-12 overall, are cur
rently ranked 11th in the nation,
while Stanford, 19-3, is ranked
second, behind the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley.
The Cardinal has been working
harder than usual this week in prepa
ration for the National Collegiate

Athletic Association championships,
which will be held Nov. 24-25 at
Long Beach. According to Detta
manti, the team is working on condi
tioning and staying in shape, as well
as focusing its practices on correcting
weaknesses.
"Normally we have to practice
lightly in order to rest up for the
match at the end of the week, hut this
week we have a fairly easy game so
we can work a lot harder," Detta
manti said. "We are working to
develop a solid conditioning base that
will carry us into the next few weeks,
probably the most difficult weeks of
the season."
The Cardinal will play top-ranked
Cal two times and fourth-ranked
USC once in the next four weeks
before competing in the NCAA
championships.
"Before we go on to the champion
ships, we need to work on several
problems in our offense," Dettamanti
said. "We need to work on finding
the free man coming off the fast
break and getting the ball to him un
der pressure. We also need to in
crease our goal production in the
front goal."
