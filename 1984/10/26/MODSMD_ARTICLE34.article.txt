# Protest continues
## 'Unfair' rent increases still trouble Escondido residents 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Residents of Escondido Village are continuing
the battle they launched last spring over what they
call excessive and unfair rent increases.
Last spring, village residents staged a protest
rally in White Plaza to express their anger over the
University's 10.85 percent across-the-board rent
increase on Escondido units.
Residents also charged at the spring protest that
approximately 26 percent of their rent was being
used to finance Governor's Corner, the recently
completed undergraduate housing project.
Now, some residents are upset that the $1 76,000
in Escondido utility costs saved by the University
last year has not resulted in lower rent increases in
the village.
According to John McManus, an Escondido resi

dent and doctoral student in communication, the
savings in utilities could have reduced this year's
rent increase by 3 percent, putting it at a 7.85 per
cent level. He said that a decrease would have
resulted in savings of hundreds of dollars to most
renters.
McManus said the University showed "almost a
criminal callousness" by not implementing a
decrease in rent for the coming year. While he said
there is nothing illegal in the University's actions,
he considers the move "unethical."
However. William Massy, vice president of busi
ness and finance, said the savings were used "to
replenish the operating reserve" of the University,
which was at "an uncomfortable level."
Massy called it "a little bit of good news" that
utility projections for last year were "a bit less than
we had thought."

According to Housing Management Director Ed
Scoles, an increase in the water reserves of Pacific
Gas & Electric last year led to the production of
more hydroelectric power at a lower rate than the
Universin had predicted.
And although the University saved $176,000 in
utility costs. Scoles said, it ran a $ 177,000 deficit in
maintenance charges.
Scoles said it is "risky business" to attempt to
translate estimated utility savings and losses into
lower or higher rent increases.
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of residential
education, added that Escondido Village "does not
stand on its own" in the University's overall
budget.
Certain savings at a particular building or
residence are often used to cover deficits in other
residences. Scoles said.
