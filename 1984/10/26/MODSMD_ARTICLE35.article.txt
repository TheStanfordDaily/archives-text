Red Dust (1932)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Clark Gable and Jean Harlow have a
classic argument about roquefort and
gorgonzola in this funny, sexy movie,
which John Mahin adapted from a Wil
son Collison play. Apparently the direc
tor, Victor Fleming, was a real live wire
on the set, and working with Gable and
Harlow, he must have had a raucous
good time — the movie crackles, at least
until Gable makes out for a while that he
prefers Mary Astor (in the deadbeat
third lead) to Harlow. Poor Astor pales
next to her rival, who looks fantastic and
kicks the hell out of lines like "Well, for
the love of mud! Where am I — on a
racetrack?" and "Guess I'm not used to
sleeping nights, anyway." (This picture
came out the year before the Hays Code
went into effect.) Gene Raymond,
Donald Crisp and Tully Marshall co
star; Harold Rosson supervised the
shiny cinematography.
Plays through Wednesday with "San
Francisco."
San Francisco (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
If you can stand to hear Jeanette Mac-
Donald singing the title song in her stale
whipped-cream style, then you can
probably make it through the boring ap
pendages of the plot and enjoy the spec
tacle of the earthquake scenes, which
take forever to get started. W.S. Van
Dyke directed; there was a rumor that
D.W. Griffith may have worked on the
action scenes, though they aren't that
good. Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy
star.
Plays through Wednesday with "Red
Dust."
Rebecca (1940)
Kresge Auditorium
The Academy Award for Best Picture
went to this enthralling high-style Got
hic, which was Alfred Hitchcock's first
American movie. The story — about a
bride who returns to her husband's
manor to find that the spirit of his first
wife hovers over everything — is out of
Daphne Du Maurier, adapted by Robert
E. Sherwood and Joan Harrison.
Laurence Olivier plays the haunted
widower, Maxim de Winter; he throws
too many soulful glances, and his perfor
mance doesn't make a great deal of
sense, but he's marvelous to watch
anyway. Joan Fontaine is surprisingly
good as his put-upon second wife. The
vibrant supporting cast includes George
Sanders, Gladys Cooper, Reginald
Denny, Nigel Bruce, Florence Bates, C.
Aubrey Smith, Melville Cooper, Leo G.
Carroll, and Judith Anderson in a classi
cally preposterous, scene-stealing turn
as creepy Mrs. Danvers, de Winter's
housekeeper.
Plays tonight at 9.
•
Suspicion (1941)
Terman Auditorium
Francis lies' novel "Before the Fact"
concerned a young woman who marries
a murderer, discovers his secret, but
loves him too much to give him up.
Alfred Hitchcock and his writers

(Samson Raphaelson, Joan Harrison
and Alma Reville) had something like
this in mind for the film version, but
RKO, appalled at the thought of casting
the leading man, Cary Grant, as a killer,
insisted on a revised ending. The result is
a mess, though a fascinating one, be
cause for much of the movie Grant really
seems to be playing the original concep
tion of his character. (One of the pro
ducers at RKO realized this, too, and
tried to solve the problem by editing, but
when the cut turned out to be only 55
minutes long, Hitchcock took over and
restored the deleted footage.) Joan Fon
taine, playing the dopey wife, received
an Oscar, probably as compensation for
the one she hadn't won the previous year
for "Rebecca"; her acting in
"Suspicion," ironically, seems to be
made up of recycled bits from
"Rebecca." With Cedric Hardwicke,
Nigel Bruce, May Whitty, Isabel Jeans,
Heather Angel and Leo G. Carroll.
Cleverest device: To focus on the glass
of milk Grant takes to his bride, which
may or may not be poisoned, Hitchcock
installed a light inside the glass.
Plays Wednesday evening at 7:30.
Poltergeist (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
A beautiful blond child named Carole
Ann (Heather O'Rourke) is kidnaped
by ghosts who also terrify her parents
(Joßeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson)
and her brother Robbie (Oliver Robins).
Steven Spielberg's suburban haunted
house picture, credited to Tobe Hooper,
is terribly efficient — it gets to you —
but not much fun. You may feel
barraged by all the close-ups and the
Dolby sound; this film is so loud and so
relentless throughout that it doesn't
have anywhere to go but straight to its
rather ludicrous big finish. It has its
bright spots, though: one truly magical
sequence (Robbie is abducted by a tree
that crashes through his bedroom win
dow), and good performances by Joßeth
Williams and, as a spiritualist, Zelda
Rubinstein.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)
Terman Auditorium
Michael Rennie as a peace-seeking
extra-terrestrial who meets with the hos
tility of earthlings in the movie that
began the craze for science fiction during
the Cold War years. Sci-fi freaks can
recite by heart the coded message
Rennie brings from his planet. Robert
Wise directed this entertaining junk,
from a script by Edmund H. North, and
the music is recognizably by Bernard
Herrmann. With Patricia Neal, Hugh
Marlowe, Sam Jaffe and Billy Gray
(later of "Father Knows Best").
Plays tomorrow evening at 7:30 and
9:30.
The Phantom of the Paradise (1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6181
Brian De Palma made this wild,
hilarious spoof of horror movies and

rock singers with the kind of freedom he
enjoyed in his underground movie days.
The plot is basically modelled on "The
Phantom of the Opera," with Paul Wil
liams (who wrote the satirical songs, and
they're surprisingly, wickedly clever) as
the impresario, Jessica Harper as the
promising young singer, and William
Finley as the brilliant composer who is
turned into a monster and resides in the
upper reaches of the theater, where he
watches over the girl he adores. In this
case, the composer's work is a "pop can
tata" version of "Faust," and De Palma
(who wrote as well as directed) plays on
"Faust" almost as much as on "The
Phantom": On one level the composer
Winslow is Faust, the singer Phoenix is
Marguerite, and the impresario Swan is
Mephistopheles, and on another — an
ingenious extension — this Mephistoph
eles is also his own Faust. The movie —
a marvelous entertainment that deserves
the reputation "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show" has got — is replete with
visual and vocal references: There are
borrowings from"The Picture of Dorian
Gray,"- "Psycho," "The Godfather,"
"The Manchurian Candidate" and even
"Bye Bye Birdie." The unusually win
ning cast also includes Gerrit Graham as
a pop idol and, as three different rock
trios, Harold Oblong, Jeffrey Comanor
and Archie Hahn. Watch out for Jessica
Harper's audition number, "Special to
Me"; aside from "Pennies from
Heaven," it's the best (and toughest)
thing she's ever done.
Plays Wednesday with "The Rocky
Horror Picture Show."
M(1931)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
Peter Lorre was a distinguished Ger
man stage actor when he made this early
sound film for Fritz Lang. (The same

year, he starred in the original produc
tion of Odon von Horvath's "Tales from
the Vienna Woods.") He is so extraordi
nary here that one wants to cry out
against the injustices perpetrated against
him in Hollywood, where he was typed
as a horror movie creep. He manages to
make the child murderer hero of "M" si
multaneously sympathetic and repeller'.
(as Bruce Davison would do in .1 is
portrayal of the child molester in "Short
Eyes" 46 years later). "M," a classic of
the German Expressionist school, is of
ten thought of as Lang's finest achieve
ment.
Plays Sunday with "Metropolis."
Metropolis (1926)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Utterly lunatic, and amazing. Fritz
Lang set this science-fiction fantasy in
the 21st century, where the working
class is compelled to live out its life un
derground in the service of the artis
tocracy. The direction and production
design are among the most extraordi
nary examples known of German Ex
pressionism; Karl Freund and Gunther
Rittau shot the picture. Watching Lang's
film is an overwhelming experience, be
cause it is ridiculous, assaulting and bril
liant by turns, and because of the
discrepancy between its visual qualities
and the florid, Delsartean acting (by
Brigitte Helm, Gustav Frohlich. Alfred
Abel and others).
Plays Sunday with "M."

Romeo and Juliet 11968)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Franco Zeffirelli stages opera as
though it were film, but his movies are
barely competent: The camera moves
around so much (and so pointlessly) that
you get a headache trying to focus on the
action, and surely no major director has
ever done such an appalling job of
framing — he cuts his actors to ribbons.
In this scandalously popular botch of
Shakespeare's lyrical tragedy, the acting
is, with a few exceptions, so atrocious
that the framing seems to be a case of
the punishment fitting the crime. This
"Romeo and Juliet," in which Romeo
(Leonard Whiting) enters cradling a
flower and Mercutio (John McEnery)
might be on acid during the Queen Mab
speech, is more like an updated "West
Side Story" than Shakespeare — talk
about reduction! With Olivia Hussey as
Juliet, Milo O'Shea as Friar Laurence,
Michael York as Tybalt, Pat Heywood
as the Nurse.
Plays Monday with "The Taming of
the Shrew."
La Cage aux Folles (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script by Jean Poiret, Edouard
Molinaro, Francis Veber and Marcello
Danon is the cleverest variation yet on
the oft-tried comic theme of the parent
who pretends to be something he is not
for the good of his child. (Damon

Runyon may have been the first to use it,
in his story "Madam La Gimp.") Ugo
Tognazzi plays Renato, whose son has
just become engaged to the daughter of
a reactionary, highly placed government
official. The girl's parents naturally wish
to meet their intended in-law, but that
poses a delicate problem: Renato is an
avowed homosexual who lives with his
long-time lover, Albin, played by Michel
Serrault (who gives a magnificent comic
performance). The direction (by
Molinaro) is sloppy, and the stage
origins are uncomfortably clear in the
structure of some of the scenes, but
these flaws seem terribly unimportant
when Serrault is on screen. When he
walks, every movable part of his body
flutters through a series of carefully
prearranged poses; he gets more comic
mileage out of his clothing than almost
any other actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday with "Les
Comperes."
Les Comperes (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The new sensitive American father
has now migrated across the Atlantic.
Francis Veber made this sentimental
movie about a runaway teenager and the
two men who each think they're his fa
ther. The continual contrast between the
two men, a rugged, macho journalist
(Gerard Depardieu) and a soft-hearted,
liberal neurotic (Pierre Richard), is
wearying, and so is the repetiton re
quired by the set-up of the comedy.
(Everything in it occurs three times.)
And Pierre Richard can exhaust you all
by himself; he mugs so ferociously, and
he works so hard at being endearing,
that at times you may want to close your
eyes to get a rest from his antics.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday with "La
Cage aux Folles."
