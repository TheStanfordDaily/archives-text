# Professor emerita dies
## 
### 
Lois Meek Stolz, professor emerita
of psychology at Stanford and a
pioneer in studies of child develop
ment, died yesterday at her Palo Alto
home after a short illness. She was 93.
Her interest and work in develop
mental psychology, begun in the
1 920 sand developed during and after
World War 11, eventually led to what
Stanford Prof. Robert Sears de
scribed as "an entire program in child
psychology."
She became a faculty member here
in 1947, and her first class in child
psychology attracted 300 students.
She retired from teaching in 1957,
but until recently remained active in
her research and writing.
There will be no funeral.
