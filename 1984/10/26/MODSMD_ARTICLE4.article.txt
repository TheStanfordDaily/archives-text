# Labor strike grieves Yale
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Yale University students are currently experiencing
the same type of inconvenience faced by Stanford stu
dents during the University workers' strike here two
years ago.
A three week-long technical and clerical worker
strike at Yale has forced students to eat off campus and
face the dilemma of crossing the picket lines formed by
Local 34.
Another Yale workers' union. Local 35, which in
cludes dining hall workers, has decided that its mem
bers will not cross Local 34's picket lines. Local 35 has
been established for a number of years; Local 34 is in
its first year.
The striking union is asking for wage increases
amounting to 49.2 percent over the next three years,
job security, medical benefits and equal pay for its
female employees. The union says female employees
earn only 59 cents for every dollar male employees
earn.
Yale says the workers are well-paid by New Haven
standards. The university has countered the union s
demands with a package that would have given
workers a 24.2 percent raise over the next three years
but does not address many of the other issues the union
has raised.
How long the strike will last is uncertain, but both
sides seem determined to maintain their positions on
the issues.
In April, the two sides negotiated a partial contract
agreement. Included in that compromise were im
proved benefits for laid-otf employees, a new dental
plan and a new grievance procedure in which the union

is represented at each step and can appeal to arbitra
tion.
No progress has been made since that agreement.
John Wilhelm, business manager of non-striking
Local 35, has said that Local 34's strike is also impor
tant because it is laying the ground work for Local 35's
contract negotiations later this year.
Stanford union leaders were critical of Yale's posi
tion in the strike. Dennis Blake, chief steward for
Local 680, said Yale has an "arrogant, paternalistic at
titude toward the workers."
Blake said Yale's hard-bargaining stance in the
strike is also partially aimed at undermining Local 35's
position in the upcoming negotiations. "If they can
steal momentum from a new one (Local 34), they can
keep the other one down," Blake said.
Recently, the strength of the striking unit has been
questioned. Last week 41 percent of the Local 34
members reported to work, as compared to the 37 per
cent that worked the first week of the strike.
