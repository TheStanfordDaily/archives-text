# Labor strike grieves Yale
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Yale University students are currently experiencing
the same type of inconvenience faced by Stanford stu
dents during the University workers' strike here two
years ago.
A three week-long technical and clerical worker
strike at Yale has forced students to eat off campus and
face the dilemma of crossing the picket lines formed by
Local 34.
Another Yale workers' union. Local 35, which in
cludes dining hall workers, has decided that its mem
bers will not cross Local 34's picket lines. Local 35 has
been established for a number of years; Local 34 is in
its first year.
The striking union is asking for wage increases
amounting to 49.2 percent over the next three years,
job security, medical benefits and equal pay for its
female employees. The union says female employees
earn only 59 cents for every dollar male employees
earn.
Yale says the workers are well-paid by New Haven
standards. The university has countered the union s
demands with a package that would have given
workers a 24.2 percent raise over the next three years
but does not address many of the other issues the union
has raised.
How long the strike will last is uncertain, but both
sides seem determined to maintain their positions on
the issues.
In April, the two sides negotiated a partial contract
agreement. Included in that compromise were im
proved benefits for laid-otf employees, a new dental
plan and a new grievance procedure in which the union

is represented at each step and can appeal to arbitra
tion.
No progress has been made since that agreement.
John Wilhelm, business manager of non-striking
Local 35, has said that Local 34's strike is also impor
tant because it is laying the ground work for Local 35's
contract negotiations later this year.
Stanford union leaders were critical of Yale's posi
tion in the strike. Dennis Blake, chief steward for
Local 680, said Yale has an "arrogant, paternalistic at
titude toward the workers."
Blake said Yale's hard-bargaining stance in the
strike is also partially aimed at undermining Local 35's
position in the upcoming negotiations. "If they can
steal momentum from a new one (Local 34), they can
keep the other one down," Blake said.
Recently, the strength of the striking unit has been
questioned. Last week 41 percent of the Local 34
members reported to work, as compared to the 37 per
cent that worked the first week of the strike.

The union at this point is "riding on
the solidarity" between the two lo
cals. The more-established Local 35,
which survived a 13-week strike in
1977, reports that only 5 percent of
its members have been appearing for
work.
The union's problems do not end
there. Striking "is difficult for a uni
versity union because it can't inter
rupt sales," Blake said.
Because the union members cannot
close down a university, they must
rely on "public relations and the fair
ness of their demands," Blake added.
A. H. Raskin, a former labor corre

spondent for The New York Times
who is currently serving as an ASSU
guest professor, agreed with Blake.
Raskin said that in a university
strike the union's real hope is that the
students and faculty will come out in
favor of its position.
Yale sophomore Jim Shapiro said
the strike was "wimpy" because there
is no way for the union to interrupt
the educational process.
"They don't want you to cross any
more picket lines than you have to.
That's not the way Jimmy Hoffa did
it," Shapiro said.
Blake said the Yale and Stanford
unions and the universities them
selves are similar enough that the
Stanford-based union would be
watching to see what gains the Yale
strikers make.
Raskin said the Yale strike's im

pact here is "an open question."
When Stanford campaigns against
Local 680 in an Oct. 30 election here,
Raskin said. University officials could
point to the Yale strike and say,
" 'Look at the people at Yale. These
people (Local 680) will have you on
strike too.' "
While the strike's impact on Stan
lord is questionable, it is having a
noticable effect on the student body
at Yale. Library hours have been
reduced. Most undergraduate sec
tions and some lectures have been
moved off campus because of picket
lines throughout the campus.
Yale senior Jill Gofen said crossing
picket* lines to go to class was
"difficult because the people picket
ing are people you know."
"It's a moral dilemma," Gofen
said.

Because the food service workers
are on strike, students are given
572.80 a week to buy their own meals
off-campus. Shapiro said, " The im
pact is social."
Gofen, a freshman adviser, said
that eating off campus was especially
hard on freshmen and made it diffi
cult for her to meet with her treshman
advisees.
"It's really disorienting (to them)
not seeing the same people
anymore," Gofen added.
Shapiro said he thought the Yale
administrators should work harder at
resolving the strike. "Even if [they]
don't care about the workers having
enough to eat, fthey] owe it to the
Yale image to start doing some
thing," he said.

administrators should work harder at
resolving the strike. "Even if [they]
don't care about the workers having
enough to eat, fthey] owe it to the
Yale image to start doing some
thing," he said.
Yale University students are currently experiencing
the same type of inconvenience faced by Stanford stu
dents during the University workers' strike here two
years ago.
A three week-long technical and clerical worker
strike at Yale has forced students to eat off campus and
face the dilemma of crossing the picket lines formed by
Local 34.
Another Yale workers' union. Local 35, which in
cludes dining hall workers, has decided that its mem
bers will not cross Local 34's picket lines. Local 35 has
been established for a number of years; Local 34 is in
its first year.
The striking union is asking for wage increases
amounting to 49.2 percent over the next three years,
job security, medical benefits and equal pay for its
female employees. The union says female employees
earn only 59 cents for every dollar male employees
earn.
Yale says the workers are well-paid by New Haven
standards. The university has countered the union s
demands with a package that would have given
workers a 24.2 percent raise over the next three years
but does not address many of the other issues the union
has raised.
How long the strike will last is uncertain, but both
sides seem determined to maintain their positions on
the issues.
In April, the two sides negotiated a partial contract
agreement. Included in that compromise were im
proved benefits for laid-otf employees, a new dental
plan and a new grievance procedure in which the union

is represented at each step and can appeal to arbitra
tion.
No progress has been made since that agreement.
John Wilhelm, business manager of non-striking
Local 35, has said that Local 34's strike is also impor
tant because it is laying the ground work for Local 35's
contract negotiations later this year.
Stanford union leaders were critical of Yale's posi
tion in the strike. Dennis Blake, chief steward for
Local 680, said Yale has an "arrogant, paternalistic at
titude toward the workers."
Blake said Yale's hard-bargaining stance in the
strike is also partially aimed at undermining Local 35's
position in the upcoming negotiations. "If they can
steal momentum from a new one (Local 34), they can
keep the other one down," Blake said.
Recently, the strength of the striking unit has been
questioned. Last week 41 percent of the Local 34
members reported to work, as compared to the 37 per
cent that worked the first week of the strike.

The union at this point is "riding on
the solidarity" between the two lo
cals. The more-established Local 35,
which survived a 13-week strike in
1977, reports that only 5 percent of
its members have been appearing for
work.
The union's problems do not end
there. Striking "is difficult for a uni
versity union because it can't inter
rupt sales," Blake said.
Because the union members cannot
close down a university, they must
rely on "public relations and the fair
ness of their demands," Blake added.
A. H. Raskin, a former labor corre

spondent for The New York Times
who is currently serving as an ASSU
guest professor, agreed with Blake.
Raskin said that in a university
strike the union's real hope is that the
students and faculty will come out in
favor of its position.
Yale sophomore Jim Shapiro said
the strike was "wimpy" because there
is no way for the union to interrupt
the educational process.
"They don't want you to cross any
more picket lines than you have to.
That's not the way Jimmy Hoffa did
it," Shapiro said.
Blake said the Yale and Stanford
unions and the universities them
selves are similar enough that the
Stanford-based union would be
watching to see what gains the Yale
strikers make.
Raskin said the Yale strike's im

pact here is "an open question."
When Stanford campaigns against
Local 680 in an Oct. 30 election here,
Raskin said. University officials could
point to the Yale strike and say,
" 'Look at the people at Yale. These
people (Local 680) will have you on
strike too.' "
While the strike's impact on Stan
lord is questionable, it is having a
noticable effect on the student body
at Yale. Library hours have been
reduced. Most undergraduate sec
tions and some lectures have been
moved off campus because of picket
lines throughout the campus.
Yale senior Jill Gofen said crossing
picket* lines to go to class was
"difficult because the people picket
ing are people you know."
"It's a moral dilemma," Gofen
said.

Because the food service workers
are on strike, students are given
572.80 a week to buy their own meals
off-campus. Shapiro said, " The im
pact is social."
Gofen, a freshman adviser, said
that eating off campus was especially
hard on freshmen and made it diffi
cult for her to meet with her treshman
advisees.
"It's really disorienting (to them)
not seeing the same people
anymore," Gofen added.
Shapiro said he thought the Yale
administrators should work harder at
resolving the strike. "Even if [they]
don't care about the workers having
enough to eat, fthey] owe it to the
Yale image to start doing some
