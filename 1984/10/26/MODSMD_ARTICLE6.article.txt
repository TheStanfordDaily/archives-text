Embassy explosives spark uproar
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sought yesterday to
dampen a public outcry over a "test planting" of explosives in the garden
of the French Embassy residence by a French security man guarding
President Francois Mitterrand on his visit here.
The explosives were discovered by tracker dogs of the British police
anti-terrorist unit in a search of the embassy grounds just before Mitter
rand held a reception on Tuesday evening for members of the French
community in London. The French, however, are now contending that
the w hole affair was pre-arranged between French and British police of
ficers to test the efficiency of the British tracker dogs.
In the House of Commons, Mrs. Thatcher said that it was "a most
regrettable incident and a matter of serious concern that explosive ma
terials were brought into this country." She called it "excessive zeal on
the part of a junior French official" and said that "urgent discussions"
were under way with the French about the incident. She added,
however, that it should not be allowed to mar the Mitterrand visit.
A French Embassy statement, expressed in vague terms, said that as
part of cooperation between the French and British security services, the
British had been asked to "contribute to the security of the French Em
bassy residence. . . . During these operations, the customary working
equipment of a French bomb disposal expert was at the origin of a
regrettable misunderstanding."
In Paris, the Ministry of the Interior said more specifically that the ex
plosives had been planted in the garden "with the full knowledge of the
British" and that the incident was wrongly publicized because of lack of
coordination in the British police. Scotland Yard, however, stiffly and
unequivocally denied that the British had any prior knowledge of the
French operation.
Ferraro speaks in Silicon Valley
Democratic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro yesterday
continued to sweep up and down California in pursuit of the state's 47
Electoral College votes, professing to be undaunted by new evidence
that the Democrats' upset bid has stalled.
At an Apple Computer factory in Cupertino, Ferraro warned workers
that "Silicon Valley" faces the same competition as the nation's older
"smokestack" industries.
"Either Ronald Reagan doesn't understand the problem, or he thinks
it will simply go away," she said. "While we lose this battle to other
countries, he takes comfort in a modest recovery, fueled by $200 billion
deficits. While the tide is going out, he's watching the waves."
In Cleveland, Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale
launched a major new attack on Reagan, telling a crowd of several
thousand that Reagan sees dictators and repression as the eventual
outcome of government programs designed to help people.
"I see Social Security and Medicare as a commitment from one gener
ation to another," Mondale said. "Let us be a community, a family, care
for one another. . . . Let us end this selfishness, this greed, this new
championship of caring only for yourself."
Reagan camp vows advertising blitz
WASHINGTON — The Reagan-Bush Campaign Committee, saving
its biggest advertising blitz for last, vowed yesterday to "dominate" the
presidential campaign radio and television advertising in the final two
weeks of the race.
"We ain't taking nothin' for granted," Edward Rollins, Reagan-Bush
campaign director, declared at a news conference. "We will certainly
dominate the airwaves in the final weeks."
But Scott Widmayer, a spokesman for the Walter Mondale campaign,
retorted, "We will certainly match them with an aggressive advertising
campaign. . . . Sounds like an overstatement."
In the final two weeks, the Reagan-Bush campaign will spend at least
$10 million on advertising — 25 percent of the entire campaign budget
— most of it on television commercials. In addition, the Republican get
out-the-vote effort will make 14 million telephone calls to voters in 29
targeted states, accompanied by 15 million pieces of direct mail and the
mailing of absentee ballot applications to Republican voters in 12 states.
Rollins warned, "Only by an extensive get-out-the-vote effort can we
ensure that the president wins."
1984 deficit is second largest ever
WASHINGTON — The federal government ran up a $175.3 billion
budget deficit in fiscal year 1984, down from the all-time record set last
year but still the second-largest flood of red ink in U.S. history, the Trea
sury Department announced yesterday.
The deficit total for the fiscal year which ended on Sept. 30 was $ 1 bil
lion higher than the Reagan administration had predicted in August but
was down considerably from what both the administration and private
economists had feared at the beginning of the year.
The $175.3 billion deficit was 10 percent below the $195.3 billion
record set in 1983, the year that Ronald Reagan had pledged while cam
paigning in 1980 that he would balance the government's books.
Studies cite water pollution threat
WASHINGTON — Pollution poses a "significant" threat to under
ground streams that supply half the nation's drinking water, but govern
ment attention to the problem has been so haphazard that no one is cer
tain how severe or widespread the pollution is, two government studies
concluded yesterday.
One of the studies, an internal report by the Environmental Protec
tion Agency, contends that federal and state attempts to control
groundwater pollution have been all but stopped by bureaucratic red
tape, sloppy testing procedures and lax law enforcement. The draft
report, completed last May but never released, was made public by En
vironmental Safety, a Washington-based public-interest group.
Frances Zwenig, the group's executive director, called the study an in
dictment of the EPA's groundwater program. An EPA spokesman said,
however, that the agency's anti-pollution efforts have improved
markedly since the report was prepared.
The spokesman said that top EPA hazardous-waste officials did not
necessarily agree with the draft report's harsh conclusions.
The second study, by the non-partisan Congressional Office of Tech
nology Assessment, said that only a small part of the country's vast un
derground water reservoirs are known to be polluted but that the poten
tial effects of contamination warrant national concern.
Cosmonaut hails Soviet progress
MOSCOW — A cosmonaut who returned this month from a 238-day
mission in space said yesterday that the Soviet Union is "approaching
the stage" of putting space factories into orbit.
"Our mission was a step toward that goal," Vladimir Solovyov, a
member of the three-man crew that set the new longevity record, said at
a news conference.
"We are going to make our space missions longer and longer,"
Alexandrov added.
However, Soviet space officials also pointed out the physical problems
of lengthy stays in space.
O.G. Gazenko, an expert on space medicine, said cosmonauts could
remain in orbit for a year or more without damage to their health.
"From the purely theoretical point of view, we do not see any limits on
prolonged space flight," he said. "But this doesn't mean all difficulties
are solved. It's obvious that the longer time in orbit, the more problems
on returning to earth."
Moderate decline on stock market
NEW YORK — Stock prices slipped into a moderate decline yester
day as interest rates turned upward in the credit markets.
Computer and technology stocks suffered some of the session's most
notable losses.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 3.42 Wednesday,
dropped 5.41 to 1,211.02.
Today's weather
Increasingly cloudy today, with a chance of light showers in the late af
ternoon. Highs in the 60s to mid 70s.
