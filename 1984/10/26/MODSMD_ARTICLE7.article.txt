# U.S. plans Salvadoran maneuvers
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Defense
Department, after a period of relative
inactivity in Central America, plans
to conduct a series of military exer
cises in the region later this year and
early next year, including one maneu
ver that will send U.S. forces into El
Salvador, knowledgeable officials
said yesterday.
The Pentagon already has stepped
up its intelligence-gathering activities
in the region, officials said. U.S.
Army reconnaissance planes that
track Salvadoran rebels, it was
learned yesterday, send their infor
mation through Panama and the
United States to U.S. advisers in El
Salvador, where Salvadoran officials
"listen in" to the message traffic
without being given information di
rectly — thereby avoiding any viola
tions of the War Powers Act.
Several hundred U.S. troops are
scheduled to participate in early

December with Honduran and Sal
vadaran soldiers in a maneuver called
King's Guard along the Honduran-
Salvadoran border, officials said. The
plan calls for some of the activities to
take place in El Salvador, which
would be the first time U.S.
maneuvers in Honduras have spilled
into that neighboring country, they
said.
1 he Reagan administration has
played down military activities in
Central America during the election
campaign, scaling back its exercises
and neglecting to announce some of
the smaller maneuvers that do take
place. After the election, however.
Gen. Paul Gorman, head of the U.S.
Southern Command in Panama, and
other Pentagon leaders are expected
to push for a more active and visible
U.S. military role in the region.
The aim of that presence is to help

the Salvadoran government win its
civil war against leftist guerrillas and
to help CIA-backed contra rebels
pressure the Sandinista government
of Nicaragua, officials said. To ac
complish both missions, the adminis
tration is likely to resume its empha
sis on creating a military in
frastructure in Honduras, which lies
between El Salvador and Nicaragua,
they said.
Gorman has proposed that several
thousand troops participate in a
months-long exercise called Big Pine
3 beginning early next year, perhaps
in March. The Joint Chiefs ot Staff
have endorsed the plan, one ofticial
said.
In addition, a series of small-scale
exercises under the umbrella name
"Bigger Focus '84" will continue
through February, perhaps increasing
in size from the platoon-sized

maneuvers that have been taking
place this fall. The Pentagon has not
announced most of those small exer
cises, three of which are taking place
right now.
A Marine contingent that left its
radar and listening post in the
strategically located Gulf of Fonseca
last spring returned to Tiger Island
late in August, again without public
announcement. The Marines operate
electronic listening equipment but did
not reinstall their radar, officials said.
In addition, U.S. planes have in
creased their reconnaissance flighis
over El Salvador and other countries
in the region, officials said. The CIA
plane that crashed into a Salvadoran
mountain last week, killing four CIA
employees on board, was one indica
tion of that activity.
