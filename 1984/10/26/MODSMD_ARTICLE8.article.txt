# Iraq seeks renewed relations
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Iraq has informed the
United States that it is ready to re-establish full
diplomatic relations later this year after a 17-year
interruption, according to official sources.
Only a few years ago, Iraq was regarded as a
radical Soviet client in the Middle East, but the
United States has gradually drifted into a closer
alignment with it during the four-year Iraq-Iran
war.
The Iraqi decision was conveyed to Secretary of
State George Shultz by Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz at the United Nations early this month, the
sources said. Aziz reportedly expressed a willing
ness to come to Washington at an early date to ce
ment the resumed relationship and make a public

announcement, but was asked to put the visit off
until after the U.S. election because of the "tight
schedule" of President Reagan.
Three years ago, Iraq was on the list of countries
regarded as supporters of international terrorism
and thus barred from U.S. commercial transactions
that might aid it militarily. Since then, the Reagan
administration has moved step-by-step to improve
its relations with Baghdad, removing the country
from the terrorist list and sending a procession of
high-level visitors.
At the same time, the administration has taken
an increasingly active role to halt the direct or indi
rect flow of military supplies to Iran. All this led the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee to conclude

in a recent staff report that "United States policy
has tilted toward Iraq" since 1982.
Restoration of full U.S.-Iraqi relations is likely to
be controversial with Israel and its supporters here.
The Israeli government has long been leery of Iraq,
which has taken strong anti-Israeli positions in
recent years. In June 1981, Israel bombed and
destroyed Iraq's nuclear research reactor.
The move also may be received without enthusi
asm by those who believe Iran to be of far greater
strategic importance than its foe. U.S. diplomatic
ties with Iran, formal and informal, were broken off
during the hostage crisis and there is little prospect
for improvement.
