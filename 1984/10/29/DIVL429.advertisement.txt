GRADUATE SENATOR CANDIDATE
Ronald Pekar
Department of Electrical Engineering
Position Statement:
We, the graduate students, have little collective voice in promoting our interests. I would
devote my efforts toward the issues affecting us, including:
• financial support • housing and parking
• graduate input into departmental decisions • academic and social programs
• and interaction among the disciplines, with the undergraduates, and with the rest of the
campus community.
As an undergraduate, I was involved heavily in promoting student interests and providing *
students with the services they wanted. The graduates comprise over half the total enrollment
at Stanford, and I believe I would be effective in making our concerns heard, acknowledged,
and treated.
