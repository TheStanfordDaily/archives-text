"You'll never be bored at Advanced Micro Devices". That's what the authors of The 100
Best Companies to Work for in America* said. They ranked AMD right up there in the
top 15, with high points for benefits, job security, ambience and — perhaps most important
— the chance to move up.
AMD is the fifth largest and fastest growing major integrated circuit company in the U.S.
producing both Bipolar and MOS products.
Opportunities for graduating engineers are expanding at our Sunnyvale, California head
quarters and in Austin and San Antonio, Texas.
Your BS, MS or PhD in Electrical Engineering, Solid State Physics, Materials Science or
Computer Science could be the first step in your move up with AMD.
