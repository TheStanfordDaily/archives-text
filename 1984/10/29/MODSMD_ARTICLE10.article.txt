Two gunmen shot pope,
Italian judge asserts
ROME In a surprise announcement, an Italian judge
Friday accused a second Turkish gunman of shooting
Pope John Paul II at the same time the pontiff was shot by
Mehmet Ali Agca in St. Peter's Square on May 13, 1981.
The new development in the tangled plot to kill the
pope came with the long-awaited formal indictment
F riday of three Bulgarians and five Turks, including the
second gunman and the imprisoned Agca, on a series of
charges connected with the shooting.
Judge Ilario Martella, who headed a three-year investi
gation of the so-called Bulgarian Connection to the Papal
assassination attempt, said that the second gunman was
Oral Celik, previously identified hy Italian authorities as a
long-time Turkish friend and fellow conspirator of Agca
who once helped the would-be assassin escape from a
prison in Turkey.
Noting that witnesses at St. Peter's Square said that
they heard three shots when Agca fired at the pope, Mar
tella said, "The trajectory of the bullet shows that the
third one came from Celik. 1 '
He added that "from witnesses and documents and bal
listic reconstruction it is shown that the third shot came
from Celik, and that was the shot that hit the pope on his
left forefinger and left arm." He said that neither Celik's
pistol nor bullet were found.
Polish officers confess
WARSAW, Poland — Three officers of the Interior
Ministry, the government's police and security agency, ad
mitted the kidnaping of a pro-Solidarity priest, Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak announced Saturday.
But Kiszczak, Poland's top police official, said inves
tigators have been unable to learn the fate of Father Jerzy
Popieluszko.

Kiszczak, appearing on state radio and television, told
the nation that one suspect has confessed to killing
Popieluszko, while a second suspect claims the popular
37-year-old priest was released near the northern city of
Torun.
All three officers will be charged with kidnaping "and,
if this is justified by further investigation, with other of
fenses embodied in the penal code," the interior minister
said.
Kiszczak vowed that the kidnapers and "those who
shielded them" would be punished to the full extent of the
law. He also warned Poland's political opposition not to
use the tragedy to "push excited elements of the society
into acts that may lead to unpredictable consequences."
PAP, the official Polish news agency, reported that the
Warsaw district defense committee had convened during
the day to review the state of public order in the capital, a
clear signal that the authorities are prepared to deal firmly
with strikes or street demonstrations that may grow out of
the kidnaping.
Popieluszko, an ardent Solidarity supporter, was ab
ducted from his car in northern Poland on Oct. 19. The
Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, has called for all
Warsaw churches to celebrate an evening mass for the
missing cleric, and the government clearly anticipates that
street demonstrations may follow.
Baby gets baboon heart
LOMA LINDA, Calif. — Hospital officials said a dying
14-day-old girl was doing "remarkably well" Saturday
after doctors replaced her underdeveloped heart on
Friday with that of a baboon in a historic transplant oper
ation.
Sandra Nehlsen-Cannarella, an immunologist who was
a member of the operating team, called the case "one of
the biggest, overdue advances in our field."
Only four ape-to-human heart transplants have been

performed previously, all in adults. Only one recipient
survived more than a few hours, living for three-and-one
half days.
No human heart was available for "Baby Fae," born
slightly premature two weeks ago with a heart so under
developed that she would have died, so doctors at Loma
Linda University Medical Center decided to use the
baboon's heart.
The child, whose full name was withheld at the parents'
request, was in critical condition Saturday, which is nor
mal after transplant surgery, said hospital spokeswoman
Anita Rockwell.

USSR seeks Chinese ties
MOSCOW — Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko
said Friday that the time is ripe for normalizing Soviet-
Chinese relations to resist American military moves in the
Far East.
He charged that the United States was creating an
"eastern branch" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion by broadening military ties with Japan and South
Korea.
"A build-up of the United States' military-strategic
means in the area close to the U.S.S.R.'s Far Eastern bor
ders is continuing," Chernenko said at a banquet for
Mongolian Prime Minister Jambyn Batmonh.
"A course is being pursued towards reviving Japanese
militarism," the Soviet leader added in a speech reported
bv Tass, the official news agency.
Soviet officials have accused the United States of trying
to exploit the break between Moscow and Peking.
Banks cut prime rate
WASHINGTON — The commercial bank prime lend
ing rate, which stood at 13 percent from July until early
this month, will drop to 12 percent today, a number of
major banks announced Friday. Some financial analysts
expect a further drop in the rate, perhaps next week.
Most of the cuts were from 12.5 percent, though a few
banks, including Bankers Trust Co. of New York, already
were at 12.25 percent.
Short-term money market interest rates have fallen
sharply since early last month, with some rates down
about 1.5 percentage points. The decline has lowered the
banks' cost of obtaining lendable funds and paved the way
for reductions in the prime rate.
Some analysts said banks generally have sought to keep
the prime — to which about half of all commercial and in
dustrial floating rate loans are tied — up to bolster their
profits. However, competitive pressures have forced the
banks to drop the rate.
