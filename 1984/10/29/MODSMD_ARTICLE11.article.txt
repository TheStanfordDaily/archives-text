## The
						Stanford Daily Yes on divestment 
### 
South Africa is the most racist nation on the
face of the earth.
Black South Africans number 24 million —
compared with 4 million whites — yet they have
absolutely no rights. They cannot vote and have
to carry passbooks in order to enter the white
areas of the country. Being caught without a pas
sbook is grounds for arrest.
Black babies in South Africa die at a rate of
128 children per 1,000 births. The infant mor
tality rate for whites is 24 out of 1,000 births.
Black farm workers make $268 per year; whites
$4,987. Amid so much poverty, degradation and
despair, the white South African population en
joys one of the highest standards of living in the
world.
The minority regime in South Africa is able to
oppress the majority of the people because West
ern multinational corporations invest billions of
dollars in that country. This money bolsters the
economy and finances the military which sup
presses the liberation struggles of the African
people.
Bishop Desmond Tutu, recent recipient of the
Nobel Peace Prize, said the only way the situation
will change is through international pressure.
Mindful of this, we enthusiastically endorse the
referendum on tomorrow's ASSU ballot calling

for Stanford to sell its 94,000 shares of stock in
Motorola Corporation.
Motorola for years has sold electronic equip
ment to the South African military and police:
the enforcement arms of the apartheid regime.
But divesting of Motorola is not enough. The
University should do more than "adopt a respon
sible investment policy." We should divest totally
of all companies that do any business with South
Africa.
The argument that we can best address the
South African situation by excercising our share
holder s rights just does not hold water. For 400
years, Western nations have raped the land and
exploited the people of South Africa. If someone
were raping your mother, you would not per
suade or influence the rapist to stop. You would
make him stop.
To retain our integrity we can have no relation
ship with corporations that have partnerships
with such a barbaric government. Nothing less
than complete freedom for black South Africans
is acceptable.
Martin Luther King Jr. said that we will be
judged most harshly not for the sins of the evil
people but the silence of the good people. Let us
speak up. End this disgraceful support of oppres
sion. Divest now.
