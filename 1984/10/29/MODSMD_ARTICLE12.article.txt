The current administration has in
volved us in a senseless and frighten
ing arms race, based on the convic
tion that the Soviet Union will
destroy us if we don't become as dan
gerous as the administration believes
the Soviets to be. With that kind of
paranoia directing its "judgment,"
who knows what it might do next?
Imagine. . . .
One day, the president of the
United States announces the exis
tence of huge stores of government
cheese. The news rocks the Kremlin
— for what end is America hoarding
food? Though the Soviet Union pos
sesses some stored food capability, it
is not enough to match this new U.S.
increase. The Soviet premier orders
immediate buildup in food produc
tion to catch the United States.
Back in Washington, the president
is informed of the steady rise in ac-

. . . cattle that
reproduce faster
than rabbits . . .

cumulations of Soviet edibles. After
quick deliberation, he and his ad
visers conclude that it is the beginning
of a communist plot to feed the
world. They decide to meet this
threat stomach to stomach: The pres
ident calls for higher U.S. output, and
the food race has begun.
Over a period of many months,
giant quantities of grains, fruit and
meats are gathered by both powers.
Ukrainian wheat farmers have their
best year ever, and the United States
counters by discovering new
vegetables, like ketchup. In response
to growing public alarm, the presi
dent goes on national television to say
that the United States will resist this
newest form of Soviet aggression by
working to close the "cupboard of
nutritional vulnerability." America
will stand strong and continue to
stock more food until the Soviets
come to brunch at the bargaining
table.
Soon the race spurs advances in
food technology. Top U.S. scientists
develop the "vitamin-pack" strategy,
in which one pill contains a week's
full supply of nutrients. Both sides
engineer improved strains of various
crops, including seeds able to grow in

any environment, stalks resistant to
disease and insect infestation and
even self-fertilizing legumes. The So
viet Union develops a species of
cattle that reproduces faster than rab
bits. Warned by his aides that the
Soviets are gaining a decisive edge in
combined meal potential, the presi
dent stirs public fears enough to pres
sure Congress into approving his pet
solution: the launch of orbiting
satellite farms. These space nurseries
can rain roughage at will onto the
globe. The threat of dietary devasta
tion occupies the minds of many
American schoolchildren. And the
tension grows.
Ultimately, the government cracks
under the strain. Driven to hysteria
by rumors of a Soviet leap in cooking
utensil design, the head cook at the
White House pleads with the presi
dent, his long-time friend, to stop the
Soviets before they gain an irrever
sible culinary edge over the United
States. The president, now beyond
reason from long, sleepless nights of
worrying, gives the command to
launch the biggest take-out order in
history. First America, then the So
viet Union, bombards the planet with
foodstuffs. Seeds, cheese and grain
pour from long-range crop dusters in
the sky; giant herds of livestock are
landed in Third World countries by
transport ships; the farming satellites
on both sides send tons of young
plants back to earth, ready to grow
and provide yet more nourishment.
Food enough for every human being
engulfs the world.
The aftermath is beyond anyone's
expectations. Once over their shock,
stunned people in democratic,
socialist and totalitarian countries
begin to eat the newly available food.
The hardy super-plants take root,
soon to increase and maintain the
state of plenty. Starvation, for the
moment nullified, begins to fade, one
day to disappear completely. A bright
new future opens for hundreds of mil
lions of people. . . .
Yes, this whole story is absurd. But
it's harmless. The true absurdity is
wasting energy, resources and
thought in an arms race that will kill,
not feed. I'm scared — why don't we
all have lunch together and talk about
it instead?

tion occupies the minds of many
American schoolchildren. And the
tension grows.
Ultimately, the government cracks
under the strain. Driven to hysteria
by rumors of a Soviet leap in cooking
utensil design, the head cook at the
White House pleads with the presi
dent, his long-time friend, to stop the
Soviets before they gain an irrever
sible culinary edge over the United
States. The president, now beyond
reason from long, sleepless nights of
worrying, gives the command to
launch the biggest take-out order in
history. First America, then the So
viet Union, bombards the planet with
foodstuffs. Seeds, cheese and grain
pour from long-range crop dusters in
the sky; giant herds of livestock are
landed in Third World countries by
transport ships; the farming satellites
on both sides send tons of young
plants back to earth, ready to grow
and provide yet more nourishment.
Food enough for every human being
engulfs the world.
The aftermath is beyond anyone's
expectations. Once over their shock,
stunned people in democratic,
socialist and totalitarian countries
begin to eat the newly available food.
The hardy super-plants take root,
soon to increase and maintain the
state of plenty. Starvation, for the
moment nullified, begins to fade, one
day to disappear completely. A bright
new future opens for hundreds of mil
lions of people. . . .
Yes, this whole story is absurd. But
it's harmless. The true absurdity is
wasting energy, resources and
thought in an arms race that will kill,
not feed. I'm scared — why don't we
all have lunch together and talk about
it instead?
