## Implications of bomber development 
### 
Proponents of the B-l bomber base their support
for the program on the grounds that the B-l will
significantly strengthen American bomber forces,
thereby decreasing the risk of nuclear war. This is
essentially the attitude of peace through strength,
which forms the basis of the Reagan administra
tion's defense planning.
Peace through strength contends that as Ameri
can military strength increases, the risk of nuclear
war decreases. This attitude is based on the theory
of deterrence, which states that nuclear war can

VIEWPOINT

best be avoided by making it clear to the leaders of
country A that if they launch a first strike with nu
clear weapons against country B, enough of
country B's nuclear forces will survive to inflict un
acceptable damage on country A in a retaliatory
nuclear strike. Hence, no rational leader of country
A would ever launch a nuclear first strike, since this
would be suicidal. According to this theory, it is es
sential for the nuclear forces of country B to be ca
pable of surviving a first strike by country A. The
United States achieves this survivability by basing
its nuclear forces on land in silos, in the air on
bombers and under the sea in submarines. The
basic idea of this strategy is that even if the Soviets
were to destroy the land-based forces of the United
States, the bomber-based forces would survive be
cause some of them would be airborne, and the
submarine-based forces would survive because nei
ther the United States nor the Soviet Union can lo
cate enemy submarines.
The U.S. bomber forces, however, are losing
their ability to deliver a retaliatory strike. This is
because the U.S. fleet of aging B-52 bombers is
losing its ability to penetrate Soviet airspace. The
B-l bomber, however, is much more capable of
penetrating Soviet airspace than the B-52 due to its
greater speed and limited ability to avoid Soviet
radar detection. Many Americans therefore con
clude that the B-l program should be continued.
Even staunch adherents to the notion of peace
through strength, however, should agree that con
tinuing the B-l program would be a tremendous
waste of resources. This is because newly emerging
Stealth technology could make the B-l obsolete
within a decade. Bombers equiped with Stealth
technology would be much more capable of avoid
ing radar detection than the B-l, and would
therefore be much more capable of penetrating So
viet airspace and delivering a retaliatory strike

against the Soviet homeland.
It would be illogical to spend hundreds of billions
of dollars to procure an obsolete weapon. Ameri
can military strength could be more effectively en
hanced by channeling funds marked for the B-l to
the acceleration of other programs, such as Stealth
development. In the meantime, while research con
tinues to make Stealth technology operational,
submarine-based nuclear forces would maintain
the U.S. capability to inflict unacceptable damage
on the Soviet Union in a retaliatory strike.
According to experts in this area, such as Sidney
Drell, deputy director of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and assistant director of the Stan
ford Center for International Security and Arms
Control, there is virtually no chance of the Soviets
developing the capability to detect and track U.S.
submarines before the end of the century. U.S.
submarine-based nuclear forces would therefore be
able to deliver a retaliatory strike upon the Soviet
Union during the time required for Stealth devel
opment.
Unfortunately, military strength alone cannot
prevent nuclear war. An element of mutual trust
must also exist between superpowers. In times of
international crises, country B must have the faith
that country A is not preparing to launch a nuclear
first strike. If this fear arises, country B may at
tempt to limit the damage it will receive by launch
ing a pre-emptive strike on country A in order to
reduce the offensive capability of country A's nu
clear forces. Procurement of the B-l and Stealth
bombers will increase Soviet fear of a nuclear first
strike by the United States. The Soviets will view
these bombers as first-strike weapons. The
bombers' ability to avoid Soviet radar detection
mean that they could be used to destroy Soviet
land-based ICBM forces while they are still in their
silos. More than 70 percent of Soviet nuclear forces
are land-based ICBMs. Such a bomber attack
would therefore destroy most of the Soviets' ability
to launch a retaliatory attack.
In the eyes of the Soviets, there would therefore
be a great incentive for the United States to launch
a first strike with B-l and/or Stealth bombers.
Regardless of the fact that the United States may
view the B-l and Stealth bombers as retaliatory
weapons, the Soviets will view them as first-strike
weapons. During an international crisis, the Soviets
may therefore fear that the United States is prepar
ing to launch a nuclear first strike, and feel com
pelled to launch a damage-limiting pre-emptive
strike against the United States. From this stand

point, U.S. security could be most effectively en
hanced by canceling both the B-l and Stealth pro
grams.
B-l and Stealth bombers could also increase the
risk of accidental nuclear war. Because of their
ability to avoid radar detection, these aircraft could
deliver a first strike upon the Soviet Union before
Soviet leaders could launch their land-based
missiles. The Soviets may therefore adopt a strat
egy of launch on warning, in which they will launch
their missiles whenever a computer signals that an
attack may be underway.
In the last few decades, however, there have
been hundreds of computer malfunctions in the
United States indicating that the Soviets had com
menced a first strike with bombers and missiles. If
U.S. nuclear forces had previously been placed on
launch-on-warning status, these computer mal
functions would have triggered a nuclear holocaust.
This danger is intensified by the fact that U.S. com
puter systems are far more reliable than Soviet sys
tems. Hence, a decision by the Soviets to place
their nuclear forces on launch-on-warning could
make the Third World War inevitable.
i
This creates a difficult dilemma for American
defense policy planners. It is clear that a new
aircraft is necessary to restore the ability of Ameri
can bombers to penetrate Soviet airspace and
deliver a retaliatory strike, thereby reducing the
risk of nuclear war. On the other hand, the risk of
nuclear war will also be significantly reduced by
canceling potential first-strike weapons programs,
such as the B-l and Stealth bombers. Supporting
the B-l and Stealth programs merely on the
grounds that these weapons will strengthen
America's defense is therefore dangerous and
simple-minded.
Avoiding nuclear war is much more complicated
than simply strengthening U.S. military forces. Per
haps the United States would enhance its security
more effectively by developing a bomber that,
unlike the B-l and Stealth aircraft, cannot be
viewed by the Soviets as a first-strike weapon. Or
perhaps the United States can maximize its security
by strengthening its military through the develop
ment and procurement of bombers capable of
avoiding Soviet radar detection, such as Stealth
aircraft. In either case, however, the B-l bomber
program should be canceled.

a first strike with B-l and/or Stealth bombers.
Regardless of the fact that the United States may
view the B-l and Stealth bombers as retaliatory
weapons, the Soviets will view them as first-strike
weapons. During an international crisis, the Soviets
may therefore fear that the United States is prepar
ing to launch a nuclear first strike, and feel com
pelled to launch a damage-limiting pre-emptive
strike against the United States. From this stand

point, U.S. security could be most effectively en
hanced by canceling both the B-l and Stealth pro
grams.
B-l and Stealth bombers could also increase the
risk of accidental nuclear war. Because of their
ability to avoid radar detection, these aircraft could
deliver a first strike upon the Soviet Union before
Soviet leaders could launch their land-based
missiles. The Soviets may therefore adopt a strat
egy of launch on warning, in which they will launch
their missiles whenever a computer signals that an
attack may be underway.
In the last few decades, however, there have
been hundreds of computer malfunctions in the
United States indicating that the Soviets had com
menced a first strike with bombers and missiles. If
U.S. nuclear forces had previously been placed on
launch-on-warning status, these computer mal
functions would have triggered a nuclear holocaust.
This danger is intensified by the fact that U.S. com
puter systems are far more reliable than Soviet sys
tems. Hence, a decision by the Soviets to place
their nuclear forces on launch-on-warning could
make the Third World War inevitable.
i
This creates a difficult dilemma for American
defense policy planners. It is clear that a new
aircraft is necessary to restore the ability of Ameri
can bombers to penetrate Soviet airspace and
deliver a retaliatory strike, thereby reducing the
risk of nuclear war. On the other hand, the risk of
nuclear war will also be significantly reduced by
canceling potential first-strike weapons programs,
such as the B-l and Stealth bombers. Supporting
the B-l and Stealth programs merely on the
grounds that these weapons will strengthen
America's defense is therefore dangerous and
simple-minded.
Avoiding nuclear war is much more complicated
than simply strengthening U.S. military forces. Per
haps the United States would enhance its security
more effectively by developing a bomber that,
unlike the B-l and Stealth aircraft, cannot be
viewed by the Soviets as a first-strike weapon. Or
perhaps the United States can maximize its security
by strengthening its military through the develop
ment and procurement of bombers capable of
avoiding Soviet radar detection, such as Stealth
aircraft. In either case, however, the B-l bomber
program should be canceled.

Proponents of the B-l bomber base their support
for the program on the grounds that the B-l will
significantly strengthen American bomber forces,
thereby decreasing the risk of nuclear war. This is
essentially the attitude of peace through strength,
which forms the basis of the Reagan administra
tion's defense planning.
Peace through strength contends that as Ameri
can military strength increases, the risk of nuclear
war decreases. This attitude is based on the theory
of deterrence, which states that nuclear war can

VIEWPOINT

best be avoided by making it clear to the leaders of
country A that if they launch a first strike with nu
clear weapons against country B, enough of
country B's nuclear forces will survive to inflict un
acceptable damage on country A in a retaliatory
nuclear strike. Hence, no rational leader of country
A would ever launch a nuclear first strike, since this
would be suicidal. According to this theory, it is es
sential for the nuclear forces of country B to be ca
pable of surviving a first strike by country A. The
United States achieves this survivability by basing
its nuclear forces on land in silos, in the air on
bombers and under the sea in submarines. The
basic idea of this strategy is that even if the Soviets
were to destroy the land-based forces of the United
States, the bomber-based forces would survive be
cause some of them would be airborne, and the
submarine-based forces would survive because nei
ther the United States nor the Soviet Union can lo
cate enemy submarines.
The U.S. bomber forces, however, are losing
their ability to deliver a retaliatory strike. This is
because the U.S. fleet of aging B-52 bombers is
losing its ability to penetrate Soviet airspace. The
B-l bomber, however, is much more capable of
penetrating Soviet airspace than the B-52 due to its
greater speed and limited ability to avoid Soviet
radar detection. Many Americans therefore con
clude that the B-l program should be continued.
Even staunch adherents to the notion of peace
through strength, however, should agree that con
tinuing the B-l program would be a tremendous
waste of resources. This is because newly emerging
Stealth technology could make the B-l obsolete
within a decade. Bombers equiped with Stealth
technology would be much more capable of avoid
ing radar detection than the B-l, and would
therefore be much more capable of penetrating So
viet airspace and delivering a retaliatory strike

against the Soviet homeland.
It would be illogical to spend hundreds of billions
of dollars to procure an obsolete weapon. Ameri
can military strength could be more effectively en
hanced by channeling funds marked for the B-l to
the acceleration of other programs, such as Stealth
development. In the meantime, while research con
tinues to make Stealth technology operational,
submarine-based nuclear forces would maintain
the U.S. capability to inflict unacceptable damage
on the Soviet Union in a retaliatory strike.
According to experts in this area, such as Sidney
Drell, deputy director of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and assistant director of the Stan
ford Center for International Security and Arms
Control, there is virtually no chance of the Soviets
developing the capability to detect and track U.S.
submarines before the end of the century. U.S.
submarine-based nuclear forces would therefore be
able to deliver a retaliatory strike upon the Soviet
Union during the time required for Stealth devel
opment.
Unfortunately, military strength alone cannot
prevent nuclear war. An element of mutual trust
must also exist between superpowers. In times of
international crises, country B must have the faith
that country A is not preparing to launch a nuclear
first strike. If this fear arises, country B may at
tempt to limit the damage it will receive by launch
ing a pre-emptive strike on country A in order to
reduce the offensive capability of country A's nu
clear forces. Procurement of the B-l and Stealth
bombers will increase Soviet fear of a nuclear first
strike by the United States. The Soviets will view
these bombers as first-strike weapons. The
bombers' ability to avoid Soviet radar detection
mean that they could be used to destroy Soviet
land-based ICBM forces while they are still in their
silos. More than 70 percent of Soviet nuclear forces
are land-based ICBMs. Such a bomber attack
would therefore destroy most of the Soviets' ability
to launch a retaliatory attack.
