Incompatible nature
Recent reports of a meeting at the
Hoover Institution on "The
Democratization of the Soviet
Union," sponsored by the Andrei
Sakharov Institute, have identified
us as members of the Institute's
Advisory Board.
We were persuaded to join the
advisory board out of concern for
the Sakharovs and other dissidents
within the Soviet Union, and on the
basis of our interest in various In
stitute proposals such as the devel
opment of a national school for
science and mathematics. None of
us was consulted about the current
conference; indeed, its nature and
its organization, to the extent that
we understand them, sound quite
contrary to the purposes for which
we agreed to support the Institute.

I am very disappointed by the
advertisement for President Reagan
(The Daily, Oct.24). I had under
stood the support for the Hoover
Institution to be an argument for
academic freedom, not for the con
servative Republican ideology that
institution represents. The advertise
ment today convinced me that I was
wrong, and that Hoover — if one
may judge by its most ardent
defender— is guilty of precisely
what Professors Ronald Rebholz and
John Manley, and others charged it.
I am disappointed that the ad
vertisement, like the candidate it
supports, addresses personalities and
not issues. The picture of the presi
dent was very nice, but why should I
vote for him? What does he stand
for? Who does he stand for? I fear
that the advertisement may have
answered those questions more
directly than I would like to think;
Reagan seems to stand only for an
image, and only for himself and his
"class." The Daily editorial (Oct.22)
was right when it assessed Reagan's
performance in the debates:

"Reagan gave a candid perfor
mance in the first debate. He had a
nebulous understanding of the top
ics, and he was unable to gloss ignor
ance with image."
Frankly, I am disappointed most
by Prof. Alphonse Juilland. I fail to
understand how a scholar of the
humanities could support the
Reagan/Bush platform. This admin
istration stands for just about every
thing that I would expect a thinking
human to stand against: discrimina
tion, confrontation and an unthink
ing reliance on rhetoric and outdated
ideology. I don't understand how
Juilland, of all people, the champion
of academic freedom, could per
sonally and financially support that
type of ignorance; the advertisement
is an ironic example of an effort to
gloss ignorance with image.
I am sorry if I seem frustrated; I
am. I just hope that Juilland applies
more critical thought processes to his
academic subject than he does to his
politics.

Mostly Mozart
Last week you published a very
derogatory review of the movie
"Amadeus." I couldn't disagree
more with your reviewer! It is a
wonderful experience, especially for
anyone who enjoys music. I can't
remember just what your reviewer
said about it — all I remember is a
sense of astonishment and wonder
ing whether he was really talking
about the same movie I had seen. I
have not seen the stage production,
but the movie stands on its own
merits. Furthermore, I don't know
how faithful the movie is to the
realities of Mozart's life, but I don't
really care — I was fascinated by
the story, amused by the funny
scenes, terribly sad over the brief
time this genius was alive and
producing this glorious music, and
sorry when the movie ended. Nearly
the entire audience stayed still in
their seats as the movie credits were
rolling, loath to leave their seats
until they had heard the last note.
I want to urge the Stanford com
munity to go see "Amadous" !
