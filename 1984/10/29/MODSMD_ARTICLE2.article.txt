# Libraries check out new check-out plan
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
If Meyer Library has its way, the days of fil
ling out those little yellow check-out cards
may soon be over.
According to Head Librarian Elizabeth Sal
zer, library officials have drafted "functional
specifications" for an automated circulation
processing system which would eliminate the
need for hand-lettered charge cards.
Salzer said "various activities in circula
tion" would be handled by the new system,
which she hopes will be in place sometime
during the 1985-86 academic year.
"I think you'll like the new system," Salzer
said. "In general terms, you won't have to fill
out those little cards you have to fill out now
to borrow materials from the library. It should
make things go a lot faster."
Salzer said the proposed new system would
affect reserved reading as well as long-term
borrowing.
Problems have been caused by the current
system, Salzer said, which not only is slow and
tedious, but creates problems for the clerks
who are reading the handwriting on the
charge cards. "When you fill the charge cards
out, and you get a big stack, the handwriting
tends to go downhill after five or six cards,"
Salzer said.
Currently, to check out books at Stanford
libraries, a student must fill out a yellow slip
with a carbon copy beneath it that not only in
cludes the author and title of the book, but
also the student's name, address, and phone
number, a box to be checked by the student
which says "OK to disclose my name as bor
rower" and the alphanumeric decimal nota
tion indicating the book's location.
Salzer acknowledged that the system is
"labor-intensive," and some students agree.
Freshman Stacey Ley ton said she dislikes
the system's tediousness. "It seems to be it

could be done a lot more efficiently," she said.
"Every time you fill out a card you put your
name, your address and all that other infor
mation down. It seems like they could have it
all on file. Then it wouldn't be so time
consuming."
Kim Miller, also a freshman, works at the
Mathematics-Computer Science Library and
can attest to the problems of reading the
scrawls of fatigued borrowers. "When people
fill out the cards, it's a problem because they
begin to write messy after a while," she said.
"That information's really important, and it
tends to make for a lot of work because you
have to file it."
The automated system would be based on a
system used by many libraries across the
country, Salzer said. The computer would
digitally "read," by means of a metallic
"wand" or similar device, a barcode label on
the back of the books. The barcode label
would be similar to the kind seen on packages
in supermarkets.
Initially, Salzer said, there would still be
lines at the circulation desk, because students
would still have to take their books to be
scanned. However, that would be a lot faster
than the current method, she said.
Salzer expressed a hope that eventually the
circulation system could be connected to the
Socrates catalog in such a way that students
could check out materials themselves, elimin
ating the need for check-out lines. She did not
indicate, however, when such a connection
could be implemented.
Salzer said library officials have been and
will continue to be talking to system vendors.
She made no indication of any specific
deadlines by which the library would want to
have the system installed, but said she hopes
the system will be installed "sometime next
academic year."
