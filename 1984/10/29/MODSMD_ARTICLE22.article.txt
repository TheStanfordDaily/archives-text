## Major genetic engineering patent held here Stanford can splice, recombine genes 
### NIKO SCHIFF 
In the first segment of a two-part series, The Daily ex
amines the biological and legal aspects of recombinant
DNA. The second part will appear next Monday.

In late August, Stanford University and the University
of California system were issued a key patent covering the
products derived from genetically engineered organisms
and the basic processes of genetic engineering.
The patent, known as the second Cohen-Boyer patent,
is the companion to one awarded to Stanford and the
University of California in 1980. The earlier patent cov
ered the basic method of splicing and recombining genes
to create a recombinant DNA molecule. It was part of an
original application filed ten years ago, which is also the
basis of the current patent.
The patents are based on research done in 1973 by
Stanley Cohen, professor of genetics at the Stanford
School of Medicine, and Herbert Boyer, professor of
biochemistry at the University of California in San Fran
cisco.
The current patent covers the products derived from
gene recombination, which are either sold as finished

products or as hulk products to be processed further. Also
included in this second patent are the products actually
used in the initial process of recombination, and any prod
uct a licensed company uses or develops in its work to im
prove the basic process.
The fundamental technique in the field of genetic engi
neering is the ability to manipulate genes through the
process of recombination. Genes are the basic unit of in
formation in living systems. They are found interspersed
in the long strands of genetic material called DNA. Genes
contain the plans for the structure, development, and
reproduction of the organism in whose DNA they are
found (see diagram).
The genetic engineering industry makes use of the iden
tification of certain genes as coded for specific characteris
tics, such as enzymes, hormones or antibodies.
Making use of the process patented by Stanford, scien
tists are able to cut into a DNA molecule and remove spe
cific genetic material, recombine the material into the ge
netic apparatus of a bacterium (a small unicellular organ
ism) and have the characteristic reproduced in quantity by
the continued reproduction of the bacterial cell.

According to Niels Reimers, director of Stanford's of
fice of technology licensing, the two patents give Stanford
a proprietary position over the basic methodology and
tools used throughout the biotechnology industry until
1997.
"This is an extraordinary basic patent," said Reimers.
The new patent is significant because the Patent Office
has confirmed basic rights granted in the original gene
cloning methods patent.
Technology licensing associate director Katherine Ku
said. "We believe that virtually all genetic engineering
companies are using this patented technology in their re
search and development."
To obtain a patent on a product or process, the
patented idea must meet three qualifications: It must be
new, useful and non-obvious. Although the first two
qualifications can usually be argued clearly, the deter
mination of the "obviousness" of an idea is more difficult
to ascertain.
The definition of non-obvious is "something that is
non-obvious to someone of ordinary skill in the art.
"In all three cases, but especially in the situation of

'obviousness,' the decision comes down to a judgment
call," Ku said.
Major complaints lodged against the new patent in
cluded claims against the non-obviousness of the tech
nique, a claim of co-inventorship which was found lacking
in evidence and a complaint concerned with whether the
patent was "enabling.
Patent specifications are required to be enabling, that
is they must provide sutlicent information to enable a
person "skilled in the art" to reproduce the invention.
The original application described how a particular plas
mid was made, which was later revised by Cohen in a sci
entific report. The Patent Office's concern was that they
had not been informed of the further report and that
others trying to reproduce the invention might not have
been able to succeed.
Stanford attorney Bertram Rowland argued that the
plasmid had been given out freely by Cohen and Boyer to
scientists who requested it, and that the original interpre
tation had proven to work as well in laboratories around

the world.
"The Patent Office accepted our
argument that the application was
enabling despite some question about
the origin of one particular plasmid
used in the first successful experi
ments," Reimers said.
"The Patent Office also ruled that
recombined DNA molecules from
different species are not 'products of
nature,' " Reimers said.
Products of nature cannot be
patented. However, this stipulation
can be worked around. For example
milk cannot be patented as it is the
natural product of an animal. If milk
can be processed, homogenized for
instance, and the process can fit the
criteria of a patentable idea, the pro
cessed milk can be patented since it is
no longer in its natural form.
In reference to the Cohen-Boyer
patent, gene recombination is a fre
quent occurrence in nature. Ku ex
plained that to avoid this problem the
wording of the patent had to be speci
fied to make clear the distinction be
tween natural recombination, and the
recombination of foreign genes in the
patent.
The Cohen-Boyer patent states in
its first claim that "a first DNA seg
ment ... is covalently joined in vitro
at its end to the complementary ends
of a second DNA segment foreign to
said cell .. . derived from a source
which does not exchange genetic in
formation with said cell."
Hence, the distinction separating

the claim from a product of nature is
that the recombined gene is a foreign
gene, something that does not ex
change normally with the first cell.
The actual process of gene recom
bination (see diagram on page 6) in
volves the breaking open of living
cells and extraction of their DNA
molecules (Step 1). After the DNA
has been isolated, specific genes of in
terest are cut away from the rest of
the DNA by special biochemical
molecules called enzymes (Step 2).
The process of recombination in
volves the insertion of these genes
into small units of DNA which act as
carriers and insert themselves and the
"recombinant" DNA into a living mi
croorganism.
These smaller units of DNA, fre
quently circular rings called plasmids,
accept the additional DNA spliced
into their structures, and can be used
as an effective tool to insert almost
any DNA fragment into a living bac
teria cell. These must also be cut to
allow the desired gene to splice into
the ring. The two ends where the
plasmid rings are cut are "sticky" and
with the help of enzymes are able to
bind the ring again with the new
DNA (Steps 3 and 4).
The plasmid with its new gene then
inserts itself into a host bacteria cell.
This bacteria is called a transformant,
meaning that the free DNA has
become a permanent part of its
structure.
This transformant bacteria is a mi
croscopic organism that reproduces
itself quickly and can consequently be
grown in number to produce large
quantities of the product whose infor
mation was contained in the the ex
tracted gene.

wording of the patent had to be speci
fied to make clear the distinction be
tween natural recombination, and the
recombination of foreign genes in the
patent.
The Cohen-Boyer patent states in
its first claim that "a first DNA seg
ment ... is covalently joined in vitro
at its end to the complementary ends
of a second DNA segment foreign to
said cell .. . derived from a source
which does not exchange genetic in
formation with said cell."
Hence, the distinction separating

the claim from a product of nature is
that the recombined gene is a foreign
gene, something that does not ex
change normally with the first cell.
The actual process of gene recom
bination (see diagram on page 6) in
volves the breaking open of living
cells and extraction of their DNA
molecules (Step 1). After the DNA
has been isolated, specific genes of in
terest are cut away from the rest of
the DNA by special biochemical
molecules called enzymes (Step 2).
The process of recombination in
volves the insertion of these genes
into small units of DNA which act as
carriers and insert themselves and the
"recombinant" DNA into a living mi
croorganism.
These smaller units of DNA, fre
quently circular rings called plasmids,
accept the additional DNA spliced
into their structures, and can be used
as an effective tool to insert almost
any DNA fragment into a living bac
teria cell. These must also be cut to
allow the desired gene to splice into
the ring. The two ends where the
plasmid rings are cut are "sticky" and
with the help of enzymes are able to
bind the ring again with the new
DNA (Steps 3 and 4).
The plasmid with its new gene then
inserts itself into a host bacteria cell.
This bacteria is called a transformant,
meaning that the free DNA has
become a permanent part of its
structure.
This transformant bacteria is a mi
croscopic organism that reproduces
itself quickly and can consequently be
grown in number to produce large
quantities of the product whose infor
mation was contained in the the ex
tracted gene.

In late August, Stanford University and the University
of California system were issued a key patent covering the
products derived from genetically engineered organisms
and the basic processes of genetic engineering.
The patent, known as the second Cohen-Boyer patent,
is the companion to one awarded to Stanford and the
University of California in 1980. The earlier patent cov
ered the basic method of splicing and recombining genes
to create a recombinant DNA molecule. It was part of an
original application filed ten years ago, which is also the
basis of the current patent.
The patents are based on research done in 1973 by
Stanley Cohen, professor of genetics at the Stanford
School of Medicine, and Herbert Boyer, professor of
biochemistry at the University of California in San Fran
cisco.
The current patent covers the products derived from
gene recombination, which are either sold as finished

products or as hulk products to be processed further. Also
included in this second patent are the products actually
used in the initial process of recombination, and any prod
uct a licensed company uses or develops in its work to im
prove the basic process.
The fundamental technique in the field of genetic engi
neering is the ability to manipulate genes through the
process of recombination. Genes are the basic unit of in
formation in living systems. They are found interspersed
in the long strands of genetic material called DNA. Genes
contain the plans for the structure, development, and
reproduction of the organism in whose DNA they are
found (see diagram).
The genetic engineering industry makes use of the iden
tification of certain genes as coded for specific characteris
tics, such as enzymes, hormones or antibodies.
Making use of the process patented by Stanford, scien
tists are able to cut into a DNA molecule and remove spe
cific genetic material, recombine the material into the ge
netic apparatus of a bacterium (a small unicellular organ
ism) and have the characteristic reproduced in quantity by
the continued reproduction of the bacterial cell.

According to Niels Reimers, director of Stanford's of
fice of technology licensing, the two patents give Stanford
a proprietary position over the basic methodology and
tools used throughout the biotechnology industry until
1997.
"This is an extraordinary basic patent," said Reimers.
The new patent is significant because the Patent Office
has confirmed basic rights granted in the original gene
cloning methods patent.
Technology licensing associate director Katherine Ku
said. "We believe that virtually all genetic engineering
companies are using this patented technology in their re
search and development."
To obtain a patent on a product or process, the
patented idea must meet three qualifications: It must be
new, useful and non-obvious. Although the first two
qualifications can usually be argued clearly, the deter
mination of the "obviousness" of an idea is more difficult
to ascertain.
The definition of non-obvious is "something that is
non-obvious to someone of ordinary skill in the art.
"In all three cases, but especially in the situation of

'obviousness,' the decision comes down to a judgment
call," Ku said.
Major complaints lodged against the new patent in
cluded claims against the non-obviousness of the tech
nique, a claim of co-inventorship which was found lacking
in evidence and a complaint concerned with whether the
patent was "enabling.
Patent specifications are required to be enabling, that
is they must provide sutlicent information to enable a
person "skilled in the art" to reproduce the invention.
The original application described how a particular plas
mid was made, which was later revised by Cohen in a sci
entific report. The Patent Office's concern was that they
had not been informed of the further report and that
others trying to reproduce the invention might not have
been able to succeed.
Stanford attorney Bertram Rowland argued that the
plasmid had been given out freely by Cohen and Boyer to
scientists who requested it, and that the original interpre
tation had proven to work as well in laboratories around

the world.
"The Patent Office accepted our
argument that the application was
enabling despite some question about
the origin of one particular plasmid
used in the first successful experi
ments," Reimers said.
"The Patent Office also ruled that
recombined DNA molecules from
different species are not 'products of
nature,' " Reimers said.
Products of nature cannot be
patented. However, this stipulation
can be worked around. For example
milk cannot be patented as it is the
natural product of an animal. If milk
can be processed, homogenized for
instance, and the process can fit the
criteria of a patentable idea, the pro
cessed milk can be patented since it is
no longer in its natural form.
