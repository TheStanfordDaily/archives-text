# Hangovers and leftovers
## Move to California and get a life 
### BRIDGET HYLAK I was only typical 
As I packed my bags and planned
on heading all the way out to Stan
ford from my home in Chicago, I
wondered what college would be
like. I wondered who my roommate
would be, what classes I'd be taking
and how much studying I'd have to
do. I wondered what the social
scene would be like and if I'd be
able to compete academically. Ad
justing to Stanford would be a big
transition and I knew it; but I never
anticipated the real challenge — ad
justing to California.
It didn't hit me right away. At
first, I was only concerned with the
"Stanford transition"— becoming
settled in my classes, meeting new
people and finding my way around
campus.
After this, however, my real
problems began. Little by little, I
started to sense that I was different.
What's more, since the majority of
my Stanford friends were Califor
nians, they didn't realize what I was
going through.
They didn't realize that in
Chicago, we "scan" instead of
"scam," that things are "cool" in
stead of "hot," that 65 degrees and
drizzly is considered great October
weather and that "bitchen' " is a

word you just wouldn't use around
your mom.
They couldn't understand that
there was nothing unusual about the
way I talked — all mv family and

friends talked through their nose just
like I did. And many people kept
complaining that I talked too fast.

On top of everything else, I was
constantly recognized as "different"
because of my accent. I couldn't
believe how many people said 1
talked funny just because 1
pronounced the word "apple" the
only logical way: "aypple," and not
"ahhhpple" like all the Californians.
The differences I noticed as a
"foreigner" in California didn't end
with my speech patterns. The Califor
nia culture shock was starting to close
in on me from all directions, and
though 1 tried my best to resist for a
while, it was only a matter of
time. .. .
Christmas vacation was quickly ap
proaching. Soon, I'd be hopping on a
plane back to the sub-zero tempera
tures and windchill factors that, as far
as I was concerned, captured the true
meaning of Christmas. I was anxious
to see my friends and family again,
but 1 was even more anxious for them
to see a whole new me. I only had one
problem: I didn't know who the
"whole new me" was.
That was it. I was determined to
become Californianized. I started a
crash fitness program of jogging and
aerobics from dawn until dusk. I
bought a leather jacket and a pair of

three-inch earrings and I pierced two
extra holes in my ear.
I invested in a new outfit that
looked four sizes too big, and I even

had my hair cut super short, but left a
bleached-blond tail hanging down my
neck. With some hot-pink lipstick,
orange bobby socks and a pair of flat

leather army boots, I finally felt ready
to face my family.
Unfortunately, things didn't turn
out exactly as I'd expected. For
starters, my mom didn't even recog
nize me at the airport. When 1 finally
convinced her that I really was her
daughter, she did not look pleased. It
was obvious that this was going to be
a big transition for her, and though I
tried not to overdo it, I just couldn't
help myself.
I played my reggae tapes through
out the vacation, talked of fro-yo and
"hitting the beach," complained that
my tan was fading, and entertained
thoughts of dying my tail fucia to
match my new feather earrings. My
dad even let me call him "dude" a
few times without complaining, but
when I suggested we stuff the turkey
with tofu, I think everyone had had
just about enough.
That was almost a year ago. Now
that I've returned to Stanford as a
sophomore, I've settled down and
resumed my much-preferred midwes
tern lifestyle. What's more, when I
look back, I can hardly believe 1 fell
so deeply into the trap.
I finally noticed, and it took me al
most a year to do it, that the real
Californians are not nearly so fanatic

as those who try to imitate them. In
fact, if you take a look at some of
your friends, you just might find that
the most gung-ho Californian is from
Montana or New York ... or even
Chicago. With that realization, my

transition into Stanford life was fi
nally complete, even though I still
can't go a day without fro-yo.

match my new feather earrings. My
dad even let me call him "dude" a
few times without complaining, but
when I suggested we stuff the turkey
with tofu, I think everyone had had
just about enough.
That was almost a year ago. Now
that I've returned to Stanford as a
sophomore, I've settled down and
resumed my much-preferred midwes
tern lifestyle. What's more, when I
look back, I can hardly believe 1 fell
so deeply into the trap.
I finally noticed, and it took me al
most a year to do it, that the real
Californians are not nearly so fanatic

as those who try to imitate them. In
fact, if you take a look at some of
your friends, you just might find that
the most gung-ho Californian is from
Montana or New York ... or even
Chicago. With that realization, my

transition into Stanford life was fi
nally complete, even though I still
can't go a day without fro-yo.



As I packed my bags and planned
on heading all the way out to Stan
ford from my home in Chicago, I
wondered what college would be
like. I wondered who my roommate
would be, what classes I'd be taking
and how much studying I'd have to
do. I wondered what the social
scene would be like and if I'd be
able to compete academically. Ad
justing to Stanford would be a big
transition and I knew it; but I never
anticipated the real challenge — ad
justing to California.
It didn't hit me right away. At
first, I was only concerned with the
"Stanford transition"— becoming
settled in my classes, meeting new
people and finding my way around
campus.
After this, however, my real
problems began. Little by little, I
started to sense that I was different.
What's more, since the majority of
my Stanford friends were Califor
nians, they didn't realize what I was
going through.
They didn't realize that in
Chicago, we "scan" instead of
"scam," that things are "cool" in
stead of "hot," that 65 degrees and
drizzly is considered great October
weather and that "bitchen' " is a

word you just wouldn't use around
your mom.
They couldn't understand that
there was nothing unusual about the
way I talked — all mv family and

friends talked through their nose just
like I did. And many people kept
complaining that I talked too fast.

On top of everything else, I was
constantly recognized as "different"
because of my accent. I couldn't
believe how many people said 1
talked funny just because 1
pronounced the word "apple" the
only logical way: "aypple," and not
"ahhhpple" like all the Californians.
The differences I noticed as a
"foreigner" in California didn't end
with my speech patterns. The Califor
nia culture shock was starting to close
in on me from all directions, and
though 1 tried my best to resist for a
while, it was only a matter of
time. .. .
Christmas vacation was quickly ap
proaching. Soon, I'd be hopping on a
plane back to the sub-zero tempera
tures and windchill factors that, as far
as I was concerned, captured the true
meaning of Christmas. I was anxious
to see my friends and family again,
but 1 was even more anxious for them
to see a whole new me. I only had one
problem: I didn't know who the
"whole new me" was.
That was it. I was determined to
become Californianized. I started a
crash fitness program of jogging and
aerobics from dawn until dusk. I
bought a leather jacket and a pair of

three-inch earrings and I pierced two
extra holes in my ear.
I invested in a new outfit that
looked four sizes too big, and I even

had my hair cut super short, but left a
bleached-blond tail hanging down my
neck. With some hot-pink lipstick,
orange bobby socks and a pair of flat

leather army boots, I finally felt ready
to face my family.
Unfortunately, things didn't turn
out exactly as I'd expected. For
starters, my mom didn't even recog
nize me at the airport. When 1 finally
convinced her that I really was her
daughter, she did not look pleased. It
was obvious that this was going to be
a big transition for her, and though I
tried not to overdo it, I just couldn't
help myself.
I played my reggae tapes through
out the vacation, talked of fro-yo and
"hitting the beach," complained that
my tan was fading, and entertained
thoughts of dying my tail fucia to
match my new feather earrings. My
dad even let me call him "dude" a
few times without complaining, but
when I suggested we stuff the turkey
with tofu, I think everyone had had
just about enough.
That was almost a year ago. Now
that I've returned to Stanford as a
sophomore, I've settled down and
resumed my much-preferred midwes
