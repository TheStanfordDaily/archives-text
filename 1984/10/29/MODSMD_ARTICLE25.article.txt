## Card slips by Beavers for comeback 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — It was a typically cold, rainy day
for Saturday's football game between Oregon State and
Stanford. And is typically the case in wet weather, things
were hard to hold on to.
Stanford couldn't hang on to the football, and fumbled
seven times. Oregon State, meanwhile, couldn't hang on
to a 21-0 first-quarter lead, and lost the game, 28-21.
Stanford, 4-4 overall and 2-3 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, took good notes last Saturday, when it watched
Washington State stage the biggest comeback in NCAA
Division 1-A history, coming back from a 42-14 deficit to
win 49-42. And this Saturday, Stanford showed what it
had learned.
"I couldn't be prouder of the ballclub, especially after
last week," a relieved Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"Bad things happened to us early, but instead of them
staying with us, we rose (above them)."
After chopping the Beavers' lead to 21-20 at the half,
Stanford took the lead with 7:35 remaining on a safety by
linebacker Mike Noble. The Cardinal added an extra
point-less touchdown with 0:58 to go when quarterback
Fred Buckley snuck over from the one and Mark Harmon
missed the point after.
But as in two of Stanford's three other victories this
season, the game wasn't over until, well, it was over. It
took an Eric Price interception in the end zone on the
game's final play to secure only the Cardinal's third Pac
-10 triumph in its last 15 tries.
Price's interception wasn't without controversy, though.
Oregon State's Reggie Bynum, the intended receiver on
the play, told Beaver Coach Joe Avezzano he had posses
sion of the ball before Price came away with it.
"In a very brief comment (in the locker room), Reggie
said he felt like he had the ball," Avezzano told reporters,
pointing out that a tie ball goes to the offensive player.
Price and Elway saw it differently. "I took it away from
him in the air," Price said. "Obviously, he didn't have full
possession because if he did, he would have come down
with it."
Elway admitted he didn't have a good view of the play,
but when asked if the call was questionable, he replied,
"It's an interception."
Oregon State also was grumbling about Noble's safety
that gave Stanford the lead, let alone momentum. Quar
terback Ricky Greene, who replaced starter Steve Steen
wyk early in the fourth quarter after Steenwyk sprained
his wrist, was caught from behind by Noble on a sprint out
left, and fell smack on the goal line.
"I got the quarterback by his legs and he fell," Noble
said. "The call could have gone either way. It (the call)
wasn't that quick. I looked at the ref behind me and he
didn't call it. But then the ref on the other sideline called
it. I was very ecstatic."
Avezzano was anything but ecstatic when it came to dis
cussing field position. After the first quarter, Stanford's
average starting field position was its own 49 yard line,
while Oregon State's was its own 18. And for that, Stan
ford can thank a strong wind and a Beaver punting game
that would make most Pop Warner teams look good.
Oregon State punters Jim Nielsen and David Brundage
punted seven times, averaging 23.3 yards per kick. Nei
ther had a punt longer than 29 yards.
Brundage, who replaced Neilsen in the second half, was
in a Beaver uniform for the first time Saturday. After an
injury sidelined Charles Stembeck and his 39.2-yards
per-punt average, Avezzano took an ad out in the school
paper last week announcing punting tryouts. Brundage
was one of two students selected from 25 candidates.
"If you don't punt the ball [well] and you're in that type
of game, it's going to catch up with you," Avezzano said.

"The kicking game was the major factor in the game
today. It was a real terrible exhibition of punting."
And once Stanford got the ball, it kept it for a while.
The Cardinal easily won the time of possession battle,
36:21 to 23:39. In the fourth quarter alone, Stanford had
the ball for 10 minutes 44 seconds.
Most of that time was in a 68-yard, 14-play drive follow
ing Noble's safety that chewed 6:37 off the clock. Oregon
State actually forced a Stanford punt with 5:06 to go, but
an offsides penalty gave the Cardinal a first down — and a
new life. Nine plays and 46 yards later, Buckley scored
from the one and the Beavers were left with 58 seconds to
mount a comeback.
After throwing incomplete on first down, Greene hit
four straight passes and moved the Beavers to the Stan
ford 34. He then missed on three end zone passes to
Bynum. Bynum maintained his Pac-10 receiving lead with
eight catches for 117 yards.
Stanford's hero — and workhorse — was Brad Muster,
who rushed 32 times for 137 yards, all but 21 yards of the
Cardinal's rushing total. His 32 carries were two shy of the
Stanford record, set in 1925 by Ernie Nevers against
Notre Dame.
But it was Buckley who Elway praised the most. "What
Fred did today was prevent the turnover," Elway said of
his quarterback who has thrown 12 interceptions in his
five games. Buckley only threw one Saturday, completing
15-of-24 passes for 127 yards. "This was his best football
game."
While he was on the subject of quarterbacks, Elway
said John Paye, the sophomore starter Buckley replaced
five weeks ago, probably would not be ready for Satur
day's home game against USC.
"He's hasn't worked out at all," Elway said. "He'll start
throwing this week, but I think it (his return) will be
against Arizona."
While Cardinal players and coaches were celebrating
after the game, that was hardly the case in the first quar
ter. Even the great philosopher Murphy himself couldn't
have written a better first-quarter script for Stanford. Ab
solutely everything that could have gone wrong, did.
Stanford fumbled the opening kickoff at its own 10-
yard line. Three plays and 55 seconds later, tailback
Donald Beavers ran it in from one yard out.
At least the Cardinal didn't fumble the second Beaver
kickoff. Instead, it kept the ball three plays and moved it
three yards — backwards. Doug Robison punted to the
Stanford 47, and Oregon State took six plays to put it into
the end zone.
Stanford actually got a first down on its third posses
sion, but after stalling on it own 26, Robison got off an 11 -
yard punt. This time, it took Oregon State seven plays to
score.
All this 10:58 into the game.
But Stanford bounced back, improving its road record
to 2-1. "We wanted to come out this week and show
everyone that we could come back from a loss like last
week," Noble said.
Card notes
Oregon State's 21-point outburst in the first quarter
made it 56 unanswered points scored against Stanford,
dating back to the Washington State game when the
Cougars tallied 35 points in the final 18 minutes and 20
seconds of the game.
Stanford played with a restructured secondary Satur
day. Since Eric Price and Joe Cain were sidelined with in
juries, Walt Harris and Mark Hashimoto started. Price,
however, played the final series when Toi Cook went off
with what is thought to be a broken nose.
Placekicker Mark Harmon moved within four points of
Darrin Nelson's all-time Stanford career scoring record of
242 points.

Junior linebacker Mike Noble (94) was the cause for celebration and controversy on Saturday as he sacked
Oregon State quarterback Rickey Greene for a safety in the fourth quarter. He and the brothers Wyman,
Dave (92) and Mike (79), celebrate his safety which gave Stanford a 22-21 lead.
