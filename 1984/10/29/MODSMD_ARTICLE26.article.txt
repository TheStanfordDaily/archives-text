# End nears for Avezzano

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — The post-game football in
terview room at Oregon State University isn't in
40,593-seat Parker Stadium, but in the basement of
nearby Gill Coliseum, where the Beavers play basket
ball.
And it isn't really a real interview room, but an an
nex to the trainer's facilities. You walk down a cor
ridor, through a taping room and between a few
whirlpools to get there.
After each home game, Coach Joe Avezzano walks
to the room with not much more than a table, a few

dozen chairs and a carpeted floor. And during his five
year tenure at Oregon State, few of those walks have
followed victories.
Avezzano took that walk Saturday following Oregon
State's game with Stanford. He made his way past the
reporters to the back of the room and sat behind a long
wooden table. He said nothing.
Not only had Oregon State just lost to Stanford, 28-
21, it had lost after leading 21-0 less than 11 minutes
into the game. And no one had to ask Avezzano how
he felt. The pain and disappointment was written all
over his face.
Avezzano remained silent, studying the
microphones in front of him. He leaned back, pulled a
tired piece of gum out of his mouth and put it in the
ashtray on the table. Then he reached in the jacket
pocket of his orange nylon jacket and got a new stick.
Like his hair, the gum was soaking wet.
Finally, a reporter broke the silence, though ner
vously so. He asked Avezzano about the last play of
the game, in which Stanford cornerback Eric Price
stole the ball from receiver Reggie Bynum in the end
zone.
Avezzano said Bynum said that he had possession
before Price wrestled the ball away. Had the officials
ruled it a catch, it would have been an Oregon State
touchdown and made the score 28-27. Then the

Beavers could have tried either to tie or win the game,
depending on if they attempted a one- or two-point
conversion.
But hypothetical situations are just that — hypo
thetical. The play was ruled an interception. Game
over. Stanford 28, Oregon State 21. Another Oregon
State loss.
Five years ago, however, Avezzano wouldn't have
even had the opportunity to talk about "what ifs" in a
Oregon State football game. That was Avezzano's
debut season, when the Beavers were 0-11. When the
Beavers lost by scores of 30-10, 42-14, 35-0, 41-6, 27-
6, 31-21, 54-13, 28-7, 40-21, 24-7 and 34-3.
Since then, Avezzano's Black Bandits, as the team
likes to be called, have steadily, albeit slowly, im
proved. A year later, they were 1-10. In 1982, they
were 1-9-1 and last season they finally reached the
two-win mark with a 2-8-1 record.
Avezzano also won his first Pacific 10 Conference
game last year, when the Oregon State upset Stanford,
31-18, and the students tore down a goalpost. It was a

Commentary

message to the rest of the conference that the Beavers
were getting better, moving ever closer to at least being
competitive.
Still, Avezzano, who is in the final year of a five-year
contract, almost lost his job. The Board of Intercol
legiate Athletics at Oregon State voted 11-5 to fire
him, but University President Robert Mac Vicar boldly
vetoed the decision on the recommendation of Athletic
Director Dee Andros.
Avezzano was given one more chance. And it was
with a team that Avezzano called "by far the best
we've had at Oregon State in quite a while."
So far, the Beavers are 2-6 overall and 1-4 in the
Pac-10. They defeated the University of Wyoming, 42-
14, and the University of California at Berkeley, 9-6.
They also came oh-so-close against No. 1-ranked
Washington and No. 6-ranked Ohio State, losing by
scores of 19-7 and 22-14, respectively.
A victory over Stanford Saturday would have been
nice. It also might have saved Avezzano's job. Now
with road games against Washington State University
and UCLA, Avezzano's only realistic chance for his
third 'W is at home against the University of Oregon
in the final game of the season.
But even a victory over the Ducks may not save
Avezzano. It's a business in which a man's competence
is judged by his win-loss record. It's unfortunate, but
those are the rules and Avezzano, like all coaches,
plays by them.
There's no question Oregon State has improved.
Just ask any of its opponents this season. Or ask Stan
ford last season. It's just that this improvement isn't
reflected in its record.
"We haven't improved enough to have the kind of
record we want," Avezzano says, "but we've never
been this close before, either."
Close, however, doesn't count in football games. Or
in contract negotiations. Avezzano's running out of
time and he knows it. If he doesn't, he'll find out soon
enough.

reflected in its record.
"We haven't improved enough to have the kind of
record we want," Avezzano says, "but we've never
been this close before, either."
Close, however, doesn't count in football games. Or
in contract negotiations. Avezzano's running out of
time and he knows it. If he doesn't, he'll find out soon
enough.

CORVALLIS, Ore. — The post-game football in
terview room at Oregon State University isn't in
40,593-seat Parker Stadium, but in the basement of
nearby Gill Coliseum, where the Beavers play basket
ball.
And it isn't really a real interview room, but an an
nex to the trainer's facilities. You walk down a cor
ridor, through a taping room and between a few
whirlpools to get there.
After each home game, Coach Joe Avezzano walks
to the room with not much more than a table, a few

dozen chairs and a carpeted floor. And during his five
year tenure at Oregon State, few of those walks have
followed victories.
Avezzano took that walk Saturday following Oregon
State's game with Stanford. He made his way past the
reporters to the back of the room and sat behind a long
wooden table. He said nothing.
Not only had Oregon State just lost to Stanford, 28-
21, it had lost after leading 21-0 less than 11 minutes
into the game. And no one had to ask Avezzano how
he felt. The pain and disappointment was written all
over his face.
Avezzano remained silent, studying the
microphones in front of him. He leaned back, pulled a
tired piece of gum out of his mouth and put it in the
ashtray on the table. Then he reached in the jacket
pocket of his orange nylon jacket and got a new stick.
Like his hair, the gum was soaking wet.
Finally, a reporter broke the silence, though ner
vously so. He asked Avezzano about the last play of
the game, in which Stanford cornerback Eric Price
stole the ball from receiver Reggie Bynum in the end
zone.
Avezzano said Bynum said that he had possession
before Price wrestled the ball away. Had the officials
ruled it a catch, it would have been an Oregon State
touchdown and made the score 28-27. Then the

Beavers could have tried either to tie or win the game,
depending on if they attempted a one- or two-point
conversion.
But hypothetical situations are just that — hypo
thetical. The play was ruled an interception. Game
over. Stanford 28, Oregon State 21. Another Oregon
State loss.
Five years ago, however, Avezzano wouldn't have
even had the opportunity to talk about "what ifs" in a
Oregon State football game. That was Avezzano's
debut season, when the Beavers were 0-11. When the
Beavers lost by scores of 30-10, 42-14, 35-0, 41-6, 27-
6, 31-21, 54-13, 28-7, 40-21, 24-7 and 34-3.
Since then, Avezzano's Black Bandits, as the team
likes to be called, have steadily, albeit slowly, im
proved. A year later, they were 1-10. In 1982, they
were 1-9-1 and last season they finally reached the
two-win mark with a 2-8-1 record.
Avezzano also won his first Pacific 10 Conference
game last year, when the Oregon State upset Stanford,
31-18, and the students tore down a goalpost. It was a

Commentary

message to the rest of the conference that the Beavers
were getting better, moving ever closer to at least being
competitive.
Still, Avezzano, who is in the final year of a five-year
contract, almost lost his job. The Board of Intercol
legiate Athletics at Oregon State voted 11-5 to fire
him, but University President Robert Mac Vicar boldly
vetoed the decision on the recommendation of Athletic
Director Dee Andros.
Avezzano was given one more chance. And it was
with a team that Avezzano called "by far the best
we've had at Oregon State in quite a while."
So far, the Beavers are 2-6 overall and 1-4 in the
Pac-10. They defeated the University of Wyoming, 42-
14, and the University of California at Berkeley, 9-6.
They also came oh-so-close against No. 1-ranked
Washington and No. 6-ranked Ohio State, losing by
scores of 19-7 and 22-14, respectively.
A victory over Stanford Saturday would have been
nice. It also might have saved Avezzano's job. Now
with road games against Washington State University
and UCLA, Avezzano's only realistic chance for his
third 'W is at home against the University of Oregon
in the final game of the season.
But even a victory over the Ducks may not save
Avezzano. It's a business in which a man's competence
is judged by his win-loss record. It's unfortunate, but
those are the rules and Avezzano, like all coaches,
plays by them.
There's no question Oregon State has improved.
Just ask any of its opponents this season. Or ask Stan
ford last season. It's just that this improvement isn't
reflected in its record.
