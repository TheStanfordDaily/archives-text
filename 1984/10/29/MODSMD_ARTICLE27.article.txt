# Women's cross country takes third league title
## 
### DARREN WOODRUFF Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's cross
country team left little doubt Satur
day as to who has the best team in the
West — and possibly the country.
The top seven finishes in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association
championships in Long Beach
belonged to Cardinal runners, giving
them their third straight WCAA con
ference title.
The second-ranked Cardinal wo
men finished the race Saturday with
15 points, outrunning second place

UCLA by 46 points. Arizona State
University finished third with 100
points.
"The fact that we ran well without
much rest looks good for the races
down the road," Coach Brooks
Johnson said, referring to the upcom
ing National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation district and national cham
pionships. Stanford has placed second
two straight years in the champion
ships and is preparing for a run at the
national title this year.
All-America senior Regina Jacobs
led the pack for Stanford, winning her

third straight race of the season.
Jacobs finished first with a time of 15
minutes 54.8 seconds, a new course
record for Long Beach's La Mirada
County park course.
Jacobs and All-America junior
Alison Wiley have been consistent
one-two finishers this season and
Wiley once again placed second with
a time of 16:14.2. Sophomore Cory
Schubert placed third with a time of
16:20.1.
"If we can get five people under 17
minutes in the nationals, we'll win by
30 points," Johnson predicted. All of
Stanford's runners Saturday finished
under 17 minutes. Freshmen Kathy
Smith and Christa Curtin, along with
seniors Ellin Lyons and Ceci Hopp
finished fourth through seventh to
complete the Cardinal sweep.
The Stanford team seems to be
coming together more effectively as a
unit as preparation for the national
championships increases. "Regina is
running very well," Johnson said.
"Ceci is coming around and doing a
pretty good job given the circum
stances (a nagging hip injury). As a
team they are performing up to their
potential.
"The difference between the men's
and women's teams is not that great.
The attitude is different." The men
will be running in the Pacific 10 Con
ference cross country championships
today at 11 a.m. at the Stanford Golf
Course.
Johnson expects the men's main
competition to come from the Uni
versity of Arizona, the University of
Oregon and UCLA. "We're a year or
so from becoming competitively ma
ture," he says.
The men's team finished 10th in
the Stanford Invitational Oct. 6 and
won the Cal/Nike Invitational Oct.
13.
The Cardinal's most consistent
runner has been Marc Oleson.
Oleson won the Cal/Nike Invitational
and has placed second in his other
two races.
"We're in pretty good shape from
the shoulders down," Johnson said.
"Anything can happen. It's a ques
tion of whether we're gonna compete
well. If you have success, have talent,
and get lucky, you'll win," Johnson
said in assessing the men's chances to
qualify for the national champion
ships.

Senior Ceci Hopp has had some trouble this season because of a recur
