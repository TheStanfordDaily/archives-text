### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team won an important Western Col
legiate Athletic Association match
Saturday evening by defeating
second-ranked USC, 15-2, 15-6, 9-
15, 15-6. The Cardinal is ranked No.
1 in this week's National Collegiate
Athletic Association poll and is in
first place in the WCAA with an 8-1
record. USC is now 5-3 in the
WCAA.
Stanford got its seventh conference
victory, 15-9, 15-10, 15-4, Friday
over Cal State Fullerton, which is in
last place in the WCAA. The Car
dinal has not lost a conference match

since Sept. 22, when it lost to USC at
Los Angeles.
The Cardinal's match against Cal
State Fullerton lacked the intensity
present in its match against USC. The
Titans have gone 0-23 in WCAA
matches in the past two years.
Friday's match also was not as
decisive as the difference in the
teams' standings might indicate. Stan
ford gave up 23 points to Cal State
Fullerton, only six fewer than the
Trojans scored. Fullerton was able to
gain several points on soft spikes
down the line or into the backcourt.
The Cardinal, accustomed to playing
at a faster pace, was caught off-guard
by the slower spikes. The Titans also

were three-for-four on dinks over
blocks and three-for-three on dumps.
Stanford made lineup changes for
the second game against the Titans.
Senior Lisa Murphy replaced mid
dleblocker Kim Oden, and freshman
hitter Teresa Smith came in and hit
aggressively for the Cardinal. In the
third game, Brooke Hahner, a 5-foot
-1 1 sophomore from Esperanza,
spiked well to gain Stanford's first
five points in the Cardinal's best
game of the match.
Kim Oden led Stanford with 12
kills even though she played half the
match. Susan Compton had 10 kills
and eight digs.

About 1,300 spectators came to
see Stanford's last home conference
match of this season, against USC.
The match proved to he worthy of the
teams' top rankings, but Stanford was
able to methodically win the match
with "consistent and organized" play,
according to Cardinal Asst. Coach
Don Shaw.
Stanford has had difficulty beating
USC in the past, having split its
matches against the Trojans over the
last two seasons.
"What we've missed in the past is
our outside hitting," Shaw said.
"Torrtght we had (Barbara) Fontana
and Compton hitting really well from
the outside. That, along with our
middle attack, made the difference."
An explanation for the hitters' suc
cess, according to Shaw, was the vari
ety of sets to different hitting posi
tions. "We were able to spread (our
hitting) around," he said. "We'd run
threes (balls that are set about three
feet over the net) and suck (move)
over the block, leaving the outside
open."
The Cardinal also went to setters
Wendi Rush and Deidra Dvorak on
several point-scoring opportunities.
According to Head Coach Fred
Sturm, Rush hits well in sideout situa
tions, whereas Dvorak is looked to as
a rally-ending hitter.
According to Rush, however,
Sturm did not go to his setters as
much as planned. "We were looking
for it to happen, but because (USC)
was keeping the block in the middle,
we put it outside instead," she said.
The Cardinal defense had a good
night as well. USC had difficulty get
ting quick sideouts because the Car
dinal consistently dug up the Trojans'
hardest spikes. "We were siding out
well tonight," Cardinal hitter Bobbie
Broer said. "Any team will get
frustrated when they can't get a
point."
Stanford's performance was crowd
pleasing. Fontana brought the home
crowd to its feet when she won the
first game with an untouched dink
over block by a USC player.
