# Quad renovation fuels emotions
## 
### AMY BIRD Staff writer 
The renovation of the Inner Quad is
nearing completion. Workers have only to lay
the remainder of the brick pavement and
landscape the planting circles.
But the air around the Quad is not entirely
free from conflict and controversy.
"It touches the heart of the University,"
said Max Mazenko of the Facilities Project
Management Office. "A job like this one is 90
percent emotion and only 10 percent analy
sis."
Mazenko said he had to resign himself early
on to the controversy he knew would accom
pany the project. "Opinions about what's
good for the Quad are highly subjective.
Resolution (of different opinions) is primarily
judgmental."
One area of concern centers on the Univer
sity's choice of architect for the renovation of
the Inner Quad. The University selected An
thony Guzzardo & Associates of San Fran
cisco to restore Frederick Law Olmsted's un
finished masterpiece.
Gerard Koskovich, a doctoral candidate in
art history at Stanford and an outspoken critic
of the changes that have been made to the In
ner Quad, voiced his opinion on the selection

process.
"It appears to me that the process by which
the architect was chosen was not open and was
not designed to employ the best possible ar
chitect, specifically one who would have had a
national reputation, extensive knowledge of
Olmsted's work and a sensitivity to the com
plexities of a landscape project of national im
portance such as this one."
Koskovich's criticism rides on the fact that
the anonymous donors of $1 million for the
project expressed a preference early on that
the University hire-Guzzardo to do the work
in the Inner Quad.
Planning Director Phil Williams acknowl
edged that the donors expressed an interest in
Guzzardo. "They were familiar with his work
and thought he was a competent consultant.
We informed the donors that we would take
that into consideration, which is exactly what
happened."
Mazenko said "it is not unheard of' for
donors to express similar preferences. "It
depends on the donors. Those who gave the
funds for the Inner Quad are particularly con
scious of landscape. They knew Tony Guz
zardo's work and had a lot of confidence in

him."
Both Williams and Mazenko said
the University did not view the pref

erence expressed by the donors as a
demand.
David Fulton, director of commu
nications for the Office of Develop
ment, said donors may express
preferences, but the University does
not allow donors to intervene in its
internal affairs.

Mazenko said, "It's difficult for
Stanford to receive gifts on a condi
tional basis, [but] we do pay very
close attention to donor
preferences."
The University gave the commis
sion to Guzzardo without interview
ing any other architect.

Mazenko said he could not specify
how the project might have differed
had the donors not expressed a pref
erence for a particular architect. "We
would have undertaken a broader
search for a designer, but the selec
tion process and criteria would not
have differed."
