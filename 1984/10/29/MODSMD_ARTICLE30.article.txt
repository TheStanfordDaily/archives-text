# Polo team beats Long Beach

### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
Led hy a well-balanced team scoring attack and several
fast breaks, the Stanford water polo team defeated Long
Beach State, 11-8, Friday afternoon at DeGuerre Pool.
According to coach Dante Dettamanti, the Cardinal
played best in the first half â€” when it mattered.
"We played super in the first quarter, scoring almost
every time we got the ball, " Dettamanti said. "We lost a
lot of our lead in the second half but, in the first half, when
the game was on the line, we came through and that's
what mattered."
The Cardinal, now 20-3 overall, took advantage of the
49ers' 5-6 situations. Stanford scored four out of five
times on 6-5 advantages and once on a 6-4. A 6-5 occurs

when one of the opponent's players is ejected from the
game for a designated amount of time because of fouls. In
this situation, the offense has one more player and can
therefore score more easily.
According to Dettamanti, the Cardinal lost its six-goal
lead in the fourth quarter due to poor consistency and the
play of its second- and third-team players.
"I wanted to let everyone play, and naturally, our
second and third strings don't play as well as our first
string," Dettamanti said. "We just were not controling the
ball enough, and the players were trying to score a few too
many times at the wrong times."
Stanford will host fourth-ranked USC Saturday at
DeGuerre Pool at noon.
