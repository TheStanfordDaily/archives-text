# SJ State beats hockey team; playoff hopes get dimmer

### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford field hockey team
had an offensive plan for its home
game against San Jose State Uni
versity Saturday, but Coach Onnie
Killefer said the scheme only
worked "fairly well" in the Car
dinal's 2-0 loss.
Stanford had planned to assign
some midfielders specific defensive
responsibilities to open scoring op
portunities for other midfielders.
"It worked fairly well," Killefer
said. "One player — Wanda Key —
had a tough assignment. She had to
mark (Ail-American) Jeannie Gil
bert, the highest (career) scorer at
San Jose. Jeannie touched the ball
twice but didn't score. It was a good
job."
The Cardinal's Karen Chamber
lain had to guard Yvon Hoogeveen.
"Karen did a good job. She
(Hoogeveen) only got one
breakaway." However, Hoogeveen
scored both of the Spartans' first
half goals. The first was on a direct
corner shot, and the second was on
a breakaway.
On offense, Stanford's "passing
wasn't quick or sharp enough con
sistently," Killefer said. San Jose
State outshot the Cardinal, 20-15.

"Their defense was fair, Killefer
said. "Their goalkeeper did a nice
job, but we didn't capitalize on the
shots we had. We had our
chances."
Killefer said on Saturday there
was "more balance than the other
games." San Jose defeated Stan
ford 10-3 on Sept. 22 and 3-1 on

Oct. 19 at the Cal Invitational in
Berkeley.
"I thought we played well," Kil
lefer said. "I think Yvon's too
good. She's it."
The Cardinal will play its final
regular-season game Wednesday at
the University of California at
Berkeley.
