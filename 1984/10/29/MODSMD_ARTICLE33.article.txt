# Penfors takes Volvo tourney

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Top
seeded defending NCAA men's
singles champion Mikael Pernfors of
Georgia overcame a second-set lapse
yesterday and defeated Todd
Witsken of the University of South
ern California in the finals of the
Volvo All-American Tennis Cham
pionships at UCLA.
The 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 victory was the
30th consecutive win in an intercol
legiate match for Pernfors, a native of
Sweden, and substantiated his
ranking as the top college player,
which he earned by winning the
NCAA men's singles last year as a
junior.
Witsken, seeded second in the
four-day tournament that brought to
gether the top 32 college tennis
players in the nation, lost for the
second consecutive year in the finals
of the All-American. Last year, he
had to settle for runner-up when he
broke his ankle late in the third set
against Fredrik Pahlett of Minnesota.
Although Pernfors was the top
seeded player in the tournament, he
had struggled to make it into the
finals. In both the quarterfinals and

semifinals, Pernfors had to rally from
one-set deficits in order to advance.
On Sunday, however, he came out
strong and took the first set behind a
confident serve, which had been mis
sing in earlier rounds.
"I played my best match of the
tournament and was extremely happy
with my serve today," said Pernfors,
21. "I didn't feel confident with it (his
serve) in earlier matches."
In the second set, however,
Witsken battled back to even the
match.
"In the second set I made some
good volleys," Witsken said. "His
serve wasn't quite as penetrating and
I took a few points."
Pernfors regained control with his
strong serve in the final set and won
the match played at the Los Angeles
Tennis Center.
The victory earned Pernfors a wild
card berth into the Volvo Hall Of
Fame tennis Championship in New
port, R. 1., in July and an invitation to
play an exhibition against one of the
top seeds at the Volvo Masters this
January at Madison Square Garden
in New York.
