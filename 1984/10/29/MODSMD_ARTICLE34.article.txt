### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Coming off a flat performance against St. Mary's Col
lege, the Stanford women's soccer team played more in
spired against the Western Region's fourth-ranked Santa
Clara Broncos to win, 4-3, in overtime.
The Broncos, 11-4-4 and ranked 20th in the nation
three weeks ago, played "a different team," according to
Stanford Head Coach Helen Keohane.
Stanford scored the only first-half goal with about seven
minutes remaining.
In the second half, the offensive tempo of the game in
creased considerably.
Stanford, who outshot Santa Clara, 21-11, made the
score 2-0 when a Bronco defender's attempt to clear a
cross sent in by Swan went into Santa Clara's goal.
Santa Clara battled back, however, taking advantage of

a momentarily lax Stanford defense that allowed a Bronco
forward to break loose and score to cut the Cardinal's lead
to 2-1.
About five minutes later, Santa Clara tied the game, 2-
2, benefiting from a mix-up between the Cardinal defense
and Stanford goalkeeper Helen Norton.
"They were pressing. Our fullback beat their forward to
the ball." Norton said. "1 was drifting right. She went
left. ... It was a miscommunication."
Sophomore midfielder Amy Geisse kicked in a rebound
off a shot by Moore to put Stanford back on top, 3-2.
Once again, Santa Clara fought back. With about five
minutes remaining, midfielder Karie Fuchslin scored
The two teams continued their strong offensive efforts,
trading missed scoring opportunities until Moore, who
later said she was "hungry for a goal," scored what proved
to be the winning goal.
