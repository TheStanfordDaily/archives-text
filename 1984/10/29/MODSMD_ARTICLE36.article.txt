### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's golf team
travels to Sacramento today for the
54-hole, three-day Western Intercol
legiate Invitational at the Rancho
Murieta Country Club.
The Western Intercollegiate is only
the second tournament for the Car
dinal women in the fall season. Stan
ford is coming off last week's fourth
place finish at the Nancy Lopez Invi
tational in Tulsa, Okla.
Stanford will be led in by junior
Kathy Kostas, who finished in a first
place tie for the individual champion
ship in Tulsa. Afterward, Cardinal
Coach Tim Baldwin said Kostas' ef

fort was "Kathy's best performance
at Stanford."
Besides Kostas, the Cardinal team
includes sophomore Kathy
McCarthy, freshman Kay Cornelius,
junior Julie Carmichael and junior
Kerry Dubinsky. After the Nancy
Lopez Invitational, Baldwin said this
year's team will be strong once the
lineup becomes clear.
"I strongly feel that after the first
of the year, when our lineup is
solidified, that we will be competitive
with [the] top teams," he said.
The women will have the opportu
nity today to begin to meet those ex
pectations.
