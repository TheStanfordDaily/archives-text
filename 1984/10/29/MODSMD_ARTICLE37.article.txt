# Student dies on climbing trip
## 
### 
Stanford sophomore Thomas Apel died of ex
posure yesterday morning on a climbing trip in
Yosemite National Park. He was 19.
Apel had been climbing with David Dryden, a
sophomore at the University of California at
Berkeley, when the two became stranded on a
cliff face as darkness set in. Without adequate
clothing, the two spent the night on the face in
bitter cold and damp weather.
Apel and Dryden arrived in Yosemite
Thursday, according to park service officials. On
Saturday, the two left the rim of Yosemite Valley
to climb Lone Arrow Spire, a 250-foot-high
granite thumb that juts from the cliff face just
east of Upper Yosemite Falls.
The climb required two stages, according to
Park Ranger Mallory Smith. Apel and Dryden
reportedly completed the descent from the rim to
cliff wall by 10a.m., then spent the rest of the day
scaling the spire, reaching the summit at sunset.
Both climbs required technical equipment.
The two had attached a rope to the rim oppo
site the top of the spire and were planning to
make the return trip using a Tyrolean traverse.

Mallory said. To execute this traverse, the clim
ber must maneuver from point to point while
suspended in mid-air. Apel and Dryden had ap
parently set up the traverse but dropped part of
the device that attaches the person to the rope,
Mallory said. As it became dark, the two decided
to stay on the spire summit until morning.
"They were both cold and tired," Mallory said.
Neither Apel nor Dryden had overnight gear
or heavy jackets; Apel was reportedly wearing
corduroy pants and an overshirt. The tempera
ture in Yosemite Valley fell to 31 degrees. The
spire is located 3,000 feet above the valley floor,
and rangers said the temperature on the top was
about 20 degrees without the wind chill factor.
"It was windy and damp up there," Mallory said.
The summit itself is sloping, narrow and
exposed. "You could fit about six to eight people
up there comfortably if they were all clipped in,"
Mallory said.
"By Sunday morning, [Apel] was entering a
serious stage of hypothermia," she said. Dryden
apparently made the traverse back to the rim and
started down the valley for help. He met two

other hikers and told them to make the trip out to
the spire. At least one of the hikers brought a
sleeping bag to Apel and attempted to keep him
warm.
"There's no way to know if he was alive by
then," Mallory >aid.
Meanwhile, Dryden reached the ranger sta
tion, a hike of about four miles. Rangers dis
patched a helicopter to the spire, and a ranger
"helirappeled" onto the summit. Apel was then
strapped to a sling and lowered on a rope
beneath the helicopter to the park clinic on the
valley floor. He was pronounced dead on arrival
at 1 p.m.
A graduate of John Muir High School in
Pasadena, Apel was a resident of Storey House.
He is survived by his parents. Other survivors
were not notified of the incident until after 6:30
last night and could not be contacted at press
time.
The family has said it will not hold a funeral.
Students are planning a memorial service here,
with the time and place to be announced. For in
