This week The Daily looks at five of the
key constitutional amendments on the Cali
fornia ballot in next week's general election.
Today: reapportionment. Tomorrow: state
lottery.

Proposition 39 may not be a central
election issue for most students, but "to
the people in politics, it is the most serious
and important matter that you can possibly
imagine," according to California Institute
of Technology Prof. Bruce Cain, a noted
authority on reapportionment.
Proposition 39, a state constitutional
amendment placed on the ballot by peti
tion, is a proposed solution to the decen
nial controversy of how California will be
apportioned. Only four years have passed
since the last census, and the state
legislature has already been forced to
create two separate reapportionment
plans. Propostion 39 would require a third

plan.
To end the quarreling and the confusion
of shifting boundaries, Proposition 39
proposes taking the power of drawing
these boundaries away from the state
legislature and giving it to an independent
commission.

Apportionment establishes bound
aries for California's congressional dis
tricts, State Assembly districts, State Sen
ate districts and Board of Equalization dis
tricts.

The eight commission members would
be randomly chosen by the president of the
University of California from two lists of
retired appellate court judges. Each
retired judge would be placed on a list ac
cording to the party affiliation of the
governor who appointed him or her, and
only judges who had never served in either
the state legislature or Congress would be
eligible.
The biggest advantage to adopting the
proposal, claim Prop 39's backers, is that it
would make redistricting non-partisan.
Both opponents and proponents of the
proposition agree that redistricting is cur
rently a partisan process.
"Right now, politicians totally control it
(redistricting)," said Jim Bourgart, admin
istrative assistant to State Assemblyman
Robert Naylor (R â€” San Mateo). By con
trast, the commission's members "would
be people appointed 10 to 20 years ago by
a long forgotten governor who have ended

their judicial and political careers," he
said.
But the real issue in reapportionment is
not so much partisanship as fairness, ac
cording to Cain, author of the book "The
Reapportionment Puzzle."
Cain said that discrimination in reappor
tionment is sometimes a conscious act and
sometimes the result of insensitivity.
Initially, most of the commission's mem
bers would be white males in their 70s, ac
cording to both proponents and opponents
of the measure. Eventually, more women
and minorities will be appointed to the ap
pellate bench, but there's "always going to
be someone at the bottom of the political
scale," Cain said.
"Concern [for political minorities] is not
built in the commission," he said. For ex
ample, by the time women are involved,
