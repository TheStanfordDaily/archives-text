As students and corporations flock to the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, administrators there are
beginning to realize that arranging job interviews for stu
dents may not be as difficult as finding a location to hold
these interviews.
CPPC Director Chris Shinkman said all available inter
view space is booked for the rest of the year.
1 "We have been scurrying for space on campus," said
Shinkman. "We've come pretty close to turning people
away."
As space at the CPPC office behind the bell tower has
become more limited, Shinkman said that he has had to
borrow rooms from the Graduate School of Business, the
School of Engineering, Tresidder and the Chemistry De
partment.
"We hope to resolve the problem by getting coopera
tion from the University," Shinkman said.
He said he is also looking toward the $339,000 expan
sion of the CPPC building to "alleviate a real bad space
problem."
Currently there are 11 interview rooms available for 13
30-minute interviews each day. The expansion, however,
will cater to facilities other than interview space.
"The primary use (for the new addition) will be a career
resource library," Shinkman said. "Stage two of the pro
ject will be to rework the existing space." He speculated
that that a restructing of the current building's interior
might provide one or two additional rooms.
Though Stanford has always attracted an abundance of
on-campus interviews, Shinkman said this year is better
than usual. He attributes that to the steady growth of the
economy.
"With the economic upturn, more companies can
predict ahead what their hiring needs are going to be,"
Shinkman said.
He added that though demand for all types of jobs is up,
there are still three times as many technical-based inter
views than liberal arts ones.
There are still "more interviews (for engineers) than
people who want to take them," said Shinkman, and com
petition for interviews with banks, insurance companies
and retail firms remains keen.
To deal with this problem, a bidding system was in
stituted about three years ago in which students receive an
equal number of points that they can then use to bid for an
interview with an employer. The top 13 bidders are
awarded the 30-minute interviews.
"It is working very well," Shinkman said. "Students are
making their own decisions and employers like it too.
People who choose them (employers) really want to see
them; it cuts down on shoppers."
But with approximately 450 companies recruiting here
each year, there are bound to be problems and sacrifices.
"I turned my office over to the First Boston Corpora
tion" in order to squeeze them into the interview
schedule, Shinkman said.
Nonetheless, he admitted laughingly, "It's a nice prob
lem to have. I hope it goes on."
