Rocket bomb hits bus in Jerusalem
JERUSALEM — An anti-tank rocket blasted through a bus crammed
with about 40 Palestinians yesterday, killing one young man and injuring
10 people. Police found a note written in Hebrew next to the missile
launcher, threatening more attacks.
The note said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of two Israeli
students last week. A Palestinian from the West Bank has been charged
in those deaths.
Police raced up a hill overlooking a road outside the Old City walls
and found the note in trampled shrubbery, said Yossi Yehudai,
Jerusalem's deputy police commander. Next to it was a long, green,
missile-launching tube.
According to a police announcement, the note said: "This is in
revenge for the murder of the students near the Cremisan monastery."
It referred to the Oct. 22 killing of two Israelis near the monastery in
Beit Jalla, five miles south of Jerusalem. A resident of the nearby Dheishe
refugee camp, Issa Nimer Abd-Rabu, was accused of blindfolding the
students and shooting them in the head. Police allege he killed the two as
part of his initiation into a Palestinian guerrilla group.
Police Minister Haim Bar-Leve said in an Israel Radio interview that
the note from the hilltop attackers "announced that they are acting be
cause the Israeli government is not using the death penalty against ter
rorist murderers, and that they will stop if the government decides on the
death penalty."
He described them as a "group, whose size is not yet known, of people
taking the law into their own hands out of racist and nationalistic
motives, extremists who are willing to injure the innocent."
Mondale caps California campaign
SAN JOSE — Dismissing his standing in public opinion polls, Walter
Mondale wound up a weekend of politicking in Northern California yes
terday by assuring an enthusiastic crowd of supporters: "Polls don't
vote. People vote."
Speaking before a largely Hispanic audience of about 2,500 at Inde
pendence High School, where Latin dancers added to the buoyant
mood, Mondale proudly predicted, "When you vote, we're going to win
this election."
He criticized President Reagan on a variety of issues — from arms
control and Social Security to civil rights and taxes — while stressing his
own concern for the middle class.
"In California, don't you know about Ronald Reagan?" he said. "Do
you believe he's going to stand up for people of middle or moderate
incomes?"
"No," the crowd roared.
Mondale repeated assertions that Reagan "can't keep his hands off'
Social Security and Medicare. On the arms race, the Democratic
presidential hopeful said, "If we don't destroy these goddarned weap
ons, they're going to destroy us all."
Despite recent reports that the uphill battle Moridale faces is getting
tougher, the crowd was spirited and optimistic.
"We're hoping that the polls are wrong," said Yolanda Giuffrida of
San Jose. "They weren't right with Dewey and Truman," added her hus
band, Angelo.
"The only poll that counts is election day," agreed Terry Christensen,
40, also of San Jose.
Crime ring busted in L.A.
LOS ANGELES — A bid by organized crime members to take over
$1 million-a-week bookmaking operations here was cut short yesterday
with the arrests of 20 people, including the reputed crime boss of South
ern California, police said.
Among those arrested was Peter John Milano, "considered to be the
head of organized crime" in Southern California, police Chief Daryl
Gates said.
The investigation — dubbed "Operation Lightweight" — began in the
spring, was put on hold during the Summer Olympics and resumed im
mediately afterward. Gates told a news conference.
"We feel the name is appropriate because organized crime is such a
lightweight in Southern California," said Gates, who referred to South
ern California crime families as "the Mickey Mouse Mafia."
The arrest warrants charged the 20 with conspiracy to commit book
making.
"The investigation identified eight bookmakers who were being
squeezed for either money or a percentage of their operation," Gates
said. But he said no violence took place before officers intervened.
Although Gates identified several of those arrested as associates of
crime families in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Florida, he said the
effort to take over the bookmaking was not controlled by those families.
"We have a very disjointed organized crime effort in Los Angeles.
You find them (organized crime figures) coming together from many
different families," Gates said.
Heavy fighting in El Salvador
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador— Heavy fighting between hundreds
of government troopers and leftist rebels raged for 30 hours on the
slopes of San Vicente Volcano before ending yesterday, the military
said.
Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador said the
five-year civil war has intensified since the first peace talks were held be
tween the government and insurgents two weeks ago.
An army officer in Zacatecoluca, the army operations base in the San
Vicente region, said 11 soldiers were killed and six were wounded, in
cluding two officers, in the fighting that began Saturday. The officer,
who spoke on condition he not be identified, said guerrilla casualties
were not known.
He also said the fighting had ended by 1 p.m. EST and that at least 17
soldiers were unaccounted for and may have been captured by the guer
rillas.
Fighting on the slopes of the 6,600-foot volcano, 30 miles east of San
Salvador, began when rebels detonated a mine near a government patrol
at EI Salto on Saturday, killing one soldier and wounding another, mili
tary officials said.
Army officers in Zacatecoluca, south of the volcano, said the rebels
then attacked a 25-man army base at El Salto and the military sent in
reinforcements to try to trap the guerrillas.
Radio Farabundo Marti, the guerrilas' clandestine station, said Sun
day that three U.S.-built A-37 attack planes bombed villages near Ar
catao, 69 miles north of the capital near the Honduran border, on Satur
day.
CIA handbook from Army manual
WASHINGTON — The text of a CIA-produced guerrilla handbook
urging Nicaraguan rebels to "neutralize" government officials came
straight from a 1968 U.S. Army training manual, a member of the Sen- ■
ate Intelligence Committee revealed yesterday.
"It is a word-for-word translation of the lesson plan on psychological
operations that was prepared at the Army Special Operations School in
Ft. Bragg, N.C., in April 1968," Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-
N.Y.), said.
Moynihan said the committee's investigation of the text and its origin
made it clear that the word "neutralize" means to assassinate.
But he was disputed on that point by the chairman of the intelligence
panel, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz). "I don't see anything to get all
excited about," Goldwater said. "Neutralize is a very broad word."
Both senators were interviewed on ABC-TV's "This Week with
David Brinkley."
The furor over the manual has split the Senate committee, which once
prized its bipartisan spirit, along party lines. Moynihan and other
Democrats argue that the handbook, which was printed and distributed
by the CIA last year, violates a presidential ban on assassination as a tool
of U.S. policy. Goldwater and other Republicans on the panel have
adopted the ClA's argument that the word "neutralize" could mean any
number of things.
