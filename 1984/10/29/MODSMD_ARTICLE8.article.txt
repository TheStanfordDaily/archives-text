# OPEC faces internal stress
## 
### 
GENEVA, Switzerland â€” On the eve of a criti
cal meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries, Nigerian Oil Minister
lamunoemi David-West said yesterday that his
country would not consent to any cuts in produc
tion in order to shore up sagging world oil prices.
David-West also said that Nigeria, which broke
the cartel's ranks by dropping its oil price by $2 per
barrel to keep pace with non-OPEC members Brit
ain and Norway, would not rescind its price cut and
"could not give any deadline" when it might rejoin
OPEC's pricing structure.
Underscoring growing tensions within the 13-
nation cartel. Oil Minister Mana Said Oteiba of the
United Arab Emirates indicated that unless price
differentials for the various grades of OPEC crude
were adjusted satisfactorily, he would cut the price
of Emirates oil.
The mood of intransigence appeared to portend
the most serious difficulties in the 24-year history
of the cartel.
A four-member market monitoring group is ex
pected to recommend that OPEC impose new
quotas slashing production, perhaps by 3 million
barrels, to soak up a persistent global glut and
defend OPEC's benchmark price of $29 a barrel.
Last week Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani of
Saudi Arabi said OPECs strategy was to avoid any
further drop in price, and to correct downward
market forces by securing agreement on lower pro
duction quotas. He said he expected demand to
pick up with the onset of winter, thus easing the
current crisis.
But there is still no sign that OPEC is prepared
to reach quick agreement today on how to appor
tion the burden of production cuts among its rich
and poor members.
David-West insisted at a press conference here
that asking Nigeria to cut production by even one
barrel would be suicidal."
Surging oil production by non-OPEC members
has cut the cartel's share of the world market nearly
in half over the past five years. The steady loss of

customers has squeezed several OPEC members,
such as Nigeria and Indonesia, at a time when they
need more income to cope with heavy debt bur
dens.
Since oil is traded in dollars, the high value of the
U.S. currency has forced many customers, espe
cially in Europe, to cut back further on oil pur
chases, thus exacerbating the surplus.
Another factor is that many firms retooled
refineries at a cost of billions of dollars to switch
from light to heavy crude oil, which is cheaper by
several dollars a barrel. But the rising demand for
heavy crude has begun to warp the OPEC pricing
system, which still sets a premium on light oil.
The growing controversy over OPECs price dif
ferentials between heavy and light crude poses a
fundamental threat to the structure of the cartel,
which is why many countries have cautioned
against any substantial changes.
Most OPEC oil ministers gathering here have
said they would prefer to deal with the delicate
issue of differentials at the next regular meeting
here in December.
But Oteiba, the United Arab Emirates oil mini
ster and the head of the market monitoring com
mittee, said in an NBC television interview, "If no
solution is found here, then I will solve the issue
myself when I go back home," implying that he
would unilaterally cut the price of U.A.E. oil if no
adjustment was agreed.
The booming production of non-OPEC
countries, though, remains the most serious exter
nal threat to the cartel's power. The Soviet Union,
Mexico, Norway, Britain, Egypt and China have
become increasingly important forces in the world
oil market.
After its last meeting in Vienna this summer,
OPEC agreed to dispatch a series of diplomatic
missions to these countries soliciting greater
cooperation in managing the world market.
They achieved only limited success, largely be
cause the other oil producers are no longer con
vinced of OPEC's ability to act as a unified market

force.
OPEC officials fear that any further price reduc
tion, only 18 months after the cartel agreed in Lon
don to its first price cut of $5 a barrel, would be
perceived on the world market as a sign of weak
ness that could trigger a further slide in prices.
Because of the current state of the oil market,
many OPEC members have felt compelled to
"cheat" on prices to keep customers, by offering
secret discounts, deferred payment or barter ar
rangements.
Even Saudi Arabia, which as the swing producer
is supposed to police the market by adjusting its
output to ensure price stability, infuriated its
partners this summer by swapping millions of bar
rels of oil for Boeing 747 jumbo jets.
The erosion of the cartel's discipline has become
self-perpetuating. David-West yesterday implied
that Nigeria chose to go its own way in cutting its
prices recently because of such cheating, which he
diplomatically described as "mistakes" committed
by other producers.
As one of OPECs most populous and financially
troubled members, Nigeria has no room to make
further sacrifice, David-West said. The new mili
tary government, he added, could not be held ac
countable for the corruption and blunders of the
past.
He said there was "a very vocal minority" in the
country that was politically opposed to OPEC and
warned that its influence would magnify if fellow
OPEC members did not help.
David-West said Nigeria had no choice but to
follow Norway and Britain after they cut the prices
two weeks ago. When asked why he could not wait
for a full OPEC session to decide, David-West said
it would have been like asking "Nigeria's heart to
stop" for more than a week.
"Oil is the life of Nigeria," he said. "We could
not wait more than 72 hours. We had to act to
assure Nigerians we are a sovereign government."
