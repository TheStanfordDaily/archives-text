# Peres requests aid in pullout
## Israel asks the U.S. to help 
### 
JERUSALEM â€” Israel appealed
to the United States yesterday for
help in reaching a Lebanon troop
withdrawal agreement with Syria and
also called for a broader role for the
United Nations in securing peace
along the Israel-Lebanon border.
A statement issued after a policy
review by Prime Minister Shimon
Peres' Cabinet said Israel will con
tinue efforts "for reaching an agree
ment (with Syria) through the good
offices of the United States."
At the same time, the statement
called for talks between Israeli and
Lebanese military officers, under
U.N. auspices, to arrange security for
Israel's northern border once Israel's
troops pull out of southern Lebanon.

Cabinet sources, who spoke on
condition they not be identified, said
a partial withdrawal which Peres has
mentioned publicly did not come up
yesterday.
Peres suggested this month that if
an agreement could not be reached
with Syria to pull Syrian troops out of
Lebanon or to control its Palestinian
and Lebanese militia allies, then Is
raeli troops who are withdrawn from
the border area could be redeployed
against Syrian positions in Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley.
Yesterday, Cabinet Secretary Yossi
Beilin said, "No redeployment was
discussed."
U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz has said Washington was ready

to be "as helpful as we can" in build
ing conditions for Israel to withdraw
from southern Lebanon, which it
invaded in June 1982 to stop cross
border attacks by Palestinian guerril
las.
But informed Western sources said
the U.S. administration does not
believe the countries involved were
ready for a full-scale mediation effort
at this point. Syrian officials have
refused to discuss a withdrawal of
their troops, which entered Lebanon
in 1976.
Richard Murphy, the U.S. assistant
secretary of state, was due back in the
Middle East this week for exploratory
talks described by Western
diplomatic sources as "poking, prod

ding and probing."
The Cabinet review produced no
apparent change in Israel's approach.
But Cabinet officials said some minis
ters opposed a U.N. role in negotiat
ing with Lebanon, and their objec
tions were overruled by the final deci
sion.
The officials said that procedural
problems remained in starting talks
with Lebanon. They said Israel
refuses Lebanon's demand to bargain
in the framework of the 1949 Israel-
Lebanon armistice agreement be
cause it considered the armistice
abrogated when Lebanon declared
war on Israel in 1967.
