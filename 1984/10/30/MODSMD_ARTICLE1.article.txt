Balloting begins today and continues until Wednesday
in ASSU s Special Election, but many students may be
unaware that the vote is taking place.
The election, originally called only to fill graduate
senator seats in the senate, now includes a presidential
preference poll and a referendum on the University's in
vestment policies in South Africa. Also on the ballot is
another referendum question and eight proposed amend
ments to the ASSU Constitution.
A random but unscientific sample of students last
night found widespread ignorance and little interest con
cerning the election.
Junior Stephanie Brown, one of the few students con
tacted who was aware of the election, was not enthusiastic
about the polling. "I don't care if ASSU senators get flicks
passes, and I care even less if they amend their constitu
tion," she said.
Brown was referring to a bill proposed by Senator Mark
Soble at the senate's last meeting which would have re
quired senators to turn in their complimentary Sunday
Flicks passes. Soble claimed that the free passes fostered
"the image that the ASSU ... is an elitist club living in the
lap of luxury."
Of the two referendums on the ballot, the one concern
ing the University's investment policies in South Africa
calls on the University to sell its stock in Motorola Corp.
and adopt standards to govern its investment policies. The
other calls for the Committee of Fifteen to be convened so
that amendments to the ASSU Legislative and Judicial
Charter can be considered.
Of the eight amendments to the constitution to be voted
on, two of them deal with the finances of the ASSU. One
allows the senate to divide fee requests by student groups
into two parts. Another would establish a mechanism for
the senate to tax students over a period of years for capital
improvements in ASSU facilities.
Three amendments alter the operating procedures of
the senate. Amendment Two would allow a Council of
Presidents veto to be overridden by the senate only with a
two-thirds vote. Currently, a simple majority can override
a veto. Amendment One would loosen the senate's re
strictions on when an alternate graduate senator may
vote. Another amendment makes minor alterations in the
senate's nominations commission.
The remaining three amendments make technical cor
rections to the constitution.
hour candidates are running for the eight open graduate
senator slots. The district including the schools of earth
sciences, humanities and sciences, and education have one
candidate running for three seats. In the election district
comprised of the business, law and medical schools, no
one is running for the four open spots. Only in the engi
neering school, where three candidates are vying for one
seat, will there be competition.
Chris Reed, elections commissioner, expects the
remaining seats to be filled by write-ins.
Reed says she expects to release the election results
sometime Thursday.
Polling sites will include the post office (9 a.m.- 5 p.m.),
Meyer Library (7-12 p.m.), Green Library (7-11 p.m.),
the Engineering Corner (9 a.m.- 5 p.m.), the business
school (11 a.m.- 2 p.m.), the west end of the Quad (9
a.m.- 5 p.m.), the medical school (11 a.m.- 2 p.m.) and
Terman Library (9 a.m.- 5 p.m.).
