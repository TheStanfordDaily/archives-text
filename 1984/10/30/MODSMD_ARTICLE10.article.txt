## Student volunteers reach out, respond to community needs 
### JENNIFER JENKINS 
In his June Commencement speech,
University President Donald Ken
nedy praised public service, saying
that "The reward is not merely the
sense of fulfillment; it is nothing less
than the infusion of meaning into
one's life."
It was on this theme that the Stan
ford Volunteer Network's Reach Out
Today program was planned. An esti
mated 350-400 student volunteers
worked at various projects to make
the day, according to organizers, a
huge success.

This was the first time such a day
has been attempted, but because of
the number of students involved, or
ganizers predicted that there may be
another in sight.
About twenty projects were sched
uled by the different student
residences on campus. These ran the
gamut from hosting Halloween par
ties at the Veterans Administration
Hospitals, planting trees for the Sem
pervirens Fund, painting and
renovating buildings at the Commu
nity Association for the Retarded,
and gardening at Stevenson House, a

center for the elderly.
Students seemed to be delighted
with the programs, and their
responses were enthusiastic.
"Everybody had a really good time,"
said Dave Ellison, a resident assistant
at Rinconada, regarding the Big
Brothers-Big Sisters day at Wilbur
Field. Projects there included
pumpkin carving, a scavenger hunt
and a soccer game.
A postive feeling seemed to prevail
at the reception at Owen House fol
lowing the day's activities. "It was

really great, really fun," students
said.
"It went well, the patients were
glad to have us there," Mike Heller,
project coordinator for the Sharon
Heights Convalescent Hospital group
said. "Some people didn't want to
leave."
Nevida Butler, one of the directors
of the Ecumenical Hunger Program
(EHP), had nothing but praise for the
volunteers. The main project there
was cleaning up the house and yard of
Ruby Lee Scott of East Palo Alto.
The 71-year-old woman, who
recently suffered a stroke and a bro
ken arm, said " I couldn't do any
thing. I needed help."
Around thirty volunteers were
present at Scott's house. Students
cleared brambles and garbage, as well
as cleaning up the house.
"Nobody here would believe that
Stanford students would do this,"
Butler said, adding that Stanford is a
major source of volunteers for their
program.
Peter Spivack, director of the Stan
ford Volunteer Network, stressed the
importance of getting involved in
public service projects. "This campus
is self-enclosed, and this program
should make students realize that
there are other things out there
besides money, status and careers. It
will give them a chance to see how
other people live and the factors they
face."
He also said that "volunteer work
is fun, and it is easy to get involved."
He added that he hopes once students
"get a taste for it," they will want to
try it again.
Walter Sosnowski, project coordin
ator for EHP, said, "It was a good
learning experience for us; a chance
to be reminded of what our values
should be. It gave everyone the op
portunity to contribute time in a use
ful way.
"We debate politically about
spending money for the poor, but
when the individual opportunity
arises, few actually give their time to
help," he said.
The main goal of Reach Out
Today, according to Spivack, was to
have students become interested in

public service on a regular basis.
Based on student responses, this goal
seems to have been met. "A few of our
people became attached to the pa
tients (they worked with)," Heller
said.
Kim Thomason, of Big Brothers-
Big Sisters agreed. "A lot of us made
plans to do something with the kids
next week," she said.
"It (Reach Out Today) had a really
positive influence," said Therese
McCarthy, project coordinator for

the Veterans Hospital in Menlo Park.
"There were plenty of opportunities
to go back; they need volunteers."
She said, "I think this project
helped whet our appetite for commu
nity service. A lot of people are going
back."
Spivack was pleased at how the
program turned out. "It went very
smoothly," he commented.
"And there seems to be an interest
to do it again. I'm very satisfied."
