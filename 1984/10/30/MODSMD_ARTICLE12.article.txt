## The 						Stanford Daily Fritz Mondale in '84 
### 
A president must lead. He must be in com
mand. He must know the facts. He can't be afraid
to take those bold steps that make this nation
stronger not just for the moment, but over the
long haul.
Walter Mondale is that leader, and he's ready
to move.
Waving the flag is all well and good, but we
can't keep our competitive edge without educat
ing our people. Mondale understands this. In the
Senate and in the White House, he pushed for
what he calls the "Magna Carta of American
Education": Title I aid for disadvantaged stu
dents, Head Start, student assistance, handi
capped education and expanded vocational edu
cation.
In January we'll be ready to move again, with
Mondale's Fund for Excellence to help commun
ities strengthen their own academic programs.
We'll bring federal support back to the class
rooms and laboratories. It's time to make sure
public schools get what they need. It's time to
make sure families can send their kids to college.
Cranking up the economy to a feverish election
year pitch may get you votes, but bottomless
federal deficits amount to nothing less than sel
ling out our nation's future. Mondale realizes
this. He knows that you don't reward the world's
most productive farmers by forcing them out of
business. He knows that you don't reward our
retiring workforce by trashing Social Security.
Mondale will help our people help themselves,
and he'll slash those deficits by two-thirds in the
next four years. It won't be easy, and we'll all
have to pay. But in the long run, the only way to
protect freedom is to make certain our economic
recovery is fair for all Americans.
Talking about arms control is certainly fash
ionable, but we can't start reducing weapons un
til we talk with Soviet leaders and find some com
mon ground. Mondale recognizes this. He knows
the Soviets are dangerous. He knows we've got to
watch them every minute. But he also knows we

have to do away with nuclear weapons before we
do away with each other.
We can verify a freeze on the testing and
deployment of selected systems: It's time we did.
President Mondale will take such a step, and he'll
follow up on it by inviting the Soviet leadership to
meet him in Geneva for substantive negotiations
to freeze the arms race on earth and in space. To
keep us strong, a Mondale administration will
work to ensure that our conventional forces are
better equipped, better supplied and better
trained.
It's a lot of fun to blame pollution on trees, but
you can't take care of the environment by gutting
the Environmental Protection Agency and selling
our children's domains to the highest bidder.
Mondale knows this. He's ready to use the Super
fund for its mandated purpose — to clean up
toxic wastes. He knows that to control acid rain
you've got to treat it as the national problem it is,
and you've got to cut it off at the source.
It's one thing to say that America is the land of
opportunity, and another thing to make sure it
happens. As attorney general of Minnesota,
Mondale organized the first civil rights
demonstration in the state's history. As presi
dent, he won't lend a helping hand to segregated
private academies like Bob Jones University. He
will push for integrated schools and fair housing.
During the course of the campaign Mondale's
running mate, Geraldine Ferraro, has proven
herself a competent and capable leader.
Mondale's choice of a woman as a candidate for
our nation's second-highest office was an impor
tant progressive move representative of his com
mitment to equality and strong leadership.
This country can never afford to rest on its
laurels. If we want to be better — and we do — if
we want to compete — and we will — we've got
to approach the world the way it is and make our
future what we want it to be.
Mondale understands this, and he stands for
what's best in this nation.
