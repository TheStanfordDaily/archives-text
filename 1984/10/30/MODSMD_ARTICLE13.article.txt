# Reagan? Thank you, no
## 
### 
Walter Mondale's qualifications aside, possibly
the single best reason for voting the Democratic
ticket next week is Mondale's opponent.
On almost every conceivable issue, President
Reagan has an abominable record:
• The budget: Reagan came into office in 1981
promising to balance the federal budget in his first
term. Instead, he has increased the national debt
to astronomical levels and, further, has no realistic
plan of curbing the problem.
• Defense spending: Reagan promised America a
strong defense. Instead, he has delivered an ex
pensive defense. Reagan recommissioned aging
battleships — vessels that the Falklands' War
taught us are sitting ducks in a modern conflict —
at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. He has
introduced tanks that need refueling every few
miles. He has revived a bomber that will become
obsolete before it is deployed.
• Social spending: Here, Reagan has been heart
less in addition to being merely incompetent. In
his first round of budget cuts, Reagan went after
social programs with a vengeance. While claiming
to protect the "truly needy," Reagan raised the
poverty level to its highest mark since the Depres
sion. And when his proposed cuts in Social Secur
ity were rebuffed by Congress, Reagan lied to the
American public and claimed he never tried to
touch the program.
• Education: Reagan cut federal loans to college
students and eliminated the Department of Edu
cation. But he says education is a high priority in
his administration. And to prove it, he decided to
send a schoolteacher into space on a shuttle mis
sion.
• Church-state: In the 1980 campaign, Reagan
said he wanted to get the government "off the
backs" of the people. Instead, he has led the gov
ernment on a crusade into areas of personal
morality and choice.
Reagan has pushed state-written prayer in
public schools, backed a "squeal rule" for
teenagers using public birth-control clinics and
supported efforts to make abortion illegal.
In addition, the Republican platform advocates
a "litmus test" for potential Supreme Court justices
that would eliminate candidates who are pro
choice, a frightening prospect with both immedi
ate and long-term implications for the Court.
• Civil rights: The Reagan administration has
opposed a renewal of the Civil Rights Act and

continues its fight against the Equal Rights
Amendment. These two actions best exemplify an
administration notoriously insensitive to
minorities' and women's issues.
• Arms control: Reagan has deployed the Persh
ing 2 and pushed for, among others, the MX
missile, the Trident 111 submarine with D-5
missiles, and a "Star Wars" anti-ballistic missile
system. All expensive, all seen by the Soviets as
first-strike systems. All destabilizing.
Actor, governor, candidate and now President
Reagan has opposed every arms treaty made with
the Soviet Union. His inability to sign any arms
control agreement with the Soviets in the last four
years — the first American president since the
dawn of the nuclear age to win that distinction —
should surprise no one.
• The environment: Most of Reagan's policies
have resulted in effects that, though severely
damaging, can be undone. Reagan's effect on the
environment, however, has been irreparable. In
addition to rolling back years of legislation on air
and water pollution standards, Reagan has en
couraged, through former Interior Secretary
James Watt, the wholesale exploitation of the
American wilderness.
Rather than protecting pristine areas, Watt auc
tioned off vast regions of mountains, coastline and
forests for marginal returns to energy and timber
companies.
But there is much more wrong with Reagan
than his positions on issues indicate. His foreign
policy is irresponsible — witness Central America
and Grenada — as well as bumbling: See
Lebanon.
There is no denying that Reagan is this
country's most popular president in two decades.
But there is a difference between a good leader —
a visionary who boldly leads his people over diffi
cult obstacles — and an amiable buffoon who can
deliver his lines in a deep, grandfatherly voice.
There is much that is wanting in Mondale — his
Central America policy, for example. But when
compared with Reagan, Mondale can be des
cribed only in superlatives.
Reagan keeps wandering back to the very worst
of the "good old days," to an age of of open
racism, accepted sexism and a high standard of
living — for white males only. Thaf s not where
this country should be going. We need a leader,
not a demagogue.
