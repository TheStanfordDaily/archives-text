## Getting all gummed up 
### 
My fellow Americans, bubblegum blights our
brown earth. It shall destroy the United States and,
perhaps, the world, unless we heed popular cries
and crush the evil empire. Bubblegum is not rather
sophisticated like English toffee or American
turkeys. No, indeed, it is not. It is insidious, gro
tesque and bovine. Ignorant masses chew and chew
like cows on their cud, while Red Amtraks choo
and choo and derail. Toothless fools gum them
selves and drool, paying lip service to their mouths.
Bubblegum mentors flap their minds incessantly,
while their intellect atrophies. Blah. Blah. Blah.
Pink-bellied liberals contend that I blow bub
blegum business out of proportion, hut such is not
the case. It is time they face the facts as we face the
nation. Bubblegum is soft and without much sub
stance. It is bland, uncompetitive, uncapitalistic,
cheap and complacent. Bubblegum adheres to so
cial dirt, leaving its indelible marks on time.
History reveals the infiltration of this joie de blah
into our great land. Coup-minded Lawrence Welk
conducts bubblegum music, cleverly trying to

induce sleep and catch us off guard. He has single
handedly overtaken all American elevators, doc
tor's offices and department stores. He dictatorially
waves his hand and chaos ensues. Our inalienable
rights are unnoted, and I am appalled. He has
deafened, deadened and destroyed many of our
able-bodied, blue-haired senior citizens. Intelli
gence confirms that old people die much, much
more rapidly than people who are not old. 1 can
only thank God, who is obviously on our side be
cause we are right, that I can order young people to
be willing to die for their country. They love rocks,
and they are willing to be stoned.
Unions lull, lobby and lure with their bub
blegum bribes. They are beginning to control every
decent aspect of our lives. Bubblegum has seeped
into our ice cream, our lip gloss and our food ser
vice entrees. Yes, even into our beloved school
meals. Have your teeth ever fought with a piece of
meat which would not break down, and you were
forced to swallow the gray matter because you did

not want your friends to see you spit it out? Well,
you can be sure that the bolus was bubblegum
coated in stale fat. The communists are manufac
turing pop-art, pink-flamingo lawn ornaments, and
cabbage-patch dolls, all in an attempt to put us to
sleep and gross us out.
I will not be found wrong on any of my beliefs.
The evidence against bubblegum is clearly over
whelming. Bubblegum is evil. It is a real tactile sen
sation which creeps and slithers into
anti-intellectual opinion. The cheek will not inherit
the earth: America will. America is strong.
America is proud. And America is right. We must
and we will destroy the heathen bubblegummers
with all of our might. We will chew and grind the
pink communists before the elements of destruc
tion blow up in our faces. (Thunderous claps,
lightning and cheers) Amen.
