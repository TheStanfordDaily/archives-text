As clerical workers, we have a few
comments to make on the latest
piece of slick (and expensive)
propaganda distributed by the Stan
ford administration to the workers
represented by the United Stanford
Workers, Local 680. It was called
the "Stanford Alternative." One of
the charts on this poster refers to
benefits. It implies that bargaining
unit and non-bargaining-unit
workers receive just about the same
benefits. But, this chart neglects to
tell us that many of these benefits
were negotiated, won or improved
by USW first through collective
bargaining. These benefits were then
extended to the rest of the workforce
to prevent us from organizing into
USW.
Something the administration has
not mentioned in this campaign is
the grievance procedure. Clerical
workers cannot file grievances over
work rules or reclassifications and
cannot challenge University policy.
We do not have seniority rights or
hiring preference. Workers
represented by USW can file griev
ances over these issues and more.
We have no union contract. We have
no protection. Instead of a contract,
we have the red book (administrative
guide) which can be interpreted by
management at will. If you are for
tunate enough to work for a person
who is fair and a humanitarian,
certain contract benefits are
manifest. But, for those who work
for managers who cater strictly to the
rules described in the red book, the
union grievance procedure becomes
indispensable.
This is the Stanford alternative.
This proposal will have a severe
impact on the rights of USW mem
bers and the entire workforce here.
For these reasons, we hope that
USW will continue to exist and
become stronger because without
USW, it will be the red book for
everyone.
VOTE YES ON OCT. 30 FOR A
UNION CONTRACT!

Reagan sarcasm
Jeffery Knowlton's column en
titled "Why are we voting for Presi

dent Reagan?" (The Daily, Oct. 25)
is a perfect example of that type of
anti-Reagan sarcasm that has
saturated the campus, as well as the
nation, in the wake of the presiden
tial and vice-presidential debates.
Rather than an analysis of the cur
rent situation in America, it tries to
undermine the strength that this
nation has gained over the past four
years.
As usual, there was the obligatory
reference to Reagan's calling the
Soviet Union the "Evil Empire."
Such a name befits a nation whose
paranoia causes it to kill more than
250 innocent people. Sometimes, the
truth hurts. I can also assure you that
the Soviets do not refer to us as
"fun-loving capitalists." There is also
the allusion to the magical image of
America which Reagan, the actor,
creates. I am fascinated with the
obsession that some political ele
ments have with our president's
former occupation. Had he been a
lawyer, doctor or even humble
peanut farmer, there would not be
the suspicion that surrounds him. For
some reason, people believe that
Reagan is always "putting us on";
that an actor could never be
straightforward with the people.
Such mindless claims show not the
simple-mindedness of our president,
but rather of his opponents, who also
tend to forget that in the interim
between acting and the presidency,
Reagan was the governor of Califor
nia. Such a position has the gravity
of several European heads of state.

Reagan thought
When asked whether he thought
we would survive Armageddon,
President Reagan's exact words
were: "Of course we would." It is
apparent that he has not given much
thought to the nuclear question. A
return to the good old days when we
were ignorant of nuclear power is,
indeed, an appealing dream, but in
the meantime we are developing and
deploying hair-trigger, first-strike
weapons. Democratic presidential
candidate Walter Mondale wants a
step-by-step return to stability, start
ing now. Reagan plans to violate
several existing arms control treaties.
He believes that arms control must
wait until "Star Wars" has given us
clear superiority over the Soviets.
How many years, or decades, will it

take? How many billions, or trillions,
of dollars will it cost? Will it be
effective against all weapons?
Reagan, himself, said: "I don't know
what it would be." He also said that
he has not "round-tabled" the strate
gic implications with the Joint
Chiefs. The choice is clear. Mondale
will reverse the arms race now and
Reagan will hold us hostage until the
development of a trillion-dollar
pie-in-the-sky.

Thought and image
Your editorial (The Daily, Oct.
24) about the Office of Residential
Education and its "inane" tactics to
discourage drinking was wholly
misleading.
The editorial claimed that Res
Ed's request that resident assistants
fill out reports for alcohol-related
incidents will "put RAs in the role of
party police." But your reporting
skills fall short of telling the whole
story.
First of all, the forms do not ask
anyone to identify students in any
way. Even giving the name of the
dorm in which the incident occurred
is optional.
Second, Res Ed never asked RAs
to make "sure Johnny and Suzy
don't get 'mildly intoxicated,' "
contrary to your editorial's assertion.
Res Ed simply wants to know how
alcohol is used and/or abused in
dorms so that the office can be better
prepared to serve students who have
alcohol problems.
Also, Res Ed seeks to encourage
alternatives to alcohol, but it does
not seek to limit alcohol on campus.
There is a tremendous difference,
and I see nothing sinister in its ef
forts to address the serious problem
of student alcoholism. Failure to
fight this problem would be a dis
service. Res Ed is going about it
properly — by educating, not
prohibiting.
The information gathered on the
RA forms will not be used "as am
munition in a battle to ban alcohol
from campus," as your editorial
asserts. It will be used to provide
help services for students who lose
control of their drinking. And that's
a noble cause as far as I'm con
cerned.

As clerical workers, we have a few
comments to make on the latest
piece of slick (and expensive)
propaganda distributed by the Stan
ford administration to the workers
represented by the United Stanford
Workers, Local 680. It was called
the "Stanford Alternative." One of
the charts on this poster refers to
benefits. It implies that bargaining
unit and non-bargaining-unit
workers receive just about the same
benefits. But, this chart neglects to
tell us that many of these benefits
were negotiated, won or improved
by USW first through collective
bargaining. These benefits were then
extended to the rest of the workforce
to prevent us from organizing into
USW.
Something the administration has
not mentioned in this campaign is
the grievance procedure. Clerical
workers cannot file grievances over
work rules or reclassifications and
cannot challenge University policy.
We do not have seniority rights or
hiring preference. Workers
represented by USW can file griev
ances over these issues and more.
We have no union contract. We have
no protection. Instead of a contract,
we have the red book (administrative
guide) which can be interpreted by
management at will. If you are for
tunate enough to work for a person
who is fair and a humanitarian,
certain contract benefits are
manifest. But, for those who work
for managers who cater strictly to the
rules described in the red book, the
union grievance procedure becomes
indispensable.
This is the Stanford alternative.
This proposal will have a severe
impact on the rights of USW mem
bers and the entire workforce here.
For these reasons, we hope that
USW will continue to exist and
become stronger because without
USW, it will be the red book for
everyone.
VOTE YES ON OCT. 30 FOR A
UNION CONTRACT!

Reagan sarcasm
Jeffery Knowlton's column en
titled "Why are we voting for Presi

dent Reagan?" (The Daily, Oct. 25)
is a perfect example of that type of
anti-Reagan sarcasm that has
saturated the campus, as well as the
nation, in the wake of the presiden
tial and vice-presidential debates.
Rather than an analysis of the cur
rent situation in America, it tries to
undermine the strength that this
nation has gained over the past four
years.
As usual, there was the obligatory
reference to Reagan's calling the
Soviet Union the "Evil Empire."
Such a name befits a nation whose
paranoia causes it to kill more than
250 innocent people. Sometimes, the
truth hurts. I can also assure you that
the Soviets do not refer to us as
"fun-loving capitalists." There is also
the allusion to the magical image of
America which Reagan, the actor,
creates. I am fascinated with the
obsession that some political ele
ments have with our president's
former occupation. Had he been a
lawyer, doctor or even humble
peanut farmer, there would not be
the suspicion that surrounds him. For
some reason, people believe that
Reagan is always "putting us on";
that an actor could never be
straightforward with the people.
Such mindless claims show not the
simple-mindedness of our president,
but rather of his opponents, who also
tend to forget that in the interim
between acting and the presidency,
Reagan was the governor of Califor
nia. Such a position has the gravity
of several European heads of state.

Reagan thought
When asked whether he thought
we would survive Armageddon,
President Reagan's exact words
were: "Of course we would." It is
apparent that he has not given much
thought to the nuclear question. A
return to the good old days when we
were ignorant of nuclear power is,
indeed, an appealing dream, but in
the meantime we are developing and
deploying hair-trigger, first-strike
weapons. Democratic presidential
candidate Walter Mondale wants a
step-by-step return to stability, start
ing now. Reagan plans to violate
several existing arms control treaties.
He believes that arms control must
wait until "Star Wars" has given us
clear superiority over the Soviets.
How many years, or decades, will it

take? How many billions, or trillions,
of dollars will it cost? Will it be
effective against all weapons?
Reagan, himself, said: "I don't know
what it would be." He also said that
he has not "round-tabled" the strate
gic implications with the Joint
Chiefs. The choice is clear. Mondale
will reverse the arms race now and
Reagan will hold us hostage until the
development of a trillion-dollar
pie-in-the-sky.

Thought and image
Your editorial (The Daily, Oct.
24) about the Office of Residential
Education and its "inane" tactics to
discourage drinking was wholly
misleading.
The editorial claimed that Res
Ed's request that resident assistants
fill out reports for alcohol-related
incidents will "put RAs in the role of
party police." But your reporting
skills fall short of telling the whole
story.
First of all, the forms do not ask
anyone to identify students in any
way. Even giving the name of the
dorm in which the incident occurred
is optional.
Second, Res Ed never asked RAs
to make "sure Johnny and Suzy
don't get 'mildly intoxicated,' "
contrary to your editorial's assertion.
Res Ed simply wants to know how
alcohol is used and/or abused in
dorms so that the office can be better
prepared to serve students who have
alcohol problems.
Also, Res Ed seeks to encourage
alternatives to alcohol, but it does
not seek to limit alcohol on campus.
There is a tremendous difference,
and I see nothing sinister in its ef
forts to address the serious problem
of student alcoholism. Failure to
fight this problem would be a dis
service. Res Ed is going about it
properly — by educating, not
prohibiting.
The information gathered on the
RA forms will not be used "as am
munition in a battle to ban alcohol
from campus," as your editorial
asserts. It will be used to provide
help services for students who lose
control of their drinking. And that's
a noble cause as far as I'm con
cerned.
