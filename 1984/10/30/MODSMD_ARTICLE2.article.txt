# SUNet 'highway' opens

Micros, minis and mainframes.
IBMs, Apples and HPs. Computers
are a part of the Stanford experience,
affecting virtually everyone on
campus. In fact, the total number of
students enrolled in computer science
courses exceeds the total number of
undergraduates. There are an esti
mated 5,000 computers on campus at
this time, and that number is ex
pected to double by the end of the de
cade.
In response to the growing role of
computers in academics and research
here, the Stanford University Net
work (SUNet), an integrated com
puter networking system, was pro
posed. The board of trustees author
ized $3.7 million for the project in
June, and construction of the network
has now begun.
The computer networking system
will enable the many diverse com
puter systems on campus to com
municate with each other by linking
the University as one electronic or
ganism. It will provide access to
diverse departmental and institu
tional computers from a variety of
campus locations.
If everything proceeds as planned,
the system will be completed in
December 1985. After its comple
tion, the system's flexibility will allow
it to accommodate new standards and
technology as they are developed.
SUNet will function like an infor

mation highway among the com
puters in the 200 buildings on campus
that will eventually be connected by
the system. SUNet will put down the
highway and the major access roads
from shared facilities in public areas.
But departments or individuals
who wish to become connected with
the "network highway" will have to
build their own access roads. As
many people as want to will be able to
build these access points at their own
expense. Consultation and advice as
to how to make connections with the
network will be provided by the Aca
demic Computing and Information
Systems personnel.
Each academic department has dif
ferent needs regarding the network
ing system, according to Bill Yundt,
Director of the Networking Systems
Division of ACIS. Some departments
need high-speed capabilities, others
need video and others have only one
type of computer within the depart
ment and therefore can use systems
developed by their own particular
vendor for most of their communica
tion needs. With SUNet, each depart
ment will decide to what extent it will
be connected to the networking sys
tem.
SUNet will provide the Stanford
community with a number of
benefits. The most obvious advantage
will be the convenience of accessing
and exchanging information among
the smaller (departmental) networks,

computer systems and personal com
puters across campus. Without the
network, making different computer
systems on campus "talk to each
other" is a time-consuming process
that often isn't worth the effort.
For example, there is currently no
set way to transfer files from one sys
tem to another. SUNet will set up its
own temporary standards — that can
be altered as universal standards are
agreed upon by the industry — which
will allow files to be exchanged easily.
University planners say economy
and convenience will result from the
ability of departments and individuals
to share expensive hardware and
software. Access to high-quality
printers, phototypesetters and mass
storage devices will be available to
many people through SUNet.
SUNet will also offer some indirect
benefits. Other universities with
similar network systems have experi
enced a greatly increased flow of
communication among the faculty
and the student body. SUNet also
makes Stanford more attractive to
computer companies looking for test
beds for new and existing products.
A June report listed some specific
ways in which undergraduates with
personal computers could benefit
from SUNet. They would be able to
use the network for access to: a social
science computer system, to pick up
data for analysis; the IBM computer,
for library catalog access for an En
glish paper; LOTS/DEC computers,
to participate in an electronic debate

for a political science course; and the
Biological Sciences Department net
work to transfer a homework assign
ment to a teaching assistant for
grading and return.
Construction of the system is going
well according to Bill Yundt. "We are
almost, but not quite on schedule,"
he said.
Six miles of trench will be dug for
the 50 to 60 miles of duct needed for
the project. In an effort to save
money, SUNet coordinated its needs
with those of the Electricity Manage
ment and Control System and the
telephone system. Conduits for all
three projects will be laid in one
•'digging."
The only potential problem Yundt

said might keep things from running
on schedule is bad weather this win
ter. "If we get a lot of rain, the con
duits and manholes fill with water and
must be pumped, which can really
slow things down," he said.
It is too early to tell whether or not
the cost estimates will be accurate
since most of the major contracts
have not been awarded yet. The $3.7
million authorized in June will sup
posedly cover the costs of building
the system.
Yundt estimated the maintenance
and operating costs after completion
of the system at about $1 million per
year. These figures do not include
special projects within departments
but do include shared computers.
