## 'Bloods': interviews without cohesion 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
''Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by
Black Veterans"
By Wallace Terry
Random House, $17.95, 312 pp.
The experience of black soldiers in Vietnam unques
tionably involves some complex factors. By policy, if not
in practice, the services were ahead of the rest of America
in supporting integration and equal opportunity. Yet the
system of exemptions in the draft process and in assign
ments led to a disproportionate number of blacks being
given combat duties. And while black soldiers were fighting
across the Pacific, the struggle for civil rights went through
its most active stages during the 1960s and early '70s.
In an effort to explain and make vivid the special prob
lems that blacks encountered during and after the war,
Wallace Terry's "Bloods" offers a series of interviews
with 20 black veterans. The interviewees were not all
combat infantrymen, and their experiences during the war

were diverse. The problems they encountered following
their return to civilian life are more consistent, but Terry
has come up with a sample that does not fall into a clear
pattern right away. And Terry has made editorial deci
sions that prevent us from finding informative conclusions
about the broader issues he seems interested in address
ing. While "Bloods" is rich in precious bits of information,
Terry doesn't help us put them together to improve our
understanding of the bigger issues. He seems satisfied with
getting us to sympathize with the men he covered as a cor
respondent during the war.
The format Terry chose is responsible for this. He relies
exclusively on interviews, and does not even give the
questions he presumably asked during the talks. Nor does
he indicate how he may have rearranged and edited the
material. The kinds of issues Terry intends for his book to
address receive consideration only as they occur to his in
terviewees, and the interpretations offered are theirs. Ob
viously, the insightfulness of these men's views is inconsis

tent. I found most of their reactions to broader issues
simplistic and shallow, however vivid their emotional
responses.
Taking the book merely as a collection of information
that can help us empathize with these men, "Bloods" is
largely successful. Instead of numbing the reader with the
usual collection of Vietnam horror stories, Terry has cho
sen interviewees who were given all sorts of assignments,
and some of whom had a more comfortable time during
the war than they ever did before or after. Partly because
the interviews are not altered to dress up grammar or dic
tion, the accounts have a strong personal tone, and the in
terviewees come across as very distinct individuals. And
although the artlessness of their stories sometimes reduces
the immediacy of the events they recount, the reactions
these men had to their experiences are powerfully appar
ent.
Perhaps if Terry didn't pitch "Bloods" as a way to help
us understand the problems of black soldiers as a special
group, I wouldn't be dissatisfied with this book. I don't
mean to say that the experiences recounted in "Bloods"
fail to show that the black soldier's tour in Vietnam and
his return to the United States were different. But the in
terviewees tend to explain the special difficulties they en
countered by invoking easy platitudes. Toward the end of
the book I began to suspect that the illuminating division
of Vietnam veterans might not be one of race, but rather
between officers and enlisted personnel, so much more in
formative were the interviews with officers.
As a source of combat stories, "Bloods" falls far behind
Phillip Caputo's "A Rumor of War" and Michael Herr's
"Dispatches." Terry's own magazine articles on the posi
tion of black soldiers in Vietnam will probably satisfy the
reader interested in issues more than this book can. But
for anyone who wants a wider picture of the different as
signments and experiences of the people who went to
Vietnam, and wants to see how those experiences affected
individuals, "Bloods" is the book of choice.
