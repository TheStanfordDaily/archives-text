## 'Talking With... 'an important play 
### NANCY HENRY 
"Talking With . . a strikingly
perceptive and touching play showing
at the Nova Theatre in San Francisco
through this weekend, offers brief hut
revealing glimpses into the hearts and
minds of eleven women who are rep
resentative, yet unique, within their
self-contained segments of American
society.
The title of this collection of osten
sibly unrelated monologues is par
ticulary appropriate. It is indeed a
conversation with the characters.
Each scene requires as much concen
tration and attention on the part of
the audience as any conversation be
tween two people. There are no dis
tractions; everything depends on the
content and delivery of the lines. To
keep our attention, such a script must
be consistently intriguing. In this pro
duction, the candidness of these un
self-conscious confessions and the ap
peal of the personalities created by
the actors result in an effective
theatrical and personal experience.
One would be justified in reading
this play for either its social commen
tary or for its character analysis, but
to overlook either would be a
mistake; the two are interwoven, bril
liantly and significantly. Each wo
man, becausee of her background —
the circumstances and people that
surround and define her — is
restricted in the choices she can make
about her life. How to cope, survive
and find happiness within a predeter
mined framework is the question that
confronts them and unifies their
stories. They have all made radically
creative choices, and the play sug
gests that they are tragically trapped
by their society, but that they are
strong, independent, and satisfied in
dividuals.
By most standards these characters
are painfully sad, demented or just
pitiful because they grasp at straws
or find solutions to their predica
ments which we would consider
deplorable, compromising or simply
abnormal. Ambiguity, however,
exists only in our minds. Most of
these strong-willed women, though
victimized and perhaps aware of it,
have come to terms with themselves
and their choices.
The play opens with two of its most
effective sketches. Sharon Harrington

as an actress who, in her fifteen
minutes on stage, presents a picture
of her world, her "role" in it, and
then slowly lets down the mask she
wears offstage. The person under
neath is sensitive, insecure, fragile,
and though she has chosen her life
style, her one humble wish is to see
and know the audience to whom she
exposes herself every day. Her des
perate plea for interaction with
people, and for understanding,
genuinely touches anyone sitting in
the theater. Her intimate, sincere
and penetrating gaze is impossible to
avoid. Our inability to respond only
reinforces her point. Disillusioned,
Harrington regains composure and
resumes the confident demeanor of a
successful and happy professional.
The actress is a sad example of role
playing and escapism, but does not
approach the bizarre as the second
monologue does, carrying the same
theme a step futher into the realm of
fantasy and imaginative schizophre
nia. "Scraps" is a housewife in one
life, but no one except this audience
knows that when the kids and hus
band leave each morning, she trans
forms herself into the patchwork doll
she remembers from the "Oz" series
of children's books. She remains in
the mythical kingdom her children
grew up in and out of, but which
strikes her as a glimmer of light in her
otherwise dull, unfulfilling, realisti
cally inescapable existence. Far from
unconscious of her choice, Scraps
surprises us with remarks such as,
"You probably think I'm crazy. You
probably think I should see an analyst
or go back to school, take law classes
at night." Potentially bitter or sting
ing, the comments ring disturbingly
true, so gentle and full of humor is
this character who giggles, "My hus
band can't understand why I put yel
low linoleum in the kitchen." The
passive resignation is a front. Scraps
has acted to create a means of sur
vival. Who is to say that living in the
Emerald City is less desirable or
rewarding than going to law school at
night?
Although it never drags, due to the
concentration required, "Talking
With" is emotionally draining and a
bit too long. It would not hurt the
whole to simply eliminate one or two
monologues from the script. "Clear

Glass Marbles," a young woman's
reminiscence about her mother's
unique way of dealing with a
prolonged death, is itself an extended
ordeal. Slow and morbid, it tries too
hard to strike a sentimental vein. On
the other hand, "The Audition," ex
amining the desperate willingness of
an actress to do anything for a part,
comes on too strong for such a small
theater, pounding rather than prod
ding the audience into recognition of
its message. The final piece,
"Marks," is imaginative and depress
ingly relevant, but perhaps because it
is last, seems unnecessarily drawn
out. Each portrait contributes some
thing to the whole, and together pres

ent a provocative picture of women in
modern American culture.
Many are extreme — downright
strange — but do represent universal
longings, abuses and defenses. Other
outstanding performances come from
Olivia Charles, Deborah McDonald,
and Blancett Reynolds, who contrib
ute to the play's religious undertones
by likening paradise to Mac Donalds,
baton twirling and snake-handling,
respectively. All the scenes suggest
that this is a relative world. Who can
be sure that Scraps is crazy, that twirl
ing is not "the physical parallel of
revelation," "blue collar zen," and
that heaven is not a Big Mac?
From where most of us sit, these

women are simultaneously appalling,
fascinating, unsettling but un
deniably perseptive and humorous. If
encountered on the street, they would
appear strange and very far removed
from our world. Usually a play, as
emphasized in the first monologue, is
just such a distant encounter.
"Talking With" differs in that it is
talking with these people, getting to
know them. Their uniqueness lies in
their ability to say, "This is who I am
and what I believe; take or leave
me." No explanation or analysis.
The audience abstracts from the
particulars what it will. The play is,
above all, a masterpiece in the fine art
of portait painting. It is a great credit

to the playwright, Jane Martin, and
the actors and director that it
succeeds. It is an experience with
truth, with an honesty not usually
found on- or offstage, causing us to
question whether we are comfortable
with such honesty. Were the issues
not so delicately and tactfully han
dled, the play would prove as discon
certing but not as endearing.
"Talking With" is the second effort
of director Barbara Daoust and hus
band Patrick Joseph. This is a solid,
creative production of a new and im
portant play. Stanford students
seeking reasonable, high quality en
tertainment and an excuse to visit the
City, will find both here.
