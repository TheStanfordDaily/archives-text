						look down the road 
### 
In all likelihood, the Pacific 10
Conference football title will be
decided Nov. 3 when the Univer
sity of Washington plays at USC.
And that's exactly why Stanford
is in the best possible position to
pull off an upset. The Trojans
might be thinking not about this
week's game but about next Satur
day's home game against Wash
ington. That's good news for the
Cardinal, which has a realistic
chance to finish this season with
two consecutive victories even if it
doesn't defeat the bigger, favored
Trojans.
To end positively, Stanford will
have to defeat the University of
Arizona in Tucson. But the verdict
has not yet been reached regard
ing Stanford's performance on the
road.
A loss to the University of
Oklahoma, in the season opener,
is something accrued by many a
team. The Cardinal's victory over
UCLA, though, was a fairly effi
cient effort — for about three
quarters. Stanford's third game
away from home, against Oregon
State University Saturday, was
nearly a disaster. But, hey, they all
count the same in the 'W column
— even if you're behind at one
juncture, 21-0, to a team histori
cally one of the worst around.
To finish 1984 on a winning
note and with a winning record for
the first time since 1980, the Car
dinal also will have to overcome
talent gaps to defeat USC and
Arizona. Against the University of
California at Berkeley, Stanford
will be in the unfamiliar position
of being the better team going into
a game.
On Saturday, the Bears looked
bad in their 31-7 loss to the
Trojans, who are 6-1 (5-0 in the
Pac-10). But Cal was keeping with
tradition Saturday. The Bears
have not been too golden against
the Men of Troy in the Los An
geles Coliseum — they have been
outscored, 138-14, in their past
three visits.
In the homestretch of its season,
Stanford will have to overcome yet
• another obstacle, if you believe

coaches — specifically Arizona's
Larry Smith, Oregon State's Joe
Avezzano. the University of
Oregon's Rich Brooks and Cal's
Joe Kapp. Smith has an interesting
theory regarding the Pac-10's
hierarchy, and his aforementioned
peers agree with it, to at least
some extent.
Smith, in fact, was blunt about
his feelings about his conference's
officiating.
"I think the Pac-10 officiating
stinks," Smith told the San Fran
cisco Examiner. "I'm sick of it. It's
front-running, that's what it is.
They (the officials) go for the
front-running teams. I've felt it for
a long time. If it's a judgment call,
you never get it. They want them
(USC, Washington and UCLA,
the first-, second- and third-place
teams in the Pac-10) in the Rose
Bowl."
Hmm. I'd say this guy has a
gripe. Well, most of it has to do
with Smith's Wildcats losing, 17-
14, to USC Oct. 20. Arizona lost a
touchdown when a ball was stolen
by a USC player from a Wildcat
who apparently had made a touch
down catch.
Smith had more to say.
"I've never gotten a judgment
call against Washington or USC. I
never have and never will."
It's very nice of Smith to tell the
world about the inequity of life in
the Pac-10, but he's making a
mistake. Officials remember those
niceties. They are the first to admit
that they make mistakes, but they
don't like to be reminded harshly
about it, and they don't like to be
labeled biased. It's unfortunate for
Arizona because if they aren't get
ting shafted by the referees now, it
could begin to happen.
Stanford has enough problems
of its own retaining leads, scoring
points and keeping its opponent
from gaining fewer than 400 yards
per game. But, according to Smith,
the Cardinal also has to deal with
slanted officiating. I'll let him tell
you: "It happens to Oregon State,
to Stanford and Oregon."
