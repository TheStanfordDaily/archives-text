## Olesen 3rd, Card 5th in Pac-10 meet 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford men's cross country
team got a third-place finish from
sophomore Marc Olesen yesterday to
take fifth place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference championships at the Stan
ford Golf Course.
Olesen ran the course in 30
minutes, 36.8 seconds to finish 12
seconds behind winner Tom
Ansberry of the University of
Arizona and fewer than five seconds
behind second-place Chris Hamilton
of the University of Oregon. In last
year's Pac-10 championships, Olesen
was seventh with a time of 30:48.7.
Stanford was fifth in the meet, even
though Olesen was the only Cardinal
runner to finish in the top 22.
Arizona, whose runners had four of
the top 10 times, defended its title
with 44 points, 29 less than runner-up
Washington State University. UCLA
was third with 75 points, and Oregon
was fourth with 82. USC was the only
Pac-10 member not to compete.
The best Stanford result after
Olesen's was senior Jeff Atkinson's
31:43.5, which was good enough for
23rd place. Senior Brian Pettingill
came in 29th place with a 32:07.8,
junior Ryan Stoll was 33rd at
32:14.5, junior Charles Alexander
finished in 34th at 32:17.0, freshman
Steve Schadler had a 33:45.0 for 54th
place and David Anderson was 58th
with a 34:55.7. Alexander was 20th
at last year's conference champion
ship.
Cardinal Coach Brooks Johnson
said the Cardinal men had a "decent
finish."
"I think getting fifth is probably
realistic," he said. "We could have
raced better, but it's a realistic finish

with the four teams we had in front of
us. Fifth isn't bad."
Olesen was one of three who
placed in the top 10 in the Pac-10
championships this and last season.
Ansberry, an Ail-American, finished
third last year with a time of 30:35.2.
Oregon's Mike Blackmore, who was
second in 1983, was not in the top 10
yesterday, and Arizona's Andre
Woods finished eighth both years.
Woods had a 30:52.5, which was one
second slower than his time last
season.
According to Johnson, Olesen's
training and results both are different
from last season.
"He's run well for us all year
'round," Johnson said. "Last year, he
was in better shape but he didn't
compete well. This year, he didn't
work as hard in the summer, but he's
competing better."
Olesen was second in the Stanford
Invitational Oct. 6, and Ansberry
finished seventh, 27 seconds behind
Olesen. Arizona won that meet with
27 points, 57 fewer than second-place
UCLA, and Stanford finished 10th. A
team's score results from adding the
places of its runners. For example, if a
team's runners were the top five in a
meet, its score would be 15.
Johnson said Arizona's finish yes
terday was not unexpected.
"1 think it was pretty well known
they would win," he said. "Last year,
they won the conference champion
ship and went on to get wasted at the
NCAAs. I hope it's not deja vu (this
year)."
In last season's Pac-10 meet,
Arizona had 38 points, six fewer than
Oregon. Stanford finished fourth with
80 points then, six points behind
third-place UCLA.
