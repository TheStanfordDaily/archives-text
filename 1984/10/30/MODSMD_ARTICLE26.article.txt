## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
After a week-long layoff, the Stan
ford men's soccer team travels to
Fresno today to play Fresno Pacific
College in a non-conference match.
Fresno Pacific, ranked seventh in
the country in the National Associa
tion of Intercollegiate Athletics, is in
the same district as Westmont College.

which has tied both Fresno Pacific and
Stanford this season. The Cardinal
tied Westmont, 1-1, Sept. 22.
Fresno Pacific is 13-3-1, with losses
to the University of California at
Berkeley, Fresno State University,
and Cal State Dominguez Hills. The
Cardinal, 8-6-3, also lost to Fresno
State earlier this season, 3-0 at
Fresno Oct. 3.

Stanford Head Coach Sam Koch
believes the week off has been put to
good use. "We've done a lot of condi
tioning, and we've worked on our set
plays," Koch said. "We've also sat
ourselves down to think about what
we need to do to improve as a team."
Koch said he felt the layoff has also
been beneficial in other ways. "It's
been helpful. It's given us some time,

and we haven't been as rushed as
we've been in the past. We've taken
two days off for the first time since
the start of the season to kind of get
back to normal."
Although the Cardinal beat Fresno
Pacific, 1-0, last season, Koch said a
repeat performance will be difficult.
"Iheir backs are weak, but they are a
good short-passing team," Koch said.
"Give them space, and they'll kill
you."
Fresno Pacific is guaranteed a
berth in the NAIA national tourna
ment because it is the host team.
Fresno Head Coach Ben Nor
ton said rather than making his team
complacent, the playoff spot has
helped the Sunbirds. "We've played
pretty relaxed this season," Norton
said. "Maybe it's helped our game."
