# Week of Oct. 22-29
## Police Blotter 
### 
A male suspect robbed a woman at knifepoint yesterday in Tresidder
Memorial Union. The robber took an unknown amount of money from
an employee in a Servomation Food Service office at 4:20 p.m. Accord
ing to Stanford Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer, the police hope to arrest
the man today after having worked all yesterday on a warrant for the
"viable suspect." No other details of the crime could be released at press
time.
An unknown person telephoned a bomb threat to the operator at the
Stanford Medical Center at 7:50 p.m. on Oct. 23. According to police,
the center periodically receives such threats and so took no special
evacuation measures.
Something, or rather someone, did however "go bust" over the week.
Police arrested Albert Beyner for possession of amphetamines, cocaine
and marijuana after they stopped him at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 25 near El
Camino Real and Stanford Avenue. Beyner, who is not a student, was
booked into the North County Jail. Later that evening, police ap
prehended Brian Bauen in the car he was attempting to steal from a
gentleman on Gerona Street. Besides the two felonies, police also made
seven misdemeanor arrests last week.
A female jogger encountered an exhibitionist near Lake Lagunita
around 5:40 p.m. on Oct. 23. The man, wearing only a red athletic sup
porter, jumped out of some bushes and attempted to expose himself
when the woman was running by. This second indecent incident came
five days after one in Escondido Village, when a woman saw a man
expose himself outside her window in the evening.
Stanford boasts some mean streets in the early morning. Two area wo
men were booked into Elmwood Jail during the week for driving under
the influence. Mary Genochio was stopped on Oct. 24 in the vicinity of
El Camino Real and Churchill Street, while Gail Perez was pulled over
on Mayfield Avenue on Oct. 28. Neither was involved in the four vehicle
and bicycle collisions last week.
Automobiles nonetheless figured heavily in the recent crime scene.
On Oct. 24, burglars removed a backpack from one car around 6 p.m.
and the stereo from another between 9:45 and 10:30 p.m. An unknown
person or persons removed an entire vehicle from its parking place near
Stern Hall around 1:15 p.m. on Oct. 26. An attempt on another car was
unsuccessful when the owner spied the burglar trying to enter the car
around 7:30 a.m. on Oct. 27. The car was parked in the 300 block of
Mayfield Avenue.
A burglar took the wallet of a Wilbur Hall resident between 3:00 p.m.
Oct. 24 and 9:30 a.m. Oct. 25. The owner later found the wallet without
the money.
The University suffered grand theft (over $400) when an unknown
party took two jackhammers, two air hoses and a battery from the yard
area at Plant Services. Police speculate the theft occurred between 4
p.m. and 8 a.m. on Oct. 19-23. A total of six counts of grand theft and
four of petty theft were committed. Bicycle thefts have subsided some
what, as some of the eight reported actually happened earlier. Recent
unlucky locations included Alpha Sigma, Alvarado Row, Crothers
Memorial, Escondido Village, Florence Moore, the business school and
Toyon Hall.
