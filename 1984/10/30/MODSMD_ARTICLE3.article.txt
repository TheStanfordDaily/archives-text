# Union polls to open today

### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Technical, maintenance and service
workers employed by the University
vote in a National Labor Relations
Board election today to determine if
Local 680 will represent them "for
the purposes of collective bargain
ing."
In recent weeks both sides have
been campaigning for the event. The
University has distributed a poster
and several handouts to eligible
voters. Stanford Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler said the University has dis
tributed factual information on a va
riety of topics, including Local 680's
record as a bargaining representative.
"They have had two strikes that we
think are unnecessary but we don't
say that," Wheeler said.
Neither side was was willing to dis
close the size of its campaign budget.
Wheeler said the amount Stanford
spent was "nothing like what the
union has claimed."
"I doubt if we spent as much as
(Local) 680," Wheeler added.
Local 680 President Linda Crouse
said the "Pac Man poster (the poster
printed by the University) probably
cost more than all" of the union's
campaign.
Stanford's campaign also dealt with
the "Stanford Alternative," the
University-proposed alternative to
union representation, the "Union
Leadership Record at Stanford," and
questions about voting.
Wheeler said the University also
held meetings with supervisors which
were "geared toward explaining is
sues."
In addition to distributing hand

outs, Local 680 sponsored a
"Welcome Back Rally" featuring
Cesar Cavez, organizer of the Cali
fornia farm workers and Education
Prof. Martin Carnoy, a Democratic
candidate for Congress. The union
also talked to workers individually
and produced a video tape of long
time employees discussing the value
of the union.
Crouse said the union ran a
"positive campaign," which showed
"the difference between having and
not having a union."
Local 680 cites better wages, a
first-ever dental plan, severance pay,
birthday holidays, equal treatment
and seniority rights, an improved re
tirement plan, and better shift
premiums as benefits "won through
long and hard bargaining."
In the University's handout, "The
Union Leadership at Stanford Ac
cording to the Union Leaders Them
selves," Stanford urges voters to
"consider the kind of union leader
ship you get for your money" before
they vote.
Stanford then quotes Local 715 of
ficials who say Local 680's leaders
"have hampered the union in effec
tively representing the workers in
their relationship with the manage
ment of the University."
The University also quotes Local
715 leaders as saying, "Ms. Crouse is
in constant attack."
Crouse said, "Stanford University
mounted a negative campaign, at
tacking union and union leadership
and did everything to divert from the
main issue: Are the workers better
off with or without a union?"
