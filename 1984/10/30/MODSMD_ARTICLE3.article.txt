# Union polls to open today
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Technical, maintenance and service
workers employed by the University
vote in a National Labor Relations
Board election today to determine if
Local 680 will represent them "for
the purposes of collective bargain
ing."
In recent weeks both sides have
been campaigning for the event. The
University has distributed a poster
and several handouts to eligible
voters. Stanford Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler said the University has dis
tributed factual information on a va
riety of topics, including Local 680's
record as a bargaining representative.
"They have had two strikes that we
think are unnecessary but we don't
say that," Wheeler said.
Neither side was was willing to dis
close the size of its campaign budget.
Wheeler said the amount Stanford
spent was "nothing like what the
union has claimed."
"I doubt if we spent as much as
(Local) 680," Wheeler added.
Local 680 President Linda Crouse
said the "Pac Man poster (the poster
printed by the University) probably
cost more than all" of the union's
campaign.
Stanford's campaign also dealt with
the "Stanford Alternative," the
University-proposed alternative to
union representation, the "Union
Leadership Record at Stanford," and
questions about voting.
Wheeler said the University also
held meetings with supervisors which
were "geared toward explaining is
sues."
In addition to distributing hand

outs, Local 680 sponsored a
"Welcome Back Rally" featuring
Cesar Cavez, organizer of the Cali
fornia farm workers and Education
Prof. Martin Carnoy, a Democratic
candidate for Congress. The union
also talked to workers individually
and produced a video tape of long
time employees discussing the value
of the union.
Crouse said the union ran a
"positive campaign," which showed
"the difference between having and
not having a union."
Local 680 cites better wages, a
first-ever dental plan, severance pay,
birthday holidays, equal treatment
and seniority rights, an improved re
tirement plan, and better shift
premiums as benefits "won through
long and hard bargaining."
In the University's handout, "The
Union Leadership at Stanford Ac
cording to the Union Leaders Them
selves," Stanford urges voters to
"consider the kind of union leader
ship you get for your money" before
they vote.
Stanford then quotes Local 715 of
ficials who say Local 680's leaders
"have hampered the union in effec
tively representing the workers in
their relationship with the manage
ment of the University."
The University also quotes Local
715 leaders as saying, "Ms. Crouse is
in constant attack."
Crouse said, "Stanford University
mounted a negative campaign, at
tacking union and union leadership
and did everything to divert from the
main issue: Are the workers better
off with or without a union?"
Wheeler said the benefits of union
workers "are the same as non-union
workers who did it without a strike."
Local 680, on the other hand, says
in one of its handouts, "We believe
that we have made Stanford a better
place to work â€” not only for the
1,330 Stanford employees we repre
sent, but also for all other Stanford
employees who receive the benefits
we won or improved in our Union
contract."
The processing of grievences has
been another hotly contested issue.
The difference between the union
grievence process and the Univer
sity's is "ours is successful at problem
solving," Wheeler said.
The University has said that it will
continue to process grievances
regardless of the outcome of tomor
row's election.
"You don't need to vote for the
local 680 union to have these griev
ances arbitrated," Stanford said in
one of its handouts.
Local 680 has said that in non
union grievance procedures the ad
ministration "lets you go to arbitra
tion only after they fire you or lay you
off permanently."
"On top of that, the administration
picks the panel of arbitrators," the
flyer says.
Crouse said without a union, there
would be "no fair grievence proce
dure, no guaranteed benefits or
wages." Without a union the Univer
sity can "unilaterally set rights, wages
and benifits at any time," Crouse
said.
Polls will open at 6 a.m. at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
Auditorium, Memorial Auditorium,
and the medical center. The votes will
be counted in Memorial Auditorium
after the polls close at 8 p.m.
